This is why!

-Father, they took Merlyn.
-Lass, no.

No, you're not going after him.
Not in there.

225
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,352
But we can't leave him.

I'd keep you safe.

Did you not see?
'Twas a Wolfwalker, by Crom!

233
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,517
Now calm down, will you.

234
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,727
Everyone knows you
can't be cutting down their woods.

235
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,813
If you do, they'll get you.
Sure, that's the deal.

236
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,398
There's no deal with anyone.

237
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:26,361

and you're breaking it, you eejits!

-We need to clear the woods.
-Did you not see?

239
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,031
Actually, I did see the wolf attack.

240
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,993
The way them wolves answered her call.

241
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,288
Them forests is riddled with wolves,
I tell you.

242
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,998
Well, won't be long
before the wolves are gone.

243
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,710
It won't be long before they're
inside the town walls with the hunger.

244
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,921
No. No, we'll tame these lands.
The Lord Protector has ordered it.

245
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,842
Ah, the great Lord Protector.

246
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,471
Renowned for being true to his word.
Hilarious.

247
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,848
At least the old king kept us safe.

248
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,477
He's just an upstart. Lord Protector.

249
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,313
Lord Protector.

250
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,814

251
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:04,065
-[soldier 1] Oi!
-[soldier 2] Come here!

252
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,861
If you have grievances,
you should speak with me directly.

253
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:08,987
What are you doing? No!

254
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,907
-Get your hands off of--
-Hold still!

255
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,035
-Jesus, Mary and Joseph. This is a joke.
-[soldier 1] Ah, get in.

256
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,621
Let me out of here!

257
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,832
I did nothing wrong!

258
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,085
By Crom! The devil take your head!

259
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,254
-Another wolf attack?
-Aye, my lord.

260
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,050
A few more like him and we have
another rebellion on our hands.

261
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,638
If we do not clear the trees,
the farmers cannot work the land,

262
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,308
and the woodcutters cannot clear the trees
with these wolves.

263
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,435
-This is not acceptable.
-Aye, my lord.

264
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,688
We must show them
the wolves are no threat.

265
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,191
They're just beasts. Finish them.

266
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,275
Yes, my lord.

267
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,448
And this is your girl, yes?

268
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:56,118
It is, my lord. Uh, Robyn.

269
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:00,414
There should be no child beyond the walls.
Why is she not in the scullery?

270
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,332
My lord, she--
she doesn't work there. She--

271
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,794
You! See to it that the girl
reports to the scullery.

272
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:06,878
Father.

273
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,005
Do as the Lord Protector commands, lass.

274
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,597
I ride out to deal
with the revolt in the south.

275
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:21,643
When I return, I want all the wolves
gone from this forest.

276
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,688
-Yes, my lord.
-Goodfellowe, you have two days.

277
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,523
Don't waste them.

278
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,832
Hey, psst, girl.

279
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:47,127
The one who took your bird,
I've seen her before.

280
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,463
A while back with her mammy.

281
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,717
Cross my heart,
she's one of them Wolfwalkers.

282
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,343
Wolfwalkers?

283
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,596
Yeah, Wolfwalkers.

284
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,684
The ones that can talk to wolves, like.
But you know, they can heal as well.

285
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,979
Her mother healed me with some wild magic.

286
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,733
Maybe she'll fix your bird up.
Maybe she'll eat him.

287
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,111
-I don't know.
-Oh... I need to get him back.

288
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,698
I'd say once we're behind them walls,
neither of us is going anywhere.

289
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,162
-Can you keep a secret?
-Huh?

290
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,708
-Aw! My sheep.

lock that gate right at all.

You let them sheep out, didn't you?

294
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,884
Oh, yeah. Blame me for that too.
Everything is Seán Óg's fault!

295
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,636
Get back in the cart, you.

Oi! Get him!

00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,481
[soldier] Hey, whatever your name is,
get back in that cart!

301
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,816
Round up those sheep.

302
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,859
Off of me! Have you no manners at all?

303
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,112
Get back in there, you!

304
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,780
An extra week in the stocks for that.

305
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,657
-Where's the girl gone?
-Don't see her.

306
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,033
Maybe in the woods.

307
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:03,537
Oi, you two, look out for a girl.
She ran into the forest.

308
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,873
Get her and bring her back to the castle.

Huh? Merlyn?

365
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,208
Merlyn! Wait!

366
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,501

You can come out now.
We can smell you. Yeah, you stink.

398
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,603
I knew you were here.
Come out of your hidey-hole.

Don't kill me.

Ha! I do what I like. Come here.

405
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,157
You're-- You're a-a--

406
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,869
A Wolfwalker. So what?
You should thank me.

407
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,871
-Why?
-I saved your life.

408
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,706
Saved me? You bit me!

409
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,792
Well, you kicked me
in the gob enough times.

410
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,168
Well, you were attacking me.

411
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:27,546
I was trying to get you out of that trap.

412
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,173
And anyway, you came into my woods.

413
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,092
Your woods? They're our woods.

414
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,428
Your wolves are attacking the woodcutters
and the sheep.

415
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:38,974
They should be staying closer to the town
and so should you, townie.

416
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,435
-Now give us a look at you.
-[groans]

417
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,645
-Are you seeing things?
-Ugh! Get off me!

418
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,605
-How's your smell?
-Ugh! Stop it!

419
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,816
Smells like townie. Any extra fur?

420
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:49,651
Ugh! That's mine! Get away!

421
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,572
Now, stop moving and let me fix it
before it's too late.

422
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,865
Hey, get off me!

423
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,409
Will you stop? Let me fix it!

424
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,870
Ugh! Fine.

425
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:11,381
[howling]

426
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,761
But what?

427
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:20,182
Well, fixed now. Never happened.
Off you go.

428
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,475
You did heal Merlyn.

429
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,395
Yeah. I fixed you and your bird
and saved your life.

430
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,522
You're welcome, townie. Bye!

431
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:28,732
No, wait. Who's that?

432
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,151
Is she your... your mother?

433
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,904
Ugh. You better go
or the wolves will eat you.

434
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,072
What? But I don't--

435
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,325
Oh, no. Too late. They're gonna eat you!

436
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,409
No!

437
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,794

441
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,265
Run away, townie girl!
The wolves are after you!

442
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,643
-[panting]
-Can't get away from us, townie!

443

-[screams] Get away from me!
-[girl laughs]

444
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,189
But you're so slow.

445
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:13,151
Scared of your shadows, you are.
What would a townie know about wolves?

446
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,278
Why do you have so much stuff?

447
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,614
Hey, stop! That's my gear for hunting!

448
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:20,325
Oh, a hunter. Ha! A little girl like you?

449
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,035
Uh, well, you're a girl too.

450
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,287
I'm no girl! I'm a Wolfwalker!

451
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,372
[screams]

452
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,581
Whoa!

453
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:27,999
Up you go!

454
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,126
[grunts]

455
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,711
When I sleeps, I'm a wolf.

456
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:36,299
When I'm awake, I'm me, Mebh!
Mebh Óg MacTire!

457
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,051
What's your name, anyway?

458
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,011
-Robyn.
-Robyn?

459
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:44,641
Mm. I like birdies.
I climb so high to catch them.

460
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,853
I'm too smart for them, though.
They can't get away from me for long.

461
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,397
[panting]

462
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,026
Ugh. [screams]

463
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,737
-Oh.
-[Mebh laughs]

464
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,490
Caught again. Some hunter.

465
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,952
That's two for me, none for you.

466
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,662
[Robyn] Whoa!

467
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:10,292
Ugh. Stop being so annoying.
It's not funny, you know.

468
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,752
Argh! Let me down!

469
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,795
[chuckles] All right, townie.

470
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,547
If you say so.

471
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,342
No, wait! Oh! [grunts, groans]

472
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:20,469
Oh!

473
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,388
Hey! Stop calling me "townie."

474
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:26,808
All right, Robyn.
Back home with you. Fun's over.

475
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:30,061
Well, Mebh Ogamacatemera, your idea--

476
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,105
-Shh! Do you hear that?
-What?

477
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:34,441
A man. I'll get rid of him. [growls]

478
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,152
A man? [gasps] Oh, no. Father.

479
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:40,071
[pants] Ah!

480
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:44,034
[gasps, pants]

481
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,208
Just one townie.
I'll give him a bit of a scare.

482
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,626
-No, stop.
-[grunts]

483
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,212
Huh?

Hmm. [sniffs]

489
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,989
Mm.

[sighs] That was too close.

494
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:40,006
What are you so scared of?
We have a pack of wolves with us.

495
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,551
[grunting]

496
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,762
Hey, I told you.

497
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:50,934
You can't go out in the daytime.
Mammy said so. Go back to bed.

498
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,936
[grunts]
Is that your mummy back in the cave?

499
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:55,689
Of course! Sure don't I look like her?

500
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:59,526
And are any of the other wolves,
uh, people too?

501
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,404
No. Jeepers! Are you mad?

502
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:04,239
How big do you think my family is?

503
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:05,740
[sighs]

504
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:08,577
I'm not supposed to be out here.
Listen, I've got to get back.

505
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,705
Great, I'm mad to get rid of you.
Close your eyes.

506
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:12,789
What? Why?

507
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:15,709
Don't want you coming
back to my den. It's secret.

508
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:18,503
But I already found it.

509
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,297
Oh, just shut up and walk.

510
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,923
I'll point you back to the town.

511
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,050
No, I need my crossbow back first.

512
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,386
What do you need that for?
Shooting your bird again?

513
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,929
No, shooting...

514
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:30,140
Oh, never mind.

515
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,559
This way, hunter-townie-Robyn-girl.

516
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,816
Hey! Stop pushing so fast.

517
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,485
Oh, will you stop complaining?

518
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,492
[sniffs] Smell that?

519
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:49,951
Ugh, Mebh.

[sniffing]

521
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:54,915
Town tasties.

00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:56,958
"Town tasties"?

523
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:00,962
What? Where's she gone now?

524
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,092
-[man] What did you tell them?
-[gasps]

525
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,594
Just she's going home, isn't she?
'Tis obvious.

526
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:11,181
Ned, say if that wolf bit her, like,
could she turn into one of them?

527
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,099
A wolf?

528
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:15,936
No. One of them half-wolf,
half-witch, half-people?

529
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,772
Wolfwalkers? [chuckles] Will you stop?

530
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:22,025
We are cutting down their woods, Ned.
Shouldn't be doing it.

531
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,111
Save me from that nonsense.

532
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,238
Seán Óg and the soldiers making us.

533
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:30,659
But if old Lord Ironside
doesn't sort out those wolves,

534
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:34,287
it won't just be us
who'll stop taking his orders.

535
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:36,498
-No more orders for me, Ned.
-[gasps]

536
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,708
Those town tasties are mine.

537
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,628
I'm not after that.
I need my crossbow back.

538
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:45,632
Oh. All right.
But those town tasties are mine.

539
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:49,386
-No stuck-up lord in our city again.
-No, we won't, Ned.

540
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,887
Whee!

541
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,514
-What?
-What is it, Ned?

542
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:53,723
Uh, the wind, maybe.

543
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,561
Hey, what did you do with the spuds?

544
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:01,106
The spuds, Ned? Hey, the bread's gone too.

545
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:03,608
No spuds and no bread?

546
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:06,778
-My hat. Give me my hat.
-My bread. Give me that.

547
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,530
Oh! There's someone in there!

548
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:09,614
What the...

549
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:10,991
-[both laughing]
-[Ned] My milk!

550
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,451
Something took my milk!

551
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,746
-[Mebh] Go! Go! Go!
-[both laughing]

552
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,456
[laughing continues]

553
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:18,790
[bell tolls in the distance]

554
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,877
They nearly caught us.

555
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,671
[belches]

556
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,382
Nobody can catch me, townie.

557
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,010
[laughs]

558
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:34,222
How can you stand living in there?
All the smells. Ugh!

559
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,767
It is pretty smelly.

560
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:40,395
I don't like being stuck in there. [sighs]

561
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,022
I miss England.

562
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:44,357
What's an "England"?

563
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:45,692
I used to live there.

564
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:48,862
I could go wherever I wanted,
play with my friends.

565
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:50,238
It was really nice.

566
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,157
Sounds like the forest.

567
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,869
Merlyn and I even used to help Father
hunt for food.

568
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:58,789
Now he wants me to stay in town
all the time.

569
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:01,792
Stay here in the forest. It's great.

570
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,669
-Loads of running.
-Playing.

571
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,671
Eating, messing, climbing.

572
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:08,632
Free.

573
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,012
I can't. I can't leave my father.

574
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:16,973
He has to work for the Lord Protector
and--

575
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:21,186
Mebh, you can't stay in the forest either.
They're cutting it all down.

576
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,438
No way! I'll scare them off.

577
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:26,983
The Lord Protector wants the wolves gone.
Dead! You have to leave.

578
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:30,737
We were leaving. Me, Mammy, with the pack.

579
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:31,822
What stopped you?

580
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,449
-Mammy went off.
-As a wolf?

581
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,327
Yeah, to find us a new place to live.

582
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:43,291
I'm sure it's some huge den
with no stinkers around and loads of food.

583
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:46,878
It's going to be amazing!

584
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:50,382
So then, where is she?
Do you think she got caught?

585
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:53,969
No. She's fine. Nobody can catch my mammy.

586
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:58,849
And anyway, if she was caught by those
stinkers, I'd get my wolves to eat them!

587
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,560
So, you're waiting for her to come back?

588
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:03,186
Yep.

589
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:08,942
It's just her and me in the whole world.

590
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,112
Like me and Father.

591
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,370
But what if they find the den?

592
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:22,831
No, they won't. Nobody has.

593
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:23,915
Well, I did.

594
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:26,460
Yeah. Only 'cause I let you.

595
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:30,338
[pants, laughs]

596
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,214
[both laughing]

597
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,801
[laughing continues]

598
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,348
-[Mebh growls]
-[bleating]

599
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,975
[laughs]

600
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,020
I have to tell my father about you.

601
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:48,106
He didn't know--
We didn't know that Wolfwalkers are real.

602
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:54,780
That you were people. I better get back.

603
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:57,866
Aw. [raspberry]

604
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,285
Look, I'm gonna help you.

605
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:02,037
Wait for me at the big tree tomorrow.

606
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,082
I'll bring you some bread--
I mean, some "town tasties."

607
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:09,044
All right so. Smell you later, townie.
[laughs]

608
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,879
Not if I smell you first.

609
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:13,714
[both laugh]

610
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:39,908
Oh. 'Tis yourself.

611
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:43,745
Mm. So, they didn't eat you? That's great.

612
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:46,331
You were right. That girl healed Merlyn.

613
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:49,209
Didn't she, now? I told you.

614
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,293
I better get back.

615
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:53,964
So, you'll know where to find me anyways
if you're looking for me.

616
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,507
[chuckles]

617
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,384
Father?

618
00:36:58,677 --> 00:36:59,678
Father?

619
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,972
I've got to convince him.

620
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:05,183
Hmm. We need to tidy this place up
before he gets back.

621
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,653
"My, Robyn, this place is sparkling."

622
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,948
Thank you, Father.
Take a seat. Put up your feet.

623
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,159
"Don't mind if I do, lass."

624
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,410
Hard day hunting?

625
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,954
"Aye. Not a sniff of wolf out there."

626
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:30,041
Well, what if I told you
I can get all the wolves to leave

627
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,793
and we don't even have to kill them?

628
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:34,337
"I'd say you're telling tall tales again."

629
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,340
Oh, but I'm not.
Now, promise me you won't get angry.

630
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:38,592
"I promise."

631
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:42,179
You see, I met a girl in the forest
who has magic healing powers.

632
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:43,472
She healed Merlyn.

633
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:44,598
[screeches]

634
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,183
And she's a Wolfwalker.

635
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,018
"A Wolfwalker?"

636
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:51,813
It's true. When she sleeps,
she turns into a wolf.

637
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:53,273
She can talk to the wolves.

638
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:55,358
Her and her mother were
going to take the wolves away,

639
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:58,445
-but her mother went missing.
-"Missing? Poor thing."

640
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:01,031
I know, but if we can
help her find her mother,

641
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,866
then they can
all leave the forest together,

642
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,368
and you will have done your duty
to the Lord Protector.

643
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:08,080
"Oh, brilliant, lass.
Absolutely brilliant.

644
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:09,873
Thank you. Our problems are solved.

645
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:12,042
We can go back to how things used to be."

646
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:17,047
[grunts, sighs]

647
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,091
My girl, come here to me.

648
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:23,261
Are you all right? How are you
after that wolf attack? A bit shaken?

649
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:25,347
No, I'm fine.
Take a seat. Put up your feet.

650
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:28,183
[sighs] That's nice.

651
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,187
And how was your scullery work?
You must be tired, love.

652
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,439
Well, about that.
What if I told you I could--

653
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:38,068
And Merlyn is back.
My, you've had quite the day, lass.

654
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:40,195
Yes, I have. But what if I told you--

655
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:41,613
My day has been awful.

656
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:44,574
Every trap I set this week
has either been broken or sprung.

657
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:46,118
Never seen the like of these wolves.

658
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:49,621
Father, what if I told you
I can get all the wolves to leave

659
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,540
and you don't even have to kill them?

660
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:53,834
Now, promise you won't get angry with me.

661
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:54,918
Go on.

662
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:56,420
You didn't promise.

663
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:58,213
I know. Go on. Tell me.

664
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,467
-You see, I went back to find Merlyn--
-You were out in the woods?

665
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,177
Father, listen. She's one of them.

666
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:06,763
A Wolfwalker,
like the woodcutter said. They're real!

667
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:08,348
-You went back?
-But, Father--

668
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:09,433
You left the scullery?

669
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,810
Well, I didn't actually
get to the scullery.

670
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,104
What? The Lord Protector ordered--

671
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:15,730
-If we can just find her mother and--
-Listen!

672
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,358
You have to follow
the Lord Protector's rules.

673
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:20,777
He gave you a direct order
and you disobeyed him.

674
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,529
Have you no fear of the stocks?

675
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:26,032
We need to work together
to stay in this town, lass.

676
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:27,993
I'll bring you to the scullery
tomorrow myself.

677
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,495
But please,
I thought you would understand.

678
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,456
I-I can help you. If we just--

679
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:37,127
Help me by doing your work
and staying in town, away from danger.

680
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:38,837
Now, promise me.

681
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:41,339
I promise, Father.

682
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,467
All right. Now, go to your bed.

683
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,598
Mother would have listened to me.

684
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,308
[sighs]

685
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,435
She would have wanted you safe, Robyn.

686
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:55,729
Sleep well.

687
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:03,820
We'll find a way to help her, Merlyn.

688
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,030
[screeches]

689
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:10,035
[owl hoots]

690
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,335
[snoring]

691
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:28,261
[panting]

692
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:38,563
[whimpers]

693
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:39,815
[screams]

694
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:44,444
[screeches]

695
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:46,738
-Robyn?
-Father?

696
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:49,658

00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,754
[snoring]

874
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,756
[laughs]

875
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,259
[laughs]

876
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,638
I better go back. I'm scared, Mebh.

877
00:51:37,013 --> 00:51:39,391
Yeah. The town's no place for a wolf.

878
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:42,227
I know. If they don't shoot me,
they'll cage me.

879
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:46,398
[gasps] Mebh, your mother.
Do you think they might've--

880
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:49,651
No! Nobody can catch my mammy.

881
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,363
Sorry. How long has she been gone?

882
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:54,448
Since...

883
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:59,995
She's all right. She'll be back soon.
She promised.

884
00:52:01,037 --> 00:52:04,791
Well, don't worry. Wherever she is,
we'll find her. I can help you.

885
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:06,626
Yeah! There's two of us now.

886
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,462
I'll sneak out
and meet you back here tomorrow.

887
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,298
I'll be waiting for you, again!

888
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:14,760
Mebh, we'll find her.
Then you can all leave and be safe.

889
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:16,970
You promise?

890
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:18,054
I promise.

891
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:30,358

892
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:32,068

[snoring]

894
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:39,409
Hmm.

895
00:52:41,078 --> 00:52:42,079

903
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:29,000
Huh?

904
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:35,132
[screams]

905
00:53:38,301 --> 00:53:39,302

[grunts]

908
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,646
[soldier] Hey, wolf! Get it!

909
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:52,441
Wolf, there! Shoot!

910
00:53:56,194 --> 00:53:57,362
Wolf! Wolf in the town!

911
00:53:57,446 --> 00:53:58,947
-[man 1] Wolf!
-Wolf in the town!

912
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,365
Oh, my God!

00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:02,826
[overlapping shouts]

914
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:07,205
[man 2] Lord Protector won't be happy!

915
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,920
-[man 3] Open it now!
-[soldier] The wolf!

916
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:15,130
[whinnies]

917
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:16,256
-[crowd shouting]
-Wolf.

918
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,301
Get it, now!

919
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,303
-Yes, sir!
-Load your muskets! Surround the beast!

920
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,680
-Kill the wolf!
-Kill the wolf!

921
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:25,348
[woman] Kill it! Kill the beast!

922
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,225
Fire!

923
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:29,770
[gunshots]

924
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,354
[man] Get rid of that wolf!

925
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:34,775
Goodfellowe, what is this?

926
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:36,902
[crowd clamoring]

927
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:42,157
Enough! I will deal with this wolf myself.
Now, back to your beds.

928
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:45,285
[gunshots]

929
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:51,500
-[soldier 3] Do you see it?
-[soldier 2] Where'd it go?

930
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,168
[soldier 3] Keep looking.
It's here somewhere.

931
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:56,588

932
00:54:57,798 --> 00:54:59,299

[gasps]

936
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:10,727
That scent.

937
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,813
-I knew it! [gasps]
-[soldier 1] Wolf in the castle!

938
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,064
-Do you see it?
-[grunts]

939
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:16,149
[soldier 2] Search every corner.

940
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:18,235
[soldier 1] Don't let it get away!

941
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:19,986

942
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,279
-[woman] Girl.
-[gasps]

943
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:24,825
Girl.

944
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,369
Girl, here. Quick.

945
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:43,176
H-hello?

946
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:47,639
Only a Wolfwalker can make another.
When did it happen to you? Where?

947
00:55:47,722 --> 00:55:50,142
Is the wolf that bit you near?
Is she all right?

948
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:52,352
Is she alive? Where is Mebh?

949
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:54,604
[exhales]

950
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:57,774
You're Mebh's mother.
Oh, wait till I tell her I found you.

951
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:00,444
She'll be so happy.
She's waiting for you in the forest.

952
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,779
You mean she's still here? In the woods?

953
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:05,240
No, no, no! She must go!

954
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:07,617
But we have to rescue you.
How do I get you out?

955
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,287
[soldier] Wolf! Wolf in the castle!

956
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,164
You'll be killed like this.

957
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,249
Listen, girl, get back
to your human body right away.

958
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:15,542
If I can just get the lo--

959
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,711
She should never have bitten you.

960
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:21,006
Get Mebh and leave.
It's not safe for our kind here.

961
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:23,884
-But Mebh won't leave without you.
-She must not come for me.

962
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:27,137
She must not wait for me.
She must run. And you too, girl.

963
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,221
Now!

964
00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:34,853
[crowd shouting in distance]

965
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:42,778
[shouting continues]

966
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:49,034
[shouting]

967
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:54,164
Lord, what must I do?

968
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:57,292
I left to quell rebellion
and returned to more.

969
00:56:57,876 --> 00:57:01,046
This wild land must be civilized.

970
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:03,298
That is Your will.

971
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:10,680
So, wolf,

972
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,850
tomorrow I will show them
I have tamed you,

973
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:16,561
just as I will tame this land.

974
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:22,025
They will have nothing to fear
if they trust in the Lord's will.

975
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,361
-[gasps] What the--
-[woman] Go!

976
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,907
Tell Mebh to lead the pack to safety.

977
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,450
Go! Now!

978
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:32,035

[footsteps approaching]

984
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:01,106
[Robyn panting]

985
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:06,695
[door closes]

986
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:10,490
How do I do this? Um... Uh...
Come on, come on.

987
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:16,121
Come on.

988
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,917
-[gasps]
-Robyn, are you awake?

989
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:23,420
-What, Father?
-There was a wolf here in our chambers.

990
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:25,839
Got in while you were sleeping.
It could have taken you.

991
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:26,923
Father, I was--

992
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,509
This world is such a dangerous
place for you, lass.

993
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,721
-I promised I would keep you safe.
-But that--

994
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:33,930
-[knocks]
-Hmm?

995
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:35,766
[knocks]

996
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:38,351
-Come with us.
-Lord Protector wants a word with you.

997
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:40,187
-[crowd shouting]
-[soldier] Back, I say!

998
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,231
[woman]
Ironsides! What are you doing about it?

999
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,692
[shouting continues]

1000
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:49,237
Goodfellowe.
A wolf here, threatening the town.

1001
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:52,616
It got inside the castle
in my very chambers.

1002
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:54,534
-This is intolerable.
-Sir, I--

1003
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:57,204
Enough! You have failed.
You are no hunter.

1004
00:58:57,287 --> 00:59:00,540
From now on, you will serve in my ranks
as a foot soldier.

1005
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:03,418
[shouting continues]

1006
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:07,547
-Townspeople! Order, please! Order! Order!
-[soldier] Silence.

1007
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:10,050
Tomorrow, I will show you all.

1008
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:14,721
I will tame this land.
I will find that den.

1009
00:59:14,805 --> 00:59:17,641
Every last wolf will be destroyed.

1010
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,351
No! Stop!

1011
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:20,519
There is another way!

1012
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:22,854
Release her, the Wolfwalker.

1013
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:25,107
-[all gasping]
-Wha--

1014
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,692
Please! You must listen!

1015
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:29,653
Take her to the stocks.

1016
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:31,113
-No! Sir, please!
-Stop that!

1017
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:33,448
She's just a child.
And I know these woods.

1018
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:35,700
-I can still help you on your mission.
-Silence!

1019
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:41,123
It's safe now! Go to your beds!

1020
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:44,626
Tomorrow, I will make good on my word.

1021
00:59:44,709 --> 00:59:46,002
Guards! Guards!

1022
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:49,381
-[guard 1] Move it! Move along, now!
-[guard 2] Get out of here!

1023
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:53,135
Goodfellowe,
I will give you both one more chance.

1024
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:55,637
Follow your orders
or you'll be off to war.

1025
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,721
Yes, my lord.

1026
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:58,348
And, girl, come here.

1027
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:02,853
Never speak of such pagan nonsense
in this town.

1028
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:07,482
Follow the rules or you will never see
your father again. Do you understand?

1029
01:00:08,024 --> 01:00:09,443
Y-yes, my lord.

1030
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:12,362
Double the guard. Bar the gate.

1031
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:15,323
No more wolves inside these walls.

1032
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:17,117
[soldier] Yes, sir. On the double!

1033
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:27,377
Listen to me. We must follow our orders
if we are to stay together.

1034
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:30,464
You must do as you're told, my girl.

1035
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:32,340
[sighs]

1036
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:43,185
[cries]

1037
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,288

[gasps, pants]

1043
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:47,999
[Mebh] Made a new friend, Mammy.
A townie, but a nice one.

1044
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:49,793
Her name is Robyn.

1045
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:52,671
She's taller than me, but I'm stronger.

1046
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:55,799
And she brushed my hair
and gave me this flower.

Do not fear wild girls and wolves

1231
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:51,079
because tonight we put an end to this.

1232
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:55,000
I will burn this forest to the ground.

1233
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:58,420
I will lead cannons
to the den of these beasts

1234

-and send them all to hell.
-No!

1235

Goodfellowe, what have you become?
You can't even catch a little girl?

1240
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:18,440
Prove yourself a worthy soldier tonight

-or tomorrow you are in chains.
-[gasps]

1242
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:23,487
Now, put an end to that wild beast.

1243
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:26,156
What cannot be tamed must be destroyed.

1244
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,533
No, please. You can't.

1245

Robyn! Stop this.

1246
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:35,707

Robyn, what are you doing, girl?

1263
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:46,903
The Lord Protector will have us in chains.

1264
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:50,532
He's wrong, Father. All this is wrong.
Don't you see that?

1265
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:53,326
Robyn, step aside.
We must do what we're told.

1266
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:55,078
Why, Father? Why?

1267
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:56,288
I'm afraid.

1268
01:14:57,873 --> 01:14:59,082
I'm afraid.

1269

Father?

1270
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:04,045
I won't be here to protect you forever.

1271
01:15:04,129 --> 01:15:07,591
I'm so afraid that one day
you will end up in a cage.

1272
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:11,303
But I already am in a cage.

1273
