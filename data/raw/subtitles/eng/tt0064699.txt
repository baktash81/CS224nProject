1
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,353
HURRY UP.

2
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,287
COME ON.

3
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,347
DID YOU BRING YOUR
DRIVING LICENSE
WITH YOU?

4
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,216
WHAT FOR?

5
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,817
WELL, IF YOU FLY
THIS THING ANY LOWER,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

6
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,872
HUNT MASTER
TO HOUNDS. THIS IS
LEVEL AT ANGEL 6.

7
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:06,873
 ROGER.

8
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:07,807
 ROGER.

9
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,741
 ROGER.

10
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:29,929
TARGET AT
10:00, SIR.

11
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,733
I SEE IT, TOMMY.

12
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,568
LOOK AT
THOSE BASTARDS.

13
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,404
3 V-1s READY
TO TAKE OFF.

14
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,240
GOING OUT TO FLATTEN
ANOTHER SQUARE MILE
OF LONDON.

15
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,576
WE'RE NOT STOPPING
ENOUGH OF THEM,
ARE WE, SIR?

16
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,712
NO, WE'RE JUST
THINNING THEM OUT
A LITTLE, WILEY.

17
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,349
HUNT MASTER TO HOUNDS.
TARGET IDENTIFIED.

18
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,752
<i>ATTACK INTERVALS</i>
<i>OF 15 SECONDS.</i>

19
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,487
<i>BOMBS AWAY AT</i>
<i>1,000 FEET.</i>

20
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,289
HERE WE GO.

21
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,644
STAND BY.

22
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,698
BOMBS AWAY, SIR.

23
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,240
STAND BY WITH THE
FLY SWATTER, WILEY.

24
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,374
SIR.

25
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:56,883
<i>BOMBS AWAY.</i>

26
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,024
<i>BOMBS AWAY!</i>

27
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:09,862
BOMBS AWAY.

28
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,519
HUNT MASTER TO HOUNDS.
LET'S GO HOME.

29
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,454
<i>ROGER, SCOTTY.</i>

30
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,722
<i>ROGER, SCOTTY.</i>

31
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,762
BANDITS, BANDITS,
7:00.

32
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,667
HUNT MASTER TO HOUNDS.
BREAK, BREAK, BREAK!

33
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,452
BANNISTER, CLARK, GET
THAT BASTARD OFF SCOTTY.
MY FIRE CONTROL'S JAMMED.

34
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,029
HE'S COPPED IT, QUINT.

35
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,640
<i>QUINT, LET'S GET</i>
<i>OUT OF HERE.</i>

36
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,115
QUINT, THEY'RE CLIMBING
FOR ANOTHER PASS AT US.

37
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,722
<i>DOG ONE, YOU'RE</i>
<i>LEADER NOW, QUINT.</i>

38
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,760
<i>DOG ONE, DO YOU</i>
<i>READ ME, DOG ONE?</i>

39
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,961
SIR, THEY'RE
CALLING YOU.

40
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,231
ARE YOU ALL
RIGHT, SIR?

41
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,935
DOG ONE TO HOUNDS.

42
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,337
FOLLOW ME. WE'RE GOING
OUT LOW AND FAST.

43
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,844
STAND EASY.

44
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,714
THE STRIKE REPORT
YOU RADIOED AHEAD WAS
RELAYED TO COMMAND.

45
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,049
YOU'LL NO DOUBT
BE PLEASED WITH
THE SIGNAL

46
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,185
I'VE JUST RECEIVED
FROM THE AIR MARSHAL.

47
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,187
"PLEASE CONVEY MY
PERSONAL REGARDS

48
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,757
"TO FLYING OFFICERS
AND MEN OF 641 SQUADRON.
WELL DONE."

49
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,028
WE DIDN'T EVEN
MAKE A DENT.

50
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,964
WELL, THEIR LAUNCHING
SITES ARE ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT

51
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,700
UNTIL THEY GO
INTO OPERATION,
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU,

52
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,903
THAT COMMAND IS
GIVING THE V-1 PROBLEM
THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.

53
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:39,905
YES, SIR.

54
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,742
WELL, THAT'S ALL.

55
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,917
I'M SORRY ABOUT
SQUADRON LEADER SCOTT.
WHAT HAPPENED?

56
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,888
A FLIGHT OF
MESSERSCHMITTS
JUMPED US.

57
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,656
HE WAS HIT BEFORE
HE COULD MANEUVER.

58
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,392
WENT DOWN IN FLAMES.

59
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,660
NO PARACHUTES?

60
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,428
NO, SIR.

61
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,898
WHAT DOES ONE SAY?
YOU WERE CLOSE,
WEREN'T YOU?

62
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,900
WE WERE BROUGHT
UP TOGETHER.

63
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,435
 REALLY?

64
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,070
WERE THERE FAMILY
CONNECTIONS?

65
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,674
NO, MY MOTHER AND FATHER
WERE KILLED SOME TIME AGO.

66
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:18,077
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF
SQUADRON LEADER SCOTT'S
PARENTS AS MY OWN.

67
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,579
 I SEE.

68
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,749
WELL, I SUPPOSE I'D
BETTER GO AND TELL THEM.

69
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,751
IT'S A HATEFUL
BUSINESS.

70
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,953
I CAN NEVER
FIND THE WORDS.

71
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,655
WHAT ABOUT
HIS WIFE?

72
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,792
WOULD YOU,
I--I--I MEAN...

73
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,662
ALL RIGHT.

74
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,992
HELLO, QUINT.

75
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,929
HI, QUINT.

76
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,699
HELLO, QUINT.

77
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,466
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO MY SISTER?

78
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,434
I DIDN'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

79
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,071
SCOTTY?

80
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,480
YOU STILL AT
THE HOSPITAL?

81
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,081
YES, CONVALESCENT.

82
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,651
I BROUGHT THIS CROWD OVER.
I WISH TO GOD I HADN'T.

83
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,052
WHEN DO YOU
RETURN TO DUTY?

84
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,421
DUTY? WHAT DUTY?

85
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,390
PLYING A DESK
ONE-HANDED?

86
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,493
IF THAT'S ALL YOU
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE.

87
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,895
WELL, THEY'VE
OFFERED ME A HOOK.

88
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,331
MAKES A MARVELOUS
BACKSCRATCHER,
SO I'M TOLD.

89
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,201
WELL, I'M SURE
SCOTTY WOULD SETTLE
FOR IT RIGHT NOW.

90
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,158
HE'S DEAD.

91
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,564
DID YOU SEE IT?

92
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:27,800
YES.

93
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,836
NO PARACHUTES?

94
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,473
THERE WASN'T TIME.

95
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,475
 DID...

96
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,179
DID IT BURN?

97
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,816
IT BLEW UP WHEN
IT HIT THE GROUND.

98
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,455
BETH.

99
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,856
LEAVE ME ALONE.

100
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,027
PLEASE.

101
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,458
â™ª

102
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,399
HOW DID SHE
TAKE IT?

103
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,671
DO YOU THINK I
SHOULD GO TO HER?

104
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,240
NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GO TO HER.
JUST LET HER CRY.

105
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,849
YOU'RE A HARD-NOSED
BASTARD, QUINT.

106
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,052
SCOTTY WAS PRACTICALLY
YOUR BROTHER.

107
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,056
THAT'S RIGHT,
DOUGLAS.

108
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,058
SCOTTY WAS PRACTICALLY
MY BROTHER.

109
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,401
AH, MUNROE,

110
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,705
MEET MAJ. KEMBLE,
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.

111
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,073
MAJOR'S GOT
A LITTLE JOB.

112
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,874
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE MAN FOR IT.

113
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,876
HOW DO YOU DO? SIR.

114
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,412
NOTHING VERY
EXCITING, I'M AFRAID.

115
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,747
MILK RUN, REALLY.

116
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,249
WANT TO GO OVER.

117
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,584
TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS PLACE.

118
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,320
CHATEAU
DE CHARLON.

119
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,388
VERY PRETTY.

120
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,889
YES.

121
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,958
WHAT WE'RE
INTERESTED IN
IS THE, UH,

122
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,096
UNDERSKIRTS.

123
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,265
YOU'VE BEEN BRIEFED
ON THE V-2 ROCKETS THAT
ARE JUST STARTING TO HIT US?

124
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,768
YES, SIR.

125
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,237
WELL, INTELLIGENCE HAS IT
THAT THERE'S A V-3, EVEN A
V-4 IN DEVELOPMENT.

126
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,741
LARGER, MORE PUNCH,
MORE IMPORTANT,
LONGER RANGE.

127
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,777
WE THINK THE DEVELOPMENT
WORK IS BEING DONE HERE
AT CHATEAU DE CHARLON.

128
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,912
THAT'S WHY, I WANT
TO TAKE A LOOK.

129
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,014
THE MAJOR WILL BE
FLYING WITH YOU.

130
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,751
I UNDERSTOOD I HAD A
FEW HOURS OFF BASE, SIR?

131
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,086
WELL, THE WEATHER'S
CLOSED IN OVER FRANCE.

132
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,789
IT WOULD TAKE SOME HOURS
TO FIT THE CAMERAS
TO YOUR AIRCRAFT.

133
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,457
24 HOURS BE
ENOUGH FOR YOU?

134
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,126
OH, YES, SIR.

135
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,795
I'M GOING TO SEE MY,
UH, SQUADRON LEADER
SCOTT'S PARENTS.

136
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,449
WHAT TIME
IS IT?

137
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,285
HALF PAST 4:00.

138
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,821
THEY'LL JUST
BE HAVING TEA
ON THE TERRACE.

139
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,757
COME ON.

140
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,666
WALK WITH ME
QUINT, WILL YOU?

141
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,674
WE WERE PULLING OUT,

142
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,143
YOU KNOW,
READY TO GO HOME,

143
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,145
WHEN A FLIGHT OF
MESSERSCHMITTS
JUMPED US.

144
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,147
I THINK THEY
CAME OUT OF THE SUN.

145
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,850
IT WAS SO QUICK,
SCOTTY DIDN'T HAVE
TIME TO MANEUVER.

146
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,020
HE JUST APPEARED TO
GO STRAIGHT DOWN, INTO
THE GROUND. THERE WAS...

147
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,489
HE HAD NO TIME,
NO TIME AT ALL,
TO PULL OUT.

148
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,858
I'M SURE THAT, AH,
IT WAS INSTANTANEOUS.

149
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,033
WHEN YOUR PARENTS DIED,
AND YOU CAME TO LIVE WITH US,

150
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,101
MOTHER AND I ALWAYS
ADMIRED YOUR SPIRIT,

151
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,137
THE WAY YOU
HANDLED YOUR GRIEF,

152
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,775
AND,

153
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,344
WENT ON WITH
YOUR LIFE.

154
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,447
THAT'S WHAT
THEY WOULD HAVE
WANTED ME TO DO.

155
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,381
I, UM...

156
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,052
I ONLY HOPE WE CAN
DO AS WELL, QUINT.

157
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,058
YOU'LL BE LEADING
THE SQUADRON NOW?

158
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,059
YES.

159
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,694
GOOD.

160
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,662
MOTHER AND I WILL
BE PROUD OF YOU.

161
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,252
THERE'S CHARLON.

162
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,057
HOW CLOSE DO
YOU WANT TO GO?

163
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,560
PART THEIR HAIR,
SQUADRON LEADER.

164
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,691
NOISY LOT,
WEREN'T THEY?

165
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,094
THAT'S A LOT
OF FLAK FOR
ONE CHATEAU.

166
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,964
THEY MUST HAVE SOMETHING
THEY DON'T WANT SEEN.

167
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,466
WHICH IS A GOOD REASON
FOR US TO HAVE TO
GO IN AGAIN.

168
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,943
HOW CLOSE DO YOU
WANT TO GO THIS TIME?

169
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,644
KNOCK THEIR
BLOODY HEADS OFF.

170
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,833
YOU HAD ENOUGH YET?

171
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,638
YOU OK, MAJOR?

172
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,839
LET'S GO HOME.

173
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,703
MORE TROUBLE,
I'M AFRAID.

174
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,505
I THINK THEY GOT
THE HYDRAULICS.

175
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,540
IT OUGHT TO BE
A BUMPY LANDING.

176
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,208
MAJOR!

177
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:50,942
 MAJOR!

178
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,938
COME ON, SMARTLY NOW.

179
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,507
KEMBLE?

180
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,276
HE'S IN THERE.

181
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,744
SMASH THE COCKPIT.

182
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,379
SMASH THE COCKPIT.

183
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,819
I JUST HOPE THOSE BLOODY
PICTURES ARE WORTH IT.

184
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,972
AWAY YOU GO.

185
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,822
THAT'S THE SQUADRON
LEADER'S READY ROOM.
THROUGH THERE, MA'AM.

186
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,223
I--I'LL
WAIT OUTSIDE.

187
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,028
THANK YOU.

188
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:45,750
OH, IT'S YOU.

189
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,753
I...

190
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,455
I CAME FOR
SCOTTY'S THINGS.

191
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,093
OH, I--I WAS GONNA
BRING THEM OVER.

192
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,263
I'M SORRY, BUT I
JUST WANTED TO
SEE THIS PLACE.

193
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,233
I FORGOT THAT YOU--

194
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,602
OH, NO, NO. THAT'S,
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

195
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,245
I, UM...

196
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,081
I SAW SCOTTY'S BATMAN
ON THE WAY OVER.

197
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,783
HE WAS GOING TO FETCH
A UNIFORM OF SCOTTY'S.

198
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,787
IT WAS AT THE CLEANERS.

199
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,424
HOW'S DOUGLAS?

200
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,260
OH, HE'S GONE BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL

201
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,862
TO GET ONE OF THOSE
ARTIFICIAL HANDS FITTED.

202
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,098
HE SAID YOU
CONVINCED HIM.

203
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,099
I DID?

204
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:35,300
YOU JOLTED HIM, QUINT.

205
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,534
OH.

206
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,636
THAT'S WHAT HE NEEDED.

207
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,670
YES.

208
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,841
YOU LOOK TIRED.

209
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,144
HAVE YOU BEEN FLYING?

210
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,313
YES, JUST ROUTINE.

211
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,282
IT WAS A MILK
RUN, REALLY.

212
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,384
I SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN BETTER,
YOU'RE RESTING.

213
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,785
I'LL COME BACK WHEN--

214
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,287
NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

215
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,689
THERE'S, UH,
SOME MORE STUFF
IN THERE.

216
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,901
SCOTTY CALLED THIS ROOM
HIS CONFESSIONAL.

217
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,337
A PLACE WHERE HE
FACED UP TO HIMSELF.

218
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,976
HE ENVIED YOU, QUINT.

219
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,245
HE ENVIED ME?

220
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,047
WELL, HE HAD
ALL THE BRAIN.

221
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,318
I CRIBBED OFF HIM ALL
THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL.

222
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,186
HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THAT.

223
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,822
AND ABOUT THE GIRLS
YOU PASSED ON TO HIM.

224
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,424
WELL, I DIDN'T
PASS EXACTLY.

225
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,892
AH, HE,
HE TOOK THEM.

226
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,695
ME, TOO?

227
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,201
I PUT THE REST OF
HIS THINGS IN HERE.

228
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,876
OH, SORRY.

229
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,553
NO, NO. THAT'S--
THAT'S MINE.

230
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,556
 BURNT?

231
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,524
OH, NO, QUINT,
NOT YOU, TOO.

232
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,361
YES?

233
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,729
VESEY, SIR.

234
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,063
OH, UH...

235
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,000
YES. VESEY,
UH, COME IN.

236
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,905
OH, THE, UH, SQUADRON
LEADER'S UNIFORM, SIR.
MRS. SCOTT ASKED ME TO...

237
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,921
I'LL GET DRESSED
AND--AND DRIVE
YOU HOME.

238
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,240
HOW MANY MILES DOES
IT DO TO THE GALLON?

239
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,241
NOT MANY.

240
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,776
WHY DON'T YOU
SELL HER?

241
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,611
SHH. SHE'LL
HEAR YOU.

242
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,613
SHE'S A TEMPERAMENTAL
OLD BITCH AS IT IS.

243
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,581
I'M SORRY.

244
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,017
IT'S JUST THAT MESS
LIFE COARSENS THE
VOCABULARY SOMEWHAT.

245
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,286
I KNOW. IT PLAYED
HAVOC WITH SCOTTY'S.

246
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,126
YOU KNOW WHAT
I REGRET MOST?

247
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,097
NOT KNOWING
WHAT SORT OF FATHER
HE'D HAVE MADE.

248
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,733
I'D LOVE TO HAVE SEEN
HIM WITH HIS CHILDREN.

249
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,970
WE'D EVEN
PICKED THE NAMES.

250
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,043
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED OR ANYTHING
YOU WANT,

251
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,445
YOU WILL CALL
ME, WON'T YOU?

252
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,113
YES.

253
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,615
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

254
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,684
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE SO FORMAL.

255
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,987
I'M SORRY.

256
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,757
IT'S--IT'S JUST
THAT I...

257
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,562
WELL, I FEEL
SORT OF EMBARRASSED.

258
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:54,332
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE EVER REALLY
BEEN ALONE TOGETHER.

259
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,402
WELL, WHEN SCOTTY WAS
WITH US, WE WERE ALL PART
OF THE SAME FAMILY.

260
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,205
NOW, IT--IT DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT SOMEHOW.

261
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,207
YOU FEEL GUILTY.

262
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,642
OH, QUINT.

263
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,245
THAT'S VERY
REVEALING.

264
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,647
YES, IT IS,
ISN'T IT?
I'M SORRY.

265
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,850
DON'T KEEP
APOLOGIZING.
I UNDERSTAND.

266
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,018
YOU DO?

267
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,988
 YES.

268
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,990
THE DAY
SCOTTY JOINED
THE SQUADRON,

269
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,326
HIS OLD NAVIGATOR
MARRIED A GIRL

270
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,429
JUST 2 WEEKS
AFTER HER FIRST
HUSBAND WAS KILLED.

271
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,831
HE WAS A PILOT.

272
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,535
I REMEMBER BEING
ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED.

273
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,437
4 DAYS AFTER
THE WEDDING,

274
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,705
HE GOT SHOT DOWN.

275
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,708
THEN I UNDERSTOOD.

276
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,711
TIME IS
SO PRECIOUS.

277
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:45,550
IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY
THING THEY DON'T GIVE
US RATION COUPONS FOR.

278
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,202
AH, AIR
COMMODORE HUFFORD,

279
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,704
THIS IS SQUADRON
LEADER MUNROE
FLIGHT LIEUTENANT--

280
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,374
YOU FLEW KEMBLE
OVER CHARLON,
DIDN'T YOU, MUNROE?

281
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,909
YES, SIR.
THAT'S CORRECT.

282
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,644
GOOD MAN,
WAS KEMBLE.

283
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,246
HE'D HAVE BEEN DECORATED
FOR THE RESULTS HE GOT.
EXCELLENT!

284
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,748
COME AND HAVE
A LOOK AT THIS.

285
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,718
WE MADE THIS MODEL
FROM KEMBLE'S PHOTOGRAPHS.

286
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,487
HOLD THOSE A MINUTE,
WOULD YOU, MASON?

287
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,888
NOW,

288
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,089
WHAT DO YOU
SUPPOSE THAT IS?

289
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,226
IT LOOKS LIKE
A TUNNEL, SIR.

290
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,727
OF COURSE
IT'S A TUNNEL.

291
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,663
WE KNOW MORE ABOUT
IT THAN THAT.

292
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,565
DOWN THERE...

293
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,900
THAT'S WHERE
THEY'RE HATCHING
THEIR NEW BIRD.

294
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,002
WHAT WE WANT YOU
TO DO, MUNROE,

295
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,437
IS TO CHUCK A
BOMB IN THERE

296
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,772
AND ADDLE THEIR
EGGS FOR THEM.

297
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,441
IN THERE?

298
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,947
COMMAND PLANS A LOW-LEVEL,
SATURATION-BOMB MISSION

299
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,616
BY AT LEAST 2 SQUADRONS
OF MOSQUITOES.

300
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:56,087
NOW YOU'D LEAD A
SPECIALLY TRAINED FLIGHT
FOR THIS SPECIALIST TASK.

301
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,123
SPECIALIST TASK? I WOULD
SAY IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE
TO PUT A BOMB IN THERE.

302
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,592
NONSENSE.

303
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,594
BLINDS DOWN,
MASON.

304
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,395
WE'LL RUN
THAT FILM AGAIN.

305
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,932
THIS IS TOP-SECRET
FILM, MUNROE.

306
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,534
WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO SEE

307
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,203
IS A DEVELOPMENT
OF BARNES WALLIS.

308
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,472
THE HYDRAULICS START
THE BOMB SPINNING.

309
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,108
BUT HERE'S THE JOKER.

310
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,010
THIS BOMB BOUNCES
ON LAND.

311
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,451
IN A STRAIGHT LINE?

312
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:27,952
YES.

313
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,487
REGARDLESS
OF TERRAIN.

314
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,466
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

315
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,868
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL,
I'VE RUN THIS PRINT
A THOUSAND TIMES.

316
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,805
THE CIVILIAN
SCIENTISTS
HAVE IRONED

317
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,807
MOST OF THE
WRINKLES OUT
FOR YOU.

318
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:54,812
YOUR JOB WILL BE TO
PERFECT THE TECHNIQUE
UNDER COMBAT CONDITIONS.

319
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,382
WELL, I THINK
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH.
THANK YOU, MASON.

320
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,817
THERE YOU ARE, THEN.

321
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,819
BARNES WALLIS,
GOD BLESS HIM,

322
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,921
HAS DONE YOUR JOB
FOR YOU, PRACTICALLY.

323
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,491
YOUR BOMBS WOULD
HAVE A TIME FUSE.

324
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,993
NOW IF YOU WENT IN
AT EXACTLY 60 FEET.

325
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,663
 SI--

326
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,831
WHY, IT'D TAKE
MONTHS TO GET
THAT ACCURATE.

327
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,767
WELL YOU HAVE 10
DAYS TO PRACTICE.

328
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,503
AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHY JUST 10 DAYS.

329
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:22,507
THE FRENCH UNDERGROUND
REPORTS THE FIRST OF
THE GERMANS' NEW WEAPONS

330
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,175
WILL BE READY
IN 12 DAYS.

331
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,010
YOU'LL HAVE
SPECIAL BOMBSIGHTS

332
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,512
AND DUMMY BOMBS
TO WORK WITH.

333
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,214
THEY'RE BUILDING
A REPLICA OF THE
CHARLON TUNNEL RIGHT NOW.

334
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,717
ANY JUSTICE IN THE WORLD,
YOU'LL BE A NATIONAL HERO.

335
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,686
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
MUNROE, HMM?

336
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,854
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

337
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,956
ABOUT THE SAME
AS SPITTING IN AN
AIR COMMODORE'S EYE

338
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,725
FROM AN EXPRESS
TRAIN, SIR.

339
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,028
I LIKE THAT.

340
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,964
YES, I DO LIKE THAT.
SENSE OF HUMOR.

341
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,901
HE'LL DO NICELY,
WING COMMANDER.
JUST THE MAN.

342
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,538
NOW, GET YOUR
TEAM TOGETHER
AND PRACTICE.

343
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,908
STOP THAT ROCKET FLYING,
AND YOU'LL TAKE YEARS
OFF THE WAR.

344
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,977
REMEMBER THAT. YEARS.

345
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,680
YOU'VE GOT 10 DAYS
TO CHUCK YOUR BOMB
DOWN THAT TUNNEL.

346
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,284
ALL RIGHT.

347
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,263
AIR SCOOP OUT.

348
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:24,802
AIR SCOOP OUT, SIR.

349
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,506
R.P.M.?

350
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,607
800.

351
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,722
STAND BY.
STEADY.

352
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,225
STEADY.

353
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,161
BOMB AWAY.

354
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,269
MISSED!

355
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,471
<i>BANNISTER, YOU CHANGE</i>
<i>YOUR ANGLE OF APPROACH.</i>

356
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,873
<i>60 FEET.</i>

357
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,608
<i>DROP FROM 60</i>
<i>FEET, BANNISTER.</i>

358
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,809
ROGER.

359
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,648
STAND BY.

360
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,084
STEADY.

361
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,688
BOMB AWAY!

362
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,198
BOMB AWAY!

363
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,968
THAT'S WIDE.
TOO WIDE.

364
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,637
CORRECT YOUR
ANGLE OF ATTACK.

365
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,839
I THOUGHT I WAS
RIGHT ON THE
MONEY, SKIPPER.

366
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,176
STEADY.

367
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,179
BOMB AWAY.

368
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,918
BANNISTER, WHAT WAS
YOUR RANGE THAT TIME?

369
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,320
1,100, RIGHT
ON 60 FEET.

370
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,721
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
TRY THE SAME NUMBERS.

371
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,036
BOMB AWAY.

372
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,376
MISSED.

373
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,546
â™ª

374
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,429
AH, SQUADRON LEADER, NOW.
MY CONGRATULATIONS, SIR.

375
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,099
YOUR USUAL TABLE, SIR.

376
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,934
THIS WAY, IF
YOU PLEASE.

377
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,270
WE HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU ALL IN SO LONG.

378
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,405
I THOUGHT YOU'D FOUND
SOME OTHER PLACE,

379
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,574
WITH BETTER MARKET
CONTACTS THAN WE HAVE.

380
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,242
THAT'S NOT
POSSIBLE, AND
YOU KNOW IT.

381
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,610
WE TRY TO DO
OUR BEST, SIR.

382
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,680
ESPECIALLY FOR OUR
SERVICE CLIENTELE.

383
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,249
IS SQUADRON LEADER
SCOTT JOINING YOU?

384
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,317
 NO.

385
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,922
WHAT'S NOT
ON THE MENU
TONIGHT, VICTOR?

386
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,690
CHICKEN. ROASTED?

387
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:33,758
TO PERFECTION.

388
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,959
THEN CHICKEN IT IS.

389
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,294
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

390
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,972
SCOTTY NEVER DID
LIKE CHICKEN, ANYWAY.

391
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,579
I THINK THE WAITER
THINKS WE'RE
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

392
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,956
ARE YOU EVER
AFRAID, QUINT?

393
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,858
SCOTTY USED TO
BE SICK WITH FEAR
BEFORE EVERY FLIGHT.

394
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,894
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

395
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:10,761
YES.

396
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,801
FUNNY THING, THOUGH.
WHEN YOU'RE--WHEN YOU'RE
FLYING, YOU'RE FREE.

397
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,337
YOU'RE TRAINED
TO HANDLE EVERY
EMERGENCY.

398
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,974
YOU'RE PREPARED
FOR EACH EVENTUALITY.

399
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,709
IT'S A PATTERN THAT
YOU CAN REACT TO.

400
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,979
DOWN HERE, THE
CONFUSION STARTS.

401
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,180
AHA!

402
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,148
AVAST THERE,
YE LAND LUBBERS.

403
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,683
YOU'LL WALK THE
PLANK FOR THIS,
I PROMISE YOU.

404
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,352
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
BIT CLUMSY AT FIRST.

405
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,320
NO, YOU'LL ADJUST.

406
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,488
ADJUST, I HAVE.
TRANSFORMED. I REPORT
FOR DUTY TOMORROW.

407
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,357
WHERE?

408
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,491
QUINT'S GROUP,
IN CHARGE OF
LINK TRAINING.

409
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:41,993
OH, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
WHEN DID YOU APPLY?

410
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,195
APPLY? DEAR BOY,
THEY ASKED FOR ME.

411
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,197
"LEND A HAND,"
I THINK THE
PHRASE WAS.

412
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,265
OH, I FORGOT. SUSAN.

413
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,833
HELLO.

414
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,835
SHE'S A NURSE.
SHE RATHER LIKES
THE IRONMONGERY.

415
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,003
SHE'S GOT
AN ITCHY BACK.

416
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,170
DOUGLAS, STOP IT.

417
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,006
WOULD YOU CARE
TO JOIN US?

418
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,842
NO, I'M NOT HAVING
BETH TELL THE SECRETS
OF THE NURSERY.

419
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,511
NOT YET, ANYWAY.
BESIDES, WE'LL
RUIN YOUR EVENING.

420
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,847
WELL, CHEERIO.
SHARK MEAT,
THE PAIR OF YOU.

421
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,515
OH, DOUG.

422
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,718
WHEN DOUG BOUNCES BACK,
HE REALLY BOUNCES.

423
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,887
YOU SUGGESTED HIM FOR
THAT LINK TRAINING JOB.
WELL, I--

424
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,389
I'M VERY
GRATEFUL, QUINT

425
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,891
FOR SO MUCH.

426
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,331
 FOOD!

427
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,237
MMM, LOOKS DELICIOUS.

428
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,763
OK, THAT'S
ENOUGH ROUGH AIR.
BRING HIM IN.

429
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,298
LOCKS IN, PLEASE.

430
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,904
DO YOU FEEL A LITTLE
GOD-LIKE CONTROLLING
THE WEATHER?

431
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:00,938
QUINT!

432
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,606
HOW'S THE JOB GOING?

433
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,909
APART FROM BEING
RATED NEXT TO
THE DENTIST

434
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,844
ON THE FLIERS'
PET HATE LIST, OK.

435
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,079
UM,

436
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,081
TESTS AND REACTION
TESTS ON YOUR MEN.

437
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,949
THANKS. WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT TEMPLETON?

438
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,684
REACTIONS SLOW
AND ILL-TIMED.

439
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,586
BORDERLINE.
YOUR DECISION.

440
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,289
HMM, HE SEEMS ALL RIGHT
IN THE AIR. MAYBE
IT'S EXAM NERVES.

441
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,691
WELL, AS I SAID,
YOUR DECISION.

442
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,860
BUT YOU ARE DOING
A PRECISION JOB.

443
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,296
YOU MAY BE DOING
HIM A FAVOR IF YOU
GIVE HIM A REST.

444
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,198
YES, BUT I WONDER
HOW MUCH OF A
FAVOR IT'D BE.

445
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,432
OH, PUT HIM
THROUGH AGAIN.

446
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,134
RIGHT.

447
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,302
HOW'S SUSAN?

448
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,970
WE'RE GETTING ENGAGED.

449
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,271
WELL, WHY THE RUSH?

450
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,706
NO RUSH. I'VE
GOT TIME NOW.

451
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,774
 TIME?

452
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:37,975
MY TICKET.

453
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,877
WITH LUCK, I SHOULD
SEE THE WAR THROUGH.

454
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,612
FLIERS SHOULD NEVER MARRY.

455
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,614
YOU SAW WHAT IT DID
TO BETH WHEN SCOTT...

456
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,783
I'M SORRY.

457
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,185
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I AGREE WITH YOU.

458
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:50,321
YES?

459
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,659
WELL, WHAT I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD-- THANK YOU.

460
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,962
WHAT I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD DO IS GET A
BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE,

461
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,663
IF THERE'S ONE TO BE HAD,
AND MAKE A FOURSOME.

462
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:00,965
YOU AND BETH,
AND ME AND SUSAN.

463
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,666
SOUNDS A GOOD IDEA.

464
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,935
UM, QUINT.

465
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,805
I'M BEING
DELICATELY REMINDED

466
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,974
THERE IS ONE MEMBER
OF OUR FLIGHT

467
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,308
NOT YET CHECKED OUT.

468
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,143
OH, WHO'S THAT?

469
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,178
YOU.

470
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:15,980
YOU'RE WAY OVERDUE.
WHEN SHALL I WRITE
YOU IN FOR?

471
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,648
MMM.

472
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,850
AS SOON AS YOU WANT
TO GET STOOD UP.
SEE YOU.

473
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,196
STAND BY.

474
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,400
STEADY.

475
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,706
<i>BOMB AWAY.</i>

476
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,213
BULL'S-EYE.
GOOD SHOT.

477
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,549
WELL, THEIR AVERAGE
IS 1 HIT IN 10, SIR.

478
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,184
WE ONLY NEED
1 HIT.

479
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,620
3 PLANES CAN
ONLY CARRY 6
HIGHBALLS, SIR.

480
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,356
FLIGHT LT. MASON
IS STILL PESSIMISTIC.

481
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,859
BUT I SAY YOUR CHAPS
WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE.

482
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,527
CORRECT,
WING COMMANDER?

483
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:08,893
 BETH!

484
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,330
I'M ALL RIGHT.

485
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,184
FRIENDS?

486
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,693
â™ª

487
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:56,407
GOOD LUCK.

488
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,474
AND BLESSINGS.

489
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,542
CHEERS.

490
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,247
COME ON,
KISS HER.

491
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,815
QUINT, IT'S A
PUBLIC PLACE.

492
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,017
NO, NO, NO. COME ON,
SHE'S YOUR FIANCE NOW.

493
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,822
THAT'S THE IDEA
OF THIS STUFF,
YOU KNOW.

494
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,024
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO FIZZ AWAY
YOUR INHIBITIONS.

495
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:23,167
GET AWAY,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

496
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,202
I'D SAY YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN PRACTICING.

497
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:28,172
STOP IT, QUINT.
YOU'RE MAKING
SUSAN BLUSH.

498
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,673
IS HE ALWAYS
LIKE THIS?

499
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,041
YES, HE'S ALWAYS
LIKE THIS.

500
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,776
WE'RE LEAVING YOU
TWO THE BOTTLE.

501
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,378
I NEVER DID
BELIEVE IN LONG
ENGAGEMENTS. COME ON.

502
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,846
NEITHER DO I.

503
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,214
SUSAN, I'VE HAD
ENOUGH. NO, NO.

504
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,716
I THINK SHE'S HINTING
AT SOMETHING.

505
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,351
COME ALONG, I
PROMISED TO GET YOU
HOME BY MIDNIGHT.

506
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,685
MIDNIGHT?

507
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,788
YES, ALL FLYBOYS IN
THEIR KIPS BY 12:00.

508
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,390
HAVE FUN, YOU TWO.

509
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,463
â™ª I BELONG TO GLASGOW

510
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:56,033
â™ª DEAR OLD GLASGOW TOWN

511
00:43:56,066 --> 00:44:00,204
â™ª BUT WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH GLASGOW? â™ª

512
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:04,208
â™ª CAUSE IT'S GOING
ROUND AND ROUND â™ª

513
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:08,212
â™ª I'M ONLY A COMMON
OLD WORKING CHAP â™ª

514
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,882
â™ª AS ANYONE HERE CAN SEE

515
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:16,553
â™ª BUT WHEN I GET
A COUPLE OF DRINKS
ON A SATURDAY â™ª

516
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,556
â™ª GLASGOW BELONGS

517
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,924
â™ª TO

518
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,427
â™ª ME

519
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,229
<i>THE ONLY WAY</i>

520
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,499
CHARLON CAN BE LEVELED
AND THE UNDERGROUND
LABORATORY PENETRATED,

521
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,568
IS BY EXTREMELY ACCURATE
SATURATION BOMBING.

522
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:34,671
SQUADRON LEADER MUNROE,
ALONG WITH BANNISTER
AND CLARK

523
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,741
WILL TAKE OFF
WITH HIGHBALL BOMBS
TO DESTROY THE TUNNEL.

524
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:42,513
THE 2ND WAVE,
CONSISTING OF 636,
579, AND 663 SQUADRONS

525
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,350
WILL FOLLOW EXACTLY
10 MINUTES LATER TO HIT
CHARLON AT LOW LEVEL

526
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,951
BELOW 500 FEET.

527
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:54,625
NOW, I REALIZE-- I REALIZE
THAT DROPPING FROM THAT
LEVEL CAN BE STICKY.

528
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:59,763
BUT THAT IS OUR
ASSIGNMENT.

529
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,032
NOW, AIR COMMODORE
HUFFORD HAS A WORD
TO SAY TO YOU. SIR?

530
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,467
AND IT'S
A BAD ONE.

531
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,436
AH, JERRY KNOWS
YOU'RE COMING.

532
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,105
ONE OF OUR KEY
RESISTANCE MEN HAS BEEN
PICKED UP BY THE GESTAPO.

533
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,274
WE MUST ASSUME
THAT HE'S TALKED.

534
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,810
THE GERMANS WILL NO DOUBT
INCREASE THEIR DEFENSES,

535
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,712
AND WITH EVERY PASSING
DAY, THEY'LL GET HOTTER.

536
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,882
THAT MAKES IT IMPERATIVE
YOU GET IN THERE AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE

537
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,985
AND MAKE THE DESTRUCTION
OF CHARLON AS TOTAL
AS YOU CAN.

538
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,221
WELL, THAT'S ALL.

539
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,290
I KNOW YOU'RE THE
MEN THAT'LL DO IT.

540
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,825
GOOD LUCK
TO YOU ALL.

541
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,660
ATTENTION!

542
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,676
GROUND'S AS HARD
AS A BILLIARD TABLE.

543
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,745
YOU HAVE RESERVATIONS
ABOUT OUR MISSION, SERGEANT?

544
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,346
NO, SIR.

545
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,381
I DON'T THINK
WE STAND A
LOVING CHANCE.

546
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,154
AIR RAID!

547
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:46,837
LOOK OUT, QUINT!

548
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:27,611
IT'S A ROLL OF FILM!

549
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,741
 MY GOD!

550
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,811
THOSE ARE R.A.F.
PRISONERS.

551
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,950
THAT'S WEBB,
ALAN WEBB.

552
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,286
HE WAS
MY WINGMAN.

553
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,154
THERE'S CRAWFORD,
AND GREENWOOD.

554
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,090
THEY'RE ALL
R.A.F. AIRCREWS.

555
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,529
THAT'S SCOTTY!

556
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,750
WHAT THE HELL ARE
THEY PLAYING AT?

557
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,485
THAT'S PERFECTLY
OBVIOUS.

558
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,986
SWITCH THAT
DAMN THING OFF.

559
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,755
I'VE SEEN
QUITE ENOUGH!

560
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,823
THERE YOU SEE
THE CRUDE SUBTLETY

561
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,992
OF THE NAZI
MIND, GENTLEMEN,
WELL ILLUSTRATED.

562
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,661
BUT WHAT CAN
THEY HOPE TO GAIN?

563
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,329
2 THINGS.

564
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,164
FIRST, LOWERED MORALE
AMONGST OUR AIRCREWS.

565
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,199
2ND, A PROPAGANDA
OPPORTUNITY.

566
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,935
THE ROYAL AIR FORCE
BOMBING THEIR OWN MEN.

567
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,505
HEADLINE, "THE
FRATRICIDAL R.A.F."

568
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,440
IT'S MONSTROUS!

569
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,510
AH, BUT, PENROSE,
THERE IS ONE GREAT
GIFT IN ALL THIS.

570
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,345
THIS INFANTILE
STRATAGEM CONFIRMS

571
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,180
OUR OWN SUPPOSITION
ABOUT CHARLON.

572
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,848
WE KNOW NOW,

573
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,785
CHARLON IS VITAL
TO THE NAZI MACHINE.

574
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,387
CHARLON MUST
BE DESTROYED.

575
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,989
WE'D BE MURDERING
OUR OWN MEN!

576
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,361
NOT A WORD OF
WHAT WE'VE SEEN MUST
GO OUTSIDE THIS ROOM.

577
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:25,796
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

578
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,664
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
TO ANYBODY.

579
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,253
WHAT A HELL
OF A MESS.

580
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,396
QUINT.

581
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,765
WE'VE GOT TO TELL BETH
THAT SCOTTY'S ALIVE.

582
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,736
DO YOU THINK THAT
WOULD BE A KINDNESS?

583
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,437
QUINT, HE'S ALIVE.

584
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,672
YOU'VE GOT
TO TELL HER.

585
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,073
I KNOW HE'S ALIVE!

586
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,008
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO TELL HER?

587
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,445
THAT HE'S IN CHARLON?
MY NEXT MISSION IS TO
BOMB CHARLON!

588
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,115
WHICH ONE OF US
IS GONNA TELL HER
THAT SCOTTY DIED TWICE?

589
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,683
THEY'LL CANCEL IT.

590
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:21,351
THEY WON'T GO THROUGH
WITH THE STRIKE NOW.

591
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,587
YOU'RE A ROMANTIC,
DOUGLAS.

592
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,955
COMMAND ISN'T.

593
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,593
ONE HELL OF A
ROTTEN MESS.

594
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,628
NOW YOU'RE
REPEATING YOURSELF.

595
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,735
POOR BETH.

596
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:40,837
<i>QUINT!</i>

597
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:45,976
QUINT!

598
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,518
QUINT.

599
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:14,838
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

600
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,612
IT'S SO PEACEFUL HERE.

601
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,784
BUT YOU'VE BROUGHT
THE WAR WITH YOU.

602
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,188
IT'S THIS NEXT
FLIGHT, ISN'T IT?

603
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:35,725
I KNOW THE SIGNS.

604
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,136
COME ON! COME
ON! LET'S RUN.

605
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,706
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

606
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,742
IT MEANS, "OLD
WINE AND YOUNG WOMEN
MAKE A MAN HAPPY."

607
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,113
DO YOU THINK HE
GOT OUT IN TIME?

608
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:33,583
MAYBE.

609
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:42,692
QUINT?

610
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,830
MAYBE IN FRANCE...

611
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,765
THERE'S A COUPLE
STROLLING...

612
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,169
AND THEY...

613
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,104
AND THEY SEE
SCOTTY'S PLANE.

614
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,970
<i>COMMAND IS FULLY</i>
<i>AWARE OF THE POSITION</i>

615
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,438
<i>THE ENEMY HAS</i>
<i>PLACED US IN, MUNROE.</i>

616
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,206
HUFFORD WAS RIGHT.

617
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,775
THE MISSION ITSELF
IS COSTLY ENOUGH

618
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,209
IN MEN AND MACHINES.

619
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,211
AND THERE'S
THE PRISONERS,
THE MURDER.

620
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,880
OH, YES, THAT
IS THE WORD.

621
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:38,615
THE MURDER OF
OUR OWN MEN,

622
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,284
AND THE PROPAGANDA
TO BE MADE OUT OF
THAT. NEVERTHELESS,

623
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,653
THE ORDERS REMAIN.
DESTROY CHARLON.

624
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,294
REGARDLESS
OF THE COST?

625
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,296
REGARDLESS
OF THE COST.

626
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,167
NOW, THAT IS A MEASURE
OF HOW IMPORTANT
THIS THING IS.

627
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,135
OUR GROUP HAS ALREADY
BEEN NOTIFIED.

628
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,737
THEY HIT THE
TARGET 10 MINUTES

629
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,006
AFTER YOUR
HIGHBALL ATTACK
ON THE TUNNEL.

630
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,308
TAKE OFF AT
0600 TOMORROW,

631
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,543
WEATHER PERMITTING.

632
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,145
IT'S OFF.

633
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,514
THE WHOLE BLOODY
CONTINENT'S SOCKED IN.

634
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:12,649
IT'S OFF.

635
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:13,984
YOU MEAN
POSTPONED?

636
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,085
FOR HOW LONG?

637
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,820
I DON'T KNOW.

638
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,421
IT'S THICK AND SOUPY
AS FAR AHEAD AS
WE CAN FORECAST.

639
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,356
IT'S OFF.

640
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,366
â™ª

641
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:45,882
AH!

642
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,553
FIRST TIME I'M
ALMOST GLAD OF
THIS BLASTED THING.

643
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,956
HEY! HEY! HEY!
SCOTCH FOR THE
SQUADRON LEADER.

644
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,691
YOU TRYING TO
DRINK THE BAR DRY?

645
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:56,693
FUNNY YOU SHOULD
SAY THAT, QUINT,

646
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,762
BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I INTEND TO DO.

647
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,630
WELL.

648
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,065
FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE

649
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,167
I'M GLAD I'M NOT
FLYING ANYMORE.

650
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,707
THAT'S RIGHT,
QUINT, LOOK AROUND.

651
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,642
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT THOSE FACES.

652
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,145
THINK OF SOME
OF THE OTHER FACES
THAT'D BE IN THIS ROOM.

653
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,714
FACES YOU AND I
SAW JUST RECENTLY.

654
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,249
FACES OF
FRIENDS OF OURS.

655
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:20,383
CLOSE FRIENDS.

656
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,152
TAKE IT EASY, DOUG.

657
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,087
YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE
MATTER WITH THEM?

658
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,823
PRE-OP NERVES.
WEATHER WAIT.

659
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,892
IF THEY KNEW
WHAT WE KNOW--

660
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,760
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'LL TAKE YOU--

661
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,395
WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN, QUINT,

662
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,397
IF THEY KNEW ABOUT
THE P.O.W.s IN CHARLON?

663
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,398
SHUT UP.

664
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:36,933
THERE'D BE
A BLOODY RIOT.

665
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,735
THEY WOULDN'T.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

666
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:41,071
IT'S NOT ENOUGH!
"SHUT UP. BE QUIET.
BE A GOOD BOY."

667
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,573
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS WAR, QUINT.

668
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:45,942
THOSE WHO CAN SEE
NOT TELLING THESE
POOR, BLIND FOOLS

669
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,844
WHERE THEY'RE FALLING.
YOU DAREN'T TELL THEM,
DO YOU?

670
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:48,912
 ENOUGH.

671
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:49,913
GET OFF ME!

672
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,415
LISTEN, LISTEN.

673
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,517
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THE NAZIS HAVE
MOVED INTO CHARLON?

674
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,753
SHUT UP.
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

675
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,254
P.O.W.s, THAT'S WHAT.

676
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,256
AIRMEN,
MOSQUITO PILOTS.

677
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,025
THEY'RE MAKING
YOU INTO MURDERERS.

678
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,359
IS THIS TRUE,
QUINT?

679
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,195
OF COURSE, IT'S TRUE.
LOOK AT HIS FACE.

680
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,197
GENTLEMEN!

681
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,481
ESCORT THIS OFFICER
TO HIS QUARTERS.

682
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,558
THERE'LL BE A
BRIEFING IN ONE HOUR

683
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,327
FOR ALL DUTY OFFICERS.

684
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,304
<i>WELL, THAT IS</i>
<i>THE SITUATION.</i>

685
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,073
YOU KNOW IT ALL NOW.

686
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,142
YOU WOULD HAVE
BEEN TOLD ALL JUST
BEFORE YOU WENT.

687
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,843
AND THE DIRECTIVE REMAINS.

688
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,912
CHARLON MUST BE DESTROYED.

689
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:57,580
BUT SIR, SUPPOSE--

690
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,150
TEMPLETON, YOU
WILL DO YOUR JOB,
AND I WILL DO MINE.

691
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,918
NOW, JUST LOOK
AT THIS MATTER.

692
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,320
IF THE WORK AT
CHARLON CONTINUES,

693
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,689
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE MIGHT DIE.

694
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,825
THE WHOLE OF
SOUTHERN ENGLAND
DEVASTATED,

695
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,693
OUR BRIDGEHEAD IN
EUROPE DESTROYED.

696
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,662
THE INVASION
PUSHED BACK MONTHS.

697
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,931
COULDN'T THE PARATROOPS
GO IN, SIR, INSTEAD
OF BOMBERS?

698
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,699
THEY'D BE SLAUGHTERED
BEFORE THEY TOUCHED DOWN.

699
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,268
WHAT ABOUT
THE FRENCH
UNDERGROUND?

700
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,370
THE GERMANS ARE
ON THE ALERT. NO.

701
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,572
IT MUST BE A STRIKE
FROM THE AIR.

702
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:27,777
THERE MAY BE
A WAY, SIR.

703
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,345
WHILE WE'RE
ATTACKING THE TUNNEL,

704
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,381
WE DETACH ONE AIRCRAFT
TO BREACH THE WALL.

705
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:33,850
THE FRENCH UNDERGROUND
MOVE THROUGH THE BREACH,

706
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:35,685
TAKE ON THE GERMANS
ACTUALLY IN THE CASTLE,

707
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:36,886
AND HELP
OUR CHAPS OUT.

708
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,621
JUST AHEAD OF OUR
BOMBING ATTACK?

709
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,523
YES.
AND THEN WHAT?

710
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,559
WELL, THEN, IT'S
EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.

711
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:45,028
SCUTTLING OUT OF
THE TRAP, RUNNING
IN ALL DIRECTIONS?

712
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,030
WELL, AT LEAST THIS
WAY THEY WON'T DIE

713
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,565
UNDER OUR OWN BOMBS.

714
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:49,799
YES, ALL RIGHT.

715
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,534
I CAN SEE SOME
SENSE IN IT.

716
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,204
THEN YOU GET
HEADQUARTERS TO
APPROVE THE PLAN.

717
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,139
THEY'LL HAVE TO SECURE
THE COOPERATION

718
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,807
OF THE FRENCH
UNDERGROUND.

719
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,577
THE UNDERGROUND
COULDN'T MOUNT AN
EFFORT ON THIS SCALE.

720
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,546
AND EVEN IF THEY COULD,
THOSE PRISONERS WHO
AREN'T KILLED

721
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,415
WHEN YOU BLAST OPEN
THE PRISON WALL,

722
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:07,717
WOULD BE SCATTERED
THROUGHOUT THE CASTLE.

723
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,753
LOCKED UP IN DOZENS OF
CUBBYHOLES AND CELLARS.

724
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,323
YOU'D NEED A FORCE

725
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:15,258
THAT COULD
SUBDUE THE WHOLE
GERMAN GARRISON

726
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:18,761
AND STAND OFF
REINFORCEMENTS
FROM OUTSIDE.

727
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,064
NO, SQUADRON LEADER,
I APPLAUD YOUR MOTIVES,

728
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,832
BUT YOUR SCHEME
IS IMPRACTICABLE.

729
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:25,535
GIVING MEN A CHANCE
FOR THEIR LIVES
IS IMPRACTICABLE?

730
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,571
YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR

731
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,674
EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT
WITH THESE PRISONERS.

732
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,910
HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF
THE MEN ON THE GROUND

733
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,112
YOU'RE ASKING TO
RISK THEIR LIVES?

734
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,114
NOTHING MUST BE
ATTEMPTED THAT WOULD

735
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,183
JEOPARDIZE THE MAIN
PURPOSE OF THE STRIKE.

736
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,284
SUPPOSING...

737
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,788
SUPPOSING JUST BEFORE
WE BLOW THE WALL,

738
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:49,125
THE--THE PRISONERS COULD
BE GATHERED TOGETHER
IN ONE SAFE PLACE.

739
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,261
COULD NOT
THE UNDERGROUND
THEN TAKE THEM OVER

740
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,730
AND GET THEM
OUT O-O-ON THE, ON
THE ESCAPE ROUTE?

741
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,768
MOST OF THOSE THAT
SURVIVE, I WOULD SAY.

742
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,638
THEN SCHEDULE THE ATTACK
FOR SUNDAY MORNING.

743
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,273
SUNDAY MORNING?

744
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,447
SUNDAY MORNING.
OF COURSE.

745
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:12,482
OF COURSE.

746
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,854
GOOD MORNING.

747
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:25,888
GOOD MORNING,
PADRE.

748
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,992
GOOD DAY, MY SONS.

749
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,527
GOOD MORNING, FATHER.

750
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,063
AH, LT. SCHACK,
<i>BONJOUR.</i>

751
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,065
<i>BONJOUR,</i>
FATHER BELLAGUE.

752
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,900
THE CONFESSIONAL IS
ALL READY FOR YOU.

753
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,102
THANK YOU.

754
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,550
PLEASE REMOVE
YOUR GUARDS.

755
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,986
I CANNOT ASK THESE
MEN TO MAKE THEIR
CONFESSIONS TO GOD

756
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,254
WITH A GUN
AT THEIR BACKS.

757
01:00:58,287 --> 01:00:59,555
SORRY, FATHER.

758
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,391
THE COMMANDANT'S ORDERS.

759
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,226
I THINK HE SUSPECTS
YOU WILL GIVE OUT

760
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:05,895
MORE THAN ABSOLUTION
IN THE CONFESSIONAL.

761
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:08,398
PERHAPS YOU PREFER ME
TO HEAR MY CONFESSIONS
IN THE OPEN,

762
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,500
WHERE HIS ENTIRE
GARRISON COULD WATCH.

763
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,102
AS YOU PLEASE, FATHER.

764
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:44,500
HERE.

765
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,613
FATHER, GIVE ME
YOUR BLESSING,

766
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:58,948
FOR I HAVE SINNED--

767
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:01,284
KEEP YOUR
LIPS MOVING, SON,
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

768
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,219
I WILL NOT REPEAT
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

769
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,388
TELL ALL YOUR MEN THAT
THEY ARE TO BE AT MASS

770
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,156
IN CHAPEL ON
SUNDAY MORNING.

771
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,859
TELL THEM THAT THE ORDER
IS FROM AIR COMMAND.

772
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,632
NOW, MY SON.

773
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,334
FOR I HAVE SINNED

774
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,169
THROUGH MY FAULT,
THROUGH MY FAULT,

775
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,004
THROUGH MY MOST
GRIEVOUS FAULT.

776
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,677
GO IN PEACE
AND PRAY FOR ME.

777
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,184
KEEP YOUR LIPS MOVING,
SON, AND LISTEN CAREFULLY.

778
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,653
WHEN ALL THE
MEN ARE IN CHAPEL
TOMORROW MORNING

779
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,322
AND THE ATTACK BEGINS,

780
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,491
THEY ARE TRYING
TO GET YOU OUT.

781
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:42,692
THANK GOD!

782
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,327
<i>GENTLEMEN, THIS MISSION</i>

783
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,996
MUST BE EXECUTED WITH
EXACTING PRECISION,

784
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,231
BOTH IN TIMING
AND ACCURACY.

785
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,366
THIS TUNNEL...

786
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,669
MUST BE CLOSED.

787
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:56,839
MUNROE, CLARK AND
BANNISTER WILL FLY
THE FIRST PHASE.

788
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,842
EACH OF THEIR
MOSQUITOES WILL CARRY
2 HIGHBALL BOMBS,

789
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,011
ONE OF WHICH IS
CAPABLE OF DESTROYING

790
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,046
THE ENTIRE
UNDERGROUND FACILITY.

791
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,715
MUNROE, AS SOON
AS ONE OF YOU

792
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,517
PUTS A BOMB
INTO THE MOUTH
OF THE TUNNEL,

793
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,785
YOU MAY PROCEED
TO BREACH THE WALL.

794
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:12,288
THE PRISONERS WILL BE
WAITING IN THE CHAPEL.

795
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,856
NOW, ONCE THE WALL
IS DESTROYED,

796
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,691
MEMBERS OF THE
FRENCH UNDERGROUND

797
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,293
WILL START
DIVERSIONARY SKIRMISHES

798
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,462
SO THAT OUR MEN
WILL HAVE A CHANCE

799
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:21,364
TO HEAD FOR THE
WOODS TO THE WEST.

800
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:22,965
MINUTES LATER,

801
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:26,002
WAVES OF MOSQUITOES
WILL LEVEL CHARLON.

802
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,272
ANY QUESTIONS?

803
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,076
TAKE OFF AT 0625
HOURS TOMORROW.

804
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,746
DISMISSED.

805
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,562
LOOKS AS THOUGH
IT'S GONNA BE

806
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,230
PRETTY SLOPPY
OVER CHARLON.

807
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:55,665
DAMNED RAIN COULD RUIN

808
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,400
WHAT LITTLE CHANCES
WE DID HAVE.

809
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,335
RAIN OR NO RAIN,
WE GO TOMORROW.

810
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,737
DID THOSE
SILLY BLIGHTERS
AT INTELLIGENCE

811
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,240
TELL US HOW WE'RE GONNA
GET A DECENT BOUNCE
OFF THIS MUCK?

812
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:05,675
YEAH, JUST BEFORE
YOU SHOOT,

813
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,677
YOU USE MY
GUARANTEED EQUALIZER.

814
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,412
OH, WHAT'S THAT?

815
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:10,913
JUST BEFORE YOU SHOOT,

816
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,515
YOU SPIT ON YOUR
FIRING THUMB.

817
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:20,256
WHAT'S SO
HILARIOUS, CHUM?

818
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,959
YOU KNOW, I'VE
BEEN A BIT WORRIED
ABOUT HIM RECENTLY.

819
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:25,595
I THOUGHT HE WAS
BEGINNING TO GET A BIT
SERIOUS ABOUT HIS JOB.

820
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:26,929
IS THAT SO BAD?

821
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,264
WHEN A MAN
LIKE QUINT MUNROE

822
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,266
STARTS TO GET SERIOUS,
HE GETS CAUTIOUS.

823
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:31,934
THAT'S WHEN HIS
LUCK DESERTS HIM.

824
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,135
AND US?

825
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,637
AND US.

826
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,073
HEY.

827
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,290
THEY WON'T LET
ME SEE DOUGLAS.

828
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,992
I THOUGHT YOU
KNEW THAT ALREADY.

829
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,830
I THOUGHT IF I CAME
HERE TO THE BASE, I...

830
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,001
I HAD TO SEE
YOU, QUINT.

831
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:12,008
WELL, I--I CAN'T
STAY LONG.

832
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,244
CAN'T YOU AT LEAST TELL
ME WHY HE'S CONFINED
TO HIS QUARTERS...

833
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:16,646
WHY I CAN'T
SPEAK TO HIM?

834
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,814
INSUBORDINATION.

835
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,650
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

836
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:21,517
TO WHOM?

837
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:23,953
THE WING COMMANDER.

838
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:34,530
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME HERE.

839
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,370
WHEN WILL I
SEE YOU AGAIN?

840
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,644
TOMORROW.

841
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:51,981
WITH LUCK?

842
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:01,657
COME BACK, QUINT.

843
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,728
I COULDN'T BEAR
IT IF YOU DIDN'T.

844
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,716
STAND EASY,
PLEASE.

845
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:27,917
WELL, DON'T WORRY,

846
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,553
I'M GOING TO
SPARE YOU MY USUAL
TEDIOUS PEP TALK.

847
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:33,255
YOU'VE BEEN BRIEFED.
YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE
OF YOUR MISSION.

848
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,391
JUST REMEMBER THAT
OUR BOMBER WAVE WILL

849
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:37,593
START THEIR DROP AT
PRECISELY 1000 HOURS,

850
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,729
REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER OR NOT

851
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,098
ALL OUR PRISONERS
ARE OUT OF CHARLON.

852
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,567
SO ANY DELAY IN
DEALING WITH THE TARGETS

853
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,903
ASSIGNED TO YOU COULD
BE EXTREMELY COSTLY.

854
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,939
WELL, THAT'S ALL
I WANTED TO SAY,

855
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,408
EXCEPT TO WISH EACH
OF YOU GOOD LUCK.

856
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:02,918
ATTENTION.

857
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,553
GOOD MORNING,
GENTLEMEN.

858
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:08,090
STAND EASY.

859
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,126
I'M TOLD THE
WEATHER OVER CHARLON

860
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,961
WILL BE IDEAL FOR
OUR PURPOSES TODAY.

861
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,529
EVERYONE FEELING WELL?

862
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:14,930
YES, THANK YOU, SIR.

863
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:17,633
PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER
BREAK THIS NEWS, SIR.

864
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,635
AS YOU WISH,
WING COMMANDER.

865
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:21,437
IT'S FROM AIR
MARSHAL, GENTLEMEN.

866
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,105
A SLIGHT CHANGE
IN YOUR ORDERS.

867
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,775
YOU ARE NOT TO
ATTACK THE PRISON WALL

868
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,643
UNTIL YOU HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY SEALED
THAT TUNNEL.

869
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,649
WHAT IF IT TAKES
ALL 6 HIGHBALLS TO
DO THE JOB, SIR?

870
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,951
THEN, REGRETTABLY,
THE ESCAPE PLAN
IS ABORTED.

871
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,820
THE UNDERGROUND HAS
ORDERS TO WITHDRAW.

872
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:39,989
LEAVE OUR CHAPS TO
BE BLOWN TO HELL?

873
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:41,557
THE TUNNEL HAS
FIRST PRIORITY.

874
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,793
THE ESCAPE PLAN IS
A BONUS OPERATION.

875
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,162
THIS DAMN MISSION
MADE SENSE WITH A
HIGHBALL FOR THE PRISON,

876
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,496
BUT THIS IS OBSCENE.

877
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,065
THAT'S ENOUGH!

878
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,735
THERE WILL BE
NO DEVIATION FROM THE
AIR MARSHAL'S ORDERS.

879
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,437
IS THAT CLEAR,
SQUADRON LEADER MUNROE?

880
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,105
SIR.

881
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,142
I'M SURE YOU'LL
HAVE SEVERAL HIGHBALLS

882
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,811
TO SPARE FOR
THAT WALL, MUNROE.

883
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:04,146
I FEEL CONFIDENT OF THAT.

884
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,347
I'M GLAD
YOU DO, SIR.

885
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,653
CARRY ON,
WING COMMANDER.

886
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:19,695
ALL RIGHT.

887
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:38,574
YOU KNOW THE TROUBLE
WITH THIS WAR, SIR?

888
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:39,742
WHAT?

889
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,011
THE WORLD'S
BACK TO FRONT.

890
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:43,412
BACK TO FRONT?

891
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:44,747
YEAH.

892
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,116
WE GO OUT WHEN THE
SUN'S RISING IN OUR FACE.

893
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:50,085
WE COME HOME AND IT'S
SETTING IN OUR FACE.

894
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:53,455
YEAH, THE WORLD'S
BACK TO FRONT.

895
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,624
I BET THE LUFTWAFFE
DOESN'T THINK SO, WILEY.

896
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:57,293
YEAH!

897
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:58,961
THEY HAD YEARS
PREPARING FOR
THIS ROTTEN WAR.

898
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,829
WE JUST GOT IT
HANDED TO US.

899
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,852
SUDDENLY, FATHER,
EVERYONE IS VERY
RELIGIOUS.

900
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,520
 YOU!

901
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,860
HE CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER HIS NAME.

902
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:07,529
HOW DOES HE KNOW
HE'S A CATHOLIC?

903
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,965
THE SPIRIT MOVES
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS,
LT. SCHACK.

904
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,202
GO.

905
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:16,205
THE COMMANDANT IS NOT SO
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND.

906
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,048
THE COMMANDANT DISLIKES
MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCES.

907
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,051
TAKE CARE, PRIEST.

908
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,872
SQUADRON LEADER?

909
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:51,040
YES, FATHER?

910
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,042
YOU, UM...

911
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,843
YOU DO NOT
KNOW YOUR NAME?

912
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,912
NO, FATHER.

913
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,949
PLEASE, TAKE
YOUR SEAT, MY SON.

914
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,935
IF ANYTHING
EVER PUTS ME OFF
RELIGION, THIS WILL.

915
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,003
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

916
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:22,071
ESCAPE.

917
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,505
WHO SAYS SO?

918
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,407
I SAY SO.
THE OLD PRIEST IS
UP TO SOMETHING.

919
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:26,675
THAT'S RIGHT,

920
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,944
HE'S GONNA
SNEAK US OUT
UNDER HIS ROBES.

921
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:30,579
ALL OF US?

922
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:32,147
WE'RE GOING HOME.

923
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:25,000
HOW'S DAISY?

924
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,001
DON'T ASK!

925
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,303
NOW WHAT?

926
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,139
SHE'S LOST THE
RATION BOOKS AGAIN.

927
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:31,473
WE'RE STARVING
TO DEATH.

928
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:34,009
STILL, SHE MAKES UP
FOR IT IN OTHER WAYS.

929
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:39,007
5 MINUTES TO TARGET.

930
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:44,079
NEW COURSE, 160.

931
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:46,782
NOW.

932
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:22,751
OUT! OUT!
OUT! OUT!

933
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:24,253
EVERYONE BACK
TO HIS CELL.

934
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,592
SQUADRON LEADER NEALE.

935
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,961
YOU ARE A SENIOR
OFFICER HERE.

936
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:35,297
ORDER YOUR MEN TO
MARCH OUTSIDE AT ONCE.

937
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:37,699
PLEASE!

938
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:40,168
STAY WHERE YOU ARE,
MEN. THAT'S AN ORDER.

939
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:46,275
SO WE HAVE A
MUTINY ON OUR HANDS.

940
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:49,978
PRIEST!

941
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:52,548
TELL THEM TO OBEY!

942
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,492
YOU ARE A FOOLISH
MAN, FATHER BELLAGUE.

943
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,527
YOU INSIST ON
BEING A MARTYR?

944
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:12,801
YOU BASTARDS!

945
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:13,936
KILL HIM!

946
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:19,474
BARRICADE THE DOOR.

947
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,316
HE'S DEAD.

948
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,051
TAKE HIM TO
THE SACRISTY.

949
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:31,219
MEN!

950
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:33,855
MEN! MEN!

951
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,490
MEN, LISTEN TO ME.

952
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:36,992
JUST GATHER ROUND
AND LISTEN.

953
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,427
WHAT FOR?

954
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,329
WE'VE BEEN ORDERED
TO STAY HERE.

955
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:43,031
WE CAN'T STAY
HOLED UP IN HERE, SIR,
NOT WITHOUT WEAPONS.

956
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,000
WE'LL STICK IT OUT
AS LONG AS WE CAN.

957
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:47,369
NOW JUST SETTLE DOWN.
BACK TO YOUR SEATS.

958
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,338

THANK GOD.

1035
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:29,671
SCOTTY?

1036
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:33,541
HE WAS KILLED.

1037
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:38,846
DOES, UH...

1038
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,581
DOES BETH KNOW
HE WAS ALIVE?

1039
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:42,517
NO.

1040
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:52,226
MUNROE, WELL DONE.

1041
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:55,029
WHAT YOU AND THE
OTHERS DID, MY BOY,
WAS HISTORIC.

1042
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:56,497
YES, BUT COSTLY.

1043
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:58,199
WE LOST BANNISTER
AND CLARK.

1044
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:00,334
BUT GERMANY WILL
ALWAYS REMEMBER CHARLON.

1045
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:02,070
NEVER FORGET THAT.

1046
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:04,038
THERE'LL BE ANOTHER
SQUADRON, QUINT.

1047
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:06,040
THERE'LL NEVER BE
ANOTHER CHARLON.

1048
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:12,046
IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
