1
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:03,151
Axxon N.,

2
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:06,383
the longest running
radio play in history--

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,106
tonight, continuing in
the Baltic region,

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,300
a gray winter day
in an old hotel.

5
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,070
The stairway is dark.

6
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:33,986
I don't recognize this hallway.
Where are we?

7
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:37,174
At our room now.

8
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,879
I don't have the key.

9
00:01:40,152 --> 00:01:43,853
No, you gave it to me.
I have it.

10
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:48,250
What's wrong with me?

11
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:03,999
This is the room?
I don't recognize it.

12
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:08,182
-Take off your clothes.
-Sure.

13
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:12,730
You know what whores do?

14
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:15,169
Yes.

15
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:18,015
They fuck.

16
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:27,094
-Do you want to fuck me?
-Take off your clothes...

17
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:31,042
I'll tell you what I want.

18
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:34,009
Fine.

19
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:47,795
I'm afraid...

20
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,251
I'm afraid...

21
00:02:52,376 --> 00:03:00,166
# I sing this poem to you #

22
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,369
# On the other side #

23
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:09,550
# I see #

24
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:18,753
# Shining #

25
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:24,286
# Waves #

26
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:30,043
# Billowing #

27
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,009
# It's far away #

28
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:46,426
# Far away from you #

29
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,897
# I can see it there #

30
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:36,329
I am going to find out
one day.

31
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:43,197
When will you tell it?

32
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:50,095
Who could've known?

33
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,993
What time is it?

34
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:15,079
I have a secret.

35
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,569
There have been
no calls today.

36
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:44,627
I hear someone.

37
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:59,586
I do not think it will be
much longer now.

38
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,167
You are looking
for something?

39
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:24,105
Yes.

40
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:27,546
-Are you looking to go in?
-Yes.

41
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:31,662
An opening?

42
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:33,709
Look for an opening.
Do you understand?

43
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,129
Yes, I understand.

44
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:37,431
Do you understand
I look for an opening?

45
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:39,662
Yes.
I understand completely.

46
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:43,295
Good.
Good that you understand.

47
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,726
That's good!

48
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:53,852
You understand!

49
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,288
-May l help you?
-Yes...

50
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,517
I'm a new neighbor.

51
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:34,757
I live just down the street.

52
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:36,775
Ma'am?

53
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:44,921
Hello!

54
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:50,455
I don't mean to intrude.

55
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:53,609
I'm your new neighbor.

56
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:58,687
I... hope this isn't
incovenient for you.

57
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,458
No, no.

58
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:04,500
Um, please, sit down.

59
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:10,951
Such a lovely home
you have.

60
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:15,247
Well, thank you.
We enjoy it very much.

61
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,178
Please.

62
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:23,469
Would you like a coffee?

63
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:27,799
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

64
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:29,307
And for you, ma'am?

65
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,356
I'll have the same, Henry.
Thank you.

66
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:39,416
I've... l've been going around
meeting our new neighbors.

67
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:44,101
I think that it is important
to know one's neighbors.

68
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:46,816
To say "Hello" to them.

69
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:54,934
Yes, it's very rare these days,
but that's very nice.

70
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:59,303
Which house are you living in?

71
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:04,645
Just down the way.

72
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:07,866
Tucked back
in the small woods.

73
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,569
The brick house.

74
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:14,338
I think l know the one.

75
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:19,514
It's difficult to see it
from the road.

76
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:22,176
Mm-hmm.

77
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:38,891
Thank you.

78
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:01,704
Condiments, madam?

79
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,067
Oh, yes. Very good.

80
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:12,929
Will that be all, ma'am?

81
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,800
Uh, yes. Yes, thank you.

82
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,646
I'll be just close by
if you need me.

83
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:20,845
Thank you, Henry.

84
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:32,169
So...

85
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,972
You have a new role
to play, l hear?

86
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:39,370
Up for a role.

87
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,643
But, uh, l'm afraid...
far from getting it.

88
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:47,130
No, no. l definitely heard
that you have it.

89
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:51,841
-Oh?
-Yes...

90
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,800
It is an--

91
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:59,554
Is it an interesting role?

92
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:02,448
Oh, yes. Very.

93
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,609
Is it about marriage?

94
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:14,510
Um... perhaps, in some ways,
but, um...

95
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:17,464
Your husband.
He's involved?

96
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:21,874
No.

97
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:29,245
Hmm.

98
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,291
A little boy...

99
00:13:39,663 --> 00:13:42,198
went out to play.

100
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:45,152
When he opened his door...

101
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:47,554
he saw the world.

102
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,958
As he passed
through the doorway...

103
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:55,144
he caused...

104
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,903
a reflection.

105
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:00,517
Evil was born.

106
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:07,403
Evil was born,
and followed the boy.

107
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:16,514
I'm sorry...
What is that?

108
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,150
An old tale.

109
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,380
And the variation:

110
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:27,694
A little girl...

111
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:29,972
went out to play.

112
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:35,781
Lost in the marketplace...

113
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,779
as if half-born.

114
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:48,814
Then... not through
the marketplace--

115
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:50,312
you see that,
don't you?--

116
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,877
but through the alley,
behind the marketplace.

117
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,651
This...

118
00:14:57,067 --> 00:15:00,407
is the way to the Palace.

119
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,292
But...

120
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:10,059
it isn't something
you remember.

121
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:14,288
Forgetfulness.
It happens to us all.

122
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:19,951
And... me? Why,
l'm the worst one!

123
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,880
"Oh, where was l?"

124
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:27,710
Yes.

125
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:34,585
Is... is there a murder
in your film?

126
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,959
Uh, no. That's not
part of the story.

127
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,838
No?

128
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:47,224
I think you are wrong
about that!

129
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:50,194
No.

130
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:53,216
Brutal fuckin' murder!

131
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,665
Uh, I don't like
this kind of talk.

132
00:15:58,201 --> 00:16:01,260
The things you've been saying...
l think you should go now.

133
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:05,366
Yes...

134
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:08,982
Me... I... I can't
seem to remember

135
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:11,049
if it's today...

136
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:14,394
two days from now,
or yesterday.

137
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:19,090
Hmm, I suppose
if it was 9:45,

138
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:21,917
I'd think it was
after midnight!

139
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,612
For instance...

140
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:31,604
If today...

141
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:33,597
was tomorrow...

142
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:39,215
you wouldn't even remember
that you owed...

143
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:42,520
on an unpaid bill.

144
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:47,269
Actions...

145
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:50,098
do have consequences.

146
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:55,551
And yet...

147
00:16:57,345 --> 00:17:00,296
there is the magic.

148
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,627
If it was tomorrow...

149
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:11,393
you would be sitting
over there.

150
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,318
Do you see?

151
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:33,525
You think that's really
what he meant?

152
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:39,738
Excuse me, ma'am?

153
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:45,340
Excuse me, ma'am.
Telephone.

154
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,113
It's for you.

155
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:52,537
It's your agent.

156
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:00,656
Greg?

157
00:18:02,285 --> 00:18:03,504
Greg!

158
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:09,386
-I got it! I got it!
-Oh, I knew it! Good for you!

159
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:39,553
Nikki, it's we who are happy and
fortunate to have you onboard,

160
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,462
on this film,
on this role.

161
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:46,137
I meant everything l said in
praising Devon.

162
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:51,000
And forgive me, l do love
making speeches.

163
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,253
I mean this, too.

164
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,207
You have everything you need
to soar back to the top...

165
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,168
and stay perched there.

166
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,766
This film, you and Devon,
a great director...

167
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,314
Yes? Do l hear?

168
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,608
The script as well.
We're gonna plunge into it...

169
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,094
If we all... play our role,
do our best,

170
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:17,067
if we work hard together...

171
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,185
well, this could be the one.

172
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,919
This is a star-maker, if ever
l saw one. You'll see.

173
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:27,338
I think we have a chance
to pull it off.

174
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:30,007
What do you say?

175
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:31,891
Let's do it!

176
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:36,401
If you don't fuck it up,
Kingsley, l'm sure we can.

177
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,380
I've never felt better
in my life.

178
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:44,145
Champagne and caviar
is on its way.

179
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:50,849
Tonight, Nikki Grace
and Devon Berk.

180
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:54,350
Marsha, honey, l know where
you live. Don't pull my hair.

181
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:55,365
We're back in:

182
00:19:55,365 --> 00:19:59,548
5,4,3,2...

183
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:03,154
Mamas, lock up
your daughters' doors!

184
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:09,071
Nikki, really. This news, this
shocking revelation by Devon...

185
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:12,519
must've send a shiver
down your spine!

186
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:15,787
Are you going
to be able to be

187
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:19,244
true to hubby
with a wolf in the den?

188
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:21,601
Now, Marilyn...

189
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,727
We, um...

190
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,561
I'm sure we'll get on famously,
in a professional way,

191
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:28,508
and that's how it will stay,
professional.

192
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:31,117
Mmm...mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm!

193
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:34,216
Mmm...mm-hmm.

194
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:40,116
And, Devon, you naughty boy.
Are you hiding a smile?

195
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:44,081
Is your devilish mind
scheming?

196
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,562
Mmm mmm?

197
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:48,599
If you're looking for
shock value, Marilyn,

198
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,406
l suggest you look in the mirror.

199
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,061
Whoo!

200
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:53,470
Hoo hoo hoo hoo.

201
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,383
What a biting wit!

202
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:57,989
But l tell you this.

203
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,420
Marilyn Levens
is going to be watching,

204
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,881
and she will be
reporting to you

205
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:05,366
everything she finds out!

206
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:08,041
There and there

207
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:11,780
and there and
beyond around the world!

208
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,791
The Marilyn Levens
Starlight Celebrity show

209
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,053
will be back next week,

210
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,734
from Hollywood, California,

211
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:20,193
where stars make dreams...

212
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,276
...and dreams make stars.

213
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:27,335
What the hell were
you assholes thinking?

214
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,469
That was the biggest
crock of shit l ever saw!

215
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:31,901
How can this bitch be popular?
Bullshit!

216
00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:35,149
-Hey!
-Oh, you guys. How did it go?

217
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:38,417
You were great. You were amazing.
Beautiful.

218
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:41,137
You absolutely nailed it.
Did you hear her?

219
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,442
-Did you hear what Marilyn said?
-No.

220
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:44,148
She said you glowed!
I mean, it was perfect!

221
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,338
So, Devon...
This one's off limits, right?

222
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,160
Don't even think about it.

223
00:21:49,228 --> 00:21:50,941
If l don't kill you,
her husband will,

224
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,857
and he is THE most
powerful guy around.

225
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:55,439
He knows everything. There's
not a thing he doesn't know.

226
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:57,955
I could tell you stories
that'll curl your hair.

227
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:00,376
So listen to me
when l tell you,

228
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:03,252
around Nikki,
keep it in your pants.

229
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:06,876
What the fuck you guys
talking about?

230
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:09,540
She's a nice girl
but she's so far from my style,

231
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:11,410
it's not even funny.

232
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,618
Beautiful, Devon. Great.
We'll be able to sleep tonight.

233
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:20,996
You gotta admit, though,
she's got a nice ass.

234
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:28,512
-It was good.
-Nighty-night, guys.

235
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:30,514
-Goodnight, l'll talk to you tomorrow.
-OK.

236
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:33,407
-Bye.
-Let's go.

237
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:10,866
-Hello.
-Good morning, Ms. Grace.

238
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,150
Go right inside.

239
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:27,841
Ooh, fantastic!

240
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,377
It's all in the beans.

241
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,986
And l'm just full of beans!

242
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,176
Wow. Is that our set?

243
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:41,014
Yeah.
But it's not finished yet.

244
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,028
There's Smithy's House.

245
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,814
Smithy's House...

246
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:06,029
I should have guessed you two
professionals would be here early

247
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:07,828
and beavering away.

248
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,003
We're just laying about,
drinking cappuccinos.

249
00:24:10,502 --> 00:24:13,230
Devon makes
a great capuccino.

250
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:14,053
Care for one?

251
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:16,616
Oh, thanks,
but Freddie and l just had a...

252
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:18,828
cup of tea.

253
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:23,000
Actually, it was a terrible cup
of tea. At the commissary.

254
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:27,826
"Terrible" is an
inadequate description of it.

255
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:49,834
Well, l thought since we're here
and Smithy's set's been started...

256
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:52,657
we might go through some of those
scenes that take place there.

257
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:54,776
Not the love scene, of course,
but some of the earlier scenes

258
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,886
that indicate so beautifully
your characters.

259
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:04,183
Let's take, for instance,
scene 35...

260
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,948
the scene where, uh...

261
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:11,837
Devon, you arrive--

262
00:25:12,064 --> 00:25:13,240
Billy--

263
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:17,235
at, uh, Smithy's house,
to find Sue-- Nikki--

264
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:20,307
looking out of the window.
-I love that scene.

265
00:25:20,363 --> 00:25:21,740
Yeah. Well...

266
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,521
We'll just, uh...
we'll go through it,

267
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:25,604
and then we'll...

268
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:28,532
maybe take it on the set and
block it out as best as possible.

269
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:30,524
So I guess we should just
jump right in?

270
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:32,304
-Yeah, that would be jolly good.
-All right.

271
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,779
Um, l'll start it off...

272
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:37,802
uh, top of page 57.

273
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:39,629
Uh, Nikki, this is just
a rough run-through,

274
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:42,007
So don't be hard on yourself.

275
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:44,290
I am expecting from you
an Academy Award performance

276
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:45,695
right out of the gate, so...

277
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,258
Thanks, Devon.
Get going, please.

278
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,731
"I didn't think
you'd be here."

279
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,686
"No, of course
you wouldn't."

280
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:04,834
"That's because you..."

281
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:07,879
"What?"

282
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:10,511
"What do you want?"

283
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:14,826
"I said some things last night,
as you know."

284
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:16,878
"Yeah."

285
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,227
"And l want to apologize."

286
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,878
-"Apologize?"
-"Yeah."

287
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:31,315
"The things you said
weren't the truth?"

288
00:26:33,597 --> 00:26:35,118
"I didn't say that."

289
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,689
"Were they the truth?"

290
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:51,032
"Are you cryin'?"

291
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,683
"Uh huh...

292
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,005
Yeah."

293
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:03,179
"Are you sorry about last night?"

294
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:05,972
"Are you?"

295
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:10,901
"Why are you cryin'?"

296
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:14,559
"I'm sorry, Billy.

297
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:16,579
I'm so sorry..."

298
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:19,952
"What?"

299
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:25,845
"Oh, shit."

300
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,591
"Look in the other room."

301
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,277
What is that?

302
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:37,569
Freddie!

303
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:39,871
No, someone's there.

304
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:47,406
This stage is supposed to be
ours and ours alone.

305
00:27:51,825 --> 00:27:54,797
Well... let's have a look.

306
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:04,140
Who was it?

307
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:07,967
Disappeared where it's
real hard to disappear.

308
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:17,396
Maybe we should talk.
Maybe this is the time.

309
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:20,519
Let's be serious for a moment
about something other than this scene.

310
00:29:20,938 --> 00:29:22,563
-What?
-What is it?

311
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:24,137
Sit down. l'll tell you.

312
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:30,568
Now, it was Freddie who
first heard about it.

313
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,058
It's--

314
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:34,652
If you have a--

315
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:36,621
an assistant
who can hold his liquor, then...

316
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,420
Freddie can do that
with the best of them.

317
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:42,182
Somebody's got to do it.
Gable's dead.

318
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,997
Now, Freddie is purposefully
out and about

319
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,313
gathering what
in this business

320
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,432
is the most
valuable commodity--

321
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:51,476
information.

322
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:54,391
Information is indispensable.

323
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,639
You probably know this
from your own lives.

324
00:29:56,785 --> 00:30:00,418
We all have people who gather--
agents, friends, producers.

325
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:03,814
And... sometimes they share.

326
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,123
Sometimes not.

327
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:10,353
Politics. I don't know.

328
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:12,284
Huh! Ego.

329
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:14,321
Fear.

330
00:30:14,765 --> 00:30:15,827
Kingsley.

331
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:19,058
Sometimes one just isn't told
the whole story.

332
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,417
Kingsley, get to the point.

333
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:35,258
On High in Blue Tomorrows
is, in fact, a remake.

334
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:37,743
It's a remake...

335
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,272
-Yeah.
-I wouldn't do a remake.

336
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,984
No, no no, no, no.
l know. Of course.

337
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:44,346
But you didn't know.

338
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:46,197
The original was a differrent name.

339
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:48,136
It was started,
but it was never finished.

340
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:52,548
Now... Freddie's found out
that our producers...

341
00:30:52,662 --> 00:30:54,484
knew the history of this film

342
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:58,830
and they have taken it on themselves
not to pass on that information to us.

343
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:00,386
Purposefully.

344
00:31:00,464 --> 00:31:03,063
Well, at least, not on me,
and l assume not the two of you.

345
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,274
True?

346
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,504
No. Uh, absolutely.

347
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,366
Nobody told me anything.

348
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,996
No. Me neither.

349
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:14,398
Uh, I thought this was
an original script.

350
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:17,175
Yeah, well...

351
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,905
Anyway, the film
was never finished.

352
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:25,296
Something happened before
the film was finished.

353
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:30,421
I-- I don't understand.
Why wasn't it finished?

354
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:36,016
Well, after the characters
had been filming for some time...

355
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:39,562
they discovered something...

356
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:42,216
in-- in--

357
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:44,828
something insi--
inside the story.

358
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:47,807
Please. Kingsley.

359
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:50,422
The-- The two leads...

360
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:53,024
were murdered.

361
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:05,054
It was based
on a Polish gypsy folktale.

362
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:08,367
The title in German was
Vier Sieben--

363
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:10,303
Four Seven.

364
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:13,709
And it was said to be cursed.

365
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,995
So it turned out to be.

366
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,102
What?

367
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:34,387
Did you understand what I said?

368
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:38,042
I don't understand.

369
00:32:38,052 --> 00:32:39,766
Hmm, you don't speak Polish.

370
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:41,611
No.

371
00:32:42,613 --> 00:32:44,132
Half of it...

372
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:49,717
I-- I think she understands
more than she lets on.

373
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:52,183
But l don't speak it, so...

374
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:03,902
Take a seat.

375
00:33:12,268 --> 00:33:13,441
Now...

376
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,947
what's this all about?

377
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:26,573
I've been hypnotized,
or something.

378
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:28,905
Hypnotized...

379
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,911
l'm gonna...

380
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:38,952
I'm-- I'm gonna...

381
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,750
I'm gonna kill someone.

382
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:48,838
Oh, yeah?
Who you gonna kill?

383
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:53,200
I don't know.

384
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:00,378
Who hypnotized you?

385
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,455
I-- I saw him looking at me
once when l--

386
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:10,241
when l looked
around the bar.

387
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:15,609
He then moved his hands.

388
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,626
And he-- he said that l...

389
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:24,550
that I would know who it was.

390
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:27,887
How are you gonna kill
this person?

391
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,862
With a screwdriver.

392
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:04,381
Your wife?

393
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:11,536
Oh, I've been with her since
l was a little boy.

394
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:13,907
A little boy?

395
00:35:17,263 --> 00:35:19,182
Nothin' little about you now...

396
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,868
as far as l've heard, that is.

397
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:31,066
Why are you doin' this?

398
00:35:31,723 --> 00:35:33,193
Doin' what?

399
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,192
Don't play dumb with me, Billy.

400
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:41,776
I got a husband...

401
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,504
You got a wife
and two kids.

402
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:49,304
Why are you doin' this?

403
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,607
'Cause l never met you before.

404
00:35:55,104 --> 00:35:56,580
What?

405
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:00,050
I didn't know you before.

406
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:06,243
I didn't ever...
have this feeling.

407
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:10,565
You have it, too.

408
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:14,911
Don't you?

409
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:21,794
I can't afford to, Billy.

410
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:28,464
All l see from this
is blue tomorrows.

411
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:35,939
Cut it, cut it.

412
00:36:36,316 --> 00:36:38,607
-We're down.
-Cut. Cut.

413
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,044
That was brilliant.
We're moving on.

414
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,578
Check the gate please.
The Camera reloads.

415
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:48,163
-Good, good.
-We move on to 27 before lunch.

416
00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:51,029
-Did you feel good about it?
-Yeah, l felt great.

417
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:53,324
So we're gonna leave
this lovely weather?

418
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:59,883
-Freddie, do you have an ashtray there?
-I had one...

419
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:17,206
Going well?

420
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:19,743
Very well.
Thank you, Freddie.

421
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,587
Very enjoyable.

422
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:26,256
"Enjoyable", yes,
that's the word.

423
00:37:28,169 --> 00:37:30,609
Are you enjoying yourself,
Freddie?

424
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:37,899
Well... there's a vast
network, right?

425
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:40,378
An ocean of possibilities.

426
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,518
I like dogs.

427
00:37:45,652 --> 00:37:49,021
I used to raise rabbits.
l've always loved animals...

428
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:51,461
their nature...

429
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:53,581
how they think...

430
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:57,915
I have seen dogs reason
their way out of problems,

431
00:37:58,052 --> 00:38:02,155
watched them think through the
trickiest situations.

432
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:06,267
Do you have a couple of bucks
l could borrow?

433
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,557
I've got this damn landlord.

434
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,737
Thanks.

435
00:38:26,544 --> 00:38:28,384
I got a lot of nerve, l know.

436
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:34,588
Seems like only yesterday that
l was carrying my own weight.

437
00:38:35,894 --> 00:38:36,896
Yeah.

438
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,961
-It's the, uh, 90 year old niece.
-Yeah?

439
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:17,817
Ever since we went into
pre-production, she's been

440
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:20,285
fascinated by Smithy.

441
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,697
Keeps going on and on
about Smithy.

442
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,490
Asking in that...

443
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:29,328
ancient
foreign voice of hers...

444
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:32,741
"Who is playing Smithy?"

445
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:58,183
Piotrek?
Where did everyone go?

446
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:03,512
I'm Sorry. He's taken...
Mr. Berk upstairs.

447
00:40:11,235 --> 00:40:12,709
All right.

448
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:36,023
I'm listening to you, but...

449
00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:37,736
I don't hear you.

450
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:42,412
I'm not excatly sure
what you're getting at.

451
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:45,584
I am going to put
my arm around you.

452
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:51,072
I want to hold you close.
You don't mind that, do you?

453
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:55,795
What do you mean?

454
00:40:56,035 --> 00:40:58,993
Well, sometimes people don't say
exactly what they mean,

455
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:01,868
and you have been guilty of
this all evening.

456
00:41:03,507 --> 00:41:04,731
Yeah.

457
00:41:07,325 --> 00:41:09,096
Now l'll tell you something,

458
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:11,067
and l will mean

459
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:13,312
everything l say.

460
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,808
My wife is not a free agent.

461
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:21,350
I don't allow her that.

462
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:24,650
The bonds of marriage
are real bonds.

463
00:41:24,856 --> 00:41:26,064
The vows we take,

464
00:41:26,237 --> 00:41:30,438
we honor...
and enforce them...

465
00:41:30,477 --> 00:41:34,259
for ourselves...
by ourselves, or...

466
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:39,223
if necessary...
they're enforced for us.

467
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:41,916
Either way, she is...

468
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,840
...bound.

469
00:41:44,244 --> 00:41:46,352
Do you understand this?

470
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:55,059
There are consequences
to one's actions.

471
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:59,673
And there would, for certain,
be consequences to...

472
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,493
wrong actions.

473
00:42:03,123 --> 00:42:06,577
Dark, they would be, and...

474
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:09,007
inescapable.

475
00:42:11,835 --> 00:42:14,878
Why instigate a need to suffer?

476
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:43,607
Yeah. Yes. Look.
Bucky Jay, are you there?

477
00:42:43,756 --> 00:42:45,916
-Is-- Is he-- Is he up there?
-He's there, yeah.

478
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:48,247
I-- I think we-- we haven't
still got the 2K

479
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,863
quite in the right place.

480
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,668
I-- I think l'd say up 2 feet.
You'd know better than me.

481
00:42:53,346 --> 00:42:55,086
But, uh, it's still...

482
00:42:55,295 --> 00:42:57,996
Boss, you want that 2K down?

483
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:00,617
You want it down?

484
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:04,532
Yeah. Uh, l'd say about...
2 foot down, Bucky.

485
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:07,476
How far do you want it
to go down?

486
00:43:08,012 --> 00:43:09,349
Yeah, a bit-- a bit more.

487
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:12,203
-Keep...
-No. How far?

488
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:13,993
Another foot, Bucky.

489
00:43:14,106 --> 00:43:16,702
I haven't even-- I haven't
even touched it yet!

490
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:19,438
Well, then put it 2 foot
from where it is--

491
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:22,599
No, a foot down
from where it is now, Bucky.

492
00:43:22,846 --> 00:43:24,948
-How much?
-What?

493
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:26,625
Got it, boss!

494
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:32,802
Uh, Bucky, l-- Bucky, just lower
it 2 foot, would you?

495
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:34,761
From there.

496
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,408
No, Bucky.
It's going up.

497
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:39,409
I want it down, Bucky.
2 foot lower.

498
00:43:39,532 --> 00:43:42,011
First goddamn time
I--  I had a cramp!

499
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,276
Just a minute,
l'm getting on it...

500
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:48,039
-He's got issues with his wife.
-Yeah. Okay.

501
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:50,607
Thank you, Bucky.

502
00:43:51,157 --> 00:43:53,600
-Can we have someone else do...
-Let me go talk to him...

503
00:43:55,526 --> 00:43:57,920
Uh, just, uh...
relax for a minute.

504
00:43:58,985 --> 00:44:00,479
Yeah. Okay.

505
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:06,134
Listen-- Okay, the medic--

506
00:44:06,258 --> 00:44:07,758
the medic's gonna see him,
check it out,

507
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:08,767
see what's going on,
'cause it just--

508
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:10,515
-he's not acting right.
-Yeah, but who's--

509
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:12,352
If he was on anything,
I'd kick him right off the set.

510
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,512
-Phil's on it.
-Okay.

511
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:15,471
Phil-- Phil's in--
We've got Phil up there now.

512
00:44:15,505 --> 00:44:17,466
Bucky Jay's gonna take
a little coffee break.

513
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:20,520
Please, guys, let's work on
these lighting cues, all right?

514
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,464
We need to work together...

515
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:24,884
We're almost lit.
Couple of minutes.

516
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:30,139
All right, Tim and Sally.
The five-minute warning.

517
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:33,663
Last looks on first team, please.
Five-minute warning.

518
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,359
Lockups, go to place, please.
Lockups in place.

519
00:44:41,968 --> 00:44:43,853
I'm headin' out.
You need anythin'?

520
00:44:46,122 --> 00:44:48,467
Oh, quittin' time already?

521
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:50,495
Past.

522
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:58,039
Wanna stay for a drink?

523
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:01,969
-Nah, l'm late for gym.
-Gym?

524
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,304
Is that with a 'G' or a 'J'?

525
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:09,087
Oh, that's original.

526
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:10,619
'G'.

527
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:15,341
What do you do...

528
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,403
...at the gym?

529
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:19,794
I exercise.

530
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,424
Why would you do that?

531
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:24,916
See ya.

532
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:29,616
You won't stay for
one little drink?

533
00:45:30,217 --> 00:45:32,827
I'm so lonely...

534
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,550
Oh, poor small infant child...

535
00:45:39,687 --> 00:45:41,715
One?

536
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:47,899
Damn.

537
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,470
Will there be anything else?

538
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,703
-No, thank you, James.
-My pleasure.

539
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:26,143
Do you wanna stay for dinner?

540
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:29,654
Maybe.

541
00:46:30,146 --> 00:46:31,784
I think you should.

542
00:46:32,951 --> 00:46:34,792
You do, huh?

543
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:37,338
I really do.

544
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,330
This is a nice drink.

545
00:46:47,617 --> 00:46:49,959
Nice fire.

546
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,778
Wife and children gone...

547
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:01,453
You talk too much.

548
00:47:04,393 --> 00:47:06,429
So sorry, baby.

549
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,484
Don't ruin this...

550
00:47:16,695 --> 00:47:18,933
There's nothing to ruin, Billy.

551
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:34,691
And cut.

552
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,764
We cut, we cut.
Check the gate.

553
00:47:42,577 --> 00:47:43,793
That's it?

554
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,274
Here we are. I was right.

555
00:47:47,404 --> 00:47:48,747
Didn't anyone else read
the script?

556
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:51,088
The light should fade after
Billy's line: "Do you see?"

557
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,123
Look.

558
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:56,026
-Well?
All right, all right.

559
00:47:56,156 --> 00:47:57,392
Uh, we go again, please!

560
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,254
Back to 1 everybody!

561
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:08,498
It was a car.

562
00:48:08,692 --> 00:48:11,518
No, it was a click, Al.
It wasn't a car, it was a click.

563
00:48:11,964 --> 00:48:14,247
Guys on lockups outside,
can we work on that, please?

564
00:48:14,615 --> 00:48:17,275
I-- Really, I can't have cars going by.
I thought we had, uh, ITC.

565
00:48:17,565 --> 00:48:19,156
I don't think it was a car.
I think it was a click.

566
00:48:19,172 --> 00:48:21,767
It's something in the wire... I don't
know what-- will you pick that up?

567
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,017
Thanks.
I've got a lot of nerve, l know.

568
00:48:31,531 --> 00:48:35,076
Seems like only yesterday
l was carrying my own weight.

569
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:38,321
Thanks, Devon.

570
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:39,989
My pleasure.

571
00:48:42,472 --> 00:48:44,868
This is exactly what we need.

572
00:48:53,007 --> 00:48:55,761
-Camera department, you guys ready?
-Yep. Camera's ready.

573
00:48:55,907 --> 00:48:57,013
Ready to give it a go, sir?

574
00:48:57,048 --> 00:48:59,415
-Can l have some more coffee?
-Yeah. Coffee coming in.

575
00:49:03,252 --> 00:49:06,663
After shooting, do you want to go
get something to eat with me?

576
00:49:14,526 --> 00:49:17,526
I'll bet you know a cute little
ltalian resaurant--

577
00:49:18,968 --> 00:49:20,748
tucked away...

578
00:49:21,064 --> 00:49:24,080
...private,
great food.

579
00:49:26,265 --> 00:49:28,456
I do!

580
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:33,144
How did you know that?

581
00:49:34,665 --> 00:49:37,249
Doesn't that sound nice?

582
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,816
They're ready for you.

583
00:49:47,874 --> 00:49:49,839
I'll be just a minute.

584
00:50:02,974 --> 00:50:05,257
I'll see you after the shoot.

585
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:14,912
-Good luck, everyone.
-Playback.

586
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:16,860
And action!

587
00:50:58,007 --> 00:50:59,813
Billy...

588
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:13,763
If that's what you want...

589
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:23,898
I won't fall in love with you.

590
00:51:48,695 --> 00:51:49,963
And cut!

591
00:51:51,832 --> 00:51:53,800
We got it. You two happy?

592
00:52:11,187 --> 00:52:12,476
What?

593
00:52:13,712 --> 00:52:15,216
I don't know.

594
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:19,055
Tell me.

595
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:23,322
What?

596
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,168
Something's happened.

597
00:52:28,037 --> 00:52:29,744
I think my husband
knows about you...

598
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,395
about us.

599
00:52:31,967 --> 00:52:35,206
He'll kill you...
and me.

600
00:52:35,628 --> 00:52:36,604
He'll...

601
00:52:39,595 --> 00:52:40,998
Damn!

602
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:43,827
This sounds like
dialogue from our script!

603
00:52:44,424 --> 00:52:45,807
Cut. Cut it.

604
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,895
What's going on?

605
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:51,069
What?

606
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:53,221
What the
bloody hell's going on?

607
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:13,127
And we just don't know
the actual real reasons

608
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:15,384
why this film wasn't finished.

609
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:18,308
Now, you know some stories.

610
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:21,773
But stories are stories.
Hollywood is full of them.

611
00:53:22,406 --> 00:53:23,186
Thank God.

612
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:25,249
In this case, the same thing--

613
00:53:25,397 --> 00:53:28,300
stories which grew
out of imagination.

614
00:53:29,217 --> 00:53:32,359
And we're surrounded by these
screwball stories every day.

615
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,937
And they shouldn't be taken
as truth or given credence...

616
00:53:37,338 --> 00:53:40,658
and jeopardize
Nikki's performance.

617
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,153
Unless the stories are true.

618
00:53:44,278 --> 00:53:45,048
Devon...

619
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:52,593
There is absolutely no proof

620
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:56,460
that anyting bad happened
around this film.

621
00:54:19,701 --> 00:54:21,450
-You feel that?
-Yeah.

622
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:28,440
You move like that again
and I'll come.

623
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:31,163
Okay.
Wait. Stop. Stop, baby.

624
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,493
Oh God. Oh, yeah.

625
00:54:33,606 --> 00:54:34,938
Just do it one more--
Oh, yeah.

626
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,352
-Oh, God.
-Yeah.

627
00:54:36,352 --> 00:54:38,658
-Oh, God damn!
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:41,146
Okay.

629
00:54:42,286 --> 00:54:43,326
Our first time...

630
00:54:43,453 --> 00:54:45,341
-Fuckin' this good.
-You're talking through the whole thing.

631
00:54:45,438 --> 00:54:46,392
Oh, please...

632
00:54:46,394 --> 00:54:48,641
Hey!
You talk too fuckin' much.

633
00:54:49,905 --> 00:54:52,514
-Are you gonna talk through this whole thing?
-Oh, God...

634
00:54:52,632 --> 00:54:53,665
Stop.

635
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:57,758
Shh...

636
00:54:59,102 --> 00:55:00,669
Look at me...

637
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:21,205
You remember...

638
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:23,211
rembember that night...

639
00:55:23,374 --> 00:55:26,198
when I said that thing...
about it bein' a--

640
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,617
-Oh, you feel that?
-Yeah.

641
00:55:35,562 --> 00:55:36,753
Oh, remember--

642
00:55:36,882 --> 00:55:38,494
remember I told you...

643
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,635
about that thing,
this thing that happened?

644
00:55:44,144 --> 00:55:46,314
It's a story that
happened yesterday,

645
00:55:46,867 --> 00:55:49,039
but l know it's tomorrow.

646
00:55:49,874 --> 00:55:51,717
That doesn't make sense.

647
00:55:52,193 --> 00:55:53,281
It was that scene...

648
00:55:53,444 --> 00:55:55,100
that we did yesterday,

649
00:55:55,234 --> 00:55:57,315
when I'm gettin' groceries for you
with your car.

650
00:55:57,793 --> 00:56:00,740
And it was in that alley,
and I parked the car.

651
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,513
There's always parking there.

652
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:04,245
So there I am...

653
00:56:04,347 --> 00:56:05,420
What?

654
00:56:06,149 --> 00:56:07,463
Sue, damn!

655
00:56:10,155 --> 00:56:12,003
It's a scene we did yesterday.

656
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,702
You weren't in it.

657
00:56:14,253 --> 00:56:15,956
That one when
I'm in the alley...

658
00:56:16,112 --> 00:56:18,720
I'm going to get groceries
for you... with your car...

659
00:56:18,982 --> 00:56:21,555
and I park there 'cause
there's always parking...

660
00:56:22,042 --> 00:56:23,293
You know the one.

661
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:25,207
I see this writing on metal.

662
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:30,093
And l start rememberin' something...
I'm rememberin'...

663
00:56:32,611 --> 00:56:36,186
This whole thing starts floodin' in...
this whole memory.

664
00:56:36,622 --> 00:56:40,401
I start to remember...
And I-- I don't know...

665
00:56:41,043 --> 00:56:42,432
I don't know what it is...

666
00:56:44,907 --> 00:56:47,105
It's me. Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

667
00:56:50,521 --> 00:56:52,501
It's not makin' any sense.

668
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,119
What is this, Sue?

669
00:56:56,828 --> 00:57:00,177
It's me, Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

670
00:57:01,062 --> 00:57:02,904
Look at me, you fucker!

671
00:57:14,615 --> 00:57:16,895
Please, please...

672
00:57:17,749 --> 00:57:18,722
Please...

673
00:57:18,915 --> 00:57:20,774
Look at me.

674
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:25,097
Please...

675
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:22,197
"Oh, shit."

676
00:59:24,137 --> 00:59:25,908
"Look in the other room."

677
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:28,863
-What the hell is that?
-Freddie!

678
00:59:29,343 --> 00:59:31,009
No, somebody's over there.

679
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:39,062
This stage is supposed
to be ours and ours alone.

680
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:45,579
Let's have a look.

681
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:50,571
-I'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

682
01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:50,329
Billy!

683
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,506
Billy!

684
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,466
Billy!

685
01:01:31,094 --> 01:01:32,339
Billy!

686
01:01:36,744 --> 01:01:38,434
Billy!

687
01:01:42,109 --> 01:01:43,919
Billy!

688
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:50,028
Billy!

689
01:06:28,523 --> 01:06:29,679
Who the hell are you?

690
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,268
Hey!

691
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:39,189
Look at us and tell us
if you've known us before.

692
01:06:41,851 --> 01:06:43,711
There was a man...

693
01:06:43,883 --> 01:06:45,664
I once knew.

694
01:06:49,562 --> 01:06:54,051
I so liked to spread my legs
wide for him.

695
01:06:55,992 --> 01:06:59,532
Did he do that thing...
you know...

696
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:02,163
that little shaking thing,

697
01:07:02,382 --> 01:07:03,819
while he was...

698
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:06,148
you know.

699
01:07:08,956 --> 01:07:11,265
Wasn't that great?

700
01:07:11,754 --> 01:07:13,886
Yeah.

701
01:07:20,933 --> 01:07:22,350
I'd let him do....

702
01:07:22,426 --> 01:07:23,958
...anything.

703
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:33,890
Yeah.

704
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,451
Yeah.

705
01:07:49,491 --> 01:07:51,366
Strange...

706
01:07:52,794 --> 01:07:54,758
...what love does.

707
01:07:57,085 --> 01:08:00,242
So... strange.

708
01:08:07,885 --> 01:08:09,323
In the future...

709
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:16,430
-You will be dreaming...
-In a kind of sleep.

710
01:08:18,587 --> 01:08:20,312
When you open your eyes...

711
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:24,050
someone familiar will be there.

712
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:30,384
# Strange #

713
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:37,949
# What love does #

714
01:08:42,768 --> 01:08:48,526
# So strange #

715
01:08:49,822 --> 01:08:54,723
# Uh-huh,
what loves does #

716
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,760
# So strange #

717
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,567
# What love does #

718
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:09,521
# When you're all alone #

719
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,830
This is the street.

720
01:09:12,944 --> 01:09:15,721
# Strange... #

721
01:09:16,954 --> 01:09:19,094
Do you want to see?

722
01:09:29,953 --> 01:09:33,290
Just down the way.

723
01:10:04,889 --> 01:10:06,614
Do you want...

724
01:10:07,743 --> 01:10:09,420
...to see?

725
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:16,658
You have to be wearing
the watch.

726
01:10:18,387 --> 01:10:21,892
You light a cigarette.

727
01:10:22,421 --> 01:10:28,877
You push and turn
right through the silk.

728
01:10:31,965 --> 01:10:36,036
You fold the silk over...

729
01:10:36,891 --> 01:10:46,130
And then... you look...
through the hole.

730
01:12:46,978 --> 01:12:48,713
Breakfast!

731
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,545
Hello?

732
01:14:55,654 --> 01:14:58,477
I didn't mean anything by
that. I just asked a question.

733
01:14:59,071 --> 01:15:01,066
Why did you ask
if it means nothing?

734
01:15:01,211 --> 01:15:03,219
Whatever you want,
is that it?

735
01:15:03,339 --> 01:15:05,545
No, whatever you want.

736
01:15:06,508 --> 01:15:08,885
Oh... Now it's me!

737
01:15:09,487 --> 01:15:11,343
Always you.

738
01:15:12,315 --> 01:15:17,512
Lie to me, but don't lie
to yourself. So sly...

739
01:15:18,623 --> 01:15:21,724
-Don't push me!
-I'll push you to hell!

740
01:15:21,921 --> 01:15:23,307
Stop it!

741
01:15:23,682 --> 01:15:26,650
I can't give you children,
I know that...

742
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:31,227
-Are you listening to me?
-I'm going out now.

743
01:15:32,232 --> 01:15:36,738
I'm not who you think I am!
I'll never let you have her!

744
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:46,603
Never!

745
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,464
Never!

746
01:16:13,426 --> 01:16:16,498
-Excuse me, do you know the time?
-9:45.

747
01:16:17,055 --> 01:16:18,388
Thank you.

748
01:18:43,855 --> 01:18:46,084
I don't really understand
what I'm doin' here.

749
01:18:51,826 --> 01:18:54,621
That's one hell of a fuckin'
climb gettin' up here.

750
01:18:58,387 --> 01:19:00,849
So I was told
you could help me.

751
01:19:13,171 --> 01:19:15,030
I guess I'll just
tell you the thing.

752
01:19:16,722 --> 01:19:18,931
I'm just gonna
catch my breath...

753
01:19:38,418 --> 01:19:40,213
There was this man...

754
01:19:41,755 --> 01:19:43,673
I once knew.

755
01:19:46,137 --> 01:19:47,910
His name was...

756
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,966
Doesn't matter
what his name was.

757
01:19:54,701 --> 01:19:56,696
A lot of guys change.

758
01:19:58,337 --> 01:20:00,999
They don't change,
but they reveal.

759
01:20:02,938 --> 01:20:05,882
In time, they reveal
what they really are.

760
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,174
You know what l mean?

761
01:20:11,109 --> 01:20:13,018
It's an old story.

762
01:20:16,252 --> 01:20:18,016
Well, this guy...

763
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,089
he revealed something.

764
01:20:23,635 --> 01:20:25,599
Lookin' back on it...

765
01:20:27,879 --> 01:20:30,760
all along
it was being revealed.

766
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:36,841
He was plannin' something...

767
01:20:38,322 --> 01:20:40,990
plannin' somethin'
with me in mind.

768
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:55,870
When l get mad,
I really get mad.

769
01:20:59,258 --> 01:21:02,177
I gouged a man's eye out
when I was 15 once.

770
01:21:02,264 --> 01:21:03,801
He was tryin' to rape me.

771
01:21:03,836 --> 01:21:06,753
I mean, the fucker had it out.
He was pushin' my legs apart.

772
01:21:09,215 --> 01:21:11,019
I got a finger
in his eye socket.

773
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:14,491
Pretty quick, rape was
quite a long way off his mind.

774
01:21:17,148 --> 01:21:19,915
He was cryin'
and screamin' like a baby.

775
01:21:20,825 --> 01:21:23,393
"What a fuckin' man you are",
I said.

776
01:21:27,325 --> 01:21:29,328
There was goo.

777
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,377
But he could still see
me with the one eye...

778
01:21:33,448 --> 01:21:35,256
see me comin' at him...

779
01:21:35,823 --> 01:21:38,653
grabbin' his nuts
and tearin' at 'em.

780
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:42,164
He seen that, all right,
and felt it, too.

781
01:21:43,104 --> 01:21:46,292
He was screamin' and wailin'
like a little baby.

782
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:50,947
Sittin' in the corner
and cryin'...

783
01:21:51,597 --> 01:21:54,664
moanin' and huggin' his nuts
till the ambulance come.

784
01:21:56,696 --> 01:21:59,678
The ambulance guys...
they say:

785
01:21:59,811 --> 01:22:01,627
"What the fuck
happened here?"

786
01:22:04,478 --> 01:22:05,837
I say:

787
01:22:06,368 --> 01:22:09,896
"He come to reapin' what he
been sowin', that's what".

788
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,062
They say:

789
01:22:12,756 --> 01:22:16,048
"Fucker been sowin'
some kind of heavy shit".

790
01:22:57,606 --> 01:22:59,561
It's the shits...

791
01:23:03,302 --> 01:23:05,934
I really thought you
would last, you two.

792
01:23:08,606 --> 01:23:10,569
I saw it coming...

793
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,190
Sorry, I did!

794
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:19,269
You're full of shit, Dori.

795
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,163
Sucks...

796
01:23:30,212 --> 01:23:31,962
He was the one...

797
01:23:33,053 --> 01:23:36,085
I really thought he was,
you know?

798
01:23:40,623 --> 01:23:43,209
So what?
He's gone.

799
01:23:45,589 --> 01:23:47,601
Find someone else.

800
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,969
It's not easy
when you feel like shit...

801
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,444
Oh... baby.

802
01:24:03,162 --> 01:24:04,887
Tonight we'll change that.

803
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,047
Yeah. Tonight
will be good.

804
01:24:08,637 --> 01:24:11,420
There's always a chance
with tits like yours, Kari.

805
01:24:13,012 --> 01:24:14,492
Thanks.

806
01:24:17,572 --> 01:24:19,219
Tits.

807
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:21,721
Tits and ass.

808
01:24:25,456 --> 01:24:29,194
# You gotta swing your hips now #

809
01:24:32,971 --> 01:24:37,055
These... are gonna bring 'em
in like Flynn.

810
01:24:38,839 --> 01:24:42,035
-Pretty.
-Let me see 'em.

811
01:24:45,236 --> 01:24:48,839
They are pretty baby,
Nice.

812
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:52,687
Sweet.

813
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,382
Thanks, guys.

814
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:04,826
# Everybody's doin'
a brand new dance now #

815
01:25:05,245 --> 01:25:08,253
# Come on, baby
Do the locomotion #

816
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:11,910
# I know you'll get to like it
If you give it a chance now #

817
01:25:12,314 --> 01:25:15,369
# Come on, baby
Do the locomotion #

818
01:25:15,602 --> 01:25:18,704
# My little baby sister
can do it with ease #

819
01:25:18,883 --> 01:25:22,292
# It's easier than learnin'
your ABCs #

820
01:25:22,628 --> 01:25:27,003
# So come on, come on
Do the locomotion with me #

821
01:25:27,393 --> 01:25:30,298
# You've gotta swing
your hips now #

822
01:25:30,912 --> 01:25:32,511
# Come on, baby #

823
01:25:32,764 --> 01:25:33,394
# Jump up-- #

824
01:25:43,783 --> 01:25:45,911
I was tryin' to
save us some money.

825
01:25:46,062 --> 01:25:47,106
Oh.

826
01:25:47,878 --> 01:25:49,312
So now we're rich...

827
01:25:51,697 --> 01:25:53,875
Because I drink this
piss called beer.

828
01:25:56,309 --> 01:25:57,988
What is the money for...

829
01:25:58,675 --> 01:26:01,610
if it won't bring
something likeable?

830
01:26:19,391 --> 01:26:21,662
I'm pregnant.

831
01:26:24,797 --> 01:26:25,707
Oh.

832
01:26:26,987 --> 01:26:30,034
You're a funny one.

833
01:26:30,904 --> 01:26:32,994
I am pregnant.

834
01:26:40,976 --> 01:26:42,680
What is this?

835
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:47,248
You don't seem
too happy about it.

836
01:26:55,202 --> 01:26:57,251
You're pregnant?

837
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:08,265
What is it?

838
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:10,707
What's wrong?

839
01:27:17,419 --> 01:27:20,081
It just has come
as a shock to me.

840
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,213
# Oh, yeah, yeah #

841
01:27:29,339 --> 01:27:31,800
# At last #

842
01:27:34,705 --> 01:27:38,732
# The skies above are blue #

843
01:27:42,543 --> 01:27:47,291
# My heart
was wrapped up in clover #

844
01:27:50,596 --> 01:27:54,890
# The night I looked at you #

845
01:27:59,763 --> 01:28:02,080
# I found a dream #

846
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:06,903
# That I could speak to... #

847
01:28:41,165 --> 01:28:42,429
Hello?

848
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:46,068
Hello.

849
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:17,211
Billy?

850
01:29:41,357 --> 01:29:44,212
I seen a man come at me
with a crowbar once.

851
01:29:46,419 --> 01:29:48,900
I guess he figured
I was two-timin' him.

852
01:29:52,113 --> 01:29:53,590
I was comin' home.

853
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:56,071
We were shacked up
at the time.

854
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:04,783
He was waitin' for me
in the half-light.

855
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,663
Waitin' for me
to come home.

856
01:30:11,901 --> 01:30:14,864
I guess he'd worked himself
into some kind of frenzy.

857
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,405
I opened the fuckin' door...

858
01:30:19,507 --> 01:30:22,798
and l seen this fuckin' shape
burst out of the chair....

859
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:26,048
and a crowbar goin' up.

860
01:30:26,802 --> 01:30:29,896
I scream... and turn...

861
01:30:32,162 --> 01:30:35,689
Fuckin' crowbar comes down...

862
01:30:36,225 --> 01:30:39,965
...smashin' in that fuckin' door,
cheap piece of shit...

863
01:30:40,909 --> 01:30:43,308
It just splinters
into a thousand pieces,

864
01:30:43,383 --> 01:30:45,837
like it was glass,
shit flyin' everywhere.

865
01:30:47,226 --> 01:30:49,417
I don't take this kind
of behavior.

866
01:30:55,042 --> 01:30:57,526
I seen what
this fucker is up to.

867
01:30:58,156 --> 01:30:59,725
Bam!

868
01:31:00,304 --> 01:31:03,030
I kick him in the nuts
so hard,

869
01:31:03,064 --> 01:31:05,790
they go crawlin' up inside
his brain for refuge.

870
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:07,904
He goes down
like a 2$ whore.

871
01:31:09,122 --> 01:31:10,612
Cryin' and shit,

872
01:31:10,629 --> 01:31:14,632
tellin' me how he's never done
nothin' but love me bullshit...

873
01:31:17,693 --> 01:31:20,806
Were you, in fact,
seeing another man?

874
01:31:23,719 --> 01:31:26,560
I was screwin' a couple guys
for drinks, no big deal.

875
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,171
This one guy,
he was kinda cute.

876
01:31:36,369 --> 01:31:38,431
Fucker had a dick
like a rhinoceros.

877
01:31:38,644 --> 01:31:41,491
He'd fuck the shit out
of you, I tell you what...

878
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:48,776
He'd buy me a couple
drinks after.

879
01:31:53,215 --> 01:31:55,374
We'd talk.

880
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:58,539
He'd tell me about
the town he grew up in.

881
01:31:59,026 --> 01:32:01,175
All the little girls
he'd fuck.

882
01:32:03,736 --> 01:32:06,902
There was a chemical factory
in this town and, uh....

883
01:32:08,415 --> 01:32:12,279
Tellin' me it was puttin' so much shit
in the air, you couldn't think straight.

884
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:17,701
It got to a lot of the people.

885
01:32:19,824 --> 01:32:22,573
There was a lot of
crazy shit goin' on there.

886
01:32:24,759 --> 01:32:27,215
People havin' weird dreams,
and...

887
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:32,850
seein' things that wasn't there.

888
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,079
So one time,
this one little girl...

889
01:32:41,404 --> 01:32:43,866
She was starin' off
at somethin' one time...

890
01:32:44,368 --> 01:32:46,441
Starts screamin'.

891
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:50,879
They... the...
people hangin' around,

892
01:32:51,029 --> 01:32:54,520
they come to her and ask her
what's wrong, and, uh....

893
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:01,049
She says she sees
the end of the world.

894
01:33:03,534 --> 01:33:06,530
all fire, and smoke
and blood rain.

895
01:33:07,116 --> 01:33:09,737
You know, like they say...

896
01:33:11,701 --> 01:33:14,425
The wailin' and
the gnashin' of teeth.

897
01:33:18,946 --> 01:33:20,630
Hey!

898
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:25,442
Look at me...

899
01:33:26,206 --> 01:33:29,596
And tell me if you've
known me before!

900
01:33:32,391 --> 01:33:33,326
Yes.

901
01:33:34,557 --> 01:33:36,356
We will do that.

902
01:33:48,528 --> 01:33:51,172
Where's the paper towels?

903
01:34:11,157 --> 01:34:12,126
Oh, they're...

904
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:16,193
behind you,
on the table.

905
01:34:26,895 --> 01:34:32,484
Cast out...
this wicked dream...

906
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:37,957
that has seized my heart.

907
01:36:01,852 --> 01:36:03,701
Who is she?

908
01:36:09,392 --> 01:36:11,068
Who is she?

909
01:36:42,607 --> 01:36:45,407
I almost didn't recognize you.

910
01:36:47,445 --> 01:36:49,615
You startled me.

911
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:56,183
Strange...
to find you on the street.

912
01:37:01,501 --> 01:37:03,764
You seem upset.

913
01:37:04,554 --> 01:37:05,779
Are you?

914
01:37:06,996 --> 01:37:08,957
Should l be?

915
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:15,582
-No, but...
-So l shouldn't be?

916
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,241
No.

917
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:21,637
But still, you seem so.

918
01:37:23,248 --> 01:37:25,549
I think you don't recognize me.

919
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:32,194
My manner of being.

920
01:37:34,301 --> 01:37:37,401
That's true.

921
01:37:37,571 --> 01:37:40,611
-You seem different.
-You too.

922
01:37:46,241 --> 01:37:50,687
I'm used to seeing you in
our home, not on the street,

923
01:37:52,521 --> 01:37:55,299
at night.

924
01:37:56,299 --> 01:37:59,298
Me too.

925
01:38:06,416 --> 01:38:09,297
There was a murder.

926
01:38:12,297 --> 01:38:15,496
How awful!

927
01:38:15,826 --> 01:38:19,296
-Where?
-Just down the way.

928
01:38:19,896 --> 01:38:21,533
I think...

929
01:38:22,121 --> 01:38:24,895
...you knew the victim.

930
01:38:26,595 --> 01:38:30,204
-Who was it?
-Don't know the name.

931
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:34,788
But l have seen you
with this person.

932
01:38:38,701 --> 01:38:40,735
-You have?
-Yes.

933
01:38:42,893 --> 01:38:46,293
I think l've seen
the two of you together.

934
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:57,291
That's awful.

935
01:39:24,665 --> 01:39:26,321
Who are those people?

936
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,965
Hey, hello!

937
01:39:29,489 --> 01:39:31,415
It's good to see you.

938
01:39:31,529 --> 01:39:33,182
Come in, come in.

939
01:39:33,348 --> 01:39:35,314
Get some hotdogs.

940
01:39:38,856 --> 01:39:41,047
You said... 3 o'clock.

941
01:39:42,439 --> 01:39:44,526
Yes, that's right.

942
01:39:44,935 --> 01:39:46,596
You're right on time.

943
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:51,781
The situation is
becoming dangerous.

944
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,492
Give me my hammer!

945
01:39:58,668 --> 01:40:00,092
Give-- Give me the--

946
01:40:00,679 --> 01:40:02,485
Give it--
Give me the hammer.

947
01:40:07,777 --> 01:40:09,594
Crazy.

948
01:40:25,097 --> 01:40:28,255
There is no paper.
For the toilet.

949
01:40:28,591 --> 01:40:30,683
There is no paper.

950
01:40:31,251 --> 01:40:34,850
It's under the sink,
in the cupboard.

951
01:40:47,182 --> 01:40:48,643
What?

952
01:40:53,205 --> 01:40:56,104
They are a group that performs
in traveling shows...

953
01:40:56,975 --> 01:40:59,255
in the Baltic region.

954
01:41:01,996 --> 01:41:04,143
What's that got
to do with you?

955
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,940
I will take care
for the animals.

956
01:41:15,926 --> 01:41:19,090
It was said that I have
a way with animals.

957
01:41:28,528 --> 01:41:31,222
Fucker went to some Eastern
Europe shithole...

958
01:41:31,991 --> 01:41:34,109
with the fuckin' circus.

959
01:41:38,371 --> 01:41:40,678
Can you fuckin' believe that?

960
01:41:44,019 --> 01:41:45,687
That circus...

961
01:41:46,111 --> 01:41:50,838
Talk about carnies. Carnies,
gypsies, conmen, you name it.

962
01:41:52,236 --> 01:41:54,831
A real fuckin' ball of shit.

963
01:42:01,405 --> 01:42:03,810
There was this guy
they had working there.

964
01:42:07,471 --> 01:42:09,169
He'd start talkin'...

965
01:42:10,054 --> 01:42:11,890
you know, real regular...

966
01:42:13,173 --> 01:42:15,073
talkin' up the crowd.

967
01:42:15,204 --> 01:42:17,230
They'd start listenin'...

968
01:42:17,357 --> 01:42:19,052
pushin' in closer.

969
01:42:21,456 --> 01:42:24,202
He did some sort of
thing on people.

970
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:30,789
They all called him
The Phantom.

971
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:38,290
He got in a bar room fight
one night...

972
01:42:39,264 --> 01:42:41,261
All the bar was arrested.

973
01:42:41,353 --> 01:42:43,735
A lot of them
fuckin' circus clowns.

974
01:42:47,746 --> 01:42:49,965
So when they take 'em all
down to the station,

975
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:53,163
guess what?

976
01:42:54,525 --> 01:42:56,883
The Phantom's done gone
and disappeared.

977
01:42:57,087 --> 01:42:59,209
This is the kind of
shit I'm talkin' about.

978
01:43:09,323 --> 01:43:12,201
He was a Marine
from North Carolina.

979
01:43:15,559 --> 01:43:17,825
He had a sister
with one leg.

980
01:43:18,396 --> 01:43:22,281
She had a sorta... carved stick
for the other one.

981
01:43:26,902 --> 01:43:29,537
She killed three kids
in the first grade.

982
01:43:30,905 --> 01:43:33,178
This is the kind of shit...

983
01:43:44,782 --> 01:43:46,918
Fuckin' funny.

984
01:43:50,121 --> 01:43:51,990
People.

985
01:43:52,861 --> 01:43:55,523
They all got their
own peculiarities.

986
01:43:56,629 --> 01:43:58,369
Their own way of livin'.

987
01:44:47,392 --> 01:44:49,805
# The end is turnin' #

988
01:44:50,233 --> 01:44:52,121
# Around the bend #

989
01:44:52,232 --> 01:44:55,314
# The world has
at last evolved #

990
01:45:03,202 --> 01:45:05,928
# People are running
in the street #

991
01:45:07,348 --> 01:45:10,316
# And they scream,
their faces white #

992
01:46:16,253 --> 01:46:18,373
And--
And what about school?

993
01:46:18,525 --> 01:46:20,171
One more day.

994
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,715
One more day?

995
01:46:23,201 --> 01:46:24,823
Maybe two.

996
01:46:33,550 --> 01:46:35,314
Susan?

997
01:46:36,581 --> 01:46:38,665
What are you doing here?

998
01:46:43,581 --> 01:46:44,746
What?

999
01:46:45,127 --> 01:46:47,116
I thought you were gone.

1000
01:46:58,011 --> 01:46:59,492
Billy?

1001
01:47:02,243 --> 01:47:03,714
Billy!

1002
01:47:05,667 --> 01:47:06,593
Something's wrong!

1003
01:47:06,881 --> 01:47:09,286
Bad wrong!
Do you feel it?

1004
01:47:15,868 --> 01:47:17,412
Sue?

1005
01:47:17,887 --> 01:47:19,343
Billy...

1006
01:47:20,004 --> 01:47:21,780
Do you love me?

1007
01:47:22,759 --> 01:47:24,336
What?!

1008
01:47:28,431 --> 01:47:29,856
Billy!

1009
01:47:30,314 --> 01:47:31,991
Sue.

1010
01:47:33,347 --> 01:47:37,284
Don't you remember anythin'?
How it was?

1011
01:47:38,938 --> 01:47:40,901
I don't understand
what you're talkin' about.

1012
01:47:43,638 --> 01:47:46,090
Are you listenin'?!

1013
01:47:46,108 --> 01:47:47,817
No.

1014
01:47:49,936 --> 01:47:51,431
You go on, Sue.

1015
01:47:52,228 --> 01:47:54,133
You go on now...

1016
01:47:54,284 --> 01:47:56,297
Would you like me
to call the police?

1017
01:47:56,577 --> 01:47:58,739
No, we can handle this.

1018
01:48:06,347 --> 01:48:07,131
Billy...

1019
01:48:07,278 --> 01:48:09,390
Something's wrong.

1020
01:48:09,574 --> 01:48:11,218
I love you, Billy.

1021
01:48:12,157 --> 01:48:13,777
I've had just about
enough of you.

1022
01:48:17,542 --> 01:48:18,909
I love you.

1023
01:48:21,486 --> 01:48:23,599
Go away, Susan!

1024
01:48:23,761 --> 01:48:25,063
I love you...

1025
01:48:26,861 --> 01:48:28,177
Sue!

1026
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:31,753
I don't care!

1027
01:48:32,403 --> 01:48:33,974
It's something more.

1028
01:48:41,763 --> 01:48:45,162
I don't care...
lt's something more.

1029
01:50:40,562 --> 01:50:41,852
Gordy.

1030
01:50:47,058 --> 01:50:48,741
What do you want?

1031
01:50:52,091 --> 01:50:53,991
Where is he?

1032
01:50:54,415 --> 01:50:58,414
What's the point?
Are you blind? He's gone!

1033
01:51:01,469 --> 01:51:03,119
Everybody?

1034
01:51:06,043 --> 01:51:07,983
Why answer
your stupid question?

1035
01:51:08,146 --> 01:51:10,897
You're nothing!
You've done nothing!

1036
01:51:17,559 --> 01:51:19,253
Where did he go?

1037
01:51:21,811 --> 01:51:27,684
No idea. He talked... mumbled
something about Inland Empire.

1038
01:53:12,989 --> 01:53:16,676
I come about an unpaid bill
that needs payin'.

1039
01:53:22,095 --> 01:53:23,882
All right.

1040
01:53:30,458 --> 01:53:34,534
Do you know the man
who lives here?

1041
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:55,612
Do you know him?

1042
01:53:56,673 --> 01:54:01,507
Yes. What is it?
What do you want?

1043
01:54:06,682 --> 01:54:11,976
It is an unpaid bill
that needs payin'.

1044
01:54:12,782 --> 01:54:18,812
Y-You already said that.
But, uh...

1045
01:54:19,729 --> 01:54:22,603
Do you know the man
who lives next door?

1046
01:54:23,013 --> 01:54:26,002
"Krimp" is the name...

1047
01:54:34,255 --> 01:54:36,860
It was a... funny name.

1048
01:54:37,728 --> 01:54:40,615
They was called "Krimp".

1049
01:55:09,976 --> 01:55:11,834
Hello?

1050
01:56:44,364 --> 01:56:46,311
There's someone there.

1051
01:56:48,225 --> 01:56:50,602
I have to tell you...

1052
01:56:51,502 --> 01:56:53,586
There's someone...

1053
01:57:08,168 --> 01:57:10,080
Do you recognize her?

1054
01:57:15,902 --> 01:57:17,763
I don't see her...

1055
01:57:20,193 --> 01:57:23,028
You understand
she sent for you?

1056
01:57:23,856 --> 01:57:26,011
I don't know where l am...

1057
01:57:38,388 --> 01:57:41,747
-I hear her now...
-Do you see her?

1058
01:57:43,237 --> 01:57:45,218
No.

1059
01:57:46,778 --> 01:57:48,762
It was...

1060
01:57:52,147 --> 01:57:54,124
red...

1061
01:58:00,299 --> 01:58:02,210
You work for someone?

1062
01:58:05,143 --> 01:58:07,187
Yes.

1063
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:11,634
The one she spoke of.

1064
01:58:16,233 --> 01:58:19,396
The one I work for.

1065
01:58:19,451 --> 01:58:22,128
So... you understand.

1066
01:58:25,775 --> 01:58:28,043
The horse was taken...

1067
01:58:29,263 --> 01:58:31,267
to the well...

1068
01:58:47,137 --> 01:58:48,806
Take the pistol.

1069
01:58:51,975 --> 01:58:53,767
Let's go!

1070
01:59:06,053 --> 01:59:08,961
Right away!
It's after midnight!

1071
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:21,320
I am going to find out
one day.

1072
02:00:27,179 --> 02:00:29,077
It was red.

1073
02:00:34,148 --> 02:00:36,086
Where was I?

1074
02:00:41,564 --> 02:00:43,915
This isn't the way it was.

1075
02:00:59,789 --> 02:01:01,971
It was the man
in the green coat.

1076
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:10,105
It had something to do with
the telling of time.

1077
02:02:22,078 --> 02:02:23,860
I'm a whore.

1078
02:02:24,511 --> 02:02:25,932
Uh-huh.

1079
02:02:29,024 --> 02:02:31,095
"Where am I?"

1080
02:02:31,178 --> 02:02:34,444
"I'm afraid"!

1081
02:02:41,727 --> 02:02:43,462
# Black hearts in effigy #

1082
02:02:43,890 --> 02:02:45,889
# We sing the song
that was hated #

1083
02:02:45,919 --> 02:02:47,918
# All dressed in
rag and bones #

1084
02:02:48,061 --> 02:02:50,166
# Sharks smell the blood
that I'm bleedin' #

1085
02:02:50,204 --> 02:02:52,173
# I know there's
somethin' wrong #

1086
02:02:52,290 --> 02:02:54,282
# Might take a fire
to kill it #

1087
02:02:54,623 --> 02:02:56,144
# Might take a hurricane #

1088
02:02:56,602 --> 02:02:58,779
# Don't know
the life that I'm livin' #

1089
02:03:06,146 --> 02:03:07,822
# Black tambourine #

1090
02:03:14,277 --> 02:03:15,841
# Black tambourine #

1091
02:03:19,586 --> 02:03:21,307
# My baby run to me #

1092
02:03:21,689 --> 02:03:23,713
# She lives in
broken-down buildings #

1093
02:03:23,921 --> 02:03:25,553
# Can't pay the rent again #

1094
02:03:25,915 --> 02:03:27,866
# These spider webs
are my home now #

1095
02:03:28,165 --> 02:03:29,742
# And when the sun
goes down #

1096
02:03:30,090 --> 02:03:32,056
# We'll shake and rattle
our bodies #

1097
02:03:32,114 --> 02:03:33,954
# To keep 'em warm at night #

1098
02:03:34,295 --> 02:03:36,354
# My tambourine
is still shakin' #

1099
02:03:43,525 --> 02:03:45,144
# Black tambourine #

1100
02:03:51,945 --> 02:03:53,316
# Black tambourine #

1101
02:04:05,482 --> 02:04:07,340
# Black hearts in effigy #

1102
02:04:07,703 --> 02:04:09,678
# We sing the song
that was hated #

1103
02:04:09,733 --> 02:04:11,589
# All dressed in
rag and bones #

1104
02:04:11,886 --> 02:04:13,841
# Sharks smell the blood
that I'm bleedin' #

1105
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,762
# I know there's
somethin' wrong #

1106
02:04:16,103 --> 02:04:18,065
# Might take a fire
to kill it #

1107
02:04:18,164 --> 02:04:19,976
# Might take a hurricane #

1108
02:04:20,345 --> 02:04:22,503
# Don't know
the life that I'm livin' #

1109
02:04:25,473 --> 02:04:27,657
# Black tambourine #

1110
02:04:33,737 --> 02:04:35,337
# Black tambourine #

1111
02:04:38,008 --> 02:04:41,401
I need to make a collect call.

1112
02:06:00,263 --> 02:06:02,437
Look at me...

1113
02:06:03,397 --> 02:06:06,266
and tell me if you've
known me before...

1114
02:06:46,810 --> 02:06:48,658
Somebody's gonna
fuckin' kill me!

1115
02:06:48,865 --> 02:06:50,469
Somebody's gonna
fuckin' kill me!

1116
02:06:50,994 --> 02:06:52,596
Help me.
Let me in.

1117
02:06:54,513 --> 02:06:56,510
Somebody's gonna
fuckin' kill me!

1118
02:06:57,323 --> 02:06:58,758
You gotta let me in...

1119
02:07:03,787 --> 02:07:07,271
I know that girl... Carolina!
I know Carolina!

1120
02:09:17,661 --> 02:09:22,263
I don't really understand what I'm doing...
It's one hell of a fuckin' climb getting up here...

1121
02:09:25,455 --> 02:09:27,416
There was this man...

1122
02:09:28,829 --> 02:09:30,928
I once knew.

1123
02:09:35,936 --> 02:09:39,570
I'm tryin' to tell you so's
you understand how it went.

1124
02:09:43,128 --> 02:09:45,371
The thing is, I don't know....

1125
02:09:45,446 --> 02:09:48,624
what was before or after.

1126
02:09:54,049 --> 02:09:56,231
I don't know
what's happened first...

1127
02:09:57,133 --> 02:10:00,172
And it's kinda laid
a mind fuck on me.

1128
02:10:11,112 --> 02:10:12,599
My husband...

1129
02:10:12,784 --> 02:10:14,648
he's fuckin' hidin' somethin'.

1130
02:10:16,976 --> 02:10:20,390
He was actin' all fuckin' weird one
night before he left...

1131
02:10:24,888 --> 02:10:28,422
He was talkin' this
foreign talk and...

1132
02:10:29,941 --> 02:10:32,345
tellin' loud fuckin' stories...

1133
02:10:46,206 --> 02:10:47,965
I'm not who you think I am.

1134
02:10:51,605 --> 02:10:53,256
Are you listening to me?

1135
02:10:55,868 --> 02:10:57,683
I know it for a fact.

1136
02:10:59,907 --> 02:11:02,304
I can't father children.

1137
02:11:06,531 --> 02:11:10,273
Like this-- like...
his face all red.

1138
02:11:10,792 --> 02:11:13,121
His eyes buggin' out.

1139
02:11:41,019 --> 02:11:43,027
I figured one day...

1140
02:11:45,587 --> 02:11:47,349
I'd just wake up and...

1141
02:11:47,656 --> 02:11:50,568
find out what the hell yesterday
was all about.

1142
02:11:55,847 --> 02:11:58,633
I'm not too keen on
thinkin' about tomorrow.

1143
02:12:01,774 --> 02:12:04,796
And today's slippin' by.

1144
02:12:22,784 --> 02:12:24,970
I guess after my son died...

1145
02:12:26,477 --> 02:12:28,864
I went into a bad time...

1146
02:12:31,767 --> 02:12:34,198
when I was watchin'
everythin' go around me

1147
02:12:34,298 --> 02:12:36,999
while I was standin'
in the middle...

1148
02:12:42,363 --> 02:12:46,125
watchin' it...
like in a dark theater...

1149
02:12:49,272 --> 02:12:51,957
before they bring
the lights up.

1150
02:12:56,790 --> 02:12:58,704
I'm sittin there...

1151
02:13:00,293 --> 02:13:02,116
wonderin'...

1152
02:13:04,003 --> 02:13:06,524
"How can this be?"

1153
02:13:48,016 --> 02:13:49,372
Hello?

1154
02:13:49,695 --> 02:13:52,513
Yeah. She's still here.

1155
02:13:56,012 --> 02:13:58,348
I don't think it will be
too much longer now.

1156
02:13:59,181 --> 02:14:02,683
Yeah. The horse to the well.

1157
02:14:03,559 --> 02:14:05,000
Yeah.

1158
02:14:06,016 --> 02:14:11,751
Krimp? Yeah, he's around
here someplace. That's for sure.

1159
02:15:09,933 --> 02:15:11,610
What have you been up to?

1160
02:15:12,167 --> 02:15:13,749
Where'd you go?

1161
02:15:16,847 --> 02:15:18,234
Where you been?

1162
02:15:24,358 --> 02:15:25,857
Someone's there!

1163
02:15:29,056 --> 02:15:30,843
Look!

1164
02:15:49,434 --> 02:15:51,233
Hey...

1165
02:15:53,704 --> 02:15:55,818
Watch this move.

1166
02:18:59,405 --> 02:19:02,130
You dyin', lady.

1167
02:19:30,701 --> 02:19:34,145
What you say
about Pomona?

1168
02:19:35,971 --> 02:19:38,314
What you say
about Pomona?

1169
02:19:39,674 --> 02:19:42,102
You asked about the bus.

1170
02:19:44,188 --> 02:19:46,582
Can't get no bus to Pomona.

1171
02:19:48,606 --> 02:19:52,517
You can get the bus
for Pomona here,

1172
02:19:53,054 --> 02:19:55,960
If you get
on the subway first.

1173
02:19:58,419 --> 02:20:01,161
I never can get no bus.

1174
02:20:05,649 --> 02:20:08,865
You can go all around
Hollywood...

1175
02:20:09,202 --> 02:20:12,861
Where I was,
from Hollywood and Vine...

1176
02:20:13,103 --> 02:20:18,099
And you can get to Pomona
for 3,50.

1177
02:20:19,014 --> 02:20:22,072
From Hollywood and Vine
to Pomona.

1178
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:27,219
I never heard
of no bus there.

1179
02:20:29,206 --> 02:20:32,527
I went on the bus
to Pomona...

1180
02:20:32,529 --> 02:20:35,465
last summer,
to visit my friend...

1181
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:39,534
who lives there.
Her name is Niko.

1182
02:20:39,598 --> 02:20:42,290
I stayed for two weeks.

1183
02:20:46,775 --> 02:20:49,686
My cousin
comes from Pomona.

1184
02:20:51,267 --> 02:20:54,673
She has a place there, and said
I can stay there.

1185
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:00,318
What time is it?

1186
02:21:02,461 --> 02:21:04,379
I don't know.

1187
02:21:05,102 --> 02:21:08,223
It's after midnight.

1188
02:21:08,893 --> 02:21:11,235
After midnight?

1189
02:21:11,961 --> 02:21:15,856
My friend Niko, who lives
in Pomona...

1190
02:21:16,658 --> 02:21:21,546
has a blonde wig...
She wears it at parties...

1191
02:21:22,347 --> 02:21:27,917
But she's on hard drugs
and turning tricks now.

1192
02:21:29,961 --> 02:21:34,192
She looks very good
in her blonde wig...

1193
02:21:34,377 --> 02:21:36,534
Just like a movie star.

1194
02:21:36,821 --> 02:21:39,875
Even girls fall
in love with her...

1195
02:21:39,883 --> 02:21:44,224
when she is looking so good...

1196
02:21:45,030 --> 02:21:48,538
in her blonde star wig.

1197
02:21:49,826 --> 02:21:53,426
She blows
kisses and laughs...

1198
02:21:54,346 --> 02:21:59,704
but she has got
a hole in her vagina wall...

1199
02:22:02,206 --> 02:22:05,282
She has torn a hole...

1200
02:22:05,993 --> 02:22:09,533
into her intestine...

1201
02:22:09,857 --> 02:22:12,077
from her vagina.

1202
02:22:12,214 --> 02:22:13,332
Shit, baby!

1203
02:22:13,497 --> 02:22:16,417
Why you
tell us that shit?

1204
02:22:18,507 --> 02:22:20,397
She has seen a doctor...

1205
02:22:21,179 --> 02:22:23,995
but it is too expensive.

1206
02:22:24,655 --> 02:22:30,484
And now she knows
her time has run out.

1207
02:22:33,145 --> 02:22:35,848
She score a few more times...

1208
02:22:36,726 --> 02:22:40,187
And then, like that...

1209
02:22:40,576 --> 02:22:45,193
She will stay her home
with her monkey...

1210
02:22:45,237 --> 02:22:47,644
She has a pet monkey!

1211
02:22:48,378 --> 02:22:52,691
This monkey shit everywhere,
but she doesn't care...

1212
02:22:53,233 --> 02:22:55,245
This monkey can scream...

1213
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:59,247
it scream
like it in a horror movie.

1214
02:23:05,425 --> 02:23:11,286
But there are those who are
good with animals...

1215
02:23:12,796 --> 02:23:16,679
Who have a way with animals...

1216
02:24:16,257 --> 02:24:18,774
It's okay.
You dyin' is all.

1217
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:52,301
I'll show you light now...

1218
02:24:57,100 --> 02:25:00,527
It burns bright forever.

1219
02:25:05,036 --> 02:25:08,323
No more blue tomorrows.

1220
02:25:15,746 --> 02:25:18,978
You on a high now, love.

1221
02:26:42,298 --> 02:26:43,725
Cut it!

1222
02:26:45,030 --> 02:26:47,278
And... print it!

1223
02:26:50,770 --> 02:26:53,041
-Check the gate, sir?
-Fantastic. Yeah, check the gate.

1224
02:26:53,163 --> 02:26:54,692
Check the gate, please!

1225
02:27:16,386 --> 02:27:19,440
Ladies and Gentlemen, let's
hear it now for Nikki Grace.

1226
02:27:19,934 --> 02:27:21,173
Nikki Grace, everybody!

1227
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:23,083
Bravo!

1228
02:28:11,987 --> 02:28:13,759
What's the matter with Nikki?

1229
02:28:40,692 --> 02:28:41,821
Nikki.

1230
02:28:42,149 --> 02:28:43,735
Nikki.

1231
02:28:51,342 --> 02:28:52,985
Nikki...

1232
02:28:53,164 --> 02:28:56,479
You were wonderful.

1233
02:30:44,572 --> 02:30:46,466
I guess after my son died,

1234
02:30:48,246 --> 02:30:50,347
I went into a bad time.

1235
02:30:53,382 --> 02:30:55,753
When I was watchin'
everythin' go around me

1236
02:30:55,888 --> 02:30:58,288
while I was standin'
in the middle.

1237
02:30:59,090 --> 02:31:02,755
Watchin' it...
like in a dark theater...

1238
02:31:05,083 --> 02:31:08,176
before they bring the lights up.

1239
02:31:19,045 --> 02:31:19,996
Hello?

1240
02:31:20,947 --> 02:31:22,292
Yeah.

1241
02:31:22,743 --> 02:31:24,365
She's still here.

1242
02:31:26,207 --> 02:31:27,732
Krimp?

1243
02:31:28,133 --> 02:31:31,278
Yeah. He's around here
someplace. That's for sure...

1244
02:40:19,162 --> 02:40:27,186
# I sing this poem to you #

1245
02:40:27,769 --> 02:40:31,668
# On the other side #

1246
02:40:31,927 --> 02:40:37,054
# I see #

1247
02:40:39,267 --> 02:40:45,987
# Shining #

1248
02:40:46,571 --> 02:40:51,107
# Waves #

1249
02:40:51,570 --> 02:40:57,105
# Billowing #

1250
02:41:00,779 --> 02:41:06,784
# It's far away #

1251
02:41:07,985 --> 02:41:13,275
# Far away from you #

1252
02:41:13,434 --> 02:41:17,072
# I can see it there #

1253
02:41:18,581 --> 02:41:22,590
# I can see it there #

1254
02:41:38,194 --> 02:41:42,025
# The wind blows outside #

1255
02:41:44,027 --> 02:41:48,377
# And I have no breath #

1256
02:41:49,688 --> 02:41:51,755
# I breathe again #

1257
02:41:51,871 --> 02:41:53,509
# And know #

1258
02:41:53,644 --> 02:41:57,468
# I'll have to live #

1259
02:42:00,446 --> 02:42:04,604
# To forget my world #

1260
02:42:04,637 --> 02:42:07,112
# Is ending #

1261
02:42:08,895 --> 02:42:12,458
# I'll have to live #

1262
02:42:16,091 --> 02:42:19,541
# I hear my heart beat #

1263
02:42:22,173 --> 02:42:24,861
# Fluttering in pain #

1264
02:42:25,283 --> 02:42:28,279
# Saying something #

1265
02:42:31,943 --> 02:42:32,995
Hello.

1266
02:42:33,114 --> 02:42:35,178
# Tears are coming #

1267
02:42:36,842 --> 02:42:38,031
Hello?

1268
02:42:38,212 --> 02:42:43,209
# To my eyes #

1269
02:42:43,593 --> 02:42:48,905
# I cry #

1270
02:42:49,428 --> 02:42:55,371
# I cry #

1271
02:42:59,309 --> 02:43:02,956
# I cannot feel #

1272
02:43:05,268 --> 02:43:08,484
# The warmth of the sun #

1273
02:43:09,994 --> 02:43:14,154
# I cannot hear the laughter #

1274
02:43:19,794 --> 02:43:23,468
# Choking with every thought #

1275
02:43:26,898 --> 02:43:32,003
# I see your faces #

1276
02:43:33,306 --> 02:43:38,594
# My hands are tied as I wish #

1277
02:43:39,576 --> 02:43:43,420
# But no one comes #

1278
02:43:44,063 --> 02:43:47,452
# No one comes #

1279
02:43:49,227 --> 02:43:55,283
# Will I live? #

1280
02:43:56,592 --> 02:44:01,400
# Will I live? #

1281
02:44:02,601 --> 02:44:07,724
# What will make me
want to live? #

1282
02:44:08,171 --> 02:44:13,667
# What will make me
want to love? #
