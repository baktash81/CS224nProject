Hi. Come here.

about this Voight guy.

he just disappears.

- Manaker.

about her hand

570
00:46:16,465 --> 00:46:18,427
and they said that she wasn't there.

571
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:20,808
She was in the infirmary,
and then she wasn't,

572
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:22,435

and there were probably ones
that nobody even knew about,

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1270
01:45:15,453 --> 01:45:18,542
Our power lies in dominance,

1271
01:45:19,127 --> 01:45:21,883
in the sovereignty of anguish.

1272
01:45:26,099 --> 01:45:27,937
(LAUGHS)

1273
01:45:34,449 --> 01:45:36,411
(GROANS)

1274
01:45:36,495 --> 01:45:38,249
And now,

1275
01:45:38,374 --> 01:45:40,754
it will be yours to wield.

1276
01:46:04,551 --> 01:46:06,138
(GASPS)

1277
01:46:17,786 --> 01:46:19,414
(GROANS)

1278
01:46:31,063 --> 01:46:32,398
No...

1279
01:46:35,446 --> 01:46:39,037
PINHEAD: You will know our finest gift.

1280
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,291
- VOIGHT: No!
- Oh, yes.

1281
01:46:42,628 --> 01:46:45,382
We have such sights to show you.

1282
01:47:37,946 --> 01:47:39,032
Go.

1283
01:47:39,825 --> 01:47:40,911
No.

1284
01:47:41,871 --> 01:47:44,083
I'll be fine. Okay?

1285
01:47:46,379 --> 01:47:47,381
Just finish it.

1286
01:47:56,149 --> 01:47:58,738
PINHEAD: Lament, Lore,

1287
01:47:59,572 --> 01:48:00,909
Laudarant,

1288
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:06,294
Liminal, Lazarus, Leviathan.

1289
01:48:08,090 --> 01:48:11,137
What would you ask of us?

1290
01:48:24,665 --> 01:48:25,792
MATT: Riley...

1291
01:48:29,299 --> 01:48:31,136
Riley, look at me.

1292
01:48:33,599 --> 01:48:34,685
Take my hand.

1293
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:38,610
Take me home.

1294
01:49:00,235 --> 01:49:01,279
No.

1295
01:49:04,828 --> 01:49:06,289
I've seen your rewards...

1296
01:49:06,624 --> 01:49:08,377
I know my brother's gone.

1297
01:49:09,922 --> 01:49:11,634
I don't want anything from you.

1298
01:49:13,011 --> 01:49:17,979
- Nothing.
- Then you have chosen...

1299
01:49:18,606 --> 01:49:20,944
A life of regret.

1300
01:49:22,488 --> 01:49:27,498
Knowing everything you've done,
everyone you've hurt

1301
01:49:27,999 --> 01:49:29,043
and lost.

1302
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:33,176
Your suffering has barely begun.

1303
01:49:37,602 --> 01:49:42,153
You chose to live, to carry that weight.

1304
01:49:43,781 --> 01:49:46,411
Bitter and brief.

1305
01:49:51,087 --> 01:49:54,093
You have chosen
the Lament Configuration.

1306
01:50:59,181 --> 01:51:00,559
What just happened in there?

1307
01:51:03,315 --> 01:51:04,610
I made a choice.

1308
01:51:08,241 --> 01:51:09,620
COLIN: It was the right one.

1309
01:51:10,162 --> 01:51:11,456
Right?

1310
01:51:38,343 --> 01:51:41,265
PINHEAD: Roland, it's time.

1311
01:51:41,349 --> 01:51:42,727

1312
01:52:19,926 --> 01:52:21,722

1313
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:37,796
Argh!
