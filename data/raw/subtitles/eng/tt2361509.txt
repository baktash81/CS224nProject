00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:30,300
<b><u>SUBTITLES BY KOUSHIK DAS</u></b>

2
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,700
FREUD SAID, "LOVE AND WORK.
WORK AND LOVE.

3
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,330
THAT'S ALL THERE IS."

4
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,300
WELL, I'M RETIRED,
AND MY WIFE IS DEAD.

5
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,460
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THAT'S
GIVEN ME SOME TIME ON MY HANDS.

6
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,600
MY WIFE'S BEEN GONE
FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS.

7
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,800
I MISS HER IN EVERY WAY.
AND RETIREMENT?

8
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,900
THAT IS AN ONGOING,
RELENTLESS EFFORT IN CREATIVITY.

9
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,660
AT FIRST, I ADMIT
I ENJOYED THE NOVELTY OF IT.

10
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,300
SORT OF FELT LIKE
I WAS PLAYING HOOKY.

11
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,000
I USED ALL THE MILES I'D SAVED
AND TRAVELED THE GLOBE.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,430
THE PROBLEM WAS, NO MATTER WHERE
I WENT, AS SOON AS I GOT HOME,

13
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,160
THE NOWHERE-TO-BE THING
HIT ME LIKE A TON OF BRICKS.

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,360
I REALIZED THE KEY TO THIS WHOLE
DEAL WAS TO KEEP MOVING.

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,330
GET UP, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE,
AND GO SOMEWHERE.

16
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,300
ANYWHERE.

17
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,700
COME RAIN OR SHINE,
I'M AT MY STARBUCKS BY 7:15.

18
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,600
EXCUSE ME,
MIND IF WE JOIN YOU?

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
NO.
HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,830
CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, BUT IT MAKES
ME FEEL PART OF SOMETHING.

21
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,700
THESE GUYS TODAY,
THEY'RE NOT NUMBERS GUYS.

22
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,960
DON'T TALK FIGURES
WITH THEM.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,330
HOW DO I SPEND
THE REST OF MY DAYS?

24
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,300
YOU NAME IT.
GOLF, BOOKS, MOVIES, PINOCHLE.

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,730
TRIED YOGA, LEARNED TO COOK,

26
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,060
BOUGHT SOME PLANTS,
TOOK CLASSES IN MANDARIN.

27
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,860
XIANG XIN WO,
WO SHEN ME DOU SHIGUO LE.

28
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,460
TRANSLATION... "BELIEVE ME,
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING."

29
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,930
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THERE ARE THE FUNERALS.

30
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,030
SO MANY MORE
THAN I COULD IMAGINE.

31
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,200
THE ONLY TRAVELING I DO
THESE DAYS

32
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,830
IS OUT TO SAN DIEGO
TO VISIT MY SON AND HIS FAMILY.

33
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,360
THEY'RE GREAT.
I LOVE THEM TO PIECES.

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,700
BUT TO BE HONEST, I THINK
I PROBABLY RELIED ON THEM

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,430
WAY MORE THAN I SHOULD.

36
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,260
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I'M NOT AN UNHAPPY PERSON.

37
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,760
QUITE THE CONTRARY.

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,660
I JUST KNOW THERE'S A HOLE IN
MY LIFE, AND I NEED TO FILL IT.

39
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,630
SOON.

40
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,460
WHICH BRINGS ME TO TODAY
WHEN I WAS LEAVING THE MARKET

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,330
AND CAUGHT YOUR FLYER
OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE.

42
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,930
HMM.

43
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,830
"SENIORS, BE AN INTERN."

44
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,960
BEN,
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
HI.

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,700
HEY.

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,330
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

48
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,200
I THINK AN INTERNET PLACE
IS LOOKING FOR SENIOR INTERNS.

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,160
AM I READING THIS RIGHT?
LET ME SEE.

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,360
"APPLICANTS MUST BE
OVER 65 YEARS OF AGE...

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,900
HAVE ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS, A
GENUINE INTEREST IN E-COMMERCE,"

52
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,160
WHATEVER THAT IS...

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
"...AND A ROLL-UP-YOUR-SLEEVES
ATTITUDE."

54
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,230
ABOUTTHEFIT. COM, ISN'T THAT
THE OUTFIT THAT WAS...

55
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,400
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

56
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
THEY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE
OLD FACTORIES IN RED HOOK.

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,230
MY DAUGHTER SAYS THEY
SELL CLOTHES ON THE INTERNET.

58
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,360
HOW THAT WORKS,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,930
WELL, YOU HAVE TO
UPLOAD THE APPLICATION.

60
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,000
THAT COULD BE CHALLENGING.
LISTEN TO THIS...

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,130
"COVER LETTERS
ARE SO OLD-FASHIONED.

62
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,530
SHOW US WHO YOU ARE
WITH A COVER-LETTER VIDEO.

63
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,000
UPLOAD YOUR VIDEO
TO YOUTUBE OR VIMEO USING

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,930
.MOV, .AVI,
OR A .MPG FILE.

65
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,030
WE LOOK FORWARD TO
MEETING YOU."

66
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,430
WELL,
I GUESS THAT'S MEETING ME.

67
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,760
I SWEAR I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT LANGUAGE THAT WAS.

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,930
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT,
BEN?

69
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,130
A FROZEN LASAGNA?
WELL...

70
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,260
I COULD MAKE A LITTLE SALAD,
TURN IT INTO A DINNER FOR TWO,

71
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,400
LIKE WE DID THAT TIME
AND NEVER DID AGAIN.

72
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
YOU KNOW THAT WAS
OVER FIVE MONTHS AGO?

73
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,060
OH, YEAH. NO, NO, WE GOT TO
DO THAT AGAIN, FOR SURE,

74
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
BUT OKAY
IF WE TAKE A RAIN CHECK?

75
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,760
YOU'RE AWFUL CUTE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

76
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,800
NO, I DIDN'T.
WELL, IT'S TRUE, YOU ARE.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,460
SO I'LL SEE YOU.

78
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,760
DON'T TAKE TOO LONG,
DOLL.

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,830
YOU'RE NOT
GETTING ANY YOUNGER.

80
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,830
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
ALL RIGHT.

81
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,400
SO HERE I AM, APPLYING TO BE
ONE OF YOUR INTERNS

82
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,200
BECAUSE THE MORE
I THINK ABOUT THIS IDEA,

83
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
THE MORE TREMENDOUS
I THINK IT IS.

84
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,930
I LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING
A PLACE I CAN GO EVERY DAY.

85
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,960
I WANT THE CONNECTION,
THE EXCITEMENT.

86
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,260
I WANT TO BE CHALLENGED,

87
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,630
AND I GUESS I MIGHT EVEN
WANT TO BE NEEDED.

88
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,060
THE TECH STUFF MIGHT
TAKE A BIT TO FIGURE OUT.

89
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,800
I HAD TO CALL
MY 9-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON

90
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,330
JUST TO FIND OUT
WHAT A USB CONNECTOR WAS.

91
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,260
BUT I'LL GET THERE.
EAGER TO LEARN.

92
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,530
ALSO, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'VE
BEEN A COMPANY MAN ALL MY LIFE.

93
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,630
I'M LOYAL, I'M TRUSTWORTHY,
AND I'M GOOD IN A CRISIS.

94
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,400
AND I LOVE THAT
YOU'RE RIGHT HERE IN BROOKLYN.

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,330
I'VE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE,
AND LATELY I FEEL

96
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,160
I MAY NOT BE HIP ENOUGH
TO LIVE IN BROOKLYN,

97
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,430
SO THIS COULD HELP WITH THAT,
TOO.

98
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,660
I READ ONCE,
MUSICIANS DON'T RETIRE.

99
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,930
THEY STOP WHEN
THERE'S NO MORE MUSIC IN THEM.

100
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,260
WELL, I STILL HAVE MUSIC IN ME,
ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE ABOUT THAT.

101
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,860

GOOD NEWS,
I FOUND A SIZE EIGHT IN NAVY.

118
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,060
NO, YOU ARE RIGHT. THAT PACKAGE
SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED BY NOW.

119
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,430
LET ME
TRACK THAT FOR YOU.

120
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,600
YEP, THESE PANTS ARE AWESOME
IF YOU HAVE HIPS.

121
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,900
SUPER SLIMMING.

122
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,030
OKAY, LET ME JUST
REVIEW THIS WITH YOU...

123
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,760
YOU HAVE SIX BRIDESMAIDS.
YOU ORDERED SIX

124
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,930
OF THE SILK CHIFFON
ANTOINETTE DRESSES IN PINK.

125
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,500
THE WEDDING
IS IN THREE DAYS,

126
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,360
AND THE DRESSES JUST ARRIVED
ALL IN CHARCOAL GRAY.

127
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,130
WHICH WE DON'T EVEN SELL,
SO THAT IS A BIT OF A MYSTERY.

128
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,860
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT THIS.

129
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,260
I AM GONNA CALL THE VENDOR
AND HAVE THIS FIXED TODAY.

130
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,760
I WILL PERSONALLY SEE THE
DRESSES BEFORE THEY ARE FEDEXED.

131
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,930
AND I PROMISE YOU
THEY WILL BE AT YOUR FRONT DOOR

132
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,860
BY 9:00 A.M. FRIDAY,
OKAY?

133
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,700
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME GIVE YOU
MY CELL, JUST IN CASE...

134
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,630
718-555-0199.

135
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,660
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

136
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,030
AND I AM GONNA REFUND YOU BACK
ALL YOUR MONEY.

137
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,300
IT'S THE...

138
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,830
YES. N...

139
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,030
OKAY, HEY, YOU CHECK THIS ONE
OFF YOUR LIST, OKAY?

140
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,260
THIS IS DONE.

141
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,400
AND, RACHEL,
HAVE A GREAT WEDDING.

142
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,530
OH, MY GOD,
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

143
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,600
JULES?

144
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,060
I KNOW, I KNOW,
I'M LATE FOR SOMETHING.

145
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,360
YEAH, EVERYTHING.

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,000
YOU SEE WHY I TAKE
CUSTOMER-SERVICE CALLS?

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,500
I MEAN, IT'S SO GOOD.
YOU LEARN SO MUCH.

148
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,260
OKAY, WHAT'S UP?
WHAT AM I DOING?

149
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,130
OKAY, CAMERON WAS WAITING FOR
YOU BUT HAD ANOTHER MEETING.

150
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,900
HE SAID
HE'LL BE BACK AT 2:00.

151
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,500
EVERYONE NEEDS YOU TO SIGN OFF ON TOMORROW'S HOMEPAGE.
RIGHT.

152
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,360
AND YOUR 11:00 IS IN
THE BIG CONFERENCE ROOM.

153
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,630
SO IS YOUR 11:10.
FINANCE NEEDS YOU,

154
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,230
AND I GUESS YOU
E-MAILED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

155
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,430
AT 4:00 A.M.
ABOUT SOMETHING?

156
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,200
OH, GOOD,
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

157
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,160
I WANT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR
FRIENDS TO SHOP TOGETHER ONLINE.

158
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,700
MAKE IT LESS OF
AN ALONE THING.

159
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,030
E-MAIL ME THAT IDEA, WILL YOU?
YEAH, I LIKE THAT.

160
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,760
UM, IS NOW A GOOD TIME
TO CALL YOUR MOM BACK?

161
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,900
DUDE, I'M ON A BIKE.

162
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,230
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

163
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,630
COME ON.

164
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,260
OH.

165
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,930
OH, WHAT A MESS. THIS IS
THE MIDDLE OF THE OFFICE.

166
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,560
DON'T... DON'T...
DON'T PUT THAT...

I'M ALL ABOUT THAT BASS ♪</i>

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,130
HELLO.
HI.

171
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,400
I'M BEN WHITTAKER.

172
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,130
I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL
ABOUT AN INTERVIEW

173
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,860
FOR THE SENIOR INTERN PROGRAM.

174
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,130
HEY, BEN.
HOW'S IT GOING?

175
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,600
IT'S GOING GOOD, REAL GOOD.
THANK YOU.

176
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,360
EXCELLENT.
TAKE A SEAT AROUND THE CORNER,

177
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,530
AND SOMEONE FROM TALENT
ACQUISITION WILL COME GET YOU.

178
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,760
THANK YOU.

179
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,360
"TALENT ACQUISITION"?

180
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,000

183
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,230
OKAY,
YOU GUYS HAVE TO REMEMBER,

184
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,800
THE HOMEPAGE
HAS TO READ IN A GLANCE.

185
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,660
RIGHT.
ALSO, YOU HAVE TO GET BACK LIKE THIS

186
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,230
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT LOOKS
LIKE IF YOU'RE, LIKE, OVER 35.

187
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,660
OKAY,
SO I CAN'T READ ANYTHING,

188
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,800
BUT IF I COULD,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SEE?

189
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,430
"FIVE GIRLS, ONE SHIRT"
OR "CHECK OUT THE FIT"?

190
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,330
WELL, BOTH, BUT
WHAT I REALLY WANT YOU TO SEE

191
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,430
IS THE SHIRT WORN BY
FIVE DIFFERENT BODY TYPES.

192
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,300
OKAY, THEN
YOU GOT TO MAKE ME SEE THAT.

193
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,500
TRY MAKING THE PHOTO GRID
BIGGER.

194
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,800
I LOVE THAT FIVE.
CAN WE MAKE IT MORE GRAPHIC?

195
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,060
YEAH, THAT'S COOL.

196
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,160
MAYBE HERO
THE GIRL IN THE RED SHIRT.

197
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,430
JULES...
THAT IS A GREAT RED.

198
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,160
IT IS GOING TO
FLY OUT OF HERE.

199
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,500
I NEEDED YOU TO SIGN OFF
ON THIS, LIKE, TWO HOURS AGO.

200
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,330
I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT CAN YOU TRY?

201
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,400
YEP.

202
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,130
MIA?
TELL ME THAT THING AGAIN.

203
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,260
OH, 40% OF OUR VISITORS
DON'T GO PAST THE HOMEPAGE.

204
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,230
WHICH ISN'T SO BAD.

205
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,760
YEAH,
BUT WE SHOULD FIX THAT.

206
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,430
OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

207
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,360
I LOVE IT.

208
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,800
GREAT, AND IT'S UP.

209
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,330
OKAY.
THANKS, EVERYBODY.

210
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,900
THANKS.
THANK YOU.

211
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,600
LET'S GO OVER
THE PITCH FOR FRIDAY.

212
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,260
OKAY, SO...

213
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,460
THE ANTOINETTE DRESS.

214
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,160
MAJOR SCREW-UP
BY THE VENDOR.

215
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,500
THERE'S GONNA BE A COUPLE OF
INTERVIEWS TODAY, BEN.

216
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,400
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE BOTH FIND THE RIGHT FIT.

217
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,360
BUSINESS AS USUAL
IS NOT REALLY OUR MOTTO,

218
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,330
SO WE HOPE
YOU HAVE SOME FUN HERE.

219
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,030
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE
HIRING SENIOR INTERNS,

220
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,260
SO SOME OF
OUR INTERN QUESTIONS

221
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,030
MAY NOT EXACTLY FIT
YOUR PROFILE,

222
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,960
BUT WE'RE GONNA GO FOR IT
ANYWAY, OKAY?

223
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,060
FIRE AWAY.

224
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,130
OKAY, GOOD.

225
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,660
WHERE'D YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

226
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,760
I WENT TO NORTHWESTERN.

227
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,930
HEY, MY BROTHER
WENT TO NORTHWESTERN.

228
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,430
PROBABLY NOT
AT THE SAME TIME.

229
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,000
PROBABLY NOT.
HE GRADUATED IN 2009.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800
CLASS OF '65.

231
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,800
WOW,
WHAT WAS YOUR MAJOR?

232
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,560
DO YOU REMEMBER?

233
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,600
AND AFTER NORTHWESTERN
YOU WENT ON TO...?

234
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,160
I WENT TO WORK
FOR DEX ONE.

235
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,400
OKAY, AND THEY MADE...?

236
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,660
PHONEBOOKS.

237
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,200
I WAS IN CHARGE OF
OVERSEEING

238
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,700
THE PRINTING
OF THE PHYSICAL PHONEBOOK.

239
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,530
I DID THAT FOR OVER 20 YEARS,
AND BEFORE THAT,

240
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,500
I WAS THEIR
V.P. OF SALES AND ADVERTISING.

241
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,700
SO, DO THEY STILL
MAKE PHONEBOOKS?

242
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,960
I MEAN, DOESN'T EVERYONE
JUST GOOGLE NUMBERS?

243
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,230
I BELIEVE THEY DO, BUT BEFORE GOOGLE
THAT WAS HOW YOU GOT A NUMBER.

244
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,230
OH, NO, NO.
YEAH, I... I GET IT.

245
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,930
SO 40 YEARS
AT THE PHONEBOOK COMPANY?

246
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,960
THAT IS AMAZING,
SERIOUSLY.

247
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,430
OKAY, BENJAMIN.

248
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,500
NOW, I'M GONNA ASK YOU ONE OF
OUR MORE TELLING QUESTIONS

249
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,260
FOR ALL OF OUR INTERNS,
SO I WANT YOU TO, LIKE,

250
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,000
THIS IS THE ONE
TO REALLY THINK ABOUT, OKAY?

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,660
AND...
AND TAKE YOUR TIME.

252
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,830
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF
IN 10 YEARS?

253
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,800
WHEN I'M 80?

254
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,700
YEAH, SURE.

255
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
YEAH, WHATEVER.

256
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,300
UM...

257
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,060
WAIT.
DID NOT REALIZE YOU WERE 70.

258
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,760
THAT'S, UH... THAT QUESTION JUST
DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU, DOES IT?

259
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,660
SHOULD WE JUST SCRATCH THAT ONE
AND JUST MOVE ON?

260
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,130
IT'S YOUR CALL, JUSTIN.
OKAY, THAT ONE'S GONE.

261
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,530
YOU LOOK GREAT, BY THE WAY.
SO GREAT.

262
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,500
AND YOU'RE CLEARLY MORE THAN
QUALIFIED FOR THIS JOB.

263
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,000
YOU'RE ACTUALLY, LIKE,
WAY OVERQUALIFIED,

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,160
AND WE WERE SO IMPRESSED.

265
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
YOU HAD GREAT INTERVIEWS,
GREAT VIDEO.

266
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,130
YOU NAILED IT, BEN.
CONGRATS.

267
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,700
YOU'RE AN INTERN.

268
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,830
HEY.
HI.

269
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,400
I NEED YOU FOR TWO MINUTES,
UNINTERRUPTED.

270
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,700
OKAY.
REMEMBER A FEW WEEKS AGO,

271
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,360
WE TALKED ABOUT
THE SENIOR INTERN PROGRAM?

272
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,930
NO.
REALLY? WE HAD A...

273
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,030
WE HAD A WHOLE, BIG CONVERSATION
ABOUT IT.

274
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,400
WE DID?
OKAY, REMIND ME.

275
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,860
SENIORS IN HIGH SCHOOL
OR COLLEGE?

276
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,960
NO, NO, NO, NO.

277
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,200
SENIORS IN LIFE.
OLDER PEOPLE.

278
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,700
HOLD ON, WHAT?

279
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,860
I TOLD YOU I FELT LIKE WE NEEDED
TO DO AN OUTREACH PROGRAM.

280
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,760
YOU DEFINITELY SEEMED TO BE
LIKING THE IDEA,

281
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,800
SO I SET IT IN MOTION.
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

282
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
HOLD, PLEASE.

283
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,360
YOU'RE HIRING
SENIOR CITIZEN INTERNS?

284
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,860
THERE'S BEEN
A TON OF RESEARCH ON THIS,

285
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,600
AND THE RESULTS
ARE ACTUALLY INCREDIBLE.

286
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,430
I MEAN, IMAGINE HAVING AN INTERN
WITH A LIFETIME OF EXPERIENCE,

287
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,860
AS OPPOSED TO
SOMEBODY WHO SPENT

288
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,700
THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF THEIR
LIFE PLAYING BEER PONG.

289
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,460
DO THEY EVENTUALLY
WANT JOBS HERE?

290
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,330
NO, DARLING,
THEY'RE ALL RETIRED.

291
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,330
THEY... THEY JUST WANT
THE EXPERIENCE.

292
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,260
AND I WOULD LIKE ONE
TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH YOU.

293
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,400
WAIT, CAMERON, NO.

294
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,600
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT GREAT WITH OLDER PEOPLE.

295
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,430
YOU KNOW HOW I AM
WITH MY PARENTS.

296
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,200
THIS COULD BE...

297
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,430
WHY DO I
HAVE TO HAVE ONE?

298
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,930
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
SET THE TONE.

299
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,430
NOW, WOULD YOU PREFER
A MAN OR A WOMAN?

300
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,530
THERE'S A GREAT
72-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, REALLY CUTE.

301
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,200
THAT'S LIKE THE SAME AGE
AS MY MOM.

302
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
THAT'S TOO WEIRD.
THAT'S FINE.

303
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,500
THERE'S A MAN EVERYONE LOVES.
HE SEEMS AMAZING.

304
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,360
I WATCHED HIS VIDEO
WITH THE WHOLE GROUP.

305
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,860
PEOPLE WERE CRYING.

306
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,200
OKAY, THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK,
IN MY OPINION.

307
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,260
BUT HOW LONG
DO I HAVE TO DO THIS FOR?

308
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,230
MINIMUM?
SIX WEEKS OR WE'LL BE SUED.

309
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,630
I KNOW WE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

310
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,530
YEAH, WE DID.
FOR REAL.

311
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,330
HE STARTS TOMORROW.

312
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,860
MM.

313
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,400
BACK IN ACTION.

314
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,830
THANK GOD.

315
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,560
NEW INTERNS, WELCOME TO ATF.

316
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,860
WE ALL WORK ON THIS ONE FLOOR,
AND THAT IS BECAUSE

317
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,200
WE ARE ALL ABOUT
COMMUNICATION AND TEAMWORK.

318
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,560
NO ONE
HAS A PRIVATE OFFICE,

319
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,900
NOT EVEN OUR FOUNDER AND CEO,
JULES OSTIN,

320
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,100
WHO IS ACTUALLY
RIGHT OVER THERE.

321
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,660
SHE LOVES TO RIDE HER BIKE
THROUGH THE OFFICE.

322
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
THAT WOMAN DOES NOT
LIKE TO WASTE TIME.

323
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,830
PLUS,
SHE COUNTS IT AS EXERCISE.

324
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,400
THAT'S ADORABLE.

325
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,300
YEAH.
MM-HMM.

326
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,460
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?
I'M DAVIS.

327
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,760
HI, DAVIS.
BEN WHITTAKER.

328
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,800
EXCITING PLACE, HUH?
OH, MY GOD.

329
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,530
THEY HAD ONE OPENING FOR A
REGULAR-AGE INTERN, NO OFFENSE.

330
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,660
I GOT IT.
I'M SO PSYCHED.

331
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,860
I'M PRETTY PSYCHED
MYSELF.

332
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,760
ALL RIGHT,
A FEW WORDS ABOUT JULES.

333
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,900
SHE STARTED ABOUT THE FIT
ONLY 18 MONTHS AGO.

334
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,100
THIS WHOLE IDEA WAS HATCHED
AT JULES' KITCHEN TABLE

335
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,360
RIGHT HERE IN BROOKLYN.

336
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,960
JULES TRIED EVERYTHING ON
THAT SHE SOLD,

337
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,030
DESCRIBED THE FIT HERSELF,

338
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,600
AND APPARENTLY IT WORKED.

339
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,030
SHE WAS ONLINE
IN FOUR MONTHS.

340
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,230
SHE STARTED WITH 25 EMPLOYEES.

341
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,930
SHE'S NOW UP TO 216.

342
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,760
WITH YOU 4, 220.

343
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,000
WOW.

344
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,060
HEY, BEN, ARE YOU GONNA
WEAR A SUIT EVERY DAY?

345
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,160
YOU BET.
CONFIDENT.

346
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,430
I LIKE HOW YOU ROLL.

347
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,430
I LIKE IT A LOT.

348
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,600
WE JUST HIT A RECORD HIGH
OF 2,500 LIKES ON INSTAGRAM.

349
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,730
YEAH!

350
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,460
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO

351
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,230
WHEN SOMETHING GOOD
HAPPENS AROUND HERE.

352
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,630
NEW INTERNS, GRAB A SEAT

353
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,260
AT ONE OF THE INTERN TABLES
OVER THERE.

354
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,560
CHECK YOUR E-MAIL. YOU MAY FIND
THAT YOU'VE BEEN ASSIGNED

355
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,430
TO ONE PARTICULAR PERSON
OR ONE PARTICULAR TEAM.

356
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,930
OR YOU MIGHT JUST BE
A FLOATER.

357
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,300
IT'S ALL GOOD.

358
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,960
OKAY,
LET ME INSTAGRAM THIS.

359
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,430
MOMENT IN TIME.

360
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,560
GRAY IS THE NEW GREEN.

361
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,830
TAKE A SEAT.

362
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,700
THANKS.

363
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,260
GOT ONE.

364
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,030
"WELCOME BEN!
YOUR INTERNSHIP WILL BE

365
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,660
DIRECTLY WITH OUR FOUNDER,
JULES OSTIN."

366
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,400
OH,
I'M IN THE PHOTO STUDIO.

367
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,430
FLOATER.
LOVE!

368
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,830
HEY, BEN,
WHAT'D YOU GET?

369
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,000
LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA BE
A PERSONAL INTERN.

370
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
NICE. TO?

371
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,600
JULES OSTIN.

372
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,730
UNFORTUNATE.

373
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,230
HANG IN THERE.

374
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,300
"HI BEN,
I HAVE SECURED AN APPOINTMENT

375
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,200
FOR YOU TO MEET WITH
JULES OSTIN TODAY AT 3:55 P.M.

376
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,930
PLEASE BE PROMPT AS JULES HAS
ANOTHER MEETING AT 4:00 P.M."

377
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,960
HMM.

378
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,130
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING TO MERCHANDISING.

379
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,530
BEAUTIFUL.

380
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,030
IT'S PERFECT.

381
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,100
YES, I'LL TRY TO
HAVE HER THERE AT 5:00.

382
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,600
UM, NO, WAIT.

383
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,430
I BOOKED HER WITH A VENDOR
AT 5:15.

384
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,260
I'M SORRY.

385
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,100
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

386
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,360
YES, HELLO?

387
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,730
HI.
I'M BEN WHITTAKER.

388
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,260
I HAVE A 3:55 APPOINTMENT
WITH MS. OSTIN.

389
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,660
3:55?

390
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,500
I THOUGHT SHE WAS MEETING WITH
HER NEW INTERN.

391
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,260
THAT'S ME.

392
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,130
HOW YOU DOING?

393
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,500
I'M SORRY, UH,
HOW ARE YOU AN INTERN?

394
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,130
W... IT'S THE NEW
SENIOR INTERN PROGRAM.

395
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,030
IT JUST STARTED TODAY.

396
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,230
OH, MY GOD.

397
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,000
UM...

398
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,100
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

399
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,030
70. YOU?

400
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,230
I'M 24.

401
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,300
I KNOW, I LOOK OLDER.

402
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,400
IT'S THE JOB.
IT AGES YOU.

403
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
WHICH WON'T BE GREAT
IN YOUR CASE.

404
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,700
SORRY.

405
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,500
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
YOU LOOKED YOUNGER.

406
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,430
YEAH, RIGHT.

407
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,600
ANY TIPS
BEFORE I GO IN?

408
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660
JUST TALK FAST.
SHE HATES SLOW TALKERS.

409
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,500
MAYBE THAT'S JUST
WHEN I TALK SLOW.

410
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,430
DON'T DAWDLE IN ANY WAY.
JUST KEEP IT MOVING.

411
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,730
AND DON'T FORGET
TO BLINK.

412
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,160
BLINK?
YEAH.

413
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,200
SHE HATES WHEN PEOPLE DON'T
BLINK. IT WEIRDS HER OUT.

414
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,000
BUT IT'S 3:57.
THIS MEETING THAT SHE'S IN

415
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,600
JUST TOOK UP LIKE TWO OF YOUR
F... THEY'RE OUT. GO, GO, GO.

416
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,500
OKAY, THANKS.
GO. YEAH.

417
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,530
WHAT?

418
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,930
OH, YEAH, I'M HERE.

419
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,330
HI, JULES?

420
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,630
I'M BEN,
YOUR NEW INTERN.

421
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,730
I'M GLAD YOU ALSO
SEE THE HUMOR IN THIS.

422
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,130
BE HARD NOT TO.

423
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,360
SO, BEN...

424
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,930
I WAS GONNA SAY
WHAT IS A NICE GUY LIKE YOU

425
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,100
DOING AT
A PLACE LIKE THIS?

426
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,900
BUT CAMERON
GAVE ME THE DRILL,

427
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,360
SO CAN I JUST
BE HONEST WITH YOU?

428
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,600
PLEASE.

429
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,430
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
A LOT FOR YOU TO DO.

430
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,760
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

431
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,260
AND YOU BEING ASSIGNED TO ME
IS KIND OF JUST

432
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,030
FOR ME TO SET AN EXAMPLE
FOR THE REST OF THE TEAM.

433
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,030
IF YOU ASK ME, I THINK
THAT YOU'D BE MUCH BETTER OFF

434
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,560
WORKING IN CREATIVE
OR MARKETING.

435
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,830
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
SLOWER PACE,

436
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,300
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT
EASIER TO GRASP.

437
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,630
IF YOU REQUESTED TO TRANSFER,
WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

438
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,300
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'D PREFER.

439
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,260
YOU'LL BE HAPPIER, BELIEVE ME.
I AM NOT SO FUN TO WORK FOR.

440
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,300
THAT'S WHAT I GATHER,
BUT I CAN GET ALONG WITH ANYONE,

441
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,360
AND I'M HERE TO
LEARN ABOUT YOUR WORLD,

442
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,030
GIVE HELP WHERE I CAN,
SO...

443
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,500
SO,
YOU DON'T WANT TO TRANSFER?

444
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,700
NOT REALLY, SIR.

445
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,030
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

446
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,400
EXCUSE ME.

447
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,660
OKAY.

448
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,460
WELL, THEN, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

449
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,100
GREAT, I'M EXCITED.

450
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,000
I WILL E-MAIL YOU WHEN
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO.

451
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,830
OR I COULD JUST STOP BY
A FEW TIMES A DAY, CHECK IN...?

452
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,200
I'LL E-MAIL YOU.

453
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,630
ALSO, DON'T FEEL LIKE
YOU HAVE TO DRESS UP.

454
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,030
I MEAN,
WE'RE SUPER CAS HERE.

455
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,260
WELL, I'M COMFORTABLE IN A SUIT,
IF IT'S OKAY.

456
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,060
NO, IT'S FINE.

457
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,100
OLD SCHOOL.

458
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,160
EXACTLY.

459
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,800
AT LEAST
I'LL STAND OUT.

460
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,030
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED A SUIT
TO DO THAT.

461
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,000
TRUE.

462
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,430
WELL, I THINK WE DID IT
IN LESS THAN TWO MINUTES.

463
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,330
I'LL WAIT TO
HEAR FROM YOU.

464
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,760
OKAY.

465
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,260
WANT THE DOOR
OPEN OR CLOSED?

466
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,630
DOESN'T MATTER.

467
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,960
OPEN, ACTUALLY.

468
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,230
YOU'LL GET USED TO ME.

469
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,000
LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

470
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,100
HI.

471
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,900
HI.

472
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,660
HI.

473
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,300
HI.

474
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,900
HOWDY.

475
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,330
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

476
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,630
NO.

477
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,700
WHAT'S UP, BEN?
ARE YOU GOOD?

478
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,360
PERFECT.

479
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,960
OKAY.

480
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,400
THE V-NECK BACK TEE?

481
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,460
THIS IS HOLLY.

482
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,730
CAN YOU
RUN THAT UP TO THEM?

483
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,600
YEAH, NO, NO, WE LOVE
THE WHOLE LINE, MARK.

484
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
OKAY, SO YOU CAN ZOOM OUT.

485
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,700
LIKE THAT.
I'M GOING TO A MEETING.

486
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,260
I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR.
WE'LL TALK THEN?

487
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,330
AND THEN YOU CAN JUST
CLICK HERE TO BUY IT.

488
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,600
COOL, YEAH.

489
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,500
HELLO?

490
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,900
HI, YEAH.

491
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,660
ALL RIGHT.

492
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,200
YOU STAYING?

493
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,130
CAN'T LEAVE
BEFORE THE BOSS LEAVES, DAVIS.

494
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,900
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE A WHILE.

495
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,360
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING, BEN.

496
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,830
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

497
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,030
YOU, TOO.

498
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,230
LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.

499
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,960
THANKS.

500
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,900
HOW ABOUT I PUSH,
YOU DELIVER?

501
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,600
THANK YOU.

502
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,460
I LIKE THAT THERE'S FOUR FAVES
INSTEAD OF THREE,

503
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,730
BUT CAN I SEE THE ONE
WITHOUT THE JACKET JUST TO...

504
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,760
SURE.

505
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,100
HI.

506
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,200
OKAY, SO THEY WANT TO KNOW

507
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,600
WHAT CUSTOMERS BOUGHT
WHO DIDN'T COME BACK

508
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,230
SO THEY CAN SPOT A PROBLEM
IF THERE IS ONE, RIGHT?

509
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,600
YEAH, BUT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO...

510
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,130
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HERE'S
WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD DO.

511
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,330
BEN!
WE SHOULD GO...

512
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,200
BEN! HEY, LOOK.
HERE SHE COMES.

513
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,560
WATCH HOW
SHE WON'T EVEN...

514
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,660
HEY, BECK.
WHAT'S UP?

515
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,330
YOU LOOK
REALLY NICE TO...

516
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,460
HOW LONG CAN A WOMAN
BE MAD AT YOU FOR?

517
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,430
WELL, IT KIND OF
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU DID.

518
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,000
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
NOTHING ON PURPOSE.

519
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
WE WERE GOING OUT
FOR A MINUTE.

520
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,100
I THOUGHT SHE WAS COOL.
I REALLY LIKED HER.

521
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,230
BUT THEN I SORT OF
ACCIDENTALLY...

522
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,260
SLEPT WITH HER ROOMMATE.
THAT DOESN'T HELP.

523
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,530
I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS HER ROOMMATE.

524
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,230
I MET HER OUT.
HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?

525
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,630
HEY, NIKKI.
BEN, TELL ME.

526
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,760
I DON'T KNOW THIS STUFF.

527
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,100
YOU'RE OLDER.

528
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,630
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT.

529
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,600
I MEAN, YOU... I MEAN,
YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE.

530
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
SHE'LL BE MAD AT ME FOR?

531
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,230
JAY, I HAVE ZERO EXPERIENCE
WITH WOMEN,

532
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,360
AND I CAN TELL YOU, THERE'S
NO COMING BACK FROM THAT ONE.

533
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,460
I MEAN, I ASSUME
YOU TALKED TO HER, APOLOGIZED,

534
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,460
TOLD HER
HOW MUCH SHE MEANS TO YOU.

535
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,700
WELL, YOU KNOW...

536
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,960
YOU DIDN'T TALK TO HER?

537
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,500
WHAT DID YOU DO,
SEND HER A TWEET?

538
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,560
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

539
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,300
I, LIKE, TEXTED HER
A BILLION TIMES.

540
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,230
SHE DIDN'T ANSWER,
SO THEN I E-MAILED HER.

541
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,900
BUT IT WAS LIKE,
A NICE E-MAIL.

542
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,530
IT WAS A LONG ONE,
WELL THOUGHT OUT.

543
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,600
SUBJECT LINE I WROTE,
"I'M SOOORRY,"

544
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
WITH LIKE A TON OF O'S.

545
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,530
SO IT WAS LIKE,
"I'M SOOORRY,"

546
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,330
WITH A SAD EMOTICON
WHERE HE'S CRYING

547
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,100
AT THE SIDE OF
ITS LITTLE CHEEK.

548
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,930
I SHOULD PROBABLY ACTUALLY
JUST TALK TO HER, HUH?

549
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,130
OBVIOUSLY.

550
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,260
CAN'T IMAGINE
IT WOULD HURT.

551
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,360
OH, DID YESTERDAY'S NUMBERS
COME IN?

552
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,000
YEAH.

553
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
WE COULD DO IT THAT WAY,
TOO.

554
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,660
I NOTICED MY INTERN
SURE KEEPS BUSY.

555
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,930
MR. CONGENIALITY.

556
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,360
HE'S A VERY BIG HIT.

557
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,400
EVERYBODY LOVES HIM.

558
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,160
OKAY,
DO NOT LOOK AT THAT DESK.

559
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,360
IT'S LIKE
THE OFFICE JUNK DRAWER.

560
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,760
IT'S JUST GONNA
DRIVE YOU CRAZY.

561
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,030
YOU JUST DID THAT.

562
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,830
WHAT, ARE YOU
PREPARING FOR SURGERY?

563
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,000
OKAY, SERIOUSLY?

564
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,960
LIKE,
HOW DID THIS EVEN HAPPEN?

565
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,060
NO, NO, I-I CAN SET IT UP.

566
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,460
SHE'S JUST IN A MEETING.

567
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,130
HI.
SOMETHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

568
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,130
YES, JULES SPILLED SOY SAUCE
ON HER SAINT LAURENT JACKET.

569
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,460
CAN YOU TAKE IT
TO THE PHOTO STUDIO?

570
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,030
THERE'S LOTS OF CLEANERS
AND STUFF IN THERE.

571
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,030
SURE.
WHERE IS IT?

572
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,430
SHE'S WEARING IT.

573
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,760
THEY WOULD LIKE US
TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY...

574
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,160
OKAY.

575
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,260
...OF, UH, MEETING WITH
SOME, UH, POTENTIAL CEOS.

576
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,830
WOW.

577
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,730
I DID NOT
SEE THAT COMING.

578
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,030
W-WHY? UH...

579
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,960
AM I TOO INEXPERIENCED
AT RUNNING A BUSINESS?

580
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,330
I-I DIDN'T GO TO HARVARD?

581
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,200
MY... MY METHODS
AREN'T BY THE BOOK?

582
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,800
I MEAN,
ISN'T THAT HOW WE GOT HERE?

583
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,300
REALLY?

584
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,230
I NEED ADULT SUPERVISION?

585
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,630
COULD WE BE DOING BETTER?

586
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,600
WE HIT OUR FIVE-YEAR GOAL
IN NINE MONTHS.

587
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,960
EXACTLY.

588
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
JULES, WE CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH OUR OWN SUCCESS.

589
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,500
YOU KNOW THAT.

590
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,000
YOU'RE AN HOUR LATE
TO EVERY MEETING.

591
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,230
WE HAVE A NAME FOR IT...
JULES STANDARD TIME.

592
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,000
AND LOOK, I GET IT. THERE'S ONLY
SO MANY HOURS IN THE DAY.

593
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,560
WE'RE ALL PLAYING CATCHUP.

594
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,360
OUR TECH GUYS WORK UNTIL
2:00, 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

595
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,400
CUSTOMER SERVICE
IS SLAMMED.

596
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,800
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF
INVENTORY.

597
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,700
WE'VE GOT SHIPPING ISSUES
AND PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS.

598
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,960
AND... AND THE BIGGER WE GET,

599
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,500
THE MORE COMPLICATED
IT'S GONNA GET.

600
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,660
BUT ISN'T THIS
WHAT A STARTUP IS?

601
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,700
WHAT?

602
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,900
SAY IT. WHAT IS EVERYONE
SO WORRIED ABOUT?

603
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,200
THAT IT'S ALL GOING TOO FAST,
AND IT COULD GET AWAY FROM US.

604
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,330
OUR INVESTORS JUST THINK
THAT A SEASONED CEO

605
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,300
COULD TAKE SOME THINGS
OFF YOUR PLATE.

606
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,060
THAT'S ALL. JUST FREE YOU UP
TO DO WHAT YOU DO GREAT.

607
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,460
YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEAS,

608
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,300
AND LET SOMEBODY ELSE
MAKE THE TRAINS RUN ON TIME.

609
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,800
BUT, CAMERON,
THIS NEW PERSON,

610
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,960
THEY ARE GOING TO
WANT TO DO THINGS THEIR WAY.

611
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,500
TECHNICALLY
BE MY BOSS.

612
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,100
I MEAN,
HOW CAN I DO WHAT I DO

613
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,000
IF I HAVE TO
REPORT TO SOMEONE ELSE,

614
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,160
RUN EVERY IDEA I HAVE
BY THIS PERSON?

615
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,530
CAN YOU
SEE THAT WORKING?

616
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,800
WELL,
GILT GROUPE BROUGHT IN A CEO.

617
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,560
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

618
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,530
I MEAN, GET ME CEO LESSONS,
YOU KNOW?

619
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,800
UH, EXCUSE ME.

620
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,560
I APOLOGIZE,

621
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,560
BUT BECKY SAID YOU NEEDED
SOMETHING TAKEN CARE OF

622
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,500
ON YOUR JACKET.

623
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,530
OH, RIGHT.

624
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,800
THANK YOU, BEN.

625
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,460
OF COURSE.

626
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,200
THE V.C.S MADE UP A LIST
OF POTENTIAL CEOS.

627
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,060
LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK
AT THE LIST.

628
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,800
EXPLORE IT,
THEN DECIDE.

629
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,530
BABY STEPS.

630
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,100
BEN.

631
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,760
SOMETHING BIG
GOING ON IN THERE?

632
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,060
I COULDN'T SAY.

633
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,760
YOU WERE IN THERE
A LONG TIME.

634
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,530
I CAN'T HEAR A THING.

635
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,460
PSST!

636
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,330
SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT ME TO HER.

637
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,060
NO, YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

638
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,730
ON MY WAY, BOSS.

639
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,100
HMM. BOSS.

640
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,630
HEY, BEN. BEN.

641
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,230
HOW OLD'S
THAT BRIEFCASE?

642
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,330
IT'S A 1973 EXECUTIVE ASHBURN
ATTACHÉ.

643
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,000
THEY DON'T MAKE IT ANYMORE.

644
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,500
I'M A LITTLE
IN LOVE WITH IT.

645
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,800
IT'S A CLASSIC, LEWIS.
IT'S UNBEATABLE.

646
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,360
GOOD NIGHT.

647
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,700
BYE.

648
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,400
OH, MY GOD.
SOMEBODY CLEANED UP THAT DESK.

649
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,830
I SWEAR, I WAS GONNA STAY LATE
AND DO THIS MYSELF.

650
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,460
WASN'T ME.

651
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,900
BEN CAME IN AT 7:00 THIS MORNING
AND DID IT.

652
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,430
WHO?

653
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,500
BEN.

654
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,260
YOUR INTERN.

655
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,460
BEN WHITTAKER.

656
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,200
SOMEONE'S VERY HAPPY.

657
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,400
BRILLIANT.
THANK YOU.

658
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,730
BEST THING THAT'S HAPPENED
AROUND HERE ALL WEEK.

659
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,230
THANK YOU.

660
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,560
THIS IS YOUR GIFT
FOR A JOB WELL DONE.

661
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,200
I'M FIONA,
THE HOUSE MASSEUSE.

662
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,730
HI, FIONA.

663
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,630
HI.
BEN.

664
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,200
HI.
DOES THAT FEEL OKAY?

665
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,660
IT FEELS GREAT, ACTUALLY.
THANK YOU.

666
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,830
OKAY. YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT TIGHT,
BEN.

667
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,430
WELL, I HAVEN'T SAT AT A DESK
FOR A WHILE.

668
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,730
MY BODY'S NOT USED TO IT.
NO, I GET IT.

669
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,030
PLUS, THEY SAY
SITTING IS THE NEW SMOKING.

670
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,600
LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

671
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,100
I, UH, SPOTTED YOU
IN THE LUNCHROOM.

672
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,360
I WONDERED WHO YOU WERE.

673
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,630
DID YOU? OH.
YEAH.

674
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,600
THEN SOMEONE TOLD ME
YOU WERE AN INTERN.

675
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
THAT'S PRETTY COOL OF YOU
TO DO THIS.

676
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,500
WELL, IT'S A BRAVE NEW WORLD.
THOUGHT I'D JUMP IN.

677
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,630
SEE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

678
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,430
YEAH, I KNOW.
ABSOLUTELY.

679
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,430
I'M CONSTANTLY AMAZED
AT WHAT THEY DO HERE.

680
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,130
LOVE BEING
A PART OF IT.

681
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,560
OH.

682
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,330
OH, MY GOD.
YEAH.

683
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,230
THERE. YEAH.
RIGHT THERE.

684
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,230
HOW'S THAT, BEN?

685
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,900
WELL, IT'S... OH, BOY.

686
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,330
GOOD.

687
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,660
JASON.

688
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,360
OKAY, GOOD.
GOOD, GOOD.

689
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,830
THERE, GOOD.

690
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,060
HERE YOU GO.

691
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,960
A LITTLE TIGHT
RIGHT HERE.

692
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,130
IS THAT BETTER?

693
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,200
OH, BOY, OH, BOY.
OH, HOW'S THAT?

694
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,560
OH, BOY.

695
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,800
WELL, IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU,
BEN.

696
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,430
LOVE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER
OLDIE BUT GOODIE HERE.

697
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,060
NICE TO MEET YOU.

698
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,100
SEE YOU LATER?

699
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,130
LOVE TO.

700
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,730
ME, TOO.

701
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,160
YOU'RE NOT AS OLD
AS I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

702
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,660
OOH!

703
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,000
WAIT, SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU SHAVE EVERY DAY?

704
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,430
YES.
EVEN ON SUNDAYS?

705
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,960
EVERY DAY.
OKAY, AND EVEN IF YOU KNOW

706
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,630
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE
ANYONE THAT YOU KNOW?

707
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,100
YES.
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

708
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,630
I'M ON
CHEAPAPARTMENTS.COM,

709
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,230
AND I LITERALLY CAN'T AFFORD
A SINGLE APARTMENT

710
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,660
IN ALL OF BROOKLYN.

711
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,460
MY PARENTS GAVE ME TWO WEEKS
TO FIND A PLACE,

712
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,460
AND THAT'S JUST NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

713
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,730
GETTING EVICTED?

714
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,400
HEY, I'M IN NO RUSH,
BUT APPARENTLY THEY ARE.

715
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,800
ALL RIGHT, HERE.
LET ME SEE YOUR PHONE.

716
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,330
CHEAPAPARTMENTS.COM.
HAVE YOU TRIED CRAIGSLIST?

717
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,600
YES.
OKAY. THEN I AM OUT OF IDEAS.

718
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,800
JULES. HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

719
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,560
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

720
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,460
HEY.
HEY.

721
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,230
HOW'S IT GOING?
WELL, GOOD.

722
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,400
MIKE, RIGHT?
YEAH.

723
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,130
YEAH, I'M BEN.
I WORK FOR JULES.

724
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,900
YEAH, SHE'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.
I KNOW.

725
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,700
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE,

726
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,630
BUT I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE
LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW,

727
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,230
AND IT APPEARED
YOU WERE DRINKING SOMETHING

728
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,960
FROM A PAPER BAG.

729
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,330
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, MAN.

730
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,630
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER
YOU CAN'T DRIVE HER TODAY,

731
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,530
OR I'M GONNA HAVE TO.

732
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,800
WE ALL GOOD?

733
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,330
YEAH.

734
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,830
JULES,
I'M SORRY TO DO THIS,

735
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,460
BUT I'M ACTUALLY
NOT FEELING SO HOT.

736
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,730
NOT SURE I SHOULD BE DRIVING.

737
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,930
I WOULDN'T WANT TO
GIVE YOU ANYTHING.

738
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,030
OH, SURE.

739
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,400
YEAH, NO, YOU SHOULD
TAKE THE DAY OFF

740
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,800
AND FEEL BETTER, OKAY?

741
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,500
THANKS.

742
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,930
I'M HAPPY
TO COVER FOR MIKE.

743
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,960
THAT'S OKAY.
BECKY CAN DRIVE ME.

744
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,330
REALLY?
YOU WANT TO GIVE HER MORE TO DO?

745
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,130
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF I DON'T GET IN THE FRONT.

746
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,660
I-I'M NOT TRYING TO BE RUDE.
I JUST THINK BETTER IN THE BACK.

747
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,800
I MEAN, I COULD
GET IN THE FRONT, BUT...

748
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,930
NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS PERFECT.

749
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,030
YEAH.

750
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,700
AND EVERYTHING YOU HEAR IN THE
CAR IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

751
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,600
OKAY?
GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

752
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,630
HI, MOM.
OH, I FOUND YOU.

753
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,060
YEAH. SO, WHAT'S UP?
HOW'S EVERYTHING?

754
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,000
WELL, YOUR DAD AND I
ARE FINALLY PUTTING TOGETHER

755
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,830
ALL OUR RESEARCH
AT THE HOSPITAL.

756
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,060
THAT'S GREAT.

757
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,400
I HEAR YOU TYPING.

758
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,730
THAT'S BETTER.

759
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,530
SO, WE'VE BEEN STUDYING
WOMEN UNDER 40

760
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,530
WHO SLEEP LESS THAN
SIX HOURS A NIGHT.

761
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,830
AND WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?
IT'S INTERESTING.

762
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,930
IT SEEMS LIKE
THEY'RE 38% MORE LIKELY

763
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,660
TO EXPERIENCE MAJOR WEIGHT GAIN

764
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,100
COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO SLEPT
SEVEN HOURS A NIGHT.

765
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,430
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

766
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,000
YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN TWO YEARS.

767
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,230
WELL, I CAN'T CHANGE
THE FACTS, DEAR.

768
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,300
MOM, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M RUSHING INTO THE
CITY FOR A MEETING AND I NEED TO PREPARE.

769
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,200
CAN I CALL YOU
WHEN I GET HOME?

770
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,000
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

771
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,760
OKAY. LOVE YOU.

772
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,630
THANK YOU.

773
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,000
HEY, HOW WE DOING?

774
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,130
DID YOU LOOK OVER
THE MATERIAL ON ATWOOD?

775
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,560
YEAH, I DID.

776
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,230
UH, HE HAD A GREAT RUN AT
TRAVELOCITY AND CITIGROUP...

777
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,660
AND I GET IT.
HE'S MAJOR.

778
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,760
HE IS.
AND THE BEST THING ABOUT HIM

779
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,530
IS HE'S BEEN WATCHING US,
AND HE LOVES WHAT WE'RE DOING.

780
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,860
BUT HE'S ONLY ONE OF THE NAMES
ON THE LIST.

781
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,630
SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIM,
WE MOVE ON.

782
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,500
BUT, JULES,
TRY TO BE OPEN.

783
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,660
HE'S SUPPOSED TO
BE BRILLIANT.

784
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,830
AND THE V.C.S LOVE HIM.
A LOT.

785
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,030
MARK ZUCKERBERG
NEVER BROUGHT IN A CEO,

786
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,630
AND HE WAS A TEENAGER.

787
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,230
CALL ME AFTER.

788
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,430
OKAY.

789
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,660
OH, THANKS,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

790
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,260
I CAN OPEN THE DOOR.
SURE.

791
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,760
OKAY, SO, THIS SHOULDN'T
TAKE MORE THAN AN HOUR.

792
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,060
BUT IF YOU CAN'T STAY HERE,

793
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,860
I'LL CALL BECKY
AND THEN SHE'LL FIND YOU.

794
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,160
AND THEN
YOU CAN JUST PULL UP...

795
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,400
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL BE HERE.

796
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,800
I THINK I FORGOT TO EAT TODAY.

797
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,760
SHOULD I PICK YOU UP
SOME SUSHI?

798
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,930
NO,
I EAT TOO MUCH MERCURY.

799
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,630
I'LL BE FINE.
I'M GOOD.

800
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,460
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF NAUSEOUS,
SO...

801
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,700
THAT WAS FAST.

802
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,160
NOT FAST ENOUGH.

803
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,030
OH, I-I PICKED YOU UP SOME SOUP
FROM A PLACE I KNOW.

804
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,060
THANKS.

805
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,360
YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO D...
TO DO...

806
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,330
OH, MY GOD,
THAT SMELLS SO GOOD.

807
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,660
GOOD.

808
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,130
WORD TRAVELS FAST.

809
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,330
PRETTY SHORT MEETING.

810
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,500
YEAH. I HATED HIM.
REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED?

811
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,600
I THOUGHT HE WAS A CONDESCENDING,
SEXIST KNOW-IT-ALL

812
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,760
WHO DID NOT SEEM TO GET
WHAT WE DO AT ALL.

813
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,100
AND, HONESTLY, I THINK
HE WOULD RUN OUR BUSINESS

814
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,260
IN A COMPLETELY INORGANIC WAY
THAT WOULD LOSE US

815
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,100
ALL THE CUSTOMERS
WE HAVE KILLED OURSELVES TO GET.

816
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,130
OH, AND I THINK
THAT HE WOULD REPLACE US

817
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,660
AS SOON AS
HE GOT THE CHANCE.

818
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,860
OH, AND...

819
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,860
THE MAN NEVER BLINKED.

820
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,100
AN OLYMPIAN NON-BLINKER.

821
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,960
OKAY, THEN.

822
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,230
YEAH.

823
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,400
SEE YOU IN THE A.M.?

824
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,330
BE THERE OR BE SQUARE.

825
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,700
I'M SORRY.

826
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,960
HEY, DON'T BE.

827
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,200
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR HELPING OUT WITH MIKE TODAY

828
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,900
AND FOR
GETTING ME CHICKEN SOUP.

829
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,360
OH, AND FOR CLEANING THAT MESS.
THAT WAS AWESOME.

830
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,660
SERIOUSLY.

831
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,660
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

832
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,400
IT'S OKAY.
I REALLY WON'T BITE.

833
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,130
YOU STARTED THIS BUSINESS ALL BY
YOURSELF A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,

834
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,600
AND NOW YOU HAVE
A STAFF OF 220 PEOPLE.

835
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,400
REMEMBER WHO DID THAT.

836
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,560
WHO?

837
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,730
UM, THANK YOU.

838
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,930
AND I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP.

839
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,660
MOMMY.
HEY!

840
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,760
HI.

841
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,300
HI.
HERE'S MY FAVORITE GIRL.

842
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,330
HEY, BABY.

843
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,860
HI, HONEY.
HEY.

844
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,030
OVER THE HUMP.

845
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,560
SO, HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

846
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,200
KIND OF OKAY.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

847
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,160
MADDIE SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT TO
BE MY FRIEND ANYMORE.

848
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,330
OH.

849
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,060
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T THINK SHE MEANT IT.

850
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,930
SHE'D MISS YOU TOO MUCH.

851
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:38,760
I'M STARTING TO THINK
THAT MADDIE IS BIPOLAR.

852
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,160
WE GO THROUGH THIS
EVERY OTHER DAY.

853
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,260
WE DO.

854
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,700
OH, HOW WAS YOUR MEETING?
IT WAS TODAY, RIGHT?

855
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,360
YEAH, JUST HAD IT.

856
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,730
MOMMY, I THINK I'M WINNING.
LOOK!

857
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,730
OH, THAT IS SO COOL.

858
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,030
YEAH, THAT'S
THE PLAY-DOH CAKE CHALLENGE.

859
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,700
WE'RE NOT FINISHING
UNTIL TOMORROW,

860
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,930
SO PLEASE HOLD
ON ALL JUDGING.

861
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,360
NOT TO MENTION THAT WE HAD
AN ACCIDENT WITH MINE

862
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,930
WHEN SOMEONE, NOT TO NAME
ANY NAMES, PUT HER ELBOW IN IT.

863
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,100
WHAT?
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

864
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,030
WELL, I GOT TO SAY,
I LOVE THE PINK ONE A LOT.

865
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,330
THAT'S MINE.
ARE YOU HAPPY AT ME?

866
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,860
I AM SO HAPPY AT YOU.
I'M BEYOND HAPPY AT YOU.

867
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
DADDY HELPED ME
WITH THE ICING.

868
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,360
GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.

869
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,130
SO, HOW ABOUT
I GIVE YOU YOUR BATH, OKAY?

870
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,630
WAIT, HANG ON.
I WAS WAITING FOR YOUR CALL.

871
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,700
SO,
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE GUY?

872
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,060
HE WASN'T
A GOOD FIT FOR ME.

873
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,430
BUT A LOT OF OTHER NAMES
ON THE LIST, SO...

874
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,560
YEAH.

875
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,400
I'M GONNA
BEAT YOU UPSTAIRS.

THAT'S RIGHT, HOMEY.
BEN'S GOT A JOB.

880
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,900
OH, YOU'RE NEVER HOME.

881
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,200

HI, UH, FIONA.

888
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,860
IT'S BEN WHITTAKER
FROM ABOUT THE FIT.

889
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,630
OH, HEY.
IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

890
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,230
OH, IT'S GOOD
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE, TOO.

891
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,430
IT WAS GREAT
MEETING YOU TODAY.

892
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,900
I CALLED YOU QUICKER
THAN YOU THOUGHT I WOULD.

893
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,930
I'M GLAD YOU DID.

894
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,560
JULES.

895
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,500
SHH.
LET HER SLEEP, DAD.

896
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,560
OKAY.

897
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,330
OKAY.

898
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,960
WHEN I HEARD THAT,
I WAS LIKE, "GOOD,

899
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,630
BECAUSE I DEFINITELY WASN'T
EATING LUNCHABLES BEFORE."

900
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,000
YEAH, THEY'RE COMING OUT WITH

901
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,830
A MORE GROWN-UP VERSION
OF LUNCHABLES.

902
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,230
UH, THEY'RE CALLED
SO YOU STILL CAN'T COOK-ABLES.

903
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,860
UH, GROW-UP-ABLES ALREADY.

904
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,300
I TRIED TO STAY UP.

905
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,930
I KNOW.

906
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,960
I'M SORRY I FELL ASLEEP IN THERE.
I JUST PASSED OUT.

907
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,130
I KNOW WE HAD A PLAN TO HAVE
A GROWN-UP CONVERSATION.

908
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,130
YOU WANT TO
NETFLIX SOMETHING?

909
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,130
HM?

910
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,760
I'M SORRY.
I JUST FELL OUT FOR A SECOND.

911
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,000
IT'S OKAY.

912
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,600
PAIGE LEARNED TO SAY
"HUMONGOUS" TODAY.

913
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,760
REALLY?

914
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,200
CRACKS ME UP.

915
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,230
SHE LOOKS AT ME,
SHE SAYS,

916
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,760
"YOU'RE A VERY HUMONGOUS DAD,
DAD."

917
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
OH.

918
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,630
OH, GOD. YOU KNOW I HATE
TO SOUND LIKE THE OTHER MOMS.

919
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,500
BUT I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
I NEED A LITTLE ME TIME.

920
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,260
I KNOW.

921
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,860
GOOD NIGHT.

922
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,900
ANYBODY HOME?

923
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,900
CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN,
JULE.

924
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,500
WE'LL DO IT TOMORROW,
OKAY?

925
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,100
CAN YOU TURN OUT
YOUR LIGHT?

926
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,400
HELLO?

927
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,000
HEY, BEN.
IT'S BECKY.

928
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,360
FROM JULES' OFFICE?

929
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,830
YEAH, HEY.
WHAT'S UP?

930
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,060
JULES' DRIVER IS M.I.A.

931
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,300
HE'S NOT ANSWERING
ANY OF MY TEXTS.

932
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,060
I KNOW
YOU DROVE JULES YESTERDAY,

933
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,430
AND I DIDN'T HEAR
ANY COMPLAINTS.

934
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,960
SO CAN YOU PICK HER UP
THIS MORNING?

935
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,100
SURE.
YOU KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES?

936
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,930
I WAS THERE YESTERDAY.
OKAY, SO YOU REMEMBER.

937
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,730
YEAH.
AND YOU'RE HEARING ME, RIGHT?

938
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,330
LOUD AND CLEAR, BOSS.

939
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,800
OKAY, SO BE THERE AT 7:45,
RING THE BELL, AND WALK AWAY.

940
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,900
SHE'LL KNOW IT'S YOU.

941
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,560
RING BELL, WALK AWAY.
GOT IT.

942
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,260
OH, WALK AWAY.

943
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,260
HANG ON.
I'M COMING.

944
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,630
HI. HERE FOR JULES?

945
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,330
YEAH, HI, SORRY.
I'LL WAIT IN THE CAR.

946
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,760
UH, SHE'S ON A CALL.
DO YOU WANT TO COME IN?

947
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,130
I JUST MADE SOME COFFEE.

948
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,460
COULD BE A WHILE.

949
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,630
I'M MATT.

950
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,400
BEN WHITTAKER.

951
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,100
GOOD TO MEET YOU.
COME ON IN.

952
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,600
LEGOS EVERYWHERE,
SO WATCH YOUR STEP.

953
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,860
SURE.

954
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,630
MAYBE FEATURE SOME
BLOGGERS ON THE HOMEPAGE?

955
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,330
HAVE A SEAT, BEN.

956
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,260
HEY, PAIGE, THIS IS BEN.
HE WORKS WITH MOMMY.

957
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,500
HI.
HI.

958
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,330
I'M PLAYING
PRINCESS MEMORY GAME.

959
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,030
OH, YEAH.
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO WIN.

960
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,460
SO,
YOUR JULES' NEW DRIVER?

961
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,760
NO, ACTUALLY,
I'M HER INTERN.

962
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,000
THAT'S HYSTERICAL.

963
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,060
YOU KNOW WHAT AN INTERN IS?
NO.

964
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,900
THAT'S OKAY.
EVERYONE THINKS IT'S HYSTERICAL.

965
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,700
HEY, MATT, DID A...

966
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,500
MORNING.

967
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,000
MORNING.

968
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,130
IS THAT ALL
DRY-CLEANING?

969
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,400
THESE THREE ARE.
THESE TWO ARE LAUNDRY.

970
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,930
AND THIS BUTTON...
THIS BUTTON IS MISSING.

971
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,400
I MEAN, IT'S LOOSE, SO...

972
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,430
OKAY.
IF THEY COULD JUST...

973
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,730
YOU GOT IT.
THANKS.

974
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,160
HEY, AND, HONEY,
UH, BEFORE YOU LEAVE,

975
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,500
JUST GOT TO
GO OVER A COUPLE THINGS.

976
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,560
OKAY.

977
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,030
LOOK WHO I FOUND.
YAY!

978
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,330
HE WAS IN YOUR HAMPER.
THANK YOU.

979
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,060
MATTY,
DID AN ATF BOX ARRIVE FOR ME?

980
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,460
ON THE TABLE.

981
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,460
UH, I... I THINK
I'LL JUST WAIT... WAIT OUT...

982
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,800
BEN.
DO YOU WANT A RAISIN?

983
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,460
THANK YOU.

984
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,260
OKAY, SO TONIGHT,
YOU'RE WORKING...

985
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,360
ARE YOU LISTENING,
OR DID I LOSE YOU?

986
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,430
BEN,
IS SHE LISTENING?

987
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,900
I AM TOTALLY LISTENING.

988
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,300
I ORDERED SOME STUFF
TO CHECK ON HOW IT ARRIVED.

989
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
NOT GREAT,
BY THE WAY.

990
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,500
GO ON.
TONIGHT?

991
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,300
YEAH, OKAY.
YOU'RE WORKING,

992
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,130
SO PAIGE AND I ARE GONNA
GO TO MY MOM'S FOR DINNER.

993
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,160
AFTER SCHOOL'S
RUBY'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

994
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,860
AND, UH,
WHAT ABOUT NEXT MONDAY?

995
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,000
DO YOU KNOW YET IF WE CAN GO TO
DINNER WITH ROBBIE AND ANNIE?

996
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,600
OH,
I'M SO SLAMMED NEXT WEEK.

997
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,100
I'M SORRY.
IF YOU WANT TO GO, I'LL MAKE IT.

998
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,800
WHEN WAS IT?
OH, MY GOD. MONDAY.

999
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,960
OKAY, I'M SORRY. I WAS FIXATED
ON THIS TISSUE PAPER.

1000
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,360
I WILL BE THERE.

1001
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,730
OKAY.

1002
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,900
THANK YOU FOR THE COFFEE.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME PLAY.

1003
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,030
OH! SORRY.

1004
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,330
I'LL MEET YOU IN THE CAR.

1005
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,560
ACTUALLY, I HAVE TO GO.
COME ON, SWEETIE.

1006
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,030
BEN, WE'RE GONNA
DROP PAIGE AT SCHOOL, OKAY?

1007
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,430
HERE WE GO.
LET'S DO IT.

1008
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,400
KISS DADDY GOODBYE.
MWAH!

1009
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,760
HEY, WAIT.
YOU FORGOT YOUR DOGGY.

1010
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,560
MATT SEEMS LIKE
A TERRIFIC GUY.

1011
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,960
HMM?

1012
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,330
SORRY,
DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

1013
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,000
UH, THAT'S OKAY.
I AGREE. HE IS.

1014
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,500
WHO? THE DAD?

1015
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,600
THAT'S WHAT THE OTHER KIDS
CALL MATT

1016
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,430
BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY DAD
IN A SEA OF MOMS.

1017
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,930
I'VE READ ABOUT
THESE HOUSEHUSBANDS.

1018
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,830
IT'S INTERESTING
HOW THAT ALL WORKED JUST NOW.

1019
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,160
THEY ACTUALLY PREFER TO BE
CALLED STAY-AT-HOME DADS.

1020
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,130
OH, SORRY.
DID NOT KNOW THAT.

1021
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,100
WELL,
IT'S VERY ADMIRABLE.

1022
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,060
HE'S A REAL
21ST-CENTURY FATHER.

1023
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,360
HE IS.

1024
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,300
HE ACTUALLY
HAD A GREAT JOB IN MARKETING,

1025
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,330
BUT, UM,
WHEN ABOUT THE FIT TOOK OFF,

1026
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:23,000
HE LEFT
TO BE A FULL-TIME DAD.

1027
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,600
TOTALLY SAVED OUR BUTTS.

1028
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,300
OH, WE'RE HERE,
BIG GIRL.

1029
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,700
I DO THIS IN THE CAFETERIA

1030
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,030
TO MY LUNCH FRIENDS
WHEN THEY'RE DON'T LOOKING.

1031
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,630
YOU DO THAT?
HEY, JULES.

1032
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,730
HI.
NICE TO SEE YOU HERE.

1033
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,330
UH, NOT SURE
IF YOU GOT OUR E-MAIL,

1034
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,030
BUT WE'RE DOING A FIESTA LUNCH
NEXT FRIDAY,

1035
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,000
AND WE THOUGHT
YOU COULD BRING THE GUACAMOLE.

1036
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,200
UH, YOU PROBABLY WON'T HAVE TIME
TO MAKE IT, SO YOU CAN BUY IT.

1037
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,960
WHICH IS FINE.

1038
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,830
ENOUGH FOR 18.

1039
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,560
NO, I CAN MAKE IT.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

1040
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,660
GREAT.
MATT CAN BRING IT.

1041
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,700
TOTALLY.

1042
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,530
BYE.

1043
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,400
ALL RIGHT.
HAVE A GREAT DAY, SWEET PEA.

1044
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,860
HAVE FUN AT RUBY'S PARTY,
OKAY?

1045
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,260
MOMMY? DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO MAKE GUACAMOLE?

1046
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,830
YES, I DO.
REALLY WELL, IN FACT.

1047
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,630
WE'RE...
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT TOGETHER.

1048
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,860
AND AFTER THAT, WE'LL HAVE
A MOTHER-DAUGHTER DANCE PARTY?

1049
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,230
HEY, MADDIE.
WHAT'S UP?

1050
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,860
BIPOLAR.

1051
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,330
OH, MY GOD.

1052
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,560
COME HERE.

1053
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,000
OH, I LOVE YOU,
BIG GIRL.

1054
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,630
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

1055
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,130
GOD.

1056
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,460
TAKING THE HIGH ROAD
IS EXHAUSTING.

1057
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,360
IT'S 2015.

1058
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,430
ARE WE REALLY STILL CRITICAL
OF WORKING MOMS?

1059
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,130
SERIOUSLY? STILL?

1060
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,460
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS ALL RHETORICAL.

1061
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,030
THERE'S NO NEED
TO RESPOND.

1062
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,460
WASN'T GOING TO.

1063
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,060
OH, BEN.

1064
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,460
I WANT TO
STOP BY THE WAREHOUSE.

1065
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,130
480 GREENPOINT.

1066
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:17,500
SURE.

1067
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,830
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU WANT TO MAKE A RIGHT.

1068
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,760
9TH TO HAMILTON
TO THE EXPRESSWAY.

1069
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,960
UH, I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE
4TH TO FLATBUSH. MUCH FASTER.

1070
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,500
I-IT WON'T BE.

1071
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,700
BY 12 MINUTES, AT LEAST.

1072
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,930
CAN I TRY?

1073
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,100
I APOLOGIZE.

1074
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,830
NO NEED.

1075
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:42,060
TRY TO LINE THE DOTS UP
THE BEST YOU CAN.

1076
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,830
AND THEN...

1077
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,000
OKAY.

1078
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,060
IF YOU CAN,
TRY TO PULL THIS TOWARDS YOU,

1079
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,130
HOLDING IT ON THE OUTSIDE.

1080
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,500
GOOD MEETING YOU.

1081
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,800
OKAY, SO THEN
PUT THAT ON LIGHTLY.

1082
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,930
PUT IT DOWN WITH TWO.
SECURE IT.

1083
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,400
OUR PACKAGE SHOULD FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE GETTING

1084
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,630
A LITTLE GIFT
THAT THEY BOUGHT FOR THEMSELVES.

1085
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,060
<i>♪ TALL AND TAN
AND YOUNG AND LOVELY ♪</i>

1086
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,760
<i>♪ THE GIRL FROM IPANEMA
GOES WALKING ♪</i>

1087
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,260
IT'S OPEN.

1088
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,330
BEN.

1089
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,830
WOW.
COME ON IN.

1090
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,830
DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.
YEAH.

1091
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,530
I LIKE TO THINK OF IT
AS A LITTLE BIT OF PARADISE.

1092
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,100
CAN I INTEREST YOU IN A BACK RUB?
OH, NO, THANKS.

1093
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,730
I JUST CAME BY BECAUSE
I FOUND OUT I HAVE TO WORK LATE.

1094
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,700
OH.
THEN NO DINNER TONIGHT.

1095
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,560
SORRY. I WAS REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

1096
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,160
BUT I'M HOPING
WE CAN PICK ANOTHER NIGHT.

1097
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,200
OF COURSE.
COME SIT DOWN.

1098
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,860
LET ME HAVE YOUR JACKET.

1099
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,360
OH.
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

1100
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,300
COME ON. RELAX.

1101
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,030
OKAY,
HOW ABOUT A FOOT MASSAGE?

1102
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,400
DURING OFFICE HOURS?

1103
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,630
YEAH,
THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT.

1104
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,300
MAY I?
WELL...

1105
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,460
OKAY.

1106
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,330
IT'S ALREADY
PRETTY GOOD.

1107
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,300
ALL I'VE DONE
IS TAKE OFF YOUR SOCK.

1108
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,430
WELL,
NO ONE'S EVER DONE THAT BETTER.

1109
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,100
JUST RELAX.

1110
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,330
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

1111
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,060
PUT YOUR HEAD BACK.

1112
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,500
OH.

1113
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
SO, WHEN WOULD YOU
LIKE TO RESCHEDULE?

1114
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,930
TOMORROW?

1115
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,200
CAN'T TOMORROW.
WHAT ABOUT SATURDAY?

1116
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,430
GOOD.

1117
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:18,200
OH, GOD.
THIS IS ENORMOUSLY SATISFYING.

1118
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,460
WHAT TIME
SHOULD I PICK YOU UP?

1119
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,630
NOON?
I LOVE DAYTIME DATES.

1120
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,630
LUNCH, PERFECT.
IT'S SOONER.

1121
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,000
SO, HOW'S IT GOING?
HOW'S JULES?

1122
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,560
I MEAN, SHE WORKS ON
ALL CYLINDERS ALL THE TIME.

1123
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,700
DOESN'T STOP, DOESN'T SLEEP,
NEVER SEE HER EAT.

1124
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,160
MAYBE IT'S GOOD THAT I'M HERE,
YOU KNOW?

1125
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,960
I HOPE I CAN HELP HER.

1126
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,100
I KNEW
YOU WERE GONNA BE A GOOD GUY.

1127
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,560
I KNEW IT.

1128
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,830
TRY TO RELAX.

1129
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,260
OH.

1130
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,800
OH.

1131
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,860
OH.

1132
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,260
OOH.

1133
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,100
OH. WOW.

1134
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,800
OH, MY GOD.

1135
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,360
I'M SORRY! I'M LEAVING!
I'M LEAVING!

1136
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,400
SORRY! DON'T STOP!
I'M LEAVING.

1137
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,830
OH, MY SHOE.

1138
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:04,960
SORRY.

1139
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,900
SO?
I DON'T KNOW, KID.

1140
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,460
THIS LEASE
DOESN'T LOOK SO HOT TO ME.

1141
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,230
THREE-MONTH SECURITY DEPOSIT.
YOU MUST REALLY LOVE THIS PLACE.

1142
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:16,700
NO, IT'S HORRIBLE.

1143
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,130
BUT I CAN GET IN
THIS WEEK.

1144
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,530
WELL, IF I WERE YOU,
I'D KEEP LOOKING.

1145
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,830
OKAY.
HEY, LEWIS.

1146
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,000
WHAT'S UP?
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU SO AWAKE.

1147
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,960
I WAS JUST ASKED TO DELIVER
THIS HUGE ORDER TO TRIBECA,

1148
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,730
AND I THINK
IT'S TO JAY Z'S APARTMENT.

1149
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,360
I'M NOT KIDDING.
LOOK, IT SAYS, "S. CARTER."

1150
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,660
I'M A LITTLE FREAKED OUT.
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS,

1151
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,330
BUT IS THIS
SOMEONE YOU WANT TO IMPRESS?

1152
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,030
THIS IS A GENIUS, BEN.

1153
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,560
WHOA, WHAT IF BEYONCÉ
OPENS THE DOOR?

1154
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,100
OH, MY GOD.

1155
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,830
OKAY, NOW I KNOW
WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1156
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,430
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT ON
A PROPER SHIRT WITH A COLLAR.

1157
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,200
A COLLAR?
THESE ARE HIP-HOP PEOPLE.

1158
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,660
DRESS TO IMPRESS, LEWIS.
GO TO THE RACK.

1159
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,230
FIND A BOYFRIEND SHIRT
THAT FITS.

1160
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,860
BRING THE HAIR DOWN IF YOU CAN.
TUCK IN THE SHIRT.

1161
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,700
WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY
TUCK ANYTHING IN ANYMORE?

1162
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,160
OH, I'M ASKING YOU.

1163
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,230
OKAY, OKAY.

1164
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,430
BENJAMIN...

1165
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,960
WE MADE SOME PROGRESS.

1166
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,700
VERY BIG DAY
FOR THE INTERN TEAM.

1167
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,830
IT WAS GREAT.

1168
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:05,060
I MEAN, SHE YELLED AT ME,
BUT...

1169
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,460
SHE YELLS AT ME
ALL THE TIME, TOO.

1170
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,660
RIGHT?
IT WAS COMMUNICATION.

1171
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,960
YEAH.
IT WAS A BREAKTHROUGH.

1172
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,000
YEAH.

1173
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,800
WHOO!
OH, YOU WANT ONE TOO?

1174
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,300
YEAH.
OKAY.

1175
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,100
OKAY, BOYS. I'M POSSIBLY
MEETING JAY Z AND/OR BEYONCÉ,

1176
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,130
AND I'M IN A BLOUSE.

1177
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,460
WEAR IT, DUDE.
IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT.

1178
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,460
NOT TRUE.

1179
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,900
BIG ONE.

1180
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,760
I HATE EATING ALONE.
SO DO I.

1181
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,700
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
HAVE TO KEEP DOING THAT.

1182
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,960
OH, FORCE OF HABIT.

1183
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,930
HERE YOU GO.

1184
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,160
SWIPED THESE
FROM THE TECH FRIDGE.

1185
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,530
OH, NICE GOING.

1186
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,330
YOU WANT A SLICE?

1187
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,230
SURE, THANKS.

1188
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,600
CHEERS.

1189
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,960
CHEERS.

1190
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,660
I NOTICED
A COUPLE HOURS AGO,

1191
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,030
YOU HAD A MEETING
WITH ANOTHER POSSIBLE CEO.

1192
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:27,460
I SAW HIM ARRIVE.
HOW'D THAT GO?

1193
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,360
IT WAS GOING WELL...

1194
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,800
UNTIL HE CALLED US...

1195
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,630
I BELIEVE THE TERM HE USED
WAS A "CHICK SITE."

1196
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:37,160
AND I DIDN'T HEAR
ANYTHING HE SAID AFTER THAT.

1197
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,100
APPARENTLY, SELLING CLOTHES
MAKES US A "CHICK SITE."

1198
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,230
I MEAN, REALLY?

1199
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,630
HOW IS THIS NOT LEGIT?

1200
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,430
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
I FIND THAT SURPRISING.

1201
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,930
REALLY?
SEXISM IN BUSINESS?

1202
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,860
SO...

1203
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,300
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR WORK, BEN,
BEFORE YOU RETIRED?

1204
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,700
I WAS A V.P.
FOR DEX ONE.

1205
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,830
PHONEBOOKS?

1206
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,900
YEAH.
I WAS IN CHARGE OF PRINTING,

1207
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,360
AND BEFORE THAT I RAN
SALES AND ADVERTISING.

1208
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,160
BIG JOBS.

1209
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,760
WASN'T THIS A FACTORY
THAT USED TO MAKE PHONEBOOKS?

1210
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,660
NO. WHAT?

1211
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,700
YEAH.
WHAT?

1212
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,560
THIS IS
WHERE YOU WORKED?

1213
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,930
FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS.

1214
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,800
YEAH.

1215
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,560
FOR TWENTY-SOME YEARS
I SAT RIGHT BY THAT WINDOW.

1216
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,660
THAT WAS MY OFFICE.

1217
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,830
IT WAS
A FEW STEPS UP BACK THEN.

1218
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,600
WE'D LOOK OUT
OVER THE WHOLE FACTORY.

1219
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,130
OUR PRINTING PRESSES
WERE IN THAT CORNER.

1220
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,260
THAT'S WHY THE FLOOR DIPS
BACK THERE.

1221
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,760
NO WAY.

1222
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,560
I KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS BUILDING.

1223
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,060
OR USED TO.

1224
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,030
YOU KNOW THE SYCAMORES ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING?

1225
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,160
YEAH.
THE BIG ONES?

1226
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,700
YEAH. THE BIG ONES.
I LOVE THEM.

1227
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,130
YEAH. I REMEMBER
THE DAY THEY WERE PLANTED.

1228
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,400
IS IT TOTALLY WEIRD
BEING BACK HERE?

1229
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,930
WELL,
IT FEELS LIKE HOME.

1230
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,960
IT'S... REMODELED, BUT...

1231
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,200
HOME.

1232
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,930
SO YOU'RE ON FACEBOOK,
HUH?

1233
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,530
WELL, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
FIGURE IT OUT.

1234
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,900
I JOINED
ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO.

1235
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,330
WELL, BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

1236
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,660
YOU WANT SOME HELP?

1237
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,730
I'D LOVE SOME, BUT, REALLY,
YOU'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO.

1238
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,200
NO,
I NEED A DIVERSION.

1239
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,100
YOU HAVE A PHOTO OF YOURSELF?

1240
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,300
NO. I NEED ONE?
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK UP

1241
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,630
ALL THOSE HOTTIES
FROM HIGH SCHOOL, YOU DO.

1242
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:31,900
SAY CHEESE.

1243
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,160
CHEESE.

1244
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,200
THAT'S CUTE.

1245
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,400
OKAY,
I JUST NEED TO SEND THAT TO YOU.

1246
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,960
UH, ALL RIGHT.

1247
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,800
SO THERE ARE ALL THESE QUESTIONS
FOR YOUR PROFILE

1248
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,760
THAT YOU CAN ANSWER
IF YOU WANT TO OR NOT.

1249
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,500
LIKE RELIGIOUS VIEWS,
POLITICAL VIEWS...

1250
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,530
PEOPLE WHO INSPIRE YOU...

1251
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,830
JULES OSTIN.

1252
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,160
I'M NOT TRYING TO
BROWNNOSE YOU,

1253
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,060
BUT I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
A LONG TIME,

1254
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,960
AND I'VE NEVER RUN ACROSS
ANYONE QUITE LIKE YOU.

1255
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,330
YOU DO INSPIRE, JULES.

1256
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,830
I JUST KNEW,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

1257
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,360
THAT A WOMAN
WITH A GLASS OF WINE

1258
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,830
AND A LAPTOP
HAD REAL SHOPPING POTENTIAL.

1259
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,630
AND IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY
PROMISE HER THINGS WOULD FIT...

1260
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:10,730
SEE?
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

1261
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,300
OKAY.

1262
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,760
MM.
YOU HAVE A FAVORITE QUOTE?

1263
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,200
I DO.

1264
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,230
"YOU'RE NEVER WRONG
TO DO THE RIGHT THING."

1265
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,330
WHO SAID THAT, YOU?
YEAH.

1266
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,630
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
MARK TWAIN SAID IT FIRST.

1267
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,100
OKAY,
FAVORITE MUSIC?

1268
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,230
UH, GEEZ. SAM COOKE,
ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES.

1269
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,700
LOVE MILES DAVIS,
BILLIE HOLIDAY.

1270
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,360
OH,
SHE WAS GREAT, RIGHT?

1271
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,530
I MEAN,
SHE COULD JUST, LIKE...

1272
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,730
TRANSPORT YOU.
OH, YEAH.

1273
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,030
OKAY, BOOKS?

1274
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,700
LOVE CLANCY, LUDLUM.

1275
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,330
CRAZY ABOUT
"HARRY POTTER."

1276
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,560
MATT LOVES "HARRY POTTER," TOO.
OH, YEAH?

1277
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,360
YEAH, LIKE, READ THEM ALL
THE WEEK THEY CAME OUT.

1278
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,900
WOW. ME, TOO.

1279
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,400
UM, OKAY, WHAT'S
YOUR RELATIONSHIP STATUS?

1280
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,700
ARE YOU MARRIED?

1281
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,200
SINGLE?

1282
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,760
WIDOWER.

1283
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,830
I'M SORRY.

1284
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:10,530
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
SAY SINGLE, THEN?

1285
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,200
YEAH.

1286
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,600
OKAY, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED NOW?

1287
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,760
YOU NEED
SOMEONE TO FRIEND.

1288
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,560
I'LL BE FRIENDS
WITH THE OTHER INTERNS.

1289
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,360
THEY'LL SHOW ME HOW TO DO IT
IN THE MORNING.

1290
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,730
WELL, YOU...
YOU CAN FRIEND ME.

1291
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,330
OKAY, THANK YOU.

1292
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,400
OKAY.

1293
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,500
OKAY.
CONGRATULATIONS.

1294
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,200
YOU ARE NOW OFFICIALLY PART
OF THE FACEBOOK GENERATION.

1295
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,060
GOOD DEAL.

1296
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,130
UM, YOU DONE?
YES, THANK YOU.

1297
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,360
OKAY.

1298
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,330
WELL, I HAVE, UH,
ABOUT ANOTHER HOUR OF WORK.

1299
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:46,000
YOU...
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

1300
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,530
OF COURSE.

1301
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,430
THIS WAS GREAT, JULES.

1302
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,200
YEAH.

1303
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,960
IT WAS NICE TO HAVE AN ADULT
CONVERSATION WITH AN ADULT MAN,

1304
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,260
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
LIKE, NOT ABOUT WORK.

1305
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,600
NOT ABOUT...

1306
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,630
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

1307
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,230
OH, WE'RE HERE?

1308
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,330
YEAH.

1309
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:36,260
WAS I SNORING?

1310
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,360
NO, NO, NO.
JUST SLEEPING.

1311
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,300
SORRY.

1312
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,200
MY PARENTS
ARE SLEEP RESEARCHERS,

1313
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,100
AND THEY'VE BEEN STUDYING
MY SLEEP MY WHOLE LIFE.

1314
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,800
APPARENTLY,
I'M A CLASSIC NOISY SLEEPER.

1315
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,300
FUN GETTING TO KNOW ME,
HUH?

1316
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,360
IT IS.

1317
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:57,100
I NEVER FALL ASLEEP IN THE CAR,
SO THAT WAS ACTUALLY AMAZING.

1318
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,530
APOLOGIZE FOR THE RACKET.

1319
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,360
BARELY NOTICED.

1320
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,500
I'LL PRETEND
I BELIEVE YOU.

1321
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,230
I LOVE THIS HOUSE.

1322
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,430
IT JUST
LOOKS HAPPY TO ME.

1323
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,300
LIKE,
IF IT WAS IN A KID'S BOOK,

1324
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,830
IT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD WHEN
YOU TURNED THE PAGE AND SAW IT.

1325
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,260
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1326
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,700
I DO.

1327
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,430
WELL...

1328
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,430
SAYONARA.

1329
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,460
SAYONARA.

1330
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,700
I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU COME IN.

1331
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,730
YOU KNOW...

1332
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:46,900
I WAS THINKING...

1333
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,660
WE NEED
SOME AWAKE TIME TOGETHER.

1334
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,400
YEAH, THAT, TOO.

1335
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,460
MORNING.

1336
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,500
GOOD MORNING.
I'M DORIS.

1337
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,100
THEY ASKED ME
TO DRIVE YOU TODAY.

1338
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,230
ARE YOU
ALL SET BACK THERE?

1339
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,700
YOU GOT
YOUR SEAT BELT FASTENED?

1340
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,200
WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN?

1341
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,760
OH, SOMEBODY SAID
THAT HE GOT TRANSFERRED.

1342
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,960
UM, YOU KNOW THE BEST WAY
TO GET BACK TO HEADQUARTERS?

1343
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,430
OH!
OH, MY!

1344
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,930
OH, WHAT...

1345
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:53,200
COME ON!
HOLD YOUR HORSES, MANIAC!

1346
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,660
WHICH WAY, HON?

1347
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,100
I'M ALL TURNED AROUND HERE.
DORIS.

1348
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,560
DORIS! DORIS!
WHAT? WHAT?!

1349
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,700
YOU TOLD ME
TO TRANSFER HIM.

1350
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,460
THAT WAS TWO DAYS AGO.
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHECK WITH ME?

1351
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,830
FIRST OF ALL,
THAT WAS YESTERDAY.

1352
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,430
WELL, WHERE IS HE?
DO YOU KNOW?

1353
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,630
THANK YOU.

1354
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:23,000
YOU MUST THINK
I'M DEMENTED.

1355
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,330
NOT THE WORD I WOULD USE,

1356
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,630
BUT I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED
WHEN I GOT THE CALL.

1357
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,800
JULES, I APOLOGIZE
IF I OVERSTEPPED IN SOME WAY.

1358
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,000
NO. NO, NO, NO.
NO, PLEASE DON'T APOLOGIZE.

1359
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,660
YOU HAVE DONE
NOTHING WRONG.

1360
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:37,530
LOOK, I HAVE A LOT GOING ON,
AND I'M A VERY PRIVATE PERSON.

1361
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,130
AND AT FIRST, I DON'T KNOW,
I THOUGHT

1362
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:41,230
MAYBE THIS WASN'T GONNA WORK,
BUT I WAS WRONG.

1363
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,800
LET ME GET
ONE OF THOSE.

1364
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,060
NO, NO, NO.
NO.

1365
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,760
JULES, NO EXPLANATION NECESSARY.
PLEASE.

1366
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,900
NO, ACTUALLY, ONE IS BECAUSE
I AM USUALLY BETTER THAN THIS.

1367
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,400
THE TRUTH IS...

1368
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,830
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU
MAKES ME FEEL CALM

1369
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:59,930
OR MORE CENTERED OR SOMETHING,
AND I-I COULD USE THAT.

1370
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,400
OBVIOUSLY.

1371
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,130
I HOPE YOU'LL ACCEPT MY APOLOGY
AND COME BACK TO WORK FOR ME.

1372
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,830
IF YOU WANT.

1373
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,000
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS

1374
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,260
BECAUSE
I SCREWED UP THIS MORNING.

1375
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,230
BUT I WAS THINKING THAT

1376
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:14,930
I'D LIKE TO BRING YOU UP TO
MY AREA, NEXT TO BECKY.

1377
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:18,660
I KNOW YOU CAN HANDLE MORE WORK.
IF YOU'D LIKE MORE. I...

1378
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,530
OH, GOD, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I HATE

1379
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:21,900
THAT I JUMPED THE GUN
AND I MADE YOU FEEL...

1380
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,530
I'M COMING BACK.
I-I'M HAPPY TO COME BACK.

1381
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,330
EXCELLENT.

1382
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,360
CAN I GIVE YOU A LIFT
BACK TO THE OFFICE?

1383
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,800
SURE, THANKS.
CAN I TAKE THIS?

1384
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,600
NO.

1385
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,660
ACTUALLY,
DO YOU MIND DRIVING?

1386
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,260
I DON'T TECHNICALLY HAVE A LICENSE.
SURE.

1387
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,660
THIS IS...
THIS IS CRAZY, BEN.

1388
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,160
TWO DESKS
ARE NOT GONNA FIT IN HERE.

1389
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,630
NO, I PROMISE
I'LL STAY OUT OF YOUR WAY.

1390
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,830
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE
NOW I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR...

1391
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,000
HI.
HI.

1392
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,260
THIS IS GOOD, RIGHT?

1393
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,760
I LIKE THIS ARRANGEMENT.

1394
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,230
UH, BECKY, I WANT YOU TO LET BEN
GIVE YOU A HAND, OKAY?

1395
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,600
AND CC HIM
ON ALL MY E-MAILS?

1396
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,100
DID WE GET
YESTERDAY'S NUMBERS?

1397
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,730
UH, YES, WE DID.
I SAW THEM HERE...

1398
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,860
HERE YOU GO.
THANKS.

1399
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,160
AND I NEED TO GO OVER THE DATA
ON CUSTOMER PURCHASE PATTERNS.

1400
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,560
LET BEN TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT, TOO.

1401
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,660
ACTUALLY, LET BEN
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FIRST.

1402
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,700
OKAY.

1403
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,660
DON'T WORRY, BECKY.
BACKUP'S GOOD.

1404
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,530
PING ME
WHEN CAMERON GETS IN?

1405
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,230
HEY.

1406
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,000
BECKY?

1407
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,400
I'VE BEEN HERE NINE MONTHS, BEN,
AND SHE'S NEVER ASKED ME

1408
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,560
TO TAKE A LOOK AT ANYTHING
FOR HER EVER, OKAY?

1409
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,300
I HEAR YOU.
THAT'S FRUSTRATING.

1410
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,430
I MEAN, TOTALLY.
I GRADUATED FROM PENN.

1411
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:47,860
I HAVE A BUSINESS DEGREE.

1412
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,560
BUT I NEVER SEEM TO DO
ANYTHING RIGHT AROUND HERE.

1413
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,600
AND YOU'RE LIKE 50 YEARS OLDER
THAN ME AND YOU'RE DEAF.

1414
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,630
I HAPPEN TO THINK YOU DO
A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT.

1415
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,830
YOU DO SO MUCH.

1416
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,930
I KNOW.
I KNOW THAT.

1417
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,360
MM-HMM.
BUT SHE DOESN'T.

1418
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:09,360
I MEAN, I BUST MY ASS FOR HER
14 HOURS A DAY,

1419
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,400
AND SHE NEVER NOTICES.

1420
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,630
OH. OH, MY GOD.

1421
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:16,730
I HATE
GIRLS WHO CRY AT WORK.

1422
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:19,000
HOW 'BOUT IF YOU,
JUST AS AN EXPERIMENT,

1423
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,300
TRY LETTING ME HELP YOU.

1424
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,800
A LOT OF YOUR STRESS
IS GONNA BE LIFTED

1425
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,730
ONCE YOU'RE OUT FROM UNDER
THIS MOUNTAIN OF WORRY.

1426
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:26,300
AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
LEAVING HERE AT A NORMAL HOUR

1427
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,500
ONCE IN A WHILE.

1428
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,960
SEE YOUR FRIENDS.
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

1429
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,530
MM-HMM. I CAN OFFER
MY ASSISTANCE IN THIS AREA.

1430
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:36,100
I WOULD LOVE TO,
ACTUALLY.

1431
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:40,300
I JUST DON'T WANT HER TO THINK
THAT I CAN'T DO MY JOB

1432
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,030
AND I NEED AN INTERN
TO HELP ME.

1433
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,130
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
WANT TO HEAR THIS,

1434
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:47,430
BUT I HEARD WOMEN WHO SLEEP
LESS THAN SEVEN HOURS A NIGHT

1435
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,000
GAIN 38% MORE WEIGHT

1436
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,760
THAN WOMEN WHO SLEEP
MORE THAN SEVEN HOURS A NIGHT.

1437
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,360
WHAT?!

1438
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,000
I LEAVE HERE AT 11:00.
I GET BACK AT 7:00.

1439
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,030
I SLEEP LIKE FIVE HOURS A NIGHT,
AND NOW I'M GONNA GET FAT?

1440
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:01,330
LET'S GET THROUGH THIS STUFF.
LET'S DO IT TOGETHER.

1441
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,930
LET'S CLEAN-SLATE IT.

1442
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,100
LET'S JUST DO IT.

1443
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,130
YES!
VERY NICE, ST. LOUIS.

1444
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,730
AH, SUEDE JACKET IN D.C.
I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW WELL
THAT SWEATER IS DOING.

1445
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,060
I'M SO HAPPY.

1446
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,760
BEAUTIFUL, MIAMI! THANK YOU.
OH! LOOK AT CHICAGO!

1447
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,730
SHE PUT THE SAME BOOTS IN HER
CART AS THE WOMAN FROM HOUSTON.

1448
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,630
OKAY, LET'S SEE
WHAT SHE DOES AT CHECKOUT.

1449
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,930
SHE'S NOT
BUYING THEM EITHER.

1450
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:21,960
OKAY, MAYBE CHECK THE
DELIVERY COST ON THOSE BOOTS?

1451
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,960
MM-HMM.

1452
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,630
KNOCK-KNOCK.
HEY.

1453
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:28,130
HI. I TOOK A LOOK
AT THE DATA PURCHASE PATTERNS.

1454
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,760
UH, SHOULD I COME BACK?

1455
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,700
NO, NO, COME ON IN.
THAT WAS FAST.

1456
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,530
WELL,
I ENLISTED BECKY'S HELP.

1457
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:36,260
IT SEEMS THE MOST EXPENSIVE
PLACE YOU'RE ADVERTISING

1458
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,360
IS ACTUALLY BRINGING YOU
THE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE
SPENDING THE LEAST.

1459
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,430
AND THE CHANNELS
YOU'RE LEAST INVESTING IN

1460
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:44,730
ARE ADDING ENORMOUS VALUE
IN SEGMENTS THAT CURRENTLY
APPEAR TO HAVE LOW VALUE

1461
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,760
BUT ACTUALLY HAVE
THE HIGHEST SPENDING POTENTIAL.

1462
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,060
THAT'S WHAT I COULD TELL
SO FAR.

1463
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,600
OH, BEN. CAN YOU, LIKE,
DEAL WITH THAT FOR ME?

1464
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,760
MAYBE COME UP WITH
A BETTER PLAN?

1465
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,330
I MEAN,
IF YOU HAVE THE TIME?

1466
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,860
HAPPY TO.

1467
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:01,030
THE MAN SPENT 40 YEARS
IN BUSINESS.

1468
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,260
YEAH, NO, I GET IT.

1469
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:04,030
AND, JULES, BECKY
WAS A HUGE HELP IN THIS.

1470
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,130
YOU KNOW SHE HAS
A BUSINESS DEGREE FROM PENN?

1471
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,530
I KNOW.

1472
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,330
I MEAN, I FORGOT,
BUT I KNOW.

1473
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,560
I'LL SAY SOMETHING
TO HER.

1474
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,100
THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE.

1475
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,760
HEY. HOW'S IT GOIN' UP HERE
IN FIRST-CLASS?

1476
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,200
BUSY. I SEE
YOU FOUND AN APARTMENT.

1477
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,300
NO.

1478
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,500
MY TWO WEEKS ARE UP.

1479
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,960
I'M MOVIN' IN
WITH MY COUSIN.

1480
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,930
EXCELLENT.

1481
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,360
IN PHILADELPHIA.

1482
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,600
DAVIS.
WHAT?

1483
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,530
I'LL GET THERE BY 11:00,
LEAVE AT 5:00.

1484
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,060
IT'S COOL.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

1485
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,200
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
EVERYBODY'S UNCLE AROUND HERE.

1486
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,430
YEAH, WHY IS THAT?

1487
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:39,700
BECAUSE
I'M GONNA SAVE YOUR ASS,

1488
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,760
AND I'M GONNA PUT YOU UP
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

1489
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,560
OBVIOUSLY.

1490
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,960
BEN, THANK YOU.

1491
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,660
MWAH!
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

1492
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,760
OKAY. OKAY.
EASY, FELLA.

1493
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,200
I LIKE THAT YOU DO
THE THROW PILLOW THING.

1494
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,400
I WAS MARRIED
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

1495
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,460
MM.

1496
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:00,500
WHOA.
IS THIS YOUR CLOSET?

1497
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,400
BUSY MAN ABOUT TOWN.

1498
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,960
WHAT'S IN
ALL THESE DRAWERS?

1499
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,000
BOXERS, T-SHIRTS,
POCKET SQUARES, HANDKERCHIEFS.

1500
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,930
OKAY, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF?

1501
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:11,530
THAT ONE
I JUST DON'T GET AT ALL.

1502
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,930
OKAY. IT'S ESSENTIAL.

1503
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:15,230
THAT YOUR GENERATION
DOESN'T KNOW THAT IS CRIMINAL.

1504
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:18,200
THE BEST REASON TO CARRY
A HANDKERCHIEF IS TO LEND IT.

1505
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,000
ASK JASON ABOUT THIS.

1506
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,300
WOMEN CRY, DAVIS.

1507
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,630
WE CARRY IT FOR THEM.

1508
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,060
ONE OF THE LAST VESTIGES
OF THE CHIVALROUS GENT.

1509
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,930
OH. WELL, THEN
IT'S DIFFERENT THAN A PO...

1510
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:28,500
I KNOW YOU WANT TO HANG,
BUT I...

1511
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,960
I HAVE TO GET SOME SLEEP, KID.
I'M POOPED.

1512
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,130
GOOD NIGHT, BEN.

1513
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,000
THANKS AGAIN.

1514
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:39,730
WILL YOU WAKE ME IN THE MORNING
OR IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

1515
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,600
MY PARENTS ALWAYS...
TOO MUCH.

1516
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,130
UNDERSTOOD. I'LL JUST
SET AN ALARM ON MY PHONE.

1517
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,900
I HOPE I CAN HEAR IT.
I'M SUCH A DEEP SLEEPER.

1518
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,900
OH, MY GOD.
I'LL WAKE YOU.

1519
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,200
THANK YOU!

1520
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,530
LOVE YOU!
NOT KIDDING!

1521
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,400
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
NOW GO TO BED.

1522
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,460
HERE'S SOME MORE BERRIES,
GUYS.

1523
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,200
BEN, CAN YOU POUR ME
MORE SYRUP, PLEASE?

1524
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,530
SURE CAN.

1525
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:03,400
THERE YOU GO.

1526
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,860
PERFECT.
GOOD JOB.

1527
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,260
OH, THANKS.

1528
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:10,660
OH, BOY. OKAY, SO, THIS REALLY
BIG CEO NAMED TOWNSEND,

1529
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,060
THE ONE EVERYONE SAID WOULD
NEVER BE INTERESTED IN US

1530
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,660
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T
BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM?

1531
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,030
YEAH?
YEAH?

1532
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,230
WE'RE LIKE
YOUR SISTER WIVES.

1533
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:22,360
WELL, WE JUST FOUND OUT
HE'S BEYOND INTERESTED.

1534
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,100
EXCITING.

1535
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,930
YEAH.

1536
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,000
MAYBE.

1537
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,600
EVERYONE'S FLIPPING OUT
ABOUT IT,

1538
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,630
BUT YOU KNOW
I'M STILL ON THE FENCE AT BEST.

1539
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,000
ANYWAY,
THE ONLY THING IS,

1540
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,600
I HAVE TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO
TO MEET HIM.

1541
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,930
HE CAN'T COME HERE.
WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO GO?

1542
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:38,430
THE ONLY DAY HE CAN MEET
IS NEXT THURSDAY.

1543
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,800
DO YOU WANT TO COME?

1544
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,500
MAYBE
WE CAN STAY THE WEEKEND?

1545
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,730
OH, THAT SOUNDS AWESOME.
UM...

1546
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:47,300
OH, THURSDAY I CAN'T.

1547
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,930
PAIGE IS SNACK LEADER
AT SCHOOL,

1548
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:50,600
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE CLASS WITH HER.

1549
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,460
IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL.
RIGHT.

1550
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,230
YEAH,
IT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL.

1551
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,060
NO, I KNOW, SWEETIE.
I'M SORRY. I FORGOT.

1552
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,960
UH,
MAYBE BEN COULD GO WITH YOU.

1553
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,860
YEAH,
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

1554
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,760
GUYS,
BEN HAS A LIFE.

1555
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,130
UH, NOT REALLY.

1556
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,900
NOT ONE THAT TAKES ME
TO SAN FRANCISCO.

1557
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,230
IF YOU WANT THE COMPANY,
I'D LOVE TO GO.

1558
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,300
REALLY?

1559
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,560
DEFINITELY.

1560
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,860
GUESS WHAT, BEN?
YES?

1561
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,060
TODAY,
MY DAD'S GONNA BE ARIEL.

1562
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,160
IT'S HIS TURN.

1563
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,900
OH, THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
REALLY GOOD.

1564
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,000
YOU GUYS THINK
FINDING A CEO IS A BIG DEAL?

1565
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,100
HERE, THE BIG NEGOTIATION
IS WHO GETS TO BE ARIEL

1566
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,160
WHEN WE'RE PLAYING
"LITTLE MERMAID."

1567
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,330
AND FOR THE RECORD,
IT'S NEVER BEEN MY TURN.

1568
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:30,460
MNH-MNH.

1569
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,060
SO THIS IS HUGE FOR ME.
I'M EXCITED.

1570
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,700
I GET TO COMB MY HAIR WITH A FORK...

1571
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,000
...PLAY WITH GADGETS AND GIZMOS APLENTY.

1572
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,730
DADDY!

1573
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:40,100
THIS IS JULES.

1574
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,900
SO, GUYS, HOW LONG
TILL WE GET IT FIXED?

1575
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,460
I MEAN, IF YOU CAN'T ZOOM IN,
YOU PROBABLY WON'T BUY.

1576
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,330
YEAH, THE FIRST COUPLE
HOURS ARE ALREADY DOWN 23%.

1577
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,700
OH, BOY.
OKAY.

1578
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,530
I WILL BE THERE IN LIKE...
TWO MINUTES.

1579
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:52,700
...TWO MINUTES.
WE'RE ON IT.

1580
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,100
BEN, DO YOU HAVE THE INFO
ON FRIENDS SHOPPING TOGETHER?

1581
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,830
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

1582
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:00,000
THIS IS JULES.
WHAT'S WRONG?

1583
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,130
OH, MOM, HI.

1584
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,830
UM, I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT THE ZOOM LINK...

1585
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,000
UM, THE BUTTON THAT YOU CLICK ON
TO ZOOM IN ON A PHOTO,

1586
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,700
ISN'T WORKING.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SUCH A BIG DEAL.

1587
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,330
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT IS.
UM...

1588
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:13,160
IT'S WHAT PEOPLE USE TO GET
A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT...

1589
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,530
EVERYBODY ZOOMS IN.

1590
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,100
I GUESS I DON'T GO TO YOUR
WEBSITE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT.

1591
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,700
OH, TYPING AND RINGING.

1592
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,230
YEAH, SORRY.
OH, IT'S THE WAREHOUSE.

1593
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:27,700
MOM, I'M SORRY.
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

1594
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,400
NO NEED.
OKAY, LOVE YOU.

1595
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,560
YEP.

1596
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,430
WHO SAYS "YEP"
TO "I LOVE YOU"?

1597
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,660
HI, ALONZO.

1598
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:40,660
HI, JULES.

1599
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,930
NOT GOOD NEWS.

1600
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,530
WHAT? OKAY.
LAY IT ON ME.

1601
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:46,230
IN A ROUTINE CHECK
BY THE SANITATION DEPARTMENT,

1602
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,600
THEY FOUND ONE BEDBUG.

1603
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,830
NO.
UNFORTUNATELY, YES.

1604
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:52,000
WE SENT OUT 4,800 BOXES
YESTERDAY.

1605
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,200
WE HAVE TO GET THEM ALL BACK,
SHUT DOWN THE WAREHOUSE...

1606
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,730
UGH.
...SPRAY FOR BEDBUGS,

1607
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,560
THEN WE CAN START SHIPPING
AGAIN.

1608
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,730
NIGHTMARE.
NIGHTMARE.

1609
01:08:58,730 --> 01:08:59,900
OKAY, HERE WE ARE.

1610
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,930
OKAY,
LET ME JUST FINISH THIS E-MAIL.

1611
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,100
NO!

1612
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,230
NO.

1613
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:24,300
NO, NO, NO.

1614
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,030
HEY, GUYS.
THANKS FOR COMING.

1615
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,360
I KNOW THE ZOOM IS BROKEN,

1616
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,830
AND I DON'T MEAN TO
PULL ANYONE OFF OF THAT,

1617
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,530
BUT I NEED A FAVOR.

1618
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:40,700
I ACCIDENTALLY SENT AN E-MAIL
TO THE WRONG PERSON,

1619
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,430
AND SHE'S AT WORK
RIGHT NOW.

1620
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,030
AND I KNOW SHE DOESN'T CHECK
HER PERSONAL E-MAIL

1621
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:45,560
UNTIL SHE GETS HOME
AT 5:30.

1622
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,430
SO I HAVE UNTIL THEN
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DELETE IT.

1623
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,330
BECAUSE IF THIS PERSON SEES
THIS E-MAIL, IT'LL BE HORRIBLE.

1624
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,900
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
SHE HAS A MINOR HEART CONDITION.

1625
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,930
I THINK THIS COULD
POSSIBLY BE NOT GOOD FOR THAT.

1626
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:58,700
SO I AM COUNTING ON
YOUR GOOD GRACES AND BRILLIANCE

1627
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,800
TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO SAVE MY ASS.

1628
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,530
TRUTHFULLY, JULES,
IT'S PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE

1629
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:03,900
TO HACK INTO A SERVER.

1630
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,630
TECHIE #2: AND YOU DON'T
KNOW HER PASSWORD?

1631
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:07,030
NO IDEA.

1632
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:09,200
JULES, I THINK THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING WE CAN DO.

1633
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,760
WHAT? TELL ME.
I'M DYING.

1634
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,300
ME AND THE BOYS TAKE OFF,

1635
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,160
WE BREAK INTO YOUR MOM'S HOUSE,
AND WE STEAL HER COMPUTER.

1636
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,700
BREAK INTO HER HOUSE
AND STEAL THE COMPUTER?

1637
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,160
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1638
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,200
THAT'S FREAKING GENIUS.

1639
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,460
YOU WILL REACH YOUR DESTINATION

1640
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,430
IN 300 YARDS.

1641
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:31,360
LITTLE DOES GPS LADY KNOW
SHE IS AN ACCOMPLICE TO A CRIME.

1642
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,500
THE WOMAN HAS A HEART CONDITION.
THINK OF IT AS A GOOD DEED.

1643
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,130
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D BE A BAD
INFLUENCE ON ME, WHITTAKER.

1644
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,700
OH, RELAX, FELLAS. THIS IS
GONNA BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

1645
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,030
THE KEY
IS UNDER A FLOWERPOT.

1646
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,060
WE GO IN, WE DELETE,
WE DISAPPEAR.

1647
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,360
SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN ALARM,
RIGHT?

1648
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,560
NOPE.
SHE DOES NOT.

1649
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,730
WHAT IF THERE'S, LIKE,
A PASSWORD ON THE E-MAIL? HMM?

1650
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,230
THEN
WE TAKE THE COMPUTER.

1651
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:51,030
JULES SAID SHE'D BUY HER
A NEW ONE, SO IT'S A WIN-WIN.

1652
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:54,260
YOU WILL REACH YOUR DESTINATION
IN 100 YARDS.

1653
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,760
THIS IS LIKE
AN "OCEANS" MOVIE.

1654
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,760
BEN'S THE OLD GUY
WITH THE BIG GLASSES.

1655
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,230
HIS NAME IS ELLIOTT GOULD.

1656
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,430
YEAH, AND, JASON, YOU'RE CLOONEY.
THANK YOU.

1657
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:03,560
AND I'LL BE MATT DAMON
'CAUSE I'M KIND OF AN OUTSIDER.

1658
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,860
YEAH, DEFINITELY.
WHO AM I?

1659
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,530
UH, YOU ARE
BEN AFFLECK'S BROTHER.

1660
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,060
WELL,
WHY AREN'T I BRAD PITT?

1661
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,060
I THINK THAT'S KIND OF
SELF-EXPLANATORY.

1662
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,060
OKAY, CLOONEY.
THANK YOU.

1663
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,460
YOU'RE BEHIND THE WHEEL.

1664
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,730
PARK ON THE STREET.

1665
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,460
KEEP THE ENGINE RUNNING,
YOUR EYES OPEN.

1666
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:29,160
DAMON, AFFLECK'S BROTHER,
YOU'RE WITH ME.

1667
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,730
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS.

1668
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,930
REMEMBER,
THE KEY'S UNDER THE FLOWERPOT.

1669
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,730
OH, NO.

1670
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,130
OH, GREAT PLAN SO FAR.
OH, MY GOD.

1671
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:58,100
LEWIS, GET BECKY.
IF WE DON'T KNOW THE CODE,

1672
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,800
THIS IS GONNA TURN INTO AN ALARM
IN 60 SECONDS.

1673
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,400
BECKY, PUT JULES ON.

1674
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,160
SHE PUT ME ON HOLD.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT GIRL?

1675
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,830
THIS IS SO NOT GOOD.
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO, BEN?

1676
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:07,000
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED...
STOP EATING!

1677
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,130
UH-HUH!
GO LOOK FOR THE COMPUTER!

1678
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:09,730
RIGHT NOW!
GO! GO! GO!

1679
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:11,160
NO! SEPARATELY!
SEPARATE...

1680
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,830
BEN.
BEN, YOU THERE?

1681
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,960
BECKY, DON'T SCREW AROUND.
PUT JULES ON. IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

1682
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,400
SHE'S IN A MEETING.
INTERRUPT HER.

1683
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,360
BEN, WHAT'S UP?

1684
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,060
JULES,
YOUR MOTHER HAS AN ALARM.

1685
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,700
NO, SHE DOESN'T.
YES, SHE DOES.

1686
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,730
I'M IN HER KITCHEN. IT'S ABOUT
TO GO OFF. WHAT'S HER CODE?

1687
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:25,630
I HAVE NO IDEA.
BEN, LISTEN TO ME.

1688
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:26,900
I KNOW THIS WOMAN.

1689
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,230
THAT IS A FAKE ALARM
THAT SHE BOUGHT

1690
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:29,460
OFF OF SOME INFOMERCIAL
OR SOMETHING, OKAY?

1691
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,000
IT'S NOT REAL.
IT'S NOT CONNECTED.

1692
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,460
IT'S JUST TO
SCARE OFF BURGLARS.

1693
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,200
SHE SAYS IT'S FAKE.
IT'S JUST TO SCARE OFF BURGLARS.

1694
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,030
OH, WELL,
IT'S DOING A GOOD JOB.

1695
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,160
LISTEN, MY PARENTS WOULD NEVER
PAY FOR AN ALARM, OKAY?

1696
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,630
THEY'RE THE CHEAPEST PEOPLE
IN AMERICA.

1697
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,760
OKAY, WELL, IT HASN'T
TURNED INTO AN ALARM YET.

1698
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,960
IT'S STILL BEEPING.
THAT'S 'CAUSE IT'S A FAKE.

1699
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,600
TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.
HAVE YOU FOUND THE COMPUTER?

1700
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,900
IT'S NOT DOWN HERE.

1701
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,500
LEWIS, GO IN THERE.
DAVIS, IN THERE.

1702
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,400
FOUND IT!
GOT IT! WHAT?

1703
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:00,400
WE FOUND TWO. WHICH ONE IS HERS?
THE WHITE ONE OR THE SILVER ONE?

1704
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,130
THE WHITE ONE
OR THE SILVER ONE?

1705
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:03,400
THE WHITE ONE OR THE SILVER ONE?
WHITE ONE OR THE SILVER ONE?

1706
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,860
YOUR MOM'S COMPUTER?
YES.

1707
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,060
IT'S WHITE.
I GOT IT FIXED FOR HER ONCE.

1708
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,630
I AM POSITIVE.
THE WHITE ONE!

1709
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:09,160
WHITE.

1710
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,530
OH, MY GOD.

1711
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:17,100
I KNEW THERE WAS NO SUCH THING
AS A FAKE ALARM!

1712
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,830
WE'RE GONNA GET ARRESTED!
I KNEW IT!

1713
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,160
THAT'S IT! WE'RE DONE!

1714
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,060
OUR FINGERPRINTS
ARE ALL OVER THIS PLACE!

1715
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,430
BEN,
DO YOU SEE THE E-MAIL?

1716
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:25,560
NOT YET.
DOUBLE-TIME IT, DUDE.

1717
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,860
HERE, LET ME.

1718
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,230
FOUND IT!

1719
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:31,260
"WHY IS MY MOTHER
ALWAYS SUCH A RAGING BITCH?"

1720
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,160
SUBJECT...
"SHE'S A TERRORIST."

1721
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,630
YES! DELETE IT!

1722
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:35,730
GONE.

1723
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:37,100
NOW FROM THE TRASH!

1724
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:39,960
GOT IT.

1725
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:42,930
DAVIS, WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?

1726
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:44,030
UNDER THE BED, RIGHT SIDE.

1727
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:45,460
WHICH RIGHT SIDE?

1728
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,600
RIGHT SIDE FACING THE BED!
OH, MY GOD! MY LIFE IS OVER!

1729
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,130
I'M GONNA BE A FELON AND
I HAVE NOT COMMITTED A CRIME!

1730
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:51,400
DAVIS.
DAVIS, PULL IT TOGETHER.

1731
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,100
CAN'T YOU HEAR
HOW FAR AWAY THAT IS?

1732
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,700
WE'VE GOT AT LEAST 30 SECONDS
UNTIL THEY'RE HERE.

1733
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,400
HOW AM I GONNA
EXPLAIN THIS TO MY PARENTS?

1734
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,800
OH, MY GOD.
MY LISP IS BACK!

1735
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,460
20 SECONDS.
OH!

1736
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,200

01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:53,600
I DIDN'T, ACTUALLY.

1764
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,430
I'M SURE MY BLOOD PRESSURE
WAS THROUGH THE ROOF.

1765
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,330
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.
GOOD TIMES!

1766
01:14:58,430 --> 01:14:59,500
GUYS, I CAN'T...

1767
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,460
I LITERALLY CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH FOR WHAT YOU JUST DID.

1768
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,500
IT WAS SO ABOVE AND BEYOND
AND BRAVE AND LOYAL.

1769
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,200
I AM INDEBTED TO YOU
FOREVER.

1770
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,600
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
WELL, YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

1771
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,760
YOU KNOW...

1772
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,560
TAKES A TEAM,
BUT IT'S DONE.

1773
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,400
ALL TAKEN CARE OF.
OKAY.

1774
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,400
I'M GONNA HAVE ANOTHER.
ANYBODY ELSE?

1775
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,730
I WOULD LOVE THAT.
YEAH, LET'S DO THAT.

1776
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,630
YEAH. BUT COULD I JUST GET
A HALF THIS TIME?

1777
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:23,730
I'LL TAKE HIS HALF.

1778
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,230
WE'LL ALL
HAVE DOUBLES.

1779
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:29,300
N-NO, IT'S OKAY. I CAN DRINK.
IT'S A THING ABOUT ME.

1780
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,600
NOW, WHAT ARE YOUR NAMES,
AGAIN?

1781
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,060
I NEVER
WANT TO NOT KNOW YOU.

1782
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,430
I'M JASON.

1783
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,530
I'VE WORKED FOR YOU
FOR LIKE A YEAR.

1784
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:37,430
I'VE DELIVERED THINGS
TO YOUR HOME.

1785
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:38,730
I MET MATT
A BUNCH OF TIMES.

1786
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:40,700
I'VE TIED YOUR DAUGHTER'S SHOE
BEFORE.

1787
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,830
I... I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
I'M JUST TERRIBLE WITH NAMES.

1788
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:44,560
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S JASON.

1789
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,630
YOU'RE NEW, RIGHT?

1790
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:46,930
YEAH.
I'M DAVIS.

1791
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:48,530
I STARTED WORK
THE SAME DAY AS BEN.

1792
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:50,660
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH BESTIES,
AND I'M HIS MENTEE.

1793
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,860
OH.
HE GAVE ME THIS TIE, FOR EXAMPLE.

1794
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,360
IT WAS HIS.
IT'S VINTAGE.

1795
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,230
"VINTAGE."
I LIKE IT.

1796
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,560
I LIKE MEN IN TIES.

1797
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,460
AND, YOU'RE LEWIS.
YES.

1798
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,160
YEAH, I COULD HEAR A LITTLE BIT
OVER THE PHONE.

1799
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,630
YOU WERE VERY COOL
UNDER PRESSURE.

1800
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:05,030
WELL, IT WAS MY FIRST HEIST.
I TRIED TO BE CHILL.

1801
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,130
THANKS FOR NOTICING.

1802
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,930
SALUT.

1803
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,060
MM!
WHOO!

1804
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,660
BOYS, WHAT CAN I SAY...

1805
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:12,700
I'M SORRY.

1806
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,430
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO CALL YOU "BOYS."

1807
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:16,260
NOBODY CALLS MEN
"MEN" ANYMORE.

1808
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,530
HAVE YOU NOTICED?

1809
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:19,130
WOMEN WENT FROM "GIRLS"
TO "WOMEN."

1810
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,600
MEN WENT FROM "MEN"
TO "BOYS"?

1811
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,100
THIS IS A PROBLEM
IN THE BIG PICTURE.

1812
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,300
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YEAH.

1813
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,830
I'M GONNA HAVE ANOTHER.

1814
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,230
ANOTHER?
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

1815
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:30,800
YEP. OKAY,
HERE'S MY THEORY ABOUT THIS.

1816
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,560
WE ALL GREW UP DURING THE
"TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK DAY" THING, RIGHT?

1817
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,930
MM-HMM.

1818
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:38,230
SO WE WERE ALWAYS TOLD WE COULD
BE ANYTHING, DO ANYTHING.

1819
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:41,130
AND I THINK GUYS GOT,
MAYBE NOT LEFT BEHIND,

1820
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,830
BUT NOT QUITE AS NURTURED,
YOU KNOW?

1821
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:46,030
I MEAN, LIKE, WE WERE THE
GENERATION OF "YOU GO, GIRL."

1822
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:47,830
WE HAD OPRAH.

1823
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:51,160
AND I WONDER SOMETIMES
HOW GUYS FIT IN, YOU KNOW?

1824
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,730
THEY STILL SEEM TO BE
TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.

1825
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:54,460
THEY'RE STILL DRESSING
LIKE LITTLE BOYS.

1826
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,100
THEY'RE STILL PLAYING
VIDEO GAMES.

1827
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,900
WELL, THEY'VE GOTTEN GREAT.
SO...

1828
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,760
I LOVE VIDEO GAMES.

1829
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,260
OH, BOY.

1830
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,500
HOW, IN ONE GENERATION,
HAVE MEN GONE FROM

1831
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:07,500
GUYS LIKE JACK NICHOLSON
AND HARRISON FORD TO...

1832
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,860
TAKE BEN, HERE.

1833
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,830
A DYING BREED.
YOU KNOW?

1834
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,230
LOOK AND LEARN, BOYS,

1835
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:18,560
BECAUSE IF YOU ASK ME,
THIS IS WHAT COOL IS.

1836
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,030
OH, THANKS, ACE. YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DRINK ANYMORE, RIGHT?

1837
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:23,160
CALLING ME "ACE"?

1838
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,860
THAT IS JUST SUPER COOL,
RIGHT?

1839
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,200
DEFINITELY.
VERY COOL.

1840
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,000
OKAY.
I AM OFFICIALLY A LITTLE DIZZY.

1841
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,830
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE TIRADE.

1842
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:33,360
I AM GONNA GO.

1843
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:37,630
BUT I AM FOREVER IN YOUR DEBT,
GENTLEMEN.

1844
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:40,200
ANOTHER WORD
WHICH IS NEVER USED ANYMORE.

1845
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,100
LET'S BRING IT BACK,
SHALL WE?

1846
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,660
YES.
BEN, I'LL BE UBERING HOME.

1847
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,160
THANKS AGAIN.
WHOA! WHOA!

1848
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,200
OKAY.

1849
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,630
I'M SO SORRY.

1850
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:52,160
DON'T WORRY.

1851
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,900
I'M FINE NOW.

1852
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,700
OKAY.

1853
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:58,130
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

1854
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,730
OH, I HAVEN'T DONE THAT
SINCE COLLEGE.

1855
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:09,530
THANK YOU.

1856
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:12,230
OH, MAN.

1857
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:15,000
VERY SORRY
YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.

1858
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,230
HUMILIATING.

1859
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:17,460
IT'S ALL GOOD.

1860
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,500
YOU FEELING BETTER?

1861
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,860
YEAH.

1862
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:24,560
YEAH, I FORGOT YOU GOT TO EAT
BEFORE YOU DRINK.

1863
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,830
I'M GOOD NOW.

1864
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:30,300
THANK YOU.

1865
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,000
I'M LEAVING
IN A MINUTE.

1866
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,560
JUST WORKING ON MAKING THIS
THE WORST POSSIBLE DAY FOR YOU.

1867
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,460
NO, NOT AT ALL.
YOU'VE HAD A STRESSFUL DAY.

1868
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:55,830
HOW IS IT THAT YOU ALWAYS
MANAGE TO SAY THE RIGHT THING...

1869
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:59,060
DO THE RIGHT THING,
BE THE RIGHT THING?

1870
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:01,330
IT'S UNCANNY.

1871
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:03,030
YOU...
YOU GET SOME REST.

1872
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,330
I WILL.

1873
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:06,260
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

1874
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,360
OH, AND, UH...

1875
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,930
SAYONARA.

1876
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:18,630
ABSOLUTELY.

1877
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,630
REALLY SO NICE OF YOU
TO DO THIS.

1878
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:35,400
MOST WOMEN WOULD HAVE
JUST RESCHEDULED.

1879
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,260
OH, NOT TO WORRY.
I UNDERSTAND.

1880
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,630
IT WAS UNEXPECTED.

1881
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:42,100
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

1882
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,530
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1883
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,160
HI.
OH. COME ON IN.

1884
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,500
OH, NO, AFTER YOU.
GO AHEAD.

1885
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:01,400
BENJI, YOU BROUGHT A DATE
TO A FUNERAL. UNREAL.

1886
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,560
WE HAD PLANS.
WHO KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

1887
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,700
WELL, HOW DO YOU DO?
I'M MILES.

1888
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,000
HELLO. FIONA.

1889
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,360
I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

1890
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:11,360
OH, THANK YOU, DEAR.

1891
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,130
WOWZA!

1892
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,300
I NEVER WENT TO
A SHIVA BEFORE.

1893
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,760
THE LAUGHTER
WAS WONDERFUL.

1894
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,530
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER EATEN MORE.

1895
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:56,260
I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW I LEFT
WITH A BOX OF COOKIES.

1896
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:57,830
WELL,
YOU WERE A BIG HIT.

1897
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:00,630
GIVING THE WIDOW THAT
BACK MASSAGE... WINNING MOVE.

1898
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,700
OH, YEAH.
SHE NEEDED IT.

1899
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,260
I DEFINITELY THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

1900
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,360
TO TAKE ALL FIRST DATES
TO A FUNERAL.

1901
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,730
YEAH. A REAL ICEBREAKER,
DON'T YOU THINK?

1902
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:11,430
I KNOW YOU'RE KIDDING
BUT, HONESTLY,

1903
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,530
WHO NEEDS THE STRAIN
OF THE DINNER DATE?

1904
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,700
AND THE "WHY AREN'T YOU
MARRIED?" CONVERSATION.

1905
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:19,600
AT OUR AGE IT'S NOT EVEN
POSSIBLE TO CATCH UP.

1906
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,760
WELL, I CAN DO ME
IN 10 SECONDS.

1907
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:25,630
YOU READY?
YEP.

1908
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:28,430
WIDOWER,
ONE SON, TWO GRANDKIDS.

1909
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,560
SPENT MY LIFE
MANUFACTURING PHONEBOOKS,

1910
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,000
WHICH NO LONGER
SERVE A PURPOSE.

1911
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,830
I'M CURRENTLY WORKING
AS AN INTERN,

1912
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,730
HAVING A BALL.

1913
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:40,730
AND THE BEST NEWS IS, I HAVE
A CRUSH ON A GIRL I MET AT WORK.

1914
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:44,030
I'M SORRY
YOU LOST YOUR WIFE.

1915
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:45,060
OKAY.

1916
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,430
DIVORCED.

1917
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:47,930
THREE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS.

1918
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:50,900
ONE GRANDCHILD, A BOY,
ON THE WAY.

1919
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,460
I WAS SICK
A FEW YEARS BACK.

1920
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:53,700
I'M NOT ANYMORE.

1921
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,230
I'M AN IN-HOUSE
E-COMMERCE MASSEUSE.

1922
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:57,730
LOVE MY JOB.

1923
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:02,430
AND I FINALLY MET A MAN I
ACTUALLY WANT TO HANG OUT WITH.

1924
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,860
LUCKY ME.

1925
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,660
MORNING.

1926
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,460
HEY, BUDDY.
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GREAT.

1927
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,130
YEAH, I KNOW.

1928
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:28,560
BUT BELIEVE ME, I LOOK BETTER THAN I FEEL.

1929
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,800
OH, DID YOU SEE THE YANKEES
LAST NIGHT?

1930
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,160
OH, THEY WERE ON FIRE.
OH, MAN.

1931
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,260
GOT TO GET SOMETHING
IN YOUR STOMACH.

1932
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,700
HONEY, HONEY, HONEY.

1933
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,730
JUST CAN YOU PLEASE TAKE
ONE BITE BEFORE SCHOOL?

1934
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:39,130
PLEASE?
JUST ONE BITE?

1935
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:41,760
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE WATERWORKS,
LITTLE ONE?

1936
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,030
I JUST TOLD HER THAT
THE SITTER'S GONNA HAVE TO

1937
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:44,500
TAKE HER TO
MADDIE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY

1938
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,760
BECAUSE
MATT'S FEELING SICK.

1939
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,730
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO
WITH THE SITTER.

1940
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:50,860
BEN?

1941
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:53,200
CAN YOU TAKE ME?

1942
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,930
PLEASE?

1943
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:56,230
OH, HONEY?

1944
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:59,930
I'M SO SORRY, BUT BEN'S
GOT TO GO TO WORK TODAY.

1945
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,360
JULES. COME ON.
IT'LL TAKE AN HOUR.

1946
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,200
LET ME TAKE HER.

1947
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,930
I... I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THIS.

1948
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,830
I'M GOING THE RIGHT WAY.
PLEASE HAVE A LITTLE TRUST.

1949
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:16,000
BUT THE PARK
WHERE THE PARTY IS...

1950
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,700
OH. SORRY, BEN.

1951
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,600
ACTUALLY, THIS IS IT.

1952
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,660
YOU'RE LIKE A CLONE.

1953
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,660
OH, BOY.
THIS LOOKS LIKE A NICE PARTY.

1954
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:27,760
YEAH, IT DOES.

1955
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,330
SO WHICH ONE IS MADDIE?

1956
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:31,530
THE ONE IN THE PINK.

1957
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:34,060
OKAY.
THE ONE IN THE PINK.

1958
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:38,260
YOU CAN GO SIT WITH
THE OTHER MOMS, OKAY?

1959
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,530
OKAY. YOU WANT TO
GIVE MADDIE HER PRESENT?

1960
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:41,560
YEAH.

1961
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,600
OKAY.

1962
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,030
HAVE FUN.

1963
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,100
THE OTHER MOMS.

1964
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,800
FREP... FREPRINO
OR SOMETHING.

1965
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,430
YEAH, I KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THEM.

1966
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:54,200
HI. I'M BEN.

1967
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,260
HI. JANE.
JANE.

1968
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,700
AND EMILY.
HI, EMILY.

1969
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,300
I'M HELPING MATT AND JULES OUT
TODAY.

1970
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,660
OH, ARE YOU MATT'S DAD?

1971
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,900
NO, NO.
I WORK FOR JULES.

1972
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,130
OH.

1973
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:04,700
THAT'S OKAY?

1974
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:08,230
I'VE JUST HEARD SHE'S,
YOU KNOW, KIND OF TOUGH.

1975
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:10,860
TOUGH? JULES? SURE.
SHE'S A TOTAL BADASS.

1976
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:13,660
I GUESS THAT'S HOW SHE BECAME
AN INTERNET SENSATION.

1977
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:15,530
MUST MAKE YOU GUYS PROUD,
HUH?

1978
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:16,930
ONE OF YOUR OWN OUT THERE
EVERY DAY,

1979
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:19,060
CRASHING THE GLASS CEILING
OF THE TECH WORLD.

1980
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:22,360
SO, BRAVO, GOOD FOR HER.
RIGHT?

1981
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,360
Y-YEAH.
NO, FOR SURE.

1982
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,230
WHAT'S UP, KIDDO?

1983
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:28,600
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

1984
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,430
YOU DON'T?
DO YOU WANT TO SIT ON MY LAP?

1985
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:34,800
YOU KNOW, IF SHE'S SICK
SHE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

1986
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,760
TOUGH CROWD, PAIGEY.
YOU WANT TO HIT THE ROAD?

1987
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,330
DOES THAT MEAN "LEAVE"?

1988
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:40,730
'FRAID SO.

1989
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:48,130
I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE
SOMETHING... BLUE!

1990
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:50,260
IS IT THE CAR NEXT TO US?

1991
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,560
NO.

1992
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,300
IS IT, UM,
THAT DOG LEASH?

1993
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,860
NO.

1994
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:57,730
UM, IS IT THE SKY?

1995
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,500
YES! YOU GOT ONE.

1996
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,860
YOUR TURN, BEN.

1997
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:02,430
OKAY.

1998
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,930
OH, I HAVE A GOOD ONE.

1999
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:07,460
I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE
SOMETHING GREEN.

2000
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:09,160
IS IT THAT TREE?

2001
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,430
NOPE.

2002
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:12,360
IS IT THAT FRONT DOOR?

2003
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,760
WELL, IT'S KIND OF GREEN.

2004
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,860
IS IT, BEN?

2005
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,230
IS IT THAT FRONT DOOR?

2006
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,600
YEAH, IT IS, HONEY.
GOOD GIRL.

2007
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,900
THANKS SO MUCH, BEN.

2008
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:12,160
HEY,
COME ON IN THE KITCHEN.

2009
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,960
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
BEFORE YOU HIT THE ROAD?

2010
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,700
WANT A CUP OF COFFEE
OR A BITE TO EAT?

2011
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,230
UH, I'M GOOD, THANKS.

2012
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:20,930
OKAY. HOW WAS SHE?
SHE GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE?

2013
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:22,460
SHE WAS PERFECT.

2014
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:24,630
SHE WASN'T FEELING SO GREAT
AT THE PARTY, SO WE LEFT EARLY,

2015
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:28,730
AND SHE JUST FELL ASLEEP IN THE
CAR, SO I LET HER GET A NAP IN.

2016
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:30,400
SO NICE OF YOU.
THANK YOU.

2017
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:32,930
SORRY.

2018
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:39,060
YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE FEELING MORE WITH IT.

2019
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,900
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
UM...

2020
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,900
I GUESS I JUST NEEDED
A LITTLE DOWNTIME.

2021
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:46,830
YOU KNOW, OR MAYBE I WASN'T EVEN
THAT SICK, I DON'T KNOW.

2022
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:49,500
HEY, BEN, I GOT SOMETHING
I WANTED TO ASK.

2023
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,400
WHAT'S YOUR WHOLE TAKE
ON THE CEO THING?

2024
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,200
I MEAN, YOU'RE MORE
ON THE INSIDE THAN I AM.

2025
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,360
I KNOW JULES IS TRYING TO
DO RIGHT BY EVERYBODY...

2026
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,200
THE INVESTORS.

2027
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,530
THE COMPANY.

2028
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:02,530
YOU.

2029
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:05,660
SHE'S GOT A LOT
ON HER SHOULDERS.

2030
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,900
THE PRESSURE
IS UNBELIEVABLE.

2031
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,900
AM I WRONG
THAT I WANT IT TO HAPPEN?

2032
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,060
I MEAN,
I-I WANT WHAT SHE WANTS,

2033
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,860
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
AROUND HERE.

2034
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:22,830
WE DON'T SEE HER ENOUGH,
AND MAYBE THIS CAN FIX THAT.

2035
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:26,130
A CEO'S GONNA FIX
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, MATT?

2036
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:32,930
WHATEVER SHE DECIDES, I JUST...
I WANT IT TO BE GOOD FOR HER.

2037
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,530
I WANT HER TO BE HAPPY.

2038
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:38,760
OF COURSE.

2039
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,460
SHE DESERVES THAT.

2040
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:46,130
YEAH,
SHE DOES DESERVE IT.

2041
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,530
HI, AMY.

2042
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,460
BENJAMIN,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

2043
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:04,700
FOUND IT ON EBAY.

2044
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,130
YOU WERE RIGHT.
TOTAL CLASSIC.

2045
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:07,160
IT'S AWESOME, KID.

2046
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,660
<i>♪ AND MANY MORE ♪</i>

2047
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:35,400
SO, HOW DID IT GO?

2048
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,560
OH. WELL, YOU HAVE A GREAT KID,
JULES.

2049
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,960
SHE'S ADORABLE.

2050
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,830
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR DOING THAT.

2051
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:44,530
SO, YOU EXCITED ABOUT OUR TRIP
TO SAN FRANCISCO TOMORROW?

2052
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:48,460
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

2053
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,900
OH, I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE
WHAT MATT HAS.

2054
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:52,900
I DON'T.

2055
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:53,900
YOU SURE?

2056
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,160
POSITIVE.

2057
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:58,030
WHAT'S THAT?

2058
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:59,030
BLOOD PRESSURE.

2059
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:01,030
I TAKE IT EVERY DAY.

2060
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:02,260
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY?

2061
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:03,500
YEAH.

2062
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,900
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE ALL FLUSHED.

2063
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,830
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE FIONA,
THE MASSEUSE,

2064
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:09,530
AND JUST CHILL A LITTLE.

2065
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:10,530
WHAT'S UP?

2066
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,260
WHOA, BEN, YOU OKAY?

2067
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,130
YOU SEEM TO BE
SLIGHTLY MALFUNCTIONING.

2068
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:17,530
BECKY.
DOES HE LOOK RIGHT TO YOU?

2069
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:19,200
OKAY. THANK YOU.

2070
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,630
I THINK WE'RE GOOD HERE.

2071
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:21,960
GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

2072
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,730
IT'S ALL GOOD.

2073
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:25,860
IS IT HIS COLORING?

2074
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:26,960
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE ALL NUTS.

2075
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,530
I'M 100%.
LET'S MOVE ON, KIDS.

2076
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:30,360
BIG DAY. LOTS TO DO.

2077
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,630
OKAY. BEN...

2078
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:35,000
IF I AM GIVING YOU TOO MUCH TO
DO OR WORKING YOU TOO HARD,

2079
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,560
PLEASE DO NOT FEEL THAT YOU HAVE
TO GO WITH ME TO SAN FRANCISCO.

2080
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,830
JULES, PEOPLE MY AGE
GET TIRED SOMETIMES.

2081
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:41,300
THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

2082
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,760
YOU'RE TIRED?

2083
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,300
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT
ME ONCE SINCE I CAME OVER HERE?

2084
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:48,260
I'M LOOKING AT YOU.

2085
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:53,360
JULES.
CAMERON'S ON THE PHONE.

2086
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,700
OKAY.

2087
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:57,730
LIKE, IF YOU DON'T FEEL BETTER
TONIGHT OR LATE...

2088
01:30:57,730 --> 01:31:00,330
I'M JUST SAYING
I CAN GO BY MYSELF, OKAY?

2089
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:03,130
I'M A BIG GIRL.
I'LL BE FINE.

2090
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,460
OKAY, SERIOUSLY?

2091
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,030
BEN, WHAT IS IT?

2092
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:18,430
YOU KNOW,
I'M A SENSITIVE MAN.

2093
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:19,860
PEOPLE DON'T
THINK THAT ABOUT ME.

2094
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,260
I DON'T LOOK IT,
BUT I AM.

2095
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:23,500
UNDER ALL THIS MAN STUFF
THAT YOU SO ADMIRE...

2096
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,100
MM-HMM.

2097
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,700
...I'M JUST
A BIG BOWL OF MUSH.

2098
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,630
I KNOW THAT.

2099
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:30,230
OKAY.

2100
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:33,360
THAT'S IT?

2101
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,960
THAT'S WHAT
24 HOURS OF CRAZY COMES TO?

2102
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:38,360
THAT YOU'RE
A SENSITIVE BOWL OF MUSH?

2103
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:41,530
JULES.

2104
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:43,300
BEN.

2105
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,200
JULES,
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

2106
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,200
WE GOT THE DAY OFF.
WE'RE TRAVELING IN FIRST-CLASS.

2107
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,830
LET'S AT LEAST
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

2108
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:53,600
NOW, THAT, I CAN DO.

2109
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:23,300
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
AS WE START OUR DESCENT,

2110
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:25,500
PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR SEAT
BACKS AND TRAY TABLES

2111
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:27,200
ARE IN THEIR FULL,
UPRIGHT POSITIONS

2112
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:29,430
AND ALL CARRYON LUGGAGE
IS STOWED

2113
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:31,460
UNDER THE SEAT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

2114
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:32,660
YOU OKAY?

2115
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:33,700
YEAH.

2116
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,430
JUST THINKING,
TOMORROW I MEET THE GUY

2117
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:37,330
WHO MAY BECOME
MY BOSS, KIND OF.

2118
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:39,330
I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE BOSSES, RIGHT?

2119
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:41,830
MOST PEOPLE HAVE BOSSES.
JULES, IT'S SIMPLE.

2120
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:43,800
IF YOU THINK TOWNSEND
IS GONNA BE GOOD FOR YOU

2121
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,600
AND GOOD FOR THE COMPANY,
THEN DO IT.

2122
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,600
AND IF NOT...

2123
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,530
EXACTLY.

2124
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:49,400
JUST BECAUSE
I CAME ALL WAY HERE...

2125
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,500
RIGHT.
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

2126
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,100
I AGREE.

2127
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,330
DO YOU THINK I CAN TAKE A XANAX

2128
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:58,530
IF I HAD TWO GLASSES OF WINE
AN HOUR AGO?

2129
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:01,130
WELL, I'D WAIT
ANOTHER COUPLE HOURS.

2130
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,900
IT'S A THING I DO BEFORE I LAND.
WE'RE GOOD NOW.

2131
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:22,630
JULES?
YEAH.

2132
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,660
YOU HEAR THAT?
UH-HUH. I HEAR IT. I'M UP.

2133
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,300
ARE YOU OKAY?

2134
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,530
THIS ALARM GOING OFF

2135
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:46,260
IS NOT A GOOD OMEN
ABOUT THIS GUY.

2136
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,460
IT'S A SIGN, BEN.
OH, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT.

2137
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:50,160
SO YOU HAVEN'T
TAKEN A XANAX, YET?

2138
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,460
YOU TOLD ME
TO WAIT A FEW HOURS.

2139
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,400
YOU TRAVEL
WITH YOUR OWN ROBE?

2140
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,100
YEAH.

2141
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:57,460
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

2142
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:59,630
A SMOKE ALARM WENT OFF
IN ONE OF THE ROOMS,

2143
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:01,700
BUT THE PROBLEM
HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.

2144
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:02,660
OUR SINCEREST APOLOGIES.

2145
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:04,760
OH, YEAH.
100 PEOPLE, 2 ELEVATORS.

2146
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,200
DEFINITELY A SIGN.

2147
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,060
WELL,
THANKS FOR ESCORTING ME BACK.

2148
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,400
MM-HMM.

2149
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,030
YOU WANT TO SEE MY ROOM?

2150
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:19,330
OH, NICE.

2151
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:21,860
I MEAN,
DO YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO COME IN?

2152
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:25,560
I HAVE A TEA KETTLE.
WE COULD HAVE TEA OR...

2153
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,360
I'M RIDICULOUSLY NERVOUS
ABOUT TOMORROW.

2154
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:36,160
YOU CAN LIE DOWN.

2155
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,330
I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED.
I'LL SIT IN THE CHAIR.

2156
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,400
HERE YOU GO.

2157
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
SIT IN A CHAIR?

2158
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,160
PLEASE LET ME BE HERE.
I NEED TO LIE DOWN, TOO.

2159
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:04,500
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WORK
OR ANYTHING.

2160
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:08,260
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT?

2161
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,560
MARRIAGE?

2162
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,060
WILL YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

2163
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,730
SHE WAS GREAT, RIGHT?

2164
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:19,530
SHE WAS.

2165
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:22,260
MOLLY WAS HER NAME.

2166
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,930
SHE WAS
A MIDDLE-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL.

2167
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:26,130
BELOVED.

2168
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:27,960
SO PERFECT.

2169
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,430
LONG MARRIAGE?

2170
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:32,100
NOT LONG ENOUGH.

2171
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,460
42 YEARS.

2172
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:36,100
WOW.
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

2173
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,730
YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE SAY
THEY WANT TO GROW OLD TOGETHER?

2174
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:41,760
MM-HMM.
WELL, WE DID THAT.

2175
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,060
WE MET WHEN WE WERE 20.

2176
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:45,700
WELL, I WAS 20.
SHE WAS 19.

2177
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:49,360
AND WHAT WAS AMAZING
IS SHE NEVER REALLY CHANGED.

2178
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,930
THAT'S A HARD THING
TO PULL OFF.

2179
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:54,300
SHE HANDLED LIFE
LIKE IT WAS EASY.

2180
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,160
ALWAYS.

2181
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:59,200
EVEN WHEN IT WASN'T.

2182
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,230
GOD, I ENVY THAT.

2183
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,230
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

2184
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,300
WE HAVE, UM...

2185
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,700
GUMMY BEARS, CHOCOLATE CHIPS,
PRINGLES.

2186
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:14,730
YUP.

2187
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:17,260
I'M JUST GONNA BRING
THE WHOLE THING.

2188
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:20,360
YOU KNOW THOSE ARE
LIKE 15 BUCKS EACH?

2189
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:23,100
BENJAMIN, I RUN A VERY BIG
INTERNET COMPANY.

2190
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:25,760
LET'S GO CRAZY.

2191
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,960
OKAY.

2192
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,460
SO...

2193
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,600
SO...

2194
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,630
YEAH, SO...

2195
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,400
I GOT A WEIRD ONE
FOR YOU.

2196
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,330
MATT IS CHEATING ON ME.

2197
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:49,200
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

2198
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,260
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

2199
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:52,930
WAIT,
YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

2200
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,430
I SAW THEM TOGETHER.

2201
01:36:56,430 --> 01:36:58,460
OH, MY GOD. WHEN?

2202
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:01,260
YESTERDAY.

2203
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:02,700
I'M... I'M SORRY.

2204
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:06,000
I MEAN, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
THAT I SAW THEM, BUT I DID.

2205
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,530
YESTERDAY.

2206
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:10,830
THEN IT IS
STILL GOING ON.

2207
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,330
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?

2208
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:17,160
FOR LIKE 18 DAYS.

2209
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,030
SHE'S A MOM
AT PAIGE'S SCHOOL.

2210
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:21,760
IT'S STILL SO HARD
FOR ME TO GRASP.

2211
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,130
I-I WAS IN THE KITCHEN
MAKING SANDWICHES,

2212
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:25,630
AND HIS PHONE WAS THERE.

2213
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:26,930
HE WAS UPSTAIRS
WITH PAIGE,

2214
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:28,730
AND H-HE WAS GETTING
ALL THESE TEXT MESSAGES.

2215
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:30,860
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I READ THEM.

2216
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:33,630
IT WAS NOT GOOD.

2217
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:35,330
DOES HE KNOW YOU KNOW?

2218
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:36,700
NO.

2219
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:39,400
'CAUSE, HONESTLY, I'M...
I'M NOT READY...

2220
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,800
TO DEAL WITH IT.

2221
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,030
I WOULD LIKE TO BE
A LITTLE LESS DEVASTATED,

2222
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:44,600
IF THAT IS POSSIBLE.

2223
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:47,900
IT'S CLASSIC, THOUGH,
ISN'T IT?

2224
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,160
THE SUCCESSFUL WIFE.

2225
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,100
THE HUSBAND FEELS LIKE
HIS MANHOOD IS THREATENED,

2226
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:52,830
SO HE ACTS OUT.

2227
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:56,530
GIRLFRIEND, I GUESS,
MAKES HIM FEEL MORE LIKE A MAN.

2228
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:59,900
SOMETIMES I'M NOT SURE
I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

2229
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,800
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

2230
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,260
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY TAKING THE
RAP FOR ANY OF THIS, ARE YOU?

2231
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,460
NO! NO, NO.

2232
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:07,930
HE IS THE ONE
DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

2233
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:08,960
I GET THAT.

2234
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,730
MONOGAM-ISH
IS NOT WHAT I'M AFTER.

2235
01:38:10,730 --> 01:38:13,930
I-I'M JUST...
I'M TAKING A SEC...

2236
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:17,130
AND I'M HOPING THAT IT'S JUST
A HORRIBLE LAPSE IN JUDGMENT

2237
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:18,560
AND NOT, LIKE, LOVE.

2238
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,800
AND ONCE
HE MOVES THROUGH THIS,

2239
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,630
WE WILL EVENTUALLY
BE ABLE TO BE OKAY AGAIN.

2240
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:26,500
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

2241
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:30,500
CLEARLY YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S A POSSIBLE THING.

2242
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:33,030
IT... IT WOULD BE UNUSUAL.
I GET THAT.

2243
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:37,160
I GET NOT EVERYBODY
COULD DO THAT, BUT...

2244
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,600
EVERYBODY'S NOT US.

2245
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,500
I HAVE FAITH IN US
BECAUSE...

2246
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,430
I BELIEVE
HE STILL LOVES ME.

2247
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:48,630
AND, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN
GOING THROUGH SO MUCH THAT...

2248
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,800
GOD, I WISH YOUR EXPRESSIONS
WEREN'T SO TRANSPARENT.

2249
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,060
SOME COUPLES DO SURVIVE
THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW.

2250
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:58,130
I GOOGLED IT... "STAYING
TOGETHER AFTER THE AFFAIR."

2251
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:00,660
AND A LOT OF COUPLES,
I MEAN, A LOT STAY TOGETHER.

2252
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,500
AND ANYWAY,
THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID

2253
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,830
ABOUT MOVING THROUGH IT

2254
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:07,360
AND FOCUSING ON US
AND NOT ON THE AFFAIR.

2255
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,100
I DON'T WANT TO
GIVE UP ON HIM.

2256
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:13,100
I KNOW HIM,
AND I KNOW HE KNOWS BETTER.

2257
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:16,260
BUT I AM ONLY HUMAN,

2258
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:19,760
AND I AM SO MAD AT HIM.

2259
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:23,130
YOU KNOW, SO MUCH
HAS HAPPENED TO US SO FAST.

2260
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:25,360
I THINK...

2261
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,800
PART OF ME
WAS EVEN EXPECTING THIS.

2262
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,830
LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE WAS
THE MORE SUCCESSFUL ONE

2263
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:30,800
WHEN WE STARTED OUT.
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

2264
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,000
YEAH, HE WAS.
HE WAS A RISING STAR.

2265
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,130
AND HE BOWED OUT
SO THAT I COULD DO THIS.

2266
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:37,300
HE WAS AMAZING.

2267
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,100
IT WAS ALL HIS IDEA.

2268
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,760
I'M SURE THAT'S WHY
I'M EVEN CONSIDERING

2269
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,030
THIS WHOLE CEO THING,

2270
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:46,430
THINKING MAYBE
SOMEONE ELSE COMING IN

2271
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:48,230
WILL HELP ME
GET MY LIFE BACK ON TRACK.

2272
01:39:48,230 --> 01:39:49,660
OKAY, THAT...
THAT'S IT.

2273
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:51,730
I HATE TO BE THE FEMINIST HERE,
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,

2274
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:54,360
BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE
A HUGE CAREER AND BE WHO YOU ARE

2275
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:57,100
WITHOUT HAVING TO ACCEPT THAT
YOUR HUSBAND IS HAVING AN AFFAIR

2276
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,300
AS SOME KIND OF PAYBACK.

2277
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,460
RIGHT ON.

2278
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:00,460
I MEAN IT.

2279
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:02,500
ME, TOO.

2280
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,830
BUT SUCH IS LIFE,
MY FRIEND.

2281
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:05,200
NO, IT ISN'T.
NOT ALWAYS.

2282
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,160
AND I'M NOT SO SURE
I'D BE SO FORGIVING.

2283
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,660
I AM NOT SO FORGIVING.

2284
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,660
I'M SAYING THAT I COULD
POTENTIALLY BE FORGIVING.

2285
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:13,360
BUT DON'T THINK THAT I
DON'T FEEL WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

2286
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,430
IT'S CRUSHING.

2287
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:17,660
AND WHEN I THINK OF PAIGE...

2288
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:19,660
OH, DON'T.

2289
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:23,730
ALSO, IF WE GOT DIVORCED,
HE'D REMARRY.

2290
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:26,760
MAYBE NOT TO THIS GIRL,
BUT SOMEONE.

2291
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:31,860
AND WE BOTH KNOW I'M NOT EASY.

2292
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:36,700
SO I COULD BE, LIKE, SINGLE
FOREVER, WHICH MEANS THAT...

2293
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:39,060
FORGIVE ME, BUT THIS DOES

2294
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,930
KEEP ME UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

2295
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:43,030
OH.

2296
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:44,430
WHAT?

2297
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:46,960
THAT I DON'T WANT TO
BE BURIED ALONE.

2298
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,400
PAIGE'LL BE
WITH HER HUSBAND,

2299
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,700
AND MATT'LL BE
WITH HIS NEW FAMILY,

2300
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:51,330
AND I WILL BE
BURIED WITH STRANGERS.

2301
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:55,200
I WILL BURIED IN THE STRANGERS
SINGLES SECTION OF THE CEMETERY.

2302
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:58,600
NOT THAT THAT IS A REASON
TO STAY TOGETHER.

2303
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:01,900
BUT IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
A SCARY SIDEBAR.

2304
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,830
LET'S TAKE THAT ONE
OFF YOUR PLATE RIGHT NOW.

2305
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:06,730
YOU CAN BE BURIED WITH
ME AND MOLLY.

2306
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:09,000
I HAPPEN TO HAVE SPACE,
OKAY?

2307
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,530
OH.

2308
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:15,030
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THAT IS...

2309
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:17,530
AND TO THINK
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO HIRE YOU.

2310
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:19,800
THE ONE TIME
I DON'T HAVE MY HANKY.

2311
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:30,260
YOU WANT TO...

2312
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:32,560
WATCH TV?

2313
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,400
JUST FOR
A FEW MINUTES?

2314
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,100
YEAH, SURE, I WOULD.

2315
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,260
EVEN THOUGH
THE PLANNED MERGER HAS...

2316
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:50,260

AIRPORT, PLEASE.

2330
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:46,200
SO, DID WE LIKE HIM?

2331
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:49,130
HE SAID
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

2332
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:52,430
HE SAID THAT NO ONE KNOWS
ABOUT THE FIT LIKE ME.

2333
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:56,200
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO REMOVE
THE SOUL OF THE COMPANY.

2334
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,160
HE SAID THAT
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN.

2335
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:01,200
HE WANTS TO WATCH US
AND SEE WHAT WORKS.

2336
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:05,700
HE WAS POLITE AND RESPECTFUL
AND SUPER SMART.

2337
01:44:06,730 --> 01:44:08,430
AND I HIRED HIM.

2338
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:11,430
SERIOUSLY?

2339
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:12,930
YEAH.

2340
01:44:12,930 --> 01:44:14,430
YOU DID IT
RIGHT IN THE ROOM?

2341
01:44:14,430 --> 01:44:16,960
HE TOLD ME TO SLEEP ON IT
AND THAT WE'D TALK TOMORROW,

2342
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,960
BUT I SAID
THE JOB WAS HIS.

2343
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:22,630
WE SHOOK HANDS ON IT.

2344
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:27,730
YOU KNOW IF, UH, WE DISAGREE,
HE'S THE TIEBREAKER?

2345
01:44:27,730 --> 01:44:30,330
OF COURSE.
HE'S THE CEO.

2346
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:33,300
YEAH. DUH.

2347
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,460
HI.

2348
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,200
HEY!

2349
01:44:57,030 --> 01:44:58,430
YOU SMELL MINTY.

2350
01:44:58,430 --> 01:45:00,360
I JUST MADE MINT TEA.

2351
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:03,130
SO...

2352
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:05,200
YES? NO?

2353
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,860
I DID IT.

2354
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:09,700
I LIKED HIM.
A LOT.

2355
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:12,630
AND, UH...
I OFFERED HIM THE JOB.

2356
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,760
WOW. REALLY?

2357
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,800
YEAH.

2358
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,260
AND YOU'RE OKAY
WITH IT?

2359
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:21,200
YEAH.

2360
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,800
I THINK
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR US.

2361
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:36,430
DO WE HAVE ANY, LIKE, REAL
BOOZE, LIKE VODKA OR SOMETHING?

2362
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:37,900
YEAH.

2363
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,730
DID "GOOD FOR US"
MEAN...

2364
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:52,560
ABOUT THE FIT...

2365
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,830
OR US?

2366
01:45:55,830 --> 01:45:58,060
YOU-AND-ME US.

2367
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:03,700
I FIGURE IF SOMEONE ELSE CAN
CALL SOME OF THE SHOTS AT WORK,

2368
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:05,530
THEN MAYBE...

2369
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:08,330
WE CAN GET BACK TO
WHERE WE WERE 18 MONTHS AGO.

2370
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:11,960
THEY SAY YOU CAN'T PUT THE GENIE
BACK IN THE BOTTLE,

2371
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:14,200
BUT WE CAN TRY, RIGHT?

2372
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:32,300
HEY!

2373
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:33,560
HI.

2374
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:34,830
WAIT, YOU LIVE HERE?

2375
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:37,260
YEAH, BEN'S BEEN PUTTING ME UP
UNTIL I CAN FIND A PLACE.

2376
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,060
OH, SHOULD I LET HIM KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE?

2377
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,600
THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL RING.

2378
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:42,160
OKAY.

2379
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,030
FIONA?!

2380
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:50,600
JULES!

2381
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:51,960
COME ON IN.

2382
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:57,500
I'M JUST ON MY WAY
TO WORK.

2383
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,430
BEN'S RIGHT IN HERE.

2384
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:08,100
I'LL LET YOU TWO TALK.

2385
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,430
SEE YOU.
MM-HMM.

2386
01:48:12,430 --> 01:48:14,260
HI.

2387
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:15,430
WOW.

2388
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:17,600
YOU AND FIONA, HUH?
WHO KNEW.

2389
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,160
SHE'S A GREAT GAL.

2390
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:22,700
SHE SURPRISED ME LAST NIGHT.
SHE BROUGHT OVER DINNER.

2391
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,260
IT'S BRAND-NEW.

2392
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:27,530
CONGRATULATIONS.
I LOVE HER.

2393
01:48:27,530 --> 01:48:29,400
YEAH.

2394
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:37,760
SO, I WAS READY KIND OF EARLY
THIS MORNING, SINCE ABOUT 4:00,

2395
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,230
AND MATT AND PAIGE LEFT AN HOUR
AGO FOR A FIELD TRIP

2396
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:42,300
SO I THOUGHT I'D COME BY.
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

2397
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,860
YEAH.

2398
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,900
I JUST WANTED TO SAY...

2399
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:51,400
I SLEPT ON IT.

2400
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,330
I HAVEN'T CALLED TOWNSEND
YET, BUT...

2401
01:48:54,330 --> 01:48:57,530
I STILL FEEL LIKE
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

2402
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:02,460
WELL...

2403
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:05,560
I DIDN'T
SLEEP SO WELL MYSELF.

2404
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,130
OVER THIS?

2405
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:09,260
YOU REMEMBER THE DAY
I DROVE YOU TO THE WAREHOUSE?

2406
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:11,260
YOU WERE GIVING ME THE
WRONG DIRECTIONS AND ALL THAT?

2407
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:12,630
YEAH. I REMEMBER.

2408
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:15,360
OKAY, WELL, I STOOD IN THE BACK,

2409
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,900
AND I WATCHED YOU
SHOW THE WORKERS

2410
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,130
HOW TO FOLD
AND BOX THE CLOTHES.

2411
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:22,430
I KNEW THEN
THAT WAS WHY ATF WAS A SUCCESS.

2412
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:23,760
NO ONE ELSE
IS EVER GONNA HAVE

2413
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:27,030
THAT KIND OF COMMITMENT
TO YOUR COMPANY, JULES.

2414
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:29,530
TO ME, IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

2415
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:32,060
ABOUT THE FIT NEEDS YOU,
AND IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING,

2416
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:33,500
YOU NEED IT.

2417
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:35,730
SOMEONE MAY COME IN
WITH MORE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU,

2418
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:38,700
BUT THEY'RE NEVER GONNA KNOW
WHAT YOU KNOW.

2419
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,060
I NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS
IN MY LIFE.

2420
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:42,830
NOT MANY PEOPLE DO.

2421
01:49:42,830 --> 01:49:46,800
THIS BIG, BEAUTIFUL,
EXCITING THING THAT YOU CREATED.

2422
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,160
IT'S A DREAM,
ISN'T IT?

2423
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:50,660
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE THAT UP

2424
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:54,130
IN THE HOPES THAT YOUR HUSBAND
WILL STOP HAVING AN AFFAIR?

2425
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:56,700
I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT ADDS UP.

2426
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:59,800
YOU SHOULD FEEL NOTHING BUT
GREAT ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

2427
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:03,460
AND I'D HATE TO SEE YOU LET
ANYONE TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU.

2428
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:10,430
I GUESS
YOU CAME OVER HERE

2429
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:13,400
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO HEAR
SOME OF THIS.

2430
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:15,030
YES.

2431
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:17,730
AND MAYBE ALSO
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY...

2432
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:19,130
INTERN.

2433
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:25,200
WELL, I WAS GONNA SAY
INTERN/BEST FRIEND.

2434
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:28,760
BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO GET
ALL SENTIMENTAL ABOUT IT

2435
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:31,530
EVEN THOUGH WE COULD POTENTIALLY
BE BURIED TOGETHER.

2436
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:33,560
CAN'T GET CLOSER
THAN THAT.

2437
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:38,630
IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THIS
WHEN YOU NEED

2438
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:40,660
SOMEONE YOU KNOW
YOU CAN COUNT ON.

2439
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,130
SO THANK YOU.

2440
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:47,630
I LIKE YOUR HOUSE
SO MUCH BY THE WAY.

2441
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:49,460
THANKS.

2442
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:55,700
SO?

2443
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:12,660
SHALL WE?

2444
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:14,400
OKAY.

2445
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:22,360
WELCOME BACK,
YOU TWO.

2446
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,060
JULES, I HAVE SOMETHING COOL
TO SHOW YOU.

2447
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:25,960
DO YOU REMEMBER TAKING
A CUSTOMER-SERVICE CALL

2448
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:28,760
ABOUT A BRIDE WHOSE BRIDESMAIDS'
DRESSES SHOWED UP IN GRAY,

2449
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,230
AND WE HAD THE VENDOR
REMAKE THEM OVERNIGHT

2450
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:31,430
AND PUT THEM ON A PLANE?

2451
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:33,230
YEAH. YEAH.
RACHEL.

2452
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:34,960
CHECK THIS OUT.

2453
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:38,900
THE SILK CHIFFON
ANTOINETTE DRESS.

2454
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:41,300
THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

2455
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:44,400
OH, AND THESE JUST ARRIVED
FROM MARK TOWNSEND.

2456
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,230
HERE.
THANKS.

2457
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,700
BECKY? GIVE ME TOWNSEND'S
NUMBER, WILL YOU?

2458
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:02,460
OKAY.

2459
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,160
THIS IS JULES.

2460
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:08,260
HEY, ALONZO, WHAT'S UP?

2461
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:09,860
UH-HUH. OKAY.

2462
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:12,500
DO WE NEED THAT MANY?

2463
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:20,130
I HOPE I'M NOT TOO LATE.

2464
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:21,930
DON'T DO THIS FOR ME,
JULES.

2465
01:52:21,930 --> 01:52:23,060
PLEASE?

2466
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:25,030
JUST DO WHAT FEELS RIGHT
FOR YOU.

2467
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:26,960
OH, MY GOD.

2468
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:32,530
I WANT TO CONTINUE RUNNING
MY COMPANY, MATT.

2469
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:33,960
YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT.

2470
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:36,960
THEN DO IT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE UNHAPPY.

2471
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,560
I'M ALREADY UNHAPPY.

2472
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:43,660
I NEED TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

2473
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:45,360
I KNOW.

2474
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,360
JUST TELL ME,
IS IT ALMOST OVER?

2475
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:50,300
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN...

2476
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:52,530
IT'S OVER.

2477
01:52:52,530 --> 01:52:57,560
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW S-SORRY AND ASHAMED I AM.

2478
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:00,500
I THOUGHT
I COULD DO IT.

2479
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:02,800
I THOUGHT I COULD BE
THE GUY THAT I TOLD YOU

2480
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,830
I WAS GOING TO BE.

2481
01:53:04,830 --> 01:53:08,400
AND THEN
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY...

2482
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:12,230
...I THOUGHT
I WAS LOSING YOU.

2483
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:17,830
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY ME.

2484
01:53:17,830 --> 01:53:19,600
I GOT LOST.

2485
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,530
IT'S A CONFUSING WORLD
OUT THERE,

2486
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:24,330
AND WHO I AM
GOT MESSED UP FOR A MINUTE.

2487
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:30,360
AND NOW I'M WATCHING YOU READY
TO GIVE ALL THIS UP FOR ME.

2488
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:33,660
I WILL NOT
LET THAT HAPPEN.

2489
01:53:33,660 --> 01:53:38,800
I LOVE YOU, AND I WILL DO SO
MUCH BETTER IF YOU'LL LET ME.

2490
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:46,300
PLEASE, JULES.

2491
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:49,860
LET ME
MAKE IT RIGHT AGAIN.

2492
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:01,700
YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD BE GOOD?

2493
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:05,400
IF YOU CARRIED
A HANDKERCHIEF.

2494
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:22,300
HAVE YOU
CALLED TOWNSEND YET?

2495
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:25,130
BECAUSE IF I'VE EVER MET ANYONE
WHO DOESN'T NEED A BOSS,

2496
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:26,800
IT WAS YOU.

2497
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:31,800
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CALL HIM
AND TELL HIM I CHANGED MY MIND.

2498
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:35,300
I MEAN,
WE'RE GOOD HERE.

2499
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:37,530
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

2500
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:39,100
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
WE MAKE IT.

2501
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:40,860
GOOD.

2502
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:05,000
BECKY.

2503
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,430
WHERE'S BEN?

2504
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:09,860
I'M NOT SURE. HE SAID
HE WAS TAKING THE DAY OFF.

2505
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,530
FIONA.

2506
01:55:16,530 --> 01:55:18,260
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE BEN IS?

2507
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:52,530
I'M SO SORRY
TO INTERRUPT.

2508
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:54,960
THAT'S OKAY.

2509
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,030
EXTEND YOUR LEFT ARM,
JULES.

2510
01:55:58,030 --> 01:56:00,660
LEFT KNEE UP...

2511
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:04,700
BREATHE AND RELAX
FOR INNER BALANCE.

2512
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:07,460
AM I DOING IT RIGHT?
ALMOST.

2513
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:08,900
GOT SOMETHING GOOD
TO TELL YOU.

2514
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,960
GREAT.
TELL ME WHEN WE'RE DONE.

2515
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,500
BREATHE DEEPLY, JULES.

2516
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,600
THAT'S IT, OUT THERE.

2517
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:27,030
THIS UP.

2518
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:44,530
THE END
