1
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,683
All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?

2
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:29,185
- I’ll say we are!
- Let's sing it now.

3
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,727
Okay, Simon?

4
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:33,231
Okay, Theodore?

5
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:35,150
Okay, Alvin?

6
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:44,825
Christmas, Christmas
time is near

7
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:49,329
Time for toys
and time for cheer

8
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:54,711
We've been good
but we can't last

9
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:59,047
Hurry, Christmas
Hurry fast

10
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:03,469
Want a plane
that loops the loop

11
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:08,641
Me, I want a hula hoop

12
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,728
We can hardly
stand the wait

13
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:16,648
Please, Christmas
Don’t be late

14
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:28,952
You wanna be Atticus Finch. Good.

15
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,871
- I like him.
- Why?

16
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:33,373
- He's honest.
- Yes.

17
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:36,084
- He stands up for the right thing.
- Yes.

18
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,211
- And he's a good father.
- He is.

19
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:40,588
- Did it all by himself.
- Did what all by himself?

20
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,342
- Raised his kids.
- He didn't raise them by himself!.

21
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:46,512
Who was the woman that
came to their house every day?

22
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:49,388
- Calpurnia.
- Calpurnia. He remembered.

23
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:51,599
- And what about Boo?
- What about Boo?

24
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:53,184
Boo Radley is the most interesting
character in To Kill a Mockingbird.

25
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:55,478
Boo Radley is the most interesting
character in To Kill a Mockingbird.

26
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,605
Mom, tell me more about Livia.

27
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,818
She killed everybody so her son Tiberius
could inherit the throne-- like Nixon.

28
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:03,569
It's awfully common.

29
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:08,199
The same stories, the Shakespeare, like
those plays we saw at the Old Globe.

30
00:04:08,324 --> 00:04:11,411
- Anita?
- Hey, Mom.

31
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:15,247
- Want something to eat?
- No, thanks. I already ate.

32
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:19,627
- Are you sure? I made soy cutlets.
- I'm fine. I already ate.

33
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:22,171
Wait.
You've been kissing.

34
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:25,049
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

35
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,844
- I can tell.
- You can't tell.

36
00:04:27,926 --> 00:04:31,721
Not only can I tell,
I know who it is. It's Darryl.

37
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:38,146
What you got
under your coat?

38
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:43,525
It's un fair that we can't
listen to our music.

39
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:46,403
It's because it is about drugs
and promiscuous sex.

40
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,447
Simon and Garfunkel is poetry.

41
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:51,242
It is the poetry
of drugs and promiscuous sex.

42
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:54,035
Honey, they're on pot.

43
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:00,917
First, it was butter.
Then it was sugar and white flour.

44
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:05,255
Bacon, eggs, bologna,
rock 'n' roll, motorcycles.

45
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:09,301
Then, it was celebrating Christmas
on a day in September...

46
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,928
when you knew it
wouldn't be commercialized.

47
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:16,099
- What else are you gonna ban?
- You want to rebel against knowledge.

48
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:18,810
I'm trying to give you the Cliff's Notes
on how to live life in this world.

49
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:21,395
We're like nobody else I know!

50
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,067
I am a college professor.
Why can't I teach my own kids? Use me.

51
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,279
Darryl says that you
use knowledge to keep me down.

52
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:31,281
He says I'm a ''yes'' person...

53
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,866
and you are trying to raise us
in a '' no'' environment.

54
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,828
Well, clearly '' no'' is a word
Darryl doesn't hear much.

55
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:40,206
I can't live here! I hate you!

56
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,709
- Even William hates you.
- I don't hate her.

57
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:44,961
You do hate her.
You don't even know the truth.

58
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,379
- Don't be a drama queen.
- Feck you!

59
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,509
This is a house of lies!

60
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,386
There it is.

61
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:58,433
- Your sister used the ''f'' word.
- I think she said ''feck.''

62
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:02,186
- What's the difference?
- The letter '' u.''

63
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,058
I look so much younger
than everyone else.

64
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:45,228
Enjoy it while you can.

65
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,355
Mom, it's time.

66
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:51,985
- Can this wait till we get home?
- Mom, pull over.

67
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,362
Tell him the truth.
Tell him how old he is.

68
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,830
He knows how old he is.

69
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,875
But other kids make fun of him
because of how young he looks.

70
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,920
Nobody includes him. They call him
''The Narc'' behind his back.

71
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:13,047
- They do?
- What's a narc?

72
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:17,676
- A narcotics officer.
- Well, what's wrong with that?

73
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,096
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

74
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,100
I'm twelve.
She skipped me a grade.

75
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:26,144
Big deal.
I'm a year younger.

76
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:28,313
They're 1 3, I'm 1 2.

77
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:32,566
Aren't I ?

78
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:35,861
I also put you in first grade when
you were five, and I never told you.

79
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:38,822
So I'm how old?

80
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:40,824
You're 11 .

81
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:47,039
- Eleven?
- So you skipped fifth grade.

82
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:50,292
-There's too much padding in the grades.
-Eleven?

83
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:58,425
This explains... so much.

84
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,969
You've robbed him
of an adolescence.

85
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,597
Adolescence is a marketing tool.

86
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:08,185
Honey, I know you were
expecting puberty...

87
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,229
but you’re just gonna have to
shine it on for a little while.

88
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:14,232
Who needs a crowd?

89
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:18,153
Who put such a high premium
on being typical?

90
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:22,616
You're unique. Take those extra years
and do what you want.

91
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,701
Go to Europe for a year.
Take a look around.

92
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:28,413
See what you like.

93
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:30,415
Follow your dream.

94
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,043
You'll still be
the youngest lawyer in the country.

95
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:36,754
Your dad was so proud of you.
He knew you were an accelerated child.

96
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,175
What about me?

97
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,346
You are rebellious
and ungrateful of my love.

98
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:53,104
This song explains why I'm leaving home
to become a stewardess.

99
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:56,441
We can't talk?
We have to listen to rock music?

100
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:58,025
I love you.

101
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,418
Let us be lovers

102
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:19,588
We'll marry our fortunes together

103
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:27,305
I've got some real-estate
here in my bag

104
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:34,770
Hey, man, take good care
of her in San Francisco, man.

105
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,232
And walked off

106
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:43,070
To look for America

107
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:48,325
One day... you'll be cool.

108
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:55,664
Look under your bed.
It'll set you free.

109
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,837
Michigan seems
like a dream to me now

110
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:02,881
Watch the plant.

111
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:08,260
You're 1 8 and I can't stop you.

112
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:13,182
I've gone to look for America

113
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:14,725
Bye.

114
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:20,648
She'll be back.

115
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:25,528
Maybe not soon.

116
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:32,869
I said, be careful
His bow tie

117
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:35,830
Is really a camera

118
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:44,255
Toss me a cigarette

119
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,924
I think there 's one in my raincoat

120
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:54,265
We smoked the last one an hour ago

121
00:10:57,268 --> 00:11:00,728
So I looked at the scenery

122
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:05,150
She read her magazine

123
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:10,948
And the moon rose
over an open field

124
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:36,490
Here 's a theory
for you to disregard...

125
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,700
completely.

126
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:43,288
Music, you know--
true music--

127
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:46,290
not just rock 'n' roll--
it chooses you.

128
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:49,293
It lives in your car, or alone,
listening to your headphones--

129
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:53,966
you know, with the vast, scenic bridges
and angelic choirs in your brain.

130
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:55,467
It's a place apart...

131
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,844
from the vast, benign...

132
00:12:57,969 --> 00:12:59,345
lap of America.

133
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,181
It's quite an honor to have
the world's greatest rock critic...

134
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:04,183
and editor of Creem magazine...

135
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:07,396
back home in San Diego
for a few days.

136
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,898
- Lester Bangs.
- The Doors? Jim Morrison?

137
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:13,192
He's a drunken buffoon
posing as a poet.

138
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,653
- I like the Doors.
- Give me the Guess Who.

139
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:21,117
They got the courage to be drunken
buffoons. Which makes them poetic!

140
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:24,412
Give me some
''White Light/White Heat.''

141
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,205
Iggy Pop!

142
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,666
Amen!

143
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,294
Put this on.
This isn't on your play list either.

144
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,714
- Isn't it a bit early for that?
- Not for me.

145
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:39,593
That was Lester Bangs, this is
Alice Wisdom, and here is Iggy Pop.

146
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:51,063
So you’re the kid who's sent me those
articles from the school newspaper.

147
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:53,148
Yeah. Yeah.

148
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:56,568
I've been doing some stuff for
a local underground paper also.

149
00:13:56,693 --> 00:14:00,782
- What are you, the star of your school?
- They hate me.

150
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:04,367
You'll meet them all again
on their long journey to the middle.

151
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,538
Your writing is damn good. It's just
a shame you missed out on rock 'n' roll.

152
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:10,082
- It's over.
- Over?

153
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:14,169
It's over. You got here
just in time for the death rattle.

154
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:17,380
Last gasp.
Last grope.

155
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:20,300
- At least I'm here for that.
- What do you type on?

156
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,844
Smith-Corona Galaxies Deluxe.

157
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:26,848
- And you like Lou Reed?
- The early stuff.

158
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:29,016
I n his new stuff,
he's trying to be Bowie.

159
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,684
He should just be himself.

160
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:34,189
- You take drugs?
- No.

161
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:35,482
Smart kid.

162
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,236
I used to do speed.

163
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:43,531
You know, and sometimes
a little cough syrup?

164
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:46,742
I'd stay up all night,
just writing and writing.

165
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:49,704
I mean,
like 25 pages of dribble--

166
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,041
You know, about The Faces,
or Coltrane.

167
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,043
You know, just to fucking write.

168
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:00,548
All right.
It's been nice to meet ya.

169
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:03,551
Keep sending me your stuff.

170
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:07,097
I can't stand here all day
talking to my many fans.

171
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,722
I understand.

172
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:13,269
You know, because once you go to L.A.,
you're gonna have friends like crazy.

173
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:16,939
But they're gonna be fake friends.
They're gonna try to corrupt you.

174
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:20,109
You got an honest face,
and they're gonna tell you everything.

175
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:23,528
But you cannot make friends
with the rock stars.

176
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,867
- Is it okay if I--
- If you’re gonna be a true journalist--

177
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:30,244
you know, a rock journalist--

178
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,372
First, you never get paid much.

179
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:37,584
But you will get free records
from the record company.

180
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:43,048
Jesus.

181
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:46,093
Fucking nothing about you
that is controversial, man.

182
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:50,972
God, it's gonna get ugly, man.
They're gonna buy you drinks.

183
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:55,393
You're gonna meet girls, they're gonna
fly you places for free, offer drugs.

184
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:58,397
I know it sounds great,
but these people are not your friends.

185
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:00,815
These are people who want you
to write sanctimonious stories...

186
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,817
about the genius of rock stars.

187
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:05,904
And they will ruin rock 'n' roll,
and strangle...

188
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,865
everything we love
about it, right?

189
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:12,077
And then it just becomes
an industry of cool.

190
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:16,915
I'm telling you, you're coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock 'n' roll.

191
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:21,419
That's why I think you should turn,
go back, and be a lawyer or something.

192
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,176
But I can tell from your face
that you won't.

193
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:32,054
I can give you 35 bucks.

194
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,767
- Give me 1 ,000 words on Black Sabbath.
- An assignment?

195
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,574
You have to make your reputation
on being honest...

196
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,159
and...

197
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,163
you know, unmerciful.

198
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,583
Honest.

199
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,419
Unmerciful.

200
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:06,087
If you get into a jam,
you can call me.

201
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:08,090
I stay up late.

202
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,426
Look at this.

203
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:13,011
Look at this.

204
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:17,307
An entire generation of Cinderellas,
and there's no slipper coming.

205
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,517
You want to get high?
Looking to get high?

206
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:22,186
All I have to do is listen.

207
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:26,358
- That's what Lester Bangs said.
- As long as I know this is a hobby.

208
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:29,778
I'll pick you up right here
at  11:00 sharp.

209
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:32,572
If you get lost,
use the family whistle.

210
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:36,451
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

211
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:47,086
Don't take drugs!

212
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,385
Yes, Mother!

213
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,362
Hi. I'm William Miller.

214
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,492
I'm here from Creem magazine
to interview Black Sabbath.

215
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:22,872
Not on the list.

216
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,676
- Sir, I'm a journalist. Here's a copy--
- You're not on the list.

217
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,763
Go to the top of the ramp
with the other girls.

218
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:45,519
We won't bite.

219
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:47,604
What happens after
I go to the top of the ramp?

220
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,364
Who are you with?

221
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:00,242
Me? I'm with myself.

222
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:02,743
No. Who are you with?
What band?

223
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:07,874
Oh. I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
I'm a journalist.

224
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,544
I'm not-- Not a--
You know.

225
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:12,546
You're not a what?

226
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,802
You're not a what?

227
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,930
I'm not a... groupie.

228
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:27,644
We are not groupies.

229
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:30,229
This is Penny Lane, man.
Show some respect.

230
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:35,109
Groupies sleep with rock stars 'cause
they wanna be near someone famous.

231
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:38,446
We're here because of the music.
We are Band Aids.

232
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:41,949
-She used to run a school for Band Aids.
-We don't have intercourse with them.

233
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:45,745
We inspire the music.
We're here because of the music.

234
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,621
She was the one
who changed everything.

235
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:51,208
She was the one who said,
'' No more sex.

236
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:53,502
No more exploiting
our bodies and our hearts.''

237
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,045
- Right.
-just blowjobs, that's it.

238
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:59,759
- It's all happening!
- It's all happening!

239
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:08,516
Here comes Sabbath!
Ozzy Osbourne!

240
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,270
It's me, Polexia!

241
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,279
I think I saw Sapphire in there.

242
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,366
Does anybody remember laughter?

243
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,743
Sapphire!

244
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,247
- Come on!
- Passes, girls!

245
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,292
Come and get 'em!

246
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,504
- No, not this one.
- Who brought Opie?

247
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:39,339
- He's with us.
- Top of the ramp!

248
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:42,008
- Don't go anywhere, Opie.
- I'll take care of this.

249
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:43,551
If I can.

250
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,820
Come on, boys.
Pick it up, will ya?

251
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:05,406
This is outrageous.
We're an hour and a half late!

252
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:07,409
I'm coming, I'm coming.

253
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:19,336
Freddy! Open up!
It's Stillwater! We're on the show!

254
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,555
I'm a journalist.
I write for Creem magazine.

255
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:33,016
Oh, the Enemy.
A rock writer.

256
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:36,228
Right. I'd like to interview you
or somebody from your band.

257
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:40,189
Look. I'm sorry,
but could you please fuck off?

258
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:42,735
We play for the fans,
not the critics.

259
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:50,284
Russell, Jeff...

260
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,285
Ed, Larry.

261
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:54,120
I really love your band.

262
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,956
I think the song '' Fever Dog''
is a big step forward for you.

263
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:01,211
And you guys producing it yourselves
instead of Glyn Johns...

264
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,380
that was the right thing to do.

265
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:06,549
And Russell, Russell,
the guitar sound...

266
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,135
is incendiary.

267
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:12,847
In-Incendiary.

268
00:22:15,224 --> 00:22:16,769
Way to go.

269
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:25,276
Hey, man.
Don't stop there.

270
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,528
- I'm incendiary too, man.
- I didn't mean ''fuck off. ''

271
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:34,243
- How are you doing?
- He's with us. This way, bro.

272
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:37,330
- He's not on your list!
- Here's a list of people who do belong.

273
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:43,044
Take a straight and stronger course
to the corner of your life

274
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:44,795
Hey, Red Dog!

275
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:47,297
Hey-hey!
Good to see you, man.

276
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:49,759
Some people have a hard time
explaining rock 'n 'roll.

277
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:53,471
I don't think anyone can
really explain rock 'n' roll.

278
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:57,182
Maybe Pete Townshend,
but that's okay.

279
00:22:57,307 --> 00:23:01,311
Rock 'n' roll is a lifestyle
and a way of thinking...

280
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:03,897
and it's not about money
and popularity.

281
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:06,859
Although some money would be nice.

282
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:11,029
But it's a voice that says,
'' Here I am...

283
00:23:11,154 --> 00:23:14,199
and fuck you
if you can't understand me.''

284
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:17,327
And one of these people
is gonna save the world.

285
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:20,372
And that means that rock 'n' roll
can save the world...

286
00:23:20,455 --> 00:23:22,374
all of us together.

287
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:27,129
And the chicks are great. But what
it all comes down to is that thing.

288
00:23:27,254 --> 00:23:31,550
The indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music.

289
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:35,220
What I'm talking about is--
Wait, what am I talking about?

290
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:37,221
- The buzz.
- The buzz.

291
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:39,849
And the chicks, the whatever...

292
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:42,394
is an offs hoot of the buzz.

293
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:44,396
Like you saying
you liked '' Fever Dog.''

294
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:46,565
That is the fucking buzz!

295
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:03,706
Found you a pass.

296
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,127
Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.

297
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:10,796
Oh. Stillwater.

298
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:32,693
Now you're mysterious.

299
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:39,033
How old are you?

300
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,534
- Eighteen.
- Me too.

301
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,079
How old are we really?

302
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:47,957
- Seventeen.
- Me too.

303
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,378
Actually, I'm 1 6.

304
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:55,340
Me too. Isn't it funny?

305
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:58,718
- The truth just sounds different.
- I'm 1 5.

306
00:25:02,972 --> 00:25:04,933
What's your real name?

307
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:08,937
I'll never tell.

308
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:13,691
The Enemy!

309
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:16,903
Russell! Hey.

310
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:19,823
This is Penny Lane.

311
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,283
Penny Lane, Russell Hammond.

312
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:28,206
Pleasure.

313
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:31,626
- '' Penny Lane,'' like the song.
- Have we met?

314
00:25:53,814 --> 00:25:56,191
Can we bring the lights down?

315
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:07,953
Hey, get the Enemy in here.

316
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:11,248
Get on my back
for piggyback ride

317
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,506
- San Diego!
- You ready, baby?

318
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:26,888
Hell, yeah!

319
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:30,558
Good evening, San Diego!

320
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:32,770
Stand right over there.

321
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:35,022
Would you please welcome...

322
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:37,441
from Troy, Michigan--

323
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:41,277
Stillwater!

324
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,644
Fever dog

325
00:27:14,685 --> 00:27:18,522
Scratching at my back door

326
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:22,442
I hear you howl

327
00:27:22,526 --> 00:27:26,030
But I don't listen no more

328
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:30,910
Got a feeling I could taste
every hair of the fever

329
00:27:30,992 --> 00:27:33,620
Dog

330
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:36,957
Come around again
We'll have to feed it then

331
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,462
Another fever dog

332
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,695
You wanna come to L.A.?

333
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:08,822
We'll be at
the Riot House all week.

334
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:11,115
- Riot House?
- Yeah.

335
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,495
The Continental Hyatt House.
It's on Sunset Strip.

336
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,749
Oh, yeah, right.
Sunset Strip.

337
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:22,586
Well, tell your friend...

338
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:26,881
Miss Penny Lane, to call me.

339
00:28:26,964 --> 00:28:29,300
Tell her it ain't
California without her.

340
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:31,761
We want her around,
like last summer.

341
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,722
Say it just like that.

342
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,767
- Got it.
- I'm under '' Harry Houdini.''

343
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,771
I get it.

344
00:28:41,896 --> 00:28:44,774
- Come on, let's blow this burg!
- Hey, Enemy!

345
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,818
Come up to L.A.,
we'll talk some more.

346
00:28:47,902 --> 00:28:51,322
- Bye, Opie.
- See you later, Jeff, Polexia, Dick.

347
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:56,035
Scully, Ed. See ya, Mick, Greg.
Later, guys.

348
00:28:58,371 --> 00:28:59,955
Bye, Opie.

349
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:07,922
Hey, Red Dog.
I'll see ya later, man.

350
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,424
''The Wheel.''
'' Frosty.''

351
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:14,428
Ainsworth,
I'll see you around, man.

352
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,679
- Penny!
- Hey, be cool.

353
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,890
Penny, you just missed Russell.

354
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:21,559
He said he's at the Riot House all week,
and for you to call him.

355
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:25,189
He's under the name
Harry Houdini.

356
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,404
- You know about the Riot House, right?
- I think I've heard of it.

357
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:37,158
He had a message. He said, ''Tell her
it's not California without you.

358
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,536
We want you around,
like last summer.''

359
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:42,872
No! He said, ''Tell her it ain't
California without you, we want--''

360
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:46,501
- I get the gist.
- Right.

361
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,671
So, how well do you guys
know each other?

362
00:29:56,635 --> 00:30:00,765
Call me if you need a rescue.
We live in the same city.

363
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:04,561
I think I live
in a different world.

364
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:08,981
Speaking of the world...

365
00:30:10,524 --> 00:30:12,693
I've made a decision.

366
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:16,865
I'm gonna live in Morocco
for one year.

367
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:23,203
I need a new crowd.

368
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,084
Do you wanna come?

369
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:31,879
Yes.

370
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,800
- You sure?
- Ask me again.

371
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:39,303
Do you wanna come?

372
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:45,893
- You've gotta call me.
- Okay.

373
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,522
It's all happening.

374
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:52,566
It's all happening.
It's all happening.

375
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:59,490
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Great.

376
00:31:17,882 --> 00:31:21,344
And it's not about money
and popularity--

377
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:31,270
And the chicks are great. Right?

378
00:31:32,814 --> 00:31:35,566
Keep the small bills on the outside,
and call me if anyone gets drunk.

379
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,069
I will call you if anyone,
anywhere, gets drunk.

380
00:31:38,194 --> 00:31:40,445
- Good.
- And don't take drugs.

381
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,157
Ha-ha. Very funny.

382
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:45,451
See? Sense of humor.

383
00:31:45,576 --> 00:31:49,205
Funny joke. Have fun at the dance.
I'm glad you're making friends.

384
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,874
- Mom, stay.
- Okay.

385
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,711
Love you. Bye.

386
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:07,764
I always tell the girls,
never take it seriously.

387
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:10,684
If you never take it seriously,
you never get hurt.

388
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,353
If you never get hurt,
you always have fun.

389
00:32:13,437 --> 00:32:15,857
And if you ever get lonely...

390
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:18,358
you just go to the record store...

391
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:20,360
and visit your friends.

392
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:23,697
- So you and Russell--
- No!

393
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,869
Russell has a girlfriend,
and I can't even say her name.

394
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:45,051
It's all happening.
I'm about to use you as protection.

395
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:47,053
- Penny!
- Hi!

396
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:50,682
I saw them on the 7th floor.

397
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:54,686
Mr. Jimmy Page, Mr. john Paul Jones,
Mr. Robert Plant.

398
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,813
Mr. Robert Plant, he signed--

399
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:00,483
signed my T-shirt five minutes ago.

400
00:33:00,566 --> 00:33:03,819
Please don't smear it.
Oh, dear God. Please don't smear it.

401
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:06,113
But five minutes ago,
he touched this pen.

402
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,742
- Vic is a Zeppelin fan.
- I picked that up.

403
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:11,660
He tours with them,
but not, you know, with them.

404
00:33:11,786 --> 00:33:14,413
Yeah, they're on the top floor now.

405
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:16,916
There's no bigger
Zeppelin fan than Vic.

406
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:20,169
Please stay

407
00:33:20,252 --> 00:33:22,838
I wanna hear you play

408
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:26,133
Very dear, very close
friend of Lester Bangs.

409
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:28,594
William Miller.

410
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:34,850
Ladies and gentlemen!

411
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:38,478
At this time, please extinguish
all smoking materials...

412
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:42,608
for the captain has turned on
the '' No Smoking'' sign.

413
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:45,319
Your seats and tray tables
should be locked...

414
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:48,197
and in their full,
upright position.

415
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,626
The hell with it.

416
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,503
- Play on.
- Miss Penny Lane.

417
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:06,297
Oh, thank you, thank you.

418
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:15,974
Act One, in which she pretends
she doesn't care...

419
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,393
about him.

420
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:25,024
Act Two, in which he pretends
he doesn't care about her...

421
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:28,485
but he goes right for her.

422
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:35,952
Act Three, in which
it all plays out...

423
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:38,121
the way she planned it.

424
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:41,124
She'll eat him alive.

425
00:34:41,249 --> 00:34:44,460
- We've got to stop them.
- Stop them?

426
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:50,050
You were her excuse
for coming here.

427
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,013
I need ice.

428
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,854
Hi, man.

429
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,748
- William Miller?
- This is he.

430
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:27,378
This is Ben Fong-Torres. I'm the
music editor at Rolling Stone magazine.

431
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:31,715
We got a couple copies of your stories
from the San Diego Door.

432
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,675
- Is this the same William Miller?
- Yes, it is.

433
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:38,805
''Voice of God, howling dogs,
the spirit of rock 'n' roll.''

434
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:41,057
- This is good stuff, man.
- Thanks.

435
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,685
Uh, thanks. Thanks.

436
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:46,313
I think you should be
writing for us. Any ideas?

437
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,610
- How about Stillwater?
- Stillwater?

438
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:57,407
'' Hard-working band makes good.''
New album out, their third.

439
00:35:57,532 --> 00:35:59,702
Starting to do something. Crazy.

440
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:03,371
Let's do 3, 000 words.
We'll join the band on the road.

441
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,456
Don't let the band
pay for anything.

442
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,583
We can only pay, let me see...

443
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,627
3,000 words--

444
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,588
Seven hundred dollars.

445
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,592
All right, a grand.

446
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:20,638
What's your background?
Are you a journalism major?

447
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,517
- Yeah.
- What college?

448
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,894
Honey,  I need you to do that thing
that fixes the garbage disposal.

449
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:37,905
Well, I certainly know how my lady gets
when you don't snap to it.

450
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,032
- Crazy.
- Crazy.

451
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:42,868
Stillwater?

452
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:46,288
Beware, beware of
Rolling Stone magazine...

453
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,166
because they will
change your story...

454
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,502
they'll rewrite it, you know,
turn it into swill--

455
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,255
But besides that,
what would be wrong with it?

456
00:36:56,757 --> 00:37:00,177
You got starry eyes, my friend.

457
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,846
Look. Do the story.

458
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,309
Who cares, you know?
It'll be good for ya.

459
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:11,772
Remember this: Don't do it
to make friends with people...

460
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:15,150
who are trying to use you...

461
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,028
to further the big business desire...

462
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,614
to glorify worthless rock stars
like Stillwater!

463
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,783
Don’t let those
swill merchants rewrite you.

464
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,538
- ''Swill merchants.'' That's good.
- Yeah, swill merchants.

465
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,084
- What are you listening to?
- Stillwater.

466
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,670
Stillwater?
Fucking kid's doing drugs.

467
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,968
No more than four days...

468
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,178
and I want you to give me
a phone number where you are.

469
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:48,808
I want you to call me twice a day,
and you do not miss more than one test!

470
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,189
And no drugs.

471
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,857
Oh, this is a big mistake.

472
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,591
Come on, Doris, you darling bus.
You can make it.

473
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,605
- This is what I was talking about.
- Russell, excuse me.

474
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:39,941
I was wondering
if maybe we could...

475
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:42,360
find some time to talk
when we get to Phoenix.

476
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:46,114
I want to interview everyone separately,
and I thought we'd start with...

477
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:48,324
-just you and me.
- Absolutely.

478
00:38:49,575 --> 00:38:52,370
- I've got a thing in a couple days.
- We'll figure out something later.

479
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:54,289
just enjoy the ride.

480
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:56,708
- Keep playing that song.
- All right.

481
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,808
Come by in a few minutes.
We'll do that interview.

482
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:15,809
- All right?
- Sure.

483
00:39:19,104 --> 00:39:22,149
- Is this Mr. Miller?
- Yeah.

484
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:24,652
You have a message from Elaine.

485
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:26,196
Your mother.

486
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:28,490
She's a handful.

487
00:39:30,282 --> 00:39:32,868
- I know.
- She freaked me out.

488
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:43,087
I'm worried, man.

489
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:47,716
No, you can trust him.
He's a fan.

490
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:49,760
But it's Rolling Stone.

491
00:39:49,843 --> 00:39:54,390
He looks harmless, but he does represent
the magazine that trashed '' Layla''...

492
00:39:54,473 --> 00:39:57,975
broke up Cream, ripped every album
Led Zeppelin ever made.

493
00:39:58,101 --> 00:40:00,938
Don't forget the rules, man.
This little shit is the Enemy.

494
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:02,439
He writes what he sees.

495
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:05,109
If I don't get into a room,
I'll take a Valium--

496
00:40:06,485 --> 00:40:09,404
Although it would be cool
to be on the cover.

497
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:17,121
You are going to get me
in so much trouble!

498
00:40:17,204 --> 00:40:20,165
Simon Kirke from Bad Company
is by the pool.

499
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:32,593
Housekeeping.

500
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:37,807
Go away!

501
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:41,060
Should I come by later?

502
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:44,897
Yes. I'm in too truthful a mood.

503
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:47,399
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- Go away!

504
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:52,989
- You okay?
- Yeah.

505
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,578
Don't worry. Come to
the radio interview tonight. Okay?

506
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:00,495
Go away!

507
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,581
- Bye.
- You're so rude.

508
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:17,179
- May I speak with William?
- He 's still in the bar with the band.

509
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:21,141
They just got back from the radio
station. Is this Maryann, with the pot?

510
00:41:23,477 --> 00:41:24,979
Hello?

511
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:30,525
No. This is not
Maryann with the pot.

512
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:32,861
This is Elaine.
His mother.

513
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:37,699
Could you give William
a message for me, please?

514
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:41,536
Tell him to call home immediately,
and also tell him...

515
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:45,707
I know what's going on.

516
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:49,836
Okay. But I'm just gonna say this,
and I'm gonna stand by it:

517
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:52,380
You should be
really proud of him.

518
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:55,132
'Cause I know men,
and I'll bet you do too.

519
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:58,302
He respects women,
and he likes women.

520
00:41:58,387 --> 00:42:01,598
And let's just pause
and appreciate a man like that.

521
00:42:01,723 --> 00:42:05,184
You created him out of thin air,
you know, you raised him right.

522
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:07,728
He's having a great time.
He's doing a good job.

523
00:42:07,812 --> 00:42:12,608
And, don't worry, he's still a virgin,
and we 're all looking out for him.

524
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:16,321
You know? That's more than I've
ever even said to my own parents.

525
00:42:17,614 --> 00:42:18,989
So there you go.

526
00:42:21,158 --> 00:42:23,661
This is the maid speaking,
by the way.

527
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:28,499
- Can you please hold it down?
- Sorry, ma'am!

528
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:37,216
Russell! So, what is it
you love about music?

529
00:42:38,342 --> 00:42:41,804
Shut that thing off for a second
and I'll tell you the truth, all right?

530
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:48,476
Look-- Fuck. I trust you,
so I'm just gonna lay this right on ya.

531
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:53,482
just make us look cool.

532
00:42:56,277 --> 00:43:00,321
I will quote you
warmly and accurately.

533
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:03,491
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

534
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:06,828
Some of us...

535
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:09,331
we got girlfriends
back home, you know?

536
00:43:10,415 --> 00:43:12,834
Some of us have wives.

537
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:17,130
And some of the people
that you meet on the road...

538
00:43:17,255 --> 00:43:19,758
are really amazing people.

539
00:43:26,264 --> 00:43:27,724
Like you.

540
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:33,146
But some of the stuff that happens,
it's good for...

541
00:43:33,229 --> 00:43:36,482
a few people to know about,
as opposed to, say...

542
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,111
a million people.

543
00:43:41,195 --> 00:43:44,699
- Understand what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

544
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:48,787
See, I grew up with these guys,
but I can't play all that I can play.

545
00:43:48,912 --> 00:43:52,539
I'm past 'em,
as musicians, but...

546
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:56,627
the more popular we get,
the bigger their houses get...

547
00:43:56,752 --> 00:43:59,589
the more responsibilities,
the pressure, you know--

548
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:02,425
The harder it gets
for me to walk out on them.

549
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:03,884
What am I doing?

550
00:44:05,386 --> 00:44:10,766
I'm telling secrets to the one guy
you don't tell secrets to.

551
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:18,190
We'll do the interview tomorrow.

552
00:44:22,653 --> 00:44:26,532
So tonight, it's--
Well, friends.

553
00:44:26,657 --> 00:44:29,325
- Yeah, right.
- We trust ya.

554
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,412
Stinking Rhodes!

555
00:45:16,372 --> 00:45:19,751
- Hey, what's going on?
- Russell just got electrocuted!

556
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:23,086
Come on! Let's get on the bus!
Let's go!

557
00:45:23,211 --> 00:45:25,923
This is bullshit, man.
Who's taking care of us?

558
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:28,009
- Who's responsible for the gear?
- I'm gonna deal with it.

559
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,219
Get on the bus!
Please, everyone!

560
00:45:30,303 --> 00:45:32,555
- Let's go!
- Hey, cowboy.

561
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:34,681
- You the manager of this band?
- That and more!

562
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:36,683
You didn't finish
your full set, man.

563
00:45:36,808 --> 00:45:40,520
Listen, pal. Your shoddy stage setup
almost killed my guitarist!

564
00:45:40,645 --> 00:45:43,775
You trashed my fucking dressing room,
and you didn't do your 25 minutes.

565
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,069
-Don't fuck with my band's safety, ever!
-Fuck you, man!

566
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:50,489
I'm gonna report you
to every promoter in this country!

567
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:53,158
What is that?
What are you, Bruce Lee?

568
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,452
Lock the gates!

569
00:45:55,577 --> 00:45:57,746
- Motherfucker!
- Let's go through the fucking gate.

570
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:59,749
That's your last
fucking tour, man!

571
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:02,042
Lock the gates
on these fuckheads!

572
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:04,711
- Where's my goddamn cart?
- William?

573
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:11,468
I forgot to tell you.
Your mom called.

574
00:46:11,593 --> 00:46:14,011
She says you gotta
call home immediately.

575
00:46:14,095 --> 00:46:17,891
And she says to tell you,
'' I know what's going on.''

576
00:46:17,974 --> 00:46:20,018
So, I'll see you guys
in Topeka, okay?

577
00:46:25,691 --> 00:46:26,941
Amateurs!

578
00:46:27,024 --> 00:46:30,444
You don't know who you're
dealing with here! Lock the gates!

579
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:39,161
- You wanna buy a gate?
- Yeah!

580
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,500
You just bought a gate!

581
00:47:03,644 --> 00:47:05,021
Russell, wake up.

582
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:09,233
Wake up, man.
High school girls.

583
00:47:10,234 --> 00:47:11,861
Goddamn!

584
00:47:11,944 --> 00:47:14,572
Let it go.
Let it go, buddy.

585
00:47:14,655 --> 00:47:16,866
When do we get in to Topeka, man?

586
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,035
- Larry, you're a sick individual.
- Wake up, man.

587
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,747
Look at all these fucking
tasty-looking high school girls.

588
00:47:23,872 --> 00:47:27,376
We can't stop the bus
every time you see a girl in shorts.

589
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:30,004
Hey, when we go to Morocco...

590
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:32,505
I think we should wear
completely different clothes...

591
00:47:32,589 --> 00:47:34,883
and be completely different people.

592
00:47:34,966 --> 00:47:37,844
What will our names be?

593
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:48,855
What do you think of Russell?

594
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:52,901
I like him.

595
00:47:52,942 --> 00:47:56,488
But that's between us.
Because I am a professional.

596
00:47:56,613 --> 00:48:00,033
- You're coming to Cleveland, right?
- Oh, no.

597
00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:06,122
I have to get my interview
with Russell before Greenville.

598
00:48:06,206 --> 00:48:09,709
- You've got to help me, okay?
- Here's the thing about Russell.

599
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:11,377
He's my last project.

600
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,049
I only do this for a very few people,
and I think we should do it together.

601
00:48:16,174 --> 00:48:19,636
Because all the guys are good,
but he could be great.

602
00:48:22,764 --> 00:48:24,932
What's your real name?

603
00:48:30,604 --> 00:48:32,523
All right, let's go!

604
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:40,698
Oh, it's okay.
I'm easy to forget.

605
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:42,574
just leave me behind!

606
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:45,869
I'm only the fucking lead singer!

607
00:48:48,497 --> 00:48:52,042
- You said you'd tell me where you were.
- Mom, I know!

608
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:54,712
You told me you would
call me twice a day.

609
00:48:54,837 --> 00:48:57,506
- You told me you wouldn't miss tests.
- I'll be home for graduation.

610
00:48:57,631 --> 00:48:59,591
- Mom--
- Where are you?

611
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:02,677
Right now, Topeka.
Then Greenville, then home.

612
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,763
What about graduation?
We had an agreement, William.

613
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:08,142
I'm sorry I didn't
call you yesterday.

614
00:49:08,267 --> 00:49:10,269
I guess I just miss you,
and I don't understand...

615
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:12,312
why I've driven my two kids
so far away from me.

616
00:49:12,396 --> 00:49:15,315
By all practical rules,
don't I get you for another three years?

617
00:49:16,899 --> 00:49:18,943
Was I not fun?

618
00:49:19,068 --> 00:49:20,319
Yes.

619
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:23,197
This is Beth from Denver.

620
00:49:23,281 --> 00:49:26,410
She's one of the legendary,
original Band Aids.

621
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:29,579
- She's clairvoyant!
- I can't read your mind or anything.

622
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:32,665
I mean, I pick up things
here and there.

623
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,542
Estrella says hi.

624
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:38,337
- She says I can stay in your room.
- Sure.

625
00:49:38,421 --> 00:49:40,757
Great. I've got some...

626
00:49:40,882 --> 00:49:43,217
hydroponic pot!

627
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:46,763
Wow, your aura
is really fantastic!

628
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:50,058
- It's this beautiful purple color.
- I love you.

629
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:52,018
I missed the last thing you said.

630
00:49:52,143 --> 00:49:54,771
- Your aura is purple!
- I love you.

631
00:49:54,853 --> 00:49:57,314
- What?
- Purple! It's purple!

632
00:49:57,439 --> 00:50:00,526
- Mom, what?
- Your aura is purple.

633
00:50:00,651 --> 00:50:03,029
I miss you and I love you!

634
00:50:03,154 --> 00:50:05,031
I love you.

635
00:50:21,546 --> 00:50:25,676
All right.
Fire away. I'm ready.

636
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:28,178
Do you have to be depressed
to write a sad song?

637
00:50:28,303 --> 00:50:30,180
Do you have to be in love
to write a love song?

638
00:50:30,305 --> 00:50:33,643
Is the song better
if it really happened to you?

639
00:50:33,768 --> 00:50:38,438
Like '' Love Thing.'' Where did you
write that? Who is it about?

640
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:41,942
When did you get
so professional?

641
00:50:44,027 --> 00:50:47,988
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

642
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:12,806
It's the record company's mistake,
and they will pay.

643
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,601
T-shirts are gone.
Band happy, all right?

644
00:51:19,895 --> 00:51:24,066
Can we just skip the vibe, and go
straight to us laughing about this?

645
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:25,277
Yeah, okay.

646
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,695
Because I can see by your face
you want to get into it.

647
00:51:27,737 --> 00:51:30,906
How can you tell?
I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.

648
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:34,994
Here. Take it.

649
00:51:35,077 --> 00:51:37,496
Let's take a good look at it,
all right?

650
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:41,542
See, you love this T-shirt.

651
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:43,794
It lets you say
everything you want to say.

652
00:51:43,878 --> 00:51:46,797
Well, it speaks
pretty loudly to me.

653
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:48,966
It's a T-shirt.

654
00:51:50,885 --> 00:51:52,802
Do you give a shit
about a T-shirt?

655
00:51:52,927 --> 00:51:56,639
I'm just hungry, man. Let's just go out
and find some barbecue or something.

656
00:51:56,765 --> 00:51:58,726
I'm always gonna
tell you the truth.

657
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:01,687
From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man...

658
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:04,398
and you're the guitarist
with mystique.

659
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:06,524
That's the dynamic we agreed on.

660
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:09,986
Page, Plant, Mick, Keith--

661
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,697
but somehow it's all turning around.

662
00:52:12,822 --> 00:52:15,367
We have got to control
what's happening!

663
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,703
- There's a responsibility here.
- Excuse me.

664
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:22,415
Didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?

665
00:52:22,457 --> 00:52:24,376
I can't say any more
with the writer here.

666
00:52:26,002 --> 00:52:27,879
You can trust him.
Say what you want.

667
00:52:27,962 --> 00:52:29,881
He won't write it.

668
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:34,511
I work as hard, or harder,
than anybody on that stage.

669
00:52:34,594 --> 00:52:38,306
You know what I do?
I connect.

670
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,350
I get people off!.

671
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:43,395
I look for the one guy
who isn't getting off...

672
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,979
and I make him get off.

673
00:52:46,105 --> 00:52:48,023
Actually, that you can print!

674
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:53,947
And yet, why do I always end up
feeling like I'm a joke to you?

675
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:58,701
You want to pretend this isn't
gonna be a very big band? Well, it is!

676
00:52:58,826 --> 00:53:01,203
You call yourself
a leader of this band...

677
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:03,956
but your direction
allowed this T-shirt...

678
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:06,250
when you allowed Dick
to manage us.

679
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:09,504
'Cause he's your friend!

680
00:53:09,629 --> 00:53:12,339
Don't you see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.

681
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:13,882
Is it my turn now?

682
00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:17,094
Because I think we should, for once,
say what we really mean.

683
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:20,973
- This is the part where you quit!
- Right. I'm so predictable.

684
00:53:21,015 --> 00:53:22,725
Deal with it.

685
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:24,727
And let me say
what nobody else wants to say.

686
00:53:24,852 --> 00:53:27,688
- What?
- Your looks have become a problem!

687
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,108
All right, enough!
Break it up.

688
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:33,861
Everyone out of the room
for five minutes.

689
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,158
Hey! Yeah.
William. Sorry.

690
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:45,122
Come on, man. Come on.

691
00:53:45,205 --> 00:53:47,750
Let's go find something real.

692
00:53:54,964 --> 00:53:58,217
From here on out, I'm only interested
in what is real.

693
00:53:58,343 --> 00:54:00,387
Real people, real feelings.
That's it.

694
00:54:00,512 --> 00:54:03,306
That's all I'm interested in
from here on out.

695
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,018
You're real.

696
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,146
- Thanks.
- You know...

697
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:13,649
you know all about us,
and I don't know shit about you.

698
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:17,779
Tell me,
what's your family like?

699
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:22,825
My dad died of a heart attack...

700
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:25,328
and my sister believes
that my mom is so intense...

701
00:54:25,453 --> 00:54:27,914
that she had to escape our family...

702
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:30,582
and they can't seem to find
a way to get through it.

703
00:54:30,707 --> 00:54:32,584
I mean, they don't even speak
to each other anymore.

704
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,839
Plus, she gave me all her albums,
and now she's a stewardess?

705
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:42,511
It's good to talk about.

706
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:47,182
Really good.
But here I am telling secrets...

707
00:54:47,307 --> 00:54:49,393
to the one guy you’re not supposed to
tell your secrets to.

708
00:54:54,857 --> 00:54:56,525
You're Russell from Stillwater.

709
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:01,697
Well, yeah, on my better days,
I am Russell from Stillwater.

710
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,116
Hey, you wanna go to a party with me
at my friend Aaron's house?

711
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:05,867
I mean, I know you're
a big rock star and all...

712
00:55:05,951 --> 00:55:10,163
but do you wanna hang with some good
people looking to have a good time?

713
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:14,876
- We're just real Topeka people, man.
- Smoke some righteous weed.

714
00:55:33,895 --> 00:55:36,605
- Thanks.
- You too.

715
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:39,734
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

716
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:42,404
Fuck!
I grew up with that lamp shade.

717
00:55:42,529 --> 00:55:46,450
I love this kitchen.
I fucking love this kitchen!

718
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,751
That's William over there.
Hey, William!

719
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:03,257
You, Aaron,
are what it's all about.

720
00:56:04,091 --> 00:56:06,052
You're real.

721
00:56:06,093 --> 00:56:10,306
Your room is real.
Your friends are real.

722
00:56:10,431 --> 00:56:13,850
Real, man, real.
You know? Real.

723
00:56:17,772 --> 00:56:20,107
Real. You know?

724
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:28,365
You're more important
than all the silly machinery.

725
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:31,368
Silly machinery.
And you know it!

726
00:56:32,787 --> 00:56:36,332
I n eleven years, it's gonna be 1 984,
man. Think about that!

727
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,709
Wanna see me feed a mouse
to my snake?

728
00:56:39,834 --> 00:56:41,211
Yes.

729
00:56:47,384 --> 00:56:50,805
Russell, we should probably
get back with the others.

730
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,806
- Oh, it's over, daddy.
- Hey...

731
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:57,727
there's acid in the beer
that's in the red cups.

732
00:56:59,312 --> 00:57:01,231
That's wonderful.

733
00:57:02,982 --> 00:57:04,859
Topeka. Check it out.

734
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:09,447
Please, don't give him any more acid.
Thank you.

735
00:57:09,531 --> 00:57:12,409
Dick? Dick, I got him.

736
00:57:12,492 --> 00:57:14,327
He's okay.

737
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:16,663
He is on acid, though.

738
00:57:16,746 --> 00:57:21,709
I can't really tell.
How do you know when it's kicked in?

739
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:24,170
I am a golden god!

740
00:57:26,172 --> 00:57:27,549
Yes, you are!

741
00:57:28,466 --> 00:57:32,803
- I am a golden god!
- Hey, Russell!

742
00:57:32,886 --> 00:57:34,680
Don’t jump.

743
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:38,767
And you can tell
Rolling Stone magazine...

744
00:57:38,851 --> 00:57:42,230
that my last words...

745
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:43,732
were...

746
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,862
I'm on drugs.

747
00:57:59,913 --> 00:58:02,791
I think we should work
on those last words!

748
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:05,169
Okay. Oh, I got it, I got it.
I got it.

749
00:58:05,294 --> 00:58:08,213
I got it. I got it.
This is better.

750
00:58:08,297 --> 00:58:11,424
Last words.

751
00:58:11,507 --> 00:58:14,761
I dig music.

752
00:58:17,514 --> 00:58:19,058
I'm on drugs!

753
00:58:23,395 --> 00:58:25,146
Look, just come on down...

754
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:28,232
and we'll go back to the hotel.

755
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:29,567
Okay.

756
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,152
-j ump.
-j ump!

757
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:40,328
Save Russell!

758
00:58:48,252 --> 00:58:52,507
They've been crying for you
like a bunch of whimpering pussies.

759
00:58:52,632 --> 00:58:54,008
Oh, this band's over.

760
00:58:54,092 --> 00:58:56,928
- This is my family now.
- That's right.

761
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:59,013
- Right, man.
- Definitely.

762
00:58:59,138 --> 00:59:02,725
- He's staying with us.
- Let's just ride on down to Greenville.

763
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:05,936
We'll listen to some great music.
We'll finish the tour...

764
00:59:06,061 --> 00:59:09,565
and then we'll leave
those ungrateful fools behind.

765
00:59:09,649 --> 00:59:11,901
Then we'll come back here,
where you'll live.

766
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:15,029
- That sounds good.
- Yeah, and he can stay in our basement.

767
00:59:15,154 --> 00:59:19,116
-I see what you're doing, and I like it.
-Okay, good.

768
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:21,535
Come on.

769
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,954
- I got it, man, I got it.
- Yeah.

770
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,457
That felt kind a good, though.

771
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:29,459
Excuse me, kids.

772
00:59:29,543 --> 00:59:33,338
Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.

773
00:59:33,463 --> 00:59:35,757
How do we know
you're not a cop? Huh?

774
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:39,177
The Enemy?
Stop fucking looking at me!

775
00:59:39,302 --> 00:59:41,179
Easy. Easy.

776
00:59:41,305 --> 00:59:44,641
Don't worry. He only means half
of what he says.

777
00:59:44,766 --> 00:59:46,476
Which half?

778
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:48,478
Dick, just help me get
my interview.

779
00:59:48,603 --> 00:59:51,064
- I have to go home, Dick.
- Okay, okay.

780
00:59:51,189 --> 00:59:53,233
- I have to go home.
- Look.

781
00:59:53,316 --> 00:59:57,361
You saved the tour, and that's
good enough for now, all right?

782
00:59:57,486 --> 00:59:59,948
- Come on, big fell, let's go.
- I hurt the flower.

783
01:00:00,073 --> 01:00:04,494
Did you, man? You hurt the flower?
That's nice. Come on, on the bus.

784
01:00:10,624 --> 01:00:14,253
Ladies and gentlemen,
the evening is over!

785
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:16,423
We hope you all enjoyed yourselves.

786
01:00:16,548 --> 01:00:21,177
And we'll see you all again in 1 974.
Good evening!

787
01:01:14,145 --> 01:01:17,982
Handing' tickets out for God

788
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,655
Turning 'back

789
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,783
She just laughs

790
01:01:26,908 --> 01:01:31,079
The boulevard is not that bad

791
01:01:33,873 --> 01:01:36,835
Piano man

792
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,337
He makes his stand

793
01:01:40,462 --> 01:01:43,967
In the auditorium

794
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:50,056
Lookin 'on

795
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:53,142
She sings her songs

796
01:01:53,267 --> 01:01:56,812
The words she knows
the tune she hums

797
01:02:07,364 --> 01:02:11,660
Hold me closer, tiny dancer

798
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:14,121
I have to go home.

799
01:02:14,204 --> 01:02:19,084
Count the headlights on the highway

800
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:20,878
You are home.

801
01:02:20,961 --> 01:02:25,174
Lay me down in the sheets of linen

802
01:02:27,217 --> 01:02:29,345
You had a busy day today

803
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:38,062
In Carl Jung's opinion...

804
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:41,565
we all have a sixth sense--
intuition.

805
01:02:41,648 --> 01:02:44,401
When you meet someone and you suddenly
feel like you can't live without them...

806
01:02:44,485 --> 01:02:48,905
this could be the memory of a past love
from the collective unconscious.

807
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:51,909
Or, it could just be hormones.

808
01:02:55,412 --> 01:02:58,373
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.

809
01:02:58,498 --> 01:03:01,918
Rock stars have kidnapped my son.

810
01:03:09,635 --> 01:03:12,220
Lester, Rolling Stone is calling me.

811
01:03:12,345 --> 01:03:15,014
I don't have my key interview.
I don't know what to say.

812
01:03:15,139 --> 01:03:16,683
Days are just going by out here.

813
01:03:16,808 --> 01:03:21,187
You're flipping out. It's good.
All right.

814
01:03:21,312 --> 01:03:24,106
This is how you blow their minds.
He's gonna ask you--

815
01:03:24,232 --> 01:03:26,901
- This is Ben Fong-Torres, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

816
01:03:27,026 --> 01:03:29,112
He 's gonna ask you
how the story’s going...

817
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:30,947
and this is what you do.

818
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:33,408
Tell him...

819
01:03:33,533 --> 01:03:36,452
you know, it's a--
it's a think-piece...

820
01:03:37,202 --> 01:03:39,871
Think-piece.

821
01:03:39,997 --> 01:03:42,208
about a mid-level band...

822
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,585
struggling with
their own limitations...

823
01:03:44,669 --> 01:03:47,880
in the, you know,
harsh face of stardom.

824
01:03:47,964 --> 01:03:50,424
Harsh... face--

825
01:03:50,507 --> 01:03:53,385
Yeah, he'll wet himself.

826
01:03:54,302 --> 01:03:57,264
All dressed up and no place to go.

827
01:03:57,347 --> 01:04:00,560
Greenville--
I'm bored.

828
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,778
I have to pee.

829
01:04:11,862 --> 01:04:13,780
Let's deflower the kid.

830
01:04:22,497 --> 01:04:26,168
Whoa, hold on, hold on.
Wait.

831
01:04:26,293 --> 01:04:30,588
I should leave. I think
things are going backwards for me.

832
01:04:30,713 --> 01:04:33,550
- Backwards?
- Well, I don't know. I just--

833
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:38,013
I thought maybe we could hang out,
you know, do some stuff back home...

834
01:04:38,138 --> 01:04:39,556
like regular stuff...

835
01:04:39,639 --> 01:04:42,183
get to know each other
a little bit better...

836
01:04:42,308 --> 01:04:44,226
and then I'd see you pee.

837
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:47,980
I mean, you know, that's just the way
I usually do it.

838
01:04:48,105 --> 01:04:50,025
You're one of us.

839
01:04:50,108 --> 01:04:51,818
If you come to Cleveland...

840
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:54,613
Bowie's gonna be at Swingo's,
the greatest hotel in America.

841
01:04:54,738 --> 01:04:58,783
I'll introduce you to him
and his security guard, Dennis.

842
01:04:58,908 --> 01:05:00,868
Don't you have any regular friends?

843
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:04,705
Famous people
are just more interesting.

844
01:05:05,998 --> 01:05:08,834
Well, I would be worried
that they were using me.

845
01:05:10,795 --> 01:05:13,172
Boy, if this was the real world...

846
01:05:13,297 --> 01:05:15,341
- Not that anybody's using you!
- and some guy talked to me like that--

847
01:05:15,466 --> 01:05:17,009
No. Hold on.

848
01:05:19,762 --> 01:05:22,389
I'm not famous. But--

849
01:05:22,514 --> 01:05:26,310
- Your time has come!
- Did Russell call?

850
01:05:26,435 --> 01:05:28,562
- Deflower.
- Opie must die.

851
01:05:30,439 --> 01:05:32,274
- Pants him, girls.
- Stop. We're talking.

852
01:05:32,358 --> 01:05:35,110
Opie must die.

853
01:05:37,696 --> 01:05:39,823
- Okay.
- No, come on!

854
01:05:42,368 --> 01:05:48,081
No, come on, please.
Guys, come on, I have to write.

855
01:06:09,185 --> 01:06:10,520
Baby, yes.

856
01:06:13,439 --> 01:06:15,900
Come on, Penny, join us.

857
01:06:34,836 --> 01:06:38,048
Take a vacation from yourself.
Leave this up to professionals.

858
01:06:38,131 --> 01:06:39,631
Don't worry, William.

859
01:06:39,715 --> 01:06:44,553
I've seen the future,
and this all works out reasonably well.

860
01:06:44,678 --> 01:06:46,805
Reasonably?

861
01:06:52,686 --> 01:06:54,396
Hello?

862
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,276
Hello. This is Ben Fong-Torres
calling from Rolling Stone.

863
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,321
Hi, Ben Fong-Torres
from Rolling Stone.

864
01:07:02,446 --> 01:07:04,490
Hello, hello.

865
01:07:04,615 --> 01:07:07,743
- You have such a sexy voice.
- Hello, Ben.

866
01:07:07,868 --> 01:07:12,790
William Miller, this is your editor
from Rolling Stone. How's the story?

867
01:07:12,915 --> 01:07:15,501
I'm getting good stuff out here.

868
01:07:15,626 --> 01:07:18,753
- Yeah, it sounds like it.
- Man, I need some--

869
01:07:23,633 --> 01:07:27,221
Now listen.
Get it together, man.

870
01:07:27,346 --> 01:07:30,182
We're both professionals here, okay?
I don't need to tell you this.

871
01:07:30,265 --> 01:07:33,601
You're not out there to join the party.
We already have one Hunter Thompson.

872
01:07:33,726 --> 01:07:36,604
You're out there to interview
and report. You got me?

873
01:07:36,688 --> 01:07:39,524
Now, this isn't Creem magazine.
This is Rolling Stone.

874
01:07:39,649 --> 01:07:42,987
We need this story in four days.
Now I wanna know how it's shaping up.

875
01:07:47,824 --> 01:07:50,493
It's a think-piece
about a mid-level band...

876
01:07:50,576 --> 01:07:54,038
struggling with their own limitations
in the harsh face of stardom.

877
01:07:55,123 --> 01:07:56,290
That's great.

878
01:07:58,793 --> 01:08:01,212
I like what we're saying.

879
01:08:01,337 --> 01:08:03,297
Let me try and get you
a thousand more words.

880
01:08:03,423 --> 01:08:06,134
Now, it's in consideration
for the cover...

881
01:08:06,217 --> 01:08:09,303
but don't tell the band.

882
01:08:09,429 --> 01:08:13,515
The cover of Rolling Stone magazine.
Crazy.

883
01:08:13,598 --> 01:08:15,852
Crazy.

884
01:08:15,935 --> 01:08:17,395
Some coffee.

885
01:08:17,478 --> 01:08:21,649
Me too.
Greenville is so boring.

886
01:08:21,733 --> 01:08:24,860
You know, any other city
in the world...

887
01:08:24,943 --> 01:08:26,403
and you'd still be a virgin.

888
01:08:26,528 --> 01:08:30,574
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- What?

889
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:34,037
I've never written anything more
than a few pages in my whole life.

890
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,747
Don't worry, baby, you will.

891
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:39,750
I gotta find Russell.
I gotta find Russell.

892
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,251
Oh, will you take the laundry?

893
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:44,087
Take the laundry?

894
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:48,258
What am I to you?
Huh? Tell me.

895
01:08:48,383 --> 01:08:53,055
Tell me right now.
What am I to you?

896
01:08:56,141 --> 01:08:58,518
Excuse me, sir,
would you mind signing for this?

897
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:00,520
Good morning.

898
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:16,827
Please go the fuck away!

899
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:13,800
Hey, how you doing?

900
01:10:13,925 --> 01:10:15,343
Hi.

901
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:19,432
Oh, my God!

902
01:10:19,557 --> 01:10:22,392
Hi, welcome to Swingo's Celebrity Inn.
You must be Stillwater.

903
01:10:22,475 --> 01:10:23,977
It's Bowie!

904
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:52,964
Hi, Mom. I'm in Cleveland.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

905
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:55,467
I'm gonna fly back Monday morning.

906
01:10:57,635 --> 01:10:59,804
No, no, no,
I'll only miss one test.

907
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:01,472
I'll be back for graduation.

908
01:11:01,555 --> 01:11:03,849
Tell her you’re a slave to the groove.
You can’t help it.

909
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:13,443
Hey, Mom, it's Russell Hammond.
I play guitar in Stillwater.

910
01:11:13,567 --> 01:11:15,694
Hey, how does it feel
to be the mother of the greatest...

911
01:11:15,778 --> 01:11:18,155
rock journalist we've met?

912
01:11:20,532 --> 01:11:21,742
Hello?

913
01:11:24,954 --> 01:11:27,581
Look, you got a great kid here.
There's nothing to worry about.

914
01:11:27,706 --> 01:11:31,502
We're taking good care of him.
You should come to the show sometime.

915
01:11:31,627 --> 01:11:33,879
- Hey, listen to me, mister.
-join the circus.

916
01:11:34,004 --> 01:11:37,174
Your charm doesn't work on me.
I'm onto you.

917
01:11:37,299 --> 01:11:39,176
Oh, of course you like him.

918
01:11:39,301 --> 01:11:42,096
Well, yeah.

919
01:11:42,221 --> 01:11:43,764
He worships you people.

920
01:11:43,889 --> 01:11:46,266
And that's fine by you
as long as he helps make you rich.

921
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:50,521
- Rich? I don't think so. We sit--
- Listen to me.

922
01:11:50,646 --> 01:11:53,856
He 's a smart, good-hearted
15-year-old kid...

923
01:11:53,982 --> 01:11:55,400
with infinite potential.

924
01:11:57,026 --> 01:11:59,571
This is not some apron-wearing mother
you're speaking to.

925
01:11:59,697 --> 01:12:02,866
I know about your Valhalla decadence,
and I shouldn't have let him go.

926
01:12:02,992 --> 01:12:05,743
He's not ready for your world
of compromised values...

927
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:08,371
and diminished brain cells
that you throw away like confetti.

928
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:09,706
Am I speaking to you clearly?

929
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:12,291
- Yes, ma'am.
- If you break his spirit...

930
01:12:12,417 --> 01:12:14,127
harm him in any way...

931
01:12:14,252 --> 01:12:16,463
keep him from his chosen profession,
which is law...

932
01:12:16,547 --> 01:12:18,215
something you may not value,
but I do...

933
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,134
you will meet the voice
at the other end of this telephone.

934
01:12:21,259 --> 01:12:24,929
And it will not be pretty.
Do we understand each other?

935
01:12:25,013 --> 01:12:27,974
- Uh, yes, ma'am.
- I didn't ask for this role...

936
01:12:28,057 --> 01:12:29,976
but I'll play it.

937
01:12:31,352 --> 01:12:33,896
Now go do your best.

938
01:12:34,022 --> 01:12:36,899
'' Be bold and mighty forces
will come to your aid.''

939
01:12:37,025 --> 01:12:38,901
Goethe said that.

940
01:12:40,695 --> 01:12:44,157
It's not too late for you to become
a person of substance, Russell.

941
01:12:44,282 --> 01:12:46,700
Please get my son home safely.

942
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:50,663
You know, I'm glad we spoke.

943
01:12:56,461 --> 01:12:59,796
Song and pong
it sounds like lots of fun

944
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:04,301
Won't you get on my back
for piggyback ride

945
01:13:04,426 --> 01:13:09,807
Get on my back
for piggyback ride

946
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:13,518
- All right, boys.
- All right.

947
01:13:17,272 --> 01:13:19,691
Your mom kind of freaked me out.

948
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,278
She means well.

949
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:31,161
From Troy, Michigan...

950
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:34,998
would you please welcome
to Cleveland...

951
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:39,543
Stillwater!

952
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:47,386
Father, Father

953
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:54,642
Tell me the story
tell me what to do

954
01:14:02,025 --> 01:14:05,736
Doctor, Doctor

955
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:13,661
Is there a cure
for the young man's broken blues

956
01:14:15,706 --> 01:14:19,166
And he said

957
01:14:21,919 --> 01:14:25,339
Everybody knows

958
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:47,736
Yeah, you had to be there

959
01:14:52,408 --> 01:14:53,909
Girl, you had to be there

960
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:05,545
Did you see that chick's shirt
in front of Russell?

961
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:07,923
When you play a great show
like tonight--

962
01:15:08,007 --> 01:15:09,924
Okay, I need everyone's attention,
please.

963
01:15:10,008 --> 01:15:12,969
Girls, I need five minutes
with the band alone.

964
01:15:13,094 --> 01:15:18,099
Right.
Well, it seems the rumors are true.

965
01:15:18,224 --> 01:15:21,061
The record company has sent
a big-time manager here...

966
01:15:21,186 --> 01:15:23,103
to try and talk you
into replacing me.

967
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:26,483
His name is Dennis Hope.
I know you've all heard of him.

968
01:15:26,608 --> 01:15:28,902
He's got all the big bands,
and he's outside right now...

969
01:15:29,027 --> 01:15:30,987
and he wants five minutes with you.

970
01:15:31,071 --> 01:15:33,823
And, well, I think
we've gotta do this.

971
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,618
- Well, send him in.
- Yeah, bring him in.

972
01:15:37,743 --> 01:15:41,121
- We'll send him out on a rail!
- All right.

973
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:44,459
We'll finish the interview in Maryland.
You can fly home from Maryland, okay?

974
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,549
Hey, we've already got a manager.
He's been with us from the beginning.

975
01:15:52,675 --> 01:15:55,010
Respectfully.
We all have our roots.

976
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:57,346
I believe in bands
holding on to their roots.

977
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:58,974
Those roots need to be augmented.

978
01:15:59,099 --> 01:16:02,851
Your manager here
needs a manager.

979
01:16:02,935 --> 01:16:06,230
Example-- if you hadn't have run out
on your contract in Phoenix...

980
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,941
we could have sued
over Russell's hand.

981
01:16:09,066 --> 01:16:12,778
But you left, negating the contract,
forfeiting the deposit.

982
01:16:12,903 --> 01:16:16,490
You effectively traveled a long way
to pay that promoter to electrocute you.

983
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,994
Okay, your damages have put you
way in the hole for this tour.

984
01:16:20,119 --> 01:16:21,704
Right now, you owe the record company
more than you've got.

985
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:25,124
But your record's selling.
There's money to be made.

986
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:28,584
So I brought a plane in. We could add
more shows to make up the difference.

987
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:32,422
- Respectfully.
- We travel by bus.

988
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,216
Doris is the soul of this band.

989
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,970
That bus has been our home since
we were the Jeff Bebe band. No way.

990
01:16:38,095 --> 01:16:41,389
Hey, man, I'd travel on a pogo stick
if I thought we could make more money.

991
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,057
You could play more dates
with a plane.

992
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:47,103
Well, it's not about money. It's about
playing music and turning people on.

993
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,522
Clearly. Respectfully.

994
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,567
Why should we pay you for something
we can do ourselves?

995
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,067
Do you know how to keep
from getting charged...

996
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:56,863
for the ice below the floorboards
at Chicago Stadium?

997
01:16:56,988 --> 01:16:58,698
Do you know how to do
a headlining tour?

998
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,660
Do you know how to get a record
not pressed, but played?

999
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:06,747
You gotta take what you can,
when you can, while you can...

1000
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:08,249
and you gotta do it now.

1001
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:11,044
That's what the big boys do.

1002
01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:12,712
Because if you think Mick Jagger'll
still be out there...

1003
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:17,592
trying to be a rock star at age 50,
you're sadly, sadly mistaken.

1004
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:21,303
I didn't invent the rainy day, man.
I just own the best umbrella.

1005
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:26,351
I'm telling you, you're coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock and roll.

1006
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:28,895
The war is over.
They won...

1007
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,897
and they will ruin rock and roll...

1008
01:17:31,022 --> 01:17:34,399
and strangle everything
we love about it.

1009
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:20,070
Put 'em up.
All right, money down.

1010
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:23,240
One guy says, '' I'll draw a picture
and you guess what it is, all right?''

1011
01:18:25,074 --> 01:18:27,243
- Can I help you?
- Is Russell Hammond here?

1012
01:18:27,326 --> 01:18:29,078
Hey, the Enemy!
Come on in, son.

1013
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,794
Welcome to the road manager
poker party.

1014
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:40,423
This game's been going on for two years.
Come on, find a spot.

1015
01:18:40,506 --> 01:18:42,466
- This is Mick. He's with The Who.
- How you doing?

1016
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:45,803
This is Raymond. He's with the Eagles.
This is Reg. He's with Humble Pie.

1017
01:18:45,886 --> 01:18:47,263
- I think you know Red Dog.
- Hey, brother!

1018
01:18:48,472 --> 01:18:50,599
We've been developing this system
of poker over the years...

1019
01:18:50,725 --> 01:18:52,935
- so you can play it in any condition.
- Any.

1020
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:55,021
- All right, I'm in.
- All right, all right.

1021
01:18:55,104 --> 01:18:58,316
Side proposition to the winner.

1022
01:18:58,441 --> 01:19:00,484
For 50 bucks and a case of Heineken...

1023
01:19:00,609 --> 01:19:02,528
I'll throw into the pot
three lovely ladies...

1024
01:19:02,653 --> 01:19:05,488
including Miss Penny Lane
and the famous Band Aids...

1025
01:19:05,572 --> 01:19:10,494
who have to leave the tour
before New York.

1026
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:13,372
- Is that okay with you?
- Russ is getting soft on us.

1027
01:19:14,623 --> 01:19:18,418
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

1028
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:20,879
- It's a deal.
- Show 'em.

1029
01:19:22,339 --> 01:19:25,259
Three lovely ladies
in the custody of Humble Pie.

1030
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:29,888
- Be good to 'em, Rich.
- We owe you $50 and a case of Heineken.

1031
01:19:30,013 --> 01:19:31,097
All right.

1032
01:19:31,222 --> 01:19:34,476
-joint?
-You know how I know this is good stuff?

1033
01:19:34,559 --> 01:19:36,227
- How's that?
- This is from Crosby.

1034
01:19:36,353 --> 01:19:38,772
- Is that the Crosby weed?
- Yeah, this is from Crosby.

1035
01:19:38,855 --> 01:19:41,776
- Oh, I'm in.
- I'm in.

1036
01:19:43,985 --> 01:19:45,820
Give me this.
Give me a light. I want fire.

1037
01:19:45,945 --> 01:19:49,574
Look, nobody's feelings
are getting hurt here.

1038
01:19:49,658 --> 01:19:51,576
She already knows that Leslie's coming
to New York tomorrow.

1039
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,828
Everybody understands.

1040
01:19:53,953 --> 01:19:56,997
This is the circus.
Everybody's trying not to go home.

1041
01:19:57,122 --> 01:20:00,251
- Nobody's saying good-bye.
- Would you like some?

1042
01:20:00,335 --> 01:20:01,878
- I may.
- How many?

1043
01:20:02,003 --> 01:20:06,091
- Quit looking at me like that.
- You think you can fool me.

1044
01:20:06,216 --> 01:20:10,552
I can read you.
I know what you're thinking.

1045
01:20:10,678 --> 01:20:14,723
- What's that?
- You're worried about me and Russell.

1046
01:20:17,936 --> 01:20:20,397
Yeah, I gotta work on that.

1047
01:20:20,522 --> 01:20:23,148
You're so sweet.

1048
01:20:23,232 --> 01:20:26,944
God, if there was more of you in him.

1049
01:20:27,027 --> 01:20:30,948
Don't tell me this stuff.
I wanna like him.

1050
01:20:33,827 --> 01:20:35,244
Did you miss your test or something?

1051
01:20:37,329 --> 01:20:41,583
- You have no idea.
- Look, I know I'm not on the plane.

1052
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,544
I'm not going
on some other band's bus.

1053
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:46,338
I could go with the Stillwater road crew
but that would be pathetic...

1054
01:20:46,463 --> 01:20:48,423
and the girls are all going
with Humble Pie.

1055
01:20:49,757 --> 01:20:52,261
So, if you could find out
from Russell--

1056
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:55,264
Forget it.
I'm flying to New York myself.

1057
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:58,183
I've got a bunch of partial tickets.
I know his ex-wife...

1058
01:20:58,309 --> 01:20:59,727
current-girlfriend thing
is gonna be there.

1059
01:20:59,852 --> 01:21:01,811
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

1060
01:21:01,894 --> 01:21:06,149
What are you saying?
Did Russell say something?

1061
01:21:06,274 --> 01:21:10,237
- I don't know anything.
- Well, I know he wants me there.

1062
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:14,240
Wake up!
Don't go to New York.

1063
01:21:15,158 --> 01:21:18,328
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I thought we were going to Morocco.

1064
01:21:18,453 --> 01:21:21,581
There is no Morocco.
There's never been a Morocco.

1065
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,125
There's not even a Penny Lane.

1066
01:21:24,209 --> 01:21:26,753
I don't even know
your real name.

1067
01:21:26,878 --> 01:21:29,797
If I ever met a man
in the real world...

1068
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:31,424
who looked at me
the way you just looked at me--

1069
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:35,219
When and where
does this '' real world'' occur?

1070
01:21:35,303 --> 01:21:39,432
I mean, I am really confused here.
All these rules...

1071
01:21:39,515 --> 01:21:41,893
and all these sayings and nicknames.

1072
01:21:42,018 --> 01:21:46,439
Honey, you're too sweet
for rock and roll.

1073
01:21:46,522 --> 01:21:50,443
Sweet? Where do you get off?

1074
01:21:50,568 --> 01:21:52,445
Where do you get sweet?

1075
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,197
I am dark and mysterious
and pissed off!.

1076
01:21:55,322 --> 01:21:58,116
And I could be very dangerous
to all of you.

1077
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,328
I am not sweet!

1078
01:22:00,411 --> 01:22:04,624
And you should know that about me.
I am the Enemy!

1079
01:22:04,749 --> 01:22:06,875
Look, you should be happy for me.

1080
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,586
You don't know
what he says to me in private.

1081
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:12,965
Maybe it is love,
as much as it can be for somebody--

1082
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:16,803
Who sold you to Humble Pie
for 50 bucks and a case of beer?

1083
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,554
I was there.

1084
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,474
I was there!

1085
01:22:29,022 --> 01:22:30,941
Oh, God.

1086
01:22:35,278 --> 01:22:37,239
I'm sorry.

1087
01:22:50,419 --> 01:22:52,796
What kind of beer?

1088
01:23:09,521 --> 01:23:11,981
Welcome to New York!
It's okay to be nervous.

1089
01:23:12,023 --> 01:23:15,443
You should be nervous.
All you can do is be yourself...

1090
01:23:15,568 --> 01:23:17,486
and leave a pint of blood
on that stage.

1091
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:22,199
We showed you America.
We did everything but get you laid.

1092
01:23:35,421 --> 01:23:36,797
No. Yeah?

1093
01:23:57,025 --> 01:24:00,821
I'm from the Church of Lenny. We bow
to his will and all it represents.

1094
01:24:02,114 --> 01:24:03,990
She's here.

1095
01:24:09,329 --> 01:24:11,414
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yep.

1096
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:16,586
- How you doing?
-Jeffrey.

1097
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:20,090
Room's fully stocked.
Air-conditioning's on.

1098
01:24:20,215 --> 01:24:22,300
- And, by the way, you look stunning.
- Thanks. See you later.

1099
01:24:22,384 --> 01:24:24,302
All right, bags in five!

1100
01:24:24,427 --> 01:24:27,430
Cars leave for the party at 6:00.

1101
01:24:30,391 --> 01:24:33,520
It's all happening.
They're here.

1102
01:24:33,645 --> 01:24:35,689
Zeppelin are here.
They are here.

1103
01:24:35,772 --> 01:24:37,524
They're at the Plaza.

1104
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:42,528
Sapphire and Miss Penny Lane
are there too.

1105
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:46,657
They're all staying under the name
Emily Rugburn.

1106
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:48,158
Wait. Penny Lane is here?

1107
01:24:48,242 --> 01:24:51,621
- Emily Rugburn.
- William Miller.

1108
01:24:51,746 --> 01:24:54,124
Sir, you have an urgent call.

1109
01:24:57,293 --> 01:25:00,504
Hello? This is Jan Winner,
publisher of Rolling Stone.

1110
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:02,339
Congratulations,
it's gonna be a cover.

1111
01:25:02,423 --> 01:25:05,050
Annie Liebowitz'll shoot 'em
next week in LA...

1112
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:08,263
but we are gonna need you
back in San Francisco tomorrow.

1113
01:25:08,346 --> 01:25:10,973
You can finish the story here.
Okay? Talk to Ben.

1114
01:25:11,098 --> 01:25:14,935
You can tell the band. Alison, our
fact-checker, needs you to transmit...

1115
01:25:15,019 --> 01:25:18,355
whatever you have of the story tonight,
now, along with your notes.

1116
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,983
There's a mojo at the Daily News
they'll let us use.

1117
01:25:21,108 --> 01:25:22,358
A mojo?

1118
01:25:22,483 --> 01:25:27,573
A mojo. It's a very modern machine
that transmits pages over the telephone.

1119
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:30,618
It only takes 1 8 minutes a page.

1120
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:34,371
Guys, I have some good news.

1121
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:37,165
- I don't know why every time I'm here--
- Guys!

1122
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:42,129
What's the problem?
I subscribe to the magazine.

1123
01:25:42,212 --> 01:25:43,422
Fish.

1124
01:25:44,965 --> 01:25:47,925
You're gonna be on the cover
of Rolling Stone.

1125
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:51,512
Are you serious?

1126
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,390
The cover of Rolling Stone.

1127
01:25:56,559 --> 01:25:58,520
And we made it together.

1128
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:02,357
- And they don’t just put somebody...
- Thanks a lot.

1129
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:06,611
with one little hit on the cover
of Rolling Stone...

1130
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:10,281
fucking magazine, man!

1131
01:26:10,406 --> 01:26:14,701
Damn it, I'm gonna enjoy this.
When I first bought the magazine...

1132
01:26:14,826 --> 01:26:17,413
the Beatles were on the cover.

1133
01:26:17,538 --> 01:26:22,126
The Beatles.
Four of them, four of us.

1134
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,296
We take all kind of pills
that give us all kind of thrills

1135
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:30,217
But the thrill we never know
was the thrill that'll get you

1136
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:35,390
When you get your picture
on the cover of Rolling Stone

1137
01:26:36,516 --> 01:26:39,811
Wanna see my picture
on the cover

1138
01:26:39,893 --> 01:26:42,562
Gonna buy five copies
for my mother

1139
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:47,234
Wanna see my smiling face
on the cover

1140
01:26:47,317 --> 01:26:49,111
Of Rolling Stone

1141
01:26:52,323 --> 01:26:53,615
Thank you!

1142
01:26:55,909 --> 01:27:00,330
Who is that girl?
She's creeping me out.

1143
01:27:00,414 --> 01:27:02,165
She's not with any of you guys,
is she?

1144
01:27:02,249 --> 01:27:04,167
- Yeah, she's with me.
- She's with me.

1145
01:27:14,177 --> 01:27:16,972
So, uh, who's gonna shoot it?

1146
01:27:18,432 --> 01:27:20,308
- I love Annie Liebowitz.
- Real impressive.

1147
01:27:20,433 --> 01:27:23,060
I love Annie's stuff.
She does great stuff.

1148
01:29:04,493 --> 01:29:07,372
I am no good at good-byes.

1149
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,792
And you...

1150
01:29:10,917 --> 01:29:15,547
are the last of my...

1151
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:18,048
old-time friends.

1152
01:29:19,216 --> 01:29:21,135
Polexia--

1153
01:29:21,218 --> 01:29:25,140
Polexia went to England
with Deep Purple.

1154
01:29:25,265 --> 01:29:27,475
Can you believe that?

1155
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,853
Even Sapphire went someplace else.

1156
01:29:30,894 --> 01:29:33,314
All she left was her Quaaludes.

1157
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:37,401
Oh, wonderful.

1158
01:29:37,526 --> 01:29:39,570
Where's Beth?

1159
01:29:42,073 --> 01:29:44,116
Where are all my friends?

1160
01:29:44,241 --> 01:29:48,704
Front desk?
Could you please send a doctor?

1161
01:29:48,787 --> 01:29:50,247
Room 537.

1162
01:29:50,372 --> 01:29:53,667
- Penny, get up!
- I'm up.

1163
01:29:53,792 --> 01:29:58,129
My wife's had an accident
with some Quaaludes.

1164
01:29:58,212 --> 01:30:02,426
- So tired.
- You gotta get up, Penny.

1165
01:30:02,509 --> 01:30:05,179
- Penny, get up. Get up.
- I'm so--

1166
01:30:05,304 --> 01:30:08,848
You know that.
You know that I'm retired.

1167
01:30:10,433 --> 01:30:15,689
Always been.
Am retired, and I'm tired.

1168
01:30:15,773 --> 01:30:19,151
-Jane Abbott.
- Missjane Abbott.

1169
01:30:23,696 --> 01:30:24,739
Congratulations!

1170
01:30:25,865 --> 01:30:27,784
Miss Judy Stanton.

1171
01:30:29,869 --> 01:30:31,788
Congratulations.

1172
01:30:33,123 --> 01:30:36,876
- Raymond Sanchez.
- Mr. Raymond Sanchez.

1173
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,379
- As time goes on
- Seats and tray tables.

1174
01:30:39,504 --> 01:30:43,299
Seat back
and tray tables locked.

1175
01:30:43,424 --> 01:30:48,887
And our pending graduate,
William Miller, not present.

1176
01:30:57,438 --> 01:30:59,816
Why doesn't he love me?

1177
01:31:08,449 --> 01:31:11,035
And to the class of1973...

1178
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:16,581
we say, don't forget to remember
yourselves as you are today.'

1179
01:31:16,707 --> 01:31:19,293
full of hope
and the dream...

1180
01:31:19,334 --> 01:31:22,004
- that everything is possible.
- Penny, no!

1181
01:31:22,129 --> 01:31:23,672
- Wake up!
- And remember this...

1182
01:31:23,797 --> 01:31:27,217
- I'm up.
- 20years from now.

1183
01:31:27,342 --> 01:31:31,972
Well, now that I have your attention...

1184
01:31:33,265 --> 01:31:37,936
I know you've heard this before,
and I've never said this to anybody.

1185
01:31:38,061 --> 01:31:41,732
Well, nobody who didn't legally
have to say it back to me.

1186
01:31:42,983 --> 01:31:44,693
But--

1187
01:31:44,776 --> 01:31:47,195
Oh, God, why am I so nervous?

1188
01:31:47,321 --> 01:31:50,115
You'll never remember this.

1189
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,868
I love you...

1190
01:31:52,951 --> 01:31:57,496
and I'm about to boldly go where...

1191
01:31:57,622 --> 01:32:00,751
many men have gone before.

1192
01:32:09,425 --> 01:32:12,136
Okay, what do we got here?
What's her name?

1193
01:32:12,261 --> 01:32:14,555
Okay, sweetheart,
sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

1194
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:17,059
-Good girl. What'd you take, sweetheart?
-I'll get her legs.

1195
01:32:17,184 --> 01:32:19,393
- What did you take?
- Okay.

1196
01:32:19,518 --> 01:32:21,062
-What did you take, sweetheart? Come on.
-I don't know.

1197
01:32:21,187 --> 01:32:24,231
Yes, you do.
Tell us what you took.

1198
01:32:24,357 --> 01:32:26,817
Emily, we're gonna have
to pump your stomach, okay?

1199
01:32:26,943 --> 01:32:31,822
- Emily, wake up.
- We got the tubes. Here we go. Water.

1200
01:32:31,948 --> 01:32:34,492
All right, now, you're gonna
have to swallow this tube.

1201
01:32:34,575 --> 01:32:36,869
All right? Open, open, open.

1202
01:32:36,994 --> 01:32:39,914
- All right, come on.
- Don't bite us. We're trying to help.

1203
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:43,334
- Relax.
- Come on, swallow. Swallow.

1204
01:32:43,417 --> 01:32:44,919
- Come on. I know, I know.
- We're trying to help you.

1205
01:32:45,044 --> 01:32:47,087
Swallow this down.
No, don't bite on it. Don't bite.

1206
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:49,422
Swallow. Emily, come on.
Swallow.

1207
01:32:49,506 --> 01:32:52,301
-just relax. Got it.
- Very good.

1208
01:32:52,426 --> 01:32:53,678
There we go. All done.

1209
01:32:53,761 --> 01:32:56,472
All done. There.

1210
01:32:56,555 --> 01:32:57,848
Now we gotta--
Come on.

1211
01:32:57,932 --> 01:33:00,850
Feed some liquid
into your stomach.

1212
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:29,462
So I guess
what I'm trying to say is...

1213
01:33:29,587 --> 01:33:33,633
I've done twice the things
I said I've done.

1214
01:33:33,758 --> 01:33:35,635
What about your mom?

1215
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:41,348
She always said, '' Marry up.

1216
01:33:41,474 --> 01:33:44,477
Marry someone grand.''

1217
01:33:44,602 --> 01:33:47,480
And that's why she named me '' Lady.''

1218
01:33:49,441 --> 01:33:51,317
She named you '' Lady'' ?

1219
01:33:52,901 --> 01:33:55,696
Lady Goodman.

1220
01:33:56,572 --> 01:33:59,993
Lady Goodman-- that's great.

1221
01:34:00,118 --> 01:34:04,496
Now you know all my secrets.
You've got me.

1222
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:09,335
See you back in the real world.

1223
01:34:10,794 --> 01:34:14,340
Thank you, William Miller.

1224
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:28,687
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
Eastern Airlines nonstop service...

1225
01:34:28,771 --> 01:34:30,521
to San Diego.

1226
01:34:30,647 --> 01:34:32,942
In preparation
for our departure today...

1227
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:37,446
we'd like to ask, please, that
you extinguish all flammable items...

1228
01:34:37,529 --> 01:34:40,282
and do return all seats and tray tables
to their full--

1229
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:44,577
May I have your attention, please?

1230
01:34:47,288 --> 01:34:50,209
...that your seatbelts
are securely fastened.

1231
01:34:50,292 --> 01:34:53,212
And do make note
of the emergency exits.

1232
01:35:50,475 --> 01:35:53,520
Why didn't you come back to the party
last night? Bob Dylan showed up.

1233
01:35:53,604 --> 01:35:56,273
He was sitting at our table for what had
to be an hour or something, right, Dick?

1234
01:35:56,398 --> 01:35:57,858
- Yeah.
-just rapping.

1235
01:35:57,983 --> 01:36:01,486
Bob Dylan at our fucking table.
I was looking for you.

1236
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:04,197
- I was gonna introduce you.
- What happened to you last night?

1237
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:06,950
It's a long story.

1238
01:36:12,122 --> 01:36:15,124
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue

1239
01:36:15,166 --> 01:36:17,794
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Peggy Sue

1240
01:36:17,919 --> 01:36:19,463
Hi, this is Craig, your pilot.

1241
01:36:19,588 --> 01:36:21,548
It appears we've caught the edge
of that electrical storm...

1242
01:36:21,632 --> 01:36:22,966
- we were trying to outrun.
- Oh, my God.

1243
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:25,344
- Electrical storm?
- So buckle up tight now.

1244
01:36:25,427 --> 01:36:26,511
- We 're gonna do our best here.
- Rock and roll.

1245
01:36:26,595 --> 01:36:28,721
We shouldn't be here.

1246
01:36:29,805 --> 01:36:32,391
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa, baby!

1247
01:36:36,188 --> 01:36:37,773
Doris, we miss you!

1248
01:36:40,566 --> 01:36:43,736
All right, listen.
We're gonna try and land in Tupelo.

1249
01:36:43,861 --> 01:36:46,697
- We found a field to land in.
- A field?

1250
01:36:46,822 --> 01:36:48,240
I can't breathe, man.

1251
01:36:48,324 --> 01:36:51,328
It's gonna be kind of a rough set-down,
but we should be fine.

1252
01:36:51,411 --> 01:36:54,413
just hang in there,
and we'll get you out of this.

1253
01:36:58,542 --> 01:37:02,546
Everyone says
it's so glamorous out here.

1254
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:05,049
- He just told us we're gonna die.
- We're gonna die?

1255
01:37:05,174 --> 01:37:06,758
...Thy will be done on Earth--

1256
01:37:06,841 --> 01:37:08,844
I'm trying to maintain,
but the fucking thing won't--

1257
01:37:10,846 --> 01:37:11,931
Oh, my God!

1258
01:37:14,475 --> 01:37:19,063
If something should happen--
Maybe I never said this enough.

1259
01:37:20,188 --> 01:37:21,856
I love all of you.

1260
01:37:28,656 --> 01:37:32,534
I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
A hit and run.

1261
01:37:32,659 --> 01:37:37,580
I hit him and just kept on going.
I don't know if he's alive or dead...

1262
01:37:37,706 --> 01:37:39,207
but I'm sorry.

1263
01:37:39,332 --> 01:37:41,460
Not a day goes by
I don't see his face.

1264
01:37:41,585 --> 01:37:45,006
Oh, my God!

1265
01:37:45,047 --> 01:37:48,925
Look, I love you all too.
You're like a family to me.

1266
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:50,927
Especially since Marna left me.
And listen, fellas...

1267
01:37:51,052 --> 01:37:54,472
I just want you to know, if I took
an extra dollar or two here and there...

1268
01:37:54,556 --> 01:37:56,433
it's because I knew I'd earned it.

1269
01:37:56,516 --> 01:37:59,686
- Yeah. I slept with Marna, Dick.
- I did too.

1270
01:37:59,728 --> 01:38:03,481
I waited until you broke up with her,
but me too.

1271
01:38:05,567 --> 01:38:08,987
I also slept with Leslie,
when you were fighting.

1272
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:12,656
- You slept with Jeff?
- Yeah, but it didn't count.

1273
01:38:12,781 --> 01:38:15,451
It was the summer we decided
to be free of all rules.

1274
01:38:15,576 --> 01:38:17,829
And you say you love me!

1275
01:38:17,912 --> 01:38:20,332
I don't love you, man.
I never did.

1276
01:38:20,457 --> 01:38:22,626
None of us love you.

1277
01:38:22,751 --> 01:38:25,252
You act above us.
You always have.

1278
01:38:25,377 --> 01:38:27,087
Finally, the truth.

1279
01:38:27,212 --> 01:38:30,090
You just held it over us,
like you might leave.

1280
01:38:30,215 --> 01:38:34,095
Like we're lucky to be with you.
And we had to live with it, man.

1281
01:38:34,179 --> 01:38:36,181
I had to live with you.

1282
01:38:36,306 --> 01:38:40,017
And now I might die with you,
and it's not fucking fair.

1283
01:38:40,142 --> 01:38:41,393
Please, enough!

1284
01:38:44,813 --> 01:38:47,399
And I'm still in love with you,
Leslie.

1285
01:38:47,483 --> 01:38:50,320
Oh, I don't wanna hear any more.
Shut up, Jeffrey!

1286
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,364
- It's all happening.
- What the fuck!

1287
01:38:53,447 --> 01:38:57,034
- Whatever happens, Bebe, you're dead.
- Don't be self-righteous, Russell.

1288
01:38:57,159 --> 01:38:58,619
Not now, man.

1289
01:38:58,702 --> 01:39:02,081
You were sleeping with Penny,
that fucking groupie...

1290
01:39:02,164 --> 01:39:03,915
last summer up until yesterday.

1291
01:39:03,998 --> 01:39:05,541
Why don't you tell Leslie that?

1292
01:39:05,667 --> 01:39:07,670
- Shut up!
- I quit!

1293
01:39:07,795 --> 01:39:09,922
- I'm gonna kill you!
- I quit!

1294
01:39:09,964 --> 01:39:11,715
''That groupie'' ?

1295
01:39:11,799 --> 01:39:16,345
She was a Band Aid.
All she did was love your band.

1296
01:39:16,428 --> 01:39:18,388
And you all used her.

1297
01:39:18,471 --> 01:39:21,808
All of you.
You used her and threw her away.

1298
01:39:21,933 --> 01:39:26,063
She almost died last night
while you were with Bob Dylan.

1299
01:39:26,188 --> 01:39:30,024
You guys, you're always talking
about the fans, the fans, the fans.

1300
01:39:30,108 --> 01:39:32,235
She was your biggest fan.

1301
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,362
And you threw her away.

1302
01:39:34,445 --> 01:39:38,950
And if you can't see that,
that's your biggest problem.

1303
01:39:39,075 --> 01:39:41,537
And I love her!
I love her!

1304
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:53,423
Fuck it!

1305
01:39:53,548 --> 01:39:56,550
I'm-- I'm gay!

1306
01:40:10,522 --> 01:40:14,943
Thank God, we're alive!
We're alive! We're gonna make it!

1307
01:40:15,068 --> 01:40:16,946
- We're out of the clear now.
- Sweet relief!.

1308
01:40:17,071 --> 01:40:19,907
Sweet life!
Hallelujah, dear God!

1309
01:40:19,991 --> 01:40:23,160
We made it. We're alive.

1310
01:41:27,932 --> 01:41:29,809
Write what you want.

1311
01:41:58,587 --> 01:41:59,797
You're William Miller?

1312
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:04,510
- Yep.
- Oh, baby.

1313
01:42:06,636 --> 01:42:10,015
Didn't anything happen? I mean,
after $600 in room-service bills?

1314
01:42:10,098 --> 01:42:12,559
Didn't you get anything on tape
with Russell Hammond?

1315
01:42:12,642 --> 01:42:14,894
And where were you in this piece?
What did you wanna write?

1316
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,231
Because this reads
like what they wanted you to write.

1317
01:42:17,315 --> 01:42:19,150
You obviously saw more
than you wrote about.

1318
01:42:19,275 --> 01:42:21,860
- Something must have happened.
- Let's push up Flippo's Who cover.

1319
01:42:21,943 --> 01:42:24,821
Good, 'cause it's gonna take me
three days to get through this research.

1320
01:42:24,946 --> 01:42:28,491
It's all handwritten
on little bits of paper.

1321
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:31,328
- It's a puff-piece.
- They refer to the women as ''chicks.''

1322
01:42:31,453 --> 01:42:33,121
-As a woman, I have a problem with that.
-You want 'em to like you.

1323
01:42:33,246 --> 01:42:34,664
- I know it's a side issue.
- It happens.

1324
01:42:34,789 --> 01:42:38,960
- It's embarrassing.
- Ben! You told me to send what I had.

1325
01:42:39,085 --> 01:42:42,422
It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.

1326
01:43:16,747 --> 01:43:21,043
Oh, man, you made friends with 'em.

1327
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:25,798
See, friendship is the booze
they feed you...

1328
01:43:25,881 --> 01:43:28,801
'cause they want you to get drunk
and feel like you belong.

1329
01:43:28,884 --> 01:43:31,512
Well, it was fun.

1330
01:43:31,637 --> 01:43:34,807
Because they make you feel cool.

1331
01:43:34,932 --> 01:43:39,894
- And, hey, I met you. You are not cool.
- I know.

1332
01:43:39,978 --> 01:43:43,357
Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.

1333
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:46,860
Because we are uncool.

1334
01:43:46,986 --> 01:43:50,531
While women will always be
a problem for guys like us...

1335
01:43:50,614 --> 01:43:55,368
most of the great art in the world
is about that very problem.

1336
01:43:55,451 --> 01:43:58,872
Good-looking people--
they got no spine.

1337
01:43:58,956 --> 01:44:01,959
Their art never lasts.

1338
01:44:02,042 --> 01:44:04,127
They get the girls,
but we're smarter.

1339
01:44:06,254 --> 01:44:10,258
- Yeah, I can really see that now.
- Yeah, 'cause great artist about...

1340
01:44:10,341 --> 01:44:12,343
you know, guilt and longing...

1341
01:44:12,427 --> 01:44:15,346
and, you know,
love disguised as sex...

1342
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:17,432
and sex disguised as love.

1343
01:44:17,557 --> 01:44:21,978
Hey, let's face it.
You got a big head start.

1344
01:44:22,061 --> 01:44:23,313
I'm glad you were home.

1345
01:44:23,438 --> 01:44:26,274
I'm always home.
I'm uncool.

1346
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:29,611
- Me too.
- You're doing great, you know?

1347
01:44:29,694 --> 01:44:32,362
The only true currency
in this bankrupt world...

1348
01:44:32,487 --> 01:44:36,075
is what you share with someone else
when you're uncool.

1349
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:39,412
Listen, my advice to you--

1350
01:44:39,537 --> 01:44:42,832
and I know you think
these guys are your friends--

1351
01:44:42,956 --> 01:44:44,958
if you wanna be a true friend to them...

1352
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:50,131
be honest and unmerciful.

1353
01:44:52,675 --> 01:44:55,637
'' I'm flying high
over Tupelo, Mississippi...

1354
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:58,263
with America's hottest band...

1355
01:44:58,388 --> 01:45:01,350
and we're all about to die.''

1356
01:45:01,475 --> 01:45:05,062
- Dark, lively.
- Yeah, yeah, and it gets better.

1357
01:45:05,187 --> 01:45:08,608
- Did this all really happen?
- I'll call and check the quotes.

1358
01:45:11,693 --> 01:45:14,905
Holy shit! I just got off the phone
with Rolling Stone.

1359
01:45:14,988 --> 01:45:17,157
They called me too.
What's he using?

1360
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:20,619
All-- he's using it all.
This, according to the ''fact-checker.''

1361
01:45:20,744 --> 01:45:22,411
So what?

1362
01:45:22,536 --> 01:45:25,832
''So what'' ?
We come off like amateurs...

1363
01:45:25,958 --> 01:45:30,212
some average band trying to come
to grips with success...

1364
01:45:30,295 --> 01:45:32,798
jealous and fighting
and breaking up.

1365
01:45:32,923 --> 01:45:35,008
We're buffoons.

1366
01:45:35,091 --> 01:45:37,635
'' Rock and roll can save the world'' ?

1367
01:45:37,718 --> 01:45:41,473
''The chicks are great'' ?
I sound like a dick.

1368
01:45:41,556 --> 01:45:44,059
- You are a dick.
- I never said that.

1369
01:45:44,184 --> 01:45:46,436
Maybe we just don't see ourselves
the way we really are.

1370
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,731
Is it that hard
to make us look cool?

1371
01:45:50,856 --> 01:45:54,443
This kid has you on acid screaming,
'' I'm a golden god'' from a fan's rooftop.

1372
01:45:54,568 --> 01:45:59,032
They used him to fuck us. They'll
probably just put you on the cover.

1373
01:45:59,157 --> 01:46:01,367
Wait. I never said,
'' I'm a golden god.''

1374
01:46:03,953 --> 01:46:05,746
Or did I ?

1375
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:09,333
He was never a person.
He was a journalist!

1376
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:11,669
It's phenomenal, William,
to be quite honest with you.

1377
01:46:11,794 --> 01:46:14,921
It's sophisticated, intelligent. We
only had to cut out a couple of grafs.

1378
01:46:15,046 --> 01:46:18,050
Jeff Bebe's mother already sent over a
whole shoe box full of childhood photos.

1379
01:46:18,134 --> 01:46:20,511
- She did?
- But it's really gonna look fantastic.

1380
01:46:20,595 --> 01:46:25,516
The band just denied 90 percent
of the story. It's a fabrication.

1381
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:29,269
You weren't honest.
And worse, you wasted our time.

1382
01:46:31,187 --> 01:46:33,274
Did you talk to Russell Hammond?

1383
01:46:33,357 --> 01:46:35,443
Russell Hammond is the one
who denied it.

1384
01:46:35,568 --> 01:46:37,653
- Now wait a second.
- Denied it.

1385
01:46:39,572 --> 01:46:42,574
We're going with The Who.
Manuscript's in my office.

1386
01:46:42,657 --> 01:46:44,909
He's just some fan.
What do you expect?

1387
01:46:45,035 --> 01:46:47,370
So, anyway, put those two pieces--

1388
01:46:47,495 --> 01:46:50,207
Wait!

1389
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:15,523
You guys, this is my brother.

1390
01:47:15,649 --> 01:47:19,194
- Nice to finally meet you.
- You have a good day.

1391
01:47:20,444 --> 01:47:22,321
You guys, I'll deadhead back later.

1392
01:47:22,446 --> 01:47:24,491
I think I'm needed.

1393
01:47:26,534 --> 01:47:28,703
I'll see you.

1394
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:39,171
You look awful, but it's great.

1395
01:47:39,296 --> 01:47:41,382
You're living your life.

1396
01:47:41,508 --> 01:47:44,552
You're free of Mom.

1397
01:47:47,888 --> 01:47:51,433
Hey, I'll take off work.

1398
01:47:51,475 --> 01:47:56,021
Let's have an adventure together--
you and me-- finally.

1399
01:47:56,105 --> 01:48:01,277
Anywhere you wanna go,
anywhere in the world.

1400
01:48:02,528 --> 01:48:04,613
This is not my idea of a good time.

1401
01:48:05,906 --> 01:48:08,200
-just get me to my bed.
- I'll deal with her.

1402
01:48:52,702 --> 01:48:54,829
I forgive you.

1403
01:48:56,873 --> 01:48:58,833
I didn't apologize.

1404
01:49:25,485 --> 01:49:27,403
I am out of here.

1405
01:49:32,074 --> 01:49:34,952
- Hey, Sapphire.
- Hey, boy.

1406
01:49:36,912 --> 01:49:39,289
- I hate good-byes.
- Me too.

1407
01:49:54,805 --> 01:49:57,056
Is Penny okay?

1408
01:49:58,182 --> 01:50:02,938
The Quaaludes incident?
Well, it wasn't pretty.

1409
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:06,024
She could've died.

1410
01:50:06,149 --> 01:50:10,486
You know, I always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her.

1411
01:50:10,569 --> 01:50:13,281
I guess I was wrong.
One of them ended up saving her life.

1412
01:50:16,243 --> 01:50:20,080
What do you care? I mean,
we all know what you did to him.

1413
01:50:20,163 --> 01:50:23,416
I mean, everybody knows.

1414
01:50:23,541 --> 01:50:27,336
Even Penny Lane.

1415
01:50:35,053 --> 01:50:36,929
How you doing?

1416
01:50:40,099 --> 01:50:42,268
Can you believe these new girls?

1417
01:50:42,351 --> 01:50:45,896
None of them use birth control,
and they eat all the steak.

1418
01:50:47,023 --> 01:50:51,360
I mean, they don't even know
what it is to be a fan.

1419
01:50:51,485 --> 01:50:57,366
You know, to truly love some silly
little piece of music, or some band...

1420
01:50:57,450 --> 01:51:01,578
so much that it hurts.

1421
01:51:10,004 --> 01:51:12,340
It's Russell.
Don’t hang up.

1422
01:51:12,465 --> 01:51:15,550
I can’t really talk right now.
I'm in a room full of people.

1423
01:51:23,934 --> 01:51:28,355
Actually, I'm alone.

1424
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:29,898
I won't call again, I promise.

1425
01:51:30,857 --> 01:51:33,526
But I need to see you face to face...

1426
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:37,864
because I'm never as good
as when you’re there...

1427
01:51:37,989 --> 01:51:43,161
and I can see myself
the way you look at me.

1428
01:51:43,245 --> 01:51:47,791
And I'm sorry. If we could just get
together and find some time to talk.

1429
01:51:53,129 --> 01:51:55,297
Let's say all the things
we never said.

1430
01:51:59,511 --> 01:52:00,929
Give me your address.

1431
01:52:03,431 --> 01:52:05,892
I'm coming to you...

1432
01:52:06,017 --> 01:52:08,769
this time.

1433
01:52:21,532 --> 01:52:23,450
Got a pen?

1434
01:52:58,402 --> 01:53:00,320
I'm Russell Hammond.

1435
01:53:01,738 --> 01:53:05,575
So this is the famous Russell Hammond.

1436
01:53:11,457 --> 01:53:13,374
Come in.

1437
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:22,800
- Is she home?
- Who? Anita?

1438
01:53:30,683 --> 01:53:32,268
- Where am I ?
- Hello?

1439
01:53:34,771 --> 01:53:38,231
You know, when we spoke,
I felt that we connected.

1440
01:54:01,547 --> 01:54:03,966
Oh, man.

1441
01:54:11,556 --> 01:54:14,226
My son is very important to me too...

1442
01:54:14,309 --> 01:54:16,979
and I do think you owe him
an apology.

1443
01:54:17,938 --> 01:54:21,275
- I appreciate you showing up.
- No, no, I agree...

1444
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:22,985
ma'am.

1445
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:30,241
There's hope for you yet, Russell.

1446
01:54:44,505 --> 01:54:45,881
Well--

1447
01:54:54,182 --> 01:54:59,812
So this is...
where the Enemy sleeps.

1448
01:55:06,027 --> 01:55:09,655
You know, I think we both wanted to--
to be with her.

1449
01:55:14,577 --> 01:55:16,954
And she wanted us to be together.

1450
01:55:32,303 --> 01:55:34,722
You should give her a call.

1451
01:55:34,847 --> 01:55:36,681
You both live in the same city.

1452
01:55:41,896 --> 01:55:44,315
- You really think I should?
- Yeah.

1453
01:55:47,318 --> 01:55:49,235
That girl really cares about you.

1454
01:55:52,906 --> 01:55:54,866
Man, I never even knew her real name.

1455
01:56:01,998 --> 01:56:05,377
Oh, I called your magazine...

1456
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:08,046
and told them the truth.

1457
01:56:09,923 --> 01:56:11,174
I don't know
what they're gonna do with it...

1458
01:56:11,258 --> 01:56:15,135
but I told them
every word you wrote was true.

1459
01:56:21,393 --> 01:56:25,480
We are gonna do this one more time.

1460
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:38,702
So, Russell...

1461
01:56:41,787 --> 01:56:44,206
what do you love about music?

1462
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:56,385
To begin with...

1463
01:56:57,845 --> 01:56:59,722
everything.

1464
01:57:07,313 --> 01:57:10,065
- Tickets!
- How much?

1465
01:57:26,123 --> 01:57:28,250
Morocco.
Seat by the window, please.
