1
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,138
Hike!

2
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,353
Martel!

3
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,148
Martel, you're a wimp!

4
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,569
I can't believe that Martel
goes for a give-up slide

5
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,615
-It did look cautious
-I could have scored on that!

6
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,201
It may be the lastplay
of the season.

7
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,080
The player's strike became official. ..

8
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,791
...at 4 p.m. Eastern Time.

9
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,170
I'm sad that the players ' demands,
which center around. ..

10
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,092
...a rise in the current salary cap,
were rejected by the owners.

11
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,929
I have told my union brothers to walk.

12
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,683
Get me Jimmy McGinty!
Have him here tonight

13
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,850
yes, sir

14
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,062
I'm here with Eddie Martel.

15
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:55,276
A lot of angry fans out there feel
that the players are being too greedy.

16
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,404
Any comments?

17
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,449
Dwight, I know $5 million a year
sounds like a lot of money...

18
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,870
...but I have to pay 10% to my agent,
5% to my lawyer--

19
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,916
Do you know what insurance costs
on a Ferrari, mother--

20
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,794
Pat, back to you.

21
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,464
That was Washington running back
Malcolm Lamont

22
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,969
It's all about money, folks,
but isn't it always?

23
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,306
Yes. This is Pat Summerall
for John Madden saying...

24
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,393
...so long from Nextel Stadium.

25
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,523
-you look like shit
-I'm dying, Jimmy

26
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,403
Come on

27
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,698
you've been dying for 20 years

28
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,669
-Give me a cigarette
-I quit

29
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,132
Nobody likes a quitter

30
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,679
-See the game today?
-No

31
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,348
Why, you liar

32
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,436
Could you believe that slide
by Martel?

33
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,148
What a pussy

34
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,197
-What's up?
-Take a ride with me

35
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,285
How's the wife?

36
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,704
She had her lips done

37
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,500
I never even knew you could
have your lips done

38
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,463
Looks like a largemouth bass

39
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,179
I'm too old to screw around
Let me give it to you straight

40
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,722
I want you back

41
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,560
-you already have a coach
-I'll take care of it

42
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,606
-Like you took care of me
-Now, Jimmy

43
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,026
your players all flew home
to their castles

44
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,320
in their private jets

45
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,823
We're gonna finish
the season anyway

46
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,867
I'm gonna use replacement players

47
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,997
-Jeez, what a business
-We got 4 games left

48
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,126
We win three, we're in the playoffs

49
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:21,089
Really? Win three out of four
with replacement players?

50
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,757
That's not too much to ask

51
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,636
you won for me once,
you can do it again

52
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,016
What's the matter, Jimmy?

53
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:35,103
Nobody's gonna give you
a better chance than this

54
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,772
after that Dallas mess

55
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:44,029
-I was right about that
-It had nothing to do with being right!

56
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,532
Went head-to-head with
an $8 million quarterback

57
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:52,287
Who did you think was gonna win?
That's not gonna happen here!

58
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:58,001
I'm talking about a team of poor
nobodies who play to win

59
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,046
Not a bunch of bitchy millionaires

60
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,799
Come on, Jimmy!

61
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,011
I'm thinking

62
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,352
Hello!

63
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,563
Hello!

64
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,958
I want total control of my team

65
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,922
I want to be able to recruit anybody
that I want, no interference

66
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,344
My word is my bond

67
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,807
I want it in writing

68
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,727
Okay, Jimmy

69
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,854
Okay

70
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,402
We thought we'd skip special teams
for now

71
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,864
It'll be tough enough to put
together a team in a week

72
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,076
-We're gonna go a different way
-A different way?

73
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,414
Here's a list of people I've
been watching over the years

74
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,501
They've all played football,
not all of them in the pros

75
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,046
But they all have something
unique to bring

76
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,092
We'll take them and try to
put together a winning team

77
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,638
If nothing else, they should
be fun to watch

78
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,683
Daniel Bateman, SWAT team officer

79
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,397
Awarded a Purple Heart for losing
a kidney during the Gulf War.

80
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,448
A walk-on at Michigan State
before he gave up football

81
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,577
...to sneak back into the service
for one more tour of duty.

82
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,495
Clifford Franklin

83
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:05,045
Great attitude, great desire, and the
fastest son of a bitch I've ever seen

84
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,383
Clifford! Twinkie!

85
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,186
What's up, man? Got any Twinkies?

86
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,562
Can he catch?

87
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,952
That's why I have you

88
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,915
Andre and Jamal Jackson

89
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,920
Together, these guys are the best
tandem team of guards in the game

90
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,969
-you're kidding me!
-Andre got traded and they fell apart

91
00:09:55,095 --> 00:10:00,016
He ain't our problem no more
We gonna play football

92
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,728
-Football?
-Football

93
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,565
Nigel Gruff

94
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:13,029
Striker out of Cardiff,
now residing in Hell's Kitchen.

95
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,993
He's ''The Leg'' because he can kick
a soccer ball the length of the field

96
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,329
Gentlemen

97
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,083
the drinks are on the house!

98
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,129
Bollocks!

99
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,799
Pissing away our money again?

100
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,595
-No, the money's on the way
-Where? To the OTB?

101
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,765
I got a winning horse!
I swear on my mum's grave!

102
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:45,103
your mother's grave?
He's swearing on his mother's grave!

103
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,647
Nigel, listen I want my money!

104
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,276
-Has he kept in shape?
-By Welsh standards

105
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,571
Shane Falco

106
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:01,286
Shane Falco? ''Footsteps'' Falco,
from Ohio State?

107
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,662
The same.

108
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,877
-He hasn't played in years.
-Should be well rested then.

109
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,010
you look like a swordfish
I caught once

110
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,055
He hit the deck just like that

111
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,268
-you know who I am?
-yeah

112
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,021
you're Jimmy McGinty

113
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,566
That old coach from the '80s

114
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,529
We met just before the Sugar Bowl

115
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,823
I remember

116
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,286
Hell of a game, that Sugar Bowl

117
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:48,833
-What'd you lose that by? 40 points?
-That would be 45

118
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,632
A game like that sticks with you
you never shake it off

119
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,345
-Got 3 concussions to prove it
-That's why girls don't play

120
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,141
Why are you here, coach?

121
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,853
Back with the Sentinels
I want you as quarterback

122
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,691
I found the best guards
and a wide receiver

123
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,442
even you couldn't overthrow

124
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,115
-I'm retired
-Retired?

125
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,328
It looks like things have gone
real well for you since

126
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,457
I got no complaints

127
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,085
It's quiet here

128
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,130
Nobody bothers me

129
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:40,176
The great thing about plankton is,
it pretty much keeps to itself

130
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,851
you know what separates the winners
from the losers?

131
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,561
The score

132
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,609
Getting back up after being
kicked in the teeth

133
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,238
I watched films of your games
since the Sugar Bowl

134
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:04,451
you shouldn't have been trying to
carry the whole team that first year

135
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,662
your teammates leaned on you
and you crumbled

136
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,879
-Is that how you want to be remembered?
-I don't want to be remembered at all

137
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:21,509
If you do well, who knows what'll
happen after the strike

138
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:26,431
I'm not making you any promises,
but why don't you take a chance?

139
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:31,478
Rather than scraping crap off
the bottom of somebody else's toys?

140
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,580
Think it over

141
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,461
you could be part of something

142
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:05,970
Football fans, what the owners are
doing is absolutely unconscionable

143
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,349
They have blatantly hired scabs

144
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:15,480
Which goes against our Constitution,
the Declaration of Independence...

145
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:20,235
...and the Emancipation Proclamation.
Here come the scabs now!

146
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,240
That's Eddie Martel!

147
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,498
I love you, man! What's happening?

148
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,876
I love you, man!

149
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,216
I'm gonna bust a cap in your ass!
And your ass!

150
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,260
Piss off!

151
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,762
Piss off!

152
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,549
Get that bible out of here!

153
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,056
Sorry about this

154
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,561
Put God in your heart!

155
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,822
I'm very sorry

156
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,793
Get a job, you wankers!

157
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:30,407
Looking good out there! you've got
the goods, you've got the goods!

158
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,493
Where did you learn
to catch like that?

159
00:16:55,473 --> 00:17:00,478
Roberts, make that D-back commit
before you cut, all right?

160
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,897
Jimmy

161
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,902
-My tight end is deaf
-yeah, I know

162
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,740
Jimmy, how am I gonna
coach a deaf man?

163
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,241
you won't need to

164
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:17,996
Brian Murphy would've gone in
the first round if he wasn't deaf

165
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,833
Played college ball here
in DC at Gallaudet

166
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,712
But I got to be able to communicate
with him and how

167
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,256
Learn to sign

168
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,758
Oh, horseshit!

169
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,929
Look at it this way, he'll never
be called offsides on an audible

170
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,225
-Good to see you
-you too

171
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,686
-How are you?
-Good, good

172
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,565
This is ''The Leg''?

173
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,696
I thought you told me
he was solid muscle

174
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,199
He's much stronger than he looks

175
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,701
I'm wiry

176
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,537
Go get some kicks in

177
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,465
He's ''wiry''

178
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,426
''Wiry''

179
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,446
you've been briefed
as to your situation

180
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,409
Coach McGinty wanted you
with us for 5 weeks

181
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,661
and the governor's complied

182
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,746
Nice watch

183
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,081
What?

184
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,666
Oh, this?

185
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,002
It's a fake

186
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,379
Damn thing's always broken

187
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,382
It's only right twice a day

188
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,884
Why don't we join the others?

189
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:59,264
No sense standing here by ourselves

190
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,766
out of screaming distance

191
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,603
-Come on, let's fire out of there!
-Jimmy

192
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,816
-Falco, when's he coming?
-Relax, he'll be here

193
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,818
Come on, quick feet!

194
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:16,322
I am relaxed, but that's not the point
It's nervous energy

195
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,743
Case in point, we don't have
a quarterback, do we?

196
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,788
-Fire out of there!
-We don't have a game plan for Sunday

197
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,336
And the only good thing I can say
about our offensive weapon is

198
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,339
it's wiry
What the shit is that?

199
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,299
No, no, it's ''wiry''

200
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:38,178
-However the hell you say it!
-Say it: ''Wiry''

201
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:44,559
Wiry

202
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,396
Holy! Look at this mamma-jamma!

203
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,872
Have you lost weight?

204
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,375
Coach, don't say that

205
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,504
you look great
Why don't you work out on this OD?

206
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,339
OD

207
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,011
-So he's lost weight?
-Sumo wrestler

208
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:25,600
Expert at pushing people around
That's what pass blocking is, remember?

209
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,976
That's right

210
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,729
Next one, 74 Come on!

211
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,399
Set, hut!

212
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,694
All right! Way to go!

213
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:42,409
It's all about pushing people around!
Set! Hut!

214
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:50,125
Come on, sumo boy
Let's see what you can do

215
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,876
Set Hut!

216
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,386
yes! Good hit, sumo boy!
Now get this off of me!

217
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,722
''That'll do, pig, that'll do''

218
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:08,893
-Screw you, cockroach
-you'll have to find your dick first

219
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,896
Get this off of me!

220
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,170
Hey, scab!

221
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,799
-I don't want any trouble
-you hear that?

222
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,428
He's taking away my job, but
he doesn't want any trouble

223
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,308
Not only is he taking your job,
he's taking your parking space too

224
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,976
What's up?

225
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,188
Is that right, Falco?

226
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,317
I didn't know it was yours
I'll move it

227
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,444
No, let us do that

228
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:03,198
Guys, move the new boy's ride for him

229
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,076
Coming right up, Mr Falco

230
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:13,625
Ready?

231
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:18,213
One Two Three

232
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,976
Thanks, guys

233
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,105
Asshole

234
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,484
Jesus! ''Footsteps'' Falco
They must be getting desperate

235
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,528
Hey, Falco!

236
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,531
you're not even a has-been!

237
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,742
you're a never-was!

238
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,499
Go!

239
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,007
Come on, pick it up!

240
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,810
Form a line here!
Let's go seven on seven

241
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,524
Check it out, our new quarterback

242
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,162
We're in business now

243
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,460
you're late

244
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,295
Car trouble

245
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,298
you still got an arm?

246
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,223
Hey, Falco

247
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,395
Go!

248
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,087
That's gonna leave a mark

249
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:27,676
-Leo, Franklin's down again
-I'm okay

250
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,054
I'm okay I'm okay

251
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,348
Let's play some football!

252
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,383
Danny Bateman

253
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,927
Shane Falco

254
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,387
Nice pop, Danny

255
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:14,973
Thanks, coach

256
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:18,560
In practice, we don't hit the fellows
with the red shirts on

257
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:24,065
I know, but I see that red and I just
want to go after it like a bull

258
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:27,944
Okay, Danny

259
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,280
Huddle up!

260
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:40,999
Get used to setting up on the run
Move fast, think even faster

261
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,836
-you'll live longer
-I'm very interested in that

262
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,421
Huddle up!

263
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,935
Hey! Shane Falco

264
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,731
I lost a ton of money on
that Sugar Bowl of yours

265
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,484
What a bloody shambles that was

266
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:11,279
you could smell the stink
all the way back in Wales

267
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,159
Nice meeting you

268
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,004
Ready!

269
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,758
Ready!

270
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:34,904
Hut!

271
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:51,171
Shit! I forgot about the whole red
shirt thing! This game's confusing

272
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:57,927
Remember

273
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:01,389
red means stop

274
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,933
Like a streetlight, right?

275
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:07,395
-yeah
-Get on up

276
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:12,525
Go ahead I'm gonna lie here
a moment and collect my thoughts

277
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:14,819
Work shit out, right?

278
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,332
-you should be glad he's on your side
-yeah

279
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:44,057
-So you have a cheer or something?
-Are you ready?

280
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:48,645
Let's hear it for the quarterback
Hey-hey, ho-ho

281
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:52,899
Could anyone play better?
Say-say, no-no

282
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:56,444
Tackle, tackle, tackle, tackle
Tack, tack, tack

283
00:28:56,736 --> 00:29:00,073
Show those others boys what they
Lack, lack, lack

284
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:03,785
If I gave you a dollar
you could keep most of the change

285
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:08,123
'Cause all I really want
is a ''quarterback!''

286
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,795
California oranges, Texas cactus

287
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,841
We think your team
Needs a little practice

288
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:22,387
Sit 'em in a highchair
Feed 'em with a spoon

289
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:26,141
Roll 'em up in toilet paper
Kick 'em to the moon!

290
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,936
-That was great, thank you
-Thank you

291
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,271
Can you dance?

292
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,578
Let me have some of that duck

293
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:52,459
-What the hell is this?
-Chinese spareribs

294
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:56,212
If you don't want it,
get the fuck out of here

295
00:29:56,504 --> 00:30:00,300
I'm trying to figure out how
the Chinaman over here

296
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:04,012
gets 700 pounds off
of eating this shit

297
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,598
I'm Japanese, not Chinese

298
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,351
-Same difference
-What?

299
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,186
It's the same difference!

300
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,772
All that big--

301
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,403
Nigger, please

302
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:24,991
you do know Japan and China are
two different countries, right?

303
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:28,703
-you do know I got a atlas, bitch
-Really, gangster?

304
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,121
yeah

305
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:41,466
We're on the same team! We're on
the same team! Now chill out!

306
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,262
-The mick's right
-I'm not a mick! I'm bloody Welsh!

307
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:49,974
Whatever

308
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,770
-I'm going to sit with the deaf kid!
-Jesus Christ!

309
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,941
Praise His glory, Nigel!
you praise His glory!

310
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:06,825
Smear their blood all over town

311
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,537
Punch 'em, hit 'em
Make it last

312
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,416
Come on, boys, let's kick some ass!

313
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:25,010
I played one game in the pros,
I blew out my knee and that was it

314
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,761
Shit

315
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:32,892
All I want to do is score one touchdown
before I hang up my pads That's it

316
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:35,353
you'll get it

317
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:52,704
Hey, man

318
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:56,916
Wilkinson! Earl Wilkinson!

319
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:02,547
I knew I recognized you, man!
I knew it!

320
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,258
you played for Minnesota, baby!

321
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:10,138
Oh, shit! Earl Wilkinson, man!
Oh, my God!

322
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:15,185
you'd have been All-Pro if
you hadn't beat up them cops!

323
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:21,316
What I had meant to say
was ''allegedly''

324
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:26,446
allegedly beat up them cops
and because

325
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:32,577
a good Christian boy like you
would never do nothing like that!

326
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,412
That's right

327
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:38,875
The way I heard it, my man didn't
even do nothing anyway!

328
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,711
Them cops were just jealous of
the black man

329
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:45,256
Hear what I'm saying?
My boy been living large!

330
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,594
I can't stand the cops!
I better not see a cop!

331
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:55,100
-I'll whup a cop's ass! Believe it!
-I'm a cop

332
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,151
Look!

333
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,612
Bundt cake!

334
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,328
-Look at these yummy little monkeys!
-Hello!

335
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,080
Oh, hey

336
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,793
you-- yeah

337
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:28,341
-Are you Heather and Dawn?
-yep, we sure are

338
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,844
you don't know how excited I am

339
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:35,265
that I actually have some girls
with dance experience!

340
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:39,644
-I'm excited too!
-I know! Me too, too

341
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:45,150
So Heather, you were in Cats,
which is so terrific--

342
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,945
No, Pussycats

343
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:52,991
you know, the club next to the airport?
Pussycats?

344
00:33:56,494 --> 00:34:01,875
-That style of dancing would be--
-Is lap-dancing a style?

345
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,294
No I mean

346
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:08,298
Oh, my God, I forgot
to tell you something

347
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,175
What?

348
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:13,428
Oh, she always does that

349
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,310
I've seen all I need to see

350
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:23,938
No way! I'm so excited!

351
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,315
Go suit up

352
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:29,402
- Go down the tunnel and to the left
-Okay

353
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,160
If you guys have any friends down at
the club, would you send them over?

354
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:41,456
-Sure
-yeah, absolutely

355
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:44,125
Where are you going, number 48?

356
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,932
I was watching you today

357
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,060
you looked good

358
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,272
Good release, strong arm
you're gonna do fine

359
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,316
Thanks

360
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,235
I'm Annabelle Farrell

361
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,612
-Shane Falco
-I know

362
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:17,033
I remember you from the
'96 Sugar Bowl game

363
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:20,745
Didn't anybody have anything
better to do that day?

364
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:25,959
you should get some help
to turn this back over

365
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:31,172
yeah, I was thinking I'd call AAA
later or something

366
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:38,263
-Do you want a lift?
-yeah

367
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:42,017
yeah, that would be great Thanks

368
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:50,859
Why'd you stay in the pocket
at practice?

369
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:54,529
I don't comment to quarterbacks
about style but

370
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:58,908
you need to keep scrambling
against Detroit, with Prescott back

371
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:02,662
-Prescott hasn't crossed
-Sunday

372
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:06,332
-It's a secret so you can't prepare
-How do you know?

373
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,919
My friend's a cheerleader for Detroit
She tipped me

374
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,381
He's left-sided, shotgun
formation, roll right

375
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,842
Van Gundy's on the right

376
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:19,554
He's been All-Pro 2 years,
but one of my cheerleaders

377
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,724
is friends with a girl
who broke up with him

378
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,061
He's been drinking ever
since she left him

379
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:31,399
He's hung over! He's a good second
slower off the snap than usual

380
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,610
I'll stick to the right side

381
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:37,113
Unless what they say
about Martinez is true

382
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:44,579
-That was fun
-This is great! you live out here?

383
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:47,165
Which one's yours?

384
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:51,169
Here you see that white yacht
with the satellite dish?

385
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:57,092
I'm the old boat next to it,
covered in seagull shit

386
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:00,929
What did you name her?

387
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,514
Phyxsius.

388
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:07,435
-Phyxsius, what does that mean?
-''Putting to flight''

389
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:13,650
you want to come onboard for a beer?

390
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:19,614
Nothing personal, but I don't
date football players

391
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:22,117
I don't blame you

392
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,160
Not even quarterbacks?

393
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:30,125
Especially not quarterbacks you guys
are the biggest babies of all

394
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,544
The biggest babies?

395
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:34,629
yeah

396
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:39,050
-Thanks for the ride
-Good luck on Sunday

397
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,513
-Be careful out there
-I will

398
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,403
Shane

399
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:00,989
What's up?

400
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,658
Just

401
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:06,411
watching the game

402
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,583
Nervous?

403
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,669
No

404
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,379
I'm good

405
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,925
Like a duck on a pond

406
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:24,679
On the surface everything
looks calm but

407
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:29,100
beneath the water, those feet
are churning a mile a minute

408
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,479
you'll be fine

409
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:37,192
Find a way to lead your team
Earn their respect

410
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:39,694
yeah

411
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:44,699
How are you doing?

412
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,202
Me?

413
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:52,415
I'm just another duck on the pond

414
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:58,463
Coach, can I ask you a question?

415
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:03,468
-yeah, shoot
-Why me?

416
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:11,142
I look at you and I see two men

417
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:15,146
the man you are,
and the man you ought to be

418
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,483
Someday, those two will meet

419
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,237
Make for a hell of a football player

420
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,328
Get some sleep, kiddo

421
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:34,040
you play professional
football tomorrow

422
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,732
Welcome to Nextel Stadium,
in our nation's capital.

423
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:02,277
I'm Pat Summerall and
with me is John Madden

424
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:07,824
Detroit bought an entire semi-pro
team once the strike happened.

425
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:11,411
Washington is going with
a bunch of unknowns.

426
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,873
But we'll see a few guys
we know today.

427
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:19,294
Like Shane Falco, that talented
quarterback who fell out of sight. ..

428
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:22,714
...after a disastrous showing
in the Sugar Bowl.

429
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,600
Having a little snacky-poo
before the game?

430
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:38,563
-It does a body good
-you are one crazy son of a bitch

431
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:41,066
-you know how I know that?
-How?

432
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:44,903
Because only you'd eat eggs
before a game!

433
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,821
I need to bulk up

434
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:48,698
-you want one?
-No!

435
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,076
It's good for you

436
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:06,091
Sentinels, listen up

437
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:12,347
Welcome to professional football

438
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:18,812
Some will say that your
accomplishments

439
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:24,859
will soon be forgotten, you're not
real players, this isn't a real team

440
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:27,737
And I say that is bullshit!

441
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:33,702
Because as of today, you're all
professional football players

442
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:38,915
you're being paid to play
I want you to remember that because

443
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:43,670
the men whose places you've taken
forgot that a long time ago

444
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:46,589
Bring it in here

445
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:49,050
Bring it in, guys

446
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:52,470
Let's play some football!

447
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,889
-DC!
-All right!

448
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:58,018
For some of these players,
this is another shot.

449
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:01,229
And a last shot for a guy like Falco.

450
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:04,065
Remember that beating he took
from Florida?

451
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:11,156
That's nothing compared to those
beatings he took in Seattle.

452
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:15,493
One thing we do know is that
Falco can take a hit

453
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:20,206
Well, I'll tell you, he's sure
had a lot of practice at it.

454
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:33,803
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Washington Sentinels!

455
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:44,939
-Did you see that?
-That's a pretty good hit

456
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:51,738
Will the medical trainers please
report to the east tunnel?

457
00:42:57,535 --> 00:43:00,330
Maybe he was a little
overanxious, huh?

458
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:08,713
And now, the rest of
the Washington Sentinels.

459
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:36,991
Kick-off!

460
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:49,087
Let's go, let's go!

461
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:56,261
There can only be one leader out
there, all right? you be it

462
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:11,317
-That's where I stand
-No, it's not

463
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:14,487
-That's my spot in the huddle
-It's not

464
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:18,074
-Get to your spot
-Let's go, chopstick!

465
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:21,411
Let's play football! What do you say?

466
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:32,839
-It's my spot now!
-Not for long, you tub of rice shit!

467
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,341
What's the problem?

468
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:37,552
you can't do jack shit!

469
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,806
-Pork rice!
-I'm Japanese, not Chinese!

470
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:43,975
Don't mess with my brother

471
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:46,311
What's going on?

472
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:50,065
Something seems to be going on
in the huddle.

473
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:55,070
Falco's on his back.
-Come on

474
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,907
They haven't had a play yet
and Falco's down.

475
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:03,870
He got hit by his own guy! He was
looking out his earhole for a minute!

476
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:06,331
This isn't a good sign.

477
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:11,836
-Am I hurt already?
-Near knocked your head off

478
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:13,838
Let's go

479
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,843
Come on, get it together!

480
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:25,433
I'm the quarterback I'm the only one
who talks in the huddle

481
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,186
-But he was in my spot
-I don't care!

482
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,105
Now huddle up

483
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:41,741
If you've got something to say,
raise your hand

484
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:43,868
Is that understood?

485
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:49,499
Suppose you don't feel good
Or you're hurt

486
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,627
Tell me before the huddle starts
Okay?

487
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,130
Okay, here we go

488
00:45:56,464 --> 00:45:59,175
DC Right, Switch 25 Blast--

489
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:02,637
What?

490
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:05,140
-To the left?
-The right

491
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:06,516
The left!

492
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:13,898
Be quiet or they'll hear us,
and then what?

493
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,238
Play game!

494
00:46:20,238 --> 00:46:23,908
Number 16 on the offense! 5 yards!

495
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:27,078
Pat, so far the Sentinels

496
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:31,416
have minus 10 yards offensively

497
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:35,754
I've seen monkey-shit fights
at the zoo more organized!

498
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:42,844
DC Right pro 424 Tomahawk,
on one, on one Ready?

499
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:55,607
Ready?

500
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:00,653
I'm coming for you, Footsteps!

501
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:05,950
Green 22!

502
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,370
Hut, hut! Hut!

503
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:13,333
Come on, Shane!

504
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:22,801
You could hear Falco's fillings
drop all the way up here!

505
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:27,722
Detroit takes over the football
with excellent field position.

506
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:29,724
-Give me an S!
-S!

507
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:31,851
-Give me an E!
-E!

508
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,978
-Give me an N!
-N!

509
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:35,980
-Give me a T!
-T!

510
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:37,816
Give me a

511
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:39,734
-I!
-I!

512
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:43,988
We'll get them next time

513
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:53,289
Eagle over cover four!

514
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:55,250
On three, get ready!

515
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,548
All day, blue eyes!
It's Christmas morning

516
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,260
and Santa's coming down
the chimney!

517
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:10,265
I'm gonna bury your family!
I'm gonna bury your dog!

518
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,018
Champ, champ!

519
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:20,734
Now that's football!

520
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:23,153
you get it? you like it?

521
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:31,536
The Sentinels set a record for
penalties in the first 3 minutes!

522
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:36,541
We 're waiting for the stats on that.
-Personal foul!

523
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:42,839
Number 56 on the defense!
Half the distance to the goal!

524
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:45,884
Bateman on that one
Just a cheap shot

525
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:51,556
-That should be worse than a penalty.
-They're walking right through us!

526
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,064
Touchdown, Detroit!

527
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:07,197
Don't worry about it

528
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:29,094
Let's go!

529
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:38,061
Double slot zag, okay?

530
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:40,897
-What?
-I don't feel too good

531
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:43,608
-Suck it up
-Come on!

532
00:49:44,526 --> 00:49:46,152
Jesus Christ!

533
00:49:52,283 --> 00:49:54,119
-Eggs!
-That's ripe!

534
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:58,623
What'd you eat, man?

535
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:02,919
If we don't move,
I'm going to blow chow, too

536
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:07,882
We're in a huddle!
Double slot zag, 88--

537
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:11,928
Jesus!

538
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:14,264
Goddamn!

539
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:19,519
I tried to tell you, I can't be around
somebody puking or I start puking

540
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:21,688
Shit

541
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:25,442
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

542
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:27,068
On three

543
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:33,074
everyone move left Ready
Hut, hut, hut

544
00:50:38,413 --> 00:50:40,415
What the hell is that?

545
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,001
What?

546
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:49,591
John, how many years we been
calling games together?

547
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:50,884
19, I think.

548
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:52,927
Ever seen that?

549
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:58,350
Not on a football field

550
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,979
-What are they doing?
-Beats me

551
00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:08,318
Look at it this way It's the first
thing we've done together as a team

552
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:11,696
-Hey!
-Clean it up! Let's go!

553
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:13,073
Break!

554
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:33,176
Ready? Blue 42!

555
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,224
Blue 42!

556
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:42,102
Hut!

557
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,751
First down, Washington.

558
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:11,756
-Was it out of bounds?
-yes, on 23

559
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:18,054
-Blue Right 60 X Post
-Blue Right 60 X Post!

560
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:20,849
Let's go, let's go!

561
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:44,289
Now we rolling!

562
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:48,084
Signs of life from Washington here.

563
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:53,423
That last completion by Falco puts
them back in field goal range

564
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:56,009
-Field goal, let's go!
-Field goal

565
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:57,385
Nigel

566
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:06,019
It's over the bar, not under
Okay? Go get 'em

567
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:10,065
-Hold that
-Here comes the field goal team.

568
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:14,652
A 40-yard attempt for kicker
Nigel Gruff, against the wind.

569
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:20,825
Here's the guy from Wales, and he's
kicking his first field goal ever.

570
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:23,370
This is a tough distance.

571
00:53:43,556 --> 00:53:47,102
yeah, she's there! She's there!

572
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:52,273
-Boom! Boom!
Nigel Gruffkicks and scores!

573
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:58,154
Halftime score:
Washington 3, Detroit 14.

574
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,257
That's the second time
a Washington player has been...

575
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:21,886
-knocked out by his own teammate
-There's a rule in sports:

576
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:26,099
Don't do anything great if you
can't handle the congratulations

577
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:28,601
-There is?
-yep

578
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,896
-Give me an S!
-S!

579
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:34,441
-Give me an E!
-E!

580
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:36,067
-Give me an N!
-N!

581
00:54:36,484 --> 00:54:38,319
-Give me a T!
-T!

582
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:40,822
Give me a

583
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:03,636
All right, let's go!

584
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:19,486
Touchdown, Smith! That one gets
the Sentinels back into the game.

585
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:23,198
This guy is a heck of a player,
but I don't know him.

586
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:27,077
And according to the Sentinels,
it says Ray Smith is--

587
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:30,705
That's weird! No college given,
no high school.

588
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:34,459
He 's been a resident
of the state of Maryland. ..

589
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:38,380
the last 2 years,
and he likes to embroider!

590
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:42,175
-He does fancy work with the ball
-Weird

591
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,477
Ready!

592
00:55:57,023 --> 00:55:58,400
Green 11 !

593
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,277
Green 11 !

594
00:56:08,993 --> 00:56:12,122
Falco's sacked and the ball
comes loose.

595
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:16,126
It's Detroit's ball with
only a minute remaining.

596
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:22,632
Danny, Danny, Danny

597
00:56:23,299 --> 00:56:25,760
I need that ball Get me the ball

598
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:27,053
you need the ball

599
00:56:27,595 --> 00:56:29,556
-Get me the ball
-The ball

600
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,433
Are you gonna get me the ball?

601
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:39,983
I hope he doesn't kill somebody

602
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:44,988
I'm back! I'm back!

603
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,198
Get the ball!

604
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:09,554
I got it!

605
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:13,308
Now that is all-Madden team!

606
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:15,143
-you're the man
-I'm the man!

607
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:18,813
-you got me the ball
-I got you the ball!

608
00:57:27,113 --> 00:57:29,574
-Go sit down now, Danny
-Okay

609
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:36,373
Number 56 recovers the ball.
-Falco!

610
00:57:37,582 --> 00:57:40,835
We gotta pass
It's gotta be in the end zone

611
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:45,256
DC Right, Zig, 90 Eagle
you can do this

612
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:48,510
All right? Let's do it! Come on!

613
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:09,656
-Blue, 25!
-Here comes the pain, baby!

614
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:12,450
Blue, 25!

615
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,373
-Check!
-What are you doing?

616
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:19,791
Check!

617
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:24,629
Black 32!

618
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:27,132
-What?
-He's changing the play

619
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:29,718
He's checking off the run
It's a pass!

620
00:58:36,474 --> 00:58:37,475
Shit!

621
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:13,595
Falco calls an audible
at the line of scrimmage...

622
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:18,600
...and Cochran almost has a touchdown!
Heartbreaker for Washington.

623
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:33,615
Final score:
Washington 10, Detroit 14.

624
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:37,577
I didn't want Cochran
to have that ball

625
00:59:37,869 --> 00:59:40,205
-I read blitz
-Bullshit

626
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:44,167
I put the game in your hands
you got scared

627
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:45,960
I read blitz

628
00:59:51,257 --> 00:59:54,928
Winners always want the ball
when the game's on the line

629
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:44,894
WFAN, the Sports Fan's Show.
How do you feel about the strike?

630
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:50,650
The fans are getting screwed. I got
season tickets I can't give away!

631
01:00:51,234 --> 01:00:55,530
-What about the replacement players?
-They're nobodies.

632
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:09,336
At first I was afraid
I was petrified

633
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:15,008
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side

634
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:19,971
But then I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong

635
01:01:20,263 --> 01:01:21,556
And I grew strong

636
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:24,934
Why'd you play that dumb-ass song?

637
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:28,772
I put on The Commodores
That shit just came on

638
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:31,775
Can somebody please cut
that bullshit off?

639
01:01:32,984 --> 01:01:37,781
-We did the best we could do
-you don't get points for trying

640
01:01:38,114 --> 01:01:41,201
Let's face it, boys,
we screwed the pooch today

641
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:47,457
Hey, there they are!

642
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,043
Ladies and gentlemen

643
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:53,713
your Washington Sentinels!

644
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:02,722
He's the luckiest guy here At least
he couldn't hear the booing today!

645
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:08,144
Hello! Anyone home?
Did I hear an echo?

646
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:12,482
Where'd McGinty get Rain Man?
Special Olympics?

647
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:17,487
No wonder they couldn't win
He can't even order a drink!

648
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,787
-Lay off
-Lighten up

649
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:27,872
It's not like he can hear

650
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:29,249
I can

651
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:37,507
What's that say?

652
01:02:39,175 --> 01:02:43,847
''One good thing about being deaf,
you can ignore the assholes''

653
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:49,144
you asshole

654
01:02:51,354 --> 01:02:52,605
That's funny

655
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:02,532
It's cool, it's cool!

656
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:07,537
you had enough?

657
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:13,043
you got shit for brains,
but you've got balls

658
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:14,502
Thank you

659
01:03:17,088 --> 01:03:21,593
Danny, remember what I told you
about red shirts in practice?

660
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:25,055
-Forget about it
-Okay

661
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,598
Martel

662
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:40,070
Who's the man? Who's the man?

663
01:03:40,195 --> 01:03:42,572
Come on! Come on!

664
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:51,331
Come on, come on! Stop!

665
01:03:53,249 --> 01:03:55,627
Let's play football, bitch!

666
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:04,594
We are all God's children here!

667
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:25,573
''And deliver thee into the hands
of brutish men!''

668
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:35,792
Ezekiel 21 :31

669
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:44,467
This is some old bullshit!

670
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:47,721
It's more of a homecoming for you.

671
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:50,223
you gonna be a funny man?

672
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:53,893
Bateman! Wilkinson! Come on,
guys, what are you doing?

673
01:04:55,478 --> 01:04:57,647
Can't we all just get along?

674
01:05:01,693 --> 01:05:02,902
Come on

675
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:07,741
Why are we the only ones in this jail?

676
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:11,619
-Simple They're winners
-Hell, no Not tonight

677
01:05:11,953 --> 01:05:16,416
That was pretty sweet, you
sitting on Wilson's head, Jumbo

678
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:20,170
Thanks, Jamal

679
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:30,638
He wasn't the only one
who kicked ass

680
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:33,933
you the man tonight,
Clifford Franklin!

681
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:37,187
What?

682
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:40,523
you were hiding behind the jukebox
Wasn't he?

683
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:49,491
At first, I admit, I was afraid

684
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:54,412
-Shit, I was petrified
-you were petrified?

685
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:57,999
Thinking I could never live
without you by my side

686
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:02,921
-The Lord is by your side
-Have mercy

687
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:08,968
Then I spent so many nights,
thinking how you did me wrong

688
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:14,057
And I grew strong

689
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:16,726
you know I hate this damn song

690
01:06:17,018 --> 01:06:20,522
I learned how to get along
And so you're back

691
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:23,024
From outer space

692
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:28,238
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face

693
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:33,368
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key

694
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:39,040
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

695
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,250
Go on, now go

696
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:43,128
Walk out the door

697
01:06:44,045 --> 01:06:49,009
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

698
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:50,260
Remember this?

699
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:54,014
Weren't you the one who tried to
Hurt me with goodbye

700
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:59,728
Did you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die

701
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:03,523
Oh no, not I
I will survive

702
01:07:05,316 --> 01:07:09,529
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

703
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:14,409
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give

704
01:07:15,326 --> 01:07:16,870
And I'll survive

705
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:19,039
I will survive

706
01:07:20,331 --> 01:07:22,125
Hey, hey

707
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:45,398
It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart

708
01:07:45,857 --> 01:07:50,779
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart

709
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:56,034
But I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself

710
01:07:56,618 --> 01:08:01,623
I used to cry
And now I hold my head up high

711
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:04,793
And you see me
-Four, five!

712
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:09,089
Okay, all right

713
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:15,804
Frankie

714
01:08:22,894 --> 01:08:27,065
If anything like this bar fight
happens again

715
01:08:27,357 --> 01:08:30,735
there'll be no place
on the team for any of you

716
01:08:32,904 --> 01:08:36,616
-Do I make myself perfectly clear?
-yes, sir

717
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,119
And just for the record

718
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:44,749
I would love to have seen
Martel get his ass kicked

719
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:46,626
Let's get out of here!

720
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:58,054
Hey, Shane

721
01:09:00,682 --> 01:09:02,892
What are you doing?

722
01:09:03,059 --> 01:09:04,477
My job

723
01:09:05,854 --> 01:09:10,483
-you're a professional football player
-Sure, this week

724
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:14,154
When that's all over, you know

725
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:18,700
I'll be back here
I don't want to lose my customers

726
01:09:20,744 --> 01:09:24,456
I was on my way to work
Do you need a ride?

727
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:26,666
I'm good

728
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:31,713
-I got my truck back
-How is it?

729
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:36,676
Flatter But it runs

730
01:09:39,304 --> 01:09:43,266
And you? How are you running
after last night?

731
01:09:45,852 --> 01:09:47,395
you hear about that?

732
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:50,440
I think the whole town heard
about that

733
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:53,485
Is that from the game or the fight?

734
01:09:54,819 --> 01:09:59,199
I'm not sure It's all blurred
into one big beating

735
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:03,661
The good news is,
you guys got into a rhythm

736
01:10:04,245 --> 01:10:08,291
Apart from that vomiting thing,
which was on Sports Center.

737
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,460
Oh, God

738
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:14,255
After that,
the team was really clicking

739
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:19,302
yeah, it was starting
to come together

740
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:20,845
yeah

741
01:10:23,723 --> 01:10:26,810
-you want to sit down?
-No, I should go

742
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,605
Thanks for coming by

743
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:35,527
-Wow Ow
-What? What?

744
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:37,987
Oh Ow!

745
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:39,948
Jesus!

746
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:43,702
-It looks worse than it feels
-It looks like hell

747
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:48,623
-Then it looks exactly like it feels
-Here

748
01:10:52,502 --> 01:10:54,295
''Wild yam''?

749
01:10:54,295 --> 01:10:55,505
yeah

750
01:10:56,798 --> 01:11:02,512
Don't laugh, it works It's great
for sore muscles and bruises

751
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:07,183
-I use it all the time
-you don't have to do that

752
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:12,313
you'll put it on? you can't move
This will be a little bit

753
01:11:12,605 --> 01:11:15,734
-Cold!
-Sorry, sorry

754
01:11:18,069 --> 01:11:19,863
Here, your shoulders

755
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:25,702
Better?

756
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,038
Better

757
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:43,261
you're the first player
I can remember

758
01:11:43,553 --> 01:11:46,890
who cares more about his teammates
than himself

759
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:53,563
That's something this team's been
missing for a really long time

760
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:58,151
It's a good thing you did last night

761
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:00,695
It was just stupid

762
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:06,826
Thanks

763
01:12:11,873 --> 01:12:14,959
-I'm gonna be late for work
-Practice?

764
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:16,961
No, actually, I have work

765
01:12:17,545 --> 01:12:22,425
We only make 50 bucks a game
Gotta pay the bills, right?

766
01:12:23,134 --> 01:12:27,013
Mac's, down on A Street
Come in, I'll buy you a beer

767
01:12:28,139 --> 01:12:29,641
All right, I'll do that

768
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:36,231
Keep putting that yam on

769
01:12:58,628 --> 01:13:00,046
Guys!

770
01:13:10,765 --> 01:13:13,143
you gotta be kidding

771
01:13:13,393 --> 01:13:15,645
I didn't park in your space

772
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:18,273
No, no, no

773
01:13:18,606 --> 01:13:22,110
But unfortunately, you did park
in Lamont's space

774
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:28,700
-He's not nearly as lenient as I am
-On three, fellas

775
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:42,672
-We got this We got this
-you want to put the car back?

776
01:13:43,214 --> 01:13:45,675
This is none of your business

777
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:48,219
Shane is our business

778
01:13:48,219 --> 01:13:51,931
-We're the guards
-And we protect our quarterback

779
01:13:55,143 --> 01:13:59,439
This is funny to them bozos
you got jokes? you got jokes?

780
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:02,734
That's your ride right there,
ain't it?

781
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:05,070
yeah

782
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:14,496
That's my windshield--!

783
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:17,123
-Now put the car back
-Son of a bitch!

784
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,876
Son of a--

785
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:24,673
Oh, son of a bitch? I'm a son
of a bitch? Son of a bitch?

786
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,469
Stop, stop, stop!

787
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,971
Come on, goddamn it, help me!

788
01:14:33,348 --> 01:14:35,183
you're gonna pay for this!

789
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:40,730
No, I'm not And stop messing with
my man, that includes his ride

790
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:42,607
And wax that motherfucker

791
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,735
Give it a tune-up too

792
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:49,989
Ready to go to practice?

793
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:53,284
yeah, let's do that

794
01:14:53,284 --> 01:14:56,162
-How's that arm?
-Good

795
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,623
What's that smell?

796
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:00,750
Wild yam

797
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:03,795
-That's nice
-you like that?

798
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:10,885
And so, boys and girls,
if anybody does have any firearms...

799
01:15:11,177 --> 01:15:14,514
...you need to turn them in
as soon as possible.

800
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:16,307
No questions asked

801
01:15:18,309 --> 01:15:19,769
Understood?

802
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:29,529
All right

803
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:32,782
Okay, coach, it's all yours

804
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:47,255
Last Sunday, I saw a team on the field
play as hard as they could

805
01:15:47,547 --> 01:15:49,841
to win the football game

806
01:15:50,342 --> 01:15:55,138
We lost Not because
of effort or desire

807
01:15:55,847 --> 01:16:00,810
but because of lack of leadership
and trust One's been resolved

808
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:05,857
But leadership means nothing if
we don't believe in each other

809
01:16:05,857 --> 01:16:10,362
Players spend years together
before they develop trust

810
01:16:10,862 --> 01:16:15,075
I'm asking you to do it in a week,
not reasonable but

811
01:16:15,367 --> 01:16:18,328
these aren't reasonable times

812
01:16:19,621 --> 01:16:24,584
I know you all have concerns
about this Sunday

813
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:30,840
But a real man

814
01:16:35,178 --> 01:16:37,097
admits his fears

815
01:16:39,974 --> 01:16:42,852
I'm asking you
to do that here, tonight

816
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:47,857
Who wants to start?

817
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,651
Let's talk about fears

818
01:16:50,985 --> 01:16:52,737
Fears Fears

819
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:03,373
I'm scared of spiders, coach

820
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:09,671
-That's not what I meant
-I'm afraid of spiders too

821
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,466
Goddamn spiders freak me, too, fellas

822
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,137
Well, I didn't mean that--

823
01:17:17,345 --> 01:17:21,182
Ever get one of those spiders
crawling up your arm?

824
01:17:21,474 --> 01:17:23,852
-Crawling on you?
-Damn!

825
01:17:24,144 --> 01:17:28,398
Thanks, Jumbo you can just
rock me to sleep tonight

826
01:17:29,774 --> 01:17:35,905
Okay, that's great, but I'm talking
about what scares us on the field

827
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:39,659
Like spiders on the field?

828
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:43,413
Can we get beyond the spiders, please?

829
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,374
Bees

830
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:48,710
Bees?

831
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:50,920
-Bees?
-Bees

832
01:17:53,798 --> 01:17:57,844
Anybody here afraid of anything
other than insects?

833
01:17:58,762 --> 01:17:59,763
Come on

834
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:02,515
Quicksand

835
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:08,438
Shit, yeah!
Quicksand's a scary mother, man

836
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:12,859
It sucks you right in and even
if you scream, you get that muck--

837
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:15,320
I don't think that's it

838
01:18:17,405 --> 01:18:19,783
That's not what he had in mind

839
01:18:20,283 --> 01:18:23,495
-What's he talking about, then?
-Ask him

840
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:28,708
What's up, Shane?

841
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:34,047
you're playing

842
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:40,261
and you think everything is going
fine But then one thing goes wrong

843
01:18:40,512 --> 01:18:41,513
And another

844
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:45,058
And another

845
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:51,064
you try to fight back, but the harder
you fight, the deeper you sink

846
01:18:52,273 --> 01:18:53,817
Until you can't move

847
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:58,029
you can't breathe

848
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,784
because you're in over your head

849
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:07,247
Like quicksand

850
01:19:16,047 --> 01:19:19,968
That's some deep shit
Some deep shit

851
01:19:24,806 --> 01:19:26,349
Anything else?

852
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:31,771
-Going back to the mini-mart
-The shipping yard

853
01:19:32,313 --> 01:19:33,690
The auto plant

854
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:36,026
Prison

855
01:19:37,318 --> 01:19:38,820
yeah, all right

856
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:48,538
The truth is, you guys have been
given something

857
01:19:48,621 --> 01:19:51,041
that every athlete dreams of

858
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:54,878
A second chance

859
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:57,630
And you're afraid of blowing it

860
01:19:59,049 --> 01:20:00,300
We all are

861
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:04,220
But now our fear is shared
and we can overcome it together

862
01:20:04,846 --> 01:20:09,225
Let's lose that fear this Sunday
and put it into San Diego!

863
01:20:10,226 --> 01:20:11,686
Come on!

864
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:27,369
Another vicious hit by
the All-Pro Hank Morris.

865
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:29,829
That's his third of the game.

866
01:20:29,913 --> 01:20:31,831
It's just me, dickhead

867
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:36,086
I tell you, he is really putting
a hurt on Falco.

868
01:20:36,419 --> 01:20:39,839
I'm not sure how much more
of this abuse he can take

869
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,593
Huddle up!

870
01:20:43,718 --> 01:20:45,387
Huddle up!

871
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:51,810
Same play, except let Morris by
Nobody touch him

872
01:20:52,852 --> 01:20:56,106
-It's 16-0 already
-I said let him through!

873
01:20:59,442 --> 01:21:03,071
Get some penetration, Morris!
Get some penetration!

874
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:05,573
Blue, 88!

875
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:24,300
Now, that is a hit!

876
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:30,640
Holy shit!

877
01:21:31,182 --> 01:21:35,020
Let's haul ass, round boy!
Follow me! Follow me!

878
01:21:41,192 --> 01:21:43,653
Holy shit! Holy shit!

879
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:48,992
Go!

880
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:51,453
Jump on his back!

881
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:54,914
Here it comes! I'm coming through!

882
01:21:56,207 --> 01:21:57,417
Jump on his back!

883
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:06,468
Fumiko scores! Fumiko scores!

884
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,971
I love to see a fat guy score!

885
01:22:09,971 --> 01:22:11,514
Why?

886
01:22:11,806 --> 01:22:16,853
Because you get a fat guy spike,
and then you get a fat guy dance.

887
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,026
Pork rice!

888
01:22:29,991 --> 01:22:31,576
That's not in the playbook

889
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:33,995
yeah

890
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:37,457
Maybe we should put it in

891
01:22:41,711 --> 01:22:43,713
Kickoff!

892
01:23:21,334 --> 01:23:26,256
So, Annabelle, what do you, like,
think of our friends?

893
01:23:27,048 --> 01:23:28,800
I think

894
01:23:30,093 --> 01:23:31,886
they're friendly

895
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:33,888
I know! Aren't they?

896
01:23:35,056 --> 01:23:36,516
yeah

897
01:23:51,322 --> 01:23:53,783
We'll stretch them right here

898
01:23:59,205 --> 01:24:01,291
Green 95!

899
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:05,462
Green

900
01:24:07,672 --> 01:24:08,965
95!

901
01:24:09,299 --> 01:24:10,383
What the hell?

902
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,271
Start the ball! Get the ball off!

903
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:27,859
Hold the play clock

904
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:37,035
Start the ball on the play clock

905
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:48,880
False start on the offense

906
01:24:49,172 --> 01:24:53,885
Number 72, number 77, number 60

907
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:57,597
number 61 , number 87 and number 53

908
01:24:57,889 --> 01:24:59,391
Five yards

909
01:24:59,683 --> 01:25:02,060
Still first down

910
01:25:02,644 --> 01:25:07,607
That's bullshit! The one girl slapped
the other girl on the ass, Jimmy

911
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:09,109
you're killing me!

912
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:13,113
you want to see mine?
I got something for you

913
01:25:22,747 --> 01:25:25,250
Here we go Don't throw it!

914
01:25:36,428 --> 01:25:38,888
Damn it! They did it again!

915
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:43,393
Ray Smith with the interception.

916
01:25:43,935 --> 01:25:46,396
First down, Washington.

917
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:51,735
-Nice going!
-you're killing me!

918
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:54,654
-Defense, get out there!
-Let's go

919
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:01,536
That one's been shaking her ass
for two minutes!

920
01:26:03,955 --> 01:26:05,206
98 Shake

921
01:26:05,206 --> 01:26:06,499
98 Shake!

922
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:14,132
Green 99!

923
01:26:41,951 --> 01:26:43,328
Not bad, Falco

924
01:26:47,749 --> 01:26:50,251
Touchdown, Brian Murphy.

925
01:26:53,129 --> 01:26:57,884
Everybody in the stadium knows
that an onside kick is coming...

926
01:26:58,176 --> 01:27:00,595
... with 55 seconds left on the clock.

927
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:06,518
With just 55 seconds left,
Washington has to recover the ball. ..

928
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:11,481
...call a time-out fast, so Gruff
will have a shot at a field goal.

929
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,491
Big Bateman ends up
with the ball!

930
01:27:21,825 --> 01:27:23,034
Danny, go down!

931
01:27:24,244 --> 01:27:26,496
No one's gonna tackle him.

932
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:28,498
He 's reversing his field!

933
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,042
He forgot the clock's running out.

934
01:27:31,543 --> 01:27:34,421
Well, he's trying to
run out the clock.

935
01:27:35,296 --> 01:27:39,009
Danny, go down!
you're using up the clock!

936
01:27:41,928 --> 01:27:44,014
you won't see that every day

937
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:45,932
Time out! Time out!

938
01:27:46,599 --> 01:27:50,478
Nice hit, Shane! Nice hit

939
01:27:52,814 --> 01:27:54,024
What do you think?

940
01:27:54,649 --> 01:27:57,777
We don't stop the clock, it's over

941
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:09,330
you just hold it, and I'll kick
the bloody piss out of it

942
01:28:12,834 --> 01:28:14,044
What the hell?

943
01:28:14,294 --> 01:28:15,462
What the hell!

944
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:17,839
Field goal!

945
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:32,312
McGinty's gonna let Gruff try
this field goal from 65 yards out!

946
01:28:32,854 --> 01:28:35,315
I don't know if he has enough leg.

947
01:28:35,482 --> 01:28:37,817
I think he's smoking on the field

948
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:40,862
Smoking? I'm sure you
just imagined that.

949
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:45,325
No, I saw the smoke and everything.

950
01:29:00,632 --> 01:29:02,842
Vito! Look who's on TV!

951
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:07,263
He wants to keep his pub,
he's gonna stop blowing some kicks!

952
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:10,684
I'm telling you, that's him

953
01:29:42,924 --> 01:29:46,928
It's straight enough.
If it's got the distance....

954
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:51,641
It has the distance! It's good!
Washington wins!

955
01:29:54,728 --> 01:30:00,400
The 65-yard field goal attempt
is good by Nigel Gruff.

956
01:30:04,195 --> 01:30:10,410
Final score:
Washington 17, San Diego 16.

957
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:22,922
-you the man! you the man!
-Oh, bollocks!

958
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:29,179
Come here!

959
01:30:34,225 --> 01:30:36,686
Sorry, man Sorry, excuse me

960
01:30:37,187 --> 01:30:41,024
All right Good game
We snuck by on that one

961
01:30:41,733 --> 01:30:43,068
-I'll take it
-All right

962
01:30:43,568 --> 01:30:46,696
I'll take it Congrats

963
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:55,455
-What do you think of the new team?
-It's great!

964
01:30:55,538 --> 01:30:57,248
These guys are like us.

965
01:30:57,999 --> 01:31:01,711
This strike ain 't about guys like me.
It's about them superstars...

966
01:31:02,003 --> 01:31:06,758
... who want $8 million instead
of 7. To hell with them.

967
01:31:06,758 --> 01:31:11,721
This is the most fun I've had
in football in years. Go Falco!

968
01:31:13,515 --> 01:31:17,143
All right Let's go, baby, let's go!

969
01:31:17,435 --> 01:31:22,315
-I love you, Annabelle
-I know you do, Alan We're closed

970
01:31:24,275 --> 01:31:25,902
Oh, hey!

971
01:31:26,986 --> 01:31:29,364
-you can come in
-Come on in, buddy!

972
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:31,741

973
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:33,535
Out, out, out!

974
01:31:34,285 --> 01:31:35,495
you're Shane Falco

975
01:31:36,788 --> 01:31:40,917
-Way to go you guys kick ass!
-Thanks

976
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:45,505
-Way to go
-Bye! Take care

977
01:31:46,798 --> 01:31:48,008
Hi

978
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,471
Sure it's okay? I don't want to get
you in trouble with your boss

979
01:31:56,182 --> 01:31:58,435
No, she won't mind

980
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:01,146
Come on in you want a beer?

981
01:32:01,813 --> 01:32:03,023
Sure

982
01:32:04,524 --> 01:32:09,279
So, we were so tight
We had so much fun in here

983
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:13,450
Since I was five years old,
I been sitting on those stools

984
01:32:15,618 --> 01:32:19,706
And then after he died, I took over

985
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:23,251
Is that you and him?

986
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,048
yeah

987
01:32:29,466 --> 01:32:33,053
He was the biggest Washington fan
you have ever seen

988
01:32:33,303 --> 01:32:38,224
Other kids got bedtime stories,
I got football stories

989
01:32:43,229 --> 01:32:45,690
He used to talk all the time

990
01:32:45,982 --> 01:32:49,986
about the glory days of football

991
01:32:50,612 --> 01:32:52,572
Said how they were

992
01:32:53,114 --> 01:32:55,075
gone forever

993
01:32:57,577 --> 01:33:00,622
I wish he was here
to see you guys play

994
01:33:03,124 --> 01:33:05,585
-I don't know about that
-I do

995
01:33:05,835 --> 01:33:07,212
Good game today

996
01:33:08,129 --> 01:33:09,339
Thanks

997
01:33:25,897 --> 01:33:27,649
It's late

998
01:33:28,692 --> 01:33:30,610
yeah

999
01:33:34,406 --> 01:33:36,116
Us babies need our rest

1000
01:33:36,908 --> 01:33:38,284
yeah, you do

1001
01:33:38,576 --> 01:33:43,123
Between the guys on the field
and the guys in the bar

1002
01:33:43,248 --> 01:33:45,750
a girl's gotta keep her guard up

1003
01:33:46,376 --> 01:33:48,128
yeah, I imagine

1004
01:33:48,211 --> 01:33:49,879
yeah

1005
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:55,969
you coming to the game on Sunday?

1006
01:33:56,219 --> 01:33:59,389
No, we don't travel with the team

1007
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:06,938
Can I see you when I get back?

1008
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:11,901
Sure

1009
01:34:17,574 --> 01:34:19,743
Good night, Annabelle

1010
01:34:21,953 --> 01:34:23,163
Good night

1011
01:35:20,762 --> 01:35:24,808
-What do you do here, John?
-You go for it. You have to.

1012
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:30,814
But Falco's been shut down
by this defense all afternoon.

1013
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:38,321
But I'll tell you this,
all it takes...

1014
01:35:38,613 --> 01:35:43,243
...is one big play to get him
back in the ball game.

1015
01:35:46,287 --> 01:35:49,499
And here goes Falco.

1016
01:36:02,178 --> 01:36:06,016
Falco scores! Falco scores!

1017
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:18,570
Here's Falco He'll try to reverse
pivot, turn and pitch out here

1018
01:36:18,903 --> 01:36:23,950
But in doing so, his left guard,
Andre Jackson, is going to pull

1019
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:28,288
and Falco will hit him with
the ball in the back

1020
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:31,458
Then it's gonna flop
around the ground

1021
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:36,087
Here comes Cochran, he'll kick it
Franklin's gonna pick it up

1022
01:36:36,379 --> 01:36:39,549
Franklin's gonna get hit right here

1023
01:36:40,842 --> 01:36:45,930
The ball will go flying in the air
Falco will pick it up

1024
01:36:46,222 --> 01:36:49,851
and the guy who started the play,
Falco

1025
01:36:50,143 --> 01:36:53,563
will end up with it
in the end zone for a touchdown!

1026
01:36:53,855 --> 01:36:57,525
-Welcome to strike football
-And the fabulous Falco

1027
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,028
If they can win against Dallas...

1028
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:05,867
...they'll do what Washington
hasn't done in over seven years:

1029
01:37:05,867 --> 01:37:07,077
Get to the playoffs.

1030
01:37:20,882 --> 01:37:22,092
Call time out! Time out!

1031
01:37:22,384 --> 01:37:23,510
Time out!

1032
01:37:24,636 --> 01:37:27,222
Time out Washington.

1033
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:30,850
Franklin, come here,

1034
01:37:30,934 --> 01:37:32,102

Shut up Give me the Stick-Em

1036
01:37:37,315 --> 01:37:40,860
-That's illegal
-Think you'll go to football jail?

1037
01:37:41,444 --> 01:37:44,614
Now, you know this don't look natural

1038
01:37:44,739 --> 01:37:49,619
Don't talk We'll run the same play
you'll catch the ball

1039
01:37:50,203 --> 01:37:52,706
I look like I jacked off
an elephant!

1040
01:37:53,415 --> 01:37:54,666
Say you understand

1041
01:37:55,917 --> 01:37:57,127
I understand

1042
01:37:57,335 --> 01:38:01,256
Go out there and catch the ball
for a change, all right?

1043
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:12,892
Damn! This cup is stuck!

1044
01:38:13,727 --> 01:38:16,354

you can do this

1049
01:38:31,244 --> 01:38:33,413
It's one on one Ready?

1050
01:38:44,716 --> 01:38:46,426
Ready!

1051
01:38:46,718 --> 01:38:48,595
Blue 89!

1052
01:38:48,887 --> 01:38:50,930
Blue 89!

1053
01:39:11,284 --> 01:39:13,703
And Franklin catches the ball!

1054
01:39:13,995 --> 01:39:17,582
Who would've thought?
He never catches a ball.

1055
01:39:17,832 --> 01:39:19,876
But he caught the ball!

1056
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:23,505
That makes the score 21 to 20.

1057
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:28,510
Conventional wisdom says kick
the extra point, tie the game...

1058
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:32,764
...and go into overtime. Especially
with the playoffs on the line.

1059
01:39:33,014 --> 01:39:37,936
But Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy

1060
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,397
And McGinty says go for it

1061
01:39:41,022 --> 01:39:42,565
Let's go for the win!

1062
01:39:44,818 --> 01:39:47,821
I need a receiver!

1063
01:39:48,655 --> 01:39:52,492
4-22 y Cross, okay?
We gotta have it, gotta have it!

1064
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,503
Ready? Go! Ready!

1065
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:14,180
This kind of situation has not been
Falco's strong point in the past.

1066
01:40:14,806 --> 01:40:17,434
Falco rolls to his left and throws...

1067
01:40:19,144 --> 01:40:22,564
...right into the defender's hands.

1068
01:40:22,856 --> 01:40:27,694
And he drops it right into the unsure
hands of Clifford Franklin!

1069
01:40:27,986 --> 01:40:29,821
Washington wins!

1070
01:40:29,821 --> 01:40:34,784
What a lucky break for Shane Falco,
who threw a bad pass...

1071
01:40:35,035 --> 01:40:37,996
that could've blown the game
for Washington

1072
01:40:57,390 --> 01:40:59,100
Get over it

1073
01:40:59,392 --> 01:41:01,144
It's a win

1074
01:41:02,354 --> 01:41:04,189
Better lucky than good?

1075
01:41:04,856 --> 01:41:06,191
Right

1076
01:41:16,868 --> 01:41:18,661
Shane Falco

1077
01:41:18,912 --> 01:41:22,332
-Great game out there today
-Thanks

1078
01:41:22,457 --> 01:41:27,504
To what do you attribute this team's
sudden rise over these past few weeks?

1079
01:41:27,837 --> 01:41:32,550
you know, you should talk to Franklin
He's the hero today

1080
01:41:33,843 --> 01:41:36,346
Clifford Franklin
Terrific day today

1081
01:41:36,638 --> 01:41:40,016
yeah, today was a good day
for Clifford Franklin

1082
01:41:40,308 --> 01:41:42,894
Clifford Franklin can't wait
till tomorrow

1083
01:41:43,645 --> 01:41:46,523
Clifford Franklin gets
better looking every day

1084
01:41:47,857 --> 01:41:52,570
We're beginning to scratch the surface
of the talents of Clifford Franklin

1085
01:41:52,862 --> 01:41:56,825
Clifford Franklin has moves even
Clifford Franklin ain't seen yet

1086
01:41:57,909 --> 01:42:01,413
you showed us a few moves
today against Phoenix

1087
01:42:01,705 --> 01:42:04,874
but it could be a different story
against Dallas

1088
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:07,961
That's the same story,
different chapter

1089
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:13,049
The football is like a one-man cold
to Clifford Franklin

1090
01:42:13,675 --> 01:42:18,638
Clifford Franklin's the only one
catching it and coming down with it

1091
01:42:27,856 --> 01:42:29,357
Cheers, babe

1092
01:42:29,941 --> 01:42:32,402
I think we got it

1093
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:50,628
-What are you up to?
-What?

1094
01:42:51,212 --> 01:42:55,258
I can't get excited about
the future of my team?

1095
01:42:57,469 --> 01:43:01,222
Okay, okay, I got some great news

1096
01:43:01,222 --> 01:43:05,101
Martel and Carr have crossed
the picket line

1097
01:43:06,227 --> 01:43:10,106
With a deal I made them swallow,
I can't not take them back

1098
01:43:10,648 --> 01:43:12,442
No

1099
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:14,361
No what?

1100
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:17,864
I'm sticking with Falco

1101
01:43:18,156 --> 01:43:20,367
Jimmy, come on

1102
01:43:21,242 --> 01:43:22,994
Have you read the newspaper?

1103
01:43:24,996 --> 01:43:28,708
The entire Dallas team has crossed
the picket line

1104
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:31,795
Thanksgiving night we play
the world champions

1105
01:43:32,712 --> 01:43:36,591
We have a deal
No interference with my coaching

1106
01:43:36,883 --> 01:43:40,512
As long as the strike is on,
Falco is my quarterback

1107
01:43:41,262 --> 01:43:44,474
We have to beat Dallas
to get into the playoffs

1108
01:43:45,308 --> 01:43:48,978
Falco can't do that
you saw what happened yesterday

1109
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:51,481
Jesus Christ!

1110
01:43:51,856 --> 01:43:56,277
Do you think he'll have
that luck against Dallas too?

1111
01:43:56,277 --> 01:43:59,489
-They'll murder him!
-He's just getting his game back

1112
01:44:00,031 --> 01:44:02,826
He falls apart when the game
is on the line!

1113
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:06,246
That's been his rap
ever since the Sugar Bowl

1114
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:13,962
21 other men put their faith in you to
lead them They'd be heartbroken

1115
01:44:14,337 --> 01:44:18,758
if you abandoned them before
the biggest game of their lives

1116
01:44:21,845 --> 01:44:25,390
you really are a son of a bitch,
you know that?

1117
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:37,819
What are you doing?

1118
01:44:38,111 --> 01:44:41,281
Don't want to make the same mistake
I did in Phoenix

1119
01:44:41,489 --> 01:44:44,409
We might end up in that situation
with Dallas

1120
01:44:45,827 --> 01:44:48,788
They like to send their safeties

1121
01:44:50,498 --> 01:44:51,916
put the pressure on

1122
01:44:53,835 --> 01:44:55,086
yeah, coach?

1123
01:44:56,546 --> 01:44:58,173
It's over

1124
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,091
Martel crossed

1125
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:07,557
I'm sorry

1126
01:45:26,451 --> 01:45:30,288
''Chokes with the game on the line''
ls that what O'Neil said?

1127
01:45:40,382 --> 01:45:42,008
It's okay

1128
01:45:43,093 --> 01:45:45,095
It's better for the team, right?

1129
01:45:45,845 --> 01:45:47,847
I mean, Martel

1130
01:45:48,973 --> 01:45:52,644
he is the best
The guy's got it all

1131
01:45:53,103 --> 01:45:55,105
No

1132
01:45:56,398 --> 01:45:58,358
He doesn't have heart

1133
01:46:01,403 --> 01:46:02,654
you do

1134
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:11,371
It's been a privilege

1135
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:15,417
Thanks for believing

1136
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:33,977
you give them hell on Thursday

1137
01:47:07,886 --> 01:47:11,639
I just wanted to tell you
before you left

1138
01:47:13,516 --> 01:47:15,185
I'm sorry

1139
01:47:15,852 --> 01:47:18,229
-Thanks
-No, really

1140
01:47:19,356 --> 01:47:22,692
I think it's terrible
what they do to you guys

1141
01:47:26,488 --> 01:47:30,825
They make you believe that
you're better than you really are

1142
01:47:31,493 --> 01:47:33,953
Then they pull the rug
out from under you

1143
01:47:37,123 --> 01:47:41,628
The cruelest thing that they can give
guys like you

1144
01:47:42,754 --> 01:47:43,963
is hope

1145
01:47:51,012 --> 01:47:54,140
you're a real class act, Martel

1146
01:47:56,518 --> 01:47:58,978
A real class act

1147
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:02,774
She deserves better

1148
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:09,239
you're a sinking ship
Don't drag her down with you

1149
01:48:12,784 --> 01:48:15,245
Take care of my guys

1150
01:48:20,291 --> 01:48:22,168
Come on, boys, let's go!

1151
01:48:23,253 --> 01:48:26,756
Nothing but water left in here
Let's go

1152
01:48:27,007 --> 01:48:29,050
I have a date

1153
01:48:29,342 --> 01:48:34,055
-But I love you, Annabelle
-I know you do, Alan

1154
01:48:34,055 --> 01:48:36,599
Bye, you guys, be careful!

1155
01:49:45,835 --> 01:49:48,004
Here he is!

1156
01:49:48,338 --> 01:49:50,799
Ladies and gentlemen

1157
01:49:51,633 --> 01:49:54,552
number 16 in your programs

1158
01:49:54,803 --> 01:49:58,098
number 1 in your hearts!

1159
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:01,726
Shane Falco!

1160
01:50:05,397 --> 01:50:06,606
Falco! Falco!

1161
01:50:15,532 --> 01:50:17,075
Cheers God bless you

1162
01:50:17,367 --> 01:50:19,119
-Cheers
-Cheers

1163
01:50:30,422 --> 01:50:31,631
Are you all right?

1164
01:50:35,844 --> 01:50:37,303
I'm done

1165
01:50:37,929 --> 01:50:39,139
What?

1166
01:50:39,931 --> 01:50:42,183
Martel crossed

1167
01:50:42,475 --> 01:50:44,185
Bloody hell

1168
01:50:46,229 --> 01:50:48,440
When will you tell the guys?

1169
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:51,776
-I don't want to ruin--
-No, no, wait

1170
01:50:52,444 --> 01:50:57,198
Cut that music! Cut it!
Turn the music off! Cut it!

1171
01:50:57,949 --> 01:51:00,410
Shane's got something to tell you

1172
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:05,957
I've got good news

1173
01:51:07,167 --> 01:51:10,587
This Thursday you'll be with
the best quarterback in the league

1174
01:51:10,837 --> 01:51:13,173
Damn right Damn right

1175
01:51:16,718 --> 01:51:18,303
Martel

1176
01:51:19,304 --> 01:51:20,764
He crossed

1177
01:51:25,935 --> 01:51:27,937
Martel crossed

1178
01:51:33,777 --> 01:51:37,364
While you guys are getting pounded
by Dallas

1179
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:40,450
just kidding

1180
01:51:42,202 --> 01:51:45,455
I'll be drinking beer on my boat

1181
01:51:45,914 --> 01:51:47,957
Kicking back

1182
01:51:51,753 --> 01:51:53,171
Sentinels

1183
01:51:54,255 --> 01:51:56,716
raise your glasses

1184
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:59,386
This is to Shane Falco

1185
01:52:00,887 --> 01:52:02,389
He's our quarterback

1186
01:52:03,223 --> 01:52:05,475
he's our leader

1187
01:52:06,768 --> 01:52:10,480
but most of all, he's our friend
This is for you, man

1188
01:52:11,022 --> 01:52:12,232
To Falco!

1189
01:52:17,195 --> 01:52:19,239
Thanks

1190
01:52:19,531 --> 01:52:21,157
Thanks

1191
01:52:23,118 --> 01:52:24,828
It's been fun

1192
01:54:10,642 --> 01:54:14,396
Welcome back to Nextel Stadium
in our nation's capital.

1193
01:54:14,688 --> 01:54:18,692
I'm Pat Summerall and with me
as always is John Madden

1194
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:23,113
It appears that the strike
is coming to a close

1195
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:26,991
Martel will be resuming
the quarterback position tonight.

1196
01:54:27,283 --> 01:54:32,372
I gotta admit, I was looking forward
to seeing what Falco could do...

1197
01:54:32,664 --> 01:54:38,169
... with one more game. He made
amazing progress the past few weeks...

1198
01:54:38,169 --> 01:54:40,797
...under the tutelage
of Jimmy McGinty.

1199
01:54:41,089 --> 01:54:42,257
He really did.

1200
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:48,138
But tonight it'll be Martel leading
Washington against Dallas.

1201
01:54:59,482 --> 01:55:02,485
I never thought I'd say this, but. ..

1202
01:55:03,194 --> 01:55:06,156
...l'm gonna kind of miss
those replacement games.

1203
01:55:06,448 --> 01:55:08,950
Bring back Falco!

1204
01:55:09,451 --> 01:55:14,414
Ladies and gentlemen, leading
your Washington Sentinels today...

1205
01:55:14,748 --> 01:55:18,835
... welcome back number 7,
Eddie Martel.

1206
01:55:24,466 --> 01:55:25,675
Go on, boys!

1207
01:55:55,163 --> 01:55:58,625
Come on, Martel
Get moving, get moving!

1208
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:02,253
Maybe you should try scrambling

1209
01:56:03,546 --> 01:56:06,007
Brilliant
How about a quick kick?

1210
01:56:28,905 --> 01:56:30,740
Hey, Butler

1211
01:56:34,536 --> 01:56:37,038
-Red 38!
-Hey, man

1212
01:56:37,038 --> 01:56:41,251
If it ain't any trouble,
I'd love to get your autograph after

1213
01:56:41,543 --> 01:56:44,004
you want it, you got it, scab!

1214
01:56:44,546 --> 01:56:45,880
All right

1215
01:57:09,654 --> 01:57:13,533
Cochran fumbles the ball,
Dallas recovers.

1216
01:57:13,825 --> 01:57:17,287
First down and goal
on the two-yard line.

1217
01:57:21,207 --> 01:57:22,625
Hawk Nine Stay!

1218
01:57:23,335 --> 01:57:27,047
Bateman! Hawk Nine Stay!

1219
01:57:27,297 --> 01:57:30,216
Hawk Nine Stay!

1220
01:57:31,593 --> 01:57:33,386
I'm back!

1221
01:57:40,185 --> 01:57:42,395
Touchdown, Dallas.

1222
01:57:47,108 --> 01:57:50,362
They're quitting on you!
They're quitting on you!

1223
01:58:00,872 --> 01:58:02,082
Gold 41 !

1224
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:22,102
Pass to Brian Murphy, incomplete.

1225
01:58:22,811 --> 01:58:24,813
Throw right, you're going left!

1226
01:58:25,105 --> 01:58:27,440
Right, right, right.

1227
01:58:27,732 --> 01:58:30,860
You went left,
I want you to go right!

1228
01:58:32,153 --> 01:58:33,488
No, right!

1229
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,281
Right, you idiot!

1230
01:58:37,784 --> 01:58:40,120
Hey, easy!

1231
01:59:05,812 --> 01:59:09,733
Brian Murphy fumbled the ball.
Dallas recovered.

1232
01:59:14,571 --> 01:59:15,822
Nice hands

1233
01:59:15,822 --> 01:59:18,491
3-2 Magic Wreck, 0

1234
01:59:18,783 --> 01:59:21,244
What the hell was that about?

1235
01:59:39,596 --> 01:59:42,057
Touchdown, Dallas.

1236
02:00:29,646 --> 02:00:32,107
Gruff, wake up!

1237
02:00:44,953 --> 02:00:46,162
What the--?

1238
02:00:46,454 --> 02:00:49,624
Pass incomplete by Eddie Martel.

1239
02:00:56,464 --> 02:00:59,009
What the hell was that?

1240
02:00:59,676 --> 02:01:01,219
I'm talking to you!

1241
02:01:01,469 --> 02:01:03,430
I call the plays on the field

1242
02:01:03,722 --> 02:01:06,558
-That's not how I coach
-I don't give a shit

1243
02:01:07,183 --> 02:01:09,644
because that's the way I play

1244
02:01:10,311 --> 02:01:13,398
That's the end of the first half. ..

1245
02:01:13,523 --> 02:01:16,568
... with a score of Dallas 17,
Washington 0.

1246
02:01:17,193 --> 02:01:17,902
Coach McGinty!

1247
02:01:18,445 --> 02:01:21,281
What will Washington need to get back
into this game?

1248
02:01:23,533 --> 02:01:27,162
-Heart
-I'm sorry?

1249
02:01:27,579 --> 02:01:29,039
you gotta have heart

1250
02:01:29,706 --> 02:01:31,249
Can you elaborate?

1251
02:01:34,919 --> 02:01:36,463
Miles and miles of heart

1252
02:01:38,715 --> 02:01:42,927
There you have it,
in a word, from Coach McGinty...

1253
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:47,307
Washington will need ''heart''
to get back into this--

1254
02:01:52,395 --> 02:01:55,982
I ran it like you said!
you just under threw me!

1255
02:01:55,982 --> 02:02:00,070
This isn't a track meet, asshole
you have to look for the ball!

1256
02:02:01,196 --> 02:02:03,740
I'll pull you off the field,
spoiled punk

1257
02:02:05,992 --> 02:02:11,456
Is O'Neil gonna side with a burnout
coach or someone who delivers the fans?

1258
02:02:12,248 --> 02:02:13,458
Son of a bitch!

1259
02:02:14,834 --> 02:02:18,672
What are you thinking about?
We got a game to play!

1260
02:02:18,963 --> 02:02:21,633
-Nobody can win with these losers!
-I can

1261
02:02:27,263 --> 02:02:30,517
Falco, great to see you Now, get
the hell out of my locker room!

1262
02:02:31,476 --> 02:02:33,770
-Coach?
-What took you so long?

1263
02:02:34,771 --> 02:02:35,980
Traffic

1264
02:02:37,273 --> 02:02:38,483
Suit up!

1265
02:02:41,611 --> 02:02:44,989
-O'Neil will fire your ass!
-Won't be the first time!

1266
02:02:45,281 --> 02:02:48,535
This is bullshit!
I'll end this right now

1267
02:02:48,535 --> 02:02:50,328
Come and get some!

1268
02:02:55,458 --> 02:02:57,669
you big fatty!

1269
02:03:07,762 --> 02:03:09,764
This doesn't change anything

1270
02:03:09,889 --> 02:03:12,809
I'm an All-Pro quarterback!
I got two Super Bowl rings!

1271
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:16,021
you're no more than a replacement

1272
02:03:16,312 --> 02:03:17,772
yeah

1273
02:03:19,816 --> 02:03:21,776
I can live with that

1274
02:03:24,821 --> 02:03:28,783
My brothers, will somebody please get
this asshole out of here?

1275
02:03:31,077 --> 02:03:33,538
Get your hands off me, you gorilla!

1276
02:03:46,384 --> 02:03:51,056
Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy

1277
02:03:51,431 --> 02:03:56,102
And McGinty says, with the playoffs
on the line, go for it.

1278
02:03:56,102 --> 02:03:59,022
Get to the playoffs.
Something Washington...

1279
02:03:59,356 --> 02:04:03,568
...has not been able to do
against Dallas in seven years.

1280
02:04:21,628 --> 02:04:23,088
Falco?

1281
02:04:25,298 --> 02:04:27,676
What the hell is he up to?

1282
02:04:28,635 --> 02:04:31,388
Look, here comes Falco!
Falco's back!

1283
02:04:31,888 --> 02:04:33,598
What happened to Martel?

1284
02:04:33,807 --> 02:04:36,434
I don't know,
but the way Falco's running...

1285
02:04:36,726 --> 02:04:41,272
...and that look he has in his eye,
he thinks he's gonna play.

1286
02:04:46,945 --> 02:04:48,113
I'm sorry

1287
02:04:50,615 --> 02:04:53,952
They're playing zone
and you can pick them apart

1288
02:04:54,244 --> 02:04:56,329
if you keep your eyes open--

1289
02:04:56,621 --> 02:05:02,377
He seems to be necking with that
cheerleader! That's what he's doing!

1290
02:05:03,670 --> 02:05:07,549
Players aren't supposed to be
fraternizing with cheerleaders.

1291
02:05:07,882 --> 02:05:11,177
yeah, but what are they gonna do?
Fire him?

1292
02:05:11,928 --> 02:05:14,889
-you give me strength
-you're late for work

1293
02:05:17,934 --> 02:05:19,394
Kick ass, Falco!

1294
02:05:23,690 --> 02:05:27,402
What's all the celebrating about?
We're down 17 to nothing

1295
02:05:27,819 --> 02:05:29,946
It's nasty out there

1296
02:05:29,946 --> 02:05:32,824
That's why girls
don't play the game, coach

1297
02:05:33,116 --> 02:05:38,663
Listen up This time tomorrow,
the strike will be officially over

1298
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:43,710
Dallas made a big mistake
They haven't been afraid of you

1299
02:05:43,710 --> 02:05:47,672
They should be, because you have
a powerful weapon working for you

1300
02:05:47,922 --> 02:05:50,508
There is no tomorrow for you

1301
02:05:51,217 --> 02:05:53,970
And that makes you all
very dangerous people!

1302
02:06:03,188 --> 02:06:04,939
Kick ass on one Ready?

1303
02:06:15,575 --> 02:06:19,371
Clifford Franklin is
looking for a new ho

1304
02:06:20,622 --> 02:06:22,624
Ready for some pain?

1305
02:06:22,916 --> 02:06:25,543
-Bring it on
-It's coming

1306
02:06:26,252 --> 02:06:27,837
It's coming

1307
02:06:28,088 --> 02:06:30,256
See him coming in motion?

1308
02:06:35,470 --> 02:06:37,681
I've never seen anything like this!

1309
02:06:37,972 --> 02:06:39,391
Unbelievable!

1310
02:06:41,267 --> 02:06:45,647
There's at least five, six flags
out there. Hats, everything!

1311
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:48,983
This is what you call
an old-fashioned melee

1312
02:06:49,275 --> 02:06:53,154
Unnecessary roughness,
number 16 and number 34

1313
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:56,825
Fifteen yards, so that's, wait

1314
02:06:57,534 --> 02:06:59,994
4530

1315
02:07:03,873 --> 02:07:06,292
How many yards so far?

1316
02:07:06,292 --> 02:07:09,004
Who do they think
they're playing here?

1317
02:07:17,554 --> 02:07:19,222
Come on, let's go! Come on!

1318
02:07:51,671 --> 02:07:52,756
My knee!

1319
02:07:53,965 --> 02:07:55,133
It's my knee!

1320
02:08:00,263 --> 02:08:02,557
I think I broke it

1321
02:08:08,146 --> 02:08:10,106
Did I do it? Did I score?

1322
02:08:10,106 --> 02:08:13,318
-yeah, you did it
-God, it hurts It hurts!

1323
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:15,111
I'm sorry

1324
02:08:15,111 --> 02:08:19,199
Don't be sorry Going out in front
of 80,000 people ain't bad

1325
02:08:21,368 --> 02:08:24,120
you finish what you started

1326
02:08:31,378 --> 02:08:33,129
White 24!

1327
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:56,403
Blue 15! Hut, hut!

1328
02:09:32,689 --> 02:09:35,150
First down, Washington.

1329
02:09:38,278 --> 02:09:40,947
-Good job
-I got skills

1330
02:09:41,448 --> 02:09:45,160
-Feel like running the ball?
-Better give it to Wilkinson

1331
02:09:46,453 --> 02:09:47,662
He's going to jail

1332
02:09:48,955 --> 02:09:52,667
-I'll clear the way
-I'm right behind you

1333
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:55,754
We need it, we need it!

1334
02:10:11,478 --> 02:10:16,441
A gain of 20 yards by Ray Smith.
First down.

1335
02:10:24,616 --> 02:10:27,786
I know you're tired,
I know you're hurting

1336
02:10:28,078 --> 02:10:31,664
I wish I could say something
classy and inspirational

1337
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:33,958
But it wouldn't be our style

1338
02:10:37,128 --> 02:10:38,963
Pain heals

1339
02:10:39,255 --> 02:10:41,466
Chicks dig scars

1340
02:10:41,925 --> 02:10:45,220
Glory lasts forever

1341
02:10:45,303 --> 02:10:46,763
Right on, Shane

1342
02:10:47,055 --> 02:10:50,225
Right on, baby Right on!

1343
02:10:50,433 --> 02:10:52,852
Shotgun DC Right

1344
02:10:53,144 --> 02:10:56,940
Flip 90 Dig, on the center Ready?

1345
02:11:17,002 --> 02:11:21,506
We 're looking at a different team
here in the second half.

1346
02:11:21,673 --> 02:11:26,678
Absolutely. Washington is playing
like there's no tomorrow...

1347
02:11:27,012 --> 02:11:29,014
because there isn't

1348
02:11:30,306 --> 02:11:32,225
Touchdown, baby!

1349
02:11:32,809 --> 02:11:34,019
Son of a bitch!

1350
02:11:36,688 --> 02:11:39,399
Odd bullets, blitz coverage!

1351
02:11:51,745 --> 02:11:56,082
Daniel Bateman comes up with
a big stop on third and one.

1352
02:11:56,583 --> 02:11:57,876
That forces a Dallas punt.

1353
02:11:58,209 --> 02:12:04,341
Pat, with 28 seconds remaining,
Washington needs a decent return...

1354
02:12:04,841 --> 02:12:09,054
...in order to give Gruff
a shot to tie the game.

1355
02:12:37,916 --> 02:12:40,335
With 12 seconds remaining...

1356
02:12:40,543 --> 02:12:43,588
-It's yours, Nigel
-...a 32-yard field goal. ..

1357
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:46,633
... will send this game into overtime.

1358
02:12:46,633 --> 02:12:49,844
32 yards is just
a chip shot for Gruff

1359
02:13:10,407 --> 02:13:11,616
you all right?

1360
02:13:13,576 --> 02:13:14,911
I'm sorry

1361
02:13:15,412 --> 02:13:19,124
I had the money but I pissed it
away at the track again

1362
02:13:19,207 --> 02:13:22,085
What? What are you talking about?

1363
02:13:22,377 --> 02:13:24,546
They'll take my pub away from me

1364
02:13:24,838 --> 02:13:26,923
It's all I got

1365
02:13:27,924 --> 02:13:29,843
Come on, Shane!

1366
02:13:46,109 --> 02:13:49,904
It's a fake! Falco still has it!
He 's running with it!

1367
02:14:01,708 --> 02:14:04,169
Touchdown, Falco!

1368
02:14:20,977 --> 02:14:24,731
Holding! Number 68 on the offense

1369
02:14:25,482 --> 02:14:28,443
10-yard penalty Repeat first down

1370
02:14:28,735 --> 02:14:30,862
What a terrible call!

1371
02:14:31,154 --> 02:14:32,989
Time out!

1372
02:14:37,202 --> 02:14:40,497
-you okay?
-I broke my arm

1373
02:14:41,247 --> 02:14:43,333
Cheers you saved my ass

1374
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:45,460
Take care

1375
02:14:45,794 --> 02:14:49,214
you'll have to explain to me
what that was about

1376
02:14:51,758 --> 02:14:52,967
What's it gonna be?

1377
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:55,929
I want the ball

1378
02:14:57,263 --> 02:14:59,224
Winners always do

1379
02:15:00,517 --> 02:15:02,268
Spread formation

1380
02:15:11,945 --> 02:15:13,488
Damn!

1381
02:15:22,205 --> 02:15:25,542
Sorry, Shane I'm sorry, everybody

1382
02:15:25,542 --> 02:15:29,254
No problem Just rip
someone's head off on this one

1383
02:15:29,337 --> 02:15:30,672
Consider it done

1384
02:15:30,964 --> 02:15:35,885
All right So besides me,
who really wants the ball?

1385
02:15:38,054 --> 02:15:39,681
yeah, you want it, Brian

1386
02:15:40,056 --> 02:15:44,728
Let's hook up
DC left, wide motion, 88 War

1387
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:46,771
Gentlemen

1388
02:15:51,818 --> 02:15:55,905
It's been an honor to share
the field of battle with you

1389
02:16:30,148 --> 02:16:31,900
We ain't losing this game

1390
02:16:58,593 --> 02:16:59,761
Green 86!

1391
02:17:06,184 --> 02:17:08,520
Green 86!

1392
02:17:53,356 --> 02:17:56,901
Touchdown, Brian Murphy!

1393
02:17:58,194 --> 02:18:03,199
I knew it! I knew it all along!

1394
02:18:03,199 --> 02:18:07,454
Jimmy, you beautiful son of a bitch!
I knew you could do it!

1395
02:18:08,204 --> 02:18:13,168
Final score:
Washington 20, Dallas 17.

1396
02:18:13,293 --> 02:18:17,422
Washington goes to the playoffs!

1397
02:18:29,476 --> 02:18:30,685
you did it!

1398
02:18:32,687 --> 02:18:33,855
you did it!

1399
02:19:57,856 --> 02:20:03,278
When the replacement players
for the Sentinels left the stadium...

1400
02:20:03,570 --> 02:20:06,031
...there was no ticker-tape parade...

1401
02:20:06,322 --> 02:20:09,534
...no endorsement deals
for sneakers...

1402
02:20:09,701 --> 02:20:13,288
...or soda pop or breakfast cereal.

1403
02:20:13,496 --> 02:20:16,499
Just a locker to be cleaned out. ..

1404
02:20:17,083 --> 02:20:19,544
...and a ride home to catch.

1405
02:20:19,711 --> 02:20:22,088
But what they didn't know...

1406
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:25,800
... was that their lives
would be changed forever...

1407
02:20:26,092 --> 02:20:29,637
...because they had been
part of something great.

1408
02:20:30,221 --> 02:20:33,933
And greatness, no matter how brief. ..

1409
02:20:34,601 --> 02:20:37,062
...stays with a man.

1410
02:20:37,312 --> 02:20:40,899
Every athlete dreams
of a second chance.

1411
02:20:44,027 --> 02:20:46,446
These men lived it.
