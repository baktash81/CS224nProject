1
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,122
My whole life, it was obvious

2
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,958
I was gonna end up in this city.

3
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,692
I don't want to be arrogant here,
but I'm an incredibly attractive man.

4
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,535
I can't help it.
I don't try to be. I just am.

5
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,334
When I was a kid, my mother's
best friend used to tell me

6
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,709
that I was gonna be
a little heartbreaker.

7
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,714
Turns out she was right.

8
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,375
Her husband came home
from work one day

9
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,976
and found us fucking
on the Stairmaster.

10
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,181
Los Angeles, California.

11
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,021
That's where all the beautiful little
heartbreakers go to live and dream.

12
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:36,358
30,000 of them arrive here
every single month.

13
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,921
30,000 prom kings
and queens

14
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,830
and Little Miss Cute Tits,

15
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,698
every one of them
with stars in their eyes

16
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,532
and a dream in their heart.

17
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,039
When I first came out here,
I had a dream...

18
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,007
a dream of an easy life.

19
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,237
I was gonna get rich
from lyin' around

20
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,211
having my picture taken.

21
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,807
I was gonna live in the hills
and drive a noisy yellow sports car

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,650
and fuck 6' girls
who weighed 89 lbs.

23
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,781
Guess what? Most of it came true.

24
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,871
Hey, handsome!

25
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,171
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

26
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,378
- Excuse me.
- What's up?

27
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,277
Good to see you.

28
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,408
- You're here a little early, man.
- Well, you know, a boy's gotta eat.

29
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,286
# I don't wanna tell you #

30
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,350
# 'Cause you're lookin'
that way #

31
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,488
# Turn around and wonder
how you keep up #

32
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,794
# With things that
I don't want to tell you #

33
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,096
# 'Cause you're lookin'
that way #

34
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,467
# Turn around and wonder
how you keep up #

35
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,301
# With things that
I don't... #

36
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,637
Some men remember breast feeding.

37
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,836
I do not.

38
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,107
I do remember seeing
my mother in the shower once.

39
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,138
She had a giant
mound of pubic hair.

40
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,650
It caused me an aversion
to all things untrimmed.

41
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,815
Ah. Meet Jen.
She has a bush like the outback.

42
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,457
Strong hands though.
I like that.

43
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,053
Let's see.

44
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,587
Ah, Shelly.

45
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,260
Ladies, if you want tits,
go to Canada.

46
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,759
They just do 'em better up there.
Don't ask me why.

47
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,970
I don't remember her name.
But I do remember the look on her face

48
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,706
when she found out I was
also sleeping with her sister.

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,281
But tonight I'm not looking
for the tight skin of a 20-year-old.

50
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,184
I am in need of assiduation
and that changes the game.

51
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,916
Ah, here we go.

52
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,447
The jacket's Dolce,
the jeans are by Helmut Lang

53
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,154
and the complexion comes
from a strict regimen of facials.

54
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,494
I'm guessing
she drives a Mercedes.

55
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,226
By the way,
there's only one pick-up line.

56
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,894
Everything else is cheese.

57
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,199
Hi. What's your name?

58
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,565
- Samantha.
- Hi, Samantha.

59
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,132
I'm Nikki.

60
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,770
- I'm leaving.
- Really?

61
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,178
Why?

62
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,376
- It's late.
- You're right.

63
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,975
We should get going.

64
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,611
So wait a second.
You had dinner here?

65
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,679
What'd you have?

66
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,212
I had a salad.

67
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,283
- What kind of salad?
- A Greek salad.

68
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,557
You had a Greek salad
at a French restaurant?

69
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,928
I like that.
Oh. Valet, huh?

70
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,433
I bet you're a bad driver.
You want me to drive?

71
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,957
I'll flip you for it. Here.

72
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,266
Heads, I drive;
tails, you drive.

73
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,538
- There it is.
- It's tails. You flipped it.

74
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,770
You always flip it.
Don't be a sore loser.

75
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,046
Look, you're cute and everything,

76
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,914
but you're not coming home with me.
Thank you.

77
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,317
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

78
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,754
"You're cute and everything"?
What is that?

79
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,587
I was trying not to be rude.

80
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,320
- You're far from rude.
- Aww.

81
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,260
I'll help you out.

82
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,162
Tell me that you're married.

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,092
I am not married.
That would be a lie.

84
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,296
You're not.

85
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,568
Tell me that you're madly in love
with someone.

86
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,939
- That would also be a lie.
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,108
Then tell me why I can't
come home with you.

88
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,608
I don't know you.

89
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,926
Roll the windows down,
turn the music up

90
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,955
and make an ass out of yourself.

91
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,489
It puts them at ease.

92
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,769
It's nice.

93
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,142
Peter Bogdanovich
used to live here.

94
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,443
Hmm. I bet he did.

95
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,074
What's that supposed to mean?

96
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,812
Never show you're impressed.

97
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,581
It lowers your market value.

98
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,088
Do you want a drink?

99
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,647
I don't drink.

100
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,967
Come here.

101
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,850
Wait.

102
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,549
No boots in the bed.

103
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,616
It's my bed.

104
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,920
The boots go or I go.

105
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,029
You want to give them a good fucking,

106
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:24,201
but not too good. Leave a little
room for the relationship to grow.

107
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,477
Oh, this fucking...

108
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,885
Hey, Nikki.

109
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,083
Nikki, wake up.
I gotta go to work.

110
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,183
Now pay very close attention.

111
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,718
I call this the "roll over
sleeping smile."

112
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,206
- Right here is fine.
- There?

113
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,042
Yeah.

114
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,341
Nice spread, man.

115
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,215
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

116
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,815
Hey, do you keep
these cards on file?

117
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,793
Yeah, we can.

118
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,888
It doesn't matter
if you can cook or not.

119
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,593
Women grade on effort. It's almost
better when the meal's a flop.

120
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,692
It shows that you're willing
to make a fool of yourself.

121
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,063
It's all about creating equity.

122
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,800
Think of it as a point system.

123
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,276
One for flowers, two for dinner,
three for an orgasm.

124
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,644
You need 26 points
for them to trust you.

125
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,649
And then you can go back
to watching football.

126
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,316
- Hello?
- In here.

127
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,515
Oh ho ho, you're still here.

128
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,994
And you're cooking.

129
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,190
- I'm trying.
- Hmm.

130
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,597
Turn around.

131
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,192
Here you go.

132
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,795
Sit down...
and take off your shoes.

133
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,738
I'm gonna go pour you
a glass of wine.

134
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,537
Here's what she doesn't know...

135
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,271
I'm homeless, carless

136
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,211
and completely unreliable.

137
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,111
I do, however,
own a cell phone

138
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,946
that happens to be
right in front of her.

139
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,819
That's right, baby. 19 other offers
and I'm here with you

140
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,948
creating equity.

141
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,358
So what do you do?

142
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,123
What?

143
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,088
For work?

144
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,724
Do you have a job?

145
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,293
No.

146
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,004
What did you do today?

147
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,531
I was here today.

148
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,203
Yesterday...

149
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,075
what did you do yesterday?

150
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,143
Yesterday.

151
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,948
Yesterday, I woke up,

152
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,387
I got a cup of coffee,

153
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,254
I had something to eat,

154
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,953
and then I went outside
to see what it was like.

155
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,894
And what was it like?

156
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,190
It was nice.

157
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,940
Have you ever had a job?

158
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,743
Yes.

159
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,744
What sort of job?

160
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,272
You know...

161
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,943
jobs on lakes,

162
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,613
jobs on water.

163
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,281
Job-jobs.

164
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,255
Are you looking
for a job right now?

165
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,818
Not right now.

166
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,921
- No?
- No.

167
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,432
Right now,
I'm having dinner with you.

168
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,107
Is that it?

169
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,176
# Fire #

170
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,655
# Me and old Ricardo #

171
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,056
# We're swooping
down to town #

172
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,254
# We're coming
round your way #

173
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,820
# Tonight #

174
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,264
# So open up your eyes #

175
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,495
# Then pull back the skies #

176
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,561
# 'Cause we are
coming round #

177
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,196
# Kick it #

178
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,301
# That's right... #

179
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,335
That's a lot.

180
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,759
# That's right. #

181
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,595
Just rack up those points until...

182
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,004
I'm going to New York
for a few days.

183
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,806
I thought you might
want to come.

184
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,478
I can't.

185
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,017
You want to stay here.

186
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,224
Do you want me to stay here?

187
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,266
Yeah, I do.

188
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,503
Then I'll stay.

189
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,946
I have my cell.
I'll leave it on.

190
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,957
Okay.

191
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,517
- Thursday morning you'll pick me up?
- Of course.

192
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,034
- You have a safe flight.
- I hope so.

193
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,052
# Been so long
since you told me #

194
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:28,092
# Been so long since
you told me #

195
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:28,868
# Been so long
since you told me #

196
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,597
# Been so long
since you told me #

197
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,529
# Been so long
since you told me... #

198
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,803
Hey!

199
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,833
I don't like you two
talking to each other.

200
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,743
I do not like you two
talking to each other.

201
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,440
This is bad.

202
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,712
Stop! Stop!

203
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,277
- God.
- How do you like my new house?

204
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,755
You think any girls are gonna
believe this is your house?

205
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,418
The young ones do.
Oh FYI, I'm a graphic designer

206
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,087
if anybody asks.

207
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,154
What? What happened?

208
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,756
- I blew it.
- With who?

209
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,461
- El Paso Erin.
- That DJ girl?

210
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,902
No, that's Hi-fi Tara.
No El Paso's a somatologist.

211
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,565
- She's...
- That's...

212
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,267
I fuckin' froze up.
I couldn't say anything.

213
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,208
l... I started making
cricket noises.

214
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,040
You know what your problem is?
You care too much.

215
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,309
You gotta cut out
the conversation, right?

216
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,782
And just like say something
to piss 'em off.

217
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,512
- Why?
- 'Cause once you piss 'em off,

218
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,349
you set up the apology.

219
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,652
And once you apologize,
you look like a sensitive guy.

220
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,180
I am a sensitive guy.

221
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,817
All right, but you've
gotta look like a rebel

222
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,693
before you look
like a sensitive guy.

223
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,190
- Is that Helen?
- Oh!

224
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,095
- Who invited her?
- I don't know.

225
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,195
- I didn't fucking invite her.
- She's gonna tell people

226
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,672
- it's not my house.
- Hey, Nikki.

227
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,699
- Hi.
- Yeah, I heard you were having a party

228
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,177
so I thought I'd just
stop by and say hi,

229
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,009
see where you landed.

230
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,211
Yeah, not bad.
Not... not bad at all.

231
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,778
- So, you want to go swimming?
- Oh whoa!

232
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,483
Helen, uh, just...

233
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,355
Okay, we gotta get her out of here.

234
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,916
- You gotta take her home.
- What?!

235
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,055
Just take her home. she's gonna
blow this whole thing for us.

236
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,792
- I was hoping to meet someone, man.
- Who you gonna meet tonight?

237
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,094
- I don't know.
- Who are you gonna meet?

238
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,623
Nikki.

239
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,260
Hey.

240
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,965
I'm drunk as shit.
Where's my tour?

241
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,507
Your tour's starting right now.

242
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,033
l... I love you.

243
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,103
- Hey, Helen? Meet Harry.
- Huh?

244
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,045
A tour of the house
should always end in the bedroom.

245
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,146
I like fucking in the kitchen
as much as the next guy,

246
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,952
but you're three times
more likely to get laid

247
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,186
if there's a bed in the room.

248
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,421
- You're good at that.
- I used to be a cheerleader.

249
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,259
- Oh really?
- Mm-hmm.

250
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,898
So you took your pants off a lot?

251
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,426
- What?
- What?

252
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,664
You date the offense
or the defense?

253
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,675
Give me some credit.
Offense.

254
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,233
Offense.

255
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,177
- Mm-hmm.
- Quarterbacks?

256
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,976
- Receivers.
- Mm.

257
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,551
Took a bunch of acid once
and thought my dick was a Dolphin.

258
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,247
I hate the Dolphins.

259
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,213
I'm a Niners fan.

260
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,116
I don't know how I feel about that.

261
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,921
Feels like you like it.

262
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,345
That lady's crazy.

263
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,474
- Crazy good, right?
- No. Just crazy.

264
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,916
She almost got us killed...

265
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,047
trying to grab me,
get my zipper down...

266
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,456
while I'm driving.

267
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,756
- That's a problem?
- She's trying to fuck me

268
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,422
while I'm driving.
I need to see the road.

269
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,192
It's an important part
of driving.

270
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,596
Somebody's gotta make
the first move, man.

271
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,463
Yeah, well, she wanted to know
if you brought any girls

272
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,475
over to her house
when you were living there.

273
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,511
What'd you say?

274
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,779
What was I supposed to say?

275
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,982
All these things I can say,
things I can't say.

276
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,115
Sometimes I get confused.
What am I supposed to do?

277
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,656
Dude.

278
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,324
What am I supposed to do?

279
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,859
You're an asshole.

280
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,428
I hate you.

281
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,338
Did you show her
the little red Corvette?

282
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,639
But of course... not.

283
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,238
Dude, you didn't fuck her?
How could you not fuck her?

284
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,407
- Fuck you.
- She's got a magical pussy.

285
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,883
- Ain't nothing wrong with it.
- Oh because it's, what,

286
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,478
been worked on like 30 times maybe?

287
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,518
Hey, there's a spare bedroom here
if you want to stay.

288
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,660
- Yeah.
- Don't let me screw this one up, okay?

289
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,828
This is hot.

290
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,861
Yeah, this is pretty nice.

291
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,272
When you're rich,
it costs more money to stay rich.

292
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,176
I always follow up a meaningless fuck

293
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,701
with a chatty phone call.

294
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,214
Keeps me in the game.
Most guys drop the ball

295
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,217
after they ball.
I look ahead.

296
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,379
An easy call the day
after a lay can go a long way.

297
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,082
Hola, amiga!

298
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,387
Lo siento por el mess.

299
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,234
- Hello?
- Hey, where are you?

300
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,538
- Uh, I'm at your house.
- Really?

301
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,512
So why didn't you answer the phone?
I called you twice last night.

302
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,176
You did?
How's New York?

303
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,152
These guys don't need
a lawyer. They need a babysitter.

304
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,520
So, listen, we have some friends
coming over on Thursday night.

305
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,650
We do?

306
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,660
We do.
Do you want to check your schedule?

307
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,457
Yeah, sure.

308
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:01,728
Hey, Gina, how's my
Thursday night look?

309
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,394
Oh, that's sweet.

310
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,370
So we're on.

311
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,498
- We're on.
- Okay.

312
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,308
- Bye.
- Okay.

313
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,005
Bye.

314
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,646
The home team has first and 10...

315
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,652
Oh my God. You didn't tell me you live
at the top of the fucking globe.

316
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,827
My car overheated,
so I walked up the hill.

317
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,355
This guy offers me a ride.

318
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,992
I say no, but he keeps
following me,

319
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,593
so I ran.

320
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,133
Oh my God.
Is that a ham?

321
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,199
I haven't eaten
since like Thursday.

322
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,404
Cornflakes.

323
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,879
I started this band...
me and this guy.

324
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,874
We tell everyone
we're brother and sister

325
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,441
and then we get
all sexy on stage.

326
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,878
Who are you hustling, Nikk?

327
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,290
- What?
- Mm. The house.

328
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,784
- Who's it belong to?
- Uh...

329
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,355
it used to belong
to Peter Bogdanovich.

330
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,732
Who? Come on, Nikk.
It's me, okay?

331
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,669
Remember me?

332
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,331
I was the first girl
to shave your balls.

333
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,068
You were the first guy
in my ass, I mean...

334
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,598
there were feelings.

335
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,440
It's not what you think.

336
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,036
You can tell me.
I mean,

337
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,105
it's not like you're getting
any from me.

338
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,448
When a girl tells you
you're not getting any,

339
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,011
before you ask,

340
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,717
before you even try,

341
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,953
you're getting some.

342
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,620
Mm-hmm.

343
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,226
What do you tell these women?

344
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,564
Less is more.

345
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,160
Why do you care?

346
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,228
Um, so that when you call me

347
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,331
lonely and miserable
in 10 years,

348
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,434
I can tell you exactly
how you got there.

349
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,274
- Hmm.
- You're a good person, Nikki.

350
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,781
I mean, this can't feel good.

351
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,779
So what's her deal?
How old is she?

352
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,226
I have to be inside you
right now.

353
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,752
Every time we have sex,
you disappear.

354
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,765
- It's not like that...
- You say that every time.

355
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,565
I didn't call you for sex.
I called you because I miss you.

356
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,730
Yeah, but now that I'm here,

357
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:24,105
you don't miss me anymore
and now you want sex.

358
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,407
- And you don't?
- I want more than sex.

359
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,243
Me too.

360
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,908
What, Nikki?
More what?

361
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,612
l... I don't know.
It's all very new, this feeling.

362
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,447
You are so full of shit.

363
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,988
You're right.

364
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,293
I am full of shit.

365
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,241
Does she have a bathtub?

366
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,717
You want to shave my papaya?

367
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,701
Be careful with me.

368
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,771
Promise.

369
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,709
I promise.

370
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,588
Lots of times I can envision my future

371
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,601
with a woman before I come.

372
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,573
How long are you gonna
keep doing this?

373
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,975
And then after, I just want them
to stop touching me.

374
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,071
I don't know.

375
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,875
What if we just gave it a try?

376
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,758
I don't want
to do that to you again.

377
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,320
I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.

378
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,328
Maybe you just
don't care about me.

379
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,105
You cool?

380
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,873
Yep, I'm cool.

381
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,710
You know you're
my homegirl, right?

382
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,375
Yeah.

383
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,020
- See ya.
- Drive safe, okay?

384
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,649
Yep.

385
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,924
Oh!

386
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,592
The snap...

387
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,500
Brown kicks it off.
It's 40, at the 45,

388
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,231
he's at the 30, 35...

389
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,863
Oh yes! Yes!

390
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,737
- No!
- Yes!

391
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,675
- What the hell's wrong with them?
- They suck,

392
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,236
that's what's wrong with them.

393
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,271
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

394
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,966
Jesus Christ.

395
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,567
Turn it off.

396
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,737
- Uh...
- Uh...

397
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,474
- Get out.
- Her?

398
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,812
Her! Get out.

399
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,340
I, uh...

400
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,444
Brown has it.
...we were watching the game

401
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,512
and, uh, one thing led to...

402
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,088
I'm... l...

403
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,329
- I'm sorry.
- For what? Getting caught?

404
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,963
How was your little party?

405
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,402
- What party?
- The one my maid cleaned up for you.

406
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,101
Sit down.

407
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,046
Thanks.
See you later.

408
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,218
I trusted you.
I fucking trusted you.

409
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,058
Yeah? Really?
You trusted me?

410
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,791
'Cause it kind of feels like
you came home early

411
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,992
to catch me at something,
but catch me at what?

412
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,365
I don't really know, 'cause we never
really had the conversation.

413
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,960
Oh, the conversation?

414
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,665
You want to have
the fucking conversation?

415
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,834
Okay, how would you
characterize our relationship?

416
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,968
What? I'm...

417
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,673
You want me to characterize
and you can confirm or deny?

418
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,341
- Confirm or deny.
- Yeah, confirm or deny.

419
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,350
We are hopelessly
in love with each other.

420
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:04,079
Come on! Are we hopelessly
in love with each other?

421
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,352
- No.
- No, of course not.

422
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,949
- No.
- So how about this?

423
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,052
We have a relationship built
on honesty and integrity.

424
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,086
- Samantha, I'm not...
- What? Confirm or deny!

425
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,496
- Well, you want me... deny!
- Deny is right.

426
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,500
How about this?

427
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,663
I support you
and you perform sexual favors.

428
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,639
Is that what this is about?

429
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,468
- We're friends.
- We're friends?

430
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,672
Friends who...

431
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,681
fuck.

432
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,344
Okay, how about we're
friends who fuck

433
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,353
and you don't
stay here anymore?

434
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,282
- Fine.
- Great.

435
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,861
I don't know how
that's gonna work.

436
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,395
I don't have a car,
so I can't...

437
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,265
it's not... I can't come over.

438
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:54,362
And I don't have a place,
so it's not like you can come and...

439
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,711
fuck me,
so, l... I guess if we're...

440
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,235
and as my friend,

441
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,838
I think you should be
a little bit concerned

442
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,816
that I don't have
a place to live.

443
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,421
You are a real piece of work.

444
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,131
# Help #

445
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:36,408
# Standing at the door,
there's a man to meet #

446
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,576
# Shaking on my hand... #

447
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,985
#As he starts to speak #

448
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:52,357
# And he just might be afraid,
he just might be afraid #

449
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:58,366
# I don't want to hear
what he's gonna say #

450
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,303
# Oh, oh-oh #

451
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,607
# Oh, oh-oh-oh #

452
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,603
# Oh, oh-oh-oh #

453
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,512
# Oh, oh-oh-oh... #

454
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,253
- Is everything all right?
- No.

455
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,259
These pancakes are sour.

456
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:26,158
They're buttermilk pancakes.
They're supposed to be sour.

457
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,865
Oh, maybe you're right.

458
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,870
- Good.
- Excuse me.

459
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,569
What's your name?

460
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,974
- Heather.
- Hi, Heather. I'm Nikki.

461
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,001
- Hi, Nikki, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

462
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,138
- Have you worked here long?
- Three days.

463
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,479
Really? You new to LA?

464
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,542
Why? You want
to show me around?

465
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,881
I don't... um, yeah, okay.

466
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,947
I'm from here.

467
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,289
Okay. Maybe you
can show me around.

468
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,386
I don't think so.
Can I get you anything else?

469
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,522
How about a phone number?

470
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,499
Why? 'Cause we're
so compatible?

471
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,560
I don't know. I just thought we'd get
a cup of coffee or something.

472
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,537
When I leave here,
the last thing I want is coffee.

473
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,473
Hey, maybe we could go on a hike?

474
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,904
No. No hikes.

475
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,810
We could just talk.

476
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,112
We're talking now,
and don't take this personally...

477
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,311
it's not that you're not
a brilliant conversationalist...

478
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,252
Okay okay okay.

479
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,223
Why don't you just
give me your phone number?

480
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,521
Because I don't
want you to call me.

481
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,189
Whenever you're ready.

482
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,867
She's hot, huh?

483
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,405
Yeah.

484
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,311
- I delivered some stuff.
- Oh, hey, man. How you doing?

485
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,980
Hello.

486
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,915
I was expecting a phone call,
but this'll work.

487
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,441
Who the fuck do you think you are
making me chase down my money?

488
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,149
I'm sorry. l... how did
you find this place?

489
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,954
Your friend,
the delivery guy.

490
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,790
Right.

491
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,625
Where's my money, asshole?

492
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,889
- It's inside. You wanna come in?
- No, I don't want to come in.

493
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,447
Uh, look, I didn't...

494
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,643
See ya.

495
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,878
I'm gonna get some lemonade.
Do you want some lemonade?

496
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,076
Lemonade sounds good.

497
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,019
Okay.

498
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,722
Ah!

499
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,756
- Oh!
- Oh God!

500
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,393
- Oh!
- Slap it!

501
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,960
- Oh!
- Nasty!

502
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,938
- In your ass!
- Love that!

503
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,703
I love the tennis, man.
I love the girls' noises...

504
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,075
- You can't go wrong with girls' tennis.
- No. No. Girls' tennis.

505
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,879
It's the best.
Hey, can you do me a favor?

506
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,885
Yeah, sure.

507
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,445
Tomorrow morning,

508
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,287
there's this girl working
at this coffee shop, right?

509
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,590
I got a little thing
going with her.

510
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,391
Yeah.

511
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,125
I just need you
to help me work this out.

512
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,367
Excellent. When in doubt,
call your friend Harry.

513
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,013
All right, look.
She's seen the house,

514
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,746
so we gotta play it up.

515
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,879
Hey, I'm not your assistant.

516
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,752
Is she coming now?

517
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,892
Come on.
You're killing me, Charlie.

518
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,224
Look, your lawyer blue-lined it,
you agreed to it.

519
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,230
- I'll have the oatmeal...
- Do you want to do this or not?

520
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,994
- No raisins please.
- Excellent.

521
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,526
- All right. Where we at with Jim Case?
- Jim Casey.

522
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,971
Shit. Where'd I lose ya?

523
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,747
- You gonna order?
- It's... it's...

524
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,114
He's gonna get
the eggs over easy

525
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,814
- and... and a muffin.
- Can I talk to you later?

526
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,788
All right.

527
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,485
I need a new phone.

528
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,118
Apparently.

529
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,130
That was brutal.

530
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,659
That was karma...

531
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,637
boss.

532
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,268
Is that your car, the Mercedes?

533
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,246
Yeah.

534
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,112
You're getting a ticket.

535
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,449
- What do you want?
- Wow, you have beautiful hands.

536
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,082
Can I see your hand?

537
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,616
Can I see... they're beautiful.

538
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,288
- Could you...
- Somebody...

539
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,853
would you do
a little spin for me?

540
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,865
- Are you kidding?
- No no no, just a little spin.

541
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,491
Just... just a little light...
that's it.

542
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,024
Just like this.

543
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,307
We're... we're like it's
a street party, Doris.

544
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,318
- Look, give me one of these...
- Yeah, yeah yeah yeah...

545
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,479
Just give me one of these. Oh!
Yeah, look... look at you.

546
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,580
- I'm gonna give you one of these...
- You have got the moves.

547
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,147
- Yeah.
- All right.

548
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,886
- Have a good day.
- Yeah, you too.

549
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,668
No coffee. No hikes.

550
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,493
Hey, this is Nikki.
What are you doing?

551
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,363
I'm ironing my pants.

552
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,627
What are you ironing
your pants for?

553
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,298
Can I call you right back?

554
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,236
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.
Just call me back.

555
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,644
All right.

556
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,692
"I'll call you back."

557
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,528
Doesn't that mean like 15 minutes
or something?

558
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,627
You say it all the time.
You don't call me back in 15 minutes.

559
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,104
It's been like 12 hours.

560
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,663
And that sucks, doesn't it?

561
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,505
Right, look, you're... you're mad
'cause you can't follow your own advice.

562
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,569
Okay, you can always call a girl.
You can't uncall her.

563
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,945
Come on, man.
I like this girl.

564
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,472
I'm serious.

565
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,451
Yeah.

566
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,613
Why does all my stuff
smell like mothballs?

567
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,816
'Cause I don't want moths.

568
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,417
Well, what's worse,
moths or mothballs?

569
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,152
I don't know. If you don't like it,
you should take your shit.

570
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,763
Tell you man, between
your mothballs and your frogs.

571
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,428
What's wrong with the frogs?

572
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,164
I am Harry the frog here.

573
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,435
I have three frogs.
I have two tree frogs

574
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,032
and a bullfrog.

575
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,637
I don't have moths
because I have mothballs.

576
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,147
- All right. Get the fuck out, okay?
- Come on.

577
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,877
You come over here,
you start belittling me.

578
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,215
Just start thinking of a place
to store your shit

579
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,950
- and get the fuck out.
- It was a joke.

580
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,481
I don't care. Get out.

581
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,391
Sorry.

582
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,370
I'm sorry.

583
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:26,325
- Hello.
- Hey there. It's Heather.

584
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,361
- Hey.
- Hello.

585
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,897
Think you might be up
for some dinner tonight?

586
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:35,777
- Where?
- Um, La Poubelle? 9:00?

587
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,680
- All right.
- All right. Bye now.

588
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,617
Okay. Bye.

589
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,355
Keep this open.

590
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,693
I'm late.
Are you mad?

591
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,035
Will you ever forgive me?

592
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,930
Maybe someday
when I'm old and gray.

593
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,099
Let's get a table.

594
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,709
Take Camp David, for example.
There's no camping.

595
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,653
How much better would it be
if the four dignitaries

596
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,417
could just pitch a tent
and hang out?

597
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,391
We'd have Israel, Palestine...

598
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:24,155
...talking out their differences
over a campfire roasting marshmallows.

599
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,562
It's just that there's a better way to
lead a superpower into the 21st century.

600
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,623
Hey.

601
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,033
I'm with friends.

602
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,559
She's with the commander in chief.

603
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,936
What are you talking about?

604
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,110
You're a little monkey,
you know that?

605
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,212
All right.

606
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,942
Okay.

607
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,778
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

608
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,618
What do you mean you have to go?

609
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,453
I gotta go. Rain check?

610
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,788
Hey.

611
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,390
- I'm sorry, I really am.
- What the fuck?

612
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,595
- What happened?
- I gotta go. Nothing.

613
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,605
Where are you going?

614
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,631
- Will you call me?
- No.

615
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,007
- You sure?
- No, I don't think so.

616
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,147
Are you kidding me?

617
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,172
- Who are you fucking?
- Huh?

618
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,940
Who are you fucking?

619
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,573
Nobody.

620
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,313
Liar.

621
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,219
I need you to drive me
to the hospital.

622
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,849
- What for?
- Just get dressed.

623
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,620
Why do you go to the hospital?

624
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,359
Not your business.

625
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,163
It's none of my business.
All right.

626
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,670
Just drop me off.
Pick me up tomorrow.

627
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,143
Oh hey, is Heather here?

628
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,381
No, Heather doesn't
work here anymore.

629
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,033
"Are you alone?"

630
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,798
Yeah.

631
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,484
I love your house.

632
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,586
What are you doing?

633
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,257
Am I interrupting anything?

634
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,357
Yeah. A peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

635
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,560
What kind of jelly?

636
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,471
It was jam actually.
Apricot.

637
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,640
I love that you know
the difference.

638
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,984
Hey, what's your deal?

639
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,578
You're having
a good time with someone

640
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:39,316
and you just take off,
you split.

641
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,551
- What's that?
- Is that what you think?

642
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:44,459
What I think is that
you have a boyfriend.

643
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,486
- You're wrong.
- Oh right.

644
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,327
Then what was the big emergency?
Who's "monkey"?

645
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,000
- My little brother.
- Oh. Right.

646
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,876
You know, I just met you.

647
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,673
You really need to know all this?

648
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,183
He has MS.

649
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,742
He's 17 and... incontinent.

650
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,277
You know what that means?

651
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,184
Of course.

652
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,551
Hey.

653
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,300
I smoke sometimes.

654
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,199
Mm.

655
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,405
I'm allergic to cats.

656
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,345
Okay.

657
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,012
I hate my last name.

658
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,656
I really like you.

659
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,628
I don't want to rush this, okay?

660
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,565
Okay.

661
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,904
Will you just hold me?

662
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,377
Yeah.

663
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,209
I gotta move your car.

664
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,078
There's street cleaning.

665
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,970
Heather. Heather.

666
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,971
That's cute.
I made that move up.

667
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,640
Wake up.

668
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,206
Go. Get the fuck out.

669
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,480
Go shake it off.
Go fuck monkey.

670
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,955
What are you talking about?

671
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,618
You're a little monkey,
you know that?

672
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,354
You're a little monkey.

673
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:07,192
You're a fucking whore.
I asked you if you had a boyfriend

674
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,131
and you said no.

675
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:18,968
I'm waiting tables
and driving an $80,000 car.

676
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,806
Did you actually
think it was mine?

677
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,573
Get out.

678
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,852
Hey. Hey.

679
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,895
- I missed you.
- You okay?

680
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,239
- Hi.
- HI.

681
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,834
Let me just tell you a little bit
about vaginal rejuvenation.

682
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:56,642
What I did was, I took
fat cells from her thighs

683
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,341
and I injected them

684
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,818
into the walls of her vagina
tightening it all up.

685
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:04,548
So that means no penetration

686
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,215
for five days.

687
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,417
But I think you'll find it
well worth the wait.

688
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,258
- See you soon.
- Okay.

689
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,279
Hey.

690
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,285
You all right?

691
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:15,954
You didn't come home
all night.

692
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,484
You didn't call.
You didn't answer my calls.

693
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,622
You didn't leave me a note.

694
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,032
No, I'm not all right.

695
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:31,472
- I'm really sorry.
- You're not sorry.

696
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,135
You know what I meant.

697
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,007
No, I don't know
what you meant.

698
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,481
I know what you fucking said.
Why don't you show some regret?

699
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,483
Why don't you show me
that you're sorry?

700
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,077
Fuck it.
This isn't working out.

701
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,350
Where'd you pick that up?
Junior high?

702
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,457
Oh you're gonna go?
You wanna go?

703
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:52,893
You're gonna go now? You better
take all the fucking shit I bought you.

704
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,956
- Come on.
- Gucci.

705
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,297
$400 jeans...

706
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,825
- Stop it.
- And fucking...

707
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,462
Stop it.

708
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,065
- Prada...
- Stop it!

709
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,904
I don't want it.

710
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,002
You don't want it?

711
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:10,343
Let me tell you something.

712
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,439
You are getting older.

713
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,109
You're losing your looks.

714
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,743
And your only charming
'cause you're cute.

715
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,380
You're not really charming.
You're not funny.

716
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,585
And you're not smart,
I hope you understand that.

717
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,355
You're nothing but six inches
and a pretty face

718
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,192
and you're gonna have to suffer
just like everybody else.

719
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,295
- It's seven.
- It's not seven.

720
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,452
It's okay.

721
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,753
You'll be okay.

722
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,760
You're gonna be okay.

723
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,033
You hungry?

724
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,969
Want me to make you an omelet?

725
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,299
Where are you gonna go?

726
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,064
I don't know.

727
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,408
How long do you think it'll be before
you come crawling back here?

728
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,075
I don't know.

729
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,684
S... Samantha!

730
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:05,626
- Say goodbye to the little cunts.
- Fuck!

731
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,399
If you like me so much,
tell me what you like about me.

732
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:50,773
I like that you're smart...

733
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,832
and you're interesting...

734
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,639
and you don't take shit
from people...

735
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,545
and I like who I am
when I'm with you.

736
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,550
See?

737
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,882
It's not even about me.
You don't give a shit about me.

738
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,649
- Well, that's not true.
- Yeah?

739
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,623
Then why don't you
ask me any questions?

740
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,454
Ask you any quest...
what do you mean?

741
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,724
- That's a question right there.
- No, I mean like

742
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,525
"Hey, Em, how's your band?"

743
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,192
"How's your sick mom, Emily?"

744
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,065
Well, I'm not a question asker.

745
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,366
- You know what it's like?
- You're gonna say I'm not...

746
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:24,237
It's just like I can't tell if you're...
I don't know if it's me,

747
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,936
or if... or if you're just afraid.

748
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:29,936
Afraid? I'm afraid of what?

749
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,504
Intimacy.

750
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,413
- And you're not.
- No, I'm not.

751
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,078
Oh come... all right, that's why
you're with someone right now?

752
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:42,686
Don't you ever think that maybe you
just haven't met the right person yet?

753
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,623
You know, I feel like
when I meet that person,

754
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,597
that I'll ask the right questions.

755
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,328
This is a waste of time.
You can't stay here.

756
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,131
You... you tell me
that I'm afraid.

757
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,502
And then the minute I get real,
you're gonna kick me out.

758
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,598
- You want me to get real with you?
- Yeah.

759
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,576
Okay, I have always been
attracted to you, okay?

760
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,078
But that is it.

761
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,173
'Cause I don't find you
remotely interesting.

762
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:10,186
- You don't mean that.
- Yeah, I do. I think you're vacuous.

763
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,018
And you fuck women for stuff?

764
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,286
You're a whore.

765
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,928
Is everything okay?

766
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,934
Yeah, it's fine.

767
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,778
Harry. Hey, where are you?

768
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,007
Where?

769
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,781
- Nikki?
- Yeah yeah.

770
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,186
I'm Sean. I'm Harry's buddy
from high school.

771
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,954
Very very nice.
That girl's hot.

772
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,520
How are you?
I love you.

773
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,156
You're fucking hot.

774
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:03,435
Harry, yo, I gotta talk to you.

775
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,236
Harry.

776
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,735
Oh my goodness. Hi.

777
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,808
You are fucking gorgeous.
Let's do this right now.

778
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,579
Let's just start.

779
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:21,846
Hey, hi, how are you?
Hi, nice to meet you.

780
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,984
Can I just...
can you lean back for a second?

781
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,551
All right? Wow?

782
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,495
- Will you rub your box for me?
- All right.

783
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,498
- That's not...
- Rub your box for me, come on.

784
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,022
Rub your box for Daddy.
Fucking love it.

785
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,035
- Dude, what the fuck?
- Come on, come on. Rub your box.

786
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:35,594
Yo, come on, man.

787
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,163
- No, they like that.
- No, that's not cool.

788
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,038
- That's not cool.
- Will you rub your box for me?

789
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,043
Just like rub your box for me
like you were in the shower.

790
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,068
- Don't talk to her like that.
- No, they like that.

791
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,308
Did you wash your ass, actually?
Can I smell?

792
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,111
- What the fuck, man?
- That would be great.

793
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,311
You little fucking whore!

794
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,343
- Okay. What the...
- Hey hey hey!

795
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,447
Hey, what are you doing, man?

796
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,887
It's a fucking strip club, man.

797
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,451
Come on, man.

798
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,090
That girl's straight off the bus
from like Kansas or whatever.

799
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,191
You don't talk to her like that.

800
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,724
She's a human being, man.

801
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:08,829
Are you kidding me?
You objectify women more than anyone.

802
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,635
What if that girl
was your sister, man?

803
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:13,074
Dude, I wouldn't let you within
10 miles of my sister, all right?

804
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,974
And you wouldn't even go after her
'cause she doesn't have the right car

805
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,309
or the right house, right?

806
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,914
Well, you should've told me that
before I fucked her.

807
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,084
Smelled like Teen Spirit, man.

808
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,214
Fuck you.

809
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,248
Get the fuck out of my face.

810
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:36,128
Here comes your boyfriend.

811
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,099
- Think I can slip in?
- Sorry, bro, not tonight, man.

812
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,201
- No, you're kidding me, right?
- Not my call.

813
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,240
Come on.
I'm sorry.

814
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,945
- You're joking, right?
- It's not us tonight. It's a buyout.

815
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,428
Come on, man.
I said I was sorry.

816
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,498
You're always sorry.
Just take your shit.

817
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,702
I got nowhere to go, man.

818
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,645
I'm sure you're gonna figure it out.

819
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,125
# Baby girl, hold on... #

820
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,855
Unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.

821
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,760
You guys have...
what... what about the sweater?

822
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,630
- What'll you give me for the sweater?
- Nine bucks.

823
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,032
Nine bucks?!
No, that's rob... fine.

824
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,696
You know what?
Take it. Take it.

825
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,467
# You give it u-u-u-up #

826
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,702
# Baby girl, hold on #

827
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,008
# I won't let go-o-o-o #

828
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,606
# I won't let go... #

829
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,414
I'm good. Yeah, things are good.
Real good.

830
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,581
You've been out there for a long time.

831
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,183
Are you working?

832
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,125
Yeah.

833
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,753
I'm up for a couple jobs.

834
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,026
They're, um...

835
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,828
they're big campaigns actually,
so if I get one

836
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,732
it could be real good.

837
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,233
Hello?

838
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,470
Mom?

839
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,378
# Hold on, it's just
you and me... #

840
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:33,041
# Hold on #

841
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,983
# We can make this
Hollywood Hollywood #

842
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,113
# You can be a big star,
big star... #

843
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,851
Hi, you've reached Terry.

844
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:44,018
- Leave a message. I'll call you back.
- Mom?

845
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,187
# Big star, big star... #

846
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:49,062
- Hello?
- # Hollywood Hollywood... #

847
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:50,827
Pick up, Mom.

848
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,528
# Big star, big star #

849
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:55,367
# We can make this
Hollywood Hollywood. #

850
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:15,220
When I first came here,

851
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:18,352
I thought every day was
gonna be a Van Halen video...

852
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:19,986
hot chicks wearing bikinis

853
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,860
riding around on roller skates

854
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:23,593
drinking cocktails by the pool.

855
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,927
Damn you, Van Halen.

856
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:50,258
# All the fallen leaves will find
their branches again #

857
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:53,660
# Raindrops from the heavens,
I'll eventually swim #

858
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,995
# A river, an ocean,
a wave in my heart #

859
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:01,231
# We got your money,
now we'll make a new start #

860
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:10,872
# All the fallen leaves
will find their branches again #

861
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:14,111
# Raindrops in the heavens
I'll eventually swim #

862
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,745
# River, an ocean,
a wave in my heart #

863
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,813
# We got your money,
now we'll make a new start #

864
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:31,794
# In another week, promise #

865
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:34,632
# In another year, I promise #

866
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:38,800
# Put your right hand
on my heart #

867
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:48,078
# Heart... #

868
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,352
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Swimming.

869
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,320
Look,

870
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,230
I'm sorry about what happened,
but this is not fucking cool.

871
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,757
What happened?

872
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,737
I called you an asshole.
I kicked you out.

873
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,295
I called you a whore.

874
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,830
I'm sorry.

875
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:13,671
That's strange.

876
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,804
'Cause it seems like you and I
are maybe playing the same cards.

877
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,609
- Yeah.
- Last time I checked, you were living

878
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,515
in a $5 million house. Now you're
turning tricks for a sandwich.

879
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,679
- I'm not turning anything.
- Tell me something, though...

880
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,848
out of everybody here, why her?

881
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:30,256
I don't think you understand
my situation, okay?

882
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,956
I'm about to get evicted
from the Sahara Motor Inn.

883
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,988
I'm selling my near-mint
sweaters for nine bucks.

884
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,865
And the club sandwich is gonna be
the first thing I've had to eat all day.

885
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,233
I don't really have time
to be picky.

886
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,372
Going up to my suite.

887
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,070
Are you coming?

888
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,706
He'd like to know if your AmEx
is silver or black?

889
01:00:56,586 --> 01:01:00,420
I'll buy him a sandwich...
you ratty bitch.

890
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:11,291
- This is us?
- Is that okay?

891
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,564
What? Are you scamming
a schoolteacher now?

892
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,170
Used car salesman.

893
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,573
I hate the furniture.
Don't look at it.

894
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:28,914
My roommate's a total pothead.
She never comes out of her room.

895
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:35,048
So what happened to Mercedes?

896
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,525
I told her it wasn't working out.

897
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:44,699
- What about the Porsche?
- Turned into an asshole.

898
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,464
I got back at him though.

899
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,971
I sold his cigars on eBay.

900
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:59,137
Dougie.

901
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,809
I don't know.

902
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,750
Where you been looking?

903
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,448
Actually, I was on my way to do
some grocery shopping.

904
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,184
Bristol Farms on Doheny.

905
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,628
You said you wanted to see me.

906
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,791
Great.

907
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,664
When are you picking me up?

908
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:21,894
Perfect.

909
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:23,997
See you then, baby.
Ciao.

910
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,672
What do you want for dinner?

911
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,084
Cheers to that.

912
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,502
This wine would be better after 2012.

913
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:56,596
Maybe we should wait.

914
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,675
We're not in. Leave a message.

915
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,543
Hey, it's me.
You know Douglas Dukes,

916
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:08,209
that video game billionaire? I guess
he just broke up with what's-her-name.

917
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:10,151
And he and his boys
are going to Les Trois tonight.

918
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,347
I can't go,
but I put you on the list.

919
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,822
Have fun.

920
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,631
You gonna keep stepping
on my dress like that?

921
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,003
All night long I'm stepping
on your dress like that.

922
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,905
Two shots of tequila, please.

923
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,837
- Got him.
- Where?

924
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:38,176
12:00.

925
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:41,115
Next to the girl in the yellow.

926
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,845
Not bad.

927
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:46,180
- Hmm.
- Can I have a gin and tonic?

928
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,383
- What are we drinking to?
- Trouble.

929
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:56,191
- Laugh.
- What?

930
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,564
I just said something funny.
Laugh.

931
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,606
Well done.

932
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,542
- I try.
- Any more moves?

933
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,708
- Can you dance?
- Can I dance?

934
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,401
# Why aren't you
coming anymore? #

935
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:43,073
# Why aren't you
coming anymore? #

936
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:14,002
They say you gotta kiss
a lot of frogs to find your prince.

937
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:18,141
But in this town,
everyone thinks they're royalty.

938
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,045
And the frogs
don't stand a chance.

939
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,323
- I want 15%.
- You're out of your mind.

940
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,519
Fine, 12.

941
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,687
Four and that's my final offer.

942
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,789
What are you, my pimp?

943
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,164
Look, l...

944
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:48,040
Oh man.
All I need's a blanket.

945
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,238
I don't need all those
sheets and everything.

946
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,314
I don't want you getting
your funk all over.

947
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:56,182
My funk.

948
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:58,311
Yeah, you can't wash a couch.

949
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:02,415
- Night.
- Hey, thank you.

950
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:05,717
I'd let you sleep in my bed,

951
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:09,322
but, um, I wouldn't
want you to get confused.

952
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,831
Good night.

953
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,268
The, uh, couch is...

954
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,437
the couch is a little short.

955
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,709
So, I'm... I'm just gonna...

956
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:02,548
just gonna lie
down here like this.

957
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:04,553
I'm on the side, away from you.

958
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,418
You won't even know I'm here.

959
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,481
- Okay, I'll take the couch.
- No. No no no.

960
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,425
No, wait. Wait.

961
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,761
- What?
- What are you afraid of?

962
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,925
You really think I'm gonna
make a pass at you?

963
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:22,404
- You're in my bed.
- And?

964
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:25,669
You don't... you don't think you can
keep your hands off me, huh?

965
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,336
Please!

966
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:31,437
We're adults. I think
we can control ourselves.

967
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:35,844
Whatever.

968
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,132
Sorry.

969
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,332
For what?

970
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,807
What? I nudged you, didn't I?

971
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:02,635
I didn't feel anything.

972
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:06,507
Well, l... l... I brushed up

973
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,710
against your foot like that.

974
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,516
I felt that.

975
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,695
Do you feel that?

976
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,834
That tickles.

977
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,008
Like good tickles or bad tickles?

978
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,040
Just tickles.

979
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,515
I can tell you're smiling

980
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:48,352
and I can't even see your face.

981
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,990
How many times
have you used that line?

982
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,156
Oh, I don't know.

983
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,362
But I'm not just saying it
to get your pants off.

984
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:05,633
My pants are already off.

985
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:10,408
Oh.

986
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:18,049
What are we doing?

987
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,915
Why do we have to be doing anything?

988
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:26,924
This is not a good idea.

989
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,900
If I don't kiss your right now,
my face is gonna fall off.

990
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:41,971
- All right.
- There.

991
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,275
Oh, I need more than that.

992
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:49,047
For what?

993
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:50,745
See if I like it.

994
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,516
If you like it?

995
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:55,285
Yeah.

996
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,534
Like it?

997
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,970
I didn't like that at all.

998
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,667
- Really?
- Yeah.

999
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,993
So none of that was true?

1000
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,587
I don't have a brother.

1001
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,496
Well, I knew that.

1002
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,125
But I'm from Canada.

1003
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,295
I'm sorry about that.

1004
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,304
So when'd you decide to stop
playing Mata Hari with me?

1005
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,210
What makes you
so sure I stopped?

1006
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,975
You're two drinks in

1007
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:54,539
and you're already bragging
about all your lies.

1008
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,346
I could drink you
under the table.

1009
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:58,182
- Oh come on.
- Oh my God...

1010
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,710
- Nikki, hi.
- Hey.

1011
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,189
- How are you? Hi.
- Hey.

1012
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,283
Hey, remember me?

1013
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,123
Yeah, of course.

1014
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,290
- What's my name?
- Your name.

1015
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,730
My name.

1016
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,135
I'm blanking out.
Um, I'm blanking.

1017
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,736
You don't remember.

1018
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,211
That was fucked up.

1019
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:29,717
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

1020
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,016
She's a jerk.

1021
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,988
Chew this into your food.

1022
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:41,352
- Mm?
- Yeah.

1023
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:46,267
- Oh... ah!
- Oh my God. Waiter!

1024
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,729
- How can I assist?
- I don't want to cause a scene,

1025
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,503
but there's garbage in the food.
We're leaving now.

1026
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,107
- Wow.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1027
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,046
- Come on.
- Yeah, I'm coming, honey.

1028
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,606
How long do you think
it takes for it to set?

1029
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:31,443
- I don't know, like 20 seconds?
- See the dolphin?

1030
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,074
You see the dolphins?
There's freaking dolphins out there.

1031
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,640
- Oh!
- See it?

1032
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,413
- Yeah.
- There's freaking dolphins.

1033
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,056
# When I'm lost #

1034
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,286
# You bring me back #

1035
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,955
# When I don't know #

1036
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:49,520
# Where to go #

1037
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,959
# And it feels #

1038
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:55,060
# Like I'm alone #

1039
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:58,967
# When I hang #

1040
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,497
- # My head down low... #
- Bye, baby.

1041
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,032
Bye.

1042
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:03,567
- # I think of you... #
- Where are you going?

1043
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:05,739
Out. I'll be back in a bit.

1044
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,848
# Each night #

1045
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,912
# You wait #

1046
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:17,824
# Outside my door #

1047
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:21,760
# 'Cause you want to know #

1048
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:24,527
# Oh, whoa... #

1049
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,534
# I think of you #

1050
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:51,655
# When I fall into a snare #

1051
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:57,292
# And it's all too much to bear #

1052
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:02,966
# When I think nobody cares #

1053
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,008
# I think of you. #

1054
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:11,803
Hey.

1055
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,079
Hey.

1056
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:20,913
You all right?

1057
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,890
Hey.

1058
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,654
What happened?

1059
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:27,491
I just kinda broke up
with someone.

1060
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,325
You gotta fucking
be kidding me.

1061
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,238
He's my fiancé.

1062
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,403
Why didn't you tell me?

1063
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,073
I'm telling you now.

1064
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,287
When's the last time
you talked to him?

1065
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:55,623
Yesterday.

1066
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,428
When's the last time
you saw him?

1067
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:03,488
- Don't do this.
- Don't do what?

1068
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,466
What am I doing?

1069
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,469
Like it's a big surprise.

1070
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,061
He's rich.

1071
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,868
- His family owns the Rangers.
- Which one,

1072
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,807
Texas or New York?

1073
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,366
New York.

1074
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,378
Well, fuck, what'd you
break up with him for?

1075
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:19,539
He sounds like a fucking catch.

1076
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:21,515
- You know why.
- No, I don't.

1077
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:23,177
Honestly, I don't
know what to think.

1078
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:24,947
Because I love you.

1079
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:30,291
Happy? I said it.

1080
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:34,758
- Do you love him?
- No.

1081
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,462
Well...

1082
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,436
I don't think I was
faking it all the time.

1083
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,436
Are you faking it with me?

1084
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,246
Why would I fake it?

1085
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:58,447
You don't have a dime
or a job or a fucking plan.

1086
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:00,648
What would I fake for?

1087
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:11,959
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1088
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,797
I don't have a fucking plan.

1089
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:59,544
# Punk's dead #

1090
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:02,607
# The world's grey #

1091
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:07,786
# The sun rules #

1092
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:11,122
# It sucks life out #

1093
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:14,492
# Of each day #

1094
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,364
# I hate love... #

1095
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,890
Heather?

1096
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:23,268
# It's soap stars #

1097
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,398
- # And fake pink... #
- "Nikki, I'm going

1098
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,067
to New York to try
to sort this out.

1099
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,737
Don't burn down the house.
Big hug. Heather."

1100
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,943
Just come back.
You... don't leave.

1101
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,812
I know you're not gone yet.
You can't be gone yet.

1102
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,579
You couldn't have
gotten a flight that fast.

1103
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:39,712
Just... fuck. Just call me back
and come back.

1104
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:43,623
# Plastic matrix #

1105
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:48,028
# Of cartoon #

1106
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:50,759
# People #

1107
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:55,467
# Who talk loud #

1108
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:59,270
# And don't say anything #

1109
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:02,037
# But let her go. #

1110
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:09,510
Okay, this is hard to believe
it's not real meat.

1111
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,548
- Do... do you mind if l...
- Oh, please.

1112
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,614
Look who it is.

1113
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,922
- Mr. Monday night!
- Hey.

1114
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,485
Hey. What are you doing?

1115
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,825
You want to watch the game?

1116
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:30,101
- All that beer for you?
- No.

1117
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:32,129
Uh... this one's for me

1118
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:34,404
and then I got another one.

1119
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,172
- Oh, here we go.
- Oopsie.

1120
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,180
Do you, um...

1121
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,310
what do you say
I drive you home?

1122
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:46,411
- Okay.
- Okay.

1123
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,018
Don't get sick in the car.
Here, I'll pull over.

1124
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,550
I'm pulling over.
Just... all right.

1125
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,792
Open your door.
Open your door, don't...

1126
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,225
Are you all right?

1127
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:03,830
Do you want me to...

1128
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,384
Are you mad?

1129
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,876
No, I was worried.
I called you like 17,000 times.

1130
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,855
It's been hard to get away.

1131
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,082
Are you with him now?

1132
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:26,958
No, I'm not with him.

1133
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:30,158
Baby, I'm sorry.
I'm... l... look, I'm sorry

1134
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,598
I was such a dick.
I just... come home.

1135
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:36,333
Do you know what it's like
sleeping in your bed without you?

1136
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:38,100
No. What's it like?

1137
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,040
It's miserable.
I can... I can smell you,

1138
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,702
but I can't touch you.

1139
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:44,871
- When are you coming home?
- Nikki...

1140
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:47,245
Why can't you just leave now?

1141
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,614
- It's complicated.
- Baby, I don't...

1142
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,710
l... I'm here. You're there
with this guy and l...

1143
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:54,415
Who do you think's
been paying the bills?

1144
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,356
Who do you think bought the bed
we're sleeping in?

1145
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:00,125
- Baby, look, that's over. It's done.
- Hey!

1146
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:03,427
We're not gonna do that anymore.
I'm gonna... we'll get a place.

1147
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,729
I'll... I'll...

1148
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:08,702
deliver pizzas or rob banks...
I'll become a cop or something.

1149
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,466
Hey!

1150
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:13,906
- I love you.
- I love you, baby.

1151
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,240
- Let me in the car!
- Who's that?

1152
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,941
- It's a girl.
- Why didn't you tell me

1153
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,643
you were with someone?
Who's the girl?

1154
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:25,949
It's... she's just a friend.
I was... she was drunk

1155
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,478
and I didn't want her
to drive and so l...

1156
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:30,991
I told her that
I would take her home.

1157
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:33,517
What kind of car does she have?

1158
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,621
This isn't funny anymore!

1159
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,258
It's a Mercedes,
but it's not what... baby...

1160
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,097
I've gotta go.

1161
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:41,932
No, baby, don't... don't...

1162
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:46,538
I was on the phone
with my girlfriend.

1163
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:48,099
You're an asshole.

1164
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,378
Who is it?

1165
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:31,249
Uh, it's Nikki.
I'm a friend of Heather's.

1166
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:38,326
- Hey.
- Hi. Is something wrong?

1167
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,727
- Do you know where Heather is?
- Who are you?

1168
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,623
I'm kind of your roommate.

1169
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,398
What is that?

1170
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,963
Sounds like music.

1171
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:55,499
Where's Heather?

1172
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,704
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

1173
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,613
- What is your name?
- Nikki.

1174
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,117
- I'm Eva.
- Hey.

1175
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,176
Sure means certain.

1176
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:08,688
Pretty sure
doesn't mean anything.

1177
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,281
Okay, I'm sure.

1178
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:13,055
Okay. Then you need to act.

1179
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:18,032
Like what?
Get on a plane?

1180
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,034
I mean, make a commitment.

1181
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,903
What kind of commitment?

1182
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:28,141
A commitment.

1183
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,181
Greene Street.

1184
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:49,852
Believe me,
if the ring is the problem,

1185
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,490
the ring is not the problem.

1186
01:22:57,672 --> 01:22:59,833
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1187
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,973
# Gonna take you out #

1188
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:07,004
# Miss November #

1189
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:13,884
# Underneath a cloud so white... #

1190
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:19,890
# We won't come back #

1191
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:22,488
# Until the daylight's #

1192
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:24,157
# In our eyes #

1193
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:29,764
# I can feel your heart beat, baby #

1194
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:34,264
# I can feel your
heart beat fast #

1195
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,800
# Gonna take you out #

1196
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,904
- # Ms. November... #
- Actually, I don't know

1197
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,437
how to thank you for this.

1198
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,245
Just pay me back
some time, okay?

1199
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:43,875
- You're a great friend.
- I know, I know.

1200
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:45,886
- Okay, you're late, all right?
- Good luck.

1201
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,184
Okay. I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1202
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:50,214
- That sounds about right.
- Go get her.

1203
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,920
- # Ah... #
- # We won't be home #

1204
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:57,421
# Until all the birds have flown #

1205
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,759
# I can feel your heart beat, baby #

1206
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:06,638
# I can feel your heart beat fast #

1207
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:09,142
# La la la la la #

1208
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:12,271

01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:35,268
# I can feel your heart beat, baby #

1214
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:38,500
# I can feel
your heart beat fast #

1215
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:43,340
# I can feel your heart beat, baby #

1216
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:46,677
# I can feel your
heart beat fast. #

1217
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:56,182
What are you doing here?

1218
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:59,159
- Is he here?
- No, but he could be.

1219
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:02,959
Nothing happened
with that girl.

1220
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:05,192
It was completely innocent,
I swear to you.

1221
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,697
Close the door.

1222
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,442
You shouldn't have come here.

1223
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:20,971
I had to come here.
This isn't real.

1224
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,415
You know this isn't real.
This is bullshit.

1225
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,613
I've been here.

1226
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:30,825
You can't be happy.

1227
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:38,157
Come here.
Come here.

1228
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,967
Come with me.
Let's go.

1229
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:45,029
Go get your stuff.

1230
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:47,041
I can't.

1231
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:50,670
Why not?

1232
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,873
Say we go back to LA.
Then what?

1233
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:55,178
Get an apartment?

1234
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:57,343
They want first, last and security.
That's five grand.

1235
01:25:57,385 --> 01:25:59,148
Where do we get that?

1236
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:00,711
Hmm?

1237
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:03,849
- We'll figure it out.
- You're not a realist.

1238
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,387
You're a dreamer
and it scares me.

1239
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:15,734
It's not a diamond.

1240
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:20,370
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1241
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,373
Marry me.

1242
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:28,939
Be my wife,

1243
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:31,952
to have and to hold
and all that.

1244
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:36,891
We're already married.

1245
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:52,935
No. You can get a divorce.

1246
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:55,169
I can't.

1247
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,144
Why not?

1248
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,910
I need this.

1249
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:05,611
Hey, I'm home.

1250
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:08,087
- Where are you?
- Will.

1251
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:13,282
Honey, um, do you have a five
for the grocery boy?

1252
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:16,455
Oh sure, yeah, hey.

1253
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,159
Thanks, man.

1254
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:23,994
- Thanks. Hey.
- Thank you!

1255
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:26,131
- Hello.
- Hi.

1256
01:27:35,049 --> 01:27:37,950
# Good morning, dear #

1257
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:42,284
# I hope I didn't
wake you too soon #

1258
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:47,186
# Because my mind #

1259
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,992
# Is growing tired #

1260
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,966
# Too much thinking
what I should do #

1261
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:57,768
# I picture you #

1262
01:27:57,805 --> 01:27:59,534
# Out there #

1263
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:03,536
# It must be beautiful #

1264
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:05,637
# This time of year #

1265
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:10,542
# All those East Coast leaves #

1266
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:14,577
# Floating round like embers #

1267
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:17,250
# From burning trees #

1268
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:20,725
# Well, the weather out here #

1269
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:23,822
# Is just the same #

1270
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:26,493
# But the garden #

1271
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:29,196
# That you planted #

1272
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:31,330
# Remains... #

1273
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:45,345
When you're a kid, it's LA

1274
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:47,013
that teaches you how to dream.

1275
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:51,688
Tell me that you didn't learn more from
the movies than you did from school,

1276
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,854
more from TV than you did
from your parents.

1277
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:58,195
And what do we learn?

1278
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:00,200
We learn to believe in fairy tales.

1279
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,910
Hey.

1280
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:22,218
- How are you?
- Do you want to... I'm good.

1281
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:25,884
You?

1282
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:28,293
I'm great.

1283
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:37,100
Thank you.

1284
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,464
Take care, Nikki.

1285
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:43,871
You too.

1286
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:08,595
# 'Cause everything
around me has changed #

1287
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,629
# But the garden #

1288
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:15,403
# That you planted #

1289
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:17,502
# Remains. #

1290
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,657
You know why the departures
and the arrivals at LAX

1291
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:36,094
are on separate levels?

1292
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:39,190
So the 30,000 heartbreakers
that come here each month

1293
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:42,202
don't notice the 30,000 that are leaving
with their hearts broken.

1294
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:56,845
My whole life, it was obvious
I was gonna end up in this city.

1295
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,789
I'm still here.

1296
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:04,983
# Come on, let's go #

1297
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:07,551
# to where it's fun #

1298
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:14,899
# I want a slice of LA sun #

1299
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:19,335
# Whoa ho ho #

1300
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:23,367
# Whoa ho ho #

1301
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:26,837
# Honey, let's go #

1302
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:30,783
- # Feels like you never have to #
- # Let's go #

1303
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:33,218
# Come down,
you don't really want to #

1304
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:34,744
# Honey, let's go #

1305
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:38,657
- # Stay out is all you need to #
- # Honey, let's go #

1306
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:42,561
# Go to sleep, you don't
really want to #

1307
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:47,227
# So come along
and pay the price #

1308
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:55,338
# This ain't New York,
this tasty slice #

1309
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:59,545
# Whoa ho ho #

1310
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:03,573
# Whoa ho ho #

1311
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:06,643
# Honey, let's go #

1312
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:10,589
- # Feels like you never have to #
- # Let's go #

1313
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:13,025
# Come down,
you don't really want to #

1314
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,550
# Honey, let's go #

1315
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:18,463
- # Stay out is all you need to #
- # Honey, let's go #

1316
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:22,230
# Go to sleep, you don't
really want to #

1317
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:23,828
# Take a minute #

1318
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:26,339
# Listen to this town #

1319
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,069
# Don't you ever #

1320
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,134
# Feel you have to come #

1321
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:32,441
# Take a minute #

1322
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,744
# She won't let you down #

1323
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:38,080
# No no no no #

1324
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,679
# See you excited #

1325
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:43,087
# In her arms #

1326
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:50,757
# LA and all her crazy charms #

1327
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,463
# Whoa ho ho #

1328
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:59,769
# Whoa ho ho #

1329
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:02,139
# Whoa ho oh ho #

1330
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:06,078
- # Feels like you never have to #
- # Let's go #

1331
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:08,513
# Come down,
you don't really want to #

1332
01:33:08,549 --> 01:33:10,039
# Honey, let's go #

1333
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:13,952
- # Stay out, is all you need to #
- # Honey, let's go #

1334
01:33:13,988 --> 01:33:18,118
# Go to sleep, you don't
really want to #

1335
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:22,061
# Feels like you never have to... #

1336
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:24,496
# Come down,
you don't really want to #

1337
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:29,931
- # Stay out is all you need to #

01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:07,834
# Oh, baby #

1350
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:10,343
# Whoa-oh whoa-oh, whoa. #
