00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,491
<i>Hit n' run...</i>

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,844
Whoever it was... they're gone.

5
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,484
The war's over.
He got the memo.

6
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,367
Ize.

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Allen.

8
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,287
Ize!

9
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
What?

10
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,487
We got no movement.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,968
Not a sign of a shadow...

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,408
How long we been here, man?
18, plus?

13
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,568
- 20...
- Jesus.

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,808
There's nobody
fucking out there, man.

15
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,240
'Less he's a pro.

16
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
A Haji?

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,525
<i>I'm just saying, maybe.</i>

18
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
<i>Right.</i>

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,680
<i>Six construction guys
on that pipeline.</i>

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,160
<i>Two-man security escort.</i>

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
<i>Yep.</i>

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,931
Look at 'em.

23
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
What?

24
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,886
Not one body
near to anything resembling cover.

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,009
That's just fuckin' weird to me.

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,167
Don't mean shit, man.

27
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,802
Means he took 'em out
pretty fuckin' fast.

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,328
And I think they're all
fuckin' headshots, too.

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,851
Oh, fuck off, look...

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,480
check out our boy
with the radio,

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
he got the call out?

32
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
<i>Yep.</i>

33
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,920
<i>That ain't a headshot Ize.</i>

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,722
Okay, fine, so one
without a fucking headshot.

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,450
I mean, eight guys,
thirty seconds.

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,600
You're sayin' a Haji
went in there with a semi-auto?

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,280
Said he might be a pro.

38
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,400
Oh, right.

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,164
We're dealing with Juba now?

40
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,401
Might be.

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,129
I'm just saying.
That Wall's cursed...

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,528
It's a wall, man.
You're scared of a fuckin' wall?

43
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,843
Nah, I'm scared
of what's behind it.

44
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,840
Could be two Hajis,

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,888
sucking each other off
behind that thing.

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Hey.

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,680
What's there is there.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,800
Rest of that shit's
in your head,

49
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
you understand?

50
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Ize?

51
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,602
<i>Mm-hmm?</i>

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,326
What's your vote now,
got anyone out there?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,971
Nah, I mean,
I was 60 percent sure,

54
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,288
now I'm like 80...

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,010
I don't think so...

56
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,320
or... yep, he's a pro.

57
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,240
Oh, fuck off.

58
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,920
Probably the same
as it always is.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,048
Four or five Hajis
came in and bushwhacked 'em.

60
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,201
Mm-hmm.

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,804
That would make sense.

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,531
Maybe.

63
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,726
Or... he's a pro.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm fuckin' hot.
I'm calling it.

65
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,520
Ah, see, fuck you, man.

66
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,080
I knew that's what
you wanted to do...

67
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,451
I'm fucking with you, man!

68
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,125
What, are you
fucking hungry again?

69
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,006
Already had four or five MREs,
gorilla fuck.

70
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm not fuckin' sitting here
dancing around

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,680
your super-theories

72
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,808
that a fuckin' super-sniper's
down there, bro.

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,322
No fuckin' way a Haji
sticks around this long.

74
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,601
You shittin' me?

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
I'm fuckin' hot as shit.

76
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,806
My balls have
melted into one fuckin' ball...

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,360
Later you're on duty,

78
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,640
you're gonna pry these apart,
all right?

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Oh, yeah,
if I can fuckin' find it.

80
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,280
And you're gonna
fuckin' like it, too.

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,440
I shoulda joined
the fuckin' Air Force.

82
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
No, you're too fuckin' big
for the Air Force.

83
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,640
You'd bring
the whole thing down.

84
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,482
Hey, I'm serious, man...
get down.

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,364
I'm serious, too.
I'm goin' down there,

86
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,565
grabbing that guy's radio,

87
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,280
comin' back up here,

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,800
and we are getting
the fuck gone.

89
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,450
Yeah, Roger that.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,445
Comm' check.

91
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,325
Yup, yup, check, check.

92
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,410
Where've you gone?

93
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Oh, yep.

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,606
<i>Movement?</i>

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,084
You look fuckin'
rigid as shit...

96
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,124
<i>How's that one ball?</i>

97
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,722
<i>Oh, real nice, real smart!</i>

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,682
<i>You'll always be
number one to me, my man.</i>

99
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,888
You got eyes on that wall?

100
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,129
<i>I got eyes on your ass...</i>

101
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,284
<i>Uh, shake that booty.</i>

102
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,245
Uh, yeah, there it is.

103
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,090
Uh... Ooh, there we go,
there it is.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,764
I think your tampon
just fell out.

105
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,605
<i>Damn right,
that'd usually cost you 25 bucks.</i>

106

<i>You're clear 360.</i>

109
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,205
Keep them eyes open.

110
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,686
Just watch my six.

111
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,485
<i>Roger that.</i>

112
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,484
Yep, we're fuckin' solo
out here.

113
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,886
Lonely as fuck.

114
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Fuck.

<i>Man, this fuckin' thing's

<i>You have got
to get rid of that shit.</i>

123
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,446
It was Dean's.

124
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,242
<i>Fuck Dean.
Dean was a bitch.</i>

125
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,241
Yeah, fuck Dean.

126
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,206

What?

131
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,800
Talk to me, man, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

132
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,846
<i>Ize. They are headshots, man.</i>

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600

134
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,205

sending in the blind.

361
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,320
<i>But maybe he is just unconscious.</i>

362
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,169
I got a man down!

363
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,560
<i>Shall I make sure?</i>

364
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,042
I got a sniper,
I got an enemy sniper...

365
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,080
Requesting medevac!

366
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,000
<i>Shall I shoot him in the head?</i>

367
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,160
I repeat, I repeat,
requesting...

368
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,969
<i>Does he have a wife? Children?</i>

369
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,084
<i>Will they enjoy a closed casket,
if I take his face off?</i>

370
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,566
All right, all right,
shut the fuck up, man.

371
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,048
All right stop, stop,
stop, stop.

372
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,211
Is there something
that you want?

373
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
<i>Yes.</i>

374
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,520
Well, I don't know nothin'.
I'm a buck sar'nt.

375
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,524
They don't tell me shit,
so... fuck you.

376
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,080
<i>That's not what I want.</i>

377
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,565
Oh, what do you want?

378
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,921
You want fuckin' twelve virgins
or somethin'?

379
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,410
<i>I want to get to know you.</i>

380
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,001
<i>I just want to get to know you.
Will you allow that?</i>

381
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,566
Hey, you're fucking with me.

382
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,247
<i>I was.</i>

383
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,484
<i>But you figured it out.</i>

384
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,090
<i>So now, let's be real.</i>

385
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,689
<i>It's just you and me out here.</i>

386
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,691
<i>So what do you say?</i>

387
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,526
Yeah, I'll talk to you.

388
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,888
<i>Good.</i>

389
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,081
<i>Where are you from?</i>

390
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,440
No, listen, I don't know
shit about you,

391
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,681
so why don't you go first?

392
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
<i>Me?</i>

393
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,170
<i>There is nothing to say.
No story.</i>

394
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,160
<i>Uh, you're the one
who wants to get chatty, bro.</i>

395
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,124
<i>Why ain't you saying anything?</i>

396
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
<i>Huh?</i>

397
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,891
<i>Okay. I'll start.</i>

398
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,491
<i>I am just...
a regular Iraqi man.</i>

399
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,001
<i>A civilian.</i>

400
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,770
A civilian, my ass.

401
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,124
Crack bang.

402
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,931
One, two, three, four, five...

403
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,160
Okay, one, two, three,
four, five...

404
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,920
One, two, three, four, five...
One, two, three, four, five...

405
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,320
Okay, one, two, three,
four, bang.

406
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,851
Four plus four...

407
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,801
Four plus four...
eight hundred plus...

408
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Okay.

409
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,722
Bullet... 45, 50, 60,
Sixty degree angle.

410
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,243
9... 950, 950 plus.

411
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,371
<i>That gives me, 1,500.</i>

412
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,361
Okay, okay.

413
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,521
At the wall, me, Matthews.

414
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,849
Crane, construction site,
trailers, flagpole.

415
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,440
<i>And you?</i>

416
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,686
What about me?

417
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,289
<i>Are you a regular American?</i>

418
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,441
<i>Uh, yeah. Regular Joe.</i>

419
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,806
<i>A regular G.I. Joe...</i>

420
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,083
<i>Army ranger or marine?</i>

421
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,049
You worked
in our fuckin' ranks, huh?

422
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,881
Had our training,
then you fuckin' backstab us.

423
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,209
Look, these fuckin' guys
were building pipelines.

424
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,884
Building up your fuckin' economy,
you asshole.

425
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,246
<i>Pipelines, huh?</i>

426
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,683
<i>For our economy?</i>

427
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,410
Yeah, that's fuckin' money.

428
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,644
Infrastructure,
education, schools.

429
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,209
These guys
were fucking contractors.

430
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,966
Not here to fight.

431
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,971
War's over, bro.

432
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
<i>Bro?</i>

433
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,441
Whatever, man.

434
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,280
<i>It's an interesting
choice of words.</i>

435
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,726
<i>And yet I disagree with you,
bro.</i>

436
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,924
<i>The war's not over...</i>

437
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,362
<i>Definitely not for you.</i>

438
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,840
You say... you say a lot
of fuckin' fancy words.

439
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,651
What are you, Haji Shakespeare
or some shit?

440
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
<i>Shakespeare?</i>

441
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,204
<i>Military lingo is all poetry.</i>

442
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,530
<i>Battle rattle, ghetto grip...
Johnny Jihad, friendly fire...</i>

443
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,126
<i>It's your turn, Isaac.</i>

444
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,365
<i>Or should I say Ize?</i>

445
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
What?

446
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,880
What... what do you mean,
it's my turn?

447
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,920
What do you want me to say?

448
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,560
<i>Tell me where you're from.</i>

449
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
<i>Where's your family?</i>

450
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,450
I'm not talking
'bout fucking family.

451
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,440
Oh, God!

452
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,480
<i>Okay, then tell</i>

453
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,483
<i>about your brothers and sisters
at arms.</i>

454
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,090
That's a negative, too, bro.

455
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,120
<i>I don't want
any military secrets.</i>

456
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,440
<i>Just stories.</i>

457
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Eat a dick.

458
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,200
<i>I will shoot
Matthews if you don't talk.</i>

459
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
Go ahead.

460
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
<i>Yes?</i>

461
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,010
<i>He is your second loss...</i>

462
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,765
<i>first, Dean, now Matthews.</i>

463
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,125
How the fuck
do you know about Dean?

464
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,400
<i>Keep talking.</i>

465
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,561
No. Fuck you. How?

466
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,880
<i>You carry his scope around.</i>

467
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,931
<i>What was it your sergeant said?</i>

468
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,925
<i>A dead man's scope?</i>

469
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,885
How old are you?

470
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,129
<i>Just tell me something, Isaac.</i>

471
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,490
Tell me about your comrades.

472
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,566
Or I will shoot Matthews' face off.

473
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Okay.

474
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,610
Uh... yeah.

475
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,610
Uh, we, uh, we play ball.

476
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,240
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

477
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
Uh...

478
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,884
Yeah, me and the squad.
We, uh, play in the afternoon.

479
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,720
Uh, get baked in the Iraqi sun.

480
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,726
Uh, nothing else to do.

481
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,560
No war to fight.

482
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,167
<i>Baked... what does that mean?</i>

483
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,401
Baked, like, you know, tanned.

484
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,241
<i>Go on.</i>

485
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
Go on?

486
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,880
<i>What about Sergeant Matthews,</i>

487
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,731
<i>did he get baked?</i>

488
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,441
<i>Did Dean?</i>

489
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,400
I ain't talking
about fuckin' Dean with you.

490
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,970
You dirty fuckin' Haji.

491
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,205
<i>If I were you,
I would start talking, Isaac.</i>

492
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,411
<i>Tell me about Dean.</i>

493
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,800
What's the obsession, huh?

494
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
What the fuck?

495
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,680
<i>It's interesting to me.</i>

496
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,926
<i>The bond between you
and your brothers.</i>

497
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,010
<i>And I will shoot Matthews
if you do not speak.</i>

498
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,530
<i>I'm looking at him right now.</i>

499
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,645
<i>It would be so easy
to tear his face off.</i>

500
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,448
<i>His family won't even
recognize him.</i>

501
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,049
<i>Is that what you want, Ize?</i>

502
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,963
<i>You should just answer
my questions.</i>

503
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,449
All right, all right.

504
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,323
<i>So, tell me about Dean's scope.</i>

505
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
Oh, shit.

506
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,762
Oh... Oh, fuck.

507
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,200
<i>I can see it
at the base of the wall there.</i>

508
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,124
<i>Why do you keep it?</i>

509
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,041
Fuck.

510
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,480
<i>Now, you said it's broken.</i>

511
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,040
<i>Why would you carry around
a broken scope, Isaac?</i>

512
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,526
Oh, shut the fuck up, man.
How's this end?

513
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,445
How the fuck this end?

514
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,321
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

515
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,328
I said, how the fuck's it end?
What's the fuckin' endgame?

516
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,640
<i>There's no endgame.</i>

517
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,848
<i>I'm just enjoying
our conversation.</i>

518
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,440
No, stop!
Fuckin' stop, all right?

519
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,363
You're not gonna get to know me.

520
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,920
<i>I feel
like I know you better already.</i>

521
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,365
No, you fucking don't!

522
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,006
You don't know shit!

523
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,603
<i>You're dehydrated, I know that.</i>

524
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,963
<i>That's why I aimed
at your water bottle.</i>

525
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,920
No, you didn't...

526
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,280
You fuckin'
was trying to hit me.

527
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,090
<i>No, the water bottle.</i>

528
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,243
Nobody's that fuckin' accurate.

529
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,086
<i>And your antenna.</i>

530
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,524
No fucking way.

531
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,281
And your knee.

532
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,800
I know the popliteal vein
in your leg

533
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,240
carries enough blood
that no matter what kind

534
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,280
of bandaging you have,

535
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,522
you will still be sitting
in a puddle of plasma.

536
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,404
<i>You're feeling fatigued,
lightheaded.</i>

537
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,486
<i>And you will bleed out
before nightfall.</i>

538
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,722
What the fuck is going on
with this shit...

539
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,131
you fucker?

540
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,123
You psychotic motherfucker.

541
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,649
What do you want from me, huh?

542
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,680
Oh, fuck!

543
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,371
Fuckin' flank me?

544
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,762
Fuckin' Haji.

545
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,728
Hey, where'd you
keep fuckin' going, huh?

546
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,889
No, no, you're tryin' to fuckin'
circle my wall, ain't you?

547
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
Huh?

548
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,607
Tryin' to circle round my wall,
motherfucker?

549
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,091
<i>That's ironic.</i>

550
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,010
Yeah, I'm right, huh?

551
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,164
<i>You say "my wall".</i>

552
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,126
<i>The very wall your country
came here to knock down,</i>

553
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,761
<i>you now try desperately
to keep from falling.</i>

554
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,127
Oh, you find that
fuckin' funny, huh?

555
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,162
<i>You should know:
that wall you are hiding behind,</i>

556
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,284
<i>was actually part of a school.</i>

557
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,240
Yeah, well, I'll piss on it.

558
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,040
That's what I think
about your fuckin' wall.

559
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,641
<i>You're hiding
in the shadow of Islam.</i>

560
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,531
No, I'm hiding in the shadow
of fuckin' death.

561
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,890
I'm in the fuckin' shadow
of death.

562
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,081
Nice try.

563
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,450
That's gotta be a 20 mag...

564
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,810
So all the guys...

565
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,410
it's gotta be a 20 mag.

566
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,405
One in Matthews, Three in me...

567
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,290
That 7.62...

568
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,481
That 7.62 by 51 NATO round
is U.S. issued?

569
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,845
Hey. Motherfucker.

570
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,480
You wanna talk?

571
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,688
Come on, man.
What's up?

572
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,720
<i>You want to know
the weapon I'm using?</i>

573
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
M-24?

574
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,051
Mark 11?

575
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,164
<i>I would prefer
an M96 Windrunner any day.</i>

576
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,810
I thought we were being honest?

577
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,524
I know you're using a Mark 11.

578
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,690
<i>No, you believe
that's what I'm using.</i>

579
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,209
<i>But you don't know
anything for certain.</i>

580
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,650
<i>You don't know shit.</i>

581
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,885
<i>Is that how you say it?</i>

582
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,645
<i>You don't know shit?</i>

583
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,000
Say that again...

584
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,640
I can't hear you.

585
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,521
<i>Okay...</i>

586
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
you...

587
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,720
don't...

588
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,163
know... shit.

589
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,122
<i>I don't know shit, huh?</i>

590
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,125
<i>Well, go on. Please.</i>

591
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,051
<i>Educate me, man.</i>

592
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,044
<i>Come on, I'm listenin'...</i>

593
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,771
<i>You Americans.</i>

594
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,724
<i>You think you know it all.</i>

595
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,526
<i>You think it's simple.</i>

596
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,725
<i>That I am your enemy.</i>

597
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,087
<i>But we are not so different,
you and I.</i>

598
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,242
<i>Yeah, 'cept
I ain't a fuckin' terrorist.</i>

599
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,331
<i>And you think I am?</i>

600
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,083
You are the one who has come
to another man's country,

601
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,321
Camouflaged yourself
in his land,

602
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,847
in his soil.

603
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,524
No fuckin' way...

604
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,640
<i>From where I'm sitting,</i>

605
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,283
<i>you look very much
like the terrorist.</i>

606
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,768
You're in the fuckin' trash?

607
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,330
<i>No fucking way...</i>

608
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,444
'less he's a pro.

609
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,967
You're him.

610
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,165
You're Juba.

611
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,366
The ghost.

612
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,160
<i>A hundred men out there</i>

613
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,446
<i>call themselves Juba.</i>

614
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,286
<i>I'm just a man.</i>

615
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,927
35 U.S. casualties,
angel of death.

616
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,844
That's why they never find you.

617
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,441
Damn.

618
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,724
You must've been days
in that fuckin' shit heap.

619
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,360
So, we trained you, obviously.

620
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,486
Learn how to shoot,

621
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,169
trajectory, zeroing the rifle,
no reloads between shots.

622
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,602
Learn all that shit
and then betrayed us?

623
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,360
<i>Depends on the angle</i>

624
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,440
<i>you look at it from.</i>

625
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,651
Only one angle.

626
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,922
<i>Yes, as I'd expect you to say.</i>

627
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,520
No.

628
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,970
Tell me you're my enemy, fine,
I'll respect that.

629
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,085
We kill, We kill.

630
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,200
But say you're my friend...
and shoot me in the back?

631
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,681
The only angle I see
is a fuckin' snake.

632
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,920
<i>But if this friend
shoots you in the back,</i>

633
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,163
<i>and you survive,
is it okay to shoot him back?</i>

634
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,608
<i>I want you
to tell me something, Isaac.</i>

635
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,725
<i>Why are you here?</i>

636
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,168
<i>Why are you still here, Isaac?</i>

637
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,402
<i>How many tours
have you done now?</i>

638
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,169
<i>Why do you keep coming back?</i>

639
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,800
<i>Is it because of Dean?</i>

640
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,320
Please, God...

641
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,608
How the fuck did I get here?

642
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,521
<i>Is that why?</i>

643
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,485
<i>Be honest with me, Isaac.</i>

644
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,805
<i>Is it because of Dean?</i>

645
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,682
Just tell me... How...?

646
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,930
How'd you know that name?

647
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,128
<i>Tell me one thing about him.</i>

648
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,161
<i>Just one thing.</i>

649
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,201
We were
from 'round about the same area.

650
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,366
His cousins...

651
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,249
went to same school as me.

652
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,370
My dad knows his...

653
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,445
Seen his kid.

654
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,127
Held him.

655
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,244
More than Dean's ever done.

656
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,240
Clem works
by the fuckin' Stop n' Shop...

657
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,720
<i>Clem?</i>

658
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,405
Clementine, his wife.

659
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,248
No fuckin' way. I can't...
I can't go back to that.

660
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,204
Fuckin' day in, day out shit.

661
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,328
And them, looking at me.

662
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,406
And they would.

663
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,682
They'd look at me, and they'd...

664
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,841
They'd see me.

665
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,487
Fuck...

666
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,760
Nope.

667
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,647
I can't go. I can't.

668
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,486
I can't do that.
Can't go back.

669
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,520
This...

670
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,687
Oh, God.

671
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,361
Fuck it.

672
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,044
You happy now, huh?

673
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,250
Now you know everything.

674
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,088
You're fucked up, you know that?

675
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,126
<i>Why is that?</i>

676
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,448
'Cause you gotta mess
with my fuckin' head, too?

677
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,600
<i>Isaac, when this is over,</i>

678
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,963
<i>the skin will be cut
from your face.</i>

679
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,408
<i>Your eyes will be gouged.</i>

680
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,327
Fuckin' shoot me, you prick.

681
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,764
<i>Your lying tongue
will be stapled to your chest.</i>

682
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,926
Just fucking shoot me, man,
and get it over with.

683
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,160
<i>But I will
let them find your body.</i>

684
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,568
Fuck it,
I might just shoot myself.

685
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,683
All right, you asshole.
Where are you?

686
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,400
<i>That was foolish, Isaac.</i>

687
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,811
<i>I could've shot you.
I could've easily shot you.</i>

688
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,560
<i>Ize!</i>

689
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,967
<i>I just want to have
a conversation with you, Isaac.</i>

690
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,202
<i>Why are you trying
to get yourself killed?</i>

691
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,930
Oh, fuck.

692
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,200
<i>Isaac.</i>

693
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,481
<i>Isaac.</i>

694
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,400
<i>The radio you
risked your life for? It's dead.</i>

695
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,331
Are you dead, too?

696
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,045
You missed.
I'm still here.

697
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,610
You're not that fucking good.

698
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,165
<i>Ha! He speaks!</i>

699
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,528
<i>Tear up the planks!
Here, here!</i>

700
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,360
<i>It is the beating
of his hideous heart.</i>

701
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,480
What's that, one
of your gay-ass Haji poems?

702
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,560
<i>American.</i>

703
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,524
<i>Tell Tale Heart.</i>

704
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,171
<i>Edgar Allen Poe.</i>

705
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,966
I didn't catch a fuckin' word
you're sayin', man.

706
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,016
<i>Edgar Allen Poe. Don't you...?</i>

707
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,280
What's wrong
with your fuckin' radio, man?

708
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,200
What is that?

709
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,960
<i>You must've studied his work.</i>

710
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,165
<i>He's an American great.</i>

711
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,686
<i>His writing is really...</i>

712
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,251
What is it?

713
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,690
Don't look at fuckin' me.

714
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,840
<i>Did you know
that he was an orphan?</i>

715
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,604
<i>He tried to be a soldier,
but didn't get very...</i>

716
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,327
Shane...

717
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,842
Shane, that you?

718
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,000
<i>He was
a better writer than a soldier.</i>

719
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,041
<i>Once upon a midnight dreary,</i>

720
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,281
<i>while I pondered
weak and weary...</i>

721
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,880
<i>Sar'nt Matthews!</i>

722
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,645
<i>Suddenly there came a tapping...</i>

723
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,000
<i>Is that you?</i>

724
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,003
<i>rapping at my chamber door.</i>

725
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,049
<i>In there stepped
a stately raven,</i>

726
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,841
<i>from the saintly days of yore.</i>

727
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,600
<i>Take thy beak
from out of my heart,</i>

728
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,571
<i>and take thy form
from off my door.</i>

729
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,604
<i>Quoth the Raven,
"Nevermore."</i>

730
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,363
<i>Or perhaps you would
prefer Robert Frost?</i>

731
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,965
<i>"A voice said, 'Look me in the stars.</i>

732
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,320
<i>And tell me truly'..."</i>

733
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,600
I see you, man!

734
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,720
<i>"Men of earth...</i>

735
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,520
I knew you were taking a nap!

736
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,206
<i>If all the soul-and-body scars...</i>

737
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,360
<i>I found that fucking weasel!</i>

738
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,560
<i>were not
too much to pay for birth."</i>

739
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,644
<i>12 o'clock.
In the fucking trash heap!</i>

740
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,482
<i>His poetry is so beautiful.</i>

741
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,725
So, uh... you studied, huh?

742
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,491
Uh... studied, uh...

743
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,482
you studied here or abroad?

744
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,160
<i>Like, um...</i>

745
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,526
<i>I know they got those, uh...</i>

746
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,002
<i>study-abroad programs
or whatnot?</i>

747
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,247
<i>Hey!</i>

748
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,560
<i>A shot from that distance,</i>

749
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,042
<i>he's gotta be at least
25, Thirty feet up, man!</i>

750
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,249
<i>He's over 1,500 meters,
1,550 maybe.</i>

751
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,760
Right?

752
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,840
Huh?

753
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,008
Why ain't you talking, man?
Come on, you there?

754
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,321
Oh, fuck.

755
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,560
Fuck.

756
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,601
Are you there, man?

757
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,770
It's just, you know a lot
about books and shit.

758
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,480
I just thought,

759
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,080
I might even learn
some Haji Shakespeare

760
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,160
or some shit.

761
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,725
<i>Shakespeare?
Is that the only poet you know?</i>

762
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,165
<i>I studied English.</i>

763
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,166
Boy, you, uh...

764
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,449
you minor in sniping
or somethin'?

765
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,604
<i>I was a teacher in Baghdad.</i>

766
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,485
<i>But a bomb hit my school.</i>

767
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,483
<i>You got it? Shane?</i>

768
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,891
<i>I got shrapnel
in my left elbow, still hurts.</i>

769
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,561
<i>Fucking trash heap,
behind the white trailer.</i>

770
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:17,762
<i>1550.</i>

771
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,880
<i>It reminds me
of the students I lost.</i>

772
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,726
<i>Come on, baby!</i>

773
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,085
<i>Come on, baby, let's do this!</i>

774
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,401
<i>Is that why you shoot
civilian contractors?</i>

775
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,920
<i>As the scripture says,</i>

776
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,286
<i>an eye for an eye.</i>

777
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,565
That's bullshit.

778
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,088
You're no more
religious than I am, man.

779
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,531
That's just a fuckin' excuse
to shoot up some Americans.

780
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,805
You're good, man!

781
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,282
Just keep going slow, baby,
real slow!

782
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,480
<i>Is that a question, Isaac?</i>

783
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,369
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast!

784
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,201
Yeah. That's right.

785
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,050
<i>See, that's what I don't get.</i>

786
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,484
<i>How does
an educated person like you</i>

787
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,484
<i>become a fuckin' terrorist?</i>

788
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,840
<i>You tell me.</i>

789
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,009
Oh, shut your fuckin' mouth.

790
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,125
<i>You're fading, Isaac.</i>

791
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,848
You like to hear yourself talk,
don't you?

792
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,609
I'm fuckin' fantastic.

793
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,804
I'm chillin' like a villain baby.

794
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,443
<i>You are not fantastic.</i>

795
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,331
<i>You have no water.</i>

796
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,490
<i>You're dehydrated.</i>

797
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,646
<i>The sun is...</i>

798
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,411
<i>the sun's baking you.</i>

799
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,690
<i>You're bleeding to death.</i>

800
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,160
Cap'.

801
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
Cap'.

802
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,606
Captain Albright.

803
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,800
<i>What's that?</i>

804
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,040
Our legend.

805
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,164
Trained me.
Trained Dean, too.

806
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,480
He's coming for us.

807
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,520
<i>For your bodies.</i>

808
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,728
We don't report in,
he's on your ass.

809
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,040
<i>Judging from your
and Matthews' performances,</i>

810
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,120
<i>I'm not concerned.</i>

811
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,290
Fuck you.
He's coming for us.

812
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,851
He trained us...

813
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,444
trained us to survive.

814
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,124
<i>And won't he be disappointed.</i>

815
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,771
<i>You didn't win shit.</i>

816
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,880
<i>You hear me, motherfucker?
You didn't win shit!</i>

817
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:58,966
From a place you will not see
comes a sound you will not hear.

818
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,966
Just a flash of fucking light.

819
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,281
Boom.

820
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,642
<i>When I'm done
with you and Matthews,</i>

821
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,966
<i>everyone will know
who the winner is.</i>

822
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,800
<i>Shane!</i>

823
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,243
<i>Hold still, man, hold still!</i>

824
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,640
<i>Should I take
Sergeant Matthews' head off?</i>

825
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,720
Shit.

826
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,041
Hold still, man!

827
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,560
Don't fuckin' move!

828
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,600
<i>Will you
take something from Matthews?</i>

829
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,841
<i>Like your broken scope?</i>

830
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,689
<i>He's in my crosshairs right now.</i>

831
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,361
<i>I've got eyes on him.</i>

832
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,560
<i>What?</i>

833
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,328
<i>I don't
make empty threats, Isaac.</i>

834
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,083
<i>I'm going to tear his face off.</i>

835
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait...

836
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,641
I carry around the scope...

837
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,046
because it reminds me...

838
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,410
of why I can't hold a...
hold a rifle again.

839
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,960
Okay?

840
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,921
You listening to me?

841
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,966
Dean dropped it...

842
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,480
the scope... in the line of duty.

843
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,560
He fell over trying
to pick it up, and I missed it.

844
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,051
I missed the sniper.
Okay?

845
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,400
You fuckin' listening to me?!

846
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,040
I didn't see him.
That's how he got hit.

847
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,120
It was my fault!

848
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,443
Goddamn it,
you fuckin' listening?!

849
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,049
Slower, man.
Slower, slower!

850
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,840
<i>Slower what?</i>

851
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,121
<i>What's going on?</i>

852
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,570
Who are you talking to?

853
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,840
Who am I talking to?

854
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,728
<i>I'm talking to fucking God!</i>

855
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,690
<i>He's 90 feet up!</i>

856
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,844
<i>In the trash somewhere!</i>

857
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,130
<i>I don't fucking know.</i>

858
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,121
I'm sorry, man!

859
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,490
<i>Give me, max plus four...</i>

860
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,165
<i>six mils right!</i>

861
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,121
Send when ready!

862
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,840
Did you get him?

863
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,000
Please tell me you got him!

864
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,407
Oh, fuck!

865
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,044
You bastard, you fucker!

866
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,448
Just fuckin' let him go,
you piece of shit!

867
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,604
Shane! Get up man!

868
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,080
He ain't a threat
to you anymore,

869
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,571
just fuckin' let him go!

870
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,240
<i>Goddammit. Fuck!</i>

871
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,971
<i>Don't fucking stop,
don't fucking stop!</i>

872
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,406
Just like that,
just like that baby, let's go!

873
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,806
Fuck, come on, man!

874
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,360
Come on!

875
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,007
Keep comin', man,
you're almost there!

876
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,840
Come on!

877
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,331
Just like that, man!

878
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,041
Reach for me.

879
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,166
Reach for me!

880
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,287
Wake up... wake...

881
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,967
Wake up.

882
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,085
I wanna go home.

883
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,771
I wanna go fuckin' home,
motherfucker!

884
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,408
<i>So go. Walk away.</i>

885
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,804
You'll just fuckin' shoot me.

886
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,281
<i>No, I won't.</i>

887
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,761
Yes, you fuckin' will.

888
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,767
Why wouldn't you?

889
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,040
<i>Because that's not really</i>

890
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,121

Enemy sniper.

I tried shooting back, but the bullet
went right through Dean.
