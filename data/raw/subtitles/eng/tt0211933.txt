1
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,150
<i>People die.</i>

2
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:56,019
<i>You may think you can
control when or where</i>

3
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,187
<i>or how it happens, but you can't.</i>

4
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:05,392
<i>When your number is up,
your number is up,</i>

5
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:08,663
<i>and there's nothing
anyone can do about it.</i>

6
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:09,668
<i>Charge.</i>

7
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,681
It's over, Jack.

8
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:19,705
<i>I've lost patients before,</i>

9
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,773
<i>seen them die on my table,
under my knife.</i>

10
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,716
I'm sorry, Jack.

11
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:29,415
<i>But I've never lost a friend.</i>

12
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,017
<i>I lost Clayton at 6:32 a.m.</i>

13
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:36,961
<i>on Thursday,
the first day of November.</i>

14
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:44,866
<i>There's not much I can
tell you about that day.</i>

15
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:46,838
<i>I don't know if he
woke up that morning</i>

16
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:50,070
<i>thinking he might die.</i>

17
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:54,706
<i>I only know the day started
much like any other day,</i>

18
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:57,649
<i>and that he was probably thinking of her.</i>

19
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:02,076
Hey.

20
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:03,275
Hey.

21
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:07,313
What were you doing under there?

22
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,088
Just thinking.

23
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:13,819
What about?

24
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:16,021
Wait, let me guess.

25
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:21,932
You were thinking about
making love to me all morning

26
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:24,766
and then taking me out
for a really big breakfast.

27
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:27,363
- Close.
- Yeah?

28
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:33,342
Actually, I was...

29
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:36,212
picturing you soaking wet
with all of your clothes on.

30
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:37,682
- No. Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

31
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:39,150
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,510
- Dah. Ah.
- Oh.

33
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:13,518
Damn it.

34
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:16,420
All right, hang on.

35
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,355
Tell me if it hurts, okay?

36
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:21,023
- Ah!
- Shit.

37
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:23,460
You're such an asshole.

38
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,623
- Come here.
- I didn't scare you, did I?

39
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,326
You did.

40
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,494
There we go.

41
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,696
How's it look?

42
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:32,261
You'll live.

43
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,607
Thank you.

44
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:48,755
Have you seen my pager?

45
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,881
- Yep.
- Ah.

46
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,892
Wait. Hang on.

47
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,724
- There you go.
- Thanks.

48
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:56,785
I don't care, Tommy.

49
00:05:56,864 --> 00:05:58,525
They open at 6,
we open at 5, all right?

50
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:59,531
There are jobs at stake, man.

51
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,431
Just get it done.

52
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:04,471
Then we'll talk to them at
the Halloween thing tonight.

53
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:05,835
Yeah, all right. I'll be in soon.

54
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,074
Got time for a little breakfast?

55
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:12,736
You know I can't.

56
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:15,338
You know, share a paper,
trade sections?

57
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:17,576
Baby, I'm late as it is.

58
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:20,415
I don't even know
what section you like, Clay.

59
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:41,767
I deserve my happily
ever after, too.

60
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:45,471
I know you do.

61
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:49,243
And I'm going to tell her, soon.

62
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:50,977
I promise.

63
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,077
Have a good day.

64
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:57,885
You, too.

65
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,528
Good morning, Mom.

66
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,338
Don't forget we're
meeting the board at 2.

67
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,467
I can't do 2.

68
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:51,738
I'm meeting with Dr. Harper
this afternoon.

69
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:52,744
Just be there.

70
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:54,303
These Japanese companies
are ruthless.

71
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,780
We have to close this merger.

72
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,613
Is this about your old man?

73
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:00,380
Is it about him?

74
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:02,183
Jesus, I'm not going through this again, Jack.

75
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:04,416
Honestly, he would
want you to tell her.

76
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:05,719
No, my father would want me

77
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:07,419
to stop fishing
in the middle of the day

78
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:08,961
and go back to work, all right?

79
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,327
If he knew what I was doing
with Sam, he'd disown me,

80
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:12,456
lying to my mom like this.

81
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:15,057
He'd throw me in the fucking river.

82
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:18,571
I want you to
take a good look around you, Clay.

83
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,005
You own half of this city.

84
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:24,976
You're creating jobs,
you're saving companies.

85
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:27,809
I think you've more than
filled his shoes, you know?

86
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:30,850
My dad's feet were four sizes bigger
than mine, Jack.

87
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,351
I can't even fill his socks.

88
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,978
Look, I got the rings, didn't I?

89
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:36,079
I got the license.

90
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:38,249
No, no, no, no.
It's not that difficult.

91
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:40,384
You set a date and you just do it.

92
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,825
It's not that easy, either.

93
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,920
- I mean, marriage...
- Look, she's your mother.

94
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:47,660
You tell her and, I swear to you,
she'll be happy.

95
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:49,292
You don't know my mother.

96
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:50,597
Listen, thanks for the fishing lesson.

97
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,899
- I'm leaving, all right?
- All right, man.

98
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:54,133
Look, just...
just come on with me.

99
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:59,477
You know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits

100
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:01,013
there are in this country?

101
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,311
I mean, a hard-working
doctor is trying...

102
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:04,816
Are we going to go
through this again, Jack?

103
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:06,648
- Well, look, I've got...
- Four. Yes, I know.

104
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,244
All for trying to save people's lives.

105
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:09,686
It's a disgrace.

106
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:10,984
Well, you know why they sue us?

107
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:12,457
I have a very busy day.

108
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:13,925
Please.

109
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:17,896
It's because they don't know
what to do with their grief.

110
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:22,401
It's because people
need someone to blame.

111
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:25,666
It's because of patients like you

112
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:30,073
who cannot accept the facts.

113
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:31,735
Come on in.

114
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:34,610
Get acquainted. Lie down.

115
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:38,812
Only because you're my friend.

116
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,046
I'm your doctor.

117
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:48,357
Get comfortable.

118
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:57,126
How's it feel?

119
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:58,796
Not so bad.

120
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:03,309
These, Clay, are the facts.

121
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:07,176
When I open up your chest
and remove your heart,

122
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:12,708
it is a very real possibility that you will die
right here on this table.

123
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,653
And if the transplant is successful,

124
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:20,682
there is a 50% chance
that you'll be dead in 10 years.

125
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,924
The clock's ticking.

126
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:26,591
So it's tough love today, huh?

127
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,725
You think this is a joke?

128
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:33,496
Look at that.

129
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,040
Hold it.

130
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:37,508
That's surgical steel.

131
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:40,171
A hundredth of an inch thick.

132
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:45,310
That thing will slice through you
as if you weren't even there.

133
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:49,783
Picture it, Clay.

134
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,790
Picture the incision.

135
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,590
Imagine what it will be like.

136
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:00,530
I need you to be ready.

137
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:05,028
I need you to be prepared.

138
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:08,438
You get your house
in order, just in case.

139
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:14,673
Tell your mother, marry the girl,
and live your life.

140
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:19,684
You might not have much of it left.

141
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:21,550
Okay?

142
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:23,418
Jack...

143
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,821
saddle up.

144
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,155
Wait, I thought we didn't
have anything until later.

145
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:29,092
No, Riordan's cabbage
from this morning,

146
00:11:29,162 --> 00:11:30,094
he's in the ICU bleeding.

147
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:31,562
He took off for
the fucking vineyard,

148
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:33,496
so, uh... Hey, Clay.

149
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,091
How about letting us
have all your money

150
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:36,328
so that we could retire?

151
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,337
You wouldn't mind
doing that, would you?

152
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,337
No. You know me.

153
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,397
Go ahead, take it all.

154
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:42,941
What a guy.

155
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,876
Remember what I said, Clay.

156
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:47,470
No regrets.

157
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:48,479
Jack!

158
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:50,345
The clock's ticking.

159
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,349
Jack, what are you doing?

160
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:53,409
Let's go.
Let's go, Jack.

161
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:55,954
Come on!

162
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:58,582
<i>Promise me you'll kiss me all over.</i>

163
00:11:58,658 --> 00:12:00,182
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

164
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,194
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

165
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:03,957
<i>What's wrong with right now?</i>

166
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,429
Well, I can't. I'm...

167
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:08,763
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

168
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:11,235
You look beautiful, Sam.

169
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:12,931
I do?

170
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:14,837
Yeah, you do.

171
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:17,206
I should tell you that more often.

172
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:21,575
What's wrong?

173
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:24,139
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:26,276
I didn't know she was going
to be here, all right?

175
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:27,877
If I turn around, she'll see.

176
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:30,320
This is getting boring, Clay.

177
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,550
Uh-huh.

178
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,355
We're going to have to
discuss this merger later.

179
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:35,917
I feel sick.

180
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:39,898
You're not supposed
to make me feel sick.

181
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:42,695
Thought you'd run off and left me.

182
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,828
You remember Dr. Neyer,
don't you?

183
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:45,837
Hello, Clayton.

184
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:46,895
Good to see you again.

185
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:48,201
We've already been through this.

186
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:50,175
Dr. Harper's my surgeon.
I've already told you...

187
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:53,144
I know, but Jonathan
leads the field, remember?

188
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:55,272
Yeah, well, like I said before,

189
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:57,316
I have a surgeon.

190
00:12:57,384 --> 00:13:00,979
Now, I know he's been
on the donor list for a year, Lilith,

191
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:03,488
but that's completely
normal for his type.

192
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:08,186
O-negatives like you and your son
always wait a little longer.

193
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:10,752
It just means
you're special, that's all.

194
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,263
Excuse me.

195
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,095
I don't think you're listening
to what I'm saying...

196
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,464
Although, since he has
a cardiomyopathy

197
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:16,797
of undetermined etiology...

198
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,770
Hey.

199
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:19,862
I'm sitting right here.

200
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,340
You want to talk
about me, talk to me.

201
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,877
- Clay.
- It's fine, Lilith.

202
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:28,210
You and Dr. Harper
have obviously become friends.

203
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:30,306
He was on call when you had
your first attack.

204
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:32,180
He saved your life.

205
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:34,345
I get the attachment. Really, I do.

206
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:37,686
But your mother and I
have been friends for 15 years.

207
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:40,248
My hands have been
inside presidents.

208
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:43,694
Don't you think I might at least
deserve the time of day?

209
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:46,926
You want to be operated on
by the best surgeon possible.

210
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,833
Don't you, Clay?

211
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:51,165
Good.

212
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:54,271
Now let's talk about the party tonight.

213
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:57,937
<i>No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.</i>

214
00:13:58,011 --> 00:13:59,569
<i>Now see, that is where
you're wrong.</i>

215
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:01,739
<i>I just don't see
the growth in leadership.</i>

216
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:03,749
<i>That's why this whole
Beresford Capital business</i>

217
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:04,943
<i>scares me so much.</i>

218
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,815
<i>Now look, are my numbers
wrong here?</i>

219
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:09,548
<i>Because if the Shimotomo merger
does not go through soon,</i>

220
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:11,715
<i>then that entire firm is in a lot of trouble.</i>

221
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,452
<i>That doesn't matter.</i>

222
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:16,188
<i>Look, I'm telling you,
Beresford better stay away from Shimotomo.</i>

223
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:17,490
<i>They're going to smile at your face,</i>

224
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,088
<i>and then they're going
to stab you in the back.</i>

225
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,189
<i>These guys are dangerous.</i>

226
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,733
<i>Trust me, I've seen them do it.</i>

227
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,860
<i>Anybody who gets
into business with them</i>

228
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:25,404
<i>is really asking for trouble.</i>

229
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:26,666
<i>Clay Beresford better know
what he's doing...</i>

230
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,674
Sir, they need you out there.

231
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,232
Thank you.

232
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:33,107
Welcome.

233
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:35,443
My daughter Tanya and my wife.

234
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,949
Happy Halloween.

235
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:52,026
Oh, here he is.

236
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,429
Whiz kid of Wall Street,

237
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,297
<i>Barron's Man of the Year at 22:</i>

238
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:57,199
Clayton Beresford, Jr.

239
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:02,606
Sir, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Inamoto and Mr. Waturi.

240
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:05,200
They're with our friends
at Shimotomo.

241
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:06,472
They're here to check up on you.

242
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:07,672
They know about your condition.

243
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,850
Mr. Waturi would like for you to know

244
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:16,650
how much respect he had
for your father,

245
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:17,849
Mr. Beresford.

246
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:19,915
He was quite a businessman.

247
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:21,756
<i>Yes, he was. Arigato.</i>

248
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,927
Mr. Waturi would also like to know
how you're feeling today.

249
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,761
Well, you'll have to tell Mr. Waturi
that I feel fabulous.

250
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,366
Please also tell him that I'm ready

251
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,964
to cut to the chase
whenever he is.

252
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,304
In the last eight quarters alone,

253
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:40,005
we bought and nurtured
over 600 companies.

254
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,811
We donate 80 million
charitable dollars per annum.

255
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:46,909
We provide over 16,000 jobs.

256
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:51,150
Mr. Waturi, my heart may be weak,
but my mind is strong.

257
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:52,714
And the only thing
you need to worry about

258
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,726
is which one of our 17 Niigata sakes

259
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:56,557
you'd like to enjoy with your dinner.

260
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:13,645
You're a ridiculous person,
you know that?

261
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,647
I don't know how you say that
with a straight face.

262
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:18,183
I mean, it's just... it's ridiculous.

263
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,741
I'm serious this time.

264
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,117
Let's just leave
the country, you know?

265
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,951
Go to China.

266
00:16:24,023 --> 00:16:25,490
Try our luck on the black market.

267
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:26,923
Why don't we just go outside?

268
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:28,688
We'll grab some random
person off the street,

269
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:29,693
drag them in here, you know...

270
00:16:29,762 --> 00:16:31,059
Sounds good to me.

271
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:33,929
Drag them in and cut them open.

272
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,662
Hey, whatever it takes, right?

273
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:38,169
You worry too much,
you know that?

274
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:39,728
Oh.

275
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:41,398
They'll find me one.

276
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,205
It just takes a little time, that's all.

277
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:47,769
You're not going to like this.

278
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:50,407
Straight to the king.

279
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:53,975
Oh, nice hand!

280
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:56,544
Boat. Jacks over eights.

281
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:58,818
Are you kidding me? Again?

282
00:16:58,892 --> 00:16:59,916
Come on, you're my son.

283
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:03,451
Can't hide anything
from your mother.

284
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,021
I think I need to go upstairs.

285
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:13,132
Don't stay up too late.

286
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,403
<i>Beresford Capital
opened higher today</i>

287
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:22,414
<i>after their announcement of the Dirasonic
acquisition over the weekend.</i>

288
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:24,473
<i>This bodes well for
the New York-based company,</i>

289
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,917
<i>especially since continued merger
discussions</i>

290
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:30,581
<i>with the Shimotomo Corporation
have left investors feeling anxious.</i>

291
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:33,524
<i>The Japanese government's investigation
into the Shimotomo family's</i>

292
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,424
<i>alleged links to organized crime</i>

293
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:37,395
<i>were well-documented last quarter.</i>

294
00:17:37,463 --> 00:17:39,556
<i>And with that merger still in question,</i>

295
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:43,693
<i>the Dirasonic acquisition will go a great way
to calming investors' concerns</i>

296
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,102
<i>that Beresford is playing with fire.</i>

297
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:47,969
<i>Still, rumors surrounding
the merger...</i>

298
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,441
I thought you might like a little drink.

299
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,070
Oh, maybe one. Thank you.

300
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:54,579
You're up late.

301
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:56,205
Something on your mind?

302
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,751
Got to get my family time in now.

303
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:02,014
You know, before some
smoothy whisks you away.

304
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,020
Yeah, right.

305
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,215
Like that's going to happen.

306
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,315
I don't know.

307
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:09,759
I think maybe somebody
had a little baby crush on Dr. Neyer.

308
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,922
I saw the way
you were looking at him.

309
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:13,989
I don't need anyone else.

310
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,797
I got you, Clay. Remember?

311
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,734
So, I closed Lambert today.

312
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,432
That means if we get
a hold of Mecter too,

313
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:23,873
that's 2,000 new jobs guaranteed,
plus new housing...

314
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:25,808
Do you remember him, Clay?

315
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:30,345
I remember bits.

316
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,440
Like what?

317
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,843
He died at Christmas.

318
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,685
Come on, don't you
remember anything else?

319
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:40,191
Sure, he was wearing a Santa suit,
and he fell down the stairs.

320
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,956
I mean from when he was alive, Clay.

321
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:47,695
I remember he smiled a lot.

322
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:55,900
Sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Beresford.

323
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:57,602
Uh, door was open.

324
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,076
What?

325
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:00,442
I just need your signature.

326
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:03,448
I know it's late,
but I want to get this out tonight.

327
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:05,484
Of course, Sam.
Thank you.

328
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:06,745
The Edmond "thank yous" are done,

329
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:07,911
your table's locked for the benefit,

330
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:09,545
and I put you down for the roast beef.

331
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:10,816
I know it's your favorite.

332
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,154
You're too good to me, Sam.

333
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:20,191
Well, if that will be all,
I... should be heading home.

334
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:22,200
- Good night, Mrs. Beresford.
- Night.

335
00:19:22,268 --> 00:19:23,565
Mr. Beresford.

336
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:38,577
Sam!

337
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,611
- Sam.
- I'm tired, all right?

338
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:44,884
I just want to go home.

339
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:46,686
Actually, fuck it.

340
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,989
You got me hiding
my engagement ring, Clay.

341
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,893
What is wrong with you?

342
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:52,157
- Will you come under the umbrella?
- No.

343
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:53,755
I've been engaged for six months.

344
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,802
No one even knows I'm dating anyone.

345
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,734
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

346
00:19:58,805 --> 00:19:59,794
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:01,931
If you won't even acknowledge me,
how do l...

348
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:05,102
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

349
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:08,841
For Christ's sake, Clay,
what are you doing?

350
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:10,109
You can't be in the rain.

351
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:12,845
Will you come inside
so we can get warm?

352
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,679
But she'll see.

353
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:23,721
Are you sure?

354
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:26,128
Unless you'd rather stand in the rain.

355
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:32,470
I should have done this
a long time ago.

356
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:36,034
She's not going to like it.

357
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,599
Come on.

358
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:42,544
I trusted you in my home, Samantha.

359
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:45,709
How could you come in here
and sneak around?

360
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:46,717
Please.

361
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,048
Clay, she lied to me to my face.

362
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,351
- She's a liar.
- I can't stay here forever.

363
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:53,051
I'm not asking you to.
Just... wait a bit.

364
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,150
Get to know each other first.

365
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:55,819
We've been together for a year.

366
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:57,795
Then wait till you're a little older.

367
00:20:57,864 --> 00:20:59,593
How old were you
when you got married?

368
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:02,065
It's different. I was too young.

369
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,626
Clay, you've got your
whole life ahead of you.

370
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,069
Do I?

371
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:13,773
If you walk out that door,
you've made your choice.

372
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:17,207
You're making it for me.

373
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:32,323
Sam, wait.

374
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:33,956
Oh... oh, God.

375
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:37,799
Okay. Um...

376
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,202
Nope.

377
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:41,570
Here we go.

378
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:43,632
Look what we've got here.

379
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:47,045
All right, sweetie.

380
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:49,843
All right. Open up, honey.

381
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,214
You okay?

382
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:53,217
You okay?

383
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:54,685
I am so sorry.

384
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:56,949
I just needed to be acknowledged, that's all.

385
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:59,082
I'm going to go away
and leave you two alone, okay?

386
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:01,319
Marry me.

387
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:02,861
What?

388
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:04,260
Tonight. Right now.

389
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,592
Marry me tonight.

390
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,496
But it's the middle of the night.

391
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,831
I don't want to wait anymore.
We've waited long enough.

392
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:14,004
Really?

393
00:22:18,644 --> 00:22:20,908
The minister is on his way,

394
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,347
and he's bringing
his wife as a witness.

395
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,817
How the hell did you
pull that one off?

396
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:29,081
Triple bypass last June.

397
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:30,747
I'm calling in a favor.

398
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:34,718
You're a good best man, Jack.

399
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,227
- Thank you.
- Okay, hold on.

400
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:38,229
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

401
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:40,060
- Come on, please! Please, please, please.
- We had this conversation.

402
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:42,293
Clay, I am pulling
80 hours a week, man.

403
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:44,734
I've gotta drag these
little moments out any way I can.

404
00:22:44,804 --> 00:22:46,704
Just... Just one, okay?

405
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:48,467
You gotta take the lens cap off first.

406
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,510
Oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

407
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:53,909
Just one, just one.

408
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:57,107
Oh, man, look at that.

409
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:58,912
An actual smile.

410
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:05,087
So proud of you.

411
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:08,388
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

412
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:10,190
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

413
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,027
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

414
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:15,624
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

415
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:18,499
to be my lawful wedded husband...

416
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,937
to be my lawful wedded husband...

417
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:23,202
to have and to hold...

418
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,267
to have and to hold...

419
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:27,608
from this night forward...

420
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,443
from this night forward...

421
00:23:29,515 --> 00:23:31,915
for better, for worse...

422
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,781
for better, for worse...

423
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:36,413
for richer, for poorer...

424
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:38,787
for richer, for poorer...

425
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:41,918
in sickness and in health...

426
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:44,792
in sickness and in health...

427
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:49,096
till death do us part.

428
00:23:49,168 --> 00:23:51,568
till death do us part.

429
00:24:11,123 --> 00:24:13,887
Clay.

430
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,984
Clay, whoa!

431
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:16,460
Whoa!

432
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:17,587
What are you doing?

433
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:19,426
What do you think I'm doing?

434
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,627
What is...

435
00:24:25,471 --> 00:24:27,996
Clay.

436
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:30,707
Clay.

437
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:34,578
They're the only ones with the number.

438
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:36,638
Holy shit.

439
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:41,575
I love you.

440
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:43,349
I love you, too.

441
00:24:45,157 --> 00:24:46,146
Here.

442
00:24:58,304 --> 00:24:59,999
There he is.

443
00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:01,539
The man of the hour.

444
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:03,632
Now, what took you two so long?

445
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,267
Sam, this is Dr. Puttnam.

446
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:06,641
- Hello.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

447
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:07,644
I've heard a lot about you.

448
00:25:07,713 --> 00:25:09,078
Clay's a lucky man.

449
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:10,137
I am.

450
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,046
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.

451
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:17,217
You'll have to excuse Penny.

452
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:18,847
She's not from around here.

453
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:21,085
You walk on the other side
of the road over there, huh, Penny.

454
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,253
Very funny.

455
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:24,353
Sorry I'm late.

456
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,455
Had a hard time getting a sitter.

457
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:28,397
Penny Carver. Nice to meet you.

458
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,298
Nice to meet you, too.
Sorry about him.

459
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:32,394
Oh, it's all right.
We're used to it by now.

460
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:35,599
So, D.C., gunshot to the head,

461
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:37,939
O-negative, perfect crossmatch.

462
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,910
Heart will be here in two hours.

463
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:41,810
And your mother's here.

464
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:42,848
What?

465
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:44,576
- Wait, she's here?
- Mm-hmm.

466
00:25:46,285 --> 00:25:48,583
What? She's on the call sheet.

467
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,782
You certainly took your time.

468
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:55,224
Dr. Neyer's performing
this transplant across town.

469
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:56,488
Would you please clear it
with administration?

470
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:58,257
Actually, I'm staying right here.

471
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,025
What?

472
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,033
- Hello, Jonathan.
- Jack.

473
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:03,432
You two know each other?

474
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:04,969
Of course.

475
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:06,095
Dr. Jack Harper,

476
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:09,164
Head of Cardio
Varick University Medical.

477
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:13,200
Two mortgages, two ulcers,
two ex-wives.

478
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,611
You sound like my ex-wives.

479
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:17,876
You still fishing
in the East River, Jack?

480
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,043
Well, some of us
just don't have the time

481
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,451
to make it to the North Shore
every weekend.

482
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:25,422
Clay, this man has three malpractice suits
against him.

483
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:27,288
Three. I checked.

484
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,259
Four. l...

485
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:31,387
I think it's four, right, Jack?

486
00:26:32,498 --> 00:26:33,795
You think this is funny?

487
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:41,128
Clayton, this time next year
I'll be Surgeon General.

488
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:43,903
I write textbooks on this procedure.

489
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:46,972
Really?

490
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:48,775
That's... That's great.

491
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:50,713
I, uh...

492
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,375
I sure hope you've read them, Jack.

493
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:54,681
Will you excuse us for a minute?

494
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:00,321
Look at me. Look at me.

495
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:02,383
This isn't about her.

496
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:06,830
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

497
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:07,991
He's my friend, Mother.

498
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,035
I trust him.

499
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:12,730
I really wish you'd start trusting me.

500
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:14,363
I'm sorry, darling.

501
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,839
The answer is no.

502
00:27:15,908 --> 00:27:18,570
I wasn't asking for your permission.

503
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:34,188
All right, I'm going to leave you guys
for a minute, okay?

504
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,057
Thanks, Jack.

505
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,891
Looks nice.

506
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:44,196
Does it fit?

507
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,171
Yeah. It's perfect.

508
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:50,641
Quite a night we're having, huh?

509
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:54,071
I'm scared shitless.

510
00:27:54,146 --> 00:27:56,307
I know. Me, too.

511
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:58,247
But, hey, you know what?

512
00:27:58,317 --> 00:28:00,842
As soon as you get out of here,

513
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,912
we're going to start from scratch.

514
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:05,650
Get a little house on the beach.

515
00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:08,158
- Mm-hmm.
- Do it right, you know?

516
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:09,159
Chase seagulls.

517
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:11,321
What do you say?

518
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:16,966
As soon as you get out,
I'll be right here.

519
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:22,737
You think my new heart will love you
as much as my old one?

520
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:33,348
Okay, lovebirds.

521
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,319
We gotta go.

522
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:38,117
All right.

523
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:43,328
I'll see you soon... wife.

524
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,189
Say that again.

525
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,790
Wife!

526
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:20,296
Sometimes you have to hold the button down
for a while to get it to work.

527
00:29:24,303 --> 00:29:26,328
I don't need your help.

528
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:37,975
Guys, I'm Dr. Lupin.

529
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,041
Uh, you can call me Larry.

530
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:43,384
I'd shake hands,
but, uh, heh, you know.

531
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:45,855
- Who is this? What's going on?
- I don't know.

532
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:48,359
Your colleague,
Fitzpatrick, got laryngitis.

533
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:50,156
They called me up
from Saint Mathew's.

534
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:52,288
I thought Fitzpatrick
was going to be here.

535
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:54,832
Yes, me, too, but we have Larry now.

536
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,631
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

537
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:02,404
We've been, um,
together a long time.

538
00:30:02,474 --> 00:30:03,771
Sort of like a little family.

539
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:05,434
This is Dr. Puttnam.

540
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:07,274
I understand.

541
00:30:07,346 --> 00:30:08,574
It's a pleasure, Doctor.

542
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:09,909
How's the patient feeling?

543
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:11,449
Okay.

544
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:13,041
Everything all right?

545
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:14,847
Just fine, Clay.

546
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,945
Hey, Penny.

547
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:19,013
I'll see you in a few hours, okay?

548
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:21,658
All right.

549
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:22,853
Okay, Clay.

550
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:24,828
This is it.

551
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:26,125
Mm-hmm.

552
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:28,530
You just relax, all right?

553
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,967
The next time you see me,
this is all going to be over.

554
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,699
See you soon.

555
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:41,104
Be gentle with him, okay?

556
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:46,646
Okay, just gonna give you
a little oxygen here.

557
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,619
They already asked you
if you had anything

558
00:30:48,687 --> 00:30:50,245
to eat or drink in the last four hours?

559
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:52,051
Yeah.

560
00:30:52,124 --> 00:30:54,183
And you've had general anesthetic before?

561
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,248
Mm-hmm.

562
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:56,851
Good.

563
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:59,796
I read your pre-op assessment

564
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:03,392
and came up with a nice
little cocktail.

565
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:06,302
A little abduction agent.
You're going to like this.

566
00:31:10,175 --> 00:31:11,767
Hang on tight.

567
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:15,903
Oh, my God.

568
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:18,711
Yeah. That's Him all right.

569
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,447
Go ahead and count back
from ten for me, will you?

570
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:23,488
Ten...

571
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:29,786
nine, eight,

572
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:31,454
seven...

573
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,322
si...

574
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:43,705
Happy trails, my friend.

575
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:53,809
<i>All right.</i>

576
00:31:53,886 --> 00:31:55,945
<i>Just let yourself go.</i>

577
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:57,488
<i>making love to me all morning.</i>

578
00:31:57,556 --> 00:32:00,150
<i>Just let yourself drift away.</i>

579
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:04,754
<i>Off you go.</i>

580
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:07,656
<i>Okay.</i>

581
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:08,665
Let's get going.

582
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:10,429
<i>I'm ready.</i>

583
00:32:10,502 --> 00:32:13,164
<i>Let's do it.</i>

584
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:14,830
Hey, Larry, what did you use here?

585
00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:17,273
Midazolam? Fentanyl? Hmm?

586
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:19,537
Yeah, with a little
pancuronium chaser.

587
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:21,442
<i>God, I wonder
what the scar's going to look like.</i>

588
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:26,782
<i>Ah!</i>

589
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:29,286
<i>Don't you guys use shaving cream?</i>

590
00:32:32,024 --> 00:32:34,322
<i>Ooh, that's freezing.</i>

591
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:39,256
<i>What is that? That stinks.</i>

592
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:43,233
<i>God, aren't I supposed
to be out for all this?</i>

593
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:45,736
<i>How long does it take
for this stuff to work anyway?</i>

594
00:32:45,804 --> 00:32:47,203
How does he look, Larry?

595
00:32:47,272 --> 00:32:48,637
Everything okay?

596
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:50,800
Sleeping like a baby.

597
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:52,537
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

598
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:53,976
Is he good to go?

599
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:54,978
Jack...

600
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:55,979
You ready?

601
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:57,447
Ready as I'll ever be.

602
00:32:57,516 --> 00:33:01,213
<i>Wait. Am I supposed
to be asleep right now?</i>

603
00:33:01,286 --> 00:33:03,880
All right, let's get the drapes on.

604
00:33:03,956 --> 00:33:04,980
<i>Hold on.</i>

605
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:10,527
<i>Guys, l...
I can still hear you.</i>

606
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:13,190
<i>Am I supposed to be able
to still hear you?</i>

607
00:33:16,468 --> 00:33:18,095
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait. Something's wrong.</i>

608
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,432
Give me another drape right here.

609
00:33:19,505 --> 00:33:20,563
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

610
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,664
<i>Something's definitely wrong, Jack.</i>

611
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:25,266
<i>Listen to me. I can feel that.</i>

612
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:27,904
<i>I can still hear you.</i>

613
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,676
<i>Okay? I'm... I'm still awake!</i>

614
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:32,614
<i>Just stop.</i>

615
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:35,118
<i>Aw, come on. Look at the machines.</i>

616
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:36,245
<i>All right? I'm not under yet.</i>

617
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:37,481
<i>Look at the fucking monitors!</i>

618
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:39,217
We're okay to go?

619
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,225
<i>Jesus, this isn't fucking happening!</i>

620
00:33:41,293 --> 00:33:42,282
Scalpel.

621
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:44,124
<i>Move something! Do something, Clay!</i>

622
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:46,164
<i>Move... Move an arm,
move a finger!</i>

623
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,597
<i>Come on, open your eyes!</i>

624
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:53,934
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

625
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,109
Do we have blood in the room?

626
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,171
Yes. We have four units.

627
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:04,738
We gotta get
this thing sharpened.

628
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:06,750
<i>Jack! Please! Oh, God!</i>

629
00:34:06,818 --> 00:34:08,945
Having a hard time getting through.

630
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,251
<i>Come on! Come on, Clay.</i>

631
00:34:11,323 --> 00:34:13,086
Saw.

632
00:34:13,158 --> 00:34:14,216
<i>You're gonna...
You're gonna be okay.</i>

633
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:16,523
<i>- One, two...
- Just... hold on.</i>

634
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:18,893
<i>- Everything's going to be... okay.
...three.</i>

635
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:23,094
<i>Ah! It's just pain.</i>

636
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:24,726
<i>It's just pain.</i>

637
00:34:24,803 --> 00:34:26,430
<i>It doesn't hurt.</i>

638
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:27,904
<i>It doesn't fucking hurt!</i>

639
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:29,907
<i>Come on, Clay, focus!</i>

640
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:31,374
<i>Get the fuck out of this fucking room</i>

641
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:32,467
<i>and think about
something else, okay?</i>

642
00:34:32,544 --> 00:34:33,476
<i>Anything.</i>

643
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:35,570
<i>Just... think about Sam, okay?</i>

644
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:37,308
<i>Just get back to Sam.</i>

645
00:34:37,382 --> 00:34:40,249
<i>Just... Sam, help me!</i>

646
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:41,980
Ready?

647
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:43,919
<i>- That's it!
- Come on.</i>

648
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,251
That's it. Just focus on her.

649
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:47,383
<i>Just focus on her.</i>

650
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:49,120
<i>Just forget about the pain.</i>

651
00:34:49,194 --> 00:34:50,752
<i>Okay, Puttnam, take it. You got it.</i>

652
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:52,956
<i>Clay, just remember.</i>

653
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:56,228
<i>Remember everything.
Every detail.</i>

654
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:58,235
Wow! Hey!

655
00:34:58,303 --> 00:34:59,463
<i>That's right. That's it.</i>

656
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:00,732
The place used to be a speakeasy.

657
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:02,034
No, you didn't...

658
00:35:02,107 --> 00:35:03,267
<i>Just focus.</i>

659
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:05,310
<i>Focus on her.</i>

660
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:06,503
<i>No. No, no, no, no.</i>

661
00:35:06,578 --> 00:35:09,046
<i>What?</i>

662
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:10,672
<i>What? No.</i>

663
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:12,011
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

664
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:15,645
- of the Lord to lay
Clayton Beresford to rest.

665
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:17,313
<i>Come on, Clay, concentrate!</i>

666
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:18,686
<i>Remember something else.</i>

667
00:35:18,757 --> 00:35:19,689
<i>Clayton?</i>

668
00:35:19,758 --> 00:35:21,726
- and a loving father.

669
00:35:21,793 --> 00:35:23,454
Clayton?

670
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:25,189
Clayton, are you paying attention?

671
00:35:25,264 --> 00:35:27,596
If it is made manifest by the third...

672
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:28,758
<i>No! No, no, no, no!</i>

673
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:29,766
<i>Forget about them, all right?</i>

674
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:31,132
<i>They can't help you now.</i>

675
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:33,330
<i>To the newest hot shot on the Street,</i>

676
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:34,963
<i>his father's son...</i>

677
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,029
<i>No, Clay! Fuck!</i>

678
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:37,370
<i>Get back to Sam.</i>

679
00:35:37,442 --> 00:35:39,967
Okay, we have a massive
heart attack, possible M. I.

680
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:41,672
<i>Come on, Jack. Get me back to Sam.</i>

681
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:42,679
What's his name?

682
00:35:42,748 --> 00:35:44,682
<i>I need your help.</i>

683
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,218
Stay with my voice, pal.

684
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:49,220
You're gonna be fine, okay?

685
00:35:49,288 --> 00:35:50,653
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

686
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:52,622
<i>What the fuck?</i>

687
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:54,852
Okay, open him up nice and wide.

688
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:56,416
<i>Okay, it's happening again.</i>

689
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:57,427
<i>Okay, it's fine.</i>

690
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:58,485
<i>Just control it like before.</i>

691
00:35:58,563 --> 00:35:59,791
<i>You can do this.</i>

692
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:01,890
<i>Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go.</i>

693
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,400
<i>Come on, man, just swallow it.</i>

694
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:07,570
Hey, follow my voice, pal.

695
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:10,369
We got you.
Stay right with me, okay?

696
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:14,339
There goes a rib.

697
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:16,574
Oh, that's going to hurt tomorrow.

698
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:18,479
<i>Sorry, Clay.</i>

699
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,518
<i>Yeah, you better be fucking sorry.</i>

700
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:22,212
<i>Fucking asshole.</i>

701
00:36:22,287 --> 00:36:23,219
<i>Okay, it's over.</i>

702
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:24,482
<i>They're... They're through.</i>

703
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:26,387
<i>They're all the way in now.</i>

704
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,050
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

705
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:30,856
<i>Just relax. The worst is over.</i>

706
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:33,329
<i>Jack's got you.</i>

707
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:35,161
<i>He... He's going to take care
of you, all right?</i>

708
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:36,359
<i>Just like he always does.</i>

709
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:37,493
Have a seat.

710
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:39,730
<i>Let him help you, Clay.</i>

711
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,568
...I kind of like to do
a follow-up with someone

712
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,834
after I've saved their life.

713
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:44,967
You don't feel grateful
or anything, do you?

714
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:46,340
<i>Get me to Sam, Jack.</i>

715
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:48,208
We're going to need a transplant.

716
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,941
You tell me. You're the doctor.

717
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:51,915
You do much fishing?

718
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:53,348
What do you do as a billionaire?

719
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:54,942
You just sit around and eat shrimp?

720
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,817
<i>- You always keep your cell on...
- There she is.</i>

721
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:57,946
...and that would be it.

722
00:36:58,023 --> 00:36:59,285
<i>- Okay.
- Sound like fun?</i>

723
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:01,223
<i>You did it, Clay. You're back.</i>

724
00:37:01,293 --> 00:37:02,817
Oh, and that'd be Clay.

725
00:37:02,894 --> 00:37:04,623
<i>- Awful table manners, always late.
- Look at me.</i>

726
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:07,221
<i>- You'll get used to it.
- Look at me.</i>

727
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:12,399
Oh! Holy shit, I'm sorry.

728
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:14,063
I...

729
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:16,906
This is embarrassing.

730
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:18,272
I thought you were
at your office...

731
00:37:18,343 --> 00:37:20,368
<i>- I need your help, Sam.
- I came in to, um...</i>

732
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:22,538
<i>I need a place to hide, okay?</i>

733
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:24,844
So, nice to meet you, too.

734
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:26,383
My name's Sam.

735
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:28,282
<i>There we go, Clay.</i>

736
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:29,411
<i>You see?</i>

737
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:31,547
<i>Just let her take you away.</i>

738
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:33,818
<i>Go all the way back to the beginning.</i>

739
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:37,419
We are going to where
the other half lives.

740
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,254
Let me guess,

741
00:37:40,332 --> 00:37:42,698
never been on the subway before.

742
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,903
No.

743
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:48,963
Never been to Brooklyn, either?

744
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:53,272
- To be perfectly honest, never.
- Wow.

745
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:57,441
Oh, you really shouldn't
be smoking these things.

746
00:37:57,516 --> 00:38:00,679
<i>- I'll be with you soon, Sam.
- It's not good for you.</i>

747
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:04,950
<i>No matter what happens,
I'll be with you soon.</i>

748
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:12,554
Miss, um... Ramos?

749
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:15,532
We're ready for you. Room 5.

750
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,898
Right down the end of the hall,
on your right.

751
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:19,869
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

752
00:38:26,945 --> 00:38:28,640
Hi. How are you doing?

753
00:38:28,713 --> 00:38:29,702
Hey.

754
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:31,840
Can I help you with something?

755
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,347
Haven't I... seen you around?

756
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,992
Guess not.

757
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:46,155
Sorry.

758
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:49,767
You have two rings on your finger.

759
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:51,564
What was that?

760
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:55,402
Why are you wearing two rings, Sam?

761
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,909
When?

762
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:03,539
Just before he got the call.

763
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,208
Lilith...

764
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:17,019
Who needs all
those extra nurses, anyway, huh?

765
00:39:17,095 --> 00:39:18,585
Well, I'm sick of the cutbacks.

766
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:20,893
I mean, how can they ask us
to do this with five people?

767
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:22,934
Yeah. You want to clamp that?

768
00:39:24,703 --> 00:39:26,068
Ah, that's good Miss Chen.

769
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:27,297
Heart came early.

770
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:29,897
Yeah, there she is.

771
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:31,499
Thanks, Penny.

772
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:32,804
Clear.

773
00:39:32,878 --> 00:39:35,346
Look at her. She's a beauty.

774
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:36,880
He's a lucky man.

775
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:38,848
Oh, by the way,
I've got two tickets

776
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:41,613
to the Knicks,
third row, tonight, Penny.

777
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:43,176
- Any interest?
- No, thanks.

778
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,189
What, is it
too American for you?

779
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,919
<i>We're halfway home, Sam.</i>

780
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:49,985
See where you live?

781
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:51,585
<i>The new heart's already here.</i>

782
00:39:51,663 --> 00:39:53,654
That's you. Right there.

783
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:55,529
<i>They're gonna put it in soon.</i>

784
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,693
Not that far away from
each other after all,

785
00:39:57,769 --> 00:39:59,703
are we Clay?

786
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:03,298
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

787
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:07,471
<i>God, I miss you.</i>

788
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:09,776
Stay with me.

789
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:13,877
Just stay.

790
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:16,944
<i>We're almost there, Sam.</i>

791
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:20,014
<i>We're almost there.</i>

792
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,792
How are we doin', Penny?

793
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:25,159
He's looking good. He's stable.

794
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,822
What about you, Jack?
You wanna go to the Knicks tonight?

795
00:40:26,898 --> 00:40:28,525
It might be good for you
to take the edge off.

796
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,568
I hate the Knicks.

797
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:32,034
Jesus, what is wrong
with you people?

798
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:33,331
I got third row.

799
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:36,272
Oh, shit.

800
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:44,509
Levatol, Nalapril, Digoxin.

801
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,715
He likes me to carry them around.

802
00:40:48,787 --> 00:40:51,881
If I left it up to him,
he'd be popping 'em like M&Ms.

803
00:40:51,957 --> 00:40:54,357
He could OD on
these things, you know?

804
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:56,257
Can't say I'll miss them.

805
00:40:56,328 --> 00:41:00,355
A lot of cute purses I haven't
been able to use over the last year.

806
00:41:03,468 --> 00:41:05,527
I didn't know you did that,

807
00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:08,971
that you carried his meds around.

808
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:16,176
I tried not to like him.

809
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:19,876
I honestly did.

810
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:22,818
Lilith, I know
how much he means to you.

811
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:26,015
What do you want from me, Sam?

812
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:30,494
I want you to tell him
that he's as good as his father.

813
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:35,192
I want you to tell him
that it's okay to love me,

814
00:41:35,266 --> 00:41:38,326
and I want you to tell me
that it's okay to love him back.

815
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:45,171
He's already lost one parent,
he can't lose another.

816
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:46,870
He needs you.

817
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:50,403
I'm not a bad person.

818
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:51,881
I mean, if you could
just give us your blessing...

819
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,444
Okay, just stop talking.

820
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:01,384
Just make sure
he takes his meds and...

821
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,359
stop talking.

822
00:42:03,428 --> 00:42:05,362
What?

823
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,988
He has terrible allergies,
did you know that?

824
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:08,657
Especially in the spring.

825
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:12,169
Grass and flowers...

826
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:14,865
Don't think this means
I'm going to be visiting every week.

827
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:19,375
Okay. Okay, let go.

828
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:23,380
All right.

829
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:26,042
Still sleeping like a baby.

830
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:28,551
Okay, why don't you
take your break, Larry?

831
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,679
We've been at this for a while.

832
00:42:30,755 --> 00:42:33,781
They've got a soda machine
in the waiting room.

833
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:36,418
Really? 'Cause I do
have to make a call.

834
00:42:36,494 --> 00:42:38,655
Sure, go ahead,
you've got at least 20 minutes.

835
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,697
We don't need you for a while.

836
00:42:39,764 --> 00:42:40,696
Well, thanks, guys.

837
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:41,697
Sure.

838
00:42:41,766 --> 00:42:42,858
Thanks a lot.

839
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:45,198
Pickups. Need adrenaline.

840
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,498
Peanut.

841
00:42:46,571 --> 00:42:49,131
Hey, if you need somebody
to go with you tonight,

842
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:52,005
to the game...

843
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:53,908
Thanks, Larry.

844
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:05,018
Jack?

845
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,558
What's the matter?
You all right?

846
00:43:10,028 --> 00:43:13,054
I don't know if I can do this.

847
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,031
What is the problem?

848
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,192
Fitzpatrick is the problem.

849
00:43:16,267 --> 00:43:18,098
He screwed us.

850
00:43:18,169 --> 00:43:20,729
This guy's been watching everything I do.

851
00:43:20,805 --> 00:43:22,534
Oh, come no, Jack. Larry's an idiot.

852
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:24,074
He doesn't know
what's going on here.

853
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:25,734
No, it's like he's
been sent here to spy on us.

854
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,142
I think they found out we've been pushing
Clay down the donor list.

855
00:43:28,213 --> 00:43:29,145
<i>What?</i>

856
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:30,476
Did you smell his breath, Jack?

857
00:43:30,548 --> 00:43:31,879
He's not a spy, he's a drunk.

858
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,145
He's probably in there right now
in the bar topping himself...

859
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:36,153
Hey, would you just be quiet?

860
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:37,153
He could be back any second.

861
00:43:37,222 --> 00:43:38,553
Okay, then go stand guard.

862
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,490
Go on. Now! And find out
what happened to Fitzpatrick...

863
00:43:42,894 --> 00:43:45,761
Hey, Jack, do not get paranoid.

864
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,764
No one knows.

865
00:43:47,832 --> 00:43:49,823
I started this thing,
and I swear to you I will end this.

866
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:51,266
I am not going to jail.

867
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:52,860
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What?</i>

868
00:43:52,937 --> 00:43:54,461
No one's going to jail.

869
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:57,167
Look, let's inject the heart, put it in,

870
00:43:57,242 --> 00:43:58,266
and end this thing, okay?

871
00:43:58,343 --> 00:43:59,708
<i>What the fuck?</i>

872
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:01,006
Nobody's on to anything.

873
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:02,706
We are in... the... clear.

874
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:04,408
We're gonna kill this guy,

875
00:44:04,482 --> 00:44:06,450
and then we're gonna go get
a fucking martini, okay?

876
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,816
By the time Larry walks back in here,

877
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:10,855
he'll be toes up
on the slab downstairs.

878
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:12,514
<i>You gotta be fucking kidding me.</i>

879
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,921
He knows something's going on.

880
00:44:13,992 --> 00:44:15,687
I just wanna be on bypass
before Larry gets back.

881
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,250
You get no arguments there.

882
00:44:17,328 --> 00:44:18,522
<i>You gotta stand up.</i>

883
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:21,326
<i>You gotta stand up, Clay.</i>

884
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:24,027
<i>Take the tape off your eyes
and shit out of your throat,</i>

885
00:44:24,102 --> 00:44:25,228
<i>and wake up.</i>

886
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:26,702
...is if we suddenly
stopped the procedure.

887
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:28,602
<i>That's it, there you go.</i>

888
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:30,140
<i>You can do it.</i>

889
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,802
<i>Just open your eyes, Clay.</i>

890
00:44:32,877 --> 00:44:35,937
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

891
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:58,266
I'm not doing this by myself.

892
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:01,772
I'm telling you,
if this thing goes sour,

893
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,933
if this guy looks like he's
figuring something out,

894
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:06,670
I'm pulling the plug
on this whole thing so quickly.

895
00:45:06,744 --> 00:45:07,836
I'm not kidding, Eugene.

896
00:45:07,912 --> 00:45:09,470
Hey, will you help me
with these stitches, please?

897
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:12,247
I'm too young to go to jail right now.

898
00:45:12,317 --> 00:45:14,080
This ain't even worth it.

899
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:15,119
We're fine, Jack...

900
00:45:16,688 --> 00:45:17,882
<i>All right, now think.</i>

901
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:21,153
Do you know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits

902
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:22,693
there are in this country?

903
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,727
<i>Think, Clay.</i>

904
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:25,023
Hard-working doctors, that's just...

905
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:26,688
<i>Look closer.</i>

906
00:45:26,764 --> 00:45:28,356
You know how many I got?

907
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:29,593
- Four.
- Yeah, I know.

908
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:30,691
<i>There's gotta be a way out of this.</i>

909
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:32,235
All for trying to
save people's lives.

910
00:45:32,303 --> 00:45:33,770
It's a disgrace.

911
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:36,170
<i>You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be all right.</i>

912
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:40,044
<i>You're not gonna die.</i>

913
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:42,773
I'm sorry.
They called me out of nowhere.

914
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:45,475
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

915
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,950
Mm-hmm.

916
00:45:49,053 --> 00:45:52,318
You know what? I'm gonna try
and find out what's going on.

917
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,379
- Yeah.
- Okay?

918
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,289
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

919
00:45:58,096 --> 00:46:00,121
Hi. Excuse me.

920
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:01,927
I was wondering
if you knew the status

921
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,093
on the heart transplant patient?

922
00:46:04,168 --> 00:46:06,295
Mr. Beresford?

923
00:46:06,371 --> 00:46:07,303
Yeah.

924
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:08,964
I'll call you back.

925
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,031
He's doing just fine.

926
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:12,406
We're taking
good care of him. Don't worry.

927
00:46:12,477 --> 00:46:14,775
Everything's going according to plan.

928
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:18,774
Really?
I just came from there.

929
00:46:20,618 --> 00:46:22,085
What is it?

930
00:46:22,153 --> 00:46:24,485
You're not a doctor at this hospital.

931
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:28,855
I mean, you don't work here, do you?

932
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,191
I'm Dr. Larry Lupin.
Pleasure to meet you.

933
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,489
Mr. Beresford's anesthesiologist.

934
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,760
Will you excuse me a minute?

935
00:46:41,873 --> 00:46:45,331
Fitzpatrick got laryngitis.
They called me in from St. Matthews.

936
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:46,934
Oh.

937
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:48,376
I thought Fitzpatrick
was gonna be here.

938
00:46:48,446 --> 00:46:51,279
Yes, me, too,
but we have Larry now.

939
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:53,647
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

940
00:46:53,718 --> 00:46:57,154
God, look how fucking obvious.

941
00:46:58,256 --> 00:46:59,780
I understand.

942
00:46:59,857 --> 00:47:01,518
This is Dr. Puttnam.

943
00:47:01,592 --> 00:47:03,890
Pleasure. How's the patient doing?

944
00:47:03,962 --> 00:47:05,327
Okay.

945
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:07,822
Everything all right?

946
00:47:07,899 --> 00:47:10,060
I don't get it, Jack.

947
00:47:10,134 --> 00:47:12,967
Why?

948
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:21,911
Is she asleep?

949
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,244
Oh, no, no. Everything's fine.

950
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:26,340
Just, um, just give her a kiss for me,

951
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:28,112
and tell her I'll be home soon.

952
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:30,450
Good. Thanks.

953
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:32,615
Say that again.

954
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:33,622
Wife!

955
00:47:33,691 --> 00:47:36,455
What'd I ever do to you?

956
00:47:37,762 --> 00:47:40,230
What did she do to you?

957
00:47:40,298 --> 00:47:42,630
Huh?

958
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,998
How the fuck
could you do this to us?

959
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:46,229
What are you doing in here?

960
00:47:46,304 --> 00:47:49,068
I wanted to see how it was going.

961
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:53,066
Sam.

962
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:56,874
How's it going? Is everything okay?

963
00:47:56,948 --> 00:47:58,040
Yeah.

964
00:47:58,116 --> 00:48:01,017
Sam.

965
00:48:01,085 --> 00:48:02,450
They're trying to kill me.

966
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,489
I just had an interesting chat
with some guy named Larry.

967
00:48:05,556 --> 00:48:07,524
Everything's fine.
You shouldn't be in here.

968
00:48:07,592 --> 00:48:11,119
No, don't trust him, baby.

969
00:48:11,195 --> 00:48:12,662
He's lying to you.

970
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,129
Are you sure everything's fine?

971
00:48:14,198 --> 00:48:16,689
There is nothing wrong.
Everything's under control.

972
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,292
Bullshit.

973
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:19,666
What the hell's going on in here?

974
00:48:19,737 --> 00:48:21,170
That's right. Come on, baby.

975
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:23,173
Where the fuck is Fitzpatrick?

976
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:25,801
I just spoke to him.
He's at home.

977
00:48:25,877 --> 00:48:28,471
What do you mean, he's at home?

978
00:48:28,546 --> 00:48:30,036
- He's backing out.
- He's backing out?

979
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:32,048
What?

980
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:33,048
He can't back out.

981
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:34,641
Do you want me to call him back?

982
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:36,277
No, he's an idiot.

983
00:48:36,354 --> 00:48:39,050
We'll deal with him later.

984
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:41,648
What about this Larry guy?
Does he have a clue?

985
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:43,591
None. What about her?

986
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:44,855
Are you kidding?

987
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:46,954
She's ready to adopt me.
Everything's fine.

988
00:48:51,903 --> 00:48:54,030
Everything is fine, right?

989
00:48:54,105 --> 00:48:57,233
Right?

990
00:48:58,643 --> 00:49:02,409
Jack, you okay?

991
00:49:03,948 --> 00:49:06,644
Jack?

992
00:49:08,586 --> 00:49:09,518
Get her a gown.

993
00:49:09,587 --> 00:49:10,815
What about Larry?

994
00:49:10,888 --> 00:49:13,482
I'll watch for him. Just hurry.

995
00:49:17,895 --> 00:49:19,863
Guys, finish putting him on bypass.

996
00:49:27,538 --> 00:49:30,029
Jack.

997
00:49:30,108 --> 00:49:34,010
It was my idea, Sam. You know?

998
00:49:34,078 --> 00:49:36,012
Jesus.

999
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,140
I can pull the plug if I want to.

1000
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:42,084
Everything is working, Jack.

1001
00:49:42,153 --> 00:49:43,780
Okay?

1002
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,913
There he is.

1003
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:47,480
- I got him to marry me.
- The man of the hour.

1004
00:49:47,558 --> 00:49:49,048
The hard part's over.

1005
00:49:49,127 --> 00:49:51,288
This is Dr. Puttnam. Sam.

1006
00:49:51,362 --> 00:49:52,795
Sam, I've heard a lot about you.

1007
00:49:54,065 --> 00:49:56,056
<i>Christ, they know her.</i>

1008
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:58,762
Sorry, I'm late.
I had a hard time getting a sitter.

1009
00:49:58,836 --> 00:50:00,667
Penny Carver.
Pleasure to meet you.

1010
00:50:00,738 --> 00:50:02,330
Nice to meet you, too.

1011
00:50:02,406 --> 00:50:04,169
Sorry about him.

1012
00:50:04,242 --> 00:50:05,641
I'm used to it by now.

1013
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,507
So...

1014
00:50:07,578 --> 00:50:11,105
How the hell do they all know her?

1015
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:13,412
We didn't waste a year of our lives

1016
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:16,351
for nothing, did we, Jack?

1017
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,853
Nobody knows I worked your team.

1018
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:18,889
<i>What?</i>

1019
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:20,753
I changed my name.

1020
00:50:20,825 --> 00:50:23,385
We're clear.
We're totally in the clear.

1021
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:25,861
Yeah, they're all mine.

1022
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:30,458
Kind of depressing to know that
your whole life can just fit on one wall.

1023
00:50:30,535 --> 00:50:32,366
My dream is to one
day fill up this one.

1024
00:50:32,436 --> 00:50:35,371
Jack, you know how much
we owe from the lawsuits.

1025
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:38,340
The insurance won't cover it.

1026
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:41,276
I can't just kill him, Sam.

1027
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:44,246
This is our only way out.

1028
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,681
Without this money, we're finished.

1029
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:52,450
He has to die.

1030
00:50:52,523 --> 00:50:54,753
I am fucked.

1031
00:50:54,825 --> 00:50:56,383
It's just money, Sam.

1032
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,293
I'd rather stay in debt than go to jail.

1033
00:50:59,363 --> 00:51:00,330
Jesus, Jack.

1034
00:51:00,398 --> 00:51:02,491
Grow some fucking balls.

1035
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:05,127
Hey, I started this
whole thing, remember?

1036
00:51:05,203 --> 00:51:07,933
He landed on my table, I brought you in,

1037
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:09,438
I brought all y'all in.

1038
00:51:09,507 --> 00:51:12,670
It's my choice.

1039
00:51:12,743 --> 00:51:15,678
And I wasn't the one that nearly
screwed this whole thing up, was I?

1040
00:51:15,746 --> 00:51:16,872
He's right, you know.

1041
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,813
I would've had that ring on my finger

1042
00:51:18,883 --> 00:51:19,815
in two months.

1043
00:51:19,884 --> 00:51:21,283
Really?

1044
00:51:21,352 --> 00:51:22,546
Well, if you hadn't got knocked up,

1045
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,884
maybe you would've had
the chance, wouldn't you?

1046
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,652
Just go, Penny, all right?

1047
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:33,962
Jack, think about it.

1048
00:51:34,031 --> 00:51:39,025
No more triple shifts.

1049
00:51:39,103 --> 00:51:42,129
No more 30-hour days.

1050
00:51:42,206 --> 00:51:46,438
Even if we settle the will, we're rich.

1051
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,139
You know what
100 million is four ways?

1052
00:51:52,183 --> 00:51:55,983
He's a transplant patient, Jack.

1053
00:51:56,053 --> 00:51:58,487
They all die eventually.

1054
00:51:58,556 --> 00:52:01,957
Yeah.

1055
00:52:02,026 --> 00:52:04,460
They all die eventually.

1056
00:52:12,903 --> 00:52:14,530
Look at me.

1057
00:52:14,605 --> 00:52:16,470
This isn't about her.

1058
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,303
I'm so sorry.

1059
00:52:18,376 --> 00:52:21,243
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

1060
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:24,008
He's my friend, Mother. I trust him.

1061
00:52:24,081 --> 00:52:26,743
I really wish
you'd start trusting me.

1062
00:52:28,386 --> 00:52:30,445
Quickly. Watch the vein.

1063
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:32,955
All right, it's almost there.

1064
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,049
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1065
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:40,521
I got it.

1066
00:52:40,598 --> 00:52:41,963
All right, I need some suction.

1067
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,501
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Please, God, no.

1068
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:47,366
- Just get that side, too.
- Okay.

1069
00:52:47,438 --> 00:52:49,269
Oh, no, please, God.

1070
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,137
No.

1071
00:52:52,143 --> 00:52:55,772
Aah!

1072
00:52:55,846 --> 00:52:57,541
It's right here.

1073
00:52:57,615 --> 00:52:59,207
Thank you.

1074
00:53:00,384 --> 00:53:01,908
You sure Larry's not close?

1075
00:53:01,986 --> 00:53:03,351
We're fine. Don't worry.

1076
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:04,718
We gotta hurry all the same, okay, Jack?

1077
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:06,256
Let's just keep it moving.

1078
00:53:06,324 --> 00:53:08,588
All right, just pass over the new heart.

1079
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:09,591
What?

1080
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,888
Pass over the new heart.

1081
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:12,588
But we haven't injected it yet.

1082
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:15,154
Pass it over.

1083
00:53:15,232 --> 00:53:17,257
What are you doing?

1084
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:19,394
Where's the syringe?

1085
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:20,630
Give it to me.

1086
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:21,899
Come on.

1087
00:53:21,972 --> 00:53:24,532
Move your fucking hand.

1088
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:28,374
Now, I want you to take this.

1089
00:53:29,613 --> 00:53:34,050
Inject the heart,
and put it in the body, okay?

1090
00:53:37,555 --> 00:53:39,853
You led us here.

1091
00:53:39,924 --> 00:53:42,392
Finish what you started.

1092
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,360
Just do it, Jack.

1093
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:46,362
Let's get this over with.

1094
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:51,396
Sorry, baby.

1095
00:53:54,004 --> 00:53:55,631
He really loved you, Sam.

1096
00:53:55,706 --> 00:53:58,971
He didn't even know me, Jack.

1097
00:53:59,043 --> 00:54:01,068
We never even met.

1098
00:54:07,518 --> 00:54:11,113
Wait. Hold on.

1099
00:54:14,325 --> 00:54:16,156
Holy shit.

1100
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:19,196
Oh, holy shit.

1101
00:54:41,352 --> 00:54:42,649
Is he okay?

1102
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,984
Is everything okay?

1103
00:54:45,055 --> 00:54:47,182
They wouldn't say.

1104
00:54:47,258 --> 00:54:48,816
You were gone so long.

1105
00:54:48,893 --> 00:54:49,825
- I know.
- I started...

1106
00:54:49,894 --> 00:54:51,691
I know.

1107
00:54:51,762 --> 00:54:54,424
I'm scared, too.

1108
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:05,873
Hey, guys.

1109
00:55:05,943 --> 00:55:07,308
Survive without me?

1110
00:55:07,378 --> 00:55:09,710
So far, so good. Smooth sailing.

1111
00:55:11,449 --> 00:55:12,848
Forceps.

1112
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:14,748
Oh, you guys are flying.

1113
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:16,377
- Yeah.
- Watch your flow.

1114
00:55:17,688 --> 00:55:19,679
Larry. Larry, Larry.

1115
00:55:19,757 --> 00:55:22,521
Look at my eye.

1116
00:55:22,593 --> 00:55:25,562
Come on, man. Can you see that?

1117
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:27,529
Why am I crying, huh?

1118
00:55:27,598 --> 00:55:29,327
Something's wrong.

1119
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,528
Larry. Larry, look.

1120
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:35,197
Come on, man. Look at my eye.

1121
00:55:35,272 --> 00:55:37,069
Come on, Larry, look!

1122
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:41,370
Pull it back so I can see...

1123
00:55:43,147 --> 00:55:46,014
- Hold on.
- All right, here we are.

1124
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,984
- Okay.
- Clamp that.

1125
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:51,715
- Get me the suction.
- All right.

1126
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:53,984
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1127
00:55:54,058 --> 00:55:56,288
Hold on. Hold on.

1128
00:56:00,097 --> 00:56:03,225
Yeah. Yeah.
You got it. Come on.

1129
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,133
I'm sorry, I can't
go to the game tonight.

1130
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:08,137
My old lady and I have a date.

1131
00:56:11,976 --> 00:56:14,035
You f...

1132
00:56:17,348 --> 00:56:19,407
Why don't I give you both tickets?

1133
00:56:19,483 --> 00:56:21,110
- Really?
- Sure.

1134
00:56:21,185 --> 00:56:22,243
You can take your old lady.

1135
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,946
Make a night of it, go out on the town.

1136
00:56:26,524 --> 00:56:29,391
Something's wrong.

1137
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,451
I can feel that something's wrong.

1138
00:56:31,529 --> 00:56:33,156
What is it?

1139
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:34,663
I can't just sit here like this.

1140
00:56:34,732 --> 00:56:37,895
They should have told us something by now.

1141
00:56:37,968 --> 00:56:40,459
- Listen to me.
- No, you don't understand.

1142
00:56:40,538 --> 00:56:42,199
He's not just my son.

1143
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,934
I was a kid when I had him.

1144
00:56:44,008 --> 00:56:45,373
He's going to be fine.

1145
00:56:45,442 --> 00:56:48,570
We've grown up together.
It's me and him.

1146
00:56:48,646 --> 00:56:50,443
He's not going to die.

1147
00:56:50,514 --> 00:56:54,541
Not now, not today.

1148
00:56:54,618 --> 00:56:55,949
He's going to live.

1149
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,250
How can you be so sure?

1150
00:56:58,322 --> 00:57:00,916
Because he's got too much to live for.

1151
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,525
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

1152
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,294
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

1153
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:11,891
What's wrong with right now?

1154
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:13,402
Well, I can't. I'm...

1155
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,668
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

1156
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:19,538
You look beautiful, Sam.

1157
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,077
<i>- I do?
- Look at you.</i>

1158
00:57:21,145 --> 00:57:22,112
Yeah, you do.

1159
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:23,646
I should tell you that more often.

1160
00:57:23,714 --> 00:57:26,410
<i>What would the old man
think of you now?</i>

1161
00:57:28,218 --> 00:57:31,187
<i>You lost it all, Clay.</i>

1162
00:57:31,255 --> 00:57:35,419
<i>Everything he gave you, everything he made,</i>

1163
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:37,255
<i>it's gone.</i>

1164
00:57:38,796 --> 00:57:41,287
<i>You gave it all away.</i>

1165
00:57:41,365 --> 00:57:43,492
Heart's in.

1166
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:46,058
All right, pressure down.

1167
00:57:46,136 --> 00:57:47,501
Pressure down.

1168
00:57:47,571 --> 00:57:50,199
Okay, release the clamp.

1169
00:57:50,274 --> 00:57:53,004
Cross-clamp released.

1170
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:55,938
Wait a minute.

1171
00:57:57,081 --> 00:57:58,139
Wait, wait, wait.
Something's wrong.

1172
00:57:58,215 --> 00:58:02,015
Okay, re... re-clamp.

1173
00:58:02,086 --> 00:58:03,348
He's... He's fibbing.

1174
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,853
You getting anything?

1175
00:58:04,922 --> 00:58:06,719
- Nothing.
- All right, all right.

1176
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:09,418
Charge paddles n... now.

1177
00:58:09,493 --> 00:58:11,017
Come on. Now, Penny. Hurry.

1178
00:58:11,095 --> 00:58:15,657
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke these things.

1179
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:18,133
It's not good for you.

1180
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:19,965
Especially with your condition.

1181
00:58:20,037 --> 00:58:23,803
- My condition?
- Yep.

1182
00:58:23,874 --> 00:58:25,341
How do you know
about my condition?

1183
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:27,138
<i>So many details.</i>

1184
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:29,304
I know a lot more
about you than you think.

1185
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,178
<i>- I didn't even see.
- Is that a fact?</i>

1186
00:58:32,249 --> 00:58:33,682
Of course.

1187
00:58:33,751 --> 00:58:36,515
<i>Christ, I missed everything.</i>

1188
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:40,148
<i>What was I looking at?</i>

1189
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:43,159
Was I looking at you?

1190
00:58:43,227 --> 00:58:46,196
I hope you're happy, Sam.

1191
00:58:46,263 --> 00:58:48,493
And I hope you get what you deserve.

1192
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:50,590
Got nothing?

1193
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:54,069
- Okay.
- Paddles to 20.

1194
00:58:54,138 --> 00:58:55,901
- Amio's running.
- Charge.

1195
00:58:55,973 --> 00:58:58,407
Charge it again.

1196
00:58:58,475 --> 00:58:59,908
Charge.

1197
00:58:59,977 --> 00:59:02,673
Are your lats okay?

1198
00:59:02,746 --> 00:59:04,077
Charge it to 40, please.

1199
00:59:04,148 --> 00:59:05,342
- Jack.
- Jesus.

1200
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,611
Charge it one more time, please.

1201
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:08,982
<i>Don't fight it.</i>

1202
00:59:09,053 --> 00:59:11,521
Just charge it one more time.

1203
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:13,180
Charge.

1204
00:59:13,257 --> 00:59:15,748
Marry me.

1205
00:59:15,826 --> 00:59:16,884
What?

1206
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,292
<i>- Here we go.
- Tonight. Right now.</i>

1207
00:59:19,363 --> 00:59:21,422
- Marry me.
- It's the middle of the night.

1208
00:59:25,502 --> 00:59:27,561
We're losing him.

1209
00:59:27,638 --> 00:59:29,572
We gotta get him back on bypass.

1210
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,572
No, no, no, not yet.

1211
00:59:30,641 --> 00:59:32,836
Just one more time.

1212
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,639
It's over, Jack. He's done.

1213
00:59:34,712 --> 00:59:35,770
We have to put him back on...

1214
00:59:35,846 --> 00:59:37,404
What about the adrenaline?

1215
00:59:37,481 --> 00:59:38,607
It won't make a difference.

1216
00:59:38,682 --> 00:59:41,014
A shot of adrenaline, please.

1217
00:59:41,085 --> 00:59:43,110
Please!

1218
00:59:44,888 --> 00:59:47,721
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1219
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:48,883
Jack.

1220
00:59:48,959 --> 00:59:50,153
- Sure there's no air?
- No air.

1221
00:59:50,227 --> 00:59:51,626
I'm looking at it.
There's no air.

1222
00:59:51,695 --> 00:59:53,492
It's over, Jack.

1223
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:57,391
Shit.

1224
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,561
I'm sorry, Jack.

1225
01:00:01,605 --> 01:00:03,573
It's my fault.

1226
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,301
No.

1227
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,842
It's my fault.

1228
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,275
Jack, come on.

1229
01:00:08,345 --> 01:00:11,473
No, it is. It's...

1230
01:00:11,548 --> 01:00:14,608
There's gotta be
something I could have done,

1231
01:00:14,685 --> 01:00:16,482
something I could have tried.

1232
01:00:16,553 --> 01:00:19,488
Jack, you did everything
you could do.

1233
01:00:19,556 --> 01:00:21,786
Did I?

1234
01:00:21,859 --> 01:00:24,419
You did all you could do, Jack.

1235
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,020
It was a bad heart.

1236
01:00:35,305 --> 01:00:37,466
We should tell the family.

1237
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:40,232
Any volunteers?

1238
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,039
I'll do it.

1239
01:00:42,112 --> 01:00:44,603
I'm the one that should
be talking to them.

1240
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:51,684
- I'll go with him.
- Yeah.

1241
01:00:51,755 --> 01:00:53,814
Thank you.

1242
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:07,333
So?

1243
01:01:07,404 --> 01:01:08,894
He rejected the heart.

1244
01:01:11,008 --> 01:01:14,000
We did everything
we could, but the...

1245
01:01:14,077 --> 01:01:16,910
the organ failed, and I am so sorry.

1246
01:01:20,651 --> 01:01:23,518
The organ failed?

1247
01:01:23,587 --> 01:01:27,284
Yes. It wouldn't respond
to the procedure.

1248
01:01:27,357 --> 01:01:29,848
But in cases like this,
it's not uncommon for...

1249
01:01:29,927 --> 01:01:33,090
Don't you mean you failed?

1250
01:01:33,163 --> 01:01:35,154
No, we...

1251
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:37,757
we did everything that we could.

1252
01:01:37,835 --> 01:01:39,860
It's just an imperfect procedure.

1253
01:01:39,937 --> 01:01:42,167
Say it.

1254
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:43,706
Say what?

1255
01:01:43,774 --> 01:01:47,335
I want to hear you say it.
I want to hear you say...

1256
01:01:47,411 --> 01:01:50,039
you failed my son.

1257
01:01:54,918 --> 01:01:56,886
It shouldn't have been you.
It should never have been you.

1258
01:01:56,954 --> 01:02:00,117
I fucking knew it.

1259
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:05,284
I'm... I'm sorry, Sam.

1260
01:02:10,734 --> 01:02:13,760
Um...

1261
01:02:13,837 --> 01:02:15,429
I'm afraid we're going
to need your permission

1262
01:02:15,505 --> 01:02:16,836
to take him off bypass.

1263
01:02:18,575 --> 01:02:20,543
What?

1264
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,738
We'll need your permission.

1265
01:02:22,813 --> 01:02:25,714
I'm so sorry to have to ask.

1266
01:02:25,782 --> 01:02:27,682
I don't understand.

1267
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,378
He's alive?

1268
01:02:31,455 --> 01:02:35,551
Yes, but his blood's being
pumped by a machine.

1269
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:36,558
He has no heart.

1270
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,652
Then get him another heart.

1271
01:02:38,729 --> 01:02:39,696
You don't understand.

1272
01:02:39,763 --> 01:02:42,061
His blood type's too rare.

1273
01:02:42,132 --> 01:02:43,190
We don't have one.

1274
01:02:46,503 --> 01:02:50,439
I'm sorry. It's... It's over.

1275
01:02:50,507 --> 01:02:52,304
Thank you.

1276
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,883
I'll be in the hallway.

1277
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:10,588
Lilith...

1278
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,856
Could you leave me
alone for a minute?

1279
01:03:13,964 --> 01:03:15,431
Okay.

1280
01:03:35,452 --> 01:03:37,352
It's done.

1281
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:45,617
Okay.

1282
01:04:42,085 --> 01:04:43,211
Hey.

1283
01:04:43,286 --> 01:04:44,446
Hey.

1284
01:04:46,423 --> 01:04:48,391
What are you doing?

1285
01:04:52,229 --> 01:04:53,787
Hey.

1286
01:04:56,299 --> 01:04:59,166
Just wanted to see
if you needed anything.

1287
01:04:59,236 --> 01:05:03,172
Wanted to see how you were doing.

1288
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,301
I know it's hard to even think about
anything else right now, but...

1289
01:05:09,446 --> 01:05:11,846
Are you okay?

1290
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:15,408
You okay?

1291
01:05:25,362 --> 01:05:26,727
What are you doing here?

1292
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,129
I wasn't staying
out there without you.

1293
01:05:34,004 --> 01:05:35,801
She's in here somewhere.

1294
01:05:35,872 --> 01:05:37,669
Look around.

1295
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:45,944
God damn it.

1296
01:05:46,016 --> 01:05:47,540
Bailey, call the code.

1297
01:05:47,617 --> 01:05:49,380
It's too late.

1298
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:56,483
All right,
let's prep her for surgery.

1299
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:02,064
I don't understand.

1300
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:05,158
You're going to live, Clay.

1301
01:06:05,235 --> 01:06:09,433
Think I'll take it from here, Jack.

1302
01:06:09,506 --> 01:06:10,632
It's too late.

1303
01:06:12,476 --> 01:06:15,502
We did everything we could,
but the body rejected the heart.

1304
01:06:15,579 --> 01:06:17,843
Well, I think we solved that problem.

1305
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:22,443
I have a strong heart, Clay.

1306
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:23,611
Let's go.

1307
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:25,746
Let's prep her for transplant.

1308
01:06:25,822 --> 01:06:28,518
Always have.

1309
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:35,298
You can go.
We've been prepped.

1310
01:06:35,365 --> 01:06:36,593
What do you mean?

1311
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:38,156
You can run.

1312
01:06:38,235 --> 01:06:39,930
Police will be here soon.

1313
01:06:41,304 --> 01:06:42,862
What'd you use, Jack?

1314
01:06:42,939 --> 01:06:46,033
Formaldehy... No, wait.

1315
01:06:46,109 --> 01:06:47,201
Adriamycin.

1316
01:06:47,277 --> 01:06:49,040
Right.

1317
01:06:49,112 --> 01:06:51,910
Less residue.

1318
01:06:51,982 --> 01:06:53,779
Guys.

1319
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,317
Jack, come on. Let's go.

1320
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,412
Jack, what are you doing?

1321
01:06:58,488 --> 01:07:00,854
Let's go. Now, Jack.

1322
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,051
What the hell happened to you?

1323
01:07:12,702 --> 01:07:14,932
I told you not to trust them.

1324
01:07:15,005 --> 01:07:16,063
I don't get it.

1325
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:17,606
You're telling me that you knew?

1326
01:07:17,674 --> 01:07:21,166
No, no. Not at first.

1327
01:07:21,244 --> 01:07:24,372
I had no idea.

1328
01:07:24,447 --> 01:07:27,314
She did everything right.

1329
01:07:27,384 --> 01:07:31,946
And then, she made one little mistake.

1330
01:07:32,022 --> 01:07:34,183
She left her purse in the waiting room.

1331
01:07:34,257 --> 01:07:37,158
Forget ethics.

1332
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:38,751
You got five minutes.

1333
01:07:38,828 --> 01:07:40,193
You know where I'll be.

1334
01:07:40,263 --> 01:07:42,959
I don't trust anyone else.

1335
01:07:43,033 --> 01:07:44,933
It has to be you.

1336
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:47,902
The mail, Clay.

1337
01:07:47,971 --> 01:07:50,201
She still had her mail.

1338
01:07:50,273 --> 01:07:52,537
Wait. Jonathan?

1339
01:07:58,648 --> 01:08:01,742
Haven't I see you around?

1340
01:08:01,818 --> 01:08:04,116
Only took me a second to put it together.

1341
01:08:04,187 --> 01:08:06,018
Sometimes you have
to hold the button down

1342
01:08:06,089 --> 01:08:08,557
for a while to get it to work.

1343
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:10,957
She'd been to that hospital before.

1344
01:08:11,027 --> 01:08:13,552
You're not a doctor at this hospital.

1345
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:18,761
I mean, you don't work here, do you?

1346
01:08:18,835 --> 01:08:19,961
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1347
01:08:22,672 --> 01:08:25,766
Why didn't you just say something?

1348
01:08:25,842 --> 01:08:28,436
There was no time.

1349
01:08:28,511 --> 01:08:32,379
You were dying, you needed a heart.

1350
01:08:32,449 --> 01:08:34,883
I had no choice.

1351
01:08:37,887 --> 01:08:41,618
Get a DLP vent ready.

1352
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:42,953
Doctor, how does he look?

1353
01:08:43,026 --> 01:08:45,494
Terrible.
He's been on bypass too long.

1354
01:08:45,562 --> 01:08:46,790
Let's prep the new organ.

1355
01:08:46,863 --> 01:08:48,387
Still going to attempt transplant?

1356
01:08:48,465 --> 01:08:50,797
Well, I might
have to do an autopsy.

1357
01:08:53,103 --> 01:08:54,297
Give me a knife and a flat vent.

1358
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,603
Sorry, Lilith.

1359
01:08:58,675 --> 01:09:01,075
I'm so sorry.

1360
01:09:05,382 --> 01:09:07,111
I'm looking for it.

1361
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:08,980
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1362
01:09:09,052 --> 01:09:14,149
Beresford transplant...
operating room B.

1363
01:09:15,191 --> 01:09:16,556
Becky, it's me.

1364
01:09:16,626 --> 01:09:18,184
Listen, get her up
and get her dressed now.

1365
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:19,751
I'm coming back.

1366
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:21,729
Becky, just do it, okay?

1367
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,495
My car is downstairs.

1368
01:09:29,973 --> 01:09:32,168
Doctor?

1369
01:09:32,242 --> 01:09:34,039
Larry.

1370
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:35,134
You're not going to believe what...

1371
01:09:35,211 --> 01:09:36,838
Over here!

1372
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:42,484
Stop! Hands up!

1373
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:45,043
Ah!

1374
01:09:50,427 --> 01:09:52,486
Give me the heart.

1375
01:09:52,562 --> 01:09:55,497
Heartbeat in position.

1376
01:09:55,565 --> 01:09:58,033
Get a 3-0 ready.

1377
01:09:58,101 --> 01:09:59,466
No, no, no. It's too fast.

1378
01:09:59,536 --> 01:10:01,163
- What if...
- I'll do the worrying.

1379
01:10:01,237 --> 01:10:02,295
Here, watch that clamp.

1380
01:10:02,372 --> 01:10:03,805
Pick up stitch.

1381
01:10:04,808 --> 01:10:07,368
Come on, come on.

1382
01:10:07,444 --> 01:10:09,503
Load the Milrinone.

1383
01:10:09,579 --> 01:10:11,911
Just give me time. We need to move.

1384
01:10:19,556 --> 01:10:22,081
Come here.

1385
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:24,683
- What the fuck is going on?
- Relax.

1386
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:25,989
Look, what did I tell you?

1387
01:10:26,062 --> 01:10:27,586
I told you I was going
to look after you, didn't I?

1388
01:10:27,664 --> 01:10:30,360
You trusted me this far,
so just keep quiet.

1389
01:10:30,433 --> 01:10:32,901
I almost forgot.

1390
01:10:32,969 --> 01:10:35,836
I've had this way too long
to leave this behind.

1391
01:10:36,973 --> 01:10:38,270
Three-one.

1392
01:10:38,341 --> 01:10:41,310
Wet his hands.

1393
01:10:41,378 --> 01:10:42,777
John, we're running out of time.

1394
01:10:42,846 --> 01:10:44,711
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

1395
01:10:44,781 --> 01:10:45,907
Scissor.

1396
01:10:45,982 --> 01:10:47,347
Cut.

1397
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:52,252
Head down, pressure down.

1398
01:10:52,322 --> 01:10:55,018
Cross clamp off.

1399
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:00,895
- We got rhythm.
- Looks good.

1400
01:11:06,202 --> 01:11:07,533
I can't go with you.

1401
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:11,872
What?

1402
01:11:11,941 --> 01:11:13,932
They want you.

1403
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,571
You're the one who
injected the heart, not me.

1404
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:18,944
They don't want me.

1405
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:22,948
Sam.

1406
01:11:23,019 --> 01:11:26,250
I'm sorry.

1407
01:11:26,322 --> 01:11:29,223
I'm just the grieving
widow, remember?

1408
01:11:32,929 --> 01:11:34,157
I didn't do anything wrong.

1409
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:35,857
- Yeah, you did.
- No!

1410
01:11:38,768 --> 01:11:41,134
Going to be kind of hard
to play a grieving widow

1411
01:11:41,204 --> 01:11:43,138
with your fingerprints
all on the syringe.

1412
01:11:43,206 --> 01:11:46,004
Jack.

1413
01:11:46,075 --> 01:11:48,270
Jack, come on.

1414
01:11:48,344 --> 01:11:49,276
Let me in.

1415
01:11:50,413 --> 01:11:51,903
Jack.

1416
01:11:51,981 --> 01:11:53,972
Come on.

1417
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:56,314
Please?

1418
01:11:56,386 --> 01:11:58,581
Goddamn you.
Open the fucking door.

1419
01:11:58,655 --> 01:12:00,486
Open the door now!

1420
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:02,684
Jack, please!

1421
01:12:02,759 --> 01:12:03,726
Open the fucking door.

1422
01:12:03,793 --> 01:12:05,317
Bye, Sam.

1423
01:12:05,395 --> 01:12:07,158
Jack!

1424
01:12:13,903 --> 01:12:16,133
Closing the chest. Pressure okay?

1425
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:18,538
No Vicryl.

1426
01:12:18,608 --> 01:12:19,802
Sop it wet.

1427
01:12:19,876 --> 01:12:21,707
Yeah.

1428
01:12:21,778 --> 01:12:22,938
Scissor, please.

1429
01:12:24,914 --> 01:12:26,381
Cut.

1430
01:12:33,022 --> 01:12:34,080
Great job.

1431
01:12:34,157 --> 01:12:35,488
Well, we do what we can.

1432
01:12:35,558 --> 01:12:36,855
Amazing.

1433
01:12:39,829 --> 01:12:40,761
God damn it.

1434
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:43,264
- He's in fib.
- Shit.

1435
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:45,392
Get me an amp of eppy now.

1436
01:12:45,468 --> 01:12:46,696
Clay.

1437
01:12:46,769 --> 01:12:48,259
Come on, Clayton.

1438
01:12:48,338 --> 01:12:50,329
I'm trying to be a hero here.
Don't make me look bad.

1439
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:53,638
I'm going to stay here with you.

1440
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:55,905
There's no one left
for me out there anyway.

1441
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:57,503
You don't need anyone else.

1442
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:00,014
You do it yourself, Clay.

1443
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:01,948
- You're strong.
- I'm not him.

1444
01:13:02,018 --> 01:13:03,246
I tried, Mom.

1445
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:06,652
Really, I did, but...
I'm just not him.

1446
01:13:06,723 --> 01:13:07,712
He's still in fib.

1447
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,553
- Clay.
- Never going to be.

1448
01:13:09,626 --> 01:13:11,992
- Charge the paddles.
- I don't want you to be.

1449
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:13,722
We're losing him.

1450
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,823
200.

1451
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:18,959
Clear.

1452
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:21,302
Come on.

1453
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:23,999
I have to show you something.

1454
01:13:24,073 --> 01:13:25,563
I don't want to see this.

1455
01:13:25,642 --> 01:13:27,200
I'm afraid you have to.

1456
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:30,212
<i>Remember, Clay?</i>

1457
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,113
I am remembering.

1458
01:13:33,182 --> 01:13:35,650
I'm watching the TV.
What do you want from me?

1459
01:13:35,718 --> 01:13:37,242
No, you're not. Look.

1460
01:13:39,656 --> 01:13:41,146
You're listening.

1461
01:13:41,224 --> 01:13:42,691
...are we going to talk about this, Lilith?

1462
01:13:42,759 --> 01:13:44,090
How many fucking times?

1463
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,025
I don't want to remember anymore.

1464
01:13:46,095 --> 01:13:47,926
- Jesus, don't you ever shut up?
- You never did.

1465
01:13:47,997 --> 01:13:49,294
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

1466
01:13:49,365 --> 01:13:50,593
This is bullshit.

1467
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:53,966
This is just
my imagination, that's all.

1468
01:13:54,037 --> 01:13:55,527
Just watch.

1469
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:57,538
Come on, Clayton. Come on.

1470
01:13:57,607 --> 01:13:59,837
- No change.
- Give me 300.

1471
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:02,742
Start mixing amio.

1472
01:14:02,812 --> 01:14:04,803
- Clayton, come on.
- Charge.

1473
01:14:04,881 --> 01:14:05,905
Clear.

1474
01:14:08,885 --> 01:14:09,852
Daddy?

1475
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:15,113
Hey! Hey! Stop talking.

1476
01:14:18,595 --> 01:14:19,857
Dad.

1477
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:22,898
All right, I heard you the first time!

1478
01:14:22,966 --> 01:14:25,628
Come on, Clayton. It's Christmas.

1479
01:14:25,702 --> 01:14:27,431
Put it on.

1480
01:14:27,503 --> 01:14:28,765
Ah!

1481
01:14:28,838 --> 01:14:31,568
- Daddy, please!
- Fucking bitch. Jesus!

1482
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:33,268
Don't you two ever shut up?

1483
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,038
This is what you want, Lilith, isn't it?

1484
01:14:35,111 --> 01:14:36,373
Huh? How's this look?

1485
01:14:36,446 --> 01:14:37,435
This make you happy?

1486
01:14:37,513 --> 01:14:38,571
Daddy, please!

1487
01:14:38,648 --> 01:14:39,580
All right. That's it!

1488
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:41,014
Please leave him alone.

1489
01:14:41,084 --> 01:14:43,075
Couldn't keep your mouth shut,
could you, Clay?

1490
01:14:43,152 --> 01:14:44,312
- Clayton.
- Come here.

1491
01:14:44,387 --> 01:14:46,412
- Please.
- Come here!

1492
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:47,615
- Clayton!
- Come here!

1493
01:14:59,569 --> 01:15:01,503
I said leave him alone.

1494
01:15:35,104 --> 01:15:36,537
- Still in fib.
- Give me 360.

1495
01:15:36,606 --> 01:15:39,200
- We lost him.
- No. Again.

1496
01:15:39,275 --> 01:15:41,368
- 360.
- Clear.

1497
01:15:48,985 --> 01:15:51,419
You didn't want to remember, Clay.

1498
01:15:53,589 --> 01:15:55,716
I let you forget
because I thought the truth

1499
01:15:55,792 --> 01:16:00,161
would be too hard to live with.

1500
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:03,130
I thought I was protecting you.

1501
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:07,101
But all I did
was cause you more pain.

1502
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,331
I am so sorry.

1503
01:16:11,774 --> 01:16:15,972
I'm not proud
of what I became, Clay,

1504
01:16:16,045 --> 01:16:19,276
but I am proud
of what you've become.

1505
01:16:19,348 --> 01:16:22,408
You're a hundred times
the man he was.

1506
01:16:24,987 --> 01:16:26,955
You always were.

1507
01:16:38,434 --> 01:16:40,959
It's time for you to live.

1508
01:17:07,096 --> 01:17:08,063
Clayton...

1509
01:17:08,131 --> 01:17:09,598
Stop.

1510
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,258
We got him.

1511
01:17:15,738 --> 01:17:17,933
Welcome back, Clayton.

1512
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:21,477
Welcome back.

1513
01:17:28,684 --> 01:17:32,381
<i>At 6:32 this morning,</i>

1514
01:17:32,455 --> 01:17:36,915

1515
01:17:36,993 --> 01:17:41,794

died on my operating table.</i>

1516
01:17:45,301 --> 01:17:50,568

1517
01:17:53,276 --> 01:17:57,679

1518
01:17:57,747 --> 01:18:00,511
<i>There's no defense,</i>

1519
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:02,551
<i>no one to blame but us.</i>

1520
01:18:04,787 --> 01:18:07,984
<i>We got what we deserved.</i>

1521
01:18:08,057 --> 01:18:11,322
<i>Clay would have his revenge,</i>

1522
01:18:11,394 --> 01:18:14,363

1523
