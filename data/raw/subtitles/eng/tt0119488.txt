1
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,880
Come to Los Angeles.

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,960
The sun shines bright.

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,280
The beaches are wide and inviting.

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,560
And the orange groves
stretch as far as the eye can see.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,440
There are jobs aplenty. Land is cheap.

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,600
Every workingman can have his own house.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,480
And inside every house,
a happy all-American family.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,520
You can have all this.
And who knows?

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,120
You could even be discovered...

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
...become a movie star,
or at least see one.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,080
Life is good in Los Angeles.

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,080
It's paradise on earth.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,680
That's what they tell you, anyway.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,640
Because they're selling an image.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,680
They're selling it through movies,
radio and television.

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,760
In the hit show, Badge of Honor,
the L.A. cops walk on water...

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,280
...as they keep the city
clean of crooks.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,280
You'd think this place
was the Garden of Eden.

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,080
But there's trouble in paradise...

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,600
...and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,
Mickey C, to his fans.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,920
Local L.A. color to the nth degree.

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,120
And his number one bodyguard...

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,000
...Johnny Stompanato.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,120
Mickey C's the head
of organized crime in these parts.

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,640
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,120
He kills a dozen people a year.

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,400
And the dapper little gent
does it in style.

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,600
And every time his picture's
on the front page...

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,760
...it's a black eye
for the image of Los Angeles.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,480
Because how can organized crime exist...

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,800
...in the city with the best
police force in the world?

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,160
Something has to be done.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,680
But nothing too original,
because, hey, this is Hollywood.

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,880
What worked for Al Capone
would work for the Mickster.

35
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,400
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.

36
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,960
Nonpayment of federal income tax.

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,640
But all is not well.

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,000
Sending Mickey up has created a vacuum.

39
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,760
And it's only a matter of time...

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,880
...before someone
with balls of brass tries to fill it.

41
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,400
"Remember, dear readers...

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,600
...you heard it here first...

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,240
...off the record...

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,600
...on the q.t...

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
...and very...

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,520
...Hush-Hush."

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,120
You're like Santa Claus with that list.

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,640
Except everyone on it's been naughty.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,280
Guy's been out of Q two weeks.

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
Leave it for later.

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,880
We've got to pick up the booze
and get it to the station.

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,560
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Have Central send a prowler
to 4216 Evergreen.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
Parole violation:
assault arising from a family dispute.

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,360
We won't be here.
They'll see him.

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,640
Quit whining!

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,240
Quit whining all the time!
It makes me sick!

58
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,280
Shut up!

59
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,200
Who the hell are you?

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,640
The ghost of Christmas past.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,840
Dance with a man for a change?

62
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,480
What are you, a smart ass?

63
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,400
You'll be out in a year and a half.

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,880
I'll get cozy with your parole officer.

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,400
You touch her again, I'll have you
violated on a kiddie raper beef.

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,160
You know what they do
to kiddie rapers in Quentin.

67
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,520
You have someplace you can go?

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,600
Go get yourself fixed up.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,400
Merry Christmas.

70
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,680
-Merry Christmas, ma'am.
-Let's go, Bud.

71
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,880
The guys'll be waiting.

72
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,440
What do you do on Badge of Honor?

73
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,280
I'm the technical advisor.

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,880
I teach Brett Chase
how to walk and talk like a cop.

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,320
Brett Chase doesn't
walk and talk like you.

76
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,680
That's because he's
the television version.

77
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,280
America isn't ready for the real me.

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,240
Is it true you're the one
who arrested Bob Mitchum?

79
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,480
Badge of Honor guys pretend.

80
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,240
But being the real thing
must be a thrill.

81
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,880
Why don't we go someplace quiet?
I'll give you the lowdown on Mitchum.

82
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,960
Big V. Jack Vincennes.

83
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,920
-May I have this dance?
-Of course.

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,360
This is Sid Hudgens
with Hush-Hush magazine.

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,960
-Hello, Karen.
-Hello yourself.

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,240
What's that about?

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,440
We did a piece, "Ingenue Dykes in
Hollywood." Her name got mentioned.

88
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,560
Jackie-boy...

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,960
...a friend just sold some reefer
to Matt Reynolds.

90
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,240
He's tripping the light fantastic
with Tammy Jordan.

91
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,280
Sorry, I lost you for a second, Sid.

92
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,320
Contract players, Metro. You pinch
them, I do a nice feature next issue.

93
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,360
-Plus the usual $50 cash.
-No, I need another $50.

94
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,080
Two $20's for two patrolmen, a dime for
the Hollywood Station watch commander.

95
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,960
Jackie, it's Christmas.

96
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,480
No, it's not.

97
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,960
It's felony possession of marijuana.

98
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,040
Actually, it's circulation 36,000
and climbing.

99
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,920
There's no telling where this will go.
Radio, television.

100
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,080
Once you whet the public's appetite
for the truth, the sky's the limit.

101
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,680
Sergeant Ed Exley,
son of the legendary Preston Exley.

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,120
Must be a hard act to follow.

103
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Why not make a mark somewhere else?
Why become a cop, Ed?

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,920
I like to help people.

105
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,840
We heard 2 officers
were assaulted this evening.

106
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,720
-What do you think about that?
-Goes with the job.

107
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,600
I took the report.
Luckily, they're okay.

108
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,640
Aren't you young
to be watch commander?

109
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
It's only tonight.

110
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,760
The married men have Christmas Eve off.

111
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,640
That's a good lead for the story.

112
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,240
Merry Christmas, Captain.

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,480
-Captain Smith.
-Drop the formalities, Bobby.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,480
-It's Christmas Eve, call me Dudley.
-I came up with a title for the story.

115
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,160
I'm calling it
"Silent Night with the LAPD."

116
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,440
That's grand.

117
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,360
Now remember, Bobby, that's "Smith."

118
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,080
With an "S."

119
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,960
Thank you, gentlemen.
Merry Christmas.

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,240
Hold on there, lads.

121
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,720
Merry Christmas.

122
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,360
I saw the test results
on the lieutenant's exam.

123
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,000
First out of 23.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,280
What'll it be, then?

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,040
Patrol Division?
Internal Affairs? What?

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
I was thinking
Detective Bureau.

127
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,880
Edmund...

128
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,960
...you're a political animal.

129
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,440
You have the eye for human weakness,
but not the stomach.

130
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,280
You're wrong, sir.

131
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,680
Would you be willing to plant evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty...

132
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,120
...in order to insure an indictment?

133
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,440
-We've been over this.
-Yes or no?

134
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,200
No.

135
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,040
Would you beat a confession
out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?

136
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,840
Would you shoot
a hardened criminal in the back...

137
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,160
...in order to offset the chance
that some lawyer--

138
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,960
Then for the love of God...

139
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,880
...don't be a detective.

140
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,880
Work where you don't have
to make those kind of choices.

141
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,160
Dudley, I know you mean well...

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,400
...but I don't need to do it
the way you did...or my father.

143
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,040
At least get rid of the glasses.

144
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,240
I can't think of a man
on the Bureau who wears them.

145
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,840
If I get held up,
you guys better be here.

146
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,440
Hi, Nick.

147
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
I need a delivery.

148
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,120
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.

149
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,800
Sounds like a hell of a party.
Be right with you.

150
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,640
Merry Christmas.

151
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,440
Merry Christmas to you, officer.

152
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,840
That obvious?

153
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,120
It's practically
stamped on your forehead.

154
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,880
There you go.

155
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,560
See what he wants, Buzz.

156
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,400
Get lost, why don't you?

157
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,520
Down!
Get your fucking head down.

158
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,360
I got a license for that.

159
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,680
Cut me some slack.

160
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,960
I used to be a cop.

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,360
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.

162
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,880
They call me Buzz.

163
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,600
I don't give a rat's ass what
they call you. Keep your head down.

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,160
And stay there...Buzz.

165
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,160
You okay?

166
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,520
She's fine.

167
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,320
I'm not asking you, sir.

168
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,280
Somebody hit you?

169
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,480
It's not what you think.

170
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,600
What is it, then?

171
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,520
You got the wrong idea, mister.
I'm fine.

172
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,960
But it's nice to know you care.

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,320
Drive safely.

174
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,280
What's going on?

175
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,160
You know him?

176
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,440
Yeah, I've seen him around.

177
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,720
He used to be a cop.

178
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,320
They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on the Christmas tree.

179
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,160
Put your camera right there.

180
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,160
When I walk out, I'll stop here. Get
the movie premiere in the background.

181
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,720
I like it. I like it.
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust."

182
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,920
When I walk out, I don't want
your floodlights in my eyes.

183
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,400
Consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?

184
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,360
Come on.

185
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,440
Get down.

186
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,120
Go! Pop them!

187
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,720
Freeze! Police!

188
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,720
Jesus Christ!

189
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,400
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

190
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,480
My family's coming in--

191
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,320
-It'll be a nice Christmas gift.
-Hi, Tammy. Hi, Matt.

192
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
Right over here.

193
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,360
-Just turn.
-Hold it. Got it!

194
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,760
-The Movie Premiere Pot Bust!
-Take them in. I'll get the evidence.

195
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,560
"It's Christmas Eve
in the City of Angels...

196
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,040
...and while decent citizens
sleep the sleep of the righteous...

197
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,360
...hopheads prowl for marijuana...

198
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,960
...not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them:

199
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,360
Celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes.

200
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,120
Scourge of grasshoppers
and dope fiends everywhere."

201
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,960
You like it?

202
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,840
Yeah, subtle.

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,120
What took you?

204
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,760
My partner stopped
to help a damsel in distress.

205
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,640
His priorities are all screwed up.

206
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,080
Up to your old tricks again, Bud?

207
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,760
Hollywood Jack, what brings you
to our humble station house?

208
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
-How are you?
-Why are you here?

209
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,240
You know me.
Keeping the streets safe.

210
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,880
Take these two,
get them dressed and book them.

211
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,760
-The party's upstairs.
-Okay, I'll be right up.

212
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,240
What's that for?

213
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,160
You are watch commander tonight,
aren't you?

214
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,880
Yeah. So?

215
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,880
A gratuity from Hush-Hush magazine.

216
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,720
Buy yourself some new loafers.

217
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,480
No thanks, Jack.
You keep your payoff.

218
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm not interested.

219
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,160
What the hell is this?

220
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
Six spics.

221
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,560
Mexicans, sir. The ones who assaulted
Brown and Helenowski.

222
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,360
I heard Helenowski bled 6 pints
and Brown's in a coma.

223
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,040
They have bruises
and muscle pulls.

224
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,200
It's not what I heard.

225
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,680
Get them into lock up.

226
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,360
Stens, you guys hear what those taco
benders did to Helenowski and Brown?

227
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,800
Helenowski lost an eye, and they're
reading Brown his last rites.

228
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,320
That ought to make for
a very merry Christmas for them.

229
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,800
Hey, guys.

230
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Guys.

231
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,200
They brought the Mexicans in.

232
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,720
They're downstairs.

233
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,000
-Let's do it.
-Come on, guys. Let's get them.

234
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,120
Stensland, the party's upstairs.

235
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,400
This doesn't concern you.

236
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,280
Come on, guys.

237
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,680
Haven't you got work?

238
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,000
Go back to the party.

239
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,760
-Come on, it's Christmas, help me out.
-Move it!

240
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,920
I just got a few more questions.

241
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,480
You don't have to be here.

242
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Go!

243
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,040
You better put a leash on your partner
before he kills somebody.

244
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,640
Teach him a lesson!
Get him, Stens!

245
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,720
This is for ours, Poncho.

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,080
Let me through!

247
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,360
No! He didn't do nothing!

248
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,400
What are you looking at?

249
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,200
Tell that Mexican to shut up!

250
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Move!

251
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,520
You're sick!

252
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,640
That's it!

253
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,080
Don't break it up.

254
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,960
Get back! Get back!

255
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,840
Yeah, and fuck your mother!

256
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,880
Fuck you!

257
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,840
Stop, officer!
That's an order!

258
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,000
You'll all be in my report!

259
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
"Bloody Christmas."

260
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,840
The press love to label.

261
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,200
You should know this is bigger
than the police board.

262
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,720
The grand jury's convening.
Indictments may be handed down.

263
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,640
Will you testify?

264
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,840
No, sir. I won't.

265
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,840
District Attorney Loew?

266
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,840
You and officer Stensland
brought the liquor to the station.

267
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,440
Stensland was already drunk.

268
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,160
Appearing as a
voluntary witness against him...

269
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,040
...could offset damage to yourself.

270
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,320
I won't testify against him,
or anyone else.

271
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,840
This man is a disgrace.

272
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,720
Your badge and gun, officer.

273
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,560
You're suspended from duty.

274
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,800
Dismissed.

275
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,960
We need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the Department.

276
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,960
Justice has to be served.
Of course I'll testify.

277
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,200
I'm glad you feel that way, Edmund.

278
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,360
Most don't.

279
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,480
They think silence and integrity
are the same thing.

280
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,320
Not exactly the image of the...

281
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,520
...new LAPD we're trying to create.

282
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,840
Welcome to Los Angeles,
the city of the future.

283
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,440
-May I make a suggestion, sir?
-By all means.

284
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,160
The public will expect the Department
to sweep this under the carpet.

285
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,200
Don't.

286
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,000
Shift the guilt to men
whose pensions are secured.

287
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Force them to retire.

288
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,720
But somebody has to swing.

289
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,920
So indict, try and convict...

290
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,800
...Richard Stensland and Bud White.

291
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,920
Secure them jail time.

292
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,680
The message will be clear.

293
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,360
This Department...

294
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,440
...will not tolerate officers
who think they're above the law.

295
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,120
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment
as a policeman.

296
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,000
He's had rotten fitness reports
from every C.O. he's served under.

297
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,160
But Bud White is a valuable officer.

298
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,800
White's a mindless thug.

299
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,640
No, Edmund...

300
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,240
...but he can answer "yes" to those
questions I've asked you before.

301
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,400
The Department and the public
need role models.

302
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,600
Clean-cut, forthright men
the public can admire.

303
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,560
Sergeant...

304
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
...I'll promote you...

305
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,440
...to lieutenant...

306
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,160
...effective immediately.

307
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Detective Lieutenant.

308
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Ed, you're 30.

309
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,480
Your father didn't make lieutenant
till he was 33.

310
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,600
I know that, sir. When he made
lieutenant, it was as a detective.

311
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,680
Before we start polishing our laurels...

312
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
...it'd look better if we had
a corroborative witness.

313
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,400
That won't be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.

314
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,680
Jack Vincennes.

315
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,320
He hit one of the Mexicans.

316
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,920
A veteran like Vincennes might be
willing to admit his own culpability...

317
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,200
...but he'd never rat out
a fellow officer.

318
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,960
Jack's the technical advisor
on Badge of Honor.

319
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
He lives for it.

320
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,040
That's how to get to him.

321
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,480
I'd like you to observe, Ed.

322
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
Call Sergeant Vincennes.

323
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,440
Bright kid.

324
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,680
You may reap the benefit...

325
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,840
...but are you ready to be despised
in the Department?

326
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,520
Yes, sir, I am.

327
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
So be it.

328
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,880
Sergeant, we'll get right to it.

329
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,760
Nine civilian witnesses have identified
you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.

330
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,640
But we have a witness who will name
names and testify that you hit back...

331
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,720
...only after being hit.

332
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,480
You will testify against 3 officers...

333
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,880
...who have earned their pensions
and plead ignorance about the rest.

334
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,480
No thanks.
I'm not a snitch.

335
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,360
I'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist,
a brief suspension...

336
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,720
...followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Vice.

337
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,560
You transfer out of Vice,
you'll be back on the show.

338
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,960
The show?

339
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Badge of Honor, Vincennes.

340
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,720
We need to tone down
your profile for a bit.

341
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,520
I doubt you've ever taken
a stupid breath. Don't start now.

342
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,560
Okay, I'll do it.

343
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
The grand jury will hear...

344
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,160
...your testimony tomorrow.

345
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,840
And so it goes...

346
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,960
...Detective Lieutenant.

347
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Ace them at the
grand jury tomorrow, son.

348
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,160
Wear a smart-looking suit
and ace them.

349
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,720
And Ed...

350
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
...lose the glasses.

351
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,480
So you're the stellar witness.

352
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,360
I should have known.
What's the Chief throwing you?

353
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
Throwing me?

354
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,280
Yeah, Exley, what's the payoff?

355
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,360
You're the payoff expert.

356
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,600
I'm just doing my duty.

357
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,760
Come on, you're playing
an angle here, college boy.

358
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,000
You'll get something so you
don't have to hobnob with the cops...

359
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,480
...who'll hate you for snitching.

360
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,520
If they're making you detective,
watch out.

361
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,400
Some Bureau guys will burn in this and
you'll be working with their friends.

362
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,720
What about you?

363
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm snitching 3 old-timers who'll be
fishing in Oregon next week.

364
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,840
Next to you, I'm clean...

365
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,120
...and smart.

366
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Edmund J. Exley to chambers.

367
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,960
And remember...

368
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,040
...Bud White will fuck you for this
if it takes the rest of his life.

369
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Captain, what do you want?

370
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,080
Call me Dudley.

371
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Dudley...

372
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,520
...what do you want?

373
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,680
Look, lad, I admire
your refusal to testify...

374
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,640
...and your loyalty to your partner.

375
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,000
I admire you as a policeman...

376
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,200
...and your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job.

377
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,840
I'm impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters.

378
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,680
Do you hate them, Wendell?

379
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,280
What do you want?

380
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
They're yours.

381
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Take them.

382
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,120
There's no bill on me?

383
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,000
-4 witnesses recanted their testimony.
-Why?

384
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,280
They had a change of heart.

385
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
Stensland?

386
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
Your partner's through.

387
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
Scapegoat on the Chief's orders.

388
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,640
A year from his pension.

389
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,000
-Exley!
-Exley got what he wanted.

390
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,480
As a politician he exceeds even myself.

391
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,880
The Department needs
smart men like Exley...

392
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,400
...and direct men...

393
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,080
...like you.

394
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,960
Look, I need you for an assignment
the Chief's given me.

395
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,120
A duty few men are fit for...

396
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,680
...but you were born for.

397
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,120
You'd be working
out of Homicide at City Hall.

398
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,080
Homicide?

399
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,600
Working cases?

400
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,440
Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.

401
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,320
It's a muscle job.

402
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,080
You'll do as I say and ask no questions.
Do you follow my drift?

403
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,160
In Technicolor, sir.

404
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,400
"Meet Tony Brancato
and Anthony Trombino...

405
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,760
...two rising lieutenants
in the Mickey Cohen rackets.

406
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,560
With the dapper little gent in prison...

407
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,000
...who knows how far they'll go.
The sky's the limit.

408
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,880
Oh, well."

409
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,600
"Meet Deuce Perkins,
Mickey Cohen's narcotics lieutenant.

410
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,520
Could he be behind the hits?

411
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,200
Is he consolidating
organized crime power?

412
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
I suppose not.

413
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,120
One thing's for sure:

414
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,920
2-man triggers are punching the tickets
on the Mickster's muscle."

415
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,680
"Meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD...

416
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,760
...has set up a not-so-Welcome Wagon
to dishearten the criminal element...

417
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,760
...from filling the void left by
Mickey's absence.

418
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,680
When I know more, dear readers,
so will you.

419
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,400
Off the record, on the q.t...

420
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,000
...and very...

421
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,040
...Hush-Hush."

422
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,520
With Mickey Cohen in prison,
Los Angeles is organized crime-free.

423
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,000
The Chief wants to keep it that way.

424
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,440
In Cleveland, you're an
organized crime associate...

425
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,480
...in desperate need of re-education
in the ways of polite society.

426
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,040
I hear things.

427
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,160
Like those 2-men shooter teams.

428
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,440
They're 86ing Cohen's lieutenants.

429
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,040
What do you want?

430
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,480
We want you to go home.

431
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,560
Picture-book smut, men.

432
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,760
There's been a bunch of this
found at crime scenes lately.

433
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,600
Quality ranges from piss-poor to...

434
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,200
...very well done.

435
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Look who's back from suspension.

436
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,040
We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

437
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,880
Look at that.
The Great Jerk-Off Case of 1953.

438
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,000
Is there someplace you'd rather be?

439
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,880
Yeah, working Narcotics,
looking for Cohen's missing H.

440
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,240
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin
would get you plenty of ink.

441
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,120
You should've thought of that
before Bloody Christmas.

442
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,880
Make a major case. It's the only way
you'll get out of here.

443
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,240
Dismissed, gentlemen.

444
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,120
Go get the facts, Jack.

445
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,040
Just the facts.

446
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,680
Whatever you desire.

447
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,840
Hi. I'd like to get a delivery
to Beverly Hills.

448
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,640
I don't know you.

449
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,320
A friend just gave me this number
and I wanted to find out if--

450
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,040
Would you grab a reverse directory
and shag a name and address for me?

451
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,520
Crestview-2239.

452
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,840
Hush-Hush, off the record
and on the q.t.

453
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,760
Sid, it's Vincennes.

454
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,560
Jackie, you back on narco?
I need some good copy.

455
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,440
I have something going with Vice.

456
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,080
Something juicy for the Sidster?

457
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,560
Tracking porn.
Arty, high-class stuff.

458
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,920
Know about Fleur-de-Lis?
Slogan's "Whatever you desire."

459
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,360
No, I've heard bupkes.

460
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,520
Get me some narco skinny.
I want to do an all-hophead issue.

461
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,560
Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.
You like it?

462
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,600
I'll talk to you later.

463
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,440
-What do you got?
-The number's not assigned.

464
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,360
Thanks, Ginger.

465
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
A bootleg.

466
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,320
Take it easy.

467
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,000
Tough break, Stens.

468
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,400
We're going to miss you.

469
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Raw deal, Stensland.

470
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,040
Here comes the snitch.

471
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Sorry about that, Lieutenant.

472
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,400
Stay out of trouble, Bud.

473
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,000
I got a few hours.
I'll buy you a drink.

474
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,280
Rain check.
I got a hot date.

475
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,280
Who is she and
what did you arrest her for?

476
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,920
It's confidential.

477
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,640
Like that magazine that
Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush.

478
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,800
I'll see you later in the week.

479
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,280
We'll do the town, on me.

480
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,600
Yeah. I'll bring
my wallet just in case.

481
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,640
-See you tomorrow.
-Hang on!

482
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,720
I'll walk down with you.

483
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,800
Punk kid.
Who is he trying to impress?

484
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,600
Yeah, I wonder.

485
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,160
Got himself a real career going.

486
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,640
Sergeant Williams, pick up, please.

487
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Sergeant Williams?

488
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,280
Is there anybody up there in Homicide?

489
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,440
Anybody there?

490
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,680
Lieutenant Exley.

491
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,960
You've got a homicide downtown.

492
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,200
-The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
-I got it.

493
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,040
It's mine.

494
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,240
At least one person's dead.
I stopped for coffee.

495
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,160
No one comes through the front door.
Understand?

496
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,520
I want barricades at both ends
of the street. Make sure--

497
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,280
I took the call. It's my case.

498
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,040
You don't want it and you can't have it.

499
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,920
I took the call.

500
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,280
It's mine.

501
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,320
I'll make you my second-in-command.

502
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,160
Captain, over here, please.

503
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,120
The cook drew a gun and set it off.
The rest died in the men's room.

504
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,760
Sir...

505
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,200
...we got a total of 15 spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.

506
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,440
I'm betting 3 men, 5-shot capacity
pumps, all of them emptying once.

507
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,240
Excuse me, we got an I.D.
on one of the victims.

508
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,680
It's Dick Stensland.

509
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,960
At first, I thought
she was Rita Hayworth.

510
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,240
Yeah, me too.

511
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,800
Hell of a way to avoid prison.

512
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,040
What happened?

513
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,360
Appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.

514
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,360
The guy at the register pulled a .38,
so they killed him.

515
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,240
Then they killed everyone else.

516
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,320
Lieutenant, we're ready
with that Nite Owl I.D.

517
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,160
Is this your daughter?

518
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I don't know.

519
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,960
We know this is difficult.
Take your time.

520
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,720
It seems like my Susan.

521
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,840
But my Susan was a blonde,
not a redhead.

522
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,640
When was the last time you saw her?

523
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,000
Just before Christmas.

524
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,560
We'd fought.
I didn't like her boyfriend.

525
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,880
Mrs. Lefferts...

526
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
...does your daughter have
any distinguishing marks?

527
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,720
You got the wrong idea, mister.
I'm fine.

528
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,640
She has a birthmark on her hip.

529
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,360
It's her.

530
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,120
My baby!

531
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,920
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.

532
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,440
Who's in charge of this investigation?

533
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,080
Captain Smith and myself.
Why?

534
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,960
"The Nite Owl Massacre."

535
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,000
Hyperbole aside...

536
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,160
...this is a heinous crime
that requires swift resolution.

537
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,480
Six victims.

538
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,600
One of them, one of our own.
Dick Stensland.

539
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,320
He was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

540
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,120
Robbery is the likely motive.

541
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,200
We have rubber glove smears
on the register and forensics...

542
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,840
...tend toward a trio of shooters.
We do have one hot lead.

543
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,680
Three Negro juveniles...

544
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,720
...were seen discharging shotguns
in Griffith Park.

545
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,960
A park ranger I.D.'d them
as driving a 1948-1950 Mercury coupe...

546
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,800
...maroon in color.

547
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,360
An hour ago a canvassing crew
found a news vendor...

548
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,120
...who saw a maroon Merc coupe
parked by the Nite Owl at 1 a.m.

549
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,200
DMV has come up with
a registration list of Merc coupes.

550
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,880
48 two-man teams will shake
three names apiece.

551
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,600
Interrogations will be led by
Lt. Edmund Exley.

552
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,960
Enough on that!

553
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,120
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.
Use all necessary force.

554
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,000
The people of Los Angeles demand it.

555
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,640
Dismissed.

556
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,000
Why not just put a bounty on them?

557
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,280
-Ready to roll?
-You take them, I got something to do.

558
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,040
What if one of these names--?

559
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,640
Get somebody else.

560
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,720
I got our assignments, Big V.

561
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,040
We go by this list, we got
zero chance of making this collar.

562
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,480
I got a guy who knows what happens south
of Jefferson. He'll put us at 50-50.

563
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,640
What are you doing?

564
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,880
It's the same sort of thing
that got you in trouble before.

565
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,160
I'll take those odds.

566
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,520
We got it from here.

567
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,240
You two should
bring along a photographer.

568
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,600
I need an address on a customer
of yours. Her name is Lynn.

569
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,160
-That's all I got to go on?
-Yeah.

570
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,040
You already know who I mean,
so cough it up.

571
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,560
There's a billing address
and a delivery address.

572
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,520
Are you Pierce Patchett?

573
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,720
I am.

574
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,280
Are you soliciting for police charities?
Last time you called my office.

575
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,160
Go on down to the driveway.
We'll talk there.

576
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,920
What can I do for you?

577
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,800
-Where were you last night?
-I was here hosting a party.

578
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,680
Tell me about Dick Stensland.

579
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,080
I don't know him, Mr.--?

580
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,560
Officer White.

581
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,760
You know Sue Lefferts?

582
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,480
You know I do.
You saw me with her.

583
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
How did you find me?

584
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Nick's Liquor. This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

585
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,920
Of course.

586
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,920
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.

587
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm investigating.

588
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,560
Everything all right?

589
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,880
Fine, Phillip, thank you.

590
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,400
What happened to the other guy, Buzz?

591
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,880
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.

592
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,480
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve
but didn't act it. Why?

593
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,240
I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket. She is...was...

594
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
...a big doubles fan.

595
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,080
You're a known associate of a woman
killed in a mass murder.

596
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,200
-Want to go downtown to discuss this?
-Is this official?

597
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,560
Somehow I have the feeling
this is more personal with you.

598
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,400
All right, then...

599
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:24,160
...are you concerned about criminal
matters peripheral to the murders?

600
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,400
-Not at the moment.
-You're not obligated to report them?

601
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,400
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

602
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,560
I needed a Rita Hayworth
to fill out my little studio.

603
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,440
What little studio?

604
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,720
Well, there's Gardner, Russell,
Monroe, Turner....

605
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,840
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.

606
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,720
I use girls that look like movie stars.

607
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,440
Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.

608
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,280
When the work was done,
that's when you saw us.

609
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,600
It's why her mom couldn't I.D. her.

610
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,480
Jesus fucking Christ!

611
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,800
No, Pierce Morehouse Patchett.

612
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,720
I sense you're on your best behavior,
but that's all I'm saying.

613
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,800
If you persist,
we'll meet with my attorney.

614
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,000
Would you like Lynn Bracken's address?

615
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
I got her address.

616
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,960
Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.

617
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,440
I'll give you a handsome reward.

618
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,160
Whatever you desire!

619
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,160
I know you're not asleep.

620
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,440
What do you want?

621
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,120
My 5 bucks.

622
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,840
It was the only one I had.

623
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,880
Right now?

624
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,040
Hey, doll face,
tell him to leave us alone.

625
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,440
I understand.
Okay, fine.

626
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,720
Oh, baby...

627
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,320
...bad news.

628
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,520
You have to go.

629
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,840
Go?

630
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,040
Something very important has come up
and you have to go.

631
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,680
I'll make it up to you.

632
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,480
I will, I promise.
Excuse me.

633
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,000
Is it the cops?

634
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,600
Miss Bracken...

635
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,640
...I'm Officer White.

636
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,720
I've been expecting you,
just not this soon.

637
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,480
Pierce called.
He told me what happened to Sue.

638
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,760
Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?

639
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Hit the road.

640
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,320
Maybe I will...

641
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,240
...maybe I won't.

642
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,600
LAPD. Get out of here
or I'll have your wife come get you.

643
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,520
-Officer.
-Councilman.

644
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,200
-Would you care for a drink?
-Yeah, Scotch straight.

645
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,280
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't friends.

646
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,320
Know what I mean?

647
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
You sorry she's dead?

648
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,480
Of course I am.

649
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,720
What kind of question is that?

650
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,080
Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?

651
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,560
Use words like that,
you might make me mad.

652
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,720
But, do you know?

653
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,080
Yeah, I know.

654
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,960
Patchett's running whores...

655
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,200
...cut to look like movie stars.

656
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,040
And, judging by his address,
something bigger on the side.

657
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,680
He doesn't want any attention.

658
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,720
That's right. Our motives are selfish
so we're cooperating.

659
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,600
So cooperate. Why was
Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

660
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,360
I don't know. I never heard of
the Nite Owl till today.

661
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,160
How'd she meet Patchett?

662
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,200
Pierce meets people.

663
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,560
Sue had dreams of Hollywood
and this is how they turned out.

664
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,720
Thanks to Pierce,
we still get to act a little.

665
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,160
Tell me about Pierce.

666
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,360
He's waiting for you to mention money.

667
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,000
Want advice, Miss Bracken?

668
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
It's Lynn.

669
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,000
Miss Bracken...

670
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,520
...don't ever try to fucking bribe me...

671
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,040
...or I'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.

672
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,400
I remember you from Christmas Eve.

673
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,760
You have a thing
for helping women, don't you?

674
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,960
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

675
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,840
-You say "fuck" a lot.
-You fuck for money.

676
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,160
There's blood on your shirt.

677
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,120
An integral part of your job?

678
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,960
-Yeah.
-Do you enjoy it?

679
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,000
When they deserve it.

680
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,720
Did they deserve it today?

681
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,240
I'm not sure.

682
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,920
-But you did it anyway.
-Yeah.

683
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,000
Like the half dozen guys
you screwed today.

684
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,120
Actually, it was only two.

685
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,320
You're different, Officer White.

686
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,480
You're the first man in years who didn't
tell me I look like Veronica Lake.

687
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,760
You look better than Veronica Lake.

688
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,880
Pierce Patchett?

689
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,600
He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.

690
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,920
He doesn't let us use narcotics
and he doesn't abuse us.

691
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,080
Can your policeman's mentality
grasp those contradictions?

692
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,000
He had you cut
to look like Veronica Lake.

693
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,840
No.

694
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,640
I'm really a brunette,
but the rest is me.

695
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,840
And that's all the news
that's fit to print.

696
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,800
It's nice meeting you.

697
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,520
-I'd like to see you again.
-For a date...

698
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,720
...or an appointment?

699
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,720
I don't know.

700
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,160
-For a date, I'd know your first name.
-Forget I asked.

701
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,040
It was a mistake.

702
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,160
Leonard Bidwell?

703
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,320
Come down here and talk to us.

704
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,440
How's the left these days?

705
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,880
What's it to you?

706
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.

707
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
I like your style.

708
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,000
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

709
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,320
You got a brother in Folsom.
I put him there.

710
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,200
Until 1970.

711
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,600
How'd you like to make it 1960?

712
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,200
I know the judge,
and Lieutenant Exley...

713
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,440
...is good friends with the D.A.

714
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,440
We're looking for 3 colored guys
who like to shoot shotguns.

715
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,440
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe.

716
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,000
-Want me to snitch?
-Want to buy your brother 10 years?

717
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,720
-It was 10 years, right?
-Yeah, 10 years.

718
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,320
You don't have to say anything,
just look at this list...

719
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,640
...and point.

720
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,960
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.

721
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,520
Sugar Ray Collins.

722
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,120
Drives a maroon '49 coupe.

723
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
Beautiful ride.

724
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,360
Don't know about shotguns,
but he gets his thrills killing dogs.

725
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,200
He's righteous trash.

726
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,080
Look at that. It's five minutes
from here. Thanks.

727
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,200
I'll hear from you...

728
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,560
...about my brother?

729
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,120
Keep it up, Lenny. Up!

730
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,040
There it is.
It's in the back.

731
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,240
-One of ours.
-Shit, somebody beat us here!

732
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,960
Damn it!

733
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,880
My glasses!

734
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,200
You're kidding!

735
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,760
Well, just don't shoot me.

736
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,880
What are you doing here?

737
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,480
We were in the neighborhood.

738
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,520
-What do you got?
-Three 12-gauge pumps.

739
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
And cash.

740
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,160
So long, Vice.
Badge of Honor, here I come.

741
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,840
Fuck you!
This is our collar.

742
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,960
Quiet!

743
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,240
I'm ranking officer here.
We go as a team. End of story.

744
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,720
Right.

745
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,120
How many ways in?

746
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,760
Only one.
Up the stairs.

747
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,960
He's very serious.

748
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,480
Police!

749
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,720
Don't shoot!

750
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,760
-Don't move.
-Ace him, Jack!

751
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,560
Shut up.

752
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,200
Anxious, aren't you?

753
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,400
Don't kill them.

754
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,120
Back, back, back!

755
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,520
Get off me!

756
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,160
Against the wall!

757
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,200
-Put your hands up!
-Get over there.

758
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,000
Shut up!
Hands behind your back!

759
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,960
So...

760
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,520
...how's it feel
getting out of the office?

761
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,680
This came from forensics.

762
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,200
"Burning clothes.

763
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,400
Casitas Youth Camp...."

764
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,520
It's crowded in here, White.

765
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,760
These guys killed Stensland.

766
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,640
The ejection marks
on the shells fired from the shotguns...

767
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,880
...are identical to those on the
shell casings found at the Nite Owl.

768
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,840
I want confessions, Edmund.

769
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,040
A night's stewing
has softened them up.

770
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,760
I'll break them, sir.

771
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,360
Are you sure golden boy
is up to the task, Cap?

772
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,880
I think you'd be surprised
what the lad is capable of.

773
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,640
You're 22.
Aren't you, Ray?

774
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,600
Did an officer work you over?

775
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,880
-You're 22, right?
-Why do you keep asking that?

776
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,360
22 makes it a gas chamber bounce.

777
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,000
You should've pulled
this caper years ago.

778
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,560
Get life,
do a little Youth Authority jolt...

779
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,160
...transfer to Folsom a big man...

780
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,280
...get yourself a sissy....

781
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,320
I don't truck with no sissies.

782
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,160
Louis.

783
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,600
What?

784
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,040
You did the Casitas Youth Camp
with Louis.

785
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,200
Why you keep asking me about Louis?
His business is his business.

786
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,680
Sugar, Louis told me
you went sissy up at Casitas.

787
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,880
You couldn't do the time, so you got
a big white boy to look after you.

788
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,280
Said they called you "Sugar"...

789
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,080
...because you gave it out so sweet.

790
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:58,280
Louis gave it up at Casitas.
I was the boss jock in my dorm!

791
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,880
Louis was the sissy!

792
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,840
Louis gave it up for candy bars!
He ain't got the sense of a dog!

793
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,680
You like to shoot dogs.

794
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,240
Dogs got no reason to live.

795
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,480
Feel the same way about people?

796
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,320
What're you trying to say?

797
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,080
We got the shotguns.

798
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,680
I don't own no shotguns.

799
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,400
Why were you throwing clothes
in the incinerator?

800
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,360
Say what?

801
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,920
A neighbor said she saw
you throwing clothes in the incinerator.

802
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,440
Doesn't look good.

803
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,960
I ain't talking till I see a judge.

804
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,920
Were you on hop? You were passed out
when we arrested you.

805
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,320
Ty and Louis fuck with that shit,
not me.

806
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,000
Where do they get their stuff?

807
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,160
Man....

808
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,240
Give me one to feed the D.A.
It'll make me look good...

809
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,080
...and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a punk
like his sissy partners.

810
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,280
Tell me one more thing
about Jones and Fontaine.

811
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,640
Where do they get drugs?

812
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,080
Roland Navarette.

813
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,400
He runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.

814
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,440
And he sells red devils.

815
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,760
Exley's good, I'll give him that.

816
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,680
I'll take a break.

817
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,920
You know, Ray,
I'm talking about the gas chamber...

818
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,120
...and you haven't asked me
what this is about.

819
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,360
You got a big "guilty" sign
around your neck.

820
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,360
That was masterful, Edmund.

821
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,520
He's ready to go.

822
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,960
Give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.

823
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,320
Take the cuffs off, so he can read it.

824
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,720
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.

825
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,280
I think it was Ray's idea.
You talk, I think I can save your life.

826
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,480
6 people are dead,
and someone has to pay for it.

827
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,520
Now, it can be you,
or it can be Ray.

828
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,080
Louis, he called you queer.

829
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,560
-At Casitas, you took it up the ass.
-I didn't kill nobody! !

830
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,280
Son...

831
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,880
...you know what'll happen
if you don't talk.

832
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,000
You'll go to the gas chamber.
So admit what you did.

833
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,480
I didn't mean to hurt her.

834
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,640
-Maybe she's okay.
-Okay?

835
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,200
They're all in the morgue.
They were dead when you left them.

836
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:33,040
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don't die, so I don't die.

837
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,320
She don't die, so I don't die.

838
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,120
Louis, who's the girl?
What's her name?

839
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,960
Who are you talking about?

840
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,200
Was she at the Nite Owl?

841
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,120
Listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?

842
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,600
-This paper shit ain't shit!
-Where's the girl?

843
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,160
You kill her?

844
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:01,440
Louis lost his cherry, but things
got out of hand. You made her bleed.

845
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,280
She bled on your clothes,
so you burned the clothes.

846
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,920
Who said that?!

847
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,800
Now, listen to me.

848
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,720
If she's alive,
she's the only chance you've got.

849
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,800
-I think she's alive.
-You think?

850
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,720
Where is she now?

851
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,680
Did you leave her someplace?

852
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,560
Where is she?

853
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,320
What're you doing?!

854
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,600
Don't.

855
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,320
White!

856
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,480
1 in 6!

857
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,560
Where's the girl?!

858
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,400
Put the weapon down!

859
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,000
Where's the girl?! !

860
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,640
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon...

861
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,680
...brown corner house, upstairs.

862
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,680
-Just give me one minute.
-You got it.

863
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,840
Nobody moves.

864
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
We're going in the front.

865
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,000
Stay put until I give the word.

866
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,200
He went around back!

867
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,360
I'm Lieutenant Exley.

868
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,880
I'm sorry to ask you this.
I need to know when they left you.

869
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,280
Get her to the hospital.
Excuse me.

870
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,840
Give your career a rest.

871
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,560
Leave her alone.

872
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,600
A naked guy with a gun?
Who'll believe that?

873
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,360
Get the fuck away from me.

874
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,880
How'll it look in your report?

875
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,560
It'll look like justice.
That's what the man got.

876
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,520
Justice.

877
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,400
You don't know the meaning of the word.

878
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,680
You think it means
getting your picture in the paper.

879
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,760
Go after criminals for a change.

880
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,000
Stensland got what he deserved
and so will you.

881
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,320
It's best to stay away
when his blood is up.

882
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,840
His blood's always up.

883
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,440
Perhaps you should
stay away from him altogether.

884
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,760
Raymond Collins, Ty Jones
and Louis Fontaine.

885
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,440
They are considered armed and dangerous.

886
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,160
Repeat.
The Nite Owl suspects have escaped.

887
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,200
How'd they get out the window?

888
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,160
They jumped from the 2nd floor.

889
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,920
Girl said they left her at 12.
They could get to the Nite Owl by 1.

890
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,680
The question was,
where did they get their drugs?

891
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,920
I haven't gotten that far yet.

892
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,960
"Roland Navarette
lives on Bunker Hill, runs a hole-up--"

893
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,920
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

894
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,560
Is something up?

895
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,600
I need some backup.

896
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,360
-What?
-Nothing. Let's go.

897
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,720
This should be it.

898
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,880
404.

899
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,640
Nobody moves!

900
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,360
You're under arrest.

901
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,880
Don't shoot, man!

902
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,360
Don't move! Don't move!

903
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,360
There he is.

904
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,920
You did good, kid.

905
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,720
You should've seen this place.
Blood everywhere.

906
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,480
Who would have thought?
Shotgun Ed.

907
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,680
Somebody get him cleaned up.

908
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,720
Come on.

909
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:16,360
Edmund J. Exley
has amassed a brilliant record...

910
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,560
...in his 7 years
with the Los Angeles Police Department.

911
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,920
Recently, he evinced spectacular bravery
in the line of duty.

912
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,760
It is our privilege to present him
with our highest honor:

913
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,480
The Medal of Valor.

914
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,000
-What kind of car was it?
-It was a Ford.

915
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,920
My husband always drove a Ford.
I know what they look like.

916
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,200
Excuse me, ma'am.
Just the facts. Light or dark?

917
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,320
Light. And that's really
all I remember, Officer.

918
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,680
Thank you.
You've been a big help.

919
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,760
Cut!
That's a print.

920
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,200
Big Jack!

921
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,680
He's back!

922
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,040
Jack's back.

923
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,600
Tell Mr. Patchett
I have no intention of changing my vote.

924
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,680
It may surprise some that an official
would admit to making a mistake...

925
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,200
...but after due consideration...

926
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,080
...l am changing my position
on the matter before the council.

927
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,040
"Go west, America,"
was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.

928
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,920
Today is that last step westward
with no stop signs...

929
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,960
...no traffic signals, from downtown...

930
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,080
...to the beach in 20 minutes.

931
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,600
What were you going to start with?

932
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,080
Prostitution?

933
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,000
Gambling?

934
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,880
Go back to Jersey, sonny.
This is the City of the Angels...
