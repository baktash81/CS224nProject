1
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,638
(music)

2
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,924
10:53 pm.

3
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,923
Sorry for scaring you like that.
I was just heading home and uh...

4
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:43,483
we met before in the can.
- Oh, you're Wyatt, right?

5
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:47,480
Yeah. So, you working late or
you downloading a multitude of porn?

6
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:51,083
I have to be out of here by tomorrow
so I'm just trying to finish up,

7
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,761
what about you?
- You kidding? This is an early night.

8
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,883
Hard to believe once upon a time...

9
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:59,357
it was a measure of a man's success
on how little he worked.

10
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:03,756
What's the deal? Our firm hires you
to bless our books they send you?

11
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:07,044
I'm the audit manager, yeah. I handle
the same 7 or 8 clients every year.

12
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,085
I must've done Stern
for something like four years now.

13
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:14,080
Wow. So you like this work?
- I do. The order of it appeals to me...

14
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:17,087
the symmetry.

15
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:20,125
It's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with numbers.

16
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,118
Do you like being a lawyer?

17
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:25,597
Yeah, it's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with assholes.

18
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:30,561
I'm probably disturbing you, so...
- Hey, no, it's alright. I'm almost done.

19
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:33,207
Really.
- Oh.

20
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,879
So...

21
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:40,719
Worth and Berman, huh?
Did they headhunt you?

22
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:44,556
Yeah, my senior year of college.
They subsidized my graduate degree.

23
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:47,639
Ah, I see.
So you were... you were poor, right?

24
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:52,804
I guess I was.
I was brought up by my mom on her own

25
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:56,277
and she died when I was 19
and so it was kind of like a lifeline.

26
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,604
Wow. Sounds like you needed it.
- I'm sure there's a lot of people

27
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:02,678
that had it worse.
- Not here.

28
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,839
Practically every suit I know
is Harvard by way of Andover.

29
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:07,758
Are you?
- Oh, hell no. No, no.

30
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:12,284
I'm Princeton by way of Exeter.
- But that's like the same. Oh yeah.

31
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,121
So, Jonathan...

32
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,117
I think I have something here
which might help you to focus.

33
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:24,002
You smoke?
- Not for a long time.

34
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:27,159
Good. This'll give you a real buzz,
then.

35
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:38,082
I don't know...
I just sometimes feel so, uh...

36
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:44,719
you know...
removed.

37
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:49,759
I work for one of the biggest
accounting firms in the world

38
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:52,211
and there's not so much as
a desk there to prove it.

39
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,237
My new senior manager

40
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,761
I haven't even met him in person yet.

41
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:59,237
I try to meet people at work
but it's always the same.

42
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:02,852
To the accounting
staff I'm a pain because

43
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:04,879
for two weeks they
have to hold their breath.

44
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,765
They hope I don't pick up
any of their screw-ups.

45
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,237
To everyone else I'm just a
temporary fixture so why bother.

46
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:17,161
Sometimes...

47
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:21,081
I sit and I look through the glass,
and I see life...

48
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:26,719
literally passing me by.
- Jonathan.

49
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,719
Yeah?

50
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,659
By the clock on that wall there

51
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,002
you have been talking for
thirty-seven minutes straight.

52
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:46,399
I don't remember a word I said.

53
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:53,165
So, God says to Jesus...

54
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:59,197
I haven't felt this good
since I saw Van Halen in '97.

55
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,958
(music)

56
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,958
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

57
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:34,678
(music)

58
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:06,720
Is this the train to Canal Street?
- Yes, this is the right train.

59
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,878
(music)

60
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,558
(music)

61
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,358
(incomprehensible)

62
00:07:56,687 --> 00:08:00,077
So, I guess that's it.
This is my report for Mr. Cross.

63
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:04,158
Could you point me towards
Wyatt Bose's office, please?

64
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:06,283
Who?
- Wyatt Bose. He's one of your...

65
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,245
Hey, quit looking down Daphne's shirt.

66
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:11,397
So, get in, get out, huh?
So where's next?

67
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:14,559
Clancey Funds on Friday
and then Clute-Nichols after that.

68
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:17,525
Sounds like fun.
Wait up a sec.

69
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,966
Good to meet you, Jonathan.
- You, too.

70
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:24,119
So... wait.
You have the day off tomorrow?

71
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,359
How's your backhand?

72
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,198
(music)

73
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:13,080
I'm sorry.
- Good game.

74
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,759
Commiserations, McQuarry.

75
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,522
You develop a killer instinct,
you'll beat the crap out of me.

76
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,250
You know, when these
things first came out,

77
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:22,962
I think I was a frosh
at boarding school.

78
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:25,720
Geez, where did you get this thing?
You steal it from Jimmy Connors?

79
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:26,993
What is it? Natural gut, hm?

80
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:29,197
No, it's a hybrid weave
of natural gut and Kevlar.

81
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:29,798
Kevlar?

82
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,959
Yeah, I should have 'em replaced.
They're pretty frayed.

83
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:39,999
Those two girls were so pretty.

84
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:43,605
You don't get much, do you?

85
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,435
Do you mean sex?
- No, flood insurance.

86
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:49,821
How many women
have you slept with?

87
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:51,722
I don't know.

88
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:53,785
Of course you know.
Everyone knows.

89
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:57,045
Maybe four.
- Maybe four?

90
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:00,361
Alright. Four.
What about you?

91
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:03,837
Me? I have no idea.
- You just said everyone knows.

92
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:08,403
I meant everyone like you.
C'mon, hurry up. Let's go for a drink.

93
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:13,439
You can borrow something of mine.
Ah. Guten Abend, Herr Kleiner.

94
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:16,440
This way, Jonathan.

95
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,164
Like it?

96
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,480
It's a Gerhard Richter.

97
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:31,246
Actually, Kleiner, the
guy we just saw downstairs,

98
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:33,363
he's a hotshot art dealer.

99
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:36,200
He hooked me up with this
fantastic gallery in Munich.

100
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,278
I'll be back in a second.

101
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:04,241
Try this one.

102
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:06,556
What?

103
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,203
C'mon, Jonathan.

104
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:12,283
You remind me of
this guy, Jamie Getz.

105
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:14,280
I met him my freshman
year at Princeton.

106
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,947
Oh, he was real smart.
He was witty, too,

107
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:19,282
when you loosened him up.
But he had this...

108
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,757
brown. Now you assume
that he never scaled that wall.

109
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,683
The truth is he was
the only one that got in.

110
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,159
What happened to him?
- Oh, he killed himself.

111
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:32,396
What?

112
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:37,639
You're kidding.

113
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:42,243
Go get changed.
- Down here?

114
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:45,200
Down there.
Second door on the right.

115
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:49,238
(music)

116
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,277
Okay, Jonathan,
so just the four, huh?

117
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,961
Oh, come on.
Now, look...

118
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:11,484
I've never been
too adventuresome.

119
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:14,719
What's the lamest?
- Well, I once...

120
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,880
No, c'mon, c'mon,
share it with the group.

121
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:19,641
I once phoned one
of those sex lines.

122
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:20,792
Alright, now we're talking.

123
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:22,844
I talked to girl named
Star for like half an hour.

124
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:27,876
I ended up explaining a Section 179
deduction on the new Escalade.

125
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,234
You paid to give tax
advice on a sex line?

126
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:32,682
That's about the size of it.

127
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:37,517
Oh, thank you for sharing, Jonathan.
That is pretty lame.

128
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,565
Oh, hello.

129
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:48,243
Do you... is she looking at me?
- Yeah, she's looking at you.

130
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:51,399
No, she's not. C'mon.
- Maybe it's the suit?

131
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:56,159
Listen, you don't think
women have the same urges?

132
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:59,637
Successful women working their
asses off to stay that way?

133
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:00,762
And?

134
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:04,760
Well, let's just say there's a way
that it can be taken care of.

135
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:08,038
You make it sound
like a mob hit.

136
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:27,240
Had a good time tonight?
- I had a great time tonight.

137
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:31,240
I did. I had a great time.
- Whoa. I wasn't sure at one point.

138
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,522
No, I'm shy. But...

139
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:36,644
Thank you. And thanks for the tennis
and for takin' me out.

140
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:40,640
It's okay. Tennis anytime.
Particularly if you play that badly.

141
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,681
At the corner, please.
The Waldorf Astoria.

142
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,282
I gotta go meet somebody.

143
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,359
Take care. Have a nice night.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

144
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:55,718
(music)

145
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:07,326
Any problems,
you're gonna want to see Julie Levinson.

146
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,398
She's our Assistant Controller.

147
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:13,483
But, like I said,
I don't anticipate any problems.

148
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,284
Never had any before.
- Okay. Thanks.

149
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:29,998
It's really nice out here.
I usually just brown bag it.

150
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:33,027
You have to get outside. Those
fluorescent lights will kill you.

151
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:33,796
I read about them.

152
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,198
(cell phone ringing)

153
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:39,396
Hello.

154
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,799
Shit.
No, I got it here. Hold on.

155
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:50,649
See if you can change it to the
6:30 out of JFK flight number four.

156
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,322
Right. Yeah.

157
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:57,678
Rutherford wants me
to join him in London ASAP.

158
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:00,927
We're papering some finance with Lloyds.
I tell you about this?

159
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:01,077
No.

160
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,523
I'll be gone a couple weeks.
- Sounds sort of interesting.

161
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:07,599
Gonna be as boring as sin, but...
Anyhow, I gotta get back.

162
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:09,166
Ready?
- Alright.

163
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,520
That's disgusting.
I don't want to hear that.

164
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:19,006
Why?

165
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:22,477
That's repulsive.
Don't ever tell anyone that. Ever.

166
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:26,037
You're the kind of girl that pees
in front of men, aren't you?

167
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:29,517
What goes in the Xerox Room
stays in the Xerox room.

168
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:32,759
(cell phone ringing)
Jonathan McQuarry, hello.

169
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:34,606
Hello?

170
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:46,318
Wyatt? It's me, Jonathon.
Look, I've got your cell phone.

171
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,363
I guess, you've got mine.
What a pain in the ass.

172
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,964
You're probably in
the air right, so,

173
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,881
if you get this,
give me a call on your phone.

174
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:56,877
I'll speak to you later.
Take care.

175
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,036
Mr. Lewman. Hi.
- Yes, hello.

176
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:07,399
Actually, Mr. Lewman, there was
something I wanted to talk to you about.

177
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:07,802
Excuse me.

178
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:12,316
Hello?
(woman) Are you free tonight?

179
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:16,002
Look, this isn't actually...
Sorry, could you just hold on a sec?

180
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:19,363
Mr. Lewman, my bedroom...
I think I have a leak.

181
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:23,516
I was hoping you could take a look.
McQuarry. 631.

182
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:27,277
Oh, right. McQuarry.
Yeah, I'll get to it soon as I can.

183
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:30,080
Hello?
Anyone there?

184
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,798
(cell phone ringing)

185
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:48,365
Hello?
(woman) Are you free tonight?

186
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:52,360
Actually, I am, but this isn't Wyatt.
- Sorry, I didn't get that.

187
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,478
Well, I am free, but...
- Could you be at The Dylan in one hour?

188
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,558
I guess so, but...

189
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,158
(music)

190
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,678
(incomprehensible)

191
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,238
(music)

192
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:55,880
Are you waiting for me?
- Yes, I think so.

193
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,845
Would you like a drink or something?
- No, thanks.

194
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:02,317
I've got a conference call
with Tokyo early in the morning.

195
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:05,323
Shall we go?
- Yes.

196
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,518
(music)

197
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:21,279
Have you been in this hotel before?
- No.

198
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:33,001
Look, the person who you thought
you were talking to isn't me.

199
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:37,243
You're not who I spoke to on the phone?
- No, no... Yes, yes, I am.

200
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,645
But...
- What's wrong?

201
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:45,157
Are you not attracted to me?
- Oh, you're beautiful.

202
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,877
It's just you called me
and I came here but I don't...

203
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:53,039
You don't?
- I'm not too sure what's going on.

204
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,758
You're not too sure
what's going on?

205
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,682
Sit down. Sit down.

206
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:18,238
(music)

207
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:15,478
(cell phone ringing)

208
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,437
Hello.
- Hey, you're up early.

209
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:21,917
Hey! How's London?
- Rainy. So you got mine, I got yours.

210
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah, I must've grabbed it at lunch
before you left.

211
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:28,062
No big deal. I already had
my work calls forwarded here.

212
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:28,636
Oh, alright.

213
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,719
So, did I get any calls?
- Yes, you did.

214
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:34,482
And?
- Well...

215
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,204
What the hell was that?
- I knew it. You met up with someone.

216
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:41,802
I thought you would call me back.
- Oh, spare me. I woulda done the same.

217
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:45,197
So how was it?
- It was really amazing, actually. She...

218
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,015
Shit. I'll call you later.
They want me in a meeting.

219
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,405
I want to hear all about
it though, alright?

220
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:52,799
Alright.
- Hey as far as my phone, feel free to use it.

221
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,278
Okay. Thanks.

222
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:00,238
(music)

223
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,646
(woman)
Yes?

224
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:15,720
Hello. Uh...

225
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,798
Yes?
- Are you free tonight?

226
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,925
(woman) Where?
- Where, right.

227
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:27,885
The Dylan Hotel.
- Perhaps The Park Avenue.

228
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,958
In the bar, half past eleven.

229
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,558
(music)

230
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:54,003
(incomprehensible)

231
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:57,363
If you are who you don't seem to be,
you're late.

232
00:21:57,687 --> 00:22:00,281
Excuse me?
- Are you?

233
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:05,319
Late, or who I'm not supposed to be?

234
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,121
Either.

235
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:12,923
Yes, I am late,
and I am who I don't seem to be.

236
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:14,721
Alright, then.

237
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:21,917
Could you put this on the room, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

238
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,601
I don't have a room.

239
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:29,119
You're rather new to this,
aren't you?

240
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:32,684
The initiator is
responsible for the room.

241
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,159
That's one of the rules.

242
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:37,125
Oh. So I should...
- Precisely.

243
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:39,199
Oh. Excuse me.

244
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:46,443
Frankly, I'm surprised whoever
sponsored you didn't explain more.

245
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:49,917
Downstairs, you talked about a rule.
Are there others?

246
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:53,597
No rough stuff. If that's your thing,
take it elsewhere.

247
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:58,036
No business talk, and no names.
- Right.

248
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:03,321
How did you get into this?
- A friend of mine...

249
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:06,683
He introduced you to the list
but failed to explain the basics?

250
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,036
Well, he had to leave town.

251
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:09,964
I'm doing something
wrong here, aren't I?

252
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:13,323
It's not that. You just strike me
as something of a stowaway.

253
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:17,002
If it wasn't for the $4,000 suit,
I'd say you didn't belong here at all.

254
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:18,566
This is us.

255
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,606
Although,
someone obviously thought you did.

256
00:23:23,687 --> 00:23:25,757
And I'm a sucker for bashful boys.

257
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:40,278
Can I ask you something?

258
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:47,317
Why do you do this?
- For the same reason that men do it.

259
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,798
The economics of the arrangement.

260
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:55,636
Intimacy without intricacy.

261
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:00,198
I work past midnight almost every night.

262
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:04,364
The last dinner I had that wasn't
business was about a year ago.

263
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,557
Hey, Wyatt, it's Jonathan.
I haven't heard from you, but...

264
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:24,046
I guess you must be pretty
swamped over there.

265
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,880
Look, I just wanted
to say thank you.

266
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:30,638
(music)

267
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,958
(music)

268
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:16,518
(music)

269
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:15,638
(music)

270
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:27,205
Wait. Wait. Before we...

271
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:32,557
The thing is, I know you.
I mean, not "know you" exactly.

272
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:37,045
We met before in the Times Square
subway station. It had been raining,

273
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:41,517
and you asked me if the
train stops at Canal Street.

274
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:49,596
No.

275
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:54,522
Wait. It just feels a little strange,
that's all.

276
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:58,679
Why?
Because you've seen me before?

277
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,476
Maybe. It's just...
- C'mon, what's the problem?

278
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:06,682
Okay...

279
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:11,483
I guess it is a little bit
of a gear shift.

280
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:21,278
Maybe some other time.

281
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:29,359
Oh, no, please.
What I mean is...

282
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:33,203
By any chance...
are you hungry?

283
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:40,640
Mm, you have a little bit of...
of ketchup on your chin.

284
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:45,600
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm a messy eater.
- No, it's okay. So am I. Here.

285
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,758
There you go.
- Thank you.

286
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:54,722
You have a little piece of...
- Oh, what, onion in my hair?

287
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:04,445
So what do you do for a living?

288
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:08,323
I sit behind glass
and I watch people pass like fish.

289
00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:11,399
You work in a bank?
- I'm sort of an accountant.

290
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:14,679
I bet that's what you always
dreamed of being when you grew up.

291
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,327
Oh, yeah, I'm livin' the dream.
Feel free to leave now.

292
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:20,846
Still here.

293
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:24,606
But how about you?
- No.

294
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:27,963
No, no, no, I'm afraid
that we're still on you.

295
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,524
Frank.
- Frank?

296
00:29:31,727 --> 00:29:34,605
You look like a Frank.

297
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:39,879
By the way, my name is...
- Oh, sh.

298
00:29:40,407 --> 00:29:42,363
You know the rules.
No names.

299
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,439
Yeah, but the rules seem to
specify no conversation either.

300
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:52,081
Okay. How 'bout I tell you my name,
if you guess.

301
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:56,003
Oh, you're in real trouble here.
You see, I am very good at this.

302
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:59,477
What are you very good at?
- Problem solving. It's what I do.

303
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:03,965
I'm very good at identifying hierarchical
relationships and binary posits.

304
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:06,084
Is that right?
- Absolutely.

305
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,965
And this talent can be applied
to finding anything.

306
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:11,686
For example, I know that
your name begins with an S.

307
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:16,997
How do you know that?
- I saw your key chain on your purse.

308
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:20,477
Wow. Excellent work.
- Thank you. So, the things we know are

309
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:24,083
A, your name begins with an S.
B, you have a white coat.

310
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,646
And C...

311
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:29,639
And C, you do not know
your way around the subway.

312
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:31,276
That's true.

313
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:35,360
Now all I do is extrapolate from
these known qualities and your name...

314
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:37,636
is...

315
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:40,801
Sybil.

316
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:45,876
Sophie. You're definitely a Sophie.
- Wait, with an "ie" or a "y"?

317
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:47,605
Either.
- Neither.

318
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:50,925
How about Syd, as in Syd Charisse?
- No, she was Syd with a C.

319
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:54,397
Yeah, but maybe you spell it with an S.
- I do not.

320
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:58,119
Sexy Steffi was lookin' for a train...
- No.

321
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:01,479
Sunbeam.
- Oh, God, do I look like a Sunbeam?

322
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:03,086
Absolutely.

323
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:06,766
Well, then, that's it.

324
00:31:09,207 --> 00:31:12,756
I told you I was good at this.
- I'm very impressed.

325
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,441
I'm crashing.

326
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:26,083
I'd really like to see you again.
Not in a hotel.

327
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:29,840
Hm, well...
we'll see about that.

328
00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:34,682
Maybe tomorrow?
- It is tomorrow.

329
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,478
(music)

330
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,678
(music)

331
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:37,678
(cell phone ringing)

332
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,758
Hello?
(Wyatt) Are you free tonight?

333
00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:43,237
Hey, are you back?
- I wish. It's friggin' anarchy here.

334
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,323
(knocking at the door)
Hang on. Hello?

335
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:48,399
Housekeeping.
- Uh, could you come back? Thanks.

336
00:32:48,487 --> 00:32:50,284
Sorry.
- Where are you?

337
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:53,040
I'm in the Soho Grand.
- Soho Grand, huh?

338
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:55,257
Sounds like you've
been enjoying yourself.

339
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:57,040
I have.
I met this girl last night,

340
00:32:57,127 --> 00:32:58,245
and I broke all the rules

341
00:32:58,246 --> 00:33:00,437
and I had an honest-to-God
conversation with her.

342
00:33:00,527 --> 00:33:03,917
(Wyatt) That's extremely naughty of you.
Who is she, Romeo?

343
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:05,465
I have no idea, really.

344
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:07,796
I don't know very much
about her yet, but...

345
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:09,248
I'm gonna see her again.

346
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:11,516
I don't want to
dampen your spirits...

347
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:14,599
What?
- You met her through the list.

348
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:17,198
She's different.
Trust me.

349
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:20,957
So when are you back?
- Hard to say.

350
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:24,278
It's back-to-back bullshit here.
But next week, I hope.

351
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:27,643
Well, good luck.
I'll see you when you get back.

352
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,406
(Wyatt)
You, too.

353
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:35,918
(music)

354
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:39,921
Hello?
(woman) Are you free tonight?

355
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:41,998
I'm sorry,
you have the wrong number.

356
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:47,118
(music)

357
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:58,159
Hello?
("S") Hey, are you free tonight?

358
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:02,920
Can you meet me in Chinatown,
on Doyer Street? Say, eight o'clock?

359
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:04,236
Okay.

360
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,958
(music)

361
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:35,118
I got you a present.

362
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:39,645
Thank you.
- It looks great on you.

363
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:46,406
Let's go.
- Yeah.

364
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:04,120
We'd like...
we'd like one of these.

365
00:35:05,127 --> 00:35:08,403
And... one of these...
oh, and that.

366
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:10,920
Thank you.

367
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:17,443
What did you order?
- I have absolutely no idea.

368
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:21,841
How do you know we'll like it?
- How do you know we won't?

369
00:35:24,927 --> 00:35:27,805
This is so not my life.

370
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:31,796
Ever since that night on the subway
I haven't stopped thinking about you.

371
00:35:31,887 --> 00:35:33,878
I'm not sure I believe you.

372
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:40,278
I mean, you're in a sex club.
I'm not judging you. I'm in there, too.

373
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:44,280
But don't say you've been
solemnly holding a torch for me for...

374
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:47,644
long now, one month?
- Point taken.

375
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:52,798
I got you a present.

376
00:36:00,807 --> 00:36:03,605
Oh, he is so cute.

377
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,480
Thank you.

378
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,445
Here.
- Thanks.

379
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,239
What is that?

380
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,046
Ginseng gum.

381
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:39,880
It's terrible.

382
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,400
I guess it does sort of
taste like hairspray.

383
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:48,562
I think I got it now.
I think your name is Suki.

384
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:57,198
What?
What are you thinking about?

385
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,881
I don't want to complicate your life.
- No...

386
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:08,357
I want all the
complications you've got.

387
00:37:13,727 --> 00:37:15,638
Maybe you should go?

388
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,039
Maybe you should stay.

389
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:29,398
(music)

390
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:54,918
(music)

391
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,278
I know we decided not to rush, but...

392
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:29,437
Just for the record, I'm doing everything
I can just to apply the brakes here.

393
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:31,320
Oh, me too.

394
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:35,995
Our parents would be proud.

395
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:41,926
But just say...

396
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,086
Say what?

397
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:48,080
If we acted...

398
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:50,418
just suddenly tore
off the rest of these

399
00:38:50,419 --> 00:38:52,285
clothes to consummate their deep...

400
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:56,358
human needs in a frenzy of...

401
00:38:56,647 --> 00:38:58,285
Fucking and sucking.

402
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:02,120
Beautifully put.

403
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:08,598
You were saying?
- Well...

404
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:12,797
Who could blame these two people?
- Who could possibly judge them?

405
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:14,920
Who would know?

406
00:39:21,887 --> 00:39:24,765
I got it.
- Where are you going?

407
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:29,276
Ice.

408
00:39:30,407 --> 00:39:32,398
Oh, you gonna get some ice, huh?

409
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:36,119
There's a machine out in the hallway.
I'll be right back.

410
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:40,357
I'll get the ice.
You stay here, I'll get the ice.

411
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,561
Jonathan. Wait.
- No, I'll go.

412
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,838
Would you like some help?

413
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,686
I can manage. Thank you.

414
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:30,278
I can't get the card to work.

415
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:34,436
Hello?

416
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:37,276
Hello?

417
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:47,198
(music)

418
00:42:11,287 --> 00:42:12,276
Hello!

419
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:18,356
Hello?

420
00:42:19,727 --> 00:42:21,240
Sir. Sir!

421
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:31,118
(speaking Chinese)

422
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,956
Mr. McQuarry, Detective Russo.

423
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:44,439
How're you doing?
- Not too good.

424
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:48,719
This is Detective Burke.
I need a background check.

425
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,275
Last name McQuarry,
first name Jonathan.

426
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:53,801
And you don't know
anything about her?

427
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:57,117
Where she works, where she
lives, her phone number?

428
00:42:57,118 --> 00:42:57,800
Like I said,

429
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:01,524
all I know about her
is her first name starts with an S.

430
00:43:01,607 --> 00:43:03,598
Is she a prostitute?
- No.

431
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:09,319
I told you, she's a friend.
- A friend you met in a sex group.

432
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:16,922
Look, who else is in this sex group?
- I don't know. It's not like that.

433
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:18,486
It's anonymous.

434
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:20,837
You walked into the room
and saw blood?

435
00:43:20,927 --> 00:43:23,128
Yeah, I saw blood and
then someone hit me,

436
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:24,715
and when I came to she was gone.

437
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:27,844
And you didn't see who hit you?
- No, they were behind me.

438
00:43:27,927 --> 00:43:30,999
They must've been hiding in the bathroom.
- Well, was there anything stolen?

439
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:34,477
Your wallet, or jewelry or anything?
- No, I have my wallet.

440
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:37,684
Look, Detective, please,
you've got to find her.

441
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:40,918
We can't do anything until I
understand what happened tonight.

442
00:43:41,007 --> 00:43:42,998
I told you what happened tonight.

443
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:51,399
Have you ever had
experiences like this before?

444
00:43:51,487 --> 00:43:54,638
No. What're you talking about?
- We spoke to the desk clerk,

445
00:43:54,727 --> 00:43:56,718
and he only recalls
seeing you check in.

446
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:00,694
And as for the blood
you say you saw,

447
00:44:00,695 --> 00:44:02,765
we checked the room
and found nothing.

448
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:05,839
In fact, the only blood we found
is where you hit your head.

449
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:12,675
Look, I know it all sounds...

450
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,517
But I swear there's a woman
in serious trouble right now.

451
00:44:17,607 --> 00:44:19,598
A woman whose name
you don't know.

452
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:22,076
Yes.

453
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:29,001
Look, clearly, you had a tough night.
- I'm not crazy.

454
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:33,964
I tell you what. Go home, and if you
remember anything, you give me a call.

455
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:45,398
(music)

456
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:01,398
(music)

457
00:45:20,277 --> 00:45:22,268
(music)

458
00:45:36,077 --> 00:45:38,068
(music)

459
00:45:54,157 --> 00:45:56,227
Hey, Wyatt, it's me, Jonathan.

460
00:45:57,397 --> 00:46:00,355
Look, something happened
to me last night.

461
00:46:00,437 --> 00:46:03,349
Could you call me back
when you get a chance?

462
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:05,428
I really need to speak to you.

463
00:46:07,117 --> 00:46:07,647
Can I help you?

464
00:46:07,648 --> 00:46:10,189
I'm trying to get into contact with
one of your attorneys, Wyatt Bose.

465
00:46:10,277 --> 00:46:13,314
I know he's working out of
your London office right now

466
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:15,295
but I wondered if I can speak
to his assistant or anyone

467
00:46:15,296 --> 00:46:17,151
that would know how to
get in touch with him immediately.

468
00:46:17,237 --> 00:46:18,636
Of course. Just a minute.

469
00:46:19,317 --> 00:46:21,492
Are you sure that you
have the right firm?

470
00:46:21,493 --> 00:46:23,515
Yes, I met him here
when I was working.

471
00:46:23,597 --> 00:46:26,873
Wyatt Bose, he's six-one,
he has black hair. Wait.

472
00:46:27,797 --> 00:46:32,666
I have his... I have his card.
You see? Look. Wyatt Bose.

473
00:46:34,237 --> 00:46:37,354
I can assure you there is no one
by this name working in this firm.

474
00:46:37,437 --> 00:46:38,903
No, but I've seen
him in these halls.

475
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:40,986
For Christ's Sake we smoked
pot in the conference room.

476
00:46:41,077 --> 00:46:42,476
Excuse me?

477
00:46:44,837 --> 00:46:47,829
Wait! Hey, wait
I'm trying to get hold of Wyatt.

478
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:50,351
Who?
- Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him.

479
00:46:50,437 --> 00:46:53,952
You cracked jokes with him in the lobby.
- I crack jokes with a lot of people.

480
00:46:54,037 --> 00:46:57,632
Are you trying to tell me you don't...
- Hey! Easy with the hands. What is this?

481
00:46:57,717 --> 00:47:01,949
He said he was going to London
with a Mr. Rutherford to paper a deal.

482
00:47:02,037 --> 00:47:06,076
Mr. McQuarry, Mr. Rutherford
is presently recovering from hip surgery.

483
00:47:06,437 --> 00:47:08,029
In New Jersey.

484
00:47:18,237 --> 00:47:21,229
Yes?
- I'm sorry. I'm looking for Wyatt.

485
00:47:22,277 --> 00:47:25,633
Excuse me. Wyatt?
- Yeah, Wyatt Bose. He lives here.

486
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:29,107
Uh, in, in this building?
No, I'm sorry, he must be new.

487
00:47:29,357 --> 00:47:32,110
No, not in this building.
In this apartment.

488
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:35,911
No, wait, that painting.
It's a Gerhard Richter, right?

489
00:47:35,912 --> 00:47:36,110
Yes.

490
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:39,429
From the gallery in Munich
that Herr Kleiner handled.

491
00:47:39,517 --> 00:47:41,667
The art dealer downstairs.

492
00:47:41,757 --> 00:47:45,147
Downstairs you must mean Mr. Moretti.
But he's in the carpet business.

493
00:47:48,637 --> 00:47:50,628
Young man, are you alright?

494
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:01,908
(music)

495
00:48:35,157 --> 00:48:37,148
(knocking)

496
00:49:00,157 --> 00:49:02,148
She's a looker.
You weren't kidding.

497
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:07,709
I can see why she had
you all hot and bothered.

498
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:11,673
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was you.
Where is she?

499
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:14,306
God damn it, Wyatt...

500
00:49:17,277 --> 00:49:20,872
I need you to listen. You're starting
next week at Clute-Nichols, yes?

501
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,231
Who are you?

502
00:49:22,317 --> 00:49:24,706
I'm your only shot
at seeing her alive again.

503
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:27,789
I asked you a fucking question.
- Yes.

504
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:30,033
Have a seat.
Sit down.

505
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:34,850
Now, as standard part of their audit

506
00:49:34,851 --> 00:49:38,028
you've temporary access to all
accounts and wire protocols.

507
00:49:38,597 --> 00:49:41,065
That's what this is about?
- Jonathan.

508
00:49:41,157 --> 00:49:43,358
I want you to locate
some accounts for me.

509
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,150
You're gonna move
some money around.

510
00:49:46,197 --> 00:49:48,233
I can't.
- What?

511
00:49:48,317 --> 00:49:51,175
They're client accounts.
There's safety...

512
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:51,707
Listen!

513
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:56,235
I never said client accounts.
I mean some sub-accounts that I know of,

514
00:49:56,317 --> 00:50:00,230
outside the realm of your audit.
Masked accounts. Slush funds.

515
00:50:00,437 --> 00:50:03,315
Typical insider stuff, you know.
twenty mil or so,

516
00:50:03,397 --> 00:50:06,036
skimmed into a quiet account
for a rainy day.

517
00:50:06,117 --> 00:50:08,480
You don't think they'll
notice when it's gone?

518
00:50:08,481 --> 00:50:09,234
Eventually, yes.

519
00:50:09,317 --> 00:50:12,389
But they won't do shit about 'em
'cause it's dirty money.

520
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:15,549
I can't.
- This isn't a negotiation, Jonathan.

521
00:50:16,357 --> 00:50:19,349
Besides, we're friends, remember?

522
00:50:24,477 --> 00:50:29,073
I'm warning you. Don't try and be a hero,
'cause people are gonna get hurt.

523
00:50:29,157 --> 00:50:30,372
And you go to the cops,

524
00:50:30,373 --> 00:50:33,435
I'll make it look like you
cut her pretty little head off.

525
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:38,155
Don't hurt her.
- Just do as you're instructed,

526
00:50:39,117 --> 00:50:42,871
and you'll have her back in no time.
- And why should I trust you?

527
00:50:44,797 --> 00:50:48,187
Everything you told me was a lie.
- Oh, not lies, Jonathan.

528
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:52,227
That was foreplay.
And now you're fucked.

529
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:00,036
I'll be watching.

530
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:10,908
(music)

531
00:51:24,157 --> 00:51:26,148
(cell phone ringing)

532
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:27,506
Hello?

533
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:38,390
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

534
00:51:38,757 --> 00:51:40,827
<i>New message one.</i>

535
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:46,389
Are you free tonight? It's me, Tina.
I'm in town. I want to see you again.

536
00:51:46,757 --> 00:51:50,716
Six months is way too long.
I'm at the Rhiga, room 802.

537
00:51:51,197 --> 00:51:55,315
You better show. You owe me.
After all, I was your first.

538
00:52:01,357 --> 00:52:03,348
(music)

539
00:52:19,557 --> 00:52:22,867
Hello. This is the front desk.
Your guest has arrived.

540
00:52:22,957 --> 00:52:24,515
You can go on up.
- Thank you.

541
00:52:48,437 --> 00:52:52,715
Who are you? What are you doing here?
- I believe I was invited.

542
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:56,948
You have the wrong room.
- You didn't leave me a message,

543
00:52:57,037 --> 00:52:59,028
asking if I was free tonight?

544
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:04,425
I must've dialed the wrong number.

545
00:53:05,717 --> 00:53:08,709
Look, I meant to call someone else.
I'm sorry.

546
00:53:10,877 --> 00:53:12,993
I need to speak
with you about Wyatt.

547
00:53:14,037 --> 00:53:16,187
I just need to ask you
a few questions, okay?

548
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:21,110
I'm sorry, I don't know any Wyatt.
- Bullshit. You left him a message,

549
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,189
asking him to meet you here.
- I thought you said...

550
00:53:24,957 --> 00:53:26,948
Who are you? How did you...

551
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:31,912
What? No!
I just need a few answers.

552
00:53:32,317 --> 00:53:36,515
My name is Jonathan McQuarry.
I know you have no reason to help me,

553
00:53:36,597 --> 00:53:39,634
or even to believe me,
but I need to know about Wyatt.

554
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,878
I told you, I don't know any Wyatt.

555
00:53:41,879 --> 00:53:44,347
That's the name of
the guy you called.

556
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:49,626
No, it isn't.

557
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:56,830
I'm sorry.

558
00:54:01,517 --> 00:54:03,030
I'm really sorry.

559
00:54:09,877 --> 00:54:13,506
I'm really in trouble,
and this guy, he's...

560
00:54:16,277 --> 00:54:17,869
he's dangerous.

561
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:21,957
It was in Chicago about a year ago,

562
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,315
at a private function
sponsored by my firm.

563
00:54:26,557 --> 00:54:29,674
He was attending as a guest.
- A guest of who?

564
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,702
A guy called Hollaway.
Rudolph Holloway.

565
00:54:34,703 --> 00:54:36,635
I think they played
tennis together.

566
00:54:38,037 --> 00:54:41,188
He told me he'd just moved from
San Francisco and was in-between jobs.

567
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:45,795
He was extremely smart.

568
00:54:46,797 --> 00:54:51,313
I know it sounds silly, but he had this
way of making me feel close to him.

569
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,948
I found myself telling him things.

570
00:54:58,437 --> 00:55:00,155
I told him about this.

571
00:55:01,517 --> 00:55:03,314
You told him about the list.

572
00:55:04,757 --> 00:55:05,746
Yeah.

573
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:13,275
There was something about him.
Something terrifying.

574
00:55:17,957 --> 00:55:19,948
So why did you call him again?

575
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:26,949
You know when it's so good
you'd rather die than stop?

576
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,614
You want to kill someone.

577
00:55:30,615 --> 00:55:33,429
You wanna kill the person
you're doing it with.

578
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:47,752
Fuck it. Y'know what?
He was a good lay.

579
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:54,508
Okay, so what's his real name?

580
00:55:57,037 --> 00:55:59,790
Jamie.
- Jamie?

581
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:04,556
That's his name.
Jamie Getz.

582
00:56:06,437 --> 00:56:07,916
Jamie Getz.

583
00:56:11,357 --> 00:56:13,348
(music)

584
00:56:57,197 --> 00:56:59,188
(music)

585
00:57:13,437 --> 00:57:16,241
NYPD Dispatch.
How may I direct your call?

586
00:57:16,242 --> 00:57:17,350
Central Records.

587
00:57:20,877 --> 00:57:21,946
Central.

588
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:27,270
This is Detective Russo,
Precinct 22, badge number 15421.

589
00:57:28,477 --> 00:57:29,956
Go ahead, Detective.

590
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:34,954
I need all you got for a missing person.
Last name Getz... G-E-T-Z.

591
00:57:35,677 --> 00:57:37,668
First name Jamie.

592
00:57:39,637 --> 00:57:41,673
(Officer)
Not gettin' anything.

593
00:57:44,157 --> 00:57:47,269
Wait. Got a hit on the
San Francisco database.

594
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:48,196
You near a fax?

595
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:50,716
Yeah, uh...

596
00:57:52,277 --> 00:57:56,555
Yes, send it to 212-555-0110.

597
00:57:57,077 --> 00:57:59,193
Uh, Russo?
- That's right.

598
00:57:59,757 --> 00:58:01,907
Send you all we got.
- Thanks.

599
00:58:04,717 --> 00:58:07,106
<i>You have two unheard messages.</i>

600
00:58:07,197 --> 00:58:10,394
It's Petersen.
I heard you called in sick today.

601
00:58:10,477 --> 00:58:13,139
Just making sure you'll
wrap up Clancey tomorrow.

602
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,629
Call me if you need anything.

603
00:58:15,877 --> 00:58:20,075
Hi, this is Mr. Lewman, the Super.
I haven't forgotten about your pipe leak.

604
00:58:20,557 --> 00:58:24,345
I'll have a look at it Wednesday evening.
I assume you'll still be at work,

605
00:58:24,437 --> 00:58:26,587
so I'll let myself in. Thanks.

606
00:58:26,997 --> 00:58:28,715
<i>End of messages.</i>

607
00:58:29,597 --> 00:58:31,588
(phone ringing)

608
00:58:34,877 --> 00:58:35,866
Hello?

609
00:58:37,717 --> 00:58:38,706
Hello?

610
00:58:39,437 --> 00:58:42,713
(Wyatt) I'm just making sure you can
start Clute-Nichols on Wednesday.

611
00:58:42,797 --> 00:58:46,028
I want her back.
- Two more days, and she's all yours.

612
00:58:46,117 --> 00:58:48,108
No, not two days,
I want her back now.

613
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:52,107
What?
- Yeah, 'cause I know all about you.

614
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:55,388
I know who you are,
Jamie Getz.

615
00:58:56,437 --> 00:58:59,349
I know all about
your best friend Rudolph Holloway,

616
00:58:59,437 --> 00:59:00,692
and where you come from

617
00:59:00,693 --> 00:59:03,476
and your days as a two-bit
hustler in San Francisco

618
00:59:03,557 --> 00:59:06,867
and three years at Avenal
for insurance fraud, arson.

619
00:59:09,117 --> 00:59:10,232
How did you uh...

620
00:59:10,317 --> 00:59:12,433
Doesn't matter.
What matters is what I know.

621
00:59:13,957 --> 00:59:16,790
Now I want her back,
unharmed...

622
00:59:17,837 --> 00:59:21,113
or else I tell your pathetic story
to the cops. Do you understand?

623
00:59:22,197 --> 00:59:24,153
Well-played, Jonathan.

624
00:59:31,677 --> 00:59:33,668
(music)

625
00:59:53,917 --> 00:59:55,908
(music)

626
01:00:10,317 --> 01:00:15,232
Mr. McQuarry, you have a phone call
from a Detective Russo. Line four.

627
01:00:18,837 --> 01:00:22,193
The body came in a little while ago.
She was found in a taxi.

628
01:00:22,757 --> 01:00:24,331
The driver was in a coffee shop,

629
01:00:24,332 --> 01:00:26,545
came back and there she
was in the back seat.

630
01:00:27,437 --> 01:00:31,225
And she fits the description you gave us
of that missing woman of yours.

631
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:36,314
And what's her name?
- Simone Wilkenson.

632
01:00:38,877 --> 01:00:40,390
Let's go this way.

633
01:00:47,037 --> 01:00:49,028
You want to step in,
Mr. McQuarry, please?

634
01:00:57,717 --> 01:00:58,706
Okay.

635
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:13,429
Is this the woman you were with
the other night, Mr. McQuarry?

636
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:21,954
Mr. McQuarry?
- Yeah.

637
01:01:23,117 --> 01:01:25,312
Have you seen this woman before?

638
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:28,508
No, I've never seen her before.

639
01:01:30,597 --> 01:01:33,669
Who is she?
- She's a Wall Street analyst.

640
01:01:34,877 --> 01:01:38,995
And... and what happened to her?
- She was strangled with something.

641
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:42,072
Coulda been wire, even a string.

642
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:46,269
Lab reports show traces of Kevlar
in the wound.

643
01:01:46,557 --> 01:01:49,469
It's natural gut and Kevlar.
- Kevlar?

644
01:01:50,397 --> 01:01:53,673
Kevlar?
- That should narrow it down for us.

645
01:01:57,117 --> 01:01:59,108
You want to tell me anything else?

646
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:02,186
No.

647
01:02:06,517 --> 01:02:08,508
(music)

648
01:02:36,677 --> 01:02:38,668
(music)

649
01:03:13,117 --> 01:03:15,108
(music)

650
01:03:27,197 --> 01:03:30,234
Morning, Einstein.
Ready for your big day?

651
01:03:31,957 --> 01:03:33,948
You know fuckin' shit.

652
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:37,749
You think because you know
my name you know me.

653
01:03:39,277 --> 01:03:41,268
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

654
01:03:42,517 --> 01:03:46,112
Yes, I do. You murdered Simone,
and you constantly try to set me up.

655
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:50,832
Not if you behave.
But if you screw with me today

656
01:03:50,957 --> 01:03:55,189
what I did to her is kindness compared to
what I'll do to your little girlfriend.

657
01:03:56,717 --> 01:03:59,709
Why, you won't even recognize her
when I'm through.

658
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:02,295
But her fate's in your hands.

659
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:05,630
If you don't go through
with it, I'll kill her.

660
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:09,555
Yeah.
But if I do, you'll kill me.

661
01:04:10,477 --> 01:04:12,229
Yeah.
It's a bit tricky.

662
01:04:13,397 --> 01:04:14,471
But what do you care?

663
01:04:14,472 --> 01:04:17,436
You were dead long before I
met you, you just didn't know.

664
01:04:20,477 --> 01:04:22,468
You got no killer instinct,
Jonathan.

665
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,268
I'll give the instructions
to you later.

666
01:04:27,557 --> 01:04:30,429
You've got until 6 p.m.
to execute them,

667
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:31,550
or I execute her.

668
01:04:36,597 --> 01:04:40,067
Now, remember, be nice to
everybody on your first day at work.

669
01:04:41,197 --> 01:04:43,870
First impressions are everything,
don't you agree?

670
01:04:56,237 --> 01:04:58,228
(music)

671
01:05:07,997 --> 01:05:10,875
Mr. McQuarry. Follow me, please.
- Hello.

672
01:05:12,797 --> 01:05:15,789
(controller)
All of our C7 logs are on the system.

673
01:05:19,637 --> 01:05:21,628
(incomprehensible)

674
01:05:27,037 --> 01:05:29,028
(music)

675
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:05,635
I just saw this in my in-box.
It's for you.

676
01:06:05,717 --> 01:06:08,550
I guess it came in a little
while ago by messenger.

677
01:06:10,117 --> 01:06:11,391
Thank you.

678
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:20,908
(Wyatt) Pay attention, Jonathan.
This is what you're gonna do.

679
01:06:20,997 --> 01:06:24,387
Look for a group of sub-accounts
in the Liebling-Holloway Trust.

680
01:06:24,477 --> 01:06:27,230
These are masked accounts.
48 separate line items

681
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,309
with IBAN numbers ending with 6700.

682
01:06:30,757 --> 01:06:32,827
You bundle these phantom accounts

683
01:06:32,917 --> 01:06:36,671
and set up a standard wire transfer
to the Banco Nationale, Madrid.

684
01:06:36,757 --> 01:06:39,476
An account's already been
set up in your name.

685
01:06:42,797 --> 01:06:44,680
Clute-Nichols is
very particular about

686
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,756
who accesses their
private holding accounts.

687
01:06:47,277 --> 01:06:49,133
But you have a
level four clearance,

688
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:51,190
and that's why you're
my friend, remember?

689
01:06:55,157 --> 01:06:59,389
At exactly 5 o'clock, you're gonna log in
and begin a global fund exchange.

690
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:03,593
Once you're inside, you're gonna
access the Liebling-Holloway Trust

691
01:07:03,677 --> 01:07:05,668
through Rudolph Holloway's
private account.

692
01:07:06,717 --> 01:07:09,914
You'll only have 40 minutes
to locate the private trust accounts

693
01:07:09,997 --> 01:07:13,273
and manually consolidate all balances
into a single fund wire.

694
01:07:14,157 --> 01:07:17,593
Once you're done, you'll encode
this fund wire for an end-of-day transfer

695
01:07:17,677 --> 01:07:19,668
to the Clute-Nichols office in Hong Kong.

696
01:07:24,797 --> 01:07:27,106
The Asian market
opens 15 hours ahead of us.

697
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:30,553
Thus, this transfer will be catalogued
as Friday's business

698
01:07:30,637 --> 01:07:34,596
and won't flag on the Clute transfer log
until end of business Monday.

699
01:07:34,677 --> 01:07:36,827
That's four days after
we're done, Jonathan.

700
01:07:38,557 --> 01:07:41,629
That's plenty of time for me
to fill out a withdrawal slip in Spain.

701
01:07:47,837 --> 01:07:49,236
Hello, sir.

702
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:54,668
(music)

703
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:03,716
Hey, Russo. Simone Wilkenson spent
the night at the Dylan two weeks ago.

704
01:08:04,237 --> 01:08:07,627
The guy you like, McQuarry,
paid for the mini-bar in the room.

705
01:08:07,997 --> 01:08:09,988
Let's go pick him up.

706
01:08:12,717 --> 01:08:14,708
(music)

707
01:08:44,277 --> 01:08:46,268
(music)

708
01:09:06,397 --> 01:09:08,547
It's not coming out
of our pockets, is it?

709
01:09:09,837 --> 01:09:10,872
What?

710
01:09:10,957 --> 01:09:13,949
That delivery. You didn't bill it to us.
- No, of course not.

711
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:17,787
Good.
You guys charge enough as it is.

712
01:09:22,837 --> 01:09:25,510
Is everything okay?
- Okay?

713
01:09:26,757 --> 01:09:29,954
With the audit.
- Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

714
01:09:30,997 --> 01:09:33,352
I... it seems to be going very well.

715
01:09:39,797 --> 01:09:40,786
Good.

716
01:10:00,077 --> 01:10:02,307
It's not exactly a spectator sport.

717
01:10:07,157 --> 01:10:10,069
Yeah, well,
I was gonna order in dinner anyway.

718
01:10:11,717 --> 01:10:13,867
You want something?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

719
01:10:45,677 --> 01:10:47,668
(music)

720
01:11:05,837 --> 01:11:07,828
(cell phone ringing)

721
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:23,068
(music)

722
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:28,906
Taxi!

723
01:11:37,397 --> 01:11:39,388
(music)

724
01:11:57,997 --> 01:11:59,988
(music)

725
01:12:11,997 --> 01:12:13,350
Come on.

726
01:12:46,557 --> 01:12:48,548
(scream)

727
01:13:16,437 --> 01:13:18,428
(incomprehensible)

728
01:13:52,117 --> 01:13:54,108
(music)

729
01:14:19,957 --> 01:14:21,948
(music)

730
01:14:40,357 --> 01:14:42,791
What happened?
- Probably a gas leak.

731
01:14:43,917 --> 01:14:47,546
Which apartment?
- 631. Jonathan McQuarry.

732
01:14:49,677 --> 01:14:52,669
Is there a body?
- Coroner's already taken it away.

733
01:15:07,517 --> 01:15:09,508
(music)

734
01:15:14,437 --> 01:15:17,474
(pilot) We should be arriving
in Madrid by 6 a.m.

735
01:15:19,997 --> 01:15:22,465
Excuse me, are you finished with that?

736
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:25,587
Please, go ahead.
- Thanks.

737
01:15:28,317 --> 01:15:30,990
You on business?
- Yes, I am.

738
01:15:31,077 --> 01:15:33,989
What do you do?
- I'm an accountant.

739
01:15:34,077 --> 01:15:36,432
Do you like it?
- I love it.

740
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:39,432
Numbers know how to behave, right?
- Sure.

741
01:15:39,877 --> 01:15:42,869
Order and symmetry.
What else could a man need?

742
01:15:43,437 --> 01:15:45,393
Jim Winter.
Deutsche Bank.

743
01:15:45,477 --> 01:15:48,009
Jonathan McQuarry, Worth and Berman.
Nice to meet you.

744
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:48,469
Likewise.

745
01:15:57,557 --> 01:15:59,548
(music)

746
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:37,876
What do you think?

747
01:16:44,557 --> 01:16:46,997
You certainly look the part, Wyatt.

748
01:16:46,998 --> 01:16:47,833
Whoa, Wyatt?

749
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:51,229
Who's Wyatt? My name is...
- Hey. Don't.

750
01:16:51,957 --> 01:16:53,948
Yeah, the rules.
No names, huh?

751
01:16:54,797 --> 01:16:57,391
That's a nice suit.
- When did you get in?

752
01:16:57,477 --> 01:16:59,468
Couple of days ago.
- Two days, huh?

753
01:17:00,677 --> 01:17:04,511
Been enjoying Madrid?
- Been jet-lagged.

754
01:17:05,197 --> 01:17:07,387
We need champagne.
You want to order some?

755
01:17:07,388 --> 01:17:08,507
No, I'm fine with this.

756
01:17:08,597 --> 01:17:11,987
Then give me a beer.
Holy shit, look at this.

757
01:17:12,997 --> 01:17:16,956
Wow. I spoke to Mr. Ruiz
at Banco Nacional de San Sebastian.

758
01:17:17,917 --> 01:17:19,551
He's ready for us whenever we want.

759
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,466
You're about to be a
millionairess, baby.

760
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,228
How about that?
Little ol' you, huh?

761
01:17:24,837 --> 01:17:27,138
From the corner of the
street and here you are,

762
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:28,432
to the biggest double suite.

763
01:17:30,637 --> 01:17:32,548
Who's always looking out for you?

764
01:17:33,517 --> 01:17:37,032
Oh, yeah. Suits and ties,
I told you, they're the big game.

765
01:17:38,757 --> 01:17:42,432
Hey. I'm paying you a million bucks
for services rendered.

766
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:46,835
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Nothing. Christ, I'm jet-lagged.

767
01:17:47,717 --> 01:17:48,910
I do so hate to be crass,

768
01:17:48,911 --> 01:17:51,153
but you don't have "No,
thank you" rights here.

769
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:53,788
You don't have
to tell me that twice.

770
01:17:57,037 --> 01:18:00,234
So, how did it go?
Everything okay?

771
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:03,106
Perfect.
You did a great job on him.

772
01:18:04,317 --> 01:18:07,309
Yeah, that poor bastard
was practically in love with you.

773
01:18:10,877 --> 01:18:13,710
He said that?
- He didn't need to say it.

774
01:18:17,397 --> 01:18:20,434
So, he just transferred the money,
no questions?

775
01:18:20,517 --> 01:18:21,975
Sure, he had questions.

776
01:18:21,976 --> 01:18:24,829
He said he would only
do it if you were safe.

777
01:18:26,757 --> 01:18:28,270
What about him?

778
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:33,307
Is he safe?
- Well, he had a little accident.

779
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,628
What?
- The old routine.

780
01:19:00,957 --> 01:19:03,027
You killed him?
- It was an accident.

781
01:19:03,117 --> 01:19:04,994
You fucking killed him?

782
01:19:07,237 --> 01:19:09,307
You fucking piece of shit.

783
01:19:09,477 --> 01:19:11,752
You fucking lousy... lousy...

784
01:19:12,677 --> 01:19:16,909
He knew my name.
Jesus Christ, why do you care?

785
01:19:17,637 --> 01:19:19,772
How long do you think he
would've waited for you to show

786
01:19:19,773 --> 01:19:20,709
before he called the cops?

787
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:23,027
One hour? Three?
I had no choice.

788
01:19:24,037 --> 01:19:26,028
Alright?
He would've found me.

789
01:19:40,037 --> 01:19:41,516
Jesus Christ.

790
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,228
You were into the accountant.

791
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:48,396
You for real?

792
01:19:55,037 --> 01:19:56,516
That was stupid.

793
01:20:00,397 --> 01:20:01,386
Fuck.

794
01:20:09,397 --> 01:20:10,876
I'm sorry.

795
01:20:13,277 --> 01:20:14,756
I'm sorry.

796
01:20:17,037 --> 01:20:19,551
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

797
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,906
It just caught me by surprise.

798
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:31,949
You'll feel fine later
with all that cash. Trust me.

799
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:36,868
Buy you a nice
leather bag to put it in.

800
01:20:39,957 --> 01:20:44,189
We'll take the night train to Paris.
Have some fois gras at Le Bouclard...

801
01:20:47,397 --> 01:20:50,514
then mosey on down to Nice.
Work on our tans.

802
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:55,910
Buy a yacht.
We can name it Jonathan.

803
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:04,272
(singing) My baby loves me,
she always makes me feel fine.

804
01:21:04,517 --> 01:21:08,066
She loves me,
she lets me know that she's mine.

805
01:21:08,237 --> 01:21:09,875
And when she kisses...

806
01:21:10,517 --> 01:21:14,146
And then I ask her
if everything is okay,

807
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:18,066
I get my answer,
the only thing I can say,

808
01:21:18,397 --> 01:21:20,752
I say "Yeah, yeah."
Your turn.

809
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:29,306
Say it!
- Yeah, yeah...

810
01:21:30,837 --> 01:21:32,350
is what I say.

811
01:21:33,557 --> 01:21:35,548
Oh, what I'm gonna do to you.

812
01:21:57,157 --> 01:21:59,148
(music)

813
01:22:12,477 --> 01:22:14,468
(music)

814
01:22:40,317 --> 01:22:42,739
I have an appointment
with Mr. Ruiz. Ruiz?

815
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:43,753
Ruiz, that's right.

816
01:22:43,837 --> 01:22:47,307
Ruiz. I'm Jonathan McQuarry.
- I was told to expect you. One moment.

817
01:22:52,437 --> 01:22:53,426
McQuarry.

818
01:22:54,357 --> 01:22:56,141
Okay, this way.
Excuse me.

819
01:22:56,142 --> 01:22:58,953
The young lady,
she's also on the account?

820
01:22:59,197 --> 01:23:02,906
No. She's my personal secretary.
- I see.

821
01:23:03,797 --> 01:23:07,187
Well, only those on the account
are permitted in Mr. Ruiz' offices.

822
01:23:07,277 --> 01:23:08,835
I do apologize.

823
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:11,909
Would you mind if I waited here?
- Wait here if you like.

824
01:23:15,117 --> 01:23:16,596
This way, please.

825
01:23:27,037 --> 01:23:30,552
Mr. Lopez-Poline, our Bank Manager.
He will take care of you now.

826
01:23:30,637 --> 01:23:33,197
Mr. McQuarry. Buenas dias.
- Buenas dias.

827
01:23:34,197 --> 01:23:37,030
I understand you wish to close
your account with us today.

828
01:23:37,117 --> 01:23:39,790
I'm afraid so.
I require some extra liquidity.

829
01:23:39,877 --> 01:23:41,746
Of course.
I need to see your passport

830
01:23:41,747 --> 01:23:43,711
and you will need to
sign a few documents.

831
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:45,956
Here you are.

832
01:24:00,197 --> 01:24:01,949
Gracias.
- Gracias.

833
01:24:02,397 --> 01:24:06,151
And tell me, will the co-signer
be joining us shortly?

834
01:24:07,277 --> 01:24:09,837
Excuse me?
- The co-signer on this account.

835
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:13,114
We will need his information as well
before we can release the funds.

836
01:24:15,637 --> 01:24:17,867
The co-signer.
- Yes, sir.

837
01:24:17,957 --> 01:24:21,711
When this money was transferred
there was a request for a co-signature

838
01:24:21,797 --> 01:24:24,595
to release the funds.
I have it right here.

839
01:24:27,517 --> 01:24:31,669
A Mr. Bose, Wyatt Bose,
is listed on the account as well.

840
01:24:32,597 --> 01:24:35,714
Wyatt Bose.
- Yes, Mr. McQuarry.

841
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:39,193
According to our records

842
01:24:39,277 --> 01:24:42,587
you yourself requested the co-signature
when you transferred these funds.

843
01:24:43,237 --> 01:24:46,832
Yes, I know I did, but it's just...

844
01:24:50,237 --> 01:24:53,752
It's not a problem.
I can sort this out.

845
01:24:56,797 --> 01:25:00,267
Please tell Mr. Ruiz
I'll be back shortly.

846
01:25:01,477 --> 01:25:03,149
(bank manager)
Okay.

847
01:25:06,637 --> 01:25:08,628
(music)

848
01:25:34,917 --> 01:25:36,908
Hello.
- (Jonathan) Are you free tonight?

849
01:25:38,677 --> 01:25:41,475
Jonathan.
- I said, are you free tonight?

850
01:25:43,637 --> 01:25:45,116
Yes, I am.

851
01:25:56,517 --> 01:25:57,996
Hello, Jonathan.

852
01:26:05,317 --> 01:26:07,387
My God,
I'm a handsome devil.

853
01:26:08,797 --> 01:26:12,233
The hair isn't quite right.
You losing some on top, there?

854
01:26:12,797 --> 01:26:15,789
Regardless, you look well.
- For someone you thought you'd killed.

855
01:26:17,957 --> 01:26:19,595
I want half.

856
01:26:21,197 --> 01:26:24,394
Careful. The suit doesn't make
the man, Jonathan.

857
01:26:24,717 --> 01:26:27,789
I stole 20 million dollars.
I figure I'm entitled to some of it.

858
01:26:29,877 --> 01:26:32,869
There are two signatures required
to release those funds.

859
01:26:35,317 --> 01:26:37,308
You thought of everything,
didn't you?

860
01:26:38,157 --> 01:26:41,991
Without me that money doesn't
move anywhere. I want half.

861
01:26:47,157 --> 01:26:48,636
Okay.
Let's do it.

862
01:26:57,277 --> 01:26:59,154
Señor Bose.
- Thank you.

863
01:26:59,237 --> 01:27:00,670
Señor McQuarry.

864
01:27:08,237 --> 01:27:10,228
Would you sign there,
Mr. McQuarry, please?

865
01:27:16,637 --> 01:27:19,947
Two suitcases,
ten million each.

866
01:27:21,397 --> 01:27:24,309
Well, everything
seems to be in order.

867
01:27:24,917 --> 01:27:27,385
Mr. McQuarry, Mr. Bose...

868
01:27:28,837 --> 01:27:30,953
please sign here and here.

869
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:35,989
Thank you.
Please follow me.

870
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:44,390
All yours.

871
01:27:50,917 --> 01:27:52,908
(music)

872
01:28:03,037 --> 01:28:06,916
Well, here we are, Jonathan.
Spain, a suitcase full of money.

873
01:28:08,317 --> 01:28:11,309
A lot of people would give everything
to feel what we're feeling right now.

874
01:28:11,877 --> 01:28:15,028
I'm curious.
How did you know you'd been played?

875
01:28:16,277 --> 01:28:18,666
You made a mistake.
- I made a mistake?

876
01:28:19,317 --> 01:28:22,309
The photo you sent me
was taken a few weeks ago.

877
01:28:23,037 --> 01:28:25,028
Before the pipe behind her
caused the stain.

878
01:28:29,197 --> 01:28:33,349
I knew she was in on it.
- No longer. She took off.

879
01:28:35,757 --> 01:28:37,236
Where is she?

880
01:28:38,037 --> 01:28:40,312
She really got under your skin,
didn't she?

881
01:28:43,157 --> 01:28:46,149
I'll give you half my share
if you tell me where she is.

882
01:28:46,317 --> 01:28:47,796
Is that so?

883
01:28:51,437 --> 01:28:53,632
Let's go somewhere
quiet and make a deal.

884
01:28:57,997 --> 01:29:00,795
She fell for you, Jonathan.
It's true.

885
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:05,228
I think she may
have even loved you.

886
01:29:08,797 --> 01:29:12,267
She's a very special girl, and I think
she's worth more than half your share,

887
01:29:12,357 --> 01:29:14,188
but then again...

888
01:29:46,517 --> 01:29:48,872
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

889
01:29:54,877 --> 01:29:56,868
(music)

890
01:30:40,237 --> 01:30:42,228
(music)

891
01:30:59,437 --> 01:31:02,509
Wait! Wait! I need to talk to you.
- No. Get out of here, Jonathan.

892
01:31:02,597 --> 01:31:04,591
I came here hoping I
would see you again.

893
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:05,873
You know nothing about me.

894
01:31:05,957 --> 01:31:07,948
You don't even know my name.

895
01:31:08,837 --> 01:31:11,829
So I was just part of the plan,
is that it? Everything.

896
01:31:12,917 --> 01:31:16,273
I wanted to call it off.
That night in Chinatown.

897
01:31:16,997 --> 01:31:19,656
I didn't know he was gonna
try to kill you. I'm so sorry.

898
01:31:19,657 --> 01:31:20,114
Don't go.

899
01:31:25,437 --> 01:31:27,189
Take care of yourself.

900
01:31:39,637 --> 01:31:41,628
(music)

901
01:31:51,117 --> 01:31:53,108
(music)

902
01:32:18,957 --> 01:32:20,948
(music)

903
01:32:36,037 --> 01:32:38,028
(music)

904
01:32:50,557 --> 01:32:53,788
Norbert Lewman... the Super.

905
01:33:06,957 --> 01:33:08,948
(music)

906
01:33:30,837 --> 01:33:32,828
(music)

907
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:57,788
(music)

908
01:34:17,357 --> 01:34:19,348
(music)
