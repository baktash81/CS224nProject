Don't worry, Aunt Cora.

177
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,009
I bet the summer will go by
faster than you think.

178
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,177
Very funny.

179
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,763
Is that him?

180
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,390
[belches]

181
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,643
No. I don't see him anywhere.

182
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,353
Are we in the right place?

183
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,856
Yes, unfortunately.

184
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,650
I'll go check if he's in his office.

185
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,152
Don't move until I get back.

186
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,737
- Oof!
- [yawns] Oh, man.

187
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,113
- I'm hungry.
- Where's the saloon?

188
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,449
Yeah! I could go for a steak!

189
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,619
- Stay out of trouble now, princess.
- Hey, this ain't the coast.

190
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,329
Change of plans, boys.

191
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,873
Now, listen up. We ran out of money.

192
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,127
I saw some horses from the train that'll
buy us our next ticket out of here.

193
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,838
Hey, you know where they got money? Banks.

194
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,840
You remember how well
that worked out last time?

195
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:34,676
- What'd I miss?
- Now get going. You'll earn that bacon.

196
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,720
All right. Let's get to that saloon.

197
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,558
[man]
Today's events are brought to you by…

198
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,770
- [cheering]
- [horse whinnies]

199
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,397
[laughs]

200
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:48,941
[grunts]

201
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,779
[man]
Ladies and gentlemen, mares and stallions…

202
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,031
Hey, come back!
Give me the ice cream back!

203
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,534
- Let's give a round of applause…
- [boy] I thought we were partners.

204
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,285
…to Valentina

205
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,914
{\an8}and <i>Las Caballeras</i>

206
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,959
<i>de Miradero!</i>

207
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:07,960
Wow.

208
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:12,005
[man] Brought to you
by Prescott Railways and Granger's Corral.

209
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,634
Stables so fine,
you'll wanna sleep there yourself.

210
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,761
[Lucky] Whoa.

211
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,888
- Fortuna?
- What?

212
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,974
<i>Bienvenida,</i> Fortuna.

213
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,642
Uh...

214
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,686
<i>Hola. ¿Cómo estás?</i>

215
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,690
We've been expecting you.
You look just like your mother.

216
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,358
- [Lucky] I do?
- [speaking Spanish]

217
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,734
<i>Bienvenida,</i> Fortuna.

218
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:33,986
Wait, you knew her?

219
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,446
Ah, <i>sí!</i> Everyone knew Milagro.

220
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,699
Here. You should have this.

221
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,034
Your mother had one just like it.

222
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,622
- Welcome home, <i>mi hija!</i> Yeehaw!
- Wait!

223
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,542
- [man] Next up, our Western Reining champ…
- [girl] Excuse me. Coming through.

224
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,004
…and the champion of her old dad's heart,

225
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,548
my daughter Pru Granger

226
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,635
and the incomparable Chica Linda!

227
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,429
Pru!

228
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,850
[Granger] She's been making my head spin
for 13 years, so I'm used to it.

229
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,768
Whoa! Horses can do that?

230
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,687
[Granger laughs]

231
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,064
Whoa!

232
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,276
[Granger] All right, you show-off.
Don't you have chores to do?

233
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,863
Fortuna Esperanza Navarro Prescott,
you get back here!

234
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,657
- Aunt Cora! You have to see this.
- [Granger] And here's our next contender.

235
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,452
- The smell. Oh!
- [Granger] Feast your eyes on this filly.

236
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,828
That can't taste good.

237
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,914
- [cows bellowing]
- [Cora groaning, grunting]

238
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,916
[Granger]
Now, those are some smooth moves.

239
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,084
- [yelps]
- [bellows]

240
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,170
- [groans]
- [Granger] And what a finale!

241
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,216
- Oh.
- May I offer you a hand there, ma'am?

242
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,759
Well, I never.

243
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,052
I'm so sorry to hear that.

244
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,471
[Granger] Today's events are brought
to you by Al Granger's Corral.

245
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,680
Unbelievable.

246
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,433
Stranding us at the station
like common vagabonds.

247
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,228
Did you see those amazing women
riding those horses?

248
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,604
One gave me this sash.

249
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,274
I need a strong cup of tea
and to burn this dress.

250
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,777
Aunt Cora,
did you ever see my mom perform?

251
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,989
Oh, yes. I'll never forget it.
She was amazing.

252
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,701
She did this incredible backflip
off her horse. [laughs]

253
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,287
I believe my stomach did a backflip too.

254
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,872
- [man] Watch yourself, lady!
- Wait!

255
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:09,998
Sir?

256
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,752
A ride?

257
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,003
[boy] Need a ride?

258
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,213
Snips is the name.

259
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,551
And this noble steed is Senor Carrots,
my business partner.

260
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,635
Where to, ma'ams?

261
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,053
Thank you, no.

262
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,139
But if you could point us
in the direction of the Prescott house...

263
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,433
I'll get you there in a jiffy
for just a penny.

264
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,270
- No. No!
- All aboard! Toot-toot!

265
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,564
Next stop, Prescott house.

266
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,607
- [brays]
- [grunting]

267
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,485
Okay.

268
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,281
Here we are! In a jiffy. As advertised.

269
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,241
Your destination, just ahead.

270
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,243
That will be one penny.

271
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,078
- Okay.
- [girl] Snips!

272
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,038
- [man] Watch where you're going!
- You little thief!

273
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,500
You saw nothing. Enjoy your stay!
Like the wind!

274
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,544
You better stop harassing
those nice people.

275
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,964
[Snips grunts]

276
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,300
Oh, no! Hey, stop!

277
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,760
Oh, my gosh. You must be Lucky Prescott.

278
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,638
I like your hair and your dress.
And your shoes!

279
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,725
I didn't know shoes could be cute.
Can I try them on?

280
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,312
- Sorry about my brother.
- I'm the one you oughta apologize to.

281
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,522
Hey, stop, not the hair!

282
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:20,319
Here. I'm Abigail,
and this is my best friend Boomerang.

283
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,737
Say hello, Boom.

284
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,697
[in deep voice]
"It's a pleasure to meet you, madame."

285
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,657
[in deep voice] It's nice to meet you too.

286
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:29,286
- [Granger] …Miss Abigail Stone.
- Uh-oh. I'm up. See you later.

287
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,164
Abigail, you can't leave me here.

288
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,000
Watch me.

289
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,418
Good luck out there!

290
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:41,173
[sighs]
I think that donkey ate part of my dress.

291
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:45,177
She was my age,
and she was on this beautiful horse.

292
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,763
And did you know
that horses could walk backwards?

293
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,473
- It's, like, crazy.
- [sighs]

294
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,225
At last.

295
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,685
- Civilization.
- [sighs]

296
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:57,773
Jim?

297
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,610
Jim Prescott?

298
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,113
Huh.

299
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,244
James Prescott Junior?

300
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,662
[grunts]

301
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,372
Jim!

302
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:15,958
Whoops.

303
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,751
Cora?

304
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,003
[gasps] Oh!

305
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,088
Jim!

306
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,007
Lucky.

307
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,062
I can't believe you guys are here!
How was the trip?

308
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,357
- I thought you were coming on the 20th.
- It is the 20th.

309
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,776
Oh, right. Well, that explains it.

310
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,613
- The house, it's not... I'm not ready.
- [clattering]

311
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,532
- Oh, for goodness sake.
- Uh...

312
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,242
Yeah. [clears throat]

313
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,910
Home sweet home.

314
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,328
[chuckles nervously]

315
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,789
Uh... <i>Mi casa es su casa?</i>

316
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,249
[flies buzzing]

317
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,793
Just step on over that one.
Yeah, you can just…

318
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,379
Sorry about the mess.
I bring my work home with me.

319
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,799
There is more, of course.

320
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,636
We eat there. And, um…

321
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,557
And we... And the sleeping is upstairs.
I can show you your room.

322
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,518
Watch your step.
Don't want those falling on any toes.

323
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,728
Solid iron.

324
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,356
You know, safer than the old
strap rail tracks. Much heavier.

325
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,026
Ah, the hazards of running a railroad.

326
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,987
Don't go near those boxes, Cora.

327
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,322
Highly explosive.

328
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,282
- Oh!
- [chickens clucking]

329
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,536
So, ah…

330
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,788
- this is your room.
- Ah.

331
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,207
- What do you think?
- [chuckles softly]

332
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,126
That's a lot of strawberries.

333
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,753
Oh. Um, hmm...

334
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,131
You like strawberries. Right?

335
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,633
I do?

336
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,093
Oh, okay. Well, you used to.

337
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,261
- [toy squeaks]
- Oh!

338
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,432
- Huh.
- [birds squawking]

339
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,851
Yep. You were… You were like this.

340
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:58,977
[chuckles nervously]

341
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:03,148
But now, you're… Now you're like this, so…

342
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,273
- [Cora shrieks]
- Um...

343
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,234
- A mouse! He touched my foot!
- Well...

344
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,529
I'll let you unpack and get settled.

345
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,490
Oh. Where'd you get that?

346
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:16,244
Um, a woman at the rodeo gave it to me.

347
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,163
Oh.

348
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,830
<i>Las Caballeras.</i>

349
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,626
They used to ride with your mother.

350
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,421
Right. Yeah,
they actually said I look just like her.

351
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,885
Ah, well, make yourself comfortable.

352
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,263
There are extra sheets in the hall.

353
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,640
Towels…

354
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,978
[sighs] Yeah. You do…

355
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,940
look just like her.

356
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:51,947
Yep. Really glad you're here.
I missed... missed you.

357
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,283
[Cora] What's that smell?

358
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,534
[Jim] Uh, Cora?

359
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,618
[grunts]

360
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,996
[Cora]
It smells like old potatoes in here.

361
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,666
Whatever this used to be, it's gone bad.

362
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,635
[gasps]

363
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:17,723
[chuckles]

364
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,818
Oh... [chuckles]

365
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,417
[wind blows]

366
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,429
[soft tinkling]

367
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,728
[crowd cheering, faint]

368
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,313
[Lucky laughs softly]

369
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,981
Mama.

370
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,402
- [horse neighing]
- Huh?

371
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,991
[horse neighing in distance]

372
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,790
[humming]

373
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,124
[gasps]

374
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,001
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

375
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,379
I'm gonna go explore!

376
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,633
Yeah. It's probably safer outdoors.

377
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,385
[birds chirping]

378
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,729
[townspeople chattering]

379
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,659
[man 1]
That's the craziest horse I've ever seen!

380
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,077
[man 2] Take it easy there, fella!

381
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,787
- [man 1] Look out for the tail!
- [banging]

382
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,414
[man 2] Watch out, we got a biter!

383
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,332
[Hendricks] Well, bite him back. Let's go!

384
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,376
[man 3] I think he's too much horse
for you, Hendricks.

385
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,045
- [man 2] You try keeping him still!
- [Hendricks] Just step aside.

386
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,881
- You're Lucky Prescott, right?
- Hi!

387
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:17,009
- Pru Granger.
- I know. I saw you at the rodeo.

388
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,844
- You were amazing.
- [horse neighing]

389
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,097
Thanks,
but I totally messed up my rein-back.

390
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,308
I'll get it right for the festival
at the end of summer.

391
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,893
- [Hendricks] Let's go!
- [man 1] Wait!

392
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,477
Is that barn okay?

393
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,521
- [Hendricks] Knuckleheads!
- [Pru] Should hold tight.

394
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,691
Some clowns rented the corral to break
a wild horse they just brought in.

395
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,402
- Break?
- It's not as bad as it sounds.

396
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,321
- [man 2 screams]
- [gasps]

397
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:38,780
For the horse anyway.

398
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,073
[man 4] He bit my mustache!

399
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,491
- [man 3] Fall back!
- [man 2] Look out!

400
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,576
Hendricks, look out!

401
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,412
Yeehaw!

402
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,331
You gonna be worth a lot of money.

403
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,877
Yeehaw!

404
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,462
Let's see what you're made of!

405
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,298
- Yeah!
- [whinnying]

406
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,716
Stop! You're hurting him!

407
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,927
Oh, yeah, that is not right. Hold on.

408
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,011
[Hendricks] Oh, yeah!

409
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,472
That's how you wanna play it? All right.

410
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,016
Whoo! You kicking big now.

411
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,309
[laughs]

412
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,357
- [man 3] Hendricks, look out!
- Ow...

413
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

414
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,986
You crazy horse.

415
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,821
[man 3]
You're the one getting broken today.

416
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,990
Yeah, we'll see about that.

417
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,117
- Hello there, princess.
- [man 2] Get a rope on him!

418
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:27,287
See, I told you these horses right here,
they dangerous.

419
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,498
- Now you best just run along now.
- [man 3] Cut him off!

420
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:32,459
Now, who's the knucklehead
who didn't strap this saddle on right?

421
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,002
- [man 2] It wasn't me!
- [man 1] It was him!

422
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,754
- [Hendricks] Bunch of dimwits.
- [man 2 screaming]

423
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,006
- Dang horse, you ever give up?
- Get away from me!

424
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,510
[shrieking]

425
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,720
- I got him!
- Change of plans, boys.

426
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,182
Let's get this animal under control,
shall we?

427
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,684
I got it! I got it!

428
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,060
Hold up there, big guy!

429
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,771
Hey, whoa, whoa!

430
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,440
I don't know where you guys rode in from,

431
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:58,193
but in my corral,
we treat horses with respect.

432
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,572
If you don't like it,
you can just move along.

433
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,323
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

434
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:06,034
We're absolutely clear. Sure thing, boss.

435
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:11,331
We didn't mean for it to get out of hand.
This mustang's just got a lot of spirit.

436
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,417
All right, boys, let's call it a day.

437
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,627
Give this horse a rest.

438
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,171
- Harder!
- [grunting]

439
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,505
We'll come back tomorrow

440
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,217
when he's nice and thirsty.

441
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,387
Charming.

442
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,558
Boys, I'll have this beast ready
for the work mill in no time,

443
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,894
and then we can have
all the money we need.

444
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,439
Remember me? From the train?

445
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,109
[whinnies]

446
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,694
[Lucky laughs]

447
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,779
You do have a lot of spirit.

448
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,452
You want help filling that back up?

449
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,663
Oh, no way. I wouldn't want you
to get your dress dirty.

450
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:53,749
What? This thing? [scoffs]

451
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,751
Oh. Okay, then.

452
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,921
[Jim] Wait, wait, wait,
let me get this straight.

453
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:03,383
The squirrel came down the stairs
in the middle of his campaign speech?

454
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,470
And landed on my father's face?

455
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,348
The Honorable James Prescott?

456
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,434
Yeah, maybe?

457
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,311
That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.

458
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:18,649
Yeah.

459
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,317
One minute he was all,

460
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,238
"The family motto
is my campaign promise to you..."

461
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,240
[both] "Prescotts never give up."

462
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,744
And then it jumped on his face
and he screamed!

463
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:31,870
[gasps]

464
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,206
Sorry, Aunt Cora.

465
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,047
I think that was just overdue payback

466
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,675
for some food fights
your Aunt Cora started back when I…

467
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,135
I have no idea what you're talking about.

468
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:51,181
I think we've told enough stories
for one night, don't you, Jim?

469
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:56,144
So, Lucky,
how was your first day exploring Miradero?

470
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:57,855
Great. I made some friends.

471
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:01,149
- [gasps]
- Well, I hope we'll be friends.

472
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:04,236
One's kind of shy, and he's a little wild.

473
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,988
- Wild?
- What's his name?

474
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,575
- [stammers] Where's he live?
- His name is…

475
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,244
Spirit.

476
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:17,332
We met on the train.
Well, outside the train, technically.

477
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,585
You mean that horse?

478
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:21,086
The one in Al's corral?

479
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,588
No.

480
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:24,381
No, what?

481
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,717
You will not go near that horse again.

482
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,010
Ever.

483
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,220
But why?

484
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:33,223
It's not Spirit's fault
Mom fell off a horse.

485
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,767
No, no.
You don't know what you're talking about.

486
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,520
You stay away from that horse. No horses.

487
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,523
I'm full.

488
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,195
[sighs] Okay.

489
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,617
[rooster crowing]

490
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,910
[groans]

491
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,037
[humming]

492
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,623
- Pancakes.
- Breakfast.

493
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,541
- My favorite!
- Good morning.

494
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,168
I'm not hungry.

495
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:04,296
Lucky, if you're going out,
you can run some errands.

496
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,380
Fine.

497
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:10,177
I'm gonna check on my guys at the station.
Maybe they'll have breakfast with me.

498
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,012
[groans]

499
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,555
[Pru] Don't you know we got chores to do?

500
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:14,932
Sleeping on the job again.

501
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,433
[Granger] Don't you mind me.

502
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:17,643
Whoa! Dad, look out!

503
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:18,727
- Sorry.
- Hey, Lucky.

504
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,812
Well, Lucky Prescott.

505
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,357
- Oh. [chuckles]
- Where are you off to in such a gallop?

506
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,819
I was… I was just
getting some groceries for Aunt Cora.

507
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:30,656
You're a bit turned around.
Grocer's back that way.

508
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,491
Oh. Yes. Okay, thanks.

509
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:35,160
- Bye, Lucky. I get to drive.
- [both chuckle]

510
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:38,539
Okay. But don't tell your mother.
She'll have my hide.

511
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:40,749
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- [grocer] <i>De nada.</i>

512
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,793
[man] So, what time
does the midnight express come in?

513
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,503
Midnight, dummy.

514
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,089
And security's looser
than my grandpappy's teeth.

515
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:50,259
- Just the old man and his llama.
- I hate llamas.

516
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,635
[whinnying]

517
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,098
Hey. Easy now. Easy.

518
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,599
It's all right, boy.

519
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,186
All this new stuff is kind of scary, huh?

Careful! This is a wild one.

Yeah, he just startled me.

525
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:13,615
Yeah. That's because you startled him.

Oh. [softly] Sorry.

Just take it slow.

Horses can feel what you feel.

530

You might wanna try something
a little less potato-y.

548
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:21,767
Well, Snips said that Boomerang
only really let me ride him

549

so that I would stop singing,
but, I mean, I don't know.

697
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,745
- [Jim] She's okay.
- I can see that.

698
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:27,539
- …and it was scary but exciting.
- Whole girl here. Under control.

699
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:29,750
Lucky, you are lucky
you didn't get yourself killed!

700
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,337
I was just gonna ride him
in the corral, and then…

701
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,547
You shouldn't have been
anywhere near that horse.

702
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,466
[Granger] Come on, troublemakers.

703
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,641
- I ask for one thing. One.
- It was an accident.

704
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,184
- You don't listen.
- But…

705
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,853
You don't listen.
That horse doesn't belong to you.

706
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,730
He doesn't belong
to those wranglers either.

707
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:54,024
They're mistreating him,
and you don't even care.

708
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:56,777
This isn't the city.
Around here we have different rules.

709
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,612
[Lucky]
Well, you should change your rules.

710
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:02,699
And by the way, you can't just come back
into my life and tell me what to do.

711
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,620
You're going back to your grandfather's.
You'll be safe there.

712
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:10,123
- What? That's not fair.
- I'm getting you two on the next train.

713
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,292
I thought Prescotts never give up.

714
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:15,963
But you're giving up on me again!

715
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:18,006
I'm trying to keep you safe.

716
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,551
Sorry to be such a burden.

717
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:23,887
[groans]

718
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:33,105
Well, just be thankful nothing's on fire.

[Cora] Maybe Father was wrong
taking Lucky from you.

724
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:20,694
[Jim] No, he was right.

725
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:23,947
I couldn't keep her mother safe.
How was I supposed to keep her safe?

726
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,742
What happened to Milagro was an accident.

727
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:29,995
You said yourself she'd done that trick
a hundred times before

728
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:31,496
with her eyes closed.

729
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,083
- Ugh.
- But she's so reckless!

730
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,544
Well,
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

731
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:40,297
She's just not safe here.

732
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,883
[Cora]
Sometimes you have to take a risk, Jim.

733
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,469
I did that already,
and that didn't work out.

[Spirit whinnies]

[Cora]
Jim, I've done everything I can for Lucky.

736
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:57,064
What she needs now more than anything
is her father.

737
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,733
She needs you.

738
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,778
I couldn't bear it
if anything happened to her.

739
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:07,699
Cora, I don't know what I'm doing.

All right, boys, let's round 'em up!

785
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:12,671
- I told you boys we'd get the rest of 'em.
- Leave them alone!

- [man 1] You take that one!
- [man 2] Come on, boys!

No!

- All of 'em! Every single one.
- You got it, boss.

Hurry up now, come on. Let's load 'em up.

- Yeah!
- Now, have a nice ride, ladies.

But thank you for leading me
straight to them.

Hendricks! We gotta go
if we're gonna make that boat!

805
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:18,153

The crazy one stays here.

All right, boy.

814
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,828
Let's go get help.

815
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:26,513
Pru, I need your help.

816
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:34,229
So, you want us to get on our horses,
ride all night to stop a speeding train,

817
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:38,025
take down a band of dirty, old thieves
and release a herd of wild horses?

818
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,194
Yeah, maybe.

819
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,029
Lucky, that's crazy.

820
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:45,157
But if we don't try,
Spirit's herd is gone forever.

821
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,117
You know what they do to horses up north?

822
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,911
They work them to death.

823
00:47:49,995 --> 00:47:53,874
Okay, let me show you
exactly how impossible it is.

824
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:57,085
Hendricks and his men are headed
for a boat up here at the docks

825
00:47:57,169 --> 00:48:00,839
on a speeding train,
and we're down here with horses.

826
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:02,674
It's too far.

827
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:06,470
What if we take a shortcut
over this big, pointy thingy?

828
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:09,473
[Pru]
That big pointy thing is Heck Mountain.

829
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:11,767
- [hawk screeches]
- It's impossible to cross on horseback.

830
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,020
That's a full day
and most of the night's ride.

831
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,065
And, even if by some miracle
we did make it,

832
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:21,568
how are we supposed to get the horses off
of a moving train?

833
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:28,742
If a train traveling at 25 miles an hour
has to stop every 100 miles…

834
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:31,119
Aunt Cora was right!
I do need to know this!

835
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:32,538
Uh, what now?

836
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:35,541
The train has to stop
to refill water along the way.

837
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:39,503
If we cut over the mountain, we can
beat the train to this water depot at…

838
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,464
Noon tomorrow.

839
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:46,343

- You don't wanna know.

840
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:48,595
- [ukulele strumming]
- From what I hear,

841
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:52,140
there's a lot of dangers
lurking around those parts.

842
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:56,186
Dangers that only those with good fortune
return from.

843
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:57,980
Return from?

844
00:48:58,605 --> 00:48:59,940
I've heard tales.

845
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:03,735
The most treacherous and merciless
creatures hiding in the shadows.

846
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:06,154
Creatures you wouldn't believe!

847
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:09,908
There's a moose, and he's a-waitin'.

848
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:12,452
But he doesn't know what he's waitin' for.

849
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:13,579
[bellows]

850
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:14,913
Uh, how is she…

851
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:18,709
[Abigail] And they say
at the bottom of a bridge is a shifty fox

852
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:21,545
who's just sitting there being shifty.

853
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:23,672
And then there's a possum

854
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:27,176
that just hangs out lighting matches!

855
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:29,845
[cackling maniacally]

856
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:31,138
[gasps] Whoa!

857
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:32,806
Abigail! Not near the map!

858
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:37,853
I think what Abigail is trying to say is
it's way too dangerous.

859
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:43,108
If you're not gonna help me,
Spirit and I will be fine on our own.

860
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:49,698
You know, Pru, you're right.

861
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:53,410
We would never be able to save those poor,

862
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:56,205
innocent, beautiful horses.

863
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:58,415
- I smell rule breaking.
- [brays]

864
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:01,668
Uh-oh.

865
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:08,050
- [Abigail] Hey, Lucky, wait up!
- [Pru] Lucky?

866
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,636
- Lucky, wait for us!
- You changed your mind.

867
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,263
No, I still think this is a terrible idea.

868
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:14,640
But…

869
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:17,100
But…

870
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:18,519
this is Miradero.

871
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:20,479
Out here, we stick together.

872
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,105
Thanks, guys.

873
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:25,108
You can thank us after we make it
over that big, pointy thing.

- [Abigail] Heck Mountain.
- [hawk screeches]

875
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:30,989
We'd better hurry up if we wanna make it
to the water depot before noon tomorrow.

876
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:32,991
- Ooh! Easy, boy.
- Okay.

Yeah, but, like, not so…

00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:45,128
- [roars] You're liable to cramp.
- I know, I know.

00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:47,089
Hold on, Spirit! Careful!

882
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:48,298
Careful!

When you trust yourself,
your horse will too.

He'll know exactly what you're thinking,
then you'll be joined up.

that you liberated a monkey from the zoo.

[Pru chuckles] The birthday that flooded.

898
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:40,184
[Abigail] Or the time you "accidentally"
locked the math tutor in the closet

899
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,393
and couldn't get him out.

He really talks about me that much?

902
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,650
Sometimes my dad pretends
he has to go to the bathroom

903
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:50,611
just to get your dad
to stop talking about you.

- See?

905
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:53,739
I told you there was a moose waiting!

906
00:51:57,117 --> 00:52:00,037
[Pru] Here it is. We cross this bridge

907
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,915
and then it's a straight shot
up the mountain to the water depot.

908
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:05,125
[Lucky]
Is it supposed to move that much?

909

[Pru] It's fine.

910
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,546
Suspension bridges are built

00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:16,345
- [Abigail] Gulp.
- [Lucky] Oh. [chuckles nervously]

912
00:52:16,428 --> 00:52:18,096
[Abigail, echoing] Now what?

913
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,099
Now I decide not to die
falling into a canyon,

914
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:24,645
but instead go home and have
my dad kill me for even attempting this.

915
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:26,980
- And just give up?

But we don't have a choice.

00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:35,739
No, give me a minute.
I'll figure out a different way.

919
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,074
- [Abigail] Take your time.
- What?

920
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:39,910
- What?
- Boomerang and I'll just wait over here.

- What? How did she...
- What?

922

The great Pru Granger
can't handle a little jump?

927
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:56,343
Okay, I guess we're doing this.

928
00:52:56,426 --> 00:53:01,056
All right, don't look down,
don't pull back, and just trust him.

she's just blowing off some steam.

- Just give her some time.
- I was looking for this.

I'm sure she's perfectly fine
wherever she is.

random stories when we need them?

Yeah, but now we're too far
down the canyon
