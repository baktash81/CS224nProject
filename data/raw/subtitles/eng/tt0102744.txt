1
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,307
Watch yourselves. Watch out there!

2
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,067
Hello, hello.

3
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,236
Either hurry up or let the man pass.

4
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,156
Partner, these people
have come a long way, too,

5
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,576
so I know you won't mind
them going ahead. Ma'am.

6
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:49,251
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Excuse me. I'm next.

7
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,635
Old people should go last
or get the hell out of the way.

8
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,599
I'm so sorry, Mr. Quigley.
We seem to be holding that man up.

9
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,311
No, ma'am. I just spoke to him, and
he ain't in that big a hurry after all.

10
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,370
Come on!

11
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,378
- Where are you from, mate?
- Wyoming.

12
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,632
- That near Sydney?
- Bit further north.

13
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,386
Hey. I can tell you're a bloke
who's looking for somebody.

14
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,306
- No? Something?
- I could use a good horse.

15
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,559
It's a gentleman from the land of
the free and the home of the brave.

16
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,644
A drink, sir?

17
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,647
A place to rest your bones?
A woman, perhaps?

18
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,165
Ow!

19
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,959
Oh!

20
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,216
You're asking for bloody trouble
mixing in with this lot.

21
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:23,095
I don't reckon the lady's
all that anxious to get in your wagon.

22
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,515
Roy? Oh, Roy, it's you!

23
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,978
- I'm not Roy, lady.
- Every time there's a ship from America

24
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,731
I come down here looking for you.
Thank God you've come for me!

25
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,026
I'm sorry, Roy. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

26
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,946
Does Crazy Cora belong to you?

27
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,700
Didn't say that. I said
she don't wanna get in your wagon.

28
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,122
The boss says we can
take some white tarts back,

29
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,708
'cause we're sick of black ladies.

30
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,920
So you just tell Cora to come quiet, and
we'll feed her regular and everything.

31
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,880
Please take me home, Roy.

32
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,264
Bugger off, mate.

33
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,060
Excuse me.

34
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,613
I'm new here,
so I ain't rightly certain.

35
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,743
Is everybody in this country
as butt ugly as you three?

36
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,045
What do you want?

37
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,131
Give him another one!

38
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,633
Don't let the bugger
get behind you, mate!

39
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,552
Back for more, he is?

40
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,975
Look out, Roy.

41
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,604
Sorry, Roy!

42
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,132
- You stay out of this!
- I'm sorry, Roy.

43
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,259
My name ain't Roy.
It's Matthew Quigley.

44
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,471
You?

45
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,058
You're the fella Marston
sent us to bring back.

46
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,228
We sure showed 'em.
Didn't we, Roy?

47
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,245
You got somethin' against
ridin' horses in this country?

48
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,249
We ride 'em when it suits us.
Bullocks eat and drink rougher.

49
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,292
You can put your saddle
on one of them, if you like.

50
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,633
Riding in the back of the wagon
with the women.

51
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,385
I should've known to bring my own horse.

52
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,098
- I wasn't talking to you.
-  Don't worry, Roy.

53
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,975
Everything's gonna turn out just fine.

54
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,769
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna bandage your head.

55
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,189
- No you're not.
- It must hurt real bad.

56
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,566
- I wanna help it get better.
- Quit!

57
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,653
You've helped me enough already.

58
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,449
I'm much obliged.

59
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,709
I don't know why you're being
such a big baby about this, Roy.

60
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,085
Just hold still.

61
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,047
Quit! Now who the hell
is this Roy, anyway?

62
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,175
Hey! Do you need a hand
with Crazy Cora?

63
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,105
Here.

64
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,650
Thank you.

65
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,824
Look, lady. I don't know no Roy,
so you just leave me alone.

66
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,419
Go on.

67
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,562
Yoo-hoo.

68
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,024
Good night, Roy.

69
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,738
Good night, lady.

70
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,300
- What the bloody hell is it?
- Redcoats.

71
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,511
Mr. Ashley-Bloody-Pitt and his heroes.

72
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,934
- Friends of yours?
- They're British.

73
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,922
Get that bloody thing
away from my team!

74
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,632
Why are you taking the body back?

75
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,386
We've got orders to bring in
all suspected cattle thieves.

76
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:23,348
- The bugger's dead.
- The trial will not be lengthy.

77
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,936
- Carry on, sergeant.
- We're looking for two deserters.

78
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,231
- Can't say I blame 'em.
- Have you seen 'em?

79
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,027
- No.
- New distractions?

80
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,947
Who's this chap on the back here?

81
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,201
- The Yank Marston's brought out.
- Yank?

82
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:48,415
Come to do for Marston what these
bog-lrish convicts obviously can't.

83
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,418
Well, you just do yourjob
and stay out of trouble.

84
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:56,131
In our experience,
Americans are uncouth misfits

85
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,217
who have been run out
of their own barbaric country.

86
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,637
- Well, lieutenant...
- Major!

87
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:10,061
Major, we already run
the misfits out of our country.

88
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,815
We sent 'em back to England.

89
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,102
What are they, koala bears?

90
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,355
Kangaroos, I reckon.

91
00:12:56,233 --> 00:13:00,195
Well, whatever they are, Roy, nature
sure played an awful trick on 'em.

92
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,407
I am fed up with you.
And I am fed up with Roy, whoever he is.

93
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:09,537
- My name is Matthew.
- Well, pardon the hell outta me.

94
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,123
I can't believe you would
talk to me like that, Roy.

95
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,751
I oughta wash your mouth out
with soap if I had some.

96
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,045
Lady, you are about
half a bubble off the plumb,

97
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,047
and that's for sure and for certain.

98
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:24,052
Just because the road is rocky, doesn't
mean your spirits should get rocky, too.

99
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,765
When do we get to Marston's ranch?

100
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,935
Been on his bloody land
for the last two days.

101
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,097
Things seem different here.

102
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,269
They say God made Australia last,
don't you know?

103
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,064
After he got tired of making
everything else the same.

104
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,943
Well, I've seen some pretty country,
that's for certain.

105
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,491
What are you doing so far from home?

106
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,541
There hasn't been anyone else but you.

107
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,128
You know that, don't you?

108
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,717
You can take me if you want to, Roy.

109
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,304
God Almighty, lady. Go to sleep.

110
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,725
Whoo-hoo!

111
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,747
Hey, look at that.

112
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,366
Hey-up!

113
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,745
Good to see you.

114
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,000
Get back to work.
Here you go, lads.

115
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,754
Wait till you see
what we've got for you.

116
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,216
Matthew Quigley.

117
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,012
Elliott Marston. Welcome to Australia.

118
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,681
Well, sir, your men already welcomed me.

119
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,479
Coogan, Mr. Quigley's luggage.
Take it to the lodge.

120
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,155
Mr. Marston, you said you'd
pay me 50 dollars in gold coin

121
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,949
- just for showing up.
- You don't waste much time.

122
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,201
I spent three months on a boat
just gettin' here.

123
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,331
You intrigued me, Mr. Quigley.

124
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,961
Twenty-one men answered my
advertisement, from all over the world.

125
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,131
Canada, India, England.

126
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,176
They just wrote letters.

127
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:38,556
But you... had a way with words.

128
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:45,813
My advertisement stated that I wanted to
hire the finest marksman in the world.

129
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Have I?

130
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,668
Uh-huh.

131
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,255
The legendary Sharp.

132
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,468
You know your weapons.
It's a lever-action breech loader.

133
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,224
Usual barrel length's 30 inches.
This one has an extra four.

134
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:26,020
It's converted to use a special
.45-caliber, 110-grain metal cartridge

135
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,731
with a 540-grain paper-patched bullet.

136
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,860
It's fitted with double set triggers
and a vernier sight.

137
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,742
It's marked up to 1200 yards.
This one shoots a mite further.

138
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,874
An experimental weapon
with experimental ammunition.

139
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,669
You could call it that.

140
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,672
Let's experiment.

141
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,053
Whitey, take that bucket
and ride out until I signal.

142
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,440
Tell me when you want him to stop.

143
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,333
Your man able to hit
something that far away?

144
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:36,591
I don't know him.
I never saw him before.

145
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,845
He'd have to be a good shot all right.

146
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,644
'Bout there'll do.

147
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,445
Bullshit.

148
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,472
Are you quite certain, Mr. Quigley,

149
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,102
that you wouldn't like
the bucket a bit closer?

150
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,277
Jesus Christ!

151
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,197
Quite certain.

152
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,341
Told you. Only my Roy could
hit a coyote from that distance.

153
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,314
Very impressive. You're hired.

154
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,073
Would you excuse me for a minute?

155
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,409
There's some business
I have to attend to.

156
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,787
You might find this interesting.

157
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,123
Nice shootin', Roy.

158
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,626
Mr. Marston?

159
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,007
I think there's been a mistake.
The one they call Crazy Cora.

160
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,011
I'd appreciate it
if your men leave her alone

161
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,931
- till you and I have a chance to talk.
- Whatever you want.

162
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,150
You are deserters from
Her Majesty's armed forces.

163
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,778
The penalty for your crime is death.

164
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,697
You were caught on my land.
I could have you shot for trespassing.

165
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,493
Look, you let us stay here,
guv'nor, we'll serve you proper.

166
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,121
Better than this
convict scum you've got.

167
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,459
Well, unfortunately, your commanding
officer Major Ashley-Pitt and I

168
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,420
have an understanding,
and so, I'm afraid,

169
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,964
you'll be sent back
to face the firing party.

170
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:08,302
But I see no reason why you
should be trussed up like animals.

171
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,013
Mr. Dobkin.

172
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,232
This is my preferred weapon,
Mr. Quigley.

173
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,194
Do join me for dinner.

174
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,208
You've got to admit, the Yank's
a damn good shot with a long rifle.

175
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,461
Oh, sure. But you give me
a weapon like that,

176
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,713
and I could beat him with my eyes shut.

177
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,550
Easy to say, O'Flynn.
You've got a lot to learn.

178
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,262
I ain't got a lot to learn. Look at you,
Dobkin. You've been here 12 years,

179
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,806
and all you've got to show for it
is cold mutton.

180
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,808
He's in, getting a fancy dinner.

181
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,810
Huh?

182
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,356
You were actually in Dodge City?

183
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,402
William Hickok must have been there.

184
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,364
Spent a night there once.
I was pretty tired.

185
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:56,076
Dodge City's a nice place
to get some sleep.

186
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,626
Are you familiar with
the army revolver, Mr. Quigley?

187
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,423
Well, sir, I never had much use for one.

188
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,719
It's a recent invention of
your countryman, Colonel Colt.

189
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:20,100
God created all men. They say
Sam Colt made 'em equal. More or less.

190
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:27,274
That's what I like about you Americans.
You're people of action, not words.

191
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:31,070
That mint jelly on your lamb.

192
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,031
It's my own creation.

193
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,577
No, I'm a student of your American West.
I've read a great deal about it.

194
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,748
Tell me about dingoes.

195
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,128
Ten pounds a month
for shooting wild dogs

196
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,130
seems like a whole lot for not much.

197
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,134
Besides, you got enough men
and guns outside

198
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,179
to kill every dingo
within ten miles of here.

199
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,766
Unless you're talking about deserters.

200
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,022
Did you know that your American Indian

201
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,651
is a race that has no word for "wheel."

202
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,740
No concept of farming.
No understanding of land ownership.

203
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,827
Is that a fact?

204
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:26,333
From what I hear, you found a solution
to that problem in your country.

205
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,838
I guess that depends on
whether you're an Indian or not.

206
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:39,972
You see, in many ways...
our two nations are quite similar.

207
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:45,269
We both brought civilization
to the Stone Age.

208
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:53,152
Unfortunately, in this country
we have failed in one regard.

209
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:58,157
We have been unable to domesticate
the most backward people in the world...

210
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,909
...the Australian Aborigine.

211
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,496
Don't mind him. He's harmless.

212
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,382
My parents were slaughtered
by Aborigines, Mr. Quigley.

213
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:21,430
They attacked so fast my mother
was found dead still holding her sewing.

214
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,684
Nowadays they butcher
our sheep and cattle.

215
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,395
Her Majesty's government
allows the local settlers

216
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,481
to deal with the matter their own way.

217
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:36,904
It's official policy.
It's called "pacification by force."

218
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,909
But the real issue...

219
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,246
...is that, primitive as they are,

220
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,668
the Aborigines have learned
to keep out of rifle range.

221
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,842
Which brings us to you... Mr. Quigley.

222
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,598
What the hell?

223
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,147
No! Stay right where you are.

224
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,111
No man knocks me out of my own house.

225
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,585
Don't just stand there. Get him.

226
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,636
- Has he got the rifle with him?
- He keeps it right beside him.

227
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,180
I said, get him!

228
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,619
He's just sitting in there
with that big gun.

229
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,642
Keep down. Kelly, up there.
Carver, take the side.

230
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,689
Brophy, around the back.

231
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,075
Fancy American shooter.

232
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,914
Eating real fancy, eh?

233
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,596
Go on, kick him in the back! Give it
to him in the back. Go on, that's it.

234
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,643
Leave Roy alone!

235
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,145
Get her off me!

236
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,954
Throw him in the wagon. Haul him
two days from here and dump him.

237
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,999
Let Australia kill him.

238
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,711
And that crazy woman, too.

239
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,715
You forgot the gold.

240
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,010
What did he say?

241
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:14,514
- You forgot the gold.
- Marston.

242
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,935
He paid him in gold.

243
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,771
He's right.

244
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,545
Leave us some water
and you can have the gold.

245
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,258
- I can have the gold anyway.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

246
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,728
Yah!

247
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,691
Yah!

248
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,588
Go on!

249
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,060
Come on! Yah!

250
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,796
Yah!

251
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,874
I wish people would quit
hitting me on the head.

252
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,584
Don't worry.

253
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,296
On a new job, it's quite common
for things not to go well at first.

254
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,998
- We should...
- What?

255
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,421
I remember, my granddaddy told me
how, when you're lost in the desert,

256
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,883
you should sleep during the day
and walk at night.

257
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,427
Your granddaddy tell you that?

258
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:43,598
He also tell you we'll die in the desert
without those horses?

259
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,561
What good are horses if we die first?

260
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,315
Once in a while she actually
makes a little sense.

261
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,863
- What did you say, Roy?
- Never mind.

262
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,182
Good morning, Major.

263
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,225
Marston.

264
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,148
What can I get for you?
Some refreshment?

265
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,983
That's very kind, sir.

266
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:27,530
I'd be obliged if you would
identify for me two dead bodies.

267
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,663
Two men absconded.

268
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,208
But I imagine this is
a couple of newcomers

269
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,126
who wandered off together, recently.

270
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,671
A man and a woman?

271
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:52,889
Two men. One has been stabbed
and one shot through the head.

272
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,808
Coogan and Miller.

273
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,981
It would appear that the man
and the woman are still missing.

274
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,695
Yes, it would, wouldn't it?

275
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,157
Don't worry, Major.

276
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,829
I have no doubt I'll find them.

277
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,778
Hey, lady.

278
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,199
You OK?

279
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,618
Think so.

280
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,002
What are they gonna do to us?

281
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,800
I reckon they already done it.
They gave us water.

282
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,472
But that don't make sense.

283
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,810
They let me keep it when every white man
with a rifle's trying to kill 'em.

284
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,647
- Except you.
- They don't know that.

285
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,816
Don't they?

286
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,319
Something tells me you and I
were on the shady side of dead.

287
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:57,323
This is a special place.
Bet they used magic on us.

288
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:01,995
That old man over there,
looks like he's... some kind of chief,

289
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,289
or medicine man, or something.

290
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,250
What's this? There.

291
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,965
More than likely something
that came out of the south end

292
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,343
- of a northbound kangaroo.
- You mean kangaroo shit?

293
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,825
Very kind.

294
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,954
- Do you think they're safe to eat?
- You got a better idea?

295
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,511
Much obliged.

296
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,726
Go on.

297
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,688
I don't eat things
that are still moving.

298
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,401
Gonna shoot it first?

299
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,456
Mm-hmm.

300
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,473
- Yo? Yo?
- Yo.

301
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,059
Yo? Yo!

302
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,602
Yo!

303
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:04,075
After you cut this strip out
of this big piece of kangaroo...

304
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,120
There we go. Take...

305
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,010
Here.

306
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,067
Swing your arm. Just roll your wrist.

307
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,821
You gotta keep that loop open.
See how that loop stays open?

308
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,783
You look at what you're throwing at.
Swing the rope and throw right at it.

309
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,164
Then you just pull him in.

310
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,721
You just wait till you try this.

311
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,724
But you gotta guess what it is.

312
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,438
That little girl is so darling.

313
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,734
She sure is.

314
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,198
Not as darling as Roy Junior.

315
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,285
God Almighty, lady, not another Roy.

316
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:18,876
I don't know about you, but my stomach
thinks my throat's been cut.

317
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,258
Roy was hunting sage hens
when the Comanches came.

318
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:32,014
I grabbed the baby and a pistol,
and I hid in the root cellar out back.

319
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,600
The Indians tore up our sod house.

320
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,645
I was real quiet,
but then the baby started crying.

321
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:41,858
I tried to shush him and suckle him,
but he just wouldn't stop.

322
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:46,904
One Comanche, I remember, he acted
real drunk and wore my green apron.

323
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:51,075
He must have heard something.
He started hollering and coming closer.

324
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,245
So I put my hand gentle-like
over my baby's mouth.

325
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,290
"Don't cry. Daddy'll be home soon."

326
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,295
The Indians found us,
but they just laughed.

327
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:07,466
They was drunk, didn't wanna
hurt anybody, and rode away.

328
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:15,224
At sundown, Roy came home, but I was
still afraid to come out of the cellar.

329
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:20,396
I was afraid of what he'd do
when he saw I'd smothered our son.

330
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,362
I ought to find some way
to mend this petticoat. Look at that.

331
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,083
Roy...

332
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:49,050
He just buried the baby,
put me in the wagon,

333
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:52,887
and we went 70 miles
to Galveston without stopping.

334
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:56,307
He never said a word.

335
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:04,023
Put me on the first ship he found.
It was headed to Australia.

336
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,862
Then he said,

337
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,909
"Don't want no woman that would
kill my son to save herself."

338
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,164
And he turned and he walked away,
and he never looked back.

339
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:27,129
I know, 'cause I watched
to see if he would.

340
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,762
This thing is just falling apart.

341
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,475
It's just...

342
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,419
I'm tired.

343
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,632
Don't exactly talk your ear off
saying goodbye, do they?

344
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,431
The Johnsons were always like that.

345
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,142
What?

346
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,978
Remember the church social last year?

347
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:10,149
They ate everybody's jams and pies
and left without saying a word.

348
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,944
It's our own fault for
inviting 'em again this year.

349
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,739
Why would they do that?

350
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,367
That's why.

351
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,918
Oh, no. No!

352
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,921
No. Stay back!

353
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,854
No!

354
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:03,869
Over there!

355
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,633
No!

356
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,388
Shit.

357
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,598
Of all the damn fool things
I ever did see!

358
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,601
You trying to get your head blown off?

359
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:22,448
Anyone who believes in magic...
is crazy.

360
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,083
Don't be running off like that.

361
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,504
I could have used
some help up there, you know.

362
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,303
Well, I got my rig back.

363
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:49,475
But no saddlebags,
which means I can't make my reload.

364
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,978
We got one horse and two canteens.

365
00:53:56,816 --> 00:54:00,986
And a rider got away. Which means
Marston'll know where we are.

366
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,656
Yeah. And we don't.

367
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:05,509
- I'm cold.
- You got the blanket.

368
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,100
Maybe we could share it tonight.

369
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,395
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

370
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:22,318
If we do, there'll be something
I wanna talk to you about.

371
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:58,687
When summer comes, let's drag up
some wood for a real cabin.

372
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:02,691
- 'Cause, Roy, sod walls...
- Matthew.

373
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,283
Matthew Quigley.

374
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:16,538
I ain't sharing my bed till I'm certain
you know who's in it. Now say it.

375
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:23,128
If we had a wood cabin
we could get glass windows.

376
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,136
We'll see.

377
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,898
The sea's gotta be west.

378
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:47,486
That's how we're headed,
but you sure wouldn't know it.

379
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,781
Ow! Hell!

380
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,325
Do you see that?

381
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,995
I sure did. Biggest ant I ever did see.

382
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,628
- What's my name today?
- Matthew Quigley,

383
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,838
same as any other day.

384
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:09,550
How's about you and me taking off
all our clothes and going swimming?

385
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,347
What are you? Crazy?
There ain't no water.

386
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,309
Why, shame on you!

387
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,147
Well, you...
What about last night? You...

388
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,565
I what?

389
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,530
Oh, never mind.

390
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:45,377
- How's that, then, Mr. Marston?
- Pretty good, O'Flynn. You've improved.

391
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,505
Wear your holster a bit higher,
then grab your gun on the way up.

392
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,216
- But I'm faster, aren't I?
- Yeah.

393
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,721
- Think I'll ever be as fast as you?
- You mean if you practiced a lot?

394
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:56,889
- Yeah.
- No.

395
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,609
Not again.

396
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,154
Where are the others?

397
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,741
Dead. All dead.

398
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,410
Quigley. He was everywhere.

399
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:24,708
Four more. I don't believe this.
Did you see him?

400
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,295
- It was too far away.
- How far?

401
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,924
- Three quarters of a mile, maybe.
- That's impossible.

402
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:36,553
How long from the time the bullet struck
until you heard the report of the rifle?

403
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,265
Two, maybe three seconds.

404
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,897
Matthew Quigley is really
beginning to annoy me.

405
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,444
Dobkin. How many men
can we send out there?

406
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:58,283
These and two others.
Six men are still on a hunting party.

407
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,453
All right.

408
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,749
There's 50 pounds, in gold,
to the man who brings Quigley in.

409
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,378
So keep practicing.

410
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,633
- If we're lost, you can tell me.
- We're lost.

411
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,804
- I can take bad news. Tell me straight.
- I don't know where the hell we are.

412
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,431
No sense in taking time
to make it sound better than it is.

413
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,684
I reckon we're going in circles.

414
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,852
You flower things up,
I'll see right through it.

415
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,189
So just tell me, honestly, are we lost?

416
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,152
No. I know exactly where we are.

417
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,407
That's good. 'Cause, frankly,
I was getting a little worried.

418
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,995
Don't know where we're going,
but there's no use being late.

419
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,674
Yah!

420
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,521
Come on!

421
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,499
Get the bloody hell outta here!
Quick! Come on, hurry up!

422
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,301
My back's broke.

423
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:48,680
Your gut's shot, Hobb.
There ain't nothing I can do for you.

424
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,933
You can kill me.

425
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,354
Where's Marston's station from here?

426
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:01,693
- How far's the nearest town?
- Why should I tell you?

427
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,447
'Cause if you don't, I'll let you live.

428
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:18,627
You know, I'm new here,
so I'm kinda curious.

429
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:23,215
Do you think the dingoes
will get you first? Or the ants?

430
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:29,679
Quigley, don't leave me like this!

431
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:36,061
Quigley! Marston's station's
two days' ride southwest.

432
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,023
Meekathanga's only 20 miles
past the billabong.

433
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:43,443
Talk straight, Goddamn it!
Or I'll get the ants myself.

434
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:48,824
It's a town, a day's ride
past the dry riverbed.

435
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,869
That way.

436
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,508
Now finish me.

437
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,691
You got one shot left in that shooter.

438
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,236
Make the most of it.

439
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:15,535
All right. All right. Sweet thing.

440
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,913
You're the sweetest little thing.

441
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,831
Sweet, little thing.

442
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,401
I reckon we should keep moving
till we find some help.

443
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:52,864
I reckon we should stop for the night.
The baby's hurt, weak. He needs shelter.

444
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,034
The kid's probably tougher than we are.

445
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,678
That little fella
was eatin' like his bellybutton

446
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:17,180
had been rubbing a blister
on his backbone.

447
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:22,394
Yeah, he was eating,
but he needs some milk.

448
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,939
I don't recall seeing a whole
lot of milking cows around here.

449
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,864
There should be a town
to the southwest.

450
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:42,038
I reckon we could make it
in a hard day's ride.

451
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:45,208
We can't make it.
He should stay here with me.

452
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,336
You can make the ride faster without us.

453
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,841
Well...

454
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,764
Just leave me
the extra rifle and pistol.

455
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,850
You know how to use a shooter?

456
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,520
I am a native-born Texican.

457
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:13,945
There's enough water for two days,
if I ain't here drinking it.

458
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,409
What do you think?

459
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,248
What? What's the matter?

460
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,127
You.

461
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:33,798
You're the only man on this continent
that would ask me what I think.

462
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:41,222
- That ought to do you.
- Thanks for the lizards.

463
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,310
You've checked the guns three times.
There's food and water. We're fine.

464
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:47,979
Get going.

465
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:03,995
If you run into any of his own people,
you'll give 'em Little Bit, won't you?

466
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,334
You gotta promise me.

467
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,923
Sure could use something else to wear.

468
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,636
He'd be better off with them.
You know that, don't you?

469
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:23,640
If you see any dresses that aren't
too costly, red's my favorite color.

470
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,684
Red or even pink,
but red's my favorite.

471
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,569
I should be back in two days.
If I ain't back in three...

472
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:39,489
- You'll be back.
- You bet.

473
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:28,598
Highly unusual calibration,
Mr. Quigley.

474
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:33,311
- This will take some time to duplicate.
- No, sir, it won't.

475
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,564
You can substitute a 450,
number two British musket lead.

476
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:41,277
- Marston ain't gonna wait.
- Marston? He's a murderer.

477
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:44,906
He mixes flour with poison
to kill the Aborigines.

478
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:49,786
- Yes, this is a cruel, uncivilized...
- Papa. Let the man eat.

479
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,497
He's got a long ride
ahead of him tonight.

480
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,917
I was able to find
some condensed milk for the baby

481
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,753
and tins of beef for you and your woman.

482
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:03,091
- Ma'am, she ain't exactly my woman.
- Klaus, come over here.

483
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,678
Mr. Quigley,
I would like you to meet my son.

484
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,012
Pleased to meet you.

485
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:11,557
I know who you are.
You're the American.

486
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,269
The one who's been
helping the Aborigines.

487
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,522
Is that the rifle
I've been hearing about?

488
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,527
You can take a look at it,
if you'd like, son.

489
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,451
- It's so heavy.
- Well, you get used to it.

490
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,413
Son, I hid my horse
in the gully out back.

491
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,164
I'd be much obliged
if you'd bring it up.

492
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:36,791
Yes, sir.

493
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:42,714
Klaus, after you get Mr. Quigley's
horse, saddle up ours as well.

494
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,424
Yes, Papa.

495
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,053
He didn't get all that
from a "wanted" poster.

496
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:51,472
Everyone knows about you.

497
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:57,312
The Aborigines who come to town to trade
with us talk about the "spirit warrior."

498
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,192
I've been called a lot of things,
ma'am... Never that.

499
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,528
Yeah.

500
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:29,385
Get the others.

501
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:32,472
Young fella,
where'd you get this saddle?

502
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:54,786
Shh!

503
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,621
Don't cry.

504
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,040
Daddy'll be home soon.

505
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,449
Shh! Shh!

506
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:36,994
Don't cry. Hush, baby.
Hush, baby. Hush, baby.

507
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:38,830
Shh, shh.

508
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,501
Shh. Daddy'll be home soon. Shh.

509
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:50,675
Daddy'll be home soon.
Daddy'll be home soon.

510
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:52,677
Shh, shh.

511
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:55,179
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

512
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,306
Daddy'll be home soon.
Daddy'll be home soon.

513
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,104
Oh!

514
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:10,236
No, you cry. You wanna cry?
You cry if you want to.

515
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,864
Go on, darling, cry!

516
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:16,909
Hell, let's both make some noise!

517
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:17,994
<i>Shall We Gather
at the River

518
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:21,205
<i>Yes, we will gather at the river

519
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:25,501
<i>The beautiful, beautiful river

520
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,966
<i>Yes, we will gather at the river dd

521
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:42,768
Git!

522
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:50,401
Did you see that? I got the one
wearing my green apron!

523
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:54,864
Run, you damn cowards.
Get your yellow butts outta here!

524
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:04,457
Six...

525
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:09,212
You'll be hot after this.

526
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,840
One, two...

527
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,763
By the time you return
with the woman and the baby,

528
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,557
I will have your cartridges ready.

529
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,478
Until then.

530
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:31,317
Much obliged, but...
never had much use for one.

531
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,531
I know I can't repay you
for what you've done, but...

532
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,741
- No, please.
- No, you take it.

533
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:43,579
- It's Marston's.
- In that case...

534
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:46,624
Are you certain you won't
stay the night? You need the rest.

535
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:47,667
No, ma'am.

536
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:51,128
Klaus should be here
with the horses by now.

537
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,923
I'd best be getting back.

538
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,809
- Get back inside.
- What?

539
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,394
Now!

540
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,148
- Get here!
- No!

541
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:15,403
Around the front. Oliver, with me.

542
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,334
Check the lane.

543
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:42,847
- What the hell's going on?
- He's out the front.

544
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,181
Get out!

545
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,786
We got him. Watch the windows.

546
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:09,957
Upstairs.

547
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,585
Get 'round the back.

548
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,849
You, with clean water. Quick!

549
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,631
Hmm.

550
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:51,142
Oh, shit!

551
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:14,498
He's done for.
The bloody place is falling apart.

552
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:26,010
Quigley! Hey, get 'round here!

553
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,533
Nobody could live through that.

554
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:18,562
- Did you see where he went?
- It's pitch black there.

555
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:22,817
- He couldn't have made it.
- Why not?

556
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:27,404
- Go down and have a look.
- No, no. You go. I'll stay here.

557
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:30,616
Excuse me.

558
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,251
I give up! Quigley!

559
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,169
Hey, don't shoot.

560
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:47,091
There. See? Look. Nothing.

561
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,969
You might wanna try your luck
with that belly gun.

562
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:51,887
Then again, you might not.

563
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:56,058
That's what I figured.

564
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:08,529
Mama.

565
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:10,781
Mama.

566
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:12,992
Mama!

567
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,620
Klaus, my...

568
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:30,593
Why?

569
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:58,454
Now, you take a good look.

570
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,043
Even if you kill me,
Marston'll catch ya. He's coming for ya.

571
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,462
I ain't gonna kill ya.

572
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,673
'Cause you're gonna go tell Marston
I'm coming after him.

573
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,551
Now git.

574
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,735
Get here. Get here quick!

575
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:40,829
- Don't bother to knock, will you?
- Quigley's coming.

576
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,873
He's killed two for sure,
Paddy and Oliver.

577
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:46,543
Quigley said to tell you he's coming for
you. He'll get us all. I know he will.

578
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:49,254
Oh, shut up.

579
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:53,300
One man, and he's beaten all of you.

580
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:00,057
Brophy, you and Mitchell
ride with me as far as the gap.

581
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:03,227
Dobkin, get every available man.
I'll find Ashley-Pitt.

582
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:06,730
- Yes, sir.
- And get him out of here.

583
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:08,941
He's bleeding all over the rug.

584
01:23:58,783 --> 01:23:59,825
Lady?

585
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:01,827
You OK?

586
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:03,579
No, no. It's all right.

587
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,083
What happened?

588
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:14,006
The Comanches came.

589
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,303
But Little Bitty's just fine.

590
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:22,514
I killed the Comanches, and he's just...

591
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:25,601
He's just fine, honey.

592
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:34,151
You're quite a woman, Cora.

593
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,244
You get any sage hens?

594
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:52,211
I got the next best thing.

595
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,883
They didn't have a red one.

596
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,011
Oh.

597
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:09,269
- No matter. Is it pretty?
- Looks good on me.

598
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:20,114
- I missed you.
- You did?

599
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:23,909
Who'd you miss?

600
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:28,497
- You.
- Me? Not that other fella?

601
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:31,166
You.

602
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,880
I don't want you to go.

603
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,300
You sure look pretty
in that new blue dress.

604
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:43,053
If you go after
Marston, he'll kill you.

605
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:48,851
Kid, next time she talks like that,
pee all over the dress.

606
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:48,952
You have every right
to your happiness, Cora.

607
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,515
I don't suppose I can convince you.

608
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,726
No, sir.

609
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:21,438
I will see to it that
she gets out of here safely.

610
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,370
Thank you.

611
01:29:56,182 --> 01:30:00,310
You know something, lady?
I ain't figured you out yet.

612
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:05,774
Good. Crazy people are blessed
that way, don't you know?

613
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:09,736
I'll never see you again, will I?

614
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:19,496
Mmm.

615
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:25,794
You sure look pretty
in the morning sun.

616
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,389
Bye.

617
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:56,176
Everything ready?

618
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,470
There are two men at the front
and one at the back.

619
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:00,722
Scotty's riding up
to patrol to the ridge.

620
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:04,100
Mr. Marston, the men were wondering

621
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:08,480
if the man who kills Quigley
will get the 200 pounds in gold.

622
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,982
The reward you posted.

623
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:14,569
Who asked you about it?

624
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:17,405
Cavanagh.

625
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:22,077
Have Cavanagh guard the front porch.

626
01:32:22,995 --> 01:32:25,288
Tell him to wear my coat and hat.

627
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:47,143
Marston. He's around the back.

628
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:48,812
What the hell is he doing?

629
01:32:49,855 --> 01:32:52,315
Emptying his revolver. He wants it
freshly loaded for the night.

630
01:32:54,151 --> 01:32:55,318
Do you think he's losing his cabbage?

631
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:21,803
Maybe Scotty's got Quigley.

632
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,604
"Anyone can leave safely before dawn
except Marston.

633
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:17,233
- Most cordially, Matthew Quigley."
- He must think I'm stupid.

634
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:21,321
This means he's gonna try and spring
something on us during the night.

635
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:24,949
All right. Nobody sleeps.

636
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:28,036
Give me that.

637
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:11,246
Stay awake.

638
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,090
Marston!

639
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:26,636
Mr. Marston!

640
01:35:31,517 --> 01:35:34,144
- They're gone.
- What?

641
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:37,981
- Three men ran off. Giniven, Kelly...
- Why the hell didn't you stop them?

642
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:45,447
Where is he?

643
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:49,576
He's gotta be way up there,
in the cutting.

644
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:55,331
So much for Cavanagh's reward.

645
01:35:55,499 --> 01:36:01,171
That bastard's been sitting waiting
for two idiots to line up in his sights.

646
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:04,090
All right.

647
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:07,844
We'll do the last
thing Quigley expects.

648
01:36:40,085 --> 01:36:41,211
Come on.

649
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:04,734
He's cleared out.
Let's get back to the station.

650
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:24,587
Get up there.

651
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:48,778
Ya!

652
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:14,304
Ya!

653
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:40,997
I'm hurt, Quigley.
I'll do you no harm.

654
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:43,917
You throw that hogleg away. Easy.

655
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,430
On your feet.

656
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,543
Jesus!

657
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:41,933
Brophy, get 'round to the side there.
Make it harder for him. I'll cover you.

658
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:44,102
This rock's covering me fine.

659
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:48,898
Move, you gutless bloody wonder.

660
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:18,720
Close in on him.

661
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:50,793
Brophy!

662
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:28,164
I can bounce the next one
clean through ya. How brave are ya?

663
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,251
I'm coming out.

664
01:41:35,464 --> 01:41:37,090
That ain't real brave, but it is smart.

665
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:55,233
I got him! I got Quigley!

666
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:28,599
Got a gift for you, Mr. Marston.
Quigley, alive.

667
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:31,519
- Well, half alive.
- Good work, you two.

668
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:47,618
Well, well, well.

669
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:54,041
Mr. Quigley...
good of you to drop in again.

670
01:42:58,088 --> 01:43:01,007
What? Nothing clever to say?

671
01:43:05,929 --> 01:43:07,388
The great Quigley.

672
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:10,892
This is what you were all afraid of.

673
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:15,104
Bring him over here and stand him up.

674
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:27,116
Stand up.

675
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:30,703
Cut him loose.

676
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:46,344
Now put his rifle...
on the ground in front of him.

677
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:57,939
No.

678
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:01,692
Throw it away.

679
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:08,824
O'Flynn, go and get my second revolver.

680
01:44:10,994 --> 01:44:14,163
I know how much you'd like to have
your rifle with you, at this moment,

681
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:17,750
but I think you'll find that
I've got a much better idea.

682
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:24,257
Stick it in his belt. Go on!

683
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:35,142
I seem to remember you're not too
familiar with Colonel Colt's revolver,

684
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:38,437
so this will be your first lesson.

685
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:43,859
Don't worry. Mr. Dobkin and Mr. O'Flynn
will ensure that it's a fair contest.

686
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:53,828
I'll just back up a few paces.

687
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:00,501
And to your left a bit. That's it.

688
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:03,963
Now you're right in front
of my old pistol target.

689
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:11,804
Some men are born in the wrong century.

690
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:17,768
I think I was born
on the wrong continent.

691
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:23,357
Oh, by the way, you're fired.

692
01:45:41,209 --> 01:45:43,336
This ain't Dodge City.

693
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,589
And you ain't Bill Hickok.

694
01:46:34,763 --> 01:46:37,264
I said I never had much use for one.

695
01:46:37,432 --> 01:46:39,308
Never said I didn't know how to use it.

696
01:49:56,047 --> 01:49:58,173
Somewhat the worse for wear...

697
01:49:59,634 --> 01:50:01,719
This appears to be Quigley.

698
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:06,056
I think you have a lot to explain, sir.

699
01:50:06,224 --> 01:50:09,226
Not that it will do you
any good. Sergeant.

700
01:50:11,354 --> 01:50:15,149
In pursuance of a warrant,
duly attested by a justice of the peace,

701
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:20,362
you are hereby charged with numerous
and serious crimes, including murder...

702
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:24,408
In short, this paperwork says...

703
01:50:25,785 --> 01:50:27,161
...that we can hang you.

704
01:50:28,997 --> 01:50:31,040
I ain't gonna swing on no gallows.

705
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:34,543
Well.

706
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:39,673
You can always be shot...
on the way to your trial.

707
01:50:39,841 --> 01:50:42,551
While trying to escape, of course.

708
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:45,387
Or you can die right here,

709
01:50:45,555 --> 01:50:48,140
bearing arms against the army
of Her Majesty the Queen.

710
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:52,019
The decision...

711
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:07,047
All right, come on!

712
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:15,389
- When's the next boat leaving?
- For Europe or the Americas?

713
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:18,642
America.

714
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:23,188
Let's see here.

715
01:54:23,356 --> 01:54:28,360
I've got one leaving
this afternoon for San Francisco.

716
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,572
Mm-hmm.

717
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:33,699
Your name, sir?

718
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:52,551
Name?

719
01:54:55,013 --> 01:54:56,096
Roy.

720
01:54:58,725 --> 01:54:59,725
Roy Cobb.

721
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:10,736
How many?

722
01:55:12,322 --> 01:55:13,447
Two.

723
01:55:21,831 --> 01:55:24,082
I got something I wanna say to you.

724
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:27,628
I got a couple of things
I wanna say to you, too.

725
01:55:27,795 --> 01:55:32,507
Remember, once, you told me before you'd
make love to me I had to say two words?

726
01:55:32,675 --> 01:55:34,760
What's that?

727
01:55:35,678 --> 01:55:37,471
Matthew Quigley.

728
01:55:59,684 --> 01:56:03,438
