1
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:18,813
<i>Okay, Nick,</i>

2
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:20,897
<i>we're getting close to the end.</i>

3
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,105
But we're moving into a new section now,

4
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:25,397
what they call sentence interpretation.

5
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:26,897
Do you understand that?

6
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:32,272
You know what those...
what interpreting a sentence means?

7
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:34,938
No.

8
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,438
It's just a fancy word

9
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:40,480
for telling what the words mean to you.

10
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:41,855
- Okay.
- Okay.

11
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:42,938
And what these are,

12
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:45,897
these are common expressions that people

13
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,897
sometimes say.

14
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,105
You might hear it out on the street,

15
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:51,105
you might've seen it on TV,

16
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:52,647
uh, maybe a friend,

17
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,647
maybe your grandmother.

18
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:56,438
So, I'm going to read you
a few of those, okay?

19
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:57,647
- Okay.
- All right.

20
00:01:58,313 --> 00:01:59,272
Uh, the first one is,

21
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:02,522
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch."

22
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:05,063
What does that mean to you,
that expression?

23
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:07,647
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch?"

24
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:09,772
Don't count your chickens.

25
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:13,105
Okay.

26
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:18,605
What are you writing down?

27
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:21,897
Well, the reason I'm asking you
the questions is

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,105
because I'm supposed to write...

29
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:24,272
You know, write down the answers...

30
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:25,563
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.

31
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:26,772
Why are you writing that down?

32
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,980
So, in case I forget it later.

33
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:31,855
But I don't like people talking about me
after I go places.

34
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,272
I don't blame you. I'm not...
And I'm not talking about you.

35
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,147
This is just for me.
These are my own notes.

36
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:37,730
No one sees them but me.

37
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:39,313
I don't like it, but...

38
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:40,313
Uh, here's another one,

39
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:44,647
"It's the squeaky wheel
that gets the grease."

40
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:47,688
What does that expression mean to you?

41
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:56,022
You ever heard that before?

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,897
Nick?

43
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:03,980
Okay, Nick, you know what?

44
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:06,480
Why don't we skip this section
and just move on to the next one?

45
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:08,730
It's actually more fun. It's easier.

46
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,147
It's called word comparisons.

47
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,938
It's two words that
don't appear to be connected,

48
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:15,397
and then you say what
you think when you hear

49
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
the two words together. Okay?

50
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:18,563
Okay.

51
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:20,647
All right. First one is,

52
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,522
cat and mouse.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,688
What does that make you think?

54
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,105
They don't like each other.

55
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:29,480
That's right. They're kind of

56
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:31,688
enemies against each other, right?

57
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:33,105
That's what I said.

58
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:34,647
Okay, um...

59
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:41,313
How about scissors and a cooking pan?

60
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,855
You can hurt yourself with both.

61
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,647
Okay.

62
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,022
How about salt and water?

63
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:54,855
The beach.

64
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:56,313
The beach.

65
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:57,438
That's a good answer.

66
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:05,522
Um...

67
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,230
Do you mind, could we go back
to the scissors and the cooking pan?

68
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:10,230
Um...

69
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,105
When you said you can hurt yourself,

70
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:13,563
what were you... What did you mean?

71
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:15,647
Do you ever think about hurting yourself?

72
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,688
Why did you think of being hurt?

73
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:24,022
Because I touched the pan,
and I hurt my hand.

74
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:25,563
Oh, well, that makes perfect sense.

75
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:26,563
What happened?

76
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:31,980
Do you remember when it was?

77
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:39,980
Do you not want to talk about this?

78
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:44,688
I was sitting there and trying to eat.

79
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:47,313
And she started yelling at me,
and pushing me,

80
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:49,147
and just telling me I can't eat food.

81
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:50,772
That was your grandmother
who was saying that?

82
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,147
Yeah, and then she threw stuff at me.

83
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,688
- She threw things at you?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:55,897
Then I picked up the pan,
and I threw it at her.

85
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,772
You threw it at your grandmother?

86
00:04:57,855 --> 00:04:58,897
I threw it at the wall.

87
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:01,105
Oh, you weren't trying
to hit your grandmother?

88
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:10,813
Did you burn yourself
when you threw the pan?

89
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:16,105
Nick?

90
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:23,438
Nick, it's good that
we should talk about this.

91
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,105
This is good stuff
- we're talking about.

92
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:28,480
- Excuse me.
- You Peter?

93
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,147
Yes, I am. We're in the middle
of a session. Hello?

94
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,063
Nick, what are you doing?

95
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:32,272
We're in the middle
of something here.

96
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:33,355
- The middle of...
- Come on, get up!

97
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:34,647
- Hey, Nick, Nick...
- He's asking me about

98
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,730
the stuff, the pan,

99
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:36,813
- and the chicken.
- Wait, please!

100
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:38,605
How would you like it
if I made you cry, huh?

101
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,397
- Would you like that?
- No, I would not. But...

102
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,022
They told me I had to do this.

103
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:43,105
Get up. Let's go. Let's go!

104
00:05:43,188 --> 00:05:45,188
But he wrote... He has all my stuff!

105
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:47,063
Rip that shit up then!

106
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,397
This is my work.
This is my stuff, okay?

107
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,355
Oh, shame on you, Connie.

108
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:51,897
- Shame on me? Shame on you.
- You're not helping.

109
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,188
Shame on you!

110
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:54,480
- Come on.
- Janice, please,

111
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,313
could you send
Mark and Matthew right away?

112
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:12,230
Is that what you think you are?

113
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,730
What?

114
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,230
Jesus Christ.

115
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:27,022
I'm sorry. It's just that
Grandma said that...

116
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:28,688
I don't wanna hear about
Grandma anymore, all right?

117
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,105
Fuck Grandma, Nicky.

118
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,938
It's just you and me.
I'm your friend, all right?

119
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:41,855
I love you, all right?

120
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:08,688
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop messing with it.

121
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:10,188
Next?

122
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:07,480
What are you thinking about?

123
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:08,897
Nothing.

124
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:16,522
It's almost over.

125
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:56,480
Stay calm.

126
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,188
No, no. No running.

127
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:08,772
Hey.

128
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,813
- The mask.
- What about it?

129
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,730
The mask. I want to take it off.

130
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,688
- Huh?
- I want to take off the mask.

131
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:17,230
We'll take it off
in two minutes. Two minutes.

132
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:18,730
It's all finished now,
and everything's great.

133
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,188
Nick! Nick!

134
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,355
- Where?
- Down this alley.

135
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,772
Start taking your shit off.

136
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:37,563
It's not coming off.

137
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,355
It's not coming off.

138
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:41,730
Connie, help! Help! I can't breathe.

139
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:42,855
I can't breathe.

140
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:44,022
Remember how we did it?

141
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:45,313
Fingers under the flap and pull up.

142
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:46,980
Push it up. Push it up!

143
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,980
Push it up, push it up! Push it up!

144
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:52,980
You were fucking incredible.

145
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:54,855
You were incredible. Do you understand?

146
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,397
- Yeah.
- I'm serious.

147
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,563
You think I could have done it

148
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,480
without you standing
next to me, being strong?

149
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:00,605
No.

150
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:01,772
Are you feelin' this?

151
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:03,647
Are you feeling as good
as I'm feeling right now?

152
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,647
- Yeah, I'm cold.
- You're cold?

153
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,230
- Yeah.
- Hey, fuck it.

154
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:08,772
- Let's get to Virginia, man.
- All right.

155
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,063
What the fuck?

156
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:41,855
Nick! Nick! Come here.

157
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Stay with me.

158
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:44,563
Where'd he go?

159
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:45,813
Where are you?

160
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:46,938
Is he at the bank?

161
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:48,647
You circling around?
I'm on the corner.

162
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,772
I'm on the corner
where you dropped me off.

163
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:50,938
You gotta get back here right now.

164
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,188
I'm outside the Mango Rico.

165
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,147
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

166
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:58,605
He's here?

167
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:02,605
- Get in the car.
- Yeah.

168
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:10,563
I'm so sorry, dude. The cops,
they moved me here, they moved me there.

169
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,480
Don't worry about it.

170
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,563
Let's go.

171
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,397
Are we still going to the Port Authority?

172
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,022
Yes, nothing's changed, exact same place.

173
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:41,938
You wanna hold it?

174
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:44,438
Yeah. I don't care.

175
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,188
What was that sound?

176
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:02,397
What the fuck did you do?

177
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,397
My face. My face.

178
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,897
My face, my face. My face is burning.

179
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,313
- My face is burning.
- Your face isn't burning.

180
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:33,688
- My face is burning.
- Hey, look at me, look at me.

181
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:34,938
- Connie, my face is burning.
- Look at me.

182
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,355
Your face isn't burning.
You'll be all right.

183
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:37,480
Look, look, look.

184
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:38,605
My face.

185
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:41,188
- My face, Connie. My...
- Just breathe, just breathe.

186
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:43,813
- We going for a walk?
- No, no.

187
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:48,105
I think I'm gonna throw up.

188
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:50,938
You're not going
to fucking throw up. Come on.

189
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,272
I'm gonna throw up.

190
00:13:53,355 --> 00:13:54,563
No. What did I just tell you?

191
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:55,480
I don't know.

192
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:56,563
I told you you're not going to throw up,

193
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:58,022
so you're not going
to throw up, all right?

194
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,480
You're not.

195
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:03,147
Count to 30.

196
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,980
One, two, three...

197
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:07,397
Keep counting!

198
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:12,063
It's an emergency.
I gotta use the bathroom.

199
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:13,522
Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no.

200
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:15,522
Bathrooms
are for customers only.

201
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,772
Hey, customers only.

202
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:22,438
Hey.

203
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:23,522
Yes, I'm gonna get something.

204
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:24,730
Just give me five minutes.

205
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,230
No, no. Open up now!

206
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:28,272
Just wash that shit
off your face real quick.

207
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,480
Nick, what the fuck are you
doing? Get in the sink.

208
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:33,772
Jesus Christ.

209
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:35,897
- Put your hands up.
- Come out!

210
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:37,855
- Take it off.
- Yeah.

211
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:39,813
In five seconds,
I'll call the police!

212
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:41,730
Get off anything
with red or pink dye, okay?

213
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:43,313
My brother is mentally handicapped.

214
00:14:43,397 --> 00:14:46,272
A bucket of paint fell off a construction
truck and hit him on the head.

215
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:49,022
I'm gonna come out in one second.
It's an emergency, all right?

216
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,313
Please, just give me five minutes.

217
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:52,855
- It burns, it burns.
- Stop, stop it.

218
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:54,688
The pants got dye all over
them. Got to get them off.

219
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:55,772
I like these pants.

220
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,813
I don't care if you like them.
Gotta get them off right now.

221
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:01,022
You got sweatpants underneath.
That's why you wore them.

222
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:03,105
Hurry up. Lace them up.

223
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:04,188
Look for anything...

224
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:06,438
- Yes, yes, yes, please.
- Come out now!

225
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,688
Just keep your head down.

226
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:52,355
Gonna pull back up on us.
Just don't say anything, all right?

227
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:53,980
- Okay.
- Don't look at them.

228
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,230
Don't be scared.

229
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,355
- All right.
- Let me do all the talking.

230
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:02,938
Hey fellas, where we going?

231
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:04,355
Can I talk to you for a minute?

232
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:05,897
First of all, could you take
your hoodie off for me?

233
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,230
Why? What did we do wrong?

234
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:09,230
Hey. You with the black sweatshirt.

235
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:10,938
Yo, my man, turn around!

236
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:12,147
He's all right.
We didn't do anything wrong.

237
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,355
Yo, oh, oh! Get back here!

238
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:24,647
NYPD. Stop!

239
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,772
Nick, let's go!

240
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:56,063
Nick!

241
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980
Connie!

242
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:07,355
Stop! Stop!

243
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:08,605
You're under...

244
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:23,063
NYPD. You are not getting up.

245
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:24,897
Sir, I need you to get up!

246
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:31,230
Thanks for the welcome.

247
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:52,522
Yo, CO!

248
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,897
Let me talk to the fucking captain, man.

249
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,938
I've been here for four days!

250
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:58,772
- Get off the bars!
- Fuck!

251
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:06,897
Stop fighting!

252
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,688
Stop fighting! Get the captain.

253
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,480
Stop fighting.

254
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:15,855
Stop fighting or chemical bleach
will be utilized.

255
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:21,188
Stop fighting.

256
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,022
The judge is gonna ask her about Connie.

257
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:47,480
And if she says to the judge,
"I can't talk about that."

258
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:49,730
He's gonna say, "Then go away,
I'm not going to help Nick."

259
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:53,522
She needs to keep the judge
happy, answer his questions.

260
00:18:53,605 --> 00:18:55,855
She can't do that unless you answer

261
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:57,938
- her questions first.
- I don't like to. I don't want to.

262
00:18:58,022 --> 00:19:00,313
The point is, it doesn't
matter what you tell me.

263
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:01,397
It doesn't matter what you say.

264
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,313
It doesn't matter what we do
in this time together.

265
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:06,355
Nothing that you and I do here is going
to get your brother in trouble.

266
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,438
Why do you keep asking about him?

267
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,355
Because, you know what?

268
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,355
The thing is, is that I don't think
you're as responsible

269
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:13,355
for this as you believe that you are.

270
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,563
That money was for us.

271
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,313
And he was going to buy me a farm,

272
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:42,105
and we were gonna live in the woods.

273
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:43,980
And I was going to be able
to do whatever I wanted,

274
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,272
when I wanted, okay?

275
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:46,730
You don't love me, okay?

276
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:48,730
He loves me. Connie loves me!

277
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,647
- Talking all day on the phone, man.
- You don't know what love is!

278
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,730
Yo, son, can you please hurry up?

279
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:53,397
I don't want to talk to you no more! Okay?

280
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,522
That was for us.

281
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:55,897
- Hey, yo...
- He did it for us.

282
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,647
I'm talking to my grandmother, okay?

283
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,897
16,480. You need another ten grand.

284
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,605
You can't do anything with this?

285
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,063
This stuff is dirty. It's nasty.

286
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:25,522
You can't clean it?
You can't do nothing with it?

287
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:27,480
Nah, nah, nah. Come on. It's all garbage.

288
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,230
You get another ten grand,

289
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,022
I'll get the judge to sign the order.

290
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,313
And that's it.
I'll have the order waiting for you.

291
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:34,313
Your brother will get out.

292
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:36,688
Go get the ten grand.

293
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:50,772
We're gonna watch <i>Empire.</i>

294
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:52,230
What the fuck are you doing?

295
00:20:52,313 --> 00:20:53,980
I was watching this channel.
You can't do that.

296
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,397
I was watching something in it before.

297
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,105
You do not rock on this TV, man.

298
00:20:57,563 --> 00:20:58,397
Hey, yo, man.

299
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,438
If I was you, I wouldn't fuck with the TV.
Just leave it alone.

300
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:02,772
- Don't talk to me, all right.

301
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:04,022
I don't like you, all right?

302
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:05,313
- Don't talk to me.
- You got that green...

303
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,605
Nobody was in here before.

304
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,397
I'm allowed to watch whatever I want.

305
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,980
Yo, my man. Don't touch that TV!

306
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:11,438
- Man, this is some...

307
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,397
What the fuck is you doing, man?

308
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:17,522
Give me that shit.

309
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:19,272
Are you not entertained, huh?

310
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:20,813
Not entertained?

311
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:22,272
I told you I was gonna get you,

312
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:23,813
You bitch motherfucker!

313
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:14,063
<i>- I got it!
- No, no, I'm here.</i>

314
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,147
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- It's Connie.

315
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,938
<i>Con...</i>

316
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:19,730
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

317
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:22,855
<i>Ma... Mama, I called him down.</i>

318
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:24,980
<i>Wait a minute.
How'd you get in the building?</i>

319
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:26,938
<i>- I invited him up.
- They didn't call up.</i>

320
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:28,938
The doorman recognized me.

321
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:30,063
<i>He's not coming in here.</i>

322
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,438
<i>Yes, he is. Please.</i>

323
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:33,355
Well, I can just come back later, Loren.

324
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,480
Hey.

325
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,938
Connie, we're having dinner.

326
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,147
And I think

327
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,688
- if you could just...
- I... I can leave.

328
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:41,855
No, no, no.

329
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:44,105
- Go to my room.
- This is a very bad time for us.

330
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:46,355
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

331
00:22:46,438 --> 00:22:47,688
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

332
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:50,522
<i>How rude! I would never treat
one of your friends this way.</i>

333
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:52,105
<i>- Look at you!
- What?</i>

334
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:54,438
<i>- Yes.
- I'm begging you to shut your mouth!</i>

335
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:57,313
<i>- Shut my mouth?
- Please, please...</i>

336
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:00,897
<i>Would you just please go
look at yourself in the mirror?</i>

337
00:23:02,272 --> 00:23:04,647
<i>Just look at yourself.
This morning you were fine.</i>

338
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,230
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

339
00:23:06,313 --> 00:23:08,272
<i>I'm fine right now.
This is your problem.</i>

340
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:10,063
<i>Would you just do me a favor?</i>

341
00:23:10,147 --> 00:23:11,147
<i>- You know what?
- What?</i>

342
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,397
<i>Call Dr. Klienman.</i>

343
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,855
<i>Why don't you call him?</i>

344
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:15,730
<i>I have a friend over.</i>

345
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:17,980
<i>Mom, I want to stop this conversation.</i>

346
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,772
<i>- Yes, yes.
- I am stopping it!</i>

347
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:21,522
<i>- Yes.
- I'm zipping it!</i>

348
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:23,230
And I'm gonna go visit with my friend.

349
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:25,230
- Yes.
- You get a hold of yourself!

350
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:26,897
- Do that.
- Fucking freak!

351
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:32,147
Puerto Vallarta.

352
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:35,397
They have the best, best hotels.
I love it there.

353
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,605
There's a Grand Miramar Resort and Spa.

354
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:40,272
You can drink right in the pool.
It's like they have a whole bar.

355
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:43,647
Ah, fuck. The flight's too long.

356
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,063
It's like eight hours.

357
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:47,022
Okay, that's all right.

358
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:48,938
What about Florida?

359
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:50,563
Or hey, hey, hey.

360
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:53,230
- Can you just put it down for a second?
- Costa Rica.

361
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:55,855
Just put it down for a second. I gotta
come clean with you about something.

362
00:23:56,355 --> 00:23:57,272
What?

363
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,272
So, I told you about my brother, yeah?

364
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,272
Yeah.

365
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:06,438
I told you about the program he's forced
to attend and how he shouldn't be there.

366
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:07,355
Yeah.

367
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:08,980
And how everybody
involved with it doesn't know

368
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:10,938
what the fuck they're doing,
and he fucking hates it.

369
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:12,730
Hey, Costa Rica's
only four and a half hours...

370
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:14,480
Please, could you just put it
down for two seconds.

371
00:24:14,563 --> 00:24:16,230
Just listen to what I'm saying.

372
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:20,980
Look,

373
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:25,480
something happened,
I don't know exactly what.

374
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:26,980
But one of the therapists was abusing him,

375
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:30,230
and I guess he must have lashed out
violently, and he really hurt the guy.

376
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:35,313
Now this guy's
gonna press charges.

377
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:36,397
My brother's been arrested.

378
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,647
He's being held at Riker's Island.

379
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,688
Oh, my God, that's awful.

380
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:40,855
I know.

381
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,272
You have no idea.

382
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,938
I've just gotta get him out of there
before something bad happens.

383
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:50,063
See, he could get killed in there.

384
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:56,147
I'm just a little short
on the bail money right now.

385
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,855
How short?

386
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,813
It's like a few thousand.

387
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:02,772
Okay. That's not bad.

388
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,688
That's why I was just hoping your mom's
credit card could cover the rest of it.

389
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:10,813
Oh. Um...

390
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:16,022
Look, it's just to get him out of Riker's.
It's like a temporary loan.

391
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:17,480
You'd get it right back.

392
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:22,147
Any judge is gonna dismiss this
as soon as he gets to court.

393
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,855
Yeah.

394
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:26,188
Okay?

395
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:27,813
What, and our trip?

396
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:30,147
We'll go after?

397
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,522
Seriously, that's your response
to what I just told you?

398
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:36,563
That's your response?

399
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:41,022
Um, I mean, I'm thinking
about your brother, too.

400
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,022
Yo!

401
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,605
We gotta make a different stop.
It's still Queens. It's, uh...

402
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:48,938
82nd and Queens Boulevard.

403
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:50,522
It's near the Union Turnpike.

404
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,397
Eric, he's coming.

405
00:25:53,772 --> 00:25:54,688
What'd I tell ya?

406
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:55,855
Couple of hours, right?

407
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:57,688
Yeah. You got the full ten?

408
00:25:58,438 --> 00:25:59,355
10,000?

409
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:01,480
- $10,000.
- Yeah.

410
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:03,772
- You do credit, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

411
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,105
Wait. $10,000?

412
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,813
Yeah.

413
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:10,230
You said it was like
a couple thousand dollars.

414
00:26:10,313 --> 00:26:11,147
It's a loan.

415
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,772
You get it back the same time
as the three. What's the difference?

416
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:16,355
It's like $7,000 difference, you know.

417
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:19,563
It's for my brother. You're gonna get it
back the same day. Right? Right?

418
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:20,688
Yeah, yeah, she'll get it back.

419
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:21,688
You'll get it back.

420
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,647
Are we cool?

421
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:28,313
- It's for my brother.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

422
00:26:28,897 --> 00:26:29,813
It's fine. It's fine.

423
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:31,938
Can you put it through now?
I wanna get him out tonight.

424
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:34,730
Tonight? It's 8:35.

425
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:36,397
Judges go to dinner at 9:00.

426
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,813
So what? What's the problem?

427
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Can you not make a call?

428
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:41,022
They go to dinner.

429
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:43,272
It's only 20 minutes to do the bond,
prepare the paperwork...

430
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:44,272
- You got 20 minutes.

431
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:45,897
Can't you at least see what's possible?

432
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,605
- She's paying already.
- I got you. You're being pushy.

433
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:52,355
Thank you.

434
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:58,647
Hi, Bobby, how are you?

435
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:01,688
Yeah, I know, I know.

436
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:04,022
Sorry. I just have a client
that walked in.

437
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,647
Wanted me to post a bond now.

438
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:10,688
Yeah, can you just check, please?

439
00:27:13,522 --> 00:27:15,772
Last name N-I-K-A-S. Nikolas.

440
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:18,397
You think the judge will wait?

441
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:21,938
Come on, just ask.

442
00:27:22,647 --> 00:27:23,563
We good?

443
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:25,022
It's pretty late for this.

444
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:26,813
Sorry, it's taking longer.
The new system...

445
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,105
I know. Those chips are such a...

446
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,397
They're the bane of my existence.

447
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Ah...

448
00:27:33,188 --> 00:27:35,188
Hold on. He's not on...

449
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:36,605
He's not on the calendar for tonight.

450
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:37,813
What's the calendar?

451
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:40,022
Where is he?

452
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:42,105
Do you see anything there, any notations?

453
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:44,605
He's at Elmhurst.

454
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:46,063
Lovely.

455
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:47,480
- Elmhurst.
- Elmhurst, the hospital?

456
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,980
Yeah, like where sick people go.

457
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:51,188
What's... What's wrong with him?

458
00:27:51,688 --> 00:27:53,230
They're not gonna tell us.
It's privileged information.

459
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:55,230
- Does this mean we're not going?
- He's not gonna be arraigned.

460
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:56,355
'cause they've got him in the hospital.

461
00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:57,397
Can we still go away?

462
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,647
Until he gets a medical clearance, they're
not going to put him on the calendar.

463
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,772
When's that going to be?

464
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,688
Bobby, give me a second.
Bear with me.

465
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:05,105
When did he
get put in the hospital?

466
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:06,147
Eric, the card is declined.

467
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,897
I think maybe you're punching it in wrong,
or something, 'cause I just used it.

468
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,105
What the fuck is wrong with your card?

469
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:14,188
I have no idea.

470
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:15,355
You can call the bank.

471
00:28:15,438 --> 00:28:16,438
I do wanna call them.

472
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,105
I will dial for you, and you do it.

473
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:20,813
Hold on, Bobby. What do you want to do?

474
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:22,230
Can you not call someone?

475
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:25,397
Give me a second. I'll call Corrections.
I'll see what I can find out.

476
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,522
I'm going to punch
the numbers, and then...

477
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,897
Fuck! It's my mom.

478
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:34,855
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

479
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:36,813
Hi, Mom.

480
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:39,980
Did you, um, cancel the card?

481
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:41,730
Did you can...

482
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,022
Do you want to talk to them?

483
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:45,480
Mom! Sorry, sorry.

484
00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:47,355
- Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Calm down.

485
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:48,438
No, no, no, of course, of course.

486
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:50,022
Mom, Mom, Mom, please listen to me.

487
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,897
I'm at a legitimate...

488
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,272
It's a bail bonds place.
So the thing is this...

489
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:55,355
- Mom, Mom, Mom.
- Hold on.

490
00:28:55,438 --> 00:28:58,022
- We get the money back! Mom.
- I'll call you back, Bobby.

491
00:28:59,022 --> 00:29:00,147
Chaos. Hold on a second.

492
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,480
Can you take that outside?

493
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:03,438
Sorry. Excuse me, sir.
It's a legitimate loan.

494
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:06,563
Okay. We've got ten minutes,
decide. What do you want to do?

495
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:09,313
Look. It's a fucking disaster. I didn't
know she was going to be like this.

496
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:11,397
I don't like people yelling in my office.

497
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,188
I understand, I understand. Just let me
get back the money from earlier,

498
00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:15,772
and I'll come back with the rest in full.

499
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:18,855
The money in my safe?
No, that stays in the safe.

500
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:21,688
You want to get your brother out,
you bring me the other ten grand.

501
00:29:22,272 --> 00:29:23,188
That's how it works.

502
00:29:23,272 --> 00:29:24,272
Come on, man.
Give me a break, please.

503
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:25,272
I'm giving you a break.

504
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,355
That money stays in the safe. That's mine.

505
00:29:28,855 --> 00:29:30,855
You get the other ten,
I'll get your brother out.

506
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,188
You are so good.

507
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,355
Please, this isn't your fault.

508
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:39,897
I just wanted to do
a good thing for somebody.

509
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,313
Hey, man, what's with all the cops?

510
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,147
What do you mean?

511
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,813
There's cops everywhere.

512
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:17,772
Cops outside my dad's room.

513
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:19,480
All right, what floor is he on?

514
00:31:20,272 --> 00:31:21,272
Five.

515
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:23,355
There's not supposed to be
any prisoners on five.

516
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:24,480
They're supposed to be on six.

517
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,147
Supposed to be on six?

518
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,855
That's unacceptable.

519
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:42,605
Excuse me.

520
00:31:42,688 --> 00:31:43,897
Where's the nearest bathroom?

521
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:45,397
Down the hall, to the left.

522
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,397
Thank you.

523
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:32,313
Hey.

524
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:34,730
Something just scared
the shit out of me, man.

525
00:32:35,563 --> 00:32:38,188
- What?
- I was sleeping with my dad down the hall.

526
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,272
Who's dying, so I'm already
half freaked out already.

527
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:45,647
And, uh, all the TV channels
started changing on their own.

528
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,022
When I get up, it stops.

529
00:32:47,105 --> 00:32:49,105
When I sit back down,
they all start changing again.

530
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:51,563
So I...

531
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,563
What the fuck is that?

532
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,480
I don't know what to tell you, man.

533
00:32:59,772 --> 00:33:03,647
Fuck, man. I'm think I'm losing my mind.
I've been here 48 hours straight.

534
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:06,272
Want something from the vending machine?

535
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:08,147
Nah, I'm good. Thank you.

536
00:33:20,938 --> 00:33:21,855
Hello?

537
00:33:31,355 --> 00:33:32,397
Hello?

538
00:34:13,063 --> 00:34:15,605
Going down to vending to get
some coffee. You want some?

539
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:17,897
<i>Yeah, get me a coffee.</i>

540
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:20,105
I'll see you in a sec.

541
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:46,188
Excuse me, ma'am.

542
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:48,813
Do you mind if I put my brother on first?

543
00:36:48,897 --> 00:36:50,813
It's so cold, and he doesn't
have a jacket or anything.

544
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,772
- Is that all right?
- You don't mind?

545
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:54,313
All right.

546
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,480
Thank you so much. God bless you.

547
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,980
Turn him
to the side. There you go.

548
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:02,855
All right.

549
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:04,272
Thank you.

550
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:06,897
Ready?

551
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,063
Hey, can we get on now?

552
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:09,355
Yeah, you guys can get on.

553
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,188
Just go in this way.

554
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:18,813
Okay.

555
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:21,772
There we go.

556
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:25,438
All right.

557
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:28,147
Push it. There you go.

558
00:38:03,188 --> 00:38:04,605
6180 Woodhaven.

559
00:38:04,688 --> 00:38:06,730
That's ours.
Close to the building, please.

560
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:07,813
Okay.

561
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:13,813
- Regal Garden.
- That's us. That's us.

562
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:30,647
220 Fourth Avenue.

563
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,980
Okay. Thank you so much.

564
00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:40,230
Excuse me.

565
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:42,522
- Good night.
- Thank you.

566
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:43,855
I hope you feel better.

567
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:45,355
You, too.

568
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:47,605
- Hope he does, too.
- Okay now...

569
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:50,022
Bring your feet up.

570
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:55,397
Hey, yo!

571
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,772
I only had three stops.
I didn't know about a fourth.

572
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:00,980
That's odd, man. I definitely called.

573
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,230
This dispatch be messing me up.

574
00:39:03,313 --> 00:39:05,480
It's all good.
We only live a few blocks from here.

575
00:39:05,855 --> 00:39:07,272
That's why I figured
you were leaving us last.

576
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:10,438
A few blocks. What, like two blocks?

577
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:14,313
Like a literal two blocks
or a "15 minutes" two blocks?

578
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,980
Two blocks. It's right there.

579
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,813
All right, I got you.

580
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:20,355
Thank you.

581
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,647
All right, say when.

582
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,147
Uh...

583
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:27,355
It's just down here on the right.

584
00:39:27,438 --> 00:39:29,063
It's the one with the driveway.

585
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:30,772
- You don't got to pull in.
- Oh, yeah?

586
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:31,938
I'll just push him from here.

587
00:39:37,772 --> 00:39:38,980
Perfect, thanks, man.

588
00:39:39,063 --> 00:39:39,980
Yep.

589
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:53,897
- Crystal?
- Hmm?

590
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:56,105
Look for me, do not open.

591
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:57,938
Who's this? I don't know.

592
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,188
Every second!

593
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:04,730
Can I help you?

594
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:05,813
Hey, what's up?

595
00:40:05,897 --> 00:40:07,897
Is there an older couple that lives here?

596
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:09,605
- Annie?
- I just got dropped off

597
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:10,980
- by the Access...
- Oh, Lord!

598
00:40:11,272 --> 00:40:12,730
What happened again?

599
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:14,188
Somebody at the door for you.

600
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,897
Who is it?

601
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,563
I don't know. Some white guy.

602
00:40:19,855 --> 00:40:20,938
Uh...

603
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:23,355
I'm hoping you recognize me
from the Access-A-Ride.

604
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:24,480
Yeah.

605
00:40:25,313 --> 00:40:27,605
The driver just dropped us
off on our house on 23rd,

606
00:40:27,688 --> 00:40:29,022
and I can't find my keys anywhere.

607
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:32,105
And my brother doesn't have
a jacket, and it's freezing.

608
00:40:32,938 --> 00:40:34,647
Is there any way I can use your phone?

609
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,897
Just for, like, two minutes?

610
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:37,688
That's okay. That's okay.

611
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,063
God bless you.

612
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,605
- God bless you.
- Come in.

613
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:43,105
It's so cold.

614
00:40:43,188 --> 00:40:44,105
It's freezing.

615
00:40:45,272 --> 00:40:46,105
All right.

616
00:40:55,563 --> 00:40:56,730
This is the phone, okay?

617
00:40:56,813 --> 00:40:58,730
If you use the phone, do not unplug.

618
00:40:58,813 --> 00:40:59,813
Okay.

619
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:01,230
The battery no good.

620
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,355
- It's messed up, okay?
- Okay.

621
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:07,938
Thank you.

622
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,647
Uh...

623
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,980
Oh, God damn it.

624
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:20,188
Mom, it's Connie. Nick and I
are locked out of the house,

625
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,897
and I don't have my keys
or my wallet or anything.

626
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:28,438
So we're gonna wait at
the Dunkin' Donuts until you get off work.

627
00:41:28,522 --> 00:41:32,813
But if you get this message,
can you call me back at...

628
00:41:32,897 --> 00:41:33,980
What's the number here?

629
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:36,647
- 917.
- 917.

630
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,647
- 718.
- 718.

631
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,480
- 63.
- 63.

632
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:42,813
- 17.
- 17.

633
00:41:43,563 --> 00:41:44,897
So, yeah, call me back if you get this

634
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,272
in the next, like, five minutes.

635
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:47,272
Okay.

636
00:41:51,438 --> 00:41:53,230
Um, can I just leave him here

637
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:55,022
for, like, ten minutes
while I go break a window?

638
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:56,022
Why?

639
00:41:56,105 --> 00:41:57,230
Why?

640
00:41:57,313 --> 00:41:59,188
- So I can get into my house.
- What window?

641
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:00,813
Uh, my window.

642
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:02,438
- My window! Not yours.
- Why did you not call

643
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:04,147
- a locksmith?
- Because I don't have

644
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,813
any money in my... I don't have my wallet.

645
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:06,938
I don't have any money either.

646
00:42:07,022 --> 00:42:08,438
No, no. I understand.

647
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,355
Um... Could I...

648
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:14,105
Could I borrow some clothes for him?
Because I...

649
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:16,022
How many hours does your mother work?

650
00:42:16,522 --> 00:42:17,938
Well, she gets off at,
like, 7:00, so she'll be back

651
00:42:18,022 --> 00:42:19,105
at, like, 7:30.

652
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:21,188
But... Um, I hoping she gets my message.

653
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,855
If you want, I can give you a room,
not you, for your brother.

654
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:26,522
You wait until your mother

655
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:28,688
- came back from work.
- Yeah?

656
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:29,688
Yeah.

657
00:42:30,022 --> 00:42:33,063
It's gonna be a long time. That's like,
seven hours. But is that okay?

658
00:42:33,147 --> 00:42:34,480
Let me show you the room.

659
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:36,522
Why, thank you so much. That's...

660
00:42:36,605 --> 00:42:38,397
Let me show you the room.

661
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:41,855
Come with me.

662
00:42:52,397 --> 00:42:56,272
But, sorry, the light doesn't work.
We have the TV, okay?

663
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:06,522
Okay. Leave him there.

664
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:08,063
Come with me.

665
00:43:15,438 --> 00:43:17,647
Come. I've been sitting on the couch,

666
00:43:18,938 --> 00:43:20,105
watching TV.

667
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:23,772
The remote doesn't work, okay? It's no
good. If you want to change the channel,

668
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:25,188
you go in the box, okay?

669
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,022
Okay, I can just sit here, it's fine.
Thank you so much.

670
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,063
Okay, okay, that's enough.

671
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,188
Crystal?

672
00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:30,605
Yes?

673
00:43:30,688 --> 00:43:31,980
Come on, baby.

674
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:39,938
Listen.

675
00:43:40,272 --> 00:43:41,563
- I have work tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.

676
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:43,772
I'm going to take my medicine
to sleep, okay?

677
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:44,772
Mm-hmm.

678
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:46,897
Put your phone down, Crystal!

679
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:49,438
Always giving me
problems with the phone!

680
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:51,647
Stop the phone, okay?

681
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,272
All the time you're doing that to me.
When I'm talking to you,

682
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:55,772
I don't want your eye in the phone.

683
00:43:55,855 --> 00:43:58,522
You have to watch me, eyes to eyes.

684
00:43:58,605 --> 00:43:59,605
Okay. Okay.

685
00:44:21,897 --> 00:44:23,605
Shit.

686
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,105
Um, I'm sorry,

687
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:45,022
I just need to look
for something really quickly.

688
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,147
Yeah, it's fine. Just don't, uh...
Just try not to wake him up.

689
00:44:55,938 --> 00:44:57,105
Um...

690
00:44:57,772 --> 00:44:58,938
What's that in your hair?

691
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,938
This? I found some hair dye
in your bathroom.

692
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:07,272
You dyed your hair?

693
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:11,563
Yeah.

694
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,272
Just kind of a weirdo.

695
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:19,355
I hope that's not the one
from the bottom of the cabinet.

696
00:45:21,272 --> 00:45:22,605
- Hold on a second.
- I don't know what color

697
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:24,272
- your hair is gonna turn out.
- I hope you don't mind.

698
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,688
I took your mom's phone in here.

699
00:45:25,772 --> 00:45:27,313
That's not my mom. That's my grandmother,

700
00:45:27,397 --> 00:45:28,980
and I don't care what you do
with that lady's phone.

701
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:30,563
As long as you don't bring it back...

702
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:33,272
Sorry, this is my mother.
I just need to take this.

703
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,272
Okay.

704
00:45:35,355 --> 00:45:36,480
Hey, I said hold on

705
00:45:36,563 --> 00:45:37,813
- for a second.
<i>- Hold on to what?</i>

706
00:45:37,897 --> 00:45:39,688
<i>You don't understand.
Everything's falling apart.</i>

707
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:40,855
No. Stop it.

708
00:45:41,147 --> 00:45:42,647
<i>Stop what? Where are you?</i>

709
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,438
- I'm with Nick right now.
<i>- What?</i>

710
00:45:44,938 --> 00:45:46,438
<i>Oh, great. So you got your brother back,</i>

711
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:47,730
<i>and now you don't need me?</i>

712
00:45:47,813 --> 00:45:50,188
No, just calm down, calm down.

713
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:51,730
There's no reason to worry.

714
00:45:51,813 --> 00:45:54,105
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.</i>

715
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:55,897
<i>- I just...</i>
- No, just hold on a second.

716
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,355
What I'm gonna need you to do,

717
00:45:57,438 --> 00:45:59,105
you get a cab and you come pick us up.

718
00:45:59,188 --> 00:46:00,772
<i>You don't understand.
I'm a prisoner here.</i>

719
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:04,022
<i>My mom got the doorman and told him
to call her if I try to leave.</i>

720
00:46:04,105 --> 00:46:05,397
What time does the doorman switch shifts?

721
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,272
<i>At 5:00 or 6:00.</i>

722
00:46:07,688 --> 00:46:10,897
Okay. At 5:00 a.m., you go
downstairs, get a car and come pick us up.

723
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,147
<i>Oh, I don't know, Connie.</i>

724
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,897
I'm sorry. I can't stay
on the phone much longer.

725
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,230
It's rude. It's not my phone.

726
00:46:15,313 --> 00:46:17,397
<i>It's rude? Whose phone is it?
Where are you?</i>

727
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,480
What's the address here?

728
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:20,980
220 Fourth Avenue.

729
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:22,772
<i>Connie, who is that?</i>

730
00:46:22,855 --> 00:46:24,688
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

731
00:46:24,772 --> 00:46:26,647
<i>Connie. Hello? Hello?</i>

732
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,647
I just sent you the address.
Did you get it?

733
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,563
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

734
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:33,188
Okay, so come pick us up
as soon as you can.

735
00:46:33,688 --> 00:46:34,855
I love you. See you in a bit.

736
00:46:35,855 --> 00:46:38,647
I thought I should let you know, my
grandmother told me not to talk to you.

737
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,563
- Hey.

738
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:41,397
I don't care
what she says anyways. But...

739
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,480
Would you mind just talking outside?

740
00:46:43,938 --> 00:46:45,438
I really don't want to wake him up.

741
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:46,605
Let's just go outside.

742
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,730
Just gonna make my brother something
to eat. You want something?

743
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,730
Uh...

744
00:47:01,897 --> 00:47:03,438
I wouldn't do that.

745
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,063
What is all this shit?

746
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,272
You're not really
gonna find anything.

747
00:47:08,355 --> 00:47:10,105
I have chicken nuggets in here actually.

748
00:47:10,938 --> 00:47:12,105
Um, that should be good.

749
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:13,272
Yeah.

750
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:28,313
How old are you?

751
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,105
Um, I'm 16.

752
00:47:31,188 --> 00:47:32,105
Sixteen?

753
00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:34,438
You look way older than that.

754
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,355
I know. I get that.

755
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:43,563
So what's up? You just stay up all night?

756
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:46,355
I go back in my room.

757
00:47:46,438 --> 00:47:50,938
Stay up, eat, watch movies, smoke.

758
00:47:51,688 --> 00:47:53,147
- Is that weed?
- Yeah.

759
00:47:56,855 --> 00:47:58,438
It has no effect on me. I'm immune to it.

760
00:48:01,272 --> 00:48:04,438
My boyfriend sells this shit for like $30.

761
00:48:05,438 --> 00:48:06,563
How old's your boyfriend?

762
00:48:07,022 --> 00:48:08,522
He's not my boyfriend. My ex.

763
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:12,313
- He's a drug dealer?
- Yeah.

764
00:48:13,813 --> 00:48:14,730
Where does he live?

765
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:17,813
Can't disclose that.

766
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:19,897
Oh, yeah? Why not?

767
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,105
'Cause it's gonna make his house hot.

768
00:48:22,188 --> 00:48:23,147
Can't do that to him.

769
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,147
What, from me?

770
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,313
From anybody.

771
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:30,188
Hmm.

772
00:48:32,105 --> 00:48:34,438
<i>We're out to a call
of a lady</i>

773
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:36,188
<i>that's threatening to commit suicide.</i>

774
00:48:36,938 --> 00:48:39,772
<i>The reportee on this is her husband,
who's at a different location.</i>

775
00:48:39,855 --> 00:48:41,647
<i>Apparently, she's armed herself</i>

776
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,272
<i>with a knife and has taken
some anti-depressant drugs.</i>

777
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:46,730
<i>This is our second time
out to this apartment today.</i>

778
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:50,605
<i>And it looks like she's still out front
in her car here.</i>

779
00:48:51,188 --> 00:48:52,230
<i>The red minivan.</i>

780
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,980
Shit.

781
00:48:59,897 --> 00:49:00,813
<i>Sharon. Stop it!</i>

782
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,438
Did he just try to kick her?

783
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:06,272
<i>- I want to help you.
- No, you don't!</i>

784
00:49:06,355 --> 00:49:08,355
<i>- You gotta help me. Yes, I do.
- He lied to me.</i>

785
00:49:08,438 --> 00:49:09,397
<i>I'm not lying to you.</i>

786
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,980
<i>Come on, we need you out here.
Come on, come on.</i>

787
00:49:12,897 --> 00:49:14,230
<i>- Give me that knife!</i>
- Oh!

788
00:49:14,313 --> 00:49:15,897
<i>Back off! Lady...</i>

789
00:49:17,772 --> 00:49:18,688
Jesus Christ.

790
00:49:19,397 --> 00:49:20,355
<i>Get your arm outta there.</i>

791
00:49:20,438 --> 00:49:21,272
<i>Bring it out.</i>

792
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:22,230
<i>We have the knife there.</i>

793
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:23,147
<i>Yeah. We're fine.</i>

794
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,147
- Oh, my God.
- You gotta change this.

795
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,813
I don't want to see them
justify this shit.

796
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:30,397
<i>She's fine. There's nothing we
can do. Just leave the knife there.</i>

797
00:49:34,563 --> 00:49:36,188
Oh, look at the doggy!

798
00:49:36,272 --> 00:49:37,647
<i>Authorities say
he was caught</i>

799
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,563
<i>breeding pit bulls for dog fighting
inside his home.</i>

800
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:42,022
That is messed up.
I really love dogs.

801
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:44,188
Like, one of my cousin's friends, Tiara,

802
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,647
she has this dog. His name is Blade.

803
00:49:48,313 --> 00:49:49,980
He's a Great Dane. Oh, my gosh!

804
00:49:51,105 --> 00:49:52,938
I think I was a dog in a previous life.

805
00:49:54,647 --> 00:49:55,730
In fact, I know I was.

806
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,772
It's why they love me so much.

807
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:02,605
<i>You're watching Time Warner

810

I don't want to, uh...</i>

823

<i>All because he treats
his brother so badly.</i>

00:51:19,355 --> 00:51:20,438
Fuck.

Yo, where the fuck am I, man?
You do this to my fucking face?

829
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:25,772
Shut the fuck up. Lower your voice.

830
00:51:25,855 --> 00:51:28,605
No. Back the fuck up, man.
Back the fuck up.

Yo, C, can you get some
painkillers, please?

839
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,230
You do this shit to me, bro?

840
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:46,147
Now! Now!

841
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,313
Did you do this shit to me?

842
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:49,938
Shut the fuck up. If you wake the
grandma, I swear to God I'll fuck you up.

843
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:51,063
What fucking grandma?

844
00:51:51,147 --> 00:51:52,647
You're in an old lady's
house in Rego Park.

845
00:51:52,897 --> 00:51:53,730
- Are you gonna stay quiet?

846
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:56,147
- How the fuck did I get here, bro?
- Calm down.

847
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,230
- Calm down.
- Fuck. All right.

848
00:51:57,313 --> 00:51:58,230
Get off. I'm calm.

849
00:51:58,313 --> 00:51:59,522

- All right.

850
00:51:59,605 --> 00:52:01,605
So get the fuck off.

851
00:52:03,522 --> 00:52:04,438
Thank you.

852
00:52:04,772 --> 00:52:06,522
- Yo, take these.
- What the fuck is that?

853
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:08,272
- What is it?
- Oxys.

854
00:52:08,355 --> 00:52:09,730
Take it. Take it.

855
00:52:09,813 --> 00:52:10,855
They'll make you feel better.

856
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:13,272
- Ah fuck man.
- Are you gonna stay calm?

857
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,522
Can you leave us alone, please?

858
00:52:15,605 --> 00:52:16,980
Dude, why do I have handcuffs on?

859
00:52:17,063 --> 00:52:17,980
Just go down to your room.

860
00:52:18,355 --> 00:52:19,813
Shut the door. Shut the door.

861
00:52:19,897 --> 00:52:21,022
Close the door!

862
00:52:21,522 --> 00:52:22,438
- Fuck!
- I swear to God,

863
00:52:22,813 --> 00:52:24,272
if you wake up the grandmother,

864
00:52:24,355 --> 00:52:26,188
- I'll fuck you up!
- Yeah, yeah. I heard you, bro.

865
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,022
- God damn it.
- Are you gonna stay calm?

866
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,522
Yeah, yeah, I'm calm.

867
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:31,688
Fuck.

868
00:52:31,938 --> 00:52:32,897
Christ, man.

869
00:52:44,355 --> 00:52:46,938
What the fuck is going on?
Why am I in handcuffs?

870
00:52:47,813 --> 00:52:49,480
You were handcuffed
to a stretcher in a hospital.

871
00:52:49,563 --> 00:52:50,772
I broke the wrong guy out.

872
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:51,813
- That's all I know.
- Hospital?

873
00:52:51,897 --> 00:52:52,730
Yeah.

874
00:52:52,813 --> 00:52:53,897
There was a cop outside your room.

875
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,022
- What?
- I fucked up.

876
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,938
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know what to tell you.

877
00:52:57,022 --> 00:52:59,105
There was a cop outside your
room and you're the wrong guy.

878
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:02,397
Well, what the fuck am I going to do?

879
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,022
You can do whatever
the fuck you want to do.

880
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:05,647
What you can't do is fuck my shit up.

881
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,355
Acting stupid and getting me
thrown out. Okay?

882
00:53:07,438 --> 00:53:08,938
All right, well listen.
Get me a phone, man.

883
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,688
- I gotta make phone calls.
- I don't have a fucking phone.

884
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:12,480
Well, go get one
from that fucking girl then.

885
00:53:59,813 --> 00:54:00,647
All right.

886
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:01,980
We need to go back to the hospital.

887
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:03,313
Is your brother okay?

888
00:54:03,855 --> 00:54:05,397
That's not my brother.
The hospital fucked up.

889
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,730
Who is that upstairs?

890
00:54:07,563 --> 00:54:08,605
I don't know who it is.

891
00:54:08,688 --> 00:54:10,230
The hospital fucked up. It's not my fault.

892
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,647
Does the car in the driveway work?
- Yeah.

893
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:13,730
Do you know where the keys are?

894
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:14,647
No.

895
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,188
Well, where could they be? Can we just go
and look for them quickly?

896
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,688
Hurry up, get some shit on
and go find the keys.

897
00:54:20,772 --> 00:54:21,772
Fuck, man.

898
00:54:21,855 --> 00:54:22,897
Don't be confused.

899
00:54:23,397 --> 00:54:24,563
It's just gonna make it worse for me.

900
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:32,813
Fuck.

901
00:54:46,897 --> 00:54:47,938
Yo, yo!

902
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:49,022
What?

903
00:54:49,105 --> 00:54:50,272
I'm leaving. You gotta leave too.

904
00:54:50,522 --> 00:54:51,980
- Let's go.
- Can I get a ride?

905
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:53,188
Yeah. Whatever.

906
00:54:53,272 --> 00:54:54,688
I gotta make a phone call, too, bro.

907
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,105
- Please.
- Fine, fine.

908
00:54:56,188 --> 00:54:57,272
Just don't say anything stupid
in front of her.

909
00:54:57,355 --> 00:54:58,355
I won't say nothing stupid.

910
00:54:58,438 --> 00:54:59,397
And clean that shit off your face.

911
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,022
What the fuck you think I'm doing here?

912
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:02,647
- You're gonna scare her.
- Get me that phone!

913
00:55:04,022 --> 00:55:05,063
Fuck, man.

914
00:55:33,272 --> 00:55:34,313
Oh, shit!

915
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,230
Oh, it's probably just some bullshit.

916
00:56:32,105 --> 00:56:33,022
Hey, Ron, it's me.

917
00:56:33,605 --> 00:56:35,855
Listen, I'll explain later.
Are you with Mom right now?

918
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:37,522
All right, listen.

919
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:39,563
Is there anybody else in the
room with you right now?

920
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,480
Oh, fuck.

921
00:56:41,563 --> 00:56:44,647
Listen, listen, when I get
off the phone with you, you gotta pretend

922
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,022
like you got off the phone with one
of your friends, all right?

923
00:56:47,105 --> 00:56:48,522
All right, it's really important.

924
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,147
I gotta call you back later
from a different phone.

925
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,188
I'll explain everything. All right?

926
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:53,563
All right, I love you, bro.

927
00:56:54,105 --> 00:56:55,022
Bye.

928
00:56:58,605 --> 00:57:00,730
Whoa, whoa. Why are we going back
to the hospital for?

929
00:57:01,272 --> 00:57:02,272
That's where you wanted to go.

930
00:57:02,355 --> 00:57:03,855
Are you fucking crazy?

931
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,397
All right.

932
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:22,230
I'm gonna drop you off
at that White Castle.

933
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,897
I gotta get something
for my brother, anyway.

934
00:57:41,563 --> 00:57:44,063
Yo, could you run in and get
a number 5, six-piece chicken thing?

935
00:57:44,147 --> 00:57:45,063
All right.

936
00:57:45,772 --> 00:57:46,855
Get me something too.

937
00:57:47,438 --> 00:57:48,272
I'm starving.

938
00:57:48,355 --> 00:57:50,022
Just a couple sliders, please.

939
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:53,147
Go ahead.

940
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:54,647
Give me my phone.

941
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,147
- Here.
- No, no, leave that in here.

942
00:57:57,938 --> 00:57:58,855
I wanna use it.

943
00:58:07,688 --> 00:58:08,522
All right, bro. She's gone.

944
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,397
Let's get the fuck out of
here! Let's fucking book it.

945
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,730
Driving around in a stolen car?

946
00:58:11,813 --> 00:58:12,730
Don't be a fucking idiot.

947
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,480
We're waiting for her here.

948
00:58:15,188 --> 00:58:17,147
Well, I guess I'm gonna stay
in the car, too, then, man.

949
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,772
Because you've seen how it is back there.

950
00:58:18,855 --> 00:58:19,813
All those fucking cops.

951
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:22,147
And there's fucking cops

952
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,188
at my house. I don't think
you understand, bro.

953
00:58:24,272 --> 00:58:26,188
I just got out of prison yesterday.

954
00:58:26,897 --> 00:58:28,105
I'm on fucking parole.

955
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:29,105
I'm fucked.

956
00:58:29,397 --> 00:58:30,730
I'm gonna end up back in jail.

957
00:58:30,813 --> 00:58:32,188
I am not going back to jail!

958
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,605
And these fucking pills aren't doing shit.

959
00:58:36,272 --> 00:58:40,938
Man, this is all a bunch
of fucking bullshit, man!

960
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:42,522
Shut the fuck up. I'm trying to think.

961
00:58:43,272 --> 00:58:44,188
Okay?

962
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:45,313
What'd you think I'm trynna do?

963
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:47,022
I'm trynna fucking figure out
my shit, too.

964
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:49,063
I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna do.

965
00:58:50,438 --> 00:58:53,022
I don't remember half the shit
that went on yesterday.

966
00:58:53,272 --> 00:58:55,355
I don't know if I ended up
in the hospital first.

967
00:58:55,605 --> 00:58:56,605
Or the precinct first.

968
00:58:56,688 --> 00:59:00,272
I don't know if they got my fingerprints.
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

969
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:03,980
And I don't remember half of it
'cause I was so goddamned fucked up!

970
00:59:06,105 --> 00:59:08,563
I remember being dropped off by a bus.

971
00:59:09,688 --> 00:59:11,605
The jail releases me, the bus drops me off

972
00:59:11,688 --> 00:59:13,647
right in front
of a liquor store on the corner.

973
00:59:14,147 --> 00:59:15,647
I mean, after doing two years in jail,

974
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,730
what the fuck do you think
is gonna happen, man?

975
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:19,897
I'm gonna want a fucking drink.

976
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,855
<i>Right away I'm getting a bottle of brandy.
And I'm already practically broke,</i>

977
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:25,772
<i>with the little money
that was left in my account.</i>

978
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:27,563
<i>So I call my boy, Caliph.</i>

979
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,480
Ray! What up?

980
00:59:28,563 --> 00:59:29,980
<i>He comes through with some more liquor.</i>

981
00:59:30,063 --> 00:59:31,188
Your boy's home, man.

982
00:59:31,272 --> 00:59:32,438
<i>And some sticks of Xanax.</i>

983
00:59:32,522 --> 00:59:33,522
My brother!

984
00:59:33,605 --> 00:59:35,563
<i>He takes some sticks.
I take some sticks.</i>

985
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:38,272
<i>And by now, we're all fucked up.</i>

986
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:40,897
<i>And I'm just feeling so good
that I don't even give a fuck.</i>

987
00:59:41,397 --> 00:59:43,688
So we both walk over
to his boy Trevor's house.

988
00:59:43,772 --> 00:59:45,313
<i>This guy who has this hustle going</i>

989
00:59:45,397 --> 00:59:48,897
<i>where he moves acid
for this guy in the Bronx</i>

990
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,105
<i>to this other guy in Long Island.</i>

991
00:59:50,188 --> 00:59:51,188
<i>But what they do is,</i>

992
00:59:51,272 --> 00:59:53,063
<i>they skim a couple of sheets off the top,</i>

993
00:59:53,147 --> 00:59:54,647
<i>you know, so they could have some money</i>

994
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,647
<i>on the side for themselves
before they make the delivery.</i>

995
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,272
Yo, Bells, Belvis,
how much was that?

996
01:00:00,688 --> 01:00:02,188
Yo, son, hook me up, son.

997
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:05,022
Finish her. You're a
three-minute man anyway.

998
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:07,105
Fuck, let me do my thing, man.

999
01:00:10,897 --> 01:00:12,022
<i>So I ride with him to Long Island,</i>

1000
01:00:12,105 --> 01:00:13,105
<i>and I'm thinking the whole time</i>

1001
01:00:13,188 --> 01:00:15,272
<i>this PO's gonna read me the riot act,</i>

1002
01:00:15,897 --> 01:00:17,980
<i>'cause I'm fucking up already,
but, I mean...</i>

1003
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:19,980
<i>I'm feeling so great, and I'm fucked up.</i>

1004
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:22,313
And I just don't give a fuck.
I'm celebrating.

1005
01:00:22,397 --> 01:00:23,522
I'm not gonna spill it.

1006
01:00:23,605 --> 01:00:25,272
Yo, how much is this shit worth?

1007
01:00:25,647 --> 01:00:27,438
<i>So I'm at the arcade with Trevor now.</i>

1008
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,313
<i>You know, we're doing
our thing, hustling acid.</i>

1009
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:32,063
<i>And, you know, we take over this place.</i>

1010
01:00:32,147 --> 01:00:33,605
Like it's our fucking office.

1011
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:35,980
<i>Once in a while someone will show up</i>

1012
01:00:36,355 --> 01:00:37,480
<i>and we'll make a sale, you know.</i>

1013
01:00:38,188 --> 01:00:39,772
<i>Make a sale here. Make a sale there.</i>

1014
01:00:39,855 --> 01:00:40,938
Twenty? You know...

1015
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:43,313
Take that shit
and get high, baby boy.

1016
01:00:43,397 --> 01:00:44,938
A little stronger than last time, I hope.

1017
01:00:45,605 --> 01:00:48,772
<i>But then, one of Trevor's friends,
this clown Donnie, walks in.</i>

1018
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,147
<i>And he's all fucked up.</i>

1019
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,438
<i>And he's talking about</i>

1020
01:00:52,522 --> 01:00:55,272
<i>how he just robbed some
Radio Shack down the street.</i>

1021
01:00:55,813 --> 01:00:56,855
Look, check this out.

1022
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:58,688
<i>At this point,</i>

1023
01:00:58,772 --> 01:00:59,897
the acid's kicking in for me,

1024
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:04,147
so I can't follow this shit.
I'm having a hard time

1025
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,438
following the story,

1026
01:01:05,522 --> 01:01:07,522
<i>and I'm starting
to freak out a little bit.</i>

1027
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:08,938
Bam! Right over his fucking head.

1028
01:01:09,022 --> 01:01:11,605
<i>And then, guess what happens?
The fucking cops show up.</i>

1029
01:01:11,897 --> 01:01:12,897
<i>And the next thing I know,</i>

1030
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,563
Trevor's grabbing me, and we just book it
into the parking lot.

1031
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:17,063
And I just remember thinking I could run

1032
01:01:17,147 --> 01:01:18,772
for, like, 20 miles straight.

1033
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:20,272
It's here, right here.

1034
01:01:21,855 --> 01:01:24,397
<i>So I'm following Trevor,
and it's fucking freezing.</i>

1035
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,105
<i>He leads us into Adventureland,
this amusement park.</i>

1036
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:29,605
<i>At this point, I have no idea
what the fuck is going on.</i>

1037
01:01:30,897 --> 01:01:32,438
<i>And then Donnie leads us into this ride,</i>

1038
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,313
<i>and they look for a place to hide their
shit, but it's fuckin' dark in there.</i>

1039
01:01:35,397 --> 01:01:36,730
I can't see shit.

1040
01:01:36,813 --> 01:01:38,313
All of a sudden, they get bagged,

1041
01:01:38,688 --> 01:01:40,147
I'm all by myself in the dark.

1042
01:01:40,605 --> 01:01:42,522
<i>And literally
the next thing I remember is,</i>

1043
01:01:42,605 --> 01:01:45,522
<i>I'm fucking running down
some random street.</i>

1044
01:01:46,105 --> 01:01:48,105
<i>And I just see a fucking cab.</i>

1045
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,230
<i>And I hail it, and I just get in.</i>

1046
01:01:50,938 --> 01:01:52,897
And this driver,
he just kept talking to me

1047
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,397
and talking to me, and
I'm fucking tripping balls.

1048
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,105
<i>"And I'm telling him," Please, please,</i>

1049
01:01:57,188 --> 01:01:59,813
<i>just give me some peace and quiet,
or I'm going to throw up."</i>

1050
01:01:59,897 --> 01:02:01,647
If you gonna throw up,
you give me my money now

1051
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:02,980
and you get out of this car.

1052
01:02:03,063 --> 01:02:04,147
<i>And I told the driver,</i>

1053
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:05,938
<i>"Don't worry.
I'm going to go in the house,"</i>

1054
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,397
<i>"I'll get the money from my bag."</i>

1055
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,605
I just got out of jail today, man.
I don't have shit.

1056
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:12,688
<i>As soon as he hears the word "jail,"
he fuckin' freaks.</i>

1057
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,813
<i>Talking about, "Oh, I'm not getting ripped
off by one of you punks again."</i>

1058
01:02:15,897 --> 01:02:18,022
- I am not getting fucked over!
<i>- And he just fucking</i>

1059
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:19,397
steps on the gas.

1060
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,605
And that was it. He just takes off.

1061
01:02:21,688 --> 01:02:24,438
I'm gonna pay you. My mother's
gonna pay you. She has money.

1062
01:02:24,522 --> 01:02:25,772
I'm going to the police, okay!

1063
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:28,647
<i>Man, I heard the word
"cops," and I lose it.</i>

1064
01:02:29,147 --> 01:02:30,563
<i>I gotta get the fuck out of here.</i>

1065
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,063
- Pull over. Fuck this.
- You are crazy!

1066
01:02:32,147 --> 01:02:33,813
I'm not going back to jail, man.

1067
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:36,688
I'm not going back to jail. God damn it!

1068
01:02:36,772 --> 01:02:39,480
<i>So I happen to get one of the doors opened
before he locked them all.</i>

1069
01:02:39,563 --> 01:02:41,438
<i>This guy's crazy. He's fucking driving.</i>

1070
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:44,772
<i>He's speeding down the road,
30, 40 miles an hour.</i>

1071
01:02:45,647 --> 01:02:47,980
<i>And I know we're getting
closer and closer to the precinct.</i>

1072
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,147
<i>I know where my local
precinct is. It's not far.</i>

1073
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,855
<i>And I am not going back to jail.</i>

1074
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:55,897
<i>So I just looked down
at the pavement and just jump.</i>

1075
01:02:58,147 --> 01:02:59,563
And now look at my fucking face!

1076
01:02:59,855 --> 01:03:01,730
I can't go walk around looking like this.

1077
01:03:04,022 --> 01:03:06,813
Yo. Yo, you listening to me?

1078
01:03:09,855 --> 01:03:10,938
Yo, you fucking hear me?

1079
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:13,938
Yo.

1080
01:03:15,813 --> 01:03:18,855
Fucking serious? Hello?

1081
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,980
Hello!

1082
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:23,855
Tell you what I think.

1083
01:03:24,605 --> 01:03:26,063
I'm gonna drive us out there right now,

1084
01:03:26,147 --> 01:03:27,813
gonna go through the ride,
and we split what we find.

1085
01:03:27,897 --> 01:03:28,897
All right?

1086
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,355
What, to Adventurers? Right now?

1087
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:31,355
Yes.

1088
01:03:35,188 --> 01:03:36,313
Are you fucking serious?

1089
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:38,772
I should be in a fucking bed
somewhere right now.

1090
01:03:38,855 --> 01:03:41,438
You have nowhere to go. You have no plan.

1091
01:03:41,522 --> 01:03:42,772
And she's coming right now.

1092
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:56,272
Did you see all the activity
outside the hospital when we drove past?

1093
01:03:56,647 --> 01:03:58,147
Yeah, the police?

1094
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:00,605
Yeah. So I called over there,
and there's been a police incident.

1095
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,480
They're not gonna discharge
anyone for an hour and a half.

1096
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:05,105
So what's going to happen
with your brother?

1097
01:04:05,188 --> 01:04:06,813
I don't know. It's fuckin' nightmare.

1098
01:04:06,897 --> 01:04:08,105
I'm kinda fucked.

1099
01:04:08,188 --> 01:04:09,730
So I want to drop him off back at home,

1100
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:11,313
then come back to the hospital afterwards.

1101
01:04:13,772 --> 01:04:15,563
So I'm gonna drop you off
back at home, right?

1102
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,980
Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

1103
01:04:20,897 --> 01:04:22,355
Yeah, drive me home.

1104
01:05:10,522 --> 01:05:11,522
Where am I going?

1105
01:05:11,605 --> 01:05:12,688
Yeah, just right up here.

1106
01:05:12,772 --> 01:05:14,230
Just pull up around back right here.

1107
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:17,147
Right here?

1108
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,230
Pull up around back.
I don't wanna go around front

1109
01:05:19,313 --> 01:05:21,022
because then the dogs
are going to start barking

1110
01:05:21,105 --> 01:05:22,813
and wake everybody up and stuff. So...

1111
01:05:30,647 --> 01:05:32,980
Get out for a second.
I need to talk to her.

1112
01:05:45,105 --> 01:05:47,063
You know what? Tonight,
it's fucked up as it is.

1113
01:05:47,147 --> 01:05:48,272
I just think...

1114
01:05:50,897 --> 01:05:52,980
I think something
very important is happening,

1115
01:05:53,063 --> 01:05:54,897
and it's deeply connected to my purpose.

1116
01:05:55,438 --> 01:05:58,147
And I think that
you are somehow connected to it as well.

1117
01:06:01,022 --> 01:06:03,438
I mean, do you feel me at all?
Or do I just sound like a total faggot?

1118
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,688
No, I feel you. I understand.

1119
01:06:09,688 --> 01:06:12,313
Okay, I'm gonna go take a shit
in that guy's house.

1120
01:06:12,938 --> 01:06:14,605
And we'll try the hospital
again in a minute.

1121
01:06:15,313 --> 01:06:17,147
- Just wait here for me, okay?
- All right.

1122
01:06:30,105 --> 01:06:31,438
We can cut right through here.

1123
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:53,647
Ow. Fuck. Ow!

1124
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:55,772
Ow, my fucking shoulder!

1125
01:06:56,563 --> 01:06:58,563
Power with your legs. Don't use your arms.

1126
01:06:58,897 --> 01:07:01,855
- Oh, fuck. Shit, man.
- Shut the fuck up!

1127
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:03,230
I can't do it, man.

1128
01:07:03,313 --> 01:07:04,980
Tell me where it is. I'll be right back.

1129
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,022
I'm not telling you where it is.

1130
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,022
You can wait by the car.

1131
01:07:07,438 --> 01:07:08,522
That's my ride as well as yours.

1132
01:07:08,605 --> 01:07:10,980
No, no, no way. We find another way
around or something.

1133
01:07:11,063 --> 01:07:12,605
If I have to come back over there,

1134
01:07:12,855 --> 01:07:14,230
I'm gonna kick the living shit out of you.

1135
01:07:14,647 --> 01:07:18,105
You keep pushing me, bro, and I'm gonna
forget how fucked up my shoulder is.

1136
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:19,563
Motherfucker.

1137
01:07:29,688 --> 01:07:30,813
You gotta help me over, bro.

1138
01:07:32,688 --> 01:07:33,730
Come on.

1139
01:07:33,813 --> 01:07:35,063
Just boost me up.

1140
01:07:35,855 --> 01:07:36,772
Go.

1141
01:07:37,813 --> 01:07:38,897
There we go.

1142
01:07:39,813 --> 01:07:40,730
Go.

1143
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:45,855
I'm good.

1144
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:47,647
Oh!

1145
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,605
Fuck me, bro!

1146
01:07:51,063 --> 01:07:52,688
Oh, shit!

1147
01:07:53,272 --> 01:07:54,188
Fuck!

1148
01:07:56,313 --> 01:07:57,313
Here we go.

1149
01:08:21,147 --> 01:08:22,938
All right, you feel
this track right here?

1150
01:08:23,022 --> 01:08:24,313
- Yes.
- Follow it.

1151
01:08:26,355 --> 01:08:27,272
Um...

1152
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:29,355
Yo, check this coffin.

1153
01:08:32,022 --> 01:08:32,938
Where?

1154
01:08:33,188 --> 01:08:34,647
Everywhere. Behind it, under it.

1155
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:40,438
- There's nothing here, man.
- Try lifting the lid up.

1156
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:43,688
This is fucking bolted down.

1157
01:08:44,272 --> 01:08:45,813
Look, I'm not gonna spend
all night looking through

1158
01:08:45,897 --> 01:08:47,272
everything thing in
here, so think harder.

1159
01:08:47,355 --> 01:08:48,688
All right. I'm trying to fucking think!

1160
01:08:48,772 --> 01:08:50,272
It was fucking dark, like it is now.

1161
01:08:51,522 --> 01:08:53,230
It's gotta be farther, let's go father.
Come on.

1162
01:08:53,605 --> 01:08:54,522
Fuck.

1163
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,772
All Right. Got it.

1164
01:09:02,563 --> 01:09:03,647
This Egyptian shit.

1165
01:09:04,688 --> 01:09:06,605
I don't know. Maybe this tombstone, man.

1166
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,772
I think they stashed it here.

1167
01:09:14,313 --> 01:09:16,230
- Oh, shit!
- You got it?

1168
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,480
Yes! Nah, I found the fucking acid.

1169
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,355
I don't care about the acid.

1170
01:09:21,438 --> 01:09:22,397
Are you fucking stupid?

1171
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,647
You know how much this is worth?

1172
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:24,647
Find the money.

1173
01:09:27,022 --> 01:09:28,188
Do you recognize any of this?

1174
01:09:28,272 --> 01:09:30,063
I told you, man.
I was fucked up.

1175
01:09:30,147 --> 01:09:32,272
The cops came in quick.

1176
01:09:32,355 --> 01:09:33,272
- Oh, shit!
- Hey!

1177
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:39,897
Y'all need to come out.

1178
01:09:42,397 --> 01:09:43,772
Stop fucking with me right now.

1179
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:46,272
I already called the cops.

1180
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,147
Yo!

1181
01:09:54,397 --> 01:09:55,313
Stop playin'.

1182
01:09:56,355 --> 01:09:57,980
Y'all need to come out right now.

1183
01:10:04,563 --> 01:10:05,688
If I find you,

1184
01:10:06,563 --> 01:10:07,772
you gonna get your assed kicked.

1185
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:22,438
I'm not fucking around.

1186
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:25,230
Show your face.

1187
01:10:31,688 --> 01:10:32,605
Hey!

1188
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:34,980
Oh, fuck!

1189
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:38,813
Shit. Fuck! Ow!

1190
01:10:40,063 --> 01:10:41,647
Hey! Calm down!

1191
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,105
Hey!

1192
01:10:43,188 --> 01:10:45,063
- Ow. Fuck!
- Hey!

1193
01:10:45,313 --> 01:10:48,605
I got beat up!
I'm the victim here, man.

1194
01:10:51,147 --> 01:10:52,480
Oh, shit.

1195
01:10:53,605 --> 01:10:54,605
Where's your friend?

1196
01:10:54,688 --> 01:10:57,563
- I don't got no friend.
- I saw you on the monitor!

1197
01:10:57,647 --> 01:10:59,397
There's cameras here, okay?

1198
01:11:00,272 --> 01:11:02,480
I got beat up. I'm the victim.
Look at me, man.

1199
01:11:02,563 --> 01:11:04,022
Oh, come on, bro.

1200
01:11:04,105 --> 01:11:05,980
I'm gonna show
your friend now, huh?

1201
01:11:06,063 --> 01:11:07,522
I'm not trying
to give you no problems, man.

1202
01:11:07,605 --> 01:11:08,605
All right.

1203
01:11:08,688 --> 01:11:09,980
Let's wait for your boy to come out.

1204
01:11:10,063 --> 01:11:11,605
Just let me go. You will never see

1205
01:11:11,688 --> 01:11:12,855
my face again, I promise.

1206
01:11:12,938 --> 01:11:14,272
Let's wait for your boy to come out now.

1207
01:11:14,355 --> 01:11:15,938
Please, man. Come on, bro.

1208
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,230
Shut the fuck up.

1209
01:11:24,022 --> 01:11:25,022
There he goes.

1210
01:11:30,522 --> 01:11:31,522
Hey!

1211
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:33,147
Hey!

1212
01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:35,522
Yo!

1213
01:11:47,272 --> 01:11:48,355
Oh, shit!

1214
01:11:49,022 --> 01:11:50,480
Come on! Come on!

1215
01:11:50,938 --> 01:11:52,563
Get me the fuck outta here!

1216
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:55,188
Yo! Yo!

1217
01:11:55,272 --> 01:11:56,188
Open the door!

1218
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,397
Yo, cut me the fuck out of these things,
man. There's got to be scissors somewhere.

1219
01:12:07,605 --> 01:12:08,688
Let me see those things.

1220
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:10,688
Shit.

1221
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:16,813
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1222
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,480
All right, let's leave him here.

1223
01:12:37,855 --> 01:12:38,772
Keep looking.

1224
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,105
Go find it.

1225
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:41,438
I want to be in and out of here.

1226
01:12:41,772 --> 01:12:42,980
Damn you fucked him up.

1227
01:12:43,063 --> 01:12:44,688
I want to be in and out,
all right? In and out!

1228
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:50,063
Yo, does any of this
black light shit ring a bell?

1229
01:12:50,397 --> 01:12:51,355
I don't know, man.

1230
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:54,772
Just look around. Look under shit.
Look behind shit, like I'm doing.

1231
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,938
The cops came in.
They stashed it really quick, man.

1232
01:13:00,438 --> 01:13:02,022
- What about the boat thing?
- The what?

1233
01:13:02,105 --> 01:13:04,480
The boat. Did you look through the boat?

1234
01:13:04,563 --> 01:13:05,772
Nah, not yet.

1235
01:13:25,647 --> 01:13:26,730
<i>Hello!</i>

1236
01:13:29,688 --> 01:13:32,563
<i>Hello! Nassau County Police.
Anybody in there?</i>

1237
01:13:34,897 --> 01:13:36,855
Fuck! Fuck!

1238
01:13:46,605 --> 01:13:48,063
<i>Nassau County Police!</i>

1239
01:13:51,397 --> 01:13:52,980
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1240
01:13:54,105 --> 01:13:55,063
Shit, man.

1241
01:13:55,147 --> 01:13:56,063
Take his shoes off!

1242
01:14:16,105 --> 01:14:18,438
Go look for a hiding spot.
Don't leave the ride.

1243
01:14:18,522 --> 01:14:19,438
Hold on, hold on.

1244
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:22,480
This motherfucker's not gonna remember
shit when he wakes up.

1245
01:14:23,022 --> 01:14:23,938
Open the fucking mouth.

1246
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:45,147
Oh, there you are.

1247
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,438
What happened?
We were yelling at the gate.

1248
01:14:46,522 --> 01:14:47,647
Sorry, man, I couldn't hear anything.

1249
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,772
He's inside here.

1250
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:53,855
Watch out for the rail.

1251
01:14:57,313 --> 01:14:58,647
- He's just here.
- Oh, shit.

1252
01:14:59,438 --> 01:15:00,355
What happened to him?

1253
01:15:00,772 --> 01:15:03,188
I don't know.
I just heard a ton of noise outside.

1254
01:15:03,272 --> 01:15:06,230
I walked in here, and he's layin'
like this. Unconscious, I guess.

1255
01:15:06,313 --> 01:15:07,230
What happened to the other one?

1256
01:15:08,355 --> 01:15:09,397
The other one just...

1257
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,980
As soon as I turned the lights on,
everybody ran off.

1258
01:15:12,355 --> 01:15:13,522
Is he still in the park?

1259
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,397
Maybe. I don't know.

1260
01:15:16,188 --> 01:15:18,563
I'm gonna need you to turn all the lights
on in the park.

1261
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:20,438
Uh... Yeah, just give me
a couple of minutes.

1262
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:38,813
Hold on.

1263
01:15:38,897 --> 01:15:40,605
Let me call you back, hold on.

1264
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:42,063
'Cause I just peeped something.

1265
01:16:00,147 --> 01:16:01,063
Yo, yo, yo.

1266
01:16:01,772 --> 01:16:04,355
Stop! Stop! Turn around.

1267
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:05,563
Turn around.

1268
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,730
Nice strong pulse.
He has a good chest rise.

1269
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:16,147
Give him a bit of oxygen.

1270
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:18,855
Those lacs are pretty nasty
on his forehead though.

1271
01:16:19,272 --> 01:16:22,397
Hey, bud. Hey. Hey.
What's going on, man? Hey.

1272
01:16:22,813 --> 01:16:25,563
You awake? Hello. Hello.

1273
01:16:27,897 --> 01:16:30,438
He's a little agitated.
Hold on. Hold on to him.

1274
01:16:31,647 --> 01:16:32,522
Hey, man, it's all right.

1275
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:35,063
It's all right. Relax. Relax. Relax.

1276
01:16:37,188 --> 01:16:38,813
There goes that drug use, huh?

1277
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,397
Just hold on to his legs.

1278
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,438
Make sure you got his legs.

1279
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:45,730
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1280
01:16:45,813 --> 01:16:48,105
- I'm gonna cuff him.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's restrain him.

1281
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,688
Relax, you're gonna be all right.

1282
01:16:51,355 --> 01:16:53,605
Relax. All right, I got his arms.

1283
01:16:53,688 --> 01:16:54,605
You get under.

1284
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,772
Take your time. one, two, three.

1285
01:16:58,688 --> 01:17:01,355
All right, let's put him on a stretcher.

1286
01:17:05,938 --> 01:17:07,188
All right.

1287
01:17:07,272 --> 01:17:08,313
Get off of me!

1288
01:17:08,397 --> 01:17:09,647
Why are you still holding me, sir?

1289
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:10,647
Get off!

1290
01:17:12,022 --> 01:17:14,480
Get off! Get off of me!

1291
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:16,313
Wait, I just explained myself to you.

1292
01:17:16,397 --> 01:17:17,438
I didn't have to do that.

1293
01:17:17,522 --> 01:17:18,522
You're not making any sense.

1294
01:17:21,522 --> 01:17:22,480
This is the girl.

1295
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:26,980
Yo!

1296
01:17:28,313 --> 01:17:29,397
Is this the one that was running around?

1297
01:17:32,355 --> 01:17:33,730
Nah, it wasn't a girl, bro.

1298
01:17:35,105 --> 01:17:36,272
I don't know who that is.

1299
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,897
Look me at, don't look at him.

1300
01:17:38,147 --> 01:17:39,563
Look at me. How old are you?

1301
01:17:40,313 --> 01:17:41,563
- I'm 16.
- Where's your ID?

1302
01:17:42,397 --> 01:17:43,355
What are you doing here?

1303
01:17:43,855 --> 01:17:44,938
You don't know, and

1304
01:17:45,022 --> 01:17:46,855
you don't want to talk to me?
Come on. You're outta here.

1305
01:17:47,855 --> 01:17:49,230
I don't got time for this shit.

1306
01:17:51,897 --> 01:17:53,397
We'll find somebody that'll talk to us

1307
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,022
and tell you why you're here, all right?

1308
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,897
Get her outta here. I'll start her 61.

1309
01:18:09,397 --> 01:18:10,688
<i>Elmhurst, can I help you?</i>

1310
01:18:10,772 --> 01:18:14,063
Yeah. I'm just looking for a patient
who's currently in the hospital.

1311
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:15,730
I'm just checking to see if he's okay.

1312
01:18:15,813 --> 01:18:16,772
<i>Name, please.</i>

1313
01:18:16,855 --> 01:18:18,313
Nikolas. Nikolas Nikas.

1314
01:18:18,897 --> 01:18:20,438
N-I-K-A-S.

1315
01:18:20,813 --> 01:18:23,397
<i>N-I-K-A-S.</i>

1316
01:18:23,772 --> 01:18:25,438
<i>Do you have a floor or wing or something?</i>

1317
01:18:25,522 --> 01:18:27,397
No. No, I don't know anything.

1318
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,647
<i>All right, please hold.</i>

1319
01:18:48,397 --> 01:18:49,313
<i>Hello?</i>

1320
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,855
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry.</i>

1321
01:18:50,938 --> 01:18:52,605
<i>I'm unable to release any information</i>

1322
01:18:52,688 --> 01:18:53,730
<i>regarding that inmate.</i>

1323
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:55,022
Why not? I'm a family member.

1324
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:59,813
<i>Like I said, I'm not allowed to release
or to disclose any information about...</i>

1325
01:19:09,063 --> 01:19:09,980
Yo!

1326
01:19:14,272 --> 01:19:15,647
- Yo!
- Yeah.

1327
01:19:16,522 --> 01:19:17,438
We're leavin'.

1328
01:19:18,272 --> 01:19:19,813
Yo, are we good, man? Are they gone?

1329
01:19:28,147 --> 01:19:29,147
Yo, wait up!

1330
01:20:02,272 --> 01:20:03,188
Let me in.

1331
01:20:03,897 --> 01:20:04,938
You have the acid?

1332
01:20:05,022 --> 01:20:05,938
Yeah.

1333
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,188
Get in the back.

1334
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,355
I gotta get to a fucking phone, man.

1335
01:20:16,438 --> 01:20:17,563
I gotta warn my family.

1336
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:19,147
If they call that fucking
stupid girl's number back...

1337
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,397
If she's with the cops,

1338
01:20:20,938 --> 01:20:21,897
then I'm fucked, bro.

1339
01:20:22,313 --> 01:20:23,897
They might trick my mom
into saying something stupid,

1340
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,563
like I... like I called her earlier.

1341
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:29,022
Fuck, man.

1342
01:20:29,105 --> 01:20:30,147
Lay down.

1343
01:20:31,147 --> 01:20:32,147
We're going to his house.

1344
01:20:32,772 --> 01:20:34,563
Lay down. Make yourself invisible.

1345
01:22:13,813 --> 01:22:15,563
- What apartment?
- 12B.

1346
01:22:29,813 --> 01:22:30,897
Hello?

1347
01:22:36,897 --> 01:22:37,813
Hello?

1348
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,272
Hey.

1349
01:23:03,355 --> 01:23:05,397
Come here.

1350
01:23:07,647 --> 01:23:08,980
Smell the coat. Smell the coal.

1351
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:10,522
Smell that. Go on.

1352
01:23:10,605 --> 01:23:11,855
You smell it? You smell it?

1353
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,438
Come here, come here.

1354
01:23:15,563 --> 01:23:16,522
Come on.

1355
01:23:36,522 --> 01:23:40,063
<i>getting $46 million
in funding for upgraded infrastructure.</i>

1356
01:23:44,313 --> 01:23:47,313
<i>35,000 feet of new sewers,
water mains, and sidewalks.</i>

1357
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,147
Shit, that's what I'm talking about.

1358
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,188
Man, this is a nice fucking place.

1359
01:23:53,272 --> 01:23:55,230
I wish I had a fucking place like this.

1360
01:24:05,605 --> 01:24:07,855
How much money can you get for this
right now, tonight?

1361
01:24:07,938 --> 01:24:08,772
What?

1362
01:24:08,855 --> 01:24:09,688
For the acid.

1363
01:24:09,772 --> 01:24:12,147
Who can you call to get some money
for this now, tonight?

1364
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:13,563
I want to move it right now.

1365
01:24:13,855 --> 01:24:16,230
That doesn't belong to me.
That belongs to my boy, Caliph.

1366
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:17,813
Then he can pay me for it.

1367
01:24:18,355 --> 01:24:20,605
Fuck that, man.
I'm the one who found it. Not you.

1368
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,188
You wouldn't have found
anything without me.

1369
01:24:22,438 --> 01:24:24,147
You were handcuffed
to a bed in a hospital.

1370
01:24:24,605 --> 01:24:27,230
What do you think I'm doing this for?
You think I'm doing this for charity?

1371
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:30,313
All right. You're right.
You got a point. I hear you.

1372
01:24:30,938 --> 01:24:32,480
Listen. My boy will hook you up.

1373
01:24:32,563 --> 01:24:33,855
He'll throw some money your way.

1374
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:36,522
My point is, it's not up to me.
I gotta call him, all right?

1375
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:38,563
- It's not up to me.
- You're right. It's not up to you.

1376
01:24:38,647 --> 01:24:41,105
So get on the phone
and call him right now.

1377
01:24:41,188 --> 01:24:42,438
Plug the phone in. Charge it.

1378
01:24:43,105 --> 01:24:44,105
And give me a minute.

1379
01:24:44,188 --> 01:24:45,230
It doesn't need to be charged.

1380
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:47,397
I wanna relax for a minute.
It's been a long fucking night.

1381
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,480
I don't give a fuck.

1382
01:24:48,563 --> 01:24:51,313
You gotta get on the phone, and
make sure it's plugged in the wall 'cause

1383
01:24:51,397 --> 01:24:53,063
- otherwise it doesn't work.
- Give me a minute, bro. Goddamn.

1384
01:24:59,605 --> 01:25:00,605
Call him now.

1385
01:25:04,313 --> 01:25:06,397
<i>A Bronx man is
facing animal cruelty charges.</i>

1386
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,938
<i>Officials say an anonymous tip
about emaciated dogs prompted</i>

1387
01:25:09,022 --> 01:25:11,105
<i>an investigation by law enforcement.</i>

1388
01:25:11,188 --> 01:25:12,647
<i>They will soon be available for adoption.</i>

1389
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:13,730
<i>Now an update</i>

1390
01:25:13,813 --> 01:25:15,563
<i>on last week's bank robbery in Flushing.</i>

1391
01:25:15,647 --> 01:25:16,730
<i>Authorities are still searching</i>

1392
01:25:16,813 --> 01:25:20,480
<i>for Constantine Nikas, suspected of
carrying out the robbery with his brother.</i>

1393
01:25:21,313 --> 01:25:22,647
<i>Nikolas Nikas was arrested near the scene</i>

1394
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:24,563
<i>after crashing through
a plate-glass window</i>

1395
01:25:24,647 --> 01:25:26,022
<i>at the New World Mall.</i>

1396
01:25:26,105 --> 01:25:27,813
<i>He's currently being held
at the Queens Detention Center</i>

1397
01:25:27,897 --> 01:25:29,438
<i>awaiting a court appearance.</i>

1398
01:25:29,522 --> 01:25:31,147
<i>Today the brothers'
grandmother is speaking out...</i>

1399
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:33,105
So how much time are you facing?

1400
01:25:33,938 --> 01:25:36,313
<i>She joins us now from Flushing
with the details.</i>

1401
01:25:39,605 --> 01:25:40,813
Come on, man, look at me.

1402
01:25:40,897 --> 01:25:42,355
<i>one exclusive, Agapia Nikas...</i>

1403
01:25:42,438 --> 01:25:44,397
I don't care. I don't give a fuck.

1404
01:25:45,147 --> 01:25:47,647
I know your situation
can't be worse than mine.

1405
01:25:48,813 --> 01:25:51,730
Everybody goes through shit.
I'm the last one to judge.

1406
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,855
<i>She blames him for
an altercation with Nikolas</i>

1407
01:25:54,938 --> 01:25:56,522
<i>that left her with a broken arm.</i>

1408
01:25:57,022 --> 01:25:58,522
You ever do time before?

1409
01:26:02,063 --> 01:26:03,272
Fucking kidding me?

1410
01:26:03,355 --> 01:26:04,772
Just asking you a question.

1411
01:26:06,813 --> 01:26:09,522
Why you gotta be such a fuckin'
little prick all the time, man?

1412
01:26:09,605 --> 01:26:10,605
Look at you. Look at you.

1413
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,772
You're drunk as shit,

1414
01:26:11,855 --> 01:26:12,772
and now you wanna get real with me?

1415
01:26:12,855 --> 01:26:15,188
- Don't fuckin flatter yourself, bro.
- Huh?

1416
01:26:15,897 --> 01:26:17,772
I'm not trying to get real with you.

1417
01:26:18,313 --> 01:26:20,397
- You know what? I'm fucking real.
- Fuck.

1418
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,438
I'm trying to talk to you,
all right?

1419
01:26:22,897 --> 01:26:24,397
Go fuck yourself, man.

1420
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,688
You think you're better than me.

1421
01:26:25,772 --> 01:26:26,938
I am better than you.

1422
01:26:27,022 --> 01:26:29,272
You're an ignorant fuck, bro.

1423
01:26:29,355 --> 01:26:31,772
No one's better than
any next man, all right?

1424
01:26:32,105 --> 01:26:33,397
You don't know me from Adam.

1425
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,397
The second you got here, you went to the
booze and you got fucked up. That's fine.

1426
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,730
- So the fuck what?
- So that's who...

1427
01:26:37,813 --> 01:26:39,272
That's just who you are. You're a fuckup.

1428
01:26:39,355 --> 01:26:41,438
That's it. I don't care.
Whatever. I don't give a shit.

1429
01:26:41,522 --> 01:26:43,022
You shouldn't give a shit.
Who gives a shit?

1430
01:26:43,105 --> 01:26:44,522
I... I definitely don't give a shit.

1431
01:26:44,605 --> 01:26:46,063
Look. Losers like you are incapable

1432
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:47,188
of taking care of themselves.

1433
01:26:47,272 --> 01:26:49,730
You're either leeching off
mommy or leeching off welfare

1434
01:26:49,813 --> 01:26:51,397
or living off the government in jail.

1435
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,688
That's you!

1436
01:26:53,105 --> 01:26:55,022
You don't know the first thing
about me, bro.

1437
01:26:55,105 --> 01:26:56,480
What's to know? What's to know?

1438
01:26:56,563 --> 01:26:58,688
You serve absolutely
no function whatsoever.

1439
01:26:58,772 --> 01:26:59,772
It's pathetic.

1440
01:26:59,855 --> 01:27:03,813
I probably made more money
in the last two years

1441
01:27:04,772 --> 01:27:06,980
than you did in
your whole fucking life, man.

1442
01:27:07,063 --> 01:27:07,938
Let's see, man, a couple

1443
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:11,397
of years from now, you ever seen me
driving by in my fucking Lambo.

1444
01:27:12,188 --> 01:27:14,772
You're gonna put your fuckin' foot
so far up your mouth, bro.

1445
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,938
You don't know what I'm
talking about at all.

1446
01:27:20,522 --> 01:27:22,063
'Bout fuckin' time.

1447
01:27:30,438 --> 01:27:31,355
Hello.

1448
01:27:33,522 --> 01:27:34,397
Hello.

1449
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,813
<i>Yo, it's Caliph. Buzz me up.</i>

1450
01:27:36,688 --> 01:27:37,855
All right. I'm buzzing you up now.

1451
01:27:45,688 --> 01:27:46,688
Yo, come on. Get in, man.

1452
01:27:46,772 --> 01:27:48,355
What the fuck happened
to your face, nigga?

1453
01:27:48,438 --> 01:27:50,688
- I told you it was fucked up.
- You didn't tell me it was like this.

1454
01:27:50,772 --> 01:27:51,855
It is. It is.

1455
01:27:52,188 --> 01:27:54,813
Aw, I can't even fuckin' look at you, man.
It's disgusting.

1456
01:27:54,897 --> 01:27:56,647
Then don't look at me.
I don't know what to tell you.

1457
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,063
Where's the bottle?

1458
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,813
It's in this room
with this fucker.

1459
01:27:59,897 --> 01:28:00,980
What are you whispering about?

1460
01:28:01,063 --> 01:28:02,772
Listen. Listen.
This guy's fuckin' shot up, all right?

1461
01:28:02,855 --> 01:28:04,522
I just want to get this shit over with.

1462
01:28:04,605 --> 01:28:05,605
Man, fuck this shit.

1463
01:28:07,647 --> 01:28:09,522
- Yo, what's up?
- Shut the door!

1464
01:28:09,605 --> 01:28:12,313
What the fuck! You didn't tell me
there was a fucking dog in there.

1465
01:28:12,397 --> 01:28:13,813
Fucking forgot about that, man.
That's my bad.

1466
01:28:13,897 --> 01:28:15,188
What the fuck!

1467
01:28:15,272 --> 01:28:16,772
How much did you bring?

1468
01:28:17,272 --> 01:28:18,522
Calm the fuck down.

1469
01:28:18,605 --> 01:28:20,272
How much did you bring?

1470
01:28:20,355 --> 01:28:23,438
I thought we were gonna talk about this
shit first, and then decide.

1471
01:28:23,522 --> 01:28:24,772
So you brought nothing.

1472
01:28:24,855 --> 01:28:26,772
I need to know what the fuck
I'm payin' for.

1473
01:28:26,855 --> 01:28:28,147
Is this guy serious?

1474
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:30,938
Yeah, I'm very serious.
I could've run with my own fucking car

1475
01:28:31,022 --> 01:28:32,605
and got the shit the other day myself.

1476
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:34,688
All right, both of you
get out. We're done.

1477
01:28:36,313 --> 01:28:39,188
Yo. Just give him whatever you got,
and let's get the fuck outta here.

1478
01:28:39,938 --> 01:28:42,938
I'm gonna go get $1,000 from the ATM
and bring it right back.

1479
01:28:43,022 --> 01:28:45,022
I want 15,000, not 1,000.

1480
01:28:45,105 --> 01:28:48,397
How am I gonna get 15,000 from an ATM,
you crazy motherfucker?

1481
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,105
This conversation's over.
You can leave now.

1482
01:28:50,188 --> 01:28:51,355
- Both of you.
- Don't give him shit.

1483
01:28:51,438 --> 01:28:52,605
How 'bout we do this?

1484
01:28:52,688 --> 01:28:54,480
I'll go to the ATM right now,

1485
01:28:54,855 --> 01:28:57,438
and I'm gonna take out $1,000 times three.

1486
01:28:57,522 --> 01:28:58,897
- Three Gs for you...
- No.

1487
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,063
From the ATM in 30 minutes.

1488
01:29:00,147 --> 01:29:01,313
No. Not good enough!

1489
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,938
All right. I'm gonna go
to the motherfuckin' bank.

1490
01:29:05,022 --> 01:29:06,438
It's gonna take me about three hours

1491
01:29:06,522 --> 01:29:08,355
to get you the 15 Gs.

1492
01:29:08,438 --> 01:29:10,188
You want to sit here and wait like a dick?

1493
01:29:10,272 --> 01:29:11,897
Yeah.

1494
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:13,980
Okay, great. Fine.

1495
01:29:15,313 --> 01:29:16,230
Great.

1496
01:29:17,105 --> 01:29:19,563
That guy's full of fuckin' shit.
He's an asshole.

1497
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:21,522
See what the fuck
I've been dealin' with all night?

1498
01:29:21,605 --> 01:29:22,772
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1499
01:29:22,855 --> 01:29:24,355
I'm gonna fuckin' go right now.

1500
01:29:24,438 --> 01:29:26,438
I'll be back at 9:30.

1501
01:29:27,438 --> 01:29:28,897
Keep your eye on him, all right?

1502
01:29:29,522 --> 01:29:30,647
I'm gonna go to the BX.

1503
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:31,897
I'm gonna get with Tasha.

1504
01:29:32,688 --> 01:29:33,772
And then I'll be back.

1505
01:29:33,855 --> 01:29:34,855
That's what I'm talking about.

1506
01:29:35,605 --> 01:29:36,605
Hold him the fuck down.

1507
01:29:37,022 --> 01:29:38,272
Yeah. I'll see you, all right?

1508
01:29:46,522 --> 01:29:48,647
Yo!

1509
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,397
Yo!

1510
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:57,147
What?

1511
01:30:00,188 --> 01:30:01,105
What are you doin'?

1512
01:30:05,313 --> 01:30:06,397
I told you. I'm done.

1513
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,022
He's coming back
with the money, bro.

1514
01:30:08,647 --> 01:30:09,813
Get off. I'm leaving.

1515
01:30:09,897 --> 01:30:11,522
No, we're waiting.
We're fucking waiting.

1516
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:12,730
Waiting for what?

1517
01:30:16,105 --> 01:30:16,980
We're fuckin' waiting!

1518
01:30:17,063 --> 01:30:19,605
I'm not letting you leave
with that fuckin' bottle, man.

1519
01:30:21,563 --> 01:30:23,105
Fuckin' let go of this shit.

1520
01:30:26,563 --> 01:30:28,313
Get off me! Fucking mutt!

1521
01:30:28,397 --> 01:30:29,772
Get the fuck off me!

1522
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,355
Shit! God damn it! Fuck!

1523
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:38,772
Shit.

1524
01:30:45,522 --> 01:30:48,022
Yo, it's me. Yo, you gotta get
back here right now.

1525
01:30:48,105 --> 01:30:49,522
You gotta get back here right fucking now.

1526
01:30:49,605 --> 01:30:50,480
Dude, he left! He left with it!

1527
01:30:50,563 --> 01:30:51,730
<i>What were you fucking thinking?</i>

1528
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:54,563
The fuckin' dog, man!
Listen, you just gotta come.

1529
01:30:54,647 --> 01:30:56,147
<i>They're swarming the fuckin' building.</i>

1530
01:30:56,605 --> 01:30:57,647
Hold on. Hold on.

1531
01:31:12,022 --> 01:31:13,688
Stop! Stop!

1532
01:31:20,105 --> 01:31:21,105
Stop!

1533
01:31:22,522 --> 01:31:23,730
Hey, yo!

1534
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:26,522
Stop!

1535
01:31:27,897 --> 01:31:29,605
Stop! You're under arrest.

1536
01:31:33,438 --> 01:31:35,147
Get the fuck down!

1537
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:36,355
Oh, shit!

1538
01:31:45,063 --> 01:31:46,438
He's getting bagged as we speak, man!

1539
01:31:46,522 --> 01:31:49,355
It's on a parking lot. In a puddle.
The Sprite bottle. You can't miss it.

1540
01:31:49,438 --> 01:31:51,438
It's right out front. You can't miss it.

1541
01:31:52,438 --> 01:31:54,813
I gotta go. I'll call you back.
You never talked to me. Bye.

1542
01:31:56,688 --> 01:31:57,605
Police Department!

1543
01:31:58,063 --> 01:32:00,272
Come out with your hands up!
Open the door.

1544
01:32:22,063 --> 01:32:24,397
Hey, keep an eye
on this crowd that's forming.

1545
01:32:31,397 --> 01:32:33,730
They're starting to set up
a perimeter for this.

1546
01:32:37,063 --> 01:32:38,438
He went out the window!
Window!

1547
01:32:38,897 --> 01:32:39,813
Look up!

1548
01:32:40,272 --> 01:32:41,813
All units!
He's on the building!

1549
01:32:47,647 --> 01:32:49,730
All units. Call it in now!

1550
01:34:56,397 --> 01:34:57,313
There he is.

1551
01:34:58,522 --> 01:34:59,730
Good to see you, Nick.

1552
01:35:00,772 --> 01:35:02,188
I'm really glad you're here.

1553
01:35:03,355 --> 01:35:07,063
And I gotta tell you, that is a very cool
haircut. You look really sharp.

1554
01:35:08,063 --> 01:35:10,522
Mrs. Nikas, it's so good to see you, too.

1555
01:35:10,605 --> 01:35:11,605
- Good to see you.
- Thank you for bringing

1556
01:35:11,688 --> 01:35:13,230
- Nick in. Thank you.
- Thank you very much

1557
01:35:13,313 --> 01:35:14,397
for everything.

1558
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,063
Okay. Listen, I want you to come with me.

1559
01:35:16,147 --> 01:35:17,397
I'm gonna take you someplace.

1560
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,480
I just enrolled you in
this really terrific class.

1561
01:35:19,563 --> 01:35:20,855
I'm gonna walk you there right now.

1562
01:35:20,938 --> 01:35:22,022
You are gonna love it.

1563
01:35:25,647 --> 01:35:27,938
You know, Nick, I have to tell you,
what Connie did.

1564
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:29,438
Connie did the right thing.

1565
01:35:29,522 --> 01:35:31,438
He did the really responsible thing.

1566
01:35:32,147 --> 01:35:35,063
And the best news is,
he's right where he belongs.

1567
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:36,897
And you're right where you belong.

1568
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:41,022
And I gotta tell you, this place where we
are now can be a lot of fun if you let it.

1569
01:35:41,105 --> 01:35:42,272
You know that, don't you?

1570
01:35:42,647 --> 01:35:45,605
Energy. Energy in my hands.

1571
01:35:45,688 --> 01:35:47,855
Energy. Energy in my foot.

1572
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:52,522
- Hi, Peter!
- Hi. Hi, Samantha. Hi.

1573
01:35:52,605 --> 01:35:54,105
Please excuse me for interrupting.

1574
01:35:54,188 --> 01:35:56,105
I just want everybody
to meet my friend Nick.

1575
01:35:56,605 --> 01:35:59,647
Nick, say hi to everybody.

1576
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:01,980
Hi, Nick!

1577
01:36:02,855 --> 01:36:04,188
That's Samantha. This is Aubrey.

1578
01:36:04,272 --> 01:36:05,772
- Hi.
- Aubrey conducts this class.

1579
01:36:05,855 --> 01:36:07,605
I've seen these classes. They're great.

1580
01:36:07,688 --> 01:36:09,272
I think you're gonna like it.
It's a lot of fun.

1581
01:36:09,355 --> 01:36:11,105
- I don't know nobody here though.
- No, you don't.

1582
01:36:11,188 --> 01:36:13,813
That's okay. There's a lot of people
that are new. You're not alone.

1583
01:36:13,897 --> 01:36:15,605
You're gonna have a good time.
I'll be out here.

1584
01:36:15,688 --> 01:36:17,522
I'm gonna be waiting.
I'm not leaving without you.

1585
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:18,438
- All right.

1586
01:36:18,522 --> 01:36:19,813
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to see you.

1587
01:36:19,897 --> 01:36:21,022
Bye, Peter!

1588
01:36:21,105 --> 01:36:22,105
Bye-bye, Samantha.

1589
01:36:22,188 --> 01:36:24,105
Nice to meet you.
Can I take your coat?

1590
01:36:26,063 --> 01:36:27,688
I've really had a long day.

1591
01:36:27,772 --> 01:36:29,522
Hey, guys, say hi to Nick one more time.

1592
01:36:29,605 --> 01:36:31,313
- Make him feel welcome.
- Hi, Nick.

1593
01:36:31,397 --> 01:36:33,730
Okay. Since Nick is here,

1594
01:36:33,813 --> 01:36:35,563
we're gonna get to know
each other a little bit more

1595
01:36:35,647 --> 01:36:37,397
and play something called Cross The Room.

1596
01:36:37,688 --> 01:36:40,897
So I'd love everyone to divide up
on one side of the room.

1597
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:42,105
Nick, this way, thank you.

1598
01:36:42,397 --> 01:36:44,438
Uh, Rodney, you can actually
get over here.

1599
01:36:44,522 --> 01:36:45,980
Backari next to Andrew.

1600
01:36:46,063 --> 01:36:46,980
Perfect.

1601
01:36:47,813 --> 01:36:50,272
Okay. I'm going to give you a prompt.

1602
01:36:51,063 --> 01:36:52,147
I'm gonna say,

1603
01:36:52,647 --> 01:36:54,688
"Cross the room if you like something."

1604
01:36:55,313 --> 01:36:57,855
"Cross the room
if you want to do something."

1605
01:36:57,938 --> 01:37:01,147
"Cross the room if you have
ever done something."

1606
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:05,313
And if you have or agree with those
prompts, you would cross the room.

1607
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:06,897
Now,

1608
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:09,522
you choose whether or not
you want to cross.

1609
01:37:10,063 --> 01:37:13,355
You don't have to.
It could be your secret.

1610
01:37:13,438 --> 01:37:15,563
You choose your truth. Okay?

1611
01:37:15,647 --> 01:37:16,647
Okay.

1612
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:18,022
So let's start with something easy.

1613
01:37:18,813 --> 01:37:23,272
Cross the room if you like candy.

1614
01:37:27,272 --> 01:37:30,855
Mikey and Michael don't like candy? Okay.

1615
01:37:30,938 --> 01:37:32,897
How about something harder?

1616
01:37:33,397 --> 01:37:36,230
Cross the room
if you've ever been in love.

1617
01:37:36,938 --> 01:37:39,272
- I think I have.
- You think you have?

1618
01:37:41,813 --> 01:37:42,730
Okay.

1619
01:37:43,063 --> 01:37:47,938
Cross the room if you have ever lied.

1620
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:58,897
Cross the room if you've ever not gotten
along with your family members sometimes.

1621
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:00,647
There was family problems.

1622
01:38:01,605 --> 01:38:04,438
Family drama. No family drama?

1623
01:38:06,272 --> 01:38:08,022
Does anybody have another suggestion?

1624
01:38:08,438 --> 01:38:09,522
- I do.
- Sure.

1625
01:38:09,605 --> 01:38:11,272
- Cross the room
- Oh, sorry, guys.

1626
01:38:11,355 --> 01:38:15,147
if you've ever been blamed for something
that you didn't do.

1627
01:38:15,938 --> 01:38:17,980
Oh, plenty of times.

1628
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:26,980
Cross the room if you've been to Radio
City Christmas at Rockefeller Center.

1629
01:38:35,063 --> 01:38:35,980
Travis?

1630
01:38:36,688 --> 01:38:43,105
Cross the room if you've ever
done anything stupid with your friends.

1631
01:38:43,188 --> 01:38:46,647
Cross the room if you've ever
done something stupid with your friends.

1632
01:38:49,938 --> 01:38:51,105
Mikey, do you have a suggestion?

1633
01:38:51,563 --> 01:38:53,813
Yeah, cross the room

1634
01:38:55,313 --> 01:39:01,397
if you have not been to Dream Street.

1635
01:39:02,022 --> 01:39:04,063
Cross the room if you've not been
to Dream Street.

1636
01:39:09,022 --> 01:39:11,313
- Samantha?
- Cross the room

1637
01:39:11,397 --> 01:39:15,438
if you'd really love to mentor
special Ed. nursery school.

1638
01:39:15,522 --> 01:39:17,188
Cross the room
if you've ever mentored

1639
01:39:17,272 --> 01:39:19,105
or want to mentor special needs children.

1640
01:39:19,188 --> 01:39:20,230
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1641
01:39:22,938 --> 01:39:24,980
Cross the room if you have a friend.

1642
01:39:32,522 --> 01:39:33,438
Megan?

1643
01:39:34,772 --> 01:39:37,480
Cross the room
if you've even been lonely.

1644
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:47,397
cross the room
if you like musicals.

1645
01:39:48,813 --> 01:39:49,813
Do an easy one.

1646
01:40:07,188 --> 01:40:12,272
Cross the room if you've ever felt
like you spend too much time at home.

1647
01:40:45,188 --> 01:40:51,730
<i>Someday, I swear we're gonna go to a
place where we can do everything we want.</i>

1648
01:40:53,105 --> 01:40:55,105
<i>And we can pet the crocodiles.</i>

1649
01:41:00,897 --> 01:41:02,313
<i>Love.</i>
