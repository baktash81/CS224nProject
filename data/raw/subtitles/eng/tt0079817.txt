1
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,002
Apollo is saying,
"Come on, come on, come on!"

2
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:50,389
Apollo is going left. He's going
for another left. Another left.

3
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:53,726
Now he's gone for the left.

4
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:58,606
Down on one knee. Lou Filippo
in there wiping off the glove.

5
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:06,314
A hard left
and a right combination.

6
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:09,992
What is keeping
him up, Bill? I don't know.

7
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:14,997
He can't even get his
gloves up to protect himself.

8
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:23,956
Down! Down! Stay down!

9
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:27,092
Apollo dancing around
with his arms in the air.

10
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:38,939
Five,

11
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,771
six, seven,

12
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:45,237
eight, nine...

13
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,745
Come on!

14
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:57,582
Apollo
can't believe it.

15
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,519
The champion got a left to
the ribs, his right ribs.

16
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,603
You okay, champ?

17
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:27,980
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm okay.

18
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,314
Your rib's broken.

19
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:30,566
He broke my ribs!

20
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,945
I can't see nothing. Gotta
open my eye. Cut me, Mick.

21
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:35,029
I don't want to do it!

22
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,573
Go on, cut me.

23
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:37,865
Cut me.

24
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,742
Okay.
Try and cut it.

25
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:42,245
You're bleeding inside, champ.
I'm gonna stop the fight.

26
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:46,207
Hey, you ain't stopping nothing,
man. You ain't stopping nothing.

27
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:48,084
You stop this fight,
I'll kill you!

28
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,961
All right.
I won't stop it.

29
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:51,629
I'm going!
You want to go...

30
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,256
Last round!

31
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:54,799
You gotta give it
your all!

32
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:57,518
Get it off! You gotta
get him down in the body.

33
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:06,194
There's the bell
for the 15th and final round.

34
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:13,944
You better start fighting. You been
doing nothing. You been doing nothing.

35
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:16,905
They look like they've
been in a war, these two.

36
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:18,248
Come on over here.

37
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:28,001
Apollo, the champion,
really tagged him.

38
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:31,554
And Apollo clearly protecting
his right side, his ribs.

39
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:34,883
Oh, look at that!

40
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,059
Body punches!

41
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,803
Hard left and right.

42
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:40,517
Oh, look at the blood
coming out of his mouth.

43
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:44,442
He's spitting up blood now.
He takes one to the head.

44
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:48,237
A tremendous
right hand from Rocky.

45
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:50,732
Go for it.
Go for it, Rock!

46
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:51,983
Listen
to this crowd!

47
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,234
Left to the ribs.

48
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:57,155
Another to the ribs. That left
hand again. A right to the chin!

49
00:03:57,255 --> 00:04:01,793
He's got him up against the
ropes! Apollo, the champion...

50
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:07,874
Ain't gonna be no rematch.
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

51
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:10,301
Don't want one.

52
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:20,596
There's chaos.

53
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:22,575
Rocky, you went the distance.
You went the 15 rounds.

54
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:23,818
How do you feel? All right. All right.

55
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:25,949
What were you thinking about
when that buzzer sounded off?

56
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,014
Adrian!
What did you think about

57
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:28,422
in the 15th round
when you were coming out?

58
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:29,647
Adrian!

59
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:32,741
Rocky. Rocky.

60
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:39,156
Rocky! Rocky!

61
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:43,786
We have had the privilege of
witnessing the greatest exhibition

62
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:47,873
of guts and stamina
in the history of the ring.

63
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:49,758
Adrian!

64
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:52,461
Rocky!

65
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:53,546
Ladies and gentlemen...

66
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:54,630
Rocky!

67
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,975
...we have a split decision.

68
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:02,304
Adrian!

69
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:05,232
Eight for Apollo Creed!
Rocky!

70
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:09,770
Those fans out
there deserve a rematch.

71
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,939
Ain't gonna be no rematch.
Come on!

72
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,902
I had enough things
in my face today! Adrian!

73
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:19,656
Rocko!
That's my friend. Rocko!

74
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:22,118
You're breaking my jacket.

75
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:23,911
Paulie!

76
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:25,079
Adrian!

77
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:26,164
Rocky!

78
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:27,248
Adrian!
Rocky!

79
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:28,875
Hey, where's your hat?

80
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,251
I love you!

81
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:31,677
I love you.

82
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:37,258
I love you!
I love you!

83
00:05:37,358 --> 00:05:39,185
I love you.

84
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,484
Hey, Rock!
Hey, Rocky!

85
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,771
Rocky Balboa!

86
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,649
Get them
out of here!

87
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:58,945
Let him breathe, will you? Give him air!

88
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,656
Sit down, Rocky.
Sit down.

89
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:02,983
Rocky, do you think you had it won?

90
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:03,909
I don't know. I...

91
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,077
How about
a statement, Rocky?

92
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:08,288
I don't know.
I'm at a loss for words.

93
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,581
Get back there!

94
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,928
Rocky,
do you think you had it won?

95
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,042
I don't know.

96
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,293
Rocky, stay!

97
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,544
Where's the doctor?

98
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,630
How's my nose look?
As bad as Mickey's?

99
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,757
It ain't that horrible.
Now give him a break.

100
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:20,258
Just one more.
Get out of there.

101
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:22,034
Rocky, is that the worst
beating you ever took?

102
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,274
You! No, you're gonna get worse
if you don't get out of here.

103
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:26,848
Rocky, what did you think
going into the last round?

104
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:29,559
I don't know. That I should have
stayed in school or something.

105
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,394
Rocky, do you think
you have brain damage?

106
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:32,479
I don't see any.

107
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,356
Where is he?
Where is he?

108
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:36,532
Apollo,
how about a statement?

109
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,829
Get away from me! How
about a statement, Apollo?

110
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:41,196
Hey, Stallion! Stallion!

111
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,114
You got a dull skull,
Stallion.

112
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:46,076
You're lucky, so lucky.
What you did was a miracle.

113
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:47,891
You're the luckiest man
on the face of the Earth.

114
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:49,072
I want you to
know that, Stallion.

115
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:50,247
Do I look lucky?

116
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,208
Look, nobody goes
the distance with me.

117
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:55,026
Get up out of that chair, chump, and
let's finish this fight right now.

118
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:56,268
Apollo, don't, please.
Sit down.

119
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,463
Is he serious?

120
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:59,443
Were you going down? Did
the bell save you, Apollo?

121
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:01,217
Bell nothing, man.
I can beat that chump.

122
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:02,885
I'll fight him
any place, any time.

123
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:04,314
Does that mean
there'll be a rematch?

124
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:06,806
I said any place, any
time, man. Can you hear?

125
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:09,600
Hey, yo, Apollo, you said there
weren't gonna be no rematch.

126
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,310
Look, chump,
any place, any time.

127
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,729
Rocky, a rematch
could be worth millions.

128
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,356
Well, I'm officially
retired now.

129
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:16,941
Don't you run out
on me now.

130
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,226
Don't you run out
on me, Stallion.

131
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:21,570
I gave you a shot the first time. Now
I'm ready to give you a second shot.

132
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,323
He sure has a lot of energy. You
know, you got nothing to prove.

133
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:28,661
I don't care what the hell them judges
said. This is the man that won the fight!

134
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:32,039
I'm gonna show you how lucky you are!
You're gonna fight me again, chump!

135
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,167
Come back here! Don't run out
on me! Come back here, Rock!

136
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:36,460
Yo, Adrian?
Yes.

137
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,629
You'd better go home
'cause I'm gonna be busy

138
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,715
healing here for a while,
you know.

139
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:42,342
I want to be here.

140
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:44,730
No, maybe you better go home
with Paulie and get some sleep...

141
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,981
Wait a minute.
Get some sleep, you know.

142
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:52,269
I love you.
I love you.

143
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,895
I love you. See you.

144
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,488
See you later.
See you, Mick.

145
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,862
Can you fix my nose?

146
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:04,073
I'm a little depressed
about my nose.

147
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:07,835
We'll fix that all right.
It's the eye that concerns me.

148
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:10,463
The eye's great.

149
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:14,842
I ain't never
really felt this good.

150
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,346
You guys should've
seen us tonight.

151
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:22,183
We did good.

152
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:26,520
I almost won, you know...
You should've seen it.

153
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:32,610
You had him in the 10th,
and in the 15th he was gone.

154
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,730
You think so?

155
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,031
Trust me.
I was there.

156
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,776
How's your face,
Rock?

157
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:40,410
I don't know.
How's it look?

158
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:43,497
I wouldn't want it.

159
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,709
Rocky, I got a little favor
I'd like to ask of you.

160
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:51,505
You know, your friend Gazzo,
he admires you a lot.

161
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:54,187
Tell him to give me
your old job with him.

162
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,918
You mean collecting?

163
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:57,104
Yeah, I'm good with numbers.

164
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:58,178
Yeah.

165
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,808
Okay. As soon as I get
finished, you know, healing here,

166
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:07,012
I'll tell him to give
you my old job, okay?

167
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:08,263
I'd appreciate that.

168
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,190
What are you doing here?

169
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:14,528
Visiting hours are over.
I have to ask you to leave.

170
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:17,314
Now.

171
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:18,698
Okay. See you later,
Paulie.

172
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,819
Okay. Everybody's proud
of you, Rock. Yeah?

173
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,529
Yeah.
Now.

174
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:24,947
I feel good tonight.

175
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,365
Yeah, you look good.

176
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:27,707
Let's go.

177
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,455
How are we feeling tonight?

178
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:34,048
Oh, very handsome.

179
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,634
That tastes good.

180
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:46,394
My kid would die
for your autograph.

181
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:48,972
Sure.

182
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:50,055
Would you sign it,
please,

183
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:52,650
"To my good friend,
Charlie Flynn."

184
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,395
My hands are so sore.

185
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:56,571
It's okay.

186
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,486
It's my first autograph.
Thank you.

187
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,079
You're welcome.

188
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:14,547
"To my good friend, Charlie
Flynn," who I don't even know.

189
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:23,933
Yo, Apollo?

190
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:27,012
Who is it?

191
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:28,513
It's just me, Rocky.
Listen.

192
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:30,940
Could you answer
me one question?

193
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:32,859
Yeah, sure.

194
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:35,236
Did you give me your best?

195
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:38,948
Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:44,120
Thank you.

197
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,125
This coming year, you know,
Rocky. How you feeling?

198
00:12:58,225 --> 00:12:59,002
You all right?

199
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:00,247
Yeah, I feel great
being outside.

200
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,547
This coming year, you're
gonna make $300,000 with us.

201
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,882
Yeah?
This fiscal year.

202
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:05,217
Hey, Rock!

203
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,551
Hey, how you doing,
Pete?

204
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:08,220
Hey, could you sign
my head?

205
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,346
Yeah, sure.

206
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:10,555
Thanks.

207
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,148
Hope it don't
go to your brain.

208
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:14,392
Bet that's heavy.
A little bit.

209
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:17,188
Yeah, well, just think how fast
you'll be when you get it off.

210
00:13:17,288 --> 00:13:18,817
Just a minute. Can I
borrow this? Thanks a lot.

211
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,075
Let me use your
head for a minute, kid.

212
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,984
Here, sign, Rocky.
It's a standard deal.

213
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,168
Wait. I want to talk to you
a little bit about this here.

214
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,321
It's a standard
deal...

215
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,854
Just for talking
about shaving stuff?

216
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:28,324
That's all you do.

217
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:29,815
Sledgehammers, whatever. Batteries...

218
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,863
We've got all kinds, of course,
all kinds of commercials,

219
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:33,370
so it could be anything.
Like balls and baseballs?

220
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,622
Yeah, you're gonna
make $300,000.

221
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:36,622
You gotta strike now while
the iron's hot, you know.

222
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:37,703
Yeah. 20 minutes, it's all over.

223
00:13:37,803 --> 00:13:38,970
Yeah, people kind
of forget, you know.

224
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,877
The time is now,

225
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:41,325
if you want to make a dollar. Right now.

226
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:44,674
Here. Sign it here. It takes you two
seconds to sign. It's a standard deal.

227
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:47,593
Okay, I tell you what, I'll sign
it, but I gotta go somewhere now.

228
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,674
Where you going? What could
be more important than this?

229
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:53,557
I just gotta do some things, but
I'll be back. I'll talk to you.

230
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:54,809
Give me a call, then.

231
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,018
Where will we call you?

232
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,311
I'll give you a call.

233
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:58,559
I call you.
You got a number?

234
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:01,732
I'll just call you. I'll
go, "Hey! Yo!" I'll call you.

235
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:03,575
Okay. All right,
you call. Here.

236
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,412
The guy's got
brain damage.

237
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:09,682
You know, it's great
being out of the hospital

238
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,619
and not having to take all
those pills and everything.

239
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:16,456
And my legs were getting so sore and
all that, you know, just laying there.

240
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:21,511
I was kind of shrinking and all that.
It's great to be outside, you know?

241
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:25,132
What are we doing
here at the zoo?

242
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:28,093
Well, you know, I kind of
like the zoo a lot, you know.

243
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:30,304
It's a special place,
especially when it snows,

244
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:33,557
you know, it kind of smells clean
and everything like that, you know.

245
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:35,935
Don't you like the zoo?
Huh?

246
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:37,645
I like the zoo.

247
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:38,904
Yeah, me, too.

248
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:45,236
You know,
I was wondering, like,

249
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:49,907
what do you think you're doing
for, like, the next 40 or 50 years?

250
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:52,501
What do you mean?

251
00:14:56,923 --> 00:15:01,927
I was wondering if you wouldn't
mind marrying me very much.

252
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,016
What'd you say?

253
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,145
If you wouldn't mind
marrying me too much.

254
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:16,643
Yes. I'd like
to marry you.

255
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,945
Yeah?
Yes.

256
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:21,907
Yeah?
Yes.

257
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:35,579
I'll be a good guy, I promise.
I ain't gonna do nothing wrong.

258
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,292
I ain't gonna leave no hair in the
sink or nothing like that, you know.

259
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:43,587
Things are gonna be great,
you know that? Hey!

260
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:46,924
Hey, we're getting married,
you know. You want to come?

261
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:50,386
If you can get out for the weekend,
I'll send you an invitation, Mr. Tiger!

262
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:52,479
That's fantastic,
ain't it?

263
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,206
Yeah, absolutely.
Yes.

264
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,506
I do.
Thanks.

265
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:27,014
You may kiss the bride now.

266
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,509
I gotta take this off?

267
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:30,685
Yeah.

268
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:43,606
Go in peace and God bless you.

269
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:46,192
Thanks, Father. You done
real good. I'm proud of you.

270
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:48,278
Okay. Things are
gonna be great.

271
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:49,654
Rocky,
congratulations!

272
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:52,783
Thanks a lot, thanks
a lot. Thanks, Tony.

273
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:55,048
Hey, I ain't gonna need any
luck. Everything's gonna be okay.

274
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,955
Hey, Rock, you want to
buy into the pet shop?

275
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:59,416
Well, thanks, but I wanna
do commercials instead.

276
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:00,847
Commercials? What for? Concussions?

277
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:01,960
Yeah. Concussions.

278
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,795
Rocky.
Yeah.

279
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:07,348
Isn't that Father
something?

280
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,467
Good luck to the both of
you. Thank you very much.

281
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,440
Well, thanks, Mick.
I gotta go back to the gym.

282
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:13,305
I got a couple
of good prospects.

283
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:14,471
Yeah? Are they
really good?

284
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:15,640
Yeah, they're
pretty good.

285
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,976
All right. See you around,
Mick. Thanks for coming.

286
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:19,311
Can we go
drink now?

287
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:22,022
Excuse me, can I borrow the
bridegroom for one minute?

288
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:23,982
You look beautiful, Adrian.

289
00:17:24,082 --> 00:17:25,942
Yeah, she really
turned out pretty.

290
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:28,820
Now, listen, how much money
you make from your last fight?

291
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,406
I mean, how much money
did you clear?

292
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:32,657
About 37 grand.

293
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:33,825
I know, taxes kill you.

294
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,455
Hey, what do you wanna do
with your money now?

295
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,621
You want to put
them on the street?

296
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,831
Hey, Tony,
I just got married in here.

297
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:41,458
I know,
and I'm happy for you.

298
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:44,670
How's about investing in
condominiums? It's safe.

299
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,796
Condominiums?

300
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:47,640
Yeah, condominiums.

301
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:52,019
I never use them.

302
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,793
Hey, yo!
What are youse doing?

303
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:26,379
Hey, Rock!
What's happening, man?

304
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:28,881
Well, you know, I just got
a little married, you know.

305
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:30,550
Hey, Rock,
congratulations!

306
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,490
What are you guys doing?
Drinking some wine here?

307
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,678
Yeah, man,
we're doing it.

308
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,248
Keep singing some more.
I like that stuff.

309
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,889
Okay, babe. Sing
something for him, Frank.

310
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:42,729
There are two kinds of love
That you ought to know

311
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:47,317
There are two kinds
of love

312
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,486
There are two kinds of...

313
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,696
Who are they?

314
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,614
They're like the neighborhood's
jukebox, you know.

315
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,199
Those guys are
singing all the time.

316
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,221
You know, I never knew you
were so light, you know.

317
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:57,744
Never?
No. If I did,

318
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:59,621
I would have carried
you everywhere.

319
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,998
Are you getting tired?

320
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,792
No, this is great for
the arms. I think it is.

321
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,419
I can't believe
we're married.

322
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,713
Oh, we are. I got proof
in my pocket.

323
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,172
Everything happened so fast.

324
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:10,424
Yeah.

325
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,760
But I knew what was gonna
happen from the start.

326
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,512
What did you know?
Well...

327
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:18,725
The first time I see you,
I says to myself, I says,

328
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,478
even though this girl is suffering
from the disease of being shy,

329
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,690
underneath them
sweaters and hat and...

330
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,547
What did you have on?
About 20 sweaters, was it?

331
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:29,027
No, three.

332
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,281
Yeah, Three Sweaters is the
best girl in Philly, you know.

333
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,366
Oh. Oh, yeah! I said that.

334
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,168
I said that. Oh, yeah. Really?

335
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:41,624
All right, here we are, safe
and sound. Hey, yo, Butkus!

336
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:44,835
Could you get down?
Go on.

337
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,429
Go find another seat,
will you?

338
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,853
You want me to
help you with this?

339
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:04,613
Hey, can I take
this off?

340
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:08,033
That's the way
I like you.

341
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:11,945
You know,

342
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,499
you're the best thing that ever come
into my crazy life, you know that? Huh?

343
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:18,919
Really.

344
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:28,262
You're the best thing that
ever come into my life.

345
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:39,607
You think it'll
always be like this?

346
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:43,444
Yeah.

347
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:46,656
I hope you...
What?

348
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:50,527
You never get tired of me.

349
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:55,123
Oh, no. You ain't
never getting rid of me.

350
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:00,578
I hope nothing changes.

351
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:05,049
I ain't changing. I sure ain't
never changing nothing about you.

352
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:09,796
I love you.

353
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:11,472
I love you, too.

354
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:08,940
Hey, yo!

355
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,534
It's a nice car, Rock. It's a great car.

356
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:11,668
Well, here's
the papers, Rock.

357
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:12,779
Thanks a lot.
Yeah.

358
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:14,025
Congratulations.
Lots of luck.

359
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,198
Thanks a lot.
Same to you.

360
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:16,445
Same to you.
Isn't that nice?

361
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:17,742
We really don't
need a car.

362
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:18,951
Oh, come on,
Adrian.

363
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:20,707
You know, I'm gonna be
doing commercials now.

364
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,955
I can afford this, you know.
No problem.

365
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,285
Well, do you know
how to drive?

366
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,541
Do I know how to drive?

367
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:27,043
Do you know how to drive?

368
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:28,657
I'm one of the greats.
Are you kidding?

369
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:29,796
Come on. I'll drive you.

370
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:31,506
Let me put you
inside the car.

371
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:34,217
This'll just be like Cinderella
and the pumpkin, you know.

372
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:35,551
Do you know how
to drive?

373
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,803
Do I know how to drive?

374
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,971
I drive airplanes
and bulldozers.

375
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:42,066
I'd drive you crazy if you'd give
me a chance, you know what I mean?

376
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:56,364
Yo, Adrian!

377
00:22:56,464 --> 00:23:00,159
Look at this here. Tell me that
wouldn't look great on you, huh?

378
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,578
This coat here? Huh?
What about that one?

379
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:03,663
This coat's okay.

380
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:06,540
Isn't that great? Look at this black
thing here with the tiger on the back.

381
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,044
You like animals? I love
animals. Black. I like black.

382
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:11,291
Black's kind of my favorite
color. You want to buy them?

383
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,828
I say we get them before someone
else buys them. What do you say?

384
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:15,843
Come on, Adrian.

385
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:17,511
I think that would be perfect for her.

386
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:19,137
Yeah, I think
that's perfect, too.

387
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:21,515
Don't you think this is
kind of expensive, you know?

388
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:24,810
Well, hey, do you like
having a good time, huh?

389
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,812
Yes.
Then you need a good watch.

390
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:29,284
I'll tell you what. I want to
get one for Paulie, too, okay?

391
00:23:29,384 --> 00:23:30,986
We'll take these. What
about one for yourself?

392
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:32,359
One for me?
One for you.

393
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:34,027
I can't tell time
very good,

394
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:36,029
but, all right, I'll
take one, too. Very good.

395
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:38,448
Hey, Gloria, you got something
nice for Butkus, you know?

396
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:40,409
Sure thing, Rockhead.

397
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:41,535
Do you like that?

398
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,328
Yo, look at that.
Hey, Butkus!

399
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:46,206
Look at that. Your neck
looks great, huh? Is that...

400
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:48,189
Hey, Gloria, you got
something a little smaller?

401
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:50,044
Yeah. Look at that.

402
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:52,263
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.

403
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,635
You see? Now that's
what I call class, huh?

404
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:58,720
Real sharp.

405
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,189
Yeah.

406
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,365
You okay, Butkus?

407
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:18,157
Nice house. I'd say that's a nice
house in general, wouldn't you?

408
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,034
Look at these bricks,
Adrian.

409
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:21,827
My husband's
an expert on bricks.

410
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,162
Are these new bricks?

411
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,922
Yeah, this is a very
solid neighborhood.

412
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,362
Yeah? You're gonna like this very much.

413
00:24:26,462 --> 00:24:29,043
I like these bricks. There're very
nicely done here. Look very solid.

414
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:30,106
Nice.

415
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:31,921
Nice mailbox.
I like this mailbox.

416
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:35,849
You know, these numbers almost add up
to nine. I like that. That's a good omen.

417
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,227
Oh, wow.

418
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,806
Nice house. Really...

419
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:45,768
Hey, Adrian. Baby, that's a
great spot for the bag, you know.

420
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:49,313
I could teach you how to work
that bag someday, you know.

421
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:51,732
Does it have
copper plumbing?

422
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,400
Upstairs and down.
Yeah?

423
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,446
This whole house is supported
with steel. The whole thing.

424
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:57,509
Yeah.

425
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:00,492
All these floors
are solid oak. Solid.

426
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:04,746
Mrs. Balboa, can I show you the kitchen?
I think you're gonna really like it.

427
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:08,208
Solid.
That's good to know.

428
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:11,795
Hey, Adrian, that's a great spot for
a radio. Right over there, you know?

429
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:13,721
Look at these steps.
Nice steps.

430
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:15,840
Hey, nice kitchen.

431
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,967
Nice.

432
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,060
Nice kitchen, yes.
Yeah.

433
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,138
What are taxes
every year?

434
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:24,474
$1,500.

435
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:25,600
Hey, Adrian,
I like it.

436
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,103
I know a pretty good
deal when I see one, too.

437
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:31,231
Excuse me. I want to talk
to my husband for one second.

438
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:32,803
Can I talk to you?
Can I talk to you?

439
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,410
Sure, I'm available.
I got no appointments.

440
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:40,156
Rocky, you are making this
man's job, you know, very easy.

441
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:44,786
Now, the bank said it would give
us a $16,000 first mortgage at 9.5%.

442
00:25:44,886 --> 00:25:47,581
Well, hey, that don't matter.
I say we get the house now.

443
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,052
Yeah, but we didn't
even go upstairs.

444
00:25:49,152 --> 00:25:51,348
That don't matter. That's just
details. I'm sure it's nice.

445
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,629
Details, huh?
Are you sure?

446
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:55,339
Absolutely. Okay?

447
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:58,926
All right, we'll take the house.
And it better not leak, or else.

448
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:00,598
You know, I just wanted
to tell you something.

449
00:26:00,698 --> 00:26:02,138
Excuse me. Could you
stand over there?

450
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:03,730
I gotta talk secretly
with my wife. Okay?

451
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,016
Sure, sure.

452
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:06,567
I understand.
Yeah.

453
00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:10,480
You know,
I kind of feel stupid,

454
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,605
talking like this with the
lights on and everything,

455
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:15,444
but, you know, the house
here and the solid oak floors,

456
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:17,016
and all that stuff,
and the plumbing,

457
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:19,698
wouldn't be nothing without
you being here, 'cause,

458
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:22,701
I don't know, without you
being here, I probably...

459
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:25,045
I wouldn't be here either,
you know.

460
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:27,338
You don't have to speak.

461
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:28,882
No?

462
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:38,091
Okay. Let's go
celebrate here.

463
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:39,593
I'll beat you
to the pool!

464
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:41,312
Hey, you guys.
Slow down.

465
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:47,894
Mary Anne.
Mary Anne, listen to this.

466
00:26:47,994 --> 00:26:53,399
"You didn't beat nobody, and anybody who
knows boxing knows the fight was fixed."

467
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,151
This one came from London.

468
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:57,779
"You call yourself the champ.
You're a fake.

469
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:00,156
"The fight was a fake.
Go kill yourself."

470
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:03,785
Wouldn't you rather play with
the children than read hate mail?

471
00:27:03,885 --> 00:27:06,412
"How much did you get to
carry that bum for 15 rounds?

472
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:07,864
"You're a disgrace
to your people."

473
00:27:07,964 --> 00:27:09,924
Why can't you ignore it?

474
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:11,842
Are you serious?

475
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:23,771
Come on, let me get you in focus
there. All right, I'm ready.

476
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:26,599
Are you blind, Rock?

477
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:28,101
What are you
getting wise with me?

478
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:31,979
Come on! Throw the ball, Swifty. Let me
see your best here. I'm waiting for you.

479
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,648
I'm waiting for you.

480
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:35,275
You can't even
play stickball!

481
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,861
Hey, come on. I'm ready
now. I'm just warming up.

482
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,029
Are you ready for this?

483
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:42,282
You better keep your mouth closed.
It's coming in that direction.

484
00:27:42,382 --> 00:27:43,784
What a shot!

485
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:45,744
Now I know the day
weren't no waste.

486
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:47,420
Come on, Swifty.

487
00:28:03,312 --> 00:28:05,272
Yeah?
Yes.

488
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,941
Yo, Adrian! You did it!

489
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:12,146
Oh, yeah!
I knew you had it in you.

490
00:28:12,246 --> 00:28:14,352
You woke up this morning,
you had a smile on your face.

491
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:16,150
I said, "Something special's
gonna happen today."

492
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,952
I wasn't sure what, but I
knew it was gonna be different.

493
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:23,391
You know, I was thinking, if this
kid has your good looks, you know,

494
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:25,450
and your good brains
and my good left hook,

495
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,879
he's really
gonna be something.

496
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:32,426
Oh, no, what if it's a girl?
What if it's a girl?

497
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,504
Oh, I didn't think
about that.

498
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:39,133
Well, she'll be everything I'm
not. She won't have to be shy.

499
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:41,177
We could give her singing
and dancing lessons.

500
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:42,386
Yeah. Yeah.

501
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:44,763
How about a new dress every
day? Would you like that?

502
00:28:44,863 --> 00:28:48,767
Have to hire a bodyguard when she starts
going to school to keep all the boys away.

503
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:52,313
You know how them little boys can
be. Real pests in general, can't they?

504
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:56,200
And if it's a boy, I'd like
him to be just like the father.

505
00:28:57,827 --> 00:29:01,121
Don't you think one dumbbell
in the family's enough?

506
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:05,284
I'll tell you one thing, this
kid ain't gonna get no tattoos.

507
00:29:05,384 --> 00:29:06,957
He ain't gonna be
hanging around no corners,

508
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:08,829
ain't gonna dress
like no wiseguy like me.

509
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:11,798
I'll tell you that. He's gonna
be a good somebody like you.

510
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,709
Like you.

511
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:14,885
No, no, no. Like you.

512
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:16,587
Like you.

513
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:17,679
No, no. Like you.

514
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,223
Like you.

515
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:23,895
Yo, Adrian.
We did it. Didn't we?

516
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,348
How you feel, Rocky?
Pretty good.

517
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:27,432
Yeah?

518
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,696
Listen, the reason we didn't
call you a couple of months ago

519
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:31,728
was we wanted to wait till
the swelling went down.

520
00:29:31,828 --> 00:29:32,812
I see.

521
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:33,945
But you look
terrific now.

522
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,657
Yeah? We're gonna make a buck together.

523
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:37,651
Don't worry about it. Yeah. That's good.

524
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:40,463
As a matter of fact, I got a deal
today from Smart Deal Toy Company.

525
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:41,988
Did you ever hear of them?

526
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:43,698
No.
Maybe Mrs. Rocky did.

527
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:45,252
Did you ever hear
of a Smart Deal Toy?

528
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:46,284
No.

529
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,877
No? Big.
They're number one.

530
00:29:48,212 --> 00:29:50,580
And they want to make a
Rocky doll. You understand?

531
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,249
You can kick it.
You can beat it.

532
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:56,211
For kids. You can kick it. You
can beat it. It does everything.

533
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,671
Pretty smart, yeah.

534
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:59,202
That's right.
Takes a terrific beating.

535
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:00,423
I think it's
a great idea.

536
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:02,304
We're gonna make a lot
of money with it. Okay?

537
00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:04,018
Is he ready there?

538
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:08,265
How do I look?
The best.

539
00:30:08,365 --> 00:30:09,357
Fabulous.

540
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:12,185
Adrian, how do I look?

541
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:13,436
Different.

542
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:16,190
Sensational. Come on, let's get it on.

543
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,033
Okay.

544
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:21,036
He's gonna
be great.

545
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:23,114
Don't be nervous.

546
00:30:23,214 --> 00:30:24,177
Yeah.
How do I look?

547
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:25,324
I look stupid,
don't I?

548
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,458
Yes.

549
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:29,787
You got any deodorant?

550
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:30,913
No.

551
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:32,339
Excuse me.

552
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:37,003
All right, we're ready. Let's
go, Arthur. In the cage, Rock.

553
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:38,296
Just the way
we rehearsed.

554
00:30:38,396 --> 00:30:39,664
Everyone get
ready for picture now.

555
00:30:39,764 --> 00:30:40,978
Come on, Rock.
We're running late.

556
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:42,967
Girls, come on.
Look alive, dear.

557
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:44,635
Girls... Yeah.

558
00:30:44,735 --> 00:30:46,805
A little higher. Show the
product. Get ready here.

559
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:48,106
That's it.

560
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,809
Magic time!
Look alive!

561
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:52,060
Quiet on the set.

562
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,062
Roll, please.
Speed.

563
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,564
Beast aftershave,
take one.

564
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:56,698
Action!

565
00:30:57,033 --> 00:30:58,616
Go now?
Action.

566
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:04,156
"In the morning, I splash it on
and it makes me smeel mainly."

567
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:06,666
"Smeel mainly"?
Cut!

568
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:10,338
Isn't that "smell manly"?
Can you read that, Rock?

569
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:12,040
Yeah.

570
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,132
Well, let's go again.

571
00:31:13,592 --> 00:31:18,921
Well, excuse me. I know I said it
wrong, but it really don't smell manly.

572
00:31:19,021 --> 00:31:21,299
I mean, do you think
this stuff smells like a man?

573
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:22,800
I'd say absolutely no.

574
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,010
Are you finished?

575
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,136
I'm sorry.

576
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:26,637
Okay. Rolling again. Speed.

577
00:31:26,737 --> 00:31:28,056
Nice and quiet.

578
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:30,183
Beast aftershave,
take two.

579
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:31,359
Action!

580
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:37,482
"In the morning, I splash it on and
it surrounds my face with class."

581
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:38,574
Cut!

582
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:40,910
Action!

583
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,082
"And Beast aftershave will
turn the women into beasts."

584
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,708
Cut!

585
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,744
Action!

586
00:31:49,844 --> 00:31:54,632
"If you want to be the king of the
beasts and smell like a jungle rat..."

587
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,336
Cat. Rat, cat.
They look a little alike.

588
00:31:58,436 --> 00:31:59,637
Action!

589
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,720
"In the afternoon, when I put
it on to go out with the guys,

590
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,472
"and have a rendezvouze..."

591
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:11,683
Cut! Cut!
We're cutting this set.

592
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:13,394
We're going to
the alternate set.

593
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:14,895
I can get it, you know...

594
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:17,398
I'm sure you can.
Will you get out of the cage?

595
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:18,941
The word "rendezvous."
Yes.

596
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:22,236
Rendezvous over to the other
set, Rock, if you don't mind.

597
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:23,445
Sure.

598
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:24,651
We've only
wasted four hours.

599
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:28,242
Arthur, Arthur, let's reorganize
here. We're going to the alternate set.

600
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:31,453
You know, it sounded great inside
before it come out like that.

601
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:33,080
Get the damn club
away from him

602
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,040
and get the girls into
their other outfits.

603
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,502
Where is the wardrobe people?
Where are the prop people?

604
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:40,554
All right,
wet him down.

605
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:45,259
Arthur,
step out, please.

606
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,385
Speed.

607
00:32:46,485 --> 00:32:49,479
Beast aftershave,
"The Contender." Take seven.

608
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:51,857
Try to get it right.
Action!

609
00:32:52,024 --> 00:32:56,145
Hi. My name is Rocky Balboa,
the Italian Stallion.

610
00:32:56,245 --> 00:33:00,116
They say I'm the American
dream, but not 'cause...

611
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:02,986
Can I do it over again?

612
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:04,613
Christ! Cut.

613
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:08,909
No, just keep it rolling. Keep it
rolling. Just read it off the dummy cards.

614
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:10,286
Dummy cards?

615
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:11,628
Please! Go on.

616
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:16,667
Wait a minute. I'd like to explain
something. You know, I ain't punchy.

617
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:19,086
I got what you call,
like, I don't know,

618
00:33:19,186 --> 00:33:21,464
a relaxed brain, but I
ain't punchy, you know.

619
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:23,132
It's just
the way I talk here.

620
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:24,592
What's the difference?

621
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:26,635
Can you just do it
the way it's written?

622
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:27,845
That ain't right.

623
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:30,097
This whole thing here
ain't right, you know.

624
00:33:30,197 --> 00:33:31,515
What isn't right?

625
00:33:31,615 --> 00:33:34,477
Well, you're a rude guy. I'm trying
very hard and you're being rude.

626
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,562
That's bad manners,
ain't it, Adrian?

627
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:37,646
Yes.

628
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:42,359
I'll tell you, I gotta be almost punchy
to be doing this in front of my wife.

629
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:46,780
You want to quit? Then
quit! Leave! Get out of here!

630
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,074
I didn't want you for this
setup in the first place.

631
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:51,536
You have wasted,
wasted our time, sir.

632
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:53,580
This is a complete bust,
the whole afternoon.

633
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,166
Leonard. Leonard,
where are you going?

634
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:58,710
I want you to take
him with you, Leonard.

635
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,046
Take this man with you.
He is not a professional.

636
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:03,298
I only work
with professionals.

637
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:06,267
You cost us thousands of
dollars because you can't read.

638
00:34:07,061 --> 00:34:10,514
"'It's no time to cuss
me,' snarled the robber.

639
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:14,476
"'By God, fellows, grab your
rifles and take color... Cover."'

640
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:15,735
How does that sound?

641
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:17,820
It's good.
Yeah?

642
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:21,566
You know, being a good reader's gonna
help me get a good office job, you know?

643
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,901
Want to hear some more?

644
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,202
I can't wait.

645
00:34:25,788 --> 00:34:26,955
Okay.

646
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:30,700
"'There ain't no cover,
Smokey,' said Brad Lincoln.

647
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,452
"'We better head
for the canyon."'

648
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:33,995
You read nice.

649
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:35,455
Thank you.
You lie nice.

650
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:36,881
Thank you.

651
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,045
And how far did you go in
high school, Mr. Balboa?

652
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:43,380
Ninth.

653
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,632
And one last question.

654
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:46,976
Do you have
a criminal record?

655
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:50,771
Nothing worth
bragging about.

656
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:57,027
Would you be interested
in some sort of manual labor?

657
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,189
Well, I got nothing against
honest manual labor.

658
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:03,568
It's just that I'd like to see if
I could make a living sitting down,

659
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,529
like you're doing
over there.

660
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:10,199
Can I be honest? No one's going
to offer you an office job.

661
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:14,078
There's too much competition.
Why don't you fight?

662
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,214
I've read somewhere
you're a very good fighter.

663
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,009
Yeah? Well...

664
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:24,590
Was you ever punched in the
face 500 times a night, you know?

665
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,225
Stings after a while,
you know.

666
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:33,273
Thank you very much for
your time. I appreciate it.

667
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,278
Mr. Balboa?
Yeah.

668
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:47,447
I'm very sorry.
We have nothing.

669
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:49,157
Are you sure?

670
00:35:49,257 --> 00:35:50,291
Next.

671
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:52,577
Hey, look, pal,
you gotta be realistic.

672
00:35:52,677 --> 00:35:55,496
You got no high school
diploma, no qualifications.

673
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:59,675
Wouldn't you be more content with
a good-paying menial labor job?

674
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:02,845
Thanks.

675
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:07,467
The way I see it is, I can get
another job if I want to, you know?

676
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:11,763
But do I want to? Do I want to be doing
something I ain't gonna be happy doing?

677
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:14,857
Plus, you know, we need
the money now, Butkus.

678
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:18,269
Dogs don't want to
hear my problems.

679
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:19,570
Come on.

680
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:25,743
Yeah. I wish I was a canine
sometimes. Give me a kiss.

681
00:36:25,952 --> 00:36:28,696
The only job I
got is lugging beef.

682
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:30,907
You got nothing better for
Rocky than hauling beef?

683
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:33,160
Hey, that's all I got, and
we're cutting back, too.

684
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,913
So, Rocky, if you want to work,
it'd be from week to week, okay?

685
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:38,874
Well, that's okay with me,
but when can I start?

686
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,626
Well, how about
tomorrow?

687
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:42,344
Well, how about today?

688
00:36:43,513 --> 00:36:44,626
Okay. We got
a load coming in.

689
00:36:44,726 --> 00:36:45,631
Great.

690
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:47,613
Hey, Paulie, you look
kind of skinny there, huh.

691
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:49,510
Yeah, he's losing
weight, ain't he?

692
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,345
Don't bother to
thank me.

693
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:56,024
Hey, thanks a lot, Paulie, and you don't
have to thank me for the watch, either.

694
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,960
Quitting time!

695
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,532
Hey, there's the best-looking
thing I seen all day.

696
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:27,486
You look tired.

697
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:30,197
No, no. My face is tired. I feel okay.

698
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:31,948
You want to take
a hot bath?

699
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:34,159
No, come on. I feel dynamic. Honest.

700
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:39,964
Hey, listen. Tomorrow... I was thinking at
work, maybe after work I'll take you out.

701
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:43,293
You want to do something
nice, huh? You want to do that?

702
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:45,086
I'd like to do that.
How's your stomach?

703
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:46,838
All right.
You all right?

704
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,349
You look great.
Do you know that?

705
00:39:44,072 --> 00:39:46,274
Hey, Rock, they just like old friends.

706
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:48,192
Old friends never
tasted this good.

707
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:49,869
I heard that.

708
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,381
Yo!

709
00:40:01,716 --> 00:40:02,966
Yo, Rock!

710
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,846
You wanted me, Frank?

711
00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:08,806
I gotta let you go.

712
00:40:12,102 --> 00:40:14,929
How come? I'm working
hard. I'm doing good.

713
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:17,390
Yeah, real good, but we
gotta cut back on manpower

714
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,943
and you ain't got enough
time in, you know? Seniority.

715
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,948
How about if I take
a cut in pay, all right?

716
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:28,159
Can't do it. Union rules.

717
00:40:29,745 --> 00:40:31,287
Union rules.

718
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,160
Can I finish out
the day?

719
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,336
Sure.

720
00:40:39,296 --> 00:40:41,339
Hey, Rocky, I'm sorry.

721
00:40:42,466 --> 00:40:43,925
Yeah, me, too.

722
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:55,303
You got more stories than
a book, you know that?

723
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:58,606
There's my brother-in-law,
Rocky. Give me the five.

724
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,902
My brother-in-law
come to visit me.

725
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:05,522
How you doing? How's everything
been? How's business? Okay?

726
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:06,698
Yeah.

727
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,515
Looking over your
old stomping ground?

728
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:09,443
Yeah.

729
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:12,321
Listen, Paulie, you want
to buy this car, you know.

730
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:13,656
I thought
you liked it.

731
00:41:13,756 --> 00:41:15,229
It's okay, but I don't
need it no more.

732
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,976
You know, I have a hard time making
these right turns with my bad eye.

733
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,921
Keep hitting trash cans
and things like that.

734
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,082
You got problems at home?
You need bread?

735
00:41:23,182 --> 00:41:24,574
No, no, everything's okay.
You know,

736
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:27,836
this car would look great wrapped
around you, you know. Wouldn't it?

737
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:31,131
Look, you need a hand-out,
I'll give you a hand-out.

738
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:33,225
No, I don't need
no hand-out, Paulie.

739
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:36,136
Look, you want
to buy the car?

740
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:39,481
Sure. Why don't you be
smart and fight again?

741
00:41:42,402 --> 00:41:45,479
That's okay. I don't need to fight no
more. Listen, you want to buy the car?

742
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:48,023
You want to pick up the
payments and all of that?

743
00:41:48,123 --> 00:41:49,741
Is my sister giving you
a hard time?

744
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:51,743
You know, if she is,
you break her teeth.

745
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:55,448
I appreciate the advice,
Paulie,

746
00:41:55,548 --> 00:41:57,696
but I kind of like her teeth,
you know, where they are.

747
00:41:57,796 --> 00:42:01,587
Okay? Here you go.
You bought yourself a car.

748
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:06,426
Good car, you know. Gotta buckle
up for safety and all that.

749
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:10,430
Where you going?
You need a lift?

750
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:12,890
Nah.

751
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:15,893
See you around.

752
00:42:23,737 --> 00:42:25,821
Hey,
say hi to my sister for me!

753
00:42:28,074 --> 00:42:31,452
Hey, listen, if you two
need the car, just ask!

754
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:47,293
When did you get home?
I thought you were at work.

755
00:42:47,393 --> 00:42:50,138
No, I ain't at work
no more. I got...

756
00:42:51,807 --> 00:42:53,516
I got canned today.

757
00:42:56,353 --> 00:42:57,637
What happened?

758
00:42:57,737 --> 00:42:58,980
I don't know.
I was...

759
00:42:59,648 --> 00:43:02,271
You know, it's nobody's fault. They
were just cutting back, you know.

760
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,485
It was economics.

761
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:06,229
What are you gonna do?

762
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:08,198
I don't know. I was

763
00:43:08,824 --> 00:43:10,825
thinking about fighting.

764
00:43:12,745 --> 00:43:16,073
What about your eye, you know? The
doctor said you shouldn't fight anymore.

765
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:21,377
No, no. He recommended I don't
fight, and I recommend that I do.

766
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:23,246
You'll go blind.

767
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:25,749
Nobody's going blind.
Honest, I see great, you know.

768
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:28,760
I see like a beagle
or something like that.

769
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:33,771
You could be whatever you want to
be. You don't have to fight anymore.

770
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:38,561
You know, I am a fighter, not
too good, but that's what I do.

771
00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:43,101
Oh, Rocky, you gave me your
word you wouldn't fight anymore.

772
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:46,195
I mean, if we need money,
I could get a job.

773
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:52,118
You don't have to do that.

774
00:43:53,578 --> 00:43:59,375
Oh, sure. I can get my job back,
you know, part-time, at the pet shop.

775
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:08,801
But I'm the one
who's supposed to support.

776
00:44:09,845 --> 00:44:12,054
It's just for a little while.

777
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:18,344
Listen, what if you catch some
pet shop disease or something?

778
00:44:18,444 --> 00:44:22,898
There are no pet shop diseases,
Rocky. I mean, really, I want to work.

779
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:26,777
Do you really
want to do it?

780
00:44:28,363 --> 00:44:31,866
Yeah. We need the money.
It'll come in handy.

781
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,583
Well, maybe you're right,
you know.

782
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:41,627
You know what's best,
you know.

783
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,203
Could you start dinner? I'm
starting to get a little hungry.

784
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,672
I just want to finish
my workout here, okay?

785
00:44:52,772 --> 00:44:53,848
Sure.

786
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,955
Jesus.

787
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,923
Who the hell is that?

788
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:12,044
Avon lady.

789
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,012
Is that Rocky?

790
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:18,217
Hey! I don't remember
giving you no key.

791
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,595
Come on up here. Well,
the prodigal son returns!

792
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,473
You don't look so bad,
do you, kid?

793
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:25,934
What's that, an outer
space monster you brought?

794
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:29,938
No, that's Butkus, my large dog.
What's that in your ear there?

795
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:33,408
Oh, this? I hear
stupid things better.

796
00:46:34,118 --> 00:46:37,153
Well, now, did you come here
to show me that dog?

797
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:40,323
No. Mick, can I have
my locker back?

798
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,741
Yeah.
What's on your mind?

799
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:42,834
Fighting.

800
00:46:43,419 --> 00:46:46,254
Fighting? What?
You want to go blind?

801
00:46:46,588 --> 00:46:47,956
Nobody's going blind.

802
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,332
You heard what I said?

803
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:52,002
Yeah, and the eye's great. No problem.

804
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:55,131
Now, listen, every pug thinks
he has one good one left.

805
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,600
Now forget it, 'cause your
fighting career is over, kid.

806
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,136
Is that right?

807
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:01,260
Yeah, I think
that's right.

808
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,119
You know, I spend my whole
life getting a career.

809
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:05,641
I get one, and you tell me it's over.

810
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:08,269
What's the matter here?
You shook the hell out of

811
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:10,229
the champion of
the whole wide world.

812
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:11,647
You be happy with that.

813
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:13,399
Well, maybe we can
do better this time.

814
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:14,859
Or worse.
What about that?

815
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:16,328
Hey, yo, Mick.

816
00:47:16,704 --> 00:47:20,915
I done you a favor last time, you
know. Can you do me one this time?

817
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,703
I don't know.
You don't understand me.

818
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:26,997
Now, look, I want to
show you something now.

819
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:29,799
Test you. Now, look,
you look right there

820
00:47:29,925 --> 00:47:31,543
at the end of my nose, will you? Okay.

821
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:32,711
I want to test you.

822
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:33,837
Look at your nose.

823
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:35,005
You look at my nose now.

824
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:37,023
When I bring my finger in,
you tell me when you see it,

825
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:38,467
will you?
Okay.

826
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:39,897
There's the little thing.
I see it.

827
00:47:39,997 --> 00:47:41,053
That's good.

828
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:42,679
I told you. It's okay.

829
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:45,182
Now, wait.
Now we'll try the other lamp.

830
00:47:45,282 --> 00:47:48,026
Now, look here, will you?
Now, tell me.

831
00:47:52,114 --> 00:47:53,231
I see it.

832
00:47:53,331 --> 00:47:54,441
No, you see nothing.

833
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:59,071
Creed would have caved in the whole
side of your face. Now, forget it, kid.

834
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:03,500
You got the heart, but you ain't got
the tools no more. Now, forget it!

835
00:48:05,002 --> 00:48:06,036
Is that right?

836
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,162
That is right.

837
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:11,125
Yeah? Well, maybe it's you who
ain't got it no more, you know that?

838
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:13,594
Yeah. Yeah. That's it.

839
00:48:17,265 --> 00:48:22,136
Now, look, you didn't even
see that coming, did you? No.

840
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:25,848
Well, that was from
a broken-down pug like me.

841
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:28,776
What do you think the champ
would do to you?

842
00:48:35,158 --> 00:48:37,110
I don't know.
Hurt me bad.

843
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,654
No. He'd hurt you permanent.

844
00:48:39,754 --> 00:48:41,080
Permanent.

845
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:45,584
You know, Mick, if...

846
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:54,009
If I can't fight no more, maybe I
can help out around here, you know.

847
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:58,139
Here? Well, sure, but...

848
00:48:58,265 --> 00:49:01,384
You know, you're
like royalty here, kid.

849
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:04,847
You want those guys to see you
carrying towels and buckets around?

850
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:06,731
Where's your dignity?

851
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,820
I don't know how to
say this. I just...

852
00:49:14,074 --> 00:49:15,867
I gotta be around it.

853
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,044
All right, kid.
Will you come back tomorrow?

854
00:49:32,342 --> 00:49:34,051
Thanks a lot, Mick.

855
00:49:57,242 --> 00:49:58,986
Look, I don't know
about anybody else,

856
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:00,983
but as long as I'm gonna be
promoting this fight myself,

857
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:03,115
I want a lot more pressure
put on for a rematch.

858
00:50:03,215 --> 00:50:07,077
Hey, we can get the same money
for the two top contenders.

859
00:50:07,177 --> 00:50:09,371
Why go after Balboa?
Why?

860
00:50:09,471 --> 00:50:12,666
Because there's still a lot of
people out there that think he won.

861
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:15,629
There's a lot of people out there
accusing me of having the fight fixed,

862
00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:16,772
accusing me of being a fake,

863
00:50:16,872 --> 00:50:19,173
and insulting my kids
at school. That's why.

864
00:50:19,273 --> 00:50:20,341
You want to hear the truth?

865
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:21,566
Yeah,
I want to hear the truth.

866
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:24,811
The truth is that last time
he was damn lucky.

867
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,056
Now he's all finished.

868
00:50:27,156 --> 00:50:30,184
I mean, he's been hanging around
doing nothing for six months.

869
00:50:30,284 --> 00:50:33,896
And any trainer worth anything
wouldn't have nothing to do with him.

870
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:37,483
Now, I say, let's go after
some new meat.

871
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:39,159
Forget this bum.

872
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,497
Do you think I beat him
the last time? Do you?

873
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,450
You got the decision.

874
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,877
Man, I won,
but I didn't beat him!

875
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,799
What are you afraid of, Tony?

876
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,177
Honest?
Yeah, honest.

877
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,437
He's all wrong for us,
baby.

878
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:12,402
I saw you beat that man like I
never saw no man get beat before,

879
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,489
and the man kept
coming after you.

880
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,119
Now, we don't need that
kind of man in our life.

881
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,291
I know what you're feeling.

882
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,168
Let it go.

883
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,798
Let it go.

884
00:51:33,842 --> 00:51:35,467
You're the champ.

885
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,593
Thank you. Look, you're in charge
of my public relations, right?

886
00:51:43,693 --> 00:51:45,220
I want a whole new
campaign started.

887
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,806
I want something done
publicly to bring this man out.

888
00:51:47,906 --> 00:51:49,665
I want something done
to jar this man's pride.

889
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:52,519
I want something done to get
the people around him talking.

890
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:53,937
All right?
You realize

891
00:51:54,037 --> 00:51:58,700
if we use this humiliation tactic,
you're setting yourself up as the bad guy.

892
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:01,244
Look, man, whatever
gets him in the ring.

893
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:28,563
What's happening?
Hey.

894
00:52:29,523 --> 00:52:31,475
What?
Where's your heart?

895
00:52:31,575 --> 00:52:32,934
What are you
talking about?

896
00:52:33,034 --> 00:52:34,311
You heard me.

897
00:52:34,411 --> 00:52:36,071
Well, what's this?

898
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,084
It's kind of funny,
don't you think?

899
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:18,439
Hey, hey, Chico,
listen. Hey, hey, listen.

900
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:21,401
What's with the grin? How'd
you get so happy with yourself?

901
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:24,529
Let me tell you something.
Snarl more, you see.

902
00:53:24,629 --> 00:53:29,033
Now, a good snarl can give you what
the Bible calls a psychological edge,

903
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:33,205
because you snarl on your
punches. Wait a minute. Hey, Rock!

904
00:53:33,305 --> 00:53:38,210
Rock, come here a minute. Show this
Latin lamebrain how to snarl and punch.

905
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,928
Show him that.

906
00:53:42,473 --> 00:53:45,600
That's it, you see. That's
ugly! That's a snarl.

907
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:49,972
Hey, John, will you empty them buckets?
They're flowing over. Will you do that?

908
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:51,646
Hey, Johnny, I'll do it.
No, let him do it.

909
00:53:51,746 --> 00:53:52,965
I got it, Rock.
Come on, I don't mind.

910
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:53,943
Hey, Rock...

911
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,118
Hey, wait a minute.

912
00:54:04,913 --> 00:54:06,531
Now you can
take it.

913
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:07,824
Whoops.

914
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:09,367
Hey!

915
00:54:09,467 --> 00:54:12,336
Can't you think of anything
tougher to say than, "Whoops"?

916
00:54:13,005 --> 00:54:14,964
Come on,
hit that right.

917
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,181
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

918
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:29,605
All right. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

919
00:54:37,572 --> 00:54:38,864
Yo, Rock.

920
00:54:40,658 --> 00:54:42,735
Yo, Tony.
How you doing?

921
00:54:42,835 --> 00:54:45,070
How am I doing?
No, how are you doing?

922
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,787
Look, I heard you was
working in this dump.

923
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:49,003
Now what are you doing, huh?
Give it to me straight, brother.

924
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:51,952
Oh, you know, I'm sweeping up,
making a few bucks here and there.

925
00:54:52,052 --> 00:54:56,123
You ain't no janitor, Rock. You don't need
a job like this. Besides, you're Italian.

926
00:54:56,223 --> 00:54:57,816
Now you come back
and work for me, Rock.

927
00:54:57,926 --> 00:54:59,585
Yeah, well,
what would I be doing?

928
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:04,056
You mean, like, you know,
like collecting or something?

929
00:55:04,307 --> 00:55:07,802
Well, what else? Look, you come back.
You work on the docks, get some fresh air.

930
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:09,178
It stinks in here.

931
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:12,314
Yo, Tony,
I appreciate the offer, but...

932
00:55:13,107 --> 00:55:15,184
I can't do that
stuff no more.

933
00:55:15,284 --> 00:55:16,485
It's healthy, huh?

934
00:55:17,195 --> 00:55:19,898
Now, look, I gotta go.
Take it easy, huh, champ?

935
00:55:19,998 --> 00:55:22,784
Yeah. See you around.

936
00:55:23,994 --> 00:55:25,954
Remember that guy,
Rock?

937
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:48,810
Yo!

938
00:55:49,937 --> 00:55:51,763
How's everybody in
the clubhouse tonight?

939
00:55:51,863 --> 00:55:53,431
Oh, fine.
How'd your day go?

940
00:55:53,531 --> 00:55:55,164
A million laughs.
You know, it was great.

941
00:55:55,276 --> 00:55:56,893
You need some help with that? Yes.

942
00:55:56,993 --> 00:55:58,687
Yes. Okay.

943
00:55:58,787 --> 00:56:00,095
Hey, you know, Adrian,
I was thinking

944
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:02,389
maybe you ought to stay home
and rest your stomach, you know.

945
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:04,693
Come on, Rock, it's just
part-time. We need the money.

946
00:56:04,793 --> 00:56:07,203
Yeah, well,
maybe you're right.

947
00:56:08,455 --> 00:56:09,874
There we go.

948
00:56:11,293 --> 00:56:13,537
That ain't my brand.
I like oatmeal.

949
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,581
Hey, listen, why don't
we forget all this work?

950
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:17,416
Listen, you want to
come home with me now,

951
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:19,478
and maybe I'll tell you a
few jokes on the way home,

952
00:56:19,578 --> 00:56:21,386
and maybe you'll laugh,
you know?

953
00:56:21,971 --> 00:56:25,215
We need a few laughs in our
life. What do you think? Maybe?

954
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,425
Yes.
Maybe?

955
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:29,845
Maybe. Maybe? Okay.
Let's get out of here, okay?

956
00:56:29,945 --> 00:56:31,722
Okay.
Here we go.

957
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:33,223
Hey, listen, Adrian.
Yeah.

958
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:36,151
Listen to this one.
Why do cows wear bells?

959
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:38,228
Why?

960
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,521
'Cause their
horns don't work.

961
00:56:40,156 --> 00:56:42,073
Is that killing you?
No?

962
00:56:43,492 --> 00:56:44,484
Oh, God!

963
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:46,180
They really used to
like it in third grade.

964
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,040
I used to break everybody
up with that one.

965
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:53,376
Yo!

966
00:56:54,837 --> 00:56:56,922
You really sweep good, man!

967
00:56:58,174 --> 00:57:00,500
Is he talking to you?

968
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,387
Nah, he probably has me mixed
up with somebody else. Come on.

969
00:57:06,766 --> 00:57:08,351
Italian chicken.

970
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,022
Boy,
you guys got the easy life.

971
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:17,644
Hey, how you guys doing? Did
anybody move today, you know, huh?

972
00:57:17,744 --> 00:57:21,447
How's life in the bowl? You
gotta exercise once in a while.

973
00:57:22,074 --> 00:57:25,068
Would you like a little snacklet
or something? Here you go.

974
00:57:25,168 --> 00:57:28,704
Come on, Cuff. Hey, Link,
what, you drowning down there?

975
00:57:29,206 --> 00:57:33,042
Hey, want to hear some TV?
Want to hear some TV?

976
00:57:36,088 --> 00:57:40,291
The Los Angeles Rams. The Rams
defeated the Buccaneers in overtime,

977
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:42,377
13 to 10, on Frank
Corell's 45-yard field goal.

978
00:57:42,477 --> 00:57:45,388
Hey, Butkus. Come here,
Butkus. Come here, boy.

979
00:57:47,015 --> 00:57:49,016
What did you do today,
huh?

980
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:51,719
Did you bark at
anybody today?

981
00:57:51,819 --> 00:57:56,440
Yo, Adrian! Sometimes I look at Butkus
and I don't think he's a normal canine.

982
00:57:57,192 --> 00:57:58,284
Well, what do you
think he is?

983
00:57:58,384 --> 00:57:59,268
I don't know.

984
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:01,855
He just don't look like a
regular dog to me sometimes,

985
00:58:01,955 --> 00:58:03,774
you know, when I look
inside there.

986
00:58:03,874 --> 00:58:07,778
Earlier today I was down at
Apollo Creed's palatial gym,

987
00:58:07,878 --> 00:58:12,741
and, as usual, the world champion was not
at a loss for words about Rocky Balboa.

988
00:58:12,841 --> 00:58:15,536
Look, I know a lot of people out
there want to see me in a rematch

989
00:58:15,636 --> 00:58:18,664
with a timid fellow who calls
himself the Italian Stallion.

990
00:58:18,764 --> 00:58:21,788
But this man does not have the honor to
meet me in the ring. Or is it Scallion?

991
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:23,584
Now, listen, in fairness,
Apollo... What's his name?

992
00:58:23,684 --> 00:58:24,670
What is your name?

993
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,098
...Rocky Balboa did
officially retire.

994
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:28,814
Yeah. The bum's hiding. The bum's
running. He doesn't want to face me.

995
00:58:28,934 --> 00:58:30,373
He's scared.
You know it and I know it.

996
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:32,405
Apollo, I think there's
more here than meets the eye.

997
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:35,849
You've been under close scrutiny ever
since that split-decision victory.

998
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:39,519
A lot of reporters, Apollo, including
me, thought it was an even draw.

999
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,399
That's your opinion
and you're entitled to it.

1000
00:58:41,499 --> 00:58:43,356
But now I'm ready
to have a rematch,

1001
00:58:43,456 --> 00:58:46,359
to prove that this lucky club
fighter, and that's what he was, lucky,

1002
00:58:46,459 --> 00:58:47,902
does not have the skill

1003
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:51,239
to last five minutes in the ring
with a superior athlete like me.

1004
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:54,284
The man's running, the man's hiding.
The man doesn't want to face me.

1005
00:58:54,384 --> 00:58:57,204
So I say to you, Rocky Balboa,
or whatever your name is,

1006
00:58:57,304 --> 00:58:58,798
that I want
the American people to know,

1007
00:58:58,898 --> 00:59:00,207
I want
the whole world to know,

1008
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:02,393
that I'm ready, willing, and
able to meet you anywhere.

1009
00:59:02,493 --> 00:59:05,379
Any place, any time, I will meet
and defeat this so-called fighter,

1010
00:59:05,479 --> 00:59:07,506
who calls himself
the Italian Stallion,

1011
00:59:07,606 --> 00:59:09,344
if the man only has the guts
to give me a call.

1012
00:59:09,444 --> 00:59:12,269
And you can call me collect.
Call me, Balboa!

1013
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:16,265
This would be a legitimate rematch,
the boxer against the puncher,

1014
00:59:16,365 --> 00:59:19,518
and I think everyone wants to see
them back in the ring together.

1015
00:59:19,618 --> 00:59:23,197
But there's only one problem,
where is Rocky Balboa?

1016
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:25,657
Ugly bum!

1017
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:36,668
You know,
I was thinking that

1018
00:59:37,837 --> 00:59:40,581
I ain't supposed to
do no commercials and

1019
00:59:40,681 --> 00:59:43,467
I ain't supposed to
work in no meat house.

1020
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:46,136
I'm supposed to be
a fighter.

1021
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:48,723
But you gave that up.

1022
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:50,934
Yeah.

1023
00:59:51,852 --> 00:59:54,646
I think I'm becoming
a nobody again, too.

1024
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,932
In whose eyes?
Not mine.

1025
00:59:57,032 --> 00:59:58,358
In mine.

1026
00:59:59,485 --> 01:00:00,693
In here.

1027
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:04,773
We'll get by.

1028
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:05,949
That's just it.

1029
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:10,946
I don't want you to get by
the hard way, you know?

1030
01:00:11,046 --> 01:00:12,781
I want you to have
good things.

1031
01:00:12,881 --> 01:00:15,158
I want the kid to
have good things.

1032
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:16,793
We'll have them.

1033
01:00:18,045 --> 01:00:20,797
I just think we need
them now, don't you?

1034
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:23,633
Rocky, please...

1035
01:00:24,718 --> 01:00:27,095
You don't have
to prove anything.

1036
01:00:28,764 --> 01:00:30,723
Adrian, it's all I know.

1037
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:34,352
I don't want you to do it.

1038
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:37,772
It's all I know.

1039
01:00:41,235 --> 01:00:42,486
Adrian?

1040
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:46,283
You know,

1041
01:00:48,995 --> 01:00:52,205
I never asked you to stop
being a woman, you know?

1042
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:58,295
Please, I'm asking you, please,
don't ask me to stop being a man.

1043
01:00:59,172 --> 01:01:00,380
Please.

1044
01:01:30,995 --> 01:01:34,198
I think we ought to
knock his block off.

1045
01:01:34,298 --> 01:01:35,365
Absolutely.

1046
01:01:35,465 --> 01:01:36,584
Rocky.

1047
01:01:40,005 --> 01:01:41,339
I'm sorry.

1048
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:50,973
Well...
Let's do it.

1049
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:57,055
Apollo! Has a site been
chosen for the rematch?

1050
01:01:57,155 --> 01:01:59,557
This fight will be held in
the Philadelphia Spectrum,

1051
01:01:59,657 --> 01:02:01,901
'cause I want this man's
hometown to see this.

1052
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:04,896
I want all of Philadelphia,
I want all of America,

1053
01:02:04,996 --> 01:02:08,733
I want the whole world to see me
destroy this man after two short rounds.

1054
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:09,859
Because after this fight,

1055
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,553
he's gonna have to donate what's
gonna be left of his body to science.

1056
01:02:12,653 --> 01:02:14,446
But there won't be much.
That I can guarantee you.

1057
01:02:14,546 --> 01:02:18,910
Rocky, what do you think about the
fight taking place in the Spectrum?

1058
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,536
Well, I'm very happy
about that.

1059
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:21,746
Why?

1060
01:02:21,846 --> 01:02:24,715
Well, it's only about 10 minutes
from my house, the Spectrum.

1061
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:27,669
Apollo, a lot of people say
that you lost the first fight,

1062
01:02:27,769 --> 01:02:29,546
a victim of
the southpaw jinx.

1063
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:31,264
Did fighting a
left-hander throw you off?

1064
01:02:31,364 --> 01:02:32,925
Southpaw jinx nothing!

1065
01:02:33,025 --> 01:02:36,345
Last time, I took the fight too lightly,
and this man was just plain lucky.

1066
01:02:36,445 --> 01:02:40,015
But this time... This time you
all will see the real Apollo Creed.

1067
01:02:40,115 --> 01:02:42,434
The world is gonna see
the real Apollo Creed.

1068
01:02:42,534 --> 01:02:46,438
Lightning fast and hard to catch.
No playing, no jiving, just business.

1069
01:02:46,538 --> 01:02:48,194
All right. Looks like
he's got a good chance.

1070
01:02:48,294 --> 01:02:53,112
Rocky, do you think you have a
chance this time against Apollo?

1071
01:02:53,212 --> 01:02:55,747
I don't know.
He looks pretty mad.

1072
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:59,285
Me and Mick,
we're gonna try our best.

1073
01:02:59,385 --> 01:03:01,753
His lungs he's
gonna punch out.

1074
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:03,747
Now, who's that?
Al Capone?

1075
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:05,258
I wouldn't sweat you.

1076
01:03:06,427 --> 01:03:09,963
Look here, look here, a lot of people
may not like me, and that's okay.

1077
01:03:10,063 --> 01:03:14,009
But come November, Apollo Creed will
provide the ultimate gala spectacle,

1078
01:03:14,109 --> 01:03:17,345
on Thanksgiving, in front
of this man's home crowd.

1079
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,681
I'm gonna drop him
like a bad habit.

1080
01:03:19,781 --> 01:03:21,808
Rocky, your pay for the
fight is very substantial.

1081
01:03:21,908 --> 01:03:24,145
What are you gonna
do with the money?

1082
01:03:24,245 --> 01:03:28,524
Well, the first thing I gotta do
is I gotta pay the rent, you know.

1083
01:03:28,624 --> 01:03:31,527
And then, well, I made
this list on the way over.

1084
01:03:31,627 --> 01:03:32,936
I was just thinking
of things to do.

1085
01:03:33,036 --> 01:03:36,157
I'd like to get a couple
of hats, and a motorcycle,

1086
01:03:36,257 --> 01:03:40,119
and a couple of quarts of perfume
for Adrian. She likes to smell good.

1087
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:44,832
And some Muppet toys. You know,
Ernie and Big Bird and that frog.

1088
01:03:44,932 --> 01:03:47,043
What's his name?
Kermit or something?

1089
01:03:47,143 --> 01:03:48,677
I don't know.

1090
01:03:49,888 --> 01:03:51,756
And I thought maybe
a statue for the church,

1091
01:03:51,856 --> 01:03:54,342
and I think a snow cone
machine for you, Paulie.

1092
01:03:54,442 --> 01:03:56,060
You like snow cones,
don't you?

1093
01:03:56,186 --> 01:03:57,178
Yeah.

1094
01:03:57,278 --> 01:04:00,814
Rocky, got anything derogatory
to say about the champ?

1095
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,768
"Derogatory"?
Yeah. He's great.

1096
01:04:03,868 --> 01:04:05,853
How about some clowning shots, Apollo?

1097
01:04:05,953 --> 01:04:07,188
Yeah.

1098
01:04:07,288 --> 01:04:10,115
Does this look like
a circus to you, man?

1099
01:04:11,368 --> 01:04:13,577
Come November,
you're mine.

1100
01:04:16,498 --> 01:04:17,699
He's very upset.

1101
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:19,000
Well...

1102
01:04:23,297 --> 01:04:25,916
See how smooth
he moves there?

1103
01:04:26,016 --> 01:04:27,876
See how he pumps
that jab into your eye?

1104
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:29,177
Yeah.

1105
01:04:29,845 --> 01:04:33,006
You got guts to go back
in the ring with him, kid.

1106
01:04:33,106 --> 01:04:35,058
Thanks a lot, Mick.

1107
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:39,638
Your style's too
easy to figure out.

1108
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:42,057
I mean, left-handed fighters
they're the worst, you know.

1109
01:04:42,157 --> 01:04:43,975
They lead with
their face mostly.

1110
01:04:44,075 --> 01:04:47,612
Trying to throw that big
left. Right's no damn good.

1111
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:50,816
They ought to
outlaw southpaws.

1112
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:53,235
Yeah, why didn't you
tell me this before?

1113
01:04:53,335 --> 01:04:56,329
I didn't want to hurt
your feelings. Now, look.

1114
01:04:57,289 --> 01:05:01,493
To pull this miracle off,
you gotta change everything.

1115
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:03,745
You gotta learn to be
a right-handed fighter.

1116
01:05:03,845 --> 01:05:07,799
Now, this will confuse Apollo,
and it'll protect that bad eye.

1117
01:05:08,884 --> 01:05:11,504
I can't learn how to
fight right-handed no more.

1118
01:05:11,604 --> 01:05:15,925
What's "can't"? There ain't no
"can'ts"! There's no "can'ts."

1119
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:19,595
Now, he will beat you uglier
than you are now.

1120
01:05:19,695 --> 01:05:22,265
Now, listen, you start
fighting right-handed,

1121
01:05:22,365 --> 01:05:23,976
and then you change
suddenly,

1122
01:05:24,076 --> 01:05:27,563
and that'll make history,
but first you gotta get speed.

1123
01:05:27,663 --> 01:05:33,577
Demon speed. Speed's what we
need. We need greasy, fast speed!

1124
01:05:34,203 --> 01:05:37,531
Now, I'll show you a trick how
to get some speed in them legs.

1125
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:39,575
Do you have to wear
that stinking sweatshirt?

1126
01:05:39,675 --> 01:05:41,160
Well, it brings me luck,
you know.

1127
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,120
You know what it brings?
It brings flies.

1128
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,041
Now, listen, I want you
to try... Listen to me.

1129
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,333
I want you to try to
chase this little chicken.

1130
01:05:48,433 --> 01:05:51,235
Well, what do I gotta chase a chicken
for? It's embarrassing, you know.

1131
01:05:51,335 --> 01:05:53,130
First,
because I said so.

1132
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:56,884
And second, because chicken-chasing
is how we always used to train

1133
01:05:56,984 --> 01:05:58,051
in the old days.
Yeah.

1134
01:05:58,151 --> 01:06:01,305
You catch this thing, you can
catch greased lightning. Ready?

1135
01:06:01,405 --> 01:06:04,756
Yeah, well, I'd rather eat it than chase it.
It ain't very mature. Well, if you say so.

1136
01:06:04,856 --> 01:06:08,146
Well, neither are you very mature!
Now, listen, get this thing.

1137
01:06:08,246 --> 01:06:09,516
I'm a fighter.
I ain't a farmer.

1138
01:06:09,616 --> 01:06:11,733
Come on at it!
Go on and get him!

1139
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:16,362
Get him! Get him! Get him! Come on!
What's the matter with you? Get him!

1140
01:06:16,462 --> 01:06:19,073
Pick him up!
Pick him up!

1141
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:20,958
Pull him round!

1142
01:06:22,127 --> 01:06:24,037
What's the matter?
You're so fast.

1143
01:06:24,137 --> 01:06:26,664
Are you standing still or
something? Speed! Speed!

1144
01:06:26,764 --> 01:06:29,459
Can't you catch
a little chicken?

1145
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:33,129
Come on! Move your tail!
Move your tail!

1146
01:06:33,229 --> 01:06:36,216
You look like a girl out there.
What's the matter with you?

1147
01:06:36,316 --> 01:06:38,601
I feel like
a Kentucky fried idiot.

1148
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,224
Wake up, will you? Would you wake up?
Come on. Come on. Give it. Give it.

1149
01:06:44,324 --> 01:06:47,101
Yo, Rock. What's the matter
with my sister?

1150
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:49,145
Well, boy, I wish you'd go talk to her.

1151
01:06:49,245 --> 01:06:52,044
You know, Adrian don't like this none.
She's started crying and everything.

1152
01:06:52,144 --> 01:06:52,960
She don't like
me fighting.

1153
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,360
What's with this
domestic stuff?

1154
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:59,031
Tend to the business, will
you? Jab that till it hurts!

1155
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:02,868
Five hundred times without
stopping. Do you hear me? 500 times.

1156
01:07:02,968 --> 01:07:04,620
Hey, Mick, I want to use my other arm.

1157
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,330
If you do,
I'm gonna chop it off.

1158
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,581
Is that clear?

1159
01:07:07,681 --> 01:07:08,832
I'll figure something.

1160
01:07:08,932 --> 01:07:11,677
Yeah, I wish you would, Paulie.
I appreciate it, you know.

1161
01:07:11,803 --> 01:07:13,671
I'm sorry. Are you finished? Yeah.

1162
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:16,090
Can we go to work?
That would be nice.

1163
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:20,427
Now, hit that bag. Hit it.
Jab it till it hurts. Go ahead.

1164
01:07:20,527 --> 01:07:21,887
Three, four...

1165
01:07:21,987 --> 01:07:25,683
Yeah, I want
500 high ones. Go!

1166
01:07:25,783 --> 01:07:27,234
Where was I?
Seven or eight?

1167
01:07:30,363 --> 01:07:33,899
One, two. One, two. One,
two. Come on. Turn it over.

1168
01:07:33,999 --> 01:07:39,663
Come on. Snap it. Come
on. Come on. Dig! Dig! Dig!

1169
01:07:40,164 --> 01:07:41,415
All right,
pick it up.

1170
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:47,581
Come on. Pick them up. Pick
them up. Faster! Faster! Faster!

1171
01:07:47,681 --> 01:07:49,674
Come on!
Faster!

1172
01:07:57,559 --> 01:07:58,851
Time!

1173
01:08:04,733 --> 01:08:05,858
Time!

1174
01:08:11,156 --> 01:08:14,400
Get up! Get me another one, all right?

1175
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,986
Come on. You gotta ease up
on these sparring partners.

1176
01:08:17,086 --> 01:08:18,238
You just get me another,
man.

1177
01:08:25,587 --> 01:08:30,215
Time! What's the matter?
That bag too fast for you?

1178
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,970
You're gonna pound that
sass right out of him.

1179
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:47,601
Last time we should have won, but
this time you're gonna be scary, kid.

1180
01:08:47,701 --> 01:08:51,730
You're gonna be a greasy,
fast, Italian monster!

1181
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,607
You're gonna eat lightning!

1182
01:08:53,707 --> 01:08:55,442
You're gonna crap thunder!

1183
01:08:55,542 --> 01:08:58,370
We'll have to put
you in a cage, kid.

1184
01:09:00,498 --> 01:09:02,199
Let's take a break,
Mick, all right?

1185
01:09:02,299 --> 01:09:03,950
Break? What break?

1186
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,244
Where are you going?
We're not finished.

1187
01:09:06,344 --> 01:09:08,830
Hey, I said where
the hell you going?

1188
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,965
I'm talking to myself.

1189
01:09:48,213 --> 01:09:50,748
Speed! Speed!

1190
01:09:50,848 --> 01:09:53,000
Catch that punk!

1191
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:57,714
Speed, damn it, speed! Can't
you catch that little squirt?

1192
01:09:57,814 --> 01:10:01,343
Can't you? Get off your
rear! Get the lead out!

1193
01:10:01,443 --> 01:10:03,262
Move. Move! Fast!

1194
01:10:03,362 --> 01:10:06,974
You look dead out there. If you
can catch that little speedball,

1195
01:10:07,074 --> 01:10:09,226
you're gonna
catch Creed easy.

1196
01:10:09,326 --> 01:10:11,228
Come on! Move! Move!

1197
01:10:11,328 --> 01:10:13,397
All right. Time!

1198
01:10:13,497 --> 01:10:15,991
Hey, dead ass.
Get over here.

1199
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:20,495
Hey, you sick, kid?

1200
01:10:21,247 --> 01:10:24,158
Kid, what's the matter
with you?

1201
01:10:24,258 --> 01:10:25,659
Nothing.

1202
01:10:25,759 --> 01:10:27,745
Let me tell you
something, kid.

1203
01:10:27,845 --> 01:10:30,338
Now, for a 45-minute fight,

1204
01:10:30,465 --> 01:10:34,753
you gotta train hard
for 45,000 minutes.

1205
01:10:34,853 --> 01:10:40,341
Forty-five thousand. That's 10 weeks.
That's 10 hours a day. You listening?

1206
01:10:40,441 --> 01:10:42,927
And you ain't
even trained one.

1207
01:10:43,027 --> 01:10:46,806
I don't know what the hell you're
waiting for. What are you waiting for?

1208
01:10:46,906 --> 01:10:48,933
I don't know.

1209
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:51,027
Suit yourself.

1210
01:10:52,488 --> 01:10:54,272
Yo, Rocky.

1211
01:10:54,372 --> 01:10:56,775
Hey, yo, Paulie.
How you doing?

1212
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:58,429
I'm worried about you.
I've been watching.

1213
01:10:58,529 --> 01:10:59,444
What?

1214
01:10:59,544 --> 01:11:01,529
Your head ain't
screwed on right.

1215
01:11:01,629 --> 01:11:04,657
Nah, come on. I'm doing okay.
You know, I've been thinking.

1216
01:11:04,757 --> 01:11:06,618
You know, would you like
to work my corner?

1217
01:11:06,718 --> 01:11:09,120
Want to get involved
in this fight, you know?

1218
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,539
Get involved in what?
Watching you get murdered?

1219
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:13,374
Oh, come on.
I'm doing okay.

1220
01:11:13,474 --> 01:11:16,878
Come on. My sister got you so guilty,
you're running all over the place.

1221
01:11:16,978 --> 01:11:18,213
She'll be all right.

1222
01:11:18,313 --> 01:11:19,464
It ain't all right.

1223
01:11:19,564 --> 01:11:21,841
Hey, Paulie, it's okay,
all right?

1224
01:11:21,941 --> 01:11:23,301
It's not okay.

1225
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:25,561
Just leave Adrian alone,
all right?

1226
01:11:36,699 --> 01:11:38,901
Hey, kid,
carry this, will you?

1227
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:42,488
Because I liked you better
when you was carrying spit.

1228
01:11:42,588 --> 01:11:43,989
What's that supposed
to mean?

1229
01:11:44,089 --> 01:11:46,115
It means that you're training
like a ninth-rate pug

1230
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:47,995
who ought to be pumping gas
in Jersey someplace.

1231
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:50,287
Yeah? Yeah, that's what it means.

1232
01:11:50,387 --> 01:11:52,289
I think I'm gonna go
take a shower, Mick.

1233
01:11:52,389 --> 01:11:54,258
That's a good idea.

1234
01:11:54,676 --> 01:11:57,719
Soak your head someplace.
Soak it good.

1235
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:08,556
Yo, Adrian! Where are you?

1236
01:12:08,656 --> 01:12:09,849
Paulie.

1237
01:12:09,949 --> 01:12:12,351
Yeah, Paulie.
What the hell you doing?

1238
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:13,561
What do you mean?

1239
01:12:13,661 --> 01:12:14,728
What the hell you doing?

1240
01:12:14,828 --> 01:12:16,564
About what?

1241
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:18,657
About messing up
that guy over there.

1242
01:12:20,287 --> 01:12:22,767
Don't start with me, Paulie.
I'm just trying to keep him safe.

1243
01:12:22,873 --> 01:12:25,658
Yeah, what? Feeding
these goddamn squirrels?

1244
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:29,203
Did I teach you how to do that?
Ditching the guy when he needs your help?

1245
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,872
I can't believe
my ears.

1246
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,540
You didn't teach
me anything, Paulie.

1247
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,726
You didn't teach me anything,
and I never hurt Rocky.

1248
01:12:34,826 --> 01:12:36,771
You're messing up his brain
real bad. You know that?

1249
01:12:36,871 --> 01:12:37,795
That's not what I'm doing.

1250
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,202
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1251
01:12:39,302 --> 01:12:40,089
Yeah, don't tell me!

1252
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,049
He's gonna get
hurt because of you!

1253
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,217
It's not true.

1254
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,385
Don't say that!

1255
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:45,553
I'm saying it.

1256
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,084
Come across and tell
him it's all right.

1257
01:12:47,184 --> 01:12:48,264
It's not all right,
Paulie.

1258
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:52,359
If he goes blind, you walk away.
I can't. I love him. You don't!

1259
01:12:57,908 --> 01:13:00,568
What are you doing?

1260
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:04,830
What are you doing? What's
wrong? Adrian, what's the matter?

1261
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:11,078
Come on.
Where are your guts?

1262
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,122
What's your problem,
Mick?

1263
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,083
My problem?
Yeah.

1264
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:18,921
You got the problem, kid.
You got a ticker problem.

1265
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:21,673
What's the matter? You
got nothing left inside?

1266
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:25,510
'Cause you're training like
a damn bum, you know that?

1267
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,604
Bum?
A bum.

1268
01:13:29,357 --> 01:13:32,100
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I ain't got it no more.

1269
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:36,939
All right. Then don't you waste
my time no more. You hear that?

1270
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:40,025
Go away! Go back to the
docks where you belong.

1271
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:43,612
You go back to
being a two-bit nothing!

1272
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:48,951
But don't you ever come back here again,
because I'm too old to waste my time

1273
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:52,371
trying to train a no-good
loser like you, you bum!

1274
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:54,107
Hey, Rock, they want
you across the street.

1275
01:13:54,207 --> 01:13:57,008
What's the matter?
Your wife's sick.

1276
01:14:06,227 --> 01:14:08,805
Mr. Balboa?
I'm Dr. Cooper.

1277
01:14:08,905 --> 01:14:11,891
The baby is fine, even
though it's a month premature.

1278
01:14:11,991 --> 01:14:13,893
What is it?
It's a boy.

1279
01:14:13,993 --> 01:14:15,812
Holy smoke. I didn't
know she could do it.

1280
01:14:15,912 --> 01:14:18,564
Yeah, well, how is
Adrian? Where is Adrian?

1281
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:20,992
She's had complications.

1282
01:14:22,828 --> 01:14:24,153
Like what?

1283
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:26,656
Your wife was hemorrhaging
when she was brought in.

1284
01:14:26,756 --> 01:14:31,160
The premature delivery was most
likely caused by straining or overwork,

1285
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,423
and the sudden loss of blood has
caused her to slip into a coma.

1286
01:15:05,456 --> 01:15:07,457
Adrian, it's me.

1287
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:17,717
They said outside
you're very sick, but I...

1288
01:15:18,677 --> 01:15:20,970
I don't want to
believe that.

1289
01:15:23,307 --> 01:15:25,767
Maybe you're just tired,
you know.

1290
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:34,976
Don't worry about nothing. You just
sleep as long as you want, okay?

1291
01:15:35,076 --> 01:15:37,945
And I'm gonna be
here when you wake up.

1292
01:15:46,955 --> 01:15:49,324
Rocky, come on. You're
not doing any good here.

1293
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:50,575
No, I can't...

1294
01:15:50,675 --> 01:15:52,744
Let's go see the kid.
Adrian would want it.

1295
01:15:52,844 --> 01:15:55,172
No. We gotta see
him together.

1296
01:15:56,424 --> 01:15:59,468
It's okay. We gotta
see him together.

1297
01:16:14,025 --> 01:16:17,694
Mr. Balboa,
visiting hours are over.

1298
01:16:18,696 --> 01:16:21,031
Can't I stay?
I'll be quiet.

1299
01:16:22,617 --> 01:16:25,536
I'm sorry.
Hospital rules.

1300
01:16:27,872 --> 01:16:30,332
I can't do any more
of this watching stuff.

1301
01:16:37,257 --> 01:16:39,258
Do you have a chapel?

1302
01:16:40,176 --> 01:16:42,177
Yes, we do.

1303
01:16:50,396 --> 01:16:52,397
Good night.

1304
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:17,256
Rock,

1305
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,885
it's 3:00 in the morning.

1306
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:28,009
You know that I
went up to your house.

1307
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:30,102
They told me you was here.

1308
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:33,856
It's 3:00 a.m., kid.

1309
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:39,445
That Adrian,
she's a good girl.

1310
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:44,534
Me, you know, I'm sorry
for both of you.

1311
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:53,585
Well, ain't nothing I can
do, is there? Except...

1312
01:17:56,297 --> 01:18:01,835
I'd like to tell you something once,
and then I ain't gonna say it again.

1313
01:18:01,935 --> 01:18:05,138
Well, Rocky,
you got another shot.

1314
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,934
It's a second shot at the...

1315
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:13,813
I don't know, the biggest
title in the world.

1316
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:18,435
And you're gonna
be swapping punches

1317
01:18:18,535 --> 01:18:22,072
with the most dangerous
fighter in the world.

1318
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:28,828
And just in case, you know,
your brain ain't working so good,

1319
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:34,960
all this happens pretty soon.
And you ain't ready.

1320
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,832
You're nowhere near
in shape.

1321
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:44,212
So, I say, you know,
for God's sake,

1322
01:18:44,312 --> 01:18:48,800
why don't you stand up and fight
this guy hard, like you done before?

1323
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,227
That was beautiful!

1324
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:56,391
But don't lay down in
front of him like this!

1325
01:18:56,491 --> 01:19:00,645
Like a... I don't know, like
some kind of mongrel or something.

1326
01:19:00,745 --> 01:19:04,274
'Cause he's gonna
kick your face in pieces.

1327
01:19:04,374 --> 01:19:09,237
You know that? That's right. This
guy just don't want to win, you know.

1328
01:19:09,337 --> 01:19:12,365
He wants to bury you.
He wants to humiliate you.

1329
01:19:12,465 --> 01:19:14,450
He wants to prove
to the whole world

1330
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:19,290
that it was nothing but some kind
of a freak the first time out.

1331
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:22,384
He said you're
a one-time lucky bum.

1332
01:19:25,888 --> 01:19:29,391
Well, now, I don't...

1333
01:19:30,394 --> 01:19:36,141
I don't want to get mad
in a biblical place like this,

1334
01:19:36,241 --> 01:19:40,945
but I think you're a hell of a lot
more than that, kid. A hell of a lot.

1335
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:51,031
But, now, wait a minute.
If you want to blow it...

1336
01:19:51,131 --> 01:19:56,044
If you want to blow this thing,
damn it, I'm gonna blow it with you.

1337
01:19:57,463 --> 01:20:02,383
Do you want to stay here? I'll
stay with you. I'll stay with you.

1338
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,845
Yeah.

1339
01:20:09,099 --> 01:20:12,977
I'll stay and pray.
What have I got to lose?

1340
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,545
It's gonna be okay.

1341
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:36,639
"There ain't no other trail to
the ranch, or no shorter one.

1342
01:21:36,739 --> 01:21:39,851
"'Oh, yes, there is,'
said Marvel.

1343
01:21:39,951 --> 01:21:42,270
"'When I was a kid,
I helped my old man

1344
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:46,190
"'trail some cattle
up from the border."'

1345
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:51,162
Can you hear me, Adrian? Keep
listening. Keep listening.

1346
01:21:53,373 --> 01:21:58,244
"After breakfast, Bruce watched
the party get away on the chase.

1347
01:21:58,344 --> 01:22:02,665
"He saw Cora
and Kay and Bud

1348
01:22:02,765 --> 01:22:06,878
"start up the valley 15
minutes ahead of the others.

1349
01:22:06,978 --> 01:22:09,797
"At the last minute,
the girl..."

1350
01:22:09,897 --> 01:22:14,352
"Replied Olga, 'Buck Mason?
Who is he?'

1351
01:22:17,106 --> 01:22:22,944
"White pointed towards Marvel, who
was leading the horses to the corral."

1352
01:22:37,418 --> 01:22:40,204
Well, I just wrote this
thing for you, Adrian.

1353
01:22:40,304 --> 01:22:45,542
I don't know. Maybe you'll like it.
I'll just read it to you, 'cause...

1354
01:22:45,642 --> 01:22:49,046
"Remember when we
was on ice skates,

1355
01:22:49,146 --> 01:22:52,674
"and I thought you were
supposed to be great,

1356
01:22:52,774 --> 01:22:56,512
"but I kept giving you lip
and you kept trying to slip,

1357
01:22:56,612 --> 01:22:59,139
"so I could catch you?

1358
01:22:59,239 --> 01:23:04,854
"That was our first date. And
after that every day was great.

1359
01:23:04,954 --> 01:23:09,692
"So now I want you to know
that wherever you go,

1360
01:23:09,792 --> 01:23:15,782
"Atlantic City or in the snow,
don't worry about a thing.

1361
01:23:15,882 --> 01:23:20,836
"'Cause as long as I got this ring,
I'll always be there to catch you."

1362
01:24:33,579 --> 01:24:35,580
I knew you'd come back.

1363
01:24:45,507 --> 01:24:47,508
Thank you, God.

1364
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:55,885
Anybody want a refill? Adrian,
it costs six bucks a bottle.

1365
01:24:55,985 --> 01:24:57,928
I don't need that.
I ain't drinking now.

1366
01:24:58,028 --> 01:24:59,889
So, you haven't
seen the baby?

1367
01:24:59,989 --> 01:25:01,664
No, come on. I was waiting
to... I've seen him.

1368
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:02,808
...see him together.

1369
01:25:02,908 --> 01:25:07,063
Hey, the kid's a winner. He's
got forearms like him, Mickey.

1370
01:25:07,163 --> 01:25:09,231
Here he is now. Look.

1371
01:25:09,331 --> 01:25:10,574
Oh, no.

1372
01:25:12,744 --> 01:25:13,819
There's your mommy.

1373
01:25:13,919 --> 01:25:14,995
Oh, baby!

1374
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:20,000
Is that it?

1375
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:25,122
I can't believe it.
He's ours?

1376
01:25:25,222 --> 01:25:26,207
Yeah.

1377
01:25:26,307 --> 01:25:28,334
He's really ours?
Thank you.

1378
01:25:28,434 --> 01:25:32,755
Come on. You done all the work.
Adrian, I can't believe you done this.

1379
01:25:32,855 --> 01:25:34,590
Believe me, we did.

1380
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:36,342
Oh, no.
He ain't got a name.

1381
01:25:36,442 --> 01:25:38,010
What do you want
to call him?

1382
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,846
Paulie's a great name.

1383
01:25:40,946 --> 01:25:43,808
Yeah,
Paulie's a pretty good name.

1384
01:25:43,908 --> 01:25:45,644
What about after the father?

1385
01:25:45,744 --> 01:25:47,396
Rocky, Jr?

1386
01:25:47,496 --> 01:25:48,826
Come on. You really want to do that?

1387
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:50,023
Yes.

1388
01:25:50,123 --> 01:25:53,952
Adrian, he's the best I ever
seen. You really done good.

1389
01:25:55,871 --> 01:25:59,366
You look so tired. Why
don't you go get some sleep?

1390
01:25:59,466 --> 01:26:03,203
Oh, no, no. I feel great. I feel
great. Listen, I been thinking.

1391
01:26:03,303 --> 01:26:06,790
If you don't want me
mixing with Creed no more,

1392
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:10,545
we'll make out some other
kind of way, you know.

1393
01:26:10,645 --> 01:26:12,505
There's one thing
I want you to do for me.

1394
01:26:12,605 --> 01:26:14,473
What?
Come here.

1395
01:26:15,392 --> 01:26:16,592
What?

1396
01:26:16,692 --> 01:26:17,852
Win.

1397
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:22,432
Win.

1398
01:26:22,532 --> 01:26:24,984
What are we waiting for?
Take us!

1399
01:27:02,023 --> 01:27:03,648
Faster! Faster!

1400
01:27:06,527 --> 01:27:09,654
Keep moving!
Keep moving! Faster.

1401
01:27:10,573 --> 01:27:12,908
Pick them up!
Pick them up!

1402
01:27:16,412 --> 01:27:19,664
That's it.
That's it. Yeah.

1403
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:21,867
Speed! Speed!

1404
01:27:21,967 --> 01:27:23,835
Come on! Come on!

1405
01:27:25,129 --> 01:27:26,580
Don't be a slouch.

1406
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,040
Fifty-eight, 59...

1407
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,416
One more!
Come on, man!

1408
01:27:29,516 --> 01:27:31,293
Push. Push.

1409
01:27:31,393 --> 01:27:35,089
Forty-four, 45, 46.
Yeah!

1410
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:39,894
Forty-seven,
48, 49, 50!

1411
01:27:56,537 --> 01:28:01,282
Again! Again! Now get that out of here!

1412
01:28:01,382 --> 01:28:04,452
Come on! Push!
Don't give up!

1413
01:28:04,552 --> 01:28:06,337
Get that olive oil
out of you!

1414
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:08,840
Push!

1415
01:28:10,175 --> 01:28:12,927
Twenty-seven, 28...

1416
01:28:16,473 --> 01:28:19,433
Forty-one, 42, 43...

1417
01:28:20,018 --> 01:28:21,644
Forty-six, 47...

1418
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:24,772
Push! Push!
Again!

1419
01:28:27,861 --> 01:28:29,279
Left! Right!

1420
01:28:38,247 --> 01:28:40,156
Yeah! Yeah!

1421
01:28:40,256 --> 01:28:41,749
Speed!

1422
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,840
Speed!
Speed! Speed!

1423
01:29:11,322 --> 01:29:12,989
Good night.

1424
01:29:34,179 --> 01:29:35,804
Hey, Rocky!

1425
01:29:50,946 --> 01:29:52,605
Hey, Rocky!

1426
01:29:52,705 --> 01:29:54,365
Rocky, you gotta put
him down this time!

1427
01:30:13,176 --> 01:30:15,011
Come on, come on!

1428
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:35,218
I'm up!

1429
01:31:45,605 --> 01:31:51,651
Rocky! Rocky!

1430
01:32:41,161 --> 01:32:43,907
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Bill Baldwin speaking to you

1431
01:32:44,007 --> 01:32:46,116
from the magnificent Spectrum
here in Philadelphia,

1432
01:32:46,216 --> 01:32:47,575
the site of Superfight II,

1433
01:32:47,675 --> 01:32:49,160
with Rocky Balboa,
the challenger,

1434
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:52,205
and of course Apollo Creed,
the world champion.

1435
01:32:52,305 --> 01:32:55,209
My sidekick and partner
again tonight, Stu Nahan.

1436
01:32:55,309 --> 01:32:58,191
Thank you, Bill, and for those of you
who are watching tonight's telecast,

1437
01:32:58,291 --> 01:33:02,057
we think you're gonna see a real great
battle in every sense of the word.

1438
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:09,774
Don't worry about nothing.
It's okay.

1439
01:33:13,904 --> 01:33:15,280
I gotta go.

1440
01:33:18,534 --> 01:33:21,911
Adrian, I wish the doctor
would let you go to this fight.

1441
01:33:22,746 --> 01:33:23,913
Me, too.

1442
01:33:25,082 --> 01:33:28,994
You're the man. You're number one.
The champ. The best of all time.

1443
01:33:29,094 --> 01:33:31,663
The girls love you.
Men, old people love you.

1444
01:33:31,763 --> 01:33:34,583
Young people love you. You're
the best. You're the man.

1445
01:33:34,683 --> 01:33:37,043
And he's yours. He's yours. He's yours.

1446
01:33:37,143 --> 01:33:39,671
This bum shouldn't even be
in the same ring with you.

1447
01:33:39,771 --> 01:33:41,590
I want you to show him
who you are tonight.

1448
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:44,184
Show him who you are
tonight. Stick him.

1449
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,227
Go, Rocky, go!

1450
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,026
Now, listen, Paulie, you're gonna
help out with the baby tonight, right?

1451
01:33:58,126 --> 01:33:59,084
I'll take care
of everything.

1452
01:33:59,184 --> 01:34:01,595
Okay, you just take care of everything
now because you're in charge.

1453
01:34:01,695 --> 01:34:04,197
I'll take care of the dumb house.
You're gonna be late for your own fight.

1454
01:34:04,297 --> 01:34:05,573
Everything's gonna
be fine.

1455
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:08,242
Well, maybe I'd
better go fight now.

1456
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:09,785
I love you.

1457
01:34:09,885 --> 01:34:11,287
I love you, too.

1458
01:34:11,387 --> 01:34:12,538
Punch his lungs out.

1459
01:34:12,638 --> 01:34:14,207
Adrian,
I wish you could go.

1460
01:34:14,307 --> 01:34:15,708
The doctor said no.

1461
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,078
I got
the doctor's instructions.

1462
01:34:17,178 --> 01:34:19,053
Take care.
Good luck.

1463
01:34:34,986 --> 01:34:38,022
The champion has let it be
known to the press and radio

1464
01:34:38,122 --> 01:34:41,158
that he is in the best shape
of his illustrious career.

1465
01:34:44,872 --> 01:34:47,366
And Rocky Balboa, I know,
is a 5-to-1 underdog.

1466
01:34:47,466 --> 01:34:50,077
I know he's still a street
brawler from Philadelphia.

1467
01:34:50,177 --> 01:34:53,205
But can he repeat that incredible
performance of 10 months ago?

1468
01:34:53,305 --> 01:34:57,425
And, you know, he took a real
beating at the hands of the champion.

1469
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:00,929
Carmine!

1470
01:35:02,598 --> 01:35:06,093
Hey, yo, Father Carmine!
Father Carmine!

1471
01:35:06,193 --> 01:35:08,220
Hey, Father Carmine,
are you home?

1472
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:11,189
Father Carmine!
Hey, yo, Father Carmine!

1473
01:35:12,358 --> 01:35:14,643
It's me, Rocky Balboa.

1474
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:16,069
Rocky?
Yeah.

1475
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:21,419
Oh, yeah, I'm going
to the fight right now,

1476
01:35:21,534 --> 01:35:24,453
but I was wondering if you could
do me a small favor, you know.

1477
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:27,397
Well, it's about the fight,
you know?

1478
01:35:27,497 --> 01:35:29,468
Now I got the family and
the baby and all that stuff.

1479
01:35:29,568 --> 01:35:32,328
And I was wondering, you know, if
you could throw down a blessing,

1480
01:35:32,428 --> 01:35:36,667
so that if I get beat up tonight, you
know, it won't be too bad, you know?

1481
01:35:36,767 --> 01:35:39,177
Could you do
something like that?

1482
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:47,097
Thanks a lot, Father. Listen, I
appreciate it. I gotta go. I'm so late.

1483
01:35:47,197 --> 01:35:49,563
I'll see you in church,
I hope. Take care.

1484
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:10,284
Hey, Rock.

1485
01:36:10,384 --> 01:36:11,543
Good luck, son.

1486
01:36:11,794 --> 01:36:14,163
Yo, Mick! Run, or I'll break your head!

1487
01:36:14,263 --> 01:36:16,373
Where you been? You lost
your brain or something?

1488
01:36:16,473 --> 01:36:17,662
We got a fight,
remember that?

1489
01:36:17,762 --> 01:36:19,335
I'm sorry. I'm here.

1490
01:36:19,435 --> 01:36:21,879
Get dressed, will you?
There's a million people...

1491
01:36:21,979 --> 01:36:24,298
Stu, there are many rumors
circulating about this fight.

1492
01:36:24,398 --> 01:36:28,260
Well, the most obvious being a definite
desire for Apollo to draw first blood,

1493
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,470
to end it quickly.

1494
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:32,807
This would prove his claim
that the last fight was a fluke.

1495
01:36:32,907 --> 01:36:36,069
Come on, lightning hands!
Hurricane! Hurricane!

1496
01:36:43,118 --> 01:36:44,952
Get him. Get him.
I'm gonna get him.

1497
01:36:45,079 --> 01:36:46,967
Gonna get him. Gonna get
him. He's ours! He's ours!

1498
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:48,354
Gonna get him.
He's ours! He's ours!

1499
01:36:52,544 --> 01:36:53,586
It's time, kid.

1500
01:37:01,804 --> 01:37:03,471
Okay, let's do it.

1501
01:37:04,306 --> 01:37:06,140
All right, I'm ready.

1502
01:37:12,147 --> 01:37:14,282
You know, I think I'm starting
to get a headache here.

1503
01:37:14,382 --> 01:37:16,851
No, you are in
perfect working condition.

1504
01:37:16,951 --> 01:37:18,895
You are perfect.
Yeah, you look good, too.

1505
01:37:18,995 --> 01:37:21,439
Yeah, thanks. And you
look perfect. Perfect.

1506
01:37:21,539 --> 01:37:23,233
Hey, Mick. Hey, Mick.
Yeah. Yeah.

1507
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:24,527
In case I don't get a chance,

1508
01:37:24,627 --> 01:37:27,822
I just want to say I'm gonna be
trying hard for you today, okay?

1509
01:37:27,922 --> 01:37:29,824
Thank you.

1510
01:37:29,924 --> 01:37:31,492
Ain't this robe nice?

1511
01:37:31,592 --> 01:37:33,207
It's better than last year,
that's for sure.

1512
01:37:33,307 --> 01:37:34,383
Remember that
baggy one last year?

1513
01:37:34,483 --> 01:37:36,080
This is gorgeous.
It's perfect.

1514
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,623
Yeah, it's real cute.
I like it.

1515
01:37:37,723 --> 01:37:39,341
Yeah. Okay.

1516
01:37:44,348 --> 01:37:47,092
Yes, Rocky Balboa
heading toward the ring now.

1517
01:37:47,192 --> 01:37:51,096
Yes, sir. Rocky Balboa, known to
millions as the Italian Stallion,

1518
01:37:51,196 --> 01:37:54,933
making his way to the ring. Why
this fighter of limited ability

1519
01:37:55,033 --> 01:37:58,186
has gained such popularity
is such a mystery.

1520
01:37:58,286 --> 01:38:01,189
Rocky Balboa, and the
folks here at the Spectrum

1521
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:03,191
are beginning to
chant his name.

1522
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:05,610
He has an awful
lot of backers here.

1523
01:38:05,710 --> 01:38:08,405
Balboa is wearing
a black and gold robe.

1524
01:38:08,505 --> 01:38:12,117
He wore a red one the last time
from that meat-packing plant.

1525
01:38:12,217 --> 01:38:15,036
Some said that was from the high
school that he never graduated from.

1526
01:38:15,136 --> 01:38:16,163
31 years of age.

1527
01:38:16,263 --> 01:38:19,542
There he is over shaking hands
with the referee, Lou Filippo.

1528
01:38:19,642 --> 01:38:22,219
And we're waiting now for the
champion to come into the ring.

1529
01:38:22,971 --> 01:38:25,256
Rocky! Rocky!

1530
01:38:25,356 --> 01:38:27,633
Rocky! Rocky!

1531
01:38:27,733 --> 01:38:30,011
This area is certainly packed
with Rocky's people.

1532
01:38:30,111 --> 01:38:33,139
I've never seen so many
Italians in one place in my life!

1533
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:34,876
Hey, hey. You said that.
I didn't say that.

1534
01:38:34,976 --> 01:38:35,932
Rocky! Rocky!
Rocky! Rocky!

1535
01:38:36,032 --> 01:38:37,977
These people are for you,
Rock! I appreciate it.

1536
01:38:38,077 --> 01:38:39,103
Are you ready
in here?

1537
01:38:39,203 --> 01:38:40,167
I think so.

1538
01:38:40,267 --> 01:38:42,148
Yeah, well, tonight's
our night, kid.

1539
01:38:42,248 --> 01:38:46,319
By the sound of the crowd, the champion
is just now coming into the Spectrum.

1540
01:38:46,419 --> 01:38:48,654
And the champion,
Apollo Creed.

1541
01:38:48,754 --> 01:38:53,242
And he looks a little more determined
this time than he did the last time.

1542
01:38:53,342 --> 01:38:55,203
It's Apollo.
Who'd you expect?

1543
01:38:55,303 --> 01:38:57,546
I was hoping
he wouldn't show.

1544
01:39:01,593 --> 01:39:03,836
The champ
of all time!

1545
01:39:03,936 --> 01:39:06,172
Now the champion is
climbing into the ring.

1546
01:39:06,272 --> 01:39:09,975
Very determined-looking.
Very serious right now.

1547
01:39:10,185 --> 01:39:12,012
Rocky doesn't look as
confident as he might.

1548
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:17,651
Apollo Creed, the master of
disaster, the best of all time!

1549
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:24,115
You're going down, man.
You're going down.

1550
01:39:25,076 --> 01:39:27,160
Don't let it bother you,
kid.

1551
01:39:27,286 --> 01:39:28,549
Would it bother you?

1552
01:39:28,649 --> 01:39:29,655
Yeah.

1553
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:32,616
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

1554
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:36,127
and welcome to
the Philadelphia Spectrum!

1555
01:39:37,964 --> 01:39:41,166
This is your main
event of the evening,

1556
01:39:41,266 --> 01:39:46,263
15 rounds for the heavyweight
championship of the world!

1557
01:39:50,476 --> 01:39:57,349
In the black corner, the
challenger, weighing 202 pounds,

1558
01:39:57,449 --> 01:40:01,186
from the great fighting city
of Philadelphia,

1559
01:40:01,286 --> 01:40:06,785
the Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa!

1560
01:40:18,339 --> 01:40:23,586
And in the red corner,
weighing 220 pounds,

1561
01:40:23,686 --> 01:40:29,091
a champion who needs no introduction
anywhere in the civilized world,

1562
01:40:29,191 --> 01:40:32,303
the true master of disaster,

1563
01:40:32,403 --> 01:40:36,599
the undefeated heavyweight
champion of the world,

1564
01:40:36,699 --> 01:40:43,030
the one, the only,
Apollo Creed!

1565
01:40:47,827 --> 01:40:51,246
Referee Lou Filippo
will give the instructions.

1566
01:41:01,175 --> 01:41:04,461
Okay, boys, I'm gonna give
you the instructions now,

1567
01:41:04,561 --> 01:41:06,046
and I expect you
to follow them.

1568
01:41:06,146 --> 01:41:09,466
Watch your low punches and
watch your kidney punches.

1569
01:41:09,566 --> 01:41:10,759
Watch your
rabbit punches.

1570
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:13,303
In case of a knockdown, you
go to the corner I tell you to

1571
01:41:13,403 --> 01:41:15,805
and stay there until I tell
you to come out, understand?

1572
01:41:15,905 --> 01:41:18,483
Okay, boys. Let's have
a good fight.

1573
01:41:20,069 --> 01:41:21,736
You're going down.

1574
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,864
You can do it, Rocky!

1575
01:41:25,032 --> 01:41:26,783
Good luck to you.

1576
01:41:28,702 --> 01:41:29,736
He's still upset.

1577
01:41:29,836 --> 01:41:31,655
Who cares? Now, listen,
protect that eye.

1578
01:41:31,755 --> 01:41:35,325
And no matter what happens, don't go
back to fighting southpaw till I tell you.

1579
01:41:35,425 --> 01:41:37,077
Now, you get him.
Okay.

1580
01:41:37,177 --> 01:41:38,286
Good luck.

1581
01:41:38,386 --> 01:41:39,632
Now he's gonna try
to kill you quick.

1582
01:41:39,732 --> 01:41:42,298
If you get through this
first round, then he's ours.

1583
01:41:42,424 --> 01:41:44,384
Okay. Show him who you are.

1584
01:41:50,391 --> 01:41:54,303
As Rocky Balboa prays in his corner,
the champion dancing over in his corner,

1585
01:41:54,403 --> 01:41:57,156
we're just seconds away from the
fight of the century, Superfight II.

1586
01:41:57,982 --> 01:41:59,233
And there's the bell.

1587
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:02,478
And the champion
comes over in a hurry now,

1588
01:42:02,578 --> 01:42:04,542
and throws a couple of
rights and lefts out there.

1589
01:42:04,642 --> 01:42:06,482
He starts to take
command early here.

1590
01:42:06,582 --> 01:42:10,403
And now, he kind of moves his feet
along the side of the ring now.

1591
01:42:10,503 --> 01:42:13,406
Rocky's holding that right
hand. He's fighting right-handed!

1592
01:42:13,506 --> 01:42:17,960
I don't believe it. The southpaw
from Philly is fighting right-handed!

1593
01:42:20,965 --> 01:42:34,428
Rocky! Rocky!

1594
01:42:34,528 --> 01:42:37,564
Break that damn jab!
Protect that eye!

1595
01:42:40,901 --> 01:42:42,422
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?

1596
01:42:42,522 --> 01:42:43,770
Break it up there.

1597
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:45,063
You ain't got nothing.

1598
01:42:45,163 --> 01:42:46,365
Break it up.

1599
01:42:46,491 --> 01:42:47,900
You ready to
lay down?

1600
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,778
A good right hand followed by
another right and another right

1601
01:42:50,878 --> 01:42:51,988
thrown by the champion.

1602
01:42:52,088 --> 01:42:54,907
Three good right
hands bang at Balboa.

1603
01:42:55,007 --> 01:42:56,931
They're in the corner,
and there's left to right.

1604
01:42:57,031 --> 01:42:58,911
Here comes Balboa
coming back at him.

1605
01:42:59,011 --> 01:43:01,748
A left and a right to the head,
and now back off of the ropes.

1606
01:43:01,848 --> 01:43:03,583
Balboa appears to
be getting hit often,

1607
01:43:03,683 --> 01:43:06,461
but he seems to be
in pretty good condition.

1608
01:43:06,561 --> 01:43:09,505
A hard right hand thrown by
the champion. Another right.

1609
01:43:09,605 --> 01:43:12,300
Balboa is in trouble now.
He's in trouble.

1610
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,928
Taking rights and lefts as
the champion begins to open up.

1611
01:43:16,028 --> 01:43:19,056
It was a tremendous
right hand. Balboa is down!

1612
01:43:19,156 --> 01:43:21,150
Down goes Balboa!

1613
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:23,235
Get back.

1614
01:43:23,487 --> 01:43:27,315
We see Apollo hit that bad left
eye, remember, from the first fight.

1615
01:43:27,415 --> 01:43:30,543
That's the eye that was cut the last
time. Balboa getting up rather unsteadily.

1616
01:43:30,643 --> 01:43:31,778
Go get him!

1617
01:43:31,878 --> 01:43:34,113
Go after him, kid!
Go after him!

1618
01:43:34,213 --> 01:43:35,206
Yeah.

1619
01:43:36,666 --> 01:43:40,162
And the champion starts to move
in again. Going right, left.

1620
01:43:40,262 --> 01:43:44,625
He's taking those punches pretty well.
And now Balboa just comes right back!

1621
01:43:44,725 --> 01:43:46,376
Tossed the ref right
into the ring post.

1622
01:43:46,476 --> 01:43:48,754
Coming out now,
he wants at him.

1623
01:43:48,854 --> 01:43:52,299
Balboa's tagged. Left, left, and
right combinations by the champion.

1624
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:55,636
Another left. He's leaning
back, but there's the bell!

1625
01:43:55,736 --> 01:43:57,270
There's the end
of the round.

1626
01:44:00,233 --> 01:44:03,068
There's a lot of
bad blood between these two.

1627
01:44:03,861 --> 01:44:05,479
Good round.
Good round.

1628
01:44:05,579 --> 01:44:06,897
I can't believe it.
What?

1629
01:44:06,997 --> 01:44:08,649
He broke my nose again.

1630
01:44:08,749 --> 01:44:11,819
Balboa has gotta be in great
shape to withstand that butchery.

1631
01:44:11,919 --> 01:44:15,330
Man, I'll tell you, that's just
what it is. It's plain old butchery.

1632
01:44:15,748 --> 01:44:17,595
Did the switching bother
you? Nothing bothered me.

1633
01:44:17,695 --> 01:44:18,977
All right, but then you
should have had him.

1634
01:44:19,077 --> 01:44:20,327
You can't be hurt.

1635
01:44:20,427 --> 01:44:22,788
You follow? You can't be
hurt, 'cause you are too tough.

1636
01:44:22,888 --> 01:44:25,207
Now don't let up on this man.
This man is dangerous.

1637
01:44:25,307 --> 01:44:26,740
This man is dangerous?
I'm dangerous.

1638
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,168
The man is dangerous.

1639
01:44:28,268 --> 01:44:29,711
That guy is great.

1640
01:44:29,811 --> 01:44:31,255
No. Listen,
he's only a man.

1641
01:44:31,355 --> 01:44:34,267
You can beat him
because you're a tank.

1642
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:37,971
You're a greasy, fast,
200-pound Italian tank.

1643
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:40,182
Go through him!
Run over him!

1644
01:44:40,282 --> 01:44:42,401
I'm a tank.
I'm gonna get him.

1645
01:44:42,986 --> 01:44:44,895
This is it, man!
The best of all time!

1646
01:44:44,995 --> 01:44:46,405
Here we go.
Round two.

1647
01:44:47,365 --> 01:44:50,234
Round two. The champion comes back
out. He's leaning across again.

1648
01:44:50,334 --> 01:44:52,046
Starting with a left
and a left and a left.

1649
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:54,929
Left to the chin, left to the head.
Left to the chin, left to the head.

1650
01:44:55,029 --> 01:44:56,784
Coming around now.
Just holding that right hand.

1651
01:44:56,884 --> 01:44:57,908
He's got it cocked.

1652
01:44:58,008 --> 01:45:00,360
He's just waiting for that
precise moment that he wants to...

1653
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:03,213
There it is! He unloaded
that, but here comes Balboa!

1654
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:08,586
You can't hurt me. He
can't hurt me! No way!

1655
01:45:08,686 --> 01:45:10,971
Break it up.
Break it up.

1656
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:13,716
Break it up.
Break clean.

1657
01:45:13,816 --> 01:45:15,142
Come on, come on.

1658
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:18,979
You're too slow!
Man, you're too slow!

1659
01:45:19,981 --> 01:45:24,192
Get your cameras ready. Watch this
now. Watch this. He's going down.

1660
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,530
Here it comes!

1661
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:36,039
Down he goes!

1662
01:45:36,165 --> 01:45:37,324
Rocky!

1663
01:45:37,424 --> 01:45:39,326
Get up, Rock! Get up!

1664
01:45:39,426 --> 01:45:43,171
Balboa for the second time
is down, struggling to get up.

1665
01:45:43,714 --> 01:45:47,292
Don't get up. Just stay down
there. Just stay down there, chump!

1666
01:45:47,392 --> 01:45:48,376
I told you!

1667
01:45:48,476 --> 01:45:49,440
Beautiful!

1668
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:52,589
Six,
seven, eight...

1669
01:45:52,689 --> 01:45:55,175
Protect that eye, kid!
Get at it!

1670
01:45:55,275 --> 01:45:57,032
The body, the body, the body!
You're a tank, kid!

1671
01:45:57,132 --> 01:45:58,386
Let's go, Rock.
Yeah.

1672
01:45:58,486 --> 01:46:00,355
I told you! I told you!

1673
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:04,559
And here comes
the champion...

1674
01:46:04,659 --> 01:46:05,936
One, two, now.
One, two.

1675
01:46:06,036 --> 01:46:08,653
Here it is. A left and a right and
he's got him back in the corner!

1676
01:46:08,753 --> 01:46:10,023
Balboa's back in the corner!

1677
01:46:10,123 --> 01:46:13,401
But here comes Balboa again!
Where does he get that stamina?

1678
01:46:13,501 --> 01:46:15,612
He's got the champion
trapped in the corner.

1679
01:46:15,712 --> 01:46:18,490
And he's breaking
left and right, left...

1680
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:26,632
Rocky! Rocky!

1681
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:33,597
Keep it up! Keep it up!

1682
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:39,470
I'm standing here.

1683
01:46:39,570 --> 01:46:42,056
A great second round. And
they're taunting each other.

1684
01:46:42,156 --> 01:46:45,559
The bell, the round is over,
but they're taunting each other.

1685
01:46:45,659 --> 01:46:49,029
Everybody in the audience better
get ready for World War III.

1686
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:53,617
I ain't going down
no more.

1687
01:46:53,827 --> 01:46:55,995
Attaboy! Go get him!

1688
01:47:09,135 --> 01:47:10,593
Come on, kid!

1689
01:47:13,431 --> 01:47:14,765
Come on,
break it up!

1690
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:18,344
And the champion
again

1691
01:47:18,444 --> 01:47:22,064
with a combination of lefts
and rights to the head.

1692
01:47:24,026 --> 01:47:25,345
That was another
round for Creed.

1693
01:47:25,445 --> 01:47:28,146
Creed keeps piling
up the points, but...

1694
01:47:28,246 --> 01:47:29,488
Get him, Rock.

1695
01:47:37,748 --> 01:47:38,789
Hit him! Just hit him!

1696
01:47:43,962 --> 01:47:46,422
Another round
for Apollo Creed.

1697
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:59,010
Here comes Balboa
again into the corner.

1698
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:01,645
Lefts and rights to the
midsection, and those hurt.

1699
01:48:07,152 --> 01:48:09,154
Pound
the body!

1700
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:11,281
He's won
another round.

1701
01:48:11,407 --> 01:48:13,158
He now begins to
taunt Balboa again.

1702
01:48:14,535 --> 01:48:15,827
Come on!

1703
01:48:43,689 --> 01:48:45,682
I'm gonna give
that round to Balboa.

1704
01:48:45,782 --> 01:48:48,936
You wonder what's on Apollo
Creed's mind right now.

1705
01:48:49,036 --> 01:48:51,113
He's lost his first round.

1706
01:48:57,161 --> 01:48:58,745
Go for it, Rock!

1707
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,298
Balboa is on his way.

1708
01:49:14,763 --> 01:49:17,800
Hands up! Hands up!
Now, just stick and move!

1709
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:20,302
This man is breaking you up
inside! Now, stick and move!

1710
01:49:20,402 --> 01:49:21,770
Keep your hands up!

1711
01:49:22,730 --> 01:49:24,648
Lightning! Thunder!

1712
01:49:42,584 --> 01:49:43,959
Hit him back!

1713
01:49:47,839 --> 01:49:52,593
I thought he took a beating 10 months
ago, Stu, but tonight it's twice as bad!

1714
01:49:54,095 --> 01:49:57,307
Another round for the
champion, Apollo Creed.

1715
01:49:59,351 --> 01:50:01,678
The left eye is closed.
Now bust him, understand?

1716
01:50:01,778 --> 01:50:02,937
Keep working on him.

1717
01:50:04,815 --> 01:50:06,016
Stay away from him.

1718
01:50:06,116 --> 01:50:08,193
Don't let him breathe!
Get him!

1719
01:50:24,793 --> 01:50:27,795
Balboa's taking another
beating in the corner.

1720
01:50:29,506 --> 01:50:31,841
Another round
for the champion.

1721
01:51:09,631 --> 01:51:11,415
Now come on!
You got him beat on points.

1722
01:51:11,515 --> 01:51:12,887
You understand?
Now, stick and move!

1723
01:51:12,987 --> 01:51:14,001
Don't go for
the knockout!

1724
01:51:14,101 --> 01:51:15,267
He's gonna fall.
He's gonna fall.

1725
01:51:15,367 --> 01:51:18,171
Don't go for the knockout, you understand!
Now he's breaking you up inside!

1726
01:51:18,271 --> 01:51:19,799
How's that eye now?
It works.

1727
01:51:19,899 --> 01:51:21,801
You can't do much more
with that, can you?

1728
01:51:21,901 --> 01:51:23,177
I know what I'm doing.

1729
01:51:23,277 --> 01:51:25,403
Hey, Rock. You get in trouble
one more time, I'm gonna...

1730
01:51:25,503 --> 01:51:26,681
Please don't stop nothing!

1731
01:51:26,781 --> 01:51:28,724
Now, listen,
let me stop it.

1732
01:51:28,824 --> 01:51:30,501
Listen, you're getting
killed out there, kid!

1733
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:31,602
It's my life.

1734
01:51:31,702 --> 01:51:35,740
Apollo well ahead. All he has to do
is stay away and he retains the title.

1735
01:51:35,866 --> 01:51:37,877
Just stick and move. It
ain't gonna be like last time.

1736
01:51:37,977 --> 01:51:39,021
It ain't gonna
be like last time.

1737
01:51:39,121 --> 01:51:40,028
Now you got
three minutes.

1738
01:51:40,128 --> 01:51:42,114
Switch now to southpaw anyway, will you?

1739
01:51:42,214 --> 01:51:43,658
No tricks.
I ain't switching.

1740
01:51:43,758 --> 01:51:44,909
Yeah, but you're
fading out.

1741
01:51:45,009 --> 01:51:46,119
I don't need no tricks.

1742
01:51:46,219 --> 01:51:47,245
All right,
all right.

1743
01:51:47,345 --> 01:51:48,621
I ain't switching.

1744
01:51:48,721 --> 01:51:50,112
You gotta plan.
You gotta switch, kid.

1745
01:51:50,212 --> 01:51:51,916
He's ready.
Believe me.

1746
01:51:52,016 --> 01:51:54,169
Apollo, don't go for the
knockout. You got him burned!

1747
01:51:54,636 --> 01:51:56,170
They come to
the center of the ring

1748
01:51:56,270 --> 01:51:58,298
for the start of
the 15th and final round.

1749
01:51:58,398 --> 01:51:59,632
You're going down.

1750
01:51:59,732 --> 01:52:01,017
No. No way.

1751
01:52:01,768 --> 01:52:02,969
Here we go.

1752
01:52:03,069 --> 01:52:04,721
Let's see what
Creed does here now.

1753
01:52:04,821 --> 01:52:08,182
Creed has started to move in on
Balboa. He's going for the knockout.

1754
01:52:08,282 --> 01:52:10,601
The champion comes out
jabbing with that left hand.

1755
01:52:10,701 --> 01:52:11,848
He's taking
that left hand out.

1756
01:52:11,948 --> 01:52:13,354
The champion is
beating Balboa...

1757
01:52:13,454 --> 01:52:14,947
Now! Now!

1758
01:52:19,411 --> 01:52:21,654
Balboa just nearly
floored the champ!

1759
01:52:21,754 --> 01:52:24,741
A leaping hook caught the
exhausted champ off guard!

1760
01:52:24,841 --> 01:52:27,493
Creed doesn't know where
he is! It's blind instinct!

1761
01:52:27,593 --> 01:52:29,537
Balboa is staggering
from exhaustion.

1762
01:52:29,637 --> 01:52:33,166
Balboa throws a right to
the head of the champion.

1763
01:52:33,266 --> 01:52:36,127
Another right, and a left to the
head. He's got him into the corner.

1764
01:52:36,227 --> 01:52:37,929
Stay away from him!

1765
01:52:38,806 --> 01:52:43,260
He's got this thing won if he stays
away, but now it is Creed coming back.

1766
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:44,678
Creed with a left hand.

1767
01:52:44,778 --> 01:52:46,104
Go for it!

1768
01:52:47,190 --> 01:52:50,851
What's keeping these two guys
up? A tremendous boxing moment.

1769
01:52:50,951 --> 01:52:52,027
Now!

1770
01:52:54,489 --> 01:52:57,491
Here comes Balboa, but the
champion's back with another left.

1771
01:53:01,496 --> 01:53:02,954
Get away from him!

1772
01:53:04,582 --> 01:53:09,127
A right hand! A right hand! It's
Creed! Now it's Balboa! Now it's Creed!

1773
01:53:09,379 --> 01:53:11,205
Now a tremendous left by...

1774
01:53:11,305 --> 01:53:13,677
They're standing dead in the
center of the ring, toe to toe.

1775
01:53:13,777 --> 01:53:17,344
I don't know why the champion
is fighting Balboa's fight.

1776
01:53:21,974 --> 01:53:23,850
Go, Rocky! Go for it!

1777
01:53:25,812 --> 01:53:31,234
A tremendous left to
the head. A left. A left.

1778
01:53:45,374 --> 01:53:46,541
One!

1779
01:53:51,463 --> 01:53:52,547
Two!

1780
01:53:55,385 --> 01:53:57,461
Creed will retain
the title!

1781
01:53:57,561 --> 01:54:02,474
If neither gets up, it's a draw, and
Creed will win the title automatically!

1782
01:54:03,810 --> 01:54:04,781
Four!

1783
01:54:04,881 --> 01:54:05,978
Get up, man!

1784
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:08,105
Get on your feet!

1785
01:54:09,649 --> 01:54:10,732
Five!

1786
01:54:11,818 --> 01:54:13,310
Balboa reaches
for another!

1787
01:54:13,410 --> 01:54:14,862
Get up, Rock! Get up!

1788
01:54:16,030 --> 01:54:17,106
Six!

1789
01:54:17,206 --> 01:54:19,358
He's trying and
trying to beat the count!

1790
01:54:19,458 --> 01:54:20,860
Now the champ is
trying to get up!

1791
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,111
Seven!

1792
01:54:22,211 --> 01:54:25,081
Get up, Rocky!

1793
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:29,043
Eight!

1794
01:54:32,089 --> 01:54:33,214
Get up!

1795
01:54:33,632 --> 01:54:34,716
Nine!

1796
01:54:34,884 --> 01:54:37,760
The champ is trying... And he's down!

1797
01:54:38,512 --> 01:54:39,554
Ten!

1798
01:54:39,889 --> 01:54:40,889
Out!

1799
01:54:45,978 --> 01:54:49,097
He made it! Rocky Balboa
has shocked the world!

1800
01:54:49,197 --> 01:54:52,484
He is the new heavyweight
champion of the world!

1801
01:54:53,402 --> 01:54:55,729
Ladies and gentlemen,

1802
01:54:55,829 --> 01:55:01,276
in a stunning upset,
scoring a win by knockout,

1803
01:55:01,376 --> 01:55:05,413
the new heavyweight
champion of the world...

1804
01:55:06,415 --> 01:55:07,699
Yo, Creed.

1805
01:55:07,799 --> 01:55:09,000
Rocky Balboa!

1806
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:12,879
Good luck.

1807
01:55:14,298 --> 01:55:16,341
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1808
01:55:17,301 --> 01:55:20,888
I can't believe this
has happened. I can't...

1809
01:55:22,474 --> 01:55:26,560
And I just want to say thanks to
Apollo, for fighting me, Apollo.

1810
01:55:27,812 --> 01:55:30,731
I want to thank
Mickey for training me.

1811
01:55:32,317 --> 01:55:33,935
We love you, Rock!

1812
01:55:34,035 --> 01:55:35,903
Yeah, and I love youse, too.

1813
01:55:38,406 --> 01:55:40,783
Most of all I want
to thank God.

1814
01:55:43,078 --> 01:55:45,829
Except for my kid
being born,

1815
01:55:47,123 --> 01:55:50,709
this is the greatest night
in the history of my life.

1816
01:55:52,087 --> 01:55:56,966
I just want to say one thing
to my wife who's home.

1817
01:55:58,927 --> 01:56:01,879
Yo, Adrian! I did it!

1818
01:56:01,979 --> 01:56:05,099
I love you. I love you.

1819
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:15,388
Rocky! Rocky!
