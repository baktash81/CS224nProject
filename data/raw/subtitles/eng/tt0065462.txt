1
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:22,988
"Beware the beast man,
for he is the devil's pawn."

2
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:29,495
"Alone among God's primates,
he kills for sport or lust or greed."

3
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:35,376
"Yea, he will murder his brother
to possess his brother's land."

4
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,753
"Let him not breed in great numbers,

5
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:42,216
"for he will make a desert
of his home, and yours."

6
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,261
"Shun him...
for he is the harbinger of death."

7
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:57,231
Nova.

8
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,783
- Where will you go?
- Follow the shoreline.

9
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,793
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.

10
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,837
Of that I'm sure.

11
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:24,133
All my life I've awaited your coming
and dreaded it.

12
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,760
You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?

13
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:30,097
The forbidden zone was once a paradise.

14
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:34,518
Your breed made a desert of it ages ago.

15
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:36,603
It still doesn't give me the why.

16
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:39,314
A planet where apes evolved from men.

17
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,110
There's gotta be an answer.

18
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:48,282
Don't look for it, Taylor.
You may not like what you find.

19
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,791
Zira. Cornelius. Untie me.

20
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:24,234
- What will he find out there, Doctor?
- His destiny.

21
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,307
Damn you all to hell!

22
00:05:58,366 --> 00:06:02,077
- Food...
- No. No, no, skipper. It's me again.

23
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,370
Just me.

24
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,422
- Brent...
- Sir?

25
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:18,510
- Did you contact Earth?
- I tried to, sir. Not a crackle.

26
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:25,392
Skipper, I took an Earth time reading
just before reentry.

27
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,561
What'd you get?

28
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,981
3-9-5-5.

29
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:35,402
Three thousand, nine hundred
and fifty-five.

30
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,656
- AD.
- Almighty God.

31
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,869
Well, we were following
Taylor's trajectory.

32
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:47,998
Whatever happened to us
must have happened to him.

33
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:52,002
What about us? Where are we?

34
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,673
Well, in my opinion, skipper,

35
00:06:56,758 --> 00:07:01,887
we've passed through
a Hasslein Curve, a bend in time.

36
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:06,850
I don't know what planet we're on,
but the fact is, we're both of us here,

37
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:11,897
we're breathing, we're conscious,
we got plenty of oxygen, water...

38
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:14,066
Here.

39
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,822
No, we're gonna be all right, skipper.
We're gonna be all right.

40
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,743
As soon as you feel better,
we'll run a navigational estimate.

41
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,294
God, if I could only see the sun.

42
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,965
It's up there all right.

43
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,385
You can feel it.

44
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:44,805
Yes. But which sun?

45
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:48,266
I don't know. I don't know.

46
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:51,144
Our computer's shot.
We're lucky to be alive.

47
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,939
Lucky? No.

48
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,818
If it's 3955 AD, I...

49
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:02,406
Oh, my God. My wife.

50
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:07,661
My two daughters.

51
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:11,248
Dead.

52
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:18,338
Everyone I ever knew.

53
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,008
Everyone.

54
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,361
Who are you? I... Don't be afraid. I just...

55
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:49,406
Just tell me where I am.

56
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,158
Can you understand me?

57
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,705
My name's Brent.

58
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,543
Brent.

59
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,796
No. No, no, I don't wanna hurt you. I...

60
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,508
I just wanna know where I am.

61
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,141
Where are you from? I mean, your people.
Where are they?

62
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:19,477
How do I... How do I get to them?
Which way?

63
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:26,359
Can you... Can you talk?

64
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,741
Right, right. So you can't talk.

65
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,125
What's that?

66
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,047
Taylor!

67
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,592
Where is he?

68
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:55,722
Taylor. Taylor.

69
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,475
Nova.

70
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:06,066
Nova. Nova. Come on.

71
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,074
That's the idea. Taylor. Nova. Here.

72
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:22,457
Taylor. Taylor.

73
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:28,088
Here. There's a prize.
You go to the head of the class.

74
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:32,217
Why don't we just settle down
and found a colony?

75
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:34,803
All the kids'll learn to talk.

76
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:37,722
Sure they will.

77
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,018
Now, where in hell do we go from here?

78
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,772
We might make it yet.

79
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:07,961
Taylor. Taylor.
Just tell me what happened to him.

80
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:13,466
Is he hurt? Is he alive? Where is he?

81
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,161
That wasn't here.

82
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,956
A minute ago, that wasn't here.

83
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,919
I'm not the only one. She sees it too.

84
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:44,349
Listen. Listen, now. If you lose me...

85
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:47,435
If you lose me,

86
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:55,527
try to find Zira. Remember?
Zira. Go find Zira.

87
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,030
Zira.

88
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:34,148
This tag. Did he give it to you?
Where did you get this?

89
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:46,452
Look, is there... is there someone...
some other... someone who can talk?

90
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:52,542
Look, you take me

91
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:56,087
to Taylor.

92
00:15:57,882 --> 00:15:59,090
Taylor.

93
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:05,722
Taylor. Now. Which way?

94
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:38,481
My God! It's...

95
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:41,567
It's a city of apes!

96
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:49,367
I'll tell you one thing
that every good soldier knows.

97
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:53,496
The only thing
that counts in the end is power!

98
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,623
Naked, merciless force!

99
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:10,680
Members of the Citizens' Council,
I am a simple soldier.

100
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:14,058
And as a soldier, I see things simply.

101
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,565
I don't say all humans are evil,
simply because their skin is white.

102
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:25,153
No! But our great Lawgiver tells us

103
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,658
that never, never will the human
have the ape's divine faculty

104
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:35,538
for being able to distinguish
between evil and good.

105
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:39,584
Because the only good human
is a dead human!

106
00:18:47,384 --> 00:18:48,968
It's a bloody nightmare.

107
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,314
But those fortunate enough
to remain alive

108
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:07,278
will have the privilege of being used
by our revered minister of science,

109
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:09,030
the good Dr Zaius.

110
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,548
- Zira, stop. You're in danger.
- So is the future of science,

111
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,969
with that rabble-rouser fomenting
a senseless military adventure.

112
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,433
The forbidden zone has been closed
for centuries, and rightly so.

113
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:44,190
However, we now have evidence
that that vast barren area is inhabited.

114
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,402
By what or by whom, we don't know.

115
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,741
But if they live, and live they do,
then they must eat.

116
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:59,956
Now we must replenish the lands
that were ravaged by the humans

117
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,042
with new, improved feeding grounds.

118
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:07,296
And these grounds we can obtain
in the once forbidden zone.

119
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:12,468
It is therefore our holy duty
to put our feet upon it,

120
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:17,723
to enter it, to put the marks of our guns
and our wheels and our flags upon it!

121
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:29,068
To expand the boundaries
of our ineluctable power!

122
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:36,159
And to invade! Invade!

123
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,704
Invade! Invade!

124
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:01,893
- Zira, as your husband, I beg you to stand.
- Only for my principles.

125
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,439
All right. For your principles and mine.
Only please stand.

126
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:19,327
I gotta get out.
Yeah, I gotta get back up there.

127
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,164
I don't know how, or what with,
but I'm not staying here.

128
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:58,634
Well, General,
I only pray you know what you're doing.

129
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:01,304
How can you have any doubt, Dr Zaius?

130
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:03,889
You're aware of the reports we've received

131
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:08,644
of strange manifestations
in the forbidden zone.

132
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:12,231
Manifestations which you, if I might add,

133
00:23:12,316 --> 00:23:15,735
as minister of science
have been unable to fathom.

134
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:18,571
Twelve.

135
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:23,534
Twelve of my finest scouts
just disappeared. Vanished into thin air.

136
00:23:23,618 --> 00:23:24,869
Eleven.

137
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:31,167
Very well, eleven. Eleven.

138
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:37,673
And the twelfth returned with
incredible stories of huge walls of fire,

139
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:39,925
strange, violent earthquakes,

140
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:45,681
his mind gone, shattered no doubt
by some un-simian torture.

141
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:49,685
Well, General,
I still think you're being hasty.

142
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,940
No, Doctor. Decisive.
So we invade, or we stop.

143
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:58,527
- It's as simple as that.
- And as dangerous.

144
00:23:58,612 --> 00:24:01,947
What is more dangerous
than famine, Doctor?

145
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,909
The unknown.

146
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:32,603
If I had any proper sense
of scientific purpose, Cornelius,

147
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:35,815
I shouldn't cut up
the healthy heads of humans.

148
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:39,860
I should dissect the diseased brains
of gorillas to find out what went wrong.

149
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,154
And how would you put it right?

150
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:46,325
I'd wet-nurse their babies
on the milk of chimpanzees.

151
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,452
The milk of kindness.

152
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:52,498
At least our child when it's born
won't be breast-fed on bile.

153
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:57,420
You know, my dear,
the trouble with us intellectuals

154
00:24:57,504 --> 00:25:01,424
is that we have
responsibilities and no power.

155
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:05,469
I think I'll make a chocolate icing.
Do you like chocolate?

156
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:08,347
- What, dear?
- No, no, no. Of course you don't.

157
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:12,351
- But I do.
- lf we had that power here in our hands,

158
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:14,228
we'd be worse than them.

159
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:18,941
I don't agree.
Gorillas are cruel because they're stupid.

160
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:21,861
- All bone and no brain.
- Zira, my dear,

161
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:26,365
I wish you would not talk like that.
Somebody is liable to hear you.

162
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:33,706
- Nova!
- What are you doing here?

163
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:38,752
Taylor?

164
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:42,756
No, not Taylor. My name's Brent.

165
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:47,344
- You talked.
- That's impossible.

166
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:52,975
In a whole lifetime devoted
to the scientific study of humans,

167
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:55,394
I've only found one other who could talk.

168
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:59,523
- Yes. Taylor.
- Taylor. Is he alive? Have you seen him?

169
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:03,360
- Where? Where? Tell us.
- Where? Where? I don't know where.

170
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:05,279
I'm trying to find him.

171
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,324
The longer I stay around here,
the less I'm beginning to care.

172
00:26:08,408 --> 00:26:12,703
We loved Taylor.
He was a fine, a unique, specimen.

173
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:16,165
Why, if it had not been for Zira here,
he would still be here,

174
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:21,045
a stuffed specimen in the great hall
of the Zaius Museum with his two friends.

175
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:25,758
With his two friends?

176
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:32,640
I don't plan to stay here quite that long.
Can you get me some food, some water?

177
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:35,768
A map, so at least
I'll have some idea where I'm heading?

178
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:39,271
- You want that taken care of, too.
- I'll get the map.

179
00:26:47,864 --> 00:26:50,324
Now, if you will look up here...

180
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,409
Yes, towards the north.

181
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:56,247
This was the last place that
we saw Taylor and Nova.

182
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:59,458
- What is that damn stuff?
- You wouldn't know if I told you.

183
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:03,546
Just relax.
Among other things, I'm a trained vet.

184
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,549
- Great. Go on.
- Taylor was riding with Nova here,

185
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:09,426
between the lake and the sea.

186
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,762
They were heading
into the territory we call...

187
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:14,765
Yes, I know, the forbidden zone.

188
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:19,228
- Who told you that?
- Your glorious leader back there.

189
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:24,858
- Zira!
- Quick. Quick.

190
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:36,287
- Cornelius, open the door.
- Put the things away.

191
00:27:36,371 --> 00:27:38,455
Open it!

192
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:47,256
Dr Zaius. How nice.

193
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,300
We were just about to
have something to eat.

194
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:53,262
Not until I've talked some sense
to that headstrong wife of yours.

195
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:55,889
- Where is she?
- Good day, Dr Zaius.

196
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:58,183
Good heavens.
Has there been an accident?

197
00:27:58,268 --> 00:28:00,436
Cornelius hit me.

198
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,063
For my bad behavior at the meeting.

199
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,608
- I don't blame him.
- I don't resent it.

200
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:08,485
But his nails need clipping.

201
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,032
Enough of this nonsense.
Are you so blind, you two psychologists,

202
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:16,535
that you're unaware that
we're on the verge of a grave crisis?

203
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,788
- You heard the Ursus' speech.
- Militaristic tripe!

204
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:21,457
- Zira!
- Perhaps.

205
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:26,253
But now he has the incident he requires
to go on a rampage of conquest.

206
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:30,716
- But that is appalling!
- To remain silent while this bully Ursus

207
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:34,803
is permitted to destroy everything
in his path is no longer possible.

208
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:36,388
As minister of science,

209
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:40,476
it is my duty to find out whether
some other form of life exists.

210
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,022
- Where are you going?
- Into the forbidden zone, with Ursus.

211
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:47,066
Another manhunt, Doctor?

212
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:51,362
Someone, or something, has outwitted
the intelligence of the gorillas.

213
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:53,864
- That shouldn't be difficult.
- Zira.

214
00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:56,659
We apes have learned to live in innocence.

215
00:28:56,743 --> 00:29:00,412
Let no one, be it man
or some other creature,

216
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:03,040
dare to contaminate that innocence.

217
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,669
Why, is innocence so evil?

218
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:10,798
- Ignorance is.
- There is a time for truth.

219
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,092
And the time is always now.

220
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:18,013
Are you asking me
to surrender my principles?

221
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:20,349
I am asking you to be the guardians

222
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:23,560
of the principles of science
during my absence.

223
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:28,774
I am asking for a truce with your personal
convictions in an hour of public danger.

224
00:29:28,858 --> 00:29:33,112
And you shall have it, Dr Zaius,
or I shall hit her again.

225
00:29:33,196 --> 00:29:36,115
Let us have no violence, Cornelius.

226
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:41,078
- Now, I'm relying on you both.
- And we are counting on you too, Doctor.

227
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:45,416
If I should fail to return from the unknown,

228
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:51,296
the whole future of our civilization
may be yours to preserve or destroy.

229
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,967
So think well before you act.

230
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,888
Well, goodbye, Dr Zaius, and good luck.

231
00:30:11,818 --> 00:30:14,236
Now we can finish this up
and get you out of here!

232
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,864
Yeah, get me outta here, please!

233
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:20,826
I've seen the humane way they treat
humans here. I don't much care for it.

234
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,412
- Have you a horse?
- Yeah, out in the scrub.

235
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:29,126
I'd better get you another set of clothes.
The kind fit for humans like yourself.

236
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,837
You'll pass. Get rid of this.

237
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:36,341
And this too.

238
00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:42,931
If you are caught by the gorillas,
you must remember one thing.

239
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:45,225
- What's that?
- Never to speak.

240
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,646
What the hell would
I have to say to a gorilla?

241
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:55,277
But you don't understand.
Only apes can speak. Not her, and not you.

242
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,905
If they catch you speaking,
they will dissect you,

243
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,073
and they will kill you, in that order.

244
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,786
Cornelius is right. Be very careful.

245
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,040
And get out of those things
that you're wearing as soon as you can.

246
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:11,585
Thanks.

247
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:16,215
- Thank us by finding Taylor.
- Yeah, if he's still alive.

248
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:18,665
Four.

249
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,501
Seven inches.

250
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,962
Sergeant, wait!

251
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,719
This is a type E cranium. Very unusual.

252
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:35,474
Weak occipital development,
and substandard lobe...

253
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:41,313
Female. It's been a long time since
we've been able to study specimens

254
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:44,858
of such extraordinary clinical interest.

255
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,818
- Bring them inside.
- No!

256
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:53,158
No, you can't have them.
They are marked for target practice.

257
00:35:55,078 --> 00:35:56,620
Take them away.

258
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,062
- I'll take the key.
- To the target range!

259
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:28,193
Wait! Wait!
I'd better double-lock the door.

260
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:39,246
Good luck. All right!

261
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:20,104
God Almighty!

262
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,485
This used to be my home.

263
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,949
I lived here, worked here.

264
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,289
What happened?
What could have happened?

265
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:47,757
My God, did we finally do it?

266
00:43:51,053 --> 00:43:54,472
Did we finally really do it?

267
00:43:56,976 --> 00:44:00,895
O God, bless, we pray You,

268
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,066
our great army and
its supreme commander

269
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:10,572
on the eve of a holy war,
undertaken for Your sake.

270
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:16,244
And grant, in the name of Your prophet,
our great Lawgiver,

271
00:44:16,328 --> 00:44:23,084
that we, Your chosen servants,
created and born in Your divine image,

272
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:25,920
may aspire the more perfectly

273
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:30,592
to that spiritual godliness
and bodily beauty

274
00:44:30,676 --> 00:44:34,429
which You in Your infinite mercy

275
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:39,183
have thought fit to deny
to our brutish enemies!

276
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:41,519
So be it.

277
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:54,782
There they go,
Dr Zaius trotting along beside them.

278
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:59,162
Don't be too hard on the old boy, Zira.
His motives are honest.

279
00:44:59,246 --> 00:45:03,875
He has only one motive, to keep things
exactly as they have always been.

280
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:06,461
I say that it's time for a change.

281
00:45:07,212 --> 00:45:10,381
But Zira, we chimpanzees are too few.

282
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:13,885
How can we take initiative
when they are in control?

283
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:19,474
Love yes, war no!

284
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:25,188
- No more lies, no more crud!
- No more guns, no more blood!

285
00:45:25,272 --> 00:45:28,483
Stop! Stop! Stop the war!

286
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:31,110
- Freedom! Freedom!
- Whoa!

287
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,279
- Freedom!
- Peace!

288
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:35,490
Peace and freedom!

289
00:45:35,574 --> 00:45:38,993
- Get off the road, young people.
- Freedom!

290
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:41,496
- We want freedom!
- Get 'em out of the way.

291
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,499
- Wait.
- We want freedom! We want peace!

292
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,502
We don't want martyrs, do we?

293
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:50,713
We want peace! We want freedom!

294
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:54,592
- Sergeant? Do it quietly.
- No clubs, no clubs.

295
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:57,512
We want peace! We want freedom!

296
00:45:59,515 --> 00:46:01,224
Gorilla brutality!

297
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:22,161
Sergeant!

298
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:21,239
Are you what we were,

299
00:48:21,323 --> 00:48:24,867
before we learned to talk
and made a mess of everything?

300
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:32,917
Did any good ever come from
all that talk around all those tables?

301
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:04,991
- I don't know where they are.
- I wonder where the hell we are.

302
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:10,705
- We're near the forbidden zone.
- Hell, that's where the army is headed.

303
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:14,584
- They'll roll over us, blow us to bits.
- Why can't we go back to our outfits?

304
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:18,337
Because the sarge says
to keep lookin' until we find them.

305
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,141
Nova! Nova, Nova, wake up.
We gotta get goin'. Come on.

306
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:45,990
That hum.

307
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,536
You hear it too?

308
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:55,458
All right, come on. We're gonna follow it.

309
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:04,151
Well, whoever, or whatever,
something's guiding us.

310
00:51:04,236 --> 00:51:06,779
Whatever they are, they breathe air.

311
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:37,184
There's an intelligence working here.

312
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:42,648
That sound is either a warning or
a directional device, I don't know which.

313
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,651
It doesn't much matter.
They know we're here.

314
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:06,287
Put my hands

315
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,666
round her throat!

316
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:13,919
Off!

317
00:56:15,422 --> 00:56:18,299
Hold her throat down

318
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,763
until she dies!

319
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:27,933
No!

320
00:56:37,736 --> 00:56:39,194
Get out!

321
00:56:40,572 --> 00:56:42,364
Get out of my head!

322
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:52,476
I reveal my inmost self unto my God.

323
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:10,244
What did you say?

324
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,207
What do you mean, "there's no point"?

325
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:18,752
Will they hurt her?

326
00:58:20,505 --> 00:58:24,716
No, maybe not physically, but here.
Here. You can hurt here, I know.

327
00:58:28,847 --> 00:58:31,265
Your lips don't move.

328
00:58:32,392 --> 00:58:34,435
But I can hear.

329
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:36,979
I know. I mean...

330
00:58:37,063 --> 00:58:39,189
I know what you're thinking.

331
00:58:42,777 --> 00:58:45,362
Nothing. I saw nothing.

332
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,739
Who are you?

333
01:00:23,336 --> 01:00:26,129
Brent. Who are you?

334
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:34,221
I see. "The only reality in the universe."
Well, that's nice to know.

335
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:40,310
I got here by accident.
How did you get here?

336
01:00:41,646 --> 01:00:44,064
You're wrong.
Why would I want to spy on you?

337
01:00:44,148 --> 01:00:46,483
I'm not even sure you exist.

338
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:52,072
Of course I know who I am.
I'm an astronaut.

339
01:00:52,156 --> 01:00:55,075
I was sent here on a rescue mission.

340
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:57,661
To find a fellow astronaut. Taylor.

341
01:00:59,831 --> 01:01:03,000
Well, from this planet, but

342
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:07,337
from another time, 2,000 years ago.

343
01:01:07,422 --> 01:01:10,674
I know. I know it sounds insane.

344
01:01:13,845 --> 01:01:16,847
And it's my insanity.

345
01:01:16,931 --> 01:01:19,224
No. No, I don't know how to get back.

346
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:22,894
We came through a defect.

347
01:01:24,188 --> 01:01:25,939
A slippage in time.

348
01:01:26,899 --> 01:01:29,359
That's what must have
happened to Taylor.

349
01:01:29,444 --> 01:01:31,695
I'm sure he tried to get back.

350
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,201
Yes, my skipper's dead. I'm alone.

351
01:01:41,748 --> 01:01:42,831
Who?

352
01:01:45,376 --> 01:01:48,920
"Nova"? What's that?
Some star or galaxy? What's "Nova"?

353
01:02:11,152 --> 01:02:14,404
All right, all right! Yes, I know her.
I know her!

354
01:02:17,075 --> 01:02:19,743
No, no. She's harmless. Let her alone.

355
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,875
All right.
Just tell me what you want to know.

356
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:32,547
She helped me. To break out ofApe City.

357
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:39,012
No, wait. Wait a minute!

358
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,474
Stop it!

359
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:47,354
I can't understand you if you're
all screaming at me at the same time.

360
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:49,523
I can't separate it!

361
01:02:49,607 --> 01:02:52,150
He's right. He has only limited intelligence.

362
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:55,028
We should speak aloud, and one at a time.

363
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:59,157
Are we to understand that
you were in the city of the apes?

364
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:02,452
- Yes. Yes, two days ago.
- What sights did you see?

365
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:07,874
- You're talking.
- Certainly we can talk.

366
01:03:07,959 --> 01:03:11,378
It's a primitive accomplishment.
We use it when we must.

367
01:03:11,462 --> 01:03:14,214
- When we pray.
- When we sing to our God.

368
01:03:23,224 --> 01:03:28,145
You mean that thing out there?
An atomic bomb?

369
01:03:28,229 --> 01:03:31,857
- Your God?
- You don't understand, Mr Brent.

370
01:03:31,983 --> 01:03:35,068
The Bomb is a holy weapon of peace.

371
01:03:35,153 --> 01:03:42,868
Holy weapon of peace!

372
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:02,345
Mr Brent, we are a patient people.

373
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:07,225
But we are determined to know
what the apes want. War or peace?

374
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,144
Try to understand.

375
01:04:09,228 --> 01:04:14,107
The only weapons
we have are purely illusion.

376
01:04:14,192 --> 01:04:19,905
You just imagine that he hurt you.
Traumatic hypnosis is a weapon of peace.

377
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,032
Like the visual deterrent.

378
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,246
Or the sonic deterrent.

379
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:44,679
Let me make a last appeal to your reason,
before we inflict more of this on you.

380
01:04:44,764 --> 01:04:47,641
These are weapons of peace, Mr Brent.

381
01:04:47,725 --> 01:04:51,144
- Like all our weapons.
- Mere illusions.

382
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:55,148
Illusions. Damn your hypocrisy!

383
01:04:55,233 --> 01:04:58,276
Is that bomb out there...
is that an illusion?

384
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:05,742
It's operational, isn't it?

385
01:05:05,827 --> 01:05:09,496
The firing mechanism. It's intact, isn't it?

386
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:13,834
We very much need your help, Mr Brent.

387
01:05:13,918 --> 01:05:17,462
- Why?
- We are the Keepers of the Divine Bomb.

388
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:22,467
- It is our only reason for survival.
- And yet as you see we are defenseless.

389
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:27,055
Defenseless against the slobbering,
monstrous, materialistic apes.

390
01:05:29,475 --> 01:05:32,102
I'll help nobody.

391
01:05:32,186 --> 01:05:36,439
- Go ahead, annihilate each other.
- I forgive you your language.

392
01:05:36,524 --> 01:05:40,443
There are times, I know,
when your sanity is about to give way.

393
01:05:40,528 --> 01:05:42,779
I hope that does not happen.

394
01:05:42,864 --> 01:05:47,033
- I hope you can tell us...
- Exactly what the apes are planning.

395
01:05:47,118 --> 01:05:51,204
We've caught some of their scouts.
They're hideous creatures.

396
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:55,333
And we've had them here,
standing precisely where you are now.

397
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:59,421
Either their skulls were too thick,
or they really knew nothing at all.

398
01:05:59,505 --> 01:06:04,759
Neither do I. Can't you understand that?
I don't know anything.

399
01:06:04,844 --> 01:06:07,470
You make us very sad, Mr Brent.

400
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:29,910
She can't help you. She can't even talk.

401
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:35,415
- Don't harm her.
- We never harm anyone, Mr Brent.

402
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:38,668
You're going to harm her.

403
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:12,869
- The apes are semiarticulate...
- You're lying.

404
01:07:15,706 --> 01:07:17,290
How do you know?

405
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:22,253
How do you always know?

406
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:28,385
Nova.

407
01:07:34,392 --> 01:07:37,769
- Now...
- Tell us of the apes.

408
01:07:41,148 --> 01:07:42,565
The apes

409
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,903
are marching on your city.

410
01:08:45,629 --> 01:08:48,757
Bugler, sound the advance.

411
01:09:35,179 --> 01:09:36,346
Ursus!

412
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:04,374
Ursus, I warned you.
Look what we are faced with!

413
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,460
- I told you you should wait.
- Brutal butchery!

414
01:10:08,379 --> 01:10:13,341
I swear those responsible shall pay
with torture and with death!

415
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:17,929
If you have any pity,
get your soldiers to shoot our poor people.

416
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:22,183
I can't order them to do
what the Lawgiver has forbidden.

417
01:10:22,268 --> 01:10:24,269
"Ape shall not kill ape."

418
01:10:38,909 --> 01:10:40,910
Hold your positions!

419
01:10:49,628 --> 01:10:50,962
He bleeds!

420
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:55,925
The Lawgiver bleeds!

421
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:13,776
The spirit of the Lawgiver lives.
We are still God's chosen ones.

422
01:11:13,861 --> 01:11:16,905
This is a vision, and it is a lie!

423
01:12:13,504 --> 01:12:15,338
The vision was false!

424
01:12:18,676 --> 01:12:22,136
Bugler, sound the advance.

425
01:12:23,847 --> 01:12:25,515
Advance!

426
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:32,230
Stupid animals! They don't have
the brain to hold our illusions.

427
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:36,943
- We have no defense.
- Except our Bomb.

428
01:12:37,027 --> 01:12:40,613
- Call our people to High Sanctuary.
- Do you know the range of their city?

429
01:12:40,698 --> 01:12:44,117
- Yes.
- Set in the mechanism and wait for me.

430
01:12:44,201 --> 01:12:47,829
I want a public thought projection,
at adult and infant level.

431
01:12:47,913 --> 01:12:50,707
Adults to the cathedral, infants indoors.

432
01:13:31,665 --> 01:13:35,168
Is now and ever shall be

433
01:13:35,252 --> 01:13:41,382
World without end, Amen

434
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:56,731
The heavens declare the glory of the Bomb

435
01:13:56,815 --> 01:13:59,275
and the firmament
showeth His handiwork.

436
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,738
His sound has gone out unto all the lands

437
01:14:03,822 --> 01:14:07,617
and His light unto the end of the world.

438
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:11,204
He descendeth from
the outermost part of heaven.

439
01:14:11,288 --> 01:14:14,123
Nothing is hid from the heat thereof.

440
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:18,419
There is neither speech nor language,
yet His voice is heard among them.

441
01:14:18,504 --> 01:14:23,466
Praise Him! Praise Him!
My strength, and my redeemer.

442
01:14:44,154 --> 01:14:46,572
Glory be to the Bomb
and to the Holy Fallout,

443
01:14:46,657 --> 01:14:48,241
as it was in the beginning,

444
01:14:48,325 --> 01:14:52,412
is now, and ever shall be,
world without end, amen.

445
01:15:07,928 --> 01:15:11,055
O mighty and everlasting Bomb,
who came down among us

446
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:15,184
to make heaven under earth,
lighten our darkness.

447
01:15:15,269 --> 01:15:19,063
O instrument of God, grant us thy peace.

448
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:21,774
Almighty Bomb

449
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:24,485
Who destroyed all devils

450
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:28,448
And created angels

451
01:15:28,532 --> 01:15:32,827
Behold this moment

452
01:15:32,911 --> 01:15:38,207
Behold the truth that abides in us.
Reveal that truth unto that Maker.

453
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:49,552
- I reveal my inmost self unto my God.
- Unto my God.

454
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,672
All things bright and beautiful

455
01:16:26,757 --> 01:16:32,845
All creatures great and small

456
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:38,184
All things wise and wonderful

457
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:44,065
The good Bomb made us all

458
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:49,529
He gave us eyes to see with

459
01:16:49,613 --> 01:16:55,576
And lips that we might tell

460
01:16:55,661 --> 01:17:01,624
How great the Bomb Almighty

461
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:08,631
Who made all things well

462
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:13,177
Let everyone go to his private shelter.

463
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:17,139
Empty the streets.
They are to find the City of the Dead.

464
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:24,063
May the blessing of the Bomb Almighty
and the fellowship of the Holy Fallout

465
01:17:24,147 --> 01:17:27,817
descend on us all this day,
and forevermore.

466
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:50,756
I trust this simple ceremony
convinced you of our peaceable intentions.

467
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:55,261
- I'd like to thank you for your cooperation.
- When may we hope to be set free?

468
01:17:55,345 --> 01:17:58,180
You may hope
whenever you please, Mr Brent.

469
01:18:12,112 --> 01:18:15,865
How could we hope to let you go
on the eve of war, Mr Brent?

470
01:18:21,455 --> 01:18:25,541
You know too many of our secrets.
Like your friend.

471
01:18:41,433 --> 01:18:44,435
- Taylor!
- You're... Brent!

472
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:48,648
- My God! Taylor!
- Brent, how in the hell did you get here?

473
01:18:48,732 --> 01:18:51,484
The same way you did.
Spaceship, Ape City, subway...

474
01:18:51,568 --> 01:18:54,487
- By yourself?
- No. No, Nova found me.

475
01:18:54,571 --> 01:18:56,989
- Is she with you? Where?
- I don't know.

476
01:18:57,074 --> 01:19:00,576
They separated us.
They were trying to make me kill her.

477
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:08,000
Mr Taylor, Mr Brent.
We are a peaceful people.

478
01:19:08,085 --> 01:19:12,296
We don't kill our enemies,
we get our enemies to kill each other.

479
01:19:28,772 --> 01:19:30,690
I'm fighting.

480
01:19:32,025 --> 01:19:34,276
I'm fighting. I don't wanna...

481
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:36,190
Taylor. Taylor!

482
01:22:02,968 --> 01:22:04,927
Taylor!

483
01:22:36,668 --> 01:22:38,752
Unto God

484
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:45,134
I reveal my inmost self.

485
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:08,741
He's hurt bad.

486
01:23:14,748 --> 01:23:16,957
This isn't exactly sterile.

487
01:23:18,168 --> 01:23:20,210
We'll do the best we can.

488
01:23:20,712 --> 01:23:24,131
Taylor. Taylor, they got a bomb.

489
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:27,509
Atomic bomb.

490
01:23:29,179 --> 01:23:31,889
It's operational. They intend to use it.

491
01:23:33,016 --> 01:23:35,267
- What type is it?
- I don't know.

492
01:23:35,352 --> 01:23:38,062
I don't know what type.
I've never seen it before.

493
01:23:38,188 --> 01:23:41,065
- Well, didn't you see a series number?
- No numbers.

494
01:23:41,191 --> 01:23:46,236
Just some letters on one of the fins.

495
01:23:46,363 --> 01:23:48,864
Greek letters.

496
01:23:48,949 --> 01:23:51,784
Alpha and...

497
01:23:51,868 --> 01:23:54,912
- And omega.
- What?

498
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:05,798
The Doomsday Bomb.

499
01:24:06,299 --> 01:24:08,634
My God!

500
01:24:08,718 --> 01:24:11,720
What a lovely souvenir
from the 20th century.

501
01:24:13,098 --> 01:24:16,767
They weren't satisfied with a bomb
that could knock out a city.

502
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:21,605
They finally built one with a cobalt casing.

503
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:25,067
All in the sweet name of peace.

504
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:29,738
Those bloody fools.
They don't know what they've got.

505
01:24:29,823 --> 01:24:32,616
I mean, they pray to the damn thing.

506
01:24:34,077 --> 01:24:36,954
If they shoot it off at some of those apes,

507
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:41,625
it could set off a chain reaction
in the whole atmosphere.

508
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,754
Burn the planet to a cinder.
How's that for your ultimate weapon?

509
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:05,107
This must be what your scout reported.
A subterranean passage.

510
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:08,444
I think it's worth exploring.

511
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:27,004
What will you do, Holiness?

512
01:25:32,302 --> 01:25:34,136
Everything necessary.

513
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:07,104
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- I'm thinking just that.

514
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:39,094
Nova? Nova, you...

515
01:27:42,515 --> 01:27:44,057
Oh God!

516
01:27:47,604 --> 01:27:51,273
We should let 'em all die.
The gorillas, every damned...

517
01:27:53,818 --> 01:27:55,694
Look what it comes to.

518
01:28:01,492 --> 01:28:05,621
It's time it was finished. Finished.

519
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,791
Taylor.

520
01:28:09,876 --> 01:28:13,003
Come on, come on. The bomb.

521
01:28:14,505 --> 01:28:15,631
Yeah.

522
01:28:21,304 --> 01:28:22,554
Why not?

523
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:31,855
They're obscene!

524
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:15,190
Follow me!

525
01:29:20,196 --> 01:29:21,446
Sergeant!

526
01:30:02,655 --> 01:30:04,448
Arrest that creature!

527
01:30:06,242 --> 01:30:10,078
- This is the instrument of my God.
- He can speak!

528
01:30:28,931 --> 01:30:30,432
Your God, eh?

529
01:30:32,602 --> 01:30:33,894
Sergeant.

530
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:47,783
Your God didn't save you, did he?

531
01:30:49,994 --> 01:30:54,706
Ursus! Ursus, are you mad?
That weapon is built by man.

532
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:57,834
You can't shoot it down
with only a clip of bullets.

533
01:30:57,919 --> 01:31:02,214
If we can't shoot it down,
we'll pull it down. Rope!

534
01:31:02,298 --> 01:31:05,217
Block and tackle! Get on it!

535
01:31:05,301 --> 01:31:07,928
But you don't know what you're doing!

536
01:31:10,306 --> 01:31:11,973
It'll kill us all!

537
01:32:06,529 --> 01:32:08,655
I'll find a way to stop it.

538
01:32:16,581 --> 01:32:18,373
Get him! Over there!

539
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:24,296
Ursus! Someone at the pillar.

540
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:45,192
Zaius...

541
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:47,903
- Taylor!
- It's Doomsday.

542
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:53,074
The end of the world.

543
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:57,329
- Help me.
- You ask me to help you?

544
01:32:57,997 --> 01:33:01,625
Man is evil,
capable of nothing but destruction!

545
01:33:11,594 --> 01:33:16,097
You bloody bastard!

546
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:41,164
In one of the countless billions of galaxies
in the universe lies a medium-size star.
