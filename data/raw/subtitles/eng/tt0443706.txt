1
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,030
Where have you been?
I've been waiting since 7:00.

2
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,400
Get in. I had to find fireworks.

3
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,230
Let me drive.

4
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,540
Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

5
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,370
Are you coming or not?

6
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,860
It's too crowded.

7
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,860
I thought you were starving.

8
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,770
Let's go someplace quiet.

9
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,170
Okay.

10
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,920
What are we doing?

11
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,600
Sitting. Listening to music. Talking.

12
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,500
-You seem weird. Is everything okay?
-Yeah, everything's fine.

13
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,240
It's July.
How many shirts are you wearing?

14
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,280
-I'm cold.
-You're cold on the Fourth of July?

15
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,820
Fuck off and die!

16
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,260
-What?
-"Fuck off and die"?

17
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,760
Shut up.

18
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,630
Was that car at the drive-in?

19
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,300
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.

20
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,980
-Do you want me to tell him to leave?
-Stay in the car.

21
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,390
-Was that your husband?
-No.

22
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,530
Who was that, Darlene?

23
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,290
Don't worry about it.

24
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,070
-Don't tell me not to worry. Who was it?
-It's nothing.

25
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,620
Oh, shit.

26
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,490
Let's go.

27
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,300
Now, D.

28
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,810
Get your wallet.

29
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,990
Man, you really creeped us out.

30
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,450
-Vallejo Police Department.
-I want to report a double murder.

31
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,050
May I have your name
and where you are calling...

32
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,960
If you go one mile east
on Columbus Parkway,

33
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,800
a public park,
you'll find kids in a brown car.

34
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,540
They were shot with a 9mm Luger.

35
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,710
I also killed those kids last year.

36
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,910
Goodbye.

37
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,720
Spit.

38
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,590
Come on, buddy.

39
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,490
-I swallowed it.
-Why?

40
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,560
It was minty.

41
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,570
You can't do that. It's not good for you.

42
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,040
Lunch box.

43
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,020
-Why am I not going on the bus?
-Because we're late.

44
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,320
Okay, you're staying
with your mom and Aaron tonight.

45
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,810
So, you don't like
having a new little brother?

46
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,590
-No, not really.
-Oh, that's honest.

47
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,450
Learn a lot.

48
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,670
There will be a test tonight!

49
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,800
Morning.

50
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,860
-Hi.
-Good morning.

51
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,930
-Morning.
-Morning.

52
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,460
How's the coffee today, Shorty?

53
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,740
Editorial in two.

54
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,670
Good morning, gentlemen.

55
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

56
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,900
Well, Stanton, tell Mr. Howe

57
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,580
the draft board piece
was damn near perfect.

58
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,640
Mr. Graysmith.

59
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,420
Horrid.

60
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,320
Not so horrid.

61
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,620
Horrid.
I'm thinking we go with not so horrid.

62
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,120
Paul, what's on the crime beat?

63
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,860
Janice in Datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked.

64
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
That's a crime.

65
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,900
Have you seen her? Wouldn't kid you.

66
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,010
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.

67
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,400
You need to see this.

68
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,650
Go get the publisher.

69
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
"Dear Editor,

70
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,050
"This is the murderer

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,560

"The boy was on his back
with his feet to the car.

"The girl... "

79
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,710
Would you read that, please?

80
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,810
"The girl was on her right side,
feet to the west.

81
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,280

"The other two parts of this cipher

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,170
"If you do not print this cipher

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,770
F-R-Y, "First of Aug '69

"until I end up with
a dozen people over the weekend. "

95
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,260
It's unsigned except for a symbol.

96
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,630
Is it me,
or does that look like a gunsight?

97
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,060
Today's August first.

98
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,870
He wants his code
in the afternoon edition.

99
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,770
If the Examiner doesn't have
the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay.

100
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,600
Al, this man is talking about
shooting 12 people.

101
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,740
And not running this
might make him do that.

102
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,640
If we run it, we might be setting
a very dangerous precedent.

103
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,840
Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy.

104
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,750
Well, giving some sick bastard
a soapbox,

105
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,310
what does that say to people?

106
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,220
Back up. Is this Vallejo story true?
Do we know that?

107
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,620
-Paul?
-What? I cover crime in Vallejo?

108
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,690
Yeah, I cover crime in Vallejo.
Ten minutes.

109
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,730
Let's shoot the code and call SFPD.

110
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,070
If it turns out to be real,
at least we'll have the material.

111
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,400
All right.

112
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,530
Graysmith,
don't you have that cartoon to finish?

113
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,900
Oh, yeah.

114
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,680
Hi, this is Paul Avery
from the San Francisco Chronicle.

115
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,010
I'm looking for someone to
shed some light on a letter we received.

116
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,150
Thank you.

117
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,690
Sergeant Mulanax.

118
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,550
Sergeant, Paul Avery from
the San Francisco Chronicle.

119
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,690
I just wanted to check

120
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,590
if you had an unsolved
firearm-related homicide

121
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,490
on Christmas and
maybe one on July fourth.

122
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,290
Shit.

123
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,200
You guys got one, too?

124
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,630
Confirmed.
VPD, they confirmed the shootings.

125
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,170
Al's on the phone with the Examiner.

126
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,670
They got the same letter
with a different code.

127
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,840
So did Times-Herald.

128
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,740
Christmas, two teenagers
on lover's lane. Both DOA.

129
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,010
David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

130
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,910
July fourth,
Darlene Ferrin and Michael...

131
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,580
I think it's "Mayhew. "
Anyway, he lived, she didn't.

132
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,810
The murder weapons?

133
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,720
Ballistics, everything he said
in the letters matched.

134
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,720
I mean, I think the Times-Herald's
gonna go with it.

135
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,890
The Examiner's going,
but won't go front page.

136
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,200
I say let's go front page.
If he kills 12 people, it's not our fault.

137
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,330
Robert! We need the cartoon.

138
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,100
-You're not finished?
-No, I'm finished, Carol. I'm finished.

139
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,270
Thieriot's still here.

140
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,910
Really?

141
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,220
The first edition
is off the floor in 10, Charles.

142
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,550
Give us a sec.

143
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,950
Okay, re-plate.

144
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,590
We'll go on page... Page four.

145
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,320
What do you say, 20 bucks
whoever cracks the psycho's name?

146
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,570
He won't give his name.

147
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,630
Morti's? Anyone?

148
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,910
-That's where I'm heading.
-All right.

149
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,270
Put those on my desk. Turn on the light.

150
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,110
Grab your book.

151
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,820
Now go get your jammies on.

152
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,580
All right, people, listen up.

153
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,490
The cipher's broken into three sections,
each with eight lines and 17 symbols.

154
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,660
No breaks between the symbols
denoting different words.

155
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,290
No numbers or clues
to substitution keys.

156
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,970
And you got symbols
from at least seven different sources.

157
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,940
Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore,
weather symbols, astrological signs.

158
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,950
-Hey, take a gander at this code thing.
-Okay.

159
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,120
You wanna give it a go?

160
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,790
Guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.

161
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,300
Now he's doing public television.
For some reason.

162
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,730
Paul Avery.

163
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,670
Robert Graysmith.
I've been here nine months.

164
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,570
You were right, by the way.
He didn't give his name.

165
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,110
Who cracked it?

166
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,010
A history teacher
and his wife in Salinas.

167
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,350
"I like killing people
because it is so much fun.

168
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,550
"It is more fun
than killing wild game in the forest

169
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,690
"because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill.

170
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,320
"Something gives me
the most thrilling experience.

171
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,090
"It is even better
than getting your rocks off with a girl.

172
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,160
"The best part of it is that when I die,

173
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,900
"I will be reborn in paradise.

174
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,970
"And all that I have killed
will become my slaves.

175
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,440
"I will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down

176
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,310
"or stop my collecting of slaves
for my afterlife. "

177
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,620
Methinks our friend's
a tad bit fuckered in the head.

178
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,580
I heard he even sent Vallejo
a code key, just to help.

179
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,850
-What is that at the bottom?
-Leftovers.

180
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,320
Maybe an anagram.

181
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,990
How does one do that?

182
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,990
I like puzzles. I do them a lot.

183
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,390
How did you know
he wasn't gonna give his name?

184
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,820
Dangerous animal.

185
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,320
Dangerous animal.

186
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,870
What dangerous animal?
How do I know that?

187
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,900
-Paul.
-Yes, Templeton.

188
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,010
-Editorial, now.
-Very well.

189
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,810
Another letter.

190
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,150
More of the same.
Details about the murders.

191
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,150
He taped a flashlight to the gun.
That's how he hit them in the dark.

192
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,350
And he gave himself a name.

193
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,370
You know this used to be
the town of Montecello?

194
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,110
But at some point,

195
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,010
the county decided that the land
would work better as a lake.

196
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,280
So they flooded it.

197
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,450
-But there's an entire...
-Hidden city under the water.

198
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,320
We were here last spring, remember?

199
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,520
Oh, yeah.

200
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,070
Somebody else is here.

201
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,970
It is a public park.

202
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,370
I think he's watching us.

203
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,950
Well, we're very good-looking.

204
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,480
Where'd he go?

205
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,550
He went behind that tree.

206
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,970
All right. So he's taking a leak.

207
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,840
He's coming towards us.

208
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

209
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,240
Don't move.

210
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,150
-I want your money and your car keys.
-Okay.

211
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,510
We're not gonna do anything, okay?

212
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,250
We're gonna cooperate.
Just tell me what you want us to do.

213
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,780
Here.

214
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,860
You're welcome to everything I have.

215
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,290
If there's anything else
I could do for you...

216
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,270
Maybe I could write you a check?

217
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,440
Okay, I could give you
my phone number.

218
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,900
You know, I might be able to help you.

219
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,710
Even more than you might think.

220
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,110
He's a sociology major.

221
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,250
Pre-law, actually.

222
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,920
Oh, keys.

223
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,820
You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly
where I put my keys.

224
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,160
They might be on the blanket.
Is it okay if...

225
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,800
Here's the keys.

226
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,830
Don't get up.

227
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,900
I want her to tie you up.

228
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,940
Okay.

229
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,790
You know, if he comes any closer,
I might be able to get that gun.

230
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,930
-Don't get any ideas.
-I'm not.

231
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,230
I killed a guard
escaping from prison in Montana.

232
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,940
I'm not doing anything, okay?

233
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,310
I'm not afraid to kill again.

234
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,710
Look away.

235
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,800
What was the name of that prison?

236
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,160
Hey, you said it was in Montana, right?

237
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,030
I'm taking your car.

238
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,930
I'm going to Mexico.

239
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,930
We didn't complain
when you tied our hands.

240
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,100
Okay, you have everything that I have.

241
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,170
We have done everything
that you've asked.

242
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,640
It's okay. It's okay.

243
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,950
She tied you loose, didn't she?

244
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,010
Get on your stomach
so I can tie your feet.

245
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,150
Okay.
It gets really cold out here at night.

246
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,720
We could freeze.

247
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,690
Okay, you all done?

248
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,330
You know,
just because people are gonna ask,

249
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,440
was that thing even loaded?

250
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,280
It's okay.

251
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,480
This is all gonna be okay.

252
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,340
Dispatch, this is 43L2,
heading south on Knoxville Road.

253
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,920
I've got an abandoned white
VW Karmann-Ghia...

254
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,870
Napa Police Department.

255
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,150
I want to report a murder.
No, a double murder.

256
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,540
They are two miles north
of park headquarters.

257
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,650
They were in a white
Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia.

258
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,080
I'm the one that did it.

259
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,250
43L2 has a male victim with him.

260
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,160
Piner's ambulance
has been dispatched.

261
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,990
Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.

262
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,260
God, can you imagine
surviving something like that?

263
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,330
Writing the dates on the side of the car.

264
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,230
We got two Vallejo killings,
now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

265
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,430
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo?

266
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,430
Sweet mother of Christ,
what are you drawing?

267
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,710
Kid at the lake.

268
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,610
This is what he said
the Zodiac was wearing.

269
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,940
God, that's a hell of a get-up.

270
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,840
-Paul, what are you doing?
-Hyman, I wrote it. It's done.

271
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,810
Now I just got to type it up.

272
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,710
Type it up?
It's not finished until you type it up.

273
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,950
We've got to read it.

274
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,350
-What's that?
-That's the Zodiac at the lake.

275
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,890
What's the story with the kid?

276
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,790
He seems a little touched
or medicated or...

277
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,590
-Graysmith?
-Yeah, what is it?

278
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,200
He's a fucking boy scout.

279
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,100
He doesn't smoke,
he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.

280
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,030
-And he's back.
-I knew it.

281
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,470
"Man is the most
dangerous animal of all. "

282
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,670
I knew that
I heard that from somewhere.

283
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,570
The Most Dangerous Game.

284
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,970
It's a movie about a Count
who hunts people for sport.

285
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,280
People.

286
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,280
The Most Dangerous Game.

287
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,910
-Who's that?
-That's Count Zaroff.

288
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,690
Zaroff? With a "Z"?

289
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,150
And that will be
all for the news on the 20.

290
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,050
We've got curfews in effect tonight
for the following counties,

291
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,660
Napa, Solano, Contra Costa,
Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo.

292
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,690
So please, everyone, stay safe.

293
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,930
Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line.
You're not scared of the Zodiac?

294
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,330
Heck no,
he's only shooting those farm kids.

295
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,500
What scares me
is those hippies out in the Haight

296
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,210
with their free love and weird clothes.

297
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,170
We've got Alfred from Vacaville.

298
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,280
You know, I think
that was really offensive.

299
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,480
It's not just farm kids.

300
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,380
These are nice, clean-cut young people.

301
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,350
Hey, nobody's downplaying
the loss of human life here, Alfred.

302
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,890
Well, that last guy was.

303
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,990
We have good solid communities
out here in the North Bay.

304
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,920
Unlike in the city where you have
Satanists running around.

305
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,560
Well, you bring up a good question.
Is the Zodiac a Satanist?

306
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,030
Amber from Oakland,
what do you think?

307
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,330
I don't really know,

308
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,230
but I thought that code
they printed didn't look very Christian.

309
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,440
But I think the bigger problem
is that the papers shouldn't have printed

310
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,240
anything that the Zodiac
has been doing.

311
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,180
That they're just printing
all that stuff to sell more newspapers.

312
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,410
Well, the Zodiac did demand
they print his letters

313
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,480
or he'd kill more people.

314
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,880
Yeah, but he would have
done it anyway,

315
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,550
whether they printed it or not, I think.

316
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,090
An interesting point.

317
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,290
So, what do you think he'll do next?

318
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,880
-San Francisco Police Department.
-Yes. There's a fight in a cab!

319
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,780
What is your location?

320
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,680
3398 Washington,
at the corner of Cherry.

321
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,690
One's drunk and
we think he's robbing him.

322
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,070
-Is the crime still in progress?
-Yes, please hurry.

323
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,420
Oh, my God, look!

324
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,920
Nuts!

325
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,450
Whoever this is,
you owe me a new lamp.

326
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,360
Cabbie's been shot
three blocks from the Presidio.

327
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,090
Well, it wasn't me.
I've been with my bride all night.

328
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,390
-She can vouch.
-Go put on the Folgers.

329
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,060
You'll pick me up?

330
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,970
Let me just describe
the lamp you're gonna buy me.

331
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,640
-I just got to sleep.
-Suspect's Negro, male adult.

332
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,680
Walt's on scene, locked up the cab
and secured the crowd.

333
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,680
Seriously, dead asleep.
I lost feeling in my arm and everything.

334
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,280
Crackers.

335
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,460
You ever try Japanese food?

336
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,560
-What do you mean, like teriyaki?
-No, like the urchin.

337
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,870
-Raw fish.
-I'm eating here, Bill.

338
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,100
-I always wanted to try it.
-So, why don't you?

339
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,270
Haven't got around to it.

340
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,750
Evening, gents. What a lovely night
for a botched robbery.

341
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,990
Yeah, third this week.
Must be end of summer rush.

342
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,660
I got foot patrols going through the park,
dogs are on the way.

343
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,890
The victim's name is Paul Stine.
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

344
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,300
Suspect fired one shot
to the back of the head.

345
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,500
Driver's wallet
and car keys are missing.

346
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,740
How'd you know his name?

347
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,640
Leroy, there, came down
from Yellow Cab to ID him.

348
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,440
Neighborhood's pretty high-end
for this kind of thing,

349
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,340
so I already set up transpo for the cab.

350
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,310
-Coroner's here.
-Any witnesses?

351
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,210
Kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window.

352
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,450
-Did they hear a shot?
-No.

353
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,650
They first saw him in the front seat,

354
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,550
thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver.

355
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,550
Oldest kid ran downstairs to get
a better look from the dining room,

356
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,620
described him as a white male, glasses,

357
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,530
crew-cut, stocky,
and wearing a dark jacket.

358
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,830
Wait, I thought someone said
he was black.

359
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,730
That's the description
that went out to radio cars.

360
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,730
-We already corrected it.
-Oh, well, that's good.

361
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,770
-You guys need anything else?
-No. Get out of here.

362
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,240
Thanks. Happy Birthday.

363
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,270
-Wait, it's your birthday?
-Yep.

364
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,080
-That's great. Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

365
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,310
-Body or scene?
-It's your birthday, I'll take the body.

366
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,410
Dave, looks like he
wiped the cab down pretty good.

367
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,650
-We got some blood over here.
-Prints?

368
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,150
Could very well be.
We'll dust it at the Hall.

369
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,120
The odd thing is, we also got gloves.

370
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,500
-Suspect's?
-There's blood on them.

371
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,200
-Hey, Pete?
-Yeah, Dave.

372
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,460
You through over there,
can I get in there?

373
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,360
Yeah, I'm all set.

374
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,100
-Who rolled him?
-Stewarts.

375
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,010
I got a single 9mm casing.

376
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,380
Yeah, Luger.

377
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,350
Nothing from the crowd.

378
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,290
Okay.
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,

379
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,260
who also happens to be
a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian.

380
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,690
I flag a cab. I give him this address.

381
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,330
Did I give him this address?
Who's got the fare book?

382
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,200
Right here.

383
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,880
Washington and Maple.
That's one block east.

384
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,230
Lighting's the same over here,

385
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,130
so maybe I see
someone walking their dog.

386
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,660
You don't want any witnesses
so you tell him to go down a block.

387
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,870
He pulls over.

388
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,770
I wait for him to put it in park
because I'm smart

389
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,300
and I don't want him
hitting the accelerator

390
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,670
when I shoot him. May I?

391
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,570
He stops, puts it in park, boom.

392
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,040
I shoot him on the right side,
he slumps right?

393
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,840
Maybe you've got your hand
on his collar when you shoot.

394
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,310
All right. So, either way,

395
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,110
I just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat.

396
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,020
-So, why do you get in the front seat?
-For the money.

397
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,490
But he's dead.

398
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,290
You could just reach over the seat,
pull out his wallet.

399
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,190
You don't have to go
anywhere near the blood.

400
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,060
So, why'd he get in the front seat?

401
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,260
-I'm an idiot.
-But you're not an idiot.

402
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,100
You waited for him to put it in park.

403
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,340
-Right. Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

404
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,930
-Can I see that?
-Yeah.

405
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,300
I am an idiot.
I just killed a man for $8.25.

406
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:51,120
It's his third fare of the night.
Does anyone have any animal crackers?

407
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,510
-Animal crackers?
-They're in the car.

408
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,810
I'm saving those for later.

409
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,120
Fine.

410
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,760
-Are you a reporter?
-No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.

411
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,560
Sir, I was wondering
if I'd be able to talk to your children,

412
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,190
one at a time and preferably alone?

413
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,530
They just saw a man murdered.

414
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,470
I understand.

415
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,240
It looked like
they were drunk and fighting.

416
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,640
Yeah, and he had a rag.

417
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,540
He came around the side of the car
and he was wiping stuff.

418
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,010
-Did you get a chance to see his face?
-I did.

419
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,440
Well, sort of.

420
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,880
Did you remember what he looked like?

421
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,250
-Normal.
-Yeah.

422
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,350
"Normal?"

423
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,140
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

424
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,040
"I am the murderer of the taxi driver

425
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,510
"over by Washington Street
and Maple Street last night.

426
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,050
"To prove this, here is
a blood-stained piece of his shirt.

427
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,590
"I am the same man who did in
the people in the North Bay Area.

428
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,620
"The S.F. Police could have
caught me last night

429
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,030
"if they had searched the park properly

430
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,930
"instead of holding road races
with their motorcicles. "

431
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
-Gentlemen.
-Dave.

432
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,980
Paul. Where's the shirt?

433
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,270
Right there, boss.

434
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,840
There's your rag the kids talked about.

435
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,740
So he got in the front seat
to tear off a piece of the shirt.

436
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,840
-Is this on the record?
-Well, what do you think?

437
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,350
He confirms
the Vallejo and Napa killings.

438
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,250
Gets worse.

439
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,150
Robert, do you have a deadline?

440
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,290
What does he mean, it gets worse?

441
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,120
Read the last part.

442
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,020
"School children make nice targets.

443
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,360
"I think I shall wipe out
a school bus some morning.

444
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,630
"Just shoot out the front tire

445
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,530
"and then pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out. "

446
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,030
Jesus Christ, who's got school buses?
Department of Transportation?

447
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,670
-School board.
-All right.

448
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,670
I'm gonna need elimination prints
from your staff.

449
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,910
Has anyone here
didn't touch this letter?

450
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,010
On my way back to my desk.
They have phones, if you want.

451
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,080
We need to get matches
on blood and fabric.

452
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,350
I'll call Napa and Vallejo,

453
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,250
get the letters up to Sherwood
in Sacramento.

454
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,150
Dave, just one thing.
Is it true they got a print off the cab?

455
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,130
Yeah, we got a partial in blood.

456
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,860
-But that is not for publication.
-Hey, hey, come on.

457
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,100
Hey, it's me.

458
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,670
Did he say they got a print?

459
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,640
Partial.

460
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,840
Whoa.

461
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,840
Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt.

462
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,740
No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

463
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,310
Does he think that Zodiac's
gonna send another code?

464
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,210
'Cause I think Zodiac's
gonna send another code.

465
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,110
Jesus Harold Christ
on rubber crutches, Bobby.

466
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,480
What are you doing?

467
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,880
You're doing that thing,
the thing we discussed,

468
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,790
the thing that I don't like.
Starts with an "L."

469
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,390
-Oh, looming.
-Yeah.

470
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,390
In cooperation with SFPD,
we will run the Zodiac letter

471
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,390
without including the threat
on school children.

472
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,030
We don't want to start a city-wide panic

473
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,930
so I'm asking all of you
to please keep this confidential.

474
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,530
Just go about your daily business.

475
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,840
Thank you.

476
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,890
I packed you your carrots
and your soda and peanut butter, okay?

477
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,130
-Dad, you don't have to wait with me.
-I know.

478
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,280
You know what? You know what?
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

479
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,640
Come on.

480
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,760
What's that?

481
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,330
Similarities in the lowercase "r's. "

482
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,700
And that?

483
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,610
It is you waiting in the hall
if you speak again.

484
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,670
I have to concentrate.

485
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,210
Sorry.

486
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,380
"Sorry" counts as speaking.

487
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,090
There are similarities
in the lowercase "r's. "

488
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,610
We have to release the bus threat.

489
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,070
-It'll screw us.
-We're already screwed.

490
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,800
We just went from
"Routine Cabbie Shooting"

491
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,450
to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids. "

492
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,120
The Zodiac Killer
has come to San Francisco.

493
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,490
Confirmation tonight,

494
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,390
from the San Francisco
Police Department

495
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,420
that in his latest haunting letter,

496
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,460
which takes credit for the murder
of cab driver Paul Stine,

497
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,760
the Zodiac has threatened to,
"Wipe out a school bus

498
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,710
"and pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out. "

499
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,040
If you think you might know
who the Zodiac is,

500
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,080
you can call the San Francisco
Police Department's newest tip line.

501
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,100
Press conference is at 4:00.
We got to give them something.

502
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,070
We're coordinating
with the school board,

503
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,970
and we expect
a break in the case very soon.

504
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,910
-What do we really got?
-We're swamped.

505
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,380
When they can't get anyone
on the tip line

506
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,180
they call the switchboard
and keep getting put through.

507
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,280
You got any hard suspects?

508
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,180
About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

509
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,320
Well, can't you narrow it down?

510
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,220
I would love to,
if I could get out of this...

511
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,450
-Homicide, please hold.
-Yeah, hold, please.

512
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,960
We're gonna need to tell them
we got the entire force on this.

513
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,360
How many men can you give me?

514
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,260
Well, right now, it's you and Bill
and Monday's a school day.

515
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,360
Yeah, I know, Chief.
I have three daughters of my own.

516
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,360
Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong?

517
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,070
He's on the phone with Vallejo.

518
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,970
We're playing catch up, Jack.

519
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,000
I'd like to set up a meeting
with your survivor, Michael Mageau.

520
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,410
I can't. He skipped town.

521
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,310
The only guy who's seen Zodiac
without a mask is missing?

522
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,040
When he was still in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day long.

523
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,880
As soon as he got out, he split.

524
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,020
Really? Why?

525
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,920
I don't think he wanted
to have anything to do with this.

526
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,220
Can you send us everything
that you have?

527
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,490
Well, the road goes both ways.

528
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,320
Now, we need that print
you lifted from the cab

529
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,560
and we should have been in
on the handwriting.

530
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,600
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

531
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,960
Who should I talk to in Napa
so we can coordinate?

532
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,130
Talk to Ken Narlow.

533
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,040
We really should have been in
on the handwriting.

534
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,000
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

535
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,210
Listen, we're gonna need
your scene photos.

536
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,340
Can't help you.

537
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,240
Ken, I don't want to get into
a jurisdictional thing here.

538
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,280
No, no, no, no, no.
We didn't have a crime scene.

539
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,980
The ranger that found the kids literally
swept everything into a picnic blanket.

540
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,220
All we have are the Wing Walker prints.

541
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,420
The what?

542
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,220
Boot prints to and from the crime scene

543
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,960
were made by size
10-and-a-half Wing Walkers,

544
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,430
military-style boots
sold only at military PXs

545
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,790
designed to walk
on the wings of planes.

546
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,700
And you can't buy at a PX
without a military ID,

547
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,530
so our suspect could be military.

548
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,540
Did you guys narrow your list off of this?

549
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,440
-Yeah.
-Did Vallejo?

550
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,640
I don't know. I don't work in Vallejo.
I work here.

551
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,840
Great. I'm gonna need photos
of those boot prints.

552
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,080
Sure, if you send me the handwriting.

553
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,950
I thought Questioned Documents
already did.

554
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,550
Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.

555
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,450
All right.
I'll have Questioned Documents...

556
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,550
Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

557
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,220
We don't have telefax yet.

558
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,120
-Okay, I'll put it in the mail.
-We'll mail ours, too.

559
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,690
And call Mulanax in Vallejo.

560
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,590
-Maybe he can get you a mimeo.
-Right.

561
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,790
Why don't you just get a photo
off the original plaster cast?

562
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,260
We'd have to wait,
because they don't have a fax.

563
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,100
We don't have a fax, either.

564
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,930
Look, I'm just trying
to get us coordinated.

565
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,500
Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office?

566
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,240
Why would I call Solano?

567
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,140
Because the two kids that got killed
last Christmas were Solano's.

568
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,240
I thought they were Vallejo.

569
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,640
No, they were over the county line

570
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,550
so you're gonna need
to coordinate with them, too.

571
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,480
Okay.

572
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,280
Bill.

573
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,200
Can I have a word with you?

574
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,230
Where did you see this guy?

575
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,890
We got the call to circle the scene
and look for a Negro male adult.

576
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,100
Where was he?

577
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,000
On Jackson. Heading east.
About the middle of the block.

578
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,530
And this is three minutes
after the shooting?

579
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,030
Give or take. Yeah.

580
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,940
-And you were heading east or west?
-We were going west.

581
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,270
All right, so you're
on Jackson going west.

582
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,610
So the cab was one block
catty-corner southwest?

583
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,710
-Correct.
-Did you slow down?

584
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,550
-Of course we slowed down.
-All right.

585
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,450
Listen, Dispatch said
it was a Negro male.

586
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,250
That was corrected.

587
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,150
No, but at the time
they hadn't changed it.

588
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,920
This guy was white.

589
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,090
Right, not in a hurry.
Kind of lumbering along like...

590
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,970
Lumbering?
What do you mean, "lumbering"?

591
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,770
-Shuffling.
-Stocky? Had a crew cut?

592
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,600
Yeah, that's all correct.

593
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,930
Listen, it was dark.

594
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,600
The guy was wearing a dark jacket.
There's no way...

595
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,380
He would have been covered in blood.

596
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,840
Did you stop him?

597
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,510
Did you talk to him?

598
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,960
-Yes? No?
-No.

599
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,420
You need to get with a sketch artist.

600
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,460
We have to put out
a new composite right away.

601
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,430
Five persons have been murdered
in the San Francisco area,

602
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,060
and in each case the killer...

603
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,960
"I shall wipe out a school bus
some morning... "

604
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,570
San Francisco police...

605
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,740
...to see the Stones in concert
this Sunday.

606
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,910
The new letters
from the Zodiac Killer were sent to

607
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,080
the City room of the
San Francisco Chronicle.

608
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,580
One of the letters was...

609
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,480
Looming. No looming.

610
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,110
-Have you considered the water theory?
-What?

611
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,320
Geographically, every attack
takes place near a body of water

612
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,590
-or a water-based name.
-This is your water theory?

613
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,490
Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.

614
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,800
-Lake Herman.
-Wash-ington and Cherry?

615
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,960
You think?

616
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,100
No.

617
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,600
I'm reading this book,

618
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,330
Homicide Investigation
by Lemoyne Snyder...

619
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,840
-"Leymone. "
-... and he says you look for patterns,

620
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,740
-so I'm looking for patterns.
-No.

621
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,940
You can't think of this case
in normal police terms.

622
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,370
-Why not?
-You got four crime scenes.

623
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,640
Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.

624
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,490
Not a single usable print
at the first three or in any of the letters?

625
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,820
How does our master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent?

626
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,390
I mean, assuming the gloves are his,

627
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,960
he shoots the cabbie
and then takes them off?

628
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,230
So it's not his print?

629
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,090
Maybe, maybe not.
You're missing the point.

630
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,990
-The point is the first attack...
-David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

631
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,460
They both die.

632
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,370
From there on out,
he only manages to kill the girls.

633
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,930
-Not for lack of trying.
-Not for lack of trying.

634
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,970
Mageau lives, Ferrin dies.
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.

635
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,610
He gets so caught up with the women
he forgets to finish off the men.

636
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,080
Plus, they're all couples
and all on lover's lanes.

637
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,510
-Paul Stine is not.
-Exactly.

638
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,450
Single, male cab driver
on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit.

639
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,750
Doesn't fit.

640
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,430
So, why does Zodiac kill him?

641
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,260
He's breaking the pattern.

642
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,570
Yeah?

643
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,470
Someone claiming to be Zodiac
called Oakland PD a half-hour ago.

644
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,270
He says he's gonna call in on Jim
Dunbar's morning show in three hours.

645
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,910
On television?

646
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,810
He wants Melvin Belli on
to counsel him.

647
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,220
All right. All right.
Let's go wake up Melvin.

648
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,550
Animal crackers?

649
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,020
Glove box.

650
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,820
Are these windows bulletproof?

651
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,720
Yes, Melvin.
You don't have to lie down back there.

652
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,760
This man is a marksman,

653
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,660
could snuff me out
at a moment's notice.

654
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,160
Are you sure you're up for this?

655
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,070
Don't you worry about me, Inspector.
I'll be fine when the lights are on.

656
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,540
This man has asked for my help.

657
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,440
The man you're worrying about
snuffing you out?

658
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,690
What are these, cookies?

659
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,480
Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?

660
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,220
-Shit.
-KGO must have tipped other stations.

661
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,660
Get him talking.
Convince him to meet you somewhere.

662
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,160
If you see an opportunity,

663
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,060
we want you to suggest
Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown.

664
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,300
You'll be tracing the call?

665
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,200
Pacific Telephone says you need to
keep him on the line for 15 minutes.

666
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,780
We can do that, can't we, Jim?

667
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,490
Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.

668
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,720
Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

669
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,020
We interrupt our regular program
to bring you this news bulletin.

670
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,920
Welcome to this special edition
of our show

671
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,990
in which we are joined
by attorney Melvin Belli

672
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,960
who the Zodiac Killer
personally requested to appear.

673
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,430
Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

674
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,370
-Good morning, Melvin.
-Good morning, Jim.

675
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,470
So, the phone lines are open.
Mr. Belli is here.

676
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,040
Here to help, Jim.

677
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,940
Yes. Here to help.

678
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,720
And we ask the public not to call in,
so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.

679
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,660
I saw your Star Trek, by the way.
It was excellent.

680
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,160
A shame about the show.

681
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,860
Good people.

682
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,760
You know, I've often thought of
becoming an actor full-time.

683
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,070
What was your character's name?

684
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:39,310
-Gorgon.
-Gorgon. That's right.

685
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,710
Roll the tape. Get the tape.

686
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,480
Jim, we have a call. We're going live.

687
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,610
Hello?

688
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,660
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

689
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,720
Who am I speaking with?

690
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,400
This is the Zodiac speaking.

691
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:06,410
Is there something I can call you
that's a little less ominous?

692
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:12,000
Sam.

693
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,980
Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam,
and talk about this?

694
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,280
Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel.

695
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,610
Without anyone else or I'll jump...

696
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,510
Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.

697
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,790
-Sam.
-Yes?

698
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,320
Do you think you need medical care?

699
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,890
Medical, not mental.

700
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,860
Do you have health problems?

701
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,190
I'm sick. I have headaches.

702
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,030
Headaches?

703
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,460
I have headaches, too,

704
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,370
but a chiropractor stopped them
a week ago.

705
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,170
I think I can help you, Sam.

706
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,410
Sam?

707
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,210
He knows they're tracing his calls.

708
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,750
Sam, we'd like you to know
that we are not tracing these calls.

709
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:04,260
It's a long, difficult process
and ineffective with these short calls.

710
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,630
Sam?

711
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,210
We're not tracing these calls.
You have my word.

712
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,740
Okay.

713
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,640
Sam, you need to tell me
what your problem is.

714
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,010
I don't want to go to the gas chamber.

715
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,980
I have headaches.
I kill, I don't get them.

716
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,110
That is fucked up!

717
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,010
You want to live, don't you?
Well, this is your passport.

718
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,180
How long have you been
having these headaches?

719
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,220
Since I killed a kid.

720
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,060
-Do you have blackouts?
-Yes.

721
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,360
-Do you have fits?
-No. I just have headaches.

722
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,000
Did you attempt to call one other time

723
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,900
when F. Lee Bailey was with us
two or three weeks ago?

724
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,800
Yes.

725
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,700
And why did you want
to talk to Mr. Bailey?

726
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,640
Why do you wanna talk to me, Sam?

727
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,510
-I don't want to be hurt.
-Why is he calling?

728
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,410
-Hey, just a second, buddy.
-I don't wanna go to the gas chamber.

729
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,340
You won't get hurt if you talk to me.

730
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,240
And you're not going
to the gas chamber.

731
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,350
I wouldn't think they would ask
for capital punishment.

732
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,820
We should ask the District Attorney.

733
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,090
Do you want me to do that, Sam?

734
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:11,100
Do you want me to talk
to the District Attorney?

735
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,860
What was that, Sam?

736
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,560
I did not say anything.

737
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,810
We heard a scream.

738
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,740
That was my headache.

739
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,510
You sound like you're in
a great deal of pain.

740
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,310
My head aches. I'm so sick.

741
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,750
I'm gonna kill them.

742
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,650
-Oh, okay.
-I'm gonna kill those kids!

743
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,580
Fantastic.

744
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,760
Sam?

745
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:47,690
-Let's meet and talk. Just us.
-Okay.

746
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,060
How about Old St. Mary's Church
in Chinatown?

747
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,330
No.

748
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,230
In front of the Daly City
St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.

749
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,200
I'll see you there.

750
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,790
Take care of yourself, Sam.

751
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:29,370
My, my, my.

752
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:33,110
You fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting.

753
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,040
You know, the problem is,

754
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,940
I don't want to go to the gas chamber.
I have headaches.

755
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,880
I kill, I don't get them.

756
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,010
No, it's not him.

757
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,720
It's the voice.
The voice is too high. It's too young.

758
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,950
All right.
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

759
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,760
Do you have blackouts?

760
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,660
That's okay. I got it.

761
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,930
They pulled off the trace.

762
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,830
Our Daly City no-show
called from a mental institution.

763
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,200
Oakland PD's operator is sure

764
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,170
the man she talked to
had a deeper voice.

765
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,740
Calmer.

766
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,050
Might have actually been him.

767
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,250
"So I shall change
my way of collecting slaves.

768
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,520
"I shall no longer announce to anyone
when I commit my murders.

769
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,120
"They shall look like routine robberies,
killings of anger

770
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,430
"and a few fake accidents, et cetera.

771
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,760
"The police shall never catch me

772
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,670
"because I have been
too clever for them.

773
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,170
"I look like the description passed out
only when I do my thing.

774
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,810
"The rest of the time
I look entirely different.

775
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,580
"I shall not tell you what
my disguise consists of when I kill.

776
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,050
"As of yet I have left no
fingerprints behind me,

777
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,680
"contrary to what the police say.

778
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,800
"I wear transparent fingertips.

779
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,620
"All it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips.

780
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,460
"I enjoy needling the blue pigs.
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.

781
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,030
"You were using fire trucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

782
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,240
"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up

783
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,140
"to have your nose
rubbed in your booboos?

784
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,340
"If you cops think I am going to take
on a bus the way I stated I was,

785
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:22,850
"you deserve to have holes
in your heads. "

786
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,990
And you need to look at this.

787
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,720
"Take one bag of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer,

788
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,060
"one gallon of stove oil,

789
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,960
"and dump a few bags
of gravel on top... "

790
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,130
-Okay.
-It's a bomb.

791
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,000
Okay. We gotta call the Army
and see if this

792
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,900
science experiment could actually work.

793
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,730
Another cipher.

794
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,510
-When did these arrive?
-They arrived this morning.

795
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,880
Are you planning to publish?

796
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,780
Robert.

797
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,560
We should have a drink.

798
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,580
Thank you.

799
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,790
So, tell me about yourself.

800
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,760
-You married?
-Divorced. Two kids.

801
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,670
What do you do for fun?

802
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,070
I love to read.

803
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,630
-I enjoy books.
-Those are the same things.

804
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,840
Why you been going through my trash?

805
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,590
I'll come back to that.

806
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,850
How did you know
he was gonna send another code?

807
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,680
I just guessed.

808
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,580
-Just guessed.
-The first one seemed too easy.

809
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,850
All right, this can no longer be ignored.

810
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,290
-What is that you're drinking?
-It's an Aqua Velva.

811
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,040
You wouldn't make fun of it
if you tried it.

812
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,950
But who actually cracked the code?

813
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,610
A married couple who like puzzles.

814
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,940
So what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

815
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,710
-He's no expert.
-Right.

816
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,480
It's just a simple substitution code

817
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,380
like the one that
we used to do as boy scouts.

818
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,520
"A" is one, "B" is two.

819
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,950
We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.

820
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,850
Well, it's not that hard.
You just got to know where to start.

821
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,460
In the first cipher...

822
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,790
You actually carry that around with you?

823
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,690
-Why?
-No reason.

824
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,530
What's the most common double
consonant in the English language?

825
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,370
Consonant?

826
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,770
-The double "L."
-Double "L."

827
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,670
And what's the one word that we know
that he'll use in here, at least once?

828
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:27,870
-"Kill. "
-Right, "kill. "

829
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:29,440
So the Hardens start looking
for double symbols,

830
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,340
which they find here, here, and here.

831
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:33,410
Each with the same
two symbols preceding them.

832
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,950
So now they've got
a repeating four-letter word

833
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,980
ending with two symbols
that they assume stand for "L."

834
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,750
And since they think the whole word
is "kill" then...

835
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,650
Then you got your "K," you got your "I,"
and you're on your way.

836
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,120
But how do you go
from "A" is one and "B" is two

837
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:46,660
to figuring out this whole code?

838
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,570
Well, same way I did.
You go to the library.

839
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,760
In this book,

840
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,770
the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface.

841
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:00,970
Eight of the 26 symbols that
he suggests are found in this cipher.

842
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,470
Yeah, but there are non-letter symbols

843
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,980
because there's all
these medieval ones.

844
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,550
I thought they looked medieval, too.

845
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,310
But then I found a code
written in the Middle Ages.

846
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,150
Guess what it's called?

847
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,050
The Zodiac Alphabet.

848
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,790
Jesus.

849
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,790
What do you want out of this?

850
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,390
-What?
-What's your angle?

851
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,270
This is good business
for everyone but you.

852
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,300
How do you mean "business"?

853
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,140
Hey. Come to bed.

854
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,980
I'll be up in a minute.
I need to make a phone call.

855
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,450
-Hello?
-Bill?

856
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:53,990
There's not many basements
in California.

857
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,460
"Basement for future use. "

858
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,430
That's right.

859
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,330
I'll have Vallejo and Napa
check with their city planners.

860
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,410
-Get some sleep.
-Yeah, sure.

861
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,220
"Dear Melvin,
this is the Zodiac speaking.

862
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,150
"I wish you a happy Christmas.

863
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,420
"The one thing I ask of you is this.
Please help me.

864
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,960
"I cannot reach out for help
because this thing in me won't let me. "

865
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,000
Thank you.

866
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,900
"I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check

867
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,200
"and I am afraid I will lose control again

868
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,940
"and take my ninth
and possibly tenth victim. "

869
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,840
Melvin, he's reaching out to you.

870
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,770
Absolutely.

871
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,680
Inspectors, he sent this letter
directly to my residence.

872
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,310
It is a cry for help,
intended as a private communiquÃ©.

873
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,450
Which is why
you contacted the Chronicle.

874
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,680
The people have a right to know.
Toddy?

875
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,790
-When did the letter arrive?
-In the middle of last week.

876
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,960
I was away on safari.

877
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,430
What did you gentlemen
do for Christmas?

878
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,330
-You're looking at it.
-You must see Africa.

879
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,730
Cradle of civilization.
Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage.

880
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,040
-Back to the killer who wrote to you.
-Yes. Of course.

881
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,910
It is my belief
that he only penned this letter

882
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:18,910
because he couldn't get through to me
on the Dunbar show or here.

883
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,050
-He tried to contact you here?
-Several times.

884
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,680
I was out,
but he spoke with my housekeeper.

885
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,180
Didn't leave a number.

886
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,080
He's kind of crafty like that.
Do you mind if I speak to her?

887
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,720
Not at all. But the real story is the letter.

888
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,920
-I'll be back.
-Yeah.

889
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:35,430
She's right this way.

890
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:37,330
Inspector Toschi, it is my belief
this is a window into this man's soul.

891
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,670
Killing is his compulsion.

892
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,570
Even though he tries to ignore it,
it drives him.

893
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:46,500
It's in his blood.

894
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,610
Could be.
Or maybe he just likes the attention.

895
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,320
I didn't mean to scare you,
but your right rear wheel is loose.

896
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:39,920
Really?

897
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,460
If you like,
I could tighten the lugs up for you.

898
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,260
If you don't mind.

899
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,770
Well, you can't be too careful.

900
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,070
-All done.
-Thank you.

901
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,950
No problem. Have a good night.

902
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,780
It's okay.

903
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,430
Are you okay?

904
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:35,380
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

905
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:38,070
Must have been worse than I thought.

906
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,620
I can give you a lift to a service station.

907
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,720
Okay.

908
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,330
It's okay. Come on.

909
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,210
I didn't know you had a baby.

910
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,770
Oh, is that okay?

911
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,010
The more the merrier.

912
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,120
You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

913
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,240
-I think we just passed a filling station.
-It was closed.

914
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:39,570
Do you always go around
helping people in the night?

915
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,150
When I'm done with them,
they don't need much help.

916
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,850
It's okay.

917
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:50,750
Before I kill you,

918
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,830
I'm gonna throw your baby
out the window.

919
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,510
No! Help! Please! No!

920
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,310
She was on the side of the road.
She flagged me down.

921
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,150
-What happened to her?
-She said she jumped from a car.

922
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,050
I found her like this.

923
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,980
-What is it?
-Please, he said...

924
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,990
-It'll be okay.
-Tried to kill me.

925
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,620
My baby!

926
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,520
-Where's her baby?
-She didn't have one when I stopped.

927
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:37,030
Where's your baby?

928
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,170
Jesus.

929
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,660
-You hid it?
-In case he came back.

930
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,430
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

931
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,360
"By the way, have you cracked
the last cipher I sent you?

932
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,770
"I'm mildly curious as to how much
money you have on my head now.

933
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,600
"I hope you do not think I was the one
who wiped out that blue meanie

934
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,470
"with a bomb at the cop station,

935
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,580
"even though I talked about
killing children with one. "

936
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,780
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

937
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:32,090
"I'd like to see some nice Zodiac
buttons wandering around town.

938
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,450
"Everyone else has these buttons

939
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,960
"like peace, black power,
and Melvin eats blubber, et cetera.

940
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,590
"It would cheer me up considerably

941
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,490
"if I saw a lot of people
wearing my button.

942
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,960
-"Please no nasty ones. "
-"This is the Zodiac speaking.

943
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,760
"I shot a man
sitting in a parked car with a. 38.

944
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,770
"Zodiac 12, SFPD zero. "

945
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,140
"The map coupled with this code
will tell you where the bomb is set.

946
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,450
"You have until next fall to dig it up. "

947
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,480
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

948
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,350
"I'm rather unhappy because you people

949
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:05,250
"will not wear
some nice Zodiac buttons.

950
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,150
"So, I now have a little list,
starting with the woman and her baby

951
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,290
"that I gave a rather interesting ride

952
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:11,190
"for a couple of hours one evening,
a few months back,

953
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:13,520
"that ended in my burning her car
where I found them. "

954
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,860
We're really not gonna run
any more of his letters?

955
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,160
The new policy. Our brothers in blue
want us to hold back

956
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,600
and see how he reacts.

957
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,500
Four letters in three months,

958
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,700
and this is the first mention
of Kathleen Johns. That's very weird.

959
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:29,250
That's because he's full of shit.

960
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:32,410
What do you mean?

961
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:35,310
You don't know?

962
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,180
Welcome. Please put your stuff down.
You're going down five rows and left.

963
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:43,050
Looking for the Modesto Bee
from March.

964
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,760
I'm going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit.

965
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,990
-Left.
-Left.

966
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:51,890
-What am I looking for?
-Kathleen Johns.

967
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,900
Also probably you wanna
pull the Chron from...

968
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,070
You know, never mind. I'll see to that.

969
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,100
Okay, look at this letter again.
The part about Kathleen Johns.

970
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,570
Tell me what facts he gives.

971
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,850
-A woman and her baby abducted.
-Fact.

972
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:10,220
-The car on fire.
-Okay, now,

973
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,100
look at the article from the Bee.

974
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,420
Seen it yet?

975
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,320
Everything in the letter
already appeared in the article.

976
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,400
And he's done it before.

977
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,460
Officer Richard Radetich,
shot sitting in his car.

978
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,200
Zodiac claimed that he shot someone
in their car.

979
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,460
Couple days after this article came out.

980
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,940
The police already had somebody
in custody.

981
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,840
Zodiac didn't do it,
but took credit for it anyway

982
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,510
because he's in it for the press.

983
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,480
He even stole his symbol.

984
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,380
-What?
-Yeah. Shit.

985
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,610
If I show you something,
you promise not to tell anyone?

986
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,920
-Who would I tell?
-Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.

987
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,530
That's the only place
that word and that symbol

988
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:57,430
ever appeared together
before the letters.

989
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,700
The guy stole his logo off a watch.

990
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,100
How can somebody
who's killed 13 people do...

991
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,430
He claims he's killed 13 people,

992
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:04,030
but which ones
can we actually confirm?

993
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:08,110
There's three in Vallejo,
one in Berryessa, the cabbie. That's it.

994
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:12,240
Bobby, you almost look disappointed.

995
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,610
Chief's pulling everybody off buses.

996
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,880
Business as usual.

997
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,650
Something'll shake loose.

998
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,550
Not a peep in four months.

999
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,850
First he won't shut up and now...

1000
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:26,800
Maybe we drove him underground.

1001
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,330
Maybe he's gone.

1002
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:31,990
311 at 582 Haight, cross at Biltmore.
There's a male...

1003
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:35,470
-Happy birthday, Bill.
-Thanks.

1004
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,580
Does it ever bother you
that people call you Shorty?

1005
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,950
Does it bother you
that people call you a retard?

1006
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,550
-Nobody calls me that.
-Right.

1007
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,450
As governor,
I pledge to use all my influence

1008
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,120
to make sure that Darlene Ferrin's killer
is brought to justice.

1009
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,860
I believe some clues were overlooked
in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

1010
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:08,530
-I believe her murder was premeditated.
-Who is that?

1011
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,470
Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo.
She's running for governor.

1012
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,570
I believe that the police department
either did not have the money, the time

1013
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:16,510
or, yes, the inclination...

1014
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,640
Sayonara, police endorsement.
Good work, Flo.

1015
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:22,850
Does anyone ever call me names, or...

1016
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,820
You mean like retard?

1017
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,780
Yeah.

1018
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,990
No.

1019
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:37,530
Shit. Fuck. Oh, my God. Jesus.

1020
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,630
Tell me that's not a piece
of bloody shirt!

1021
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,300
Fuck! Holy fucking crap!

1022
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,720
"I feel it in my bones,
you ache to know my name

1023
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,810
"and so I'll clue you in.

1024
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:53,480
"But then, why spoil the game?
Happy Halloween. "

1025
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,850
Paul, you did call him
a latent homosexual

1026
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,220
in at least one of your articles.

1027
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,750
Dave. I want a gun.

1028
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,320
A gun?

1029
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:13,030
You're in Herb Caen.

1030
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,930
"Paul Avery's investigation
has won him the accolade

1031
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:17,530
"of a message from the Zodiac warning,
'You are doomed. '

1032
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,640
"As a result, several crime newsmen
are wearing lapel buttons reading,

1033
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,040
"'I am not Paul Avery. "'

1034
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,240
You should sell these.
You could do well.

1035
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,480
It's been a windfall, since
they published the threat on my life.

1036
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,080
I got the leads
coming out of the woodwork.

1037
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,980
There's one guy down in Riverside.

1038
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,350
I'm gonna drive down
and see him tonight.

1039
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:39,100
-You wanna tag along?
-No, I have a date.

1040
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,620
-Really?
-Who is this guy?

1041
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,030
He wishes to remain anonymous.
I wish to remain infamous.

1042
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,140
So we're going to get along great.

1043
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:58,770
Hi. Good evening. Hi.
I'm looking for a Melanie.

1044
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:01,510
Yes.
It's the young lady sitting by herself.

1045
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,480
Thank you.

1046
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:10,690
You must be Melanie.

1047
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,590
-Which would make you Robert.
-It would.

1048
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:14,590
Glynnis told me lots about you.

1049
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,790
-And you have wine, great.
-I do.

1050
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,740
Great. How late am I?

1051
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,500
Just a few minutes, really.
I just got here myself.

1052
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,140
Traffic's bumper to bumper.
I was at the gun range.

1053
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,310
-Glynnis said you were a cartoonist.
-Oh, yeah.

1054
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:32,470
Well, what're you doing at a gun range?

1055
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,180
Reading.

1056
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,120
Get some more...
You need some more napkins.

1057
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,280
So, you work with Glynnis.

1058
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,580
-For her, actually.
-For her?

1059
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,620
Oh, well...

1060
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,120
My children are terrified of Glynnis.

1061
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,290
Me, too.

1062
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,300
So, the gun range?

1063
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,200
We're... I'm working on...
Do you know the Zodiac?

1064
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,770
-Yeah.
-I'm working with...

1065
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,670
-Do you know who Paul Avery is?
-Sounds kind of familiar.

1066
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,170
He's the writer
that the Zodiac threatened.

1067
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,470
Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.

1068
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,380
Well, I work near him
and he's going down tonight

1069
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:10,920
to track an anonymous tipster
down in Riverside.

1070
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:13,950
Where is Riverside?

1071
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,790
It's near L.A.

1072
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:19,430
Oh, wow. I don't think Paul knows
that it's that far away.

1073
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,630
Sounds kind of dangerous.

1074
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,760
Yeah. How do you mean?

1075
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,770
Well, you said it was
an anonymous tip, right?

1076
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:31,900
Yeah.

1077
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,470
So it could be an ambush.
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.

1078
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:38,870
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

1079
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,150
Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.

1080
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:48,450
So, do you know what's good here?

1081
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:52,430
I've never been here before.

1082
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,530
The pasta, spaghetti?

1083
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:00,330
Are you ready to order yet?

1084
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,270
Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka.
But could you do it in a cream sauce?

1085
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,170
Of course.

1086
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,780
Maybe give us another minute?

1087
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,510
Do you have any change?

1088
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,550
Oh, wait, no wait, hold on.

1089
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,550
Nope. That's a penny.

1090
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,050
Do you have to make a phone call?

1091
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:25,560
Yeah, you know,
when you were saying that the Zodiac...

1092
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,890
You know, when you said it
was dangerous, I just thought

1093
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:29,790
-that it is dangerous, and it's...
-Stupid?

1094
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:31,730
Stupid. And I just thought that

1095
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:35,510
I should call his wife
and just see if she's heard from him.

1096
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,700
I have some change.

1097
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,360
Okay. Well, she said
she'd call when she heard from him.

1098
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,730
-Good.
-Yeah.

1099
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:08,130
Melanie, I should really go home
and wait for the call.

1100
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,740
Is this some sleazy plan
to get me to go home with you?

1101
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:17,310
What? No.

1102
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,380
I'll get the food to go.

1103
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,950
Hello!

1104
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,240
Hi! I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.

1105
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:03,350
Anything?

1106
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:07,860
You don't have to stay.

1107
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,390
Are you kidding?

1108
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:12,530
This is the most interesting date
I've ever had.

1109
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:17,970
-Paul?
-Robert?

1110
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:19,640
-Yes.
-You sitting down?

1111
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,840
Yes.

1112
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,740
You're not gonna believe this.

1113
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:23,840
Dave!

1114
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,740
In a bizarre twist,
the hunted has become hunter.

1115
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,440
San Francisco Chronicle reporter
and Zodiac target Paul Avery

1116
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,310
claims to have uncovered
new information

1117
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,480
regarding the only unsolved homicide
in Riverside County's history,

1118
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,050
a 1966 Southern California murder,

1119
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,320
that Avery now believes
was the Zodiac's first victim.

1120
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:44,590
What?

1121
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,860
-He didn't call you about this?
-Hang on!

1122
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,460
The Riverside killer
wrote to the press letters

1123
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,360
that I then took personally to
the Office of Questioned Documents.

1124
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,300
And what did this expert tell you?

1125
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,310
What I knew in my gut, Ron.

1126
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,210
The handwriting matches Zodiac's.

1127
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,740
How'd he get the evidence
out of Riverside?

1128
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,180
He took it to Sherwood
without telling us, the son of a bitch.

1129
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:03,880
You know how bad this looks?

1130
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,780
Hey, how do we know
that this lead is real?

1131
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,080
It's very real. You know how I know?

1132
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,460
Because I saw it on TV.

1133
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,530
Excuse me.

1134
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:19,060
Dave.

1135
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:20,260
Hi.

1136
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,160
Dave, you know Mel Nicolai.
He's working the case for Justice.

1137
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,770
Good to see you, Mel.

1138
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:25,670
All due respect,
can someone explain to me

1139
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,470
why I'm reading
about breaks in this case

1140
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:29,370
in the Chronicle instead
of getting calls from you?

1141
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:30,570
We got screwed.

1142
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:31,840
Dave, come on.

1143
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,740
You do get your name in the paper a lot.
People talk.

1144
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:35,810
I don't ever talk about an open
investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

1145
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,780
Dave? Hey. Hi.

1146
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,650
Paul Avery. Can I catch a ride
with you gents when we get there?

1147
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,320
Not a good idea, Paul.

1148
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,020
He's gonna make me take a cab
when we're going to the same place.

1149
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,030
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for choosing PSA.

1150
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:52,690
-Fair enough. Fair enough.
-Please take your seats at this time.

1151
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,900
Remember, smoking is
in the last six aisles only.

1152
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:58,130
Enjoy your flight.

1153
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,640
-Cross? Hi.
-Yeah.

1154
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:05,810
-Detective David Toschi, SFPD.
-How are you doing?

1155
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,880
Great. Thanks for having us
down today.

1156
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,780
Not at all.
I hear you have some files for us.

1157
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,080
I'll show you mine. You show me yours.

1158
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,490
-Frisco huh?
-That's right. San Francisco.

1159
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,650
-Ken Narlow from Napa.
-Ken.

1160
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,450
-Mel Nicolai, Justice.
-Mel.

1161
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,520
Here's what we know.

1162
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,420
Cheri Jo Bates attended
Riverside Community College.

1163
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:24,090
She studies in the library
the night of October 30th, 1966.

1164
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,500
She leaves with an unidentified male
at closing, 9:00 p. m.

1165
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,400
Her body's found the next morning
in a parking lot, stabbed to death.

1166
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,710
Her car is disabled.

1167
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,610
Someone cut the coil in the distributor,
the battery died.

1168
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,680
The someone comes back,
offers to help.

1169
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,180
-Like Kathleen Johns.
-Who?

1170
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:45,410
A woman outside of Modesto,
might be a Zodiac victim.

1171
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,180
Might. Might be.
I have her comp right here in this file.

1172
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,190
Okay.

1173
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,090
A typewritten confession was sent
to the Riverside Press Enterprise

1174
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,290
on November 29th,
a month after Bates's murder.

1175
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,160
They ran it.

1176
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,830
"I'm not sick. I am insane.
But that will not stop the game.

1177
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:05,630
"This letter should be published
for all to read. "

1178
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,440
He wants to be published.
He calls it a game.

1179
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,910
I mean, this could be our boy.

1180
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:10,810
Six months later, the police,
the girl's father, and the paper,

1181
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,290
they all received these.

1182
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,980
Double postage, just like Zodiac.

1183
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,390
These are what Sherwood Morrill
matched to the Zodiac letters?

1184
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,360
These and the desktop. Don.

1185
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:31,940
This was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in RCC storage.

1186
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:43,510
Sherwood got
a handwriting match off wood?

1187
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:47,310
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1188
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,010
To be honest with you,

1189
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:50,910
our letters and your letters,
I don't see it.

1190
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,380
How did Paul Avery
get his hands on the exemplars?

1191
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:55,590
I gave them to him.

1192
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,490
We talked on the phone the other day
for about an hour.

1193
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:59,120
And I told him you were gonna be here.

1194
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,890
-You told him we were meeting?
-Yeah.

1195
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,790
I also told him
we don't think this is Zodiac.

1196
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:05,090
Okay, wait a minute.

1197
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,260
-You don't think this is Zodiac?
-We got a guy we like for it.

1198
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:10,200
We don't have enough
to pin it on him yet,

1199
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,530
but we're pretty sure it's him.

1200
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,440
If you don't think this is Zodiac,
then why give anything to Avery?

1201
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,240
I'm trying to cooperate.

1202
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,140
Oh, that's how you cooperate?
By giving information to reporters?

1203
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,780
Look, I don't know
about the handwriting,

1204
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,110
but Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1205
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:24,010
So, let's just say
that your guy did Cheri Jo.

1206
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,850
He types the confession.

1207
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,750
Zodiac reads it in the paper,
and he writes a letter taking credit for it.

1208
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,720
Now, that's something he's done before.

1209
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,620
Look, now you have everything we have.

1210
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,320
But, in my opinion,
you guys came south for nothing.

1211
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,730
FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.

1212
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:40,930
I don't care what he says.
This still could be Z.

1213
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,770
The problem is
the entire state already thinks it is.

1214
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:48,550
Well, there's your press agent.
Talk to him about it.

1215
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,940
I come in peace.
I don't want any trouble.

1216
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,980
I really don't want to talk to you
right now, Paul. Not now.

1217
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,050
-Just trying to do my job.
-Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.

1218
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,080
We're already screwed with
the amount of tips we got on this thing,

1219
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,120
and you just freaked out the entire state.

1220
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,020
I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ
looking at me sideways

1221
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,420
and Riverside's telling me
I'm on a snipe hunt!

1222
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,330
Jesus. Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift.
I gave that to you.

1223
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,830
You and Armstrong
never would have found her.

1224
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:15,730
This may not be Zodiac.
Does that matter to you?

1225
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,630
-What if it is?
-Does it matter that Riverside may not

1226
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,530
be able to make a case
against their suspect because of you?

1227
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,700
Tell it to Sherwood.
I'm out here, beating the bushes,

1228
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,470
trying to draw him out.
We're in this together.

1229
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,940
No, we're not in anything together, Paul,

1230
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:26,840
because I'm not interested
in upping my circulation.

1231
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:28,810
Oh, boy. He wrote me.
He threatened my life.

1232
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,610
Hey, Bullitt!

1233
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:35,590
Been a year-and-a-half,
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1234
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:39,590
-Go fuck yourself.
-Happily.

1235
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,190
You should have called me, Paul.

1236
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:49,630
Thank you.

1237
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:04,050
-Did you see this?
-Unfortunately, yes.

1238
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:06,750
Here comes every lunatic in California.

1239
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:08,990
I'm the Zodiac.

1240
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:10,650
And how did you kill your victims?

1241
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:12,550
With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1242
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:14,790
All I'm authorized to tell you

1243
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:16,460
is that he's still under
government employment.

1244
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,360
-And who authorized you to tell me this?
-That's all I'm authorized to say.

1245
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:21,530
Only a little rat bastard like Andre

1246
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,770
could have done something
like cut off all the victims' hands.

1247
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:26,430
Zodiac didn't cut off
any of the victims' hands.

1248
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,840
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

1249
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,740
Travis and I worked here
side by side for 10 years.

1250
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,380
His foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin.

1251
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:37,250
-Coincidence?
-I don't know.

1252
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,160
You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1253
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,420
Have you considered
the killer might be Paul Avery?

1254
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,620
Frequently.

1255
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:50,530
He was drinking Coors,
getting a load on.

1256
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,460
Starts talking about hunting people.
Like that book.

1257
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,200
Says how you can put a light
at the end of a gun

1258
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:58,200
to use as a sight in the dark.

1259
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,070
-He said that?
-Yeah.

1260
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:02,980
So I asked him,
"How would you get away with it?"

1261
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:05,040
And he said, "It would be easy

1262
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,940
"'cause there'd be no real motive
to the thing. "

1263
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,480
Then he said he'd write letters
to the police

1264
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:11,450
and call himself Zodiac
to mess with them.

1265
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:13,150
Leigh liked messing with people.

1266
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:15,050
-You're positive he said "Zodiac"?
-Yeah.

1267
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,150
I thought it was a stupid name.
So I told him.

1268
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,360
He got up all upset and said,
"I don't care what you think.

1269
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,890
"I've thought about it a long time
and that's the name I'm gonna use. "

1270
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:27,630
Did you feel like he'd been
thinking about it a long time?

1271
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,070
He was raw about losing his job
at the school.

1272
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,400
He talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus

1273
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,510
and picking off the little darlings.

1274
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:40,010
-He actually used those words?
-That's what made me remember.

1275
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,180
Afterwards, I told my wife
I didn't wanna see him again.

1276
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,650
And I haven't since.

1277
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:48,550
Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1278
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,150
I know he's been up to that lake
a bunch of times.

1279
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:53,320
Lake Berryessa?
Did you ever go with him?

1280
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:55,790
Couple times. We went fishing
by Putah Creek near there.

1281
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,530
Tell him when you put it together.

1282
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:01,430
About a year ago, in the paper,
there was a story about the Zodiac.

1283
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:06,230
And it all comes back.
I tried to call the local cops.

1284
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,240
They blew him off.
Thought he was a nut.

1285
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,140
And you're sure
the conversation you had about Zodiac

1286
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:15,040
took place on January 1 st, 1968?

1287
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,850
It couldn't have been any later.

1288
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:21,800
I started a new job in L.A.
on January 20th.

1289
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,850
I had to move.

1290
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:25,750
-This is my problem. This guy...
-Arthur Leigh Allen?

1291
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:28,320
This guy, Leigh,
just lays out his entire evil plan

1292
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:30,730
to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1293
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:32,630
I don't know.
He's angry, he's been drinking,

1294
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:35,530
been thinking about it for a while.
I can buy that.

1295
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,770
So why didn't Cheney
contact us sooner?

1296
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,840
I checked. He did.

1297
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,740
First recorded contact
with the police department about Allen

1298
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,840
was in Pomona. January 1 Oth, 1970.

1299
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,040
He just got lost in the shuffle.

1300
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,810
Did Cheney have anything
against Allen?

1301
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:50,210
Did Allen screw his wife or anything?

1302
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:52,010
We're gonna do
a full background check.

1303
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,720
But I got to tell you, I like this guy.

1304
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,660
So, let's pull
some handwriting samples.

1305
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,260
Hi. I talked to Sherwood.
He got the samples.

1306
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,340
-What are you having?
-BLT.

1307
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,830
So, the check stubs are a wash.
There's not enough handwriting.

1308
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:11,470
The application's got more,
but it doesn't look like Z's,

1309
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,100
so he can't rule him in.
But he can't rule him out, either.

1310
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,520
-Well, that's vague.
-He needs more samples.

1311
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,680
Also, our guy is a pervert.

1312
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:23,610
When Mel got the application
from Valley Springs,

1313
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:25,580
they told him that
Allen had been fired for touching kids.

1314
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,220
-Touching?
-Polite euphemism.

1315
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:31,750
-So what do you want to do?
-Make some phone calls.

1316
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:34,990
-Are you done with the fries?
-Go ahead.

1317
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,360
Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance

1318
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,260
to look at the copies
of the Zodiac letters we sent you?

1319
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,560
Yeah.
Some of this stuff is pretty creepy.

1320
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:45,610
-Yeah, we know that.
-I mean, creepy like Leigh.

1321
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:47,840
He misspells words like that.
He thinks it's funny.

1322
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,440
What about the handwriting?

1323
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,340
I don't know.
Don't you have experts for that stuff?

1324
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,380
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.

1325
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,580
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1326
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,980
The letters are a little too neat

1327
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,880
for someone to have written
with the wrong hand.

1328
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,320
But not for Leigh, right.

1329
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,220
-What do you mean?
-He's ambidextrous.

1330
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,220
He can write with either hand.
Didn't you guys know that?

1331
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,730
In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.

1332
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:14,630
Job applications,
letters to friends, et cetera.

1333
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,170
But he writes the Zodiac letters
with his right hand

1334
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,810
producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.

1335
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,670
We got to see this guy, Chief.

1336
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:24,970
-Where is he?
-Vallejo.

1337
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,880
He works at Union Oil in Pinole.
His brother's up there, too.

1338
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,680
See them both.

1339
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,580
Make sure you call Mulanax.
It is his backyard.

1340
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:34,150
Oh, right, because that
worked so well for us in Riverside.

1341
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,120
Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.

1342
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,770
You can talk to him in here.
Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1343
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,880
I'll go get him for you.

1344
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,240
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1345
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,480
Well, Bill talked to the informants.
He leads, we follow?

1346
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:04,210
It's okay by me.

1347
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:19,730
Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.

1348
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,400
This is Inspector Dave Toschi
and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1349
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,400
We're investigating the Zodiac murders
in San Francisco and Vallejo.

1350
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:29,870
Please, sit down.

1351
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,350
The informant notified us
that you made certain statements

1352
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,920
11 months prior
to the first Zodiac murder.

1353
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:45,590
If they're true,
they're quite incriminating.

1354
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,720
Do you recall
having any such conversation?

1355
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,360
-No.
-Have you ever read

1356
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,260
or heard anything about the Zodiac?

1357
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:53,760
When it was first in the paper.

1358
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,660
But I didn't follow it
after those first reports.

1359
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,470
-Why not?
-Too morbid. I...

1360
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,340
I told all this to the other officer.

1361
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,840
-Which other officer?
-From Vallejo.

1362
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,780
Do you remember his name?

1363
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,680
No, but it was right after
the murder at the lake.

1364
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:14,080
And what did you tell this officer?

1365
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:17,550
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point
that weekend to skin dive.

1366
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,800
That I was alone
but I met a couple there.

1367
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,860
I have their names at home
if you want them.

1368
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,930
That would be great, Arthur.

1369
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:29,840
-Leigh.
-What?

1370
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:33,240
Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1371
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:36,870
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me.

1372
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,380
It was around 4:00.
But I forgot to tell the other officer that.

1373
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,550
-Neighbor's name?
-Bill White.

1374
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:48,220
He died a week or so afterwards.

1375
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:51,670
Heart attack.
So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1376
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:55,690
The knives I had in my car
with the blood on them,

1377
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:59,560
that blood came from a chicken
that I killed for dinner.

1378
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:04,230
-What?
-I had knives in my car that weekend.

1379
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:09,550
Maybe Bill saw them
and called the other officer on me.

1380
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,040
Well, we'll be checking in on that.

1381
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:14,840
Well, let me ask you something else.

1382
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,810
Were you ever in Southern California
at any time in 1966?

1383
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:22,350
-Is this about the Riverside killing?
-Yes.

1384
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:25,350
Well, I guess I was there
around that time.

1385
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:29,170
I used to go down there a lot.
I like the auto races.

1386
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,360
Informant says that
you're ambidextrous?

1387
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,900
No, that's untrue.

1388
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:40,380
You can't write with both hands?

1389
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,400
My teachers tried to make me
when I was a kid, but I couldn't.

1390
01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:46,570
I'm left-handed.

1391
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:51,090
He also said that you made statements
about killing school children.

1392
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,350
That is...

1393
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:55,250
That is horrible. That is...
That's a horrible thing to say.

1394
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,620
So, you weren't angry
about being fired from Valley Springs

1395
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:02,260
for touching your students?

1396
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,400
I'm not the Zodiac.

1397
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:17,170
And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.

1398
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,310
That's a nice watch.

1399
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:24,180
Thank you.

1400
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:26,080
May I see it?

1401
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:29,450
May I see it?

1402
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:42,100
Where'd you get it?

1403
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,000
It was a Christmas gift
from my mother two years ago.

1404
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:46,830
That's very sweet.

1405
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:49,070
So, tell me something, Arthur.

1406
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:51,010
You don't remember anyone

1407
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:54,890
you might have had a conversation with
regarding the Zodiac?

1408
01:25:56,010 --> 01:26:01,460
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker
at Vallejo Recreation.

1409
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,620
But I couldn't be positive.

1410
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:06,830
I used to work there when...

1411
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,560
The Most Dangerous Game.

1412
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:15,030
What?

1413
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:16,930
The Most Dangerous Game.
That's why you're here, isn't it?

1414
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,140
It was my favorite book in high school.

1415
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,040
It's about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on this island.

1416
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:25,210
Because he was
tired of hunting animals,

1417
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:26,910
he hunted the people for the challenge.

1418
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:28,810
And man is the most
dangerous animal of all?

1419
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:33,680
That's the whole point of the story.

1420
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:36,250
Great book.

1421
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,590
Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.

1422
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,060
May I go?

1423
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,930
Sure.

1424
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:57,870
-Thanks for your time.
-I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1425
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,240
I look forward to the day

1426
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:06,020
when police officers
are no longer referred to as pigs.

1427
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,880
Thanks.

1428
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:11,190
We'll be in touch.

1429
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,600
So does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation?

1430
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:29,880
These are copies of some
of the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1431
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:32,310
We'd like you to take a look at them.

1432
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:35,710
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1433
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:37,680
Well, we're looking at him.

1434
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:39,310
Are you going to arrest him?

1435
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,220
Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people
just because we're interested in them.

1436
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:44,890
Well, Leigh's always been troubled.

1437
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:47,130
Is it true about the children?

1438
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,190
Unfortunately.

1439
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,090
We don't see him much anymore
since we found out.

1440
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,790
What are your feelings
about Don Cheney?

1441
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:55,930
Don Cheney? My old roommate?

1442
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:58,330
-Was he the one who contacted you?
-That's confidential.

1443
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,140
Well, Don's a very reliable guy.

1444
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,040
If he were to tell you something,
I'd believe it to be true.

1445
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:05,570
-This one.
-What about it?

1446
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,480
Here, where he spells
"Christmas" with two "S's. "

1447
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:09,710
We got a Christmas card from Leigh
a couple years ago.

1448
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:11,750
He spelled it the exact same way.
Christ-mass.

1449
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,880
-Would you still have that?
-I can look for it.

1450
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:17,960
Thank you. That'd be great.

1451
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,960
Is there anything else
we can do to help?

1452
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:22,920
The brother said
he would search Leigh's apartment

1453
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,260
next time he went out of town.

1454
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,160
-That gets you around a warrant.
-For the time being.

1455
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,500
If we do find something,
Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,

1456
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,770
and we could search the place properly.

1457
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,340
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop

1458
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,240
who interviewed Leigh Allen
two days after the Berryessa murders.

1459
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:38,110
Doesn't remember how he got onto him,

1460
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,010
but didn't think he looked like a killer
so he didn't like him for Z.

1461
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:43,110
-But you do?
-I wish I could've taken the guy in there.

1462
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:46,050
Take it slow, Dave.
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.

1463
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,080
A match'll get us farther
on the warrants.

1464
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,220
-Avery's on two.
-Tell him to screw.

1465
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,870
You want me to communicate that
verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1466
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,540
Christ, kid.

1467
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:10,770
Yeah.

1468
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:12,670
-Paul, I've been thinking...
-Oh, God save us all.

1469
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:14,640
The letter to Melvin Belli

1470
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,540
was sent exactly one year
after the Lake Herman Road murder.

1471
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,510
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father

1472
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,420
was sent exactly six months
after her death.

1473
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,880
-She was killed a day before Halloween.
-Yeah.

1474
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:25,990
And you received a Halloween card...

1475
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:27,890
You know, these are all fascinating
pieces of news, Robert,

1476
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:30,590
it's a bit early in the day.

1477
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:33,610
Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.

1478
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:40,070
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.
-No, no, no.

1479
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,200
-I just thought that...
-No, no, no.

1480
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:49,520
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1481
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,480
This sample matches the canceled
checks and the application?

1482
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:55,320
Perfectly.

1483
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,220
So we've just retested the left hand.
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.

1484
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:00,520
In 38 years, I've never seen anyone
that ambidextrous.

1485
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,500
Both hands would have commonalities.

1486
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:06,600
I'm sorry.

1487
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,500
Just not gonna work.

1488
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:12,170
-Homicide, Toschi.
-Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.

1489
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:14,670
Hey. Mulanax. Yeah.

1490
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,510
We struck out with the judge.

1491
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:18,240
He won't sign off on a warrant
for Allen's house.

1492
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,140
-Why not?
-Said it wasn't enough.

1493
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:22,280
Now, unless we bring him a handwriting
match or some evidence that...

1494
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:24,710
How are we gonna get evidence
if we can't toss the house?

1495
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,180
I don't know.

1496
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,230
-I truly am sorry.
-No, no. Thank you, Jack.

1497
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:33,260
What do you wanna do?

1498
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:34,690
Don't know what I can do
without Vallejo.

1499
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:36,590
We need Allen's right hand.
We can't get it without a warrant.

1500
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:39,530
Are there other guys
you should be looking at?

1501
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:41,730
Only, what?

1502
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:43,760
Twenty-three hundred?

1503
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:45,770
Okay, then.

1504
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:50,270
Okay, then.

1505
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:19,530
Paul, you wrote the Justice Department

1506
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,780
asking to be put in charge
of the Zodiac investigation?

1507
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,680
I merely suggested...

1508
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,080
On our letterhead?

1509
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,980
...that those with intimate knowledge
of the case

1510
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:33,110
create an information clearinghouse

1511
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,150
to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas.

1512
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,590
-And that you run it.
-Well, who better than me?

1513
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:41,520
The marked man.

1514
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:43,790
Paul, if you want to work here,
I need three things.

1515
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:45,490
One, stop boozing.

1516
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,400
Two, stop doing
whatever else it is you're doing.

1517
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:50,660
And three, cut this nonsense out.

1518
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:54,270
Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time

1519
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:57,440
you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag,

1520
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,610
I'll more than happily...

1521
01:32:02,610 --> 01:32:04,510
More than happily
decamp for greener pastures.

1522
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:08,080
Paul, I mean it!

1523
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:19,890
-Paul?
-Yep.

1524
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,200
-What was that?
-An editorial tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte.

1525
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:26,230
-Wanna grab a drink?
-It's 10:00 in the morning.

1526
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,440
Late breakfast?

1527
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:31,510
-Early lunch, or...
-Paul.

1528
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:35,880
Are you okay?

1529
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,180
No.

1530
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,650
Thank you for asking.

1531
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:46,690
Shorty! Let's go out for one.

1532
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,060
Paul, where are you going?

1533
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:52,990
So, you moved off my brother-in-law?

1534
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:55,640
We couldn't get a warrant.

1535
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:59,170
Last year we arranged for Leigh
to get help from a social worker.

1536
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,540
He only went twice.

1537
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,440
We saw him recently for
the first time in nine months.

1538
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:07,510
My mother-in-law brought him by
to see the new baby.

1539
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,740
After he left,
I went to see that social worker.

1540
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,150
He couldn't talk about a former patient,
so I just asked him straight out

1541
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:17,590
if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people.

1542
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:21,230
-Because of patient confidentiality...
-The man said yes.

1543
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,930
Why hadn't you seen him
in nine months?

1544
01:33:25,290 --> 01:33:27,190
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1545
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,200
-Santa Rosa? Where is he living?
-In his trailer.

1546
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,630
-In Santa Rosa?
-Sonoma County.

1547
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:34,770
We wouldn't have to go
through the Vallejo DA.

1548
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:36,770
It's been 11 months
since you talked to this guy,

1549
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:38,410
and now you wanna search his trailer?

1550
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:40,280
If we find something, great.

1551
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,180
If not, we get his prints and
handwriting samples from both hands.

1552
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:45,960
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1553
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:49,150
What if I can get a second opinion?

1554
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:52,190
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes.
He trained me at this.

1555
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:54,290
Terry, all I need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous.

1556
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:59,260
Could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand?

1557
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:02,400
Between you and me?

1558
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,870
Because there are differing
schools of thought on this.

1559
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,940
Get the samples of his other hand.
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.

1560
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:13,470
That's the current thinking,
according to Terry Pascoe.

1561
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,140
Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist
who'd be willing to testify

1562
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,510
that someone who undergoes
a personality change like Zodiac

1563
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,580
would manifest it physically,
altering his handwriting.

1564
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,620
Which is why Sherwood couldn't
get a match from Allen's samples.

1565
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,320
We got Terry Pascoe,
this psychology guy,

1566
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,190
coupled with Cheney...

1567
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:32,760
It could be enough for a warrant.

1568
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,160
Get Cheney on the record.

1569
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:37,270
"And that he would call himself Zodiac. "

1570
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:39,470
Yes.

1571
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:41,370
And you're willing to swear
to this, under oath, in Superior Court?

1572
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,640
Without any hesitation.

1573
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,540
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney.
Thank you very much for your time.

1574
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:48,010
Thank you.

1575
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:49,910
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1576
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:51,810
Lives in Sunset Trailer Court
in Santa Rosa, California.

1577
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:55,450
Physical description.

1578
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:57,350
Allen is similar in height,
weight and build

1579
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,650
to a man seen at Lake Berryessa
on the day of the stabbings.

1580
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,860
I understand he doesn't look
much like the San Francisco composite.

1581
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:05,490
True. Height and weight are sketchy,

1582
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:07,390
but lumbering Caucasian
with a crew cut is right on.

1583
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,700
We never had much confidence
in the composite from the kids.

1584
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,100
The patrolman
who saw Zodiac that night

1585
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,870
said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1586
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:15,440
Military boot prints.

1587
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,340
Allen was in the Navy.
Wears a size 10-and-a-half.

1588
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:20,170
Same size as the prints
found at Berryessa.

1589
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:22,610
What about gun?

1590
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:24,510
Cheney says Allen owns several
firearms. We'll list them in the warrant.

1591
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,180
-And the ciphers.
-Could be code training in the Navy,

1592
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:32,050
and people have seen Allen
with ciphers in the past.

1593
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,090
Really? Who?

1594
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:35,990
That would be his sister-in-law
and a man named Phil Tucker

1595
01:35:36,990 --> 01:35:38,890
that he worked with
at a public pool in Vallejo.

1596
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,300
And Phil Tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with Allen

1597
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,870
about how to attach a flashlight
to the barrel of a gun.

1598
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:47,670
That gives us two sources
on the ciphers and two on the flashlight.

1599
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,010
What about his threats on children?

1600
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:53,070
Suspect worked for elementary schools

1601
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,980
and was fired for molestation
in March, April '68.

1602
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:58,280
-Could give him motive.
-At the very least, it's home turf.

1603
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,020
He'd have knowledge of bus routes,

1604
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,180
which the two major threats
centered around.

1605
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:05,720
What about the bomb?

1606
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,860
Allen works as a chemist.

1607
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:10,560
Take him through the geography.

1608
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,130
Vallejo murders.

1609
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:14,030
Allen lives in Vallejo
with his mother in her basement.

1610
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:17,630
Berryessa murder. On the day
that the two kids were stabbed

1611
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,900
his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck

1612
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:23,670
which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken.

1613
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:26,670
Does he have any alibis?

1614
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:28,610
He claimed he did, but he's been unable
to produce the names

1615
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,380
of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of Berryessa.

1616
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:34,750
The bottom line is that Allen
can't alibi up on anything.

1617
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,220
Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.

1618
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,120
-You want to tell me about the name?
-What name?

1619
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,720
Zodiac.

1620
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,620
Allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol.

1621
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:46,190
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney

1622
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,770
a year and a half
before it appeared in any letter.

1623
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:53,830
-John...
-That's pretty good, guys.

1624
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:57,470
-We think so, too.
-Let's take it to a judge.

1625
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,030
Mr. Allen?

1626
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:20,930
This is the
Santa Rosa Police Department.

1627
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:23,970
We have a warrant
to search your residence.

1628
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,880
Hello?

1629
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:47,130
I'll check with the neighbors.

1630
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:49,520
Close the door.

1631
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:52,600
Close the door,
there's rodents running around.

1632
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:06,840
Neighbor said he tore out of here
about a half-hour ago.

1633
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:11,890
-You think somebody tipped him?
-We're not leaving till he comes back.

1634
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,620
I'll check the back.

1635
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,300
Jesus.

1636
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,200
-What?
-Squirrels.

1637
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:39,050
Piece of work, this guy.

1638
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:47,850
Not one, but two blue windbreakers.

1639
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:52,430
-Like the Stine scene?
-We'll have those checked for blood.

1640
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:55,830
And a pair of black gloves.

1641
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,060
Men's seven,
just like the ones we found in the cab.

1642
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:02,430
Well, he's got the same size shoes
and gloves as Z.

1643
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:05,070
Probably just a coincidence.

1644
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:09,580
Dave, I got a gun.
Check that. Two guns.

1645
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:12,640
They're both. 22s.
One automatic, one revolver.

1646
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,680
Well, that's interesting.

1647
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,580
Because he happens to have
an M-1 rifle here in the closet.

1648
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:21,550
For little darlings bouncing off buses.

1649
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:24,920
Someone's here.

1650
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:33,940
Hello, Arthur. Remember us?

1651
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:57,650
No.

1652
01:39:57,650 --> 01:39:58,820
On the handwriting?

1653
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:00,720
Ballistics, no match.
Prints, no match. Writing, no match.

1654
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,260
On both hands, right?

1655
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,160
Because we got handwriting
from both his hands.

1656
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,600
And neither hand matches.

1657
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,330
Forget Sherwood.
Let's get another opinion.

1658
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:11,370
Fellas, he's not your guy.

1659
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,940
Damn it.

1660
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:28,320
Hey.

1661
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:30,960
What do you want? Time off?

1662
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,020
A hug?

1663
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,060
Do you know what
the worst part of this is?

1664
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:39,090
I can't tell if I wanted it
to be Allen so bad

1665
01:40:39,190 --> 01:40:41,090
because I actually thought it was him,
or I just want all this to be over.

1666
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,460
It's because you thought it was him.

1667
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:46,470
And I did, too.

1668
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:50,410
You know what? Take some time off.

1669
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:52,310
Spend some time with your wife
and the kids.

1670
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:56,350
Go to Candlestick. See a movie.

1671
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:59,550
"To the city of San Francisco,
I will enjoy killing one person every day

1672
01:41:03,050 --> 01:41:05,500
"until you pay me $100,000.

1673
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:09,200
"If you agree, say so tomorrow morning

1674
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:11,890
"in the personal column

01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:14,930

"If I do not hear from you,

"it will be my next pleasure

1678
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:25,110
"... Scorpio. "

1679
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,610
Who's out of their minds?

1680
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:30,510
I've got to get out of here.

1681
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:32,680
Where the hell does he expect me
to find $100,000?

1682
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:36,050
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

1683
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:40,960
The city of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit a crime.

1684
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:05,810
The killer gets shot in the chest.

1685
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,790
That's how it ends.

1686
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:10,920
Do I know you?

1687
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,820
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery.

1688
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:15,460
Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.

1689
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:17,360
Dave! That Harry Callahan
did a hell of a job with your case.

1690
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,700
Yeah. No need for due process, right?

1691
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,900
-What do you do at the Chronicle?
-I'm a cartoonist.

1692
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:28,500
That's nice.

1693
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,450
You're gonna catch him.

1694
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:34,920
Pal, they're already
making movies about it.

1695
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:44,550
We today have concluded
an agreement

1696
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:47,590
to end the war and bring peace
with honor in Vietnam.

1697
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:51,290
...Charles Manson for
the Tate-La Bianca mass murders...

1698
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,460
Guilty in the Chowchilla
kidnapping case.

1699
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:56,830
In the murder trial of one...

1700
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:59,200
Chairman Mao died today...

1701
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:01,100
...an absolute pardon
unto Richard Nixon...

1702
01:43:01,670 --> 01:43:04,670
-No, I'm not a crook...
-... Generation of hostility...

1703
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,740
...has now led to the death
of 50,000 Americans

1704
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:11,810
and several
hundred thousand Vietnamese...

1705
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:14,850
Patricia Hearst is kidnapped
by the Symbionese Liberation Army...

1706
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:19,130
All of us should stand up together
and say, "No more. "

1707
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:22,590
Your Declaration of Independence
spreads that...

1708
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:25,330
Americans admire
the United Kingdom...

1709
01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:28,030
Mr. Hoffa has disappeared.

1710
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:31,800
If we despise our own government...

1711
01:43:32,730 --> 01:43:34,630
...that the police have captured a man

1712
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:37,040
whom they believe
to be the "Son of Sam... "

1713
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:54,150
Hi. We haven't met.

1714
01:43:54,490 --> 01:43:56,390
I'm Robert Graysmith.

1715
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,460
I'm Duffy Jennings.

1716
01:43:58,530 --> 01:44:00,430
-Nice to meet you.
-Good to meet you, man.

1717
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:02,930
You got a great desk.

1718
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:04,830
Guy who used to work here
was a great reporter.

1719
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:06,430
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he was.

1720
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,340
I mean, it's a honor
to leave the Chronicle

1721
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,900
and go work for the Sacramento Bee.

1722
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:14,110
Dare to dream, right, Robert?

1723
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,650
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

1724
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,620
I'm just right down there
at the Art department

1725
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:25,420
-if you need anything, Duffy.
-Yeah.

1726
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,820
-You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
-It's your turn.

1727
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:33,590
You could just drop me off at my place
and take the car.

1728
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,940
You should keep the car.

1729
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:39,300
Yeah?

1730
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:41,410
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

1731
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:45,240
Why? What's up?

1732
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:47,970
I'm done.

1733
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,820
I put in for a transfer.

1734
01:44:56,820 --> 01:44:58,490
Where?

1735
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:00,390
Looking at Fraud.

1736
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,430
I can't be on call anymore.

1737
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,500
I wanna see these kids grow up.

1738
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:12,910
Hey, good for you, Bill.

1739
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:17,310
-You'll be okay.
-Yeah. I'll be fine.

1740
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:21,240
Hey,

1741
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:24,920
I'm not leaving you
holding the bag on anything, am I?

1742
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:28,480
No.

1743
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,720
Okay.

1744
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,620
Hey, you know what?

1745
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:38,300
Maybe you'll have a chance
to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.

1746
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,160
Yeah.

1747
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:14,230
I'm not Paul Avery.

1748
01:46:16,930 --> 01:46:18,830
The boys need to be tucked in, please,
and the baby needs changing.

1749
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:22,310
-I'll flip you for it.
-You wish.

1750
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:28,450
Nobody has more Zodiac crap
than you do.

1751
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:15,360
-Are you kidding me?
-Hi, Paul.

1752
01:47:17,090 --> 01:47:18,990
Permission to come aboard.
It's right there.

1753
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:21,760
Anyway, you got shoes on.
This is perfect right here.

1754
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:24,380
-That's the one.
-Okay.

1755
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:27,970
-See that? Mesmerizing.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1756
01:47:28,970 --> 01:47:31,640
My own kids
would kill me for one of those.

1757
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,380
-How are you?
-Fantastic.

1758
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:37,710
I mean, admittedly,

1759
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:39,950
the Bee ain't exactly
the Chron, but fuck it, right?

1760
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,380
Do you want a drink?
I don't have anything blue, but I got...

1761
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:45,390
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.

1762
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:49,160
It's no bother at all.
Nobody comes by from the old days.

1763
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,330
Cheers.

1764
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:53,500
To your health and mine.

1765
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,300
Mostly mine.

1766
01:48:01,970 --> 01:48:03,870
So,

1767
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:07,570
what's new?

1768
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,940
-I've been thinking.
-Yeah.

1769
01:48:11,050 --> 01:48:12,280
Somebody should write a book.

1770
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,180
Somebody should write a fucking book,
that's for sure.

1771
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,490
-About what?
-About Zodiac.

1772
01:48:19,090 --> 01:48:20,590
It's not new.

1773
01:48:20,590 --> 01:48:22,490
I've been thinking that
if you put all the information together,

1774
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:26,990
maybe you could jog something loose.

1775
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,900
And then I was thinking that
nobody knows the case better than you.

1776
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,730
Yeah. That's true.

1777
01:48:30,730 --> 01:48:32,630
You know all the players,
and you have all the files.

1778
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,470
Lost them.

1779
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:36,640
You lost them?

1780
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:39,950
Or I tossed them. I don't know.
I moved onto a boat.

1781
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:42,240
You know that we work
in the daily business, right?

1782
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:43,880
As in, today.

1783
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:46,690
What do you think
we were doing back then?

1784
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:49,550
Do you know that more people die
in the East Bay commute

1785
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:51,790
every three months
than that idiot ever killed?

1786
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:53,550
He offed a few citizens,

1787
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,930
he wrote a few letters,
and he faded into a footnote.

1788
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,300
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly

1789
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:09,500
waiting for you to drop by
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1790
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:13,710
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1791
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,790
You're wrong. It was important.

1792
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:21,550
Then, what did you ever do about it?

1793
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:24,280
If it was so fucking important,
what did you ever do?

1794
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:26,520
You hovered over my desk,
you stole from wastebaskets.

1795
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,460
Am I being unkind?

1796
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:33,670
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You went to the library.

1797
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:38,430
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1798
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,420
-Hey, hi.
-Hi.

1799
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:05,140
-Where you been?
-The library.

1800
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:38,630
Thank you!

1801
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:57,190
-Inspector Toschi?
-Yeah? One moment, please.

1802
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:03,420
-Hi.
-Hi.

1803
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,060
We met at the movies once.

1804
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:07,990
It must have been magical.

1805
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:09,820
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle.

1806
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:12,630
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1807
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:16,100
Sure, why not?

1808
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:18,000
So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's?

1809
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:21,010
He's actually the reason I'm here.

1810
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:25,120
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1811
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:27,440
Well, I appreciate the interest,
but we don't discuss open cases.

1812
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,780
Oh, well, what's going on with it,
day to day?

1813
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:33,280
We're actively pursuing all leads.

1814
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:35,890
And you're the only one on it, right?

1815
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:38,920
Mr. Graysmith,

1816
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:41,520
Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1817
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:43,590
You know how many murders
we've had in San Francisco since then?

1818
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,130
-No.
-Over 200.

1819
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:48,030
That's a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need our help.

1820
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:51,270
So, nobody cares.

1821
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:53,750
Excuse me? I care.

1822
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,710
Okay. Can I show you something?

1823
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:03,480
I've been doing research
on the first cipher.

1824
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:06,710
Everything an amateur
would need to create it

1825
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,620
can be found in these books.

1826
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:11,680
Now, I started thinking
that if you can track these books,

1827
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:15,670
then maybe you can track the man.

1828
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:18,060
So, I remember you thought
that Zodiac was military,

1829
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:20,990
so I went to every base library
and I got a list of every person

1830
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:26,830
who's ever checked out these books
and that's when I found this.

1831
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:34,080
-Missing.
-It means they were stolen.

1832
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:36,740
So, almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the Presidio Library?

1833
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:41,150
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1834
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,820
Somebody didn't want a record
of ever having checked out these books.

1835
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:50,360
Who are you again?

1836
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:54,090
I just wanna help.

1837
01:52:57,030 --> 01:52:58,930
I can't allow you to help.

1838
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:01,270
I can't discuss the case with you.

1839
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:03,170
I can't give you information,
and I certainly couldn't tell you

1840
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:06,050
to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1841
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:08,470
N-A-R-L-O-W.

1842
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:19,850
I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith,
but we don't cooperate with writers.

1843
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:25,530
Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1844
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:28,330
-And Dave Toschi sent you?
-Yes.

1845
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:30,630
-Why?
-Maybe he...

1846
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,640
Maybe he thought
that I could do some good.

1847
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:38,540
-What are you, some kind of boy scout?
-Eagle Scout, actually, first class.

1848
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:42,680
Well, if you wanna do this,
don't let me stop you.

1849
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:46,050
Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.

1850
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,880
I understand what you're trying to do.

1851
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:51,380
But this is an open police investigation.

1852
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:53,690
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1853
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:55,890
And he said
that you might be able to help.

1854
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:00,300
I mean, the case is dead.
Zodiac's long gone.

1855
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,400
He's yesterday's news, right?

1856
01:54:04,430 --> 01:54:06,330
That's what they say.

1857
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:09,040
So, what's the harm?

1858
01:54:09,070 --> 01:54:10,970
No pens, no paper.

1859
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:12,970
Anything that you see that's relevant,
you got to remember in your head.

1860
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,740
Okay.

1861
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:18,550
Okay, here we go.

1862
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:20,450
-Which one?
-All of them.

1863
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:22,620
And there's more in the next room.
They're all marked with these numbers.

1864
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,820
243-146.

1865
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:26,720
You don't smoke, do you?

1866
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:28,890
Once. In high school.

1867
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:34,160
What's this?

1868
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,460
Thank you.

1869
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:06,160
Man, you really creeped us out.

1870
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,040
"Nine millimeter.

1871
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:18,140
"Said nothing and began firing. "

1872
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,320
"Most Dangerous Game.

1873
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,220
"Do not eliminate this suspect
because of handwriting.

1874
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:33,320
"Not because of handwriting.

1875
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:35,760
"Darlene's sister, Linda.

1876
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,630
"It was all just deep breathing. George.

1877
01:55:39,230 --> 01:55:42,040
"It was a strange man. George.
Strange man. "

1878
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,860
Thank you so much.

1879
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,540
Oh, briefcase. Oh, thanks.

1880
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:53,110
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey, Bawart.

1881
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,740
-Who's that?
-That's Graysmith.

1882
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:59,090
Some cartoonist.
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1883
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:02,650
Well, good for him.

1884
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:34,410
-Thank you for meeting me, Inspector.
-No. We're not meeting, Robert.

1885
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,520
We're just two guys
who happen to be sitting

1886
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:37,780
on the same bench at the same time.

1887
01:56:37,790 --> 01:56:39,690
I've got five minutes.
I've got to get back to the Hall.

1888
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:42,190
Okay. As far as you know,
did anyone ever get in touch

1889
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:44,930
with Mike Mageau
during your investigation

1890
01:56:44,930 --> 01:56:46,830
-and show him suspect photos?
-Why?

1891
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,400
Well, he's the only surviving victim
who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.

1892
01:56:50,030 --> 01:56:51,470
No, I mean, why are you asking me?

1893
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:53,370
Mageau and Darlene,
that's Vallejo's case.

1894
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:55,330
Paul Stine is mine.
You've got four minutes now.

1895
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:58,200
Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1896
01:56:58,710 --> 01:57:00,570
Now, I know Mulanax says
that they already found this guy,

1897
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:01,680
a George Waters?

1898
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:03,580
But he also said
that she had a lot of admirers

1899
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:05,310
who would come to
the restaurant where she worked.

1900
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:07,010
-She was popular.
-Very.

1901
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:08,750
Yeah. So...

1902
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:10,650
She and her husband,
they move into their new house,

1903
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:12,520
and one night they throw
this painting party.

1904
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:13,720
And what's a painting party?

1905
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,620
It's a party where people come
and help you paint.

1906
01:57:15,790 --> 01:57:16,990
Sounds like a terrible party.

1907
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:18,890
Well, supposedly,
somebody who's not Waters shows up.

1908
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:22,760
And Darlene is terrified of him.

1909
01:57:22,830 --> 01:57:24,660
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1910
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:26,570
And if Zodiac knew Darlene,
then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1911
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:31,140
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1912
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:32,870
So if you wanna connect
Darlene to Zodiac,

1913
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:34,370
you're gonna have to find another way.

1914
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,810
I have another way.

1915
01:57:35,810 --> 01:57:37,510
Phone calls the night
of Darlene's murder.

1916
01:57:37,510 --> 01:57:39,410
-Yeah, Zodiac called the police.
-No, Dave, there were four other calls.

1917
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,620
There were two to Darlene's house,
one to Darlene's brother-in-law,

1918
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:45,020
and one to Darlene's father-in-law.
Just heavy breathing.

1919
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:47,420
They started around 1:30 a. m.,

1920
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,360
and this was before anyone in the family
knew that Darlene had been shot.

1921
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:53,130
-This was in the Vallejo files?
-Yeah.

1922
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:54,560
God damn it.

1923
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,400
It's got to be more
than just a coincidence, right?

1924
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:58,300
I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly
prank phone call a victim's entire family

1925
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:01,270
90 minutes after they were shot.

1926
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,400
So, either Zodiac shoots
a random couple,

1927
01:58:03,670 --> 01:58:05,270
then he recognizes Darlene...

1928
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:07,170
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1929
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:10,620
Either way,
Zodiac had to have known Darlene.

1930
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,380
That's good, Robert.

1931
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,620
So, I can't find Mageau,
so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.

1932
01:58:18,020 --> 01:58:19,920
And maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is.

1933
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:22,870
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1934
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:28,360
You know,

1935
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,260
it's interesting that you should mention
Zodiac calling people at home.

1936
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:33,330
He did that in San Francisco once.

1937
01:58:33,330 --> 01:58:34,940
What? Who did he call?

1938
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:38,040
I can't tell you.
That's privileged information.

1939
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:40,850
But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1940
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,380
Melvin Belli.

1941
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:47,850
How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1942
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,220
-He should be along soon.
-Oh, that's all right.

1943
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:53,320
I've really...
I've only been waiting two hours, so...

1944
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:55,790
He's usually not this late.

1945
01:58:55,820 --> 01:58:58,630
Oh, cookies. Thank you.
These look great.

1946
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:01,330
-You are here on business?
-I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1947
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:05,330
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1948
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:08,370
-You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?
-No, to the Zodiac when he called.

1949
01:59:11,170 --> 01:59:13,070
He said he had to kill
because it was his birthday.

1950
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:16,480
He said it... Wait.
He said it was his birthday?

1951
01:59:17,910 --> 01:59:20,480
Yes. You want something to drink?

1952
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:25,520
-When was this?
-Oh, so many years ago.

1953
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:29,090
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas.

1954
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:31,190
Gone for a week.

1955
01:59:31,190 --> 01:59:33,090
The Zodiac called,
wanting to talk to him.

1956
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:35,430
I said, "He is not here. "

1957
01:59:35,430 --> 01:59:37,330
He said, "I have to kill.
Today is my birthday. "

1958
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:40,330
And then he hangs up.

1959
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:42,070
Then the letter arrived.

1960
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:43,970
So, the call came
before the letter of December 20th.

1961
01:59:46,210 --> 01:59:48,110
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1962
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:50,140
He came back on Christmas.
Not a good day to work.

1963
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,060
So, he left on the 18th.

1964
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:56,780
Is that helpful?

1965
01:59:56,780 --> 01:59:58,320
She said it was his birthday.

1966
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,220
Well, you'd have to confirm that,
now wouldn't you?

1967
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:03,720
How?

1968
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:05,620
Well, I never spoke to her,
but maybe my partner did.

1969
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:08,830
-How do I get a hold of him?
-You don't. Bill wanted out of this.

1970
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:11,760
As far as I'm concerned,
he should stay out.

1971
02:00:12,230 --> 02:00:13,600
How do I confirm it?

1972
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:15,500
Well, if my partner
did talk to someone from Justice,

1973
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:17,900
then they would've had
to put that in a report.

1974
02:00:17,910 --> 02:00:19,810
That's standard procedure.

1975
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:22,210
-Okay.
-Mel Nicolai.

1976
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,380
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1977
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:26,410
I just need to confirm a date.

1978
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:28,220
-Mr. Graysmith...
-I've narrowed it down

1979
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:30,120
between the 18th and the 20th
of December, and I just need...

1980
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:32,490
Okay, I'll play.
Let's say this phone call did take place.

1981
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:35,520
Let's say it really was Zodiac.

1982
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:37,420
Why would he volunteer
the day he was born?

1983
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:40,290
Plus, nobody died on December 18th,

1984
02:00:40,630 --> 02:00:42,530
just like nobody died over the weekend
when he was gonna kill a dozen people,

1985
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:45,430
or when he was gonna
shoot school kids or blow up buses.

1986
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:47,430
He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.

1987
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,200
What if he made a mistake?

1988
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,100
What if he wasn't lying?
What if it was him on the phone?

1989
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:53,240
He didn't expect to pick it up,
a nice person to pick up.

1990
02:00:53,810 --> 02:00:55,240
What if? What if? What if?

1991
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:57,140
Look, off the record,
Bill Armstrong checked this out.

1992
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:00,580
We took this very seriously.

1993
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:03,280
None of the suspects had the
same birthday as this phantom caller.

1994
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:06,930
Bill Armstrong.

1995
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:14,360
Can I give you a piece of advice?

1996
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:16,200
You're looking in the wrong place.

1997
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:18,100
Handwriting, fingerprints,
that's what this whole thing's about.

1998
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:21,230
Stick to the evidence.

1999
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:23,640
Hi.

2000
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:34,250
-Hey. How was your day?
-Long.

2001
02:01:39,650 --> 02:01:41,150
Who's Sherwood Morrill?

2002
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:43,060
He's a handwriting expert
in Sacramento.

2003
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:45,230
He called.

2004
02:01:45,230 --> 02:01:47,130
He said he can meet you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

2005
02:01:47,430 --> 02:01:48,800
Oh, great.

2006
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,670
-So you're taking off work?
-Just an hour.

2007
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:55,570
Sacramento's two hours away.

2008
02:01:56,670 --> 02:01:58,570
-Really?
-Yes.

2009
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,670
What's this?

2010
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:02,580
Oh, that's that article.

2011
02:02:03,410 --> 02:02:05,310
"Robert Graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the Zodiac. "

2012
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:08,280
Yeah.

2013
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:10,180
It talks all about you
researching Zodiac.

2014
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,520
Well, that's what the article's about.

2015
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,420
I'm not so sure that's something
we want people to know about.

2016
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:16,220
Why? Are you embarrassed?

2017
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:19,430
Robert, what's the one thing
we know about Zodiac?

2018
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:21,360
He reads the Chronicle.

2019
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:23,900
Yeah, but he's never
gonna read Herb Caen.

2020
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:30,440
-Hello.
-Mr. Graysmith?

2021
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:32,840
The Robert Graysmith
mentioned in the paper today?

2022
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:36,750
-Yeah?
-I can tell you who the Zodiac is.

2023
02:02:40,510 --> 02:02:41,650
Who is this?

2024
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:43,550
The Zodiac Killer
is obsessed with movies.

2025
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:45,780
He recorded his murders on film.

2026
02:02:46,690 --> 02:02:48,590
I tried to tell the police,
but they wouldn't follow through on it.

2027
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:52,060
There's a man you need to find.
His name is Bob Vaughn.

2028
02:02:53,190 --> 02:02:55,090
-Pen, pen.
-V-A-U-G-H-N.

2029
02:02:55,830 --> 02:02:57,730
He's a friend of the Zodiac's.

2030
02:02:58,070 --> 02:02:59,970
Mr. Vaughn does not know
his friend is a killer,

2031
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:02,200
and he is storing
some film canisters for him.

2032
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,800
In these canisters is the evidence.

2033
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:06,710
Okay, yeah, friend? Who is this friend?

2034
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:10,010
You have quite enough to get started.

2035
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:11,850
Oh, please.

2036
02:03:11,850 --> 02:03:15,190
The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.

2037
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:20,920
Your toast is burning.

2038
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:26,930
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.

2039
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:29,600
Once we lock that into our brains,

2040
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,900
our handwriting may change
over the years,

2041
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,300
but the moves themselves
remain unaltered.

2042
02:03:35,170 --> 02:03:37,070
-Understand?
-Yes.

2043
02:03:38,270 --> 02:03:40,250
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

2044
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:43,790
Specifically with his "K."

2045
02:03:44,980 --> 02:03:46,880
In his first letters,
he executed the "K" with two strokes.

2046
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:49,550
Later letters, he did them with three.

2047
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:51,450
-Why?
-We don't know.

2048
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,820
Excuse me, I've got to spray this.

2049
02:03:53,950 --> 02:03:55,850
How many suspects
were cleared through handwriting?

2050
02:03:57,190 --> 02:03:58,730
All of them.

2051
02:03:58,730 --> 02:04:00,630
Also the print in the cab.
No match was ever found.

2052
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:04,200
Is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test?

2053
02:04:06,430 --> 02:04:07,530
No.

2054
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:10,740
Whoever the Zodiac is,
he's not someone I cleared.

2055
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,540
About a month ago, a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught.

2056
02:04:15,210 --> 02:04:17,310
His name was Wallace Penny.

2057
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:20,110
He said he knew who the Zodiac was.

2058
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:22,480
Gave me a name.

2059
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:24,620
Rick. Rick somebody.

2060
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:26,920
-Rick Marshall?
-Yeah.

2061
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,420
I think that the man
who you talked to called me, too.

2062
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:32,060
After he left, then I checked my files.

2063
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:34,760
I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

2064
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,740
Hello?

2065
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:50,040
Hello? Who is this?

2066
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:01,970
It's the wrong number.

2067
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:11,070
Does the name Rick Marshall
mean anything to you?

2068
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:13,970
What are you after?

2069
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:15,370
What do you got?

2070
02:05:15,370 --> 02:05:19,650
Hypothetically, you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case.

2071
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:22,340
This is off the record.

2072
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:24,240
Couple years back,
I was trying to get Marshall's prints.

2073
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:26,610
I handed him a photo.

2074
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:28,510
He looks at it. He's about to give it back
and he stops and he says,

2075
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:30,980
"My goodness,
I got fingerprints all over this. "

2076
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:33,520
And he wipes them off.

2077
02:05:34,190 --> 02:05:35,990
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

2078
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:37,890
Because when they finally
did run his prints,

2079
02:05:38,730 --> 02:05:40,630
they cleared him
against the one in Stine's cab.

2080
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:43,000
-So, then, it's not him.
-Maybe yes, maybe no.

2081
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:45,200
No. What do you mean?

2082
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:47,330
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

2083
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,800
If he had the foresight
to bring gloves with him,

2084
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:51,940
how the hell's he gonna
accidentally leave a print behind?

2085
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:54,040
But it was in the victim's blood.

2086
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:55,680
Could have been one of the bystanders,

2087
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:57,580
or a cop just reaches out,
boom, false print.

2088
02:05:58,150 --> 02:06:00,050
Yeah, but that print
disqualified 2,500 suspects.

2089
02:06:00,610 --> 02:06:02,020
Which is why we also used handwriting.

2090
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:03,420
But not for Rick Marshall.

2091
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:05,320
SFPD saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house.

2092
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:08,490
Decided it looked nothing
like the Z letters, so they just moved on.

2093
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:12,420
How do they know
that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

2094
02:06:12,860 --> 02:06:14,760
My thoughts exactly.

2095
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:17,030
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.
He received code training.

2096
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:20,800
He was also a projectionist
at a silent film theater.

2097
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,340
Well, then, how do I get copies
of Rick Marshall's handwriting?

2098
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:25,540
Three ways.
One, get a warrant, which you can't.

2099
02:06:27,610 --> 02:06:29,510
Two, get him to volunteer,
which he won't.

2100
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:31,740
Yeah, and three?

2101
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:33,580
Get creative.

2102
02:06:33,580 --> 02:06:35,480
I don't know what to tell you.
You get it, I'll analyze it.

2103
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:37,880
Beyond that, you're on your own.

2104
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:39,790
Okay, what about
the guy who came to see you,

2105
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:41,920
the one who called me?

2106
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,820
You mean Wallace Penny?

2107
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:46,630
Yeah. Did he leave a number?

2108
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:57,840
-Hello?
-Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

2109
02:06:59,310 --> 02:07:00,410
How did you find me?

2110
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:02,310
I need a sample
of Rick Marshall's handwriting.

2111
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:03,940
I told you. Vaughn is who...

2112
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:05,840
Mr. Penny,
if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,

2113
02:07:07,010 --> 02:07:08,910
I need a sample of his handwriting
to confirm it.

2114
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:11,480
Can you help me or not?

2115
02:07:12,890 --> 02:07:14,790
Rick used to draw movie posters
for the theater Vaughn worked at.

2116
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:19,600
-I'll send one down.
-Thank you.

2117
02:07:29,570 --> 02:07:31,470
-I'll need to see more samples.
-Yeah, but is it...

2118
02:07:32,070 --> 02:07:33,970
It's as close as I've ever seen.
We have to tread lightly here.

2119
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:36,580
We're talking about
implicating this man as the Zodiac.

2120
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:39,110
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn
and I'll track down Linda.

2121
02:07:40,310 --> 02:07:42,210
I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.

2122
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:44,280
I've been to the DMV,
and I talked to her parents,

2123
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:47,090
but still, nobody knows
where to find her.

2124
02:07:48,390 --> 02:07:50,290
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing
matches the exemplar.

2125
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,860
In a way, though, it's the part that
doesn't match that scares me the most.

2126
02:07:56,100 --> 02:07:58,000
-What do you mean?
-Well, on the poster,

2127
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:00,500
the one letter that absolutely,
positively does not match

2128
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:03,700
is the letter "K."

2129
02:08:05,370 --> 02:08:07,270
You wouldn't happen to have any
animal crackers in there, would you?

2130
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:12,950
Unit Five.
Toschi needs to call in on a landline.

2131
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:26,830
-Dispatch.
-Hey. Dave Toschi.

2132
02:08:27,390 --> 02:08:29,290
I'll connect you.

2133
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:31,430
-Dave?
-Yeah. What's up?

2134
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:33,330
Jennings here from the Chronicle.

2135
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:35,870
It came in this morning
and you need to see it right now.

2136
02:08:35,870 --> 02:08:37,040
See what?

2137
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:38,940
The new Zodiac letter.
And it mentions you.

2138
02:08:39,870 --> 02:08:41,770
Okay, okay.

2139
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:45,140
Shit. All right, come on.

2140
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:47,510
Hall of Justice!

2141
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:50,750
Now! Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

2142
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:58,960
Dave!

2143
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:01,240
Do you have it with you?

2144
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:06,370
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I'm back with you.

2145
02:09:06,770 --> 02:09:08,670
"Tell Herb Caen I am here,
I have always been here.

2146
02:09:09,940 --> 02:09:11,840
"That city pig Toschi is good,
but I am smarter and better.

2147
02:09:13,070 --> 02:09:14,970
"He will get tired, then leave me alone.

2148
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:17,940
"I'm waiting for a good movie about me.
Who will play me?

2149
02:09:19,450 --> 02:09:21,350
"I'm now in control of all things. "

2150
02:09:21,650 --> 02:09:24,360
These guys are from Internal Affairs.

2151
02:09:26,150 --> 02:09:27,850
We need to talk.

2152
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:29,720
Good evening. Our top story tonight,

2153
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:31,620
the San Francisco Police Department
has confirmed

2154
02:09:32,330 --> 02:09:34,230
that the man
who calls himself the Zodiac

2155
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:36,830
and terrorized the Bay Area
has broken his silence of 51 months.

2156
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:41,300
In a letter claiming,
"I am back with you,"

2157
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:44,040
the Zodiac makes no overt threats
against the citizenry,

2158
02:09:45,870 --> 02:09:47,770
and muses that his life and times
would make the best movie script yet.

2159
02:09:48,810 --> 02:09:50,410
These carrots are perfect.

2160
02:09:50,410 --> 02:09:51,880
The terse 66 word message
also manages...

2161
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,010
Just go.

2162
02:09:53,010 --> 02:09:54,910
...to mention San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Herb Caen

2163
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,980
and the Department's own
David Toschi by name.

2164
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:00,820
-May I be excused?
-Are they targets?

2165
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:01,920
Fine, but you have to come back

2166
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,660
and finish at least half
of what's on that plate.

2167
02:10:03,660 --> 02:10:04,860
More team coverage
on the cipher slayer's return...

2168
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:05,960
-Okay?
-Okay.

2169
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:07,860
...begins as Alan Freeman has more.

2170
02:10:08,530 --> 02:10:09,760
Thank you, Eric.

2171
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:11,660
San Francisco Chronicle columnist
Armistead Maupin says

2172
02:10:12,330 --> 02:10:14,230
that he thinks not only
is this new letter a forgery,

2173
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,940
but it was written by the very man

2174
02:10:17,070 --> 02:10:18,970
trusted to hunt down this killer,
David Toschi.

2175
02:10:20,910 --> 02:10:22,810
Maupin, a very well-respected author,
has gone on record saying

2176
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:26,580
that he believes Toschi wrote the letter
to drum up publicity for himself.

2177
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:31,280
Maupin used David
as a character in his column.

2178
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:34,450
David got a kick out of it

2179
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:36,460
and so he wrote
a couple of anonymous letters

2180
02:10:36,660 --> 02:10:38,560
asking for the character
to be brought back.

2181
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:40,560
It was like
writing fan mail to himself. That's all.

2182
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:43,660
But David did not write that letter.

2183
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:45,960
No, I'm sure that he didn't.
And I'm sure that this will all blow over.

2184
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:48,730
Blow over?

2185
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:50,640
They kicked him out of Homicide.

2186
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:52,940
They made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal.

2187
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:56,790
-May I talk to him?
-No.

2188
02:10:57,810 --> 02:10:59,080
Okay, can you just ask him

2189
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:00,980
if he ever investigated
a man named Rick Marshall?

2190
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:03,420
Is that all you can think about?

2191
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:06,860
Mr. Graysmith,
Maupin works at your paper. We trust...

2192
02:11:12,630 --> 02:11:14,090
This girl, she wants music lessons?

2193
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:15,990
Dave! Dave!

2194
02:11:18,070 --> 02:11:19,970
I'll catch up to you.

2195
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:22,270
You stop calling my house.
Do you understand me?

2196
02:11:22,670 --> 02:11:24,470
I just need your help to find Linda.

2197
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:26,540
-Jesus.
-Look, two seconds.

2198
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:30,380
Look, we've been
running handwriting samples.

2199
02:11:30,980 --> 02:11:32,880
-Who's we?
-Sherwood and I.

2200
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:34,510
Sherwood?

2201
02:11:34,510 --> 02:11:36,410
Sherwood who was fired
from Questioned Documents?

2202
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,380
Sherwood who drinks
like Paul Avery now?

2203
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:40,290
-He retired.
-Is that what he told you?

2204
02:11:40,990 --> 02:11:45,200
-What, are you saying he's wrong?
-I'm saying stop calling my house.

2205
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:47,390
-We ran them on Rick Marshall.
-No, Robert.

2206
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:48,790
No, I know you don't think it's him.

2207
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,330
I mean, no, I am not having
this conversation.

2208
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:52,230
But I think that Marshall knew Darlene,
and I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,

2209
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:54,370
so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn.

2210
02:11:54,370 --> 02:11:55,700
-Robert. Robert, stop it!
-What?

2211
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:57,600
Okay, the Rick Marshalls
of this world will suck you dry.

2212
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:59,110
They're blind alleys.

2213
02:11:59,110 --> 02:12:01,010
But he said he wasn't gonna announce
his murders anymore, Dave.

2214
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:02,840
He was just gonna do them.

2215
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:04,740
Do you know what the chances
of us arresting someone are now?

2216
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:07,780
Too much time has gone by, okay?
Too much of the evidence is lost.

2217
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:11,980
People get old, Robert. They forget.

2218
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:15,250
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years.
Murder police for 12.

2219
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:19,490
-What do you do for a living?
-You know what I do for a living.

2220
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:21,890
-You're a cartoonist.
-So what are you saying?

2221
02:12:22,330 --> 02:12:25,500
I am saying Zodiac was my job.
It is not yours.

2222
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:30,600
-He's still out there, Dave.
-No, Robert. I am through with this.

2223
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:33,050
I am through with you.

2224
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:41,250
What about September 26, 1970?

2225
02:12:41,950 --> 02:12:45,520
-Okay, which one was that?
-The Lake Tahoe nurse goes missing.

2226
02:12:48,490 --> 02:12:49,920
One day before the vernal equinox.

2227
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,820
-Dad?
-Yeah. Mark that.

2228
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:53,830
Got another one. June 19th, 1971.

2229
02:12:55,660 --> 02:12:58,470
That's got to be
near the summer solstice.

2230
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:02,170
Oh, guys.

2231
02:13:02,170 --> 02:13:05,240
Don't tell Mom about
our special project, okay?

2232
02:13:05,740 --> 02:13:09,380
How come you and Mom
don't sleep in the same bed anymore?

2233
02:13:12,910 --> 02:13:13,980
Hello.

2234
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:15,880
Mr. Graysmith,
it's Ken Narlow from Napa.

2235
02:13:16,150 --> 02:13:18,050
Oh, Captain Narlow.
Thank you for calling me back.

2236
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:22,420
Yeah. How can I help?

2237
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:24,390
I called you because we've been
cross-referencing lunar cycles

2238
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:27,030
with the Zodiac's timeline.

2239
02:13:27,030 --> 02:13:28,930
More often than not, each cycle
since '69 corresponds with an attack

2240
02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:33,230
or with one of the letters,
or an unsolved homicide.

2241
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:36,200
-Who's working with you on this?
-Some colleagues.

2242
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:39,140
Dad?

2243
02:13:39,610 --> 02:13:41,510
-Ken, can you hold on one second?
-Dad?

2244
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:44,180
-What is it?
-What's this?

2245
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:49,920
In the decade since the Zodiac's
last cipher was received,

2246
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:53,080
every federal agency
has taken a crack at decoding it.

2247
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,660
But today,
where those agencies had failed,

2248
02:13:57,620 --> 02:13:59,520
a cartoonist has succeeded.

2249
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:01,990
How did you do it?

2250
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:07,440
Oh, just a lot of books from the library,
and I love puzzles, so I just...

2251
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,400
Yeah. The fucking library.

2252
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:14,980
I believe that you can accomplish
anything that you put your mind...

2253
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:20,650
That's a "J"? Okay. Honor Camp?

2254
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:24,150
Thank you so much.

2255
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:27,790
Hey, we found Linda.
She's in jail. Isn't that great?

2256
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:29,460
Why'd you do it?

2257
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:30,990
Because she'll be able to identify Rick...

2258
02:14:30,990 --> 02:14:33,730
-What are you talking about?
-You went on TV.

2259
02:14:34,290 --> 02:14:36,060
You put yourself out there
for him to see.

2260
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:37,660
Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.

2261
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:39,560
Then who's been calling our house
in the middle of the night

2262
02:14:39,770 --> 02:14:40,870
at least once a week?

2263
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:42,770
Nobody.

2264
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:45,810
What's it gonna take
for you to be done with this?

2265
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:47,710
I can't talk about this now.
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

2266
02:14:48,810 --> 02:14:50,710
Well, that's too bad,
because we're gonna talk about this.

2267
02:14:52,250 --> 02:14:54,150
And when is it gonna be finished?

2268
02:14:54,680 --> 02:14:56,580
When you catch him?
When you arrest him?

2269
02:14:56,620 --> 02:14:58,860
-Be serious.
-I am serious.

2270
02:15:00,650 --> 02:15:02,550
I need to know who he is.

2271
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:06,120
I need to stand there,

2272
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:11,410
I need to look him in the eye
and I need to know that it's him.

2273
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:15,170
Is that more important
than your family's safety?

2274
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:17,540
Of course not.

2275
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:21,520
Why? Why do you need to do this?

2276
02:15:23,380 --> 02:15:25,280
Why?

2277
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:28,350
Because nobody else will.

2278
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:30,420
That's not good enough.

2279
02:15:30,550 --> 02:15:32,460
Are you done? Can I go?

2280
02:15:47,730 --> 02:15:49,630
-Mr. Vaughn?
-Mr. Graysmith?

2281
02:15:49,870 --> 02:15:51,000
-Yes.
-Hi.

2282
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,440
You needed to speak to me?

2283
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:54,340
Yes. There's a coffee shop
right on the corner.

2284
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:56,840
-Why don't we just go to my home?
-Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

2285
02:15:58,110 --> 02:16:00,010
It's no trouble at all.

2286
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:02,010
-Where are you parked?
-Just right there.

2287
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:06,060
-You can follow me.
-Oh. Okay.

2288
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:26,640
Watch your step.

2289
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:29,710
Come in.

2290
02:16:30,910 --> 02:16:32,810
-Very nice house.
-Oh, thank you.

2291
02:16:34,110 --> 02:16:36,010
It's very rustic.

2292
02:16:36,050 --> 02:16:37,950
-Can I take your jacket?
-No, thank you, I'm fine.

2293
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:41,320
Okay. This way, please.

2294
02:16:44,090 --> 02:16:45,930
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

2295
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:47,830
-How about some tea?
-Oh, no, I'm all right.

2296
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,460
-You sure?
-Yes.

2297
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:52,800
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played

2298
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:56,630
while you were the organist there.

2299
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:58,640
The Most Dangerous Game?

2300
02:16:59,110 --> 02:17:01,010
Oh, it's a classic. RKO. 1932.

2301
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:04,440
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.

2302
02:17:07,350 --> 02:17:09,250
In '68, '69?

2303
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:12,380
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2304
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:14,890
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2305
02:17:17,090 --> 02:17:18,990
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2306
02:17:19,460 --> 02:17:21,360
-He was a projectionist there, right?
-For a time, yes.

2307
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:24,860
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

2308
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:29,000
Okay. Well, there is a connection

2309
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:31,570
between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

2310
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:34,440
You mean the symbol?

2311
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:37,310
Hold on.

2312
02:17:37,310 --> 02:17:41,450
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

2313
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:47,220
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown,

2314
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:49,920
but it always arrives with it.

2315
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:52,560
Right there.

2316
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:56,370
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.

2317
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:58,830
We got a tip

2318
02:17:58,830 --> 02:18:00,730
that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

2319
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:06,040
A tip about a mysterious film canister?

2320
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:08,770
Is it true?

2321
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:12,010
Yes.

2322
02:18:12,010 --> 02:18:13,910
-Did you open it?
-No.

2323
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:18,730
-May I see it?
-Rick took it back in 1972.

2324
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:22,320
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

2325
02:18:25,290 --> 02:18:27,060
That and the poster.

2326
02:18:27,060 --> 02:18:28,960
The poster?

2327
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:32,230
The poster that Rick drew.

2328
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:34,130
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

2329
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:37,440
-Rick didn't draw any posters.
-No, he drew this one.

2330
02:18:38,910 --> 02:18:42,380
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2331
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:45,640
That's my handwriting.

2332
02:18:53,850 --> 02:18:55,750
I won't take any more of your time.

2333
02:18:56,820 --> 02:18:58,720
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

2334
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:03,860
Oh, that's all right.

2335
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:07,310
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

2336
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:12,050
Not many people
have basements in California.

2337
02:19:14,710 --> 02:19:16,610
I do.

2338
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:19,980
You coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2339
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:34,970
The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself.

2340
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:38,730
The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today

2341
02:19:39,470 --> 02:19:42,610
I end up tossing into the back alley.

2342
02:19:57,080 --> 02:19:58,980
'69.

2343
02:20:04,290 --> 02:20:05,620
You live alone?

2344
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:07,530
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2345
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:13,980
So, that would be about

2346
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:18,180
nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2347
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:22,970
Yeah.

2348
02:20:26,650 --> 02:20:30,960
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

2349
02:20:37,020 --> 02:20:39,940
Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house?

2350
02:20:41,530 --> 02:20:44,240
Would you like
to go upstairs and check?

2351
02:20:44,930 --> 02:20:46,830
No.

2352
02:20:49,070 --> 02:20:51,640
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2353
02:20:52,470 --> 02:20:54,370
You're welcome.

2354
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:17,130
It's locked.

2355
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:29,370
Thank you.

2356
02:21:31,910 --> 02:21:33,950
Good night, Mr. Graysmith!

2357
02:21:53,870 --> 02:21:57,580
Two killers. Got to be two killers.
One has the...

2358
02:22:05,410 --> 02:22:07,310
Guys?

2359
02:22:40,150 --> 02:22:42,130
You've got five minutes.

2360
02:22:50,260 --> 02:22:52,160
Linda?

2361
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,460
Hi, I'm Robert.

2362
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,900
Did you get my note?

2363
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:02,700
-What's this about?
-Zodiac.

2364
02:23:04,240 --> 02:23:06,140
Figures.

2365
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:08,710
-You got the look.
-What look?

2366
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:11,680
I didn't mean anything.

2367
02:23:12,910 --> 02:23:15,320
Tell me about this painting party.

2368
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:19,120
I told the cops about that so long ago.

2369
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:24,420
Darlene always had
a lot of boys around,

2370
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:26,320
even though she was married.

2371
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:28,360
And this one guy was weird, though.

2372
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:31,940
He used to bring her presents
from Tijuana and...

2373
02:23:33,130 --> 02:23:35,030
I don't know why
she was friends with him.

2374
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:37,740
She once told me he'd killed somebody.

2375
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:40,070
Really?

2376
02:23:40,070 --> 02:23:41,970
Yeah, I think maybe
when he was in the service.

2377
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:44,280
-Navy?
-I think so.

2378
02:23:44,440 --> 02:23:46,340
Was he into movies?
Was he a movie buff?

2379
02:23:46,710 --> 02:23:48,610
I can tell you that
he was not into people.

2380
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:51,150
The party Darlene threw,

2381
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:53,050
people were supposed to
just show up and drink beer, help paint.

2382
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:56,050
But this guy showed up in a suit,

2383
02:23:56,490 --> 02:23:58,390
and just sat in a chair
all by himself all night long.

2384
02:23:59,530 --> 02:24:01,060
Didn't talk to anyone.

2385
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:02,960
And Darlene told me
to stay away from him.

2386
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,900
She was scared of him.

2387
02:24:07,100 --> 02:24:09,000
And a couple of weeks later,
she was dead.

2388
02:24:09,670 --> 02:24:12,170
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2389
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:15,040
I mean, it was short,
like a nickname, like Stan.

2390
02:24:17,110 --> 02:24:19,450
-Rick?
-No, I don't think so.

2391
02:24:20,310 --> 02:24:22,210
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

2392
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:24,520
How can you be sure?
It was a long time ago. Think hard.

2393
02:24:25,250 --> 02:24:27,150
I am thinking hard.

2394
02:24:27,390 --> 02:24:29,290
It was Rick.

2395
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:30,990
No, it wasn't.

2396
02:24:30,990 --> 02:24:32,890
-It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.
-No.

2397
02:24:33,460 --> 02:24:35,260
Just say it!

2398
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:37,160
It wasn't Rick.

2399
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:51,780
It was Leigh.

2400
02:24:54,380 --> 02:24:56,950
-Leigh?
-Yeah, Leigh.

2401
02:24:58,250 --> 02:25:00,150
Sounds right.

2402
02:25:04,390 --> 02:25:06,290
Officer! I need you to let me in.

2403
02:25:07,330 --> 02:25:09,230
-Is this an emergency?
-No, I just need to see one file.

2404
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:11,300
No, you need to come back
tomorrow morning.

2405
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:13,200
-One file, just for one second.
-8:00 a. m., when we're open.

2406
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,330
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2407
02:25:15,330 --> 02:25:17,230
Sergeant, I just need to see one file!

2408
02:25:17,870 --> 02:25:21,320
Just give me five minutes.
I know exactly where it is.

2409
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:24,180
Please!

2410
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:38,590
I shouldn't be talking to you.

2411
02:25:38,590 --> 02:25:40,630
-You got five minutes.
-Okay.

2412
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:44,200
Here. Here.

2413
02:25:44,200 --> 02:25:46,100
Linda states that some of
Darlene's closest friends are Leigh,

2414
02:25:48,070 --> 02:25:49,970
who used to bring Darlene
presents from Tijuana.

2415
02:25:51,140 --> 02:25:53,040
-So what?
-He knew her.

2416
02:25:53,140 --> 02:25:54,940
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2417
02:25:54,940 --> 02:25:56,840
No. That's just one name in a file
that contains hundreds.

2418
02:25:57,480 --> 02:25:59,380
It's nothing.

2419
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:01,890
-Dave Toschi...
-Agrees with me.

2420
02:26:02,380 --> 02:26:05,290
Our investigation
into this subject is over.

2421
02:26:08,250 --> 02:26:10,150
I'm sorry.

2422
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:20,600
Hello.

2423
02:26:35,010 --> 02:26:36,910
Who's there?

2424
02:26:39,890 --> 02:26:41,790
-You didn't return my calls.
-Oh, I've been kind of busy.

2425
02:26:43,490 --> 02:26:45,390
Yeah. I can see that.

2426
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:49,460
How's the book coming?

2427
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:54,500
I tried to send you these.

2428
02:26:55,570 --> 02:26:57,440
I called the Chron.

2429
02:26:57,440 --> 02:27:00,250
Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...

2430
02:27:01,770 --> 02:27:03,670
I heard.

2431
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:10,790
When's the last time
you ate something?

2432
02:27:13,290 --> 02:27:15,430
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2433
02:27:18,090 --> 02:27:20,400
-Did it ever?
-Yeah, it did.

2434
02:27:21,860 --> 02:27:24,810
Robert, it was just the date
that didn't end.

2435
02:27:25,260 --> 02:27:27,160
You don't mean that.

2436
02:27:28,470 --> 02:27:30,370
A little.

2437
02:27:32,540 --> 02:27:34,440
The kids miss you.

2438
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:37,580
-I can't have them see me like this.
-Neither can I.

2439
02:27:38,310 --> 02:27:40,450
So, do whatever you have to,

2440
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:43,280
but finish this.

2441
02:28:10,480 --> 02:28:12,380
Dave!

2442
02:28:12,410 --> 02:28:14,310
Dave! It's Robert!

2443
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:17,950
-Dave!
-Is he actually here?

2444
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:19,850
I'm gonna kill him.

2445
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:22,660
I'm calling SFPD. Where's my gun?

2446
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:26,420
Dave!

2447
02:28:26,430 --> 02:28:28,260
Robert! Go away!

2448
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:30,160
Dave! He made a mistake!

2449
02:28:30,330 --> 02:28:32,230
-Get away from the window.
-I'll meet you around front.

2450
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:34,300
No, you won't.

2451
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:36,930
-You have to hear this!
-No, I don't, Robert!

2452
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:39,240
The birthday was the one time
that he was weak!

2453
02:28:39,910 --> 02:28:41,810
The one time
that he gave something away!

2454
02:28:41,810 --> 02:28:45,150
-Robert, I am calling the police.
-It's Arthur Leigh Allen!

2455
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:52,050
Where did you get that name?

2456
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:54,150
He called the Bellis' house.

2457
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:56,050
December '69.
"I need to kill. Today's my birthday. "

2458
02:28:56,490 --> 02:28:58,390
It was his birthday.

2459
02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:01,500
Arthur Leigh Allen
was born on December 18th.

2460
02:29:04,530 --> 02:29:06,430
Get in here.

2461
02:29:08,030 --> 02:29:10,240
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

2462
02:29:13,170 --> 02:29:15,070
He wrote me, you know?

2463
02:29:15,710 --> 02:29:16,940
2,500 suspects,

2464
02:29:16,940 --> 02:29:20,550
the only one who ever wrote me
a letter was Leigh Allen.

2465
02:29:21,450 --> 02:29:23,250
They like to help, you know, sometimes.

2466
02:29:23,250 --> 02:29:25,150
Yes, Robert, I know.

2467
02:29:26,150 --> 02:29:28,050
He was arrested January 1975
for molestation.

2468
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:30,860
He sent me that when he got out.

2469
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:32,860
"Dear Dave, if I can ever be
of any help to you, just let me know.

2470
02:29:33,790 --> 02:29:35,690
"I'm sorry I wasn't your man. "

2471
02:29:35,730 --> 02:29:37,400
And it's typewritten.

2472
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:39,810
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2473
02:29:41,230 --> 02:29:43,130
And he knew Darlene.

2474
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:46,440
It's in the Vallejo files.

2475
02:29:51,610 --> 02:29:53,510
Mulanax said that
he was your favorite suspect.

2476
02:29:55,050 --> 02:29:59,050
That you spent two years on him,
and that nobody ever came close.

2477
02:30:02,090 --> 02:30:04,090
All the evidence said no.

2478
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:07,260
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2479
02:30:07,690 --> 02:30:10,870
The same Sherwood
that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2480
02:30:11,730 --> 02:30:13,630
Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill
in writing saying,

2481
02:30:13,770 --> 02:30:14,900
"I'm sorry, this just won't work. "

2482
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:16,770
-But you also have Terry Pascoe...
-His protÃ©gÃ©.

2483
02:30:16,770 --> 02:30:17,900
Yeah, fine, it's his protÃ©gÃ©,

2484
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:19,800
but he's a handwriting expert
nonetheless, and he's saying,

2485
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:21,740
"Do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting. "

2486
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:24,540
-So the two cancel each other out.
-No, they don't.

2487
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:26,080
It was Sherwood's case.

2488
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:27,650
He was the head
of Questioned Documents.

2489
02:30:27,650 --> 02:30:29,080
If it went to trial,

2490
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:30,980
all the defense would have to do
is call Sherwood to the stand.

2491
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:34,050
And there was no way of getting Allen
into court in the first place,

2492
02:30:34,890 --> 02:30:36,220
because there was no evidence, Robert.

2493
02:30:36,220 --> 02:30:37,490
What do you mean,
there's no evidence?

2494
02:30:37,490 --> 02:30:38,690
You have him seen with the ciphers.

2495
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:40,590
The military boot prints.
The same size shoes and gloves.

2496
02:30:41,030 --> 02:30:42,930
The Most Dangerous Game.
The Zodiac watch.

2497
02:30:43,330 --> 02:30:44,630
The background with school children.

2498
02:30:44,630 --> 02:30:46,530
The misspellings of Christ-mass.
The bloody knives.

2499
02:30:46,570 --> 02:30:48,470
All circumstantial.

2500
02:30:48,530 --> 02:30:50,430
Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.

2501
02:30:51,370 --> 02:30:53,240
We should have found
one of those things in that trailer.

2502
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:55,140
-We didn't.
-That's...

2503
02:30:57,380 --> 02:30:59,280
Okay. Catherine Allen states that

2504
02:30:59,480 --> 02:31:01,380
"Leigh cleaned out his trailer
on Friday after work

2505
02:31:01,710 --> 02:31:03,610
"and moved it to Santa Rosa
on Saturday, August 7th, 1971."

2506
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:07,380
You interviewed him
at the refinery on August 4th.

2507
02:31:07,590 --> 02:31:09,220
-Yeah.
-So, he's cleaning out his trailer,

2508
02:31:09,220 --> 02:31:13,100
he's moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him?

2509
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:16,560
Okay. Okay.
Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.

2510
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:18,960
All right.

2511
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:20,860
Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen
and the Zodiac, their timelines.

2512
02:31:21,830 --> 02:31:23,730
-When was the first murder in Vallejo?
-Christmas, 1968.

2513
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:26,540
Eight months before that,
Allen is fired for molesting his students

2514
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:29,240
and his family discovers
that he's a pedophile.

2515
02:31:29,540 --> 02:31:31,440
-Now, when do the letters begin?
-July, '69.

2516
02:31:31,940 --> 02:31:33,710
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2517
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:35,610
And they continue
until you go to see him at work.

2518
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:38,780
Now, after that, do any of the letters
contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?

2519
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:42,120
No. Because he dumped them,
because he got scared.

2520
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:43,960
Because he knew
that you were on to him.

2521
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:45,860
-So, when's the next letter from Zodiac?
-Not until January of 1974.

2522
02:31:47,790 --> 02:31:49,290
He is silent for three years.

2523
02:31:49,300 --> 02:31:51,200
Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again

2524
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:53,100
because everybody's moved off
Allen as a suspect.

2525
02:31:53,170 --> 02:31:54,270
And what do we get?

2526
02:31:54,270 --> 02:31:56,170
Three new letters from Zodiac
in January, May, and July in '74.

2527
02:31:58,370 --> 02:32:01,510
-But then the letters stop.
-What happens to Allen?

2528
02:32:05,010 --> 02:32:06,910
He's arrested.

2529
02:32:07,410 --> 02:32:09,310
January, 1975,
they send him to Atascadero.

2530
02:32:10,850 --> 02:32:12,750
We don't get another letter from Zodiac
the entire time he's there.

2531
02:32:13,850 --> 02:32:15,750
-When is he released?
-August, '77.

2532
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:18,490
Allen gets out. He types you an apology,
and then what?

2533
02:32:20,430 --> 02:32:23,630
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years.

2534
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:31,140
Okay. Zodiac had to have known
Darlene Ferrin, right?

2535
02:32:32,710 --> 02:32:34,610
Yes, because of the phone calls
on the night of her murder.

2536
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:36,940
Because of the Vallejo file,

2537
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:39,840
we know that Darlene knew
a man named Leigh?

2538
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:41,150
Yes.

2539
02:32:41,150 --> 02:32:43,010
So, all coincidence aside, Robert,

2540
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:44,920
how can you be sure that Leigh Allen
is the Leigh from this file?

2541
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:47,820
Now, Vallejo is a small town,
but it's not that small.

2542
02:32:48,490 --> 02:32:49,890
How do you put
the two of them together?

2543
02:32:49,890 --> 02:32:51,790
This is a case that's covered
both Northern and Southern California,

2544
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:55,060
with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles.

2545
02:32:55,630 --> 02:32:57,530
-Would you agree?
-Yes.

2546
02:32:58,630 --> 02:33:00,530
Darlene Ferrin worked
at the Vallejo House of Pancakes

2547
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:04,070
on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.

2548
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:11,650
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his
mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2549
02:33:13,350 --> 02:33:16,760
Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.

2550
02:33:20,150 --> 02:33:22,050
Is that true?

2551
02:33:22,660 --> 02:33:24,560
I've walked it.

2552
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:29,890
Jesus Christ.

2553
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:38,040
So?

2554
02:33:41,070 --> 02:33:42,740
The prints, the handwriting...

2555
02:33:42,740 --> 02:33:45,740
-I'm not asking you as a cop.
-But I am a cop.

2556
02:33:48,580 --> 02:33:50,480
I can't prove this.

2557
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:52,620
Just because you can't prove it,
doesn't mean it's not true.

2558
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:55,650
Easy, Dirty Harry.

2559
02:33:58,990 --> 02:34:00,890
Finish the book.

2560
02:34:09,470 --> 02:34:11,970
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2561
02:35:20,210 --> 02:35:22,110
Can I help you?

2562
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:25,280
No.

2563
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:47,660
Mr. Mageau.

2564
02:36:47,790 --> 02:36:49,690
Thanks for coming to see me.

2565
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:51,630
You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2566
02:36:51,630 --> 02:36:55,200
I'm George Bawart. Vallejo PD.
I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2567
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:58,100
It's been 22 years.
I don't know how I can help you.

2568
02:36:59,270 --> 02:37:00,540
Well, this is just a formality.

2569
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:02,040
I'm gonna show you
a group of photographs.

2570
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:03,940
Now, the person that shot you
may or may not be

2571
02:37:04,010 --> 02:37:05,910
among these photographs.

2572
02:37:06,150 --> 02:37:07,450
You don't have to pick anybody out

2573
02:37:07,450 --> 02:37:09,350
just because I'm showing you
these pictures, you understand?

2574
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:11,620
Yes, sir, I do.

2575
02:37:12,150 --> 02:37:14,050
All right.

2576
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:16,420
Take your time.

2577
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:19,370
If you don't recognize anyone,
that's okay.

2578
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:32,700
That's him.

2579
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:35,540
How sure are you?

2580
02:37:35,670 --> 02:37:37,570
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2581
02:37:40,210 --> 02:37:41,450
He had a round face like this guy.

2582
02:37:41,450 --> 02:37:42,750
Wait. Am I to understand

2583
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:44,620
that you're now identifying
the second photograph?

2584
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:47,720
No, no. Just that
he had a round face like that.

2585
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:51,660
It's this man.

2586
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:54,060
All right.

2587
02:37:55,290 --> 02:37:58,400
Now, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being positive,

2588
02:38:02,470 --> 02:38:04,370
how sure are you?

2589
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:09,740
At least an eight.

2590
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:16,160
The last time I saw this face
was July 4th, 1969.

2591
02:38:19,380 --> 02:38:22,130
I am very sure
that's the man who shot me.
