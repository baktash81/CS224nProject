Can I take your order?

31
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,427
Uh...

32
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,462
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,998

B-a-b-y, baby.

37
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,017
Could you pass that?

38
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,190
Baby.

45
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,917
I told you, no.

46
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,596
I can't deal with you right now.

47
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,402
Be on time.

48
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,200
<i>It is believed that the robbers</i>

49

50
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,356
What's his deal?

51
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,326
Baby?
Full cut, same as everyone.

52
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,241
No, doc,
I mean is he, uh, retarded?

53
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,899
"Retarded" means slow.
Was he slow?

54
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:40,566
No.

55
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,102
Then he don't sound
that retarded to me.

56
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,071
He's a good kid and
a devil behind the wheel.

57
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,772
What the hell else more
do you need to know?

58
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,209
So you don't think that there's
something wrong with him

59
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,844
just not saying anything?

60
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,280
There's nothing wrong
with a little quiet.

61
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,449
You know why
they call him baby, right?

62
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,429
Still waiting on
his first words.

63
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,431
So, you're a mute, baby?
Is that what it is?

64
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,745
God.

65
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,269
Are you a mute?

66
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,349
No.

67
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,341
So, um,
what are you listening to?

68
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,476
Uh, music.

69
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,378
That's right.
You tell him, baby.

70
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,092
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

71
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,118
For god's sakes, Griff,
leave the kid alone.

72
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,121
You can't just be
in crime, right?

73
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,589
Not without being
a little criminal.

74
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:40,359
I just want to find out what's
going on between those ears,

75
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,773
aside, of course, from, uh...

76
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,031
<i>Egyptian reggae.</i>

77
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,098
What's it matter to you?

78
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,735
Just think that he thinks
he's better than us.

79
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,103
He wants to sit there in his car

80
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,040
and keep his white shirt
clean while the rest of us,

81
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,387
we roll in the dirt.

82
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:59,145
One of these days, baby,

83
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,813
you're gonna get
blood on your hands,

84
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,316
and you're gonna
find out that that shit

85
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,484
don't wash off
in the fucking sink.

86
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,820
Relax. The kid did
his job, all right?

87
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,757
I ever say that the kid
wasn't great at his job? No.

88
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,371
I think he's a star.

89
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,341
Would I vouch for him
if he wasn't?

90
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,172
Got to hand it to you,
totem pole,

91
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:31,188
you're either hard as
nails or scared as shit.

92
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:34,625
Which one is it?

93
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,694
What do you think
about that, baby?

94
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,731
Mommy and daddy
are getting it on.

95
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,531
Enough.

96
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,100
Yeah, where do you get off?

97
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,501
Right...

98
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,470
Here.

99
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,374
Okay, folks,
if you don't see me again,

100
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,088
it's 'cause I'm dead.

101
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:07,179
Tell me about tonight, buddy.

102
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:12,952
Tonight, darling, we will have
post-heist revelry at bacchanalia.

103
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,955
Why, that is
the finest winin' and dinin'

104
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,725
of all the wines
and dines in town.

105
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,728
Ah, that's us.

106
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:23,396
Bye.

107
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,897
Well, sir,
expect the lady and myself

108
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,300
to darken your door
once the nose bag is empty.

109
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,870
And, baby, you did good, kid.

110
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,906
Do me a favor.
Next time doc calls,

111
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,409
don't pick up.

112
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,622
Don't listen to him.

113
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:48,054
Now, I get absolutely no pleasure
in taking candy from baby,

114
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:52,970
but we're fast approaching
the day when you...

115
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,306
Will be all paid up.

116
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,665
One more job and I'm done?

117
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,068
One more job and we're straight.

118
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,603
Sound good?

119
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,438
Oh...

120
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:10,276
I was gonna wait until we were
square, but what the hell.

121
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,322
These are for you.

122
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,425
Now give me your burner.

123
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:20,252
I'm gonna need you behind
the wheel again real soon.

124
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,833
You call, I'm there.

125
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,698
<i>Here's what we know.</i>

126
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,366
<i>Two men and a woman
came into the bank branch</i>

127
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,902
<i>clad in black business clothing,</i>

128
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,238
<i>trench coats,
bandanas and sunglasses.</i>

129
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,475
<i>They pulled guns and ordered
everybody to the floor,</i>

130
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,976
<i>and then cleaned out
the registers.</i>

131
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:49,115
<i>And hear this, they even swiped
jewelry from some of the customers.</i>

132
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:49,915
You awake?

133
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,617
<i>They ran out of the bank
to a waiting getaway car.</i>

134
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:56,033
<i>A driver was there to take them away.
It was a red...</i>

135
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:57,957
You hungry?

136
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,091
Always.

137
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,971
You got it.

138
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:19,289
Spread to the edges!

139
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:24,483
<i>Is a young Caucasian male.</i>

140
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,118
<i>His identity
remains as yet unknown,</i>

141
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,154
<i>and police are
appealing to anyone</i>

142
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,023
<i>who might recognize him
to come forward.</i>

143
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,092
<i>The search for
the suspect is ongoing.</i>

144
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,660
<i>Police pursued
the getaway vehicle</i>

145
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,042
<i>across downtown Atlanta
and I-85 by helicopter.</i>

146
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:47,406
Where is that cash from?

147
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,519
Work.

148
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:50,776
One more job.

149
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,357
Then I'm done.

150
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,515
You don't

151
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,716
belong

152
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,518
in that world.

153
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,866
Sorry, couldn't hear you.
I have a banana in my ear.

154
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:07,137
You heard me.

155
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:21,540
<i>They grow up so freaking
fast, don't they?</i>

156
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,641
<i>You and I are a team.</i>

157
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,011
<i>Nothing is more important
than our friendship.</i>

158
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,446
<i>How's that working out for you?</i>

159
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:31,383
<i>And still the bull stands,
bloodied but unrelenting.</i>

160
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,352
<i>Gaston is running out of time.</i>

161
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,921
<i>He's had his tries
from horseback.</i>

162
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,090
<i>Now he must try to
end this on foot.</i>

163
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,860
<i>"Retarded" means slow.
Was he slow?</i>

164
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,627
<i>No.</i>

165
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,062
<i>Was he slow?</i>

166
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:43,829
<i>No.</i>

167
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,197
<i>Was he slow?</i>

168
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,966
<i>No.</i>

169
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,101
<i>"Retarded" means slow.
Was he slow?</i>

170
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,081
<i>No.</i>

171
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,240
<i>"Retarded" means slow.

<i>No.</i>

173
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,421
<i>Slow? ...Slow? ...Slow?</i>

174
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,275
So, what can I get
you this fine morning?

175
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,700
Uh...

176
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,202
Oh, don't worry
if you need a second.

177
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,105
I have all
the time in the world.

178
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,652
Whoa, are you recording this?

179
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:10,109
Oh, uh...

180
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,810
Am I being monitored
for quality assurance?

181
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,379
No. I... I...

182
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,113
No.

183
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,215
Um, hello? Hello, testing.

184
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:20,230
What can I get you
this fine morning, sir?

185
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:22,588
Um...

186
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,657
Oh, um, you know
that's a kid's menu, right?

187
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:26,558
Yeah, oh.

188
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,593
I get it. It's early.

189
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,496
So you just starting your day
or did you just get off?

190
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:35,045
Oh, I don't know if I ever get off.
They call, I go, you know?

191
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,483
So, what is it you do?

192
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm a driver.

193
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,941
Oh, like a...
Like a chauffeur.

194
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,943
You drive around
important people?

195
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,278
I guess I do.

196
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,880
Anyone I'd know?

197
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,847
I hope not.

198
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,294
Well, aren't you mysterious.

199
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:52,251
Maybe.

200
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,620
Maybe?

201
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,057
So, when was the last time
you hit the road just for fun?

202
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,224
Yesterday.

203
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,292
Oh, then I'm jealous.

204
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,795
Sometimes all I want to do
is head west on 20

205
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,265
in a car I can't afford
with a plan I don't have.

206
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,401
Just me, my music and the road.

207
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,614
I'd like that, too.

208
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,038
Oh.

209
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,007
Uh, so,
you decide on anything yet?

210
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,543
You are so beautiful.

211
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,912
You just decided that.

212
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,381
Oh, well, thank you.

213
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,882
I'm sure you don't mean it.

214
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,784
I do mean it.

215
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,464
Jonathan?

216
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:28,854
Oh, sorry.

217
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,055
You know, this isn't my badge.

218
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,824
I've only just
started here, so...

219
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,392
As a Jonathan?

220
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,761
Yeah. As a Jonathan.

221
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,709
Well, um, if you have any
more questions, just holler.

222
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,383
I have a question.

223
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:49,119
What's that song you're singing?

224
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,905
I approve.

225
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,473
Of the song?

226
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,120
Of the girl.

227
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:44,630
<i>Oh, there you are.
I've been calling, baby.</i>

228
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,931
You have?
<i>I have.</i>

229
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,600
<i>My chicken just
laid a very big egg.</i>

230
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,302
<i>You in?</i>
Am I in?

231
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,583
<i>It was
a rhetorical question, baby.</i>

232
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,174
<i>You're in.</i>

233
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,820
I'll be there.

234
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,053
Meet your new crew.

235
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,291
Over here is Eddie no nose,
formerly Eddie the nose.

236
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,492
Why, what happened?

237
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,526
Don't ask me that.

238
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,095
That's a no nose no-no,
page one.

239
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,063
And right here is JD.

240
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,831
He put the "Asian"
in home invasion.

241
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,467
And over there is
the one and the only bats.

242
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,535
No need for intros, doc.

243
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,417
Everybody from the jungle
to the trap know bats.

244
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:30,309
This your boy, right?

245
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,245
This the one you say listens
to the music all the time?

246
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,993
The driver's supposed
to be the eyes and the ears,

247
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:37,983
not just the eyes.

248
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,452
Why does he listen to music
all the time, doc?

249
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,287
- He's got mental problems?
- No, no, no, no.

250
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,791
I'm the one got the mental
problems in the crew.

251
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,892
Position taken.

252
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,260
He's got tinnitus.

253
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,161
Tinna-what?

254
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,629
He had an accident
when he was a kid.

255
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:54,344
He's still got a hum in the drum.
Plays music to drown it out.

256
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,648
Yeah, but you feel me.

257
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:03,041
Hat?

258
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:03,775
Huh?

259
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,310
Your tattoo says, "hat."

260
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,079
Yeah. It used to say "hate."

261
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,416
But to increase my chances of
employment, I got the "e" removed.

262
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,185
How's that working out for you?

263
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,554
Who doesn't like hats?

264
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,388
So, doc,

265
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,090
how many jobs
you done with the kid?

266
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,691
If you can't take
my word for him,

267
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,227
then get back in
that fucking elevator.

268
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,642
You never heard of
the spirit of 85?

269
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:27,833
The joyrider?
Yeah.

270
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,136
The ghost that baited
cops doing 130 on 85.

271
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,372
Headlights off,
brake lights disconnected.

272
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,641
He drove 'em around in circles
on spaghetti junction.

273
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,644
Left 'em in the dust every time.
That was our boy there.

274
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,145
Wasn't that, like, 10 years ago?
Yeah.

275
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,513
Well, like I said,
that was our boy.

276
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,582
He's been boosting cars
since he was old enough

277
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,616
to see over the dash.

278
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,285
He stole my Mercedes.
Had a lot of merch in it.

279
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,186
I watched him do it, too.
I didn't stop him, though,

280
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,023
'cause I was just blinded
by the balls on that kid.

281
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,391
'Course he didn't know
who I was,

282
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,393
or the worth of the junk in
the trunk once he dumped it,

283
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,996
but once I tracked him down, I
made sure to tell him who I was,

284
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,999
what I was capable of,
and how much he owed me.

285
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,634
And since he's
been paying me back,

286
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,037
he's also shown me
what he's capable of.

287
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:05,704
Wow.

288
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,205
I just drew a whole
goddamn map in chalk

289
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,940
while we've been
standing here squawking.

290
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,910
That's pretty
fucking impressive, right?

291
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,691
Shop, let's talk it.
Baby, you with us?

292
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,589
Bank robbers. Whatever.

293
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,026
It's got to be ready for
an 8:30 start in the A.M.

294
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,772
Questions?

295
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:04,830
I got a question, doc.

296
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,066
Why would I believe phones over
here heard a goddamn word you said?

297
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:12,449
You laid down your whole play.
He ain't even listening.

298
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,118
Baby?

299
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:21,146
The target is an armored truck

300
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,981
at perimeter trust in
Dunwoody, 10:00 A.M. sharp.

301
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,149
We have the details of the route

302
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,151
because someone at the depot
has a nasal problem.

303
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,153
The bank itself is right
near the Buford highway,

304
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,388
so we should be able
to hit the ramp

305
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,756
within 60 seconds
of getting out.

306
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:31,990
We also have a diversion crew.

307
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,593
They're gonna blow up
a bread truck a ways away,

308
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,594
keep the fuzz busy.

309
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,596
The dress code is the Michael
Myers <i>Halloween</i> mask,

310
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,566
but don't all buy your masks at the
same time. It looks suspicious.

311
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,634
The switch car is ready,

312
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,669
but you want me to hit the
long-stay parking structure

313
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:45,704
at Hartsfield-Jackson

314
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,606
to get a heist vehicle
that stays colder longer.

315
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,307
Boost a commuter car,
a family car,

316
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,176
something that blends in well
with morning traffic.

317
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:55,113
Something on the heavy side in case
we need to ram the cops off the road.

318
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,949
A escalade, Yukon,
avalanche, whatever.

319
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:02,499
It needs to be ready
for an 8:30 start in the A.M.

320
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,890
Questions?

321
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,358
Well, ain't y'all cute.

322
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,193
That's my baby.

323
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,173
Fuck your baby.

324
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:35,320
What's in there is ours.

325
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,155
It belongs to us.

326
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,758
They took our money,
our hard-earned paper.

327
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,493
They snuck in when we
were asleep last night

328
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:45,030
and took the pants off the
chair and emptied our wallets.

329
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,811
They got what's rightfully ours.

330
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,969
Let's go get it back,

331
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,082
what's rightfully ours.

332
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,210
What the fuck is this mask?

333
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,277
Austin powers.

334
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,313
Doc said Michael Myers!

335
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,414
This is Mike Myers!

336
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,982
It should be the<i> Halloween</i> mask.

337
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:04,983
This is a Halloween mask!

338
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,552
No, the killer dude
from<i> Halloween.</i>

339
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,653
Oh, you mean Jason.

340
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,856
- No!
- No! God! Fuck!

341
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,190
Let's go.
Wait, wait.

342
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,304
I got to start the song over.

343
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:17,996
The fuck?

344
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,609
What?

345
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:20,777
Okay, go.

346
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:32,288
Move!

347
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:34,324
Go!

348
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,875
Go!

349
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:54,799
Yeah, we out! Let's go!

350
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,401
- Let's move!
- I got this.

351
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,415
Come on! Let's go!

352
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:01,884
Man up!
It's a tough business.

353
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:03,275
Go! Hit it!

354
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,355
Yeah, baby!

355
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,481
Look out! Fuck!

356
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,515
What the fuck?

357
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,694
- We got a hero!
- Go!

358
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,638
God damn!
Fuck! Get him!

359
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:25,942
Do your job, baby.
Let's go!

360
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,844
Shit!

361
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,216
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

362
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,596
Yeah!

363
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:53,870
That's how you do it, baby!

364
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:57,473
Come on!

365
00:27:58,075 --> 00:28:00,376
Yes!

366
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,680
Ha!

367
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,773
What the fuck?
Soldier boy.

368
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,919
He ain't giving up, huh?

369
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:20,063
Come on, soldier boy.

370
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,587
Shit!

371
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,267
Ah! No, no, no, no! No!

372
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,370
No!
No!

373
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,674
Got your ass now.

374
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,214
Damn it! I had that g.I. Joe
motherfucker dead to rights!

375
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,049
God damn!

376
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,397
New ride. Let's go.

377
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,958
Come on, boys, let's rock!

378
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,826
Move! Move! Move! Move!

379
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,473
Huh? Sweetheart.
Oh, my love.

380
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,432
Get out the car!

381
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,233
I have a child!

382
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,879
I got one, too.
Get the fuck out!

383
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,404
No!
Come on!

384
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,917
Get in! Let's move.

385
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,242
Here, it's okay.

386
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,110
- Bring your sorry ass over!
- God damn it! Shit!

387
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,945
- Baby, what are you doing?
- Here, take him.

388
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,547
Leave the baby in the car.
Leave the baby in the car!

389
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,107
Get your damn weird ass
over here now!

390
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,132
- Come on! Let's go!
- I'm coming!

391
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,170
Let's rock!

392
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,307
Let's go!

393
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:43,412
Oh, shit! No! Fuck!

394
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:46,304
I left my shotgun behind.

395
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,105
What?

396
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,339
I left my shotgun behind.

397
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,388
Not groovy, JD.
Not groovy at all.

398
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,491
Cops! Cops! Cops!

399
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,828
Shit. Get down.

400
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:02,131
Stay down. Stay down.

401
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,839
<i>All units be on the lookout</i>

402
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,654
<i>for a red Saturn aura,
license plate...</i>

403
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:44,129
You see JD over there?
Now, JD's a idiot.

404
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,598
But you a bright boy, though.

405
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,045
So I got a question for you.

406
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:52,415
You make me miss that shot?

407
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,719
Come on, now.

408
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,055
You can tell me.

409
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:01,724
No.

410
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,149
You're a good driver.

411
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,395
You're a bad liar, though.

412
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:11,734
In this business, the moment
you catch feelings...

413
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:15,538
Is the moment
you catch a bullet.

414
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:18,007
Now, pick up your purse
and go get the coffee.

415
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,438
About goddamn time.

416
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:57,001
Oh, you looking for JD?

417
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,470
International man of mystery?

418
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,718
'Cause he's long gone, baby.

419
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,243
You got that right.

420
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,557
Just put it down.
We'll drink it.

421
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:21,960
So, this is it.

422
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,073
I'm a man of my word.

423
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,478
And you're all straight, baby.

424
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:31,769
That's it?

425
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,637
Sure is.

426
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,285
- You're all paid up.
- Cause for celebration.

427
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,654
Yeah, sure is.

428
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:41,813
Oh.

429
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,961
Yeah, well, before you
go completely crazy...

430
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:53,602
You need to sunset that ride.

431
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:55,938
Drive safe, baby.

432
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:33,017
You're back.

433
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,053
I sure am.
Well, then, you, sir,

434
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,487
are gonna be
my very last customer,

435
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,458
because I am walking out that
door in precisely 30 seconds.

436
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,826
You're leaving?

437
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:42,860
Yes, sir.

438
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,828
Can I come with you?

439
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,375
You don't have work or nothing?

440
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:50,535
Uh, I don't.
I am done with work.

441
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,903
Wow. You seem real
happy about that.

442
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,005
Yeah, I sure am.

443
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:54,939
God damn it!

444
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,808
I don't blame you. Well,
you're welcome to come with,

445
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:00,745
but I don't know how exciting
you're gonna find the laundromat.

446
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,312
Huh?

447
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,747
I got to run some errands.
Oh.

448
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:07,552
But think about what you want, and
I will stick around just for you.

449
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,352
Coffee?

450
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:11,355
Please. Uh, cream and sugar.

451
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,459
So, how you two getting along?

452
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,293
Oh, good.

453
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,327
He's sweet, isn't he?

454
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,564
That kid? He's been coming
here since before me.

455
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,811
Think maybe his mom
used to work here.

456
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:24,813
Huh.

457
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,150
Know what you want?

458
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:31,843
Your name?

459
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,523
Well, you can get that for free.

460
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:36,581
It's Debbie. Debora.

461
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,883
Oh, like the song.

462
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:39,951
The Beck one? Yeah.

463
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:44,522
Well, except I'm d-e-b-o-r-a, and
I think that's just d-e-b-r-a.

464
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,157
I don't know that one.

465
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,736
Oh, it goes, um...

466
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:00,872
Jenny?

467
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,040
The song's about him wanting
to get with Jenny

468
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,409
and her sister, too,
whose name is Debra.

469
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,213
So it's not even really about me.
It's about the sister.

470
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:13,451
My sister's name is Mary.
She has got all the songs.

471
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,286
"Mary, Mary,
where you goin' to?"

472
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,288
"Proud Mary keep on burnin'."

473
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,890
"The wind cries Mary."

474
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,025
She's got me beat. Again.

475
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,629
She's got endless songs.
I got one.

476
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,397
No, you got two.

477
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,331
What's the other one?

478
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,100
<i>Debora,</i>
the song I'm talking about.

479
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,614
Who by?
Trex.

480
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:33,404
T.Rex?

481
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,238
Uh, yeah.

482
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,541
I've heard of them,
but don't know that one.

483
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,320
How's it go?

484
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:41,056
Oh.

485
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,251
"A Zeb-Ora"?

486
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,553
Like a zebra, I guess.

487
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,621
Yeah. Well, I'm wearing
black and white,

488
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,601
so you can call me Deebra.

489
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,259
Actually, I actually
got<i> Debora</i> on here.

490
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,629
Okay, what? How many
of those do you have?

491
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,533
Oh, I got different iPods
for different days and moods.

492
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,315
Oh. And you're in
a pink and glittery mood.

493
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:08,384
I am now.

494
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:11,809
What is your name?

495
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,978
Baby.
Wait, what?

496
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,413
Your name's baby?

497
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,181
B-a-b-y, baby?

498
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:17,915
Yeah.

499
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,462
Well, then,
you have us all beat.

500
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,420
Every damn song is about you.

501
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,056
We could drive back and forth
across the states forever

502
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,857
and never run out
of "baby" songs.

503
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,271
We might run out of gas, though.

504
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:34,643
Did your mom call
you "baby" as a kid?

505
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:35,666
Sometimes.

506
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,969
She used to work here?

507
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:42,651
Sometimes, but,
uh, she was a singer, too.

508
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:45,220
What does she do now?

509
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:48,123
Nothing.

510
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:51,682
Uh, I could find
<i>Debora</i> if you want.

511
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,384
Debbie!

512
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,698
For crying out loud.

513
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:57,788
Well, uh, play it
for me sometime

514
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,402
I don't have to get out of here.

515
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,659
Deal?

516
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,060
Yeah, deal.

517
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,730
Now, you know what you want yet?

518
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,676
To get out of here.

519
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,755
You're right. I do like it.

520
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,056
Good.

521
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,126
So, what's your story, baby?

522
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,861
You from here?

523
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,029
I am.

524
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,731
Keep going. Keep going.

525
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:41,932
You're from here.
Uh-huh.

526
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:47,116
You're a driver. You like music.
You don't talk much.

527
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:47,772
No.

528
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:51,275
I've, uh, spoken more
to you today

529
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,411
than I have to anyone all year.

530
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,012
Whoa.

531
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,514
Okay.

532
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,116
Not a motor-mouth. Noted.

533
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,018
Yeah, yeah. I have...

534
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:04,021
I have this, uh, hearing thing.

535
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,324
I was in an accident
when I was little.

536
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,159
Is that what
happened to your mom?

537
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,472
Yeah. Yeah, and my dad.

538
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:12,941
I miss her.

539
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:15,499
I'm sorry.

540
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,400
No, don't be.

541
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,703
I live with my foster dad,
but now he's getting old,

542
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,372
so it's more like
I'm looking after him.

543
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,141
Yeah. I know how that feels.

544
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:27,178
I had to look after my mom
when she got sick.

545
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,214
It might seem tough now,
but once they're gone,

546
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,462
you'll miss having
someone to care for.

547
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,599
I don't have much to
keep me here anymore.

548
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:39,401
You don't?

549
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:43,794
You know,

550
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:48,265
mmm, we could get together some
other time, some other place?

551
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:52,336
Oh, you mean, uh, somewhere that's
not a diner or a laundromat?

552
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,639
Yeah, well, it's not that
this isn't nice but...

553
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:00,422
Oh, well,
we could go to, uh... um...

554
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:01,412
Oh, bacchanalia.

555
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,381
I've never been.
I... I hear it's nice.

556
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,983
Oh, it's... It's the
finest winin' and dinin'

557
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,519
of all the wines
and dines in town.

558
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,554
That is nice.

559
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,890
Um, but they got me pulling
doubles this week, though.

560
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,793
What about next week?
What's your schedule like?

561
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:16,527
I don't know.

562
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,196
Oh, I forgot.
They call, you go.

563
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,399
No, I mean, I'm...
I'm not working.

564
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,067
You're not driving anymore?

565
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,402
No.

566
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,636
I'm sorry.

567
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,471
No, don't be.
It's my choice.

568
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,985
Well, aren't you the lucky one.

569
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:49,538
So who's Debora?

570
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:51,740
The girl.

571
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,765
<i>His name, Malik Kelly,
a local veteran.</i>

572
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:59,937
<i>You saw what these folks were doing.
You took action. Why?</i>

573
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:00,671
I'm done.

574
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,175
<i>I saw these guys go marching in
the bank with Halloween masks,</i>

575
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,376
<i>weapons drawn.</i>

576
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,710
<i>They were attacking...</i>

577
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,557
<i>Is this the place?</i>

578
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:14,229
Here.

579
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:16,120
Pizza?

580
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,123
Are we celebrating?

581
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,958
Celebrating you getting

582
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,071
a real job.

583
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:25,696
What kind of job?

584
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:26,730
Wouldn't it be good

585
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,401
to bring joy to people

586
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:34,249
when you drive?

587
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:36,585
Pizza?

588
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,358
Order's up!

589
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:03,245
Whoa.

590
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:05,269
That was fast.

591
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:05,936
I know.

592
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,117
Pizza!

593
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:20,017
Look...

594
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,620
You only have to
wash your hands once

595
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,033
after counting that.

596
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:26,590
I know.

597
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,992
And not put

598
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,827
other lives

599
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:30,661
in danger.

600
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:35,377
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

601
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:37,301
I'm not talking

602
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:38,880
about me.

603
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,782
You're all good. A gentleman
picked this up already.

604
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,428
A gentleman?

605
00:44:27,463 --> 00:44:29,765
Who is that?

606
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:32,601
It's my old boss.

607
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:34,792
Uh...

608
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,272
Excuse me one second.

609
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:40,942
- Here you are, madam.
- Thank you very much.

610
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:43,145
Have a good night.

611
00:44:45,314 --> 00:44:46,103
Good meal, baby?

612
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,518
That FOIE Gras terrine
is something, huh?

613
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:50,274
Yeah.

614
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,709
You don't look
happy to see me. Why?

615
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:55,279
I said we were straight, but
did you think we were done?

616
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,981
That that was it?

617
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,282
Uh, I guess I did.

618
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,619
Well, I could give you the
good news and the bad news,

619
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,853
except there is no bad news.

620
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,289
The good news is you're about
to make a lot of money.

621
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,560
And the good news is you're
about to make a lot of money.

622
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,728
I got... I got a job, doc.

623
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,931
Yeah, but why slave away
delivering Goodfellas pizzas

624
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,799
just to afford a night out here,

625
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,669
when you could make all that
dough with a great fella? Me.

626
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,740
And then take your gal here for fucking
dinner every night of the week?

627
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,976
You paid off your debt.
Now it's time to profit.

628
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,111
This is the fun bit, baby.

629
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,313
By the time this job is over,
you'll be rolling in money,

630
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:34,518
buying maseratis and feeding
your gal catfish dipped in gold.

631
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,732
So, what do you say?
You in?

632
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:38,489
Am I in?

633
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,758
No, don't answer my question
with another question.

634
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,272
You give me one of
two replies. Yes or no.

635
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:47,297
No, doc.

636
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:51,835
You know I never do a job with the
exact same crew twice, right?

637
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:52,803
Yes.
And you also know

638
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:56,551
you've been my driver
for every job since we met.

639
00:45:57,053 --> 00:45:58,787
Yes.

640
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:03,013
So, I'm of the thinking
that you are my lucky charm

641
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,583
and that I'm not doing
this job without you.

642
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,352
Now, I don't think I need
to give you the speech

643
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,586
about what happens
when you say no,

644
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,655
how I could break your legs
and kill everyone you love,

645
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,469
because you already
know that, don't you?

646
00:46:15,638 --> 00:46:17,027
Yeah.

647
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,295
So, what's it gonna be,

648
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,309
behind the wheel
or in a wheelchair?

649
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:23,311
The first one.

650
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,982
I'll pick you up in the morning.

651
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,606
Don't stay out too late, now.

652
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:30,274
Oh.

653
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:34,445
And your, uh, waitress
girlfriend, she's cute.

654
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,613
Let's keep it that way.

655
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,161
Good night, sir.

656
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:45,289
<i>Well, that was some pretty
fine winin' and dinin'.</i>

657
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,026
Must have friends in high
places to get a table there.

658
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,907
Oh, I don't know about that.

659
00:46:53,609 --> 00:46:56,344
Is everything okay, baby?

660
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:00,137
It will be.

661
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:04,208
You want to talk about it?
I make a mean cup of coffee.

662
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:08,857
I mean, I... I don't.
I make terrible coffee.

663
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:11,248
I want to, but I...

664
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,916
I can't right now.

665
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,018
You know, you...

666
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:18,188
You don't have
to worry about me.

667
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,790
You can tell me anything.

668
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,425
I'm not worried about you.

669
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,160
I mean, I...

670
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,564
You're the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

671
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:34,282
And I just worry that
I'm not good enough for you.

672
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,053
Oh, well, don't.

673
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:44,693
I can see you're kind
and you're different.

674
00:47:45,428 --> 00:47:48,997
And I'm here for you
when you're ready.

675
00:48:00,576 --> 00:48:02,677
What are you doing tomorrow?

676
00:48:04,747 --> 00:48:06,781
Uh, you tell me.

677
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:31,439
Good morning.

678
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:34,565
These places never get rolled.

679
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,801
People don't realize that there's
gold in them there hills.

680
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,903
And those that do,
don't have the stones

681
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,972
to pull off a job so
public in the hub of it.

682
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:44,007
This place'll be ripe
around this time tomorrow,

683
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,143
but I need you to do
something for me today.

684
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,779
I can't be seen in there,
but you can.

685
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:49,680
So go inside.

686
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,416
Take note of the number
of cameras and positions,

687
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,750
the number of registers open,

688
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,653
the number of employees
and the number of customers.

689
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,655
Is there a guard?
Is he armed?

690
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,424
Do they have bandit glass?

691
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,459
And get in line,
buy some stamps.

692
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:05,829
Take your buds out,
pull your shades off.

693
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:10,445
Oh, and, uh, take the nephew.
Less suspicious.

694
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,872
<i>The United States
postal service.</i>

695
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,308
<i>We're here, working for you,
seven days a week.</i>

696
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,211
<i>We do a lot more
than just stamps these days.</i>

697
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,114
<i>You'd be surprised at
what we have to offer.</i>

698
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:27,562
<i>Yeah, Jack, all looks
fine back here. Over.</i>

699
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:45,035
No bandit glass,
one armed guard,

700
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,505
10 cameras,
eight registers, two open,

701
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,342
11 customers and four employees.

702
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,589
Thank you.

703
00:49:57,593 --> 00:49:58,882
Uh...

704
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:00,929
Uh, stamps.

705
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:04,132
That your boy?

706
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,656
Sure.

707
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,090
Yeah, he sure is.

708
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,670
How old is he?

709
00:50:09,705 --> 00:50:11,428
Four.
Eight.

710
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,642
They grow up so
freaking fast, don't they?

711
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,513
Does he have a name?

712
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:20,938
You have a name, don't you?

713
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:21,672
Samm.

714
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,541
Well, Samm, I got a mint
with your name on it.

715
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,844
You have a mint
that says "Samm"?

716
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,079
Aw.

717
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,881
Sweet.

718
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:31,882
Are you here tomorrow?

719
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:35,530
Sure am. Working 9:00
to 5:00, just like Dolly.

720
00:50:35,898 --> 00:50:38,488
Oh, Dolly Parton. Yeah.

721
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,357
I like her.
Mmm, who doesn't?

722
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,326
"Everybody wants happiness,
nobody wants pain.

723
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:45,762
"But you can't have a rainbow
without a little rain."

724
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,742
Wise lady.

725
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,600
Yeah, she sure is.
Hmm.

726
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,414
Bye.

727
00:51:01,524 --> 00:51:02,991
Hit me.

728
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:06,283
No bandit glass,
one armed guard,

729
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:10,465
10 cameras,
eight registers, three open.

730
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,668
And, uh, 11 customers.

731
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,262
And, uh, four employees.

732
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,109
Anything else?

733
00:51:21,444 --> 00:51:23,033
The teller seemed nice.

734
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,501
She gave me a mint.

735
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,502
Did she?
Yeah.

736
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,971
You probably wouldn't even
need to use a gun with her.

737
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:32,720
Just say "boo," and she'll
give you the big bills first.

738
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:35,056
Chip's off the old block.

739
00:51:43,966 --> 00:51:46,134
What floor are you on?

740
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:47,624
Third.

741
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:51,539
Those stairs must be a
real bitch for Joe, huh?

742
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:54,431
It's my business
to know everything.

743
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,600
So, are they a bitch?

744
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,780
There's an elevator.

745
00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:02,784
Ooh, fancy.

746
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,387
So, am I gonna see you tonight?

747
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:08,245
Yes, you will.

748
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,514
You're not just saying what you
think I want to hear, right?

749
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:14,162
You consider me a friend,
don't you?

750
00:52:14,763 --> 00:52:15,685
You and I are a team.

751
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:19,267
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

752
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:20,590
Good to know.

753
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,193
You'll be out of
this shithole soon.

754
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:26,774
You're going up in the world!

755
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:37,474
Bo's diner, what'll you have?

756
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,409
<i>Is Debora there?</i>

757
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,356
Debbie, phone.

758
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:43,424
Keep it short.

759
00:52:44,093 --> 00:52:45,715
Hello?
<i>It's baby.</i>

760
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,697
Hey. To what do
I owe this honor?

761
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:52,456
<i>I just wanted to
hear your voice.</i>

762
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,624
Am I still seeing you later?

763
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,293
<i>I have to drive again.</i>

764
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,930
Oh, okay. Thought
y'all were done with that.

765
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:04,534
<i>So did I.
It's not what I want.</i>

766
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,315
And what do you want, baby?

767
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,907
I want us to head west on 20,

768
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,677
in a car we can't afford,

769
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,424
with a plan we don't have.

770
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,028
Keep driving and never stop.

771
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:21,785
Are you serious?

772
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,865
<i>I am, Debora.</i>

773
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,756
You in?

774
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,703
I'm in, baby.

775
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:30,205
<i>See you soon.</i>

776
00:53:48,591 --> 00:53:50,191
There he is.

777
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:52,349
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.

778
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,783
Hear-no-evil's back, huh?

779
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,353
Have you seen this kid move?
Yeah, I've seen him.

780
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,754
Think doc likes
having him around

781
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,223
because he can park in the
disabled spots by the bank.

782
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:01,691
- Disabled spot?
- Yeah.

783
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,361
He got some shit wrong with his ears.
Tinnitus or something.

784
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,197
Anyway, he gotta listen
to music 24 hours a day

785
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,432
to drown out
the whining in his ears.

786
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,534
Oh, shit!

787
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,602
You know who else has
the exact same thing

788
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,572
and does that exact same thing?

789
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:16,406
Barbra Streisand.

790
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,074
Darling, do I look like
I know a fucking thing

791
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:19,442
about Barbra fucking Streisand?

792
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:22,979
Hey! Watch your mouth. That's
my lady you're talking to.

793
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,659
Yeah.

794
00:54:25,461 --> 00:54:26,650
Watch your mouth.

795
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,297
I'll watch what I want to watch.

796
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:35,025
Is that true?

797
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,394
Is that why you have music
in your head all the time?

798
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,795
Drown out the noise?

799
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:39,696
Yeah.

800
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,131
It keeps me moving.

801
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,466
It's an escape. I get it.

802
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:47,470
Hey, buddy, you seen a violin?
I had a violin here.

803
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,584
Shut up.

804
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:52,175
I used to fool around with
cars when I was a kid.

805
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:55,979
Drive around all night like a speed
freak listening to the radio.

806
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,782
I used to have my special tape

807
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:01,851
that had my killer
track on it. Get me flying.

808
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,520
You got one of those?

809
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,266
Sure.

810
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:06,990
Well, what is it?

811
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,025
<i>Brighton rock.</i>
What?

812
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,672
Queen?

813
00:55:10,873 --> 00:55:12,128
Yeah.

814
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,231
It's got that
crazy big guitar solo.

815
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,131
Yeah, I know that song.

816
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,900
My brother used to
play<i> sheer heart attack</i>

817
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,835
right through the wall.

818
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,303
You got it on here?

819
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,305
Uh, I got it on this one.

820
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,853
Play it.
Let's hear that killer track.

821
00:55:34,863 --> 00:55:37,131
Yeah.

822
00:55:43,238 --> 00:55:45,028
What you ladies listening to?

823
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,062
Queen.
Queen!

824
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,832
Queen? Streisand, now queen. What the fuck?
What y'all gonna do?

825
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,301
Y'all gonna belt out show
tunes on the way to the job?

826
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,236
You don't need
a score for a score.

827
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:54,704
You just...

828
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:59,109
Put your fucking foot on the
gas and drive the goddamn car.

829
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,311
That's all
the music you need, folks.

830
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,912
Come on, now.

831
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:06,549
You never been a wheelman?
You never had a lucky song?

832
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:11,021
Well, a cigarette song.
<i>Apres-</i> heist, glass of scotch.

833
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,022
Absolutely.

834
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,890
But not before a job.

835
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,827
I got enough demons right here
playing music all the time.

836
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:18,995
Yeah, well, that I believe.

837
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,830
Had a buddy once walk away from a job.
You know why?

838
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,233
Because something was playing
on the radio he didn't like.

839
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:26,303
We about to go in, he won't
get out the fucking car. Why?

840
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,338
'Cause<i> knock, knock,</i>
<i>knockin' on heaven's door</i>

841
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:32,008
is playing on the Fm.
He called it a hex song.

842
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,377
That,<i> end of the road</i>
by Boyz ii men,

843
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,112
<i>hotel California</i> by the eagles.

844
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,314
He called 'em all hex songs.

845
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,717
Then come talking about some crazy
shit like we all gonna die.

846
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:41,985
So what?
You bail on the job?

847
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,720
Fuck no,
I didn't bail on the job.

848
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,388
I went and got that money.

849
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,324
And we didn't die, either.

850
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,359
Now, he bought it
a little later,

851
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:51,428
but it had nothing
to do with the heist.

852
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,642
Do all your stories end up
with somebody dying?

853
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:58,913
I guess you just
got to find out, huh?

854
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,006
I need four pairs of eyes
and three sets of ears.

855
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,052
Gather round.

856
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,920
The postal service is dying.

857
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,389
People don't care
about their mail anymore.

858
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:23,938
Lucky for us,
their loss is our gain.

859
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,495
Money orders.

860
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:28,498
For I happen to know a guy
who has a machine

861
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:31,501
that can turn
blank ones into green.

862
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,004
Each box contains
250 slips per box,

863
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,973
each slip worth up to a grand.

864
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,642
That's quarter a mil per box.

865
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,711
Dot, dot, dot.
You do the math.

866
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,046
Darling goes in the front.

867
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,116
Buddy takes a five-alligator
count and follows her inside.

868
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:52,021
You put on these privacy glasses
to blind the CCTV camera.

869
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,523
Another five-alligator count.

870
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,393
Darling gets in line,
buddy takes her hostage,

871
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,327
shotgun to her head.

872
00:57:57,407 --> 00:58:00,441
That gets you guys
in the back office.

873
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:03,566
We role-play that a lot.

874
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,300
Uh-huh.

875
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,802
Baby drives bats
around the loading dock.

876
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:10,373
Bats uses this security card supplied
by an insider with a nasal problem

877
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,409
to get in the staff entrance
and cover the rear.

878
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,578
You guys grab all the boxes
and then sneak out the back

879
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,125
to baby and the waiting car.

880
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:22,852
Did you get all that, baby?

881
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:23,853
Yeah.

882
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,988
Okay, one more thing.

883
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:28,958
We need some fresh hardware, not
traceable to us or any previous jobs.

884
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:33,196
Now, I've got some contacts who
can get us some clean firepower,

885
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,297
so the pickup is tonight.

886
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,065
But after the pickup,
you come straight back here.

887
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:39,903
You all have an early start in the
morning, and there's eyes everywhere.

888
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:43,551
So, you're staying
the night here.

889
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:47,054
Oh, we in bed together now.

890
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,750
Pull over there.
I got to take a leak.

891
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:19,909
Want some gum?
Want some gum, buddy?

892
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,557
Yeah, I'll take some gum.

893
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,350
Tell me what we're gonna do
with all that money.

894
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,386
We're gonna go to Vegas.
We'll put it all on red.

895
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,356
We'll get married again.
It'll be real romantic.

896
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,325
Mmm.

897
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,361
You know what was real,
real romantic?

898
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:41,097
What was real, real romantic?

899
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:42,999
When you stabbed that guy.

900
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,167
Which guy?

901
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,536
The guy that robbed you, the
guy that called you a whore,

902
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,638
or the guy that
looked at you funny?

903
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:49,906
The last one.

904
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:52,475
Yeah. I do remember that.

905
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:55,156
Bats just looked at me funny.

906
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,116
You want me to kill bats?

907
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:03,431
Not before the job, silly.
Hmm?

908
01:00:04,066 --> 01:00:06,801
You think we should talk
about this in front of baby?

909
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:11,038
He won't say a thing.
Will you, baby? Hmm?

910
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:15,265
Jesus Christ.

911
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:16,499
What, did you steal all this?

912
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:17,767
You said you wanted some gum.

913
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:21,649
Fuck I'm supposed to do, pay for it?
Let's go.

914
01:00:22,618 --> 01:00:24,485
Let's go.

915
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,817
Looks like
the farmers' market is open.

916
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:35,919
Farmers' market?

917
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:39,834
Yeah. Doc says
we got to go see the butcher.

918
01:01:15,737 --> 01:01:17,894
Come on,
you're going in with us.

919
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,808
We might not be leaving in this.

920
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:29,005
And, uh, find
something funky on there.

921
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:32,520
Just in case we got
to rip this joint up.

922
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:35,578
Take this.

923
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:37,447
Act like you know how to use it.

924
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,681
Why would he need it?

925
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,516
Got to swagger in
like you got one,

926
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:43,019
so we don't all look
like a bunch of pussies.

927
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,131
Darling excluded.

928
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:49,892
What's with the earbuds?
Recording this or something?

929
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:50,793
It's just his music.

930
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,574
Yeah, he's loony.
He's just like his tunes.

931
01:01:53,942 --> 01:01:55,164
What's he listening to?

932
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,100
How the fuck I know?

933
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,180
Let me check.

934
01:02:02,517 --> 01:02:03,573
<i>Tequila!</i>

935
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:04,540
Which reminds me,

936
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:07,210
why'd the Mexican dude
throw his wife off the cliff?

937
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:10,524
Ah! Ruined it.
Didn't I ruin it?

938
01:02:10,759 --> 01:02:11,881
We met before, right?

939
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,484
I don't know.
You still alive, right?

940
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,084
Uh-huh.

941
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,164
Then I guess we ain't never met.

942
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,355
Shut the fuck up!

943
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:22,603
I've got it.
I've got it.

944
01:02:24,372 --> 01:02:25,461
<i>Voila!</i>

945
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:29,009
Welcome to<i> la Charcuterie.</i>

946
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,502
Tonight, gentlemen,<i> madame,</i>

947
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,737
we have only
the finest cuts of pork,

948
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,306
direct from
the local smokehouse.

949
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,008
You're all experienced
butchers yourself.

950
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,011
I assume you are aware that
the humble pig can be cooked

951
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:45,882
from nose to tail,
everything but the squeal.

952
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,850
I can offer you nine cuts

953
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,720
at the best prices
in all of Christendom.

954
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,121
So let's dive in
head-first.

955
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:57,026
From the jowl comes the godsent
Roman bacon that is Guanciale.

956
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,562
From the shoulder
of the hog comes

957
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:02,498
the Boston butt,
a tough but tasty cut.

958
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:03,866
The picnic shoulder
is a favorite

959
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:07,470
of those who enjoy
the smoking of pigs.

960
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,573
The center-cut loin,
the double-cut pork chops,

961
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:11,274
baby back ribs,

962
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:14,944
and the Serrano ham,
on the back leg, of course.

963
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:16,512
All delicious.

964
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:17,380
Delicious.

965
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,451
And, of course, we have a
fine selection of sausages.

966
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:22,785
Well, I'm hungry.

967
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,287
<i>Fantastique.</i>

968
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,488
And your choice is...

969
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,791
Well, I'm gonna go
with the picnic shoulder,

970
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,938
'cause, um, I just
love smoking pigs.

971
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:06,207
Done deal.

972
01:04:07,609 --> 01:04:09,198
Dumb son of a bitch.

973
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:10,633
Whoa! Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

974
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,401
Fuck, bats!
You got my wife shot!

975
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:13,269
I don't like that!

976
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,670
Relax, buddy.
You handled it!

977
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,140
What the fuck, you piece of shit?
You shot the gunsmiths.

978
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,975
Weren't they
fucking doc's contacts?

979
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,443
They were doc's contacts!

980
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,711
Guess what, they was pigs.

981
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,146
Look at the box.
It says "APD."

982
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:24,547
I clocked that
tall strip of bacon

983
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:27,917
with that fake-ass Louis
Vuitton hat right off the bat.

984
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,018
He busted me in '98.

985
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:31,721
Now, I don't know about you
lovebirds fucking without a condom,

986
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,890
but when somebody getting
ready to barbecue me,

987
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,124
I go full-metal
batshit on...

988
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,325
- Shit!
- Get him!

989
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,127
Baby, don't let him get away!
Get him! Get him!

990
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,296
Do something!
Get him!

991
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,009
Oh, shit!

992
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:52,341
Get us out of here, baby.
Let's move.

993
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,022
Come on, let's go. Move.

994
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,342
Bats, you are fucking crazy.

995
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,111
When your folks name you bats,
you gonna end up crazy.

996
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:32,148
I don't doubt you're crazy,
but your real name

997
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,449
is not bats.

998
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:34,317
So says you.

999
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,152
You think my real
name's darling?

1000
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:39,422
Yeah, or buddy?
No, they're nicknames.

1001
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:41,568
Code names, monikers.

1002
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:44,827
So, what's your
real name, darling?

1003
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:45,928
Monica.

1004
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:49,232
Hey, I thought we weren't
allowed to discuss names.

1005
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,766
We're not.

1006
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:53,147
Baby, what's your real name?

1007
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,983
Huh?

1008
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:58,908
Hey, stop, stop, stop up here.

1009
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,988
Stop up here.

1010
01:06:01,656 --> 01:06:03,958
I said stop. I'm hungry.

1011
01:06:04,526 --> 01:06:05,615
No.

1012
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,428
Stop the car!

1013
01:06:10,598 --> 01:06:11,754
No?

1014
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,968
You're telling me no?

1015
01:06:14,235 --> 01:06:15,558
I don't want to go in there.

1016
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,905
"I don't want to
go in there."

1017
01:06:18,406 --> 01:06:19,428
Well, hello, baby.

1018
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:21,998
Bodies hit the floor back
there, you don't say shit.

1019
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,332
Now all of a sudden,
you getting...

1020
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:26,080
You getting riled up
about stopping at a diner?

1021
01:06:26,448 --> 01:06:28,004
I don't want to go in there.
It sucks.

1022
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:33,020
Well, with that recommendation,
we gots to go in now.

1023
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:04,674
<i>Now, why y'all so mad? You
should be thanking ol' bats.</i>

1024
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,575
For being a walking
fucking death wish?

1025
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,544
Well, I treat all of my
jobs like it's my last.

1026
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:10,980
Yeah, but what you do within
this group affects all of us.

1027
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,862
Fine, cowboy. You're gonna get
your money tomorrow. Plus, uh...

1028
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,720
I know you guys
got noses to feed.

1029
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,021
What, yeah,
like you're Mr. clean.

1030
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,568
I'm Mr. whatever
the fuck I wanna be.

1031
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:23,693
Can I get you anything to drink?

1032
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,928
Uh, yeah, I think it'll be,
uh, coke all around, right?

1033
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,230
How... how you say it
in your language? Coca?

1034
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:31,200
So let me get three
cokes and one Coca.

1035
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,547
Four cokes?
Yeah.

1036
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:37,306
Look, here's the deal.

1037
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,208
You rob to support a drug habit.

1038
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,310
I do drugs to
support a robbery habit.

1039
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,412
That's clever.
That's my job, see.

1040
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,247
It's you two who's on vacation.

1041
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,416
So you doubt our credentials?

1042
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,318
Wall street, right?
Doc tell you that?

1043
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,565
Doc ain't tell me shit.

1044
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,558
Just a educated guess
from an uneducated man.

1045
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:58,861
Well, bats, I would be fascinated to
hear your thoughts on the matter.

1046
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:00,062
Tell me if I'm way off, buddy.

1047
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:04,912
You were a stockbroker. Maybe
a different wife, maybe kids.

1048
01:08:05,213 --> 01:08:06,736
You stack your paper,
but you say shit like,

1049
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:08,771
"work hard, play harder," but
you play a little too hard.

1050
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:13,476
You rack up debt, the type of debt
that'd make a white man blush.

1051
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:14,910
Maybe you get into
a little trouble.

1052
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,812
Maybe you get your hand caught
in the corporate cookie jar.

1053
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:18,314
Maybe you leave and
run off to the desert.

1054
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:19,949
Maybe with your
favorite lap dancer in tow.

1055
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,518
Maybe you disappear into a world
consisting of three things,

1056
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:27,034
money, sex, drugs and action.

1057
01:08:28,536 --> 01:08:30,704
Oh, shit, that's four.

1058
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,474
Am I close?

1059
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:35,331
This how I look at it.

1060
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,833
You guys just think
this is a trip.

1061
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:39,602
Either way,
if you are wall street,

1062
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:43,317
you're a bigger fucking crook
than I could ever be.

1063
01:08:46,121 --> 01:08:50,457
I'm gonna go right ahead
and speak for the two of us.

1064
01:08:54,429 --> 01:08:57,586
You think you know us?
You don't.

1065
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:58,287
Mmm.

1066
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:01,768
You think you're
the last word in crazy?

1067
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:04,260
You're not.

1068
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,328
And believe me when I tell you,

1069
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,498
you don't want to
see my buddy mad.

1070
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:13,335
You haven't seen
how relentless he is.

1071
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:14,770
Because when he sees red,

1072
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:20,087
you will see nothing but black.

1073
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,082
You hear that, speedy? That's
some Oscar shit right there.

1074
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,684
That was nice.
Did you rehearse that?

1075
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:29,585
You see this shit, baby?

1076
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:35,302
See, now this is a prime example
of a man who loves a woman.

1077
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,704
You guys are
perfect for each other.

1078
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,307
I mean that.

1079
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:46,213
Well, what can I get you to eat?

1080
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:48,204
Get these cats some happy meals,

1081
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,840
and, uh, I'm gonna
take care of the bill,

1082
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,576
uh, "Debora."

1083
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,679
Yo, my friend here, he, uh...
he doesn't like this place,

1084
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:59,582
but I think this place
kind of nice, you know?

1085
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,728
So let me ask you something,
Debora.

1086
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,869
What's his problem?

1087
01:10:09,437 --> 01:10:13,762
Uh, maybe your friend would like
to fill out a suggestion slip.

1088
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:16,543
Tell us how to
improve our service.

1089
01:10:24,886 --> 01:10:26,820
Baby, you know that bitch?

1090
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:29,512
No.

1091
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,514
Okay.

1092
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,160
Let's bounce.

1093
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:35,028
I got this.

1094
01:10:35,363 --> 01:10:37,553
What the fuck is your problem?

1095
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:38,633
Hmm?

1096
01:10:46,441 --> 01:10:48,264
Okay.

1097
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:51,445
Well, make sure you
tip the nice lady.

1098
01:11:43,965 --> 01:11:45,399
Bananas.

1099
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:47,523
"Bananas" is a code word.

1100
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:48,924
Whenever a deal is done
with one of my clients,

1101
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:52,428
they call me on the phone and
they say the word "bananas,"

1102
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,940
and then they hang up.

1103
01:11:55,244 --> 01:12:00,035
I did not hear
the word "bananas" tonight.

1104
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,238
So you tell me who died.

1105
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,173
Well, your contacts
was cops, doc.

1106
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:06,809
I know. They were my cops.

1107
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:09,278
Yeah, well, they fired first.

1108
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:10,813
And I'm not gonna
take a bullet for you

1109
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,248
or nobody else
in this motherfucker.

1110
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,629
Is that true?
They fired first?

1111
01:12:17,231 --> 01:12:18,699
Yeah.

1112
01:12:29,077 --> 01:12:29,732
Baby?

1113
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,567
Ask somebody on
the planet earth.

1114
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:34,881
I will ask
whoever the fuck I want.

1115
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:36,839
Go home, job's off.

1116
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:38,641
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
No. What the fuck?

1117
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:42,511
We are 24 hours from being descended
upon by this entire city.

1118
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:43,746
Those pigs are in hog heaven.

1119
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:45,748
The only way they can ID us is
with a Ouija board or some shit.

1120
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,917
Well, your name only takes
four letters to spell out.

1121
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:52,132
Doc, bats ain't
my real fucking name.

1122
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:55,869
It's over, Leon.

1123
01:12:56,637 --> 01:12:58,839
Get out of town.

1124
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,763
Wow.

1125
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:02,598
Well, I ain't running, doc.

1126
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:06,402
I say we drive into the storm.
Ride the hurricane.

1127
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,137
We could be on
a non-extradition beach,

1128
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,505
drinking
non-extradition cocktails,

1129
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:12,775
counting our non-extradition
cash in 23 hours.

1130
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:14,877
And who do we get
to fence those money orders

1131
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,212
since you shot the fence?

1132
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,314
Buddy got a guy.

1133
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:21,050
I mean, I'm just taking a wild
guess here, but buddy got a guy.

1134
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,430
Ain't that right, wall street?

1135
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,588
Yeah, I got a guy.

1136
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:29,035
So let's fucking do this.

1137
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:30,259
I only hear three voices,

1138
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:33,629
and the last time I checked,
there's four in a car.

1139
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,230
Baby? Your call.

1140
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:36,832
Time to make
a big-boy decision.

1141
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,667
Do we do this thing or not?

1142
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,769
He's outvoted.
We doing it.

1143
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,049
Let him speak.

1144
01:13:43,584 --> 01:13:45,507
I say we all get some sleep.

1145
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,121
Get ready for
this fucking thing.

1146
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,197
<i>Baby? Your call.</i>

1147
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,765
<i>Time to make
a big-boy decision.</i>

1148
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,900
<i>Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1149
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,769
<i>Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1150
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:15,371
<i>Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1151
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:19,986
<i>Do we do this thing or not?
Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1152
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:26,553
Where you going, baby?

1153
01:15:27,755 --> 01:15:29,656
Uh, coffee.

1154
01:15:30,157 --> 01:15:32,014
At 2:00 A.M.?

1155
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:34,249
That doesn't sound smart.

1156
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:36,118
You fucking kidding me?
I got enough on my plate,

1157
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,400
worrying about bats, I got to
worry about you, too, now?

1158
01:15:40,735 --> 01:15:41,924
You know what?
Do me a favor.

1159
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:44,660
If you're gonna mail it in
at the post office tomorrow,

1160
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:50,577
then go on your little caffeine
run and don't come back.

1161
01:15:51,746 --> 01:15:53,135
If you're just in
this for the buzz,

1162
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,939
if driving is just some kind
of escape for you, then go.

1163
01:15:57,019 --> 01:16:01,410
What y'all doing in here?
Huh?

1164
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,979
Just making sure everything's
ready for tomorrow.

1165
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:04,913
Oh, yeah.

1166
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:09,396
Well, uh, look like he's going
somewhere at 2:00 in the morning.

1167
01:16:10,498 --> 01:16:13,133
Are you?
No.

1168
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:16,603
Good. That's good.

1169
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:21,074
'Cause we got to discuss this.

1170
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:23,643
No, no, it's the same one.

1171
01:16:24,812 --> 01:16:26,235
<i>Baby? Your call.</i>

1172
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,504
<i>Time to make
a big-boy decision.</i>

1173
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,738
<i>Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1174
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:32,741
Now, why you
want to go and do that?

1175
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:36,122
It's just me fooling around.
I like to record stuff.

1176
01:16:36,824 --> 01:16:39,414
Why you like to record stuff?

1177
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:41,316
You the police?

1178
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,418
Supposed to squeal on the
road, not to the cops.

1179
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:44,653
Speak up, baby.

1180
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:46,321
I... I like to listen
back to conversations.

1181
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:52,027
I make music out of the words, songs,
mixes. It's just something I do.

1182
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,396
That's one
fucking dumbass excuse.

1183
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:57,666
To be fair, even the cops
couldn't come up with an excuse

1184
01:16:57,746 --> 01:16:58,634
that fucking dumbass.

1185
01:16:58,714 --> 01:16:59,968
Now can you play us
one of your mixes?

1186
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:01,904
I can't, they're... They're just...
They're at home.

1187
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:06,441
Well, it looks like we're all going
somewhere at 2:00 in the morning, then.

1188
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:07,676
Come on.

1189
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:09,956
I live really far away.

1190
01:17:10,891 --> 01:17:12,258
No, you don't.

1191
01:17:14,795 --> 01:17:17,019
Wake up, baby.

1192
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:18,832
Time to explain.

1193
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:26,595
Joe.

1194
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,163
Where is he?
What did you do to him?

1195
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:29,976
Oh, the cripple?

1196
01:17:30,344 --> 01:17:32,467
Oh, don't worry about him.

1197
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:35,337
He's good.
He ain't going nowhere.

1198
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:38,485
Why don't you play us
something, baby?

1199
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:09,082
This shit is bananas, doc.

1200
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:12,719
B-a-n-a-n-a-s.

1201
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:21,183
<i>Hello? Hello, testing.</i>

1202
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:24,519
<i>It's Debbie. Debora.</i>

1203
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:26,989
<i>Yeah, except I'm d-e-b-o-r-a.</i>

1204
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:30,904
"Debora." Isn't that the
waitress from the diner?

1205
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:33,662
You said you
didn't know that bitch.

1206
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:35,864
Why would you say
you didn't know her?

1207
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:38,567
Have you been
talking to Debora about us?

1208
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:39,801
I don't say nothing.

1209
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:40,869
What about wheels?

1210
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:41,970
He can't say nothing.

1211
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,473
Yeah, but he can read motherfucking
lips, though, can't he?

1212
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,608
Take this fool
back to his shithole.

1213
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,176
I'll find another
driver for tomorrow.

1214
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:51,246
Doc, I'm available. I can take
him where he needs to go,

1215
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:52,147
get him home safe.

1216
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,282
No, you're not
getting a new driver.

1217
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,318
I've been on every job
since we met.

1218
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:59,154
I don't squeal to the cops,
I squeal on the road.

1219
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,568
And I'm not slow, I'm fast.

1220
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:05,694
I'm your driver tomorrow.

1221
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:07,674
I'm driving.

1222
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:14,714
Well, you heard the kid.
He's driving.

1223
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,220
I'll tell him.

1224
01:19:22,056 --> 01:19:23,445
<i>The Atlanta region is under</i>

1225
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:24,946
<i>a light, scattered

01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:05,860
No. I'm coming with you.

1402
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,762
- He just shot a guy!
- Who?

1403
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:09,375
Him!

1404
01:34:10,043 --> 01:34:11,599
Atlanta police department!

1405
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,668
You on the ground, are you okay?

1406
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:15,903
Can you show me
where you've been shot?

1407
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:17,683
Yeah.

1408
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:19,974
Right there.

1409
01:34:20,054 --> 01:34:21,909
<i>Officer down.
Shots fired.</i>

1410
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:24,245
<i>I repeat,
shots fired at Bo's diner.</i>

1411
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:27,548
<i>Unit 412 currently on scene,
requesting backup.</i>

1412
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:29,050
<i>Possible female hostage.</i>

1413
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:31,463
<i>All units in the vicinity
respond immediately...</i>

1414
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,921
<i>Who's this?</i>

1415
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:34,956
It's baby.

1416
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:36,457
<i>Like I said, who's this?</i>

1417
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:37,391
I need your help.

1418
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:39,204
<i>I'm afraid this line is dead.</i>

1419
01:34:42,742 --> 01:34:45,666
Baby, we need
to get out of here.

1420
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:47,168
I just need one thing first.

1421
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:50,404
And then it's just us,
music and the road.

1422
01:34:50,484 --> 01:34:53,218
But we don't have a car.
Or music.

1423
01:34:58,992 --> 01:35:00,659
Yeah, we do.

1424
01:35:02,395 --> 01:35:03,517
Get out.

1425
01:35:03,597 --> 01:35:05,152
Check out Bonnie and Clyde, yo.

1426
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:07,188
More like Bonnie and Bonnie.

1427
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:08,456
Get out of the car.

1428
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,002
You holding?

1429
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:12,871
You ever shot
a gun before, homie?

1430
01:35:13,006 --> 01:35:13,995
I just did.

1431
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:16,075
Literally five minutes ago.

1432
01:35:26,886 --> 01:35:29,510
Can I at least get
my goddamn phone?

1433
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:30,590
No.

1434
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:06,792
Not a chauffeur. Noted.

1435
01:36:17,303 --> 01:36:19,938
It's over, kid.
I ain't open.

1436
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:22,396
I need those tapes.

1437
01:36:22,476 --> 01:36:24,865
I'm not giving you those tapes.

1438
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:28,636
I have the money orders. I'll
trade you for one of those tapes.

1439
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:30,983
I can't help you, baby.

1440
01:36:32,418 --> 01:36:33,974
I shot buddy.
Congratulations.

1441
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:37,745
Then you only have every clean
and dirty cop after you.

1442
01:36:37,825 --> 01:36:39,591
You gonna shoot me, too?

1443
01:36:40,126 --> 01:36:41,849
Never.
You and I are a team. I...

1444
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:44,552
Don't feed me any more lines
from<i> monsters, inc.</i>

1445
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:45,953
It pisses me off.

1446
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:48,456
It's one of Samm's favorites.

1447
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:52,271
I thought it sounded
familiar, you little shit.

1448
01:36:55,208 --> 01:36:58,177
I'm not your
lucky charm anymore.

1449
01:36:58,511 --> 01:37:02,114
But I'm standing here
asking for your help.

1450
01:37:02,615 --> 01:37:04,839
There's nothing
I can do for you, kid.

1451
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:08,987
Why should I, after
what you've done to me?

1452
01:37:13,893 --> 01:37:16,795
It's okay. Let's go.

1453
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:19,765
Oh, god damn it.

1454
01:37:20,099 --> 01:37:21,922
Look at the two of you.

1455
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:25,137
Okay, go get your fucking tape.

1456
01:37:32,879 --> 01:37:36,537
It's going to take more than a
cassette to get you two out of this,

1457
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:38,606
because the news is all bad.

1458
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,775
Well, there is some good news.

1459
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,076
The good news is
you like driving,

1460
01:37:42,156 --> 01:37:46,280
because you can't take your foot
off the gas for the next 25 years.

1461
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,550
This should be enough
to get you across the border.

1462
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:50,851
From there, it's on you.

1463
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:53,354
Don't trust
anyone but each other,

1464
01:37:53,434 --> 01:37:55,500
and don't ever look back.

1465
01:37:58,004 --> 01:38:00,272
I was in love once.

1466
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:06,378
Bananas.
Run.

1467
01:38:17,056 --> 01:38:18,624
I thought...

1468
01:38:25,131 --> 01:38:28,533
I thought I told you to run.

1469
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:36,241
Go. I'll deal with the cops.

1470
01:38:36,509 --> 01:38:38,377
That's not the cops.

1471
01:38:39,479 --> 01:38:41,435
<i>Here it is, baby.</i>

1472
01:38:41,515 --> 01:38:43,782
Your killer track.

1473
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:48,086
Oh, fuck.

1474
01:39:04,204 --> 01:39:05,204
Move!

1475
01:39:26,993 --> 01:39:29,394
The bag! Get the bag!
Okay.

1476
01:40:15,508 --> 01:40:17,642
Fuck!

1477
01:40:18,444 --> 01:40:20,601
We're getting out.
We're getting out?

1478
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:22,547
I have to end this.

1479
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:37,396
Come on out now, baby.

1480
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,289
"Romeo, Romeo!

1481
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:45,937
<i>"Wherefore art thou Romeo?"</i>

1482
01:40:48,441 --> 01:40:50,709
Now!

1483
01:40:57,383 --> 01:40:59,206
Motherfucker!

1484
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:02,276
<i>Be on the lookout
for squad car 3204,</i>

1485
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:05,612
<i>believed to be stolen
by a Jason Van horn.</i>

1486
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:10,595
Show yourself, baby!
You fucking child!

1487
01:41:10,863 --> 01:41:11,819
Hey, you okay, buddy?

1488
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:14,521
<i>He is armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

1489
01:41:14,601 --> 01:41:16,123
Fuck! Jesus!
He shot me!

1490
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:19,538
Assistance!
Assistance, please!

1491
01:41:41,694 --> 01:41:43,595
Fuck you, buddy.

1492
01:41:55,108 --> 01:41:56,808
Shit, shit, shit!

1493
01:42:22,034 --> 01:42:23,090
Baby!

1494
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:24,892
You did good, kid.

1495
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:28,707
But you took something
away from me that I love.

1496
01:42:29,342 --> 01:42:31,543
You know I got to do the same.

1497
01:42:38,352 --> 01:42:41,319
I really wish
you could hear her scream.

1498
01:42:45,691 --> 01:42:48,393
Guess you'll just have to watch.

1499
01:43:26,232 --> 01:43:28,366
Baby.

1500
01:43:44,884 --> 01:43:46,340
What are you doing?

1501
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:50,388
Hitting the road.
Listening to music.

1502
01:43:50,823 --> 01:43:53,592
Is this really your mom?

1503
01:43:56,195 --> 01:43:58,152
Yeah.

1504
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:01,233
She has a beautiful voice.

1505
01:44:03,169 --> 01:44:05,437
I know.

1506
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:45,977
<i>This is an active scene.
Hold all positions.</i>

1507
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:20,178
You don't belong in this world.

1508
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:24,716
No.

1509
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:53,178
Hands behind your back!

1510
01:45:56,549 --> 01:45:57,804
Do not move!

1511
01:45:57,884 --> 01:45:59,651
I'm sorry.

1512
01:46:06,058 --> 01:46:09,694
Please, leave him alone!

1513
01:46:10,964 --> 01:46:16,590
<i>How would you describe your
relationship with the defendant?</i>

1514
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:17,591
<i>We were friends.</i>

1515
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:21,061
<i>And I think we both wanted
to be more than that.</i>

1516
01:46:21,141 --> 01:46:23,330
<i>He got himself into a bad spot.</i>

1517
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:25,365
<i>I was just
trying to get him out.</i>

1518
01:46:25,445 --> 01:46:28,135
I believe the defendant
is of good character.

1519
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:30,804
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

1520
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:33,340
<i>Was the strangest thing.</i>

1521
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:36,076
<i>He finally drove off,</i>

1522
01:46:36,156 --> 01:46:39,313
and he threw
my purse right at me.

1523
01:46:39,393 --> 01:46:42,382
<i>Then he actually said,
"I'm sorry."</i>

1524
01:46:42,462 --> 01:46:44,751
<i>He looked at me and
he shook his head,</i>

1525
01:46:44,831 --> 01:46:47,954
like he was warning me, somehow
telling me not to go inside.

1526
01:46:48,034 --> 01:46:51,625
<i>He looked concerned, like he
was, uh, trying to save me.</i>

1527
01:46:51,705 --> 01:46:54,561
<i>He made a mistake
when he was younger,</i>

1528
01:46:54,641 --> 01:46:56,463
<i>and it's haunted him ever since.</i>

1529
01:46:56,543 --> 01:47:00,367
<i>When he tried to get out,
he was pressured even harder.</i>

1530
01:47:00,447 --> 01:47:04,905
It was never his fault.
He's got a good heart.

1531
01:47:04,985 --> 01:47:08,075
<i>Always had. Always will.</i>

1532
01:47:08,155 --> 01:47:11,378
<i>With regard to
counts 1 through 19,</i>

1533
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:13,180
and count 21,

1534
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,215
I hereby sentence the defendant

1535
01:47:15,295 --> 01:47:17,417
to 25 years in
the federal penitentiary,

1536
01:47:17,497 --> 01:47:22,600
subject to a parole hearing
after five years served.

1537
01:47:36,849 --> 01:47:39,651
You got a letter, kid.

1538
01:47:42,154 --> 01:47:43,777
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

1539
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:44,811
<i>You know, it's funny.</i>

1540
01:47:44,891 --> 01:47:46,947
<i>Even though I heard it so
many times in the court case,</i>

1541
01:47:47,027 --> 01:47:53,453
<i>I still can't get used to the fact
that your real name is miles.</i>

1542
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:55,500
<i>It's a cool name, though.</i>

1543
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:58,525
<i>I can think of a lot
of great miles songs.</i>

1544
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:03,130
<i>But we still have to get through
all those baby songs first.</i>

1545
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:06,733
<i>I can't wait until
the day when it's just us,</i>

1546
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:10,181
<i>music and the road.</i>

1547
01:48:10,649 --> 01:48:12,472
<i>See you later, baby.</i>

1548
01:48:12,552 --> 01:48:15,753
<i>All my love, Debora.</i>

1549
01:51:54,741 --> 01:51:56,181
<i>He's a...
He's a... he's a good kid</i>
