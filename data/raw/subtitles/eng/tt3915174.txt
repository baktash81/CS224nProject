00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,033
- Mine!
- Mine!

711
00:36:38,116 --> 00:36:39,075
[both shriek]

712
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,620
[both hissing]

713
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:44,873
[both growl]

714
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:48,668
- [Puss exclaims]
- [coins clinking]

715
00:36:48,752 --> 00:36:50,962
[people exclaiming]

716
00:36:52,464 --> 00:36:53,882
[horse whinnies]

717
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:58,845
Good people, accept this golden gift
from Puss in Boots!

718
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:00,138
[cheering]

719
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:05,769
[whistling]

720
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,026
- Speed up! Go, go, go!
- [Perro screams]

721
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:19,991
Assemble the Baker's Dozen.

722
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:23,078
- Careful with this.
- [screams]

723
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:26,206
[Big Jack Horner]
I'll take this and that, oh, and these!

724
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:27,999
One of those, and I gotta take that.

725
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,960
Yes. Yes. No.

726
00:37:30,043 --> 00:37:31,253
Yes!

727
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:32,254
Oh, yeah!

728
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:35,340
[humming]

729
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:37,008
And all of these!

730
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:39,552
[laughing] This one is right.

731
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:41,805
[bowling pins clatter]

732
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,518
[shouts]

733
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:52,315
- [bakers shouting]
- [horse whinnies]

734
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:57,737
I'll get you, my kitties,
and your little dog too.

735
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,573
[panting]

736
00:38:02,993 --> 00:38:04,286
What?

737
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,122
This is blank. We've been ripped off!

738
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:08,498
Where is the…

739
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:11,668
Oh. Yeah.
I knew it was gonna do that.

740
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:14,588
"The Dark Forest is deep and far.

741
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:17,257
Within its bounds, you'll find the star."

742
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,262
Ugh. The Dark Forest?
No one goes into the Dark Forest.

743
00:38:22,345 --> 00:38:23,597
Or comes out.

744
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:26,725
"A single wish burns true and bright.

745
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:29,603
This map's the key, so hold on tight."

746
00:38:31,062 --> 00:38:32,564
[grunts, speaks Spanish]

747
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:33,940
You let go!

748
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:37,110
A stick? [chuckles]
What happened to your sword?

749
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:40,280
Got rid of it, you know.
Made things too easy.

750
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:41,573
I needed a challenge.

751
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,825
Yeah.
You looked pretty challenged back there.

752
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:47,078
[chuckles] There's no way
I'm letting you hold the map!

753
00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:49,748
Well, there's no way
I'm letting you hold the map!

754
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:50,832
I can hold it.

755
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,045
Yeah, right. What's your deal anyway?

756
00:38:55,128 --> 00:38:56,504
You run with the Chihuahua Gang?

757
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:57,881
I don't think so.

758
00:38:57,964 --> 00:38:58,965
I don't believe you.

759
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:02,093
That's okay.
As long as you believe in yourself.

760
00:39:02,177 --> 00:39:05,513
What? Is he deranged?

761
00:39:05,597 --> 00:39:07,265
- Yep.
- What's your name?

762
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:09,392
Oh. I've been called all kinds of things.

763
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:12,395
Dog. Bad Dog. Stupid Dog.
Hey You! You There!

764
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,147
Get Out! Leave It! Drop It!

765
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,482
Big Rat. Small Pig.

766
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:18,026
Rat Face. Butt Nugget. [bleep] for Brains.

767
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:19,903
You know, that sort of thing.

768
00:39:19,986 --> 00:39:22,364
But I've never had a name
that really stuck, you know?

769
00:39:22,948 --> 00:39:24,324
That belonged to me.

770
00:39:24,908 --> 00:39:25,742
Is he done?

771
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:26,785
And you are?

772
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:29,871
Softpaws. Kitty Softpaws.

773
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:32,457
Wow! Yeah. Now, that's a good name.

774
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,000
There's music in a name like that.

775
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:36,503
Kitty Softpaws.

776
00:39:36,586 --> 00:39:39,339
Nice try. Classic con.

777
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:40,423
No one's that dumb.

778
00:39:40,507 --> 00:39:41,925
No one's that nice.

779
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:43,051
I don't trust you.

780
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:45,553
Me neither. He cannot be trusted.

781
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:48,974
But I trust him more than I trust you.

782
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:52,185
[Puss]
Wow. This trip is going to be fun.

783
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:54,312
[horse whinnies]

784
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:28,513
This must be the Dark Forest.

785
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:33,560
[ominous laughter in distance]

786
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:41,818
- Oh, my God!
- It's gone!

787
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:43,278
It's back!

788
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:45,780
- [Kitty speaks Spanish]
- Nothing to worry about.

789
00:40:45,864 --> 00:40:47,490
[chuckles]

790
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:48,950
We step through as one.

791
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:51,995
Ready? One, two… After you.

792
00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:53,079
Wait, what?

793
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:56,249
[distorted exclaiming]

794
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,376
Dog? Still alive?

795
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,502
Let's go find out.

796
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:00,754
Wait!

797
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:04,299
[all screaming]

798
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:08,553
[Puss screaming]

799
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:10,055
Um… [clears throat]

800
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:11,348
[panting]

801
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:13,391
Whoa.

802
00:41:13,475 --> 00:41:14,517
Wow.

803
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:18,980
For a Dark Forest,
this place is pretty colorful.

804
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:21,107
I wish I had my quinceañera here.

805
00:41:21,191 --> 00:41:24,361
The Wishing Star is in here, somewhere.

806
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:27,197
Kitty, may I please see the map?

807
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,531
- No.
- Seriously?

808
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:30,951
You won't let me hold it
for even one minute?

809
00:41:31,034 --> 00:41:32,953
Nope. Not even for one second.

810
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:37,332
Come on, Kitty. You've got to trust me.

811
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,794
Wait. What... What's...
What's going on with his eyes?

812
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:43,088
Oh, they're getting bigger.

813
00:41:43,171 --> 00:41:45,590
Oh, Kitty!

814
00:41:45,674 --> 00:41:47,759
You gotta trust him.
Look at those eyes.

815
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:50,262
Really? You call that cute?

816
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:53,431
[Perro gasps]
Oh, look at her! [gasps]

817
00:41:53,515 --> 00:41:56,309
Those eyes are even bigger than yours.

818
00:41:56,393 --> 00:41:57,602
Do whatever she wants, Puss.

819
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:00,730
Wait a second. So poofy!

820
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:03,108
No! With the paws?

821
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:04,609
Come on! [gasps]

822
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:06,528
With the hat?

823
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:09,364
It's all so cute!

824
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:12,325
[screams] Cuteness overload!

825
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:13,410
[grunts]

826
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:15,578
Can we look at the map now?

827
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:17,872
[groaning]

828
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,544
"Follow this enchanted chart.

829
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:26,172
It knows your path and knows your heart."

830
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:28,800
[Puss] Is that us?

831
00:42:35,098 --> 00:42:38,476
[explosions]

832
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:47,485
It says we must go
through the Valley of Incineration,

833
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:49,237
over Undertaker Ridge,

834
00:42:49,321 --> 00:42:51,156
through the Cave of Lost Souls?

835
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,408
- Really? [exclaims]
- Let me take a look.

836
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:03,293
[rumbling]

837
00:43:07,505 --> 00:43:10,926
What? Swamp of Infinite Sorrows?

838
00:43:11,009 --> 00:43:12,844
Mountains of Misery?

839
00:43:12,928 --> 00:43:15,180
The Abyss of Eternal Loneliness?

840
00:43:15,263 --> 00:43:17,432
There's something wrong with this map.

841
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:20,143
I guess there is a different
terrible path for everyone.

842
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:23,438
It's almost like the forest
doesn't want anyone to make a wish.

843
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,441
Well, I don't even have a wish.
But can I try?

844
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:34,991
Ooh! Mine says… [gasps]

845
00:43:35,075 --> 00:43:36,785
…we skip through
the Pocket Full O' Posies.

846
00:43:36,868 --> 00:43:37,994
- [gasps]
- What?

847
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:40,246
[Perro] Then drift down
the River of Relaxation.

848
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,498
- That sounds fun.
- No fair.

849
00:43:41,581 --> 00:43:42,999
Why does he get the good ones?

850
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:45,210
Wander the Fields
of Quick and Easy Solutions

851
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:46,753
and arrive at the star!

852
00:43:46,836 --> 00:43:48,255
Oh, wow!

853
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:49,547
That sounds wonderful.

854
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,509
Oh, but no. This is your quest.
I don't wanna impose.

855
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:54,010
- [both] You hold the map.
- [Perro gasps]

856
00:43:54,094 --> 00:43:55,720
- Really?
- But don't you cross me.

857
00:43:55,804 --> 00:44:00,058
- Or your name will be <i>Perro Muerto</i>.
- Okeydokey.

858
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:04,896
Wait. Is that…

859
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,982
[distant screaming]

860
00:44:07,065 --> 00:44:09,109
It's raining bears. Time to go.

861
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:12,737
[Goldilocks laughs]
I'm telling ya, when we get that wish,

862
00:44:12,821 --> 00:44:15,448
it will make everything just right
for all of us.

863
00:44:15,532 --> 00:44:16,908
Will it make us rich?

864
00:44:16,992 --> 00:44:19,202
Rich enough to hibernate
all year round?

865
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:20,328
The richest.

866
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:22,497
Will we be, like, big-time thieves?

867
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,708
- The biggest.
- [chuckles]

868
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,876
Here, you know that suit
Jack Horner wears?

869
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,503
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna have one of them.

870
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:30,714
- Yeah?
- Only mine will be purpler.

871
00:44:30,797 --> 00:44:32,299
Like, twice as purpler.

872
00:44:32,382 --> 00:44:33,842
The purplest!

873
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:37,262
- Nice. Big-time thieves coming through!
- [Papa Bear] I'll race you!

874
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:39,306
- [Baby Bear] You can't beat me, old man.
- [Goldilocks laughs]

875
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:41,141
What kind of wish can do all that, Goldi?

876
00:44:41,224 --> 00:44:42,976
Oh! I can't tell ya.

877
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:45,687
If you say what your wish is,
then it don't come true.

878
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,355
Sorry, birthday wish rules.

879
00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:50,108
Oh, come on. Mother-daughter secret?

880
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:51,735
Mama, just drop it, please.

881
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:53,111
Oh. Okay.

882
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:56,489
Hey, come on.
We've got some cats to catch.

883
00:45:00,702 --> 00:45:03,121
[Perro] Birthday wish rules?
What's that mean?

884
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:05,373
It means I'm not telling you my wish.

885
00:45:05,457 --> 00:45:08,126
He doesn't wanna tell us
because it's something stupid.

886
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:10,295
Like conditioner
for that thing on his face.

887
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:11,671
It's distinguished.

888
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:14,341
What about you, Kitty?
What are you gonna wish for?

889
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:18,345
Can't tell you.
Birthday wish rules or whatever.

890
00:45:18,428 --> 00:45:20,931
Ha! I bet your wish
is something stupid like…

891
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:22,140
- [grunts]
- [flower growls]

892
00:45:22,223 --> 00:45:24,059
- [gasps]
- [Kitty laughs]

893
00:45:24,142 --> 00:45:25,143
You're such a…

894
00:45:26,102 --> 00:45:27,812
[Kitty shrieking]

895
00:45:29,981 --> 00:45:33,109
[gasps] This must be
the Pocket Full O' Posies.

896
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:36,905
- [flower growling]
- [Puss grunting]

897
00:45:36,988 --> 00:45:38,823
Out of the way, demon flower.

898
00:45:38,907 --> 00:45:40,742
It's pruning time!

899
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:41,910
[shouts]

900
00:45:41,993 --> 00:45:43,620
[grunting]

901
00:45:43,703 --> 00:45:45,705
[Puss, Kitty shouting]

902
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:46,790
[sniffs]

903
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:50,168
- [flower cooing]
- Aww, thank you.

904
00:45:50,252 --> 00:45:53,046
[screaming]

905
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:54,506
We don't have time for this.

906
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:57,217
<i>Perro</i>, I thought your path
was supposed to be easy.

907
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,472
[sniffs] You know, I think all you have
to do is stop and smell the roses.

908
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:04,391
Seriously? Ugh.

909
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:06,309
- [both sniffing]
- This is stupid.

910
00:46:06,393 --> 00:46:07,852
All I smell is bull…

911
00:46:07,936 --> 00:46:10,647
Shh. Watch.

912
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,399
[sniffs] Ah!

913
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:14,067
- [Kitty shouts]
- [Puss grunts]

914
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,318
Don't rush through it.

915
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:19,823
Take your time and really appreciate
what's right in front of you.

916
00:46:19,906 --> 00:46:20,991
[sniffs]

917
00:46:21,074 --> 00:46:22,575
[flowers cooing]

918
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:26,162
- Ugh! His path is so corny.
- [Perro] <i>Gracias.</i>

919
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:28,081
- And cheesy.
- And lame.

920
00:46:28,164 --> 00:46:30,208
- And weird, like him.
- Yeah.

921
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:32,294
Why are you so ridiculous, Dog?

922
00:46:32,377 --> 00:46:33,670
What's your story?

923
00:46:33,753 --> 00:46:35,088
My story? Oh!

924
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:38,258
It's actually a very funny story. [laughs]

925
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:41,261
Back when I was a pup,
me and my littermates lived with a family.

926
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:44,347
A family full of pranksters
who liked to play hide-and-seek,

927
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:45,974
and I was always "it."

928
00:46:46,057 --> 00:46:48,310
Pick on the little guy, am I right?
[sniffs]

929
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:51,646
They tried putting me
in a packing crate, a dumpster.

930
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,775
No matter how hard they tried,
I'd always find them.

931
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:57,277
So, one day they get creative.

932
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,489
And they put me in a sock
with a rock in it. [laughs]

933
00:47:01,573 --> 00:47:04,951
And then throw me in a river. [laughs]

934
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:10,248
I gnawed a hole in the sock
and I swam to the surface. [laughs]

935
00:47:10,332 --> 00:47:12,584
Never found them, or my littermates.

936
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:15,837
- So, I guess I'm still it. [laughs]
- Wow.

937
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:19,215
That is the saddest funny story
I've ever heard.

938
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:21,176
Well, joke's on them.

939
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:24,137
That sock they put me in, I grew into it.

940
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,808
So, I got a great story
and a free sweater out of it. Win-win!

941
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:30,518
Dude, you didn't win.

942
00:47:30,602 --> 00:47:32,562
You, of all people, should have a wish.

943
00:47:32,646 --> 00:47:34,898
I already have a comfy sweater
and two best friends.

944
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:36,608
I got everything I could wish for.

945
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:38,026
No magic required.

946
00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:39,110
[scoffs]

947
00:47:39,194 --> 00:47:40,445
Hmm?

948
00:47:45,408 --> 00:47:47,744
[flowers cooing]

949
00:47:50,747 --> 00:47:52,123
[Perro] Oh! Lovely.

950
00:47:57,504 --> 00:47:59,965
[sniffs]
Oh! We're getting really close.

951
00:48:00,048 --> 00:48:03,468
I can smell two cats, a dog… and pie?

952
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:08,265
Well, if it isn't the idiots
who tried to steal from me.

953
00:48:08,348 --> 00:48:09,724
Hey, he remembers us.

954
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:10,850
Behold,

955
00:48:10,934 --> 00:48:12,936
Excalibur!

956
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:14,562
Excalibur! [grunting]

957
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:17,023
Excalibur!

958
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:20,360
Yeah, I couldn't get this rock off of it,
but still pretty cool, right?

959
00:48:20,443 --> 00:48:21,695
[Mama Bear] He's gaining on us!

960
00:48:21,778 --> 00:48:23,280
[Big Jack Horner] Okay, little left.

961
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:25,532
- That's it!
- Go faster.

962
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:27,117
What, he's up me back door…

963
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,785
[shouts]

964
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:31,288
[Mama Bear, distorted] Goldi!

965
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:33,415
[grunting]

966
00:48:33,498 --> 00:48:35,000
[laughs]

967
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:40,547
[flowers growling]

968
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,757
[horses whinny]

969
00:48:42,841 --> 00:48:44,968
Well… start chopping!

970
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:47,804
[baker] On it!
You don't have to tell me twice.

971
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:50,765
I'm gonna chop the heck
out of this <i>Ficus lyrata</i>…

972
00:48:52,017 --> 00:48:53,310
Jerry, no!

973
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:56,146
Avenge me, Jack!

974
00:48:56,229 --> 00:48:57,314
Die, die, die!

975
00:48:57,397 --> 00:48:59,107
- [Big Jack Horner exclaims]
- [baker 2 shouting]

976
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,358
Nope.

977
00:49:00,442 --> 00:49:02,944
Time to bring out the big guns!

978
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:04,779
Guess I overpacked. [laughs]

979
00:49:05,363 --> 00:49:08,116
Magic snacks. Save those for later.

980
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:09,659
Ah! Pay dirt!

981
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:14,456
All right, magical locust, defoliate!

982
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:17,709
Fly and feast! Eat those flowers!

983
00:49:18,543 --> 00:49:22,380
I'm not a magic locust.
Why, I'm not a locust at all.

984
00:49:22,464 --> 00:49:25,133
What are you then?
Some sort of demon grasshopper?

985
00:49:25,216 --> 00:49:28,303
A deadly fairy?
Put a spell on the forest then.

986
00:49:28,386 --> 00:49:30,013
I don't cast spells.

987
00:49:30,096 --> 00:49:31,181
Well, what do you do?

988
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:32,891
Well, I-I-I judge you.

989
00:49:32,974 --> 00:49:34,768
I sit on your shoulder

990
00:49:34,851 --> 00:49:38,188
and judge your actions
and the quality of your character.

991
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:39,814
I'm your conscience.

992
00:49:39,898 --> 00:49:41,441
I really did overpack.

993
00:49:42,901 --> 00:49:44,986
Help me, Jack! Help!

994
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,821
Aren't you gonna help him, Jack?

995
00:49:46,905 --> 00:49:48,198
You're losing a lot of men.

996
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:50,992
I'm not really stressing
about the manpower.

997
00:49:51,076 --> 00:49:54,204
I've got a bottomless bag
of magic weapons.

998
00:49:54,287 --> 00:49:55,914
These babies are gonna get me that wish

999
00:49:55,997 --> 00:49:59,042
even after the whole team
is dead and gone.

1000
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,919
Now, now, Jack, as your conscience, I…

1001
00:50:01,002 --> 00:50:04,547
- [squawks]
- Oh, my word! It's the noble phoenix.

1002
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:07,801
She's the symbol of rebirth
and the eternal…

1003
00:50:07,884 --> 00:50:09,886
- Oh, God!
- [Big Jack Horner laughs]

1004
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,889
Pretty boss flamethrower, right?

1005
00:50:12,973 --> 00:50:16,351
I really have my work cut out for me
on this one.

1006
00:50:16,434 --> 00:50:20,272
[Big Jack Horner]
Don't be near where I'm flame-throwing.

1007
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:26,903
[chuckles]

1008
00:50:26,987 --> 00:50:28,905
Do your job, demon flowers.

1009
00:50:30,031 --> 00:50:31,199
Soon…

1010
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:35,620
[growls]

1011
00:50:35,704 --> 00:50:37,372
Okay, Kitty. I think I've got it now.

1012
00:50:37,455 --> 00:50:38,999
[straining]

1013
00:50:39,082 --> 00:50:40,875
Trust me.

1014
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:43,712
Easy, easy. You're gonna
give yourself a hernia.

1015
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:45,672
Here, one more time, like this.

1016
00:50:45,755 --> 00:50:47,507
[echoing] Trust me.

1017
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:52,387
Ah! But of course I trust you and Puss,
even without the eyes.

1018
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:54,681
Yeah? Big mistake.

1019
00:50:54,764 --> 00:50:56,308
What do you mean? You're my friends.

1020
00:50:56,891 --> 00:50:58,268
You know what trust gets you?

1021
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:00,895
A sock, a rock and a swim in the river.

1022
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:03,064
You have to trust somebody, right?

1023
00:51:03,148 --> 00:51:04,649
Not me. Uh-uh.

1024
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:07,611
Whenever I've let my guard down,
I've been double-crossed,

1025
00:51:07,694 --> 00:51:09,696
declawed, played and betrayed.

1026
00:51:11,072 --> 00:51:14,242
Never again. I am a solo act.

1027
00:51:14,826 --> 00:51:18,246
I keep my secrets
and I play my cards close.

1028
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,165
That's how you get a winning hand.

1029
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:23,084
Take it from me. Never trust anyone.

1030
00:51:27,714 --> 00:51:30,300
Wh... Wait. That's amazing!

1031
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,761
You're good.

1032
00:51:32,844 --> 00:51:35,764
[clears throat] Kitty, I've been thinking.

1033
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:37,307
Ugh. Thinking about what?

1034
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:40,977
My beautiful beard.
It is very distinguished, yes.

1035
00:51:41,061 --> 00:51:45,231
But it does deprive the world
a good look at…

1036
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:46,441
the face.

1037
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:51,363
So, if it will make you happy,
I could be convinced to…

1038
00:51:51,446 --> 00:51:52,906
- I've gotten used to it.
- Wait, what?

1039
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:54,866
The beard. Keep it.

1040
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,244
Uh… Well, you see… [chuckles]

1041
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:00,664
Kitty, please!
Get this itchy thing off of me!

1042
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:02,916
It's like a fever on my face.

1043
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:07,212
Hold on. Is the great Puss in Boots
asking for help?

1044
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:10,590
<i>Sí</i>, help. You were right.
The beard is disgusting.

1045
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:11,675
And?

1046
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:14,761
And it's like a possum crawled on my face.

1047
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:15,887
And?

1048
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:18,515
And died of shame.

1049
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:20,058
Okay, okay, possum face.

1050
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:23,687
I won't make you beg.

1051
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,107
Ow! [grunts]

1052
00:52:27,816 --> 00:52:29,359
Hey! Slow down. Ow!

1053
00:52:29,442 --> 00:52:32,195
Go with the grain.
You gotta go with the grain.

1054
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:33,530
- I know what I'm doing.
- Hey!

1055
00:52:33,613 --> 00:52:36,241
I'm a master of the blade. Right, <i>Perrito</i>?

1056
00:52:36,324 --> 00:52:38,034
[laughing, snorting]

1057
00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:39,577
What? What? What's funny?

1058
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:42,163
- Nothing should be funny.

01:00:10,153 --> 01:00:11,154
Something's cooking.

1236
01:00:11,237 --> 01:00:13,198
- [Papa Bear, Baby Bear chuckle]
- No.

1237
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:15,408
- [bears laughing]
- [Goldilocks] Do not open that door.

1238
01:00:15,492 --> 01:00:17,535
- [Mama Bear gasps]
- We are home! Hello, door.

1239
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:18,954
No, don't go inside… Ugh!

1240
01:00:19,037 --> 01:00:20,622
Maybe just a quick pop in.

1241
01:00:20,705 --> 01:00:22,874
- Hello, chairs.
- What say we hibernate?

1242
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,459
Hello, honey.

1243
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:26,628
Hello, my old friend.

1244
01:00:26,711 --> 01:00:31,216
I have missed you so… [snores]

1245
01:00:31,299 --> 01:00:33,635
Look, Goldi. Porridge. [sniffs]

1246
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:35,887
And it's made just the way you like it.

1247
01:00:35,971 --> 01:00:37,973
No matter how you make it,
she doesn't like it.

1248
01:00:38,056 --> 01:00:39,266
Stop it! All of you.

1249
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:41,518
Maybe our wishes have been granted.

1250
01:00:41,601 --> 01:00:43,853
Just stop! It's not our wish granted.

1251
01:00:43,937 --> 01:00:45,689
- It's an obstacle.
- [yawns]

1252
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:47,941
[Goldilocks]
It's the forest playing tricks.

1253
01:00:48,024 --> 01:00:50,443
This isn't real. None of this is…

1254
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,288
[Mama Bear] Ah!

1255
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:03,248
That was your favorite book.

1256
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:05,917
You used to stare at it for hours.

1257
01:01:11,715 --> 01:01:14,551
[humming]

1258
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:15,635
[gasps]

1259
01:01:17,095 --> 01:01:19,389
[laughing]

1260
01:01:22,017 --> 01:01:24,394
[grunts] Too hard.

1261
01:01:24,936 --> 01:01:25,937
Whoop!

1262
01:01:26,021 --> 01:01:26,980
[chuckles]

1263
01:01:27,063 --> 01:01:28,481
Too soft.

1264
01:01:28,565 --> 01:01:31,067
[grunting]

1265
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:36,323
Just right.

1266
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:38,783
Oh, this was it.

1267
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:40,076
What was it, Mama?

1268
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,703
The day a little orphan girl

1269
01:01:41,786 --> 01:01:44,748
broke into our cabin and stole our hearts.

1270
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,042
[exclaims, grunts]

1271
01:01:49,294 --> 01:01:52,672
The day when our world became just right.

1272
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:58,178
[Perro] How's it going?

1273
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:00,013
Can you see anything up there?

1274
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:02,182
Not yet, <i>Perrito</i>… [exclaims]

1275
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:03,516
You okay?

1276
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,310
<i>Sí</i>, I am good.

1277
01:02:05,393 --> 01:02:06,645
So good.

1278
01:02:06,728 --> 01:02:07,687
[shouts, grunts]

1279
01:02:09,022 --> 01:02:09,981
[breathes heavily]

1280
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:13,109
If you wanted to hold my hand,

1281
01:02:13,193 --> 01:02:14,945
all you had to do is ask.

1282
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:19,783
Uh… Just feel free to pull me up
whenever you get a chance.

1283
01:02:19,866 --> 01:02:24,829
Oh, I was just remembering
the last time I offered you my hand.

1284
01:02:24,913 --> 01:02:27,499
Only, that time,
I believe you had cold feet.

1285
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,418
[chuckles]

1286
01:02:34,923 --> 01:02:36,049
Kitty…

1287
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:39,344
[sighs]

1288
01:02:39,427 --> 01:02:40,887
About that day,

1289
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:44,599
Puss in Boots
is not supposed to be afraid.

1290
01:02:44,683 --> 01:02:48,770
But outside that church
in Santa Coloma… [stammers]

1291
01:02:48,853 --> 01:02:53,650
…that was the first time I ever felt fear.

1292
01:02:54,317 --> 01:02:56,903
So, I ran.

1293
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:01,157
It was a mistake, Kitty.

1294
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:02,659
It's okay.

1295
01:03:02,742 --> 01:03:04,953
- No, no. It was cowardly.
- It's okay.

1296
01:03:05,036 --> 01:03:07,038
- You alone at the altar.
- Puss.

1297
01:03:07,122 --> 01:03:09,165
In your beautiful poofy wedding dress.

1298
01:03:09,249 --> 01:03:11,376
Puss! It's okay.

1299
01:03:12,335 --> 01:03:13,712
I didn't show up either.

1300
01:03:14,754 --> 01:03:15,755
Wait, what?

1301
01:03:16,339 --> 01:03:18,049
What do you mean, you didn't show up?

1302
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:22,220
Well, I knew I could never compete
with your one true love.

1303
01:03:22,304 --> 01:03:24,139
- Who?
- Yourself.

1304
01:03:24,222 --> 01:03:25,307
The legend.

1305
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:26,391
Uh.

1306
01:03:26,474 --> 01:03:28,727
I wasn't gonna show up
for that guy.

1307
01:03:29,686 --> 01:03:33,231
But you don't seem like that guy anymore.

1308
01:03:36,568 --> 01:03:38,820
[Perro] Everything okay up there?

1309
01:03:38,903 --> 01:03:41,364
I'm giving you a thumbs up,
just so you know.

1310
01:03:41,448 --> 01:03:42,449
[Kitty] Puss.

1311
01:03:44,784 --> 01:03:45,785
Look.

1312
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:49,873
What do you think, bug?

1313
01:03:49,956 --> 01:03:52,792
Do I wait for the cats to steal the map
and then kill them,

1314
01:03:52,876 --> 01:03:55,629
or do I just kill everybody all at once?

1315
01:03:55,712 --> 01:04:00,091
You know, I'm starting to think
you don't appreciate the value of a life.

1316
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,969
What? No. I mean, I love these guys.

1317
01:04:03,053 --> 01:04:06,473
- [bakers exclaiming]
- Flex the glutes. I need a solid surface.

1318
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:10,268
There's good in all people.
There's good in all people.

1319
01:04:10,352 --> 01:04:13,146
You know, Jack,
maybe we need to dig a little deeper.

1320
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:15,398
Tell me about your childhood.

1321
01:04:15,482 --> 01:04:17,192
Uh…

1322
01:04:17,275 --> 01:04:19,569
You know, I never had much as a kid.

1323
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:21,071
Just loving parents

1324
01:04:21,154 --> 01:04:23,490
and stability and a mansion

1325
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:27,160
and a thriving baked goods enterprise
for me to inherit.

1326
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:28,954
Useless crap like that.

1327
01:04:30,163 --> 01:04:32,958
But once I get my wish,

1328
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:36,878
I'll finally have the one thing
that will make me happy.

1329
01:04:37,712 --> 01:04:39,130
Oh, well, what's that?

1330
01:04:39,214 --> 01:04:42,801
All of the magic in the world. For me.

1331
01:04:42,884 --> 01:04:45,136
- [cackling]
- And no one else gets any.

1332
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,721
Is that so much?

1333
01:04:46,805 --> 01:04:47,806
Yes!

1334
01:04:47,889 --> 01:04:50,433
Agree to disagree.
All right. Bring it over.

1335
01:04:50,517 --> 01:04:52,227
[bakers] No, no! No, no, no!

1336
01:04:53,395 --> 01:04:55,480
[bakers screaming]

1337
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:58,984
Help!

1338
01:04:59,067 --> 01:05:01,861
Sweet Mother of Goose, Jack!

1339
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:03,738
Well, you know what they say.

1340
01:05:03,822 --> 01:05:06,658
Can't bake a pie
without losing a dozen men.

1341
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:09,452
Oh. Oh!

1342
01:05:09,536 --> 01:05:10,954
That was horrible.

1343
01:05:11,037 --> 01:05:12,622
Your wish is horrible.

1344
01:05:12,706 --> 01:05:13,832
You're horrible!

1345
01:05:13,915 --> 01:05:16,376
You're an irredeemable monster…

1346
01:05:16,459 --> 01:05:19,379
Oh! Oh!
What took you so long, idiot?

1347
01:05:19,462 --> 01:05:20,672
[screams]

1348
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:21,756
Ugh.

1349
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,341
You're not chatty, are you?

1350
01:05:23,425 --> 01:05:24,676
Mm-mmm.

1351
01:05:27,345 --> 01:05:29,848
Okay, you take the window,
I'll take the chimney.

1352
01:05:29,931 --> 01:05:32,183
- What do I take?
- You take it easy, <i>Perrito</i>.

1353
01:05:32,267 --> 01:05:34,144
We need you to stay here and…

1354
01:05:34,227 --> 01:05:35,937
- Guard our rear.
- Yeah, yeah.

1355
01:05:36,021 --> 01:05:38,523
On your six.
Got your rears eyeballed and covered.

1356
01:05:38,607 --> 01:05:39,608
Hands in, crew.

1357
01:05:39,691 --> 01:05:40,900
Ready?

1358
01:05:40,984 --> 01:05:42,861
Go, Team Friendship!

1359
01:05:42,944 --> 01:05:45,488
Team Friendship?
I did not agree to this.

1360
01:05:45,572 --> 01:05:47,282
Yeah, do better. Try harder.

1361
01:05:47,365 --> 01:05:49,075
No, just a placeholder name, you know.

1362
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:51,036
I'll workshop it, okay? Go get 'em, tiger!

1363
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,413
- Hey! Take it easy.
- [Kitty chuckles]

1364
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:54,789
[snoring]

1365
01:05:55,707 --> 01:05:58,418
- Ready to get our wish back?
- "Our wish"?

1366
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:01,671
Well, I've been thinking,
if you play your cards right,

1367
01:06:01,755 --> 01:06:04,341
maybe we could share the wish.

1368
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,260
Share the wish?

1369
01:06:08,303 --> 01:06:09,930
[snores]

1370
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:14,976
[snores]

1371
01:06:16,645 --> 01:06:17,729
[grunts]

1372
01:06:21,149 --> 01:06:22,525
- [exclaims]
- [sighs]

1373
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:28,031
[gasps] It's gone!

1374
01:06:28,782 --> 01:06:30,492
Wake up. Someone's nicked the map.

1375
01:06:30,575 --> 01:06:32,452
What's all this?
What's all this bother about?

1376
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:33,954
Oi! Did you not hear her?

1377
01:06:34,037 --> 01:06:35,455
The map is missing.

1378
01:06:35,538 --> 01:06:37,457
Somebody took it.

1379
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:39,584
Hola.

1380
01:06:39,668 --> 01:06:42,504
Oi! You crimin' us?
When we just crimed you?

1381
01:06:42,587 --> 01:06:44,089
No. No crime-backs.

1382
01:06:44,172 --> 01:06:46,424
Oh, you're dead cat meat. [grunts]

1383
01:06:46,508 --> 01:06:48,635
Okay, okay. It's all… yours!

1384
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:52,138
Nowhere to go, Softpaws.

1385
01:06:52,222 --> 01:06:54,766
Really? Let's see what the map has to say.

1386
01:06:57,018 --> 01:06:58,019
No!

1387
01:06:58,603 --> 01:06:59,729
Our cabin!

1388
01:06:59,813 --> 01:07:02,274
[Baby Bear] My honey! What the Dickens?

1389
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,902
Oh, no, you don't. [shouts]

1390
01:07:10,365 --> 01:07:12,033
[gasps] Oh, no.

1391
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:19,332
Oof! [grunting]

1392
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:21,293
- We're coming, Go…
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

1393
01:07:21,376 --> 01:07:22,836
- Get off me, ya big lump.
- Hold still!

1394
01:07:22,919 --> 01:07:24,337
I'm coming…

1395
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:25,964
[Perro exclaims]

1396
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:27,632
[Perro] Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1397
01:07:28,425 --> 01:07:31,428
[Bears growling]

1398
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:33,597
- Shall we dance? I'll lead.
- [Puss grunts]

1399
01:07:35,307 --> 01:07:36,683
[shouts] Too hot!

1400
01:07:39,394 --> 01:07:41,771
[shouts] Too cold! Brain freeze.

1401
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:49,779
- Oh! That is just right.
- [shouts]

1402
01:08:02,834 --> 01:08:04,336
Hey? What the…

1403
01:08:19,017 --> 01:08:20,225
No!

1404
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:21,770
[exclaiming]

1405
01:08:23,313 --> 01:08:24,272
[Goldilocks] Oi!

1406
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:26,066
Forget something?

1407
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:28,068
[Perro whimpering]

1408
01:08:34,032 --> 01:08:35,200

01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:01,104
Hey, Puss!

1582
01:16:01,187 --> 01:16:02,606
[Death] Run.

1583
01:16:02,689 --> 01:16:04,524
Puss! Puss, we're here.

1584
01:16:04,608 --> 01:16:06,818
[panting]

1585
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:09,904
- [panting]
- [Perro] Where's he going?

1586
01:16:10,614 --> 01:16:12,616
[breathes heavily]

1587
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:22,542
[panting]

1588
01:16:22,626 --> 01:16:23,627
[Death] <i>Run.</i>

1589
01:16:25,545 --> 01:16:26,546
<i>Run.</i>

1590
01:17:14,928 --> 01:17:18,139
[Goldilocks] That's the third time
we've passed that same rock, Baby.

1591
01:17:18,223 --> 01:17:19,224
[Papa Bear] Oh, not again!

1592
01:17:19,307 --> 01:17:21,768
What do you want me to do?
I've lost the scent.

1593
01:17:21,851 --> 01:17:24,062
[Goldilocks] You only have one job.

1594
01:17:24,145 --> 01:17:27,315
The one thing that
makes you mildly useful is your nose,

1595
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:30,110
- and apparently you can't even use that.
- [Mama Bear] Goldi.

1596
01:17:30,193 --> 01:17:32,696
I'm starting to think this wish
isn't what you promised us.

1597
01:17:32,779 --> 01:17:34,239
- Leave off, Baby.
- So what is it?

1598
01:17:34,322 --> 01:17:36,366
Eh? What's your "just right"?

1599
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:38,201
What's so blasted important

1600
01:17:38,285 --> 01:17:40,620
that you've got us stranded
in this haunted forest?

1601
01:17:40,704 --> 01:17:44,124
I'm getting a family! That's what.
A proper family.

1602
01:17:44,749 --> 01:17:47,085
Then everything will be just right.

1603
01:17:50,297 --> 01:17:54,175
Your "just right" is getting rid of us?

1604
01:17:55,218 --> 01:17:58,430
Well, I guess some people just
stick around until the porridge is gone.

1605
01:17:58,513 --> 01:17:59,514
Eh, Goldi?

1606
01:18:03,018 --> 01:18:04,311
Come on.

1607
01:18:04,394 --> 01:18:06,896
You didn't think I would actually stay?

1608
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:08,940
I'm not a bear.

1609
01:18:11,568 --> 01:18:13,320
[rumbles]

1610
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:20,869
I was always afraid
it was too good to last.

1611
01:18:22,203 --> 01:18:23,955
And whether you think
we're your family or not,

1612
01:18:24,831 --> 01:18:27,792
if this is something
that will make you happy,

1613
01:18:27,876 --> 01:18:29,586
we'll get you that wish.

1614
01:18:30,378 --> 01:18:31,379
Come on, boys.

1615
01:18:38,762 --> 01:18:42,891
- [glass shatters]
- Oh-ho-ho! What a good boy am I.

1616
01:18:51,816 --> 01:18:54,069
"Star light, star bright,

1617
01:18:54,152 --> 01:18:56,696
first star I see tonight.

1618
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:57,781
I wish…"

1619
01:18:57,864 --> 01:18:59,658
I can't believe I fell for it again.

1620
01:18:59,741 --> 01:19:02,369
Kitty, you don't understand.

1621
01:19:02,452 --> 01:19:03,495
Don't understand what?

1622
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:05,789
That you've been playing me
this whole time?

1623
01:19:05,872 --> 01:19:07,499
I need this wish.

1624
01:19:07,582 --> 01:19:10,168
Oh, yeah? You wanna know
what my wish was?

1625
01:19:11,086 --> 01:19:13,797
Someone, anyone I could trust.

1626
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,465
Hey. [gasps]

1627
01:19:15,548 --> 01:19:18,260
In my whole life, I've never had that.

1628
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:22,973
But I thought I finally found
that someone without a wish.

1629
01:19:24,557 --> 01:19:25,684
I thought it was you.

1630
01:19:27,227 --> 01:19:28,895
But you're still running.

1631
01:19:28,979 --> 01:19:31,690
Still the same old Puss in Boots.

1632
01:19:31,773 --> 01:19:34,276
But I'm not! I'm not Puss in Boots.

1633
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:37,529
I'm... I am on my last life.

1634
01:19:38,488 --> 01:19:40,282
I need to get my lives back.

1635
01:19:40,365 --> 01:19:43,451
Without them, I'm not… I am not…

1636
01:19:43,535 --> 01:19:44,869
What? The legend?

1637
01:19:46,579 --> 01:19:48,415
[chuckles]

1638
01:19:48,498 --> 01:19:51,084
I still can't compete
with your one true love.

1639
01:19:52,043 --> 01:19:54,129
Go on. Get your lives back…

1640
01:19:54,212 --> 01:19:55,213
[gasps]

1641
01:19:56,006 --> 01:19:57,799
Just keep them out of mine.

1642
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:02,095
[whimpering]

1643
01:20:02,762 --> 01:20:04,681
Kitty, Death is after me!

1644
01:20:04,764 --> 01:20:05,932
What?

1645
01:20:06,016 --> 01:20:08,143
I've been called a lot of things,

1646
01:20:08,768 --> 01:20:10,270
but never "Death."

1647
01:20:10,353 --> 01:20:12,856
I like it. That's my wish!

1648
01:20:12,939 --> 01:20:13,940
Oi!

1649
01:20:14,482 --> 01:20:16,443
That's Goldi's wish.

1650
01:20:18,486 --> 01:20:19,321

[Papa Bear] Grab it!

1658
01:20:55,106 --> 01:20:56,733
[Big Jack Horner] Move! Out of my way!

1659
01:20:56,816 --> 01:20:58,026
I've got it! I've got it!

1660
01:20:58,109 --> 01:20:59,110
Don't got it!

1661
01:20:59,194 --> 01:21:00,862
[grunting]

1662
01:21:00,946 --> 01:21:02,238

[grunting]

1667
01:21:12,123 --> 01:21:14,167
Oh, come on! You walked into that one.

1668

[grunting]

1669
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:18,630
Mr. Horner, I need your help!

1670
01:21:18,713 --> 01:21:22,467
Duly noted, but a little busy
at the moment. Pew, pew!

1671
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,135
Mr. Horner!

1672
01:21:32,602 --> 01:21:33,645
- [Kitty shrieks]
- Ooh!

1673
01:21:33,728 --> 01:21:36,523
Ha-ha! It's bear season!

[grunts]

1675
01:21:37,691 --> 01:21:39,901
Oi! I'm gonna bust you up, plum-thumb,

1676
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:41,820
and then I'm gonna wear your clothes!

1677
01:21:41,903 --> 01:21:43,113
That was weird.

1678
01:21:43,196 --> 01:21:45,991
- [Baby Bear shouts]
- [Big Jack Horner laughs]

1679

- Baby!
- Mama, help!

1681
01:21:48,952 --> 01:21:49,911
I got you!

1682
01:21:49,995 --> 01:21:50,996
- Papa!
- Son!

1683
01:21:51,079 --> 01:21:52,747
I'm coming! I got you.

1684
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:53,665
Help!

1685
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:56,543
- Hold on!
- Something's happening!

1686
01:21:56,626 --> 01:21:57,794
Help me!

1687
01:21:59,754 --> 01:22:01,506
No, no, no!

1688
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:03,300
Hang on, son!

1689
01:22:03,383 --> 01:22:05,844
I can't stop it!

1690
01:22:05,927 --> 01:22:09,431
Mama, I'm slipping! I'm slipping!

Like I told you, Baby,

01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,480
you're the smash, I'm the grab.

1694
01:22:17,564 --> 01:22:19,399

Hey, Softpaws.
How do you like these apples?

1701
01:22:33,955 --> 01:22:36,041
Die! Blow up already!

1702

- Soft paws!

Okay, okay, you know,

1705
01:22:43,131 --> 01:22:46,635
maybe it's time to bury the hatchet!

1706

- [Kitty grunts]
- [babbles]

[yips]

1709
01:23:00,899 --> 01:23:02,901
Yeah. I don't know what to do with this.

1710
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:06,363
But if you think you need those lives…

1711
01:23:06,446 --> 01:23:07,822
Thank you, <i>Perrito</i>.

1712
01:23:08,782 --> 01:23:11,618
You know, I've only ever had one life,

1713
01:23:11,701 --> 01:23:14,245
but sharing it with you and Kitty

1714
01:23:14,329 --> 01:23:16,456
has made it pretty special.

1715
01:23:16,539 --> 01:23:19,709
Maybe one life is enough.

Who's that?

1720
01:23:39,396 --> 01:23:40,772
He's here for me.

1721
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:48,280
[Kitty] Puss!

1722
01:23:52,492 --> 01:23:54,536
I've enjoyed the chase, <i>gato</i>.

1723
01:23:55,245 --> 01:23:57,747
But I think we've reached the end now,
you and I.

1724
01:23:59,749 --> 01:24:02,294
You gonna take the coward's way out?

1725
01:24:02,377 --> 01:24:04,588
Run away to more lives?

1726
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:07,173
Or are you gonna fight?

1727
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:11,511
[heart pounding]

1728
01:24:12,846 --> 01:24:14,055
Pick it up.

No. Just one.

1735
01:24:42,876 --> 01:24:43,960
I'm done running.

1736
01:24:48,798 --> 01:24:51,009
