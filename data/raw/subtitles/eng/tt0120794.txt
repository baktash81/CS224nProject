# Mud, and lift #

00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,932
# Sand, and pull #

00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,927
# Water, and raise up #

9
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:00,852
- # Straw #
- Faster!

10
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,187
# With the sting
of the whip #

11
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:07,314
- # On my shoulder #
- Aah!

12
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,407
# With the salt of my sweat #

13
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:13,532
# On my brow #

14
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,612
# Elohim, God on high #

15
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:19,927
# Can You hear
Your people cry #

16
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:23,304
# Help us now #

17
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:26,013
# This dark hour #

18
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:28,612
# Deliver us #

19
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:31,887
# Hear our call
Deliver us #

20
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:35,544
# Lord of all
remember us #

21
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:39,167
# Here in this burning sand #

22
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,252
# Deliver us #

23
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:46,527
# There's a land
You promised us #

24
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:51,767
# Deliver us
to the Promised Land #

25
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:07,407
# Yal-di ha-tov

# Al ti-ra veh

27
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:16,747
# My son
I have nothing I can give #

28
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:21,047
# But this chance
that you may live #

29
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:24,372
# I pray
we'll meet again #

30
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:28,007
- # If He will deliver us #
- # Deliver us #

31
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,292
- # Hear our prayer #
- Ohh!

32
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:35,687
- # Deliver us from despair
These years of slavery #

33
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:37,807
# Grow too cruel to stand #

34
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:40,447
# Deliver us #

35
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:44,167
# There's a land
You promised us #

36
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:46,344
# Deliver us #

37
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,487
# Out of bondage #

38
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:51,012
# And #

39
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,452
# Deliver us #

40
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:59,927
# To the Promised Land #

41
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:13,052
# Hush now, my baby #

42
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,807
# Be still, love
Don't cry #

43
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:18,527
# Sleep
as you're rocked #

44
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:23,612
# By the stream #

45
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,927
# Sleep and remember #

46
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:30,092
# My last lullaby #

47
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:33,047
# So I'll be
with you #

48
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:37,447
# When you dream #

49
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:46,987
# River, oh, river #

50
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:50,134
# Flow gently for me #

51
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,247
# Such precious cargo #

52
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:56,452
# You bear #

53
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:59,927
# Do you know somewhere #

54
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:03,287
# He can live free #

55
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:05,092
# River #

56
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:10,807
# Deliver him there #

57
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,852
# Brother #

58
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:39,807
# You're safe now
and safe may you stay #

59
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:45,607
# For I have a prayer
&ust for you #

60
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:49,812
# Grow, baby brother #

61
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:54,467
- # Come back someday #
- Mmm.

62
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:59,087
# Come and deliver us too #

63
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,687
Mommy!

64
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:13,287
Come, Rameses. We will show Pharaoh
your new baby brother-

65
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:16,292
Moses.

66
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:18,372
# Deliver us #

67
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:22,927
# Send a shepherd
to shepherd us #

68
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:25,172
# And deliver us #

69
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:31,687
# To the Promised Land #

70
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:33,892
# Deliver us #

71
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:38,047
# To the Promised #

72
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:44,532
# Land #

73
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:49,607
# Deliver us ##

74
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,687
- Ha, ha!
- Faster, you beasts!

75
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,567
You run like mules.

76
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:08,687
- Hey, Rameses, how'd you like your
face carved on a wall? - Someday, yes.

77
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,447
How about now?

78
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:16,132
You almost killed me!

79
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,527
Oh, come on.
Where's your sense of fun?

80
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:22,367
Oh, it's fun you want?

81
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,367
Whoa!

82
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:30,967
Whoa! Aah!

83
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:36,327
Ohh. Moses?

84
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:39,487
Whoa!

85
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,247
Whoa!

86
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,047
Whoa!

87
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:57,052
Come on, you.
Whoa!

88
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,087
Come on, Moses. Admit it.
You've always looked up to me.

89
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,727
Yes, but it's
not much of a view.

90
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:06,404
Hyah! Whoo!

91
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:09,972
Hey!

92
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,447
- Second born, second place.
- Not for long.

93
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:25,527
Whoa!

94
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:33,727
- Whoa!
- Aah! Aaah!

95
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:53,167
&ump!

96
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:14,487
Whoa!

97
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,527
Whoo!

98
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:37,207
You don't think we'll
get in trouble for this, do you?

99
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:39,087
No, not a chance.

100
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:42,247
Why do the gods
torment me...

101
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:45,172
with such reckless,
destructive,

102
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:47,767
- blasphemous sons?
- Father, hear what I-

103
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:50,367
Be still!
Pharaoh speaks.

104
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:54,212
I seek to build
an empire,

105
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:57,047
and your only thought
is to amuse yourselves...

106
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:58,892
by tearing it down.

107
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,812
Have I taught you nothing?

108
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:04,847
You mustn't be so hard on yourself, Your
Ma&esty. You're an excellent teacher.

109
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:07,847
It's not your fault
your sons learned nothing.

110
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:09,767
- They learned blasphemy.
- True.

111
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,812
Father,
the fault is mine.

112
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,847
I goaded Rameses on,
and so I am responsible.

113
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:18,332
Hmm.
Responsible.

114
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:21,367
Do you know the meaning
of that word, Rameses?

115
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:23,212
I understand, Father.

116
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:27,287
And do you understand the task for which
your birth has destined you?

117
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:29,612
The ancient traditions.

118
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,852
When I pass
into the next world,

119
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:34,892
then you will be
the morning and evening star.

120
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,607
One damaged temple does not
destroy centuries of tradition.

121
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:40,727
But one weak link
can break the chain...

122
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:44,607
of a mighty dynasty!

123
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,767
You have my leave to go.

124
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:56,687
Father.

125
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:11,332
Father?

126
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:14,567
You know it was
really my fault.

127
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:17,692
Must you be
so hard on him?

128
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:21,487
Moses, you will never
have to carry a burden...

129
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:24,492
like the crown
I will pass to Rameses.

130
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:29,447
He must not allow himself
to be led astray,

131
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,247
not even by you, my son.

132
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:37,107
All he cares about is-
is your approval.

133
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:40,447
I know he will live up
to your expectations.

134
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,927
He only needs
the opportunity.

135
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,727
Maybe. Maybe so.

136
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,447
Go now. I shall
see you both tonight.

137
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:06,927
- Well, that went well.
- &ust go away.

138
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:08,772
Could have been worse.

139
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:12,367
"The weak link in the chain. "
That's what he called me.

140
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,252
Well, you are
rather pathetic.

141
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:20,212
Irresponsible,
ignorant of the traditions.

142
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:23,167
He practically accused me
of bringing down the dynasty.

143
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,807
Yeah, I can see it now.
There go the pyramids!

144
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:29,052
You can laugh about it.

145
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:32,652
Statues cracking and toppling over.
The Nile drying up.

146
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:37,527
Single-handedly, you will manage to bring
the greatest kingdom on Earth to ruin.

147
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:39,292
Tell me this, Moses.

148
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:41,687
Why is it that every time
you start something,

149
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:44,407
I'm the one
who ends up in trouble?

150
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:47,172
Ah, man! Oh.

151
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:51,107
- Ah, it's Rameses. You're in trouble.
- Get down here!

152
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:55,007
- I think you owe us an apology.
- Oh, my new thing!

153
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,732
- I am so upset!
- You might as well.

154
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:00,287
- You'll pay for this.
- We're gonna tell the Pharaoh!

155
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:03,332
Hmm.

156
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:07,367
- Oh, look at me. I'm drenched again.
- Hey. I figured it out.

157
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:09,892
- You know what your problem is, Rameses?
- What?

158
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:13,807
- You care too much. - And your
problem is, you don't care at all.

159
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:16,647
Oh, in that case, I suppose
you care a lot more than I do...

160
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:20,367
that we're late for the banquet,
for example.

161
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:23,532
I'm done for.

162
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,407
- Father will kill me.
- Don't worry.

163
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:29,247
Nobody will even
notice us coming in.

164
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,087
"Nobody will
even notice. "

165
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:41,972
Ah, the young princes.

166
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,932
Rameses, you were &ust
named prince regent.

167
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:49,207
You are now responsible
for overseeing all the temples.

168
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:51,927
I suggest
you get over there...

169
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:54,564
and thank your father.

170
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,883
Apparently, Moses,

171
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:59,132
someone thought he...

172
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,127
&ust needed
the opportunity.

173
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,732
My lord Pharaoh.

174
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,487
I propose that the high priests
offer tribute...

175
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:10,332
to their new regent.

176
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,967
An excellent idea.
Hotep! Huy!

177
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,732
- Huy.
- Hmm?

178
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:16,807
- The Midian girl.
- That's a good idea!

179
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:18,727
Go get her.

180
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:22,052
By the power of Ra,

181
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,727
we present for your
delectation and delight...

182
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:29,367
an exotic apparition
stolen from a faraway land.

183
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:40,767
- We offer you this
delicate desert flower.

184
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:50,007
Let us inspect
this... desert flower.

185
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:53,972
More like a desert cobra.

186
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,767
Not much of a snake
charmer, are you?

187
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:59,012
That's why I
give her to you.

188
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:02,647
- No, that's generous, but-
- I won't be given to anyone.

189
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:05,764
Especially an arrogant,
pampered palace brat!

190
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,772
Are you going to
let her talk to you like that?

191
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:11,887
You will show the proper respect
for a prince of Egypt.

192
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:14,367
But I am showing you
all the respect you deserve-

193
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:15,732
none!

194
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,972
No. Wait!

195
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:21,252
- Be still.
- Untie this rope!

196
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,207
- I demand you set me free!
- Be still.

197
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:26,247
- Let go!
- As you wish.

198
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:28,567
Aah! Ohh!

199
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,972
You there!

200
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,932
Have her dried off...

201
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,372
and sent to
Prince Moses' chambers.

202
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:49,167
If it pleases you,
Father, my first act as regent...

203
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:51,087
is to appoint Moses...

204
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:53,647
as royal chief...

205
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,687
architect.

206
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,827
Well-

207
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:26,487
Right.

208
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:44,047
Shh. Come on.

209
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:54,492
Guards.

210
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:57,047
Prince Moses.

211
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,687
Uh...

212
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:05,487
there's a-a man
tied up in my room.

213
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,447
- Well, look into it.
- Right away, sire.

214
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,892
Please, I need water.

215
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:29,047
- I have a long &ourney ahead of me.
- May God protect you.

216
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,447
Thank you.

217
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,007
Hut-hut.

218
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:50,287
- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I-

219
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:52,612
Oh, please forgive me. I-

220
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:56,087
I didn't expect
to see... you...

221
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:58,224
here, of all places,

222
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,252
at-at-at our door.

223
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:03,812
- Mmm, at last!
- At last?

224
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:06,487
Didn't I tell you, Aaron? I knew he
would return to us when he was ready.

225
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,404
Miriam, do you
want us flogged?

226
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,252
I knew you cared
about our freedom.

227
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:12,687
- Miriam!
- Freedom? Why would I care about that?

228
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:16,527
Because you're-
well, you're our brother.

229
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,367
- What?
- Be-

230
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,927
- They never told you?
- Who never told me what?

231
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:29,252
But you're here.
You must know.

232
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:32,227
- Be careful, slave!
- Oh, my good prince.

233
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:35,167
Um, she's-she's exhausted
from the day's work.

234
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:37,064
Uh, not that it
was too much.

235
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:38,892
We- We quite
enjoyed it.

236
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,727
But-But she's confused
and knows not to whom she speaks.

237
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:45,487
I know to whom I speak, Aaron.
I know who you are.

238
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:47,812
- You are not a prince of Egypt.
- Miriam.

239
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:50,507
- What did you say?
- Your Highness, pay her no heed.

240
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,994
C- Come, Miriam.
May I discuss something with you?

241
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,412
No, Aaron. No!
Please, Moses, you must believe!

242
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:57,927
- That's enough.
- You were born of my mother, Yocheved.

243
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:00,012
- Stop it.
- You are our brother!

244
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:02,927
Now you go too far.
You shall be punished.

245
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:06,132
No! Please, uh,
Your Highness.

246
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:09,047
She's ill. She's very ill.
We beg your forgiveness.

247
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,212
- Please, Miriam, let us go.
- No, Aaron.

248
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:14,367
Our mother set you adrift
in a basket to save your life!

249
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:16,412
Save my life?
From who?

250
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:18,607
Ask the man
that you call "Father. "

251
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:23,532
- How dare you?
- God saved you to be our deliverer.

252
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:27,447
- Enough of this.
- And you are, Moses. You are the deliverer.

253
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:29,247
I said, enough!

254
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,287
You will regret
this night.

255
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:44,732
# Hush now, my baby #

256
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:48,167
# Be still, love
Don't cry #

257
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:52,207
# Sleep
as you're rocked #

258
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:55,527
# By the stream #

259
00:20:56,727 --> 00:21:00,667
# Sleep and remember #

260
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:04,474
# My last lullaby #

261
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:08,598
# So I'll be with you #

262
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:12,687
# When you dream ##

263
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:31,887
Did you see him? It's Moses.

264
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:54,332
# Gleaming in the moonlight #

265
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:58,207
# Cool and clean
and all I've ever known #

266
00:21:58,242 --> 00:22:00,527
# All I ever wanted #

267
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:05,207
# Sweet perfumes
of incense #

268
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:09,407
# And graceful rooms
of alabaster stone #

269
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:12,704
# All I ever wanted #

270
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:15,932
# This is my home #

271
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,147
# With my father
mother, brother #

272
00:22:18,182 --> 00:22:20,327
# Oh, so noble
Oh, so strong #

273
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:23,772
# Now I am home #

274
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,887
# Here among my trappings
and belongings #

275
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:29,212
# I belong #

276
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,527
# And if anybody doubts it #

277
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:35,652
# They couldn't
be more wrong #

278
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,212
# I am a sovereign
prince of Egypt #

279
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:41,687
# A son of the proud history
that's shown #

280
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:46,092
# Etched on every wall #

281
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:49,487
# Surely this is all
I ever wanted #

282
00:22:49,522 --> 00:22:53,207
# All I ever wanted #

283
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:57,064
# All I ever #

284
00:22:57,099 --> 00:23:00,887
# Wanted ##

285
00:25:42,127 --> 00:25:45,127
The Hebrews grew
too numerous.

286
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:48,947
They might have risen
against us.

287
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,847
Father, tell me
you didn't do this.

288
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:54,452
Moses,

289
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:58,607
sometimes,
for the greater good,

290
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,887
sacrifices must be made.

291
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,527
Sacrifices?

292
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:16,092
Oh, my son.

293
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:19,367
They were only slaves.

294
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:39,412
Moses?

295
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:42,132
Is this where
you found me?

296
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,687
Moses, please try
to understand.

297
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:52,707
So- So everything
I thought,

298
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:56,727
everything I am,
is a lie.

299
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:58,492
No.

300
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:02,087
You are our son,
and we love you.

301
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:06,087
Why did you choose me?

302
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:08,544
We didn't, Moses.

303
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:10,967
The gods did.

304
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:20,187
# This is your home
my son #

305
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,974
# Here the river
brought you #

306
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,727
# And it's here
the river meant #

307
00:27:27,762 --> 00:27:30,932
# To be your home #

308
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:34,227
# Now you know
the truth, love #

309
00:27:34,262 --> 00:27:37,372
# Now forget
and be content #

310
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:41,387
# When the gods
send you a blessing #

311
00:27:41,422 --> 00:27:45,367
# You don't ask why
it was sent ##

312
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:04,812
Last night, the gods
granted me a vision.

313
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:09,047
I'm not merely going to restore
this temple, I will make it more grand,

314
00:28:09,082 --> 00:28:12,407
more splendid
than any other one in Egypt.

315
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:33,932
Aah.

316
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,887
- Get up!
- Aah!

317
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:45,052
Moses! Look.

318
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:49,207
Fate has turned our little misadventure
into a great opportunity.

319
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:51,847
- Get up, old man!
- Father will be so pleased-

320
00:28:51,882 --> 00:28:55,887
Put your back into it!

321
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:58,612
Faster!

322
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:00,612
This is &ust
the beginning.

323
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:04,367
A gateway will open to an entire
new city of white limestone,

324
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:06,584
more dazzling
than the sun.

325
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,767
And here, a statue of Hapi.

326
00:29:08,802 --> 00:29:10,572
I said, hurry!

327
00:29:10,607 --> 00:29:13,292
- ... two great column halls.
- Stop it!

328
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:15,367
- Somebody's got to stop this!
- There's nothing we can do.

329
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:29,012
Stop it.

330
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,932
Stop. Stop it!

331
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:34,487
- Leave that man alone!
- Moses!

332
00:29:44,487 --> 00:29:48,767
Out of my way.
Out of my way. Move!

333
00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:50,612
Who did this?

334
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:54,607
Up there! It's him.
Up there.

335
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:08,167
Moses!

336
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:22,487
Moses, what's going on?
Moses!

337
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:32,767
Moses!

338
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:36,732
- Moses!
- Let me go!

339
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:40,367
- No, wait. - You saw what happened.
I &ust killed a man.

340
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:42,892
We can take care
of that.

341
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:45,092
I will make it
so it never happened.

342
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:48,307
Nothing you can say
can change what I've done.

343
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:51,274
I am Egypt, the morning
and the evening star.

344
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:54,207
If I say day is night,
it will be written,

345
00:30:54,242 --> 00:30:57,047
and you will be
what I say you are.

346
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:59,132
I say you are innocent.

347
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,767
What you say does not matter.
You don't understand.

348
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:04,647
I can't stay here
any longer.

349
00:31:04,682 --> 00:31:06,492
- Moses!
- No!

350
00:31:06,527 --> 00:31:10,287
All I've ever known
to be true is a lie.

351
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:15,187
I'm not who
you think I am.

352
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:17,692
What are you
talking about?

353
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:21,367
Go ask the man
I once called "Father. "

354
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:27,007
Moses?

355
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,807
Please.

356
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:39,207
Good-bye, brother.

357
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:45,887
Moses!

358
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,927
Moses!

359
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:53,047
No.

360
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,127
Aah!

361
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:50,647
Aaah!

362
00:33:58,607 --> 00:34:02,487
Hey, wait.

363
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:06,007
Please.

364
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:17,927
Ohh!

365
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:22,247
Oh!

366
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:30,332
What are you doing?

367
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:33,327
- Help!
- Let our sheep drink!

368
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,287
Leave us alone!
Get away!

369
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:40,652
Stop it!

370
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:43,107
My father's
the high priest of Midian.

371
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:45,527
You're going to be
in big trouble.

372
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:48,452
- Aah!
- Hey, you.

373
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,167
Aren't these
your camels?

374
00:34:52,327 --> 00:34:54,967
- Hut-hut!
- No, no! No, no!

375
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:57,287
- Wait!
- Wait, stop!

376
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,647
Whoa!

377
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:14,812
What are you girls
doing?

378
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:17,327
We're trying to get the funny man
out of the well.

379
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:19,924
Trying to get the funny man
out of the well.

380
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:22,983
- Well, that's one
I've never heard before.

381
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:26,007
Oh, my.
Oh, uh, don't worry down there!

382
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:28,127
Uh, we'll get you out.
Hold on!

383
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,507
You.

384
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:37,054
Huh?

385
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:39,567
Ohh!

386
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:43,927
Mm-hmm.

387
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:49,847
That's why Papa says
she'll never get married.

388
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:57,487
You don't have to do this. Ladies,
please, I'm really- I'm really quite-

389
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,772
No, not there, please.

390
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:02,527
That tickles. Ladies,
you've cleaned every inch of me.

391
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:04,612
Whoa, I- I was wrong.

392
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:08,327
Let me through. Let me through.
I want to see him.

393
00:36:08,362 --> 00:36:12,172
Ah! You are most welcome.

394
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:14,767
You should not be
a stranger in this land.

395
00:36:14,802 --> 00:36:17,212
You have been sent
as a blessing.

396
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:20,447
Tonight, you shall be my honored guest.

397
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:26,247
My father, &ethro,
High Priest of Midian.

398
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:37,407
Psst. Sit with me.

399
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:40,127
Um, all right.

400
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:45,332
Psst. Not yet.

401
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:48,052
- Oh, sorry.
- My children,

402
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:52,207
let us give thanks
for this bountiful food.

403
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:55,932
And let us also give thanks
for the presence...

404
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:59,767
of this brave, young man
whom we honor here tonight.

405
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:03,892
Please, sir, I wish you wouldn't.

406
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:07,007
I've done nothing in my life
worth honoring.

407
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:13,932
First, you rescue Tzipporah
from Egypt,

408
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,967
- then you defend my younger
daughters from brigands.

409
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:20,052
You think that is nothing?

410
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:23,567
It seems you do not know
what is worthy of honor.

411
00:37:23,602 --> 00:37:25,984
# A single thread
in a tapestry #

412
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:28,367
# Though its color
brightly shine #

413
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:30,452
# Can never see
its purpose #

414
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:33,287
# In a pattern
of the grand design #

415
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:36,967
# And the stone that sits
on the very top #

416
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:39,104
# Of the mountain's
mighty face #

417
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:42,273
# Does it think
it's more important #

418
00:37:42,308 --> 00:37:45,292
# Than the stones
that form the base #

419
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:47,927
# So how can you see
what your life is worth #

420
00:37:47,962 --> 00:37:50,132
# Or where
your value lies #

421
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:54,127
# You can never see
through the eyes of man #

422
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:56,532
# You must look
at your life #

423
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,852
# Look at your life
through heaven's eyes #

424
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,647
# La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la #

425
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:04,684
# La, la-la-la-la-la-la #

426
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,652
# La-la-la-la-la-la #

427
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:10,727
- # Lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-la # - Dance with me.

428
00:38:10,762 --> 00:38:14,167
No, I don't know how.

429
00:38:23,487 --> 00:38:25,447
# A lake of gold
in the desert sand #

430
00:38:25,482 --> 00:38:27,564
# Is less than
a cool, fresh spring #

431
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,783
# And to one lost sheep
a shepherd boy #

432
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,967
# Is greater
than the richest king #

433
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:36,007
# If a man lose
everything he owns #

434
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:38,087
# Has he truly
lost his worth #

435
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,132
# Or is it the beginning #

436
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:44,092
# Of a new and brighter birth #

437
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:46,727
# So how do you measure
the worth of a man #

438
00:38:46,762 --> 00:38:48,852
# In wealth or strength
or size #

439
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:53,007
# In how much he gained
or how much he gave #

440
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,332
# The answer will come #

441
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:59,127
# The answer will come
to him who tries #

442
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:02,424
# To look at his life
through heaven's eyes #

443
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:05,687
# And that's why we share
all we have with you #

444
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:07,964
# Though there's little
to be found #

445
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:10,343
# When all you've got
is nothing #

446
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:12,687
# There's a lot
to go around #

447
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:17,167
# No life can escape
being blown about #

448
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:19,652
# By the winds
of change and chance #

449
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:22,487
- # And though you never know
all the steps # - Dance with me.

450
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:26,807
- No, I- No. No!
- # You must learn to &oin the dance #

451
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:30,247
# You must learn
to &oin the dance #

452
00:39:30,282 --> 00:39:32,892
# La-la-la
Lee-lai-lai-lai #

453
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:35,172
# Lai-lai-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai #

454
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,947
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-lai #

455
00:39:38,982 --> 00:39:43,114
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai,
lai-lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-lai #

456
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:46,498
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai-lai-lai-lai #

457
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:49,847
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-lai #

458
00:39:49,882 --> 00:39:53,847
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai-lai #

459
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:57,567
# So how do you &udge
what a man is worth #

460
00:39:57,602 --> 00:40:00,052
# By what he builds
or buys #

461
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:02,847
# You can never see
with your eyes on earth #

462
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:05,087
# Look through
heaven's eyes #

463
00:40:05,122 --> 00:40:09,092
# Look at your life #

464
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:13,567
# Look at your life
through heaven's #

465
00:40:13,602 --> 00:40:21,447
# Eyes ##

466
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:35,047
Mmm.

467
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,687
I love you.

468
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:57,287
Ahh!

469
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:19,567
It's too early
for this.

470
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:18,487
Moses.

471
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:22,527
Moses.

472
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:27,447
Moses.

473
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:32,367
Here I am.

474
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:37,772
Take the sandals
from your feet,

475
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:41,887
for the place on which you stand
is holy ground.

476
00:42:49,087 --> 00:42:51,007
Who are you?

477
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:55,567
I am that I am.

478
00:42:57,687 --> 00:42:59,772
I don't understand.

479
00:42:59,807 --> 00:43:03,407
I am the God of your ancestors,

480
00:43:03,442 --> 00:43:06,767
Abraham, Isaac
and &acob.

481
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:13,327
You were born of my
mother, Yocheved. You are our brother.

482
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:18,647
What do You want
with me?

483
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:24,447
I have seen the oppression
of My people in Egypt...

484
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:27,172
and have heard their cry.

485
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:30,332
- Stop it!
Leave that man alone!

486
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:33,927
So I have come down
to deliver them out of slavery...

487
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:37,327
and bring them
to a good land,

488
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:43,287
a land flowing
with milk and honey.

489
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:48,647
And so, unto Pharaoh,

490
00:43:48,682 --> 00:43:51,527
I shall send...

491
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,532
you.

492
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:57,252
Me? Wh-Who am I
to lead these people?

493
00:43:57,287 --> 00:44:00,087
They'll never believe me.
They won't even listen.

494
00:44:00,122 --> 00:44:02,567
I shall teach you
what to say.

495
00:44:02,602 --> 00:44:05,612
Let my people go!

496
00:44:05,647 --> 00:44:07,772
But I was their enemy.

497
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:12,247
I was the prince of Egypt, the son of
the man who slaughtered their children.

498
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,784
You've- You've chosen
the wrong messenger.

499
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,287
H- How can I even speak
to these people?

500
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,852
Who made man's mouth?

501
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:23,767
Who made the deaf, the mute,
the seeing or the blind?

502
00:44:23,802 --> 00:44:26,607
Did not I?
Now go!

503
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:41,772
Oh, Moses,

504
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:46,567
I shall be with you when you
go to the king of Egypt.

505
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:49,207
But Pharaoh
will not listen.

506
00:44:52,847 --> 00:44:56,047
So I will stretch out
My hand...

507
00:44:56,082 --> 00:44:58,524
and smite Egypt...

508
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:00,967
with all My wonders.

509
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:09,047
Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.

510
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,972
With it,

511
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:14,927
you shall do My wonders.

512
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:21,887
I shall be with you,
Moses.

513
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:25,607
Moses.

514
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:29,207
Moses.

515
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:47,612
But, Moses,

516
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:50,447
you are &ust one man.

517
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:55,367
Tzipporah,

518
00:46:57,367 --> 00:47:00,047
please.

519
00:47:06,647 --> 00:47:09,087
Look at your family.

520
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:14,532
They are free.

521
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:16,612
They have a future.

522
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:19,252
They have hopes
and dreams...

523
00:47:19,287 --> 00:47:22,367
and the promise
of a life with dignity.

524
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:27,767
That is what I want
for my people.

525
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:31,567
And that is why
I must do the task...

526
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:34,727
that God has given me.

527
00:47:45,847 --> 00:47:48,287
I'm coming with you.

528
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:14,812
Rameses.

529
00:49:14,847 --> 00:49:18,167
Moses?
Is it really?

530
00:49:22,887 --> 00:49:24,972
Moses!

531
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:27,407
- Rameses!
- Where have you been? I took you for dead.

532
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:32,892
Look at you!
Pharaoh.

533
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:36,367
Well, look at you.
What on earth are you dressed as?

534
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:41,007
Oh, Rameses,
it's so good to see you.

535
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:42,852
Excuse me, Your Ma&esty.

536
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:48,127
We are compelled to remind you this man
committed a serious crime against the gods.

537
00:49:48,162 --> 00:49:50,332
We are loathe
to bring it up, mind you.

538
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,967
The law clearly states
the punishment for such a crime-

539
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:54,967
- Death!
- We hesitate to say it.

540
00:49:55,002 --> 00:49:58,247
Be still.
Pharaoh speaks.

541
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:02,247
I am the morning
and the evening star.

542
00:50:02,282 --> 00:50:04,132
Rameses.

543
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,252
It shall be as I say.

544
00:50:06,287 --> 00:50:10,687
I pardon forever all crimes
of which he stands accused...

545
00:50:10,722 --> 00:50:13,127
and will have it known
that he is...

546
00:50:13,162 --> 00:50:15,264
our brother Moses,

547
00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:17,367
the prince of Egypt.

548
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,287
Rameses,

549
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,187
in my heart,
you are my brother,

550
00:50:27,222 --> 00:50:30,087
but things cannot be
as they were.

551
00:50:30,122 --> 00:50:32,327
I see no reason why not.

552
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:38,527
You know I am a Hebrew, and the God
of the Hebrews came to me.

553
00:50:38,562 --> 00:50:40,852
What?

554
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:43,527
He commands that you
let His people go.

555
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,807
Commands?

556
00:50:54,407 --> 00:50:58,127
Behold... the power of God.

557
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:15,407
Well, uh, impressive.

558
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,772
Hmm.

559
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:22,047
Very well, Moses.
I'll play along.

560
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,372
Hotep. Huy.

561
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:27,607
Give this snake charmer
our answer.

562
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:50,847
By the power of Ra.

563
00:51:50,882 --> 00:51:52,884
Mut.

564
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:54,852
Nut.

565
00:51:54,887 --> 00:51:56,812
- Khnum.
- Ptah.

566
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,867
- Nephthys.
- Nekhbet.

567
00:51:58,902 --> 00:52:01,394
- Sobek.
- Sekhmet.

568
00:52:01,429 --> 00:52:03,718
Sokar. Selket. Reshpu.

569
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,860
- Wad&et.
- Anubis.

570
00:52:05,895 --> 00:52:07,891
- Anukis.
- Seshmu.

571
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:09,886
- Meshkent.
- Hemsut.

572
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:11,772
- Tefnut.
- Heket.

573
00:52:11,807 --> 00:52:14,127
- Mafdet.
- Ra, Mut, Nut, Ptah.

574
00:52:14,162 --> 00:52:16,184
Hemsut, Tefnut,
Sokar, Selket.

575
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:18,172
Seshmu, Reshpu,
Sobek, Wad&et.

576
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:21,167
Heket, Mafdet,
Nephthys, Nekhbet, Ra!

577
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:26,567
# So you think
you've got friends #

578
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:29,132
# In high places #

579
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:33,727
# With the power
to put us on the run #

580
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:36,967
# Well, forgive us
these smiles #

581
00:52:37,002 --> 00:52:39,492
# On our faces #

582
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:43,767
# You'll know what power is
when we are done #

583
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:45,607
Son.

584
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:51,932
# You're playing
with the big boys now #

585
00:52:51,967 --> 00:52:56,732
- # Playing with the big boys now #
- Oh, that's pretty.

586
00:52:56,767 --> 00:53:01,047
- # Every spell and gesture #
- # Tells you who's the best #

587
00:53:01,082 --> 00:53:07,464
# You're playing with
the big boys now #

588
00:53:07,499 --> 00:53:13,847
# You're playing with
the big boys now. #

589
00:53:13,882 --> 00:53:15,967
# Stop this
foolish mission #

590
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,724
# Watch a true magician #

591
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:21,332
# Give an exhibition how #

592
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,572
# Pick up your
silly twig, boy #

593
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:26,687
# You're playing with
the big boys now #

594
00:53:26,722 --> 00:53:29,767
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- # By the power of Ra #

595
00:53:29,802 --> 00:53:31,784
# Mut, Nut #

596
00:53:31,819 --> 00:53:33,732
# Khnum, Ptah #

597
00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:37,772
# Sobek, Sekhmet
Sokar, Selket #

598
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:41,367
# Anubis, Anukis, Hemsut
Tefnut, Meshkent, Mafdet #

599
00:53:41,402 --> 00:53:49,132
# You're playing with
the big boys now #

600
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:53,167
# By the might of Horus
you will kneel before us #

601
00:53:53,202 --> 00:53:56,532
# Kneel to our
splendorous power #

602
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,087
- # You put up a front #
- # You put up a fight #

603
00:53:58,122 --> 00:54:00,207
# And &ust to show
we feel no spite #

604
00:54:00,242 --> 00:54:02,092
# You can be our acolyte #

605
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:05,607
- # But first, boy it's time to bow #
- # Kowtow #

606
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,007
# Or it's your own grave
you'll dig, boy #

607
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:09,892
# You're playing with
the big boys #

608
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:16,407
# Playing with the big boys
Playing with the big boys #

609
00:54:16,442 --> 00:54:19,607
# Playing with
the big boys now ##

610
00:54:19,642 --> 00:54:21,727
They love it.

611
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:40,927
All right, Moses.
I know you.

612
00:54:40,962 --> 00:54:43,687
What's this really about?

613
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:47,447
Rameses, look.

614
00:54:47,482 --> 00:54:50,247
What do you see?

615
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:57,527
A greater Egypt
than that of my father.

616
00:54:57,562 --> 00:55:00,092
That is not
what I see.

617
00:55:00,127 --> 00:55:04,532
Moses, I cannot
change what you see.

618
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:08,007
I have to maintain
the ancient traditions.

619
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:11,184
I bear the weight
of my father's crown.

620
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:14,327
Do you still not understand
what Seti was?

621
00:55:14,362 --> 00:55:17,452
He was
a great leader.

622
00:55:17,487 --> 00:55:21,007
His hands bore the blood
of thousands of children.

623
00:55:21,042 --> 00:55:22,764
Hmph.
Slaves.

624
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,452
My people.

625
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:28,687
And I can no longer hide
in the desert while they suffer...

626
00:55:28,722 --> 00:55:30,807
at your hands.

627
00:55:33,607 --> 00:55:36,092
So...

628
00:55:36,127 --> 00:55:38,747
you have returned...

629
00:55:38,782 --> 00:55:41,367
only to free them.

630
00:55:51,487 --> 00:55:53,767
I'm sorry.

631
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:03,727
Yes.

632
00:56:05,207 --> 00:56:08,127
I had hoped...

633
00:56:08,162 --> 00:56:09,967
that-

634
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:23,847
I do not know this God.

635
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:26,927
Neither will I
let your people go.

636
00:56:26,962 --> 00:56:29,504
Rameses, please,
you must listen-

637
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:32,047
I will not be
the weak link!

638
00:56:39,407 --> 00:56:42,227
Tell your people
as of today...

639
00:56:42,262 --> 00:56:45,047
their workload
has been doubled,

640
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:46,927
thanks to your God.

641
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:51,127
Or is it thanks...

642
00:56:51,162 --> 00:56:53,007
to you?

643
00:56:57,727 --> 00:57:00,327
It's Moses.

644
00:57:02,407 --> 00:57:04,667
Moses! Ohh.

645
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:06,892
So, Moses,

646
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:10,367
how does it feel when you
get struck to the ground?

647
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:14,567
I didn't mean
to cause you more pain.

648
00:57:14,602 --> 00:57:17,372
I'm &ust trying to do
as God told me.

649
00:57:17,407 --> 00:57:21,012
God? When did God start
caring about any of us?

650
00:57:21,047 --> 00:57:24,307
In fact, Moses, when did you start
caring about slaves?

651
00:57:24,342 --> 00:57:27,567
Was it when you found out
that you were one of us?

652
00:57:27,602 --> 00:57:30,144
Don't listen to him.

653
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:32,572
No, he's-
he's right.

654
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:36,492
I did not see because
I did not wish to see.

655
00:57:36,527 --> 00:57:39,372
Oh, you didn't see because
you didn't wish to see.

656
00:57:39,407 --> 00:57:42,447
Ah! Well, that makes everything
fine then, doesn't it?

657
00:57:42,482 --> 00:57:44,292
Aaron!

658
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,767
You shame yourself.

659
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:51,567
Miriam.

660
00:57:53,447 --> 00:57:56,047
I'm so sorry.

661
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:06,532
Moses,

662
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,892
hear what I say.

663
00:58:08,927 --> 00:58:11,247
I have been a slave...

664
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:13,212
all my life,

665
00:58:13,247 --> 00:58:17,527
and God has never
answered my prayers until now.

666
00:58:17,562 --> 00:58:19,292
God saved you
from the river,

667
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:22,172
He saved you
in all your wanderings,

668
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,367
and even now He saves you
from the wrath of Pharaoh.

669
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:28,247
God will not abandon you,

670
00:58:29,527 --> 00:58:31,967
so don't you abandon us.

671
00:59:03,287 --> 00:59:05,727
Miriam.
Where are you going?

672
00:59:05,762 --> 00:59:07,647
M- Miriam.

673
00:59:20,647 --> 00:59:23,487
The ball disappears.
Where is it? In his hand.

674
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,647
Rameses!

675
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:32,567
Let my people go!

676
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:37,407
Still gnawing away
at that bone, are we?

677
00:59:37,442 --> 00:59:38,892
Carry on.

678
00:59:38,927 --> 00:59:41,052
You cannot
keep ignoring us.

679
00:59:41,087 --> 00:59:45,247
Enough! I will hear no more
of this Hebrew nonsense.

680
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:47,087
Bring him to me.

681
00:59:48,847 --> 00:59:50,927
- Moses!
- No!

682
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:07,527
Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.

683
01:00:34,727 --> 01:00:36,612
Father.

684
01:00:36,647 --> 01:00:38,747
- It's-
- Blood!

685
01:00:38,782 --> 01:00:40,847
Blood! Oh, blood!

686
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:54,852
Hotep! Huy!
Explain this to me!

687
01:00:54,887 --> 01:00:57,332
- Ah!
- Rest assured, Your Ma&esty-

688
01:00:57,367 --> 01:01:00,287
Uh, yes, we were going to
demonstrate the superior might...

689
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:02,127
of our gods.

690
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:03,647
Uh-

691
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,167
By the power of Ra!

692
01:01:23,207 --> 01:01:26,127
Abandon this futile mission,
Moses.

693
01:01:26,162 --> 01:01:29,464
I've indulged you
long enough.

694
01:01:29,499 --> 01:01:32,767
This must now
be finished.

695
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:36,932
No, Rameses.

696
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:39,212
It is only beginning.

697
01:01:39,247 --> 01:01:42,367
But, Moses, d-didn't you
see what happened?

698
01:01:42,402 --> 01:01:45,012
The priests
did the same thing.

699
01:01:45,047 --> 01:01:47,967
Pharaoh still has the power
over our lives.

700
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:53,887
Yes, Aaron, it's true.
Pharaoh has the power.

701
01:01:55,167 --> 01:02:00,647
He can take away your food,
your home, your freedom.

702
01:02:00,682 --> 01:02:05,087
He can take away
your sons and daughters.

703
01:02:05,122 --> 01:02:07,212
With one word,

704
01:02:07,247 --> 01:02:10,207
Pharaoh can take away
your very lives.

705
01:02:12,047 --> 01:02:15,927
But there is one thing
he cannot take away from you:

706
01:02:15,962 --> 01:02:17,767
your faith.

707
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:21,892
Believe,

708
01:02:21,927 --> 01:02:24,687
for we will see
God's wonders.

709
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:36,132
# Thus saith the Lord #

710
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:38,412
# Since you refuse
to free my people #

711
01:02:38,447 --> 01:02:41,567
- # Since you refuse to free my people #
- # Since you refuse #

712
01:02:41,602 --> 01:02:43,944
# All through
the land of Egypt #

713
01:02:43,979 --> 01:02:45,773
# I send a pestilence, a plague #

714
01:02:45,808 --> 01:02:47,532
# Into your house, into your bed #

715
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:49,607
- # Into your streams Into your streets #
- Hmm.

716
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:51,684
# Into your drink
Into your bread #

717
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:53,703
# Upon your cattle, on your sheep #

718
01:02:53,738 --> 01:02:55,652
# Upon your oxen
in your field #

719
01:02:55,687 --> 01:02:58,087
# Into your dreams, into your sleep #

720
01:02:58,122 --> 01:03:00,487
# Until you break
Until you yield #

721
01:03:00,522 --> 01:03:02,492
# I send the swarm #

722
01:03:02,527 --> 01:03:08,207
# I send the horde
Thus saith the Lord #

723
01:03:09,127 --> 01:03:11,092
# Once I called you brother #

724
01:03:11,127 --> 01:03:14,287
# Once I thought the chance
to make you laugh #

725
01:03:14,322 --> 01:03:15,847
# Was all I ever wanted #

726
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:17,807
# I send the thunder
from the sky #

727
01:03:17,842 --> 01:03:19,692
# I send the fire
raining down #

728
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:23,247
# And even now I wish
that God had chose another #

729
01:03:23,282 --> 01:03:26,007
# Serving as your foe
on His behalf #

730
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:27,572
# Is the last thing #

731
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:29,527
- # That I wanted #
- # I send a hail of burning ice #

732
01:03:29,562 --> 01:03:32,207
# On every field
On every town #

733
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:34,452
# This was my home #

734
01:03:34,487 --> 01:03:39,527
# All this pain and devastation
how it tortures me inside #

735
01:03:39,562 --> 01:03:41,647
# All the innocent
who suffer #

736
01:03:41,682 --> 01:03:43,252
# From your stubbornness #

737
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:45,447
- # And pride #
- # I send the locusts on the wind #

738
01:03:45,482 --> 01:03:47,404
# Such as the world
has never seen #

739
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:49,292
# On every leaf
On every stalk #

740
01:03:49,327 --> 01:03:52,407
# Until there's nothing left
of green #

741
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:55,487
# I send my scourge
I send my sword #

742
01:03:55,522 --> 01:03:56,887
# Thus saith the Lord #

743
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,572
# You who I called brother #

744
01:03:58,607 --> 01:04:02,147
# Why must you call down another blow #

745
01:04:02,182 --> 01:04:05,532
# I send my scourge
I send my sword #

746
01:04:05,567 --> 01:04:08,887
- # Let my people go #
- # Thus saith the Lord #

747
01:04:08,922 --> 01:04:15,447
# Thus saith the Lord #

748
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,572
# You who I called brother #

749
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,607
# How could you have come
to hate me so #

750
01:04:23,642 --> 01:04:25,047
# Is this what you wanted #

751
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,667
# I sent the swarm
I sent the horde #

752
01:04:27,702 --> 01:04:30,212
# Then let my heart
be hardened #

753
01:04:30,247 --> 01:04:33,047
# And never mind
how high the cost may grow #

754
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:35,287
# This will still be so #

755
01:04:35,322 --> 01:04:38,164
# I will never let #

756
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:40,892
# Your people go #

757
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:45,052
# Thus saith the Lord #

758
01:04:45,087 --> 01:04:48,847
- # I will not let #
- & Let #

759
01:04:48,882 --> 01:04:52,607
- # Your people #
- # My people #

760
01:04:52,642 --> 01:04:57,047
- # Go ##
- # Go ##

761
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:44,167
Rameses?

762
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:48,132
Rameses?

763
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:50,127
Oh. Let me guess.

764
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:54,267
You want me to...

765
01:05:54,302 --> 01:05:56,887
let your people go.

766
01:05:59,567 --> 01:06:01,967
I hoped
I would find you here.

767
01:06:02,002 --> 01:06:04,367
Get out!

768
01:06:05,887 --> 01:06:10,487
Rameses, we must
bring this to an end.

769
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:18,387
Rameses, please,
talk to me.

770
01:06:18,422 --> 01:06:21,527
We could always
talk here.

771
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:32,327
This place.

772
01:06:33,767 --> 01:06:35,727
So many memories.

773
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:41,492
I remember the time you...

774
01:06:41,527 --> 01:06:44,967
switched the heads of the gods
of the temple of Ra.

775
01:06:48,607 --> 01:06:50,492
If I recall correctly,

776
01:06:50,527 --> 01:06:54,887
you were there switching heads
right along with me.

777
01:06:55,727 --> 01:06:58,287
No, it was you.
I didn't do that.

778
01:06:58,322 --> 01:07:00,132
Oh, yes, you did.

779
01:07:00,167 --> 01:07:02,767
You put the hippo on the crocodile,
and the crocodile-

780
01:07:02,802 --> 01:07:04,612
- On the falcon.
- Yes!

781
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:08,087
The priest thought it was a horrible
omen and fasted for two months.

782
01:07:08,122 --> 01:07:11,287
Father was furious. You were
always getting me into trouble.

783
01:07:18,087 --> 01:07:20,047
But then-

784
01:07:21,967 --> 01:07:25,087
you were always there
to...

785
01:07:25,122 --> 01:07:28,207
get me out of trouble
again.

786
01:07:28,242 --> 01:07:30,047
Hmmph.

787
01:07:34,327 --> 01:07:37,727
Why can't things be
the way they were before?

788
01:07:39,127 --> 01:07:40,772
Father.

789
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,727
It's so dark.

790
01:07:44,007 --> 01:07:46,327
I'm frightened.

791
01:07:47,247 --> 01:07:49,087
Why is he here?

792
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:55,567
Isn't that the man
who did all this?

793
01:07:57,287 --> 01:07:59,652
Yes.

794
01:07:59,687 --> 01:08:02,607
But one must wonder...

795
01:08:02,642 --> 01:08:04,372
why.

796
01:08:04,407 --> 01:08:09,332
Because no kingdom should be made
on the backs of slaves.

797
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:13,607
Rameses, your stubbornness
is bringing this misery upon Egypt.

798
01:08:13,642 --> 01:08:16,684
It would cease if only you
would let the Hebrews go.

799
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,083
I will not be dictated to.
I will not be threatened.

800
01:08:20,118 --> 01:08:23,292
I am the morning
and the evening star. I am Pharaoh.

801
01:08:23,327 --> 01:08:27,447
Something else is coming. Something
much worse than anything before.

802
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:30,444
Please, let go of
your contempt for life...

803
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,407
before it destroys
everything you hold dear.

804
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,407
Think of your son!

805
01:08:35,442 --> 01:08:37,252
I do.

806
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:40,292
You Hebrews have been
nothing but trouble.

807
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:43,887
My father had the right idea
about how to deal with your people.

808
01:08:43,922 --> 01:08:47,652
- Rameses- - And I think
it's time I finished the &ob.

809
01:08:47,687 --> 01:08:52,007
- Rameses! - And there shall be
a great cry in all of Egypt...

810
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:54,967
such as never has been
or ever will be again!

811
01:09:09,047 --> 01:09:12,487
Rameses, you bring this
upon yourself.

812
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:24,847
God has come
to me again, saying,

813
01:09:24,882 --> 01:09:26,652
"Take a lamb...

814
01:09:26,687 --> 01:09:29,292
and with its blood...

815
01:09:29,327 --> 01:09:33,047
mark the lintel and posts
of every door,

816
01:09:35,247 --> 01:09:38,052
for tonight...

817
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:42,487
I shall pass through
the land of Egypt...

818
01:09:42,522 --> 01:09:45,487
and smite
all the firstborn.

819
01:09:51,207 --> 01:09:54,647
But when I see the blood
upon your door...

820
01:09:56,087 --> 01:09:58,527
I will pass over you,

821
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:03,767
and the plague
shall not enter. "

822
01:12:33,887 --> 01:12:37,367
You
and your people...

823
01:12:37,402 --> 01:12:40,847
have my permission to go.

824
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:47,367
Leave me!

825
01:14:17,407 --> 01:14:20,967
# Many nights we've prayed #

826
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:23,564
# With no proof #

827
01:14:23,599 --> 01:14:26,052
# Anyone could hear #

828
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:29,847
# In our hearts
a hopeful song #

829
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:34,184
# We barely understood #

830
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:38,372
# Now we are not afraid #

831
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:43,287
# Although we know
there's much to fear #

832
01:14:43,322 --> 01:14:46,412
# We were moving mountains #

833
01:14:46,447 --> 01:14:52,447
# Long before
we knew we could #

834
01:14:52,482 --> 01:14:56,167
# There can be miracles #

835
01:14:56,202 --> 01:14:59,644
# When you believe #

836
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:02,803
# Though hope is frail #

837
01:15:02,838 --> 01:15:05,927
# It's hard to kill #

838
01:15:07,607 --> 01:15:11,607
# Who knows what miracles #

839
01:15:11,642 --> 01:15:14,944
# You can achieve #

840
01:15:14,979 --> 01:15:19,113
# When you believe #

841
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:22,797
# Somehow you will #

842
01:15:22,832 --> 01:15:26,447
# You will when you #

843
01:15:26,482 --> 01:15:29,487
# Believe #

844
01:15:30,607 --> 01:15:34,252
# In this time of fear #

845
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:38,087
# When prayers so often
proved in vain #

846
01:15:38,122 --> 01:15:41,887
# Hope seemed like
the summer birds #

847
01:15:41,922 --> 01:15:45,572
# Too swiftly flown away #

848
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:49,687
- # Yet now I'm standing here #
- # Now I'm standing here #

849
01:15:49,722 --> 01:15:53,564
# With heart so full
I can't explain #

850
01:15:53,599 --> 01:15:57,407
# Seeking faith
and speaking words #

851
01:15:57,442 --> 01:16:01,664
# I never thought I'd say #

852
01:16:01,699 --> 01:16:05,732
# There can be miracles #

853
01:16:05,767 --> 01:16:09,407
- # When you believe #
- # When you believe #

854
01:16:09,442 --> 01:16:12,572
# Though hope is frail #

855
01:16:12,607 --> 01:16:16,847
- # It's hard to kill #
- # It's hard to kill #

856
01:16:16,882 --> 01:16:20,692
# Who knows what miracles #

857
01:16:20,727 --> 01:16:24,567
- # You can achieve #
- # You can achieve #

858
