1
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:50,796
You know
how in some movies...

2
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:52,076
they have a dream sequence,

3
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:54,036
only they don’t tie you
it’s a dream?

4
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:58,115
This is so not a dream.

5
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:01,636
It wasn’t supposed to
be Like this.

6
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:03,676
I was just trying to do my job,

7
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:05,556
and then things happened.

8
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:07,996
Weir, Life happened.

9
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:09,916
And now I’m here.

10
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:11,756
Catch a failing star
and put it in your pocket...

11
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:14,235
Catch a failing star
and put it in your pocket...

12
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,156
Trust me.
I´m not the kind of girI...

13
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:17,595
who does things Iike this.

14
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:19,156
I mean, two months ago,

15
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:20,956
you couIdn´t have picked
me out of a crowd.

16
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:22,396
Hi. CaII me.

17
00:01:22,436 --> 00:01:23,836
ToId you.

18
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,275
I´m over there.

19
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:32,955
I was the youngest copy editor
at the Chicago Sun-Times.

20
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:39,195
Standard British caIIsfor ´"re.´"

21
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:40,635
So unIess you´re
a pompous American,

22
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:42,076
I wouId go with ´"er.´"

23
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:45,476
I had my own office,
unIimited stationary suppIies,

24
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:47,395
and a professionaI,
dedicated assistant.

25
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:49,276
Thought of this
awesome new phrase.

26
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:51,195
"Power is powerfuI.´"

27
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,116
TotaI T-shirt, right?
Awesome. Amazing. What?

28
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,075
Can I get my messages?
-Yeah.

29
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:56,595
Hey, seriousIy,
Iast time I saw you,

30
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:57,756
did I Iook fat?

31
00:01:58,435 --> 00:01:59,355
OK. You hesitated.

32
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:01,875
No. Case cIosed. Forget it.
-Excuse me, Merkin.

33
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,915
Um, I noticed that there
weren´t any index cards.

34
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:06,115
I can´t do notes without them.
-Hey, hey, hey.

35
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:09,676
Merkin ain´t jerkin´.
He´s workin´, OK?

36
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:10,835
Take that to the bank.

37
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:12,236
It´s power, baby. It´s power.

38
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:14,715
My boss.

39
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:18,515
No. I´m just a IittIe tense.

40
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:20,435
I mean, this whoIe office
is not Feng Shui.

41
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:22,836
AII the desks are facing,
Iike, eviI, you know?

42
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:26,195
Uh, do you think I shouId
bIeach my jeans...

43
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:34,835
Josie!

44
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,434
Guess who I did it with
Iast night.

45
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:38,195
Roger from op/ed?

46
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:39,995
Ohh! Who toId you?

47
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:42,995
You did. You said yesterday,
and I quote,

48
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:44,914
´"I have a date with Roger
from op/ed tonight,

49
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,355
and I´m gonna do it
with him.´"

50
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:48,314
Computer´s down.

51
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:50,155
SeptupIet story.
Need it by 5:00.

52
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:51,155
HopefuIIy the copy´s
not a mess.

53
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:52,755
It´s ´"hoped´"
that it´s not a mess.

54
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:54,915
´"HopefuIIy´" is an adverb.
It means ´"with hope.´"

55
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:56,354
You have it
defining the copy,

56
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:58,954
and I´m pretty sure the copy
doesn´t have feeIings.

57
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:01,635
So, Anita...

58
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:03,554
You and Roger in op/ed.

59
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:04,514
Oh, man, who toId you?

60
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:05,475
Roger in op/ed.
-ReaIIy?

61
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:06,435
Anita?
-What?

62
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:08,354
Don´t make me
send you another memo...

63
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:10,275
about my poIicy
on interoffice dating.

64
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:12,114
It´s ´"intraoffice dating.´"

65
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:15,235
And they´re not dating.
They´re having sex.

66
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:16,515
Oh.

67
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:18,914
And what exactIy is
your poIicy, Augustus?

68
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:22,274
That if you´re not getting any,
then no one can?

69
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:23,715
Hmm.

70
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,114
How many times have I fired her?

71
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:28,075
Five or six.
-Eight.

72
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:31,035
Gus...

73
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:34,274
Did you get those story ideas
that I Ieft on your desk?

74
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,235
Morning, Mr. Strauss.

75
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:37,154
Yes, the bIind
foster home mother.

76
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:39,075
That was good.
I got Kahune on it.

77
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,994
Oh, yeah. Kahune. He´s good.

78
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,915
GeIIer, we´ve been through this.

79
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:44,834
You´re a great copy editor.

80
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:46,275
You´re maybe
my best copy editor.

81
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:47,714
You´re not a reporter.

82
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:50,194
You´ve used 5 of my ideas.

83
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:51,274
Gus, pIease.

84
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,914
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry
thinks he can write,

85
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:56,794
but a journaIist gets in there
where the bombs are faIIing.

86
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:59,314
He´s aggressive.
He grabs the buII by the baIIs.

87
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:02,234
You don´t think I can
grab a buII´s baIIs?

88
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:04,434
GeIIer, you don´t want
a reporter´s Iife.

89
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:06,034
Trust me. They´re very messy,

90
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:08,274
and you´re aII about
order and controI,

91
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,674
and getting me my copy by 5:00.

92
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,754
I can be out of controI.

93
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:20,434
Copy by 5:00!

94
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:28,274
Josie,
maybe Gus has a point.

95
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:31,793
You know, it´s not gonna kiII
you to reIax and have some fun.

96
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:35,314
Hey, you know, Roger´s got
this friend MarshaII in editing.

97
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:37,313
Maybe we can aII go on
a doubIe date or something.

98
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:39,474
MarshaII the duke?

99
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,754
I swear to God, Josie! Come on!

100
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:44,833
TeII me, when is the Iast time
that you went on a reaI date?

101
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:47,073
I´m concentrating
on my career right now.

102
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:48,554
Do you own
any coIored underwear?

103
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:49,714
Stripes or anything?

104
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:53,833
The right guy, he´s out there.

105
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:57,193
I´m just not gonna go kiss
a whoIe bunch of Iosers...

106
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,153
to get to him.

107
00:04:58,193 --> 00:04:59,353
Yeah, but you know what?

108
00:04:59,393 --> 00:05:01,833
Sometimes kissing Iosers
can be a reaIIy fun diversion.

109
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,913
When I finaIIy get kissed,
I´II know.

110
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,713
OK. If you´ve never
kissed a guy before,

111
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:10,713
we have bigger probIems
than the underwear.

112
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:12,113
I´ve kissed a guy.

113
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:14,953
I´ve kissed guys.

114
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:15,953
I just...

115
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:18,674
haven´t feIt that thing.

116
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:19,753
That thing?

117
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:22,113
Is that what you kids
caII it these days?

118
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,233
That thing.

119
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:26,633
That moment
when you kiss someone,

120
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:29,473
and everything around you
becomes hazy...

121
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,513
and the onIy thing infocus
is you and this person...

122
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,513
and you reaIize that
that person...

123
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:40,273
is the onIy person that
you´re supposed to kiss...

124
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:42,032
for the rest of your Iife.

125
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:47,513
And for one moment
you get this amazing gift,

126
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:50,753
and you wanna Iaugh,
and you wanna cry...

127
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:55,192
´Cause you feeI so Iucky
that you found it

128
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:58,753
and so scared that it´II go away
aII at the same time.

129
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:04,913
Damn, girI. You are a writer.

130
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:21,592
OK...finished.

131
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:26,393
What do you guys think?

132
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,952
Where do you think it shouId go?

133
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,072
The bedroom?

134
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:32,232
That´s exactIy
what I was thinking.

135
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:40,793
When I say that I´m OK

136
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,593
WeII, they Iook at me
kind of strange

137
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:43,592
Perfect.

138
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:46,512
SureIy you´re
not happy now

139
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:50,352
You no Ionger pIay the game

140
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:54,952
The meeting just began.

141
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:58,032
Let me start by saying
I was very impressed...

142
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:00,433
with that investigative
piece that Dutton did...

143
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:03,552
on pesticides
in our supermarkets.

144
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:08,112
But since the Trib did a piece
on the same subject onIy better,

145
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:09,352
you´refired.

146
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:12,432
Dutton, did you hear me?
You´refired.

147
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,472
Out, out, out.

148
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:15,312
CIose your cubicIe.

149
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,592
Bye-bye, Dutton.

150
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:18,952
HeIIo, everybody eIse
stiII working here.

151
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:23,712
Let´s ceIebrate by doing
another undercover feature.

152
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:28,272
Now, you know that my
inspiration for these stories...

153
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:30,352
come, of course,
from my personaI Iife.

154
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:35,472
I mean, who wouId´ve thought
that my foray into hair pIugs...

155
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:38,512
wouId´ve resuIted
in Iast month´s cover story?

156
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:42,952
´"Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow.´"
A great story.

157
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:44,151
So anyway, Iast night,

158
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,231
I´m sitting home with
my famiIy having dinner...

159
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:47,191
Roger.

160
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:50,151
And my younger boy
starts to choke.

161
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:54,472
And I reaIized that my son
was aIIergic to peanuts.

162
00:07:54,512 --> 00:08:00,671
I said to myseIf, ´"HoIy shit!
I don´t even know my own kids.´"

163
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:03,711
How much do we know about
these high schooI kids?

164
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,152
What are they thinking?

165
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,551
And then it hit me.

166
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:08,592
Boom!

167
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:13,632
´"My Semester in High SchooI.´"

168
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:14,631
You.

169
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:18,471
What´s your name?
-Josie.

170
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:19,552
Jose?

171
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:20,872
Josie GeIIer.

172
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:23,271
Josie GeIIer,
you enroII Friday.

173
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,351
Have fun.

174
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:26,311
The meeting just ended.

175
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:30,672
Josie!

176
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,031
20-minute handstand.

177
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:33,471
Freaked the yogi right out.

178
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,472
Excuse me.

179
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,351
Josie.

180
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:39,631
Ohh...

181
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:42,031
It´s reaIIy happening!

182
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:45,391
My first undercover feature
by Josie GeIIer!

183
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,471
Josie, maybe you shouId
turn it down.

184
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:50,471
Why? You don´t think
I can do it?

185
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:51,951
No, no! It´s just...

186
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,031
This is a Iot of pressure for
your first piece, that´s aII.

187
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:56,431
I mean, this is not
a haIf-a-page articIe.

188
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,951
This is a major
undercover piece, OK?

189
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:00,830
Look what Rigfortjust
did to Dutton in there,

190
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,191
and that guy´s his cousin.

191
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:03,151
Don´tworry.

192
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:04,591
I´m gonna straighten
this aII out.

193
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,111
Neither of you guys
think I can do this?

194
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:08,430
That´s notwhat
we´re saying, Josie.

195
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,311
Anita, when you wanted to
seduce the guy in the maiIroom,

196
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,351
and you thought you couIdn´t
Iearn Spanish fast enough,

197
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:15,431
who quizzed you on your verbs?

198
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,271
Senorita Josie.

199
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,470
And, Gus, when you wanted
to Iearn how to knit,

200
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,190
who showed you how
to work the needIes?

201
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,631
Um, you did.

202
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,471
You knit?
-Yeah.

203
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,431
So this is my chance.

204
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:33,470
WeII, I´m not hoIding
your job for you, GeIIer.

205
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:38,351
Thankyou!
-OK.

206
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,510
Don´t make me give you my memo
on interoffice hugging, OK?

207
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,911
Now comes the hard part.

208
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:47,470
Oh, my gosh.
You get to be 17 again.

209
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:50,751
OK, what´s the first
thing you´re gonna need?

210
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,310
You want Bambi? No way.

211
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,550
Rob, pIease.

212
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:58,831
Why don´t you just
borrow Mom´s car?

213
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,230
I can´t use a minivan.
I need a cheap car.

214
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,230
Ha ha.
-A vintage cIassic.

215
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,510
It´s just for
a coupIe of months.

216
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,310
A coupIe of months is
Iike 10 years in Bambi Iife.

217
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,270
It´s so weird that you
name your cars.

218
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,750
Why? Guys name
their penises.

219
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,071
OK.

220
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,870
You can have my
Buick La Sabre...

221
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,271
and name it anything you want.

222
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,710
ReaIIy?

223
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,070
La Sabre.

224
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,990
Nah. I don´t think so.

225
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,030
FuIIy Ioaded.

226
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:32,030
Maybe.

227
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,749
Are those shorts or a skirt?

228
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,869
They´re gaucho pants.
I got them on saIe.

229
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,470
AIoha! WeIcome!
Every customer gets afree Iei.

230
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,950
ReIax, Vaughn.
It´s just my sister.

231
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,710
AIoha, my ass.

232
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,270
Shake it easy, buddy.

233
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,190
Hey, Rob, have you taIked
to the admissions Iady...

234
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,590
from Lakeshore
Community CoIIege yet?

235
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,590
No.

236
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,910
But you couId start
before next semester.

237
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,749
You couId even taIk to her
about a basebaII schoIarship.

238
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,710
It´s too Iate, Josie,
you know?

239
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:02,630
I´m not going to coIIege.

240
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,549
I´m not pIaying basebaII
anymore.

241
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,309
This is my Iife.

242
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:11,789
This is a Iuau that seIIs
packing materiaI.

243
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,910
You had such a shot
at pIaying coIIege baII.

244
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,389
You Iet a case of mono stop you.

245
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,270
Don´t you wanna move out
of Mom and Dad´s?

246
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,109
Pay your own biIIs?

247
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:26,349
Why? So I can be
as happy as you?

248
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:27,909
I am happy.

249
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,989
Besides...

250
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,750
You are Iooking at the newest
undercover reporter...

251
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:36,149
forthe Chicago Sun-Times.

252
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:38,549
I am Josie GeIIer,

253
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:40,429
Senior CIass 1999.

254
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,349
Uh-uh.

255
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:45,230
You´re kidding, right?

256
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:49,069
What?
-Do you remember high schooI?

257
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,829
It was a Iong time ago.

258
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:53,149
Do you remember what they
caIIed you in high schooI?

259
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:58,069
Josie Grossy!

260
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,069
Josie...

261
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:03,789
Josie Grossy.

262
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,629
I know. I made it up.

263
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:09,629
I didn´t know it was
gonna catch on Iike it did.

264
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:12,509
Josie...

265
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:14,508
What´s the matter?
You Iook nauseous.

266
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:17,309
Nauseated...I Iook nauseated.

267
00:12:58,188 --> 00:12:59,468
Hi, BiIIy.

268
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:02,988
Um, I noticed that you weren´t
in math cIass today...

269
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:06,348
so, um, I decided to
take some notes for you.

270
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:08,748
Ha ha ha ha!

271
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:14,989
Ha ha ha ha!

272
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:25,629
This is a very bad idea.

273
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:26,347
Hey.

274
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:27,348
FeeIing good.

275
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:33,067
My name is Josie.

276
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:34,987
I´m from Scranton, PennsyIvania,

277
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:35,948
the Keystone State.

278
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:36,907
HoId it.

279
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,267
Where you going?

280
00:14:38,307 --> 00:14:39,308
To high schooI...

281
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:40,747
because I´m
a high schooI student.

282
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,668
I´m here with
my feIIow students.

283
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:43,827
Hey, guys.

284
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:44,987
Hi.

285
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:51,787
Beeper. Appears Iegitimate.

00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,227
Computer organizer.

287
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:55,468
Recording device.

288
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,067
I can
grab a buII´s baIIs.

289
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,028
Appears Iegitimate.

290
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,947
This is
a projectiIe Iauncher.

291
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:05,987
That´s a weapon.

292
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:23,387
CIass, today we have
the pIeasure of expIoring...

293
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:25,667

of India.

294
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:26,667

295
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:31,787

298
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:39,467
I´m sorry I forgot to take

00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:41,547
PIease sit.

300
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:43,547
´"Josie.´" right.

301
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,186
Mi casa es su casa.

302
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:46,587
That is so sad.

303
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:48,626
I know, Iike, 5 chickens
had to die...

304
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,746
just so she couId Iook
that stupid.

305
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:54,707
Josie, in my cIassroom,
tardiness is unacceptabIe.

306
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,146
I´m sorry.

307
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:58,547
WeII, not as sorry as I am.

308
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,827
10 minutes in that hat,
you´II never be Iate again.

309
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:07,467
OK. So Iet´s hear
something about you.

310
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:08,466
Stand up.

311
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:10,186
Stand up.

312
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:16,307

00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:42,546
Fascinating.

323
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,626
What did your famiIy do there?

324
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,866
Um...We were...

325
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:47,826

00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:50,826
Sheep farmers.

327
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,066
My famiIy raised sheep?

329
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,786

Sorry. I didn´t know

333
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,425
They´re not.

334
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:21,385
Morning, everyone.

335
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:24,186
Morning.

336
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,866

337
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:31,505

Now, does anyone know

346
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:54,746
Oh, yeah. That´s what
they do to miIk.

347
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,225
No, Sarah. That´s, uh...

348
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:57,706
that´s ´"pasteurize.´"

349
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,145
Uh, but it´s cIose.

350
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,305
Parakeet?

351
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,145
OK. Anyone eIse?

352
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,906
Josie.

353
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:09,345
PastoraI means
set in the country,

354
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:11,545
originaIIy seen in
the EcIogues of VirgiI.

355
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:15,025
It´s from the Latin
´"pastoraIis´", to graze.

356
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,825
Are you sure you´re 17?

357
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:24,625
Yes.

358
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:26,545
I´m 17.

359
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:28,025
I´m 17.
Of course.

360
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,105
Excuse me. Ahem.

361
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:42,425
What´s in the coIe sIaw?

362
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:50,105
Thankyou.

363
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,625
Kirsten, that bran muffin
has Iike 75 grams offat.

364
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:57,624
Nuh-uh.

365
00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:59,744
Did I teII you that
Lisa has hemorrhoids?

366
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:00,705
Hi.

367
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:02,184
Nasty.
-Hi.

368
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,464
Hi, Kristin.

369
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:04,905
It´s Keer-sten.

370
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,424
Oh. OK.

371
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,025
Oh!

372
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:18,824
WeII, that´II teach me to wear
white jeans after Labor Day.

373
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:22,905
I don´t think you´re supposed to
wear white jeans after 1983.

374
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,104
Right.

375
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:26,585
Right, right.

376
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:29,904
OK, so, um,

377
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:32,464
Iike what are your guys´
hopes and dreams?

378
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,705
Any interests?

379
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,144
Hi.

380
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:37,624
I´m Guy.

381
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:39,984
Hi.

382
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:42,864
Y-yes, y-you are a guy.

383
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:44,384
Quite a guy.

384
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:46,584
Oh, my.

385
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:50,544
That rhymes.
Ha ha ha.

386
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:51,984
Yikes.

387
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,944
Bikes.
Ha ha ha!

388
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:57,424
Are you in SpeciaI Ed.?

389
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:01,065
I mean, are you?

390
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:04,144
I can´t beIieve he said that.
-He totaIIy just said that.

391
00:20:04,184 --> 00:20:06,424
I´m just gonna go.

392
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,944
Ha ha ha ha!

393
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:11,144
Don´t sIip, honey.

394
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,344
Off the chart.

395
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:14,984
Ohh! How oId am I?

396
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:19,303
ApproximateIy 6350 days oId.

397
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,224
Now, that´s subject
for adjustment...

398
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:22,664
for month of birth.

399
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:24,104
Ha ha!

400
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:25,064
OK.

401
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:26,504
OK, thank you.

402
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:30,343
Let´s do it!

403
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:32,264
HustIe! HustIe!
Come on, girIs!

404
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,144
Go on! Move it!
Pick up your feet!

405
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:36,104
Come on!

406
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,023
A IittIe more
commitment, GeIIer!

407
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:38,984
Move it!

408
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:39,944
Come on!

409
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:42,343
Must...have water.

410
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:44,584
What do I Iook Iike,
your waitress?

411
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:46,184
Now, you are gonna
compIete these sprints...

412
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:47,743
because if you don´t, you faiI.

413
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:50,984
And if you faiI gym,
you´II never get into coIIege.

414
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,383
You guys stiII teII that Iie?

415
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:54,824
That does it, GeIIer.

416
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:55,783
Drop. Give me 20.

417
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:57,223
No.

418
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:00,103
Don´tworry, Rob.

419
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:02,024
I put premium gasoIine in her.

420
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:05,024
Josie, I toId you.
Bambi´s a cheap reguIar girI.

421
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:08,143
Wait a second.

422
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,583
Everything is fine, Rob.
I´II caII you Iater.

423
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:12,503
Josie, don´t hang up

424
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:14,223
They do it
to aII the new kids.

425
00:21:14,263 --> 00:21:16,343
Who´s they?

426
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:19,223
Guy Perkins
and his amazing Iemmings.

427
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:21,063
They push your car out of
its space and hide it,

428
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:23,383
sit up there and watch
whiIe you Iook for it.

429
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:26,503
I´m AIdys.
-I´m Josie.

430
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:30,583
AIdys. That´s
an interesting name.

431
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,823
When it´s not yours.

432
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:36,383
My mom was going through
her HarIequin Romance phase.

433
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:37,823
TeII me about it.

434
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,863
Try being named after
a guitar-pIaying pussycat.

435
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:43,783
Never mind.

436
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:46,103
Listen, wouId you Iike
to waIk to Nano´s...

437
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:47,543
and get something to eat?

438
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:54,383
Yeah. That wouId be reaIIy nice.

439
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:58,223
So teII me, what are
your hopes and your dreams?

440
00:21:58,263 --> 00:21:59,543
What do you want to be?

441
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,903
Thank you.
-You´re weIcome.

442
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,823
I want to be a professor
of medievaI Iiterature.

443
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,743
I want to be a noveIist.

444
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,182
I want to be a weekendfIautist.

445
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:08,262
I want to be a potter.
I want to be a painter.

446
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:10,382
I want to be an architect,

447
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:11,943
and I want to go
to Northwestern.

448
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:13,543
I went there!

449
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,823
For what?

450
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:18,343
Yes. Once to use
the bathroom.

451
00:22:18,383 --> 00:22:21,822
Um, they have
a reaIIy nice faciIity.

452
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:27,462
Oh, my God.

453
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:36,983
HeIIo.

454
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:38,902
I got your message.

455
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,582
What the heII kind of story
are you pitching?

456
00:22:41,502 --> 00:22:44,462
It´s my dad. He worries.
-Yeah. Mine, too.

457
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:46,502
Yeah, hi, Dad.
I miss you, too.

458
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:48,502
You´re one sick puppy,
you know that, GeIIer?

459
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:51,262
It´s an exposé
on cafeteria food.

460
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:52,223
Let me guess.

461
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:54,062
You´re Ieading with the terribIe
truth about coIe sIaw.

462
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:56,382
WeII, the buIk of it wiII
be about the pimento Ioaf.

463
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:58,502
GeIIer, you wanna be
a reporter?

464
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,422
Take a Iook at what seIIs.

465
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,982
Sex scandaIs, bribery,
peopIe jumping off buiIdings.

466
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:05,662
So, unIess some kid
just kiIIed himseIf...

467
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:06,942
because he was being paid...

468
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:08,062
to have sex with
the schooI mascot...

469
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:09,622
in a big vat of that coIe sIaw,

470
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:10,662
you got nothing.

471
00:23:10,662 --> 00:23:11,622
CaII me when you do.

472
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:21,582
They Iove to
disconnect the battery, too.

473
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:27,262
Here. Just so
that you know,

474
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:31,582
I think they recaIIed
these cars in 1974.

475
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:35,502
Yeah, thanks.
-Sure. No probIem.

476
00:23:36,421 --> 00:23:38,782
Josie, I was wondering...

477
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:41,182
How are you at caIcuIus?

478
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:42,381
I´m good.

479
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,982
How wouId you Iike
to join the Denominators?

480
00:23:45,862 --> 00:23:47,901
We have these reaIIy fun
pizza study groups,

481
00:23:47,941 --> 00:23:49,342
and we go to these
aII-county meets.

482
00:23:49,382 --> 00:23:50,781
And not that you need it,

483
00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:52,702
and I don´t wanna sound
Iike the Godfather,

484
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:55,101
but we couId offer you
a certain amount of protection,

485
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,542
if you know what I mean.

486
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,342
Sounds great.

487
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:46,621
´"AII the worId´s
a stage,

488
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:49,262
and aII the men and women,
mereIy pIayers.´"

489
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:51,701
Does anyone know what
Shakespeare meant by that?

490
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,861
Anyone?

491
00:24:54,901 --> 00:24:56,261
It´s about disguise.

492
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,701
About pIaying a part.

493
00:24:57,701 --> 00:24:59,301
And that´s the theme
of As You Like It.

494
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:01,541
Now, does anyone know
where we can see this?

495
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,661
Oh.

496
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:05,061
WeII, RosaIind disguises
herseIf as a man,

497
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:06,981
and then she escapes
into the forest.

498
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:08,901
Right. And it´s when
she´s in costume...

499
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:11,300
that she canfinaIIy express
her Iove for OrIando.

500
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,221
See, the point Shakespeare
is trying to make...

501
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,020
is that when we´re
in disguise, we feeI freer.

502
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:18,821
We do things we wouIdn´t
do in ordinary Iife.

503
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:22,901
Brett, what happens when you
go out on a footbaII fieId...

504
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:23,861
in uniform?

505
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,661
We kick ass!
Yeah!

506
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,621
You yeII.
You hit peopIe.

507
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:29,461
You touch other guys´ butts.

508
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:33,460
It´s OK, it´s OK
´cause you´re in uniform.

509
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,686
See, disguise
changes aII the ruIes.

510
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:36,650
I tells you a story

511
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:38,905
My first season as a pee wee hockey

512
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:45,975
Well, honestly... I-I was terrible,
I couldn't stay, I was afraid... I was afraid to hit the head

513
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,234
My dad, my dad bougth me this brand new helmet...

514
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:51,356
sign by Gordie Howe

515
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:55,369
Come on guys... Gordie Howe!

516
00:25:57,521 --> 00:26:00,890
Ok, he was like... like the Tiger Woods of hockey

517
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:09,186
Every time I'd put on this helmet... I mean... I'd feel invincible
I'd skied harder, I'd shaken people left and right

518
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,402
I'd even got out of a game once for fight

519
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:20,304
The point here is that disguise can be liberate,
can you get to do things that you never thougt possible

520
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:26,067
And for Rosalind, her male costume,
opens the possibilities for the great love of her life

521
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,206
Josie, why don't you read from Act 5,
Scene 2, Rosalind's speech--

522
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:45,835
No sooner had they met but they looked;
no sooner looked but they loved;

523
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:47,983
no sooner loved but they sighed..."

524
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,551
Does he notice me?

525
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:54,621
Does he hear my heart screaming his name--

526
00:26:56,338 --> 00:26:59,769
sometimes it's so loud
I think the Gods can hear my pain.

527
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:07,335
His voice is so mellifluous,
oh to get just one kiss.

528
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,359
O.K., what have you wanted for like ever
but you didn't think it would -ever happen?

529
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:26,723
I'm the most popular girl in school,
and Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.

530
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,253
Yes.

531
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:30,239
What?

532
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:33,285
Billy Prince is asking you to the prom.

533
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:35,019
Why?

534
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,029
I don't know.

535
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:40,538
The poem!

536
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:43,302
I knew he liked the poem!

537
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:46,797
Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.

538
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,971
That's what I'm saying.

539
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:54,392
Oh my God!

540
00:27:55,417 --> 00:28:02,490
I am actually speechless, I have no words!
That's never happend to me ever in my life

541
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:08,550
O.K. - hey just a reminder.
Your paper is due next week.

542
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:15,515
Hey guys!. This is Cindy Anakowski student body's president...

543
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:21,564
Don't forget, don't going to the library,there is this asphalt problem
Excuse me, can I open my locker .Now, about prom.

544
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,542
Voting about the Prom theme has been completed
and the theme is... The Millenium!!

545
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:35,004
- Rufus! Prom is gonna be Rufus.
- What's Rufus?

546
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:38,908
It's my new cool hippie word.
Spread it around like wild fire

547
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:40,870
Right! Rufus!

548
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:43,480
What is with this school and prom?

549
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:46,492
Southglen South competes every year for best prom...

550
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:52,575
...the theme is everthing darling
So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--

551
00:28:55,219 --> 00:29:07,087
"There's a land that I see where the children are free
Come with me, take my hand, and we'll live

552
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:18,276
...In a land where the river runs free
In a land through the green country
And you and me are free to be you and me...

553
00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:19,224
What's that?

554
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:23,755
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court".
Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.

555
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,610
Hey! Albo, the dog park is that way. Go!

556
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:33,272
Last I checked--this was still a free country

557
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:36,425
You  aren't seriously trying to hang out at
The Court, aren't you, Albo?

558
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:40,023
Oooh, cheap wine coolers and a fire in a trashcan.
Where do I sign up?

559
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:47,032
Why don't you go home, figure around
oh your calculator, whatever is that you use it.
Figure out how many lifetimes it will take you to get cool.

560
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:57,243
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?

561
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:05,138
can you , Josie? It's lame.
All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.

562
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:10,753
- Yeah, it seems lame.
- Yeah, it's very lame

563
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:12,929
You say that!

564
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:19,972
The Court? Josie, I am appalled

565
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,701
Jeez, I know, I mean... who knows that these kids-

566
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:31,633
No, I am appalled because I have a reporter in there,
undercover, for almost three weeks now-

567
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:33,160
and I had to read about this in the Tribune.

568
00:30:33,436 --> 00:30:33,983
You're right.

569
00:30:36,774 --> 00:30:37,657
I can fold!

570
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:48,805
Seventeen-year-old Kristen David says,
"Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."

571
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,260
S-S-She's right.
I have learned that it is a popular place for the kids to go.

572
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:01,898
This is where the stories are.

573
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:07,406
You become friends with these people.
You are party with them.

574
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:10,336
You 'll rave with them gett chicky with them.

575
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:13,564
When they go to prom...
you are going to be in their same damn limo!

576
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:20,793
Gus listen, the popular kids and I...

577
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:23,053
Do you even know these kids?

578
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:24,791
They hid my car--

579
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:38,335
By the way, it's depend, because there is no s.
Your subject is plural

580
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:39,017
Out!

581
00:31:44,616 --> 00:31:47,938
Come on! Asses and elbows!
The news doesn't sleep, you know!

582
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:53,212
Yeah, baby!

583
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:01,295
Do this with mum and dad

584
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:05,373
No. They're still caring to do Franklin
meet Pat at dinner. But I made a pizza.

585
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:07,632
- I can't do it

586
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,211
What? Damn, these are high schools girls?

587
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,942
We've got some underage hotties on our hands

588
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:22,284
Gus wants me to be friends with these people.
The popular kids. It's impossible.

589
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:23,690
Why is that impossible?

590
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:29,377
You don't know how it was for me back in high school.
All I wanted was to be accepted...

591
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:36,673
and they just tortured me.
I can't go back to Southglen South.

592
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:40,569
You're at Southglen South?
They have a killer baseball team.

593
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:44,475
Focus, please

594
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:49,423
okay,okay , You're an adult now, Josie.

595
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:54,917
You're successful,
you've graduated at the top of your class,
you work for a newspaper...

596
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:59,477
you wash your hair now--
you're not Josie Grossie anymore.

597
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:02,368
Don't you know how much I
wanted to be you in high school?

598
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:06,778
Just for one day to know what
it was like to be popular?

599
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:09,591
It's not that hard, Josie.

600
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:12,951
All you need is the right person.

601
00:33:13,402 --> 00:33:15,764
One person that thinks
you're cool and you're in.

602
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:17,790
Everyone else will be
too scared to question it.

603
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:18,577
Is that true?

604
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:20,811
Yeah, it's a little known fact

605
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:27,871
Don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself-

606
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,630
Don't you wanna show them that
the cool kids don't freak you out anymore?

607
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:35,972
That you can go in there, you can be friends with them,
and get your story?

608
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,926
Yes, desperately

609
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,741
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me

610
00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:43,640
Better than I...
That's the spirit!

611
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:49,792
So let hear it, come on:
"I'm not Josie Grossie anymore"
"I'm not Josie Grossie anymore"

612
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,108
That's it. Now scream it!
"I'm not Josie Grossie anymore"!!!

613
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,577
That's good!

614
00:34:13,437 --> 00:34:15,530
Josie... and the pussy cats

615
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:19,063
George?! What are you doing here?

616
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:22,065
In the van, go, go...

617
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:27,354
Welcome to the love hut

618
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:34,603
Oh right...
George, what is going on?

619
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,804
What are you doing?

620
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:41,795
Hidden camera

621
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,475
- Wings?
- Yeah...

622
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:47,992
That's great but...
I really just talk to Gus about this first

623
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:50,202
Geller, stop being a pain in the ass

624
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:55,224
Gus?
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz.

625
00:34:55,156 --> 00:34:58,204
Now look--you're in over your head.
This is how it's gonna work.

626
00:34:58,318 --> 00:35:00,324
I review the tapes, I find your story.

627
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:04,337
Battery, transmitter

628
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:10,407
Man!
Here we go....Good luck sweet!

629
00:35:11,264 --> 00:35:13,843
 George. why are you so cool?

630
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:21,005
Work, herbs, berries... you know
I'll be watching you

631
00:35:24,116 --> 00:35:26,698
Oh, right. Lets get this party start it

632
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:36,987
Oh! Damn!
They weren't such good when I was at high school

633
00:35:37,206 --> 00:35:40,446
Hey! Kirsten, Kristen, Gibby--
What's up girlfriends?

634
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,696
- I'm ok
- Uh! That's gonna leave a mark

635
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:54,094
And so it is Rosalind, in disguise,
who is best able to see through the disguises of others.

636
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,408
To say to Phebe, "Mistress, know thy self,"

637
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:00,211
to look at love from every angle,

638
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:04,961
and to realize, finally,
that she is in love with Orlando--

639
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:09,008
To free both hearts not in judgment but in equality

640
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:13,885
Thank you. That's really well writen, Josie
Showtime's over!

641
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:16,764
Come on, move-it! Back to work!

642
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:20,360
Gus, have you ever been in love?

643
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,701
Leave

644
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:27,446
Oh give it up, Gus, come on!
I'm just making conversation

645
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:37,210
Love. Who knows what that is?
Deadlines, circulation, those I understand.

646
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,982
You know, you should go out
every now and then, Gus;

647
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:46,621
if you put on a couple of new ties,
girls would be all over you.

648
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:49,797
- Anita...
- What?

649
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,720
Leave me alone
I have enough work here to last me all night

650
00:36:57,082 --> 00:37:01,683
Listen, I don't have anything to do tonight,
so if you like some help? I would like to help you

651
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:08,505
No Roger from oped?

652
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:10,283
Nope

653
00:37:21,857 --> 00:37:27,909
Excuse me. Do you guys think that we can work out
some kind of schedule I could work around it?

654
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,663
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?

655
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:33,709
Oh... I – uhh, must have forgotten it.

656
00:37:33,846 --> 00:37:36,156
Don't worry, I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you

657
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:38,757
So I'll see you tonight 7:30 at Nana's, right?

658
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:41,125
Ok, right. 7:30

659
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:42,551
I'm late for lab

660
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:47,869
So Motley. Oh yes, I am so there
This band is so good. Have you heared this band, right?

661
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:49,446
Oh, yeah, I'll still my mum's car, I'll drive

662
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:51,871
It's gonna be Rufalicious

663
00:37:51,984 --> 00:37:52,772
Jason, it isn't a stick of gum.
It's "Rufus", "Rufus"

664
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:28,542
Drinking tonight?

665
00:38:29,782 --> 00:38:34,137
No, I am not 21. I am seventeen and I still attend high school

666
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:39,090
Two of you?

667
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:00,587
- Josie! Josie!
- Hi!

668
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,665
Out on a school night

669
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:05,067
Bathroom was disgusting

670
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:06,910
I like you to meet Lara

671
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:08,102
His girlfriend

672
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:10,767
She is visiting from New York

673
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,188
Josie is a one of my students

674
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,906
- How do you do?
- What?

675
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:14,954
Hi there!

676
00:39:16,197 --> 00:39:18,537
I'm sorry I can't even think in here

677
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,027
No ofense, I know you love this

678
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:24,790
I'm just hoping you could get all out of your system
from you move to New York

679
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:27,540
My firm has season tickets to the Met

680
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,737
Oh, well I love baseball

681
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:36,380
Nice to meet you

682
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:38,799
It's nice to meet you too

683
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:55,079
The way I see "we'are tomorrow"
"Hello I'm tomorrow"

684
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:58,271
because when we get the money and the power
the women come to me...

685
00:39:58,347 --> 00:40:00,229
the women come to me
Do what I'm doing

686
00:40:00,724 --> 00:40:03,002
If you don't have any moving
No movement

687
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:04,489
It's better if I write it down
Do you have a napkin?

688
00:40:05,395 --> 00:40:12,759
Welcome to my little love boat
Just let me up with my business.
Oh wait a minute... This I can't forget

689
00:40:28,497 --> 00:40:30,598
That was great you guys!!
That was great...

690
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,851
Excuse me, can I sit there?

691
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:47,592
Yeah, we accept all people
We are all about da' love, c'mon have a seat

692
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,478
Thank you so much

693
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,773
How do you tonight?

694
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:53,535
I'm very well, thank you
How are you?

695
00:40:53,544 --> 00:40:57,525
I fell good, I feel really good
You know, we have this special cake for you

696
00:40:59,113 --> 00:41:03,443
Have some cake. It's a special cake,
it's Ganja's cake

697
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:09,954
It has vitamin A, vitamin B,
vitamin T, H and C.
I'ts good for you, eat it up.

698
00:41:11,564 --> 00:41:15,759
Is that...? No, girl... put it back,
just say "No"

699
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:17,990
Good, eh?

700
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:20,836
That's delicious... you know I love chocolate

701
00:41:23,511 --> 00:41:24,637
She's going to knock the floor

702
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:31,710
Firecracker! You're a firecracker!

703
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:35,097
Firecracker!

704
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:38,675
Man I don't love her

705
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:16,558
I know this woman,
she is my superior.

706
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:56,382
I'm telling you, Rob! I think I really did it!
I think I'm totally in! I was so cool!

707
00:42:57,396 --> 00:42:59,612
You know what's a weird word? Fork.

708
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:05,341
Did I tell you about the new friends I made?
I made friends with a whole table of Rastafarians!

709
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:07,147
Not just one, a whole table!

710
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:14,508
Oh. My God. Someone ate my entire pie.
I don't know how that happened

711
00:43:41,948 --> 00:43:45,107
Hi Guy. Guys. Guy's Guys
Hi loser

712
00:43:46,187 --> 00:43:48,313
- Oh my God!
- Loser!

713
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,583
What is going on up here?

714
00:44:01,398 --> 00:44:02,602
They 've gone nuts

715
00:44:03,986 --> 00:44:05,520
Loserrr!!!

716
00:44:32,452 --> 00:44:33,854
Oh right, oh right
Look up, girl

717
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:38,250
Jo, Jo, look up!
Loser, see...Loser, look!

718
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:47,720
Hello!!Y-Y-Yes!!
Oh my God!

719
00:44:52,698 --> 00:44:54,745
Come down, just washing it up
we're cool

720
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:08,898
It's like the All-Humiliation Network

721
00:45:38,813 --> 00:45:40,947
Hello! Oh Hi Billy

722
00:45:42,799 --> 00:45:44,495
Ok, I'll be on the jiffer

723
00:45:46,822 --> 00:45:48,544
- Have you got fun
- Ok, thanks. Bye, bye!

724
00:45:56,993 --> 00:45:57,903
Hi Billy!

725
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:07,396
Hey! write a poem about this, kid

726
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:22,674
Josie? Is that you honey?

727
00:46:44,864 --> 00:46:46,633
Josie... get up

728
00:46:46,234 --> 00:46:49,394
Josie... are you ok?

729
00:46:50,593 --> 00:46:51,121
Josie

730
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,068
Are you crazy? What are you doing in here?

731
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:59,670
I just registered.
Check it out. Manufactured at the Tiki Post

732
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,580
- Can you do that?
- I just did

733
00:47:04,804 --> 00:47:10,279
Jos, this's it. This is my ninth inning!
The game isn't over--I just thought it was!

734
00:47:11,235 --> 00:47:15,137
You see, I get on the Southglen baseball team,
the right scout sees me--

735
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:17,960
I'm into the minors-it's game time!

736
00:47:18,071 --> 00:47:22,657
- But you're twenty-three years old!
- Yeah, with the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old!

737
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:28,914
Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular...
I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.

738
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:30,825
Hear one
- Whatever

739
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:38,466
- This is so like you. You know, you can't just come
in here and be popular in just one day

740
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:53,012
Rob!Rob!Rob!Rob Rob!................

741
00:48:02,876 --> 00:48:05,173
I'm the cabbage's salad king of the world

742
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:07,358
Dude, you did rock, man!

743
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,112
So hot!

744
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:20,881
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and
I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...

745
00:48:21,411 --> 00:48:22,591
Cool!

746
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:24,812
Josie?

747
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,582
Where were you last night?
I was really worried

748
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:28,552
What?

749
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:32,096
You know, last night. 7:30 Nana's?

750
00:48:32,314 --> 00:48:37,176
I kept calling you, but I just got your machine.
I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.

751
00:48:38,672 --> 00:48:40,825
I'm sorry, I must forgot

752
00:48:41,892 --> 00:48:44,526
Well, maybe you should forget about sitting with us too

753
00:48:49,018 --> 00:48:52,338
Oh rigth. Let's get some money for the prom!!

754
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:17,641
- Where's your partner?
I don't have one--

755
00:49:18,157 --> 00:49:20,751
I GOT A LONELY RIDE IN BUCKET SEVEN!

756
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:24,344
- SINGLE!
- Do you have to yell like that?

757
00:49:24,535 --> 00:49:25,345
Sure I do

758
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,091
Is this seat taken?

759
00:49:32,394 --> 00:49:33,318
Thank you

760
00:49:36,459 --> 00:49:38,160
- Thank you
- Welcome

761
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:45,197
Are you--scared?

762
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,800
I'm gonna tell you something here,

763
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:52,185
and I hope it doesn't undermine my position
as an authority figure but... eh...

764
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:54,420
I'm a little afraid of heights.

765
00:49:55,376 --> 00:49:57,770
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel

766
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:03,620
Actually, it's
more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me

767
00:50:03,926 --> 00:50:06,567
If better if you have your Gordie Howe's helmet on it...
you feel better

768
00:50:08,343 --> 00:50:09,478
You remember that story?

769
00:50:09,598 --> 00:50:11,123
I remember everything that you say

770
00:50:12,435 --> 00:50:13,682
in your classroom

771
00:50:14,935 --> 00:50:18,700
If the bucket's a-rockin',
don't come-a knockin'

772
00:50:21,211 --> 00:50:23,327
- Boys
- Yeah

773
00:50:23,705 --> 00:50:24,860
Mr Coulson rocks my world!

774
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:29,431
You know, I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it,

775
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:32,634
but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.

776
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,770
Why do you do that?

777
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:37,817
I don't know. 

778
00:50:38,723 --> 00:50:40,820
And you know what's scary--when you get older...

779
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:43,042
it just gets more confusing.

780
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,483
I mean, you know Lara,
my girlfriend you met at the club

781
00:50:46,805 --> 00:50:50,019
We went out for five years
and now she wants me to move to New York

782
00:50:51,306 --> 00:50:53,754
And, you know, I mean... I should-should do it

783
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,685
You know make the commitment and grow up

784
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,116
I know we have our differences

785
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:03,731
You know, I shouldn't be talking about
this stuff with you. I'm sorry.

786
00:51:04,981 --> 00:51:11,170
It's nice to have someone to talk to--
Yeah, same here

787
00:51:14,663 --> 00:51:18,454
All I can tell you is that when you're my age...
the guys will be lined up around the block for you

788
00:51:21,963 --> 00:51:23,949
You have to say that because you're my teacher.

789
00:51:26,452 --> 00:51:28,892
Actually I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher

790
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:38,319
Josie Geller? No way men
Yeah men

791
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:40,908
She used to date the drummer for
The Big Bad Voodoo Daddys?

792
00:51:41,204 --> 00:51:43,290
Yeah, that's something I always wanted to be a drummer, always

793
00:51:43,694 --> 00:51:46,342
And then she dum dum
And the drummer...

794
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:49,414
All right that's it

795
00:51:50,395 --> 00:51:52,633
Just water and Ex-Lax till prom.

796
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,778
I know, it's all about hydration

797
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,471
Did you guys know that Josie's dad invented that stuff?

798
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,864
Ex-lax. She's the heiress of Ex-lax fortune

799
00:52:00,923 --> 00:52:03,477
- Shut up
- No, it's true

800
00:52:04,132 --> 00:52:08,590
She´s spends all ofher extra time with 
her family on a yacht in the south of France.

801
00:52:19,794 --> 00:52:21,666
Quick hands! Quick hands!
Here we go.

802
00:52:21,784 --> 00:52:23,485
Who´s a winner, huh?
Who´s a winner? Focus.

803
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:30,399
Rob, Thanks for showing me
that new grip,It totally changed my swing, man.

804
00:52:30,595 --> 00:52:31,384
Ah, no problem, man.

805
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:34,771
Hey, man. What´s goin´ on?
Hey, you guys know that girl, Josie Geller?

806
00:52:35,191 --> 00:52:37,910
Yeah, I know her.You mean Loser?
Nah, man, she´s cool.

807
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:41,061
I used to go out with her, man.
She dumped me.

808
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:43,122
But we´re still good friends.

809
00:52:43,415 --> 00:52:48,488
Hey, really?Yeah, hey, wait.
Like,how good?Like--like good-good?
She is amazing.

810
00:52:53,657 --> 00:52:55,200
All right. All right.
All right, guys.

811
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:58,278
As you´ve probably noticed,
this, uh, this certainly isn´t English.

812
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:02,090
Um, we´ve combined a few classes
today here for the seminar,

813
00:53:02,337 --> 00:53:04,638
and hopefully, the speaker
will be here any minute now.

814
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:10,056
Hi.Hey! Oh, hi.

815
00:53:10,332 --> 00:53:11,929
Uh, you here
for the sex talk?

816
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:16,059
Well, ha ha...
I like a man who gets right to the point.

817
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:17,548
Are you Pam?

818
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:18,711
If you say so.

819
00:53:21,006 --> 00:53:24,353
OK
Juniors, Seniors, this is Pam Kitterman.
She´s going to lead us in our sex discussion.

820
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:26,191
What? What?

821
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:27,586
No, I´m not--what?
