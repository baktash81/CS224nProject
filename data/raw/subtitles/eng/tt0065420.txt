1
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:25,181
THE ARCHER OF FIRE
AKA LONG LIVE ROBIN HOOD

2
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:32,785
Germany: In the year 1195,
in the Castle of Dürrenstein…

3
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,417
May God make your mission
be successful.

4
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,345
England: One month later…

5
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,600
Since I met you, this is
the first time I've seen you smile.

6
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,311
Because I'm at home.

7
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,982
Look up there.

8
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,525
Nottingham, my castle.

9
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,780
I left it when I had
just turned fifteen

10
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,991
leaving for the crusades.

11
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,829
Behind those trees
is my wet nurse's farm.

12
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,039
We'll have a nice lunch!

13
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,731
Hey, you!

14
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,696
Get out of there!

15
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,949
We don't want to hurt you.

16
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,874
- What are you afraid of?
- Leave me my little goat.

17
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,960
It's the only thing I have.

18
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,964
Don't worry, good man.
We won't know what to do with it.

19
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,469
What happened?
Who destroyed everything?

20
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:07,807
The man who usurped the earldom after
the death of the earl of Nottingham.

21
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:12,103
Sir Robert, a damned Norman
under the orders of John.

22
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,981
- John Lackland?
- Yes.

23
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:19,110
The king's brother.
He had himself elected regent

24
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,864
and exterminated all the Saxons
loyal to King Richard.

25
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:26,533
Those who lived here?

26
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,035
All dead.

27
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:35,918
I believe that your title
of first squire of King Richard

28
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,588
is no longer a guarantee
for our mission.

29
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,594
Sir Robert's guards! Run away, quick!

30
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,530
- Who are you?
- Ambassadors of Henry VI,

31
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,618
Emperor of Germany. We are here
to confer with the Regent.

32
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,997
You are in luck.
His Highness John is here,

33
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,083
guest of the earl
at Nottingham Castle.

34
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,959
Follow me!

35
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:23,549
Do not speak,
you will pretend to be my helper.

36
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,177
After such a long time
no one will recognize you.

37
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,013
The Seal of the King.

38
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:58,834
One more little turn and it's over.

39
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,712
That's it!

40
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,967
Even in embroidery
I am more skilled than a woman.

41
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:10,221
Extraordinary, Prince John.
Who taught you this?

42
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:15,435
I couldn't beat my brother Richard
with the sword.

43
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,105
Listening to my mother's advice,

44
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,608
I learned to weave, to intertwine.

45
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,697
You can learn many things
from a woman, Sir Robert.

46
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,743
Right, I always listen to
milady's suggestions.

47
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,580
Matilde has always
been very skillful.

48
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,083
She almost married you!

49
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:40,960
Remember, Sir Robert.

50
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,338
Is important not to love women.

51
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,632
Prince, I didn't expect
this from you.

52
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:49,135
It's a typically male concept.

53
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,804
On the contrary!
Even this I learned from my mother.

54
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,474
Excuse me!

55
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,227
Highness.

56
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,189
An imperial ambassador asks
to confer with you.

57
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:05,693
Ambassadors.
The ruffians of the rulers!

58
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,280
Even the government
is a patient embroidery.

59
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,324
Come, Sir Robert.

60
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,330
Baron Rudolf von Battenberg,

61
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,833
ambassador of Emperor Henry VI.

62
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,713
An envoy of the emperor is always
welcome on English soil.

63
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,135
My credentials.

64
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,767
Say.

65
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,685
The Emperor has charged me
to bring you the news

66
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:45,233
that your brother, King Richard
is alive and enjoying perfect health.

67
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,777
Here is his seal.

68
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,376
Praise the Lord!

69
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,338
We thought he died in a shipwreck
on his return from the Holy Land.

70
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,508
- Where is he?
- At the emperor's court.

71
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,470
He is a welcome guest
and is treated with all regards.

72
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,597
Prisoner.

73
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,808
The Emperor
has suffered much damage

74
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,644
by the army of King Richard.

75
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:26,191
A ransom will have to be paid,
if you want him to return to England.

76
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,567
How much?

77
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,236
100.000 pieces of gold.

78
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,409
That's a crazy amount of money!
The Crown has no such treasure.

79
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,870
You forget that we are talking about
Richard Lionheart!

80
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:45,168
Otherwise?

81
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:49,172
After the June solstice Henry VI
will no longer answer for his fate.

82
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,841
Report that we will do
what is possible.

83
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,676
Tell Richard

84
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:57,222
that we will put all our
brotherly love in this difficult task.

85
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,682
Highness.

86
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:14,239
Perhaps you think that if the envoy
would not return to Germany,

87
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,949
the problem would be solved.

88
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,495
Of course! Of course!

89
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,124
You are a very practical man,
Sir Robert.

90
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,046
Your initiatives
are very useful to the Crown.

91
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,886
Sir Guy.

92
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:39,389
Yes, milord.

93
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,056
John will not pay the ransom.

94
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:46,436
With the death of King Richard
he will ascend the throne legally.

95
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:50,233
A crown won this way
cannot be maintained for long.

96
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,694
- The people love Richard.
- But they think he's dead.

97
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,541
This time the emperor's name
will not be enough to stop them.

98
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,252
I know how to get rid of them.
Follow me.

99
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,785
They didn't imagine
that I know these places.

100
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,332
I wasn't fooled by John.

101
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,502
This makes problematic
the life of your king.

102
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,922
Not if the people know he is alive.

103
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,427
Must I always consider myself
your prisoner?

104
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:03,598
The Emperor would like
hundred thousand pieces of gold

105
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,601
than your presence.
- Well, von Battenberg.

106
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,437
The cave has two exits.

107
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,566
From this side you will reach
the river and you can embark.

108
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:19,739
Tell the emperor that he will receive
the ransom in the appointed time.

109
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,825
I will trust you. Good luck.

110
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,077
Good luck to you.

111
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,416
Thank you.

112
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,055
Give him a double ration of hay
and groom him properly.

113
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,892
Yes, sir.

114
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,867
Innkeeper!

115
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,911
At your command, sir.

116
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,081
I would like a room,
without bugs if possible.

117
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,668
- And a good hot bath.
- Right away.

118
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,338
Joan, accompany the gentleman
to the big room.

119
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,382
This way, milord.

120
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,402
Stronger, don't be afraid!

121
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:43,781
That's better.

122
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:50,244
Now you're exaggerating.
You don't have to take my skin off.

123
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,747
Arrest him, he's a noble Saxon!

124
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:55,418
Sir Robert's guards!

125
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,797
- Run away, quickly!
- Long live King Richard!

126
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,716
Here!

127
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,802
On him!

128
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,733
Hey, you!

129
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,079
Hey!

130
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,056
- Henry of Nottingham!
- Alan-a-Dale!

131
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,940
- A lot of time has passed.
- We still recognized each other.

132
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,444
A youth spent together
is not easily forgotten.

133
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,862
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

134
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:51,741
For your sake and mine,
you must flee without wasting time.

135
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:54,994
The area is full
of Sir Robert's guards.

136
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:59,373
- Now there are less of them!
- He's right, better to disappear.

137
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:02,169
My father was also killed
by Sir Robert's men.

138
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,421
For us Saxons there is no escape.

139
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,009
Give me time to get dressed.

140
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,845
Wait.

141
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,724
Flee, sir.

142
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,477
Joan!
Where are you?

143
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,835
Joan, help me.

144
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:54,471
- For your trouble.
- Thank you, sir.

145
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,015
Thank you!

146
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,062
A fight a day
and we'd become rich!

147
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,983
Alan!

148
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,068
- Alan.
- Your friend has already left.

149
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:12,156
- Where to?
- I don't know.

150
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:16,951
Five coins if you tell me.
I must find him.

151
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:20,414
- But I don't know, I swear.
- Ten!

152
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,627
- Where?
- Towards Sherwood Forest.

153
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,460
Here.

154
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,344
It is too dark to follow a lead.

155
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,066
Good shot!

156
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,742
There are at least four of them.

157
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,247
I'll have fun finding
that bunch of foxes!

158
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,404
I'm sorry, bunny, but I got you!

159
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,448
I got you!

160
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,095
- Mother of God!
- I wanted to help, Father.

161
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,525
The work is done!

162
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,986
Not quite, son!

163
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,627
Now it's finished!

164
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,324
Stop!

165
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,038
Put the sword down.

166
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,709
Good.

167
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,296
Nice dress!

168
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,509
That would fit me just fine.

169
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,512
Get it!

170
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:57,459
Don't be afraid.
A hunter never hurts the pups.

171
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:10,430
It's good.

172
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,434
Please, sit at the table.

173
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,604
Please.

174
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,196
Someone is missing.

175
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,617
Judging by the place,
it should be the boss.

176
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:36,706
It would not be polite
to start without him.

177
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:41,962
We will wait for him and eat
all together when he arrives.

178
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,756
- What do you guys think?
- I think

179
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,677
that this meal will remain
on your stomach before you eat it.

180
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,363
What's going on?

181
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,615
We've been waiting for you!

182
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,952
Of course!
Behind the door!

183
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,666
You're a foreigner, an Englishman
would have come face to face.

184
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,919
- Now we are.
- Yes, but you have a sword.

185
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,465
- Get one!
- No, I prefer my cane.

186
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,009
Go for it!

187
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,140
- Please.
- After you.

188
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,439
What are you waiting for?
You don't want to miss the show!

189
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,773
Of course not!

190
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,286
So, lumberjack?

191
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,164
I'm ready, pretty boy!

192
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,564
Kill him!

193
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,691
Go ahead!

194
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,780
- What kind of wood is made of?
- Hard wood, mister!

195
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,699
Now I'll let you taste it!

196
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,080
Kill him... Without hurting him
too much! Come on!

197
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,315
Outdoor gymnastics
always gives me an appetite!

198
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,734
It's my kitchen
that makes me want to eat.

199
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,196
Nice mister, aren't you hungry?

200
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,910
In the Gospel it is written: "What
you have done will be done to you."

201
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,247
Hey, you scoundrels!

202
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,291
Am I in time for a bite?

203
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,044
- I bet there's nothing left.
- We weren't expecting you.

204
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,506
- Did you get everything done yet?
- I got lucky.

205
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,677
I have made contact with
three other groups, Saxons like us.

206
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,306
They are all in our condition,
they survive as best they can.

207
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,434
- What's he doing here?
- He's a foreigner.

208
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,729
He wanted to be smart,
but we taught him a lesson.

209
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,522
Idiots!

210
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,900
You guys were wrong!

211
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,237
Why?

212
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,116
He is a friend! I owe him my life.

213
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:03,288
Yeah, but you left me
as soon as you could.

214
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,291
I didn't want to tell you
that I'm forced to live here.

215
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,503
Are you ashamed to be with us?

216
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,796
You wanted me to reveal
where is the shelter?

217
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,427
If the guards find us,
we are dead.

218
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:22,557
But in the forest they can't find us.
It's a safe hiding place.

219
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,935
Listen up.

220
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,273
I am a Saxon too.

221
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,735
I have a score to settle
with Sir Robert and his cronies.

222
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,197
I would like to join you.

223
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,665
I can vouch for his loyalty.

224
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,337
With him, we can make
bigger and bigger loots

225
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,756
behind the backs
of those Norman pigs.

226
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,801
All right.

227
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,056
No hard feelings about the dive?

228
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,184
- No hard feelings.
- Give me your hand!

229
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,815
I'm Little John.
That's Friar Tuck.

230
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,068
- I am Will Scarlet.
- I am Lightning Hands.

231
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,822
I am Much and this is for you.

232
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:24,118
You can not move in the forest
dressed in iron. It was my brother's.

233
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,371
Killed by Sir Robert's men.

234
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,624
Now you are one of us,
but what is your name?

235
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,876
- He's...
- It doesn't matter.

236
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,756
- What was your brother's name?
- Robin.

237
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,009
Good! I like Robin.

238
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:44,138
What I was no longer matters.

239
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,853
Starting today,
I will be Robin Hood.

240
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,321
Now repeat with me:

241
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:04,701
"Panem nostrum quotidianum
da nobis hodie." Repeat.

242
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:09,331
Panem nostrum quotidianum
da nobili.

243
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,876
- Da nobis...
- Hodie!

244
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,170
Do you want to learn Latin?

245
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,508
- God understands me anyway.
- No!

246
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,552
He speaks Latin.

247
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,638
Don't bother that poor kid.

248
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,181
Shut up, blasphemer!

249
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,058
He must learn.

250
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,437
What is this?

251
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,272
A bean.

252
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,941
Never mind!

253
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,366
So what is this?

254
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,618
- A Pater Noster.
- Bravo.

255
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,496
Now recite it and then translate it.

256
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:01,049
We must round up all the Saxons.

257
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,346
- How many will there be?
- A hundred or two hundred.

258
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:10,809
But they are poor stragglers.
Yours is a crazy project.

259
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,520
It's the only one possible.

260
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,980
We must incite
the people to revolt,

261
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,568
otherwise the emperor
will never receive the ransom

262
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,903
and King Richard will die
in a foreign land.

263
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,155
- People don't know how to fight.
- They will learn.

264
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,826
- They has no ideals.
- No one has ever given them.

265
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,037
Even outlaws
can have ideals too.

266
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:34,040
We will make them the first rebels
against the usurpers.

267
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,377
They will never accept.

268
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,631
They have only one ideal:
filling their bellies

269
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,927
and use weapons to poach.

270
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,830
Stop!

271
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,099
- Let go of me!
- The deer of the king's lands

272
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,644
are of the king!

273
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,105
- You shall pay for this crime.
- But, sir...

274
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:43,818
On the gallows you will learn
that only the noble can hunt.

275
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,821
- Take him away.
- No, leave him!

276
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,407
I hit that deer.

277
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,201
By what right?
Are you noble?

278
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:57,791
I doubt that a woman
can shoot so well.

279
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,209
As nobility,

280
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,964
my ancestors were counts
when yours grazed sheep!

281
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,175
I am Marianne of Manson,

282
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,303
the oldest and noblest Saxon family.

283
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,014
A day full of surprises.

284
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,227
I was hunting deer
and I found a more noble prey.

285
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,981
Get her too!

286
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,950
That Saxon
almost hit my brother.

287
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,452
I hope you will treat her
like she deserves.

288
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,788
Let's not go overboard, Matilde.

289
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,248
Sir Guy has lost only his hat.

290
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,212
I think our beautiful prisoner

291
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,381
will be more useful to us alive
than dead.

292
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,304
Life is a valley of tears.

293
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,975
Dust we are and dust we will return.

294
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,646
But we care about this dust!

295
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:05,149
We cannot risk it for a king
dead or captive.

296
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,320
Don't you understand?
Our salvation and that of England

297
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,532
depend on his return.
- Friar Tuck is right.

298
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,034
We are small for such a big game.

299
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,579
- What did I tell you?
- You!

300
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,750
- What's happening?
- They got Much, the miller's son.

301
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,168
- Who?
- Sir Robert and his men.

302
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:26,963
He was poaching
in the nobles' reserve.

303
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,716
Good Lord!

304
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,510
The punishment is death!

305
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:39,058
I'm not hungry!

306
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,730
Do you know when
the execution will take place?

307
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,398
Tomorrow.

308
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:50,862
He will go to the gallows with
other poor people, all Saxons.

309
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,701
Much's brother also died like that?

310
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,456
Yes.

311
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,379
- Don't you do anything?
- We can pray!

312
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,464
Of course!

313
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,426
I forgot!

314
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:17,263
"Of dust thou art
and unto dust thou shalt return!"

315
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,684
But this dust
is best not to risk it.

316
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,728
By all the saints!
It's not cowardice.

317
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,649
To save that boy,
I'd even risk my own skin.

318
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:32,486
So? Let's risk it!
What are we waiting for?

319
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,890
Praised be Jesus Christ!

320
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,393
Brothers, in here there
is a dying man who needs you.

321
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,814
- You don't know how to confess?
- That's not it.

322
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,400
A drop of your holy oil
will open to him the gates of heaven.

323
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,236
Come.

324
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,740
Please, come in.

325
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,575
In the name of the Earl of Nottingham

326
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:24,247
have been condemned
to hang from the gallows:

327
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,667
John Sussex because he hid a ram

328
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,170
to the requisition
of the count's tax collectors.

329
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,716
Roland Watson, Saxon,
for high treason.

330
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,469
His son Gary
for concealing him from the law.

331
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,347
- I bless you.
- I bless you.

332
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:46,560
Will Cunningham for selling
watered down wine to soldiers.

333
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,855
Much, the miller's son,

334
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,941
for poaching
in the nobles' reserve.

335
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,985
This will serve as an example to all.

336
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,863
Ours will be an exemplary county.

337
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,073
Only the best will remain.

338
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,693
The blessing of the bodies.

339
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,174
I want to see.

340
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,260
- He's brave.
- You can tell he's a Saxon.

341
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,192
What's going on?

342
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,736
He's gone.

343
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,876
The man is a servant of the usurper.

344
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,211
King Richard is alive and will return

345
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,506
to hang him and his cronies
to this gallows.

346
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,383
Let's free the prisoners!

347
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,127
Sir Robert,
your life is in danger.

348
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,837
Go!

349
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,858
- Hurray!
- To the forest!

350
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,325
Will! Give me the bow.

351
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,465
- To our victory!
- Long live Robin Hood!

352
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,258
Long live our leader!

353
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:11,182
Long live King Richard.
All united against the usurper.

354
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,934
Hooray!

355
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:18,397
Merry men!
After what we did today

356
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,317
Sir Robert's army will attack us.

357
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,862
We must be ready to defend ourselves

358
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,990
to attack them.

359
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,368
Now we are no longer bandits,

360
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,954
but warriors of King Richard.

361
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:38,167
Friar Tuck, you will find other men
among the people and the peasants.

362
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,380
Alan, you will gather
the scattered Saxons.

363
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,134
John, you will stay
with the people of the forest.

364
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,427
Together we will teach them to fight.

365
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,555
We will pay our king's ransom.

366
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,901
"King Richard is alive.
Join the companions of the forest

367
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,112
against the usurper. Robin Hood."

368
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,832
Robin Hood!

369
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,711
It's the fault of those damn bandits

370
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,922
who say that Richard is alive.

371
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,133
People listen to them,
they believe them.

372
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,469
What about the fact that Marianne
continues to stay at the castle?

373
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,806
- She's a Saxon prisoner.
- You wouldn't know it.

374
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:38,686
You treat her with full honors,
you are very courteous to her

375
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,980
and eats at our table!

376
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,691
You don't understand what would it be

377
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,944
if the descendant
of the oldest Saxon house

378
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,948
married a Norman nobleman?
The discontent would cease.

379
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,159
It would be the triumph
of our politics.

380
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,120
Would you be the Norman nobleman?

381
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,582
You are a woman
of rare political skill.

382
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,959
What has changed you now?

383
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,003
Jealousy perhaps?

384
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,593
Come in.

385
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,183
Marianne of Manson,
you are always more graceful.

386
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,145
You afflict me with compliments
and keep me prisoner!

387
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:25,899
You are only a guest.
At your nod, free.

388
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,069
I will never marry you!

389
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,614
I hate you as a man and as a Norman.

390
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,118
Hate is closer to love
than indifference.

391
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,579
It is not only hatred.
I despise you, Sir Robert.

392
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,499
Know that I was nine years old

393
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,294
when King Richard engaged me
to Sir Henry of Nottingham,

394
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,296
the man I love.

395
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,923
A union of convenience
is not a problem.

396
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,512
If you have been promised
to a Nottingham,

397
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,224
well, now
I am the Earl of Nottingham.

398
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,102
You are the usurper of that name!

399
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:03,812
My Dear,

400
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,275
remember that usurpers
conquer power

401
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,527
with strength and skill.

402
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:16,242
The same things that are lacking
to the rightfully ousted.

403
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,168
- You.
- Peasant.

404
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,170
With Scarlet. Next.

405
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,089
- Woodsman.
- With Little John.

406
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,842
- Next.
- I served as an altar boy.

407
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,011
- Really?
- Yes.

408
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,265
Bravo.
In the kitchen peeling potatoes!

409
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,767
- Another one.
- I used to work in the kitchen, too.

410
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,854
- I helped with the grocery shopping.
- You're nimble of hand.

411
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,357
To the lianas up there with Much.

412
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,319
- To the lianas?
- To the lianas! Another one.

413
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,612
Blacksmith.

414
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,908
Warning. Hold the liana
with both hands

415
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,579
and then let yourself go
without fear.

416
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:11,964
Are you guys ready?

417
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,757
On guard!

418
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,719
Come on, attack!

419
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,223
Courage!

420
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,394
Come on!

421
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,524
Holy hell!
We don't know how to use swords.

422
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,736
Give us our pitchforks
and you'll see!

423
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,198
Alan. Wait!

424
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,533
Maybe he's right.

425
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,169
That's it!

426
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:08,061
Bravo!
Not bad at all!

427
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,649
Good. Now take the pitchforks

428
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,067
and show Friar Tuck
what you can do.

429
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,903
Indeed!

430
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,243
I wouldn't want to be in his shoes.

431
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,164
If I finish praying before you
finish the job, you'll be in trouble!

432
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,208
Father, defend yourself!

433
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,636
You still have much to learn.

434
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,056
A little training will do you good.
Come on!

435
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,892
Walk!

436
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,854
Got it!

437
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,941
I'll hold him for you. You try it.

438
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,537
- Nice shot!
- Good job!

439
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,872
Fantastic!

440
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,501
Bravo!

441
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,801
That's enough for today. Let's eat.

442
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,955
What's going on?

443
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,958
Now I understand.
An iron soul

444
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,878
and a brazen face!

445
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,756
- Robin, I...
- Don't apologize.

446
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,049
We're going to make a lot of these.

447
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,302
We're going to try them
on the Normans!

448
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,723
And with every blow
a shower of gold shall come down

449
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,058
for the king's ransom.

450
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,728
Customs!

451
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,023
What do you have to report?

452
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,402
- This.
- What is this?

453
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,834
Please, gentlemen.

454
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:40,255
The best rooms are always
reserved for the Count's friends.

455
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,176
Joan, accompany the tax collectors
of Sir Robert to the great chamber.

456
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,053
Please.

457
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,266
- Did you set up the escort?
- Yes, in the barn.

458
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,144
- I put in new straw.
- Close the door.

459
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,168
Tie me up!

460
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,799
Squeeze tight.

461
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:34,602
A thousand pieces of gold!
Sir Robert's tax collectors are good!

462
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,437
Even those of King Richard!

463
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,691
Thank you, gentlemen.

464
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,027
Robberies, coup de grâce,
subversive propaganda.

465
00:47:44,277 --> 00:47:47,698
- This is a disgrace, Sir Guy.
- With your permission, milord,

466
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,325
Robin Hood's hours are numbered.

467
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,787
- How?
- We can't get into the forest.

468
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,832
- The place is ideal for ambushes.
- So?

469
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,792
Leave it to me.

470
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:03,464
I have prepared a trap in which
he will be caught by the throat!

471
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,179
Sir Guy!

472
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,932
That's the signal.
They must be around here.

473
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,810
Continue on as if nothing happened.

474
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,833
Praised be Jesus Christ.

475
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,669
Always be praised, son.

476
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,379
What are you doing
in the forest alone?

477
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,967
I am a hermit.
I spend my life in prayer

478
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,846
feeding on the little
that God sends me. What about you?

479
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,973
I am the abbot of Eldon.

480
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,059
We're bringing the harvest
of our lands to the abbey,

481
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,144
but we lost our way.

482
00:49:41,394 --> 00:49:44,690
I know the forest better
than my hand. I will guide you.

483
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:48,235
- God will give you credit.
- Amen. This way.

484
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,373
- Normans?
- No, a caravan of monks.

485
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:04,334
Too bad!
I was hoping for some good prey.

486
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,004
But they have carts full
of every good thing.

487
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:11,174
I marvel at you! Would you steal
from Friar Tuck's colleagues?

488
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,013
Father, shall we recite the litany?

489
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,599
The path will seem shorter.

490
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,853
You see, I'm in a bit tired.

491
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,856
We have been walking for a long time.

492
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:29,359
Father, we walk better
reciting the litanies.

493
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,913
Father?
I said, "Meum intende."

494
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,373
Yes, I mean! I mean!

495
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:47,044
If you mean, answer.

496
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,879
What?

497
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,048
The continuation!

498
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,218
Yes!

499
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,306
Help!

500
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:02,559
I can't, I'm getting a cough.

501
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,311
What a pity!

502
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,025
No, it's useless!

503
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,152
I'm out of breath.

504
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,827
Latin is the language of fools.
Isn't it?

505
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,706
That's right, my son! Exactly!

506
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:28,961
So, I'm going
to continue to pray alone.

507
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:33,548
This is very good. Please, continue.

508
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,760
Watch out, brothers!

509
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:40,597
They are not monks, but soldiers!

510
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,517
The wagons are full of soldiers!

511
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,104
In the name of the Father,
it is necessary

512
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:52,442
teach a lesson
to these impostors!

513
00:51:55,863 --> 00:52:00,033
- Wait a minute! He's not praying.
- What does he say?

514
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,453
You must rush!

515
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,539
Mortal danger!

516
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,212
They are not monks, but soldiers!

517
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:17,259
For all the saints, hurry up!

518
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,979
Thanks to God!

519
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,776
Praise the Lord!

520
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,612
- Did you enjoy the prayer?
- Very much so.

521
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:42,117
Good. Now you will also hear
the short prayer.

522
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,579
Alarms! Bandits.

523
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,958
Knock and it will be opened!

524
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,878
Come forward, you lazybones!

525
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,546
Follow me!

526
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,666
One by one, it doesn't hurt anyone.

527
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,879
Please, thank Sir Robert from me.

528
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:21,925
Tell him that I will repay him when
King Richard returns to the throne.

529
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,345
Now, if you don't mind, off you go!

530
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,098
One moment!

531
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,727
Turn around!

532
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,609
Now go!

533
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,364
Everyone! Run!

534
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,335
As I gave you the command,
so I can take it away from you.

535
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:02,007
You can't get rid of that bandit
and his four beggars!

536
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:06,845
Those aren't four beggers
as you say.

537
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:10,598
All the people are with him
and help him.

538
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,642
My brother is right.

539
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,520
You have to beat Robin Hood
at his own game.

540
00:55:15,728 --> 00:55:18,065
He says that Richard is alive

541
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,358
and you announce it officially.

542
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,028
Prince John would not agree.

543
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,323
Yes, as long as it would benefit him.

544
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:29,451
Why does Robin Hood
steal and plunder?

545
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,037
To pay the king's ransom.

546
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:37,334
You use the same excuse to
crushing the people with taxes.

547
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:42,089
They will pay, but they will curse
Richard's name.

548
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,717
The regent will collect
the goods and the money.

549
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:49,471
This way
the people will hate me more.

550
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,682
The people turn their sympathies
like a weather vane.

551
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,643
Draw him to you, amuse him.

552
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,813
It is since the death of the old earl
that no games are held.

553
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:03,110
The stick and the carrot!
It's an old trick that always works.

554
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:06,196
I don't argue with a Saxon.

555
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,823
Guy.

556
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,619
I am not prejudiced against Saxons.

557
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:16,873
That is why I want to give
to the people of Nottingham

558
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,084
their ancient traditional festivals.

559
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:23,338
Very interesting.
Start with the archery competition.

560
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:28,843
It's the oldest and for our
county it's more than a contest.

561
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,472
- It's a national holiday.
- Great idea!

562
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:36,476
What's more, complimentary to you,

563
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:41,481
I will grant immunity to the Saxons
who will participate.

564
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,441
What do you think?

565
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,693
I am very grateful to you.

566
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:49,990
But mind you,
the Saxons have always won.

567
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,288
The contest has always been won
by a Nottingham.

568
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,125
It won't be me
to break this tradition.

569
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,377
A fine tradition.

570
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:06,006
But now it's more important
to fight Sir Robert.

571
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:11,094
That's why I want to mock him
in front of the people.

572
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,390
The humiliation of defeat
strikes more than an arrow.

573
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,436
Maybe, but if they arrest you
our cause is lost.

574
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,147
We have to go with you.

575
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,984
That would be crazy.
The castle is full of armed men.

576
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,780
In the forest we are strong.

577
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,866
But if we give battle
in the open field...

578
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,828
If only the soldiers
were not there...

579
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:41,416
Sure, that's not a bad idea.

580
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,672
You're right. It's a great idea!

581
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,554
This time Robin Hood
is in our hands.

582
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,599
Are you sure of what
that lumberjack confided to you?

583
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,477
Yes, it costed me 20 pieces of gold.

584
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:03,063
Robin and his men
will attack Eldon Abbey today,

585
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,273
during the archery competition.

586
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:10,778
Right, gather the soldiers
and surround the abbey.

587
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,826
If the day is propitious, tonight
I will reinforce my prestige.

588
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:20,455
Robin Hood will lie in my prisons.

589
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,715
- Hurray for Sir Robert!
- Hurray!

590
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,356
See? Let them have fun
and the people will be with you.

591
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,609
Where is our guest?

592
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,155
Her handmaiden said
that she was getting ready.

593
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:56,158
Give me two apples.

594
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,128
What the hell
are they waiting for to start?

595
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,338
I don't know.

596
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,882
The people
are waiting for your signal.

597
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:17,262
- If I wait, the people also wait.
- Here she is.

598
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,191
Finally!

599
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,568
Why are you dressed like that?

600
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,156
It is tradition of the Saxon
to participate in the contest.

601
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,700
If you do not mind,
I will follow the tradition.

602
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,827
I will take part in the second round.

603
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,331
Nice girl. Who is she?

604
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,874
She's a Saxon from a noble family.

605
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,419
What is she doing among the Normans?

606
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:52,464
- A Saxon?
- Marianne of Manson.

607
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,091
Marianne!

608
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,304
The last time I saw her,
she was nine years old.

609
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,849
That doesn't seem like a reason
for being so upset.

610
01:00:05,017 --> 01:00:09,189
She was promised to me
by King Richard himself.

611
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,109
Watch out! What is it?

612
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,488
She is the lady who tried to save me
and who was taken by Sir Robert.

613
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:20,116
Now I understand!

614
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,993
She's a prisoner.

615
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:27,039
One more reason
for our presence here.

616
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,422
First eliminatory!

617
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:37,384
Number 1 to 10, get ready.

618
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,969
- Finally!
- Your turn! Good luck.

619
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:13,295
Sir Guy, that damned Robin Hood
hasn't shown up yet.

620
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:16,714
He'll show up sooner or later.
Let's wait.

621
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,259
Patience is the weapon of the strong.

622
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,561
Are still in the race:
Number 1, 10,

623
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,855
15, 18 and 20.

624
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:37,109
Targets in place!
Distance: 160 feet!

625
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:51,791
Numbers ten and fifteen.
The others are eliminated.

626
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:57,004
Targets in place.
Distance: 190 feet!

627
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:01,050
Milady, it is a real honor
to fight with you.

628
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:04,971
- The honor is all yours.
- It depends on your point of view.

629
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:08,433
Beating a woman
is not a great honor.

630
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,311
Nor for a lady to beat a rube.

631
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,986
Targets in place!
Distance,

632
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,364
220 feet!

633
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:28,077
That's too far for a woman.
I don't think you'll make it.

634
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:31,831
Save your breath or you'll be
out of it when you shoot.

635
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,131
It's too far for both of us.

636
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,301
I haven't pulled yet.

637
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,193
Number fifteen is eliminated.

638
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,532
As per tradition,

639
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,118
the remaining competitor
will fight in the final

640
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,163
with Sir Robert,
Lord of Nottingham!

641
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:20,046
You have been unlucky,
but rest assured, I will avenge you.

642
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:23,049
If he beat me,
that peasant will beat you too.

643
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:30,014
Four to one on number ten!

644
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,892
Who wants to place a bet?
I'm offering four to one!

645
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,687
- Anyone accepting?
- I'll bet six to one.

646
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,522
Agreed.

647
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,860
Do you bet, young man?
Special offer.

648
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,780
- Three to one!
- I'm in!

649
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,907
Good, thank you.

650
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,619
Blessed are the simple
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

651
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,288
Three to one on the ten!

652
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,583
Are you a lumberjack?

653
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:01,045
More or less.
I actually work in the trees.

654
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,297
Nice work! It pays well.

655
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,967
Yours also pays well.

656
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:09,429
But it doesn't keep
as well in training.

657
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,224
You know how to throw decent
"darts" with your tongue!

658
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,811
Let's see if you are
just as skilled with the bow.

659
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:30,032
Targets in place.
Distance: 320 feet!

660
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:51,429
By all the saints!
No one has ever lasted that long.

661
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:56,017
I'll tell you what.
There's no use wasting any more time.

662
01:04:56,809 --> 01:05:00,354
- Last shot at the same target.
- Which one?

663
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,526
That one!

664
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,903
The weather vane on the tower.

665
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:11,073
Impossible. No bow can reach it.

666
01:05:11,323 --> 01:05:13,409
Yes, one.

667
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,537
Nottingham's bow.

668
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,956
That bow doesn't bend.
It's made of wood that's too hard.

669
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,710
It is said that only the Nottinghams
know how to bend it.

670
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,755
I am the Earl of Nottingham.

671
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,926
Give me the bow.

672
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:34,639
- There won't be a winner.
- There's already a loser anyway.

673
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:06,295
This bow can't be used.
It's too old.

674
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:10,091
If you allow, I should still try it.

675
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:28,150
Bravo, Robin!

676
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,909
Robin Hood?

677
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,663
- In person.
- You will pay for your impudence.

678
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:44,751
- You promised immunity!
- Murderer!

679
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,127
Executioner!

680
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,550
People of Nottingham!

681
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:56,470
These are the lying words
of Sir Robert and the Regent.

682
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:00,057
This is how they intend to pay
King Richard's ransom.

683
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,018
Arrest him!

684
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:02,036
To the castle!

685
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,920
Quick, to the horses!

686
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,678
Come with me! Let's go!

687
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,515
This time we have
earned them honestly.

688
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,476
I feel a little remorse!

689
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:30,940
Get on!

690
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:42,702
Robin Hood! Nice guy!

691
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,955
I know him.
He passed by here last night

692
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,000
bringing a large offering
for the abbey.

693
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,879
By the way.
He also left a note

694
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,257
for a certain Sir Guy.

695
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,217
That's me!

696
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,763
What a lucky coincidence! Here.

697
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,436
"With a thousand thanks.
Now you can go home

698
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:14,191
and say hello to Sir Robert for me.
Your affectionate Robin Hood."

699
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:18,195
I told you
that he was such a nice guy.

700
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:33,335
Here you are among friends.
Welcome among the merry men!

701
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,840
I see you got the girl.

702
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,592
We, the vile metal!

703
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,469
A hundred pieces of gold!

704
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:44,722
Put them with the others.

705
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,183
Tuck!

706
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,894
Make some food and drink.
It's a party for everyone!

707
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:57,985
Sad day for the Normans!

708
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:01,280
Saxon holiday
and Saxon winner. Bravo!

709
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,201
Add that we took away
Marianne of Manson as well.

710
01:10:09,621 --> 01:10:11,373
Have you told her yet?

711
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:16,295
Not yet.

712
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:24,345
- Marianne...
- How dare you?

713
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,850
You have freed me, but you have
no rights. You are a bandit.

714
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,393
If my fiancé were here,
you would regret this!

715
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,941
Sorry, I didn't know
that you were already betrothed.

716
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,401
Who is the lucky guy?

717
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:41,821
Sir Henry of Nottingham,
squire of King Richard.

718
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,950
I see. A nobleman.

719
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,161
You have not lost
your impetuous temperament!

720
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,664
Alan, protect me from this man.

721
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,960
This is not necessary.

722
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:59,213
Perhaps our guest
preferred to stay at the castle.

723
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:01,382
As a Saxon I prefer to stay here.

724
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:04,844
But don't dare anymore
to take advantage of the situation.

725
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:10,432
- Did you see that temper?
- I saw the slap she gave you!

726
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:14,561
- Why don't you tell her who you are?
- I like her.

727
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,814
- She's wonderful.
- So?

728
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:22,987
I want her to love me,
not because we're already engaged.

729
01:11:23,695 --> 01:11:27,449
Robin Hood against Sir Henry!

730
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,496
It's going to be quite a battle.

731
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,791
Mocked in front of everyone!

732
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,837
Robin Hood has snatched
Marianne of Manson from me

733
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:43,465
while you take
my soldiers to the convent.

734
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:45,634
- All of this is crazy.
- Milord!

735
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:48,095
Regent Prince John is coming.

736
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,767
Sir Guy, remember
that before my head,

737
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,602
yours will fall.

738
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,156
- Highness.
- Excuse my sudden arrival.

739
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:09,158
Don't worry.

740
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,618
I have heard
what happened to you.

741
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:15,122
That bandit played you well.

742
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,293
By the way, dear Sir Robert,

743
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:22,964
I have decided to take advantage of
your hospitality for a few days.

744
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,049
It is a great honor.

745
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:28,970
I am happy to know that you are still
giving me your benevolence again.

746
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,805
Why would I deny you?

747
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,433
You have been skillful
to extort from the people

748
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:37,019
the tributes for the ransom
of my brother.

749
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,065
I want to show
to this generous people

750
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,400
all our good faith

751
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,820
and tear from their hearts
their beloved Robin Hood.

752
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,491
- It won't be as simple as you think.
- As simple as that.

753
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:53,244
We will pay the ransom.

754
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:58,415
After all, Richard is my brother.

755
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:00,292
Blood of my blood.

756
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:03,462
Are you thinking of sending
the money to the emperor?

757
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:07,091
Yes, and I intend to
give great prominence to the fact.

758
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:09,801
You will hold a public ceremony.

759
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:13,472
Everyone will know that
John fulfills his fraternal duty

760
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,224
all the way!

761
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:21,188
A good piece of cheese
will make your melancholy go away.

762
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,607
No, thank you.

763
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:29,196
Usually that expression
comes from an empty stomach.

764
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,366
Maybe it's about love?

765
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:35,327
I don't understand why a man like you
has to be so...

766
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:38,789
- So boor?
- Worse, so vulgar.

767
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,085
As you know

768
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,505
unfortunately, I'm not a nobleman.

769
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:50,551
- No, it's not because of that.
- I get it!

770
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,970
You dislike me because I beat you.

771
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,306
I was beaten by Robin Hood,

772
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,100
Nottingham county champion.

773
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,979
I imagine
you care about your title.

774
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:05,107
No, I participated in the race

775
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,943
only because it was useful
to the cause of my king.

776
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:13,240
Sorry, this shows a noble soul.

777
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:17,578
Maybe,
but unfortunately only the soul.

778
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:20,372
To please you I should have
also a blazon.

779
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,334
You forget that
I am already promised.

780
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:26,128
Yeah, with the famous Sir Henry.

781
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:29,423
What kind of man is he?

782
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:33,260
Well... he's tall,
handsome and brave.

783
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,888
- Then he looks like me.
- He is different.

784
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,350
- In what?
- Robin.

785
01:14:39,891 --> 01:14:41,310
- Robin.
- What is it?

786
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:44,396
The regent has announced that
he will pay King Richard's ransom.

787
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,648
- When?
- The gold will leave tomorrow.

788
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:49,818
The primate of England will bless it
at the presence of the people.

789
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:53,030
Good! This means
the return of Richard.

790
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,075
- Do you really believe that?
- No.

791
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:00,412
That gold won't make it past London

792
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:04,166
if we don't make it arrive
to the right address.

793
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:10,339
My dear, the return of your fiancé
is now imminent.

794
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,050
I am happy about it.
Overjoyed!

795
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,469
- Are you sure?
- More than ever!

796
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:18,805
On that day,
one of us will have to die.

797
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:21,642
Sir Henry or Robin Hood.

798
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,613
Place the seals.

799
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:56,302
God willing this money
claimed by Emperor Henry VI

800
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,513
and paid for with the labor
of the English people

801
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:03,725
bring us soon the joy of making
our brother free again,

802
01:16:03,975 --> 01:16:06,603
the beloved sovereign of England,

803
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,980
King Richard the Lionheart.

804
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,069
You may carry it.

805
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,727
Long live King Richard!

806
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,418
How many are there?

807
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,712
Many, but we'll make it anyway.

808
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,340
I will give the signal
when the knights have passed

809
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:19,260
and just before the wagon.
On your marks!

810
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:21,345
- You, come with me!
- Forward!

811
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:26,933
More resin.
They need to make a nice bonfire.

812
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,177
Bandits!

813
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:22,239
Come on!

814
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,365
Get off the horse.

815
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:51,620
Good!

816
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:54,331
Now throw down your sword.

817
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:02,714
My friend, it is destiny
that I save you once again.

818
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,842
But you have to let everyone know

819
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:09,555
what the merry men can do. Now go!

820
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,392
Go!

821
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,279
- Here they are!
- It's them!

822
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:41,169
We have won!

823
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:44,130
We have the gold! Victory!

824
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,925
Hooray!

825
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,101
Congratulations, Robin.

826
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:59,187
- As usual you are invincible.
- Indeed.

827
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:02,399
My sweet and aristocratic Marianne.

828
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,693
Why? Do you mind?

829
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:08,447
On the contrary. Thanks to you
Sir Henry's return is near.

830
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,157
This makes you happy.
I know it does.

831
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:15,746
You know less than you think you do.

832
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,330
Robin.

833
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:21,126
Shall we enjoy the sight of
this heaven-sent offering?

834
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,379
I would say yes! Unload it.

835
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,923
100,000 pieces of gold,
you see once in a lifetime.

836
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:31,428
Right! Help.
Come on.

837
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,014
Careful.

838
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,620
They tricked us!

839
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:03,418
Our regent is clever.

840
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:10,551
Now everyone will know
that Robin Hood stole the ransom.

841
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:15,597
And King Richard will be lost.

842
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:19,017
We need to find that gold.
Absolutely!

843
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:24,690
They must have replaced the chest
along the road

844
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,900
between Nottingham and the forest.

845
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,656
There is one place where they could
have brought it without being seen.

846
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,116
To the castle!

847
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,578
The castle!

848
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:43,792
40-foot walls, massive gates and
more soldiers than fleas on a dog.

849
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:48,213
Yeah, but you forget it's my house.

850
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:10,235
The emperor will not forgive
the non-payment of the ransom.

851
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:15,240
On the appointed date, the destiny
of Richard will be fulfilled.

852
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,702
John will be king of England.

853
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:22,288
And you will be the most
important man in the kingdom.

854
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,628
Your plans and dreams
are coming true.

855
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:30,338
But don't forget mine.

856
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:33,049
Before anything else,

857
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:35,969
we have to catch that damn bandit.

858
01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:39,556
Along with him, Marianne of Manson.

859
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,685
Be careful, Robert.

860
01:23:44,435 --> 01:23:47,313
That Saxon can bring you
only bad luck.

861
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:53,987
Before they discover the deception
the emperor will receive the ransom.

862
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:56,948
Quick, let's get them out of here.

863
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,159
Tuck, get the torch.

864
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,422
Blessed be the Lord!

865
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,633
What a beautiful rosary!

866
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,471
Enough now
with that of chickpeas and beans.

867
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:34,986
What's going on?

868
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,830
- Forgive me, Robin.
- Let's escape.

869
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:47,833
No, one moment.

870
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,627
The door!

871
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,880
If they notice the theft, it's over.

872
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:57,383
We'd never get to the forest and
Richard's fate would be doomed.

873
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:00,178
- What do we do then?
- I'll stay here,

874
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:02,388
so they won't suspect the theft.

875
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:07,393
Quick, do as I say. Go!

876
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:16,402
Go immediately to Germany and
deliver the gold to the emperor.

877
01:25:17,528 --> 01:25:20,866
From this moment the king's life
is in your hands.

878
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:22,701
Have faith.

879
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,144
Too bad!

880
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:53,148
One moment later,
and I would have tricked you again.

881
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,574
You took too much advantage
of your good fortune.

882
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,161
This time it's over for you.

883
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:09,497
In the name of our beloved lord,

884
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,582
Earl of Nottingham,

885
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:16,880
it is announced that the bandit known
by the name of Robin Hood

886
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:21,927
will be executed at the next moon

887
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:25,722
for the crimes of robbery, murder,

888
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:31,812
felony and for treason against
the king and people of England.

889
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,901
It's all my fault!

890
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:41,487
The Lord listened to me more when
I prayed with chickpeas and beans.

891
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:44,324
We can't let him die like this.

892
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:46,868
But what?
Even the people have abandoned us.

893
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:50,330
- There are four cats left.
- Listen to me.

894
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,960
I know what to do.

895
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:04,260
What you propose is acceptable.

896
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,847
But what guarantees will I have?

897
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,808
If I release Robin Hood,

898
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:13,019
and then you in front of the altar
refused to marry me,

899
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,063
I would be tricked twice.

900
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:18,900
You have my word.

901
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:21,903
I'm a Saxon, don't forget that.

902
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:25,323
Don't forget you
that by proposing a marriage

903
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,575
you already miss your word

904
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:31,579
with Sir Henry of Nottingham,
if I'm not mistaken.

905
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,499
If you wanted to humiliate me,

906
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,836
you succeeded.

907
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:41,047
Now give me your answer.

908
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:44,759
I like you, Marianne.
I've always liked you.

909
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:46,594
I accept.

910
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:49,305
But I will free your dear bandit

911
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:52,809
only when our marriage
has taken place.

912
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,122
Stand up and follow me.

913
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:18,126
It is only for your own good.

914
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:58,374
Enter.

915
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,670
Robin, my love.

916
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:54,639
You mean I managed to beat
even Sir Henry?

917
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,644
I don't even remember his face.

918
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,112
- Which door?
- The one on the west bastion.

919
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,291
Thank you, Matilde.

920
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:25,503
Don't thank me.
I am a woman in love as well.

921
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:30,925
With him free,
you will not marry Sir Robert.

922
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:35,221
Milord, my fidelity
is greater than any sum.

923
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:38,474
- Here, they're yours.
- Thank you.

924
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,824
This time you are wrong.

925
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:01,331
You've lost the game by now, Matilde.

926
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,874
No, not yet.

927
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:07,503
You will never marry that woman.

928
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:10,631
I would rather kill you.

929
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:33,529
Stop!
One more step and I'll kill her.

930
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:38,159
Drop the sword.

931
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:43,373
Take him away. Away!

932
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:51,589
We will celebrate the wedding
in the square of Nottingham

933
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:55,176
in front of all the people

934
01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:57,928
and of course your Robin.

935
01:31:58,971 --> 01:32:01,932
No witness was ever so welcome.

936
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:10,150
Their signal! I'll go ahead.

937
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:14,028
Why? I want to see for myself
what they can do.

938
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:32,588
Halt! Who are you?

939
01:32:32,838 --> 01:32:34,465
Men of Courage.

940
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:38,136
If you are also, fight
with me one at a time.

941
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:42,640
Sure. You know what you sound
like to me? A tin knight!

942
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:46,561
You've come at the right time. It's
been a long time since we fought.

943
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:50,356
If you want a taste of this club,
get off that mule.

944
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:52,608
I'm ready.

945
01:32:57,029 --> 01:33:00,158
For a club my shield is enough.

946
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:06,872
Now get ready to receive
the holy blessing.

947
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:49,790
- Is there anyone else?
- Me!

948
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:54,629
You'd better take the sword with me.

949
01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:07,725
We'll see if you're better
than your friend.

950
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,825
Are you afraid to attack?

951
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:38,548
If I didn't stop the sword, your
head would end up like your stick.

952
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:43,553
Only one sword in the world
can cut through iron.

953
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,473
King Richard!

954
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:50,244
Marianne, those archers are ready
in case of your refusal.

955
01:36:03,173 --> 01:36:06,051
Fear not, I will keep my word.

956
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:17,480
According to the rite
of our Holy Mother Church

957
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:20,065
Catholic, Apostolic, Roman,

958
01:36:20,316 --> 01:36:23,611
will you, Sir Robert,
minister of England

959
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:26,697
and Earl of Nottingham,
be joined in matrimony

960
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:29,575
to Marianne of Manson?

961
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:33,954
- Yes.
- And you, Marianne of Manson,

962
01:36:34,204 --> 01:36:38,208
do you wish to be joined in matrimony
with Sir Robert

963
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:41,337
and acknowledge him
as your lord and husband?

964
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,813
No, I don't want to!

965
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:01,774
Archers!

966
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,155
My King!

967
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:12,910
King Richard, my brother!

968
01:37:24,755 --> 01:37:26,466
Right on time!

969
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:45,359
Does anyone have any objections
to the marriage

970
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,778
between Marianne of Manson

971
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:51,824
and Sir Robert,
self-styled Earl of Nottingham?

972
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:53,951
I, sire.

973
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:56,787
Marianne of Manson
is already promised.

974
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:59,957
I ask you to let me fight him
to avenge all the crimes

975
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:02,001
committed by this man.

976
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:03,878
I refuse it.

977
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:07,131
A nobleman has the right
to fight with his equal.

978
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:09,258
Indeed it is.

979
01:38:09,925 --> 01:38:12,678
You will fight
against Sir Henry of Nottingham,

980
01:38:12,928 --> 01:38:14,764
my first squire.

981
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:17,683
Let him go.

982
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,358
I told you that one day
one of the two,

983
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:29,737
Robin Hood or Sir Henry,
would disappear.

984
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,614
Your sword!

985
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:38,538
I am ready.

986
01:40:58,260 --> 01:40:59,970
Walk!

987
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:06,560
Hooray for Robin!
Hooray for Sir Henry!

988
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,945
Kneel before your king.

989
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:24,620
Majesty,
it is up to you to dispose of his life.

990
01:41:26,205 --> 01:41:29,541
Mercy! I have carried out
the orders of your brother.

991
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:33,045
Don't believe him!
He alone betrayed you.

992
01:41:33,295 --> 01:41:36,131
- Coward!
- Now you're going to die, damn you!

993
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:38,634
You will end your days
in the Tower of London

994
01:41:38,884 --> 01:41:41,261
with your accomplices
take them away.

995
01:41:42,554 --> 01:41:45,766
Let go of me! Let go of me!

996
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:47,852
I am your king.

997
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:50,896
I am the king. Let go of me!

998
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,275
But Robin is dead.

999
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:58,487
The winner is Sir Henry.

1000
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:02,783
I forgot. You loved Robin.

1001
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:05,452
Henry.

1002
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,872
My Lord.

1003
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:11,751
My bride!

1004
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:14,754
Thief! Sacrilegious! Bandit!

1005
01:42:15,004 --> 01:42:17,422
I'll deprived you of holy orders.

1006
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,718
I will have you excommunicated.
Heretic!

1007
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:25,389
From now on I shall be the officiant
of the earls of Nottingham.

1008
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:32,229
- Right, Sir Henry?
- True, Friar Tuck.

1009
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:36,817
It is up to me to celebrate
this marriage.

1010
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:38,986
I'm ready.

1011
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:46,243
I've been dreaming of
a dress like this for a long time!

1012
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:55,669
How dare you make fun of
a representative of the church?

1013
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:58,798
- Feel the weight of my authority!
- No, Friar Tuck.

1014
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:02,342
The time for sticks
and for fighting.

1015
01:43:03,218 --> 01:43:06,221
Now is time for love.
