Uh, look.

100
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,723

two freak shows,

101
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,991
one who can barely dance.

102
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,561

my last memory of this business

00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,656
I just somebody to tell me
that this isn't a terrible idea.

177
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:27,559
Oh, this is a horrible idea.
But you can't take it back now.

178
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,461
So get the fuck
on the Van.

179
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,898
Let's go.
Yeah!

180
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,367
This is like when Justin
came back to backstreet.

181
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,104
You fucking kidding me?
Justin was in nsync.

182
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,707
Kevin Richardson came back
to Backstreet in 2012.

183
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,274
Get your Orlando history
straight.

184
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,043
I'm not from Orlando.
I don't give a shit.

185
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,644
Well, you know who does give
a shit?

186
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,113
People who actually have
musical taste.

187
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:50,049
Backstreet was
the only legitimate boy band

188
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,084
that ever came out of Florida,
period.

189
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,853
And that conversation
just happened.

00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,287

00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,311
This thing's fucking crazy.
Right?

203
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,848
Hey, so, I got my, uh,
my buddy Martín.

204
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,950
He hooked me up with his uncle's
old roach coach.

205
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,718
And then I got Tarzan
back there

206
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,854
to paint it up
all sick Picasso style.

207
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,990
Yeah, I mean, I'm mostly
an oil-on-canvas guy,

208
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,860
but I did the best I could.

209
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,295
What exactly are y'all doing
out of it, though?

210
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,098
I'm making artisanal
probiotic Froyo.

211
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,767

215
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,607
We'll keep your feet loose
and satisfy your sweet tooth.

348
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,434
Shamwow us
with your ingenious invention.

349
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,270
Come on, rich, man.
Tito laid his shit out.

350
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,605
Everybody's cool.
Just tell us.

351
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,373
It's us, bro.

352
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,641
Just tell us, man.

353
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,176
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

354
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:05,711
All right.

355
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,746
But if any of you motherfuckers
steals my idea,

356
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,780
I swear to God I will...

357
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,616
Why you got to point
at the fucking Mexican

358
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,750
when you say "steals," dude?

359
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,585
We get it.
Just... just go.

360
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,154
Let's have it, tough guy.

361
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,890
Condomints.

362
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,993
What are the two most important
things you need to take with you

363
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,129
when you go out on the weekend?

364
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,931
Ketchup and mustard?

365
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,735
Your condoms and your mints.

366
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,837
Oh, my... what?

367
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,473
I put them together in one
package, like a pack of gum.

368
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,808
Sell it at a gas station.

369
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,143
"Condomints."

370
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,045
It's not bad.
Boom!

371
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,114
Um, they... they already
have that shit, bitch.

372
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,218
You can get it.

373
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,387
I get it all the time
at the minimart.

374
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,921
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,625
They're at every single circle k
and 7-Eleven across Florida.

376
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,261
I'm so sorry, man.

377
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:58,063
Hey, Richie, they didn't
sign the nondisclosure, man.

378
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,431
Sorry about it.

379
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,832
Hey, Richie,
don't worry about it.

380
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,468
I got something for you...
Top secret, man.

381
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,504
Imagine this.
A small, little rectangle. Okay?

382
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,039
You hold it up to your ear,
you speak into it,

383
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,009
somebody in a distant land
with the exact same thing

384
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,378
can hear it.

385
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,079
I just haven't come up with
a name for it.

386
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,814
I was figuring...

387
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,284
Fuck... you.
I'm so sorry, man.

388
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,018
Oh, God.

389
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,522
Hey, I forgot to ask you...
You still with Mercedes?

390
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,123
No.

391
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:28,460
We agreed to try monogamy,
and you know Mercedes.

392
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,896
That shit lasted
for about two seconds.

393
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,499
Wow. That fucking sucks.
I'm sorry.

394
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,235
Ah, it's like Oprah said,
man...

395
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,707
"when someone shows you
themselves, believe them."

396
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,343
What? Really?

397
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,412
Really? I... okay. Yeah, really.
That's what she said.

398
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,146
Are we doing
this passive-aggressive shit?

399
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,748
Okay. Fine. That's not
passive-aggressive, that's Oprah.

400
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,182
Let's fucking make it
aggressive.

401
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,785
How about this? Let's do
a little therapy session here.

402
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,454
Old-school...
Old-school therapy session.

403
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:56,888
Get up. Let's go. We're gonna
get this out in one swing.

404
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,590
Are we fucking primates now, man?
Come on.

405
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,659
Get it out in one hit and let's
not talk about it anymore.

406
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,362
I get it. You're mad that... that I fucking
left. This is seriously fucking stupid.

407
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,830
Come on, baby.
Let's go. Right here.

408
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,765
Just don't hit me in the fucking nuts.
Bam. Wow.

409
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,534
Are you kidding me? Stop being a pussy.
Everybody fucking happy?

410
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:09,901
Stop being a pussy. Let's go.
No, man.

411
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,603
Don't you call me a fucking
pussy, Christian Bale.

412
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,071
No. He didn't call you a pussy.

413
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,307
He... he just said you exhibited
pussy-like behavior.

414
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,042
Y'all want to unleash the fucking tiger?
It's just the behavior of a pussy.

415
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,510
Is that what you want? Come on!
Release the demon!

416
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,911
Oh! Shit!

417
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,380
Tiger's out.

418
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,488
Are you okay, man?

419
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,490
You feel better?

420
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,158
No, man,
I don't fucking feel better.

421
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,893
That was seriously fucked up.

422
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,595
Okay.

423
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:37,863
Good.
You all right?

424
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:39,831
Yeah.
I just got to pee a little.

425
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,267
Everybody happy? You get
your fucking gladiator show?

426
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,569
That was fucking awesome.

427
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,036
No, it wasn't fucking awesome,
man.

428
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,838
There are a lot better ways
to handle that shit.

429
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,840
It's our last fucking ride.
I'm outta here.

430
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,276
You know, it's always
the pretty ones, like Bundy.

431
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,780
It is, man.

432
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:00,519
There you go. That's it.
That... that's perfect.

433
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,238
Yo.That's
protected land, sir!

434
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:23,809
You're destroying sea Turtle
biosphere with that urine.

435
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,677
Are you serious right now?
Come on.

436
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,046
Really? All right.
Well, don't look at me.

437
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,315
Look out into the ocean.
Got it. I got it.

438
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,650
Get the picture here?
I'm running out.

439
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,719
Yes. Thank you.
I'm done.

440
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,054
That's... that's it.
There we go.

441
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:40,826
That's... that's usually what
happens when I pee on the beach.

442
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,328
Yeah. Yeah.

443
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,864
Drag queens. That's, uh...

444
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,999
Ooh,
doing Drag Queen stuff.

445
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,368
You love Drag Queens.

446
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,737
Yep.

447
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:55,140
I am one,
so I seek out my people.

448
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,276
You are one? You are one?
Mm-hmm. On the inside.

449
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,377
Got it.
Mostly.

450
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,612
Of course
it's on the inside.

451
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:01,847
Yeah.
What's her name?

452
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,248
Dolly Titz.

453
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,282
Dolly Tits?

454
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:05,283
With a "z."

455
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,351
With a "z."
Mm-hmm.

456
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,419
Where is she from?

457
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,620
Here.
Okay.

458
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,256
And she loves couponing
and Nascar.

459
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,124
I got an inner Drag Queen, too.

460
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,325
Oh. Really?
Yeah.

461
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,227
Okay. I figured.

462
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,896
Uh, what's her name?

463
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,731
Her name is...

464
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,333
Clitoria Labia is her name.

465
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,835
That's actually not bad.

466
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,037
It's not bad at all.
She's... she's the main bitch.

467
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,574
She's like Cheetara
and Grace Jones.

468
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,743
And they always sing
"Rapper's Delight"

469
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,278
everywhere they go.

470
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:41,620
So, you and your friends, um,
frequent drag shows, do you?

471
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:43,889
No.
Not... well, somet...

472
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,558
We just do it on the way up
to myrtle beach every year.

473
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,660
Right.
Oh, right.

474
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,563
This stripper convention
that I keep hearing about.

475
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,500
Yep.
It's the infamous convention.

476
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:57,002
Which one are you, then?
You, um...

477
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,103
Which what?

478
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:02,474
Are you Cop in a thong
or Iron Man in a thong?

479
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,743
I am... I am...

480
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,678
You're gonna have to pay
to see that.

481
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,080
That's what I am.

482
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:12,751
Or I'll just load up on all
those fantastic '80s hair bands

483
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,553
for my drive instead.

484
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:15,687
Where you going?
Where you headed?

485
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:19,057
Uh...
Just on the road again.

486
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:21,226
New York this time.
Okay.

487
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,994
Um, and I...

488
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,164
Basically, I'm just trying to
avoid ending up on the pole.

489
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,533
Like you.

490
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,267
But you never know.

491
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:32,103
"Stripper pissing on beach
in contemplative pose"

492
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,939
could sell for thousands
one day.

493
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,341
If that's true,
then I will whip it out

494
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:39,611
and start peeing on whatever
you tell me to pee on,

495
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,613
and we can just...
We can cash in.

496
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:44,449
Fantastic.
I love the Enthusiasm.

497
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,951
Save some of it, though,

498
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:49,054
because you and I are gonna
untie that sailboat over there

499
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,723
and organize a first-ever
cross-dressing search party

500
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:52,791
out to that island.

501
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:53,925
What do you say?

502
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,728
Uh...
Win or Die, stripper guy.

503
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,764
I-I say that, um...

504
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,166
I would actually love
to do that.

505
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,635
But I'd say I know what happens
on that island,

506
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:06,638
and I just... that's just...
Mm-hmm.

507
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,006
I think I'm gonna opt out.

508
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,309
Oh.
What happens on that island?

509
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,113
It's just I know what happens
for me on that island.

510
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,515
Oh, I see.

511
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,851
You think I'm gonna hook up
with you. Mm.

512
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,220
That's not at all what I said.
At all.

513
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,189
That's the farthest thing
from what I said.

514
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,224
'Cause I said I would want to go
to that island,

515
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,159
and then I know
what I would do

516
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,261
and then somehow that probably
wouldn't work out

517
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,598
on any level that I would
want it to work out on,

518
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,999
and then I think

519
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,401
that it's probably better
if I just go back.

520
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,869
Yeah.

521
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,037
Wow.

522
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,138
Okay.

523
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:44,042
Well, fret not, Casanova.
You're safe with me.

524
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,578
I'm not going through
a guy phase anyway.

525
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,013
Oh.

526
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,415
Well, in that case,
that makes things easier.

527
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:53,151
Yeah. 'Cause then
all the more reason

528
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,788
for me to probably just go do
the good-night thing.

529
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,223
Okay. Yeah.

530
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,892
It was nice to meet you, though,
Dolly Titz.

531
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:04,063
Back at you, Clitoria.

532
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,418
Good morning.
Good morning.

533
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,055
You sleep okay?

534
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:33,191
Yeah.
Actually, I did.

535
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,393
Mm-hmm.

536
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:40,365
My meditation was really clear
this morning, man.

537
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:44,704
I just... just feel like I got
a lot of the negativity out.

538
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,438
That's... that's good.

539
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,573
Yeah.
That's good.

540
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,209
I'm happy you feel lighter.

541
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:54,780
I'm happy you finally got
what you wanted, man.

542
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,014
Yeah?
I am.

543
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:58,449
No. I... we say shit
all the fucking time,

544
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,885
but you went and did it,
man.

545
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,953
I'm jealous.
Oh... oh, shut the fuck up.

546
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,922
All right?
I'm fucking jealous. I am.

547
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,924
No. If there's anybody
that was jealous, it was me.

548
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:08,426
What? Every time I would come
over to your apartment...

549
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,628
Remember?
I'd put on your tide commercial.

550
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,464
That shit was dope.

551
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,902
♪ For that extra clean! ♪
♪ For that extra clean! ♪

552
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:19,537
Ding!
Oh, shit.

553
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:20,906
I mean, Lookit.

554
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:22,507
I would...
I would think to myself,

555
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:25,010
"I'd be set if I could just get
to where Ken was."

556
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,477
Yeah, I'm real set here.

557
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,813
I'm real set.

558
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,248
My agent's got me doing
Youtube videos now, man.

559
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,251
So what are you gonna do
after this weekend?

560
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:36,121
Send my head shot around,
hope for the best.

561
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:40,092
There's a casting director comes
by the club sometimes, so...

562
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:43,594
I'm still pretty.

563
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,197
Yeah.

564
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:50,769
I know you're still pretty,
but look at these guys.

565
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,271
What are they gonna do
after this?

566
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,806
I don't know.

567
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,008
Morning, gorgeous.

568
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,510
Oh, my God,
did you guys even sleep?

569
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,882
Are the girls still here
or they leave?

570
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:07,118
Oh, they left about a...
About an hour ago.

571
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:11,122
Did you, uh,
did you bangee?

572
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,259
You bangee?
Show him the thing.

573
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,528
Wow.

574
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,997
That's... okay.

575
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:22,100
She said if I had reason to call
before it faded,

576
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,835
then maybe it was meant to be.

577
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:26,337
Oh.
That's... that's romantic.

578
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,474
They're staying in Charleston
tonight, so...

579
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,242
I don't know.
It's smack dab on our way.

580
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,911
Maybe it was meant to be.
Yeah, man.

581
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,913
Good work on that,
by the way.

582
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,247
What about you?

583
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,183
Did you bangee?

584
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,918
No.
No?

585
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,188
I haven't had actual sex
in almost five months.

586
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:46,524
Every time a chick gets...
A look at it,

587
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,494
she's like, "how about
a blow job or hand job?"

588
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,262
Well...

589
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,664
Just got to find
the right lady, man.

590
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,266
That's unfortunate for you.

591
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,869
It's like a blessing and a curse
at the same time, huh?

592
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,337
Laugh at my plight.

593
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,807
Look, m-maybe it's like
the glass slipper, man.

594
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:04,309
You just need to find
the right one.

595
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,211
Dude, I'm 35 years old,
okay?

596
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:08,847
If it hasn't happened already,
it ain't gonna happen.

597
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,681
Let's face it,
I'm probably fucked.

598
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,317
Oh.
All right.

599
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:14,786
On that note, uh, let's get
this circus back on the road.

600
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:17,255
Who wants to see if Tarzan died
in his sleep last night?

601
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,058
Fuck that, man.
I woke him up last time.

602
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,993
I'll do it.
I got it.

603
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:25,031
I'll clean up
the nonbiodegradables.

604
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,873
What's up, bro?

605
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,808
A little, uh,
breakfast of champions?

606
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,443
Molly?
Yeah.

607
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,245
You realize we'll be useless
in an hour.

608
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:42,180
What are you, fucking 12, dude?
Just take it.

609
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,982
Oh, fuck!
All right. Fine.

610
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,951
Guess I know
what today's gonna be like.

611
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:49,287
All right,
get your moon rocks!

612
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,957
All right. So what's the plan
about this thing?

613
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,524
Okay.
So we got it all planned out.

614
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,260
Tobias is gonna warm up
the crowd,

615
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:56,594
then we're gonna hit them

616
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,496
with the old 4th of July
army routine. Oorah.

617
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,365
That still makes me
feel like a warmonger

618
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,300
with everything going on
politically right now.

619
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,202
Oh, come on
with the hippie shit.

620
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,803
It's in season.
We're doing it.

621
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,373
Hey, if you want that Karma,
go for it, all right?

622
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:11,242
We're gonna hit them with
"Raining Men" right after.

623
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,243
Right.

624
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,212
Then Tobias is gonna intro
the solos.

625
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,380
Listen.

626
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:18,383
I think you should bring back
"Pony," bro.

627
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,485
I could do that.

628
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,553
And I'm...
Look, "Pony" is great.

629
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,156
I have, uh...
Can I pitch you something?

630
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,791
Let me just
throw something out.

631
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:30,095
And I completely understand that
I'm coming in at the 11th hour,

632
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:31,963
and I don't want to step
on toes.

633
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,099
But what if...

634
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,901
I mean, if this really is
our last ride,

635
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:38,669
what if we make up some new shit
and go out with a fucking bang

636
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,106
and just burn this shit down
with some new routines?

637
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:43,608
We... we can't do that, man.
We got two days.

638
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:47,045
I mean, Mike, that's what
we've rehearsed, man.

639
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:50,015
Yeah, and don't call our shit lame, bro.
You're right. You know what?

640
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,549
I'm not calling
your shit lame.

641
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,418
I'm just saying that cowboys
and firemen dancing to '80s rock

642
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,420
is not... not lame.
No. You know what is lame?

643
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,422
Looking like a bag of dicks
at our last convention

644
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,490
'cause we don't have
our fucking act straight.

645
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,491
Okay.
Point taken.

646
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,693
Let me ask you a question,
though.

647
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,429
Um... okay.

648
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,065
You're still doing, uh,
the fireman routine, right?

649
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,366
You know it.
All right.

650
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,335
Have you ever wanted to be
a fireman?

651
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,938
A real one?
Yes, a real fireman.

652
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,872
No.
I got the phobia thing.

653
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,274
You have a fire phobia.
Okay.

654
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:18,476
So, uh, you still doing it
to that... that kiss song?

655
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,978
Fuck, yeah.
"Hotter than Hell."

656
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,379
"Hotter than Hell."
Do you like that song?

657
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,480
Crushes.

658
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,482
I know it crushes,
but do you like it?

659
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,751
Do you play it
when you're not onstage?

660
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:28,219
I don't see your point
here.

661
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,355
My point is, if you don't
like it, why did you pick it?

662
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,023
Well, I didn't pick it.
Dallas did.

663
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,624
Exactly my point.
Dallas picked it.

664
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,726
You didn't pick it, so it's not
on the inside. You know what?

665
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,762
Just because you made up some of
your own routines back in the day

666
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:39,564
doesn't mean that you get to
waltz back in here

667
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,466
after three years and try to
tell us how to run our own shit.

668
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,368
I'm not trying to tell you
what the fuck to do. No!

669
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,802
I'm just say...
There is no fucking universe

670
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,140
in which I am not doing
that fireman routine!

671
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,310
You can find it, man.

672
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,145
You got to just, like,
let go, okay?

673
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,047
I fucking got it!
What? What?

674
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,116
Yo, it's like
a fucking real wedding,

675
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:00,051
- except like a fantasy.
- Oh, my God, dude!

676
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,519
And, like, I go out in the crowd...
Yes!

677
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,521
...and find myself, like,
a real fucking bride.

678
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,424
Oh, fuck! And I do
everything with her!

679
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,559
Like, I'll have a ring
and everything,

680
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,496
and I'll propose to her, and people
throw rice. They are throwing rice!

681
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,664
Rice out of our fucking pants! Yes.
Dude, they're fucking...

682
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,466
They're all... everyone's throwing rice.
It's just so complex.

683
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,901
Or birdseed. What are you
fucking talking about, man?!

684
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,469
Yo, man, I'm not
a fucking dancer like you.

685
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,238
I just can't come up with shit
on the spot.

686
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:23,241
No, it's not... it's not about
being a dancer, Richie.

687
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,709
It's not.
Okay, look.

688
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,678
"Pony"... it's not... that
wasn't a dance routine, okay?

689
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,848
All it was is I was at a party
and saw this badass girl.

690
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,317
And she was with
her boyfriend,

691
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:34,619
and he did not look like
he was hitting that shit right.

692
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,854
So that... that song came on,
and all I did was just...

693
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,390
All I did was just, like,
imagine what I would do to her.

694
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,359
That was it.
That was all "Pony" ever was.

695
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,094
No, man.
It sounds fucking complex.

696
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,363
Why is that... no, it's not.
Look at... look at you!

697
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:46,964
You're a fucking Greek God.

698
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,499
You could fucking tie
your shoe

699
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,435
and make some girl's
entire year, man.

700
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,936
It's just got to come from
in here.

701
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,938
Seriously? You just have to be you.
Yeah. I know so.

702
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,173
You know what?
Fuck that.

703
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:56,707
I bet you you can go in there
right now...

704
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,976
I bet you you can go in there
and fucking make her day.

705
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,845
Who, her? Tarzan: Hell, yeah.
Hell, yeah.

706
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,847
That girl looks like
she's never fucking smiled

707
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:05,216
in her entire fucking life.
Then that's your goal.

708
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:06,717
That is your goal. All the
more reason, man. What?

709
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,086
You got to go in there
and make her smile. No!

710
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:09,220
That's it.
That's all you've got to do.

711
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,521
Yes.
And if you... look.

712
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,390
If you can't do that,
then no one fucking can,

713
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,292
and I'll go back and do
the fucking old routines.

714
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,727
Oh, fuck! That's a fair deal.
That's a fair deal.

715
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,130
You're not a fucking...
You're not a fireman, Richie!

716
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,199
You're not a fireman.
I want to hear you say it.

717
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,867
"I'm not a fireman."
"I am not a fireman."

718
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,469
I want to hear you say...
Well, I'm not a fucking fireman.

719
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,304
You hate fire!
I'm a fucking male entertainer.

720
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:27,472
Exactly!
You're a male entertainer.

721
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,806
Right, man.
You can fucking do it.

722
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,007
Now go do it!
B.D.R.!

723
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,042
B.D.R.!

724
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:32,610
Come on!
B.D.R.! B.D.R.!

725
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:38,716
Make her day, dude.

726
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,785

That was spiritual,
man.

762
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,780
Yes!
I'm proud of you, buddy.

763
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,148
We can do this.

764
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,450
We can do this!
We can do this.

765
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:55,186
We've got to come up with
new shit, okay?

766
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,488
Fucking history right here,
okay?

767
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,390
This shit is history.
Gone.

768
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:02,092
We've got to get rid of it.
Out with the past.

769
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,694
I never wanted to be
in the Navy!

770
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,730
I don't want this "Top Gun" shit.
Fuck the Navy, man.

771
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:06,997
Yeah!
Gone!

772
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,567
Oh, baby!
It's time.

773
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:10,968
That shit itched.
It's time.

774
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,069
Boom.

775
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,338
Boom!
That's outta here, baby!

776
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,240
Fuck that thing!
Richie?

777
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:17,275
Done! Fireman over!
Not anymore.

778
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:19,377
I'm not a fireman anymore!

779
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,711
Get it outta here.
Don't, man. Don't.

780
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,347
I'll... I'll throw it away
when we get back.

781
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,581
No, no, no.
Now!

782
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,783
It's over.
History!

783
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:26,685
New stuff.

784
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:29,554
I love you guys.
I... look.

785
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:30,855
I've missed you guys
so much.

786
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,590
I know we're rolling face
right now,

787
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:35,226
but, like, I just need you guys
to know how much I love you.

788
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,127
I missed you so much, man.

789
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,463
There was a giant hole
inside of me

790
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:40,030
that was created
when you left.

791
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,732
I'm here now. And now I
feel like it's full again.

792
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,568
- I love you, man.
- Let's sync this shit up.

793
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,035
We gotta sync this up.

794
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,572
We're syncing up the energy.
I fucking love you, man!

795
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,674
Give me your hands, man.

796
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:50,808
Whoo!

797
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,077
I take it y'all motherfuckers
feel that?

798
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,111
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!

799
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:56,146
That is our energies, man.

800
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,082
We are connected.
Hold...

801
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,818
Toby! Toby, throw it back here,
brother. We need you.

802
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,253
Come on.
Come on, man, sync up.

803
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:04,221
Come on!
This is powerful, man!

804
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,923
You feel that rhythm?
Oh, yeah.

805
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,592
♪ Mm, mm-mm-mm ♪

806
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:08,759
Yeah.
Ooh, yeah.

807
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,861
♪ Mm, mm-mm-mm ♪
I love you guys!

808
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,029
That's our pulse, man.

809
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,332
I am so thankful
that we are all here together

810
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,566
on this last ride, man.

811
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,835
Everybody...
Everybody close your eyes

812
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:21,339
and let's just appreciate it,
not as six beings, but as one.

813
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,474
As one.
As one. As one unit, man.

814
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,009
One fucking unit.

815
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,944
As one. We've got to move
into the future as one.

816
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,547
As one unit.
One unit moving as one.

817
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:31,081
The past is over!

818
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,383
Yeah.

819
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:35,454
Shit!

820
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,427
Ugh.

821
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:43,861
Fuck!
What the hell happened?

822
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,530
Ow! Get off!
Get off my fucking leg!

823
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:46,531
Ugh. Fuck!

824
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:47,832
Is everybody okay?

825
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,335
No, I'm not fucking okay!
I'm not okay at all!

826
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:53,971
Oh, shit.
Hey, we got a man down!

827
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,673
Oh, fuck.
Where'd that come from?

828
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,442
He hit his fucking head there.
Oh, shit.

829
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:58,809
He's okay.

830
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,011
Your friend suffered
a Grade-2 concussion

831
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,212
and required some stitches.

832
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,815
So he's gonna live?
Yes.

833
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:08,386
He'll need to stay here
for 48 hours of observation.

834
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:09,387
He's in here.

835
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:10,888
My pupils bugging out?

836
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,523
Shh. Be cool.

837
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:15,593
You think she knows?

838
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,498
Oh, shit, man.

839
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,567
Hey. Toby.

840
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,502
What's up, buddy? Hey, bro.
What's up, man?

841
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:25,936
Oh, fuck.
Hey, guys.

842
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,037
I'm so fucking sorry.

843
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,873
No. No. I shouldn't have reached
for you, man.

844
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,641
Fuck, man.
I shouldn't have closed my eyes.

845
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,909
Well, that's
definitely true.

846
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,345
Fuck, yeah.
I mean, what were you thinking?

847
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:35,680
Hey. Hey, hey.
Go easy on him, man.

848
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:38,115
Come on. Look at him.
Easy? He's fine.

849
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:41,552
Right? Yeah, I'm fine, but
the fucking truck, man.

850
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:42,953
Yeah,
the truck is towed.

851
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,490
It's going to take a few days
to fix it.

852
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,392
But I think
we can afford it.

853
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,827
I just... I don't know
about the paint job.

854
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,397
It won't be original,
but, uh, I can get it close.

855
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:53,764
Are you in pain, man?

856
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,800
Yeah. They gave me a little bit
of something,

857
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:58,469
but it's just, like, shit.
Yeah, I'm feeling that.

858
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,939
What are you doing?

859
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,508
Reiki.

860
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,510
I'm a level-3 healer.

861
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:06,811
Oh, shit.

862
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,547
This fucking sucks.

863
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:12,349
No fucking M.C.
No fucking whip.

864
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,718
No fucking costumes!

865
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,152
That was a brilliant idea.

866
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,054
Throwing the fucking costumes
out the window?

867
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:20,090
Stupid! Just chill, man. No, man.
It's an Omen, okay?

868
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,626
It's a sign.

869
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:24,929
We're exactly where we're
supposed to be, all right?

870
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,699
Please spare us the fucking
Gandhi routine right now!

871
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,868
Okay.
You have so much anger, man.

872
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,137
And it is all in your heart
chakra, and it's fucking toxic.

873
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:35,840
Look, guys, please just chill. I
don't even know what that means!

874
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:38,308
Come on! This is the comedown
from the Molly.

875
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:42,146
Get a grip. God. You're Goddamn
right it's fucking comedown!

876
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,448
This trip's over!

877
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:46,283
All I wanted
was one more fucking ride!

878
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,152
Is that too much to ask?

879
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,620
Aw.

880
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,088
Is Richie gonna cry

881
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,257
because life isn't exactly
the way he wants it right now?

882
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,726
Oh, okay, Mr. C.E.O.

883
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,628
Why don't you take
your bullshit advice

884
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:00,665
and give it
to your fucking employees?

885
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,500
Employees?
I have one employee.

886
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,669
And I can't even pay
for his healthcare.

887
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,204
But I bust my ass every month
to keep it going.

888
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,273
So don't act like
we don't all have problems.

889
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:10,941
All right?
Oh, whatever, man.

890
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,844
I'm the one who told you coming
with us was a horrible idea.

891
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:18,783
Oh, it's been the year
of the horrible idea, man.

892
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,118
You want to see
another horrible idea?

893
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,054
I got one for you.

894
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,123
Bam.
There you go.

895
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:30,160
There's a nice, juicy
horrible idea for you.

896
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,529
Brooke said no?

897
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,331
Look, I had my life
all planned out with her.

898
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,834
All right? I...
It was all perfectly set up.

899
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,068
I had the house,
I had the dog,

900
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,537
I had "Downton Abbey"
on the weekends.

901
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,238
I even did the proposal
on the beach

902
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,241
with bacon and mimosas
and pancakes and all that.

903
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,476
And for whatever reason

904
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:47,545
that I'll probably never
understand...

905
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:48,913
She wanted something else.

906
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:51,048
So I came on this trip
with you fucks

907
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,283
to just try to get on
with it.

908
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,686
So I'm gonna be damned
if I'm gonna just let it end

909
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,455
right here and now.

910
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,790
You're right.

911
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,893
You're Goddamn right.

912
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:05,830
We can't let the train
stop here.

913
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,197
That's right.
No.

914
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,734
We got a Tsunami of dollar bills
to get to, daddy.

915
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,201
Oh, we're on a mission.
Fuck, yeah.

916
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,938
Look, we'll get another M.C.
Right, Tobias?

917
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:17,074
That's the energy
I'm talking about right there.

918
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,844
Look, we'll pick him up
on the way home.

919
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,846
All we got to do
is get a rental car.

920
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:25,583
We're not gonna need
a rental car, I don't think.

921
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,519
This is another horrible idea,
but...

922
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,355
I know an M.C. In Savannah.

923
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,366
Gentlemen.
Hey.

924
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,834
How can I be
of service?

925
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,170
Uh, is Rome in tonight?

926
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,838
Are you a member, sir?

927
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,273
N-no.
Not a...

928
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:52,142
No, we're not members.

929
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:55,245
Uh... I used to...

930
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,883
I used to dance here...
Before it was this.

931
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:00,851
Can you just do me a favor
and...

932
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,120
Just if you could get my name
to Rome.

933
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,221
Mike Lane.

934
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,256
And if... and if that doesn't do
the trick,

935
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,594
I guess we'll just stop
bothering you.

936
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:15,032
You can follow me.

937
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,467
Uh, y'all chill
down here.

938
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,837
I'll be back.

939
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,285
What's up?

940
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,595
Sit your ass down.

941
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,869
Malik, I'm sorry
for the surprise,

942
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,004
but a ghost is a ghost.

943
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:29,607
I'll see you downstairs
in a minute, okay?

944
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:33,277
So, they said
"Mike Lane and company."

945
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,812
Mm-hmm.

946
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:36,747
Who's your company?

947
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:39,416
It's what's left
of the kings of Tampa.

948
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,018
Oh, let me guess.

949
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:45,089
Mr. Crocodile Dundee
done did a little Houdini act?

950
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,357
Yep.

951
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,728
Mm-hmm.
Seems so.

952
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:52,830
Just so you know,

953
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:56,466
I got out on my own accord
three years ago.

954
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,370
But yet here you are.

955
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,640
You got my curiosity,
Mike.

956
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,744
Floor is yours.

957
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:08,212
No.

958
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:10,047
I was just in the neighborhood
and wanted to see

959
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:12,850
if I could stop by and borrow
a cup of brown sugar.

960
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:17,654
Boy, I tell you,
shit don't change, huh?

961
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,156
Always got to lead
with a joke

962
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,191
before you ask
for what you want.

963
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,794
No.

964
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,363
So, what did you do,

965
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:29,734
turn this place into some sort
of a country club or something?

966
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:31,168
Guess you could say that.

967
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,871
You know, back in the day
in the Roman empire,

968
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,640
as long as you paid the emperor
your taxes,

969
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:38,108
you could worship
who you wanted,

970
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:39,910
where you wanted,
how you wanted.

971
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,312
Freedom had a small price.

972
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:45,415
Do you know what people value
more than freedom, Mike?

973
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,017
Please say strippers.

974
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:47,819
Nope.

975
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,720
Beauty.

976
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:53,690
So, if beauty is something
you really wish to behold,

977
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,962
you can behold all the beauty
you want right here.

978
00:44:57,963 --> 00:45:01,732
All I ask is for
a little monthly fee, you know?

979
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:09,206
So it's a subscription-based
pleasure that you're selling?

980
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,942
You got it.

981
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:15,379
Why don't you let me
show you around?

982
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,480
See what we do here.

983
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:18,715

1054
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:35,639
All right, ladies,
you having a good time tonight?

1055
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,377
That's what I thought.

1056
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:43,547
But you know there's always
a queen up in here

1057
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:47,251
who must be reminded
of how beautiful she is.

1058
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:49,153
Don't be shy.
Where you at?

1059
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:51,955
Oop!
Boom.

1060
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,857
There you go.

1061
00:49:53,858 --> 00:49:55,993
Give me your hand.

1062
00:49:57,162 --> 00:50:00,064
Do you know how beautiful
you are?

1063
00:50:00,065 --> 00:50:01,798
Queens,
ain't she beautiful?

1064
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,536
You hear that?
But you know what?

1065
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:08,438
If you're not gonna take
our word for it,

1066
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:11,308
we're just gonna show you,
okay?

1067
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:18,382
So let me present to you
the absolutely adorable...

1068
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:19,649
Andre.

1069
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,054
What's your name?

1070
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,256
Caroline.

1071
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:28,692
Don't be shy.
That's a beautiful name.

1072
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,794
It was my grandmother's.

1073
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,196
What did she do?

1074
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:36,200
Um, she was the first female
black grocery owner

1075
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:37,201
in the state.

1076
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:38,568
Mm.
A strong woman.

1077
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:42,038
What brings you to Domina?
Other than the obvious.

1078
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,907
Celebrating my divorce.

1079
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:46,376
Your girlfriends brought you out
to have a good time, huh?

1080
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,011
Whoo! Yeah.
Good job. Okay.

1081
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:49,446
I'll take it from here.

1082
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:52,382
Uh, Caroline,
would you mind...

1083
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,784
Sitting for me
right here?

1084
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,386
That would be great.

1085
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,622
And, um,
one last thing...

1086
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:01,825
What's your favorite thing?

1087
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:02,959
Alcohol.

1088
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,228
Alcohol.

1089
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,296
Okay.
Alcohol.

1090
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:09,199
Um, I'm gonna need some
crowd participation on this one,

1091
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,734
so just, uh,
follow my lead.

1092
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,969
Yeah.

1093
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,004
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1094
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,506
Okay.

1095
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:19,344
Mm.

1096
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,580
Young Caroline,
give a Nigga happy time.

1097
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,915
She like alcohol, but you ain't
here to hear me whine.

1098
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,718
I'm looking at your backside.
I'm trying to stay patient.

1099
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,455
Make that thing clap.
That's a standing ovation.

1100
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:33,657
Grandma independent.
She don't need your help.

1101
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:36,860
But you don't really feel
that way about yourself.

1102
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:39,163
That's why the name feel funny
in your mouth.

1103
00:51:39,164 --> 00:51:40,830
You don't believe it,
but I can see it.

1104
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,866
And fuck that dude.
He don't get you.

1105
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:44,734
I know you're cool
and I just met you.

1106
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:46,002
Pick you up around 8:00.

1107
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,404
I can come and get you.

1108
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:49,105
On the coast,
and we ballin' back and forth

1109
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,408

and you ain't got a thing on.

00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:53,076

I don't know.

1127
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:05,583
Me and the guys were, uh...
We were near Savannah.

1128
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:08,953
And I couldn't
not see you.

1129
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:15,260
Okay.

1130
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:17,962
And?

1131
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:20,697
Don't laugh.

1132
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,933
Uh, we're going up to the
convention and... I don't know.

1133
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,838
We're gonna have one crazy night
to put this in bed and...

1134
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:33,278
I don't know.
I just thought it could be fun.

1135
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:36,580
The convention?

1136
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:39,683
So you mean to tell me you came
all the way here to see me

1137
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:41,618
about that bullshit
convention?

1138
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,687
No.
Look... look, I know.

1139
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:48,258
I just thought it...
Presented itself as an...

1140
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:50,460
As an interesting opportunity
for us to...

1141
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,128
No, no, no, no.
No.

1142
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:53,930
For you maybe.

1143
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:56,300
What the hell do I need
a convention for, Mike?

1144
00:53:56,301 --> 00:53:58,134
You don't.
That's not what I'm saying.

1145
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:00,804
Would you let me finish, please?
Will you just... no. Unh-Unh. No.

1146
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:02,506
I haven't talked to you
for eight years

1147
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:04,941
since you walked out on me.
Oh, did I walk out on you?

1148
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:07,877
Because if I remember correctly,
I went and took a job.

1149
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:10,514
And when I came back, someone
wouldn't let me in the house.

1150
00:54:10,515 --> 00:54:13,450
Mike, what makes you think
that you can come up in here

1151
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:15,585
after all this time
and snap your fingers

1152
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,555
and I'm supposed to do a favor
for you?

1153
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:19,990
Okay.

1154
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:26,095
Maybe... I'm... I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry.

1155
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,999
I-I'm not saying that
at all.

1156
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,335
Really?

1157
00:54:31,336 --> 00:54:34,438
I don't need a favor
from you.

1158
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:36,873
Fuck the convention.

1159
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:40,944
Don't...
All it is is an excuse

1160
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:44,881
for us to try to put
this shit between us to bed.

1161
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:47,785
That's all.

1162
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,970
Oh, shit.

1163
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:12,308
Thank you, Octavius.

1164
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,878
Ooh.
You're wonderful.

1165
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:17,146
My queens, gather.

1166
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,550
I need you.
I need you.

1167
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,653
You ever had a ghost
come to your front door?

1168
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:27,190
A ghost from your past,
one that still makes you shiver?

1169
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,461
I had one today.

1170
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:33,930
So I need your help.

1171
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:36,766
I need you
to help me make a decision

1172
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:40,036
of whether I should leave
that ghost in his grave

1173
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:43,172
or give him an opportunity
to be resurrected.

1174
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,108
Resurrected!

1175
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:47,010
Okay.

1176
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,513
I got a little treat for y'all
tonight.

1177
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:55,952
It's a man I knew...
As white chocolate.

1178
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:03,627
Some might know him
as Magic Mike.

1179
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:10,199
We're gonna see if he's still
got some magic in that Mike.

1180
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,609
Hello, beautiful.

1181
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,711
You down for a little fun
tonight?

1182
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,547
Yes.
All right.

1183
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:25,983
Have a seat.

1184
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,585
Mike?

1185
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:30,854
Come on.
Let's not do this.

1186
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:32,789

you are leaving again...

I have Andre over here
to take care of you.

1242
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,434
He'll take you
wherever you want to go.

1243
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:34,605
Yeah.
We got to get on the road.

1244
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,676
This was, uh,
this was fun...

1245
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:43,180
Whatever, I guess,
that this was.

1246
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:47,651
It was good seeing you.

1247
00:59:47,652 --> 00:59:48,885
Likewise.

1248
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:52,856
So... what was that?

1249
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:55,358
Y'all used to dance together?

1250
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,726
Uh, yeah.

1251
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,427
Look, it's a...

1252
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,165
It's a long, long story, but,
uh, Rome and I met each other

1253
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,400
at a very interesting time
in our lives,

1254
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:07,771
and... and, uh, I guess you
could say that we had a thing.

1255
01:00:07,772 --> 01:00:11,074
Mm. Yeah.
I'd say you had a thing.

1256
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:12,308
Yeah.

1257
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:16,412
Well, until I, uh,
I went to work with Dallas.

1258
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:18,014
Yeah.

1259
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:21,818
So... is she gonna come help us
or what?

1260
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:23,419
No.
No.

1261
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,955
I don't... I don't think
that's gonna actually happen.

1262
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,524
Rome likes to stay
in her castle.

1263
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:30,894
That's why she built it.

1264
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:34,330
So, uh, I getting on 95 north,
right?

1265
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:37,734
Yeah. Yeah.
It's just outside of Charleston.

1266
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:39,869
She texted me the address.
I don't know.

1267
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,771
I'll tell you
when we get closer.

1268
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:43,572
You need a co-pilot?
Yes, please.

1269
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,875
Okay.

1270
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,277
That was insane tonight,
man.

1271
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:50,914
Thanks. I'm serious, dude.
That was like...

1272
01:00:50,915 --> 01:00:52,749
It was a good night.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1273
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,250
Your stuff is revolutionary,
man.

1274
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:55,952
Sometimes the songs
are a little...

1275
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,987
No, man. It was perfect.
Are you kidding me?

1276
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,423
I appreciate that. And you
just made that up on the spot.

1277
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:03,259
I... well, Rome likes us
to put our passion in our work.

1278
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,260
Well, it shows, man.

1279
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:06,362
I've never seen anything
like that.

1280
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,232
Are you doing anything else
with your music?

1281
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:11,534
Man, I'm trying.
I put it up online.

1282
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:14,370
Hopefully, like, it'll spread
through social media,

1283
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:17,340
but honestly, with this E.P.
That's coming out, it's...

1284
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,607
Oh, cool, man.

1285
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,676
It's hard to get people
to pay attention to it.

1286
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,980
'Cause there's so much shit that comes
on the Internet every day. Oh. So much.

1287
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:25,681
I just want to stay
authentic.

1288
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,884
Yeah. Well,
at least you're trying, man.

1289
01:01:27,885 --> 01:01:29,385
At least you're trying.

1290
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:31,687
That's why I moved
down to Florida back in the day,

1291
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,056
actually,
was to do music stuff.

1292
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:34,824
Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

1293
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:36,625
I sang
in "Dream along with Mickey"

1294
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,327
at Disney world
from '03 to '05.

1295
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:39,562
What?

1296
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:40,964
Yeah, man.
For real.

1297
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:42,598
I mean, I started out
as the Donald duck understudy,

1298
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,802
but I... I was playing Mickey
by my second year.

1299
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:48,204
I got signed by an agent,

1300
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:51,007
booked a couple
regional commercial spots.

1301
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:53,810
And one day I heard an ad on
the radio looking for dancers.

1302
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:55,745
And you know how that shit goes,
so...

1303
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:58,447
When I started this,
I thought...

1304
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,416
Man, I thought I'd hate it.

1305
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:04,253
But now, if the... if, like,
the E.P. Blew up tomorrow,

1306
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,756
I'd probably still do this
on the side.

1307
01:02:06,757 --> 01:02:07,757
What?
I'm serious.

1308
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:09,058
You're shitting me.

1309
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,061
Do you see how many girls I meet
every day?

1310
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,830
Yes.
For free?

1311
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,631
For free!
I don't got to pay for...

1312
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:16,632
All I do is sing.

1313
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:18,167
And you think about that.

1314
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:21,370
Like, these girls have to deal
with men in their lives

1315
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,907
every day who...
They don't listen to them.

1316
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:25,474
They don't ask them
what they want.

1317
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:27,410
They don't even ask them
what they want.

1318
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,578
All we got to do is ask them
what they want.

1319
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,614
And when they tell you,
it's a beautiful thing, man.

1320
01:02:31,615 --> 01:02:35,684
It's like we're like...
We're like healers or something.

1321
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,787
Yes, man.

1322
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:39,088
Fuck, yes.
We are.

1323
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,824
That's right.
We're healers.

1324
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:42,491
We're healers, man.

1325
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:44,560
We can be.
Okay. Yeah. We can be.

1326
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,329
We can be.

1327
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,330
Okay.
I like that.

1328
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:13,056
Hey, thanks for the ride.
No problem, man.

1329
01:03:13,057 --> 01:03:14,924
Good talking to you, man.
Safe home.

1330
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:16,392
Look us up
when you get back.

1331
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:17,861
All right, man.
Thanks, man.

1332
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:19,528
You sure this is the place?

1333
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:22,265
Yeah. I'm positive.
She said it, and I got the text.

1334
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:25,501
Looks like somebody hooked up
with a trust fund baby! You know?

1335
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:27,937
I just hit her
with her favorite flavor, baby,

1336
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:29,572
and we're livin' large.

1337
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:31,876
Megan?

1338
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,878
Hello?

1339
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:37,113
Megan?

1340
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:39,282
There's some law of attraction
going on up in here.

1341
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:40,884
There's somebody in here.
Megan!

1342
01:03:40,885 --> 01:03:41,885
It's Tito!

1343
01:03:41,886 --> 01:03:43,552
Hey!

1344
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,489
Oh... shit.

1345
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,091
Who are you?

1346
01:03:48,092 --> 01:03:51,760
Just, uh,
friends of Megan.

1347
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:53,529
Ah.

1348
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,164
Is Megan here?

1349
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:58,434
My daughter and her friends
are outside.

1350
01:03:58,435 --> 01:03:59,602
Who are you?

1351
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,470
Oh, you're having a party.
We'll just go out...

1352
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:03,472
You said Megan was back this way
in the guesthouse?

1353
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:04,740
You hold on.

1354
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:07,710
Y'all can't just walk
in my house like strangers

1355
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:09,678
without having a hello drink.

1356
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,017
You come on now
and have a seat.

1357
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:16,886
What you want?
You want red? You want white?

1358
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:19,022
We got whiskey.
We got shine.

1359
01:04:19,023 --> 01:04:21,357
Y'all get something.

1360
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:24,928
How about we start with wine
and end with shine?

1361
01:04:24,929 --> 01:04:26,462
I like that rule.

1362
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:28,731
Honey, you come sit right here.
Come on.

1363
01:04:28,732 --> 01:04:31,034
Oh, shit!

1364
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:32,568
Thank you so much.

1365
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:33,669
It smells good.

1366
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,939
Well... cheers!

1367
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,174
Cheers. Cheers. Eye contact.

1368
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:40,709
Thank you for your hospitality,
Ma'am.

1369
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,111
Quit that proper shit.

1370
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:45,248
You sound just like my ex.

1371
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:47,750
What are your names?

1372
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:49,252
Uh, I'm Mike.
This is Tito...

1373
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:50,253
Tito.
...Ken...

1374
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:51,921
Ken.
...Richie,

1375
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,091
uh...

1376
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,127
Ernest.
...Ernest. Ernest.

1377
01:04:58,128 --> 01:04:59,528
Well, I'm Nancy.

1378
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:04,133
And this is Mae, Julia,
Diane, and Jessica.

1379
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:05,568
Hey.
Nice to meet you.

1380
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:07,603
Nice to meet y'all.
Thank you, ladies.

1381
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:09,973
Y'all don't look like
you're from around here.

1382
01:05:09,974 --> 01:05:12,875
We're from Miami.
Uh, just...

1383
01:05:12,876 --> 01:05:16,079
Florida.

1384
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,746
There's one in Ohio,
dude.

1385
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,583
Just passing through
on our way to myrtle beach.

1386
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:23,219
Oh! Myrtle beach!
Redneck Riviera.

1387
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,554
Y'all should try Kiawah instead.

1388
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:27,356
Oh, yeah, I heard
that's real nice, ma'am.

1389
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:29,392
"Oh, yeah, I heard
that's real nice, ma'am."

1390
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:31,995
Listen to him!

1391
01:05:31,996 --> 01:05:33,429
Is that
what I sound like?

1392
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,132
You're good!

1393
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:37,666
Don't think I don't know

1394
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,536
what you're doing here
with those girls.

1395
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:44,240
How do y'all know
my daughter?

1396
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:46,109
We just...
Uh, we just met her at a...

1397
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,477
At a... in Jacksonville at...
At a...

1398
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:49,413
It was a bar.

1399
01:05:49,414 --> 01:05:51,981
A bar.
Well, that's my daughter.

1400
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:53,983
Always making new friends!

1401
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:58,854
So what do y'all do?

1402
01:05:58,855 --> 01:06:01,090
We are...
I, uh... hey!

1403
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:02,125
How are you?

1404
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:03,126
Hey!
Hi!

1405
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:04,360
There you are.

1406
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,329
Hey.
What are y'all talking about?

1407
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,131
Oh, the boys
are just about to tell us

1408
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:10,133
what they do for a living.
Oh.

1409
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:11,600
Mm-hmm.

1410
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:14,370
We, uh...

1411
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:16,705
What do... uh, I have...

1412
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:17,940
I have my own furniture company.

1413
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:19,908
Yeah. He's great.
Um...

1414
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:23,246
Tito here is into yogurt.

1415
01:06:23,247 --> 01:06:26,282
Frozen yogurt.
Yeah. artisanal.

1416
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:32,388
Ken is a budding actor and, um,
and level-3 reiki healer.

1417
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:34,423
Uh, so if you need any work
done...

1418
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:37,960
Uh, Ernie is...
Is an artist.

1419
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:39,228
He's a painter.

1420
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:41,897
Mom,
they're male strippers.

1421
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:43,699
Now, that makes sense.

1422
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,269
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

1423
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:49,638
Because it's fucking awkward
to do somebody like that.

1424
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:52,641
Enough with that fucking language!

1425
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:54,543
Oh, God, I don't think
I've ever had

1426
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:56,612
a real live stripper
in my house before.

1427
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:57,946
You have now.

1428
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,915
Uh, well, actually,
the... the technical term is...

1429
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:01,950
Is male entertainer.
Oh, my!

1430
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:04,987
Mom, they're not here for that.
They're just friends.

1431
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:06,822
Of course not!

1432
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:10,459
Shit, Diana, go down
and grab us some more Vino.

1433
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,695
No, no, no.
Don't... don't you worry.

1434
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,531
I got this. I'll reload, Nancy.
Okay, baby.

1435
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,767
You just... you just get
anything that looks expensive.

1436
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,069
As much of the good stuff

1437
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,704
as your little arms can carry,
darling.

1438
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,806
You got it.

1439
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:25,941
I-I got arms.
I'll help.

1440
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:34,550
Are you native American,
Tito?

1441
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:38,987
Yes, on my mother's side.

1442
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,457
Really, I've got it.
Thanks, though.

1443
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,392
Oh, you do not have it.

1444
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,528
By what I just saw
up there,

1445
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:49,665
we are gonna need a fucking
pack mule to water that bunch.

1446
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:51,734
So... I don't know.

1447
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,869
Let's fucking do this.

1448
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,372
I thought you were supposed to
be in New York, by the way.

1449
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:58,707
Oh, wait.
Is that not where we are?

1450
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,310
Wow.

1451
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:04,180
Hmm?

1452
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:06,316
I changed my mind.

1453
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,518
So does that mean
you are gonna be on the pole

1454
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:11,120
or you're not gonna be
on the pole?

1455
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:12,555
Because, I mean,

1456
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:14,590
"Dolly Titz on the main stage,
coming up for you, boys.

1457
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,160
Get your dollar bills out
and let's brighten up her day"

1458
01:08:17,161 --> 01:08:19,462
sounds awesome to me.

1459
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:20,796
Ha ha.

1460
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:23,332
Nice callback, Clitoria.

1461
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:26,169
It's low-hanging fruit.
I can't help myself.

1462
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,870
What's the plan now,
then?

1463
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:29,938
Currently?
Yep.

1464
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,809
Find the perfect dynamite
for that powder keg upstairs

1465
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:37,112
and... watch it blow.

1466
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,014
Okay.

1467
01:08:39,015 --> 01:08:40,616
What are we looking for?

1468
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:45,821
Something old and expensive...
To fit in upstairs.

1469
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:47,491
Cool.

1470
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:50,693
They all look the same
to me.

1471
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:52,796
Racist.

1472
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:56,131
Hmm?

1473
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,735
1959 Château Lafite.

1474
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:00,604
That'll do.

1475
01:09:00,605 --> 01:09:01,970
You see, what I hear

1476
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:06,342
is that guy isn't taking care
of his own shit.

1477
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:08,811
How are you gonna expect
your lady to trim the hedges,

1478
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:12,748
if you're not willing to...
Prune the tree?

1479
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,720
See, I have a three-day
Max-Growth rule.

1480
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:20,589
- Really?
- Abso-fucking-lutely, ma'am.

1481
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,590
Wow.

1482
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:23,692
Pardon my language.
Oh, please.

1483
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:25,027
We got wine!

1484
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:27,530
A basket full of wine!

1485
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:29,131
We got a basket of wine.

1486
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:32,501
You are missing out
on some husband tales in here.

1487
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,902
Or ex-husband tales.

1488
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,038
Julia and I are trying to lure
Mae and Diana

1489
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,140
over to the dark side.

1490
01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:40,409
Use the force, Nance.

1491
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,478
Come on, Mae.

1492
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,213
It's your turn.

1493
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:46,415
Come on, Mae.

1494
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:48,050
Come on, Mae.

1495
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:51,987
We know it ain't all peaches
and roses in that bedroom.

1496
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:54,022
Cone of silence here.

1497
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:57,059
Fine.
I'll go, then.

1498
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,728
Ugh.
Here's a whopper for you.

1499
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:00,896
Here we go.

1500
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:03,899
Roger's the only man
I've ever slept with.

1501
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,101
Then you are gonna get
more wine.

1502
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,872
Yeah.

1503
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:14,577
I lost my virginity to him when
I was 17, and that was that.

1504
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:16,612
Two beautiful daughters,

1505
01:10:16,613 --> 01:10:20,583
but only one penis
my entire fucking life.

1506
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:26,021
Sadly, I was too naive to
recognize that he was a gay man.

1507
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:27,990
Mom,
you don't know that.

1508
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:29,358
Oh, I knew enough.

1509
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:30,826
I knew he really liked it
when I put my fing...

1510
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:32,528
Mom! No. I don't want to hear that.
Hey!

1511
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,630
Well, you need to hear this!
It's not so terrible.

1512
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:37,933
Because I pissed away
all of this on one man.

1513
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:40,736
And you are not gonna make
the same mistake.

1514
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,004
Got it.

1515
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:46,642
That's why I tell these girls
to play the field.

1516
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:49,945
And don't stop
until you find one

1517
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:53,549
that rocks
your fucking socks off!

1518
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,250
My Motto.
Hear, hear.

1519
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,887
Well, you know, Nancy,
that plays both ways.

1520
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:02,925
I think I've had
as good a run as anybody.

1521
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:04,693
But I'd trade all that
in a heartbeat

1522
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:08,864
to come home to a wife, a kid,
people that love me.

1523
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:13,135
That hole is never
gonna be filled.

1524
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:15,605
That ship fucking sailed.

1525
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:20,843
Wow.

1526
01:11:20,844 --> 01:11:23,379
I think my soul just died
a little bit.

1527
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,681
I love you, Ernie.

1528
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:29,051
Well, Hank and I have never had
sex with the lights on.

1529
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:30,653
What?

1530
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:33,556
Every time it starts,
he just goes and turns 'em off.

1531
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:37,360
And I try to drop hints,
but, um...

1532
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:39,562
Maybe it's me.
I don't know.

1533
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:42,030
Come on. Never once?

1534
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,899
Never.

1535
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,369
He's not showing you
how beautiful you are.

1536
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:48,270
No. You're gorgeous...
You know that, right?

1537
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:49,538
She's gorgeous, right?

1538
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:51,440
And I'm not just talking
about the paint job.

1539
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:53,308
I'm not talking about
this vessel.

1540
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,243
I'm talking about
what's inside you.

1541
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:56,812
I read energy in my work,

1542
01:11:56,813 --> 01:12:03,986
and... and yours is pure and
sweet and loving and nurturing.

1543
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:04,921
You got to talk to him.

1544
01:12:04,922 --> 01:12:06,489
'Cause if he's not gonna
worship you,

1545
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:07,690
there's a lot of guys out there
who will.

1546
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:09,458
And the line starts
right here.

1547
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:10,993
Winds around this room, too.
Yep. Absolutely.

1548
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,160
You know that, right?

1549
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,097
Good. Don't... no, no.
Don't get shy on me.

1550
01:12:15,098 --> 01:12:17,199
You need to say it.
I want to hear you say it.

1551
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,502
Own it.

1552
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:22,104
Well, I just don't know
what to say to him.

1553
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:23,972
Well, tell him
what your fantasy is.

1554
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:26,108
And make sure he does it
with the lights on.

1555
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:29,978
If he doesn't, then y'all have
a serious problem.

1556
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:32,180
Well, I, um...

1557
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,083
When we were in college
and we were falling in love,

1558
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,987
we used to listen to that song,
um, "heaven."

1559
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:41,323
Oh, shit.
Yes!

1560
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:43,125

Yeah, baby.
Whoo!

That's wonderful!

1579
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:44,520
I don't think Hank
can do that.

1580
01:13:46,289 --> 01:13:47,956
Doctor's in the house,
baby.

1581
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:50,959
The doctor has checked
into the building.

1582
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,360
Oh, thank you.

1583
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,663
Yeah!
Fuck, Ken!

1584
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:56,465
What the fuck?

1585
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:58,567
Y'all know
that was my audition song.

1586
01:13:58,568 --> 01:14:00,469
What?
Yeah, it was one of them.

1587
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:04,673
It's awesome.

1588
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:09,344
Oh, God,
I just love this fucking night!

1589
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,947
I love it!

1590
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:16,118
I wish we had known you guys
back in our day, you know?

1591
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,522
Well, I'd say
it's still your day, ma'am.

1592
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,627
Thank you, Richie.

1593
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:28,063
Stand up.

1594
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:30,933
- Oh, no.
- Come on, stand up.

1595
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:32,000
Hey!

1596
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:37,740
Oh, my God.
Just look at you.

1597
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:39,942
You are just perfect.

1598
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,176
Damn!

1599
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,747
Oh, God.

1600
01:14:44,748 --> 01:14:46,281
- Oh, damn, look at you.
- Here it comes.

1601
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:49,251
I hate to be rude, but...

1602
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:50,519
You want to pop the hood.

1603
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:57,492
Oh, shit.

1604
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,327
Oh, my God!

1605
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,697
- Mom!
- Oh, please!

1606
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:04,166
Of course you're...
You're eating cake by yourself

1607
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,735
when, uh, the fireworks
are about to go off in there.

1608
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:08,470
This isn't concerning at all.

1609
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:10,438
What can I say?

1610
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,307
I like cake.

1611
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:15,978
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

1612
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:17,946
A lady is about to get...

1613
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:20,282
I don't even know
how to put it into words.

1614
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:22,184
No.
I'm a cookie guy.

1615
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,652
What?

1616
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:26,254
Yeah.
It's red fucking velvet.

1617
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,824
I would take a pack of oreos
over that bullshit

1618
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:30,726
any day of the week.
What's wrong with you?

1619
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:32,227
Nothing's wrong.
'Cause cookies are awesome.

1620
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:34,129
Well, I don't think
we have anything more

1621
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,463
to say to one another.

1622
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,766
Look, if you don't want to talk
about it or whatever...

1623
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,067
I don't know
if it's about New York...

1624
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:40,969
But I maybe intuit
that it might be...

1625
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:43,972
I'm gonna start hiding
the kitchen knives in a minute.

1626
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:46,241
Seriously,
it is that obvious.

1627
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:48,544
What's up?

1628
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:54,750
I met a photographer in Miami
at this party I was working at.

1629
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,552
He was nice and married
and all of that.

1630
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,854
Mm.

1631
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:03,358
Took a look at my photos
and said I had an eye.

1632
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,662
Offered me a job right there
on the spot as his assistant.

1633
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:08,063
That's cool.

1634
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,532
I mean, did he offer a place
for you to stay as well

1635
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:13,435
that happened to be his house
when his wife was away?

1636
01:16:13,436 --> 01:16:14,569
That...

1637
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,271
Yeah.

1638
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:17,673
Wait.
Were you there?

1639
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:20,142
I was there, but I was in drag.
You wouldn't have recognized me.

1640
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:24,046
Mm. But I just want to throw
this out there, though.

1641
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:25,480
Um, this might be God's way

1642
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:28,350
of giving you a second chance
at Myrtle Beach.

1643
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:29,952
Mm.

1644
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:31,720
Any God worth believing in

1645
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:35,158
certainly sends you dudes
in thongs when in need.

1646
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:39,628
Or she just knows
that some asshole in Miami...

1647
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:40,729
She?

1648
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,197
Yes, my God is a she.

1649
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:47,302
Um, she just might know that...
I don't know...

1650
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:50,840
Some asshole in Miami stole your
smile and you need it back.

1651
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:54,042
And I can guarantee you

1652
01:16:54,043 --> 01:16:57,913
that strippers will give
smiles aplenty

1653
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,748
and make you forget
about New York.

1654
01:16:59,749 --> 01:17:03,752
And if that doesn't work, then
there will be 3,000 women there,

1655
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:07,389
seeing as you're not
in a boy phase.

1656
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,692
That's quite a pitch.
Mm.

1657
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:11,293
Look, when shit's not going
your way,

1658
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:13,896
getting a little crazy
with some random friends

1659
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:17,299
has a way of helping you
sort out your own shit.

1660
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,334
So I'm your friend now?

1661
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:20,803
You've seen me pee.

1662
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:23,707
I don't know anyone that's not
my friend that's seen me pee.

1663
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:27,275
Fair enough.

1664
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:32,247
Look, I don't normally trust
a cookie guy...

1665
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:34,717
But I'll...
I'll think about it.

1666
01:17:34,718 --> 01:17:36,719
That's valid.

1667
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,987
All right.
You think about it, Dolly.

1668
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:41,156
I'm gonna go back in there
and feed the Wolves,

1669
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,191
'cause it's getting
a little rabid in there.

1670
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:44,793
All right?

1671
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:46,729
It's Zoe, by the way.

1672
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,963
Zoe.
Mm-hmm.

1673
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:49,397
Nice to meet you.

1674
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:50,665
Magic.

1675
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,769
Magic Mike.

1676
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,199
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

1677
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:28,470
Morning, gentlemen.

1678
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:30,072
Morning.
Hey, buddy.

1679
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:31,539
Everyone sleep all right?

1680
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,607
Yeah.
Yeah.

1681
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:35,277
You boys have fun.

1682
01:18:35,278 --> 01:18:38,281
Mm.

1683
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:43,152
Mm.

1684
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,790
Mm.

1685
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:49,992
Did you bangee?

1686
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:51,794
Did you bangee?

1687
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:52,828
Yes.

1688
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:54,162
You banged her?

1689
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:56,432
Was she the glass slipper?

1690
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,834
Yes, man!

1691
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:02,938
That wonderful, nice lady
was the glass slipper?

1692
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:04,840
Hold it.
Every inch?

1693
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:06,509
Wow.

1694
01:19:07,811 --> 01:19:09,344
Y'all had a crazy connection,
man.

1695
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:12,181
I could feel it.
I'm so happy for you.

1696
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:15,183
What?

1697
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:17,052
You got to be kidding me.
Yeah. What?!

1698
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:18,620
You got to be fucking joking.

1699
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:19,988
Oh, shit!

1700
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:22,324
This is us?
It was the Ex-husband's.

1701
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:24,759
Said she didn't care what shape
I brought it back in,

1702
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,228
as long as I brought it back.

1703
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:29,764
Didn't realize she'd
been married to Shawn Kemp.

1704
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,099
Pimpin'!
Sweet!

1705
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,468
That is a beautiful piece
of machinery, man.

1706
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:34,903
Holy shit.

1707
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:37,072
We're gonna kill on the strip in myrtle.
This is nice.

1708
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:38,573

Uh, Ms. Davidson called ahead,
upgraded your rooms,

1721
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,282
and booked you
our conference space.

1722
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:56,784

Davidson? Yeah.

No!
Get outta here!

Come on, man.

1727
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:13,501
So you think it's okay to have
me wait for you for two hours?

1728
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:15,837
No, it's not okay,
but someone should've told me.

1729
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:17,072
Yo, man.

1730
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:19,074

Later, guys.

1779
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:53,695
Where is your yogurt now, man?
I'm starving.

1780
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:54,729
Yeah.

1781
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:58,100
You really think...

1782
01:23:58,101 --> 01:23:59,967

Yeah.

1786
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:05,607
Yeah.
Absolutely.

1787
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:07,109
Man, I hope so.

1788
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:08,543
I hope I can keep it afloat,
man.

1789
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,379

1790
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:14,416
Other than being onstage.

1791
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:16,184
But that's why.
That's why it's gonna work, man.

1792
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:17,952
You love it too much.

1793
01:24:17,953 --> 01:24:21,456
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's not gonna be easy.

1794
01:24:21,457 --> 01:24:23,825
If you want, man, look,
I'll...

1795
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:27,129
On the way back down, I'll...
I'll go over everything you got.

1796
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,430
We'll... we'll go through it.

1797
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:29,831
Yeah?
Yeah.

1798
01:24:29,832 --> 01:24:31,666
That'd be cool, man.

1799
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:37,439
You know,
I get why you left.

1800
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,243
I'm just glad you're back.

1801
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:05,267
All right, hypnotize.

1802
01:25:05,268 --> 01:25:06,734
Make sure you see sound
and lighting.

1803
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:07,835
They'll hook you up.

1804
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,938
Go on, make some money.
Give him a locker key.

1805
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,007
Next!

1806
01:25:13,008 --> 01:25:15,610
Paris.

1807
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:19,614
Holy fucking shit.

1808
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:22,116
What are y'all doing here? Hi.

1809
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,118
Give your mama some sugar!

1810
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,087
How are you?
How are you?

1811
01:25:26,088 --> 01:25:29,023
They always come back.
Mm-hmm.

1812
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:30,225
I am great.

1813
01:25:30,226 --> 01:25:31,593
I'm a little confused,
'cause Dallas,

1814
01:25:31,594 --> 01:25:33,361
he didn't let me know
y'all were coming.

1815
01:25:33,362 --> 01:25:35,096
Where is he?
Dallas is not coming.

1816
01:25:35,097 --> 01:25:36,398
It's just us.

1817
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:39,033
Baby, I don't have a spot
for you.

1818
01:25:39,034 --> 01:25:40,502
You got a spot for us.
Come on.

1819
01:25:40,503 --> 01:25:44,572
Honey, you know how this works.
You're not special.

1820
01:25:44,573 --> 01:25:46,608
Especially you.
You... you've been out!

1821
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:48,676
How long?

1822
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:50,378
"D... D... D... D..."
don't worry about it.

1823
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:51,846
Couple years. Come on.
You can find us a spot.

1824
01:25:51,847 --> 01:25:53,681
You've not been dancing.
Come on. Look at you.

1825
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:55,183
Let me see.
Come on. You know I...

1826
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:56,751
Are you even in shape?
It's like riding a bike.

1827
01:25:56,752 --> 01:25:58,620
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

1828
01:25:58,621 --> 01:25:59,887
I don't know.

1829
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:02,757
Who's this? Big dumb Rick?
How you doing?

1830
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:04,492
It's dick.
Okay.

1831
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,728
So, you don't have an M.C.
We do have an M.C.

1832
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:09,797
You don't have an M.C.
What am I supposed to do?

1833
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:12,267
We do have an M.C.

1834
01:26:12,268 --> 01:26:13,901
Hey, gorgeous.

1835
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:15,870
Shut the fuck up.

1836
01:26:15,871 --> 01:26:17,739
Mm-hmm.

1837
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,741
Hey.

1838
01:26:19,742 --> 01:26:21,544
How you been?

1839
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:24,712
How have you been?

1840
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:25,514
Good.

1841
01:26:25,515 --> 01:26:28,484
So, you got a spot for us?

1842
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,787
This girl taught me everything
I know.

1843
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:39,160
Who is at 10:20?
Bumper Grinders?

1844
01:26:42,665 --> 01:26:44,299
All right.

1845
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,568
For her.

1846
01:26:46,569 --> 01:26:47,935
10:20.

1847
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,471
That's why I love you.

1848
01:26:49,472 --> 01:26:50,872
That's a money spot.

1849
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:52,974
I expect y'all to make
some money in that spot.

1850
01:26:52,975 --> 01:26:54,075
Thank you.

1851
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:30,378
How are the knees?

1852
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:31,413
Rotten.

1853
01:27:31,414 --> 01:27:34,248
Yeah?
You good?

1854
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,717
Tell you the truth, man,

1855
01:27:35,718 --> 01:27:39,754
I haven't felt this nervous
since desert storm.

1856
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:40,689
What?

1857
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:42,690
H-how have I known you
this long

1858
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:45,460
and I don't know that you were
in desert storm?

1859
01:27:45,461 --> 01:27:47,763
Just never came up.

1860
01:27:49,632 --> 01:27:51,198
Look, I don't know.

1861
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:56,771
Me and you, we haven't really
had a chance to have our moment.

1862
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:57,939
Are we good?

1863
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,909
You know, Mike,
when I called you,

1864
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:04,011
I didn't call
to fuck with you.

1865
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:06,449
I called
'cause I missed you, man.

1866
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:13,120
Read my fangs.
Let her make her own decisions.

1867
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,389
Psst!
Whatever.

1868
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,425
Chill, guys.

1869
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:18,593
I fucked Bella!

1870
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:34,208
Who's killing it out there?

1871
01:28:34,209 --> 01:28:37,044
Fucking vampire bullshit.

1872
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:38,446
Did you guys see this?

1873
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:40,114
They're doing
a fucking "Twilight" routine

1874
01:28:40,115 --> 01:28:41,349
and they're mopping up.

1875
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:43,385
All those tweeners
are growing up, man.

1876
01:28:43,386 --> 01:28:45,353
Makes perfect sense.

1877
01:28:45,354 --> 01:28:48,322
Mm. That's true.
Yep.

1878
01:28:52,127 --> 01:28:53,495
Wow.
Okay.

1879
01:28:53,496 --> 01:28:55,597
Dude, I-I just don't want to
fuck this up, man.

1880
01:28:55,598 --> 01:28:57,732
What are you t...
You're not gonna fuck this up.

1881
01:28:57,733 --> 01:28:59,367
And look,
and on the off chance

1882
01:28:59,368 --> 01:29:01,769
that we actually go out there
and shit the bed, who cares?

1883
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:03,204
Don't say that.
Why? Fuck it.

1884
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:04,506
Look, I love you guys.

1885
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:06,140
This trip has been ridiculous
and amazing.

1886
01:29:06,141 --> 01:29:09,143
So please do not make me give
the whole

1887
01:29:09,144 --> 01:29:11,012
"it's not about
how we go out there and do it,

1888
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:13,848
it's about getting to go out
there and do it together" speech

1889
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,917
that I just fucking gave you.

1890
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:17,652
W... okay.

1891
01:29:17,653 --> 01:29:19,253
Richie, what are you?

1892
01:29:19,254 --> 01:29:20,855
You're not a fireman.

1893
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:22,457
What are you?

1894
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:24,526
I'm a m-male entertainer.

1895
01:29:24,527 --> 01:29:25,560
Entertainer.

1896
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:26,994
Ooh, yeah.
What are we?

1897
01:29:26,995 --> 01:29:28,396
Fuck it, man.
Male entertainers.

1898
01:29:28,397 --> 01:29:29,531
That's right. Come on.
Get it in.

1899
01:29:29,532 --> 01:29:30,665
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hold that up.
Hold that up.

1901
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,468
Look, it's not bro time,
it's showtime.

1902
01:29:33,469 --> 01:29:34,702
Are you guys ready? Yeah.
We're ready.

1903
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,739
All right. Come on.
Let's do this.

1904
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:40,575
All right. Ready?
One, two, three.

1905
01:29:40,576 --> 01:29:42,043
Male entertainers!

1906
01:29:43,345 --> 01:29:45,713
We're strippers.
We're strippers.

1907
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:50,452
Whoo! Yes!
Giving it up!

1908
01:29:50,453 --> 01:29:54,556
Oh, Men of Steel
in the "Twilight" routine!

1909
01:29:57,059 --> 01:29:58,493
Oh, that was hot!

1910
01:29:58,494 --> 01:30:00,995
Can I hear y'all say "Hot"?

1911
01:30:00,996 --> 01:30:02,597
Hot!
Whoo!

1912
01:30:02,598 --> 01:30:05,733
That's a nice Southern welcome.

1913
01:30:09,371 --> 01:30:11,439
All right.

1914
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,975
Now, I know this is not
a competition,

1915
01:30:13,976 --> 01:30:16,611
but y'all are gonna go home
with your favorites tonight.

1916
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:22,383
One of my all-time favorites

1917
01:30:22,384 --> 01:30:27,388
is making an appearance on this
stage after a little while away.

1918
01:30:27,389 --> 01:30:29,290
Magical little dancer.

1919
01:30:31,293 --> 01:30:32,694
Mm-hmm.

1920
01:30:32,695 --> 01:30:36,031
He's been gone a little while,
but he's back.

1921
01:30:37,566 --> 01:30:40,602
He has hooked up
with the devil himself...

1922
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:47,008
...and he is back tonight
with those friends

1923
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:49,677
to entertain
your beautiful selves.

1924
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:53,681
Here they are...
Reserrection!

1925
01:30:58,887 --> 01:31:00,855
Good evening, friends.

1926
01:31:00,856 --> 01:31:03,324
This is what
you're all here for.

1927
01:31:06,328 --> 01:31:09,263
Lift-off in five, four,

1928
01:31:09,264 --> 01:31:12,066
three, two, one.

1929
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:13,367
Ignition.

1930
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:19,541
Hold this.

1931
01:31:28,383 --> 01:31:33,221
Just wait till you see
what we got coming up.

1932
01:31:51,807 --> 01:31:54,108
Did you like that, ladies?

1933
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:58,714
Was it good to you?

1934
01:32:00,082 --> 01:32:05,086
Well, just so you know,
my name is Rome.

1935
01:32:07,422 --> 01:32:09,724
I'm gonna be your M.C. Tonight.

1936
01:32:09,725 --> 01:32:14,228
Now, ladies, do you mind
if I refer to you all as queens?

1937
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:18,800
'Cause every last one of you
up in here is a queen,

1938
01:32:18,801 --> 01:32:21,368
and don't you ever forget it!

1939
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:29,877
Now, with that being said,
are you ready to be worshipped?

1940
01:32:31,947 --> 01:32:35,216
Are you ready to be exalted?

1941
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,789
Are you ready to meet
a special kind of beast

1942
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:44,692
that can bring
all the beauty out in you?

1943
01:32:48,597 --> 01:32:53,534
Well, without further ado, we
have our first king tonight...

1944
01:32:53,535 --> 01:32:54,769
Tarzan.

1945
01:34:04,707 --> 01:34:07,074
I don't know about you, queens,

1946
01:34:07,075 --> 01:34:11,078
but I'd let that beast throw
whatever he wanted on me

1947
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:12,413
any day.

1948
01:34:15,818 --> 01:34:20,287
You know how the alchemy of
opposites can be so satisfying?

1949
01:34:22,524 --> 01:34:25,860
You have a little bit of cold
with a little bit of hot.

1950
01:34:27,562 --> 01:34:31,398
You have a little bit of yes
with a little bit of no.

1951
01:34:34,469 --> 01:34:38,539
And you know how we like our
kings to be really, really sweet

1952
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:42,243
and really, really hard
all at the same time.

1953
01:34:44,379 --> 01:34:45,479
Yes, lord.

1954
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:51,352

our candy king... Tito!

01:34:51,353 --> 01:34:54,521

01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:24,985
with the pipes.

2050
01:40:24,986 --> 01:40:28,855
Y'all ladies hear
those high notes?

2051
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:30,657
But now to a more serious
subject.

2052
01:40:30,658 --> 01:40:34,495
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here

2053
01:40:34,496 --> 01:40:36,897
in the presence of every male
entertainer in the Hemisphere.

2054
01:40:36,898 --> 01:40:40,067
Y'all do this every year,
and every year you do it well.

2055
01:40:40,068 --> 01:40:41,902
You do it well,

2056
01:40:41,903 --> 01:40:44,305
that hide-and-seek,
that don't-go-tell...

2057
01:40:44,306 --> 01:40:46,740
It's okay.
You can touch.

2058
01:40:46,741 --> 01:40:49,610
...that every woman in this room
deserves.

2059
01:40:49,611 --> 01:40:54,681
And simply because there are
so many of you and so few of us,

2060
01:40:54,682 --> 01:40:57,384
there is something
we simply can't give.

2061
01:40:57,385 --> 01:41:00,787
But... we're gonna try to
tonight.

2062
01:41:03,558 --> 01:41:08,729

just a little... commitment.

I'm keeping it real with you,
