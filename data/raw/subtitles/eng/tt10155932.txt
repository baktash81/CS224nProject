00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,396
To think that any girl,
let alone you,

354
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,606
would have the audacity
to engage

355
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,983
in matters of business,
it's insane.

356
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,778
I will not have you
embarrassing this household

357
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,655
with your blasphemy.

358
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,898
Don't ever let me catch you
trying such nonsense again.

359
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,411
Put the dress down.

360
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,454
Yes, Stepmother.

361
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,585
Good.

362
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,213
Now... shoulders back.

363
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,715
- (grunts)
- No slouching.

364
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,634
And smile.

365
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,387
Every girl is worth more
when she smiles.

366
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,115
(sighs)

367
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,576
(door closes)

368
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,251
What are you doing?

369
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:27,672
I am stewing in my own anger.

370
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,673
(softly):
Oh, okay.

371
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,508
You turned down the daughter

372
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,926
of Lord Reginald.

373
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,219
I guess she wasn't the one.

374
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,637
She was!

375
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,348
I would've had control
of all the territories

376
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,517
right up to the domain
of the sea monster.

377
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,761
Well, perhaps you should marry
the sea monster, Robert.

378
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,456
I would have to have
grandmother's ring resized.

379
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
(laughs)

380
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,357
You keep overlooking
his behavior,

381
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,359
- and he'll never grow out of it.
- Stop.

382
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,944
He's gonna make a fine king.

383
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,281
Is it me,

384
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:57,202
or is your throne
just a little bit taller

385
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,679
- than it was yesterday?
- (sputtering sigh)

386
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,955
- I mean, it really looks...
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

387
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,224
- Quite a bit.
- And even if it is,

388
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,459
I have every right
to make it taller.

389
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,585
I'm king.

390
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,046
Mm. Yes.

391
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,757
And I am ridiculous.

392
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,052
If you need me,
I shall be in my chambers.

393
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,887
Brushing my hair.

394
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,764
Until it all falls out.

395
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,183
So we good?
'Cause I got a thing.

396
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,352
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

397
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,104
You're bringing shame
on this family, Robert.

398
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,190
Have you seen this?

399
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,734
ROBERT: "The Roundabout Players
present The King's Idiot Son."

400
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,629
(chuckles): Ooh, do you think
we can still get tickets?

401
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,029
I'm becoming a laughingstock.

402
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,614
I think you're overreacting.

403
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,342
Well, why don't you ask
the Roundabout Players

404
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,534
if I'm overreacting?

405
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,160
They are currently

406
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,788
in a dark windowless room
under the castle.

407
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,917
You can't leave actors alone
in a basement without attention.

408
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,001
They'll die!

409
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,545
When you marry,
you'll settle down.

410
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,630
You'll stop behaving
like my idiot son,

411
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,298
and the perception
of the people will be

412
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,175
that you take the crown
seriously.

413
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,528
- You can't control me.
- (choir singing in distance)

414
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:56,886
Oh, that's exactly
what I can do.

415
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,346
That's the perk
of being the king.

416
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,782
But I feel nothing
for these women.

417
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,950
It's crazy to think
I'm actually gonna

418
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,034
fall in love with one of them.

419
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,226
Kings marry for power,

420
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,662
- not for love.
- (choir continues singing)

421
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,288
Oh, well, it's perfect then
that Mother came with

422
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,231
three castles
and a hundred horses,

423
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,458
or I suppose
I never would've been born!

424
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,109
- Silence!
- (choir gasps)

425
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,745
Don't talk about
what you don't understand. Hmm?

426
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:27,000
Continue to defy me,
and just out of spite,

427
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:31,087
I'll give it all... the crown,

428
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,006
the palace,

429
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,092
everything... to your sister.

430
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,136
CHOIR:
♪ Bum-bum-bum ♪

431
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,013
Leave us, Gwen.

432
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,352
Sorry.

433
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,022
I would be embarrassed

434
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,400
if I wasn't so bored
with my life.

435
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,278
But since I'm here,
I would love to stay

436
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,113
and help sort out
this whole crown issue.

437
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,656
You've been excused, Gwen.

438
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,909
Right.

439
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,786
But would this be a good time
for me to mention

440
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,205
how the kingdom could use
the power of the wind

441
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,874
- instead of burning filthy coal?
- Go!

442
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:14,255
Father, you know how badly
I want to be king.

443
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,798
I do. (chuckles softly)

444
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,051
Now, to make sure your nuptials

445
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,179
are done properly and on my
schedule, we shall hold a ball.

448

Yes. We'll invite
every woman of worth.

You'll dance.
You'll be charming.

450

You shall find a bride.

451
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,023
- Hmm?
- No, no, no.

452
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,442
D-Dancing at these things
is so... mannered.

453
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,443
And formal.

454
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,736
We look like fools!

455
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,029
Of course we do.

456
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,447
But women love it.

457
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,116
Good God, Robert,
if a rich man ever lost a woman,

458
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,910
it was to a man who could dance.

459
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,955
Why do I have to explain
everything to you?

460
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,081
This is insane!

461
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,916
I can't just pick
some bride at a ball.

462
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,334
And then what?

463
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,795
(laughs): We're-we're supposed
to grow old together?

464
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,338
Into our 40s?

465
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,174
I mean, what are we even
gonna talk about?

466
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,968
You will go to the ball.

467
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,720
You will find someone.

468
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,055
That's an order.

469
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,475
Now, go dress.

470
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,812
I expect you to look sharp for
the changing of the guard. Hmm?

471
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,358

It's a beautiful dress.

Right?
I should be allowed to sell it.

752
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,242
Sure, but women can't own shops.

Surely we can run a business.

758
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,919
Can't be that hard.

759
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,005
I mean,
wouldn't it just be great

762

I could hang my garments
on that side.

763
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:16,388
And I'd say things like,
"Thank you. Come again."

764
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,390
Or, "Hot enough
out there for ya?"

What?

766
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,268

Okay. What am I doing?
I'm going home.

- I'll take it.

771
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,609
The dress. I'll buy it.

772
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,652
Is this pity?

773
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,547
Are you doing this
'cause you feel sorry for me?

774
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,090
- Because that's really nice, but...
- No.

775
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,701
I'm just trying to do my part
to correct a flawed system.

776
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:40,412
What's your price?
I mean, the brooch alone...

777
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,289
Oh, the brooch.

778
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:43,415
That was my mother's.

I never knew her,
but I want to believe

780
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:49,880
she'd rather me have my dreams

- Not true at all, though.
- Ah, maybe.

823
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,765
Sounds like a vicious lie to me.

824
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,934
So does this mean
you're not coming to the ball?

825
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,185
No way.

826
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,122

is weird and antiquated.

827
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,272
Not my thing.

828
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,857
Nice to meet you.

829
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,819

a very old-fashioned kingdom,

830
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:38,238
but the ball, I mean,

831
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:40,991

open-minded people

833
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,871
Now, I know them.

834

I can introduce you
if you'd like.

835
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,167
Why would you do that?

836
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,668
I mean, you just met me.

837
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,380
Let's just say
I know what it feels like

838
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,634
to not quite fit into the crate
you were born into.

839
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,011
And I... I believe in you.

840
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,141
Then, yes.

841
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,225
I'll go.

842
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,102

843
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,646

(stammers)

845
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:15,359
I heard a proper person say that
one time when he was excited.

846
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,528
Ah, look who's been around
a proper person.

847
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:19,947
Just once.

848
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,966
I once shared an apple
with a goat named King Rowan.

849
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,676
Well, I'm sure the prince
will definitely pick you.

850
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,619
I doubt it. I'm dirty.

851
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,621
I smell like a basement.

852
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,349
My best friends are mice.
It's a whole thing.

853
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,291
I-I will just find you
at the ball.

854
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:34,461
Thank you for this.

855
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,630
You're welcome.

856
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,800
Hope the dress fits!

857
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,803

as soon as I get home.

you are spoken for.

- Hush now.

do not go to balls.

And why would you assume that?

1147
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,957
Because everyone knows mice
are girls and rats are boys.

Well, how do you think

We know.

May I ask you a question?

00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,086
- Yes, Your Highness.

1359
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,422

Good evening, ladies.

1374
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,803
First, I would like to thank
each and every one of you

1375
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:22,827
for being here.

1376
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,497
You are all so beautiful

1377
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:27,499
and have so much to offer.

1378
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:29,877
But if I'm being honest,

1379
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,463
there is only one
who has captured my attention.

1380
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,232
- (Narissa grunts softly)
- Sadly, I have not

1381
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:35,466
cast my eyes on her tonight.

1382
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:38,093
- (laughing loudly)
- (guests groaning, murmur)

1383
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:43,283
- (sighs) Sorry. Words. Um...
- (Robert talking in distance)

1384
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:44,683
I designed it.

1385
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:47,227
Then I am honored
to be in the presence

1386
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:48,896
of such an artist.

1387
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,648
Would it be possible
to see more of your work?

1388
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,401
- More than possible.
- Good.

1389
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,904
I attend lavish events
around the world,

1390
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,655
and I hate all my clothes.

1391
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:02,242
I'm looking for someone
to travel with me

1392
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,661
to enliven my wardrobe.

1393
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:06,246
Maybe that person is you.

1394
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:08,624

1567
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,396
that you're not of royal birth.

1568
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,546
No, that's not it.

1569
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,131
W-We'll get married.

1570
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,591
Okay? We'll-we'll get married

1571
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,611
and you will live the rest
of your life as royalty.

1572
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,929
Royalty? What about my work?

1573
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,096
M-My dresses can...

1574
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,599
Well, that would
most likely be frowned upon.

1575
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,643
Women have
a very prescribed role in court.

1576
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,704
- "Prescribed role in court"?
- But I would make sure

1577
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,414
that you were dressed by
the finest dressmakers

1578
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,148
- in all the land.
- I'm a dressmaker.

1579
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,150
I know. There's just
no one else in this world

1580
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,443
I'd rather be with than you.

1581
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:39,861
Robert, stop.

1582
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,406
I don't want a life stuck
waving from a royal box

1583
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,867
any more than a life
confined to a basement.

1584
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:49,371
I have dreams
that I have to chase.

1585
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:53,333
So if it's a choice...

1586
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,088
...I choose me.

1587
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,513

About the magic.
What was said about the magic?

I don't know.
I was singing.

Mm, mm, mm, mm.

1670
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:53,675
All the townspeople's
tax dollars

1671
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:56,094
wasted on a ball, and for what?

1672
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:59,055
For you to make
a complete fool out of me?

1673
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,807
To teach me a lesson?

1674
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,225
I'm sorry, Father.

1675
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,936
You are single-handedly
destroying my legacy.

1676
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:08,022
I know you might not
understand this,

1677
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:10,316
but the woman I chose
didn't choose me.

1678
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,277
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

1679
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,780
Aw.

1680
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,448
Have you lost your mind?!

1681
01:16:17,532 --> 01:16:19,826
You are the future king,

1682
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:24,080
and as king, it is all about you
and your power.

1683
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,124
There are no other opinions.
None.

1684
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,714
Is this a good time to ask

1685
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,507
why we are spending money
on catapults

1686
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,509
- when we have so many already?
- (sighs)

1687
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,636
It really just benefits
the catapult makers.

1688
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,596
Quiet, Gwen!

1689
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,480
I really think we just need
to get some sleep.

1690
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,100
No one asked you, Beatrice.

1691
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:50,690
(sighs)

1692
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,111
Your time is up, Robert.

1693
01:16:56,904 --> 01:17:00,199
You will marry Princess Laura
by week's end.

1694
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:02,618
I don't care
if you don't love each other.

1695
01:17:03,995 --> 01:17:05,788
So says the king.

1696
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:15,882
If the crown demands it...

1697
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,800
milord.

1698
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:24,015
Darling.

1699
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,226
(door bangs shut)

1700
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:33,900
What?

1701
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,527
Did you really just say
you don't care

1702
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:37,945
if they love each other?

1703
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,656
Yeah. I want the sea monster.

1704
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,575
What? Bea-Bea-Beatrice,
don't be...

1705
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,494
Ay... ay, ay, ay.

1706
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,912
- Your Highness.
- Yes?

1707
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,789
- Where'd you find that?
- It's the girl's.

1708
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:51,125
She threw it at my head.
I'm lucky to be alive.

1709
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,055
Look at our girl.

1710
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:05,848
Been up all night working.

1711
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:08,142
- She's betting on herself.
- JAMES: I couldn't do it.

1712
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:09,685
I would've married the prince.

1713
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:12,063
You think the prince
would've picked you?

1714
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:14,524
(scoffs)
Cuddly, cute, good at waving.

1715
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:15,775
I mean, come on.

1716
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,777
(mice squeaking)

1717
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,404
I can hear you.

1718
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:20,988
I bet you're arguing about why

1719
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:23,741
I didn't just say yes
to marrying Robert.

1720
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:26,786
Especially since I'm maybe
in love with him.

1721
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,496
JOHN:
Love? It was one night.

1722
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:29,872
- (shushes)
- (yelps)

1723
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:32,208
I never felt what I felt
last night before.

1724
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:36,295
I mean, you guys,
he's so handsome.

1725
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:37,856
- Oh, yes, he is incredibly handsome.
- Absolutely.

1726
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,507
- Annoyingly handsome.
- The cheekbones.

1727
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,758
And he likes me for me.

1728
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:42,301
Sounds like true love
to this mouse.

1729
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:44,095
You're right, my friend.

1730
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:47,098
But if saying yes to him

1731
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:50,017
means saying no to this...

1732
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:53,729
...I can't do it.

1733
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:55,648
All right, guys?

1734
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:59,444
I have to try and make a life
for myself, by myself.

1735
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:01,946
Because that is what I want.

1736
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:04,198
And Queen Tatiana is my chance.

1737
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:05,533
Right.

1738
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:06,993
- Who's Queen Tatiana?
- (knocking)

1739
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:08,345
VIVIAN:
Cinderella, are you down there?

1740
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:09,579
- Stepmother?
- Dear God, no.

1741
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,497
- She scares me.
- Me, too.

1742
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:15,084
-(knocking) -VIVIAN: Hello.
I'm waiting for my tea.

1743
01:19:15,168 --> 01:19:17,587
Cinderella.
Oh, I'm coming down.

1744
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,881
(squeaking)

1745
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:26,721
I'm sick.

1746
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:29,599
Uh-huh.

1747
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,900
Well, you didn't miss much
at the ball.

1748
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:44,989
The prince was fixated
on some mystery girl.

1749
01:19:46,574 --> 01:19:49,285
Then she ran away like a twit.

1750
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:52,747
So now he's to marry
Princess Laura of Northphalia

1751
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,373
the day after next.

1752
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:57,543
(sighs) Malvolia and Narissa,
they never stood a chance.

1753
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:01,130
And I was so foolish
to believe differently.

1754
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:04,967
A mother just gets carried away.

1755
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,555
I know I've been hard on you.

1756
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:12,767
It's not fueled by spite.

1757
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:27,073
I've never shared this
with anyone before, but...

1758
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:32,119
I used to play piano.

1759
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:34,247
Taught myself.

1760
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:38,626
And I was good.

1761
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:41,754
I was really good.

1762
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,716
Nothing made me happier.

1763
01:20:47,552 --> 01:20:50,596
Then one day,
I was given the opportunity

1764
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,724
to train at the finest
school of music,

1765
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:56,352
and I took it.
(chuckles softly)

1766
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,354
There I was...

1767
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:01,315
Two children, a loving husband,

1768
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:04,944
and I had the audacity
to want more.

1769
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:11,033
It was just a month... one month.

1770
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:15,371
And yet, when I returned,
my husband, well...

1771
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:20,209
...he believed real wives
didn't act so frivolously.

1772
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:29,510
You may think me cruel.

1773
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,479
But the real cruelty would be
for me to allow you to think

1774
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,315
that you can be
something you can't.

1775
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:49,989
(gasps)

1776
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:51,699
(mice squeaking)

1777
01:21:57,872 --> 01:21:59,290
This shoe.

1778
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,339
It was you.

1779
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:07,882
Cinderella.

1780
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,593
I don't know how you did
what you did last night,

1781
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,720
but the prince chose you.
He loves you.

1782
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,930
Marry him, and all of
our problems will be solved.

1783
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:17,433
I can't. I told him
I didn't want to marry him.

1784
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:18,768
Tell him you were wrong.

1785
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,603
Tell him... tell him
it's all you want.

1786
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:22,605
If not for yourself,
then-then do it for us.

1787
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:23,856
For your family.

1788
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,483
I can help our family,
Stepmother.

1789
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:26,609
I can provide for us.

1790
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:27,735
Don't be so stupid.

1791
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,278
Who taught you
to think that way?

1792
01:22:29,362 --> 01:22:31,482
Please, Cinderella, don't
throw away this opportunity.

1793
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,740
Go back to him.

1794
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:35,826
It's too late.

1795
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,828
He's marrying someone else.

1796
01:22:37,912 --> 01:22:39,538
It's over.

1797
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:47,046
Fine.

1798
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,803
Then I'm taking you to Thomas,

1799
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:56,597
and I'm giving you to him today.

1800
01:22:57,682 --> 01:22:59,892

You haven't spoken to me
since last night.

1865

Please, say something.

1869
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:35,649
You're making me
wildly uncomfortable.

1870
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:40,487
Have you ever wondered
why Robert makes

1871
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:42,448
the process to marry
so difficult?

1872
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:46,118
Because he's a spoiled child
who refuses to grow up. Simple.

1873
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,747
I believe it's because of the
example set before him by us.

1874
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,207
A marriage without love,
without respect.

1875
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:53,959
Bea, please,
you know I love you.

1876
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:55,711
Saying "love" and showing love

1877
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:58,380
are two very different things,
Rowan.

1878
01:26:58,464 --> 01:27:01,842
Before you were king,
I felt your love every day.

1879
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:04,470
You couldn't stand to be away
from me, even for a moment.

1880
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,972
Remember, you used to appear
at my window

1881
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:08,974
like a knight in shining armor

1882
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:12,478
and you'd serenade me
with your skull-splitting voice.

1883
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:14,146
We were young.

1884
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:17,066
Things... change.

1885
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,984
No. You changed.

1886
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:20,611
The crown changed you.

1887
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:23,489
You're so worried
to look a fool.

1888
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:26,825
So obsessed with your
reputation, with your legacy.

1889
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:28,911
Well, it's only my life's work.

1890
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:31,163
It causes me
a great deal of stress.

1891
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,308
Do you think you're the only
person who feels stress?

1892
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:35,751
God, try being your bloody wife.

1893
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:39,421
It is utterly exhausting to sit
next to you and just smile

1894
01:27:39,505 --> 01:27:41,423
as if I were nothing more
than a prop,

1895
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:44,259
my voice completely silenced.

1896
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:46,428
I mean, what I wouldn't give
to say, "You're wrong,"

1897
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:48,389
in front of the entire kingdom.

1898
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:49,974
Bea...

1899
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:52,101
you're being unreasonable now.

1900
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:56,021
Well, if you say so.

1901
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:58,107
After all, you're the king.

1902
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:02,486
Can't be any other opinions
other than yours.

1903
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:10,411
Do you know,
there's never a guarantee

1904
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:13,414
with a couple in our position.

1905
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:15,666
But we had love, Rowan.

1906
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:17,835
We had it.

1907
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:19,545
And now...

1908
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:24,174
Robert's wiser than both of us.

1909
01:28:27,428 --> 01:28:28,846
(knocking)

1910
01:28:31,849 --> 01:28:33,475
Hello.

1911
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:38,022
I'm ready.

1912
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,699
You summoned me, Your Highness?

1913
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:52,911
We can't have
a regular conversation

1914
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,830
like a normal father and son,

1915

No, no.

1916
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:58,627

you have to sit there

All because you're so insecure

1921
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,345

have to control my every move.

1922
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:12,014
Now, I ask you,

1923
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:14,266
does that sound
like a strong leader to you?

1924
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:15,726
ROWAN:
Robert...

1925
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:19,354

1926
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:30,991

A little bit.
You can't help yourself.

1929
01:29:43,629 --> 01:29:45,964
Go find the owner
of this glass slipper.

1930
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:50,177
And if she'll take you back,
then marry her.

1931
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,887

wasn't your mum.

a wedding to prepare?

I mean, no pressure,

2124
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:40,123
but there's an absurd amount
of pastries

2125
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:41,750
left over from that ball.

2126
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:43,793
No, no, we're not in a rush
to get married.

2127
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:45,730
Uh, instead, we're going to
travel the world together.

01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,090
I'm sorry if
my decision disrupts

2130
01:38:49,174 --> 01:38:50,860
- your plans for succession.
- Well, that's all right.

2131
01:38:50,884 --> 01:38:54,929
It just so happens I share blood
with another who, one day,

2132
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:57,932
will be the greatest leader
the realm has ever known.

2133
01:38:58,016 --> 01:38:59,768
Hear that, Gwen?

2134
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:02,812
What's happening?

2135
01:39:02,896 --> 01:39:04,696
- Gwen, my darling girl.
- (Beatrice chuckles)

2136
01:39:04,773 --> 01:39:09,277
I hereby place you first in line
to inherit the crown, hmm?

Good.

2142
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:25,877
Just so we're clear,
I'm going to rule the land?

2143
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,129
- Yes.
- Okay.

2144
01:39:29,506 --> 01:39:30,840
And everyone heard that?

2145
01:39:30,924 --> 01:39:32,318
- We did. Yes.
- Yes. -Yeah. Mm-hmm.

2146

Oh!

2147

So many ideas!

2148
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:39,516

where to begin!

2149
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:41,142
Oh, good.
Can I take this crown off?

2150
01:39:41,226 --> 01:39:42,686
- Yes.
- Shall we have some tea?

2151

2152
01:39:44,104 --> 01:39:45,814
GWEN:
It is my honor

2153
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:49,275
to guide this kingdom forward
into a new era.

2154
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:52,320
And to pay my deepest respects
to my brother,

2155
01:39:52,404 --> 01:39:55,156
Prince Robert, and his new...

2156
01:39:56,866 --> 01:39:58,493
What are we calling you?

2157
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:00,036
Well...

2158
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,163
I mean, we don't have to put
a label on it.

2159
01:40:02,247 --> 01:40:03,873
Just... in love?

2160
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:05,125
(mutters):
I don't know.

2161
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:06,918
In love?

2162
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,962
Yeah.

2163
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:10,797
In love.

2164
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,800

2167

I believe this belongs to you.

2168
01:40:31,818 --> 01:40:33,528
My mother's brooch.

2169
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:35,822

on your voyage.

2170
01:40:35,905 --> 01:40:37,323
