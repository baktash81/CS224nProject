1
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:06,066
The manager let her into the apartment early this morning.

2
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:09,939
She'd been out all night
and lost her keys.

3
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,601
He said she moved in
a couple weeks ago.

4
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,081
Hello?

5
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,778
Yes, this is
Dr. Keener.

6
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:38,696
Who's this?

7
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,920
Hi.

8
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:47,836
Yes.

9
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,579
Yes. Could you
come by today?

10
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:55,496
Anytime's fine.

11
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,499
I'll see you
at 2:00.

12
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,012
Hi. Is Dr. Rosen in?

13
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,624
This is Dr. Keener.

14
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,803
Okay. No,
I'll call him back.

15
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:45,197
I'm not
in my office today.

16
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,201
Thank you. Uh, actually,
would you give him the message?

17
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,293
Dr. Keener.

18
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,253
He has my number.

19
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:04,304
Thank you.
Would you happen to know what time he'll be back?

20
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:10,179
No. Okay. Yeah.

21
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:14,226
No, of course.
Of course.

22
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:16,881
Thank you. Bye-bye.

23
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:55,485
Hello. Dr. Rosen, please.
This is Dr. Keener.

24
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:58,401
Thank you.

25
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,714
Hello.

26
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,330
Oh, no. It's okay.
I'll call him back later.

27
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,247
Thank you. Yes.

28
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,555
Bye-bye.

29
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,194
Hi. I'm Christine Taylor.

30
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:40,024
I'm...

31
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,289
We spoke earlier.
I'm Debbie's friend.

32
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:45,726
Yes. Come in.

33
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:20,369
Have you ever consulted
the cards before? No.

34
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:23,067
Oh, somebody once
read my palm.

35
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,548
Which one?

36
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:27,811
Uh, the left.

37
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,596
Mmm.

38
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:32,686
Both hands are really necessary to do a proper reading.

39
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:35,515
Oh.
We were just fooling around.

40
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,429
Didn't really...

41
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,693
I think you're
gonna like the cards.

42
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,305
Was there anything in particular that you wanna talk about?

43
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,438
No.

44
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,137
Okay, well, I'll just do
a general outlook,

45
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:52,706
and then if you have any specific questions,
you can ask me at the end.

46
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,534
All right.

47
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:01,018
You're a Scorpio.

48
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,238
Yes.Okay.

49
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:06,023
Are you ready?

50
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:18,166
Okay, um, go ahead
and pick ten cards.

51
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,169
You're not happy.

52
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:10,566
You're good at pretending that everything in your life is good,

53
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:15,876
and you give off a great sense of security and self-confidence, but...

54
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,140
You're not satisfied.

55
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,404
You don't
know yourself well.

56
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:27,148
You're restless
and unsettled.

57
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,630
You're a great pretender.

58
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,372
You've been married,

59
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,594
but you're presently
divorced or separated.

60
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:41,379
You like to give the impression that you're happy to be by yourself,

61
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:45,557
but in reality,
you're mortified that your marriage failed.

62
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:50,650
You believe it's your fault
that it failed, and...

63
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,347
It may be so.

64
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:59,702
Regret in that area has caused you a great deal of pain.

65
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,664
You don't have
any lifelong friends.

66
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,536
The friends you have you made
while you were married,

67
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:09,059
and you weren't
close to them.

68
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:12,497
They were mostly
your husband's friends.

69
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,151
Some of them wanted
to be close to you,

70
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,545
but they felt
that you were inaccessible...

71
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:19,679
Or that you were aloof.

72
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,553
And you're very secretive.

73
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,730
And you don't trust easily.

74
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:32,082
And when you do let someone in,
you later regret it,

75
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,997
or resent them.

76
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,394
I think that you feel that sooner or later everyone is a disappointment.

77
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,792
You can be assertive and hands-on,
especially in a crisis.

78
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:52,799
But I think you live in constant fear of tragedy.

79
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:56,280
You're very,
very afraid of change.

80
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,721
You've met a man?

81
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,593
At work?

82
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,947
Or related to work that
you're very taken with?

83
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,689
Maybe you're even
obsessed with him.

84
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,694
But I don't think
he's affectionate.

85
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,914
And he's not someone who is easy to get to know intimately.

86
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:24,352
And you should be careful
about misunderstandings

87
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:28,791
because you have a tendency to become quickly infatuated,
and then...

88
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:32,360
You get embarrassedor depressed

89
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:36,494
because things didn't turn out the way you expected them to.

90
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:47,854
You're a daydreamer.

91
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,073
To set yourself up
for falls.

92
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,948
You should let me know if we're moving in the right direction.

93
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,820
It's possible we could
take a wrong turn

94
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:03,043
and get lost, especially
since it's our first time.

95
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,786
You're...
Let's go on.

96
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,665
Excuse me.

97
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:22,802
Hello?

98
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,241
Hi. I'm fine. How are you?
Can I call you back?

99
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,460
All right.
Bye-bye.

100
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:32,072
Yes. Yes, of course.
Good-bye.

101
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:49,785
Lately I've had the feeling that my, uh,
life is going to change.

102
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,788
It's a very strong feeling.

103
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,096
Can you see that?

104
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,710
I've been having dreams.

105
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,669
What kind of dreams?

106
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,773
If there's bad news,
I don't want you to tell me.

107
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:59,811
I'm sorry. There's usually a nurse,
but she had to take the day off.

108
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,727
Just tell me
about this year.

109
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:05,774
Well, um...

110
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,822
Hmm.
You seem to be very concerned with finding a man.

111
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,260
Someone who you can
depend on.

112
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,350
Somebody who you can
share your life with.

113
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:21,833
And there is a man who
will be interested in you.

114
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:25,228
The man
you mentioned before?

115
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,841
The one at work?

116
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,409
No, this is somebody
you've never met.

117
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,847
A younger man.

118
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,459
Well, the man at work
is younger than I am.

119
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,113
A couple of years.

120
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:44,900
He's...

121
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:47,947
Tall.

122
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:52,821
Fair skin.

123
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:56,868
Has brown eyes.

124
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:00,872
No.

125
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:06,008
You sure it's not somebody
I already know?

126
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,664
This is a new man.

127
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:22,982
You know, Dr.
Keener, none of this is written in stone.

128
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:26,028
I mean, these are
your cards today, but...

129
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,943
Nothing happens
without you.

130
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,599
Good night, princess.

131
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:15,746
What time is it?

132
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,227
It's a quarter to 2:00.

133
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:22,144
I'm gonna leave before I turn into a pumpkin.

134
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,431
Susan, good morning.Good morning.

135
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,306
Hey.

136
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,062
Hi, this is Rebecca Weyman.
Can Debbie see me today?

137
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,196
Uh-huh.

138
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:19,027
Yeah, okay.
I'll be there. Thanks.

139
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,906
Do you have
a cigarette for us? No.

140
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:04,942
Are you waiting
for someone? No.

141
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:08,119
So what are you doing standing here smoking like a whore?

142
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,600
You're not a whore,
are you? No.

143
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:13,212
So what are you?

144
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,041
I work here.

145
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:20,393
Are you a teller?
Do you handle the money?

146
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,133
I'm the bank manager.

147
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,615
If you're the manager,
why can't you smoke inside?

148
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:27,748
There's no smoking inside.

149
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:31,099
What good is it then
to be the boss?

150
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:36,060
I don't know.

151
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,640
I robbed a bank once.

152
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:53,991
A long time ago when my husband and I came out here,

153
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,298
we tried to rob a bank
in Glendale.

154
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:59,301
It was a joke.

155
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,347
He almost
got himself killed.

156
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,262
But we got away.
No money, though.

157
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,829
We couldn't get our hands
on any money.

158
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,615
What does
your husband do?

159
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,575
Or doesn't he work?
Is he a kept man?

160
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:15,665
I don't have a husband.

161
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,365
Of course you do.I'm not married.

162
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:21,018
Show me your ring finger.

163
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:26,154
Are you a lesbian? No.

164
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:31,028
Are you? Do I look like a lesbian?

165
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:39,559
Did you study
to become a bank manger?

166
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:42,692
Or does Daddy own the bank?
Is that it?

167
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,303
Daddy owns it?

168
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,783
No, I trained
with the bank.

169
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:52,223
Ooh!
I bet that training included things you'd be too ashamed to talk about.

170
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,488
Like what? You tell me.

171
00:21:55,575 --> 00:22:00,319
I'm sure you had to do all sorts of things to get to the top.

172
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,495
That's the second time
you've called me a whore.

173
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:09,240
I wanna walk away with
the rest of your cigarettes.

174
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:15,943
You can send one of your assistants to buy you more.

175
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,337
You have men
working under you?

176
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,164
Yes.Send them.

177
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:23,037
They'll hate you for it.

178
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:30,044
But they'll jack off Just thinkin' about you, anyway.

179
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:33,352
Thank you for your time.

180
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,876
Have a nice day.

181
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:38,139
You haven't
told me your name.

182
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,099
Nancy.

183
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,725
Rebecca.
I need you to sign these.

184
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:03,773
I'm taking a long lunch.
Cover for me? Sure.

185
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:13,653
Do you think the men in the bank resent that a woman is in charge?

186
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,398
I'm okay with it.

187
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,574
And the others?

188
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:24,011
I haven't heard anything.
It's mostly women in here, anyway.

189
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,316
If they weren't okay with it,
would it matter?

190
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,412
Do you think they have
sexual fantasies about me?

191
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:44,814
Uh, I'm sure they do.

192
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,175
See you later.

193
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,747
Come on,
you son of a bitch!

194
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:10,492
Come on,
you son of a bitch!

195
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,973
Come on,
you son of a bitch!

196
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:21,068
Hey, stranger.
How're you doin'?

197
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:22,548
Never better.

198
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:24,027
When was the last time
you were here?

199
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,160
I don't know.
In the fall, I think.

200
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:30,991
March of last year.
That's too long. Any problems?

201
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,471
I took
a home pregnancy test,

202
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,516
and it lit up
like a Christmas tree.

203
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,518
Do you remember the date
of your last period?

204
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,781
Um... I haven't had one
since April.

205
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,523
Well, I'll have a look.

206
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,960
Have you been
trying to get pregnant? No.

207
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:46,354
I use a diaphragm,
but I had a couple of encounters without it.

208
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,009
That'll do it.

209
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:55,711
I was in a hurry.

210
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:00,150
I always say to my husband,
"Go slow 'cause I'm in a hurry."

211
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:01,674
Come on.
Scoot down.

212
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:15,122
Six weeks pregnant.

213
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:18,125
Does six weeks
sound about right to you? Yes.

214
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:22,651
Well, that means that you are due around January 7.

215
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:25,349
I don't wanna be pregnant.

216
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:26,568
You don't? No.

217
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,570
You wanna
have an abortion?

218
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:30,920
Yes.

219
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,401
Have you ever
been pregnant before? Uh-uh.

220
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:34,620
And you are how old?

221
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:36,926
Thirty-nine.

222
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:40,277
Well, I gotta tell ya,
this might be your last call.

223
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,410
I mean,
do you wanna take a few days and think about it?

224
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:44,194
No.

225
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,153
Maybe there's someone
you wanna talk it over with?

226
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,417
Nope.
I have a hunch his wife is not gonna like it.

227
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:54,378
Is this an ongoing thing? Yes.

228
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,467
How long? Three years.

229
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,644
And you have never
mentioned it.

230
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:01,647
Oh, I told you about him.
I just never told you the details.

231
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:05,389
Well,
that is a big detail.

232
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:11,178
So what's in store
for the future?

233
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:13,093
Only a fool would say.

234
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:18,838
The doctor can see you tomorrow at 3:00 or Friday at 11:00.

235
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:20,491
Tomorrow at 3:00.

236
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:24,147
There you go.
See you then.Oh, thanks.

237
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,649
I'll see you tomorrow.

238
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,869
Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

239
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:01,532
Hey.

240
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:04,535
I'm out of cigarettes.

241
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,625
I'll run
and get us some.

242
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,240
Keep the change.

243
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,459
I'm going to.

244
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,548
Are you
on your way home? Yes.

245
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,247
Home is where
the love is.

246
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,552
See you later.

247
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,380
Are you in a hurry,
sister?

248
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,469
Yes, I am.

249
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:27,646
Children are waiting? No.

250
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,822
I didn't think so.

251
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:41,964
Hi.

252
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:43,749
Yes, it is I.

253
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:46,926
The king. The king.

254
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,545
Are you hungry?

255
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,547
I can't stay long.

256
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:00,983
Where are you going?

257
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,681
I gotta get to bed early.

258
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:06,206
I'm on a 7:00 a.m. flight
to San Francisco.

259
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:09,557
Seems that, uh,
Samuelson and his guys don't wanna play with us.

260
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:11,254
What happened?

261
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,086
I don't know.
I don't know.

262
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:19,741
They got cold feet
or something.

263
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:22,396
Interest on the financing
of the second stage.

264
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:24,703
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

265
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,011
Let's not
talk about it.

266
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:30,621
It's boring.

267
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:46,637
What about you?
You look tired.

268
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:50,032
I am a little bit.

269
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:52,992
I'm late with my period.

270
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,776
You're always late.

271
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:57,866
I saw the doctor at lunchtime.
I'm six weeks pregnant.

272
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:01,043
What happened?

273
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,481
I didn't have the diaphragm with me that time in Palm Springs.

274
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:06,701
Why not?

275
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:12,228
I counted days and figured
we'd be okay without it.

276
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:17,320
She set up an appointment for me tomorrow afternoon to take care of it.

277
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:20,802
I won't be able
to get back in time.

278
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,064
That's okay.

279
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,771
Whatever happened
to Vera?

280
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:35,251
Did she ever call back about those Mexican
tapestries she wanted to show us?

281
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:39,647
No. I'll... I'll
try her tonight.

282
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:42,258
Yeah. See if she can
come by Saturday evening.

283
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:43,477
Okay.

284
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:47,611
I'd like to get one
like Rosen has.

285
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:50,179
Yeah.Huh?
For right over there.

286
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,851
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

287
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:15,901
I'll come by
in the evening.

288
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,641
We'll eat out.

289
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:19,818
Get some sleep.

290
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:29,305
You don't think I should
have this baby, do you?

291
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,725
You should be
home sleeping.

292
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,814
I plan to work you
into the ground tomorrow.

293
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,730
Hey! Have a seat.No, I'm on my way home.

294
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:49,298
Oh. Do you
live near here? Mmm. Sherman Oaks.

295
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:50,952
Oh.You in Studio City?

296
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,520
Yeah, yeah.
I'm, uh...

297
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,348
My daughter's spending
the week with her mother,

298
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:58,307
so I'm out looking
for trouble.

299
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:00,744
Are you finding any? No.

300
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:03,617
It's still early.

301
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,925
Would you like a drink?

302
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,970
Uh, a glass of red wine.

303
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:13,583
Are you out here
every night?

304
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:16,586
Yes.

305
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:19,894
I was really looking forward to my daughter
spending the week with her mother,

306
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:24,116
and now that she's gone,
I don't know what to do with myself.

307
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:26,770
How old is
your daughter? She's nine.

308
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:29,556
You should bring her to work sometime.
We'll show her the ropes.

309
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:31,384
I'll get her started
on the art of giving orders.

310
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:33,386
Believe me,
she's a natural.

311
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:36,258
I mean it.
I wanna meet her.

312
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:37,999
I can't promise
I'll bring her to the bank,

313
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:40,132
but we'll invite you
for dinner.

314
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:42,525
That'll be better.
June is blind.

315
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:45,659
I didn't know that.
Was she born blind?

316
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:48,270
Yes.

317
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,664
That's a tough draw,
but you have to learn to play the hard hand.

318
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,014
Mmm, all my money's on her.
She's the queen.

319
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,495
And you're her king.

320
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,936
June.

321
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:05,070
That's a good name.

322
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:07,028
Yeah.
It's her mother's name.

323
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:12,599
So, you plan on
working me hard tomorrow?

324
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:15,254
Mmm, I've gotta take
the afternoon off.

325
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:19,040
I need you to cover for me
one more time.

326
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:21,956
I'm your man.

327
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,536
Would you
like a drink?

328
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,855
Hey.

329
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:20,248
Good morning.

330
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:25,819
Thanks for the candy.

331
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,299
I always carry it with me
just in case.

332
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,741
I was a little hurt
you didn't say goodbye.

333
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:36,612
Were you hurt?
I'm sorry.

334
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,311
You don't sound sorry.

335
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:42,923
I'm not big on regret.

336
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,187
I got your change.

337
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,626
And I bought us...

338
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:53,673
Winstons.

339
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,109
Who's this? Walter.

340
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,372
Is he your husband?

341
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:59,069
He works at the bank.

342
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,769
He works for you?
Under you? What is that like?

343
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:05,075
What is what like? Working for her.

344
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,383
What is your name?

345
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,645
Danielle.

346
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:14,172
Is that your real name?

347
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:17,175
That's a whore's name.
Is that her real name?

348
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,047
Be careful with her.

349
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:21,353
Why?

350
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,224
She's a snake.

351
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,400
A snake
as well as a whore.

352
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,707
That's not very nice.

353
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:29,578
Does your husband know
that you're here?

354
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:32,668
Does he know that you're sitting here with this man?

355
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:38,021
I told you I'm not married.
We went over this yesterday. Remember?

356
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:40,241
You showed me
your wedding ring.

357
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:46,552
Let me tell you
about love.

358
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,512
You don't ask,
you give.

359
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:56,388
A sneak like you
doesn't know this.

360
00:36:56,475 --> 00:37:00,087
You wouldn't know a good man if he bit you on the tit.

361
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:04,134
And a good man, if he saw you,
would cry to see a...

362
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,875
Listen,
I think that's enough.

363
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:09,096
No. Keep going.

364
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,273
You're disgusting.

365
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,102
One look at you
was enough for me.

366
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,496
A sad bitch.

367
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:21,326
A lonely bitch.

368
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:24,503
You're as lonely
as a dog.

369
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,289
It's not that
I don't like you.

370
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:34,034
I like you, princess.
I feel sorry for you.

371
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:42,390
I'm going to keep
smoking your cigarettes.

372
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:07,807
Ma'am,
what are you doing?

373
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:09,287
I have to talk
to the boss.

374
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,202
The manager.
No, no!

375
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,162
I have to fight with...
Where's the boss?

376
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:18,383
Ah! Danielle!
Danielle!

377
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,995
I have to talk to her!
Go get her! Damn you!

378
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:25,303
Son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

379
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,794
I won't be back
until tomorrow.

380
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,927
Thanks for
minding the store.

381
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:42,276
Rebecca?

382
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:45,932
This is feeling
a little strange.

383
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,934
You've been
avoiding me all day.

384
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:50,502
Perhaps you're more accustomed to doing the avoiding.

385
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:55,245
Perhaps.

386
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,074
Or did you think this could be a regular romance?

387
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:01,426
I'll see you tomorrow.

388
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:50,779
Hey. All set?

389
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:54,174
How long
will this take?

390
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:56,132
It's just gonna take a few minutes.
It's a real quickie.

391
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,047
But they're gonna ask you
to stay for a while,

392
00:39:58,134 --> 00:40:00,310
and you're not gonna
be able to drive.

393
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,790
Did someone come in
with you?

394
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:03,270
Robert's gonna
pick me up at 4:00.

395
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:08,406
Why are you here, Deb?

396
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,277
I just wanna stop by,
say hello.

397
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:12,584
I don't want you
to stay.

398
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:14,455
Are you sure
about this?

399
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:15,935
I don't want you here.

400
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,288
Hello.
I'm Dr. Keener.

401
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,420
Hi.

402
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:26,728
We're ready? Yes.

403
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:28,687
Very well.
Will you lie down?

404
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:36,434
Now, this won't knock you out.
It's just to relax you.

405
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,131
I'm all right.

406
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,317
Squish down a little bit more for me, please.

407
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:54,364
Would you move
this over, please?

408
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:57,063
I'm gonna see your chart.

409
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,501
All right.

410
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:03,156
Okay, this might be
a little cold.

411
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:11,904
Did anyone call when I was in with Judy Good?

412
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,993
I don't think so, Doctor.
You want me to check?

413
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:16,212
No.

414
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:18,824
Okay, you're gonna
feel a little stick.

415
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:25,787
All right.

416
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:33,403
Oh, it's hot in this room.
Do something about the air, please.

417
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:47,026
Do you need
all three of these?

418
00:41:47,113 --> 00:41:48,506
Yeah.

419
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:55,904
Okay. Try to hold still.

420
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:01,606
How're you doin'?

421
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:08,395
We're almost done.

422
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:10,049
We're almost done.

423
00:45:44,437 --> 00:45:46,744
Mom, what do I have
back here? Where?

424
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:49,572
Right here.Is this it?

425
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:51,792
No, go left.
More left.

426
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:53,533
"Further" left.

427
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,406
That's it.Ah. That's a freckle.

428
00:45:57,493 --> 00:45:59,495
You sure? Yes.

429
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:01,367
'Cause if it's something else,
I want you to pop it.

430
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:03,804
I've seen
freckles before, Jay.

431
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:04,849
You can't even
see it.

432
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:06,807
How'd you find it?

433
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:10,158
I felt it rubbing against
my shirt, and it itches.

434
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:11,681
Let me see.

435
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:16,599
Don't think you have
anything to worry about.

436
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:18,471
Did you brush?
Let me smell your breath.No!

437
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:20,081
Come on.
What's the big deal?

438
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:22,475
I'm not gonna
let you do it.

439
00:46:22,562 --> 00:46:24,477
Hey, better me than someone else saying you need to brush more often.

440
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:27,219
Hmm?
You never know when you're gonna get close.

441
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:30,178
Forget it.Come on. I'm just asking
to smell your breath.

442
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:33,312
I'm not asking for your hand in marriage.

443
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:37,707
Fine.
I'll let you this once if you promise it'll be the last time.

444
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,839
Promise.

445
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,755
I promise.

446
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:49,719
Mmm. It's good.

447
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,504
Of course.

448
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,726
Ma, can I start
the car? Yeah, I'll be right there.

449
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:21,142
Okay, let's go.

450
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:23,928
Did you see that?

451
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:26,844
He's a dwarf.Yes, Jay, he is.

452
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,847
I never met
a dwarf before.

453
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:33,851
We're gonna have to stop by later and introduce ourselves.

454
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:35,809
You would do that, Jay?

455
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:38,246
You would actually go across the street and introduce yourself?

456
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,640
You don't feel weird about meeting a dwarf,
do you?

457
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,469
I certainly don't feel weird about introducing myself to a new neighbor,

458
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:45,514
but please don't
call him a dwarf.

459
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:48,866
He is a dwarf.
We'll stop by this evening and say hello.

460
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:52,043
I wonder what time
dwarfs go to bed.

461
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,566
Jay, that's enough.

462
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:56,569
Shut up, Mom.
I'm not gonna embarrass you.

463
00:47:56,656 --> 00:47:58,745
Do you wanna go there by yourself?
Better be careful.

464
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:01,139
Those little guys, I tell you,
they know how to work a lady.

465
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:04,751
Jay! You are totally
out of control.

466
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:19,853
Let's go.

467
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,819
Gary and I have to work on the Getty Project,
so he'll drive me home.

468
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,734
Who was that girl?

469
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:33,911
What girl?

470
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:38,785
A friend.From school?

471
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:40,787
Yes.I never saw her before.

472
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:42,963
You don't know her.What's her name?

473
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,660
Angelica.

474
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:48,012
Angelica.
What a beautiful name.

475
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:49,883
She seemed
very friendly.

476
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,189
Oh, yeah.

477
00:48:54,888 --> 00:48:56,803
See ya later,
peach face.

478
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,674
Gary.
How are you? What's up?

479
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:00,111
Hey, what's up?
How are you? Hey, how are you?

480
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:01,416
Good, thanks.

481
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:25,919
Hi.

482
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:01,433
Excuse me, sir.

483
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,047
We haven't met,
but I believe you're moving into the house across the street from mine.

484
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:10,833
Uh, I'm on my way home.
I could give you a ride if you need one.

485
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,098
How do you know I'm moving into the
house across the street from yours?

486
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:18,885
I saw you with the movers this morning.
On Cynthia Street.

487
00:50:18,972 --> 00:50:20,626
And you're sure
it was me you saw.

488
00:50:22,976 --> 00:50:24,934
Yes, I... I'm sure.

489
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:27,459
Of course it was me.

490
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:30,070
I'm just surprised you're willing to pick up strange men.

491
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:31,898
Surprised, but thankful.

492
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,810
Oh!

493
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:33,264
Thanks for this.You're welcome.

494
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:35,266
I just bought a car,
but it won't come in until next week.

495
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:37,094
Oh, are you moving here
from out of town?

496
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:39,487
From Covina.

497
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:42,273
I didn't even know that house was for sale.
It's been empty for so long.

498
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,362
I didn't buy it.Oh.

499
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:47,539
It's my mother's house.Oh. Really?

500
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:50,194
Yes. I was
born in that house.

501
00:51:50,281 --> 00:51:52,196
Is your mother
moving in there with you?

502
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:53,849
No.Oh.

503
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:58,027
She died last year.

504
00:51:58,419 --> 00:51:59,594
Oh, I'm sorry.

505
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:01,640
Don't worry about it.

506
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:04,599
We hadn't said a word to each other in over 20 years.

507
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:11,824
I left home when I was 16,
and she never forgave me.

508
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:14,609
Why did you leave home?

509
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:16,394
I joined the circus.

510
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:26,099
You joined the circus
when you were 16?

511
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:29,276
I fell in love with a girl who worked in a circus,
and I ran away with her.

512
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:32,888
Wow.

513
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,543
That's quite a story.

514
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,110
It's not all that exciting.

515
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:39,417
I became a bookkeeper
with that circus.

516
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:41,070
Perhaps you thought
I was a lion tamer?

517
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:45,205
No, I... I didn't.

518
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:48,077
I'm allergic to cats.

519
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,386
What kind of business
are you in? Um...

520
00:52:52,473 --> 00:52:54,345
I... I write books
for children.

521
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:57,783
Storybooks? Yes. I've just started,
really.

522
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,263
I'm a schoolteacher.

523
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,525
Do you have
children yourself?

524
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:04,050
I have a son.
Jay. He's 15.

525
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:09,273
I wanted to be a writer once.
A writer of short stories.

526
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:12,624
I don't write anymore.Why not?

527
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:14,452
I wasn't any good.

528
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:17,803
I didn't work at it
hard enough, and it's...

529
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,457
It's a lonely job.

530
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:25,376
Are you still
with the circus? No.

531
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:28,857
I left that years ago.
I work for a hospital now.

532
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:31,251
I guess that would
make my mother happy.

533
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:34,167
She and I didn't make up
before she passed.

534
00:53:35,386 --> 00:53:36,909
I regret that
very much.

535
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:41,043
What happened
to the girl? Which one?

536
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,132
The one with the circus.

537
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,701
She's with another man.

538
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:53,142
Thank God we're here.

539
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,145
You're making me think of things I haven't thought about for a long time.

540
00:54:00,715 --> 00:54:03,109
Let me help you
carry them in the house.

541
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:05,720
Don't worry about it.
I'll get it.

542
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,506
Thanks for the lift.

543
00:54:08,593 --> 00:54:10,334
I didn't even
introduce myself.

544
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:11,987
Albert.Rose.

545
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:15,164
Rose.
Which is your house?

546
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,731
That one. There.

547
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:20,300
Well...

548
00:57:50,597 --> 00:57:51,772
Oh.

549
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:01,799
Oh, stinker.

550
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,672
Jay?

551
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:07,544
Rose?

552
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:10,459
Come in here.

553
00:59:13,724 --> 00:59:15,769
Hungry? Always.

554
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:18,424
Give me two minutes.

555
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,122
Make you pizza.

556
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:22,733
What are
you workin' on?

557
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,256
Two Frogs.

558
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:27,433
Can we invite the dwarf?

559
00:59:28,826 --> 00:59:30,479
His name's Albert.

560
00:59:31,306 --> 00:59:33,439
How do you know that?

561
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:35,833
I ran into him in the supermarket,
and I gave him a ride home.

562
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,400
You gave a dwarf
a ride home?

563
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:41,490
Jay, stop calling him a dwarf.
His name's Albert.

564
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,453
I almost...
I almost got us into an accident.

565
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,759
He made you nervous.

566
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:50,935
No. He was very friendly.

567
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:56,331
I bet he was.What's that supposed
to mean?

568
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:59,204
Thank you, Jay.

569
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,597
I thought
you might like that.

570
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:02,599
What else? What else, what?

571
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:04,209
Well, tell me more
about the dwarf, Albert.

572
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:08,343
No.

573
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:16,656
Got it.

574
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:22,662
Who was that
on the phone?

575
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:23,663
Dad.

576
01:00:24,795 --> 01:00:26,405
He said to say "hello."

577
01:00:27,536 --> 01:00:29,016
Thanks.

578
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:31,453
You guys getting together
this Saturday?

579
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,674
No. They're going away
to Mexico for the weekend.

580
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:35,806
Guess who I saw today.Who?

581
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:38,591
Edmund.Edmund?

582
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:40,506
Where? Coming out
of a bank.

583
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:43,161
He didn't see me.

584
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:45,685
I haven't seen him
in a long time.

585
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:48,645
He's a character,
isn't he? Why do you say that?

586
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:50,777
A 400-pound man
who courted you

587
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:53,475
by taking you to Pink's Hot Dogs for spicy Polish sausages?

588
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:55,652
He had a hard time burping his way into your heart,
didn't he?

589
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:58,263
Jay, he wasn't after me.

590
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,178
Oh, no. Of course not.

591
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,532
Did he ever kiss you? Jay, please. Stop.

592
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:07,620
I hope he did.

593
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:09,317
Well, what if he had?

594
01:01:09,404 --> 01:01:13,582
Did he?

595
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:16,847
Really? And what
is my type?

596
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:19,676
I don't know.
Someone lighter.

597
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,462
Someone with wings.

598
01:01:26,857 --> 01:01:28,597
You'll find someone.

599
01:01:31,078 --> 01:01:32,558
What makes you think
I'm looking?

600
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,082
Everyone's looking.

601
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:37,737
Really? Yeah.

602
01:01:37,824 --> 01:01:40,000
How did you come
to that conclusion?

603
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:42,089
Because love rules, baby.

604
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:47,399
And what about you?
Are you looking?

605
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,835
Always.

606
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:52,317
Are you finding it?

607
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:54,493
Sometimes.Hmm.

608
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:58,366
Well, if you have
a girlfriend,

609
01:01:58,453 --> 01:01:59,933
how come I don't know
about it?

610
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:02,240
I don't have one.

611
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:05,199
What about that girl
we saw today, Angelica?

612
01:02:05,286 --> 01:02:07,811
Is she your girlfriend? Nah.

613
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,552
We're friendly.

614
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:12,467
You're friendly? Yes.

615
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:19,736
I slept with her once,
if that's what you're asking.

616
01:02:29,093 --> 01:02:31,660
Did you use a condom? Of course.

617
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:34,446
She was after me.
How could I refuse?

618
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:42,644
Ma?

619
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:44,385
Yeah?

620
01:03:44,472 --> 01:03:47,171
My clock's out of batteries.
Can you wake me up?

621
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:58,878
Sure. What time?

622
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:01,750
Hasta la vista.

623
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:04,666
See you tomorrow.

624
01:04:04,753 --> 01:04:09,889
Close the door, Rose.

625
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,937
When?

626
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:16,156
About me and that girl.

627
01:04:16,243 --> 01:04:20,030
You didn't scare me,
you just caught me by surprise, that's all.

628
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:23,337
Why?

629
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,127
All set.

630
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:48,254
I dreamt that
I was feeling better,

631
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:53,303
and I asked you to drive me to Claire's Bakery.

632
01:08:55,261 --> 01:09:00,136
And on the way there,
we got in a huge argument about your hair.

633
01:09:02,312 --> 01:09:04,357
You say to me
that you want to cut it.

634
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:07,012
I say to you,
"It's fine the way it is," blah, blah, blah.

635
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:14,802
You get upset, and, uh,
you wait in the car.

636
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:18,066
And it did feel so great
to be out of the house.

637
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:22,549
But I'm scared

638
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:25,248
because I've heard that when people are very ill

639
01:09:25,335 --> 01:09:27,554
and they suddenly
feel better,

640
01:09:27,641 --> 01:09:31,254
it sometimes means
that the end is near.

641
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:34,605
It's like the body
makes one last effort

642
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:38,348
before losing the battle
altogether, you know?

643
01:09:40,132 --> 01:09:43,875
And I wanna buy you a loaf
of olive bread.

644
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:49,228
But I have no money.

645
01:09:50,577 --> 01:09:52,884
I only have sand
in my pocket.

646
01:09:55,582 --> 01:09:59,282
When I come out,
you've gone and left me there.

647
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:05,026
It's just an ugly dream.

648
01:10:06,463 --> 01:10:09,901
Don't think about it.

649
01:10:13,383 --> 01:10:15,211
I'm scared, Chris.

650
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:20,085
I'm really,
really scared now.

651
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:34,708
Look, baby. New birds.

652
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:37,145
Oh, yeah.

653
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:41,280
Canaries.

654
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:43,978
How can you tell?

655
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:47,547
I can see 'em.
Two males, probably.

656
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:50,855
How do you know that?

657
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:53,118
Only the males sing.

658
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:58,079
I had canaries the whole time I was growing up.

659
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:01,126
Really?
You never told me that.

660
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:04,651
Well, not the whole time,
but I had a couple once.

661
01:11:05,696 --> 01:11:07,480
A boy gave 'em to me.

662
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,308
What boy?

663
01:11:10,396 --> 01:11:12,093
This boy who was
in love with me.

664
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,530
Oh, get out.

665
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,315
Yeah. Salvador.

666
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:22,190
He stole money
from his father's wallet,

667
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,975
and he bought me
a pair of canaries.

668
01:11:26,064 --> 01:11:28,327
And I...

669
01:11:28,414 --> 01:11:31,461
I was once late
for this soccer game,

670
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:35,943
and I knew that my mother wouldn't
drive me if I didn't clean up my room.

671
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:47,520
And that included cleaning out the bottom of the birdcage.

672
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:53,570
And I opened up the door
of the cage, real careful,

673
01:11:53,657 --> 01:11:57,356
and I stuck the hose
in there

674
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:59,227
and turned on
the machine.

675
01:12:01,491 --> 01:12:05,277
One of 'em got sucked up
right off the bat.

676
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:07,192
No.

677
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:09,281
Head first.

678
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:14,286
And it was a rubber hose,
and I still remember that feeling

679
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:17,245
of that bird squeezing through inside my hand.

680
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,771
Oh, my...
Come on, Christine.

681
01:12:20,858 --> 01:12:23,513
Oh, geez.
Is that a true story?

682
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:26,037
Of course.

683
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,911
And what happened
to the other canary?

684
01:12:32,522 --> 01:12:35,046
I don't remember
what happened to her.

685
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:40,486
Maybe we should
get canaries too?

686
01:13:34,714 --> 01:13:37,108
Hey, it's Vicky,
callin' to see how everyone's doin' over there.

687
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:55,343
Christine? Yeah?

688
01:14:00,131 --> 01:14:02,350
Baby, I heard you
talking before.

689
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:08,052
Oh, um, I was
playing back old messages.

690
01:14:08,139 --> 01:14:11,142
Did my mama call back? Um, no.

691
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:14,928
No, that
was her old message.Oh. Who else?

692
01:14:17,757 --> 01:14:18,976
Vicky.

693
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:23,284
How you feel? It hurts a little.

694
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:27,071
What did Vicky say?

695
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:30,422
She just wanted to know
how we were doin'.

696
01:14:30,509 --> 01:14:33,077
Uh-huh.
That's what she said?

697
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:35,166
"How are you guys doing?"

698
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:40,563
I'm not sure exactly,
but I can play it back for you.

699
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,566
No, no, no. Just tell me
how you remember it.

700
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:47,091
"How's everybody
doin' over there?"

701
01:14:48,266 --> 01:14:50,529
That sounds like her.

702
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:52,575
Wasn't she supposed
to come and visit?

703
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:54,664
She's coming tomorrow.Oh.

704
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:02,193
Stay.

705
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:35,531
Vicky has always
had a crush on you.

706
01:15:35,618 --> 01:15:36,923
That isn't true.

707
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:39,404
Yes, it is.

708
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:44,583
When we met you,
she said that you looked like a very affectionate person,

709
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:48,282
and that it would be great
to know you intimately.

710
01:15:48,369 --> 01:15:50,546
Those were her words.

711
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:53,723
You know how she has
that way of talking.

712
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:56,552
That doesn't mean
she's in love with me.

713
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:01,426
Besides, I didn't say
she was in love with you.

714
01:16:01,513 --> 01:16:04,298
I said a little crush,
just a little crush.

715
01:16:10,174 --> 01:16:14,613
If you were going to have a baby,
what would you like,

716
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,049
boy or a girl?

717
01:16:16,528 --> 01:16:18,574
Come on. Play with me.

718
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:29,236
I don't wanna
have a baby.

719
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:31,412
Every woman
wants a baby.I don't.

720
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:33,589
Chris.

721
01:16:35,503 --> 01:16:37,462
I don't want one,
boy or girl.

722
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:41,466
A boy would be great.

723
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:45,165
Sebastian. Sebastiano.

724
01:16:46,993 --> 01:16:48,865
Do you like that name?

725
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,826
Do you have favorite names
for boys? No.

726
01:16:53,913 --> 01:16:57,613
Don't be such a party pooper.

727
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,659
Come on. I won't
hold you to anything.

728
01:17:37,914 --> 01:17:39,350
Chris,

729
01:17:41,178 --> 01:17:43,136
go to sleep, please.

730
01:17:44,268 --> 01:17:45,661
I'm all right.

731
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:49,665
Baby...

732
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:56,454
Tell me about the time
when we first met.

733
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:02,503
What do you mean?

734
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:05,593
You know,
at that party...

735
01:18:06,769 --> 01:18:08,379
When we first spoke.

736
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:13,863
What about it?

737
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:16,256
I just want to know
how it was.

738
01:18:17,344 --> 01:18:19,695
You were there.Remind me.

739
01:18:27,528 --> 01:18:31,097
I didn't wanna go.

740
01:18:33,534 --> 01:18:36,712
Claire talked me into it,
and I went as a butterfly.

741
01:18:38,235 --> 01:18:40,498
And you were there
with Vicky.

742
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,414
And you were Thumbelina.

743
01:18:44,981 --> 01:18:47,592
And you were wearing your clogs and your fish earrings,

744
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,681
and you smelled
of patchouli.

745
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,295
Vicky was Rumpelstiltskin.

746
01:18:59,691 --> 01:19:06,480
And you said that you'd seen me before at Frieda's or...

747
01:19:09,527 --> 01:19:14,010
And while we talked,
Vicky said nothing.

748
01:19:16,099 --> 01:19:17,796
And she just kept
looking at me,

749
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:19,885
and she made me
uncomfortable.

750
01:19:19,972 --> 01:19:22,366
So I said that I wanted to go to the bar to get a drink.

751
01:19:22,453 --> 01:19:25,804
And... And you followed me.

752
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:32,506
I remember that blind girl
was playin' on the piano.

753
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:35,727
And at the bar,
you introduced me to that woman, Grace,

754
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:37,729
film director.

755
01:19:40,906 --> 01:19:44,344
That was the first time
I heard you say my name.

756
01:19:47,173 --> 01:19:49,045
"Christine."

757
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:57,096
And, uh,
she was Mother Goose.

758
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:00,012
And she had that huge tattoo
on her chest.

759
01:20:00,099 --> 01:20:03,711
It was...
It was like an exterminating angel or something,

760
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,671
and she asked us
if we were a couple.

761
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:12,416
And I blushed.
Remember?

762
01:20:14,287 --> 01:20:17,638
And you... you laughed.

763
01:20:17,725 --> 01:20:23,383
You said, "Oh, no, no. We've just met,
but I have my designs on her."

764
01:20:25,995 --> 01:20:30,782
That's what you said,
that you had designs on me.

765
01:20:33,785 --> 01:20:36,048
And that woman...

766
01:20:36,135 --> 01:20:40,313
Remember?
She... She had three daughters with different men,

767
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,098
and she had just had
her tubes untied

768
01:20:42,185 --> 01:20:45,318
and was looking for a man
to inseminate her.

769
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:46,754
Remember?

770
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:53,326
And then Vicky walked over
and started interrogating me,

771
01:20:53,413 --> 01:20:54,893
but I didn't care
at this point

772
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,591
'cause I was
already drunk a little bit.

773
01:20:59,115 --> 01:21:00,333
And...

774
01:21:02,074 --> 01:21:05,643
I just wanted her to leave
so I could be alone with you.

775
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:12,780
And then?

776
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:19,135
I drove you home.

777
01:21:20,223 --> 01:21:21,877
You know what.

778
01:21:24,836 --> 01:21:25,750
What?

779
01:21:31,147 --> 01:21:32,583
We kissed.

780
01:21:37,196 --> 01:21:38,676
Good night.

781
01:21:54,822 --> 01:21:55,998
Good night.

782
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:12,884
Hey, sis? Yeah?

783
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:16,192
God talks to Adam and says, "Adam,
I have the perfect mate for you,

784
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:18,498
"but it's gonna cost you
an arm and a leg."

785
01:22:18,585 --> 01:22:21,197
Adam thinks about it and replies,
"What can you give me for a rib?"

786
01:22:21,284 --> 01:22:24,330
That's good.
Where'd you hear it?

787
01:22:25,897 --> 01:22:27,290
It's in the Bible.

788
01:22:40,216 --> 01:22:41,391
Hey, sis.

789
01:22:41,478 --> 01:22:42,958
Hi.

790
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:48,093
What are you reading?

791
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,139
Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus.

792
01:22:50,226 --> 01:22:51,662
When did that
come out in Braille?

793
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:53,490
Last week.
It's wonderful.

794
01:22:53,577 --> 01:22:56,058
It is changing
my whole outlook.

795
01:22:56,145 --> 01:22:58,016
I'll never make
the same mistakes, ever.

796
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:00,801
Really? What mistakes
are those?

797
01:23:00,888 --> 01:23:03,065
Being a woman
who loves too much.

798
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:05,632
Choosing the wrong man,
then trying to change him.

799
01:23:05,719 --> 01:23:08,635
Not accepting myself
for who I am.

800
01:23:08,722 --> 01:23:12,030
Doing all the things women do
to ruin their lives.

801
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:12,988
Nice try.

802
01:23:14,554 --> 01:23:16,687
It's 100 years
of solitude.

803
01:23:17,862 --> 01:23:19,907
So how was your day
in the asphalt jungle?

804
01:23:23,389 --> 01:23:25,087
A woman I knew
killed herself.

805
01:23:25,174 --> 01:23:27,437
Shit. Who?

806
01:23:27,524 --> 01:23:30,483
You don't know her.
Carmen Alba?

807
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:32,616
We were in
high school together.

808
01:23:32,703 --> 01:23:34,313
I haven't seen her
for 18 years.

809
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,098
I didn't know her very well
back then either.

810
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:37,969
How'd she do it?

811
01:23:38,056 --> 01:23:40,276
She turned on the gas
and went to sleep.

812
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:43,888
I bet you could tell just by looking at her there's a man involved.

813
01:23:43,975 --> 01:23:45,194
There's no one yet.

814
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:47,413
I bet he ran for cover.

815
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,893
How was your day?

816
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,634
Sylvia came down
with a cold,

817
01:23:50,721 --> 01:23:53,115
so they called me in
to teach one of her pupils.

818
01:23:53,202 --> 01:23:55,595
It's a little girl,
quick as a whip.

819
01:23:56,466 --> 01:23:59,425
Terrific reader.
Father separated.

820
01:23:59,512 --> 01:24:03,429
Hit on me right away.
Going out on a date tomorrow night.

821
01:24:03,516 --> 01:24:05,127
Where is he taking you?

822
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:06,867
To a concert.

823
01:24:06,954 --> 01:24:09,000
Maybe he'll take me
to see Ray Charles.

824
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:14,658
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting, Detective.

825
01:24:14,745 --> 01:24:16,529
I'm afraid we're
running a little behind.

826
01:24:16,616 --> 01:24:17,965
Shall we?

827
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:38,508
There's a little ink on this finger.
Did she leave a note?

828
01:24:38,595 --> 01:24:40,075
Haven't found one.

829
01:24:43,426 --> 01:24:46,646
She has a mild burn here.
Waxing, maybe?

830
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:54,567
Could be a combo of gas
and pills.

831
01:24:56,047 --> 01:24:58,397
Any reason to think
it wasn't suicide?

832
01:24:58,484 --> 01:25:00,007
No. Not really.

833
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:03,141
I just wanted to be sure.

834
01:25:04,142 --> 01:25:05,187
Did you know her?

835
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:14,109
She once had a C-section.

836
01:25:16,415 --> 01:25:20,854
I'll take a closer look at her,
but she's not gonna tell us all of her secrets.

837
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,031
Okey-dokey, Detective.

838
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,033
If I find anything unusual,
I'll let you know right away.

839
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,123
Yes. Thank you.

840
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:46,271
Hey, sis? Yeah?

841
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:48,882
Will you do the honors?

842
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:54,018
I'm at your mercy.
You can make me into a slut...

843
01:25:54,105 --> 01:25:57,239
Or Mother Teresa of Calcutta,
the future saint.

844
01:25:57,326 --> 01:25:58,805
I don't think Mother Teresa
wore makeup.

845
01:25:58,892 --> 01:26:00,111
She should've.

846
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,158
Lips.What color?

847
01:26:03,245 --> 01:26:05,160
Autumn.Uh-uh. Black lily.

848
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:11,209
I gotta get that lipstick that doesn't smear the glass when you drink.

849
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:13,211
Is he taking you out
to dinner as well?

850
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:16,649
He wants to,
but he's not ready for my table manners.

851
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:18,782
Well, his daughter is blind.
I'm sure he's understanding.

852
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,700
His daughter and a woman
are not the same thing.

853
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:26,485
First, I have to approve
his bedroom manners.

854
01:26:26,572 --> 01:26:32,230
Endurance, perseverance,
spirit of sacrifice.

855
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:35,755
That's from Amy Vanderbilt's
Complete Book of Etiquette.

856
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:39,585
We're just gonna have a drink after the concert.

857
01:26:39,672 --> 01:26:44,155
Eyes.Hmm.

858
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:49,160
Nope. No one
claimed the body.

859
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:50,596
Yeah. I smell a rat.

860
01:26:50,683 --> 01:26:53,077
What makes you so sure
there's a man?

861
01:26:53,164 --> 01:26:56,298
I'm not sure of anything,
but you know how I love the worst-case scenario.

862
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:00,737
Find any photographs?

863
01:27:00,824 --> 01:27:03,174
No. No photographs at all
in the house.

864
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:06,612
How coy. Did you
check the garbage?

865
01:27:06,699 --> 01:27:08,745
All the trash cans
are empty.Mmm.

866
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:11,051
Address book? There wasn't one.

867
01:27:11,138 --> 01:27:12,096
Glass slipper?

868
01:27:14,838 --> 01:27:16,840
You're done.

869
01:27:16,927 --> 01:27:21,061
Do you think it's an option for a blind girl to get plastic surgery?

870
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:23,150
How are my nails?

871
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:26,632
They're good.

872
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:35,337
I would be lost
without you, sis.

873
01:27:36,773 --> 01:27:38,992
That's my boy.
Can you get it?

874
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:40,342
I gotta go pee.

875
01:27:40,429 --> 01:27:42,518
Yeah.
What's his name, anyway?

876
01:27:42,605 --> 01:27:44,824
Walter.
Can you believe that?

877
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:49,133
Hi.Hi.

878
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:52,179
I'm Walter. Hi.I'm Carol's sister.

879
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,443
I'm sorry. Carol didn't
tell me your name.

880
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:56,488
I'm Kathy.

881
01:27:56,575 --> 01:27:57,489
Oh. Nice to meet you.Carol's gonna be out
in a minute.

882
01:27:57,576 --> 01:27:58,838
Thanks.

883
01:28:01,667 --> 01:28:04,757
Uh, Carol tells me you have a beautiful daughter.
And smart.

884
01:28:04,844 --> 01:28:07,717
Yes, and funny,
but don't get me started. I'll bore you.

885
01:28:07,804 --> 01:28:09,153
Hi.Hi.

886
01:28:10,023 --> 01:28:11,329
You look great.

887
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:12,809
Thanks. So do y...

888
01:28:12,896 --> 01:28:15,159
You almost had me there.

889
01:28:16,029 --> 01:28:17,292
How's he look, sis?

890
01:28:17,379 --> 01:28:19,381
Looks good.Yeah?

891
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:21,034
Handsome? Mmm-hmm.

892
01:28:22,471 --> 01:28:26,562
Mmm.
You smell good too.

893
01:28:26,649 --> 01:28:30,348
Let me get my cane,
just in case Walter needs it to beat me.

894
01:28:31,828 --> 01:28:34,352
And we are on our way.

895
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:35,658
See you later, sis.

896
01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:36,702
Bye.Nice to meet you, Kathy.

897
01:28:36,789 --> 01:28:38,965
Yes.

898
01:28:39,052 --> 01:28:40,924
If you'd like to join us later after the concert,
that'd be great.

899
01:28:41,011 --> 01:28:42,926
Nope. Kathy would rather
watch television.

900
01:28:44,231 --> 01:28:46,233
Bye.

901
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,323
Bye-bye.

902
01:29:36,153 --> 01:29:38,416
Hello, Detective.
I was just gonna call you

903
01:29:38,503 --> 01:29:40,070
with the result
of the lady's autopsy.

904
01:29:40,157 --> 01:29:43,334
Oh. Thank you. Did you
find anything unusual?

905
01:29:43,421 --> 01:29:45,075
Well, she did take sleeping pills,
just as we imagined.

906
01:29:45,162 --> 01:29:47,294
She did?

907
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,252
Yes, I'm afraid she took enough pills to put a horse to sleep.

908
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,300
I... I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be laughing.

909
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:55,085
No, it's my fault.

910
01:29:55,172 --> 01:29:57,392
It's a ridiculous thing
to say. Please forgive me.

911
01:29:57,479 --> 01:29:59,481
Oh, no, no. Please.
Don't worry about it.

912
01:29:59,568 --> 01:30:02,222
Um, thank you
for telling me.

913
01:30:02,309 --> 01:30:03,963
Thank you very much.

914
01:30:10,753 --> 01:30:13,886
It's definitely one of ours,
but I can't release any information.

915
01:30:13,973 --> 01:30:16,062
I'm sorry, Detective.
That's the law.

916
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:19,675
Can you at least tell me if Carmen Alba ever had a baby in this hospital?

917
01:30:19,762 --> 01:30:21,938
What good would
that do you?

918
01:30:22,504 --> 01:30:25,332
I'm a friend of Carmen's.

919
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,814
If she has a son or daughter,
I'd like to find them.

920
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:36,866
I don't envy you the task
of having to tell a child

921
01:30:36,953 --> 01:30:39,259
that their mother
committed suicide.

922
01:30:39,346 --> 01:30:41,348
Do you know
why she did it?

923
01:30:44,482 --> 01:30:49,574
Ah.
Carmen Alba had a baby girl in this hospital in 1989.

924
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:53,448
The baby
died the following day.

925
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,541
So there is no child? No.

926
01:30:59,628 --> 01:31:02,718
Hmm. So that's that? Yep.

927
01:31:04,589 --> 01:31:06,548
You know, there
might still be someone.

928
01:31:06,635 --> 01:31:08,506
There's no one.

929
01:31:08,593 --> 01:31:10,290
I'm surprised
to hear you say that, sis.

930
01:31:10,377 --> 01:31:12,858
Usually you're a sucker
for hope.

931
01:31:12,945 --> 01:31:16,514
Well, even if I got lucky and found that someone,
it would take time.

932
01:31:16,601 --> 01:31:18,560
The city has
to bury her tomorrow.

933
01:31:18,647 --> 01:31:20,387
What will she wear?

934
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,215
That's not funny.

935
01:31:22,302 --> 01:31:24,696
I'm not trying to be funny.
I'm serious.

936
01:31:24,783 --> 01:31:26,350
What will they
bury the poor woman in?

937
01:31:28,221 --> 01:31:30,397
I have no idea.

938
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,400
Every woman should be buried in a dress made especially for her

939
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,968
by the birds and the mice,
just like Cinderella's.

940
01:31:38,449 --> 01:31:40,538
The whole thing just reeks
of a man, doesn't it?

941
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:42,366
You don't know
her motives.

942
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:43,585
Well, she was a fool.

943
01:31:43,672 --> 01:31:44,977
You're not being
very kind.

944
01:31:45,064 --> 01:31:46,979
She wasn't very kind
to herself.

945
01:31:48,459 --> 01:31:51,114
She threw out all her things
before turning on the gas.

946
01:31:51,201 --> 01:31:52,985
She was discreet.
I'll grant her that.

947
01:31:53,072 --> 01:31:55,205
And the baby's bracelet?

948
01:31:55,292 --> 01:31:57,903
It fell into her shoe while she was going through her things.

949
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:59,209
She never saw it.

950
01:32:00,993 --> 01:32:03,300
You should consider
being a detective.

951
01:32:03,387 --> 01:32:06,433
Well, there was an opening,
but they gave it to a deaf-mute black man.

952
01:32:11,917 --> 01:32:14,529
Where's Walter
taking you tonight?

953
01:32:14,616 --> 01:32:17,270
The lighthouse.What's that?

954
01:32:17,357 --> 01:32:19,229
A watering hole.

955
01:32:19,316 --> 01:32:22,275
You been there before? Yes. They all
take me there.

956
01:32:22,362 --> 01:32:23,929
You never mentioned it.

957
01:32:24,016 --> 01:32:27,106
No? I didn't think
it was your kind of place.

958
01:32:29,718 --> 01:32:32,590
What do you think
is my kind of place?

959
01:32:32,677 --> 01:32:35,158
Who knows, sis?
Who knows?

960
01:32:35,245 --> 01:32:37,595
When you find out,
you let me know.

961
01:32:37,682 --> 01:32:40,337
Every girl must find
her own little way.

962
01:32:40,903 --> 01:32:42,731
I'll keep you posted.

963
01:32:42,818 --> 01:32:44,036
Why? Did you meet someone?

964
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:45,429
No.

965
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:51,174
See you later, sis.

966
01:32:51,261 --> 01:32:53,480
Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

967
01:33:21,508 --> 01:33:23,728
Carol? Carol?

968
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:26,601
Walter?

969
01:33:26,688 --> 01:33:27,732
Open the door.

970
01:33:28,428 --> 01:33:30,256
Is that you?

971
01:33:30,343 --> 01:33:33,216
I'm done for the night.Oh, that's very funny.

972
01:33:33,303 --> 01:33:35,522
My sister's
down the hall.Open the door.

973
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,613
Carol? Carol?
That's enough.

974
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,615
You'd be
doing her a favor.

975
01:33:40,702 --> 01:33:44,009
Oh. Listen,
if you don't...

976
01:33:49,928 --> 01:33:51,321
Drop me off
at the coffee place.

977
01:33:51,408 --> 01:33:53,149
I'll walk back
and read in the park.

978
01:33:53,236 --> 01:33:56,456
Okay.Only the blind and homeless
walk in this city.

979
01:33:56,543 --> 01:33:58,763
How was your date? It was good.

980
01:33:59,808 --> 01:34:00,896
Hope we didn't
make too much noise.

981
01:34:00,983 --> 01:34:03,072
No. I slept right through.

982
01:34:03,159 --> 01:34:07,032
He's a good boy. Little possessive,
but he's all right.

983
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:09,034
And his manners?

984
01:34:09,121 --> 01:34:10,688
They were good, sis.

985
01:34:10,775 --> 01:34:13,560
Real good.
Thanks for asking.

986
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:16,738
Is he taking you out
to dinner? Yeah.

987
01:34:16,825 --> 01:34:19,697
I told him to pick me up
tomorrow night at 7:00.

988
01:34:25,703 --> 01:34:28,663
Hello, this
is Detective Faber. Yes?

989
01:34:29,794 --> 01:34:32,579
Yes. Hello.
Um, fine, thank you.

990
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:35,539
What can I do for you?
Uh-huh.

991
01:34:39,761 --> 01:34:43,112
Okay.

992
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:47,594
No, no. It's just that I was working,
and you took me by surprise.

993
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,772
Tomorrow's fine. No.
That's not necessary.

994
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:52,817
I can meet you anywhere.

995
01:34:53,862 --> 01:34:57,169
All right. Thank you.

996
01:34:57,648 --> 01:34:59,302
How about 7:00?

997
01:35:00,129 --> 01:35:03,915
1124 Carmelina
in Valley Village.

998
01:35:04,002 --> 01:35:07,832
Uh, no. Hold on.
Better make it 8:00. Is that all right?

999
01:35:10,661 --> 01:35:12,663
Okay. Bye.

1000
01:36:05,324 --> 01:36:07,849
"Just as the door opened,

1001
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:11,635
"a gust of wind picked up
the little paper dancer

1002
01:36:11,722 --> 01:36:17,249
"and blew her
into the stove.

1003
01:36:18,903 --> 01:36:22,472
"The maid was
cleaning out the oven

1004
01:36:22,559 --> 01:36:29,784
"and found him
in the shape of a heart.

1005
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:33,700
That was very good, June.

1006
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,834
Did you know that coal miners used to keep canaries underground?

1007
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:38,618
That way they could tell
if there were gas leaks,

1008
01:36:38,705 --> 01:36:40,838
because the canaries
would die.

1009
01:36:40,925 --> 01:36:42,753
No. I didn't know that.

1010
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,800
My dad told me that.
He likes you.

1011
01:36:45,887 --> 01:36:49,064
I could tell right away.
It's the way he talked to you.

1012
01:36:49,151 --> 01:36:51,893
He uses that tone when he meets a woman he likes.

1013
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:56,723
He speaks slowly and agrees
with everything she says.

1014
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:59,074
He does that with you.
Have you noticed?

1015
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,467
No. I haven't noticed.

1016
01:37:01,554 --> 01:37:03,818
Do you think he'll ask you out on a date?

1017
01:37:03,905 --> 01:37:06,821
I don't know, June.
You might wanna ask him.

1018
01:37:06,908 --> 01:37:08,910
He asked you out already.
Is that it?

1019
01:37:08,997 --> 01:37:11,173
Would it bother you
if he had?

1020
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:15,046
Only if you accepted,
but I don't think there's any real danger.

1021
01:37:15,133 --> 01:37:18,745
He's still in love with mom,
and nothing's going to change that.

1022
01:37:19,964 --> 01:37:21,705
Do you live alone?

1023
01:37:21,792 --> 01:37:23,011
No. I live
with my sister.

1024
01:37:23,098 --> 01:37:24,882
Where does she work?

1025
01:37:24,969 --> 01:37:26,884
She's a detective.

1026
01:37:26,971 --> 01:37:29,713
That's cool.
Is she single like you?

1027
01:37:30,975 --> 01:37:32,498
Yes.

1028
01:37:32,585 --> 01:37:36,720
She's not blind, of course.
Why isn't she married?

1029
01:37:36,807 --> 01:37:39,462
I guess she just hasn't
found the right man yet.

1030
01:37:39,549 --> 01:37:43,161
Maybe she didn't wanna leave you all alone.
Is that it?

1031
01:37:43,248 --> 01:37:45,424
That would be wrong,
of course.

1032
01:37:45,511 --> 01:37:47,949
I think a blind person is perfectly capable of living on her own.

1033
01:37:48,036 --> 01:37:49,167
Don't you?

1034
01:37:51,778 --> 01:37:54,694
I didn't wanna be nosy
about you and my dad,

1035
01:37:54,781 --> 01:37:58,176
but if he hasn't asked you out,
it's for the better.

1036
01:37:58,263 --> 01:38:04,530
He's usually all lovey-dovey with them at first,
then he drops 'em like a hot potato.

1037
01:38:04,617 --> 01:38:07,882
"Like a hot potato."
Isn't that a funny expression?

1038
01:38:59,455 --> 01:39:03,024
What happened, Carol?
I thought you said he was picking you up at 7:00.

1039
01:39:03,111 --> 01:39:07,550
No. 8:00.
What time is it?

1040
01:39:07,637 --> 01:39:10,640
It's five to 8:00.
I thought you said 7:00.

1041
01:39:13,121 --> 01:39:14,949
Are you going out?

1042
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:16,907
Yeah.

1043
01:39:16,994 --> 01:39:20,084
Vera called.
We're gonna go out for a bite.

1044
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:22,565
How is Vera?

1045
01:39:22,652 --> 01:39:25,133
She's... She's good,
I think.

1046
01:39:26,308 --> 01:39:28,049
I haven't really talked
to her for a while.

1047
01:39:28,136 --> 01:39:29,964
On the phone,
she seemed a little down.

1048
01:39:30,703 --> 01:39:32,792
Why?
What's the matter?

1049
01:39:32,879 --> 01:39:36,013
Um, I don't know.
Problems with her husband, I think.

1050
01:39:38,059 --> 01:39:40,235
I've been thinking some more
about your friend Carmen.

1051
01:39:41,888 --> 01:39:45,849
Maybe she found
the love of her life,

1052
01:39:47,242 --> 01:39:49,505
and they had a child.

1053
01:39:49,592 --> 01:39:51,550
But after the baby died,

1054
01:39:52,943 --> 01:39:55,902
they were incapable
of consoling one another.

1055
01:39:58,383 --> 01:40:01,038
The burden was too much
to carry alone...

1056
01:40:03,084 --> 01:40:05,608
And impossible to share.

1057
01:40:05,695 --> 01:40:07,305
It tore them apart.

1058
01:40:10,134 --> 01:40:14,008
So Carmen moved away to a kinder place away from here,

1059
01:40:14,095 --> 01:40:16,923
but she wasn't able
to rebuild her life.

1060
01:40:19,622 --> 01:40:23,017
So she reached out
to the father of her child.

1061
01:40:25,802 --> 01:40:28,196
They talked on the phone
for months,

1062
01:40:29,327 --> 01:40:32,548
but she was...
she was terrified of hope.

1063
01:40:32,635 --> 01:40:35,072
It took her a long time
to build up the courage

1064
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,161
to meet with him
face to face.

1065
01:40:38,336 --> 01:40:47,128
Finally, she returned
to Los Angeles

1066
01:40:48,999 --> 01:40:53,134
She moved into that house,
prepared for the big night.

1067
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:58,052
But the evening,
it went badly.

1068
01:40:58,139 --> 01:41:03,535
Or what's worse, it went well at first,
then it went badly.

1069
01:41:06,843 --> 01:41:09,933
At the end of the night,
it was clear to her

1070
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:15,808
that nothing she could do
could revive that baby,

1071
01:41:17,245 --> 01:41:18,855
or their love,

1072
01:41:20,465 --> 01:41:23,773
or kill the pain...

1073
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:26,384
Or do anything
but make her feel alone.

1074
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:33,174
Maybe she left early in the morning while he slept.

1075
01:41:33,261 --> 01:41:36,960
She made up her mind about her future on that long walk home.

1076
01:41:39,484 --> 01:41:41,138
When she arrived...

1077
01:41:44,272 --> 01:41:46,491
She went through
all of her things

1078
01:41:48,189 --> 01:41:50,104
and threw them out,

1079
01:41:50,191 --> 01:41:54,978
erasing herself quietly
behind closed doors

1080
01:41:57,589 --> 01:42:00,114
like most people
live their lives.

1081
01:42:11,299 --> 01:42:21,135
I was wrong about you being a detective.
You should be a writer.

1082
01:42:25,226 --> 01:42:28,185
I mean, maybe she was
just tired of dead ends.

1083
01:42:29,926 --> 01:42:32,407
Phone calls
that were never returned.

1084
01:42:35,061 --> 01:42:37,107
Promises that were never kept.

1085
01:42:40,632 --> 01:42:42,895
Tripping over the same stone.

1086
01:42:46,290 --> 01:42:48,771
I guess we'll never know
what she was thinking.

1087
01:42:48,858 --> 01:42:51,904
It's just as well.

1088
01:42:53,776 --> 01:42:56,344
These are the things
that can't be shared.

1089
01:43:20,759 --> 01:43:21,978
Becca?

1090
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,899
Becca?

1091
01:43:40,692 --> 01:43:42,868
That's Vera.

1092
01:43:42,955 --> 01:43:46,785
What's the hurry?
Why don't you invite her in? We'll torture her.

1093
01:44:21,037 --> 01:44:22,604
Don't keep her waiting.

1094
01:45:21,010 --> 01:45:22,794
Shh.
