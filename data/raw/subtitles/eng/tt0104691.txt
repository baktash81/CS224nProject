1
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:56,617
Hello!
John Cameron!

2
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:02,155
Alexandra,
Set three more places.

3
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:06,260
- Chingachgook! How are you?

4
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:10,068
The Master of Life
is good, John.

5
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,439
Another year passed.

6
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:18,246
- How is it with you?
- Gettin' along. Yes, I am.

7
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,781
Nathaniel.

8
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,789
Hello, John.

9
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:29,054
- Cleared another quarter, I see.
- Yes, I did.

10
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:32,128
- Alexandra.
- Welcome.

11
00:05:32,196 --> 00:05:34,221
- Jack, how are you?
- Hello, Nathaniel.

12
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,824
- How've you been?
- Good. Thank you.

13
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,062
Where you boys
been trapping?

14
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:41,628
West of
the Continental.

15
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:44,106
Why is Uncas with you?

16
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:48,009
He should have settled with a woman,
started a family by now.

17
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,537
Hey! Hey! Hey, Uncas, look!

18
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:55,575
Mohawk field we saw was
five mile long on the river.

19
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:58,247
- Chief Joseph Brandt's field.
- You take much fur?

20
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,951
- That we did. The horicane's
near trapped-out now. - Lots.

21
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,459
- Where are you tradin' your skins? Castleton?
- Schuylerville.

22
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:05,519
Schuylerville.
With the Dutch, forsilver.

23
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:08,861
French and English
want to pay with wampum and brandy.

24
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,868
So what is it, Jack?
What brings you here?

25
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,737
French and Indian army are headin'
south out of Fort Carillon...

26
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:19,800
to war against
the British,

27
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:23,574
and I'm helpin' raise New York's
militia to fill the Crown's levy.

28
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:29,485
And the people here are
Gonna join in that fight?

29
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:32,250
We'll see in the morning.
Where're you boys headin'?

30
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:35,986
We'll trap over the fall.
Winter in Can-tuck-ee.

31
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,119
Find a Delaware-speaking
woman for Uncas.

32
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:40,994
She will say, "You are the one!"
Bear him many children.

33
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:44,000
Then you can have a boy like me.

34
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:46,468
Never.
You're too strong.

35
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:49,768
- Turn me old too fast.
- That's what he's doin' to his mama.

36
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:11,619
John Cameron,
thank you for your hospitality.

37
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:14,494
Mohawk got no quarrel
with les Francais.

38
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:16,658
Traded furs with
les Francais.

39
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:19,931
Now les Francais
bring Huron, Ottawa,

40
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,302
Abenaki on to Mohawk land.

41
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:26,332
Now Mohawk will fight
les Francais and Huron.

42
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,175
I speak for the Twin Rivers
Mohawk of the Six Nations.

43
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:33,274
His Majesty, King George ll,
is very grateful for your support.

44
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:36,149
- How far up the valley?
- Up to Fort William Henry.

45
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,212
That's two nights
and abit from here.

46
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,283
- Should be enough to remind you that France is our enemy.
- France is you r enemy.

47
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:47,229
And while we're at your fort,
What if the French attack our homes?

48
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:49,630
- What then, Lieutenant?
- For your homes,

49
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,827
for King, for country!

50
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:54,235
That's why you men
Ought to join this fight!

51
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,705
You do what you want
With your owns calp.

52
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:59,641
Do not be tellin' us
What we ought to do with ours.

53
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,043
You call yourself a patriot?
A loyal subject to the Crown?

54
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:06,174
I do not call myself
Subject to much a tall.

55
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:12,814
I agree with some of what
Nathaniel and John say,

56
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,324
but I believe England's
still our sovereign.

57
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:23,934
I'm stayin' on my farm.

58
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:27,437
Any man who goes, his family's welcome
To fort up with us till he comes back.

59
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,439
Boys, my sense of it is...

60
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,772
we have enough here
to fill the county levy,

61
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,903
and it's a fight
we ought to make.

62
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,243
But first we gotta
get terms from GeneraI Webb.

63
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:43,577
We'll go to Albany.

64
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:08,538
Attention!

65
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:11,131
There'll be no conditions attached
To service in the British army.

66
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,575
Help my man outside
with the baggage.

67
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:16,511
If they're not allowed leave
to defend their families and homes...

68
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,515
if the French
attack the settlements,

69
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,642
no colonial militia
is going to Fort William Henry.

70
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:22,948
They will report
or be pressed into service.

71
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,750
- Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear.
- They will be found.

72
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,291
- Where does that leave you?
- Those men will be found.

73
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:31,522
I cannot imagine His Majesty,
in all his benevolence,

74
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:34,793
would ever object to his
loyal American subjects...

75
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,766
defending their hearth and home,
their women and children.

76
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:39,928
Does that mean they
will be granted leave...

77
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:42,905
to defend their homes
if the settlements are attacked?

78
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,965
Of course.

79
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,277
You got yourself
a colonial militia, General.

80
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,122
Major Duncan Heyward
reporting, sir,

81
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,712
enroute to Fort William Henry
and bearing dispatches.

82
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:02,235
en route to Fort William Henry
and bearing dispatches.

83
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:04,240
- Safe journey, I trust?
- Yes.

84
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:07,641
And I didn't experience anything
So surprising from Bristol to Albany...

85
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:09,737
as that that
I witnessed here today.

86
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,748
And what was that?

87
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:15,513
The Crown negotiating
The terms of service.

88
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:19,750
Well, now, one has to reason with these
colonials to get them to do anything.

89
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:22,759
Tiring, isn't it?
But that's the lay of the land.

90
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:28,129
I thought British policy is
"Make the world England," sir.

91
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:42,645
I see you're to serve with the 35th
regiment of foot at Fort William Henry...

92
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:46,114
under Colonel Munro.

93
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:49,778
I'll be marching the 60th
to Fort Edward.

94
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:56,491
Explain to the Major,
he has little to fear...

95
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:01,055
from this General Marquis de Montcalm
in the first place,

96
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:04,568
and therefore scant need
of the colonial militia in the second,

97
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:08,435
because the French
haven't the nature for war.

98
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:11,339
Their Latinate
voluptuousness...

99
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:14,003
combines with their
Gallic laziness,

100
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,946
and the result is, they'd rathereat and
make love with their faces than fight.

101
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:23,518
Might linquire if GeneraI Webb has
Heard from ColoneI Munro's daughters?

102
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:26,648
I was to rendezvous with them in Albany
and escort them to the fort, sir.

103
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:29,921
You there, uh-
What does Munro call you?

104
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:32,428
The Scotsman has sent you...

105
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:35,465
one of his Mohawk allies
to guide you.

106
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:36,966
Magua.

107
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:39,764
The Scotsman's daughters...

108
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:42,135
are at the Poltroon's house.

109
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:45,334
A company of the 60th
will accompany you...

110
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:48,503
and Magua will
show you the way.

111
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:53,016
Dawn. At the encampment,
6:00 a. m. sharp. See to it you're there.

112
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:07,990
I'll take him for you, sir.

113
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,170
Cora.

114
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:17,873
Duncan!

115
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:21,070
- How long have you been in Albany?
- For days and days.

116
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:23,079
- And your self?.
- Just arrived.

117
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:26,707
By God, it's good
to see you.

118
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,694
I don't know
What to say, Duncan.

119
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:43,626
Alice and I have depended upon you
and respected you...

120
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:47,102
since we were
all children.

121
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:53,339
I truly wish they did,
But my feelings don't-

122
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:56,209
don't go beyond friendship.

123
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,281
Don't you see?

124
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:04,315
Respect and friendship-

125
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:07,983
Isn't that a reasonable basis
for a man and a woman to be married?

126
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:11,460
And all else
May grow in time?

127
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,054
- Some say that's the way of it.
- Some?

128
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:17,100
- Cousin Eugenie, my father-
- Well, then, Cora.

129
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:20,035
In my heart I know,
Once we're joined...

130
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:23,505
we'll be the most
marvelous couple in London.

131
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:25,599
I'm certain of that.

132
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:29,009
So why not let those
Whom you trust, your father,

133
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,640
help settle
what's best for you?

134
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:35,015
In view of your indecision,
you should rely on their judgment.

135
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:37,179
And mine.

136
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:41,557
Will you consider that?

137
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:49,165
Please consider that.

138
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:54,370
Yes.

139
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,909
- Yes, I will.
- Duncan!

140
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,878
By God, you've grown up.

141
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:05,381
- We leave in the morning?
- Yes, miss.

142
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:09,613
Is han't sleep tonight. What an
adventure. Have you seen the red man?

143
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:12,722
A few.

144
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,452
I absolutely cannot wait
to return to Portman Square,

145
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:17,460
having been
to the wilderness.

146
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:21,123
- It's so exciting, Duncan.
- Itcan be dangerous.

147
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,032
Nonsense.
Papa wouldn't have sent for us.

148
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:27,662
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, thank you.

149
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,081
Alice?

150
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,753
- Can we rest soon?
- Absolutely.

151
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,332
You there.

152
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:33,126
Scout, we must stop soon.

153
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:35,468
- Women are tired.
- Not here.

154
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:38,770
Two leagues. Better water.
We stop there.

155
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:40,777
No, stop in the
glade just ahead.

156
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:43,336
When the ladies are rested
we will proceed. Do you understand?

157
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:53,857
Excuse me.
What did you say?

158
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:59,359
Magua said,
understand English very well.

159
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:11,451
Make ready! Aim!

160
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,585
Ready!

161
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:19,000
Aim! Flank right!

162
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,509
Aah!

163
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,214
No, Duncan.

164
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:23,917
In case your aim's
any better than your judgment.

165
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,427
Aah!

166
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:42,842
Your wounded should try
walkin' on back to Albany.

167
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:45,641
They'll never make
a passage north.

168
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:47,909
- Ahh!
- Stop it! Stop it!

169
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:50,577
- We need them to get out!
- Why' she loosing the horses?

170
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:53,678
- Why don't you ask him?
- Too easy to track.

171
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:55,950
They'll be heard
for miles.

172
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,958
Find your self a musket.

173
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,824
We were headed
to Fort William Henry.

174
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:15,538
We'll take you
as far as the fort.

175
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:20,809
We're walkin'
Out of here fast.

176
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:31,650
Unless all of you'd rather wait for
The next Huron war party to come by.

177
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,135
Scout, I'd like to
Thank you for your help.

178
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:52,469
- How much further is it?
- Night and a bit.

179
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,475
- Appears we're well away from them.
- Maybe.

180
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:59,343
Maybe they ain't alone.
That Huron captain back there-

181
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:01,279
The guide? He's a Mohawk.

182
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:03,613
No Mohawk. He's Huron.

183
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:06,119
What reason did he have
to murder the girl?

184
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:08,985
- What?
- The dark-haired one.

185
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:12,026
Miss Cora Munro? Murder her?

186
00:24:12,093 --> 00:24:15,529
He never set eyes on her before today.
She's only been here a week.

187
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:18,031
Blood vengeance?
A reproach or insult?

188
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:20,226
Of course not!

189
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:22,735
How is it
you were so nearby?

190
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:25,238
Came across the war party.
Tracked 'em.

191
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:27,672
Then you're assigned
to Fort William Henry?

192
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:31,508
- Nope.
- Fort Edward then?

193
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:34,309
Headin' west to Can-tuck-ee.

194
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:37,818
There is a waron.
How is it you are heading west?

195
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:44,683
Well, we kind of face to the north,
and real sudden-like, turn left.

196
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,889
I though tall our colonial scouts
were in the militia.

197
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:51,397
The militia is fighting
the French in the north!

198
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:56,130
I ain't your scout.
And we sure ain't in no damn militia.

199
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:10,337
Ottawa, two Francais.

200
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:12,669
What did you say?

201
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:15,709
Mirrors,

202
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:19,975
tools, the clothes.

203
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:22,278
Everything was inside.

204
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,284
They didn't take anything.

205
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:27,150
They were movin' fast.

206
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:29,155
A war party.

207
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:32,079
Let us look after them.

208
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:35,941
Leave them.

209
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:38,451
Who ever they are,
though they're strangers,

210
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,953
they're at least entitled
to a Christian burial.

211
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:43,456
- They can't be left behind.
- Let us go, miss.

212
00:27:43,524 --> 00:27:46,789
I will not!
I've seen the face of war before, sir,

213
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:49,352
but I've not seen war
made upon women and children.

214
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,365
Nor most as cruel
as your indifference.

215
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:06,769
Miss Munro,

216
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:09,475
they're not strangers.

217
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:14,153
And theystayasthey lay.

218
00:29:13,147 --> 00:29:15,707
Why didn't you
bury these people?

219
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:18,217
Anyone looking for our trail
would see it as a sign...

220
00:29:18,285 --> 00:29:20,719
we passed that way.

221
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:26,284
You knew them well?

222
00:29:34,835 --> 00:29:38,862
You were acting for our benefit,
and I apologize.

223
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:41,339
I misunderstood you.

224
00:29:41,408 --> 00:29:43,968
Well, that's to be expected.

225
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:47,775
- My father warned me about-
- Your father?

226
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:50,339
Chingachgook.
He warned me about people like you.

227
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:52,408
Oh, he did?

228
00:30:34,662 --> 00:30:37,096
- No.

229
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:55,715
Why did they turn back?

230
00:30:55,783 --> 00:30:57,717
Burial ground.

231
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:10,090
Where is your real family?

232
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:14,833
They buried my ma and pa
and my sisters.

233
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:18,497
Chingachgook found me with two French
trappers, raised me up as his own.

234
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:22,008
I'm sorry.

235
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:26,035
I do not remember.
I wasn't but one or two.

236
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:29,014
How did you
learn English?

237
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:32,280
My father sent Uncas and I to Reverend
Whee lock's school when I wasten...

238
00:31:32,353 --> 00:31:34,787
sowe would know
both worlds.

239
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:42,460
Why were those people living
in this defenseless place?

240
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:50,132
After seven years indentured service
in Virginia, they headed out here...

241
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:53,765
'cause the frontier's the only land
available to poor people.

242
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:57,038
Out here they're
be holden to none,

243
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:59,739
not livin'
by another's leave.

244
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:06,282
Their name was Cameron.

245
00:32:07,922 --> 00:32:10,356
John and Alexandra Cameron.

246
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:39,216
My father's people say that
at the birth of the sun...

247
00:32:39,286 --> 00:32:43,586
and of his brother the moon,
their mother died.

248
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,921
So the sun gave
to the earth her body,

249
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:49,053
from which was
to spring all life.

250
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:53,122
And he drew forth from
her breast the stars.

251
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,136
The stars he threw into the night sky
to remind him ofher soul.

252
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:06,475
So there's
the Camerons' monument.

253
00:33:09,717 --> 00:33:12,151
My folks' too, I guess.

254
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:27,132
You are right, Mr. Poe.

255
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:30,261
We do not understand
what is happening here.

256
00:33:30,337 --> 00:33:32,498
And it's not
as I imagined it would be,

257
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:34,734
thinking of it
in Boston and London.

258
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:38,266
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- No, on the contrary.

259
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:41,314
It is more deeply
Stirring to my blood...

260
00:33:43,951 --> 00:33:46,818
than any imagining
could possibly have been.

261
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:30,791
Top of the next ridge.
The fort's down hill of it.

262
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:35,934
The men of the regiment
will fetch water from the lake,

263
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:39,632
build fires, and provide
every comfort and desire.

264
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:44,674
I can't wait to see Papa.

265
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:02,943
Aah!

266
00:36:48,894 --> 00:36:50,828
Fire!

267
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:19,317
Fire!

268
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:23,226
Aah!

269
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:42,412
Aah!

270
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:50,105
Open up.

271
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:53,048
- I'm Major Duncan Heyward.
- Captain Jeffrey Beams.

272
00:38:53,118 --> 00:38:56,383
- Didn't expect you to make it through.
- Let's go to Munro.

273
00:39:12,504 --> 00:39:15,132
Hello, boys!

274
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:18,835
- Nathaniel!

275
00:39:21,146 --> 00:39:23,979
Uncas! Thought you and
Nathaniel weren't joinin' up.

276
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:25,641
We didn't.

277
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:32,320
Papa! Papa!

278
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,553
Alice! Cora!
Why are you here?

279
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:38,391
And where the hell
are my reinforcements?

280
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,734
Get Mr. Phelps.

281
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:50,474
Told you to stay away.
Why did you disobey me, girls?

282
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:53,170
- When? How? I-
- My letter.

283
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:56,236
- There was none. There was no letter.
- What?

284
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:59,249
- I sent three couriers to Webb.
- One called Magua arrived.

285
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:02,878
- He delivered no message.
- Does Webb not even know we are besieged?

286
00:40:02,954 --> 00:40:06,481
Sir, Webb has no idea. And he certainly
does not know to send reinforcements.

287
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,101
What happened to you?

288
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:21,866
- On the George Road. Attacked.
- We're fine.

289
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,874
Are you all right?

290
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:27,343
- Yes.
- What will happen here, Papa?

291
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:30,347
- We'll be all right, girl.
- This Magua led us in to it.

292
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:34,511
Eighteen killed. These men came
to our aid. They guided us here.

293
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,955
Thank you.
Do you need anything?

294
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:46,122
- Help our selves to a few horns from your powder stores.
- Some food.

295
00:40:46,197 --> 00:40:48,188
Indebted to you.

296
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:55,933
- Miss Cora, how are you?
- Hello, Mr. Phelps.

297
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:58,271
Mrs. McCann will get some
Dry clothes for you.

298
00:40:58,343 --> 00:41:00,470
Thank you.

299
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:04,208
Go with your sister,
Alice.

300
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,283
It'll be all right,
girl.

301
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:12,619
It'll be all right.

302
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,004
Might I inquire after
the situation, sir,

303
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:31,803
given that I've seen the French
engineering from the ridge above?

304
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:35,835
The situation is, his guns are bigger
than mine and he has more of them.

305
00:41:35,914 --> 00:41:39,907
We keep our heads down while his
troops dig 30yards of trench a day.

306
00:41:39,984 --> 00:41:42,509
When those trenches are 200yards
from the fort and within range,

307
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:45,021
he'll bring in
his 15-inch mortars,

308
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:48,820
lob explosive rounds
Over our walls and pound us to dust.

309
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:51,361
They look to be
300 yards out.

310
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:54,398
If they're digging 30yards a day,
you have three days.

311
00:41:54,465 --> 00:41:57,161
Damn. Damn.

312
00:41:57,235 --> 00:42:00,762
This man here can make a run
Straight through to Webb.

313
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:03,864
Three days is not enough time to get
To Albany and back with reinforcements.

314
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:08,675
Webb's not in Albany. He marched
the 60th to Fort Edward two days ago.

315
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:11,146
Webb is at Edward?

316
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:13,946
- Yes, sir.
- That's only 12 miles away.

317
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:16,680
He could have reinforcements here
the day after tomorrow.

318
00:42:16,754 --> 00:42:19,985
You, sir, pick your man.
Major Heyward will provide adiversion.

319
00:42:20,058 --> 00:42:24,154
I'll draft outadis patch. Captain Beams
will seek you out And give it to you later.

320
00:42:24,229 --> 00:42:28,359
Somethin' else.
Cameron's cabin. Frontier cabin.

321
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:32,563
Came upon it yesterday.
It was burnt out, everyone murdered.

322
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:35,401
It was Ottawa,
allied to the French.

323
00:42:39,277 --> 00:42:42,838
Aye. So?

324
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:48,418
It was a war party.

325
00:42:48,486 --> 00:42:52,013
That means they're gonna be attackin'
up and down the frontier.

326
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,717
Thank you, sir.

327
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:57,693
People here- Mohawks, settlers-
have family out there.

328
00:42:57,762 --> 00:43:00,322
That'll be all, sir!

329
00:43:10,942 --> 00:43:14,378
Things were done.
Nobody was spared.

330
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:20,515
Those considerations are subordinate
to the interests of the Crown.

331
00:43:20,585 --> 00:43:23,918
A terrible feature of war here
in the Americas, Major Heyward.

332
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:28,789
Best keep your eye fixed on our duty:
to defeat France.

333
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,556
That hangs on
a courier to Webb.

334
00:43:51,082 --> 00:43:54,518
For my children are the children
Of the true faith.

335
00:43:54,585 --> 00:43:57,418
My friendship and esteem
is boundless.

336
00:43:57,488 --> 00:44:00,821
I will give you
three oxen for a feast.

337
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:04,328
And tomorrow, I will sing
the war song with you...

338
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:06,920
at the great council fire.

339
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:24,862
Magua, how are things
with your English friends?

340
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:29,173
We're at one. Join us.

341
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,245
Hear what he
has to tell us.

342
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:38,472
The English
war chief, Webb,

343
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,178
goes to Fort Edward
with 60th Regiment.

344
00:44:41,253 --> 00:44:46,020
He does not know that my father's army
attacks Fort William Henry.

345
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:48,150
Magua was successful?

346
00:44:49,761 --> 00:44:52,355
The other two couriers
died in the forest.

347
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:58,368
By now, Munro would know his
dispatch did not get through.

348
00:44:58,437 --> 00:45:01,804
- He'll send another.
- Grey Hair will try.

349
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:06,367
Four or five,
including two women, entered the fort.

350
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:10,472
The Grey Hair's children
were under Magua's knife.

351
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:12,517
They escaped.

352
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,075
They will be
under it again.

353
00:45:15,153 --> 00:45:18,054
Why do you hate
the Grey Hair, Magua?

354
00:45:20,225 --> 00:45:24,855
When the Grey Hair is dead,
Magua will eat his heart.

355
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,330
Before he dies,

356
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:31,028
Magua will put his children
Under the knife...

357
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,367
so the Grey Hair
will know...

358
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:36,032
his seed
is wiped out forever.

359
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,177
Miss Cora.

360
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:50,448
Gentleman lookin' for you.
Miss Munro.

361
00:45:50,522 --> 00:45:52,456
Hello.

362
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,691
May I?

363
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:13,268
- It will seep, and then it's going to draw.
- Thank you, miss.

364
00:46:13,345 --> 00:46:16,610
'Bout done holdin' hands
with Miss Munro?

365
00:46:17,682 --> 00:46:20,310
We got some work to do.

366
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:37,801
What are you
looking at, sir?

367
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:41,799
I'm looking at you, miss.

368
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:21,902
Munro refused to believe
what happened.

369
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,608
He does not even
want to hear it.

370
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:28,676
Well, he's gonna have to.

371
00:47:30,622 --> 00:47:32,556
Get to get her
by the west bastion.

372
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:36,390
Ian, Sharitarish,
Ongewasgone and William.

373
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,531
Tight weave?

374
00:47:43,602 --> 00:47:46,127
Silk.
Another 40 yards.

375
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,201
Fire!

376
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:25,573
Aim! And Fire!

377
00:48:43,094 --> 00:48:47,497
Wheel to the right!
On center! March!

378
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:53,502
- Halt!

379
00:48:53,572 --> 00:48:55,904
- Ready!

380
00:48:57,542 --> 00:49:00,136
Set! Fire!

381
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:23,190
Aah!

382
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,461
And how am I to know
it wasn't a raid by common thieves?

383
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:07,594
The cabin was attacked bya war party
Fighting with the French.

384
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,333
They're sweeping south down the frontier
Attacking farms and Mohawk villages.

385
00:50:11,407 --> 00:50:15,275
- All the men are stuck here.
- I need proof more convincing than this man's opinion...

386
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:18,108
before I weaken the fort's defenses
by releasing the militia.

387
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,672
Chingachgook's of the
same opinion about the raid.

388
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,718
Taken together, that's gospel.

389
00:50:22,785 --> 00:50:25,652
Your fort will stand or fall
depending on Webb's reinforcements,

390
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:27,655
not the presence
of the colonials.

391
00:50:27,723 --> 00:50:30,351
I judge military matters here,
not you.

392
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:33,361
Your judgment is not more important
than their right...

393
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:36,057
under agreement with Webb
to defend their farms and families.

394
00:50:36,132 --> 00:50:39,295
Major Heyward was there. He was
at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.

395
00:50:39,368 --> 00:50:42,997
What exactly did you see, Major?

396
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:52,580
I saw nothing that would lead me to the
conclusion it was other than a raid...

397
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:54,582
by savages bent on thievery.

398
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:58,643
- You're a liar!
- Major!

399
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:01,315
Montcalm is a soldier
and a gentleman, not a butcher.

400
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,951
Easy for you to suppose. It's their women
and children alone on the farms, not yours!

401
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:07,996
- You for get yourself, sir!
- We're not forgettin' Webb's promise.

402
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:11,693
British promises are honored,
and the militia will not be released,

403
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:14,258
because I need more definite proof
than this man's word!

404
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,465
Nathaniel's word's been good on this
frontier a longtime before you got here.

405
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,735
This meeting is over!
The militia stays.

406
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:24,143
Does the rule of English law
no longer govern?

407
00:51:24,213 --> 00:51:26,238
Has it been replaced
by absolutism?

408
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:29,512
If English law cannot be trusted, people
would do better making peace with the French.

409
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:32,247
- That is sedition!
- That is the truth!

410
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:35,882
I'll have you beaten
from this fort.

411
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:40,588
Anyone fomenting on advocating the leaving of
Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition.

412
00:51:40,663 --> 00:51:43,530
Anyone actually caught leaving
will be shot for desertion.

413
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,466
My decision is final!
Get out.

414
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:56,610
- Cora?

415
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:58,738
Shh.

416
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:01,883
I wanted to talk to you.

417
00:52:04,353 --> 00:52:08,722
Talk with Duncan, Cora.
I must manage.

418
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,191
I cannot be
an invalid schoolgirl.

419
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,593
- Alice.
- I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything.

420
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,690
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to-

421
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:24,533
Cora, when we come together back in England
and are married and away from this place,

422
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:27,667
what had to be done and said here
will matter not at all.

423
00:52:27,743 --> 00:52:31,702
- I'm certain of that.
- Duncan, I promised you an answer.

424
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,547
You've complimented me
with your persistence and patience.

425
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:40,885
But the decision I have come to is that
I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes...

426
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:44,187
than to surrender
my own judgment.

427
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,593
Please take this
as my final answer.

428
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:49,654
It must be no.

429
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:53,668
I see.

430
00:53:55,898 --> 00:53:59,163
Yeah, Nathaniel,
but you weren't ever for being here.

431
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,669
That's right. Is a wit
that way then and I see it that way now.

432
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:05,696
Ian, if I had kin in the settlements,
hell be damn sure I'd be long gone.

433
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,437
What do we do about
bein' under Crown law?

434
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:12,709
I believe if they set aside
their la was and when they wish,

435
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,444
their law no longer
has rightful authority over us.

436
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:18,715
All they have over us
then is tyranny.

437
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:23,623
And I will not live under that yoke.
So I will stay here no longer.

438
00:54:23,692 --> 00:54:28,152
Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be
shot, so each man make your own decision.

439
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,824
Those who are goin'
Be backin an hour.

440
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,528
Out the northern
sally-port.

441
00:54:33,602 --> 00:54:37,094
Strike for the eastside of the swamp
Till you clear the French picket line.

442
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:40,301
Head north over the ridge,
then come about south east.

443
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:44,312
Fork left in Little Meadow and you're
free of the outpost and skirmishes.

444
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,974
Should'veskun out of this long ago.

445
00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:51,145
Got no families, Captain.
Figured we'd stay and give a hand.

446
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,088
- I'll cover you from the top of the bastion.
- You're not comin' with us?

447
00:54:55,157 --> 00:54:57,352
I got a reason to stay.

448
00:54:57,426 --> 00:55:00,327
That reason wear a striped skirt
and work in the surgery?

449
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:05,891
It does. No offense, but it's a better
looking reason than you, Jack Winthrop.

450
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:11,600
Push hard, 'cause you gotta Clear the
French outpost By dawn. Good luck, Jack.

451
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:26,286
- Ongewasgone, are you stayin'?
- Yes.

452
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:29,916
- There' stoo many French.
- And so few of us to fight.

453
00:55:29,992 --> 00:55:34,520
Not too many to die. But we've
given our word to our English fathers.

454
00:59:02,037 --> 00:59:04,437
You, sir! As you were!

455
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,473
Stand off.

456
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,713
Take him.

457
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,891
As you were.

458
00:59:45,581 --> 00:59:48,209
He saved us.
We're alive only because of him.

459
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:52,550
The man encouraged the colonials to desert,
in this very room, and in my presence.

460
00:59:52,621 --> 00:59:54,555
- Sir.
- He is guilty of sedition.

461
00:59:54,623 --> 00:59:58,320
He must be tried and hanged like Any other
criminal, regardless Of what he did for my children.

462
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:01,056
But he knew the consequences
and he stayed.

463
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,622
Are those the actions
of a criminal?

464
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,931
- Duncan, do something.
- He knew the penalty for his actions.

465
01:00:08,003 --> 01:00:10,528
He ought to pay
Without sending you to beg.

466
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:14,872
You know he wouldn't send me.
You falsely spoke of what you saw.

467
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,242
What happened at the farm
was as Nathaniel said.

468
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:21,647
But not with enough certainty to
out weigh British interests in this fort.

469
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:24,481
And who empowered these colonials
to pass judgment...

470
01:00:24,553 --> 01:00:27,044
on England's policies
in her own possessions,

471
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:30,285
and to come and go without so much
as a by your leave?

472
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:33,328
They do not live their lives
by your leave!

473
01:00:33,395 --> 01:00:37,832
They hack it out of wilderness with their
own two hands, bearing children along the way.

474
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,734
You are defending him because you've
become infatuated with him!

475
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:48,175
Duncan, you are a man
with a few admirable qualities.

476
01:00:48,243 --> 01:00:51,144
But taken as a whole, I was wrong
to have thought so highly of you.

477
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:53,147
Cora!

478
01:00:56,051 --> 01:01:00,351
Cora, I would do anything
I could to keep you from being hurt.

479
01:01:00,422 --> 01:01:05,052
But this man is guilty of sedition and
subject to military justice and beyond pardon.

480
01:01:05,127 --> 01:01:09,257
Justice? If that's justice,
then the sooner French guns...

481
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:12,664
blow the English army out of America,
the better it will be for the people here.

482
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,670
- You do not know what you're saying!
- I know exactly what I'm saying!

483
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:19,697
And if it is sedition,
then I am guilty of sedition too.

484
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:52,873
They're going to hang you.

485
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:58,179
Why didn't you leave
when you had the chance?

486
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,875
Because what I'm interested in
is right here.

487
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,754
What can I do?

488
01:02:07,823 --> 01:02:10,189
Webb's reinforcements
will arrive or not.

489
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,592
If they do not arrive,
the fort will fall to the French.

490
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:17,098
If that happens,
Stay close to your father.

491
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,100
Stay close to him.

492
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:22,626
The French officers will try to protect
the officers among the English.

493
01:02:22,704 --> 01:02:26,765
- No. I will find you.
- Do not.

494
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:32,713
Promise me.

495
01:02:46,995 --> 01:02:49,930
The whole world's on fire,
isn't it?

496
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,920
Who is it?

497
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:24,254
Remember what I told you.

498
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:27,591
Stay close to your father
and the officers.

499
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:16,377
Colonel Munro,

500
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,243
I have known you
as a gallant antagonist.

501
01:05:19,314 --> 01:05:22,249
I am happy to make
your acquaintance as a friend.

502
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:24,581
And I yours,
Monsieur Le Marquis.

503
01:05:24,653 --> 01:05:26,644
Please accept
My compliments...

504
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:30,123
for the strong and skillful defense
of your fortress.

505
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:34,492
Under the command of a lesser man,
It would have fallen long ago,

506
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:37,555
given the superior numbers
and materials.

507
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:41,069
Chance has allowed me
to array against you.

508
01:05:41,136 --> 01:05:44,936
Monsieur Le Marquis,
I am a soldier, not a diplomat.

509
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:48,520
You called this parlay for a better
reason than an exchange of compliments.

510
01:05:50,756 --> 01:05:55,693
You have already done everything which
is necessary for the honor of your prince.

511
01:05:55,761 --> 01:05:59,697
But now I beg you to listen
to the admonishments of humanity.

512
01:05:59,765 --> 01:06:02,859
I beg you to consider
my terms for your surrender.

513
01:06:02,935 --> 01:06:06,200
Perhaps the general's glass
can reach as far as the Hudson...

514
01:06:06,271 --> 01:06:09,763
and seize the size and eminence
of the army of Webb?

515
01:06:12,411 --> 01:06:16,939
My scouts intercepted
this dispatch intended for you.

516
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,848
Capitan de Bougainville.

517
01:06:19,918 --> 01:06:23,877
"To Colonel Munro.
Sir, I regret to inform you...

518
01:06:23,956 --> 01:06:26,948
that I have no men available
to send to your rescue.

519
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:29,016
It is quite impossible.

520
01:06:29,094 --> 01:06:32,120
I advise you to seek terms
for surrender.

521
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:35,394
I remain.
Jerome Webb at Fort Edward. "

522
01:06:42,841 --> 01:06:47,141
This is the signature of Webb.
And I know the temper of our men.

523
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:51,546
Rather than spend the war in a French prison
hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.

524
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:54,484
- You've had your answer, Monsieur Le Marquis.
- Sir,

525
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:57,351
I beg you not to sign
the death warrant of so many...

526
01:06:57,422 --> 01:07:00,755
until you have listened
to what I have to say.

527
01:07:05,797 --> 01:07:11,167
- Go on.
- None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge.

528
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:15,332
They are free, so long as they
return to England...

529
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:18,035
and fight no more
on this continent,

530
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:21,705
and the civilian militia
return to their farms.

531
01:07:23,482 --> 01:07:26,918
- Their arms?
- They may leave the fortress fully armed.

532
01:07:26,985 --> 01:07:29,715
My colors?

533
01:07:29,788 --> 01:07:32,348
Carry them to England
with pride.

534
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:38,355
Allow me to consult
with my officers.

535
01:07:48,507 --> 01:07:50,441
Webb can burn in hell.

536
01:07:50,509 --> 01:07:54,878
And we'll go back and dig our graves
behind those ramparts.

537
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:58,713
Death and honor
are thought to be the same,

538
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:03,250
but today I have learned
that sometimes they are not.

539
01:08:03,322 --> 01:08:05,256
Sir-

540
01:08:16,768 --> 01:08:22,035
Monsieur Le Marquis, I am deeply touched
by such unusual and unexpected generosity.

541
01:08:23,275 --> 01:08:25,505
My fort is yours
Under the condition...

542
01:08:25,577 --> 01:08:27,841
that I be given till dawn
to bury my dead,

543
01:08:27,913 --> 01:08:31,349
to prepare my men and women
for the long journey ahead...

544
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:33,680
and to hand my wounded
over to your surgeons.

545
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,421
Granted, monsieur.

546
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,833
Is the hatchet buried between
the English and my French father?

547
01:09:10,903 --> 01:09:14,168
- Yes.
- Not a warrior has a scalp...

548
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,572
and the white men
become friends.

549
01:09:16,642 --> 01:09:19,008
My master
owns these lands...

550
01:09:19,078 --> 01:09:23,014
and I have been ordered to drive off
the English squatters.

551
01:09:23,082 --> 01:09:25,414
They have consented
to go,

552
01:09:25,484 --> 01:09:27,748
so now I call them
enemies no longer.

553
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:32,120
Magua took the hatchet
to color with blood.

554
01:09:32,191 --> 01:09:34,125
It's still bright.

555
01:09:34,193 --> 01:09:37,185
Only when it's red,
then it will be buried.

556
01:09:37,263 --> 01:09:42,030
So many suns have set
since Magua struck the war post.

557
01:09:42,101 --> 01:09:44,399
And where is that sun?

558
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:48,907
Le Subtil is the son of his people
and he has come to lead many of them.

559
01:09:48,975 --> 01:09:53,241
But Le Subtil has power
with his Huron people and others here,

560
01:09:53,312 --> 01:09:55,542
I know well.

561
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:05,457
Magua's village and lodges
were burnt.

562
01:10:07,793 --> 01:10:10,785
Magua's children were killed
by the English.

563
01:10:12,965 --> 01:10:16,264
I was taken as slave
by the Mohawk...

564
01:10:16,335 --> 01:10:18,599
who fought for Grey Hair.

565
01:10:20,006 --> 01:10:24,272
Magua's wife believed
he was dead...

566
01:10:26,445 --> 01:10:29,039
and became the wife
of another.

567
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:32,907
The Grey Hair
was the father of all that.

568
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,745
In time,

569
01:10:36,822 --> 01:10:42,055
Magua became blood brother
to the Mohawk to become free.

570
01:10:42,128 --> 01:10:45,859
But always in his heart
he is Huron.

571
01:10:48,034 --> 01:10:52,835
And his heart will be
whole again on the day...

572
01:10:52,905 --> 01:10:56,136
the Grey Hair and
all his seed are dead.

573
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:58,199
My son Magua's pain...

574
01:10:58,277 --> 01:11:00,302
is my pain.

575
01:11:05,184 --> 01:11:08,881
Does the chief of the Canadas believe
the English will keep the terms?

576
01:11:13,993 --> 01:11:15,927
Colonel Munro would,

577
01:11:15,995 --> 01:11:20,091
but GeneraI Webb will not
honor the agreement...

578
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:24,630
and send
their soldiers away.

579
01:11:24,704 --> 01:11:29,198
I fear having let them go,
which I must,

580
01:11:29,275 --> 01:11:32,210
I will only fight
the same men again...

581
01:11:32,278 --> 01:11:35,145
when I drive
towards Albany.

582
01:11:37,683 --> 01:11:40,550
But I cannot break
The term of the surrender...

583
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:43,747
and sully the lilies
of France.

584
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:27,126
Monsieur, the fort is yours.

585
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:56,766
Left three ranks, make ready!

586
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,960
Aim, set.

587
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:37,266
Fire!

588
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:26,770
Present fire!

589
01:18:29,546 --> 01:18:32,743
Fire! Fire!

590
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,754
Full company-

591
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:05,570
Grey Hair, before you die, Know that I
will put under the knife your children...

592
01:19:05,649 --> 01:19:08,049
so I will wipe your seed
from the Earth forever.

593
01:19:35,412 --> 01:19:37,607
Lever her alone!

594
01:21:30,727 --> 01:21:35,323
When you fall into British hands again,
I'll have you hanged!

595
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:47,467
Faster!

596
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,946
Take to the river!

597
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:16,124
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

598
01:24:16,194 --> 01:24:19,459
- I don't understand.
- This is as far as we go.

599
01:24:19,531 --> 01:24:22,557
If we're lucky, they'll figure we
beached our canoes and headed cross land.

600
01:24:22,634 --> 01:24:25,159
If we're very lucky,
they'll figure we went over the falls.

601
01:24:25,237 --> 01:24:28,434
- Our only hope is that they pass us by.
- If they do?

602
01:24:28,506 --> 01:24:30,599
Take the south rim
down the mountain.

603
01:24:30,675 --> 01:24:33,508
It's 12 miles cross country
to Fort Edward.

604
01:24:33,578 --> 01:24:36,672
And if they don't?

605
01:24:36,748 --> 01:24:39,979
You'll just have to forego
the pleasure of hangin' me.

606
01:24:44,756 --> 01:24:46,724
Powder?

607
01:24:55,967 --> 01:24:59,994
- Gone.

608
01:25:00,071 --> 01:25:02,733
Mine's soakin' wet!

609
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:05,241
Our father-

610
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:08,575
Did you see my father?

611
01:25:08,647 --> 01:25:10,911
From a distance.

612
01:25:41,546 --> 01:25:44,014
Say nothing to Alice.

613
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:07,700
Get back!

614
01:27:01,292 --> 01:27:03,988
Yes! Go ahead!

615
01:27:04,062 --> 01:27:06,826
What the bloody hell
plan is this?

616
01:27:06,898 --> 01:27:10,527
- I want you to go!
- If we got here's a chance there won't be a fight.

617
01:27:10,602 --> 01:27:15,665
There's no powder. If we don't go in that,
there's no chance. None! You understand?

618
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:18,038
Coward!

619
01:27:19,711 --> 01:27:22,009
You stay alive!

620
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,948
If they don't kill you, they'll
Take you north up to the Huron lands.

621
01:27:26,017 --> 01:27:28,212
Submit, do you hear?
You're strong.

622
01:27:28,286 --> 01:27:30,914
You survive!

623
01:27:30,989 --> 01:27:35,619
You stay alive,
no matter what occurs!

624
01:27:35,693 --> 01:27:37,888
I will find you,

625
01:27:37,962 --> 01:27:41,898
no matter how long it takes,
no matter how far!

626
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:44,799
I will find you.

627
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:35,640
I don't speak Huron.
Do you speak French, Major?

628
01:35:35,713 --> 01:35:39,046
- No!
- Translate for me in French, every word as I say it.

629
01:35:39,116 --> 01:35:42,574
- I come to you unarmed and in peace...

630
01:35:42,653 --> 01:35:45,087
to unstuff your ears,
Sachem.

631
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:48,614
Let the children of the dead
Colonel Munro go free.

632
01:35:48,693 --> 01:35:52,220
Take fire out of the English anger
over the murder of their helpless ones.

633
01:36:01,405 --> 01:36:06,433
- Sachem, the French fathers made peace.

634
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:10,470
Magua broke it. It is false That the
French will be friends Still to the Huron.

635
01:36:57,094 --> 01:37:00,188
Would Magua use the ways of
le Francais and the Yengeese?

636
01:37:00,264 --> 01:37:02,528
- Would you?

637
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,660
- Yes!
- Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish...

638
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:10,400
with brandy and steal his lands
to sell them for gold to the white man?

639
01:37:10,474 --> 01:37:15,173
- Would Huron have greed for
more land than a man can use?

640
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:17,771
Would Huron fool Seneca
into taking all the furs...

641
01:37:17,848 --> 01:37:20,442
of all the animals of the forest
for beads and strong whiskey?

642
01:37:20,518 --> 01:37:24,579
Would the Huron kill every man,
woman and child of their enemy?

643
01:37:24,655 --> 01:37:28,887
Those are the ways of the Yengeese
and the Francais traders...

644
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,485
and their masters in Europe
infected with the sickness of greed.

645
01:37:34,565 --> 01:37:36,692
Magua's heart is twisted.

646
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:40,168
He would make himself
into what twisted him.

647
01:37:41,672 --> 01:37:44,140
I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese.

648
01:37:44,208 --> 01:37:47,371
Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook
Of the Mohican people.

649
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:52,712
Let the children of the dead Munro
And the Yengeese officer go free.

650
01:37:52,783 --> 01:37:57,880
This belt, which is a record of the days
of my father's people, speaks for my truth.

651
01:39:19,984 --> 01:39:23,147
- Tell him I'll trade him. Me for her!

652
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:26,156
- Say it!

653
01:39:39,068 --> 01:39:40,592
- Stop it!

654
01:39:40,669 --> 01:39:42,899
I am La Longue Carabine!

655
01:39:42,972 --> 01:39:47,204
My death is a great honor
To the Huron! Take me!

656
01:39:47,276 --> 01:39:49,403
Did you tell him?

657
01:39:50,646 --> 01:39:53,274
Yes.

658
01:40:05,594 --> 01:40:07,528
Stop!

659
01:40:10,065 --> 01:40:12,693
I said take me.

660
01:40:12,768 --> 01:40:15,965
- Take me!
- My compliments, sir. Take her and get out!

661
01:40:16,038 --> 01:40:20,031
What are they doing to Duncan?
Where's Alice?

662
01:40:20,109 --> 01:40:22,873
Alice!

663
01:44:56,385 --> 01:44:58,319
Uncas!

664
01:48:48,177 --> 01:48:51,510
Great Spirit
and maker of all life,

665
01:48:54,217 --> 01:48:58,677
a warrior goes to You swift and straight
as an arrow shot into the sun.

666
01:49:00,423 --> 01:49:05,520
Welcome him, and let him take his place
at the council fire of my people.

667
01:49:07,697 --> 01:49:10,791
He is Uncas-

668
01:49:10,867 --> 01:49:13,529
my son.

669
01:49:13,603 --> 01:49:18,131
Tell him to be patient
and ask death for speed,

670
01:49:18,207 --> 01:49:21,734
for they are all there
but one,

671
01:49:21,811 --> 01:49:25,076
I, Chingachgook,

672
01:49:25,148 --> 01:49:27,878
the last of the Mohicans.

673
01:50:29,345 --> 01:50:31,313
The frontier moves
with the sun,

674
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:35,510
and pushes the Red Man of these
wilderness forests in front of it...

675
01:50:35,585 --> 01:50:39,578
until one day
there will be nowhere left.

676
01:50:41,324 --> 01:50:44,350
Then our race
will be no more,

677
01:50:44,427 --> 01:50:47,419
or be not us.

678
01:50:47,497 --> 01:50:50,193
That is my father's
Sadness talking.

679
01:50:50,266 --> 01:50:52,928
No, it is true.

680
01:50:53,002 --> 01:50:57,371
The frontier place is for people
like my white son and his woman...

681
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,533
and their children.

682
01:50:59,609 --> 01:51:02,737
And one day there will be
no more frontier.

683
01:51:04,714 --> 01:51:07,649
And men like you
will go too,

684
01:51:07,717 --> 01:51:10,447
like the Mohicans.

685
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:15,246
And new people will come,
work, struggle.

686
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:18,406
Some will make
their life.

687
01:51:18,483 --> 01:51:20,974
But once...

688
01:51:21,052 --> 01:51:23,646
we were here.
