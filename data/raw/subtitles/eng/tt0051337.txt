1
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,600
Aye, Captain.

2
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,520
Sound for a depth.

3
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,520
A sounding? Here?

4
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,200
- Aye.
- Aye, Captain.

5
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,880
Does he expect to land here,
past the very end of land?

6
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,560
Perhaps hunger has
crazed his mind.

7
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,080
His belly is
as empty as ours.

8
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,880
lf there was land, it would be such
as no man would dare set foot upon.

9
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,040
Sinbad would.
He dares anything.

10
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,200
Captain!

11
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,120
Full fathom seven !

12
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,760
Sharp lookout aloft, there!

13
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,400
Aye, Captain !

14
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,400
What can it be?

15
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,440
Perhaps a sunken reef.

16
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,880
Or a sea-serpent
or something worse!

17
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,080
Full fathom five!

18
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,320
Oh, let it be land.

19
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
Land ho, off the port bow!

20
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,000
He has the eyes of an owl.

21
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
l see nothing.

22
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,600
Look! There!

23
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,960
Land it is!

24
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,440
All hands, look alive!

25
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,200
Drop anchor. We'll go ashore
at the first light of dawn.

26
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,880
May AIlah grant
we find food and water.

27
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,760
And may Allah grant
we find nothing more.

28
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,560
This is no time of night
to be knocking at a lady's bedroom.

29
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,160
l would speak with your mistress.
l bring good news.

30
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
l know your sailor's tricks.

31
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,000
Now off with you.
Go and steer your course elsewhere.

32
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,600
Sadi...

33
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,800
you must be more polite
to the captain.

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,560
He is not responsible for the mysterious
winds which blew us off our course.

35
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,080
Or are you?

36
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,920
l blame him for taking you from
the safety of your father's palace...

37
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,680
to this.

38
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,240
l came willingly, Sadi.

39
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,080
What good news, Captain?

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,080
We are anchoring off an island.

41
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,840
Tomorrow we take on food
and water to continue our voyage.

42
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,240
The food comes none too soon.

43
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,680
That pirate Harufa
has already found eyes for my pet.

44
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,920
ln a week you'll be
feasting in Bagdad...

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,920
at our wedding.

46
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,680
l think you invented the island
for just this purpose.

47
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,600
For another such kiss...

48
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,920
l'd invent a whole continent.

49
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,440
Bananas! Melon !

50
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,880
Here, have a coconut,
and grapes.

51
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,280
Captain Sinbad is filling his cask
with fresh water from the spring.

52
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,320
Stay here until he returns.

53
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,560
A cloven hoof.

54
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,040
Here, there's another!

55
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,480
What a stride!

56
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,640
Captain Sinbad, look!

57
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,120
Captain!

58
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
What is it?

59
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,640
lt has the mark
of some ancient civilization.

60
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,080
lt has the mark of Satan himself.

61
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,320
Come, Sinbad.
Let us go back to the ship.

62
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,520
Hold this.

63
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,520
l'm going to see
where that stone mouth leads.

64
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,480
Help me!

65
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,160
To the boat-- quickly!

66
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,000
From the land beyond beyond...

67
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,200
from the world
past hope and fear...

68
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,120
l bid you, genie, now appear.

69
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,600
l obey the master of the lamp.

70
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,600
l command you to build me a barrier
between those men and the Cyclops.

71
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,400
l shall try, O Master.
l shall try.

72
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,560
What weird power
restrains that monster?

73
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,000
The man who holds this treasure
is safe from even greater danger.

74
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,200
lf your lamp has such power,
why didn't you destroy the monster?

75
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,120
The genie of the lamp
cannot be used to work harm.

76
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,480
But in protection,
his powers are invincible.

77
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,280
Look out!

78
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,880
Help!

79
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,560
Oh, my prayer is answered.
You are safe.

80
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,080
Hoist all sail !

81
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,240
Full starboard rudder!
Head for deep water!

82
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,200
- Come on.
- The lamp! The magic lamp!

83
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,160
For your ship,
a king's ransom in jewels.

84
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
For you forget one thing,
my triend.

85
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,480
The Cyclops will be
on guard now.

86
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,640
Besides their great strength,
they have the magic lamp as well.

87
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
The Cyclops have no speech.
lt is useless to them.

88
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,720
l alone can invoke
the power of the genie.

89
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,080
Who are you?

90
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,400
l am Sokurah...

91
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,920
the magician.

92
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,080
ls your lamp so precious you would
risk your life to return to the island?

93
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,840
There is nothing l would not do
to regain it.

94
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,640
Your ambition has nearly
cost us our lives already.

95
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,400
lf you are indeed a magician, why do you
not use your power to slay the Cyclops?

96
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,200
l had prepared a potion
for just such a purpose...

97
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,640
but l could not persuade the Cyclops
to swallow it.

98
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,080
Captain, the winds that drove your ship
to the island of Colossa...

99
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,520
have wrecked many vessels
on its shores.

100
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,480
The treasure of a hundred years
has been gathered by the Cyclops.

101
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,720
The wealth
that awaits us there is worth...

102
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,760
many, many thousand times
what you see here.

103
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,560
We are on an important mission
for the caliph of Bagdad.

104
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,720
Our presence there means
the difference between war and peace.

105
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,160
l'll not risk that
by turning back.

106
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,240
That is my final word.

107
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,320
Perhaps when you are
safely in Bagdad...

108
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,080
you will be persuaded to feel
differently about the venture.

109
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,520
l doubt it.

110
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Harufa, show the magician
to his quarters.

111
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,440
With fair winds
we should reach port in five days.

112
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,040
Magician, your jewels.

113
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,240
My lord Sinbad is
a very great prince in his country.

114
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,960
The people rejoice
for the news l bring:

115
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,920
peace between
your father's kingdom and ours.

116
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,480
And do you love me
just to save Bagdad from destruction?

117
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,280
l love you
because l cannot do otherwise.

118
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,600
Your eyes are mightier
than all your father's armies.

119
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,280
Three times welcome, Sinbad.
You have done wonders to avert a war.

120
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,720
And what fair prize is this?

121
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,120
The princess Parisa,
daughter of the sultan of Chandra...

122
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,240
pledged to be my bride.

123
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,680
A symbol of lasting friendship
between our kingdoms.

124
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,080
Welcome as a daughter, my child...

125
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,760
for l love Sinbad
as my own son.

126
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,200
l thank you, kind sir.

127
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,720
My father, the sultan,
sends his wish for your health...

128
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,760
and bids me tell you he will arrive
within a week for our wedding.

129
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,000
And a royal wedding it shall be,
with all the honors of our court.

130
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Tell me about your journey, Sinbad.

131
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, a strange voyage
and a strange tale it is, my caliph.

132
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,440
l did not think any place could be
more beautiful than Chandra...

133
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,320
yet Bagdad is.

134
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,000
The city is made lovely
by your presence.

135
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,120
Without you it is plain.

136
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,600
Now that we are here, all the strange
terrors of the voyage seem unreal.

137
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,880
Yet they were all too real
at the time.

138
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,880
Perhaps it is all a dream...

139
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,240
and the one-eyed giant a nightmare.

140
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,080
And is Sokurah the magician
also a dream?

141
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,640
He is very real, indeed.

142
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,440
There is something about him
which frightens me.

143
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,040
lf only he would vanish
when l awaken.

144
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,440
He is determined to gain possession
of the magic lamp.

145
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,480
His life is distorted
with this single, driving wish.

146
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,680
l pity him...

147
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,160
for l have my one wish.

148
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,720
lllustrious and magnificent
Caliph of Bagdad...

149
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,360
l am honored to be summoned
to your presence.

150
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,360
Sinbad says you are a man
of unusual powers.

151
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,840
lt is our wish
that you demonstrate your skill...

152
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,840
at a welcoming feast for the sultan.

153
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,680
Your wish shall be granted
even before it is asked.

154
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,120
l promise a performance that will live
in the memory of the caliph...

155
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,640
for all his days...

156
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,520
may he live a thousand years.

157
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,000
You please me already.

158
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,320
Your palace is a jewel
of comfort and hospitality, but--

159
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,360
- But?
- My happiness would be complete...

160
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,040
if you would but grant me
a single wish.

161
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,440
State it.

162
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,840
A fast ship and a well-armed crew...

163
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,320
to return to my island.

164
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,760
Ships are costly,
and lives are not to be wasted.

165
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,040
l have here the design of a new weapon,
a giant crossbow...

166
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,000
that will protect the men from harm.

167
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,520
l cannot judge, for l have not yet
seen the one-eyed giants.

168
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,200
Sinbad, what is your opinion?

169
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,840
Tales of our voyage already
have spread through Bagdad.

170
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,840
No one but a madman would ever
sail a ship back to Colossa.

171
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
Sinbad's word...

172
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,800
is my word.

173
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,560
Until the sultan's feast then?

174
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,680
Are you sure you can be happy
here in Bagdad?

175
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,200
Very. l love Sinbad more
with every sunrise.

176
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,800
l had such doubts
after l let you go.

177
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,920
lf anything had happened to you,
they would have paid with many lives.

178
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,080
Father, you're getting angry.
Now, you mustn't, you know.

179
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,240
Oh, here comes the caliph.
Now, smile at him. He's a very nice man.

180
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,440
May your illustrious presence
in my humble palace...

181
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,240
return to your own house
a thousandfold.

182
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,400
lf my daughter is happy,
l have honor enough.

183
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,920
Daughter.

184
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,520
Remember, not only will you triumph
over good and evil...

185
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,560
but you will be
the most exotic woman in all Bagdad.

186
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,960
What must l do?

187
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,680
Leave everything in my hands.

188
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,960
l have arranged a presentation
which l think will arouse your interest.

189
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Summon Sokurah the magician !

190
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,120
ls that not Sadi,
your waiting woman?

191
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,360
Yes, Papa. She has offered herself
as the magician's subject.

192
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,640
lf he can turn her into a contented
woman, he is indeed a great magician.

193
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,320
lt's a serpent.
Papa, she will be killed!

194
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,800
Allah have mercy on them both.

195
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,600
Oh, Papa.

196
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,040
Behold!

197
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,920
lt is impossible.
l am asleep.

198
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,920
lf so, l share your dream.

199
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,040
- l assure you she is unharmed.
- Sadi, are you all right?

200
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,320
Well done, Sokurah.

201
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,840
lf l have pleased you,
l hope you will grant my request...

202
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,720
for an expedition
to my island of Colossa.

203
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,960
You are truly
a man of great skill...

204
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,920
but l do not change my mind
so easily.

205
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,800
Perhaps a further demonstration
of my powers is necessary.

206
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,920
The art of prophecy
has always fascinated me.

207
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,360
Can you foretell the future?

208
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,080
l can, upon occasion,
foretell certain events.

209
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,440
lt would please us to have you look
into the future of our two countries.

210
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,120
As you wish.

211
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,440
l shall require
a brazier of live coals.

212
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,120
You shall have it.

213
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,640
Guards!

214
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,120
May the unseen forces grant
that l see nothing but good.

215
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,080
My spirit races
ahead of time itself.

216
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,880
Ask your questions.

217
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,240
What do you see here in Bagdad?

218
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,240
l see, but l cannot speak.

219
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,560
You must.

220
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,560
l see great disaster.

221
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,160
l see--

222
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,720
l cannot tell!

223
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,240
Go on! l command you!

224
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,120
There are great buildings falling...

225
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,640
women and children slain.

226
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,720
l see war!

227
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,440
War between Bagdad and Chandra.

228
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,240
You lie!

229
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,560
What of my daughter's wedding?

230
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,240
There will be no wedding.

231
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,960
Mysterious and evil forces
are at work...

232
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,120
and the wedding rejoicing shall be
turned to mourning.

233
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,360
You have done well, Sinbad.

234
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,080
l could not bear to have
that charlatan frighten the princess.

235
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,040
l spoke at your insistence.

236
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,440
The events my spirit saw
lurk as dire possibilities.

237
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,720
lf you request,
l will use my powers...

238
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,600
to disperse the evil forces
and avert such disaster.

239
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,840
ln return l presume l must grant you
the ship and the sailors you desire.

240
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,360
Such a gift of gratitude
would seem fitting.

241
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,160
So, your lies are cheap schemes
to force me to grant your wish.

242
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,160
Get out! You have committed treason
against both Bagdad and Chandra.

243
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,960
lf you are found within the walls
of our city by sunset tomorrow...

244
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,240
your eyes will be torn out...

245
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,280
that you may see
no more evil dreams.

246
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,320
To the wedding
and our lasting friendship.

247
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,120
Good night,
though l wish the night were gone.

248
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,640
Tomorrow will come soon...

249
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,920
and all the nights thereafter
cannot come soon enough.

250
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,840
l cannot imagine waking
to see your face instead of Sadi's.

251
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,640
She was indeed transformed tonight
by that magician.

252
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,160
Suppose that his prophecy--

253
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,320
l'll dream of dangers he predicted...

254
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
so you can rescue me.

255
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,800
After the wedding,
the procession will pass here...

256
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,560
then pause before the throne
where you and l will be seated equally.

257
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,520
My lord!

258
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,760
- Where is she? Where's my daughter?
- The princess!

259
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,000
Sinbad, here l am!

260
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,520
Sinbad, look,
here on the pillow.

261
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,840
- Look closely.
- No.

262
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,560
No, it cannot be so.

263
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,040
lt is.

264
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,240
The world has grown very large
overnight.

265
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,960
lt's true.
lt is you, my darling.

266
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,800
My daughter-- where is she?

267
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,400
Where is my--

268
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,840
Ten thousand devils!

269
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,880
What evil sorcery is this?

270
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,600
My daughter-- is it you?

271
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,120
Speak, tell me my eyes lie.

272
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,040
You see truly, my father.

273
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,240
l would have borne any insult...

274
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,240
but my dear one...

275
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,760
my daughter.

276
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,120
Look upon your city.

277
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,600
Enjoy the sight...

278
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,400
for soon it will be rubble
and bleached bones.

279
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,040
Sokurah, wait!

280
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,240
- The princess, she has been--
- l know. ln my vision l saw her state.

281
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,320
But l feared to tell you
because of your great anger.

282
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,160
Tell me, can you help her?

283
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,680
Possibly.

284
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,120
No. No, the risk
would be too great.

285
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,520
lf she can be helped,
l will do anything.

286
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
l cannot turn back.

287
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,360
lf l am in Bagdad at sundown,
my eyes will be dark forever.

288
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,560
l'll answer to the caliph for that.
Now come quickly.

289
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
No, l--

290
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,480
Tell us quickly
what must be done.

291
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,800
There is one secret potion
which will remove the evil charm.

292
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,360
- Mix the potion with no more delay.
- We lack the most vital ingredient:

293
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,720
a piece of shell from the egg
of a giant bird called the Roc.

294
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,920
A monstrous bird that nests
on the peaks of Colossa.

295
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,720
The same. Without this shell
the potion is useless.

296
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,720
We have no choice, O Caliph. l must sail
at once and bring back the eggshell.

297
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,200
No, the princess must go with us.

298
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,560
Only in my castle
can the potion be used.

299
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,840
l'll order a ship
to be provisioned at once.

300
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,920
We'll need your design
for the giant crossbow.

301
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,160
The palace jeweler can make
a tiny home for the princess.

302
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,080
Where will you find
the crew, Sinbad?

303
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,080
The bravest of my former men
will sail with me.

304
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,320
That will not be enough.
Where will you find the others?

305
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,640
l'll find them...

306
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,560
where men fear the headsman's axe
more than the Cyclops:

307
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,320
in the caliph's prison yard.

308
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,880
Hear me! Hear!

309
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Come hear!

310
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,000
l am Captain Sinbad.

311
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,000
l am here with an offer
of freedom.

312
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,480
l have come to raise a crew
for the hard and dangerous voyage...

313
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,120
to the island of Colossa.

314
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,040
The land of the Cyclops!

315
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,200
We may be thieves and murderers...

316
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,200
but we're not fools.

317
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,200
The caliph of Bagdad has
offered you fuIl pardon.

318
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,800
He offers us a choice
of two kinds of death.

319
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,640
l fought with the Cyclops,
and here l stand, alive as you.

320
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,440
This man was at my side,
and he sails with me again.

321
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,400
Well, what'll it be?
We need five and twenty men.

322
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,600
Freedom or the hangman's noose!

323
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,080
They'll not put a rope
'round Golar's neck!

324
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,520
He'll spit in the Cyclops' eye first.

325
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,120
- That's right. Come on!
- Let's go!

326
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,360
- Me too!
- l'm ready!

327
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,400
Take me! Take me too!

328
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,880
The ship's hold is filled with the
giant crossbow. There's no more room.

329
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,880
Then lash the arrow
to the mast.

330
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,360
Aye, aye, Captain.

331
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,160
Careful! We may need that arrow
to fight for our lives!

332
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,040
We're all fools!

333
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,920
lf we're to fight for our lives,
let us fight against men, not monsters.

334
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,520
There are rich prizes
plying the coastal waters.

335
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,200
This vessel could be ours
for the taking.

336
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,080
What of those men
who are loyal to the captain?

337
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,600
We'll feed 'em to the fish.

338
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,520
Heave!

339
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,840
l fear this will be a tedious voyage
for you without Sadi.

340
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,880
l shall never complain,
not as long as l am near you.

341
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,640
A hazardous voyage, too,
in spite of all the plans we've made.

342
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,680
lf you were as small as l,
you could walk among the giants unseen.

343
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,360
They are not our only danger.

344
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,280
We must sail uncharted waters
with a doubtful crew.

345
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,360
l sometimes wonder what they would think
if they could see me as l am.

346
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,200
l do not trust them
out of my sight or in it.

347
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,760
Yes?

348
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,880
Captain, can I have
a few words with you?

349
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,040
For the past week
there has been unrest among the crew.

350
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,360
l have heard dangerous mutterings.

351
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,040
All weapons have been locked
in the forward cabin.

352
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,200
Without knives or swords
they can do nothing.

353
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,600
ln a few more days
we should reach the island.

354
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,840
Something troubles your appetite,
Sinbad.

355
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,120
l shall be glad when we arrive.

356
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,360
Sinbad, how can you love a tiny...

357
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,520
insignificant female such as l?

358
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,280
A diamond is a tiny thing...

359
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,280
yet it is very precious
and beautiful.

360
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,200
Quickly, Princess!

361
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,560
Stop! Do not kill him!

362
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,520
We surrender!
Harufa, we must give up.

363
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,200
This is a touching show
of friendship. Take his sword!

364
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,200
Here. The magician's cloak
will make a flag for us.

365
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,320
Here are the men who would
feed us to the one-eyed monster.

366
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,200
What shall we do with 'em?

367
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,360
Kill 'em!

368
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,480
You hear the verdict.
You die at dawn.

369
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,560
And my wish for a night
of pleasant dreams.

370
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,240
Hear my curse,
for it seals your doom.

371
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,840
Those who harm us
shall be driven mad!

372
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,960
Terror shall be in your hearts...

373
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,480
and before dawn you will plead with us
for your very lives.

374
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,240
Oh, save me.

375
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,840
Oh, save us, magician,
save us!

376
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,440
For you l will tie the knot myself...

377
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,520
so you will strangle slowly.

378
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,840
Throw 'em in the forward hold!

379
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,320
Helmsman!

380
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,520
Take a course due south.

381
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,120
We'll circle back
to the trade routes. Go on !

382
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,200
Could have sliced them all to bits,
and you stopped us...

383
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,680
to save this idiot
who babbles nonsense.

384
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
You will see.

385
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,840
Winds and currents will
drive the ship southward...

386
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,800
and my prophecy will come true.

387
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,400
What makes you so certain?

388
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,560
South of Colossa lies
an accursed island...

389
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,320
inhabited by wailing demons.

390
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,080
Their screaming is heard
over a hundred leagues.

391
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,520
Men hearing it are driven mad.

392
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,320
They drive their ships
onto the jagged rocks...

393
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,360
and are devoured by sea serpents.

394
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,040
What's to prevent us
from sharing their fate?

395
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,240
lf we stuff bits of cloth
in our ears.

396
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,320
Well, that's fine.
Now we won't be driven mad...

397
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
we'll just be devoured
by sea monsters.

398
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,080
Here. lf we wax the cloth
it will stop most of the sound.

399
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,400
The wind screams like 10,000 fiends!

400
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,560
Full port rudder!

401
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,120
Change your course!

402
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,960
We'll be wrecked on the rocks!

403
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,800
Ho, lookout!

404
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,760
What can you see?

405
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,680
Hold this course
or you'll die!

406
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,840
Steer us out!

407
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,760
High winds and seas
surround the demon island.

408
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,560
The sound penetrates even here.

409
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,680
Give me that glass!

410
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,080
Full port rudder!

411
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,720
l'm gonna release them!

412
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,200
Full port rudder!

413
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Save us, Captain...

414
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,520
before we're wrecked.

415
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,560
There is a narrow channel
through the rocks.

416
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,000
lt is our only chance.

417
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,760
Has the whole ship gone mad?

418
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,200
Full port rudder!

419
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,600
Sharp lookout
for the peaks of Colossa!

420
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,960
Crossbow will be assembled
and ready within the hour.

421
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,480
Keep the men at the crossbow.

422
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,800
l would rather go with you.

423
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,280
l know, my friend,
but you are more valuable here.

424
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,160
Everything is in readiness.

425
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,560
The sooner we leave,
the better. Come!

426
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,920
Here.

427
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,400
Who's in command
of the great crossbow?

428
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,200
You are.

429
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,680
This is the valley of the Cyclops.

430
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,280
Beyond, in the center of the island, are
the peaks where the great birds nest.

431
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,840
Then our path lies
through the valley.

432
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,680
Your path.
We separate into two groups...

433
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,840
because, if one group is captured...

434
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,960
the other may attempt to free them.

435
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,040
We meet the far side of the valley...

436
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,400
tonight at sunset.

437
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,480
May the powers of good
protect all our footsteps.

438
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,600
We will stop and rest here
and proceed again at nightfall.

439
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,760
You, Golar,
do not drink so deeply.

440
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,520
We will need the water
for our climb tomorrow.

441
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,240
Why so miserly?

442
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,600
We can fill the skin from the pool
when it's empty.

443
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,640
- That's right.
- This water is poison.

444
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,200
The man who lets it touch his lips
will be dead in a moment.

445
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,120
Poison?

446
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
Would you care to try it?

447
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,000
Wait here a moment.

448
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,600
What are you doing here?

449
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,480
Don't worry, master.
The crossbow's in good hands.

450
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,760
Let us get back to the others, Harufa,
before the return of the Cyclops.

451
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,400
They were here a moment ago.

452
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,400
See if you can find them.

453
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,240
Captain Sinbad!

454
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,760
Come, quickly!

455
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,440
Here! Through here! Hurry!

456
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,320
We're rich ! Come, master!
Take your fill !

457
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,960
Pearls, rubies, gold-- everything!

458
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,880
Out of here, all of you !

459
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,480
There'll be time enough for treasure
after we finish our mission.

460
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,480
Out, hear me?
Or, by my sword, l'll run you through!

461
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,960
Let me go!

462
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,960
Sinbad's men must be trapped.

463
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,960
You will remain here.

464
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,040
Help! Help me!

465
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,280
Sinbad, help!

466
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,200
Must we thirst here
while water runs all around us...

467
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,800
just because of the magician?

468
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,600
He has strange powers.
We dare not disobey him.

469
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,920
- Golar dares.
- That's right.

470
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,440
Then drink from the pool
he has forbidden.

471
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,440
You think he's afraid, eh?

472
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,320
Here. Show them.

473
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,560
Hey!

474
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,520
That's good!

475
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,240
Tastes like choice wine.

476
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,280
Help! Sinbad!

477
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,520
Help me, Sinbad!

478
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,840
Lend me a hand.
Maybe l can reach the latch.

479
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,440
Come here.

480
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,760
There's a latch on top of the cage.
See if you can open it.

481
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,200
Why does he leave us?

482
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,280
He leaves us
to share the fate of Harufa.

483
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,960
But we shall escape.

484
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,480
Escape? How?

485
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
You must never reveal
what you are about to see.

486
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,040
- We won't, just get us out of here!
- Anything, anything! Save us!

487
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,080
Princess, there's a latch
on top of this cage.

488
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,680
Will you see if you can open it?

489
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,680
l'll do my best.

490
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,280
l see the latch.
l'll try.

491
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,120
Sinbad, it is stuck!

492
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,880
l cannot move it!

493
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,800
You must try, Princess.
lt's our only hope.

494
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,800
The lamp!

495
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,080
lt is done, Sinbad!

496
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,600
Lift me up!

497
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,360
Must we hide here so quietly...

498
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,640
while our comrades are in danger?

499
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,720
Are we afraid of Sokurah?

500
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,800
Who's afraid?

501
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,800
Then follow us.

502
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,080
Courage, Harufa.
Put out the fire.

503
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,920
Let's get out of here!

504
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,080
The lamp!

505
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,120
Here. Here l am!

506
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,760
Over here!

507
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,200
Over here! Closer! Closer!

508
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,840
A little further now.

509
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,640
Here! Closer!

510
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,320
Look! There he is!
He's dead!

511
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,120
The danger is far from past.

512
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,440
There are still Cyclops alive.

513
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,280
l alone know the words that will
summon the protection of the genie...

514
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,080
therefore, l should have the lamp.

515
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,840
l do not trust you.

516
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,400
When l called you to free us,
you made no attempt to open the cage.

517
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,760
l do not understand
the power of this lamp.

518
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,960
But if we need it,
it shall be safely within my grasp.

519
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,480
As you say.

520
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,000
Poor Rahan.

521
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,160
Allah knows many ways
of dealing with hungry men.

522
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,240
Look. We have reached our goal.

523
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,200
There's something
moving inside.

524
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,080
lt is a season
for the young birds.

525
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,400
Higher up there will be eggs
already hatched.

526
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,520
Come this way.

527
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,560
No more climbing, please!

528
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,600
We're starving.

529
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,280
Here.

530
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,720
Let us break open the egg.

531
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,480
Put down that spear!

532
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,760
You should not
have let them do that.

533
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,240
Hungry men don't ask.
They take.

534
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,080
Here. The princess
must be restored without delay.

535
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,960
That eggshell must be combined
with other elements...

536
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,920
to be found in my cave
at the foot of the mountain.

537
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,920
But that's at the edge
of the Cyclops' domain.

538
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,360
What protects your castle
from them?

539
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,040
You will see when we get there.

540
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,720
- l'm glad to breathe the fresh air.
- Good news, my princess.

541
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,400
We have the eggshell
which will make the potion effective.

542
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,800
Your words are happy,
but your face is sad.

543
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,960
Why are you troubled, Sinbad?

544
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,240
l do not trust the magician.

545
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,720
Our only hold over him
is this magic lamp...

546
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,840
and he alone knows the secret
of its power.

547
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,360
Let me enter the lamp.

548
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,240
Perhaps l can talk with the genie
and learn how to call him.

549
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,280
But is such a thing possible?

550
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,400
Well, who knows what's possible
within a magic lamp?

551
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,920
Please let me try.

552
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,440
All right.

553
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,840
lf all is not well, call quickly.

554
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,360
l will. l promise l will.

555
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,400
- Are you all right, Parisa?
- Oh, fine!

556
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,320
There's a wonderful mist down here.

557
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,320
Be careful.

558
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,400
Welcome, Princess Parisa.

559
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,760
You know who l am.

560
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,040
A genie knows many things.

561
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,800
And you're as tiny as l am.

562
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,680
How else could l live
inside a lamp?

563
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,960
And such a lovely one.

564
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,000
Had l known how beautiful it is,
l'd have visited you long ago.

565
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,320
You must be truly happy here.

566
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,000
The most comfortable prison
is still a lonely place.

567
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,400
But aren't you sometimes called
to our world to work your wonders?

568
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,080
But then l'm summoned as a slave...

569
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,800
to do the bidding
of whoever holds the lamp.

570
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,320
l long to be free--
to be an adventurer...

571
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,280
and to sail the seas
as Captain Sinbad does.

572
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,280
But those are dreams for real boys...

573
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,320
and not for a genie.

574
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,200
ls there no way
to escape your bondage?

575
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,000
Perhaps, some day...

576
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,120
but l cannot return
to the real world...

577
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,680
until l am called by my name.

578
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,800
- What is your name?
- Barani.

579
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,840
l have a promise of freedom
inscribed in the lamp.

580
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,240
- Would you care to see?
- Yes. l should love to see it.

581
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,960
lt is here.

582
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,400
''When the big that is small...

583
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,560
shall again become tall...

584
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,320
into fiery rock
to rise you must fall.''

585
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,200
''When the big that is small.''

586
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,960
l was big, and now l'm small.

587
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,560
- Then you know what it means?
- l'm not sure...

588
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,600
but l'll make you a bargain.

589
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,280
lf you'll help me, l'll help you.

590
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,280
What do you want me to do?

591
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,720
Tell me the magic words
that caIl you forth from the lamp.

592
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,640
l like you, and l wish to help.

593
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,560
But l don't know.
lt's a great power to grant.

594
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,040
ln return, l promise
l'll try to help you, Barani.

595
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:05,000
Now tell me the words
that invoke your protective power.

596
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,800
From the land beyond beyond--

597
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,120
From the land beyond beyond. Go on.

598
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,240
From the world past hope and fear--

599
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:22,400
From the world past hope and fear--

600
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,320
l bid you, genie, now appear.

601
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,600
l bid you, genie, now appear.

602
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,600
The genie was very nice to you.

603
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,680
Yes. He promised to help us
if we'd help him.

604
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,680
And we will help him.

605
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,120
Hey, look!

606
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,440
From the land beyond beyond...

607
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,160
from the world past hope and fear...

608
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,800
l bid you, genie, now--

609
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,640
Harufa, the lamp!

610
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,600
From the land beyond beyond...

611
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,000
from the world past hope and fear...

612
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,320
l bid you, genie, now appear.

613
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,400
O mighty Sinbad, the slave of the lamp
is yours to command.

614
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:05,160
- Where is the Princess Parisa?
- She is a prisoner of the magician...

615
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,680
in his underground castle
at the foot of the mountain trail.

616
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,640
l will meet you there.

617
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,360
But how will l know?

618
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,520
Go ahead. Turn it!

619
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,320
lnside the cave
you'll find another wheel...

620
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,080
with which to loose the dragon,
so that he may guard the entrance.

621
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,360
l knew l could trust your Sinbad
to bring the lamp to us.

622
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,440
Now l will show you a sight
which will make your heart leap.

623
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,280
Behold.

624
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,080
Sinbad, l'm here!

625
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,080
Come this way!

626
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,000
He hurries to greet his princess.

627
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,960
l must prepare a welcome for him.

628
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:27,320
l warn you,
tell him to do as l ask.

629
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,760
Are you all right, Parisa?

630
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,760
Oh, yes. l'm all right.

631
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,200
Restore the princess at once.

632
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,240
l will restore her
in exchange for the lamp.

633
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,840
At once.

634
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,840
The potion is already prepared.

635
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,000
Bring the princess here.

636
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,800
Give me the eggshell.

637
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,920
lf you harm her, you die.

638
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,240
l'm here, my princess.

639
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,320
And now, if you please, my lamp.

640
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,040
You shall have it
when we are safely at the ship.

641
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,800
Very well.

642
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,880
Let us go.

643
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,240
Kill. Kill him.

644
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,000
- We're trapped.
- We must summon the genie quickly.

645
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,560
From the land beyond beyond...

646
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,880
from the world past hope and fear...

647
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,880
l bid you, genie, now appear.

648
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,240
Command me, O Princess.

649
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,600
Help us escape from this cave.

650
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,640
l shall try, O Princess.

651
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,000
Hold tight, Princess.

652
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,800
- What is it, Princess?
- l remember now.

653
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,440
The genie's verse: ''lnto fiery rock
to rise you must fall.''

654
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,920
l made a promise to the genie.
This is the fiery rock.

655
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,160
And the lamp must be thrown into it
if he's ever to be set free.

656
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,000
lf we lose his help now,
we may never reach the ship alive.

657
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,520
And if the lamp is thrown
into the flaming pit...

658
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,080
he may be destroyed.

659
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,680
Still, your promise must be kept.

660
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,720
Let's go.

661
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,200
Follow!

662
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,880
Follow!

663
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,280
Kill!

664
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,160
Follow! Kill!

665
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,720
Ali!

666
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,080
- Yes, Captain.
- Man the crossbow.

667
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,360
- Take the princess to the longboat.
- Yes, Captain. Come on, Princess.

668
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,880
Hurry! Come on ! Hurry!

669
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,640
Pull !

670
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,200
Pull !

671
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,480
Follow!

672
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,240
Pull for your lives!

673
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,400
Follow! Kill!

674
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,360
Pull for your lives!

675
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,240
Farewell, Colossa.

676
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,720
l'm only sad about one thing.

677
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,080
l shall miss Harufa.

678
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,960
And l'll never forget
our little friend Barani.

679
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,000
- Barani?
- Oh, his one wish...

680
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,160
was to sail the seas with you.

681
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,920
- You called for Barani? l am here.
- Why, it's the genie.

682
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,840
No longer the genie, Captain,
but your cabin boy.

683
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,600
Then you must prepare my cabin
for a feast of celebration.

684
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,560
l already have, Captain.

685
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,560
See for yourself.

686
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,600
Why, it's the treasure
of the Cyclops.

687
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,840
l put it on board for you...

688
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,200
as sort of a wedding present.

689
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:42,360
Well done, Barani. l know you will be
as good a sailor as you were a genie.

690
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:46,040
l shall try, Captain.
