1
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:24,600
Hey, what'd you got under there?
You ready for a race?

2
00:01:25,463 --> 00:01:26,525
Come on.

3
00:01:37,342 --> 00:01:38,419
Come on.

4
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:42,766
- Please.
- Come on, let's go!

5
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:04,969
Come on, faster... faster.

6
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,731
Sorry, gentlemen, this whole area is closed
for weapons-test for the next 24 hours...

7
00:02:57,732 --> 00:02:59,699
that includes all on-base personnel.

8
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,848
Good afternoon, Sir.

9
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,086
I'm afraid that goes for you too, Colonel,
Sir... the Pentagon send out reply's...

10
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:34,743
(Shouting Orders in Russian)

11
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,930
Russians.

12
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,884
- This ain't gonna be easy.
- Not as easy as it used to be.

13
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,453
Well, we've been in for worse.

14
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,489
- Yeah... when?
- Flensburg, there was twice as many.

15
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,932
- We were younger.
- Us? I am young.

16
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,222
We had guns.

17
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:57,079
Put your hands down, will you,
you're embarrassing us.

18
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,363
I bet you 400 bucks, we'll get
out of this.

19
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:10,923
Oh... let's go at a 100.

20
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,935
You can go in that building, yes?

21
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:26,482
Drop dead.

22
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:36,356
I'm sorry... I meant
drop dead, Comrade.

23
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:56,030
- Where was he found?
- In Mexico.

24
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:59,278
They were digging in the dirt,
looking for this stuff.

25
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,906
You're not from around here, are you?

26
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,954
Where that you would imagine,
I am from?

27
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,978
Dr. Jones...

28
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:16,068
Well, the way you sink in your teeth in
does wobblys, I should think maybe...

29
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,468
- eastern Ukraine.
- Hi, you're smart.

30
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:23,596
Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.

31
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:27,992
Three times, I have received
Order of Lenin.

32
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,678
Also medal as Hero,
of Socialist labor.

33
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,400
And why?

34
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:36,807
Because I know things.

35
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:39,353
I know them before any one else.

36
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:43,413
And what I do not know,
I find out.

37
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:50,182
And what I need to know now...
is in here.

38
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:07,765
- You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
- Ouch...

39
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,532
So, we will do this... what is expression?
"Old-fashioned way".

40
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:17,813
You will tell us, you'll help us
find what we seek.

41
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:19,813
- The door is all set.
- Open it.

42
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,353
This warehouse... is where
you and your government...

43
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:43,653
have hidden all of your secrets, yes?

44
00:07:43,654 --> 00:07:48,654
This is a military warehouse...
I've never been here before in my life.

45
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:52,987
Object we seek, rectangular
storage container, dimension...

46
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:55,587
2 meters by one 1/2 meter
by 66 centimeters.

47
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:58,936
Contents of box!
Mummified remains.

48
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,923
This is not what you know, do you?

49
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:05,756
What makes you think, I've got any
idea what box you're talking about?

50
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:11,019
Because 10 years ago, you were
part of the team that examined it.

51
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:17,533
Look... even if I knew...
what you were talking about...

52
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:22,915
You will help us to find it.

53
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,446
Compass...
I need a compass.

54
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:37,209
I know... North, South, East.

55
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,348
West.

56
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:42,662
No compass?

57
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:45,861
I need your bullets!

58
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:48,837
He wants to have my bullets.

59
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:57,008
The contents of that box,
are highly magnetised.

60
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,816
I need gunpowder.
You want my help... or not?

61
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:18,488
Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones.
What is the point of all this?

62
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:21,920
If it's still magnetic,
the metal in this gunpowder...

63
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,518
should point the way.

64
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:53,866
It's working.

65
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:57,115
Shelfes...
Give me some shot-gun shelfes.

66
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:01,847
Pliers.

67
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:41,847
- He found it.
- (Shouting in Russian)

68
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:58,847
Let's get the box, carefully...
Let's go... let's go...

69
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,547
Load it in the jeep.

70
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,975
- What is it?
- Step aside.

71
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:12,475
Oh my lord... I want to know...

72
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,175
Drop the guns, or Colonel
Dr. Spalko is death.

73
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,737
Why, Mac?

74
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:48,236
Well, what can I say, Jonesy?

75
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:50,679
I'm a capitalist.

76
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,819
And they pay.

77
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,564
After all those years, we spent
spying on the reds...

78
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:01,214
I thought we were friends, Mac.

79
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,320
There is no will
lucky cards maybe, mate.

80
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:08,240
All four... I need all four.

81
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:11,995
I can't go home, empty-handed again.

82
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:16,474
Any defined last words, Dr. Jones?

83
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:19,567
I like Ike.

84
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,125
Put down gun.

85
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:24,497
You got it, pal.

86
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:53,315
Damn...
I thought that was closer.

87
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,317
Come on... come on.

88
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:27,847
Don't get clever, Boris.
You don't know...

89
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:31,322
know him... know him! You don't
know him! You don't know him!

90
00:15:57,848 --> 00:15:59,122
Ahh...

91
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,417
You did well.

92
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,129
Hello?

93
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,200
Hello?

94
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,285
Hello?

95
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:11,235
Hey, I gotta use your telefo...

96
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,662
Wait a minute.

97
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:35,399
No, that can't be good.

98
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:40,792
"The count-down is now
1 minute to zero time"!

99
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:43,475
"Put on goggles, or turn away".

100
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:46,372
"Do not remove goggles,
or your facial protection"...

101
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:48,777
"Until 10 seconds after the first strike".

102
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:51,438
No, that can't be good at all.

103
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,672
Hey, wait.

104
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,863
Wai... wai... wai... wai... wait!

105
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:06,559
Yeah, that's just great,
don't wait for me.

106
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,743
"Minus 15 seconds".

107
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:18,911
"Minus 10 seconds".

108
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:26,411
8... 7... 6... 5...

109
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:32,911
4... 3... 2... 1...

110
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,911
Zero...

111
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,778
I had no reason to believe
the Mac was a spy.

112
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:10,173
He was MI 6, when I was in OSS.

113
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:13,235
We did 20-30 missions together
in Europe and the Pacific.

114
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:17,687
Don't wave your war-record in our
face, Colonel Jones, we all served.

115
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:20,173
No kidding?
What side were you on?

116
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:23,062
I don't think you recognize the
gravity of your situation.

117
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:28,310
You aided and abetted KBG agents,
who broke into a top-secret...

118
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:30,706
military installation, in the middle
of the United States of America.

119
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:31,901
My country.

120
00:22:31,902 --> 00:22:35,038
What was in the steel-box they took?

121
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,466
You tell us, you've seen it before.

122
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:45,544
Oh, you mean that Air-force
fiasco in 47.

123
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:49,549
I was tossed into a bus
with blacked-out windows...

124
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,187
and 20 people, I wasn't allowed
to speak to.

125
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:54,319
Hauled out in the middle of the night,
to the middle of nowhere...

126
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,416
on some urgent recovery project.

127
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,280
And shown what? Pieces of wreckage...

128
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:03,213
and an intensely magnetic shroud,
covering mutilated remains.

129
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:06,170
None of us was ever given a
full picture.

130
00:23:06,171 --> 00:23:09,030
We were threatened with treason,
if we ever talked about it.

131
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:11,066
So you tell me,
what was in the box?

132
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:12,298
Indy... Thank God.

133
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,304
Don't you know it's dangerous,
to climb into a refrigerator?

134
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:19,060
- Those things can be dead-traps.
- It's good to see you too, Don.

135
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:21,737
Relax, boys.
I can vouch for Dr. Jones.

136
00:23:21,738 --> 00:23:23,462
What the hell is going on, huh?

137
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:24,873
KGB on American soil.

138
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:26,245
Who is that woman?

139
00:23:26,246 --> 00:23:28,320
Describe her.

140
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:31,564
Tall, thin, mid 30's,
carrying a sword of some kind.

141
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:33,546
A rapier, I think.

142
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,900
Yeah, that's her.

143
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,522
You sure she's here?

144
00:23:39,523 --> 00:23:41,213
Here and gone.

145
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:42,516
Who is she?

146
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:45,933
Her name is Irina Spalko,
she's Stalins' fair-haired girl.

147
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:47,481
His favorite scientist...

148
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:49,912
if you can call psychic research, science.

149
00:23:49,913 --> 00:23:51,214
General Ross.

150
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:54,598
She's leading teams from the Kremlin,
all over the world, scooping up artifacts...

151
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,345
she thinks might have paranormal
military applications.

152
00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:58,754
General Ross.

153
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:00,089
Back off, Paul.

154
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,034
Not everyone in the army is a
commie and certainly not Indy.

155
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:08,295
What exactly I might be accused of,
besides surviving a nuclear blast?

156
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:09,809
Nothing yet.

157
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,297
But frankly, your association with
George McHale makes all your activities...

158
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:16,395
suspicious, including those
during the war.

159
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:18,239
Are you nuts?

160
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:21,751
You have any idea, how many
medals, this son of a bitch won?

161
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,286
Great many, I'm sure.

162
00:24:24,287 --> 00:24:27,255
But does he deserve them?

163
00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:31,717
Dr. Jones, let's just say for now,
you are of interest to the bureau.

164
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:35,004
Of great interest.

165
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:47,745
Where you can also see Scalbrade,
on the west-coast of Scotland.

166
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:51,148
Scalbrade is from 3100 BC...

167
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:54,774
and was continuously occupied
for 600 years, until it was...

168
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:57,185
apparently abandond in 2500 BC.

169
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:59,027
There's no clear evidence, is to why...

170
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:02,869
it's occupends desited to abandon
a perfectly healthy environment...

171
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,990
Yes?

172
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:06,529
May I have a moment, Professor?

173
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:07,850
Yes.

174
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:10,412
Huh... open up Michaelson, and
read chapter 4, when I come back...

175
00:25:10,413 --> 00:25:15,195
we'll discuss the difference
between migration and exodus.

176
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,650
What?

177
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,841
You have no idea the pressure
coming from the board of regents.

178
00:25:24,842 --> 00:25:27,148
The FBI showed up this morning,
ransacked your office.

179
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:28,795
Searched all your files.

180
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:31,402
You're the Dean of the college,
why didn't you stopped them?

181
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:33,891
- They have no right.
- They had every right.

182
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:35,120
They weren't vandals.

183
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:37,645
They were Federal-agents with
search warrants.

184
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:40,727
The university isn't getting itself
embroiled in that kind of controversy.

185
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:43,157
Not in these charged times.

186
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,175
So, you're firing me?

187
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:49,181
A leave of absence, is all.

188
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:50,829
A definite leave of absence.

189
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,127
You are firing me.

190
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,321
During which they agreed to continue
to pay your full salary, until...

191
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,538
I don't want their money.

192
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,170
Please, don't be foolish.

193
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:01,962
You don't know what I had to go
through, to get that for you.

194
00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:03,223
You went through?

195
00:26:03,224 --> 00:26:05,522
What exactly did you have
to go through, Charlie?

196
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,022
Henry...

197
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:11,013
I resigned.

198
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:20,277
Where will you go?

199
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:22,403
Train to New York.

200
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:25,880
Overnight to London, for starts.

201
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,108
I might end up teaching in Leipzig.

202
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:30,650
Heinrich owes me a favor.

203
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:32,370
I'll wire you when I get settled.

204
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:34,052
You can send me
the rest of my things.

205
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:36,123
I suppose there's nothing
to keep you here?

206
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:37,807
I barely recognize this
country any more.

207
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:41,314
The government got us seeing
Communists in our soup.

208
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:45,769
When hysteria reaches academics,
then it's time to call in that career.

209
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,735
How did Deirdre take the news?

210
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:50,227
How does any wife take
such things...

211
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:53,527
The look on her face, was a
combination of pride and panic.

212
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,577
I never should have doubted
you, my friend.

213
00:26:56,578 --> 00:27:01,151
Well, you have reason to question
your friends these days.

214
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,887
A brutal couple'a years,
huh... Charlie?

215
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,925
First dad, then Marcus.

216
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:15,926
It seems we've reached the age
where lives stops giving us things...

217
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:19,149
and starts taking them away.

218
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:24,270
Just another half glass.

219
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,148
Hey!

220
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,848
Hey, old man!

221
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,052
Professor... hello?

222
00:28:29,053 --> 00:28:32,976
- Hey! You Dr. Jones?
- You're running out of platform, kid?

223
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:36,874
- Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley?
- Harold Oxley, the Archaeologist?

224
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,805
- Yeah.
- What about him?

225
00:28:39,526 --> 00:28:41,853
They're gonna kill'm.

226
00:28:44,185 --> 00:28:47,928
I haven't talked to
Harold Oxley in 20 years.

227
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:51,240
- He's a brilliant guy.
- Uh'hm.

228
00:28:51,544 --> 00:28:54,071
He puts you to sleep, just by talking.

229
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:57,201
Yeah, when I was a kid,
that's how I went to sleep.

230
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,760
Oxleys' voice was better,
than a glass of warm milk.

231
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:03,330
My name is Mutt... Mutt Williams.

232
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:04,479
- Mutt?
- Yeah.

233
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,711
What kind of name is that?

234
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,597
This is what I have chosen,
is this a problem here?

235
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:10,476
Take it easy.

236
00:29:10,477 --> 00:29:13,058
What was your relationship with Oxley?

237
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,626
My dad died in the war.

238
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,601
Ox kind'a helped my mom,
raise me.

239
00:29:18,043 --> 00:29:20,915
You're saying, somebody's
gonna kill him?

240
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:26,448
Six months ago, my mom
gets a letter from the Ox.

241
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:28,609
He's down in Peru.

242
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,830
He found some kind of skull.

243
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:30,979
A crystal skull.

244
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,641
The one that this guy Mitchell Hodgkins?
Hedgkins? The one he found.

245
00:29:38,374 --> 00:29:42,452
Ox and I were obsessed with the
Mitchell Hedges skull in college.

246
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:43,814
How do you know about it?

247
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,103
Are you kidding?

248
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:47,336
That's all he talked about, he talked about
that thing, till the cows came home.

249
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:48,973
What is it, some kind of idle?

250
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:52,286
A carving Meso-American.

251
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:57,005
There're a number of crystal skulls in the
world, I saw one in a British Museum.

252
00:29:57,168 --> 00:30:01,074
Interesting crafts-man-ship,
but... that's about it.

253
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:03,967
Well, go laugh if you want...
Ox said, he found it this time.

254
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,910
He said this one's real and he's off
to a place called Akator with it.

255
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:09,093
Akator?

256
00:30:09,094 --> 00:30:10,210
- He said that?
- Yeah.

257
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:11,729
- You sure?
- That's what he said...

258
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,324
he said Akator, what is it?

259
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:17,637
It is a mythical, lost city,
in the Amazon.

260
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:21,159
Conquistedores' called it "El Dorado".

261
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,797
Supposedly the Puga-tribe were
chosen by their god 7000 years ago...

262
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:29,248
to build a giant city, out of solid gold.

263
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:36,852
With aqueducts, paved roads, technology
that wouldn't be seen again, for 5000 years.

264
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:42,744
Francisco de Arellano disappeared in
the Amazon, looking for it in 1546.

265
00:30:42,745 --> 00:30:46,242
I almost died of Typhus,
looking for it myself.

266
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,439
- I don't think it exists.
- Why would Ox wanna take the skull there?

267
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:57,564
Well, legend says, that a crystal skull was
stolen from Akator in the 15 or 16 century.

268
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:01,263
And that whoever returns
the skull to the city temple...

269
00:31:01,264 --> 00:31:03,563
we'll be given control over it's power.

270
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:05,571
Power? Right, so, there is
some kind of power?

271
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,256
What's the power?

272
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:10,722
I don't know, kid.
It's just a story.

273
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:17,151
With those letters my mom thought, the Ox
was off his rocker, he has smog in the noggin...

274
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:18,372
So she goes down there to find him...

275
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:20,220
but he's already been kidnapped.

276
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:22,449
Now they got her too.

277
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,671
Now Ox said, he hid
that skull some place...

278
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:27,089
now if my mom don't come up
with it, they would kill'm both.

279
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,646
Now she said, you'd help me.

280
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:32,771
- Me? What's your moms' name again?
- Mary.

281
00:31:32,772 --> 00:31:36,247
- Mary Williams, remember her?
- I met a lot'a Mary's, kid.

282
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:38,265
Shut up, that's my mother
you're talking about!

283
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:40,269
Alright? It's my mother.

284
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,280
You don't have to get sore all the time,
just to proof how tough you are.

285
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:46,001
Sit down, please sit down.

286
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:49,616
It's gonna be fun,
to find the skull with you.

287
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:54,183
I think you're some type... like a...
grave-robber or something.

288
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:57,114
I'm a 10 year Professor of Archaeology.

289
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,311
Oh.. you're a teacher?

290
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:01,436
Well, that's gonna be a big help.

291
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:03,669
Anyway, she called me 2 weeks
ago, from South America...

292
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,331
she said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.

293
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:08,184
She said she just gotten
a letter from the Ox...

294
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:09,910
and mailed it to me,
so I can give it to you.

295
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,165
Then the line went dead.

296
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,011
I opened it, I mean... it's
pointless though...

297
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:16,442
it's gibberish, it's not
even English lettering.

298
00:32:16,606 --> 00:32:18,115
See?

299
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:21,383
You see those 2 bricks' over there?

300
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:22,881
At the counter.

301
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:25,601
I don't think they're here
for the milk-shakes.

302
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:27,322
Who are they?

303
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:30,413
I don't know, maybe FBI?...

304
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:32,506
Come quietly, Dr. Jones.

305
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:34,108
Make that KGB.

306
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:35,662
And bring letter with you.

307
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,562
Letter? What letter?

308
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:38,851
The letter, Mr. Williams just give you.

309
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:40,665
Me?
Do I look like a mail-man?

310
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,645
We'll not ask again!
Come now...

311
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:44,709
- Or what?
- Nice try, kid...

312
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,725
but I think, you just brought
a knife...

313
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:50,812
to a gunfight.

314
00:32:50,813 --> 00:32:53,126
Outside, now!

315
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:58,700
- Hit this guy.
- Who?

316
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:00,715
- Some college kid, hit'm hard.
- Can't help this.

317
00:33:00,716 --> 00:33:01,940
What?

318
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:05,122
That's my boyfriend!

319
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:09,435
Take it outside.

320
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:11,781
Get that greaser!

321
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,883
Your mom didn't escape,
they let her go.

322
00:33:21,884 --> 00:33:23,471
So she could mail the letter.

323
00:33:23,472 --> 00:33:25,015
- Why...
- So you could bring it to me.

324
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:26,522
And I could translate...

325
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:28,369
Come on.

326
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,543
Get on, grandms'!

327
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,943
Let's go!

328
00:33:56,021 --> 00:33:57,986
Hurry!

329
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:00,986
Go... go, go, go, go, go!

330
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:03,786
Wait...

331
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:35,967
Go!

332
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:57,967
Damn!

333
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:08,668
Don't let'm get away, hurry!
Move this thing!

334
00:35:21,545 --> 00:35:23,044
Move!

335
00:35:23,145 --> 00:35:24,644
Move!

336
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:28,858
This is crazy!
Somebody's gonna get hurt!

337
00:35:36,729 --> 00:35:39,772
Step on the damn brakes!

338
00:35:56,672 --> 00:35:58,532
Turn here, go left!

339
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:08,618
Back! Turn around!

340
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:18,984
- Spread, spread, spread, spread!
- You're going to fast.

341
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:20,853
That's a matter of opinion.

342
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,608
- Excuse me, Dr. Jones.
- Yes?

343
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:39,564
Um... I just had a question on
Hargroves' enormative culture model.

344
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:40,964
Forget Hargrove...

345
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,682
read Vere Gordon Child,
under divisionism.

346
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:46,615
He spent most of his life in the field.

347
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:49,723
If you want to be
a good Archaeologist...

348
00:36:50,514 --> 00:36:53,767
You gotta get out of the library.

349
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:03,307
- Who is that?
- Francisco de Orellana, the Conquistador.

350
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:07,194
Remember the guy that got lost,
looking for the skull? And...

351
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:11,429
just as I thought...
Quioma.

352
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:16,031
- What's that?
- It's an extinct Latin American language.

353
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:19,552
Pre Colombian syllabic based and...

354
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:23,440
you see, the diagonastic frames on
the ideogram, it's defently Quioma.

355
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,990
You speak it?

356
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:29,070
Nobody speaks it, it hasn't been
heard a live in 3000 years.

357
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:34,142
I might be able to read it, if I
walk it through the Mayan first.

358
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:36,922
You know, for an old man,
you ain't bad in a fight.

359
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,631
That means a lot.

360
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:41,538
What? You're like 80?

361
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:46,072
It's a riddle.

362
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:50,920
Leave it to Ox, to write a riddle
in a death language.

363
00:37:51,013 --> 00:37:55,408
Follow the lines in the earth,
only gods can read...

364
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:58,375
which lead to Orellanas' cradle...

365
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,644
guarded by the living dead.

366
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,877
He's talking about Nazca lines.

367
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:04,630
- What are those?
- Well...

368
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:07,513
Geoglifos.

369
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:10,165
Giant, ancient drawings.

370
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,606
Carved in the desert floor in Peru.

371
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:15,468
From the ground,
they don't look like anything...

372
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:17,210
but from the sky...

373
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,199
only the gods can read them...

374
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,770
because only gods, live up there.

375
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,933
Oxley's telling us...

376
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:30,514
the skull is in Nazca Peru.

377
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,446
Finally.

378
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:32,734
They saw him.

379
00:39:32,735 --> 00:39:34,756
Ox wandered in to town,
a couple of months ago.

380
00:39:34,757 --> 00:39:38,107
He acted like a mad-man, the Police
locked him up in a Sanitarium, this way.

381
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,899
I speak Spanish, but I don't understand
a word of that, what was it?

382
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,306
Quechua, a local Inca dialect.

383
00:39:43,307 --> 00:39:44,615
Where'd you learn that one?

384
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,352
- Long story.
- I got time.

385
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:49,934
I lived with Pancho Villa, a
couple of his guys spoke it.

386
00:39:49,935 --> 00:39:51,607
Bull-shit!

387
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:53,911
- You asked.
- Pancho Villa?

388
00:39:53,912 --> 00:39:55,585
Technically, I was kidnapped.

389
00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:57,189
By Pancho Villa?

390
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,605
It was a fight against Victoriano Huerta.

391
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,050
- How old were you?
- About your age.

392
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:05,560
Your parents must have had
a (?), huh?

393
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:07,792
It worked out, things were
a little tense at home.

394
00:40:07,793 --> 00:40:10,132
Yeah, me and my mom, aren't
on the best of terms either.

395
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:11,701
Treat her right, kid,
you only got one.

396
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:13,374
Sometimes, not for that long.

397
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:16,804
Well, it's not my fault, it's her, she got
peed, because I quit school, she thinks...

398
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:18,957
- I'm some kind of goof or something.
- You quit school?

399
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,282
Oh yeah, shit, tons of them.

400
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:24,363
Fancy prep-schools, teach you
how to debate, chess, fencing...

401
00:40:24,364 --> 00:40:26,806
I'm great with a blade, I just
think it is a waste of time.

402
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:30,564
- You never finished?
- No, it's just a bunch of useless skills...

403
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:33,900
dull books, I love reading, you know,
I used to read all the time, but now...

404
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:37,481
- I can think of my myself, you get me?
- What'd you do for money?

405
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:41,016
- Fix motorcycles.
- Can you do that, for rest of your live?

406
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:44,038
Maybe I will,
you see a problem with that?

407
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:46,515
No, not if that's what you love doing.

408
00:40:46,516 --> 00:40:49,307
Don't let anybody tell you different.

409
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:50,737
This is it.

410
00:40:50,738 --> 00:40:52,598
Sister.

411
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,921
She says Ox isn't here.

412
00:41:12,922 --> 00:41:15,446
She don't know where he is.

413
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:18,227
Some men came
and took him away.

414
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,155
Men with guns.

415
00:41:25,097 --> 00:41:30,270
She says he was upset, deranged, drew
pictures all over the walls of his cell.

416
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:37,271
This riddle in Ox's letter,
doesn't make any sense.

417
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:40,584
Follow the lines that only
the gods can read...

418
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,993
that leads to Orellanas' cradle.

419
00:41:42,994 --> 00:41:45,468
Cradle? Birth?

420
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,834
Orellana wasn't born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.

421
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:51,362
He was a Conquistador,
he came here for gold.

422
00:41:51,363 --> 00:41:54,722
- What happened to him?
- He disappeared along with six others...

423
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,261
their bodies were never found.

424
00:42:25,738 --> 00:42:27,926
He must've lost the mind.

425
00:42:33,749 --> 00:42:38,759
Ox, I wonder what happened?
What happened?

426
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:48,480
This is not the
Mitchell-Hedges skull.

427
00:42:48,481 --> 00:42:51,389
Look at the elongated cranium.

428
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,643
And the same word.

429
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:55,721
In different languages...

430
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:58,465
over and over again.
Returno!

431
00:42:58,466 --> 00:43:01,503
- Voltar!
- Retorno?

432
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:03,909
Return? Return where?

433
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,996
Or return what?

434
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:08,796
You mean the skull?

435
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:11,364
It seems to have been
on his mind.

436
00:43:11,365 --> 00:43:13,934
Where we're suppose
to return it too?

437
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,979
Sweep here.

438
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,280
Ox didn't mean Orellanas
birth place...

439
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:42,946
The cradle has another meaning
in Mayan.

440
00:43:42,947 --> 00:43:45,273
Literally, it means "Resting Place".

441
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:47,667
As in the "Final Resting Place".

442
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,865
Ox made Orellanas grave, with...

443
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:52,563
these drawings scratched on the floor.

444
00:43:52,971 --> 00:43:55,879
It's the cemetery, where he's buried.

445
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,772
You said Orellana vanished and
nobody ever found his grave.

446
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,993
Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did.

447
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,542
Grave-robbers will be shot.

448
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:38,092
Good thing, we're not grave-robbers.

449
00:44:45,905 --> 00:44:47,459
What're we looking for?

450
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,396
I don't know yet.

451
00:44:49,397 --> 00:44:52,974
Maybe an anti-chamber
off one of those barrows.

452
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:10,932
I think I just saw something.

453
00:45:10,933 --> 00:45:13,442
Ahh.. you're jumping at shadows.

454
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:19,626
This way down.

455
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:30,419
This way up.

456
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:57,525
Those darts are poisoned!

457
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:00,495
Stay there.

458
00:46:24,724 --> 00:46:28,182
You're... a teacher?

459
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:30,639
Part time.

460
00:46:39,887 --> 00:46:41,712
Dead End.

461
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:44,997
Maybe.

462
00:46:51,062 --> 00:46:54,496
What're you doing? Put that thing away,
give me some light over here.

463
00:47:00,702 --> 00:47:02,812
Bring it over here.

464
00:47:09,645 --> 00:47:11,822
It's just a thing.

465
00:48:10,823 --> 00:48:13,336
Dance on your on time, will you.

466
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:15,421
Well, a scorpion just stung me!
Am I gonna die?

467
00:48:15,422 --> 00:48:17,427
- How big?
- Huge.

468
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,779
- Good.
- Good?

469
00:48:19,892 --> 00:48:23,220
When it comes to scorpions,
the bigger the better.

470
00:48:23,221 --> 00:48:27,709
A small one bites you,
don't keep it to yourself.

471
00:48:47,312 --> 00:48:49,128
These skulls.

472
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:51,271
Look at those skulls, man.

473
00:48:51,272 --> 00:48:55,463
Like the drawings in Oxleys' cell.
It means we're getting closer.

474
00:48:55,464 --> 00:48:57,801
That's great.
Why is it like that?

475
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,927
Nazca Indians used to burn their
infants heads with rope...

476
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:02,977
to elongate the skull like that.

477
00:49:02,978 --> 00:49:05,335
- Why?
- Honor their gods.

478
00:49:05,336 --> 00:49:08,480
No, no, God's head is not like that.

479
00:49:08,481 --> 00:49:11,392
It depends on who your God is.

480
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:23,443
Are you going nowhere fast?

481
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:31,441
Professor, this really
is a dead-end, look!

482
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:39,241
Hey!

483
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,491
Come on, genius...
Bring your back-pack.

484
00:50:16,491 --> 00:50:18,414
This is incredible.

485
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,413
Un-real.

486
00:50:21,904 --> 00:50:24,292
Don't touch anything.

487
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:29,986
Foot-prints...
somebody's been here.

488
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:33,304
Recently...

489
00:50:35,737 --> 00:50:38,055
Two sets of prints.

490
00:50:38,709 --> 00:50:41,724
Same size, could have been
the same person twice.

491
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:44,936
Not bad, kid.

492
00:50:51,947 --> 00:50:53,739
One.

493
00:50:54,006 --> 00:50:55,927
Two.

494
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,256
Three.

495
00:50:57,257 --> 00:50:58,654
Four.
Five.

496
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,271
Six.

497
00:51:01,168 --> 00:51:03,125
Seven.

498
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,979
Orellana and his men, might have
made it out of the jungle, after all.

499
00:51:09,553 --> 00:51:11,589
Give me some light.

500
00:51:16,747 --> 00:51:19,308
You don't have a knife, do you?

501
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:48,335
- This one just died yesterday.
- It's the wrappings, that preserved him.

502
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:59,730
- What just happened?
- He's been wrapped up for 500 years.

503
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:01,826
Air doesn't agree with him.

504
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,411
Thanks.

505
00:52:14,243 --> 00:52:17,374
I don't wanna keep
borrowing yours all the time.

506
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:20,669
- That's fine.
- I just gonna put it back.

507
00:52:25,677 --> 00:52:27,959
Was this one open already?

508
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:48,881
It's him.

509
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,862
It's Orellana himself.

510
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,833
They called him "The Bullion Man".

511
00:52:58,834 --> 00:53:01,551
His lust for gold was legendary.

512
00:53:02,273 --> 00:53:04,729
It's odd...

513
00:53:06,324 --> 00:53:08,805
somebody has been here
and gone.

514
00:53:08,806 --> 00:53:13,346
They left all this...
Gold.

515
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:15,978
And all the artifacts.

516
00:53:17,683 --> 00:53:19,970
What were they looking for?

517
00:53:32,245 --> 00:53:34,762
Hold this.

518
00:53:38,145 --> 00:53:39,962
Oh my...

519
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:57,902
Un... believable.

520
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:07,849
No tool marks.

521
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:10,966
A single piece of seamless quartz.

522
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:14,249
Right across the brain.

523
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:18,784
It's not possible, even with todays
technology, which are... huh...

524
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:29,668
- Crystal is not magnetic.
- Neither is gold.

525
00:54:33,044 --> 00:54:35,821
What's is this thing?

526
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:40,009
Maybe the Nazca Indians
thought, this was their god?

527
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:44,466
- You think this is the one from...
- Akator.

528
00:54:47,814 --> 00:54:52,224
Maybe the Spaniards found the skull,
and along with this other loot...

529
00:54:52,225 --> 00:54:56,050
they're headed for their
Ships along the shore.

530
00:54:57,474 --> 00:55:00,099
Maybe the Indians caught
up with them, while...

531
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:04,763
they got to squabbling amongst
themselves, over their prize...

532
00:55:04,764 --> 00:55:09,897
killed each other off, the Indians
wrapped them up and buried them.

533
00:55:09,898 --> 00:55:13,400
A couple'a 100 years later,
Oxley shows up here...

534
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:14,973
finds the skull.

535
00:55:14,974 --> 00:55:16,630
Takes it away.

536
00:55:17,528 --> 00:55:19,675
Maybe to Akator.

537
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:25,715
- But then he returns it... here?
- Return?

538
00:55:25,716 --> 00:55:28,497
Return, what he wrote
on the walls of his cell.

539
00:55:29,742 --> 00:55:32,927
He put it back,
where he had found it.

540
00:55:32,928 --> 00:55:34,865
Why?

541
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,623
Hello, Jonesy.

542
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:03,623
Hello, Mac.

543
00:56:34,251 --> 00:56:36,597
You're lucky I turned up, Jonesy.

544
00:56:36,598 --> 00:56:38,595
Good thing, cause they were
gonna blow your brains out.

545
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:41,735
That's the, huh... third time
I saved your life.

546
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:44,249
Unshackle me,
I'll give you a big hug.

547
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,298
You had a lugger...

548
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:49,227
pointing at the place of your
skull, first time we met.

549
00:56:49,228 --> 00:56:51,230
I had the situation under control.

550
00:56:51,231 --> 00:56:55,871
- You owe me.
- What'd you owe them, huh?

551
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:57,552
After the war, when you turned...

552
00:56:57,553 --> 00:56:59,552
how many names,
did you give the Reds?

553
00:56:59,553 --> 00:57:02,648
How many good men died,
because of you?

554
00:57:02,649 --> 00:57:05,080
Eventually, they're gonna let
me out of this chair, comrade.

555
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:06,442
And when they do...

556
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:08,340
I'm gonna break your nose.

557
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,707
Comrade?

558
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:11,812
You think this is about flags?

559
00:57:11,813 --> 00:57:14,801
About you? Do you think this
is about lines on a map?

560
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:16,276
It's about money, isn't it?

561
00:57:16,277 --> 00:57:18,883
Oh... not only money.

562
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:24,485
A gigantic pile of money.

563
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:26,827
Don't worry about what
the Russians will pay.

564
00:57:26,828 --> 00:57:30,397
It's nothing compared,
to what's at Akator.

565
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,542
An entire city of gold.

566
00:57:33,543 --> 00:57:36,680
It's what the Conquistadors were after.

567
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,477
For god's sake, Jonesy!
We'll be rich.

568
00:57:39,478 --> 00:57:41,269
Richer than Howard Hughes.

569
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:43,840
Blood money, every nickel.

570
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:46,026
I need you to see the
angle here, mate!

571
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:50,361
Be smart, do the right thing,
just like in...

572
00:57:50,362 --> 00:57:53,405
like in Berlin, you know, mate.

573
00:57:53,406 --> 00:57:55,405
Just like in Berlin.

574
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:59,743
You want me to trot off, or... huh,
should we sing a song.

575
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:04,224
How fortunate of our failure
to kill you, Dr. Jones.

576
00:58:04,225 --> 00:58:07,352
You survived, to be of
service to us, once again.

577
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:10,333
Well, you know me,
always glad to help.

578
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:12,090
"Now I've become Death"...

579
00:58:12,091 --> 00:58:15,217
"The Destroyer of Worlds".

580
00:58:15,218 --> 00:58:18,654
You recognize those words?

581
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:20,832
That was your own Dr. Oppenheimer.

582
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:23,136
After he created the atomic bomb.

583
00:58:23,137 --> 00:58:26,528
- He was quoting the Hindu Bible.
- It was nuclear intimidation.

584
00:58:26,529 --> 00:58:30,917
But now the next level of
weaponry, is ours to have.

585
00:58:30,918 --> 00:58:35,307
- Yours to fear.
- Weapon? What weapon?

586
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:37,235
A mind weapons.

587
00:58:37,236 --> 00:58:41,978
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

588
00:58:43,793 --> 00:58:47,885
Now, I know why Oxley, put the
skull back where he found it.

589
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:51,744
- He knew, you were looking for it.
- The skull is no mere devinity carving.

590
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:54,073
Surely you knew that, as soon
as you laid eyes on it.

591
00:58:54,074 --> 00:58:58,775
- It was not made by human hands.
- Who made it then?

592
00:59:01,533 --> 00:59:03,417
Come on...

593
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:07,011
The body we found in
New Mexico was not the first.

594
00:59:07,012 --> 00:59:11,063
We already dissected 2 others, from
similar crash-sites in Soviet Union.

595
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:13,092
Saucer-men from Mars?

596
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:15,288
The legends about Akator,
are all true.

597
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,678
Early man could not have
conceived it, much less built it.

598
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,927
It was a city, of superior beings.

599
00:59:19,928 --> 00:59:23,161
With technology and
paranormal abilities.

600
00:59:23,162 --> 00:59:25,651
You gotta be kidding me!

601
00:59:25,652 --> 00:59:28,896
Maybe you choose one,
to believe your own eyes?

602
00:59:32,142 --> 00:59:33,727
The New Mexico specimen,
gave us hope.

603
00:59:33,728 --> 00:59:40,285
Unlike the others we found,
this skeleton was pure crystal.

604
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,542
A distant cousin perhaps...

605
00:59:42,543 --> 00:59:44,975
maybe that too,
was sent to find Akator.

606
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:49,399
Perhaps, we're all searching
for the same thing.

607
00:59:51,112 --> 00:59:53,534
There is no other explanation.

608
00:59:53,535 --> 00:59:55,561
There's always another explanation.

609
00:59:55,562 --> 00:59:59,225
The skull was stolen from
Akator in the 15th century.

610
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:02,382
- Whoever returns...
- Returns it to the city-temple...

611
01:00:02,383 --> 01:00:06,237
will gain control over it's powers,
I heard that bedtime story before.

612
01:00:06,238 --> 01:00:09,907
It's a legend, why do you
think Akator even existed?

613
01:00:09,908 --> 01:00:11,737
You should ask your
friend that question.

614
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:14,332
- Bring in the professor!
- We're certain, he's been there.

615
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:17,846
Oxley.

616
01:00:22,233 --> 01:00:25,346
- Hey.
- Aren't you coming?

617
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:35,056
Ox! It's me, Indy.

618
01:00:35,057 --> 01:00:37,060
Ox?

619
01:00:39,016 --> 01:00:40,962
You're faking it, right?

620
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:43,662
"Through eyes at last
I saw in tears".

621
01:00:43,663 --> 01:00:45,872
Ox! Listen to me, pal.

622
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:48,944
Your name is Harold Oxley.
You were born in Leeds, England.

623
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,778
You and I went to school togather,
at the University of Chicago.

624
01:00:51,779 --> 01:00:54,086
And you are never this interesting.

625
01:00:54,087 --> 01:00:56,586
My name is Indi...

626
01:00:56,587 --> 01:01:00,526
My name is Henry Jones, Jr.

627
01:01:00,934 --> 01:01:02,028
What have you done to him?

628
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:04,354
We ain't done a thing,
It's probably the skull.

629
01:01:04,355 --> 01:01:07,145
He is the divining role,
that will lead us to Akator.

630
01:01:07,146 --> 01:01:10,041
But we need some one
to interpret him for us.

631
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:12,967
His mind it seams is quite weak...

632
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:15,766
Let's hope yours is stronger.

633
01:01:17,658 --> 01:01:22,177
The skull crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain...

634
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,327
opening the psychic channel.

635
01:01:24,328 --> 01:01:28,525
Oxley lost control of his mind,
by staring to long into it's eyes.

636
01:01:28,526 --> 01:01:30,718
We believe, you can
get through to him...

637
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:32,937
after you have done the same.

638
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,762
I got a better idea, you look at it.

639
01:01:35,763 --> 01:01:39,123
The skull does not speak
to everyone, it seams.

640
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:42,783
Surely you're not afraid, Dr. Jones?

641
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:45,890
You spent your entire life,
looking for answers.

642
01:01:45,891 --> 01:01:48,642
Think of the truth, behind those eyes.

643
01:01:48,643 --> 01:01:51,357
There maybe hundreds
of skulls at Akator.

644
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:52,660
The one who finds them...

645
01:01:52,661 --> 01:01:57,788
will control the greatest natural
force, the world has ever known.

646
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:01,332
Power over the mind of men.

647
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:05,224
Be carefull, you might get
exactly what you wished for.

648
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:07,843
I usually do.

649
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,551
Imagine...

650
01:02:42,552 --> 01:02:46,143
to peer across the world and
know the enemy's secrets.

651
01:02:46,144 --> 01:02:49,567
To place all our thoughts,
into the minds of your leaders'.

652
01:02:49,568 --> 01:02:52,680
Make your teachers, teach the
true version of the history.

653
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:55,001
Make your soldiers attack,
on our command.

654
01:02:55,002 --> 01:02:58,253
We'll be everywhere, at once,
more powerfull than a whisper.

655
01:02:58,254 --> 01:03:03,031
Invading your dreams, thinking your
thoughts for you, while you sleep.

656
01:03:04,712 --> 01:03:07,991
We will change you, Dr. Jones.

657
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:11,025
Always, from the inside.

658
01:03:11,026 --> 01:03:13,885
We will turn you, into us.

659
01:03:13,886 --> 01:03:19,302
And the best part... you wont
even know, it's happening.

660
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:22,555
Return.

661
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:27,101
Return.

662
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:32,626
That's enough.

663
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,068
That's enough, if he dies
we can't no joy of him.

664
01:03:38,141 --> 01:03:40,321
Cover it.

665
01:03:43,772 --> 01:03:46,221
Henry.

666
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,679
What, Jonesy?

667
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:55,382
He broke my nose!

668
01:03:55,383 --> 01:03:56,677
- I told you...
- Enough!

669
01:03:56,678 --> 01:04:00,562
You will speak to Oxley,
and lead us to Akator, yes?

670
01:04:00,563 --> 01:04:02,342
Njet.

671
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:05,190
Take him outside!

672
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,738
You all right, kid?

673
01:04:10,739 --> 01:04:12,137
They left my bike at the cemetery.

674
01:04:12,138 --> 01:04:14,934
- Yeah, but you're alright?
- They left my bike!

675
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,675
Wough, wo, wo!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

676
01:04:18,445 --> 01:04:19,881
Uh'huh...

677
01:04:26,057 --> 01:04:27,666
I'm ready.

678
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:29,870
Don't give these pigs a thing!

679
01:04:29,871 --> 01:04:31,759
- You heard'm.
- Hm'mm...

680
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,256
Clearly I have chosen
the wrong pressure point.

681
01:04:35,257 --> 01:04:37,878
Perhaps I can find
a more sensitive one.

682
01:04:37,879 --> 01:04:39,312
Get the woman!

683
01:04:39,313 --> 01:04:44,255
Get your hands off me!
You rotten Ruskie son of a bitch!

684
01:04:46,903 --> 01:04:49,922
Indiana Jones.

685
01:04:52,812 --> 01:04:54,946
- About time you showed up.
- Mom!

686
01:04:54,947 --> 01:04:57,708
- Sweet-heart.
- Mom?

687
01:04:57,709 --> 01:04:59,457
What're you doing here?

688
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:00,893
Forget about me.
Are you all right?

689
01:05:00,894 --> 01:05:04,530
- Mom?
- I specificly told you, not to come!

690
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:06,915
- You mean Marion...
- No you didn't, you never wrote that...

691
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:09,960
- or said that, in any of your phone-calls.
- Marion Ravenwood is your mother?

692
01:05:09,961 --> 01:05:13,232
Oh... for god's sake, Indy,
it's not that hard.

693
01:05:13,233 --> 01:05:15,330
I know... I mean... I just...
I never thought...

694
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:17,355
I would have a life,
after you left?

695
01:05:17,356 --> 01:05:19,526
- That's not what I meant.
- Well, a damn good life.

696
01:05:19,527 --> 01:05:23,218
- Well, that's fine...
- A damn good, really good life!

697
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,668
- Well, so have I!
- Yeah?

698
01:05:24,669 --> 01:05:26,738
You still leaving a trail
of human wreckage...

699
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:28,242
or have you retired?

700
01:05:28,243 --> 01:05:32,157
- Why? You're looking for a date?
- With anybody, but you!

701
01:05:32,158 --> 01:05:35,409
So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?

702
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,125
A simple yes, will do.

703
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:40,136
Well Marion, you had to go
and get yourself kidnapped.

704
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:42,769
Not like you did any better?

705
01:05:43,596 --> 01:05:46,196
Same'o... same'o.

706
01:05:47,024 --> 01:05:50,045
Henry Jones, Jr.

707
01:05:50,941 --> 01:05:53,682
Henry Jones, Jr.

708
01:05:53,774 --> 01:05:55,646
That's right, Ox.
Listen to me...

709
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:57,446
"To lay their just
hands on that Golden key"...

710
01:05:57,447 --> 01:05:59,649
"that opens the Palace of Eternity"

711
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,050
Palace of Etern...

712
01:06:01,051 --> 01:06:03,183
It's to Milton, he said it before.
Why?

713
01:06:03,184 --> 01:06:07,484
Ox, you gotta tell us, how to get
to Akator, or they gonna kill Marion.

714
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:09,758
"Through the eyes in glass,
I saw in tears"...

715
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:12,345
"here in deaths dream Kingdom"...

716
01:06:12,346 --> 01:06:14,900
Harold, they're gonna
kill Abners little girl.

717
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:16,720
You gotta tell us, how to get there.

718
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:18,794
We need specifics...

719
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:25,495
Alright...

720
01:06:25,496 --> 01:06:27,554
get me paper and
something to write with.

721
01:06:27,555 --> 01:06:29,154
(Yelling in Russian)

722
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:42,094
Auto-writing.
I should have seen this.

723
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:50,431
- Henry Jones, Jr.
- Now write, that's right, Ox.

724
01:06:50,432 --> 01:06:54,857
"3 times it drops".
"On the way down".

725
01:06:54,858 --> 01:06:56,224
3 times.

726
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:58,155
Pictographs?

727
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,277
Ideograms.

728
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,349
Good Ox, done.

729
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,962
Ox.

730
01:07:24,963 --> 01:07:27,962
It's me, Ox.

731
01:07:27,963 --> 01:07:29,589
It's Mutt, Ox.

732
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:31,318
Hey! Look at me.

733
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:33,017
Look at me.

734
01:07:33,018 --> 01:07:35,144
It's me!

735
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:36,963
It's me.

736
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:41,620
The wavy lines mean
water, of course.

737
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:44,015
The closed eyes mean sleep.

738
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:47,933
The sun with the arc over the sky,
stands for time, duration.

739
01:07:47,934 --> 01:07:50,625
The word "now" is until.

740
01:07:50,626 --> 01:07:55,240
This 2 close together, the horizon
and the snake mean "one thought".

741
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:58,805
The horizon stood for "the world",
but it didn't mean the earth...

742
01:07:58,806 --> 01:07:59,995
it meant big or great.

743
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:06,923
The water sleeps
until the great snake.

744
01:08:06,924 --> 01:08:09,162
These aren't just drawings,
they're directions...

745
01:08:09,163 --> 01:08:11,038
get me a map.

746
01:08:14,444 --> 01:08:16,702
The great snake is
the Amazon of course...

747
01:08:16,703 --> 01:08:19,866
but sleep... what water sleeps?

748
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:21,666
(Yelling in Russian)

749
01:08:22,872 --> 01:08:24,517
Here...

750
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:27,140
"Sono", a Portuguese word for sleep.

751
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:29,984
Yes, good... exactly.

752
01:08:30,616 --> 01:08:35,781
He wants us to follow
this curve, the Sono...

753
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:38,716
down to where it meets
the Amazon, to the southeast.

754
01:08:38,717 --> 01:08:40,799
After that I'm not sure.

755
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,842
Kingdom of dreams,
tears in eyes.

756
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:45,466
I have no idea, what he means.

757
01:08:45,467 --> 01:08:46,680
This could be the route though...

758
01:08:46,681 --> 01:08:49,780
it's completely unexplored
part of the Amazon.

759
01:08:53,406 --> 01:08:55,025
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

760
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,304
Just, what the hell
are we doing, kid?

761
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,158
- They were gonna kill us.
- Well, maybe.

762
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:06,520
Well, we had to do something.

763
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:07,606
Something else,
would have been good.

764
01:09:07,607 --> 01:09:09,044
At least I got us away.

765
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:12,629
- That's intolerable.
- Harold for god sake, keep up!

766
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:16,829
(Talking and Screaming in Russian)

767
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:21,564
Hello, mom!

768
01:09:21,565 --> 01:09:22,992
- Stay there!
- Stop!

769
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:24,531
Stop, stop, don't move!

770
01:09:24,532 --> 01:09:26,036
Movement makes space,
space will make you sink.

771
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,504
No, I think I can get out...
If I just...

772
01:09:27,505 --> 01:09:28,929
Stop it, your pulling,
will get you back in...

773
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:31,214
it's just like trying to lift a car,
just stay calm.

774
01:09:31,215 --> 01:09:33,463
- Okay, I'm calm.
- What is it? Quick-sand?

775
01:09:33,464 --> 01:09:34,870
- I'm calm.
- No, it's a dry-sand.

776
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:37,063
- I'm sinking, but I'm calm.
- Quick-sand is a mixture of sand...

777
01:09:37,064 --> 01:09:40,063
mud and water, and depending on
the viscosity, it's not as dangeres as...

778
01:09:40,064 --> 01:09:42,894
Oh' for Pete's sake, Jones.
We're not in school.

779
01:09:42,895 --> 01:09:46,055
Don't worry, there's nothing to
worry about, unless there is a...

780
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:50,111
Void collapse.

781
01:09:50,624 --> 01:09:53,209
I'll go get something
to pull you up.

782
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:56,360
Ox, don't just sit there.
For god's sake, man.

783
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:58,039
Go get help.

784
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,139
- Help?
- Help!

785
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,956
Help!

786
01:10:01,957 --> 01:10:04,976
Help go!

787
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:08,881
Mutt, can be a little impetuous.

788
01:10:08,882 --> 01:10:11,412
Ahh... it's not the worst
quality in the world.

789
01:10:12,029 --> 01:10:15,072
Keep your arms above the surface,
when the kid comes back grap on to'm.

790
01:10:15,073 --> 01:10:16,470
Indy, he...

791
01:10:16,471 --> 01:10:20,213
He's a good kid, Marion,
get off his back about school.

792
01:10:20,214 --> 01:10:22,139
- It's not what I mean...
- Not everybody's cut out for it.

793
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:23,905
His name is Henry.

794
01:10:23,906 --> 01:10:25,907
Henry, good name.

795
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:28,339
He is your son.

796
01:10:28,748 --> 01:10:30,705
My son?

797
01:10:30,706 --> 01:10:33,586
Henry Jones, the 3rd.

798
01:10:35,742 --> 01:10:38,798
Why the hell, didn't you
make him finish school?

799
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:40,932
- Ma!
- Yeah.

800
01:10:40,933 --> 01:10:44,150
- Grab on... grab!
- I got it.

801
01:10:45,151 --> 01:10:47,551
Come on, ma!
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull!

802
01:10:48,053 --> 01:10:50,093
Pull!

803
01:10:52,493 --> 01:10:55,304
Grab on!

804
01:10:55,537 --> 01:10:57,144
Grab!

805
01:10:57,145 --> 01:10:58,371
Just grap it, Indy.

806
01:10:58,372 --> 01:11:00,085
It's a rat-snake.

807
01:11:00,086 --> 01:11:01,167
Rat-snakes aren't that big.

808
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:03,512
Well, this one is, size never
botherd you before, now grap on!

809
01:11:03,513 --> 01:11:06,799
- Go get something else.
- Like what?

810
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,022
Like... like a rope or something.

811
01:11:08,023 --> 01:11:11,638
There's no Sears and Roebuck
here, grab the snake.

812
01:11:13,059 --> 01:11:17,365
- Maybe I can touch the bottom.
- There is no bottom, now grab it!

813
01:11:17,366 --> 01:11:20,439
- I think I can feel it with my feet.
- Grab the snake.

814
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,968
Stop calling it that!

815
01:11:21,969 --> 01:11:23,589
It's a snake, what you
want me to I call it?

816
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:25,459
- Say rope.
- What?

817
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,433
Say "grab the rope"!

818
01:11:27,434 --> 01:11:30,374
- Grab the rope!
- Grab the rope!

819
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:34,742
Hold tide... it's slimy.
Come on!

820
01:11:40,971 --> 01:11:43,980
Get rid of that thing, will you!

821
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:45,202
Son.

822
01:11:45,203 --> 01:11:47,871
He's afraid of snakes.

823
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:52,384
You're one crazy old man.

824
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:58,539
Why'd you have to go and read
me outright, Jonesy? Hey?

825
01:12:01,606 --> 01:12:03,983
Good work Ox, thanks.

826
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:07,248
Help.

827
01:12:38,993 --> 01:12:42,105
No, no, he was British.

828
01:12:42,106 --> 01:12:45,665
My dad was an RAF-pilot. a war-hero,
not some school teacher.

829
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:48,991
No, Sweet-heart...
Colin was your step-father.

830
01:12:48,992 --> 01:12:51,445
We started dating, when you
were three months old.

831
01:12:51,446 --> 01:12:52,943
He was a good man.

832
01:12:52,944 --> 01:12:56,724
Wait... wait... wait, Colin?
As in Colin Williams?

833
01:12:56,725 --> 01:12:59,464
You married him?

834
01:12:59,465 --> 01:13:03,266
- I introduced you!
- I think you gave up your vote...

835
01:13:03,267 --> 01:13:06,993
on who I marry, when you decidet to
break it off, a week before the wedding!

836
01:13:06,994 --> 01:13:09,746
I think we both knew, Marion.
it wasn't gonna work.

837
01:13:09,747 --> 01:13:12,297
You didn't know that, why didn't
you ever talk to me about it?

838
01:13:12,298 --> 01:13:13,990
Because we never had
an argument I won.

839
01:13:13,991 --> 01:13:16,905
- It is not my fault, if you can't keep up.
- I didn't wanna hurt you!

840
01:13:16,906 --> 01:13:19,959
Oh... for love of god,
shut the hell up!

841
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:23,762
Didn't you ever wonder years ago,
why Ox stopped talking to you?

842
01:13:23,763 --> 01:13:26,978
- He hated, that you ran away.
- You two, just stop!

843
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:30,547
Yeah, Marion, let's not let the
kid see, mom and dad fight.

844
01:13:30,548 --> 01:13:31,996
You're not my dad, okay?

845
01:13:31,997 --> 01:13:34,500
You bet I am,
and I got news for you.

846
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:36,347
You're gonna go back
and finish school!

847
01:13:36,348 --> 01:13:39,690
Really? What happened to, there's
not a damn thing wrong with it, kid...

848
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:42,216
and don't let anybody else, tell you any
different, you don't remember saying that?

849
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,886
- That was before I was your father!
- You're not my father!

850
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:47,019
- Oh, yes, he is!
- You should have told me, Marion!

851
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,158
- I had a right to know.
- You vanished, after that!
