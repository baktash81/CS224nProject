1
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,609
He's inside.

2
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:55,446
- Get him!
- He's gone!

3
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:58,574
- Search the room.
- Hey, a party. Am I invited?

4
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:01,327
"John Smith,
in the name of the king,

5
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,831
you are under arrest
for treason in Jamestown."

6
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,000
Treason?
You must be looking for Ratcliffe.

7
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,426
Don't let him get away!

8
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:17,763
After him!

9
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,941
- Thanks for droppin' in.

10
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,486
Anyone else care
to join him?

11
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:34,992
Cut him off!

12
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:40,415
I've got him now!

13
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:44,128
Oh, he's jumped!

14
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:51,887
The king believed
my story.

15
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:56,851
Pity. I so would have preferred
to see you hanged.

16
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:21,797
I did everything I could
to save him.

17
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:26,219
And that is the death
of John Smith.

18
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:30,849
- I wanted him alive!
- As did I.

19
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:35,146
But, your majesty, you don't need him
to confirm what I've already told you.

20
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:39,401
We must wait until John Rolfe returns
with the chief of these Indians.

21
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:44,324
The chief will only tell you
more heathen lies. War is the only way.

22
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,662
Very well, Ratcliffe.
Prepare your armada, then.

23
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:53,000
But we will await the return
of John Rolfe... and the Indian chief.

24
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:54,518
Oh, much time has passed
since the news of John Smith's death.

25
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:57,271
Perhaps it's time
to put this behind you.

26
00:04:57,437 --> 00:05:01,776
I know you are right.
It's just hard to say goodbye.

27
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:22,954
The earth is cold
The fields are bare

28
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:28,460
The branches fold against the wind
that's everywhere

29
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:34,677
The birds move on so they survive

30
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:38,473
When snow's so deep
the bears all sleep

31
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,728
- To keep themselves alive

32
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:45,480
They do what they must
for now

33
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:49,318
And trust in their plan

34
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:54,616
If I trust in mine
somehow I might find

35
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:58,329
Who I am

36
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:03,335
But where do I go from here

37
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:06,463
So many voices

38
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,134
Ringing in my ear

39
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:12,763
Which is the voice

40
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,726
That I was meant to hear

41
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:19,854
How will I know

42
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,857
Where do I go

43
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:26,528
From here

44
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,913
My world has changed
and so have I

45
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,544
I've learned to choose
and even learned to say goodbye

46
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:43,048
The path ahead
so hard to see

47
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,302
It winds and bends
but where it ends

48
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:49,890
Depends on only me

49
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:53,143
In my heart
I don't feel part

50
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,564
Of so much I've known

51
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,692
Now it seems
it's time to start

52
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:05,407
A new life on my own

53
00:08:05,574 --> 00:08:11,415
But where do I go
from here

54
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:17,254
So many voices
ringing in my ear

55
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:20,091
Which is the voice

56
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:24,096
That I was meant to hear

57
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:26,849
How will I know

58
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:32,106
Where do I go

59
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:38,446
- From here

60
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:59,637
Ship ahoy!
Ship's coming!

61
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:02,140
Ship's coming!

62
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,400
Open the gate!

63
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:22,831
Cast a line!

64
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:25,460
Put your backs into it!
Together, men!

65
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,719
Easy left!

66
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,586
Attention!

67
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:22,025
Filthy barbarian.

68
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,378
Huh?

69
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:48,390
Whoa, boy!
Steady! Whoa!

70
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:05,577
Filthy savage!

71
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:21,011
No, wait!

72
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,849
- Wait!
- Stand down!

73
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:34,110
It's all right now.
I've taken care of it.

74
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,530
The settlers need to know
they can trust us to do the right thing.

75
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,452
- You should not have interfered.
- I beg your pardon?

76
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,289
All right. You have it.

77
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:48,168
- I was trying to help.
- I did not ask for your help.

78
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:50,170
Well, you didn't say
"thank you" either.

79
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:52,799
- Whatever happened to manners and etiquette?
- Well,

80
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:56,303
since you are new here
I don't expect you to have them yet.

81
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,810
Women!

82
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:13,239
I fear the Indians may wage war.

83
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:17,202
Oh, my dear,
Pocahontas would never allow that.

84
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,747
- Pocahontas?

85
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:23,417
- Hmm.
- John Rolfe, your horse, sir.

86
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:26,255
Oh, there you are.
Thank you.

87
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,969
It's time I met
this Chief Pocahontas.

88
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:19,942
Great chief,
I am John Rolfe.

89
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:23,446
According to the customs--

90
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:30,371
- How do you do?
- Let him pass.

91
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:33,875
According to the customs of Greater
Britain, I would like to present...

92
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,879
this horse as a gift of peace
to the mighty Pocahontas.

93
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:40,633
- Daughter,
- You?

94
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,221
this beast is for you.

95
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:47,307
No, I'm sorry.
It's my fault.

96
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:49,644
This horse,
it's meant for--

97
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:53,565
- Pocahontas, your king said. Or did he speak falsely?
- No!

98
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,361
Never.
It's just that-- This is--

99
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,032
No, th-this is
perfectly fine.

100
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:06,038
- Hmm. Good job, Rolfe.

101
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,505
I believe we can prosper together in this
great land under King James' gracious rule.

102
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:16,049
To build trust,
I would like you...

103
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:19,554
to sail back with me...
to meet my king.

104
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:24,434
I do not want
the pale chief's land. He wants mine.

105
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:27,396
Why doesn't he cross
the salt water to see me?

106
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:29,899
I'm afraid
that simply isn't done,

107
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:32,152
Your Grand "Chiefliness."

108
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:35,865
Your kind are barbarians.
They only want our land!

109
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:39,410
- They mean to destroy our sacred--
- Is that what they want?

110
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,581
You don't know.

111
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:46,377
Father, someone must go.

112
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:50,131
You speak with the tongue of a pale one.
You belong with them.

113
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:53,802
- Perhaps you should go.
- No!

114
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:57,307
This is a matter of diplomacy.
You can't handle a job like this.

115
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,230
- I will go.
- Daughter--

116
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:06,483
Father, please.
I can do this.

117
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:12,824
You have
your mother's spirit.

118
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:16,078
- Very well. It is decided.
- But--

119
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:20,083
Grand.

120
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:49,659
Grandmother Willow,
I need to speak with you.

121
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:56,500
Is that my Pocahontas?

122
00:15:59,838 --> 00:16:03,092
My, what is it, child?

123
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:06,846
You are concerned
about crossing the salt water.

124
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:10,266
What if I can't bring peace?
What if I'm destined to fail?

125
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,687
- What if I make things worse?
- What-What if?

126
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:18,443
- What if the sky turns to fire and your nose falls off?

127
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,616
Long ago I told you
to listen with your heart.

128
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,495
It is time
to listen to your heart.

129
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:30,665
- But the spirits around me--
- Can help,

130
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:35,045
but only the spirit within
can guide you.

131
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:41,303
Listen to the spirit within.

132
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:47,018
Listen to the spirit within.

133
00:17:19,223 --> 00:17:21,391
Grandmother Willow,
it doesn't work.

134
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,977
Grandmother Willow?

135
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:41,373
- Easy up, men!

136
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,835
Here we go.
Righto. Over here. Easy.

137
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:46,546
- To the starboard.
- Hoist away!

138
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:50,217
I will honour my vow not
to break the peace with the pale ones...

139
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,929
but we must know
their strength.

140
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:57,642
Cut a notch in this staff
for every pale face you see.

141
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,692
Watch over my daughter.

142
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:36,563
- I can't take you this time.

143
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:44,155
- Stay out of mischief and look after one another.

144
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:18,862
Do not forget this land.

145
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:20,906
You will always be with me.

146
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:01,162
Wait. What's this?

147
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:03,790
This is Uttamatomakkin.

148
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:06,335
- Well, is Uttama-- Uttamakk--

149
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:08,629
Is he coming with us?
Are you coming with us?

150
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:11,632
I say, are you--
Hello? Can you hear me?

151
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,843
- Can he-- Can he hear me?

152
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,230
Oh yes, of course.
This was a good idea, wasn't it?

153
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,109
This will be fine!
Fantastic.

154
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:29,320
- All hands on deck!

155
00:20:29,486 --> 00:20:31,322
Anchor ahoy!

156
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,162
- Undo the sails!
- Aye, sir!

157
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:45,839
Ah-nah, Father.

158
00:21:56,254 --> 00:22:00,927
All right, of course, yes.
Swab the deck. Swab the deck.

159
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:06,267
I mean that's all we do
around here.

160
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:10,605
It's always clean anyway. I mean,
what are we swabbing the deck for?

161
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:13,900
It looks clean to me down here.
I don't see any dirt.

162
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:19,324
Swabbing the deck--
I'm swabbing!

163
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:23,912
- Did anybody notice I'm swabbing?

164
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:32,464
Hey! Hey!
What is that? What's goin'--

165
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:36,135
-Get him! That's it!

166
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:38,471
- Uh!
- Doh!

167
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:52,988
Oh, Meeko! What are you doing here?

168
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:09,382
What's all this then?

169
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:12,844
Look, missy, I don't
cotton to stowaways,

170
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:15,222
and I'll not have you
disruptin' my crew.

171
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:18,351
You can take
this voyage below...

172
00:23:19,852 --> 00:23:22,439
or in the brig.

173
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:26,360
- You're-- - A guest of the king,
and is to be treated as such.

174
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:28,738
Am I clear, Captain?

175
00:23:30,156 --> 00:23:34,161
Wh-Why would you do that?

176
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:36,622
Because, like it or not,
you are the envoy...

177
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,541
and I am honour-bound
to protect you.

178
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:43,422
And honour, Pocahontas,
is the backbone of our civilization.

179
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,551
Thank you.

180
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:26,806
Land ho!

181
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:35,357
Full sails!

182
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:09,606
Heave ho!
Keep 'em taut. Here we go.

183
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,782
Welcome to London.

184
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,970
Shall we?

185
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:38,181
Suit yourself.

186
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:54,742
The sun comes up, the lamps go down

187
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:57,704
The day begins
in London town

188
00:25:57,871 --> 00:26:00,875
- There's tea to brew
- And buns to bake

189
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:04,170
And some who just refuse to wake

190
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:06,881
While shops are stocked
and flocks are fed

191
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:09,176
The midnight men
drift home to bed

192
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:11,720
School bells chime
and church bells ring

193
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:16,184
Children whine
Peddlers sing

194
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:20,022
What a day in London
Come and see who's here

195
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,358
Everyone knows someone

196
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:24,402
They've come
from far and near

197
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:26,571
They bring their geese
Their finest fleece

198
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:28,698
To please the keenest eye

199
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:31,035
And hope and pray
someone will say

200
00:26:31,202 --> 00:26:33,412
There's something
they might buy

201
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:36,875
- Pocahontas, wait!

202
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,253
With pigs to slop
and fish to gut

203
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,380
It ain't exactly heaven but

204
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:43,591
We thank the Lord
and kiss the ground

205
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:45,885
For bed and board
in London town

206
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:48,013
The upper crust
lie fast asleep

207
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,099
But some of us
got floors to sweep

208
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:52,393
One day's like the day before

209
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,398
- Can't complain
- If there's no war

210
00:26:56,565 --> 00:27:00,194
What a day in London
Everything's for sale

211
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,446
Cabbages and onions

212
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:06,910
- Look up!
- Who's that That girl up in the tree

213
00:27:07,077 --> 00:27:09,247
It's not a tree
It's moving, see

214
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:12,625
- Good grief what can it be
- Look there, I swear

215
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,627
- She's flying through the air

216
00:27:14,794 --> 00:27:16,713
She must be wild

217
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,132
- She's just a child
- Pocahontas--

218
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,636
I wish I had her hair

219
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:24,973
Wouldn't you care to join me, here?
On the ground? This instant?

220
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,477
My heart is pounding like a drum
I can't believe my eyes

221
00:27:28,644 --> 00:27:32,315
- In London people seem to come in every shape and size

222
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:36,319
- So many paths, I wonder how they find their way

223
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:41,993
So many signs, I wonder
what they really say

224
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,165
London is everything
I've heard and more

225
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:51,004
London is nothing
like I've seen before

226
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,591
Music and feathered hats
and roofs that shine

227
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:58,179
With flags flying higher
than a pine

228
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,347
She seems so sweet
she means us well

229
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:02,475
- Size 20 feet
- How can you tell

230
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,477
We'll rue this day
You wait and see

231
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:07,189
What is to be
or not to be

232
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:11,194
How do they build
their huts so tall

233
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:13,863
Can this be all one tribe
The things they sell

234
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,741
The things I smell
I never could describe

235
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:20,205
These cakes taste just like
berries picked this very day

236
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:23,625
The sound a river makes
still takes my breath

237
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:27,046
Away

238
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:31,843
London's as busy
as a hive of bees

239
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,389
Grandmother Willow would
just love these trees

240
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:39,059
Crowded and loud
but so exciting too

241
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:42,522
With colours
I never even knew

242
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:46,234
What a day in London
Nothing strange at all

243
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:50,406
'Cept a girl with someone
maybe ten feet tall

244
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:53,910
This day's become a day
no one is likely to forget

245
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:57,582
A day we'll all remember as
the day two worlds have met

246
00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:01,378
- London is everything I've heard and more
- Such beauty's rare.

247
00:29:01,545 --> 00:29:03,213
- London is nothing
- The strength of ten, I've heard.

248
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:05,257
- Like I've seen before
- She's won the men, my word!

249
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:06,925
- A brave young thing, to venture here.
- Music and feathered hats

250
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:09,011
- And roofs that shine
- It will be an adventure.

251
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:11,013
- And flags flying higher
- Perhaps some brew to quench your thirst?

252
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,766
- Than a pine
- But not with you-- I saw her first!

253
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:16,436
What a day in London
History was made

254
00:29:16,603 --> 00:29:20,233
Take away the mystery
then you're not afraid

255
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,903
- We've seen a girl
- I've seen a world

256
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,574
- I never dreamed I'd see
-We never dreamed we'd see

257
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:31,121
- And what an extra special day Unique in truly every way
- Unique in truly every way

258
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:33,623
How wonderful this London day

259
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,629
Turned out to be

260
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:01,155
You!

261
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:07,371
Well done, Rolfe,
bringing back a heathen as an example.

262
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:10,792
Look at her.
She sticks out like a sore thumb.

263
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:13,503
Pocahontas is here as
an emissary of her people.

264
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,132
- A personal guest of the king.
- The king has appointed me...

265
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,175
to lead an armada
against the savages.

266
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:22,847
Don't tell me you didn't know?
The king wants his gold.

267
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:26,560
- There is no gold.
- Another barbarian lie.

268
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:29,314
As soon as the ships
are armed, I set sail...

269
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:33,402
to destroy the heathens
and reclaim Jamestown for James.

270
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:41,662
We must stop him!
Warn your king of his lies!

271
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:45,833
But he wasn't lying.
The parchment bore the king's seal.

272
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,380
What? Then your king's promise
to meet me was the lie.

273
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:54,218
- A king doesn't lie!
- They cannot both be true.

274
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:58,223
No. It-It's just a misunderstanding.
It has to be.

275
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:02,561
I can straighten this out.
Come on.

276
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:13,240
Are you riding or running?

277
00:31:33,764 --> 00:31:35,933
- Mrs Jenkins!

278
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,773
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Gads-me-gracious, is that my Johnny?

279
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,949
Eww!

280
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:53,329
Eww, Johnny,
you need a bath.

281
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:56,583
- Oh, oh, Johnny!
- Look at you.

282
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:05,218
- Oh, you.
- Mrs Jenkins, I would like to introduce Pocahontas.

283
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:07,470
Pocahontas, Mrs Jenkins.

284
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:09,932
The Jenkinses have been
with the Rolfes for generations.

285
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:13,185
- Careful. She's about to put on some tea.
- I'll put on some tea.

286
00:32:13,352 --> 00:32:15,187
Oh! Ooh.

287
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:20,110
Oh, and Uttamatomakkin.

288
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:25,324
Ooh, I'll put on
lots and lots of tea.

289
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:28,661
- I'm off to see the king.
- I want to go with you.

290
00:32:28,828 --> 00:32:33,626
Uh, Pocahontas, the conventions
in England are very complex.

291
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:36,796
- I must go alone.
- But-- But--

292
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:39,007
Now, I promise I will arrange
for you to see the king.

293
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:42,970
- My word as a gentleman. Trust me.

294
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:53,357
Mm!

295
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:03,077
Uh-oh.

296
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,879
Mm.

297
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:14,590
Mm!

298
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:19,513
I must find a way to warn my people,
to stop this.

299
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,848
Leave it to Johnny.

300
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:25,729
He gave you his word
as a gentleman, my dear.

301
00:33:25,895 --> 00:33:28,190
You can stake
your life on that.

302
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,361
I didn't exactly
bring the Indian chief--

303
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:36,700
No, no, no, no. I told you, I would meet
with the chief and no one less.

304
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:39,411
Knight to bishop three.

305
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:44,250
- Sire, I gave these people your word you would meet.

306
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:47,253
- Are we not honour-bound--
-The king is bound to nothing,

307
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,256
when you cannot
fulfil your mission.

308
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:53,219
You were sent for the savage leader
and yet you bring back a woman.

309
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:57,808
- A woman! - Your Highness,
she is royalty-- a princess.

310
00:33:57,975 --> 00:34:00,686
She is the daughter of a great chief
who has travelled...

311
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:03,731
far from her homeland
in the interests of peace.

312
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:05,859
Meet with her, Your Majesty.

313
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:08,403
May I suggest she attend
the hunt ball?

314
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,115
Let her go back to Virginia
having witnessed...

315
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:15,454
the royal might and majesty
of English society.

316
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:18,457
Sire, she doesn't know
our customs.

317
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:22,587
- To subject her to this kind of scrutiny
would be-- - I don't understand, Rolfe.

318
00:34:22,754 --> 00:34:26,132
If she's not a savage,
then why shouldn't she fit in?

319
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:31,806
Excellent idea, Ratcliffe. Rolfe,
you will bring her to the hunt ball.

320
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:35,602
Prove to me she is as civilized
as you claim, and...

321
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:39,523
I will stop my armada;
if not, the armada sails.

322
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,859
- But sire--
- It is decided!

323
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:45,279
Pawn to king!

324
00:34:45,446 --> 00:34:47,157
Check.

325
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:50,870
-Of all the--

326
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:53,415
- How did it go?
- A disaster!

327
00:34:53,582 --> 00:34:58,754
- She's invited to the hunt ball!
- Flabberdy-jacks.

328
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,517
You were successful?
When do I see the king?

329
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:13,146
Our meeting with the king
has been corrupted.

330
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:16,441
- You're now invited to the hunt ball.
- I don't understand.

331
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,321
Oh, it's a trap!
Ratcliffe manipulated the king!

332
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:23,574
He's saying that if you're
civilized you can fit right in.

333
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:27,537
But it's the elite of British society--
etiquette and manners.

334
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:30,917
There's a million ways you can insult
someone. Believe me, I know.

335
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:34,004
And if you slip up, just once,
Ratcliffe can convince the king that--

336
00:35:34,171 --> 00:35:37,007
Then I must not "slip up."

337
00:35:37,174 --> 00:35:41,429
I can't learn your ways alone,
but you can help me.

338
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:43,432
What must I do?

339
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,956
-John Rolfe!

340
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,628
How do I look?

341
00:36:08,795 --> 00:36:13,050
Hm? Oh, lovely...
in your... underwear.

342
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:16,971
Didn't Mrs Jenkins exp--
Uh, Mrs Jenkins!

343
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:21,309
Oh, my dear!

344
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:25,064
Oh, come along, now.
Let's go finish your dressing.

345
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,293
Have no fear
We're all right

346
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,005
- You've got me, dear to see you're a lady tonight

347
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:50,260
- What seems strange is just new

348
00:36:50,427 --> 00:36:54,306
People change every day
till they find their own way

349
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:57,351
So can you

350
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:01,606
And wait till he sees you
after you're dressed

351
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:05,277
I think the king
will be very impressed

352
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:08,948
Wait till he sees you
walking with ease

353
00:37:09,115 --> 00:37:12,535
He'll be so pleased
you came down from the trees

354
00:37:12,702 --> 00:37:15,790
You'll be fine
I can tell

355
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:19,544
- It's a very good sign that you're doing so well

356
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:22,547
- One more tuck, one more bow

357
00:37:22,714 --> 00:37:26,135
Don't get stuck on that clasp
Johnny's lucky they asked

358
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:29,138
- You to go

359
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:34,227
'Cause wait till he sees you
He'll be so proud

360
00:37:34,394 --> 00:37:37,898
Maybe he'll smile
if he thinks he's allowed

361
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:41,819
Wait till he sees you
there in your curls

362
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:45,490
John's always had
such a fondness for girls

363
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:47,493
With curls

364
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,745
And wait

365
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:53,250
Wait till you're out
on the floor

366
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:57,005
Show them what
dancing is for

367
00:37:57,171 --> 00:38:00,759
Music is all you need
See where a dance can lead

368
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:04,263
You two might come to see
You were meant to be

369
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,892
So much more

370
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:11,396
Wait till he sees you
Wait till tonight

371
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:15,067
Fate has a way
of arranging what's right

372
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:18,571
After he sees you
in your new clothes

373
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:22,535
A lady of grace
from your head to your toes

374
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:25,746
Pretty and pink
as the roses he grows

375
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:28,791
Who knows
Who knows

376
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,794
I can't wait!

377
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:36,133
Oh, I've got something for you.

378
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,480
- Flit, stop it!

379
00:38:47,647 --> 00:38:51,235
- It doesn't belong here any more.

380
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:03,082
It's beautiful!

381
00:39:34,994 --> 00:39:39,123
I have personally taken charge
of the entertainment for the hunt ball.

382
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:44,004
I want to make sure
nothing... goes... right.

383
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,637
Well, how do I look?
Pretty good, eh?

384
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:53,516
Say, I thought you were
getting dressed.

385
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,437
You're right.
You look great.

386
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,939
Just don't talk so much tonight
and we'll be fine.

387
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:25,052
It's called powder.

388
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:29,099
You look beautiful.

389
00:40:44,826 --> 00:40:47,245
I'll put on some tea!

390
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,715
Ohh.

391
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:06,017
The Duke of Edinburgh.

392
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:10,647
Lady Grey.
Sir Thomas Ellery.

393
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:16,070
Lord Raymond
and Lady Theresa.

394
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,658
The Earl of Essex.

395
00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:26,041
The Duke of Buckingham
and Lady Buckingham.

396
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:35,259
- John Rolfe and Princess Pocahontas...

397
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:39,431
and Utam-- Uttata--

398
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:42,769
- Ultimatum-- Old tomato--
- Try "Uti."

399
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:45,271
Oh, thank you, sir.

400
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:48,149
And Uti.

401
00:41:48,316 --> 00:41:50,778
Jacket required, sir.

402
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:53,197
- Oh, dear.

403
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:06,922
- Goodness!
- Oh, my.

404
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,090
Hello, Your Excellent-ness.

405
00:42:09,257 --> 00:42:11,761
Your Great, Good-Good Highness.

406
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:14,430
Greetings,
Your Magnificence-cy.

407
00:42:14,597 --> 00:42:16,600
Uh--

408
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:29,906
Hmm.

409
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,036
Welcome to England,
Pocahontas.

410
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:37,916
Thank you, Your Grace.

411
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:41,671
What do you think
of my kingdom, hmm?

412
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,676
I think you must be a great king
to have so many subjects, Your Majesty,

413
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:48,095
and the loyalty
of so many good men.

414
00:42:48,262 --> 00:42:51,432
Did you hear that?
She thinks I am a great king!

415
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,269
Oh, what a delightful child!

416
00:42:54,394 --> 00:42:56,772
Charming! Absolutely charming!

417
00:42:56,939 --> 00:42:59,066
Your Excellency,
please stop this armada.

418
00:42:59,232 --> 00:43:04,489
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. But right now I
can't be rude and ignore my guests, can I?

419
00:43:04,656 --> 00:43:07,158
No! So we shall
discuss it later.

420
00:43:07,325 --> 00:43:11,580
For now, my dear,
enjoy the ball.

421
00:43:11,747 --> 00:43:14,000
Go on! Enjoy!

422
00:43:19,507 --> 00:43:22,886
-Thank goodness.
-Rolfie! Rolfie, old boy!

423
00:43:23,053 --> 00:43:26,056
Listen, we're having
some friends out to the estate.

424
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:29,602
Do come. Oh, yes,
bring your delightful...

425
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:32,105
guest.

426
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:35,067
Oh, Miss--
Hontas.

427
00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:37,569
How drippingly marvellous
to see you!

428
00:43:40,573 --> 00:43:42,867
Enchanting! Charming!

429
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:44,869
Fabulous jewellery!

430
00:43:49,917 --> 00:43:51,920
May the dance begin!

431
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,382
-May I?

432
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,856
In one night you will have done more for
the cause of peace than a hundred diplomats.

433
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:53,658
My, you look lovely.

434
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:56,495
I can't even see
the real you under there.

435
00:44:56,662 --> 00:44:58,998
I do hope
no one else does.

436
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:01,459
I was going to say
the same about you.

437
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:04,588
It's a very good thing
Smith is dead.

438
00:45:04,754 --> 00:45:08,092
Seeing how disloyal your heart is
would certainly kill him.

439
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,352
Dinner is served!

440
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,445
Oh, no, madam.

441
00:45:25,612 --> 00:45:30,117
The guest of honour is always on
the king's right hand.

442
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:39,295
- Your Grace, perhaps now we
might discuss-- -

443
00:45:39,462 --> 00:45:43,383
Your Royal Highnesses,
Lords and Ladies of the Court...

444
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:48,723
and our distinguished guest
from the forests of the New World.

445
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:52,060
Things are not
what they appear

446
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:55,773
As tonight will make
quite clear

447
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:00,820
But what is real will be revealed
I can feel the moment's near

448
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,743
Things are never
what they seem

449
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,162
That will be
this evening's theme

450
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:10,916
Amusing sights
for your delight

451
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:14,337
Perhaps a few
to make you scream

452
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:17,006
You'll be surprised
to see whose disguise

453
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:19,592
Is the cleverest one
of the lot

454
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:23,180
After our show
the whole world will know

455
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,684
Who's pretending to be
what they're not

456
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:31,356
If a jester's grin or a dancer's spin
should be pleasing

457
00:46:31,523 --> 00:46:33,525
- Please say Yea
- Yea!

458
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:36,695
If a juggler's feat
should be incomplete

459
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:40,200
- He's the one to greet with Nay
- Nay!

460
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:43,537
If the fools we see
look like you and me

461
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:46,791
Then before the night goes by

462
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:50,629
- Ask why, why, why, why

463
00:46:50,796 --> 00:46:54,049
- Why Why?

464
00:46:54,216 --> 00:46:57,720
Things are not
what they appear

465
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:00,557
And the finest proof's
right here

466
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:05,562
How I regret when first we met
I believed my own worst fear

467
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:09,401
Things are never
what they seem

468
00:47:09,568 --> 00:47:12,571
So in keeping
with our theme

469
00:47:12,738 --> 00:47:14,823
A change of hair
a dress to wear

470
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,244
And our nightmare's
now a dream

471
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,497
Shoeless and wild
I saw this sweet child

472
00:47:20,664 --> 00:47:23,667
As a danger
to one and to all

473
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:27,088
Savage, I thought
What could Rolfe have brought

474
00:47:27,255 --> 00:47:30,759
Now I see she's
the belle of the ball

475
00:47:30,925 --> 00:47:34,430
- Things are never what they seem
- He's right! He's right!

476
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:37,684
- Many don't say what they mean
- He's right! He's right!

477
00:47:37,851 --> 00:47:42,607
- A powdered face is just the place
- To conceal an ugly scheme

478
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:47,862
Only one thing's really clear

479
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:52,659
Things are not
what they appear

480
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,009
- Sire, please stop this! She doesn't understand!

481
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:10,222
Oh, nonsense!
Everybody loves a good bear-baiting.

482
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:25,615
- No!

483
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:29,786
Stop this!

484
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:33,958
- This is torture!
- This is an animal-- nothing more.

485
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:38,171
- A helpless animal.
- Sit down at once...

486
00:48:38,338 --> 00:48:40,424
and we will overlook
this savage behaviour.

487
00:48:40,591 --> 00:48:42,718
Your behaviour is savage.

488
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:45,180
You and your people are
the barbarians!

489
00:48:45,347 --> 00:48:47,182
- What?
- Sire,

490
00:48:47,348 --> 00:48:49,643
don't let the savage
get away with this.

491
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:53,398
- Seize her!

492
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:58,404
Savages!

493
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:02,783
- Keep her away!
- Get her!

494
00:49:07,747 --> 00:49:10,251
Take them to the tower!

495
00:49:10,418 --> 00:49:14,548
No! Your Majesty, please!
It was a misunderstanding!

496
00:49:14,714 --> 00:49:19,386
Push me no farther...
or face treason.

497
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:22,557
Where exactly do
your loyalties lie?

498
00:49:24,058 --> 00:49:26,436
Let go!
Let go of me!

499
00:49:26,603 --> 00:49:29,857
- John Rolfe! John Rolfe!

500
00:49:41,036 --> 00:49:44,207
- Oi, you're cheatin'!
- No, I'm not.

501
00:49:44,374 --> 00:49:46,209
I'll play that card there.

502
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,466
The least you could do
is put a head on it.

503
00:49:51,632 --> 00:49:55,679
- How much do I have to pay to get good beer here?
- You say it's not true?

504
00:49:55,846 --> 00:50:00,309
But I just heard meself
from a guard what was there.

505
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:03,813
The king's gonna have her head.

506
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,192
That savage.

507
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,530
Aye, I bet you old John Rolfe
wishes he never laid eyes...

508
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:14,242
on the likes of Pocahontas.

509
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:16,912
Aye!

510
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:18,914
- Oh!

511
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:21,918
- What's got into him?

512
00:50:38,563 --> 00:50:41,566
Ah, I think
I'll put on some tea.

513
00:50:56,124 --> 00:50:58,961
What am I to do?

514
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:07,054
Who are you?
What do you want?

515
00:51:26,076 --> 00:51:29,246
Halt! Who goes there?

516
00:51:29,413 --> 00:51:31,916
John Rolfe.
I have a prisoner.

517
00:51:33,668 --> 00:51:37,381
Open the gate.

518
00:51:48,311 --> 00:51:50,354
Hmm.

519
00:51:53,108 --> 00:51:55,694
He's escaping! Catch him!

520
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:00,658
Now find her, Flit.

521
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:41,205
- Flit!

522
00:52:41,372 --> 00:52:43,459
- John!

523
00:52:44,918 --> 00:52:46,879
I knew you'd come!

524
00:52:50,007 --> 00:52:51,843
There's no time.
We must go.

525
00:52:57,516 --> 00:53:00,520
John Smith?

526
00:53:03,857 --> 00:53:06,026
I-I thought you were dead.

527
00:53:06,193 --> 00:53:08,363
- Greatly exaggerated.

528
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,365
Let's go!

529
00:53:11,741 --> 00:53:13,952
There!

530
00:53:23,714 --> 00:53:25,717
Enjoy the accommodations.

531
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:30,388
I'll take care of it.

532
00:53:38,856 --> 00:53:41,151
- Pardon me.

533
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:47,491
Oh, very stylish.

534
00:54:00,131 --> 00:54:02,384
- Riding or running?
- After them! They're getting away!

535
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:04,386
Close the gate!

536
00:54:19,863 --> 00:54:21,698
- Blast it! They got away!

537
00:54:32,294 --> 00:54:35,131
What happened to you?

538
00:54:35,298 --> 00:54:37,341
Ratcliffe convinced the king
I was the traitor.

539
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:40,888
I had to stay hidden-- let them
continue to believe that I was dead.

540
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:45,477
- I missed you so much.
- I've thought of you every day.

541
00:54:45,642 --> 00:54:49,440
All this time.
Why didn't you ever write to me?

542
00:54:49,606 --> 00:54:53,194
I wanted to. I must have started
a thousand letters.

543
00:54:53,361 --> 00:54:57,157
Pocahontas, all that matters
is that we're together again.

544
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,746
What about my people?

545
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:03,747
Once the armada sails,
they won't stand a chance.

546
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:05,750
How will her
getting killed save them?

547
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:08,253
Well, are you suggesting
she turn her back on them?

548
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,256
Are you suggesting
she die for them?

549
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:13,259
- She can't just sit back and watch.
- She has no choice!

550
00:55:13,426 --> 00:55:15,845
Of course she has a choice!

551
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,848
Pocahontas!

552
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:38,705
- Let her go.
- You may not care about her safety--

553
00:55:38,872 --> 00:55:40,916
Don't you dare tell me
I don't care about her!

554
00:55:44,879 --> 00:55:46,715
You love her.

555
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,321
Do not forget this land.

556
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:21,506
In some new place on some new face

557
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:24,509
I've never seen

558
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:30,348
I might find
where I belong someday

559
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:36,356
And there may even be
another dream for me

560
00:56:36,523 --> 00:56:41,737
Waiting there
somewhere along the way

561
00:56:41,904 --> 00:56:44,866
Listen to the spirit within.

562
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:50,039
Who knows
where I go from here

563
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,875
So many voices

564
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,254
Only one thing's clear

565
00:56:55,419 --> 00:56:58,757
There's nothing to lose

566
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:01,719
Nothing to fear

567
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:04,764
The past is gone

568
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:08,017
I must move on

569
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:13,775
From here

570
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:34,924
- I'm going back.
- They'll hang you.

571
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:37,761
Then I will be
but the first to fall.

572
00:57:37,928 --> 00:57:41,099
They're not going to listen to you.
Look at you.

573
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:44,478
How can they respect my culture
if they haven't seen it?

574
00:57:44,644 --> 00:57:48,941
This is insane! Nuts!
Tell her she's crazy.

575
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:54,614
You're crazy.

576
00:57:56,283 --> 00:57:58,410
I thought you may need
whatever power...

577
00:57:58,577 --> 00:58:00,997
this holds for you.

578
00:58:01,164 --> 00:58:04,668
I think it's time
you taught society a lesson.

579
00:58:04,835 --> 00:58:07,128
I have decided.

580
00:58:17,057 --> 00:58:19,476
Hear ye! Hear ye!

581
00:58:19,643 --> 00:58:24,733
The High Court of King James
will herewith commence.

582
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,986
- Presenting the first order
of business-- -

583
00:58:32,617 --> 00:58:35,912
Pocahontas!
Guards! Guards!

584
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,754
Surely His Majesty
would not refuse an audience...

585
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:44,839
with a visiting princess.

586
00:58:45,006 --> 00:58:47,009
James.

587
00:58:53,015 --> 00:58:55,936
Your Grace,
if you insist on war...

588
00:58:56,103 --> 00:58:59,190
my people will fight
to the last warrior.

589
00:58:59,357 --> 00:59:04,822
There is nothing to be gained
but much to be lost, for all of us.

590
00:59:04,988 --> 00:59:07,700
There is no gold, is there?

591
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:10,703
- No. Ratcliffe assured me--
- That I was dead?

592
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,831
- Was it true?

593
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:18,128
Ratcliffe has lied to you
about everything.

594
00:59:22,383 --> 00:59:25,221
There are many voices
around you...

595
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:28,057
but you must listen
to your own voice.

596
00:59:28,224 --> 00:59:30,726
Why do you speak out
when so many doubt you,

597
00:59:30,893 --> 00:59:33,897
even when it could mean
your life?

598
00:59:34,064 --> 00:59:36,525
Because I speak the truth.

599
00:59:39,612 --> 00:59:41,740
Silence!

600
00:59:41,907 --> 00:59:45,911
-Ratcliffe has left! We must stop him!
-But it's too late.

601
00:59:46,078 --> 00:59:48,414
We must try.

602
00:59:51,751 --> 00:59:55,881
You are the best soldiers
in the civilized world.

603
00:59:56,048 --> 00:59:58,050
Hear, hear!

604
00:59:58,217 --> 01:00:02,723
We sail to scour the world
of the savage vermin. Are you with me?

605
01:00:04,725 --> 01:00:07,604
- Riders Approaching!

606
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,441
Smith!

607
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,778
- Raise anchor! Cast off!
- Lift anchor!

608
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,072
Drop the maintop!

609
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:22,454
- It's John Smith!

610
01:00:22,579 --> 01:00:25,707
- I thought he was dead!
- I'm the ghost of John Smith.

611
01:00:25,874 --> 01:00:28,961
- Run for your lives!

612
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,794
Who started the party
without me?

613
01:01:08,508 --> 01:01:11,845
- You call this a party?
- You're not having any fun?

614
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:42,798
- Ha-ha!
- Drop the anchor!

615
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,475
All aboard!
Clear the mast! Clear the mast!

616
01:01:51,642 --> 01:01:53,560
Prepare to crash!

617
01:02:07,243 --> 01:02:11,081
Now I can finally
get rid of you, you savage!

618
01:02:11,248 --> 01:02:13,250
- Mind if I cut in?

619
01:02:22,511 --> 01:02:24,764
Trying to make a point?

620
01:02:38,071 --> 01:02:41,450
Please, don't hurt me, Smith.

621
01:02:41,617 --> 01:02:43,953
- I was just doing my duty.
- Sheath your sword.

622
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,457
Surely you know that a good soldier
always follows orders.

623
01:02:47,623 --> 01:02:52,463
If it were I, I would have
killed you years ago.

624
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:56,426
As I was saying,
I never liked you, Smith.

625
01:02:56,592 --> 01:02:59,470
I hereby sentence you to death.

626
01:02:59,637 --> 01:03:01,473
Goodbye, Smith.

627
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:10,150
- Very stylish.
- I learned it from the best.

628
01:03:10,317 --> 01:03:13,779
- Pity. I so would have preferred to see you hang.

629
01:03:39,142 --> 01:03:42,897
Huh? Your Majesty,
the fugitives are getting away!

630
01:03:43,064 --> 01:03:46,484
They've sabotaged the armada.
Stop them!

631
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:49,321
No more lies.

632
01:03:49,487 --> 01:03:51,782
Arrest him.

633
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:04,130
- John Smith, what a heroic return.
- Why, thank you, my lady.

634
01:04:04,297 --> 01:04:07,217
- How did you escape?
- John, we thought you were dead.

635
01:04:07,384 --> 01:04:09,219
Bravo, John!

636
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:23,819
Lord Advisor to the Royal Court.

637
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:25,822
What a wonderful honour.

638
01:04:28,408 --> 01:04:31,745
- It's what you've always wanted.

639
01:04:31,912 --> 01:04:36,042
And you, you've done everything
you've set out to do...

640
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:39,338
- and more.

641
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:42,926
Your people will
be very proud.

642
01:04:45,178 --> 01:04:48,431
Yes. It-It will be good
to see them again.

643
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:51,436
Well, perhaps one day
you'll return to London.

644
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:53,437
- Pocahontas--
- John, I--

645
01:04:53,604 --> 01:04:56,066
The king has given me a ship!
This is my dream!

646
01:04:56,233 --> 01:04:58,402
Ours.

647
01:04:58,569 --> 01:05:00,904
Every day a new adventure.
New lands to discover.

648
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:02,907
I'll chart a new course.

649
01:05:03,074 --> 01:05:05,535
Uh, and you'll be
at my side, naturally.

650
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:09,247
A ship of our own!
I'll put a crew together immediately!

651
01:05:09,414 --> 01:05:11,960
- We'll set sail right away!

652
01:05:13,127 --> 01:05:15,797
What?

653
01:05:15,964 --> 01:05:18,717
That's... not what
you want, is it?

654
01:05:18,884 --> 01:05:22,054
We walked the same path once.

655
01:05:22,221 --> 01:05:25,142
I have found where I belong.

656
01:05:26,726 --> 01:05:29,813
I hope you will also
find happiness.

657
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,485
May the Great Spirit
always be with you.

658
01:06:08,025 --> 01:06:11,154
[ Mrs Jenkins ]
Pocahontas! Pocahontas!

659
01:06:13,323 --> 01:06:15,200
- Look smart, men!
- I don't see anything.

660
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:17,536
Oh, my-- Oh!

661
01:06:17,703 --> 01:06:19,539
Mrs Jenkins!

662
01:06:19,706 --> 01:06:22,876
Oh, there you are, dear.

663
01:06:23,043 --> 01:06:25,211
- Over here.

664
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:27,214
- Ooh.
- Aww.

665
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:31,219
Mrs Jenkins, thank you so much
for everything.

666
01:06:31,386 --> 01:06:36,350
- Is John Rolfe here?
- I haven't seen him, dear. I thought he was with you.

667
01:06:36,517 --> 01:06:41,898
Maybe he hates goodbyes as much as I do.
Goodbye, dear.

668
01:07:04,424 --> 01:07:07,553
Well, perhaps one day
we'll return to London.

669
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:11,182
John!

670
01:07:13,018 --> 01:07:15,020
What about your duty
to the king?

671
01:07:15,187 --> 01:07:18,441
I have a duty to honour
what is in my heart, Pocahontas.

672
01:07:21,903 --> 01:07:24,740
Ta-ta, pip-pip.

673
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:28,160
Come on, Uti.
Let's put on some tea.

674
01:07:28,327 --> 01:07:30,872
And you,
mind your manners.

675
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:34,877
Ohh!

676
01:07:35,044 --> 01:07:37,004
Let's go home.

677
01:07:51,146 --> 01:07:54,775
Two hopeful hearts

678
01:07:54,942 --> 01:07:58,821
Two lands apart

679
01:07:58,988 --> 01:08:01,491
Together there's no end

680
01:08:01,658 --> 01:08:07,248
To what a dream can start

681
01:08:07,415 --> 01:08:10,418
Like two eagles soar as one

682
01:08:10,585 --> 01:08:15,049
Upon the river of the wind

683
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,553
With the promise of forever

684
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,847
We will take the past

685
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:26,687
And learn how to begin

686
01:08:26,854 --> 01:08:29,732
And we'll build
a bridge of love

687
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:34,738
Between two worlds

688
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:41,079
With every kiss

689
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:45,042
We'll promise this

690
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:47,044
We'll find a way

691
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:49,047
To light the dawn

692
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:54,053
Of all we wish

693
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:57,640
Across the stream of stars
we'll reach

694
01:08:57,807 --> 01:09:01,562
An island in the sky

695
01:09:01,728 --> 01:09:04,481
With the moon
to guide our way

696
01:09:04,648 --> 01:09:08,277
I know that we can
find a home

697
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:12,908
For you and I

698
01:09:13,075 --> 01:09:16,078
And we'll build
a bridge of love

699
01:09:16,245 --> 01:09:21,251
Between two worlds

700
01:09:21,418 --> 01:09:24,838
Miles and miles

701
01:09:25,005 --> 01:09:28,467
Away

702
01:09:28,634 --> 01:09:31,430
Though the journey
takes us far

703
01:09:31,597 --> 01:09:37,353
Our love has found
a place to stay

704
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,232
- If we believe
- If we believe

705
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:45,112
- There is no sea
- There is no sea

706
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,198
That's wide enough

707
01:09:47,365 --> 01:09:52,329
To keep us from our destiny

708
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:57,501
Like the snows
of every winter melt

709
01:09:57,668 --> 01:10:01,507
And blossom into spring

710
01:10:01,673 --> 01:10:05,303
As the seasons pass
we'll live as one

711
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:09,099
No matter what
the years ahead

712
01:10:09,266 --> 01:10:13,229
May bring

713
01:10:13,396 --> 01:10:16,900
No night is long enough

714
01:10:17,067 --> 01:10:20,863
To end this light
that shines on us

715
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:23,824
We have built
a bridge of love

716
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:28,747
Between two worlds

717
01:10:28,914 --> 01:10:32,793
Yes, we have built a love

718
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:40,719
Between two worlds
