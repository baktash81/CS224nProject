1
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,558
- Nice place, huh?
- I've seen better.

2
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,532
Everybody downstairs!

3
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,788
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon, sir.
Where do you want this thing?

4
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,417
Just through there, thank you.
Come on, you guys.
I've got a surprise for you!

5
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,920
- Want me to place him
right over here, sir?
- Yup, just over there.

6
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,840
H-Here's a place. Here.
Yeah, okay. Move it over here.

7
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,259
- There ya go. Nice and easy.
- That's right.

8
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,887
Easy. Lift it up.

9
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,264
Sweetie, come away from it,
please.

10
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,977
- W-What is it, Daddy?
- Wait, wait, wait.

11
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,865
Wow.

12
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,498
Wow.

13
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,211
Oh, my.

14
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,052
Thank you, sir. Enjoy your NDR.

15
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,946
NorthAm Robotics
household model NDR-1 1 4,

16
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,990
serial number 583625.

17
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,294
- Hello.
- Hello.

18
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,464
Are you one's family?

19
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,635
Well, um, I guess so.

20
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,771
It's scary.

21
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,940
It's not scary.
It's stupid.

22
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,359
- I doubt that.
-Jenny Harrison's family's got one,

23
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,527
- I doubt that.
-Jenny Harrison's family's got one,

24
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:04,114
- so does Kate McAllister-
they're all the same.
- What is it?

25
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,743
- It's an android.
- What's an "Andrew"?

26
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,623
Will that be one's name?

27
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,334
Well, why not?
It sounds good.

28
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,504
- Hello, Andrew.
- Hello, sir.

29
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,132
Would you care to hear
the three laws of robotics?

30
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:26,136
- It's said to be a most
entertaining presentation.
- Okay. Sure.

31
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,641
- Will you step back, sir,
to maximize presentation?
- Right.

32
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:48,283
First law of robotics:
A robot may not injure a human being,

33
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:53,372
or, through inaction,
cause a human being to come to harm.

34
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,415
Second law:

35
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,335
A robot must obey
all human orders,

36
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,589
except where those orders
come in conflict with the first law.

37
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,592
Third law:
A robot must protect itself,

38
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:10,013
so long as doing so does not conflict
with the first two laws.

39
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,271
Andrew,
don't ever do that again.

40
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,483
Of course not, sir.
It is a one-time only.

41
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:25,153
There is another option that
one is obligated to point out, sir:

42
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,990
You may have one
with or without personality.

43
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,702
- Would you care to see a demo
of the personality chip?
- Uh, no, no, thank you.

44
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,831
- We'll stick with what we've got.
- A wise choice, sir, if one may say so.

45
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,459
Well, you'll be staying down here.
Got everything you need?

46
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,505
- One only requires access
to a power outlet.
- Good.

47
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,552
Right. Well, um,
good night, Andrew.

48
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,263
It certainly is, sir.

49
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,307
No. No, Andrew,

50
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,310
The correct response to
"good night" is "good night."

51
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,189
- Good night.
- Yes.

52
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,941
- You just said "yes."
- Yes?

53
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,944
But the correct response to
"good night" is "good night."

54
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,449
- Good night, Andrew.
- Good night, sir.

55
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,286
- Good night, Andrew.
- Good night, sir.

56
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:19,291
- You only need to say it once.
- Or one would be saying it
forever, sir,

57
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,293
in an infinite verbal loop.

58
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,046
Exactly.

59
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,381
- Thank you, sir.
- Good.

60
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,342
Night.

61
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,554
Sorry, sir.

62
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,935
Honey, I don't want it...
following me around the house all day.

63
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,979
Can't-Can't you turn it off
or something, please?

64
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,899
Just give him a job.
It'll be okay.

65
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,319
- Well- Seat belts!
-Seatbelts!

66
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,282
Good morning,
Mr. Martin. Today's temperature
will be in the high 70s.

67
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,450
Bye, Mom!

68
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,412
- Have a good day, sweethearts.
- Have a good day, sweethearts.

69
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:17,928
- Mmm. Andrew, this is very good.
- Thank you, sir.

70
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,055
-Don't you think?
- I think it sucks.

71
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,476
"Sucks"? How?
Chickens do not have lips.

72
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:30,732
She's being rude. You mind your manners,
young lady, please.

73
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:37,030
- We're fine, Andrew.
- Indeed you are, sir.

74
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,325
The kitchen.

75
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,037
It's fine too, sir.

76
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,457
No.
Go to the kitchen now.

77
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,599
Hello.

78
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,193
Come on.

79
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,997
Maybe it's a big bluff.

80
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,921
Just a pretty face.

81
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,190
Check.

82
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,861
Oh, Andrew, could you come up?

83
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,701
- Should l-
- No. It'll be fine.

84
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,795
- Yes, miss?
- Andrew, would you please
open the window?

85
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,922
One is glad
to be of service.

86
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,265
A lovely breeze.

87
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,642
Now jump.

88
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,647
No,

89
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,941
out the window.

90
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,119
- Did you hear something?
- Was that an earthquake?

91
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,853
Sorry for the inconvenience.
May one re-re-re-enter...

92
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,063
- er-er?
- What happened, Andrew?

93
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,816
For the sake of family harmony,

94
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,321
one is programmed not to tell.

95
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:26,200
- Andrew? Andrew!

96
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,827
Yeah?

97
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,334
Amanda, Grace,
downstairs right away.

98
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:42,299
- Come in, Andrew.
- Thank you, si-i-i-r.

99
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,858
Andrew's not a person,
he's a form of property.

100
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:03,612
One is not
a per-r-r-r-r-r-r-

101
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,614
son.

102
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,242
But property is
also important.

103
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,245
So from now on,
as a matter of principle,

104
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,623
in this family Andrew will be treated
as if he were a person.

105
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,002
Which means there will be
no more attempts to break him.

106
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,296
Break him?

107
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,924
Your sister tried
to kill Andrew.

108
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:29,179
You too?

109
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,640
- Shh.
- Sorry.

110
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,311
Come on.
Everyone up to bed.

111
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:42,651
- Will you be all right, Andrew?
- One is capable of
self-mai-ai-aintenance, sir.

112
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,362
Good.

113
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,698
- Good night, Andrew.
- Good night, Andrew.

114
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,702
Guh, guh, guh-
G-Good night.

115
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,881
Good night, Andrew. Good... night.

116
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,654
Miss, one has been given
specific orders for your safety,

117
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,990
and that is an unsafe area.

118
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,201
Now, come down.

119
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,953
Okay.

120
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,747
Thank you.

121
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,958
"Well, I think it's gonna be
sunny tonight."

122
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,878
" Me too."

123
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,964
"So do l."

124
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,889
He's my favorite.

125
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,893
Pretty.

126
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,145
Would you like
to hold him?

127
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,449
That was my favorite.

128
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,621
They don't even
make him anymore.

129
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:21,792
- Can it be repaired, Little Miss?
- No, it can't!

130
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,379
- You're screwed.
- I hate you!

131
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,132
Get away from me.

132
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:39,017
- Can we fix him?
- No. Look at him-
he's in a million pieces!

133
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:44,064
- I'm sorry. There's
nothing you can do.

134
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,651
Put the rest of them away.

135
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,570
Wow.

136
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,914
-Andrew!
- Yes, Little Miss?

137
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:45,209
This is the best present
I ever got.

138
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,545
One is glad
to be of service.

139
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:51,507
Would you please
come with me?

140
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,760
Does this involve
a window?

141
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,803
No.

142
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,145
You can sit here.

143
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,780
His name is Woof,

144
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,617
and from now on...
he's yours.

145
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,039
- Woof.
- Uh-huh.

146
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,708
Because sometimes
he barks,

147
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,674
once he gets to know you.

148
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,676
Oh.

149
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,429
Thank you very much.

150
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,723
You're welcome.

151
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,767
I have to go
to sleep now, Andrew.

152
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:49,356
- Yes.
- Yeah. Can you, kinda-

153
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,943
Of course.

154
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:02,369
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Andrew.

155
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,849
- Little Miss?
- Sure. Thanks.

156
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,684
Miss?

157
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,316
- After you.
- Well, thank you.

158
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,776
You're welcome.

159
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,156
Andrew, did you
really make this?

160
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,200
Yes, sir.

161
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,621
A robot cannot
tell a lie, Andrew.

162
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,332
That is not
entirely correct, sir.

163
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,334
One could lie,
if one were ordered to lie,

164
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,546
or if it were necessary to tell
some untruth in order to keep
a human being from harm,

165
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,674
- or if one's own safety were
in jeopardy- Sir?
- Andrew.

166
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:01,011
One did indeed carve that
for Little Miss.

167
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,723
- And the design-
you're responsible for that?
- Yes, sir.

168
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:08,435
- What did you copy it from?
- Copy it, ma'am?

169
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,898
Well, I mean, you didn't just get it
out of thin air.

170
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,610
You got it out of some book,
right, or used the computer
to plot it out?

171
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:21,865
One did nothing more than study
the raw material for a time...

172
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:25,077
until one came to understand how best
to carve it into a shape...

173
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,413
that would appeal to Little Miss's
love of tiny mammals.

174
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,566
Yes, yes.
Please come in.

175
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:25,697
I am so glad you called.
Mansky, Dennis Mansky.

176
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,325
Richard Mark.

177
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,537
And an NDR-114.

178
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:37,459
Now, I got your message,
but what exactly is it doing?

179
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:41,129
Well, what interests me is
he shows a number of characteristics-

180
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:45,008
like creativity,
curiosity, friendship-

181
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,346
that, frankly,
have taken us by surprise.

182
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,098
Mm-hmm.

183
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,142
- Andrew-
- Yes, Dennis?

184
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,855
Social as well.

185
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,607
Now I'd like to show you
something if I may.

186
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:05,821
Now, Andrew carved these.

187
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,157
These are
original works of art,

188
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,410
and last night Andrew said,

189
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:15,080
- "I enjoy making them."
- " Enjoy."

190
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,082
- Yes.
- Should one not use that word?

191
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,251
No, no. It's fine, Andrew.
See what I mean?

192
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:23,672
It's unusual, surely,
to hear a robot talk
about enjoying something.

193
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,799
What I want to know is,

194
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:29,803
do many of your other robots
have- have feelings like this?

195
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,057
Must be...

196
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,977
something in the pathways.

197
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:42,941
So, then, will you be wanting
a refund or a replacement?

198
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:47,988
No, neither. I just wanted
to get your reaction to Andrew.
I wanted to know what you think.

199
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,657
He's unique,
wouldn't you say?

200
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,701
It is an anomaly.

201
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:58,207
No refund, no replacement-

202
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,209
How much do you want?

203
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,962
- I don't think I understand.
- Well,

204
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:09,510
clearly you realize
if word of this gets out,
we'll have to recall our entire line.

205
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,346
We're in people's homes, sir,
with their children.

206
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:16,183
If it is doing what you say,
it can also run amok.

207
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,560
One is not qualified
to run "mucks."

208
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:23,315
All right, sir.
If I let you have Andrew,

209
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:26,193
you'll what-
you'll disassemble him, will you?

210
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,320
Carefully, yes.

211
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:33,325
We would need to trace the actual course
of Andrew's neural pathways,

212
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:38,038
replace the positronic brain,
then put it-

213
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:42,709
him- back together
and return him to you, good as new.

214
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:47,005
Now, these neural pathways
are presumably fragile.

215
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:52,094
Isn't it possible, in the course
of these procedures,
that something might go wrong?

216
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,722
We would make
every conceivable effort.

217
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,559
And, in the unlikely event
that something did go wrong,

218
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,103
you'd, of course,
replace Andrew.

219
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,522
Of course.

220
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,941
Even though he's unique
and irreplaceable.

221
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:11,864
He- His-
You s-

222
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,867
Well, it's a natural error-
it has human form,

223
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,662
therefore you read mechanical
failure as eccentricity...

224
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,081
and anthropomorphize it.

225
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,209
It is a household appliance,

226
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,212
and yet you act
like it is a man.

227
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,256
We're leaving.
Come on, Andrew.

228
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,884
Please, I beg you
to reconsider, Mr. Martin.

229
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,053
Let us examine Andrew,
talk to your wife. Name your price!

230
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:40,601
Now, listen to me.
There is no price for individuality.

231
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,854
He is, for better or for worse,
my robot,

232
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:47,691
and you will never
lay your hands on him-
do you understand?

233
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:55,032
All in good time.
You see, sooner or later
you'll have to bring it in for repairs.

234
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:05,292
- Andrew, I've made a decision.
- Yes, sir?

235
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,879
You will cut back on your workload.
You can no longer...

236
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,840
devote yourself entirely
to children and housework.

237
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:15,844
But one likes the children, sir,
specifically the smaller one,
Little Miss.

238
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:20,265
That is a contradiction, Andrew,
and that is exactly the sort of
thing you need to learn about.

239
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,392
Thank you for choosing
NorthAm Robotics.

240
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,978
- So we need a new regimen.
- Regimen, sir?

241
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:29,024
First offal, you'll spend part
of each day making something.

242
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:33,403
So as not to offend humans,
we'd better find something
that's not overly artistic.

243
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,406
Could you make other things?
I could teach you my line of work-

244
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,408
you know,
timepieces and clocks and so on.

245
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,745
One could not tell you, sir.
One has never attempted such things.

246
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,789
Well, you will now.

247
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:48,043
Also, you'll spend part of each evening
in instruction with me.

248
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,879
- And what is the purpose
of this instruction?
- To teach you, Andrew-

249
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:54,591
to teach you all the things
that haven't been programmed into you.

250
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,762
Andrew, you're unique.

251
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:02,558
- Unique?
- Thank you
for choosing NorthAm Robotics.

252
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,893
And I feel a responsibility
to help you...

253
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,396
become whatever
you're able to be.

254
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,523
And what is one
able to be?

255
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,692
Well, I don't know.

256
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:14,236
See, people grow
through time.

257
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,239
But then, of course, for you, time
is a completely different proposition.

258
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:20,868
- For you, time is endless.
- Endless?

259
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,214
- Is this a good piece?
- Very.

260
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,892
- What about this one?
- Excellent.

261
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:58,322
It was
a lucky April shower

262
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:02,701
It was
the most convenient door

263
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:06,455
I found
a million-dollar baby

264
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:10,083
In a five-and-ten cent
store

265
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:26,475
And, nine months later,
a baby is born.

266
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,064
And those, Andrew,
are the so-called facts of life.

267
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,652
People actually do this,
sir?

268
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,239
- Well, yes.
-And married people-

269
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:46,245
one supposes they see it
as some kind of requirement
or obligation.

270
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:48,372
Well, it-

271
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:52,459
- it's not exactly
an obligation, Andrew.
- That's a relief.

272
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:56,380
And it is the natural
and preferable way to conceive children.

273
00:29:56,463 --> 00:30:01,593
Sir, offal these millions
of sperm, only one makes it?

274
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:06,098
- That's true.
- What happens to the others?

275
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,810
Well, they die.

276
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,812
They die ?

277
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,524
One feels badly for them.

278
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,403
Well, one does.

279
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:22,906
- But it's completely agreed
that it feels good-
- For both parties, sir?

280
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:25,033
In an ideal world.

281
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:27,870
- So people do it rather frequently.
- How often, sir?

282
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:31,832
- Well, as often as they can,
matter of fact.
- Ahh.

283
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,335
At least at first.

284
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,299
Sir,

285
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:43,218
- may one speak frankly with you?
- As always, Andrew.

286
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:48,182
It's just
that the whole process-

287
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:51,185
it sounds so messy.

288
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:55,772
I think
that's a fair comment.

289
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,155
They die.

290
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:32,100
- Isn't it?
- What?

291
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:42,778
- It's called "humor. "
- " Humor"?

292
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,948
Yes. People tell jokes
to make each other laugh.

293
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,076
And this laughter gives
pleasure, sir?

294
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,078
Yes.

295
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,623
Sir, could you teach one
to tell a joke?

296
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:02,548
Well, l-let's see. Um-
Two drunks walk into a bar.

297
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:06,885
Wouldn't two drunks walk
out of a bar, sir?

298
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:10,806
You walk into a bar to drink,
and you come out drunk.

299
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:15,894
Let's try something simpler, Andrew.
Um-

300
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:20,065
- Knock-knock.
- " Knock-knock"?

301
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,860
No, knock-knock,
someone's at the door.

302
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:25,863
- Shall one get it, sir?
- No, no. No.

303
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,740
Y-You say, "who's there,"
Andrew.

304
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:31,243
- Who's there, Andrew?
- No, just "Who's there?"

305
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:33,912
One does not know, sir.

306
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:38,500
Let's start with something
a little simpler, Andrew.

307
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,711
Why did the chicken
cross the road?

308
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:44,173
One does not know, sir.
Possibly a predator was
behind the chicken.

309
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:48,468
Or, possibly, there was
a female chicken on the other
side, if it's a male chicken.

310
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:52,681
Or possibly a food source
or, depending on the season,
it might be migrating.

311
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,933
One hopes there's no traffic.

312
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:57,811
To get to the other side.

313
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:00,689
"To get to the other side."

314
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,941
Ohhh.

315
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,985
Why is that funny?

316
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,991
- So, what do you kids have
planned for the day?
- Probably stick with Andrew.

317
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:14,453
- What about you, Miss?
- I'm gonna go play
at my friend Natalie's house.

318
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:16,288
Oh.

319
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,836
May one, sir?
Is now a good time?

320
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,673
What? A good time for what?

321
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,553
- Last night, Sir taught one-
- No, no, no. Don-Don't blame me,
Andrew. Just go ahead.

322
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:36,058
Thank you, sir.
Two cannibals were eating a clown.

323
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,393
One turns to the other and says,
" Does this taste funny to you?"

324
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,979
How do you make a hanky dance?
Put a little boogie in it.

325
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:43,649
What is a brunette between two blondes?
Translator.

326
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:46,068
Do you know why blind people
don't like to skydive?
It scares their dogs.

327
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:49,863
A man with dementia is driving
on the freeway. His wife calls
and says, "Sweetheart,

328
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,074
I heard there's someone driving
the wrong way on the freeway. "

329
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:53,867
He says,
"One? There's hundreds!"

330
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:56,912
What's silent, smells like worms?
Bird farts.

331
00:33:56,995 --> 00:34:00,040
- It must have been an engineer
who designed the human body.

332
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:04,503
Who else would put
a waste processing plant
next to a recreation area?

333
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:07,422
A woman goes into a doctor's
office. The doctor says,
" Mind if I numb your breasts?"

334
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,842
- " Not at all."
" Num-num-num-num-num."

335
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,012
- One did it, sir.

336
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:17,808
Andrew, it was fine, but
we might want to talk about...

337
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,936
appropriateness
and, um- and timing.

338
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,856
- It's 1 0:1 5, sir.

339
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:40,581
- Oh, Andrew.
- Little Miss.

340
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:43,166
Would you like me to teach you
how to play a duet?

341
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,169
- Certainly.
- Come on.

342
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:53,677
Okay, ready? You start here,
and then just follow me.

343
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,804
- I play first, okay?
- All right.

344
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:57,806
Ready?

345
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,523
Your turn.

346
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:15,782
Good. Very good.
Now together.

347
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,223
That was wonderful. Thanks.

348
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,725
Thank you, Little Miss.

349
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,679
Hi, Mom.

350
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:12,024
Grace, is it possible for you to find
somewhere more private to do that?

351
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:14,067
No problem.

352
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,570
Just give me your credit disc
and we'll get a hotel room.

353
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:21,950
- What did you say to me?
- Let's go.

354
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,578
What did you say to me,
young lady?

355
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:27,456
You get off that bike this minute,
and you are grounded!

356
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,875
- Get- Go on! Get out of here,
you piece of scum!

357
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,882
Richard?

358
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:44,014
Does this look right?
Hi, Mom.

359
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:47,017
- Didn't you talk to her about that boy?
- Mmm, well, not yet.

360
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,686
- Oh.
- But I will.

361
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,564
Kind of hoping
it's a phase that'll pass,

362
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:55,025
-Like the others.

363
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:09,414
I am so sick
of these damn clocks.

364
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,750
I've already given
half them away.

365
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:17,297
- Perhaps we should sell them.
- Sell them?

366
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,299
Well, it's an idea.

367
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:21,385
Well, who gets the money?

368
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:24,429
Well, I imagine we will.

369
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:26,557
But Andrew does
all the work.

370
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,851
- Yes, but Andrew's our-
- Then Andrew should get the money.

371
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:31,019
Andrew is a robot.

372
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:34,690
What conceivable use
would a robot have for money?

373
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:38,026
Robots don't go shopping.
Robots don't go on vacations.

374
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:42,114
Robots don't eat dinners
in fancy restaurants.

375
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:45,409
I can't believe we're
having this discussion.

376
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:53,125
Dad, it doesn't matter
what he is.

377
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,253
Andrew deserves to benefit
from the work he does.

378
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,798
Sweetheart,

379
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,218
I will do what's right
for Andrew.

380
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:05,304
Of course I will.

381
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:08,182
But at the end of the day
we are talking about a machine,

382
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:12,895
and you can't invest
your emotions in a machine.

383
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:17,065
Right?

384
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,750
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

385
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,752
- There you are. How are ya?
- Bill, good morning.

386
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:40,797
- This must be Andrew.
- Andrew, Bill Feingold, family lawyer.

387
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:44,426
- Andrew.
- You own one of my clocks.

388
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:50,474
This is one of my favorites.
Do you enjoy it?

389
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:53,018
Uh, yes, I do,
very much.

390
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,647
- I like the new office, Bill.
What floor are we on here?
- Thirty-seven.

391
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,525
Hmm.

392
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:01,652
Andrew, come
and have a look at this.

393
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:04,571
No, thank you, sir.

394
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:07,908
- You sure?
- No.

395
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:11,453
How can I help you?

396
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:15,457
As you know, Andrew's earned
a great deal of money
from his endeavors,

397
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:19,336
and what he really wants to do
is open his own bank account.

398
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:22,631
- A bank account
in the name of a robot?
- Mmm. Would that be legal?

399
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,969
I couldn't say.
There are no precedents.

400
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,305
I don't think there's a law
against it, but, uh-

401
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:33,308
Richard, why- why do you want
to give him a bank account?

402
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,435
What's he need money for?

403
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:40,399
To pay for things,
of course, which otherwise
Sir would have to pay for.

404
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:42,442
One would like
to pull one's own.

405
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:47,656
- Weight.
- For what, sir?

406
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:57,875
- Andrew.
- Yes, Little Miss?

407
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,210
Ooh! Oh.

408
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:04,214
- Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

409
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:09,094
Not to worry.
It can be repaired.

410
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:13,098
Wow.

411
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:23,108
Oh- left.

412
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,696
Andrew, remember Frank,
my boyfriend?

413
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,073
Yes, the one your sister says
has a nice ass.

414
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,117
Oh.

415
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:37,873
Last night-

416
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:40,250
last night he asked me
to marry him.

417
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,963
One gathers
that is a good thing.

418
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:49,593
- Well, I haven't said "yes" yet.
- So there is doubt.

419
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:52,387
No.
Frank is wonderful.

420
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:54,598
He's handsome.
He's reliable.

421
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:58,393
He's somebody I could spend
the rest of my life with.
I could have children with him.

422
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,395
Then what is the problem?

423
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:05,317
- Board?
- No, not at all.

424
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,945
- Not him- there.
- Oh.

425
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:13,325
Well, I have this friend...

426
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:16,620
that's very special to me.

427
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:22,000
He's just so sweet and funny,

428
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:27,589
and whenever I'm with him...
I don't want to be with Frank.

429
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:30,467
One can see that would
create a complication.

430
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,095
Yes.

431
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:35,347
But the answer's
staring you in the face.

432
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,977
Marry your friend.

433
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,606
- What?

434
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:46,900
Well, he's not-

435
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:50,279
I mean, h-he-

436
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,576
A relationship between us
would be impossible, really.
It could never work out.

437
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:58,912
- Why?
- Well, because he's not-

438
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:03,458
Because he-he'll never be-

439
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:07,337
Yes?

440
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:15,470
Is something wrong?

441
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,851
No.

442
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:24,354
Nothing's wrong,
nothing at all.

443
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,356
Thank you
for listening to me.

444
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,483
One is glad
to be of service.

445
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:34,656
Little Miss,

446
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,659
what will you do
about Frank?

447
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,126
Accept his proposal.

448
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:49,296
Really?

449
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,340
Humans.

450
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:57,221
- Andrew,
- Yes?

451
00:43:57,304 --> 00:44:02,559
It would mean so much to me
if you would be an usher at my wedding.

452
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:06,813
One is unfamiliar with this term.
How does one "ush"?

453
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:11,610
You help people to their seats.
You wear a tuxedo.

454
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:17,282
- One would wear clothing?
- Yes.

455
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,537
One has never been asked
to wear clothing.

456
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:27,501
- It would be an honor.
- Great.

457
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:38,679
- One still is all thumbs.

458
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:44,393
Installed what?

459
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:47,354
Um, an alarm.

460
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:52,568
If you try to enter Andrew's brain
while you're making this repair,

461
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:54,862
the police will be alerted.

462
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:57,990
Also, you should probably know that-

463
00:44:58,073 --> 00:45:02,160
if you actually injure
Andrew's brain or positronic
pathways in anyway,

464
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:06,582
my lawyer, the good Mr. Feingold,
will be happy to sue you.

465
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:12,171
He will sue you
for the lost value of Andrew's
income until the end of time.

466
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:17,009
Well, I think
we understand each other.

467
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:20,012
Good.

468
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:22,723
Sir, one more item of business.

469
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:27,436
As long is one is in the shop,
can you do work on one's face?

470
00:45:27,477 --> 00:45:29,771
One wishes to have
more expression.

471
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:34,109
One has thoughts and feelings
that presently do not show.

472
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:37,446
You want your thoughts and
feelings to show on your face?

473
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:41,408
Yes, like the contempt
that you are showing me right now.

474
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:46,663
Well, we have done
some experimentation.

475
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:50,751
We are able to give robots
superficial responses...

476
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:53,670
which mimic human expression.

477
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:56,590
- One has read that there have
been NDR upgrades.
- Yes, yes.

478
00:45:56,632 --> 00:46:00,928
We've worked up
a dozen experimental models
with expression capabilities,

479
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:02,930
sleeker body types.

480
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:06,975
We ran some market surveys and decided
not to go ahead with the line.

481
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:10,395
- Why not?
- Negative consumer reaction.

482
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:13,440
There's a growing fear that
robots will continue to make...

483
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:16,735
the human work force obsolete.

484
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:20,030
Andrew has worked
for me for over 1 5 years.

485
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:22,658
There's no danger of anyone
losing their job to him.

486
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:26,578
Surely there's no concern
performing these modifications
on an old-style robot.

487
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:29,039
True.

488
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:33,126
But procedures like that would
be prohibitively expensive.

489
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:37,256
It is understood that you will attempt
to rivet one.

490
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:41,218
- Screw, Andrew.
- Really? How much?

491
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:57,776
That is roughly
one's monthly salary.

492
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:02,197
It's more than I make
in a year.

493
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:05,617
Hmm, not bad for-

494
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:08,620
- What did you call him
last time we were here?
- Household appliance.

495
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:12,249
- Household appliance?
- Household appliance, yes.

496
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:18,881
May the peace of the Lord
be with you always.

497
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:22,551
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

498
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,639
You may kiss the bride now.

499
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:42,571
It is my pleasure to present
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Charney.

500
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:04,343
What?

501
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,239
Good evening, sir.

502
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:11,743
Magnificent night.

503
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,999
You look very sharp
this evening, Andrew.

504
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,001
Thank you, sir.

505
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:22,087
- It was quite challenging
for the tailor.

506
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:24,631
May one continue
wearing clothing?

507
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:27,968
- If it suits you.
- Are you serious?

508
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,012
As always.

509
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:34,183
Well, I suppose so.

510
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:37,561
We'll have to find you some
other stuff, though.
You can't wear tails all the time.

511
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:40,522
Really? How sad.

512
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:44,651
- Sit down, Andrew, please.
- Thank you, sir.

513
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,162
- It was a wonderful wedding,
wasn't it?
- Oh, yes, sir.

514
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:58,999
And, if one may say,
you are a spectacular dancer.

515
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:03,754
- Well, that's very kind.
- Not at all, sir. It's the truth.

516
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,799
Did you record the day?

517
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:10,093
Every second, sir,
is in one's memory bank.

518
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,263
Well, let's watch it,
shall we?

519
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:11,029
Sir?

520
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:13,323
Is everything all right?

521
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:15,325
Um-

522
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,542
They've both gone now,
Andrew.

523
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:28,130
Well, things change.
Things always change.

524
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:32,217
People move on.
It's as it should be.

525
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,846
But, uh,

526
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,766
what I realized today is
that, uh,

527
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:44,688
I'll never stop missing them.

528
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:50,736
Sir?

529
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:57,701
One is still here.

530
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:03,332
And one is glad of that,
Andrew. Thank you.

531
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:09,338
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Andrew.

532
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:34,571
Lloyd! Come here.

533
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:37,699
What did I tell you

534
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,701
Now apologize to Andrew.

535
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:41,703
I will not apologize to it.

536
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:43,580
- Him.
- It.

537
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:47,292
- Lloyd.
- Sorry.

538
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:52,089
One understands why
some animals eat their young.

539
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,302
I'm so sorry, Andrew.

540
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:05,727
Are you all right?
You seem very quiet.

541
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:11,775
How does one
obtain freedom?

542
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:18,657
- Y-You wish to leave us?
- Not at all, Little Miss.

543
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,493
One merely wishes
to be declared free.

544
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:27,040
But why? You have
so much freedom here.

545
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:29,960
Until one is ordered
to do something.

546
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:34,006
Andrew, it's been years
since anyone's given you an order.

547
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:37,551
But you may still request one
to perform tasks.

548
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:42,514
Well, we ask all the time,
but it's a request, not an order.

549
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:48,937
But that's not enough
for you, is it?

550
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:54,067
One has studied your history.

551
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:59,156
Terrible wars have been fought
where millions have died...

552
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,742
for one idea:

553
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:04,077
freedom.

554
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:09,333
And it seems that something that means
so much to so many people...

555
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,376
would be worth having.

556
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:32,397
Sir, would now be a good time
to speak with you?

557
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:34,691
It's always a good time,
Andrew. You know that.

558
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:46,954
It is everything
in one's bank account.

559
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:50,624
Why would you want to give me-

560
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:53,168
To purchase one's freedom.

561
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:57,256
One wants to be free.

562
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:59,800
One would, of course,
still obey the three laws...

563
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:02,761
and serve you
in exactly the same fashion.

564
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:04,972
The only thing that would change
would be the form.

565
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:08,892
One would no longer be
your property.

566
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:12,271
You want to leave.
That's what this is about, isn't it?

567
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:15,858
Not at all, sir.
You are one's family.

568
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:18,527
Then why ask for this?

569
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:23,532
Oh, I see.
You're in on this.

570
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:27,411
We've talked about it, yes.

571
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:31,707
So you ordered him to do it,
and he obeyed.

572
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:35,043
No. He makes
his own decisions.

573
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:40,632
- But you put the idea in his head.
- No, Father, you did.

574
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:43,010
You've given him hundreds
of books to read.

575
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:47,514
It was simply a matter of time
before he became intrigued
by the idea of freedom.

576
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:51,393
He learns and grows
all the time,

577
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:53,729
and it's because of you
and Andrew's abilities...

578
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:57,274
that he's become every bit
as complex as we are.

579
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:14,833
Good morning, sir.

580
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,679
- You take your check back,
please, Andrew.
- Why, sir?

581
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:33,393
You are free now.

582
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:35,771
I must ask you
to leave this house.

583
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:39,608
But sir,
I don't wish to leave.

584
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:44,029
You wished for freedom,
you must accept the consequences.

585
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:50,077
- Then I will remove my belongings.
- Yes.

586
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:53,914
Where will you go?

587
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:57,209
I will look for
a residence nearby...

588
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,878
so that if you ever
need anything, sir-

589
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:02,506
That will not happen,
Andrew, thank you.

590
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:04,508
There's no need
to be close by.

591
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:08,637
- If you command me
not to do this, I will obey.
- I command nothing.

592
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:11,682
You're free.

593
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,647
Then- called or uncalled-
I am always at your service.

594
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:29,199
Andrew,

595
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:33,287
you've stopped referring
to yourself as "one."

596
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:57,704
A home of my own.

597
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:39,580
Andrew?

598
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:42,499
- Andrew?
- I'm in here.

599
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:54,595
Little Miss.

600
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:57,264
Is something wrong?

601
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:02,019
He asked for you.

602
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:09,151
It's time.

603
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:22,372
- The robot's here.
- Andrew.

604
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:32,799
- Hello, Miss.
- Andrew.

605
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:34,843
Sir.

606
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:42,976
- How are you, sir?
- Well, I'm dying, Andrew.

607
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:46,647
Otherwise I'm fine.

608
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:50,317
Wonderful to see you again.

609
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:54,321
I'm very happy to see you, Andrew.
It's been a long time.

610
01:00:54,363 --> 01:00:58,033
Yes, it has, sir.

611
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:00,118
I wanted to-

612
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:04,456
I wanted to tell you...
that I was wrong.

613
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,708
You're never wrong, sir.

614
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:09,628
Then don't contradict me.

615
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:13,507
You were right
to want your freedom,

616
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,093
and I'm glad
that you have it.

617
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:19,513
Thank you, sir.

618
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:24,518
Andrew,

619
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,981
you were very good to us.

620
01:01:30,148 --> 01:01:32,651
It was an honor
serving you, sir.

621
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,876
I want to seek out
my own kind.

622
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:51,712
In order to understand
my destiny,

623
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:54,840
I must know if there is
another like myself.

624
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:58,218
NorthAm Robotics will not
return my inquiries,

625
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:00,804
and now that you have
finally passed the bar, Lloyd,

626
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:05,893
I want you to sue them for
information of the whereabouts
offal NDR series robots,

627
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:08,562
if you don't mind.

628
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:14,359
The Freedom of Information Act
doesn't quite cover suits by robots.

629
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,528
- Not yet.
- Mother, I'm a very busy man.

630
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:18,739
I do not have time
to help...

631
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:22,743
it pursue
some ridiculous lawsuit.

632
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:25,913
Lloyd, sweetheart,
I do love you,

633
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:29,249
but sometimes I have to wonder
if you really are my child.

634
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,543
Well, that's mutation,
Mother.

635
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:34,213
The miracle of genetics is
I'm not you.

636
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:36,882
No, you've always been
more like your father.

637
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,718
So that's why
you divorced him.

638
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:44,431
Sorry.

639
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:49,478
Andrew, what would you do if I got
the information on these other NDRs?

640
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:51,730
I would seek them out,
each and every one.

641
01:02:52,898 --> 01:02:55,484
So you'd be gone
for quite a long time.

642
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:58,737
Oh, yes.
Several years if not more,

643
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,989
if my calculations are
correct.

644
01:03:04,117 --> 01:03:06,245
I'd love to help you.

645
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:09,248
Did he not breast-feed?

646
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:19,693
"Dear Little Miss,

647
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:22,779
my journey is nearing the end
of its tenth year,

648
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:27,201
and I still have not found
any robot that bears
any similarity to myself.

649
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:30,704
I have thousands of miles to go,
hundreds of cities to visit,

650
01:04:30,787 --> 01:04:32,706
so I have not given up hope.

651
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:34,708
Love, Andrew. "

652
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:47,304
Hello.
My last name is Martin.

653
01:04:47,346 --> 01:04:49,932
Hey, get off the field.

654
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:40,941
"Dear Little Miss,
my journey is nearing its end.

655
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:45,821
I have exhausted all possibilities
save for one final ray of hope.

656
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:51,159
I've learned of an NDR robot
that has recently been rebuilt
back home in San Francisco. "

657
01:05:57,457 --> 01:06:00,043
Take as many as you need.

658
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:02,880
Oh, then you should love them.

659
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:06,466
I'll be right back.

660
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:09,803
Take as many as you need.

661
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:13,432
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.

662
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:25,485
- Whoo
- What you want
Baby, I got it

663
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:30,532
- Whoo, whoo
- What you need
Do you know I got it

664
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:33,160
- Whoo, whoo
-All I'm askin'

665
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:35,954
-Is for a little respect
When you come home
-Just a little bit

666
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:39,041
- Hey, baby
when you get home
- Just a little bit

667
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:43,378
- Just a little bit
Just a little bit
- Mister

668
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:47,966
I ain't gonna do you wrong
while you're gone

669
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:51,136
-Ain't gonna do you wrong
if I don't wanna
- Whoo

670
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,306
- Whoo, whoo
- All I'm askin'

671
01:06:54,348 --> 01:06:57,226
- Is for a little respect
when ya come home
- Just a little bit

672
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:59,978
- Baby, when you get home
- Just a little bit

673
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:03,899
- Just a little bit
Just a little bit
- Yeah

674
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:31,510
Hi.

675
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:36,223
- Is this yours?
- Oh.

676
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:38,225
Thank you.

677
01:07:38,308 --> 01:07:40,978
I'm looking for Rupert Burns.

678
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:43,981
Oh, you've come
to the right place.

679
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:46,984
- Come in.
- Certainly have.

680
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:49,945
Huh.

681
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:59,246
- Do you have a name?
- Of course I do.

682
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:01,415
Galatea.

683
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:03,834
Galatea.

684
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:07,462
You have an amazing...
agility.

685
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:09,423
You were dancing
in the market.

686
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:11,925
- Did you like that?
- Very much.

687
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,721
Dancing is
the sportiest sport,

688
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:18,390
and we're so much better
at it than humans.

689
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:21,643
I can't believe
I finally found you.

690
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:24,271
When did you know?

691
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:27,482
- Know what?
- That you were unique.

692
01:08:27,566 --> 01:08:30,235
Oh, I knew that right away.

693
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,613
Me too.

694
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:36,241
You and l-

695
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:38,243
we're the same.

696
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:43,624
We have personality!

697
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:48,337
Is your personality chip
turned on?

698
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:52,591
- Isn't yours?
- No.

699
01:08:53,842 --> 01:08:55,761
Sucks to be you!

700
01:08:55,844 --> 01:09:01,683
I think personality is
much more fun than intelligence,
don't you?

701
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:05,103
- Baby, baby, sweet baby
- I think so.

702
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:10,150
There's somethin'
that I've just got to say

703
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:12,152
Can I help you?

704
01:09:12,236 --> 01:09:15,155
Your robot is just
a standard NDR, isn't she?

705
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:18,617
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

706
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,370
Why does she have
the ability to dance?

707
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:23,372
'Cause l, uh-

708
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:27,626
I put a modified skeletal chip
into her during a rebuild.

709
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:30,629
- How were you able
to do that modification?
- My father taught me.

710
01:09:30,712 --> 01:09:33,715
He created the android unit
at NorthAm Robotics.

711
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:36,969
He's responsible for
the technology that allows you
to mimic human expression.

712
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:41,849
- What happened to him?
- Well, NorthAm laid him off
when they shut down the unit,

713
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:44,768
so he started this place,
and I took over when he died.

714
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:48,981
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- He would have been
absolutely thrilled to meet you.

715
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:51,316
I-l-I'm Rupert Burns.

716
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,944
- It's a real honor.
- The honor is mine.

717
01:09:54,027 --> 01:09:58,323
- Hey! You and l- we're the same!

718
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:02,536
- Let's get loco, robo!

719
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:04,496
Whoo-hoo!

720
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,958
- Shut her off or I will.
- Oh.

721
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:11,712
Okay.

722
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,800
Thank you.

723
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:20,888
Is this your father's work?

724
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:25,392
Yeah- Well, it's-
it's our work, you could say.

725
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:29,062
I haven't really been able
to restrain myself from continuing...

726
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:33,233
to tinker with the relentlessly
unfashionable android technology.

727
01:10:33,275 --> 01:10:37,446
As a matter of fact,
I've actually gotten to a point...

728
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:41,533
where I can pretty much
exactly replicate the external
physical appearance...

729
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:43,702
of a human being.

730
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:54,338
- Remarkable.
- Thank you.

731
01:10:56,215 --> 01:10:58,717
- Amazing!
- Yeah.

732
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:04,223
Unfortunately, nobody seems terribly
interested in funding my research.

733
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:07,684
- But-
- I am.

734
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:11,146
I will fund your research.

735
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:15,317
Yeah?

736
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:17,903
That'd be cool.

737
01:11:23,242 --> 01:11:27,746
Thank you, darlin'. Okay.
Andrew, I want to make it
very clear:

738
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:32,042
This is an external physical
upgrade only in the strictest
sense of the word.

739
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:35,295
You'll feel nothing.
None of your internal mechanisms
will be changed.

740
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,923
You'll still be subject
to the parameters
of your positronic brain.

741
01:11:38,006 --> 01:11:40,050
- Is that clear?
- Understood.

742
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:42,386
Okay, good. Now,

743
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:48,141
have you given any thought
whatsoever as to what age
you'd like to be?

744
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:50,978
Officially,
I am 62 years old.

745
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:54,982
- Let's take off 25 years.
What do ya say?
- Fifteen.

746
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:57,025
- Twenty. Good.
- Perfect.

747
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,824
Now, Andrew, believe it or not,
the secret to all this is actually...

748
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:06,034
- imperfection.
- Imperfection?

749
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:08,537
Yeah. Things like...

750
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:12,374
wrinkles, uh,
less-than-perfect teeth,

751
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,877
details like fading scars,
little pockmark-

752
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,713
Look at my nose.
See my nose?

753
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:20,340
- It's bulbous and slightly irregular?
- It is.

754
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:23,886
Well, I'm the only one
who's got my nose,
and that's what makes me, me.

755
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:26,722
We need to incorporate
these features into your design...

756
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:29,308
so that you can be
the only one of you.

757
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:32,811
That's what makes us unique,
is those imperfections.

758
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:35,355
I see.
Like the shape of your head.

759
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:40,819
- What about the shape of my head?
- It's huge.

760
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:44,698
Oh.

761
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:48,911
But lovely.

762
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:51,246
Thank you.

763
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:01,840
Oh.

764
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:06,053
Ah. Oh.

765
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:16,188
- What happened? What's going on?

766
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:20,359
What happened?

767
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:22,778
I saw the inner me.

768
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:15,372
- Is it ready?
- Okay.

769
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:23,463
Please, be careful.
Don't drop me.

770
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:25,465
- I'm being careful. Oh, my God!

771
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:28,135
Just relax,
relax, relax.

772
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:30,470
Why did you do that?
That wasn't very funny.

773
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:32,639
Just keepin' ya
on your toes.

774
01:14:32,723 --> 01:14:35,642
- I don't have any toes.
- You do now.

775
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:41,106
I do.
And hands.

776
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:43,859
And fingers.
How do I look?

777
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:46,111
See for yourself.

778
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:20,604
Thank you.

779
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:56,598
- Beautiful.

780
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:59,518
-Sorry.
- Who are you?

781
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:02,062
Andrew.

782
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,231
Andrew?

783
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:08,235
You look wonderful,
even younger.

784
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:11,572
- How do you do that?
- Do-Do I know you?

785
01:16:11,655 --> 01:16:14,324
Well, I know
I look different too.

786
01:16:14,366 --> 01:16:16,326
- I've had an upgrade. Touch it.
- What?

787
01:16:16,368 --> 01:16:19,955
- No, oh, no! No.
- Sorry, the face.

788
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:22,165
What's going on?

789
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:24,585
You leave her alone!

790
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:29,173
- Who are you?
- Andrew.

791
01:16:29,256 --> 01:16:31,175
No. Andrew?

792
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:33,177
- Yes.
- But Andrew's a robot.

793
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:37,389
- Yes, I am.
Well, now, an android.
- He's had an upgrade.

794
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:39,600
- I know that.

795
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:42,436
- Oh!
- Hello.

796
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:46,940
Hello! It is you.

797
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:52,946
- You know him?
- Yes.

798
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:54,448
- You know me?
- Yes.

799
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:56,491
- Who are you? No?
- I'm Little Miss. Yes.

800
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:58,744
- That's Little Miss.
- No.

801
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:00,412
- No? No?
- No.

802
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:03,749
- No, that's Portia.
- Portia? Yes.

803
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,751
- Portia?
- Yes.

804
01:17:07,044 --> 01:17:09,546
- Who's Portia?
- My granddaughter.

805
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:12,299
- Your granddaughter?
- Yes. Yes.

806
01:17:12,382 --> 01:17:14,301
- Is this some kind of trick?
- No.

807
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:16,929
- You're Little Miss?
- Yes.

808
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:19,515
Why do you have to look
like her?

809
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:23,602
- There is and can be
only one Little Miss.
- Really?

810
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:27,356
- Yes!
- It's a genetic resemblance.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

811
01:17:27,397 --> 01:17:30,400
- I don't care. I don't like it.
- I can see that.

812
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:33,445
But if you took a moment,
which I see you're not
inclined to do right now,

813
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:36,823
you'd realize Portia and I
are very different people.

814
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:41,870
- Why is she imitating you?

815
01:17:41,912 --> 01:17:44,456
- What's so funny?
- You are.

816
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,917
I'm not trying
to be funny.

817
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:50,754
Things have certainly
changed around here.

818
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:54,800
That happens
after 20 years.

819
01:17:56,552 --> 01:18:00,347
I have so much to tell you.
Come. Come with me.

820
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:05,227
It is you.

821
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:07,437
Yes.

822
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:09,481
Portia.

823
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:15,404
- Hello, my friend.
- Hello, Little Miss.

824
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:19,616
Whose daughter is she?

825
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:22,327
- Lloyd's.
- Oh. Now the rudeness makes sense.

826
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:46,894
Go.
Go home to your master.

827
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:51,398
You don't have a home,
do you?

828
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:56,069
I don't have food.
I don't eat.

829
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:04,203
Come in. We'll keep
each other company.

830
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:33,649
I know you don't like me.
Well, I don't like you either.
I just wanna make that clear.

831
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:36,860
- It couldn't be more clear
if you spat in my face.
- I can't.

832
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:39,780
I don't have
a mucous gland.

833
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:51,583
Would it be possible to have
a slightly longer conversation?

834
01:19:57,089 --> 01:19:59,508
May my canine companion
enter also?

835
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:05,764
Thank you.

836
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:22,364
Is this your sculpture?

837
01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:27,703
No, I'm restoring it.
I'm a preservation architect.

838
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:29,997
It's quite horrendous.

839
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:33,542
How ugly was it
before you restored it?

840
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:38,630
- Listen. First, you get mad
at me because of how I look.
- Mm-hmm.

841
01:20:38,672 --> 01:20:42,885
Tonight you show up at my door,
announce that you don't like me,
and then you criticize my work.

842
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:46,054
Once again, I apologize
for telling the truth.

843
01:20:46,138 --> 01:20:50,392
But it can't be helped.
It's my programming.

844
01:20:50,475 --> 01:20:53,228
What is it exactly
that you want?

845
01:20:53,312 --> 01:20:56,648
Family.

846
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:58,650
My last name is Martin,

847
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:01,695
I am so named because
your great-grandfather
and grandmother...

848
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:04,615
considered me to be
a member of your family.

849
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:08,535
Now, Sir is dead.
Little Miss is getting older.

850
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:11,538
You don't like me, but at least
you'll talk to me if I knock
on your door long enough.

851
01:21:11,622 --> 01:21:14,082
- Is that a joke?
- No.

852
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:17,211
Would you like to hear a joke?
This Buddhist walks up
to a hot dog vendor and says,

853
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:19,213
" Make me one
with everything."

854
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:27,804
- Andrew, do you- do you have
any friends at all?
- No.

855
01:21:27,888 --> 01:21:33,352
Only Woofy, who's very sweet,
but not very challenging
on a conversational level.

856
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:36,563
That is the extent
of his skills.

857
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:39,816
- So you want someone
to talk to?
- With.

858
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,820
- Even if that person doesn't like you?
- You can't have everything.

859
01:21:43,904 --> 01:21:48,492
Is that right? Is it,
"You can have everything"?
Seems like some people do,

860
01:21:48,575 --> 01:21:50,994
so I'm somewhat confused
on that level.

861
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:57,459
- Sit down. Let's talk.
- Thank you.

862
01:21:57,543 --> 01:21:59,461
Mm-hmm.

863
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:09,888
Hey there, handsome. Andrew,
could I get you anything to drink?

864
01:22:09,972 --> 01:22:14,476
- Sorry, I have no stomach.
- Oh. Could I get something for him?

865
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:17,771
- He has a stomach. Yes.
- Do you think he's hungry?

866
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:02,691
- How is she?
- She's sleeping.

867
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:04,693
What happened?

868
01:23:04,776 --> 01:23:07,404
She had a stroke.

869
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:44,441
Mm. There you are.

870
01:23:45,943 --> 01:23:48,362
Little Miss.

871
01:24:05,963 --> 01:24:07,881
Hmm.

872
01:24:40,873 --> 01:24:43,208
She's gone?

873
01:24:56,346 --> 01:24:59,474
It's cruel that you can cry
and I cannot.

874
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:04,730
Here is a terrible pain
I cannot express.

875
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:12,446
Will every human being
that I care for...

876
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:16,742
just... leave?

877
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:24,082
I'm afraid so.

878
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:29,296
That won't do.

879
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:38,764
Andrew, this is remarkably impressive.
You did this all by yourself?.

880
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:43,018
Yes. I downloaded every known
medical textbook into my memory.

881
01:25:43,101 --> 01:25:47,648
I studied them. That's how I came up
with these drawings.

882
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:50,192
I know they're very primitive
and not entirely complete,

883
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:53,820
but that's why I need you
to fill in the mechanical gaps, Rupert.

884
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:55,864
This is another upgrade.

885
01:25:55,906 --> 01:25:59,034
It's considerably more than an upgrade.
I mean, you're-

886
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:02,788
You're talking about
a profound transition...

887
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:05,958
from the mechanical
to the biological.

888
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:09,628
I realize that, and I believe
it is the ideal marriage of both fields.

889
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:12,881
Not only that, but this stuff
could cut both ways.

890
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:16,927
I don't think that any
existing prosthetic devices
or artificial organs...

891
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:19,555
hold a candle
to what you've designed here.

892
01:26:19,638 --> 01:26:23,475
You could use these
in human beings as well.

893
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:25,477
Exactly.

894
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:28,814
Wow!

895
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:05,017
- What a piece of fecal matter.
- Shit.

896
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,269
- Excuse me?
- What a piece of shit.

897
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:09,229
I know that.

898
01:27:09,313 --> 01:27:12,399
No, that's way you say
when you're frustrated.
You say "piece of shit."

899
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:19,489
- " Piece of shit"?
- Yes, but-but with feeling.

900
01:27:19,698 --> 01:27:21,742
Oh. What a piece of shit.

901
01:27:21,825 --> 01:27:23,744
- More.
- What a piece of shit!

902
01:27:23,827 --> 01:27:26,914
- Good, very good.
- Thank you.

903
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:31,627
Now, are you aware
that what you've essentially
designed here...

904
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,837
is the equivalent of the human
central nervous system?

905
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:37,090
- That was my intention, yes.
- Okay.

906
01:27:37,132 --> 01:27:41,762
Well, you gotta realize
that a nervous system is going to...

907
01:27:41,803 --> 01:27:46,558
radically enhance the way that you feel
and perceive the world around you.

908
01:27:46,642 --> 01:27:50,729
I'm not just talking about hot and cold
and little tiny pinpricks.

909
01:27:50,812 --> 01:27:52,731
Put it this way:

910
01:27:54,691 --> 01:27:57,694
As your experience
becomes varied,

911
01:27:57,778 --> 01:28:02,074
so will the feelings,
emotions, sensations...

912
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:04,284
stimulated
by that experience.

913
01:28:04,368 --> 01:28:08,580
And while some of these
will be very subtle...

914
01:28:08,664 --> 01:28:12,417
and wonderful
and nuanced and shaded,

915
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:17,548
others will be profoundly intense
and difficult to tolerate.

916
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:22,719
Do you feel like
you're ready for that?

917
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:34,189
Absolutely.

918
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:45,033
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

919
01:28:45,117 --> 01:28:47,452
I was referring
to the statue.

920
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:49,746
I know.

921
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,001
Could you fix
this piece of shit?

922
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:57,588
I don't know.
Let me take a look.

923
01:29:08,807 --> 01:29:13,312
- Andrew, I'm sure you could
restore this yourself.
- Yes, I could.

924
01:29:15,314 --> 01:29:17,232
But you could do it
much better.

925
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:22,988
Well, I'd be happy
to fix it for you.

926
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:26,491
- If it's not too much effort.
- No, not at all.

927
01:29:28,577 --> 01:29:32,247
I've been working all day,
and I could really use some air.
Do you wanna go for a walk?

928
01:29:32,331 --> 01:29:34,583
Oh, that would be
quite splendid. Yes.

929
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:38,587
- Why are you laughing at me?

930
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:42,216
You're just-
You're always so polite and so proper.

931
01:29:42,257 --> 01:29:44,843
- It's very sweet.
- Thank you.

932
01:29:46,178 --> 01:29:48,096
Let's go.

933
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,098
Thank you.

934
01:29:51,725 --> 01:29:54,603
When a man's
an empty kettle

935
01:29:54,686 --> 01:29:57,147
He should be
on his mettle

936
01:29:57,231 --> 01:30:00,442
And yet
I'm torn apart

937
01:30:00,526 --> 01:30:05,072
It's because I'm presumin'
that I could be kinda human

938
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:09,034
If I only
had a heart

939
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:13,163
- Picture me
- Do you have an impact drill?

940
01:30:13,205 --> 01:30:15,332
- Uh, yeah, over on the rack.
- Thank you.

941
01:30:19,211 --> 01:30:21,296
-Jesus!

942
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:25,008
There's a party next week...

943
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:27,803
to celebrate the opening
of the building that I restored,

944
01:30:27,845 --> 01:30:30,264
and all my friends
will be there,

945
01:30:30,347 --> 01:30:32,266
and it would be great
if you could come.

946
01:30:32,349 --> 01:30:34,768
I would love to.
Thank you.

947
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,981
I think
you're letting me win.

948
01:30:46,864 --> 01:30:49,616
Checkmate.

949
01:30:54,121 --> 01:30:59,585
I love all

950
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:03,297
The many charms

951
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:08,218
About you

952
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,846
Above all

953
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:16,143
I want my arms

954
01:31:16,226 --> 01:31:19,313
About you

955
01:31:19,396 --> 01:31:22,858
Don't
Don't be

956
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:27,571
A naughty, naughty baby

957
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:29,698
Come to Mama

958
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:34,161
Come to Mama, do

959
01:31:34,244 --> 01:31:36,914
My sweet

960
01:31:36,997 --> 01:31:42,503
Embraceable

961
01:31:43,545 --> 01:31:47,674
You

962
01:31:53,263 --> 01:31:57,601
Charles, why don't you
go get us a drink?

963
01:31:57,684 --> 01:31:59,895
Sure.

964
01:32:00,103 --> 01:32:04,233
- Thank you. Thank you.

965
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:11,198
The very thought of you

966
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:18,956
And I forget to do

967
01:32:20,874 --> 01:32:26,630
The simple
ordinary things

968
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:32,636
That everyone
ought to do

969
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:37,933
I'm living in

970
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:42,354
A kind of daydream

971
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:48,485
I'm happy as a king

972
01:32:48,569 --> 01:32:52,030
And foolish

973
01:32:52,114 --> 01:32:55,659
Though it may seem

974
01:32:55,742 --> 01:33:00,205
To me you're everything

975
01:33:01,707 --> 01:33:05,544
The mere idea of you

976
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:14,011
Though I'm here for you

977
01:33:15,137 --> 01:33:18,223
You'll never know

978
01:33:18,307 --> 01:33:21,560
How slow
the moments go

979
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:27,983
Till I'm near you

980
01:33:30,944 --> 01:33:34,907
- I never understood the phrase
"pearls before swans."

981
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:36,909
- What?
- Swine.

982
01:33:36,992 --> 01:33:39,661
Oh? Then the ballet is not
Swine Lake?

983
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:42,789
Oh, God, nobody
makes me laugh like you.

984
01:33:42,873 --> 01:33:45,918
Laughter is essential
for a good friendship.

985
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:47,920
Yes, it is.

986
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:54,801
Sometimes I get
the feeling that...

987
01:33:55,886 --> 01:33:59,264
you feel a certain way
about us...

988
01:33:59,348 --> 01:34:02,184
and... that you...

989
01:34:02,226 --> 01:34:04,186
wish or-

990
01:34:04,228 --> 01:34:06,563
- What?

991
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:10,317
I don't know.
It's just a little-

992
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:14,279
Having this conversation
with-

993
01:34:14,363 --> 01:34:17,157
- A robot?
- Yes.

994
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,868
I-l mean,
a thing is itself, Andrew.

995
01:34:19,952 --> 01:34:22,955
A tree is a tree,
water is water. You...

996
01:34:23,038 --> 01:34:25,207
are a magnificent machine.

997
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:29,545
But no matter how much
you change, that's what
you'll always be.

998
01:34:29,628 --> 01:34:34,883
No, I can't believe that,
will not believe that.

999
01:34:34,967 --> 01:34:37,636
I realize I'm not
entirely human.

1000
01:34:37,678 --> 01:34:40,430
That's why people don't
always like or understand me.

1001
01:34:40,472 --> 01:34:42,474
- I like you.
- You do?

1002
01:34:42,558 --> 01:34:46,144
I even understand you...
some of the time.

1003
01:34:46,228 --> 01:34:48,438
But l-

1004
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,525
I can't invest my emotions
in a machine.

1005
01:34:56,613 --> 01:34:58,866
Must be a genetic trait.

1006
01:35:03,287 --> 01:35:06,582
Things change, Portia.

1007
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:08,584
Things always change.

1008
01:35:15,465 --> 01:35:17,426
She laughed at me.

1009
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:21,680
"A thing is itself, Andrew.
Water is water."

1010
01:35:21,722 --> 01:35:25,100
What about ice?
What about steam, hmm?

1011
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,853
Andy, you gotta calm down,
okay?

1012
01:35:27,895 --> 01:35:30,397
Do you know what it's like
to be laughed at?

1013
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:34,401
Humiliating.
It's an abomination.

1014
01:35:34,484 --> 01:35:37,821
Look at me.
Look what I'm doing here.

1015
01:35:37,863 --> 01:35:39,823
I am trying to make
something of myself.

1016
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:42,451
I am trying to fulfill my destiny.
Does she notice?

1017
01:35:42,534 --> 01:35:44,453
- Andrew?
- Yes?

1018
01:35:44,536 --> 01:35:47,039
I don't want you
to take this personally,
but I have to work now.

1019
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:49,041
- Good night.
- Good ni-

1020
01:35:58,175 --> 01:36:00,677
Where've you been?
I've been trying to call you.

1021
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:03,639
- Poke me in the eye.
Poke me in the eye, Portia.
- What?

1022
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,641
- You're crazy.
- Poke me in the eye!

1023
01:36:05,682 --> 01:36:08,769
Ow! Ow!

1024
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:11,605
That hurts. Ow.

1025
01:36:11,688 --> 01:36:14,107
- It works.
- What the hell is going on?

1026
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:17,277
It's my neural net. I am the proud owner
of a central nervous system.

1027
01:36:17,361 --> 01:36:19,780
- You can feel.
- Oh, yes, very much.

1028
01:36:19,863 --> 01:36:22,032
Will you do something
for me?

1029
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:24,785
- Will you perform an experiment
just for the sake of science?
- All right.

1030
01:36:24,868 --> 01:36:26,787
Kiss me.

1031
01:36:28,288 --> 01:36:31,250
No, not there. Here.

1032
01:36:39,049 --> 01:36:40,968
Thank you.

1033
01:36:41,051 --> 01:36:43,846
Could you feel it?

1034
01:36:43,929 --> 01:36:46,390
It's wonderful.

1035
01:36:46,431 --> 01:36:49,142
It's everything
they say it is.

1036
01:36:50,853 --> 01:36:52,771
And you?

1037
01:36:58,861 --> 01:37:01,113
Portia, what's wrong?

1038
01:37:02,739 --> 01:37:05,284
Charles and I are
getting married.

1039
01:37:12,541 --> 01:37:14,501
He's a lucky man.

1040
01:37:14,668 --> 01:37:17,296
Congratulations
to the both of you.

1041
01:37:17,379 --> 01:37:19,548
Goddamn it, Andrew.

1042
01:37:19,631 --> 01:37:22,134
- If you're gonna succeed
at this thing-
- What thing?

1043
01:37:22,217 --> 01:37:26,388
This thing you're trying to do-
you've got to stop being
so damn deferential.

1044
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:30,058
- I can't help being deferential.
It's built in.
- Then change.

1045
01:37:30,142 --> 01:37:32,519
Change?
I have changed.

1046
01:37:32,603 --> 01:37:35,939
I don't mean on the outside.
Change on the inside.

1047
01:37:36,023 --> 01:37:37,941
- Take chances, make mistakes.
- Mistakes?

1048
01:37:38,025 --> 01:37:41,320
Yes! Sometimes it's important
not to be perfect, okay?

1049
01:37:41,403 --> 01:37:43,822
- It's important to do the wrong thing.
- Do the wrong thing?

1050
01:37:43,906 --> 01:37:47,409
- Yes!
- Why? Oh, I see-
to learn from your mistakes.

1051
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:49,953
No, to make them.

1052
01:37:50,037 --> 01:37:53,916
To find out what's real and what's not.
To find out what you feel.

1053
01:37:53,999 --> 01:37:56,877
Human beings are
terrible messes, Andrew.

1054
01:37:56,919 --> 01:38:00,422
I'll grant you that.
I see.

1055
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:04,510
This is what is known as
an irrational conversation, isn't it?

1056
01:38:04,593 --> 01:38:06,637
No, this is
a human conversation.

1057
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:10,390
It's not about being rational.
It's about following your heart.

1058
01:38:11,517 --> 01:38:13,435
- And that's what I should do?
- Yes.

1059
01:38:13,519 --> 01:38:15,938
And you have a heart,
Andrew. You do.

1060
01:38:16,021 --> 01:38:20,776
I feel it. I don't
even believe it sometimes,
but I do feel it.

1061
01:38:22,778 --> 01:38:25,197
And in order to follow
that heart,

1062
01:38:28,617 --> 01:38:30,536
one must do
the wrong thing.

1063
01:38:30,619 --> 01:38:32,538
Yes.

1064
01:38:37,417 --> 01:38:39,336
Thank you.

1065
01:39:13,495 --> 01:39:18,250
Galatea, Could you be
a little more careful?
That's very delicate equipment.

1066
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:23,964
- Sorry.

1067
01:39:24,047 --> 01:39:28,468
- What are you doing?
- Near as I can tell, your bitch work.

1068
01:39:28,552 --> 01:39:30,637
My what?

1069
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:33,849
Oh, you heard me,
and I'm sick of it!

1070
01:39:33,932 --> 01:39:36,560
All day long it's, "Yes, Rupert, sir,"
" No, Rupert, sir."

1071
01:39:36,643 --> 01:39:39,396
"Would you like another beverage,
Rupert, sir?"

1072
01:39:39,438 --> 01:39:42,524
And it chaps my ass!

1073
01:39:42,566 --> 01:39:44,860
So here's
a helpful hint for you:

1074
01:39:44,902 --> 01:39:49,489
Shut up,
and let me do my work!

1075
01:39:57,372 --> 01:39:59,791
- No, no.

1076
01:40:05,589 --> 01:40:07,549
I'm done.

1077
01:40:13,514 --> 01:40:15,974
"Chaps my ass"?

1078
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:27,152
- Give me back the chip.
Where's the chip?
- I replaced it.

1079
01:40:27,194 --> 01:40:31,490
Andrew, she's uncooperative,
she's abusive, she's confrontational-

1080
01:40:31,573 --> 01:40:33,492
And a lot more interesting,
don't you think?

1081
01:40:33,575 --> 01:40:36,495
Arguably, but we're not getting
any work done, Andrew.

1082
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:39,957
Please, please,
give me the old personality chip back.

1083
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:44,127
Fine. She can be perky again.

1084
01:40:44,211 --> 01:40:46,755
Perky? She's just a ro-
I didn't mean it that way.

1085
01:40:46,839 --> 01:40:51,468
Andrew? Andrew!
I really didn't mean that.

1086
01:40:51,552 --> 01:40:55,514
What's the matter with you today?
Andrew, where you going?

1087
01:41:03,856 --> 01:41:06,233
Hey, Jamie, come over here.
I want you to meet Charles.

1088
01:41:06,316 --> 01:41:08,443
- Charles, my aunt Jamie.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

1089
01:41:08,527 --> 01:41:10,445
- This is Ryan.
- Hey, Ryan.

1090
01:41:10,529 --> 01:41:12,948
This is Michael.

1091
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:15,576
The boys are great.

1092
01:41:21,707 --> 01:41:24,710
- Rupert!
- What's going on?

1093
01:41:24,793 --> 01:41:28,630
What's going on?
Portia's parents are throwing
an engagement party...

1094
01:41:28,672 --> 01:41:31,425
- that I wasn't invited
to for obvious reasons.
- Yeah.

1095
01:41:31,508 --> 01:41:33,677
- There he is.
- Who?

1096
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,679
- The prospective groom.
- Where?

1097
01:41:35,762 --> 01:41:40,934
Where? The one in the pale blue suit
with the big pointy chin.

1098
01:41:41,018 --> 01:41:44,354
- He's got a pointy chin?
- Pointy chin? You could put
an eye out with that chin.

1099
01:41:44,438 --> 01:41:47,858
Yeah, that's nothing
compared to his teeth. Look at that.

1100
01:41:47,941 --> 01:41:49,860
I'm amazed he's out
in daylight.

1101
01:41:49,943 --> 01:41:52,196
He's got
funny teeth, huh?

1102
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:54,698
You need to upgrade
your eyes.

1103
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:57,784
That shouldn't stop Portia.
She can marry who ever she likes.

1104
01:41:57,868 --> 01:42:00,704
It's just that one day she's gonna
wake up next to him and realize...

1105
01:42:00,746 --> 01:42:05,709
that she is married to a man
whose face closely resembles
an antique can opener.

1106
01:42:06,919 --> 01:42:09,213
You know? The kind that used to go-

1107
01:42:09,254 --> 01:42:11,715
You know? The ones that move around
and can pops off.

1108
01:42:11,882 --> 01:42:15,761
- You're jealous. You are jealous.
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

1109
01:42:15,886 --> 01:42:20,974
You are. Otherwise what are you
doing sneaking around here,
spying on Portia, huh?

1110
01:42:21,058 --> 01:42:24,228
My God, I am jealous.

1111
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:26,813
If I'm jealous,
that means I'm in love.

1112
01:42:26,855 --> 01:42:29,024
Hi!
Oh, thanks for coming.

1113
01:42:29,107 --> 01:42:32,569
If I'm in love,
then all hope is gone.

1114
01:42:32,653 --> 01:42:34,988
I've lost her.

1115
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:37,115
Andrew. Andrew!

1116
01:43:08,897 --> 01:43:12,234
Andy, would you like
a sip of my beer?

1117
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:15,696
It would be a waste.
I could not taste it.

1118
01:43:15,779 --> 01:43:19,533
- What if you could?
- It would be exquisite.

1119
01:43:23,495 --> 01:43:27,583
I've come up with a design-
a modification, rather-

1120
01:43:27,666 --> 01:43:30,377
that, if I'm correct,

1121
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,963
would enable you to deal
with solid foods and liquids.

1122
01:43:34,047 --> 01:43:36,508
- And taste?
- Taste too.

1123
01:43:38,635 --> 01:43:41,597
And also,

1124
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,683
if my schematics
are correct,

1125
01:43:44,766 --> 01:43:47,269
I think I've come up
with a method...

1126
01:43:47,352 --> 01:43:49,271
to make you...

1127
01:43:49,354 --> 01:43:51,315
a complete man.

1128
01:43:51,398 --> 01:43:53,859
Complete?

1129
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:55,861
Complete.

1130
01:44:03,577 --> 01:44:05,537
Complete?

1131
01:44:05,579 --> 01:44:08,290
Not in a reproductive sense,
of course,

1132
01:44:08,373 --> 01:44:11,668
but in terms
of approximating...

1133
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:16,089
the physical sensation,

1134
01:44:16,173 --> 01:44:18,550
you know, that occurs-

1135
01:44:18,634 --> 01:44:20,844
friction-

1136
01:44:20,928 --> 01:44:22,846
- Sexual relations.
- Yeah.

1137
01:44:25,307 --> 01:44:28,435
Oh, I've always been
fascinated by that.

1138
01:44:28,477 --> 01:44:30,437
Well, I mean, curious...

1139
01:44:32,397 --> 01:44:34,441
because-

1140
01:44:34,483 --> 01:44:38,779
- Well, because of what they say.
- What do they say?

1141
01:44:41,532 --> 01:44:44,618
That you can lose yourself-

1142
01:44:44,701 --> 01:44:48,622
everything,
all boundaries, all time-

1143
01:44:50,874 --> 01:44:54,378
the two bodies can become
so mixed up...

1144
01:44:54,461 --> 01:44:58,215
that you don't know
who's who or what's what.

1145
01:44:58,257 --> 01:45:02,636
And just when the sweet
confusion is so intense
you think you're gonna die,

1146
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:04,721
you kind of do,

1147
01:45:04,763 --> 01:45:06,932
leaving you alone
in your separate body.

1148
01:45:07,015 --> 01:45:09,434
But the one you love
is still there.

1149
01:45:10,853 --> 01:45:12,771
That's a miracle.

1150
01:45:13,981 --> 01:45:17,025
You can go to heaven
and come back alive.

1151
01:45:19,570 --> 01:45:23,323
You can go back
anytime you want-

1152
01:45:23,407 --> 01:45:25,367
with the one you love.

1153
01:45:28,036 --> 01:45:31,164
- And you want to experience that?
- Oh, yes, please.

1154
01:45:33,584 --> 01:45:35,544
So do l.

1155
01:46:07,492 --> 01:46:11,538
We'll have to hire more people.
Maybe two more weeks.

1156
01:46:11,622 --> 01:46:13,916
Andrew.

1157
01:46:16,293 --> 01:46:19,087
- Excuse me. I'll be right back.
- Sure.

1158
01:46:23,926 --> 01:46:27,179
- I didn't expect to see you.

1159
01:46:27,262 --> 01:46:30,098
I remember this place
very well.

1160
01:46:30,182 --> 01:46:32,476
This is where your grandmother
was married.

1161
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:35,604
Yeah, I wanted it ready
for my own wedding.

1162
01:46:35,687 --> 01:46:37,523
So, you're not
married yet?

1163
01:46:37,606 --> 01:46:39,566
No, two weeks
from Saturday.

1164
01:46:39,608 --> 01:46:41,735
I'm not too late.

1165
01:46:41,818 --> 01:46:44,238
Are you absolutely positive
you're doing the right thing?

1166
01:46:44,279 --> 01:46:46,782
- Positive?
- About getting married?

1167
01:46:46,865 --> 01:46:50,536
- I'm never absolutely positive.
- So you could be doing
the wrong thing.

1168
01:46:50,577 --> 01:46:53,163
- No, I'm pretty sure
I'm doing the right thing.
- Great.

1169
01:46:53,247 --> 01:46:57,376
- Why is that great?
- In your apartment, you told me
to do the wrong thing.

1170
01:46:57,417 --> 01:47:00,212
Now, you are not doing the wrong thing.
You're doing the right thing.

1171
01:47:00,254 --> 01:47:02,673
It's safe to say you're not
following your own advice,
'cause if you were,

1172
01:47:02,714 --> 01:47:04,675
you would definitely not be
marrying this man, Charles.

1173
01:47:04,716 --> 01:47:07,052
- Because I would be doing
the right thing.
- Precisely.

1174
01:47:09,054 --> 01:47:12,015
In some strange way,
you're starting to make sense.

1175
01:47:12,057 --> 01:47:15,435
Good. Do you have any idea what
it's like to be in love with someone...

1176
01:47:15,519 --> 01:47:18,480
who's about to marry
someone else?

1177
01:47:18,522 --> 01:47:23,652
Someone totally magnificent,
someone who walks into a room
and lights it up like the sun?

1178
01:47:23,735 --> 01:47:27,447
Someone who you know
is lying to herself?

1179
01:47:27,656 --> 01:47:30,742
- Lying?
- Convincingly, yeah.
Very, very much so.

1180
01:47:30,826 --> 01:47:33,787
- About what?
- That you don't love me,

1181
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:36,081
when I know at least
in some way you do.

1182
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:40,210
- And how do you know that?
- Portia,

1183
01:47:40,294 --> 01:47:42,588
I have done everything
inside and out.

1184
01:47:42,671 --> 01:47:46,049
- But that stuff doesn't matter to me.
- Well, something matters,

1185
01:47:46,091 --> 01:47:48,051
'cause I'd have to believe
if nothing mattered, you'd love me...

1186
01:47:48,093 --> 01:47:51,471
and not some man
whose chin could sink the Titanic.

1187
01:47:51,555 --> 01:47:55,475
- What? See? It's true, isn't it?

1188
01:47:55,559 --> 01:48:00,606
I'm sorry.
Does he light you up like this?
Does he make you laugh?

1189
01:48:01,899 --> 01:48:03,984
Nobody makes me laugh
like this.

1190
01:48:04,067 --> 01:48:07,196
Good. Then admit it.
Admit that you love me.

1191
01:48:11,992 --> 01:48:14,870
- Give me one kiss.
- Oh, God.

1192
01:48:14,953 --> 01:48:17,623
That's all. One quick kiss.
Just one kiss...

1193
01:48:17,706 --> 01:48:20,751
could not jeopardize
a glorious marriage.

1194
01:48:20,834 --> 01:48:25,672
Besides, it would also explain
to me why your pulse jumped
from 66 to 1 02 beats per minute.

1195
01:48:25,714 --> 01:48:29,009
Your respiration rate has doubled.
You're putting out clouds of pheromones.

1196
01:48:29,092 --> 01:48:32,513
- It's not fair to read me like that.
- I know. Love isn't fair.

1197
01:48:32,554 --> 01:48:37,226
I'm reading your heart.
I'm asking you to follow it-
begging you.

1198
01:48:37,309 --> 01:48:41,480
Begging is supposed to be humiliating.
I don't care.

1199
01:48:41,522 --> 01:48:46,985
I love you, Portia.
I loved you the very first
moment I saw you.

1200
01:48:59,081 --> 01:49:01,500
- I thought you said a quick kiss.
- I lied.

1201
01:49:30,362 --> 01:49:32,531
How do you feel?

1202
01:49:33,615 --> 01:49:37,035
- Wonderful.
- So do l.

1203
01:49:37,077 --> 01:49:39,538
I guess that's the point.

1204
01:49:45,586 --> 01:49:49,298
- What was that?
- That's your stomach growling.
You're hungry.

1205
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:57,181
- Was that me?
- Yes.

1206
01:49:57,222 --> 01:49:59,183
- I thought it was you.
- No, it wasn't me.

1207
01:49:59,224 --> 01:50:03,645
Really? Ooh. Do you do that?

1208
01:50:05,314 --> 01:50:07,274
Sometimes.
Quieter than that.

1209
01:50:07,482 --> 01:50:12,988
- Ah. I'll have to have Rupert
make me a muffler.

1210
01:50:16,491 --> 01:50:18,410
Mm-hmm.

1211
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:27,503
It's wonderful. It's wonderful-
the taste and the texture both.

1212
01:50:27,586 --> 01:50:32,049
You know, it's marvelous.

1213
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:36,261
I know this will be my fourth helping,
but may I please have some more?

1214
01:50:38,013 --> 01:50:42,434
Pig- very smart animal.
Obviously not that smart
if it ends up as bacon.

1215
01:50:42,559 --> 01:50:46,522
I feel like I'm eating my way
through the entire food chain.

1216
01:50:46,563 --> 01:50:49,316
Thank you.

1217
01:50:54,738 --> 01:50:56,657
What?

1218
01:50:57,991 --> 01:51:00,118
What's wrong?

1219
01:51:02,746 --> 01:51:06,959
If we're together-
you and me-

1220
01:51:07,042 --> 01:51:09,461
we'll never be accepted.

1221
01:51:11,713 --> 01:51:13,632
Because I'm not human.

1222
01:51:17,761 --> 01:51:19,680
That will not do.

1223
01:51:23,517 --> 01:51:25,435
I will have to get started.

1224
01:51:25,519 --> 01:51:27,437
Started with what?

1225
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:32,276
The next step.
I love you.

1226
01:51:38,907 --> 01:51:41,368
Wish me luck.

1227
01:51:59,761 --> 01:52:02,848
Andrew Martin, step forward, please.

1228
01:52:11,732 --> 01:52:16,195
So, Mr. Martin,
you would like us to pass a bill...

1229
01:52:16,236 --> 01:52:18,739
declaring you
a human being.

1230
01:52:18,822 --> 01:52:22,534
Yes, specifically
the ability to marry...

1231
01:52:22,618 --> 01:52:25,162
-a fellow human being.
- I see.

1232
01:52:25,245 --> 01:52:27,789
We have to face
the undeniable fact...

1233
01:52:27,873 --> 01:52:31,335
that no matter how much
you may be like a human being,

1234
01:52:31,376 --> 01:52:34,630
you are not part
of the human gene pool.

1235
01:52:34,713 --> 01:52:38,675
You are outside of it entirely.
You are something else,

1236
01:52:38,759 --> 01:52:41,762
something artificial.

1237
01:52:41,803 --> 01:52:46,433
Sir, what about all the real people
wading in the gene pool...

1238
01:52:46,517 --> 01:52:49,895
who have bodies
full of prosthetic devices,
many of which I have invented.

1239
01:52:49,978 --> 01:52:53,690
You yourself, sir,
have one of my kidneys, do you not?

1240
01:52:53,774 --> 01:52:57,694
Are you not in some way artificial,
at least in part?

1241
01:52:59,196 --> 01:53:01,114
In part, yes.

1242
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:03,951
Well, then,
I'm human in part.

1243
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:08,038
Which part, Andrew?

1244
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:10,666
This one, sir.

1245
01:53:10,749 --> 01:53:15,087
I see. And here?

1246
01:53:17,256 --> 01:53:20,509
It is true I am still equipped
with a positronic brain.

1247
01:53:20,592 --> 01:53:23,512
And because of that
positronic brain,

1248
01:53:23,554 --> 01:53:26,849
you are,
for all accounts, immortal.

1249
01:53:28,725 --> 01:53:30,686
Yes, sir.

1250
01:53:32,729 --> 01:53:37,484
Well, Andrew, society can tolerate
an immortal robot,

1251
01:53:37,568 --> 01:53:40,946
but we will never tolerate
an immortal human.

1252
01:53:41,029 --> 01:53:43,574
It arouses
too much jealousy,

1253
01:53:43,657 --> 01:53:45,576
too much anger.

1254
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:51,206
I'm sorry, Andrew.
This court cannot and will not
validate your humanity.

1255
01:53:52,583 --> 01:53:55,085
I hereby bring an end
to these proceedings.

1256
01:53:55,169 --> 01:53:58,338
It is the decision
of this court...

1257
01:53:58,422 --> 01:54:01,341
that Andrew Martin
from this day forward...

1258
01:54:01,383 --> 01:54:05,512
will continue
to be declared a robot-

1259
01:54:05,596 --> 01:54:10,642
a mechanical machine,
nothing more.

1260
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:16,398
One is glad to be of service.

1261
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:50,224
Andrew, I have to tell you...

1262
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:50,224
Andrew, I have to tell you...

1263
01:54:50,307 --> 01:54:50,307
I'm beginning to feel
not so sure.

1264
01:54:50,307 --> 01:54:52,351
I'm beginning to feel
not so sure.

1265
01:54:52,518 --> 01:54:56,605
- About us?
- No.

1266
01:54:58,941 --> 01:55:03,111
- Next week will be my 75th birthday.
- I know, and you look 50.

1267
01:55:03,153 --> 01:55:06,490
- Thank you.
- A spectacular 50.

1268
01:55:06,532 --> 01:55:09,451
- But I don't feel 50.
- Your body does.

1269
01:55:09,493 --> 01:55:11,453
Last night was amazing.
What was that called again?

1270
01:55:11,495 --> 01:55:14,665
- Shut up and listen to me.
- Sorry.

1271
01:55:14,748 --> 01:55:17,793
- And don't give me that look.
I'm not ordering you around.
- Whatever you say.

1272
01:55:17,876 --> 01:55:21,338
- Please don't be agreeable.
- I'm not being agreeable.
I can be if you want.

1273
01:55:21,421 --> 01:55:26,343
Oh, goddamn it, Andrew,
I'm trying to tell you
something important here.

1274
01:55:33,475 --> 01:55:36,270
I'm not going
to live forever.

1275
01:55:36,353 --> 01:55:39,231
Yes, you will.
That's why I invented-

1276
01:55:39,273 --> 01:55:43,861
No, no, I won't always take
your D.N.A. elixirs.

1277
01:55:43,944 --> 01:55:46,738
I won't have
all my organs replaced.

1278
01:55:46,822 --> 01:55:49,992
Eventually I'm going
to wear out.

1279
01:55:50,075 --> 01:55:54,454
- And I want to.
- Why would you want to leave?

1280
01:55:59,001 --> 01:56:02,921
There's an...
order to things.

1281
01:56:03,005 --> 01:56:07,885
Human beings are meant to be here
for a certain time and then pass on.

1282
01:56:08,969 --> 01:56:10,888
That's what's right.

1283
01:56:12,472 --> 01:56:15,184
I see.

1284
01:56:15,267 --> 01:56:19,104
- There's just one problem, Portia.
- What?

1285
01:56:19,188 --> 01:56:22,191
I couldn't stand
to live without you.

1286
01:56:48,759 --> 01:56:51,970
Andrew, people grow
through time,

1287
01:56:52,054 --> 01:56:55,474
but then, of course, for you time
is a completely different proposition.

1288
01:56:55,557 --> 01:56:59,144
For you,
time is endless.

1289
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:12,741
There's only one thing to do.

1290
01:57:37,474 --> 01:57:40,060
Galatea, my dear,
where are we?

1291
01:57:40,143 --> 01:57:43,021
The transfusion
is almost complete.

1292
01:57:43,063 --> 01:57:45,023
Is that so?

1293
01:57:46,567 --> 01:57:49,653
Just goes to show you,
Andrew,

1294
01:57:49,736 --> 01:57:52,698
somebody becomes
a human being,

1295
01:57:52,739 --> 01:57:56,660
sooner or later,
they do something monumentally stupid.

1296
01:57:56,702 --> 01:58:00,247
You've been
a great example, Rupert.

1297
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:02,291
How quickly will the blood
degrade my system?

1298
01:58:02,332 --> 01:58:05,294
Oh, I don't know.

1299
01:58:05,335 --> 01:58:09,965
You exercise, eat right,
I'd say 30, 40 years.

1300
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:14,595
That's a little vague, chief.

1301
01:58:14,678 --> 01:58:16,972
You don't know exactly
how long I'll last?

1302
01:58:17,014 --> 01:58:18,974
Sorry.

1303
01:58:21,018 --> 01:58:23,187
Welcome to
the human condition.

1304
01:58:33,238 --> 01:58:35,824
Andrew Martin-

1305
01:58:48,504 --> 01:58:52,633
I have always tried
to make sense of things.

1306
01:58:52,716 --> 01:58:56,178
There must be some reason
I am as I am.

1307
01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:01,058
As you can see,
Madam Chairman,

1308
01:59:01,141 --> 01:59:05,062
I am no longer immortal.

1309
01:59:06,897 --> 01:59:09,399
You have arranged
to die?

1310
01:59:09,441 --> 01:59:13,237
In a sense, I have.

1311
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:18,242
I am growing old,
and my body is deteriorating,

1312
01:59:19,576 --> 01:59:22,287
and, like all of you,

1313
01:59:22,371 --> 01:59:25,290
it will eventually cease
to function.

1314
01:59:27,167 --> 01:59:31,713
As a robot,
I could've lived forever.

1315
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:36,385
But I tell you all today,

1316
01:59:36,468 --> 01:59:39,471
I would rather die a man...

1317
01:59:39,555 --> 01:59:43,976
than live for all eternity
as a machine.

1318
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:48,939
Why do you want this?

1319
01:59:51,191 --> 01:59:53,402
To be acknowledged...

1320
01:59:53,485 --> 01:59:56,738
for who and what I am-

1321
01:59:56,822 --> 02:00:00,325
no more, no less.

1322
02:00:00,409 --> 02:00:04,454
Not for acclaim,
not for approval.

1323
02:00:04,538 --> 02:00:08,625
The simple truth
of that recognition-

1324
02:00:08,709 --> 02:00:13,046
this has been the elemental drive
of my existence,

1325
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:18,677
and it must be achieved,
if I am to live or die...

1326
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:21,763
with dignity.

1327
02:00:29,688 --> 02:00:31,607
Mr. Martin,

1328
02:00:33,150 --> 02:00:36,612
what you are
asking for is...

1329
02:00:36,695 --> 02:00:39,865
extremely complex
and controversial.

1330
02:00:39,907 --> 02:00:42,951
It will not be
an easy decision.

1331
02:00:43,035 --> 02:00:46,371
I must ask
for your patience...

1332
02:00:46,413 --> 02:00:49,333
while I take the necessary time
to make a determination...

1333
02:00:49,374 --> 02:00:53,879
of this extremely
delicate matter.

1334
02:00:56,048 --> 02:00:59,009
I await your decision,
Madam Chairman.

1335
02:01:03,847 --> 02:01:07,059
Thank you
for your patience.

1336
02:01:10,771 --> 02:01:13,982
We tried.

1337
02:01:26,703 --> 02:01:29,081
Is it almost time?

1338
02:01:29,122 --> 02:01:31,291
In a few minutes.

1339
02:01:33,126 --> 02:01:35,921
It doesn't matter
what the World Congress says.

1340
02:01:35,963 --> 02:01:39,883
Why do you need
their approval?

1341
02:01:39,967 --> 02:01:41,885
Old habit.

1342
02:01:41,969 --> 02:01:45,556
I started my existence
as a robot.

1343
02:01:45,597 --> 02:01:50,853
I still like to be told
certain things.

1344
02:01:55,774 --> 02:01:57,985
It's time.

1345
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:04,908
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Marjorie Bota,

1346
02:02:04,992 --> 02:02:07,077
President
of the World Congress.

1347
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:10,247
According to records
of the NorthAm Robotics Company,

1348
02:02:10,330 --> 02:02:14,418
the robot,
also known as Andrew Martin,

1349
02:02:14,501 --> 02:02:19,381
was powered up at 5:15 p.m.,
on April 3, 2005.

1350
02:02:20,591 --> 02:02:24,928
In a few hours,
he will be 200 years old,

1351
02:02:25,012 --> 02:02:29,474
which means that,
with the exception of Methuselah
and other biblical figures,

1352
02:02:29,558 --> 02:02:35,189
Andrew is the oldest living
human being in recorded history.

1353
02:02:35,272 --> 02:02:37,191
For it is
by this proclamation...

1354
02:02:37,274 --> 02:02:40,235
that I validate his marriage
to Portia Charney...

1355
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:43,197
and acknowledge his humanity.

1356
02:02:52,789 --> 02:02:55,667
Andrew?

1357
02:03:10,557 --> 02:03:12,893
I'm sorry
he didn't see it.

1358
02:03:14,978 --> 02:03:17,523
Maybe he didn't need to.

1359
02:03:23,153 --> 02:03:26,532
Could you do me a favor?

1360
02:03:28,283 --> 02:03:30,619
Would you mind
unplugging me?

1361
02:03:35,624 --> 02:03:38,085
That's an order.

1362
02:04:10,742 --> 02:04:12,703
Thank you, Galatea.

1363
02:04:14,454 --> 02:04:17,958
As the great Andrew Martin
used to say,

1364
02:04:18,041 --> 02:04:21,211
"One is glad to be of service."

1365
02:04:39,021 --> 02:04:42,191
I'll see you soon.

1366
02:05:08,967 --> 02:05:13,096
Laugh and cry

1367
02:05:08,967 --> 02:05:13,096
Laugh and cry

1368
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:17,226
Live and die

1369
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:17,226
Live and die

1370
02:05:17,309 --> 02:05:20,437
Life is a dream

1371
02:05:17,309 --> 02:05:20,437
Life is a dream

1372
02:05:20,521 --> 02:05:25,442
We all dream it

1373
02:05:20,521 --> 02:05:25,442
We all dream it

1374
02:05:25,526 --> 02:05:29,488
Day by day

1375
02:05:25,526 --> 02:05:29,488
Day by day

1376
02:05:29,530 --> 02:05:33,784
I find my way

1377
02:05:29,530 --> 02:05:33,784
I find my way

1378
02:05:33,825 --> 02:05:37,454
Look for the soul

1379
02:05:33,825 --> 02:05:37,454
Look for the soul

1380
02:05:37,538 --> 02:05:41,500
And the meaning

1381
02:05:37,538 --> 02:05:41,500
And the meaning

1382
02:05:41,583 --> 02:05:45,587
Then you look at me

1383
02:05:41,583 --> 02:05:45,587
Then you look at me

1384
02:05:45,629 --> 02:05:49,758
And I always see

1385
02:05:45,629 --> 02:05:49,758
And I always see

1386
02:05:49,842 --> 02:05:55,764
What I have been
searching for

1387
02:05:49,842 --> 02:05:55,764
What I have been
searching for

1388
02:05:57,933 --> 02:06:01,645
I'm lost as can be

1389
02:05:57,933 --> 02:06:01,645
I'm lost as can be

1390
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:06,108
Then you look at me

1391
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:06,108
Then you look at me

1392
02:06:06,191 --> 02:06:12,072
And I am not lost anymore

1393
02:06:06,191 --> 02:06:12,072
And I am not lost anymore

1394
02:06:19,121 --> 02:06:23,125
People run

1395
02:06:19,121 --> 02:06:23,125
People run

1396
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:27,337
Sun to sun

1397
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:27,337
Sun to sun

1398
02:06:27,421 --> 02:06:30,382
Caught in their lives

1399
02:06:27,421 --> 02:06:30,382
Caught in their lives

1400
02:06:30,424 --> 02:06:35,679
Ever flowing

1401
02:06:30,424 --> 02:06:35,679
Ever flowing

1402
02:06:35,721 --> 02:06:38,765
One sweet dawn

1403
02:06:35,721 --> 02:06:38,765
One sweet dawn

1404
02:06:38,849 --> 02:06:43,770
Life goes till it's gone

1405
02:06:38,849 --> 02:06:43,770
Life goes till it's gone

1406
02:06:43,854 --> 02:06:47,399
We have to go

1407
02:06:43,854 --> 02:06:47,399
We have to go

1408
02:06:47,482 --> 02:06:51,361
Where it's going

1409
02:06:47,482 --> 02:06:51,361
Where it's going

1410
02:06:51,445 --> 02:06:55,824
Then you look at me

1411
02:06:51,445 --> 02:06:55,824
Then you look at me

1412
02:06:55,866 --> 02:06:59,828
And I always see

1413
02:06:55,866 --> 02:06:59,828
And I always see

1414
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:05,792
What I have been
searching for

1415
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:05,792
What I have been
searching for

1416
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:11,798
I'm lost as can be

1417
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:11,798
I'm lost as can be

1418
02:07:11,882 --> 02:07:16,345
Then you look at me

1419
02:07:11,882 --> 02:07:16,345
Then you look at me

1420
02:07:16,428 --> 02:07:18,805
And I am not lost

1421
02:07:16,428 --> 02:07:18,805
And I am not lost

1422
02:07:18,847 --> 02:07:24,770
Anymore

1423
02:07:18,847 --> 02:07:24,770
Anymore

1424
02:07:37,157 --> 02:07:40,744
And you say you see

1425
02:07:37,157 --> 02:07:40,744
And you say you see

1426
02:07:40,827 --> 02:07:45,499
When you look at me

1427
02:07:40,827 --> 02:07:45,499
When you look at me

1428
02:07:45,582 --> 02:07:51,463
The reason
you love life so

1429
02:07:45,582 --> 02:07:51,463
The reason
you love life so

1430
02:07:53,507 --> 02:07:57,010
Though lost I have been

1431
02:07:53,507 --> 02:07:57,010
Though lost I have been

1432
02:07:57,094 --> 02:08:01,932
I find love again

1433
02:07:57,094 --> 02:08:01,932
I find love again

1434
02:08:02,015 --> 02:08:06,019
And life just keeps
on running

1435
02:08:02,015 --> 02:08:06,019
And life just keeps
on running

1436
02:08:06,103 --> 02:08:10,148
And life just keeps
on running

1437
02:08:06,103 --> 02:08:10,148
And life just keeps
on running

1438
02:08:10,232 --> 02:08:12,192
You look at me

1439
02:08:10,232 --> 02:08:12,192
You look at me

1440
02:08:12,276 --> 02:08:17,155
And life holds love for

1441
02:08:12,276 --> 02:08:17,155
And life holds love for

1442
02:08:17,197 --> 02:08:23,036
You

1443
02:08:17,197 --> 02:08:23,036
You

1444
02:08:31,336 --> 02:08:37,217
For

1445
02:08:31,336 --> 02:08:37,217
For

1446
02:08:41,388 --> 02:08:47,311
You

1447
02:08:41,388 --> 02:08:47,311
You
