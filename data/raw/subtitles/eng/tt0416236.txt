1
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,744
There it is.

2
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,812
Pretty much how I remember it.

3
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,184
I was younger than you
last time I was here, Simon.

4
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,516
Well, it's big.

5
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,281
Yeah, so I can get bigger pets here,
right, Mom?

6
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,657
Sure! Get a cow. Get a whole flock.

7
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,854
Herd.

8
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,625
That, too. What do you think, Jared?

9
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,828
Jared?

10
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,837
Okay. Here we go.

11
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,755
It's okay, Mr. Tibbs. It's okay.

12
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,755
It has that old people smell.

13
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,530
It's just an observation, not a judgment.

14
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,519
You're angry about the move. I get that.

15
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,156
Just what are you expecting
your silent protest will get you?

16
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,661
At least acknowledge this isn't
the way to deal with your anger

17
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,233
the way you said you were gonna do.

18
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,003
Say yes with your head.

19
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,469
Two blinks.

20
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,135
Nothing.

21
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,147
Mal, you and Simon take your stuff.

22
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,082
Wait in the foyer while I go look
for the main circuit breaker.

23
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,550
Okay, Mom.

24
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,749
- Get out of the car right now.
- You're not my mother, Mallory.

25
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,793
No, I'm worse,
because Mom doesn't believe in hitting.

26
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:59,024
- Come here, you little...
- And he's out of the car! Thank you!

27
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,896
Stop it! I'm not gonna let you
keep acting like a jerk!

28
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,935
- I'll do whatever I want.
- No, you won't!

29
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,335
Mom needs this to work, so cut it out!

30
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,839
- Simon, get her!
- I'm a pacifist.

31
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,804
You're so annoying.
You think you know everything!

32
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,744
- Well, I know stuff you don't.
- Like what?

33
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,043
Nothing.

34
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,786
- Thanks for having my back, bro.
- I don't do conflict.

35
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,788
- What are you doing?
- Unpacking.

36
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,864
Why? I told you it was only temporary.

37
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,331
Dad's coming tomorrow,
and he's gonna take us back with him.

38
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,029
- I know. But what about Mom?
- She can have Mallory.

39
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,935
Come on, Simon, we can't stay here.

40
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,235
Look at this place.
It's the house that time forgot.

41
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,242
- And it's got that...
- Old people smell, I know.

42
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,073
And what's this?

43
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,413
Salt. There's salt on the window.

44
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,045
I know. It's on all the windows.

45
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,817
Yeah, and that's not weird.

46
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,119
I'm guessing she put it there.

47
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,096
- Is that the nut bag and her husband?
- No.

48
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,655
That's Arthur Spiderwick,
you know, our great-great-uncle.

49
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:46,831
The little girl's the nut bag.
I mean, Aunt Lucinda, his daughter.

50
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,576
She's the one who lived here
before they took her away to the...

51
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,735
To the...

52
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,437
To the nut house.

53
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,413
Right.

54
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,450
And why'd she get taken there?

55
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,053
Because she said
her father was abducted.

56
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,280
By?

57
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,915
By faeries.

58
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,025
Exactly.

59
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,893
Our crazy aunt stayed here
her whole life and never left, ever!

60
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,728
That's not gonna happen to me, or you.

61
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,196
End of discussion.

62
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,744
Has anybody seen my keys?
I know I left them right here.

63
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,945
Nope.

64
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:41,022
I guess Aunt Lucinda
liked honey with her oatmeal, huh?

65
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,754
And tomato sauce.

66
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,567
Wow.

67
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,599
Where is my fencing medal, Jared?

68
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,763
- Hanging on your bed?
- It's not there anymore.

69
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,602
Well, find the bed
and you'll find your medal.

70
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,868
I'm not talking about the bed...

71
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,034
You know what?

72
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,409
I'm not acknowledging your existence
until you bring my medal back.

73
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,606
Promise?

74
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,115
Well, actually, you'd have to
acknowledge his existence

75
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,776
in order to receive the medal from him.

76
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,854
Thanks, Spock.
You're the pride of the Federation.

77
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,479
Jared, give it back.

78
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,887
I didn't take the stupid medal!

79
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,253
- You're such a liar!
- Conflict.

80
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,383
- Shut up, Simon!
- Shut up, Simon!

81
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,620
Hey!

82
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,032
We're not gonna do this.

83
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,699
New town. New house. New job.

84
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,135
This is our new life.

85
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,540
Let's not fall into old ruts, okay?

86
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,204
I know this house isn't perfect,
but we can make it work,

87
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,545
if we want to make it work.

88
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,742
- All right?
- All right, Mom.

89
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,816
Shut up!

90
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,033
Hi.

91
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,740
- Dad.
- Dad.

92
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,973
Yeah, we made it.

93
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,948
What's that noise in the background?

94
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,416
You know, scratch that.
I don't want to know.

95
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,386
- Just because I don't.
- I'm gonna go look for my medal.

96
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,047
I'll help you.

97
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,217
What?

98
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,290
It's your dad.

99
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,566
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, buddy.</i>

100
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,833
<i>How's the Addams Family mansion?</i>

101
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,738
Oh, the house? Yeah, it's great,

102
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,003
if you like big creepy houses
in the middle of nowhere.

103
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,308
<i>- Now, come on.
- Seriously. There's nothing here.</i>

104
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,645
<i>- You'll see.
- Yeah, well, listen...</i>

105
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,743
<i>- You're still coming tomorrow, right?
- Yeah, maybe. I'm gonna try.</i>

106
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,788
<i>- Why maybe?
- Look, don't worry. I'm coming.</i>

107
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,323
<i>There's something
we need to talk about.</i>

108
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,689
<i>But tomorrow might not work out, okay?</i>

109
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,627
<i>- Yeah, I understand.
- Okay, good.</i>

110
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,288
<i>- You'll try though, right?
- Absolutely.</i>

111
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,798
<i>But I'll see you soon, though. Definitely.</i>

112
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,027
Okay.

113
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,963
<i>- See you, Son.
- Bye, Dad.</i>

114
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,812
What did you say to him?

115
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,611
Can't you at least pretend
you want him to come and see us?

116
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,495
Jared Grace, put that broom down!

117
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,124
- There's something in the wall!
- Now!

118
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,398
You said you were gonna stop
hitting things when you got angry!

119
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,774
I know I said I was gonna stop yelling.
Please, please, don't do this.

120
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,809
We'll clean it up, Mom.
You go to bed. You need to sleep.

121
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,056
- Nice move, pinhead.
- Shut up.

122
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,719
Something's in there, moving.

123
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,128
Probably a red squirrel.
Very common in this region.

124
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,393
Or it could just be a rat.

125
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,701
We don't need any more holes
in the wall!

126
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,849
Great. I'll get blamed for that.

127
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,687
Check it out.

128
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,349
This is one of those things
they use to send food upstairs.

129
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,894
- What are they called?
- Dumbwaiter.

130
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,690
Hey, those are Mom's keys.

131
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,997
And my medal!

132
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,471
What? You still think I took it.

133
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,871
Yeah, Mal, you busted me.

134
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,910
I took your medal,
hid it here and re-plastered the wall.

135
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,103
I don't know how you did it.

136
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,080
I just know you did it,
because you always do it.

137
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,913
- And now you're gonna clean it up.
- You told Mom we were gonna clean it.

138
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,180
We means you.

139
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,323
Simon, don't you want to know
where this thing goes?

140
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,827
Not really.

141
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,811
Simon!

142
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,878
Simon, wake up!

143
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,046
I went up. It's a room,
a secret room, upstairs.

144
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,316
There's a desk and a chest,
and I found this book!

145
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,823
- Something was in there!
- A red squirrel?

146
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,020
No, not a squirrel.
Unless squirrels can spell.

147
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:35,223
It wrote in the dust on the desk,
"Jared Grace, leave this place."

148
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,501
Wow.

149
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,367
That's really... impossible.

150
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,837
It's late.

151
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,936
Just go to sleep.

152
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,261
"Do not dare to read this book,

153
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,762
"for if you take one fateful look,

154
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:10,301
"you barter at your life's expense
and face a deadly consequence."

155
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,030
What the...

156
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,145
How did you guys get out?

157
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,113
<i>Dear reader,</i>

158
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,708
<i>what you now hold in your hands
is the culmination of a life's work.</i>

159
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,685
<i>And you will soon see, as I have,</i>

160
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,622
<i>that there are fantastical creatures
living among us,</i>

161
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,353
<i>hidden through mimicry and magic.</i>

162
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,264
<i>This book will give you
the tools and techniques</i>

163
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,859
<i>needed to lift the veil
and see the unseen.</i>

164
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,112
<i>The secrets you are about to learn
have been kept hidden for ages,</i>

165
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,674
<i>secrets that many of this realm
would prefer to stay hidden.</i>

166
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,880
<i>The creatures you will meet
are truly a sight to behold,</i>

167
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,253
<i>and most of them do not
like being observed.</i>

168
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,885
<i>But, over time,
I have garnered their trust.</i>

169
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,863
<i>Some, I am quite happy to report,
I now call friend.</i>

170
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:26,329
<i>But a rare few are, quite frankly,
to be feared.</i>

171
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,238
<i>The darker forces of this realm
all live in service of one creature,</i>

172
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,173
<i>the ogre, Mulgarath.</i>

173
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:36,441
<i>The secrets herein are powerful,
more powerful than even I was aware.</i>

174
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,278
<i>Never before has knowledge
of the fantastical realm</i>

175
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,045
<i>been assembled in one tome.</i>

176
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,283
<i>And so I implore you, dear reader,
to use this information wisely,</i>

177
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,517
<i>for the ogre, Mulgarath,
seeks this knowledge</i>

178
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,787
<i>with relentless persistence.</i>

179
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,864
<i>If he were to obtain the information
in these pages,</i>

180
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,731
<i>I can assure you his intentions
would be of the vilest sort.</i>

181
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,598
<i>He assumes many forms,</i>

182
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,172
<i>and so you must constantly
be on guard.</i>

183
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,673
<i>I deeply fear that the more I learn,</i>

184
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,211
<i>the more I place everyone around me
in grave danger.</i>

185
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,016
<i>So, reader, beware.</i>

186
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,085
<i>I beseech you, beware.</i>

187
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,682
Mom!

188
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,284
- What's going on?
- Mom! Mom, please, help!

189
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,761
What happened to you?

190
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,493
- Hold still.
- Please, Mom, just cut it! Cut it!

191
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,001
- Okay, calm down.
- Mom, please!

192
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,038
Just cut me out! Cut it out!

193
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,697
Please, just get a scissors! I don't care!

194
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,799
- What happened?
- He ruined my hair! Get him out!

195
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,072
Jared, you've gone way too far this time.

196
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,240
- Mom, please! Please!
- What? I didn't do this!

197
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,512
I've been sitting in a footlocker
for the last two hours, reading!

198
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,847
Yeah, right!

199
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,353
Ask Simon.

200
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,189
Well, he was in a footlocker.

201
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,521
- Just cut me out!
- Field guide.

202
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,720
Mom, just cut it!

203
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,438
I'm not enjoying this.

204
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,135
I told you, I'll help you catch
a woodchuck or something.

205
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,678
I need the practice. Now, come on.

206
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,807
Simon!

207
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,178
That's not fair. He distracted me.

208
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,049
- What does "appease" mean?
- "Appease."

209
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,886
You know, placate, pacify, assuage.

210
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,085
- In English.
- To make nice.

211
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,263
Is that what you came out here to do?
Well, apology not accepted.

212
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:38,063
I'm not apologizing 'cause I didn't do it!
This did.

213
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,230
A brownie is living in the house
and wants us to leave.

214
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,308
Wow. That's incredible.

215
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,433
You can read!

216
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,603
I'm telling you,
something is in that house with us,

217
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,044
and Arthur Spiderwick knew about it,

218
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,240
and that's why he wrote this guide!

219
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,251
I'm a little lost.
Who needs to be appeased?

220
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,787
- The brownie?
- No, a boggart.

221
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,685
So there's a brownie and a boggart?

222
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,951
A brownie turns into a boggart
when it's angry,

223
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,751
and it got angry
when Mallory destroyed his nest.

224
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,420
It likes honey.

225
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,829
- That's why all the honey's there.
- Really?

226
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,663
Don't listen to him, Simon.

227
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,634
Come on, let's go eat.

228
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,532
Hello!

229
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,368
Hello?

230
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,079
Sorry I wrecked your home,
but I made you a new one.

231
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,610
And I got you some honey.

232
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,585
I read you liked it.

233
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,986
Hope you do.

234
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,527
Hope it, you know, appeases you.

235
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,159
I'll be over here.

236
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,395
I'm really hoping you actually exist.

237
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:31,935
Hello?

238
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,558
Oh! My, my, my.

239
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,830
That is just tasty, tasty, delicious honey.

240
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,830
So good! So yummy, yummy, yummy!

241
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,653
Wait! No! I won't hurt you!

242
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,018
Here, here, have some more honey!

243
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:22,287
I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I really shouldn't.
I mean, if you insist.

244
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,187
Oh, my, my, my! That is good!

245
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,357
Where are you? Why can't I see you?

246
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,926
You don't see us, but now you do.
But only if we want you to.

247
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,333
We? You mean
all the magical creatures

248
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,465
Arthur Spiderwick wrote about.

249
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,168
The book! Oh, my gosh!

250
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:43,543
I'm sorry, master, I've failed!
Failed, failed, failed!

251
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,845
Your instructions were simple,
"Protect the book."

252
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,546
And I did it, I hid it,
I bound it and I wound it.

253
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,986
I did my best, locked it in the chest!

254
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,821
But you looked and looked
and found the book!

255
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,226
And from the chest,
the thing was stolen!

256
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,231
You foolish boy!

257
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,095
Idiot! Are you blind?
I put a note right on the cover!

258
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,329
Can't you read?

259
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,235
Why do I write notes
when no one's gonna read the notes?

260
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,103
I'm sorry. Here! More honey!

261
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,506
No! I'm not falling for that!

262
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,040
Oh, that is so good.

263
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,218
And they say I've got anger issues.

264
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,412
"Protect the book. Don't let it get took!"

265
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,014
Right, you had to protect the book.
Who told you to protect it?

266
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,325
- Wait! What did I say?
- Protect the book, protect the book.

267
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,764
It wasn't complicated.
I just had to protect the book. That's all.

268
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,062
Arthur Spiderwick.

269
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,072
So he wrote it
and asked you to protect it.

270
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,039
I said, "Master, we must destroy it!"

271
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,373
He said, "We must protect the book.

272
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,470
"Keep it in the circle,
safe from the ogre."

273
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,379
Ogre? Do you mean Mulgarath?

274
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:56,147
All the years protecting it
now ruined by a little twit!

275
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,950
Circle, circle, little jerkle.
Little jerkle broke the circle!

276
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,116
Whoa! Stop! What circle?

277
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,386
Okay.

278
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,497
Look. Here, here.

279
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,903
So it protects the house
to protect the book.

280
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,339
- Safe from who?
- Them!

281
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,849
What? Who's them?
I don't see anything.

282
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,147
Tibbsy, come here, boy!

283
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,518
Breakfast time! Mr. Tibbs?

284
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,750
All right, what did you do
with Simon's cat?

285
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,055
They're not here for the cat.
They want the book!

286
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,263
What is that? What's out there?

287
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,664
It's goblins! Goblins are here.

288
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,169
And all because
you took the book out there

289
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,740
and practically waved it in their faces,
you little twerp!

290
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,172
Simon!

291
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,369
Go ahead!
Now look at the mess you made!

292
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,678
Simon! They're taking him away.
What's happening?

293
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,272
The Stone! The Stone!
Look through the Stone!

294
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:05,956
What the hell?

295
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,456
No! No!

296
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,853
- The book stays or we all die!
- I need it! Let go!

297
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,328
It must stay in the circle! In the circle!

298
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,890
Mom!

299
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,391
Mom!

300
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,997
- Mom! Where's Mom?
- She went to work, okay? I'm in charge.

301
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,935
Hey, where are you going?

302
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,408
Psycho.

303
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,382
Help me!

304
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,009
What are you doing? Help!

305
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,216
Help!

306
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,846
Give me, give me.

307
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,624
Give me a leg! Hey, give me!

308
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,887
Give me a leg! A leg!

309
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,656
That's not a leg!

310
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,631
This is a leg! Imbeciles.

311
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,534
Oh, my God.

312
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,068
Simon.

313
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:35,972
Don't move.

314
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,244
Slowly lift your foot.

315
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,167
Then we must shake on our alliance.

316
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,802
What? It's good.

317
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,776
- Who are you?
- I am Hogsqueal.

318
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,713
And I am here on a mission
to destroy the ogre, Mulgarath,

319
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,340
who killed my family!

320
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,545
Can you help me save my brother?
Please?

321
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,315
Yeah! Sure!

322
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,654
I was gonna suggest that
right after you let me out of this cage.

323
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,853
- So, come on! Free me!
- Okay, okay.

324
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,192
Get it open. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

325
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,891
Now get behind me
and keep your mouth shut.

326
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,558
Okay, here's our plan.

327
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:35,332
I will find a safe position over there
and create a distraction with my stick.

328
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,069
Then you leap out with your knife
and finish the beast yourself.

329
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,168
I like that plan.
That's a good plan. I'm smart.

330
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,940
What beast?

331
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,413
The ogre, of course! Mulgarath!

332
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,077
- I just want to save my brother.
- Again with the brother?

333
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,952
Okay, fine. If we kill them,
saving him will be much easier.

334
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,751
Trust me. Now drop that stone.

335
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,587
You'll need both hands
to choke a goblin.

336
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,786
But how do I see without...

337
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,262
Nailed him!

338
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:06,659
I have given you the Sight,
a gift only a hobgoblin can bestow.

339
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,965
Oh, gross!

340
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,267
You're welcome. Now, let's go.

341
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,009
- Simon!
- Jared.

342
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,054
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

343
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,687
Jared, what's happening?
Get me out of here.

344
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,225
Just hang on.

345
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,054
I'm gonna cut you out.

346
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,790
- Jared!
- Get back.

347
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,422
Hide.

348
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,659
Jared!

349
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,761
Mulgarath!

350
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,066
Mulgarath!

351
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,198
Mulgarath!

352
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,174
Mulgarath!

353
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,710
Mulgarath!

354
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,838
- What are they doing?
- Summoning Mulgarath. Get ready.

355
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:55,511
Mulgarath! Mulgarath! Mulgarath!

356
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,811
That's Mulgarath?

357
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,609
That's the ogre
you're all freaked out about?

358
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,744
That old man?

359
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,482
Don't be fooled
by what you think you see.

360
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,581
That's just what he wants.

361
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,589
I beg your forgiveness.

362
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:46,159
I asked my friends here
to invite you to a nice little meeting.

363
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,997
Then they got a bit overzealous.

364
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,101
That's a goblin for you.

365
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,007
My apologies.

366
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,040
What do you want with me?

367
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,244
It's not what I want with you.

368
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,651
It's what I want from you.

369
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,384
Arthur Spiderwick's field guide.

370
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,289
I know you found it.

371
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,257
That's right, you can simply
walk back the way you came.

372
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,628
Just give me the book.

373
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,293
I don't have it.

374
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,135
I don't. Look.

375
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,172
Search him!

376
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,208
What? If Mulgarath learns the secrets
in that book,

377
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,309
he could kill us all!

378
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,816
He's weak in his human form.
It's now or never.

379
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,045
Come! Death to the ogre!

380
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,246
Bird!

381
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,448
Delicious! Come back here!

382
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:43,120
I'll be back! Kill him if you get a chance!
Remember the plan!

383
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,421
Move!

384
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,226
Pockets. Search the pockets.

385
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,495
The pockets! No, these!

386
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,297
These are pockets, idiot!

387
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,668
Master, this is all we found.

388
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,780
Do they have the book?

389
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,645
No.

390
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:13,850
But I know where it is.
I'll go get it and give it to you. I swear.

391
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,022
I'm placing my trust in you.

392
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,698
If you give me the book,

393
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,961
your life will go on
as if nothing ever happened.

394
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,933
However, if you fail,

395
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,943
I'm afraid I'll have to find somebody else
to get my book for me.

396
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,745
Go. Go on.

397
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,340
Run along.

398
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,475
Go.

399
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:50,424
Mulgarath! Mulgarath! Mulgarath!

400
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,597
You failed me, Redcap!

401
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,469
There are two human boys
with the same faces.

402
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,340
The Jared and the not Jared.
We took the wrong one.

403
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:11,381
Then find the Jared,
get the book and kill them!

404
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,211
Kill them all!

405
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,614
Move out!

406
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,995
Stupid!

407
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,466
Stupid!

408
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,663
Those things were gonna kill me
over your stupid, stupid book!

409
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,637
- They're right over there.
- I can't take this.

410
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,538
Let's just get to the house
and give it to them.

411
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,373
Hey, it's not at the house.
It's right here in my backpack.

412
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,846
- What? Then let's just give it to them.
- No, they'll just kill us anyway!

413
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,883
Well, let's just...

414
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,679
- Give it!
- Stop!

415
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,980
Give it!

416
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,419
Book!

417
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,893
- Get them! Go! Go! Go!
- Come on!

418
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,028
After them!

419
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,434
Get them! Get them! Rip them apart!

420
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,169
But not the book! Don't hurt the book!

421
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,381
Jared! Jared! Over here!
Help me! Help me!

422
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,580
Come on!

423
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,348
- Calm down!
- Keep them away! Keep them away!

424
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,689
It's okay. There's a protective circle
around the house.

425
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,093
- We're safe inside it.
- There you are.

426
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,392
You know, Mom left me in charge,

427
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,865
so you can't just run off
without telling me.

428
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,902
- Get her.
- Mallory, this way, now!

429
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,062
Now! Now!

430
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,764
- What? Don't yell at me.
- Mal, come on! Come on!

431
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,307
Run to the front door, fast!

432
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,774
I'm not running anywhere,
and stop throwing rocks at me!

433
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,210
Listen to him!
You're surrounded by goblins!

434
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,008
Get inside the protective circle!

435
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,709
Oh, God, Simon,
he's got you in on this now?

436
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,219
For the last time,
there's no such thing as...

437
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,056
What's happening?

438
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,719
No, Mallory, they're short.
Aim below your knees. 10 o'clock.

439
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,489
10 o'clock!

440
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,892
Mallory! Mallory! 12 o'clock!

441
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,592
Behind you! Behind you! 6 o'clock!

442
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,998
3 o'clock! 3 o'clock!

443
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,751
Come back! You're safe. You're safe.

444
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,224
You're safe.

445
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,968
Now do you believe me?

446
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,466
Mom!

447
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,372
It's gonna be bad! It's bad!

448
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,412
- Oh, God.
- No, that's bad.

449
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,210
- Mom!
- Jared!

450
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,808
- What were those things?
- I told you, goblins.

451
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,410
It's okay, Simon. It's okay.

452
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,387
No, it's not okay! It's not! It's not!

453
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,651
He's right. What am I saying?
Of course it isn't!

454
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,283
How many of those things
are out there?

455
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,158
I don't know! I don't know! Okay?
Sit tight! I'll be right back!

456
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,825
Jared! God, he's gonna get us all killed!

457
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,698
I'll be right back. Keep pressure on that.

458
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,669
Pressure? What?

459
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:22,761
Jared?

460
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,865
Why are they doing this?
What do they want from us?

461
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,274
The book.

462
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,814
Oh, God!
They're coming from everywhere!

463
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,581
I know, I can see.

464
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,517
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

465
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,893
Where did you get that book?

466
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,254
So, the book was in here
with a big warning that said,

467
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,299
"Do not read," and you read it?

468
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,063
It's a book. I didn't think reading it
would unleash goblin fury, okay?

469
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,400
But that's the thing,
you never think of anything!

470
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,201
- You're always doing this!
- Yeah, right.

471
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,900
You don't think, you just do!

472
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,739
Maybe I could think if you'd stop talking.

473
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,437
You do stuff and we pay for it.

474
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:05,242
Hey, if you're so smart,
what do you think we should do with it?

475
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,249
If freaky goblins want this book,
I say we give it to them!

476
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,511
No!

477
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,052
Back off! The book stays here!

478
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,559
- Right here! Here, here, here!
- No! Mallory, no! No!

479
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,857
What is that hideous thing?

480
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,158
Haven't I made myself that clear?
Touch it and you'll pay!

481
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,290
- Stop it! Chill! Chill!
- Touch it and I'll bite your fingers off!

482
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,425
Get me some honey from the kitchen.

483
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:25,593
- What?
- Just do it!

484
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,297
Come on, try it! Try it!
I invite you to try it!

485
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,896
- Go!
- You'll be fingerless, you...

486
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,235
You, get away!

487
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,900
- You ruined everything!
- Okay, protect the book.

488
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,999
Okay, I promise.

489
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,703
- Mallory!
- I'm coming!

490
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,474
- Okay, honey's coming, honey's coming.
- Idiots!

491
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:41,108
- I don't need your stinking honey!
- Here, drink, drink.

492
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,814
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It's okay?

493
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,584
There is so much about this
that's not okay.

494
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,217
I don't even know where to start.

495
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,387
Why can I see him
without that stone thing?

496
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,986
Because he's letting you see.

497
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,534
Thimbletack, what happens
if goblins get the book?

498
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:01,696
You die, I die, we all die. Bye-bye.

499
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:05,333
- What does he mean, we all die?
- I think he means we all die.

500
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:09,140
He can't know the secrets. He can't!
The ogre is not to be trusted.

501
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,441
He's right. We can't give it to Mulgarath.

502
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,313
He'll just kill us anyway.
I heard him say so.

503
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,613
Then let's just burn it.

504
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:19,923
No!

505
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:20,991
No!

506
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,623
Give it! Give the book!

507
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:30,928
Give it!

508
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,668
Sorry, master! Forgive us!

509
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,138
Give the book!

510
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,616
Okay, okay, okay, wait!

511
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,550
You win. You are strong,
smart human boy.

512
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,612
So don't be foolish. Give us the book.
We'll leave you alone.

513
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,055
I don't believe you!

514
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,649
No!

515
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,389
Now you've done it! Now you will pay!

516
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,962
Book!

517
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,472
Book, book, book.

518
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:15,944
Book, book, book, book, book.

519
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,608
- It's cold.
- You can't stay in the circle forever.

520
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,585
And when you leave, here we will be.

521
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,766
Let me guess,
the book's got a charm on it.

522
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,738
Lest there fall any more harm on it.

523
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,002
Great.

524
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,239
- They're not leaving.
- I know.

525
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:52,372
- They're never leaving!
- I heard you.

526
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,747
- Why does he want that book so bad?
- I don't know.

527
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,342
Well, figure it out!

528
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,287
All I know is Mulgarath
can't break the circle without this book,

529
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,324
so we're safe as long as
we stay in the house.

530
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,892
Until when?

531
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:06,451
We stay here long enough,
we're gonna end up like her!

532
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,956
Wait a minute.

533
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,431
- She can help us.
- Aunt Lucinda? Are you kidding?

534
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,505
We don't even know her
or where she is!

535
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,935
I think I do.

536
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,565
She's at the Woodhaven Sanatorium.

537
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,837
But how do you get to her?

538
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:38,789
- There, all safe.
- Good. Now go. Make haste.

539
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,364
Okay, I think I have this figured out.

540
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,628
Some sort of secret tunnel system,
goes all the way to town.

541
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,703
About a mile, that way.

542
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,262
The first ladder you find, go up,
and the sanatorium's here.

543
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,568
Thanks.

544
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,274
You ready?

545
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,770
Oh, yeah. Now I'm ready.

546
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,714
- All right. Let's go.
- Mallory?

547
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:03,218
I already told you, Simon, you can't go.
Not with that leg, you'll slow us down.

548
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,912
I know, but I found this.
It'll make it easier for you to see.

549
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,634
Okay, Simon?

550
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,697
Go!

551
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:33,311
- Hey, are you there?
- Show yourselves!

552
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,555
Yeah, right here, on the porch!
Come to me on the porch!

553
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,750
Yeah, yeah, good.
Right here, over here.

554
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,486
Yeah, are you hungry?

555
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,427
- Right here on the porch.
- Come on. Hurry up. Get in.

556
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,296
Go! Go! Go!
They're coming! Open the door!

557
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,732
Jared, hurry!

558
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,928
- Come on!
- Get in, get in!

559
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,573
Let's go! Go, go, go!

560
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,284
Wait, wait, wait.

561
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,651
This way, this way, this way.

562
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,562
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

563
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,461
Dig! Dig!

564
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,334
Go!

565
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,501
"Goblin defenses.

566
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,136
"Tomato sauce burns the skin like acid.

567
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,305
"Vinegar fumes asphyxiates.

568
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,349
"Salt, blinding effect."

569
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,281
Are there more?
What does the book say?

570
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:46,686
- Step away from the book!
- Okay, okay, you open it.

571
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,925
Where is it?
Where did he put it? Where?

572
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,361
Oh, there.

573
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,230
Oh, no. Jared.

574
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,303
- What did you do with it? Liars! Liars!
- No, it wasn't me.

575
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,532
All of you, liars! Where's the book?

576
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,511
- You brought the book?
- We need to show it to Lucinda.

577
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,576
- Which way goes into town?
- Right.

578
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,551
Get the troll.

579
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,297
Now left. Go left!

580
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,172
- It's a mole troll.
- What?

581
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,406
Run!

582
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,931
This way!

583
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,698
Go, go, go!

584
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,869
Jared!

585
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,473
Jared!

586
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,014
Jared, come on!

587
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,838
Are you okay?
Oh, man, did I hit somebody?

588
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,541
Yes. Thank you!

589
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,781
Then you hit F1, tab, tab.

590
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,415
Then shift-return to get the total.

591
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,599
I know, it's a lot to remember,
but let's just go through it again.

592
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,441
Here you go.

593
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,283
So tomato sauce really kills goblins?

594
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,094
Jared, come on.

595
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,808
- You're really in a hurry.
- We're just really excited to see her.

596
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,847
- Those are nice flowers and sword.
- I take fencing.

597
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,075
Lucinda? You have visitors.

598
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,285
More salt.

599
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,863
There, there, there, now.
It's okay. It's okay.

600
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,490
Aunt Lucinda?

601
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,966
I'm Mallory Grace,
and this is my brother, Jared.

602
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,735
Our mom's Helen.

603
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,076
We have some questions.

604
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,741
- See, we moved into your house.
- What?

605
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,820
Oh, no, no, no.

606
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,979
No, it isn't safe.

607
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,818
Why have you done this?

608
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,757
Mom said you gave it to her
since she's the only living heir.

609
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,352
- No, you have to get out of there.
- We can't.

610
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,590
We don't have anywhere else to go.

611
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,100
- It isn't safe. You don't understand.
- Yes, we do.

612
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,268
We know everything. We've seen.

613
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,940
It's okay. They've seen.

614
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,783
Mallory, look.

615
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,574
No, no, not for you.

616
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,806
She's right.

617
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,281
Eat that and you'll never crave
human food again.

618
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,944
- How do you know that?
- I found this.

619
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,846
Your father's field guide.

620
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,256
Inside, quickly, quickly!

621
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,555
Quickly!

622
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:01,528
Do you know what you've done
by bringing it outside the circle?

623
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,800
Don't you know what could happen
if it falls into the wrong hands?

624
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,469
No, we don't.
That's why I brought it to you.

625
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,546
Then you haven't read it.

626
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,609
He did.

627
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,347
Then you know more than you should.

628
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,422
And your lives are in danger.

629
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,787
Didn't you read the note?

630
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,123
Please. We don't know what to do.

631
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,129
Can't you tell us something
that'll help us?

632
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:38,463
This book has brought nothing
but heartache and misery to my family.

633
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,607
I would say it was his life's work,
but, in truth, it was his life.

634
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:50,310
<i>The last day I saw him
he was so agitated,</i>

635
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,081
<i>almost delirious.</i>

636
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,350
<i>I remember him
running through the house,</i>

637
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,450
<i>a crazed look in his eyes.</i>

638
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,424
<i>That was the day he created the circle.</i>

639
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:11,840
<i>A book Mulgarath would use
to destroy all the other faeries.</i>

640
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,934
<i>And then nothing could stop him,
even humans,</i>

641
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:18,708
from becoming the most powerful
creature the world had ever known.

642
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:23,252
<i>My father immediately did everything
he could to protect us.</i>

643
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,877
<i>Everything except...</i>

644
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,580
Master must destroy the book!

645
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,954
No! We need to protect it!

646
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:32,654
Keep it inside the circle,
safe from the ogre!

647
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,960
I just need more time, Thimbletack.
I need more time.

648
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,126
But I didn't know
about the circle, you see.

649
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,603
<i>London Bridge is falling down</i>

650
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,900
<i>Falling down</i>

651
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,235
Oh, no!

652
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,934
<i>Falling down</i>

653
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:50,502
<i>London Bridge is falling down</i>

654
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,138
Lucy!

655
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,580
Come away from the toadstools!

656
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,118
- What?
- Stay inside the circle!

657
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,415
- I can't hear you!
- Lucy! No!

658
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:03,084
<i>London Bridge is falling down</i>

659
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:09,829
Daddy! Please, help me!
Somebody's dragging me, Daddy!

660
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,867
- Leave her alone!
- Daddy!

661
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:17,432
Lucy, come! Come! Stay there!

662
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,374
- Stay inside the circle!
- Daddy! Daddy, what's going on?

663
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:24,106
- What's happening?
- Don't go over the mushrooms! No!

664
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:28,215
What are those?
Daddy, what are those things?

665
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,615
Tell me!

666
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,549
Daddy! Daddy?

667
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,349
Daddy?

668
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,792
<i>The sylph protect
the entire faerie realm,</i>

669
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:42,991
<i>and the secrets my father discovered
put them in danger.</i>

670
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,194
<i>So they rescued him from the goblins,</i>

671
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,271
<i>but took him away from me.</i>

672
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,000
- Daddy!
- Lucy! I'll be back!

673
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,036
Each day,

674
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,273
I would stare down that drive,

675
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,845
and dream of him
walking up those steps

676
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,715
and holding me in his arms once again.

677
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,120
But he never did.

678
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:16,028
One night, I dreamt that I saw him
in the woods.

679
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,533
So I went out to look for him,

680
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,169
but something wouldn't let me.

681
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,776
When they say suicide
and you say goblins,
