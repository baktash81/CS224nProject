1
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,379
<i>I just read that money
as we know it is dead.</i>

2
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:27,117
Soon the world is only gonna
buy and sell products using Bitcoins.

3
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,385
It's like
a complicated math equation.

4
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:34,288
So, one day we're gonna buy things
with numbers from a math equation?

5
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,790
Dope, right?

6
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:38,992
<i>Malcolm Adekanbi is a geek.</i>

7
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:42,261
<i>Malcolm lives with his single mother
and has only one memory of his father.</i>

8
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,146
<i>Malcolm lives
in Inglewood, California,</i>

9
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:05,315
<i>in the Darby-Dixon neighborhood
referred to as The Bottoms.</i>

10
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,332
Give me your bike, nigga!

11
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:30,335
<i>Malcolm's friends,
Jib and Diggy, are also geeks.</i>

12
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:31,602
Yo.

13
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:35,338
Shit.

14
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,540
All I want to do is a zoom, zoom, zoom
and the boom, boom.

15
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:41,543
Word.

16
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,111
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy...</i>

17
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:46,013
<i>are all deeply obsessed
with '90s hip-hop culture,</i>

18
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,015
<i>submerging themselves
in the music,</i>

19
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:50,917
<i>watching old</i> Yo! MTV Raps
<i>episodes for fashion tips...</i>

20
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,585
<i>and using the slang.</i>

21
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:55,120
Huh?
Bro, that shit was whack.

22
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:57,255
- What?
- They were biting Brand Nubian.

23
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:58,723
That's not even possible.

24
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,891
Jackpot, niggas.

25
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:03,860
Gushy, gushy.
Mmm!

26
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:06,462
<i>Oh, did I mention
that Diggy was a lesbian?</i>

27
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:09,464
<i>Although from the way she dresses,
you might not have noticed she's a girl.</i>

28
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,868
Save her, Lord!
Yo, hallelujah! Hallelujah!

29
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,937
<i>Every Sunday, her grandmother asks
the church to lay their hands on her...</i>

30
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,306
<i>in order to
pray away the gay.</i>

31
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:23,108
Praise the Lord!

32
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:29,746
<i>- So, did it work?</i>
- You know.

33
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:33,082
I was watching Justin Bieber
the other night and I got a little moist.

34
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,550
Yeah?
So maybe.

35
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,987
- That's just because he's a little ho.
- That's true.

36
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,888
He's a very pretty nigga.
Yes, he is.

37
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,923
What's up, boss?

38
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:46,593
<i>For most geeks, a bad day
might be being the butt of jokes in class,</i>

39
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:50,896
<i>the occasional food prank and the worst...
being beat up by a jock.</i>

40
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,764
<i>But when you live
in The Bottoms,</i>

41
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,600
<i>a bad day might be
accidentally getting killed.</i>

42
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:59,103
<i>Like Wytony Johnson, who got
shot buying a pastrami cheeseburger...</i>

43
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,171
<i>from Jimmy's Burger
on Centinela.</i>

44
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,273
Hey! It's the Rollin' 60s,
dumb-ass niggas!

45
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:06,942
<i>The real tragedy is...</i>

46
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:09,244
<i>that he was seconds away
from defeating Ganon.</i>

47
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:12,380
<i>He had a hell
of a comic book collection.</i>

48
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:16,817
<i>Jib has been trying to talk
Wytony's mom into giving them to him...</i>

49
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:19,085
<i>for the past two weeks.</i>

50
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:24,456
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy don't play
sports and they aren't in a gang.</i>

51
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,592
<i>They're always getting ridiculed by their
peers because they're into white shit...</i>

52
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:30,795
<i>like skateboards, manga comics,
Donald Glover...</i>

53
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:34,465
<i>and for listening to white shit like
Trash Talk, TV on the Radio...</i>

54
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:38,101
<i>and for doing white shit like getting
good grades and applying to college.</i>

55
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:41,204
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy
used to be in the school marching band,</i>

56
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:44,674
<i>but quit in protest after refusing
to play the Harlem Shake.</i>

57
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:46,642
<i>They arranged to use
the music room during lunch...</i>

58
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:48,977
<i>for their recently formed
punk band, Awreeoh.</i>

59
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:51,579
One, two.
One, two, three, four!

60
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:06,071
Hey-hey!
You know the program, niggas.

61
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:08,106
Shoe program.
Turn around.

62
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:10,908
Let me see what the fuck
you working with.

63
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,545
Oh, shit, man. All these motherfuckers
got small feet around this bitch.

64
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:18,347
Goddamn. Nigga, I don't know
why you was looking.

65
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:21,183
Hey-hey!
My nigga, my G.

66
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:23,585
Oh, man.
Where the fuck you goin', man?

67
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:26,554
Goddamn.
What's up with you?

68
00:06:26,556 --> 00:06:29,456
Hey, them last shoes you gave me,
man, I was feeling them.

69
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,525
Classics. The Force 2s?
Yeah, I was liking those.

70
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:34,260
What's these you got on?

71
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:36,362
Bro, these are straight
from the flea market.

72
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:39,264
Shut the fuck up, nigga.
These the J-3s with the red mark on 'em.

73
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,632
Oh, yes.

74
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,001
Come up out those right now.

75
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,270
Right now, nigga!
You speak English?

76
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,005
Do I gotta beat the shit out of
you again and take them?

77
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:52,141
Damn.

78
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:55,110
This nigga's speaking African or some shit,
like he don't speak what we speak.

79
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:56,244
This nigga always...

80
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:58,179
Hey!

81
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,614
Go, Dig! Come on!

82
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:03,449
Dig! Go!

83
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:05,451
Come on, Dig!

84
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:07,186
Oh, shit!

85
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:16,060
Hey, hey. Hold up, hold up.
Get your fuckin' hands off me, man!

86
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,829
Don't think I won't
beat your ass, Marquis!

87
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:22,632
I came up with your daddy.
You better ask him about Stacey.

88
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:24,834
And see what's what
around this motherfucker!

89
00:07:27,903 --> 00:07:29,870
Let's go, man.

90
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:34,073
I'm gon' get the other one,
you little, bitch-ass nigga.

91
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:35,707
Go, man.

92
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:51,120
Malcolm, when I see stuff
like this personal essay,

93
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:53,655
I think you're not taking
the process seriously.

94
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:56,691
I'm... I'm taking it seriously, Mr. Bailey.
I promise.

95
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:59,160
I'm talking about
something that I love.

96
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:02,029
I mean, it's well-reasoned,
supported with historical data,

97
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:04,498
it shows creativity,
critical thinking.

98
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,101
If Neil deGrasse Tyson was writing about
Ice Cube, this is what it would look like.

99
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,369
I suggest you go
in a different direction.

100
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:14,605
Write something personal
about<i> you.</i>

101
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:16,406
Your family, your life.

102
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:23,978
I mean, I... I could write
about the typical...

103
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,881
"I'm from a poor,
crime-filled neighborhood,

104
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,683
raised by a single mother,
don't know my dad" blah-blah.

105
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:32,117
It's cliché.

106
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:35,286
This here, this...
This is...

107
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:37,821
This is creative.
This shows that I'm different.

108
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:40,456
This is the kind of essay
that Harvard wants from their students.

109
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,891
Malcolm, I'm gonna be
honest with you.

110
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,759
You're pretty damn arrogant.
You think you're gonna get into Harvard?

111
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,962
Who do you think
you are? Hmm?

112
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:52,197
You go to high school
in Inglewood.

113
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,834
To the admissions committee,
your straight A's, they don't mean shit.

114
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:59,070
If you're really serious about this exercise
and you're not just wasting my time,

115
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,805
or yours,

116
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,008
then it's gonna be about
your personal statement,

117
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,478
your SAT scores,
your recommendations...

118
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,913
and most importantly
your alumni interview tomorrow.

119
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,582
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

120
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,951
You'd better be.

121
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:17,753
I just found out you're interviewing
with Austin Jacoby.

122
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:23,291
He's from Inglewood too, so he'll be
able to relate to your circumstances.

123
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:25,326
Jacoby Check Cashing?

124
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:27,494
Harvard? Really?

125
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:32,832
I'm sorry. They don't all
go on to be president.

126
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:41,306
<i>On this day,</i>

127
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,941
<i>their usual route home
is blocked by a Blood gathering.</i>

128
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:46,023
<i>They were shooting a video
for their YouTube channel.</i>

129
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:55,483
Well, where do you want to go?

130
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:59,186
Some nigga really needs to invent an app
like Waze to avoid all these hood traps.

131
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:03,522
<i>The only way to get home
is down 104th Street.</i>

132
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:05,690
<i>But that's where
the dope dealers are...</i>

133
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:08,726
<i>who, for sport, routinely
try to steal their bikes.</i>

134
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:15,131
- Go!
- Hey, little nigga.

135
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:18,534
- <i>Such is the life of a geek in The Bottoms.</i>
- Come here.

136
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,503
<i>A daily navigation between
bad and worse choices.</i>

137
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:23,204
Come here, little nigga.

138
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:33,546
Yo, man.

139
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:37,883
I be seein' you and your little friends
with y'all flattops and MC Hammer pants,

140
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:41,605
riding around in this shit, looking like
y'all came out of a DeLorean or some shit.

141
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,958
You know, the '90s was like
the golden age of hip-hop.

142
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:52,228
Everything from
<i>It Takes a Nation of Millions...</i>

143
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,863
to<i> The Blueprint</i> was killing it.

144
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:57,765
I guess me and my friends
just wish we grew up back then.

145
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,501
<i>It Takes a Nation</i>
came out in '88.

146
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:02,369
<i>Blueprint</i> came out 2001.

147
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,811
What the fuck are you
talkin' 'bout right now?

148
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:07,506
Technically, um...

149
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:12,544
But, you know, the spirit of the music
was definitely still '90s.

150
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,446
I mean,<i> It Takes a Nation,</i>
<i>Straight Outta Compton...</i>

151
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:17,114
<i>Paid in Full</i>
was ahead of their time.

152
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:19,683
And then you got
Snoop, Biggie, Wu-Tang.

153
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,885
They took the game
to the next level.

154
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:24,587
<i>Blueprint</i> was kind of like
the punctuation mark.

155
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,222
Let's not forget,
the '90s also gave us...

156
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:29,524
Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer...

157
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:32,226
and we can't forget
about the Fresh Prince.

158
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:36,395
Everything in the '90s
wasn't great, but... Oh, shit.

159
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:38,497
But you gotta admit
"Summertime" was a classic.

160
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,299
What's your name, little nigga?

161
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,534
Uh, it's Malcolm.

162
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,603
Look here, Malcolm.
I want you to do a favor for me.

163
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:50,974
You see that green apartment there
in the middle of the block?

164
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,279
There's a nice little piece
over there.

165
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:59,481
I want you to go up to her
and tell her that Dom wants to talk to her.

166
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,749
Uh, th-that's... that's it?

167
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:04,550
Yeah, nigga.
Can you handle that?

168
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:07,452
Uh... y-yeah.

169
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:09,020
Get to pedalin', nigga.

170
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,024
Drop that up here.

171
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:19,261
Yeah.

172
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,714
You gonna say something
or just stare at me?

173
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:45,117
Um, Dom says...

174
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:48,353
that he would like you
to come over and talk to him.

175
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:53,457
Well, why don't you tell Dom
that if he wants to talk to me,

176
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,859
he can come over here
and be a fucking man...

177
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:57,694
and not send a little kid
to talk for him?

178
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:00,563
Tell him just like that.

179
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:03,365
She said that shit?

180
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:07,936
And that Dominique
was way cooler before he became Dom.

181
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:13,774
And, um, that if you think that she cares
about your dope money, sh-she doesn't.

182
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:18,010
Listen, tell her that I'm throwing a
birthday party at Verse tonight...

183
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:20,745
and I would really enjoy
the pleasure of her company.

184
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:23,713
Go ahead, nigga.

185
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:30,953
You should, uh...
You should work inside out.

186
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:34,556
Do the stuff in the brackets first
and then square the sum.

187
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:44,731
Yep.

188
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,434
Okay. Thanks.

189
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:53,205
Oh! Uh...

190
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,475
Dom says he's throwing
a birthday party tonight at Verse.

191
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:59,210
Mm-hmm.

192
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:03,080
He said he'd really love
the, uh... the pleasure of your company.

193
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:06,049
That nigga did not say that.

194
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:08,584
He did. I s...

195
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,152
I swear. He...

196
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:12,087
Lord.

197
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:17,724
Well, I'll go if you go.

198
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,659
I'll save you a dance.

199
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,363
<i>You are going.</i>

200
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,498
<i>We</i> are going.

201
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,567
She metaphorically showed you her pussy
and said, "Come and fuck me."

202
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,103
Jib, um, this is Dom
we're talking about.

203
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:37,106
We're not going to
a drug dealer's birthday party.

204
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,341
That's... You're trippin'.

205
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,823
We're in our senior year, bitches.
Okay?

206
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:46,046
- It is time we started expanding our horizons.
- No.

207
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:49,382
Call your mom and tell her you're...
you're studying late at my place.

208
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:51,250
Come on. Dig? Huh?

209
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:53,818
Look, it's better than what
you normally do at night, so...

210
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:03,126
Mm-hmm.

211
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:08,764
Looking beautiful. Oh!

212
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,966
One, two and<i> tres.</i>

213
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:13,368
Been working on my Spa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

214
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,204
- What you doing?
- You let them in without checking the list.

215
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,905
What's up?

216
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:20,474
Okay, let me educate you
real quick.

217
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:23,810
I am the gatekeeper,
I'm the grandmaster, the authority...

218
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:27,480
in keeping
a proper nigga-to-ho ratio.

219
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:29,748
You understand what I'm saying?

220
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,751
So unless you little niggas got some pussies,
I'm gon' need y'all to get the fuck...

221
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:35,286
- I have one.

222
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:38,155
I know y'all some bitches,
but you ain't gotta say you got pussies.

223
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,257
She... She's a girl.

224
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:42,225
What?

225
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:45,661
This little nigga's a bitch!

226
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,563
Like... Like<i> Boys Don't Cry</i>
like a motherfucker.

227
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:51,132
Remember when we was seein' that shit?
Yeah, I remember that.

228
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:53,167
Nigga, what the fuck.
Let us in.

229
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:56,236
Oh, well, yeah, yeah.
You know, it's 21 and older.

230
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:58,637
I'm gon' need some ID,
some verification.

231
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,606
- Uh...
- Oh.

232
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,908
Wait.
Y'all don't have no IDs?

233
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:10,013
Aw! Sorry! I'm gon' need y'all
to get the fuck off.

234
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:11,948
Come on.
Get the fuck off.

235
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,751
There's a Baskin-Robbins down the street.
Enjoy yourselves.

236
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:19,254
Hey, man, don't this dude look like the
dude that danced in Santa Monica?

237
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:21,936
- Breakdance?
- Don't he look like... What the fuck.

238
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,757
You're coming in, right?

239
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:32,363
Get the fuck outta here, man!

240
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,031
Get the fuck outta here, man.

241
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:37,267
Old Coolio-looking motherfucker.
Hey, baby. You're looking good.

242
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,968
Thank you.

243
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,604
Digs. Digs. Digs. Jib. Jib.
Come on, come on.

244
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:49,942
Hey. Hey, w-wait... Hey!

245
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:54,947
Yo, yo, yo. It's cool.
It's cool. Let 'em in.

246
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,716
Look, I ca...
I can't let you do that.

247
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:00,952
These kids are underage
and I cannot lose my license tonight.

248
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,454
Not tonight.

249
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:05,390
I don't mind having
this discussion with you.

250
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,059
I actually enjoy the thoughtful
exchange of ideas.

251
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,594
And you do bring up a valid point.
Know what I'm sayin'?

252
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,630
But see, you put me
in a bit of a spot, nigga.

253
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,799
'Cause I can't have you back-talkin' me
in front of my niggas...

254
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,634
without at least
fuckin' your ass up.

255
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:20,335
You feel me?
You don't have to do that.

256
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:23,404
I kinda do though. I don't want to.
It's my birthday and shit.

257
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:26,340
But there's principles to this shit,
and I'm a principled man.

258
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:29,743
- They in, Dom. It's all good.
- I know they got in. That's my point.

259
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:34,180
But I got this nigga telling me what he can't
let me do and shit. Like I give a fuck.

260
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:36,815
Man, if I let this shit slide,
we got what they call a slippery slope.

261
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,817
You know what
a slippery slope is, nigga?

262
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:41,319
No. I don't...
I don't know what a slippery...

263
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,187
Anyone?

264
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:45,355
Do it got anything
to do with skiing?

265
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,657
Nigga, sit your ass down, man.

266
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,925
I know using your brain
is a challenge and shit.

267
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:52,661
You use skis on a slope... You might
fuck around, give yourself a concussion.

268
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:55,096
It's a small event that leads to
a chain reaction of events...

269
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:56,864
with unintended consequences...

270
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:59,566
that were unforeseen at the time
of the inciting event.

271
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:06,972
See, this is a smart little nigga
right in here, bro.

272
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:10,054
You probably got one of them
"photogetic" brains or some shit, huh?

273
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:12,976
You mean photographic memory?

274
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:16,112
- Nigga, what I just say?
- I mean, yeah, y-you said it.

275
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:18,114
I'm reiterating that...

276
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:21,183
I'm still a little shaky
on the concept.

277
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:24,152
Basically, if I let
this nigga slide, man,

278
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:26,354
then I'm going to have
the next nigga coming along,

279
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,622
thinking they can pop off and shit,
you know what I'm sayin'?

280
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:30,056
And so on and so forth.

281
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:33,458
Damn!

282
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,295
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, little nigga, you coming in?

283
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:40,431
Yo, it's cool.
You coming in, Malcolm?

284
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:46,803
Nigga, come on.

285
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:54,676
Yeah.

286
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:57,912
Nigga, school's out.
What the fuck you doing with a bag on?

287
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:00,014
Hey, throw this behind the bar
for my little homey.

288
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:02,883
Yo, let me get a round of shots.
Cheers.

289
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:31,452
Hi.

290
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:38,524
So, are you gonna ask me
to dance or what?

291
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:05,010
I think you said
something about me...

292
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:07,445
being man enough
to come talk to you.

293
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:10,448
Can I have this dance, Nakia?
It's my birthday, you know.

294
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,982
Hey, uh...

295
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:15,451
We were dancing, man.

296
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:20,288
Kids say the darndest things,
don't they?

297
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,858
See, this is what happens
when you don't spank your children.

298
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:35,733
Anyways... Why do you
have to talk to him like that?

299
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:46,208
- You look nice tonight.
- Dom.

300
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:09,227
Boom!
Damn, nigga, that was ill.

301
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:12,296
This nigga doesn't know what hit him.
Check this nigga out.

302
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,731
He's walking his jihad dog and shit,
scratching his nuts.

303
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:18,667
Yahtzee, nigga.
Ooh, this shit crazy.

304
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:23,070
Yo, man, straight up, I really used
to think Obama was a bitch, man.

305
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:24,971
Drones though, nigga?

306
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:27,573
That's some gangsta shit.
I need one of those motherfuckers.

307
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:30,342
This shit ain't funny.

308
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:32,510
It's fucked up
if you really think about it.

309
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:35,546
How, nigga?
He killing all them Al-Qaedas and shit.

310
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:37,848
Nigga, that ain't all
that gets killed.

311
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,183
And that nigga's saying
he can drone-strike Americans too.

312
00:22:40,185 --> 00:22:42,752
They killed an American
working with them niggas in Yemen.

313
00:22:42,754 --> 00:22:46,021
Man, he was a terrorist, dawg.
So it's like set trippin'.

314
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,822
You can't decide
to be a Blood...

315
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,990
and then get mad
if the Crips try to kill you and shit.

316
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:51,858
Man, all I'm saying is...

317
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,927
this shit started somewhere
like Pakistan or some shit.

318
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:57,596
And before you know it, they'll start
saying that<i> we're</i> the terrorists.

319
00:22:57,598 --> 00:22:59,831
They're gonna have planes
riding all around Inglewood,

320
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,600
droppin' bombs on Crenshaw
and shit, man.

321
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:05,102
Ah, slippery slope.
Exact, nigga.

322
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:08,738
Shit, I wish a nigga
would try to fly drones in my hood.

323
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,840
- Fuck that.
- Hell yeah.

324
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:14,343
<i>I wish I would see one of
them motherfuckers in Inglewood, man.</i>

325
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:17,346
<i>For real. Don't let them
niggas come to my hood.</i>

326
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:19,081
What you got there?

327
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,882
- Ah!
- Whoo!

328
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:23,584
Breakfast Club, nigga.
Molly Ringwald.

329
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:26,019
So, this the latest and greatest shit, huh?
Yes, sir.

330
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:28,554
Pure as a nun's pussy.
Know what I'm sayin'?

331
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:30,956
This ain't like that ghetto shit
y'all niggas been fucking with either, man.

332
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,058
This is that A-1 shit.

333
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,740
A.J. say you ready to move out
the D-league and move up to the NBA.

334
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:03,348
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus!

335
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,118
Get the fuck out of here!
Let's move. Go!

336
00:24:11,822 --> 00:24:14,756
Nakia! Nakia.

337
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:24,030
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

338
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,534
Malcolm!

339
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,039
Shit.
Come on. I drove.

340
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,921
Thanks for helping me.

341
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:54,024
Most of those niggas
just saw me and stepped over me.

342
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,159
Luckily for you,
I'm not one of those niggas.

343
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,961
Oh, really?

344
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:02,730
- What are you, then?
- I don't know.

345
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:05,499
I'm just...
I'm black as fuck, right?

346
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:12,137
Uh, I guess I'm just used to
hearing that, uh,

347
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:17,108
niggas don't listen to this,
niggas don't do that,

348
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:22,045
niggas don't go to college
unless they play ball or whatever.

349
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:26,348
It's just time to accept it.
I'm just not one of those niggas.

350
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,951
Well, me neither then.

351
00:25:29,953 --> 00:25:32,586
'Cause I'm going to college.

352
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:34,921
Just gotta get my GED first.

353
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:39,291
That's what you were studying for.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

354
00:25:39,293 --> 00:25:43,394
If I pass, I'll go to El Camino
or Santa Monica or something.

355
00:25:43,396 --> 00:25:45,696
Transfer to Dominguez
or Northridge.

356
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:50,366
Well, you shouldn't
sell yourself short.

357
00:25:52,168 --> 00:25:54,302
You could do better.

358
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:57,204
You hardly know me.
So how can you say that?

359
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,672
I can just tell.

360
00:26:01,574 --> 00:26:04,041
You shouldn't settle
for what's expected.

361
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:07,209
Like Dom, right?

362
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,812
I...

363
00:26:10,814 --> 00:26:12,747
I didn't say that.

364
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:14,849
Don't try and be slick.

365
00:26:14,851 --> 00:26:17,351
You're trying to block him.

366
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,187
So, you two...

367
00:26:21,189 --> 00:26:23,455
Y-You guys...
It's complicated.

368
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,590
But trust me,
he's got nothing on you.

369
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:29,393
You probably got all the girls
lined up asking you to prom and shit.

370
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:37,933
You making fun of me?
N-No.

371
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:40,568
I'm sorry.

372
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:44,604
Hey, I didn't go
to my prom.

373
00:26:44,606 --> 00:26:47,440
You didn't go to your prom?
Seriously.

374
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:52,077
I had one guy ask me... Anthony Davis...
and he fucking stood me up.

375
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,814
I didn't even care
about missing prom.

376
00:26:56,816 --> 00:27:00,450
I was more mad about not going
to Six Flags the next day.

377
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,419
All my friends had dates.
I didn't want to go alone.

378
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,591
Would you want to
go to prom with me?

379
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:18,164
I mean, I...

380
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:22,400
I know that
I'm not complicated or... But...

381
00:27:22,402 --> 00:27:24,769
It's just with studying and all,

382
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,938
I don't think
I'll have time.

383
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,708
But thank you.

384
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,579
What if I helped you study?
And what if you passed the GED?

385
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:41,616
Would you go with me then?

386
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,452
I'll think about it.

387
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:49,987
Okay.

388
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:56,025
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

389
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:58,093
Oh, shit.

390
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:01,162
Three words.
Did you fuck?

391
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:05,098
You're a pussy, nigga.
Come on, man.

392
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,333
She let me feel her titties
and finger-bang her.

393
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:09,368
Bullshit.
No, I'm dead-ass serious.

394
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,003
Smell my fingers.
I don't smell shit.

395
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:13,838
Just cream.
You never smelled pussy before.

396
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,506
Wait. I have.

397
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:17,207
I don't smell shit.

398
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:19,275
See, she don't smell shit either.
'Cause you only know your pussy.

399
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:21,443
Exactly!

400
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:23,945
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold it.
- Whoa, whoa.

401
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:26,781
Wait a minute.
You two go back through, one at a time.

402
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:28,249
One at a time.

403
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:30,618
What's getting into you?
Come on.

404
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:37,323
Hey, hey. Calm down.

405
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:42,627
Go. Everybody else wait.
Turn around, go back.

406
00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:45,496
We gotta do pat-downs.
The machine is broke.

407
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:56,673
Oh, shit.

408
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,084
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

409
00:29:10,086 --> 00:29:12,052
Yo, yo, yo.
Oh, shit!

410
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:14,287
What's wrong? What?

411
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:16,789
Oh, shit.

412
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,958
Fuck! Is that real?

413
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,461
Boy, how'd you get this shit?
I have no fucking clue, Jib. No fucking clue.

414
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:24,962
What do you mean
you don't have a fucking clue?

415
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:28,832
I have no fucking clue
where that gun came from.

416
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,366
Or the drugs.

417
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:34,502
Drop your weapons!

418
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:42,707
Get the fuck outta here.
Let's move. Go!

419
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:46,477
Last night at...
At the fucking party.

420
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:49,513
At the party. Dom put that shit
in my bag. Had to be.

421
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:52,649
Well, we gotta get rid of it then.
You know? Dump it, or...

422
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:55,318
Or take it to the police.
Yeah. Let's take it to the police.

423
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,987
Are you joking?

424
00:29:57,989 --> 00:30:01,290
You want three niggas
to take a bag full of dope and a gun...

425
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,191
to the fucking police station?

426
00:30:03,193 --> 00:30:05,860
Like, "Here you go"?
N...

427
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:09,864
And... And you don't expect Dom
to find out who snitched?

428
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:12,499
- Well, what do you wanna do with it?
- Yo, that's a lot of weight.

429
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:15,335
It's like 20, 30 keys.
I don't know.

430
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:17,770
- It's a lot of shit, right?
- I don't know, Dig.

431
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,872
I don't know anything
about this shit.

432
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:23,175
All I know is Jeezy paid LeBron
and Jay paid Dwyane Wade.

433
00:30:23,177 --> 00:30:25,677
What?
He was talking about dope?

434
00:30:29,948 --> 00:30:32,215
Shit.

435
00:30:32,217 --> 00:30:34,217
I-I-I-I answered it.

436
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:36,452
You did what?
I don't want that shit.

437
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:38,587
Shit.

438
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,091
- Hello?
- <i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

439
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:49,561
U-Um, who is this?

440
00:30:49,563 --> 00:30:52,864
<i>This the nigga that's gon' fuck you up,
you keep asking questions.</i>

441
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:55,399
<i>Now, who the fuck is this?</i>

442
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:59,502
I prefer not to say.

443
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:01,971
<i>Okay, I see how
we gon' do this then.</i>

444
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:05,640
<i>If this ain't a nigga named
Malcolm at Yukon and 104th Street,</i>

445
00:31:05,642 --> 00:31:07,742
<i>then I'm gon' kill your ass.</i>

446
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:11,045
How do you know where I am?
<i>Find an iPhone.</i>

447
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:13,714
<i>Steve Jobs a motherfucking genius.</i>
Oh, shit.

448
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:16,083
<i>Now, if this a nigga named Malcolm,
say, "Damn right."</i>

449
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:19,319
<i>Otherwise,
click-click-boom.</i>

450
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:22,555
Damn right.
Damn right, my name is Malcolm.

451
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:24,223
<i>Malcolm. Malcolm!</i>

452
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:26,558
<i>How you feeling, man?</i>

453
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,427
<i>Dom told me there was a mix-up.
You accidentally took my lunch. That true?</i>

454
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,430
- Took your lunch?
- <i>Yeah, my lunch.</i>

455
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,932
<i>A nigga hungry.</i>
Yes. Yes, I...

456
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:38,068
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Baloney sandwich. Mm-hmm.

457
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,503
<i>Baloney.
It got cheese on it?</i>

458
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:42,571
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

459
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:44,739
<i>We talking about
the same sandwich, nigga?</i>

460
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:46,841
<i>'Cause I ain't ask
for no cheese.</i>

461
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:50,677
<i>I find that my fucking sandwich
got cheese on it, I'm gon' kill your ass.</i>

462
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:53,946
I don't know.

463
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:56,381
You just... You know,
there's a bag and...

464
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:58,416
<i>What? What?</i>

465
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:01,619
<i>You're the one wanted to get all cute,
talkin' 'bout baloney sandwiches and shit.</i>

466
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:04,221
- <i>I just asked you if you had my lunch.</i>
- Yeah.

467
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,524
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

468
00:32:06,526 --> 00:32:09,159
Uh, your lunch. It's right here.
I'm looking at it right now.

469
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,127
<i>Coolio.</i>

470
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,896
<i>Now, after school, you're gon'
see a red El Camino parked...</i>

471
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,998
<i>and this
handsome-ass nigga inside.</i>

472
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,900
<i>That ain't Lance Gross, nigga.
That's yours truly.</i>

473
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:22,570
<i>Just walk up, hand me the
baloney sandwich and be on your way.</i>

474
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:26,640
<i>You have a nice, happy,
productive life with a hell of a story to tell.</i>

475
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:29,475
<i>You got it?</i>
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

476
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:33,045
Red El Camino after school.
Cool.

477
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,414
<i>It's almost over,
little nigga.</i>

478
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,115
<i>You did good.</i>

479
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:43,120
What the fuck did we
get ourselves into, man?

480
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:47,256
I don't see it.

481
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:52,925
Where is it?

482
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:58,063
Yo, he's over there.

483
00:32:58,065 --> 00:33:00,198
- Where?
- To the right.

484
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,500
Oh, I see him.

485
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:04,568
You good?
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.

486
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,170
You good?
All right. Yeah.

487
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:13,743
He asked for you alone,
you know?

488
00:33:13,745 --> 00:33:17,412
I got your back and all. It's just I don't
wanna mess with his explicit instructions.

489
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:20,214
You'll be fine, bro.

490
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:22,049
Right?

491
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:23,850
You're just dropping it off.
You're good.

492
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:40,864
Uh, hey. Yeah.

493
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:42,799
I'm, uh...
I got your lunch.

494
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:45,968
I'm walking to the red
El Camino right now.

495
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,436
<i>What you say?</i>

496
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:52,207
Who's this?
<i>This is Dom, man.</i>

497
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:55,476
<i>Look, do you have
what I left in the backpack?</i>

498
00:33:55,478 --> 00:33:58,812
Yeah. Yeah.
You in the red El Camino?

499
00:33:58,814 --> 00:34:00,580
<i>What the fuck
you talking about?</i>

500
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:03,449
Somebody called me earlier saying
I need to bring him the sandwich.

501
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:07,285
<i>Nigga, why the fuck are you
talking about sandwiches right now?</i>

502
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:10,288
The... The backpack.

503
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:14,325
He... The guy, he said that I needed
to bring it to him after school.

504
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:16,327
He'd be in a red El Camino.

505
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:22,065
Yo, McFly, I want you to listen to
what I'm about to tell you right now.

506
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:23,800
Somebody snitched.

507
00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:26,235
<i>I'm in County right now.
I don't know who the fuck called you.</i>

508
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:28,070
There's two possibilities.

509
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:30,505
Either the motherfucker
in the El Camino is POPO...

510
00:34:30,507 --> 00:34:32,673
As soon as you give him
the package, he gon' arrest you.

511
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:34,908
<i>Or that motherfucker's
the snitch.</i>

512
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,577
<i>In that case,
he'll take the package, kill you,</i>

513
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,845
<i>then I'm headed to Chino
with a price on my head.</i>

514
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:42,781
I'm gon' need you to trust me
right about now, you understand?

515
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:47,017
<i>Do not take that backpack to the nigga in
the whip, else we both fucked. Hear me?</i>

516
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:49,152
I'm gonna text you this address.

517
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:52,688
Go there, ask for A.J.
Tell him it's about the Boys Club.

518
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,424
<i>Give him the package.</i>
<i>Tell him it's from me.</i>
<i>You hear me?</i>

519
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,959
<i>Nigga, run. Get the fuck
out of there, nigga.</i>

520
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:00,494
<i>Run. Go now!</i>
<i>Get the fuck out of there!</i> Oh, shit.

521
00:35:00,496 --> 00:35:03,129
<i>Go!</i>
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

522
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:05,698
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

523
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:10,369
Go! Let's go! Come on!

524
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:16,372
Go, Jib!

525
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:25,846
- Get the fuck back over here!
- Oh, shit!

526
00:35:25,848 --> 00:35:29,049
Let's go! Let's go!
Move the fucking car!

527
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:30,617
Let's go!

528
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:32,218
Come on!

529
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:42,627
Yo, man, what the hell happened?
Who the fuck was that?

530
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:44,061
Dom.
What?

531
00:35:44,063 --> 00:35:46,163
Dom!

532
00:35:46,165 --> 00:35:49,533
That nigga called me and said that the
nigga that called earlier isn't with him.

533
00:35:49,535 --> 00:35:51,201
Well, then who is he?

534
00:35:52,303 --> 00:35:55,171
Oh, shit.

535
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:56,872
Oh, shit.

536
00:35:56,874 --> 00:35:59,273
How the fuck did they find us?
Yo, let's go.

537
00:36:08,415 --> 00:36:10,616
Jib! Dig! Bus!

538
00:36:20,826 --> 00:36:23,327
There. Right here.
Right ahead.

539
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:24,961
It's that bus.
It's that bus.

540
00:36:26,997 --> 00:36:29,131
Right there. Right there.
They on that bus!

541
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

542
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:39,105
Open the fucking door!

543
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:40,973
Open the fucking door, bitch!

544
00:36:45,112 --> 00:36:47,378
You see three little niggas
get on this bus a couple stops ago?

545
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,180
I don't know.
Lot of young niggas get on this bus.

546
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:52,949
Don't get smart. I'm just asking
you a motherfucking question, all right?

547
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:54,650
I don't see shit
but the road.

548
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:02,489
He's here.

549
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:06,725
Is it you? Huh?

550
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:09,928
Is it you? Huh?
Is it fuckin' you?

551
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,469
<i>Congratulations.
You have found your iPhone.</i>

552
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,204
Damn.

553
00:38:10,978 --> 00:38:14,478
Yo, Lily, what are you doing
opening the door butt-ass naked for?

554
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:19,982
Excuse my dumb-ass sister, man.
What up?

555
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:21,283
Are you A.J.?

556
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:23,852
No, that's my dad.

557
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:25,353
I need to speak to him.

558
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,522
It's about Boys Club.

559
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:31,024
Right. Right.

560
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:33,593
Well, my dad's at his office
for a couple of hours.

561
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:36,128
But y'all can hang out here
until he gets back if you want.

562
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,462
Um...
No.

563
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:39,230
You know...

564
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:44,967
Hey.
Yeah.

565
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:47,769
- You wanna come in?
- Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:49,704
Y'all come in.

567
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,214
You Piru?
Crenshaw Mafia?

568
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:05,416
Uh, I'm just Malcolm.

569
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:09,386
That's your hood, though.
Right? Right?

570
00:39:15,124 --> 00:39:16,690
Yeah.

571
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:20,826
Yeah.
Yeah.

572
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,796
Yeah.

573
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:27,831
In the guest house
is where I got my studio.

574
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,167
That's where I lay down
my tracks.

575
00:39:54,953 --> 00:39:57,486
I fuck around with it, you know.
I do my little thing.

576
00:39:57,488 --> 00:40:01,156
My style is, I'm like a Dilla meets a No ID
with a little bit of splash of Rick Rubin.

577
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:03,191
- Right.
- Know what I mean?

578
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:06,093
I actually got something that
I did the other day. Check this out.

579
00:40:21,608 --> 00:40:23,608
Yeah, what the fuck is "bereal"?

580
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:26,344
Oh, shit. Look.
I meant "cereal."

581
00:40:26,346 --> 00:40:28,679
But that's how much
I hate crab-ass niggas.

582
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:32,649
'Cause my mind, it thinks these C-words,
but my mouth won't let me say them.

583
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:36,386
Okay, so, you replace words
that start with C's with B's?

584
00:40:36,388 --> 00:40:39,822
- Like Crip dyslexia.
- Criplexia.

585
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:42,825
But only soft C's, because
you said "crab" no problem.

586
00:40:42,827 --> 00:40:46,395
That's true. Why won't your mind tell
your mouth to say "brab" instead of "crab"?

587
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:49,898
- I don't know. It's a case-by-case thing.
- Not "base-by-base"?

588
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,534
See, you would think this hard "C"
would be the issue, but no.

589
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:55,168
That's interesting.

590
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,337
Fuck y'all. I'm just tryin'
to rep my set. That's it.

591
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:01,006
- Ladera doesn't have a set.
- What the fuck you mean?

592
00:41:01,008 --> 00:41:04,009
Huh?

593
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:06,244
- Does that make me any less of a nigga than y'all?
- No.

594
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:08,012
Because my dad was from The Bottoms.
Yeah.

595
00:41:08,014 --> 00:41:11,048
My uncle, everybody on my side
reppin' the Inglewood family.

596
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,016
'Cause that's where my heart is.
Yeah.

597
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,551
Even though my...
My body's right here.

598
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:17,819
- Mm-hmm.
- It's cool.

599
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:19,554
I-It's "bool."

600
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:25,492
Fuck all y'all. 'Cause I was
in a good mood and shit.

601
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,763
What was that?

602
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:35,566
A song that we... You just reminded us
of something we was writing.

603
00:41:35,568 --> 00:41:37,701
"Was"?
Let's... Let's get to it.

604
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,869
- What you mean?
- Let's record.

605
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:42,338
- Let's record what?
- The song.

606
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,074
Quit fucking around.
Come on.

607
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:03,155
Randy.

608
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,499
Check this out.

609
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,402
Little niggas.
Got 'em.

610
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:24,071
I know y'all hungry. If you want,
you can just help yourself to my fridge.

611
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:26,306
Or I could have Marta
cook us up something.

612
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:29,309
- Can she cook chili-cheese fries?
- Chili-cheese fries. Yeah.

613
00:42:29,311 --> 00:42:30,977
Marta! Yeah.

614
00:42:30,979 --> 00:42:32,812
- Right?
- Where you get 'em at?

615
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:35,447
Jimmy's Burgers on Centinela
and Inglewood Avenue.

616
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:39,417
Yes, um... <i>Cuatro órdenes</i>
<i>de</i> chili-cheese fries...

617
00:42:39,419 --> 00:42:41,786
at Jimmy's Burgers
on Centinela and Inglewood.

618
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:55,329
Niggas, let's roll.
You coming, Malcolm?

619
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:01,000
No, I think
I'm gonna stay here.

620
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,284
So...

621
00:43:22,286 --> 00:43:25,920
you're a boy from the hood.

622
00:43:25,922 --> 00:43:29,523
Good thing you found the Boys Club and
have such an amazing mentor as my father.

623
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:38,963
I'm bored as fuck.

624
00:43:38,965 --> 00:43:41,885
Will you play with me,
my little boy from the hood?

625
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:44,667
Yeah.

626
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:46,502
Yeah, we...

627
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:50,805
I can... Well, what do
you want to play?

628
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:54,208
How about we play
Mother May I?

629
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,743
You remember that game, right?

630
00:43:57,778 --> 00:43:59,845
Yeah.

631
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:01,847
S... Yeah.

632
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:04,583
Go ahead.
Ask me a question.

633
00:44:07,787 --> 00:44:11,656
Um... what's your name?

634
00:44:11,658 --> 00:44:13,858
Lily.

635
00:44:15,126 --> 00:44:18,361
No, you're supposed to
ask me something like,

636
00:44:18,363 --> 00:44:20,696
"Mother, may I
take two steps?"

637
00:44:20,698 --> 00:44:23,565
If I say yes,
you take two steps toward me.

638
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:27,001
Or I may say,
"No, you have to take three steps back."

639
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:29,536
Now it's my turn
to ask the questions.

640
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:31,037
Okay.

641
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,539
- Got it?
- Yeah.

642
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:39,324
May I take off my clothes?

643
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:44,247
Yeah.

644
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,583
Yeah.

645
00:44:54,356 --> 00:44:56,757
May I walk over to you?

646
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:01,428
Yeah.

647
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:10,802
May I touch you?

648
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,337
Yes.

649
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,077
Are you a virgin?

650
00:45:24,714 --> 00:45:26,314
No.

651
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,285
Don't.

652
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:33,787
Don't do that.

653
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:38,190
There are too many liars
and bullshitters in this house, Malcolm.

654
00:45:38,192 --> 00:45:40,692
I can tell
you're not like that.

655
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:42,293
Not like him.

656
00:45:42,295 --> 00:45:44,461
Don't start now, okay?

657
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:47,730
Okay.

658
00:45:47,732 --> 00:45:49,598
Yes, I'm a virgin.

659
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:53,167
I gotta pee.

660
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:56,435
Jaleel keeps rubbers over there.

661
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:02,140
I want you ready
when I get back.

662
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:15,953
Go.

663
00:46:17,755 --> 00:46:20,556
Can we get some
chili-cheese fries?

664
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:23,258
Burgers too.
All right, we'll get, uh...

665
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,393
Yo, can I get
a grilled cheese?

666
00:46:25,395 --> 00:46:27,327
What the fuck is this?

667
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:31,831
We got a problem, blood?

668
00:46:34,134 --> 00:46:37,202
Listen to this motherfuckin'
Abercrombie and Fitch-ass nigga.

669
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:41,639
You little niggas were supposed
to deliver my lunch today.

670
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:43,240
After school.

671
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:46,509
Now, I need my shit.

672
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:48,310
Right now, nigga.

673
00:46:48,312 --> 00:46:49,978
Right now.

674
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,281
What the fuck are you even
talking about, nigga? You hungry?

675
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:55,950
She's right there.
Order some shit.

676
00:46:55,952 --> 00:46:59,186
Order some shit?
See, first of all, you do not know me, bro.

677
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:03,189
Let me tell you what's going down.
All right?

678
00:47:03,191 --> 00:47:05,357
We're gon' order our food.

679
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,427
And then you can order your lunch
or whatever the fuck else.

680
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:12,749
A'ight?
Then we gon' keep it pushin'.

681
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:19,402
Where is my bag?

682
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:29,210
- Yo.
- What's in the backpack?

683
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:30,477
That's for my dad, right?

684
00:47:31,712 --> 00:47:32,945
Fuck.

685
00:47:34,314 --> 00:47:35,881
Lily.

686
00:47:37,216 --> 00:47:38,782
Lily.

687
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:43,184
Lily?

688
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,454
What the fuck?
What are you doing?

689
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:51,891
Look...
You don't know what you...

690
00:47:51,893 --> 00:47:54,159
This is your...
Oh, my God!

691
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:57,395
This can't even be happening.
Look... Look at you.

692
00:47:57,397 --> 00:48:00,131
Come on...
What is wrong with you?

693
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:04,134
Have you ever fucked on Molly?
I haven't fucked on anything. Remember?

694
00:48:05,236 --> 00:48:08,471
Okay.

695
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:10,872
Okay. All right.

696
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:18,345
What the fuck!

697
00:48:18,347 --> 00:48:21,681
You... You threw up on me!

698
00:48:21,683 --> 00:48:24,250
It's everywhere!
It's all in my mouth!

699
00:48:25,686 --> 00:48:28,653
Who the fuck is this?

700
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:32,123
Son of a...
Why are you yelling at me?

701
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,425
I don't know you,
Mr. Bailey,

702
00:48:34,427 --> 00:48:36,326
but you're being very rude.

703
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:37,927
What the fuck!
Bye.

704
00:48:37,929 --> 00:48:41,497
Yes, this is Malcolm.
Malcolm! Come here.

705
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:46,702
Yes, can I reschedule,
please?

706
00:48:46,704 --> 00:48:48,737
Mr. Bailey, come on...

707
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,875
Fuck!

708
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,447
Wait. Wait.

709
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:05,882
I have to go. I have to go.
Wait. We're not done yet.

710
00:49:05,884 --> 00:49:07,884
Where are you going?
Stop being so mean. I have to go.

711
00:49:07,886 --> 00:49:09,886
I spaced on
my college interviews!

712
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:11,988
I spaced on
my college interviews.

713
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,257
I only have 20 minutes to get down
there or my whole life is fucked.

714
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,093
I'll take you.

715
00:49:20,028 --> 00:49:21,495
What?

716
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:23,530
I'll take you.

717
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:35,339
- Whee!
- Lily! Lily, get up!

718
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:38,675
Oh, Lily! It's a stop sign!
Lily, stop. Stop!

719
00:49:38,677 --> 00:49:41,744
Stop!

720
00:49:54,888 --> 00:49:56,722
Oh, shit.

721
00:49:56,724 --> 00:49:59,024
Oh, shit.

722
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,597
Lily.

723
00:50:08,865 --> 00:50:10,699
Lily!

724
00:50:10,701 --> 00:50:12,821
Lily!
I gotta pee! I gotta pee!

725
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:16,703
Get out of my house!
Let me use the toilet!

726
00:50:16,705 --> 00:50:18,738
Lily! Get back!

727
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,774
- Lily!
- I gotta pee! I gotta pee! I gotta pee!

728
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:29,581
I gotta pee! I gotta pee!
I gotta pee! I gotta pee!

729
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,037
What the fuck?

730
00:51:08,814 --> 00:51:12,115
Tell you what's going down.
We gon' order our food.

731
00:51:12,117 --> 00:51:16,152
And then you can order your
lunch or whatever the fuck else.

732
00:51:16,154 --> 00:51:17,887
A'ight?
Then we gon' keep it pushin'.

733
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:19,622
Yeah?

734
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,460
Shut your fuckin'...

735
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:38,904
Diggy, fries, fries, fries!

736
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:47,043
I want my motherfucking dope!
I want my fucking dope!

737
00:51:49,246 --> 00:51:51,981
Shit, where the fuck is Jaleel?

738
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,343
Fuck!
That was our ride. What the f...

739
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:58,251
Run, run, run!

740
00:51:58,253 --> 00:52:01,853
Freeze! Down on your knees!
Keep your hands up!

741
00:52:05,858 --> 00:52:07,924
What the fuck?

742
00:52:19,468 --> 00:52:22,668
Mr. Jacoby's just wrapping up a staff meeting.
He'll be a few minutes.

743
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:52,931
Dom?

744
00:52:56,168 --> 00:52:58,602
Is that... Is that Dom?

745
00:53:08,011 --> 00:53:09,878
Oh, shit.

746
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,513
Austin Jacoby.

747
00:53:12,515 --> 00:53:14,882
Nice to meet you,
Malcolm.

748
00:53:14,884 --> 00:53:17,484
Take a seat.
Come on, relax.

749
00:53:20,588 --> 00:53:23,923
So, uh...
Malcolm Adekanbi.

750
00:53:23,925 --> 00:53:25,958
Did I pronounce that right?

751
00:53:27,226 --> 00:53:28,726
Yeah? Great.

752
00:53:29,694 --> 00:53:31,895
You're Nigerian.

753
00:53:31,897 --> 00:53:34,697
My dad, um...

754
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:38,400
He... He went back to Nigeria
before I was born.

755
00:53:38,402 --> 00:53:40,735
Sorry to hear that.

756
00:53:40,737 --> 00:53:43,404
I know what it's like
to grow up without a father.

757
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:46,940
That's why I spend a lot of time and
a lot of money with the Boys Club.

758
00:53:46,942 --> 00:53:50,108
Those, um...
Those kids...

759
00:53:51,276 --> 00:53:53,809
A-Are they your kids?
Yes, they are.

760
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:57,745
Not too much older than you.

761
00:53:57,747 --> 00:53:59,346
So you know Dominique?

762
00:53:59,348 --> 00:54:00,780
Excuse me?

763
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:04,250
You... You probably
know him as Dom.

764
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:07,886
No. Sorry.
Why do you ask?

765
00:54:07,888 --> 00:54:10,755
Dom gave me something...

766
00:54:10,757 --> 00:54:13,824
to deliver to someone.

767
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,927
As crazy as it seems,

768
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:21,196
I-I think
that someone is you.

769
00:54:21,198 --> 00:54:23,598
This Dom person...

770
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,801
What did he say that, uh,

771
00:54:26,803 --> 00:54:30,070
I should have to do
with this, uh, delivery?

772
00:54:30,072 --> 00:54:31,905
I don't know.

773
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:35,641
I just know that he told me
to deliver it to A.J., so...

774
00:54:35,643 --> 00:54:37,576
And why did you do it?

775
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:41,146
- I didn't have a choice.
- Oh, come on, Malcolm.

776
00:54:41,148 --> 00:54:43,414
Come on.
You always have a choice.

777
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:46,583
You could have done
a lot of things with that package.

778
00:54:46,585 --> 00:54:49,252
You're a smart kid.
I'm sure you thought about all of them.

779
00:54:49,254 --> 00:54:53,756
But you chose to make the delivery
for this Dom person...

780
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:57,559
because you thought it was,
what, in your best interest?

781
00:55:01,529 --> 00:55:04,664
So, you should
take responsibility...

782
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:07,266
for the choice
that you've made.

783
00:55:07,268 --> 00:55:10,335
Now, you know
I'm not the person or persons...

784
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:12,103
for whom this delivery
was intended.

785
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:13,838
Something happened
along the way.

786
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,707
It's like, uh, Amazon.

787
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:21,277
If you order a Rick Ross
or Macklemore CD...

788
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:24,680
I would not order
a Macklemore CD.

789
00:55:24,682 --> 00:55:26,415
That wouldn't happen.

790
00:55:26,417 --> 00:55:28,750
All right. Who, then?

791
00:55:28,752 --> 00:55:30,685
Casey Veggies.

792
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:33,487
Casey Veggies?
That's... That's an artist?

793
00:55:34,555 --> 00:55:36,756
Yeah.
Yeah, okay. All right.

794
00:55:36,758 --> 00:55:41,293
So, you order a Casey Veggies CD
from Amazon, right?

795
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:45,296
No, you don't order
a Casey Veggies CD.

796
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:47,564
You just go online
and you download it.

797
00:55:47,566 --> 00:55:49,599
Yeah, okay. All right.

798
00:55:49,601 --> 00:55:53,703
But you are aware
that Amazon does ship discs, right?

799
00:55:53,705 --> 00:55:57,106
And if you order that disc
and it does not come in a timely fashion,

800
00:55:57,108 --> 00:55:59,475
you're gonna call them
and say, "Where's my stuff?"

801
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:01,643
And Amazon has to
assume responsibility.

802
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:03,745
But it's just one CD.

803
00:56:03,747 --> 00:56:08,382
But what if it's 100 orders
and 100 CDs don't show up?

804
00:56:08,384 --> 00:56:10,650
Or a thousand?
Or 10,000?

805
00:56:11,385 --> 00:56:13,252
It's a slippery slope.

806
00:56:13,254 --> 00:56:15,053
Slippery slope.

807
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:18,322
So, Amazon has got to assume...

808
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:20,991
the full cost of the loss.

809
00:56:20,993 --> 00:56:23,059
But most importantly,

810
00:56:23,061 --> 00:56:26,395
they have to deal with the loss
of their reputation.

811
00:56:26,397 --> 00:56:29,331
A reputation that has taken
a long time to build.

812
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:31,199
You understand what I'm saying?

813
00:56:32,668 --> 00:56:34,335
So let's do this.

814
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:37,070
Let's reschedule
this interview...

815
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:41,140
for a few weeks from now.

816
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:42,674
Give it a little time.

817
00:56:42,676 --> 00:56:44,776
Go out there.

818
00:56:44,778 --> 00:56:47,645
Make the delivery for which you have
claimed responsibility...

819
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:50,014
to the appropriate consumers...

820
00:56:50,016 --> 00:56:53,483
so that the suppliers
of this product...

821
00:56:53,485 --> 00:56:55,184
can be whole.

822
00:56:55,186 --> 00:56:58,086
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

823
00:56:58,088 --> 00:57:00,088
If you're able to do this,

824
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,623
it shows me more about you...

825
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:05,359
than any interview ever could.

826
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:08,428
And I would then
make it my business...

827
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:11,931
to make you
a man of Harvard.

828
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:17,202
<i>I want you to get out of
The Bottoms just like I did.</i>

829
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:20,438
<i>I know from growing up there
it's very, very dangerous...</i>

830
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,141
<i>and that your family or your
friends could get killed at any moment...</i>

831
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:27,343
<i>just by being in the wrong
place at the wrong time.</i>

832
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,179
I'd hate for that
to happen to you...

833
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:35,182
<i>or any
of your family members.</i>

834
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:36,416
Getting on?

835
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,789
Looks like you and I
had the same kind of day.

836
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:45,257
How'd the interview go?

837
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:49,126
Okay.

838
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:51,628
Well, sit down.

839
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:54,096
My shift's almost over.
I'll take you home.

840
00:57:55,531 --> 00:57:57,899
Thanks, Mom.

841
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,702
<i>The incident took place today
at Seven Bucks Coffee...</i>

842
00:59:23,704 --> 00:59:29,073
<i>Apparently the side effects of the
popular club drug MDMA, or "Molly."</i>

843
00:59:29,075 --> 00:59:32,042
<i>Tannehill James was a witness
to this bizarre scene.</i>

844
00:59:32,044 --> 00:59:35,978
<i>So, I'm here at the Seven Bucks,
drinking my vanilla chai latte...</i>

845
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,247
<i>and eating me
some pound cake.</i>

846
00:59:39,249 --> 00:59:41,782
<i>'Cause you know niggas
don't eat scones, right?</i>

847
00:59:41,784 --> 00:59:46,086
<i>When all of a sudden
this crazy little naked ho comes up...</i>

848
00:59:46,088 --> 00:59:49,122
<i>and she squatted down right in front of me
and she pissed right there.</i>

849
00:59:49,124 --> 00:59:50,623
<i>I swear to God.</i>

850
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:53,225
<i>Pissed right there
for a long time.</i>

851
00:59:53,227 --> 00:59:57,561
<i>So, now, you tell me how am
I supposed to eat my pound cake...</i>

852
00:59:57,563 --> 00:59:59,262
<i>after witnessing
something like that?</i>

853
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:03,599
<i>Reporting live, Karen Myetta,
Channel 10 News.</i>

854
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:06,802
<i>Up next, a fight over lunch
turns deadly in Inglewood.</i>

855
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:09,671
Did he actually say, "I'll kill you and your
friends if you don't sell these drugs"?

856
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:11,806
Or just you? What?

857
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:15,643
Don't act like you weren't curious too.
Not directly.

858
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:19,480
He was talking about Amazon and Rick Ross
CDs not getting to their customers.

859
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,181
Niggas don't even buy
CDs anymore, dawg.

860
01:00:21,183 --> 01:00:23,316
Jib, that's not
the fucking point!

861
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:26,352
Are you gonna go and sell on the corner?
'Cause we're a bunch of bitches, man.

862
01:00:26,354 --> 01:00:28,487
Speak for yourself, Jib.
Yes.

863
01:00:28,489 --> 01:00:31,423
I am a bitch-ass nigga.
I don't give a fuck.
I own that shit.

864
01:00:31,425 --> 01:00:33,491
Who are you trying
to impress, Diggy?

865
01:00:33,493 --> 01:00:35,926
We're talking about Molly, Jib,
not fucking heroin.

866
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:38,962
All we gotta do
is find the white people.

867
01:00:38,964 --> 01:00:42,298
- Go to Coachella, Lollapalooza.
- Yeah, yeah.

868
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,001
We can backpack and hitchhike and sing Mumford
and Sons songs and all that faux fucking shit.

869
01:00:46,003 --> 01:00:48,770
Fuck you. Okay?
I'm just saying it could work.

870
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:51,305
Yeah, yeah.
Why stop there, you know?
Why not hit Bonnaroo also?

871
01:00:51,307 --> 01:00:52,572
Bitcoins.

872
01:00:53,774 --> 01:00:55,373
That's how we do it.
Do what?

873
01:00:57,709 --> 01:00:59,943
Oh, shit.

874
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:02,879
There's these sites where you can...
you can sell everything...

875
01:01:02,881 --> 01:01:05,982
from fake credit cards
to illegal guns and drugs.

876
01:01:05,984 --> 01:01:08,651
And they use Bitcoins
so they can't be traced.

877
01:01:08,653 --> 01:01:10,519
We don't have to
stand on any corner.

878
01:01:11,621 --> 01:01:13,788
Dark Web. Could work.

879
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,790
Way better than Coachella.

880
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:19,059
Guys, the FBI can track us. The police...
No, they can't.

881
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:21,628
- Not if you use a Tor browser.
- What the fuck is that?

882
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,864
- Onion routing.
- Layered encryptions.

883
01:01:24,866 --> 01:01:27,233
It's like a game of Whac-A-Mole with
thousands of computers...

884
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:29,702
What the fuck
is a Whac-A-Mole?

885
01:01:29,704 --> 01:01:32,538
Look, these dark Web sites
run off these secret IP addresses.

886
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,540
Like LulzSec-level shady.

887
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:36,108
We need to find one somehow.

888
01:01:37,376 --> 01:01:39,210
W...

889
01:01:41,514 --> 01:01:44,381
<i>William Ian Sherwood III.</i>

890
01:01:44,383 --> 01:01:48,718
<i>Musician, scholar, rake, entrepreneur,
conspiracy theorist.</i>

891
01:01:58,161 --> 01:02:02,329
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy met William
at band camp three years ago.</i>

892
01:02:02,331 --> 01:02:07,533
Yo, if you niggas need some weed, I got you.
Good shit. Fair prices.

893
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:09,368
<i>William assured them that
he used the word "nigga"...</i>

894
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:11,169
<i>only as a term of endearment...</i>

895
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:14,305
<i>as explained by Q-Tip
in the classic song, "Sucka Nigga."</i>

896
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,842
That's your room right there.

897
01:02:18,844 --> 01:02:21,211
<i>After that,
they all hit it off.</i>

898
01:02:21,213 --> 01:02:24,280
<i>Though he never used that word
in front of them again.</i>

899
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,016
<i>The mission at band camp was to
give kids from different backgrounds...</i>

900
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:30,452
<i>a chance to exchange music and
experiences unique to their cultures.</i>

901
01:02:30,454 --> 01:02:34,755
W-W-Wait. Okay, so
you're saying white girls will suck dick...

902
01:02:34,757 --> 01:02:36,890
yet still claim they're virgins?

903
01:02:36,892 --> 01:02:40,460
Yeah, man. I'm serious.
Really?

904
01:02:40,462 --> 01:02:43,095
Dude, check it. I've been getting
head since I was, like, 12, all right?

905
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:46,431
I've been hitting hos in the ass
since I was, like, 14.

906
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:48,599
It's true, man.

907
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:52,602
These chicks will let you fill any hole,
except the pussy,

908
01:02:52,604 --> 01:02:54,604
with a dick, no problem.

909
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,040
So, technically,
you're still a virgin too.

910
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,043
- Yeah.
- Right.

911
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:05,646
But here's something
to wrap your brain around, man.

912
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:08,315
I've never had intercourse
with a pussy.

913
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:11,784
Mm-hmm?
Only asshole and oral. Okay?

914
01:03:13,186 --> 01:03:16,588
So the question isn't,
"Am I technically a virgin?"

915
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:19,357
What the question could be is...

916
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,826
"Am I technically... gay?"

917
01:03:23,661 --> 01:03:26,396
Oh. That's deep, nigga.

918
01:03:26,398 --> 01:03:29,298
Yeah. I don't know.

919
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:33,335
<i>William went to...
Prep school,</i>

920
01:03:33,337 --> 01:03:36,037
<i>where he smoked a pound of weed a week,
skipped classes...</i>

921
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:38,272
<i>and had a 1.9 GPA,</i>

922
01:03:38,274 --> 01:03:40,941
<i>yet got a perfect score
on his SAT.</i>

923
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:44,344
<i>He was accepted to his father's
alma mater under academic probation,</i>

924
01:03:44,346 --> 01:03:48,581
<i>which meant he had to maintain
a 3.0 grade point average.</i>

925
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:51,450
<i>So, William hacked into
the... database,</i>

926
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:54,953
<i>erasing all grades
from the entire freshman class.</i>

927
01:03:58,425 --> 01:04:01,125
Small-batch, craft-brewed,
40-ounce malt liquor.

928
01:04:10,968 --> 01:04:14,436
<i>That same year, he achieved
his dream of having sex with a black girl.</i>

929
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:16,137
You ever fucked on Molly before?

930
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:18,205
No.

931
01:04:18,207 --> 01:04:19,806
Hey, nah, it's good, man.

932
01:04:19,808 --> 01:04:24,110
It's like... It's like
being fucked by God.

933
01:04:28,749 --> 01:04:31,950
Everybody is going to Black Market
Reloaded and a bunch of smaller sites.

934
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:34,652
But, dude, that shit
is getting mad sketchy now.

935
01:04:34,654 --> 01:04:36,320
If you nigga...

936
01:04:37,588 --> 01:04:39,956
If you<i> guys</i> want drugs,

937
01:04:39,958 --> 01:04:43,059
I can get you good shit
way less expensive than online.

938
01:04:43,061 --> 01:04:45,661
Nigga, we don't need
to buy anything.

939
01:04:45,663 --> 01:04:48,597
We need to set up
a store to sell.

940
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:51,399
Wha... Nah, really, dude.
What can I get you, man?

941
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:54,101
I'm dead-ass serious,
nigga.

942
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:55,769
Dead-ass serious.

943
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,771
Okay.

944
01:04:57,773 --> 01:05:00,340
Okay.
All right. Wait.

945
01:05:00,342 --> 01:05:03,343
'Cause this is ridiculous, man.

946
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:06,679
Why the fuck,
after all these years,

947
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:10,615
you can call me N-word
and I can't say it?

948
01:05:10,617 --> 01:05:12,683
Yo, look, we already
went over this.

949
01:05:12,685 --> 01:05:15,686
I'll have to slap the shit out of you again.
I don't want to do that.

950
01:05:15,688 --> 01:05:18,755
See, that's not even right.
I mean, like, really.

951
01:05:18,757 --> 01:05:21,524
You know I'm not the one, all right?
This is all love here.

952
01:05:21,526 --> 01:05:23,692
Look, let's...
Let's get back...

953
01:05:23,694 --> 01:05:25,293
Hey, you asked me
to do something for you.

954
01:05:25,295 --> 01:05:27,662
I'm like, "What?" I'm down.
I don't give a fuck.

955
01:05:27,664 --> 01:05:31,966
Because you're my people,
all right? You're my n...

956
01:05:31,968 --> 01:05:33,500
And this is where
I would insert that word.

957
01:05:33,502 --> 01:05:35,168
It's nothing personal.
You're still my nigga.

958
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,436
But I gotta slap the shit
out of you based on principle.

959
01:05:37,438 --> 01:05:40,605
- Let's get back to what's goin' on.
- No, no, no. Wait. Principle?

960
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,474
Okay, you want to talk principle.
What about Jib here, man?

961
01:05:43,476 --> 01:05:45,142
This dude isn't
African-American.

962
01:05:45,144 --> 01:05:47,777
He's like fucking Latino
or Moroccan or some shit.

963
01:05:47,779 --> 01:05:49,044
Where's this conversation going?

964
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:50,979
Technically, he shouldn't
be able to say the word.

965
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,981
- Why can he use it?
- Okay. Because I'm 14% African.

966
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:55,016
Four... Fourteen?
That doesn't...

967
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:56,684
Shit, I'm probably 14%.

968
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,053
I am 14% African.
Ancestry.com.

969
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,021
Look, we don't give a fuck.

970
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,723
- For real?
- Just say the damn word, okay?

971
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:06,225
- It doesn't matter. It's cool, right?
- I don't give a shit.

972
01:06:06,227 --> 01:06:09,061
I give a fuck. Don't say that shit.
I will slap the shit out of you.

973
01:06:09,063 --> 01:06:12,397
No, no, no. No, you won't because
you have been outvoted by your peers.

974
01:06:12,399 --> 01:06:14,699
I'm George W. Bush.
I don't give a fuck what the vote says.

975
01:06:14,701 --> 01:06:16,381
Dig.
What the fuck?

976
01:06:17,735 --> 01:06:20,203
Let him say it.

977
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:25,140
- All right, you can say it.
- Thank you.

978
01:06:25,142 --> 01:06:27,542
And I appreciate that.
I really do.

979
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:29,544
Now, like a nigga was saying...

980
01:06:29,546 --> 01:06:31,145
What the fuck!

981
01:06:31,147 --> 01:06:33,180
What the fuck?

982
01:06:33,182 --> 01:06:35,582
What the fuck?
Yo, it was a reflex.

983
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:37,550
- Reflex? A fuckin' reflex?
- Dig!

984
01:06:37,552 --> 01:06:39,351
It won't happen again.
I'm sorry.

985
01:06:39,353 --> 01:06:43,087
Look. Will,
we need your help to sell this shit.

986
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:45,055
That's why we're here.

987
01:06:45,057 --> 01:06:48,324
- Whoa. How did you guys get this?
- It's a long story, man.

988
01:06:48,326 --> 01:06:50,526
We need to know
if you're gonna help us.

989
01:06:51,861 --> 01:06:54,662
Why? I mean, you guys
could set that type of shit up easily.

990
01:06:54,664 --> 01:06:56,697
Nah, nigga,
not like you. Okay?

991
01:06:56,699 --> 01:06:59,599
I need to go ghost.
None of this shit can point back to me.

992
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:02,868
The type of protection
I need for this shit requires a hacker.

993
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:05,003
Anon shit.

994
01:07:05,005 --> 01:07:07,405
You broke into
the fucking USC database.

995
01:07:07,407 --> 01:07:09,340
Hey, hey. No, no, no. Okay?

996
01:07:09,342 --> 01:07:11,375
Samo did that.
I don't know shit, all right?

997
01:07:11,377 --> 01:07:13,110
Whatever, nigga.

998
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,078
Look, we don't know shit
about selling dope.

999
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,712
Nothing.

1000
01:07:16,714 --> 01:07:18,780
Nothing about the units,
the terminology, the pricing.

1001
01:07:18,782 --> 01:07:21,382
None of that shit. I don't even know
how much this fucking bag is worth.

1002
01:07:21,384 --> 01:07:23,517
You do.

1003
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,385
Okay.

1004
01:07:25,387 --> 01:07:29,222
But if this is
a Samo-type job,

1005
01:07:29,224 --> 01:07:31,624
man, I can't just
do this as a favor.

1006
01:07:31,626 --> 01:07:33,425
What do you want?
A percentage of the profits?

1007
01:07:33,427 --> 01:07:35,427
Fuck that.

1008
01:07:35,429 --> 01:07:37,095
Pay me in Molly.

1009
01:07:38,965 --> 01:07:41,565
Cut up the shit. You're gonna want to
measure it out...

1010
01:07:41,567 --> 01:07:44,134
so you can bag it up in grams,
sell it that way.

1011
01:07:44,136 --> 01:07:48,905
But, you know, what a lot of the kids
are liking nowadays is the pill form.

1012
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,179
So, where we setting up shop?

1013
01:07:58,781 --> 01:08:00,648
Here.

1014
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:03,550
Here?
Yeah. Here.

1015
01:08:03,552 --> 01:08:05,285
Are you fuckin' retarded?

1016
01:08:05,287 --> 01:08:07,987
No. It's actually
genius, bro.

1017
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:09,588
<i>We have a science lab.</i>

1018
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:11,656
We want to enter
the Google Science Fair.

1019
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:13,658
All we need you to do
is open up the science labs,

1020
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:16,100
and we can do everything else.

1021
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:20,596
Don't lose that shit,
okay?

1022
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:23,331
<i>We have a computer lab
which nobody ever uses.</i>

1023
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:31,805
<i>And all the supplies laying around the
band room would be perfect for shipping.</i>

1024
01:08:36,344 --> 01:08:37,976
And the best part...
Watch.

1025
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,154
Nobody's going to suspect a thing.
We're just geeks doing what geeks do.

1026
01:08:54,024 --> 01:08:56,457
Right? That's what I'm saying, bro.
You're into it, bro.

1027
01:09:00,794 --> 01:09:02,327
<i>What's up?</i>

1028
01:09:02,329 --> 01:09:03,995
Yo.
What's up?

1029
01:09:03,997 --> 01:09:06,364
<i>Hey, congratulations
on getting the store set up.</i>

1030
01:09:06,366 --> 01:09:09,200
<i>Now, uh, we gotta get you guys
some customers, right?</i>

1031
01:09:09,202 --> 01:09:11,035
- Yeah.
- <i>Check it out.</i>

1032
01:09:11,037 --> 01:09:13,170
<i>My house is having a party.</i>

1033
01:09:13,172 --> 01:09:15,939
<i>We could use a cool band.</i>

1034
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:22,845
Okay. Say we're, like... What about
if you're quoting, like, rap lyrics?

1035
01:09:22,847 --> 01:09:25,214
Say we're all listening
to<i> The Chronic, Doggystyle.</i>

1036
01:09:25,216 --> 01:09:28,456
We're all rapping along.
Like, what are we supposed to say?

1037
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:32,954
I'm sorry.
That's bullshit, dude. Yes.

1038
01:09:32,956 --> 01:09:36,324
- What about the artist's intent?
- Dude, that is exactly what I'm talking about, man.

1039
01:09:36,326 --> 01:09:38,693
Dude, I saw your bitch, Lily,
on YouTube.

1040
01:09:38,695 --> 01:09:43,163
Okay. Well, Lily is not
my bitch anymore, so...

1041
01:09:43,165 --> 01:09:45,665
Then can I get at her, dude?
'Cause I gotta find out what she was on.

1042
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:48,167
Nigga, I don't give a fuck.
All right?

1043
01:09:48,169 --> 01:09:54,039
Go for it, dude.
Hey, but for real, she was using this.

1044
01:09:57,243 --> 01:10:00,978
Um... Mike check.
One, two. One, two.

1045
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,746
Um, hi.

1046
01:10:02,748 --> 01:10:05,014
I'm Malcolm Ad-Rock
on guitar.

1047
01:10:05,016 --> 01:10:09,018
We've got diggity
Diggy Dawson on the drums,

1048
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:12,988
and we've got steel-faced bobblehead Jibby
right here on the bass.

1049
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:14,923
Play something, Fresh Prince!

1050
01:10:14,925 --> 01:10:18,493
All right.
We are Awreeoh.

1051
01:10:18,495 --> 01:10:22,262
We're about to turn it up, okay?
One, two.

1052
01:10:22,264 --> 01:10:24,563
One, two, three, four.

1053
01:10:52,788 --> 01:10:55,988
What the fuck?

1054
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:56,902
<i>Diggy, Diggy, Diggy!</i>

1055
01:12:02,775 --> 01:12:06,243
<i>Yo, fuck Molly, dawg!
It's all about that Lily, son!</i>

1056
01:12:06,245 --> 01:12:08,578
<i>How am I supposed
to eat my p-p-p...</i>

1057
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,879
<i>Pound cake?</i>

1058
01:12:09,881 --> 01:12:11,614
<i>Eat my pound cake.</i>

1059
01:12:11,616 --> 01:12:13,582
<i>My pound cake!</i>

1060
01:12:15,918 --> 01:12:18,753
<i>Is this Channel 10?
You're all out here, huh?</i>

1061
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:20,921
<i>Hey, homey, videotape this.</i>

1062
01:12:20,923 --> 01:12:23,204
<i>I want to tweet
this later, man.</i>

1063
01:12:26,193 --> 01:12:28,793
Son of a bitch.

1064
01:12:32,896 --> 01:12:34,463
"Lily"?

1065
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,967
I can't believe we're
really doing this right now.

1066
01:12:48,443 --> 01:12:50,443
No.

1067
01:12:57,749 --> 01:12:59,683
This shit better work, Will.

1068
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:18,262
Oh, shit.

1069
01:13:33,741 --> 01:13:36,309
<i>Lily, dude,
that was unbelievable.</i>

1070
01:13:51,658 --> 01:13:54,660
Principal Harris tells me that there are
three young men...

1071
01:13:54,662 --> 01:13:56,862
who actually joined
the Google Science Fair.

1072
01:13:56,864 --> 01:13:58,396
Please.

1073
01:14:05,003 --> 01:14:07,037
Proof...

1074
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,006
that the public school system
is still a ladder...

1075
01:14:10,008 --> 01:14:11,507
to success.

1076
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:15,143
Half an ounce for Joe Patterson.

1077
01:14:15,145 --> 01:14:17,645
We have an ounce
for John Smith.

1078
01:14:17,647 --> 01:14:20,014
We have an eighth
for Ashley Down.

1079
01:14:20,016 --> 01:14:21,582
- Susan Thompson.
- Steve Burke.

1080
01:14:28,622 --> 01:14:30,789
<i>Yeah, this popped up
about a few weeks ago.</i>

1081
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:33,992
Look at what they're moving.
It's major volume too.

1082
01:14:33,994 --> 01:14:36,461
I don't know why
they're calling it "Lily."

1083
01:14:36,463 --> 01:14:40,998
Maybe, uh, 2 Chainz
called it that on a mixtape.

1084
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,633
He's a rapper.
Yeah, you know, "The Birthday Song."

1085
01:14:43,635 --> 01:14:45,801
"Big booty ho."

1086
01:14:47,136 --> 01:14:49,176
Okay, never mind.
Forget it.

1087
01:14:58,813 --> 01:15:00,747
Hi.

1088
01:15:02,182 --> 01:15:06,084
Um, is that offer
still on the table?

1089
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:09,187
Help.

1090
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:11,022
If you're busy,
I can come back tomorrow or later.

1091
01:15:11,024 --> 01:15:13,758
No, um, no. They're...
They're about to leave.

1092
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,059
Yeah.
Yeah, we were stepping.

1093
01:15:17,394 --> 01:15:19,294
Okay, cool. Thanks.

1094
01:15:29,938 --> 01:15:31,771
Bye. Bye, guys.
Have fun.

1095
01:15:53,224 --> 01:15:55,123
Thanks for helping me.

1096
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:57,225
No problem.

1097
01:15:57,227 --> 01:15:59,126
You're a fast learner.

1098
01:15:59,128 --> 01:16:00,660
Aw.

1099
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,930
Thanks.

1100
01:16:10,635 --> 01:16:13,115
Shit's been real crazy
since Dom got locked up.

1101
01:16:15,806 --> 01:16:18,966
A few of his boys
got smoked on the corner the other day.

1102
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:28,903
I don't want
to go back there.

1103
01:16:36,591 --> 01:16:39,159
Sorry. I just don't have people
I can talk to about this stuff...

1104
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,442
that understand, you know?

1105
01:16:42,396 --> 01:16:44,163
I know.

1106
01:16:45,565 --> 01:16:47,032
Thanks.

1107
01:16:53,138 --> 01:16:55,458
Dom called from jail
the other day.

1108
01:16:57,507 --> 01:16:59,374
He asked about you.

1109
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:08,048
That's why you showed up
all of a sudden.

1110
01:17:09,116 --> 01:17:10,783
What's that supposed to mean?

1111
01:17:10,785 --> 01:17:13,552
It means that Dom sent you here
as his messenger.

1112
01:17:15,154 --> 01:17:17,988
All this crying on my shoulder?
Bullshit.

1113
01:17:19,523 --> 01:17:22,091
You're supposed
to put your feminine wiles on me...

1114
01:17:22,093 --> 01:17:23,926
and find out
about the fucking dope.

1115
01:17:23,928 --> 01:17:25,894
Right?

1116
01:17:26,428 --> 01:17:27,895
Right?

1117
01:17:37,771 --> 01:17:39,772
Wait. I...

1118
01:17:39,774 --> 01:17:42,007
And here I was, stupid enough to think
that you were different...

1119
01:17:42,009 --> 01:17:44,175
than these other niggas.

1120
01:17:44,177 --> 01:17:45,676
Nakia, Nakia, Nakia.

1121
01:17:45,678 --> 01:17:47,177
Fuck you!

1122
01:17:57,855 --> 01:18:00,289
"Feminine wiles"?

1123
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:03,058
Good morning.
Today you're going to take the SAT.

1124
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:06,227
The SAT is your chance to show
how prepared you are for college.

1125
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:09,863
You will have 25 minutes
to work on section one.

1126
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:13,466
Yo, what the fuck was that?

1127
01:18:13,468 --> 01:18:15,568
What do you mean,
you don't know?

1128
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:17,469
Drug search, dawg.

1129
01:18:17,471 --> 01:18:19,904
They do it randomly,
like, every month or so.

1130
01:18:19,906 --> 01:18:22,039
It's all for show. I mean,
it's not like somebody is stupid enough...

1131
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:24,601
to put some shit
in their locker.

1132
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,076
Can I go to the bathroom?

1133
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:29,344
Yes, but you will not
be given more time.

1134
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:04,739
Man.
Come on, man.

1135
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:07,008
What in the hell
are you doing?

1136
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:09,143
Um, SAT's.

1137
01:19:09,145 --> 01:19:11,145
SAT's?

1138
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:15,114
I had to use the restroom,
and I'm kind of late getting back.

1139
01:19:15,116 --> 01:19:16,682
You know?

1140
01:19:18,785 --> 01:19:20,819
Thank you.
Good luck, little man.

1141
01:19:20,821 --> 01:19:24,189
<i>Bring that beat back!
One, two, three, four!</i>

1142
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:26,224
<i>Here it is!
The set ain't over!</i>

1143
01:19:26,226 --> 01:19:28,559
<i>Come on, y'all.
Let's get busy.</i>

1144
01:19:28,561 --> 01:19:31,528
<i>Come on. Say "Yeah!"</i>

1145
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:34,230
<i>Say "Hell yeah!"</i>

1146
01:19:34,232 --> 01:19:36,532
<i>- Ain't it funky?
- I'm not doing this shit no more.</i>

1147
01:19:36,534 --> 01:19:38,333
Bro, I can fix this shit.

1148
01:19:38,335 --> 01:19:40,702
I can fix this shit.

1149
01:19:40,704 --> 01:19:43,004
The bag is almost done.
The shit is almost gone.

1150
01:19:43,006 --> 01:19:46,240
I mean, I can't sell this shit no more.
We almost just got fucking caught.

1151
01:19:46,242 --> 01:19:49,810
Look, I don't want to go to jail.
I want to go to fucking college.

1152
01:19:49,812 --> 01:19:52,379
I want to get a good job.
I want to help my mom!

1153
01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:53,446
Dig?

1154
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:58,316
That's cool.

1155
01:19:59,584 --> 01:20:01,885
It's my fault,
my weight to carry.

1156
01:20:01,887 --> 01:20:03,753
Yo, that's bullshit.

1157
01:20:05,355 --> 01:20:08,389
We all wanted to go to Dom's party.
Especially you, Jib.

1158
01:20:09,724 --> 01:20:11,391
It's our weight to carry too.

1159
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:14,926
We've got your back
to the end, right?

1160
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:17,928
Right?

1161
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,633
Fuck.

1162
01:20:28,236 --> 01:20:29,769
Ooh.

1163
01:20:29,771 --> 01:20:32,872
- There it is.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

1164
01:20:32,874 --> 01:20:35,441
All right, so, when we get
the Bitcoins, then what?

1165
01:20:35,443 --> 01:20:36,975
I need cash.

1166
01:20:39,078 --> 01:20:41,412
Well, you would have to
do a currency exchange...

1167
01:20:41,414 --> 01:20:44,715
to get the US dollar equivalent,
but, I mean...

1168
01:20:44,717 --> 01:20:47,751
That kind of defeats the purpose of
a non-fiat currency, right?

1169
01:20:47,753 --> 01:20:50,854
Okay, see, I don't give a fuck about
all that Aaron Swartz...

1170
01:20:50,856 --> 01:20:52,789
Occupy Wall Street shit.

1171
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:57,226
Okay, well, you'd have to link your
Bitcoin account to a bank account,

1172
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,962
and then there's
this infinitesimally small chance...

1173
01:20:59,964 --> 01:21:01,763
that it could be traced.

1174
01:21:01,765 --> 01:21:04,899
I mean, the Feds would have to
know exactly what they're looking for.

1175
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:08,102
It's not something
they could just stumble upon randomly.

1176
01:21:08,104 --> 01:21:13,573
Basically, I would just have to make
a stupid-ass mistake for them to trace it.

1177
01:21:13,575 --> 01:21:17,409
And do I look like the type of nigga that
makes stupid-ass mistakes?

1178
01:21:20,412 --> 01:21:21,645
Um...

1179
01:21:22,947 --> 01:21:25,715
So, you want me
to set up that exchange?

1180
01:21:25,717 --> 01:21:27,917
I'm... I'm good.
I'll do it.

1181
01:21:27,919 --> 01:21:29,418
- Um...
- Huh?

1182
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,686
What if I want
zero chances of trace?

1183
01:21:33,155 --> 01:21:35,256
Well...

1184
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:37,191
if you want zero trace,

1185
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:40,727
you gotta go
black market, homey.

1186
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,463
<i>Yeah, you got to put
the Bitcoins on a drive...</i>

1187
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,064
<i>and make
a hand-to-hand exchange.</i>

1188
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:48,734
<i>You get cash
minus the transaction fee.</i>

1189
01:21:48,736 --> 01:21:52,437
<i>If you really want to go that route...
and I really don't suggest it...</i>

1190
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:54,338
<i>I know a dude
in the garment district.</i>

1191
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:56,239
<i>Ask for Fidel.</i>

1192
01:21:56,241 --> 01:21:59,809
<i>If you pass his test,
he'll help you.</i>

1193
01:22:01,011 --> 01:22:03,412
<i>If you don't...</i>

1194
01:22:03,414 --> 01:22:06,314
<i>Well, just pass his test.</i>

1195
01:22:06,316 --> 01:22:09,617
One of these alligator bags
was made here.

1196
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:11,485
One is from the store.

1197
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:14,354
Which one is which?

1198
01:22:14,356 --> 01:22:16,589
The right one,
I mean, 'cause it's...

1199
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:18,457
Mm-hmm.
Poofier.

1200
01:22:18,459 --> 01:22:21,059
They both look the same.

1201
01:22:24,496 --> 01:22:26,430
The reality is...

1202
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:29,299
I sell 90% of my stuff
to white hos.

1203
01:22:29,301 --> 01:22:31,834
Most are rich enough
to afford retail.

1204
01:22:31,836 --> 01:22:33,569
Why do you think that is?

1205
01:22:34,837 --> 01:22:36,704
I don't know.

1206
01:22:36,706 --> 01:22:40,207
They know. They know
the only difference...

1207
01:22:40,209 --> 01:22:42,475
between these two bags...

1208
01:22:42,477 --> 01:22:44,176
is the person rocking them.

1209
01:22:44,178 --> 01:22:46,378
So, when they rock 'em,

1210
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:48,380
people are gonna assume
it's real.

1211
01:22:48,382 --> 01:22:51,282
And the flip of that is...

1212
01:22:51,284 --> 01:22:54,718
it doesn't matter if you had the receipt
from Barneys sewn into the bag.

1213
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:58,388
People gonna assume it's fake.

1214
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,089
Only you know the truth.

1215
01:23:02,492 --> 01:23:04,826
So, what are you, man?

1216
01:23:04,828 --> 01:23:06,494
Are you a real?

1217
01:23:06,496 --> 01:23:09,196
Are you a fake?

1218
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,364
That's what I need to find out.

1219
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:13,699
I'm just Malcolm.

1220
01:23:13,701 --> 01:23:16,401
"Just Malcolm"?
Who the fuck is Malcolm?

1221
01:23:16,403 --> 01:23:20,103
Show me. I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.

1222
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:25,507
Hey!
Don't look at them.

1223
01:23:25,509 --> 01:23:29,410
This is between you and me.
I'm-a give you five seconds.

1224
01:23:29,412 --> 01:23:33,480
You can either man up
or run out like the little bitch you is.

1225
01:23:34,648 --> 01:23:37,416
- One!
- Malcolm, let's just go.

1226
01:23:37,418 --> 01:23:39,985
Listen to your friends, boy.
Two!

1227
01:23:39,987 --> 01:23:42,654
You can't be serious.
I'm more than serious, motherfucker.

1228
01:23:42,656 --> 01:23:44,756
Three!
I need that money.

1229
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:47,592
You ain't gettin' shit.
Four!

1230
01:23:47,594 --> 01:23:50,027
Yeah, you see
your pussy friends leaving?

1231
01:23:50,029 --> 01:23:51,629
They're running
like some little bitches.

1232
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,530
Run, pussy.

1233
01:23:54,532 --> 01:23:56,732
Five! Five! Five!

1234
01:23:56,734 --> 01:23:58,433
Hit me, man!
Five, motherfuck...

1235
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:13,680
Oh, man. You...

1236
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:26,191
Drive.
Where?

1237
01:24:26,193 --> 01:24:29,594
Give me the drive!
Shit.

1238
01:24:47,745 --> 01:24:49,178
Come here, man.

1239
01:24:56,318 --> 01:24:58,419
Now I know who you are...

1240
01:24:58,421 --> 01:25:01,155
A man that
does not give a fuck.

1241
01:25:19,404 --> 01:25:22,105
Hey, blood!
Don't you owe me another shoe, nigga?

1242
01:25:22,107 --> 01:25:24,173
Shit!

1243
01:25:24,175 --> 01:25:26,475
Get on the ground,
bitch-ass nigga.

1244
01:25:26,477 --> 01:25:29,644
- Get the fuck off me!
- Malcolm!

1245
01:25:29,646 --> 01:25:32,747
- Get off us! Malcolm!
- Stay the fuck down, nigga.

1246
01:25:32,749 --> 01:25:35,516
- Malcolm!
- Bitch nigga. Yeah.

1247
01:25:35,518 --> 01:25:37,951
Yeah!

1248
01:25:37,953 --> 01:25:40,420
- Jib, get the fucking bag.
- Come on!

1249
01:25:40,422 --> 01:25:43,221
Oh, shit.

1250
01:25:44,957 --> 01:25:46,524
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, hold on.

1251
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:50,761
Give me the bag.

1252
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:02,538
Please,
just give me the bag.

1253
01:26:15,816 --> 01:26:18,551
I don't even want
that shit, blood.

1254
01:26:18,553 --> 01:26:21,787
Let's go, nigga.
All right. Come on.

1255
01:26:21,789 --> 01:26:23,421
We out, we out, we out.

1256
01:26:31,494 --> 01:26:33,194
It's okay.

1257
01:26:36,364 --> 01:26:37,597
It's okay.

1258
01:26:48,008 --> 01:26:50,009
Come on.

1259
01:26:50,011 --> 01:26:51,443
Let's go.

1260
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,781
That's 10%.

1261
01:27:32,783 --> 01:27:35,016
Consider it a proffer.

1262
01:27:35,018 --> 01:27:38,719
- The rest is in a Bitcoin account.
- Bitcoin?

1263
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:41,689
It's an untraceable
Internet currency.

1264
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:44,992
There are Web sites
that sell a lot of things...

1265
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:47,961
that people would
get in trouble for selling.

1266
01:27:47,963 --> 01:27:50,663
They use Bitcoins.

1267
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:52,531
Kind of like Amazon.

1268
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:54,232
So you sold on the Internet?

1269
01:27:55,133 --> 01:27:56,600
No.

1270
01:27:57,668 --> 01:28:00,169
No. You did.

1271
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:02,137
Excuse me?

1272
01:28:02,139 --> 01:28:05,105
You set up a store
on Black Market Reloaded.

1273
01:28:06,173 --> 01:28:07,740
Very successful.

1274
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:09,374
Very successful.

1275
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:12,810
I mean, you moved
your entire inventory.

1276
01:28:12,812 --> 01:28:15,579
See, the market's
been pretty volatile,

1277
01:28:15,581 --> 01:28:21,417
but as of right now,
you have $97,267 and 31 cents...

1278
01:28:21,419 --> 01:28:24,486
in your Bitcoin
exchange account.

1279
01:28:26,189 --> 01:28:28,522
10,000 in cash.

1280
01:28:28,524 --> 01:28:32,092
Now, as long as your Bitcoins stay
in the exchange account,

1281
01:28:32,094 --> 01:28:34,861
they're safe, untraceable.

1282
01:28:34,863 --> 01:28:40,032
Now, if you were to exchange
the Bitcoins into dollars...

1283
01:28:40,034 --> 01:28:43,802
and transfer that money into your
Jacoby Check Cashing corporate account,

1284
01:28:45,671 --> 01:28:50,107
there would be a really, really
small chance of it getting traced...

1285
01:28:50,109 --> 01:28:52,843
by the DEA or FBI.

1286
01:28:52,845 --> 01:28:56,879
I mean, that would only happen if
you were idiotically sloppy...

1287
01:28:56,881 --> 01:28:59,214
while setting up
the Bitcoin exchange account.

1288
01:29:00,684 --> 01:29:02,283
So you want me
to set up that exchange?

1289
01:29:02,285 --> 01:29:03,784
I'm good. I'll do it.

1290
01:29:03,786 --> 01:29:08,121
I mean, that... I mean,
it would almost have to be...

1291
01:29:10,257 --> 01:29:12,057
intentional.

1292
01:29:15,727 --> 01:29:18,395
And why should I believe
any of this, Malcolm?

1293
01:29:18,397 --> 01:29:21,197
Is your Jacoby APS
shipping account number...

1294
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:23,899
<i>FX4578?</i>

1295
01:29:23,901 --> 01:29:29,070
<i>California regional
bank number 267856783?</i>

1296
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:31,705
Federal Tax ID 95...

1297
01:29:31,707 --> 01:29:35,642
Hey, you really should just
upgrade your firewall, you know?

1298
01:29:35,644 --> 01:29:38,945
I actually know a guy. He's kind of
familiar with your system already.

1299
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:48,620
You're all out
of toilet paper, hon.

1300
01:29:48,622 --> 01:29:52,056
Courtside, okay? Courtside.
Gotta have it. No, come on.

1301
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,732
Now, what if I report
to the authorities...

1302
01:30:02,734 --> 01:30:04,967
that my securities
have been breached...

1303
01:30:04,969 --> 01:30:07,169
and my identity has been stolen?

1304
01:30:07,171 --> 01:30:09,771
As I've just learned,

1305
01:30:09,773 --> 01:30:11,893
it doesn't matter
if this bag is real or fake.

1306
01:30:13,508 --> 01:30:16,576
Because of where I come from,
everybody's going to assume it's fake.

1307
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,978
So, since you and I come
from the same place,

1308
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,948
what is the DEA going
to assume about you?

1309
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,750
And because you and I
are from the same place, Malcolm,

1310
01:30:25,752 --> 01:30:29,653
you should know what a person
like me can do to a person like you.

1311
01:30:29,655 --> 01:30:32,088
Yeah.

1312
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:34,410
But that's not what
a Harvard man would do.

1313
01:30:35,992 --> 01:30:39,194
Nah, see, a man of Harvard
is smart enough to see...

1314
01:30:39,196 --> 01:30:41,162
that would set off
a chain of events...

1315
01:30:41,164 --> 01:30:44,098
that would inevitably come back
and destroy him...

1316
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,733
<i>and everything he's built.</i>

1317
01:30:47,634 --> 01:30:50,702
<i>That would be a shame.</i>

1318
01:30:50,704 --> 01:30:54,605
So, I think you should take this
opportunity before you very seriously.

1319
01:30:56,608 --> 01:31:00,477
Do everything in your power
to ensure that I become a man of Harvard...

1320
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:03,913
and make sure nothing happens
to a hair on my gorgeous head.

1321
01:31:05,282 --> 01:31:06,715
Can you dig it?

1322
01:31:19,894 --> 01:31:22,860
Malcolm,
you forgot your bag.

1323
01:31:25,196 --> 01:31:26,696
It's fake.

1324
01:31:40,642 --> 01:31:42,542
<i>Malcolm.</i>

1325
01:31:42,544 --> 01:31:45,678
You're pretty damn arrogant.
You think you're gonna get into Harvard?

1326
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,113
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1327
01:32:03,662 --> 01:32:05,462
Let me tell you
about two students.

1328
01:32:08,532 --> 01:32:11,600
<i>Student "A" is a straight-A student
who lives in the suburbs of Los Angeles.</i>

1329
01:32:15,537 --> 01:32:17,838
<i>He plays in a punk band
with his best friends.</i>

1330
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,941
<i>He loves to skateboard
and ride on his BMX bike.</i>

1331
01:32:20,943 --> 01:32:25,011
<i>His favorite TV show is</i> Game Of Thrones<i>
and his favorite band is The Thermals.</i>

1332
01:32:25,013 --> 01:32:28,180
<i>He's a '90s hip-hop geek.</i>

1333
01:32:28,182 --> 01:32:31,216
<i>Student "B" goes
to an underfunded school...</i>

1334
01:32:31,218 --> 01:32:33,284
<i>where teachers who would
rather not be there...</i>

1335
01:32:33,286 --> 01:32:37,187
<i>teach kids
who really don't care.</i>

1336
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:40,069
<i>He lives with a single mother,
doesn't know his father and has sold dope.</i>

1337
01:32:43,393 --> 01:32:45,293
<i>Now close your eyes.</i>

1338
01:32:45,295 --> 01:32:48,863
<i>Picture each of these kids
and tell me what you see.</i>

1339
01:32:48,865 --> 01:32:51,699
<i>Be honest.
No one's going to judge you.</i>

1340
01:32:51,701 --> 01:32:53,767
<i>Now open your eyes.</i>

1341
01:32:53,769 --> 01:32:56,035
So, am I student "A"
or student "B"?

1342
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:57,970
Am I a geek or a menace?

1343
01:32:57,972 --> 01:33:00,706
For most of my life, I've been caught in
between who I really am...

1344
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:02,374
and how I'm perceived,

1345
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:04,675
in between categories
and definition.

1346
01:33:05,977 --> 01:33:07,544
I don't fit in.

1347
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:10,947
And I used to think that
that was a curse, but...

1348
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:13,315
now I'm slowly
starting to see...

1349
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:16,384
maybe it's a blessing.

1350
01:33:16,386 --> 01:33:18,319
See, when you don't fit in,

1351
01:33:18,321 --> 01:33:21,588
you're forced to see the world from
many different angles and points of view.

1352
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:26,492
You gain knowledge, life lessons
from disparate people and places.

1353
01:33:26,494 --> 01:33:29,495
And those lessons,
for better or worse, have shaped me.

1354
01:33:29,497 --> 01:33:31,263
So, who am I?

1355
01:33:31,265 --> 01:33:34,633
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
My name is Malcolm Adekanbi.

1356
01:33:34,635 --> 01:33:37,602
I'm a straight-A student
with nearly perfect SAT scores.

1357
01:33:37,604 --> 01:33:40,671
I taught myself
how to play guitar and read music.

1358
01:33:40,673 --> 01:33:44,274
I have stellar recommendations
and diverse extracurricular activities.

1359
01:33:44,276 --> 01:33:46,409
I am a Google Science Fair
participant,

1360
01:33:46,411 --> 01:33:49,878
and in three weeks, I helped make
over $100,000 for an online business.

1361
01:33:51,247 --> 01:33:53,848
So, why do I want
to attend Harvard?

1362
01:33:55,984 --> 01:33:58,784
If I was white, would you even have to
ask me that question?

1363
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,313
Nice haircut.

1364
01:35:51,615 --> 01:35:53,282
I like it.

1365
01:35:58,121 --> 01:36:00,889
I'm... I'm sorry...

1366
01:36:00,891 --> 01:36:04,792
for all the stuff that I said.

1367
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:10,130
There was a lot going on
at the time.

1368
01:36:10,132 --> 01:36:13,433
And... that wasn't me.

1369
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:17,436
Yeah, it was.

1370
01:36:19,739 --> 01:36:22,640
You might have all
these other folks fooled, but not me.

1371
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:25,375
You're...

1372
01:36:26,877 --> 01:36:28,444
complicated.

1373
01:36:32,682 --> 01:36:35,282
Anyway, I just came by
to say thank you.

1374
01:36:37,351 --> 01:36:39,418
Thank you?

1375
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:41,486
You... You passed?
Mm-hmm.

1376
01:36:41,488 --> 01:36:43,287
You passed.

1377
01:36:44,656 --> 01:36:46,556
You were supposed to
go to prom with me.

1378
01:36:46,558 --> 01:36:48,524
No.

1379
01:36:48,526 --> 01:36:51,226
I told you I wasn't mad
about missing prom.

1380
01:36:53,229 --> 01:36:54,796
Hey.

1381
01:36:56,098 --> 01:36:58,899
I was mad about
missing Six Flags.

1382
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:11,128
I'll pick you up
in the morning.
