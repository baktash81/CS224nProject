and not see this beautiful calendar.

105
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,833
Eh, because it's gotten
a little over-complicated.

00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,916
Hum.

337
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,458
I know it sounds crazy,
but it is a true game changer.

338
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:17,083
They liberate kids
and give them a rare sense of autonomy,

339
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,625
and it sets the parents free too.

340
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,791
Yeah, Mr. Coach Deacon,

341
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,666
I would love to just
take a day off from being a mom

342
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,666
and let my kids do whatever they want,

343
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,333
but I'd also love to find
a rainbow unicorn and fly it to the moon.

344
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,750
Then I think you'd want a pegasus.

345
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,208
More of a pegacorn.

346
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,833
[chuckles]

347
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,083
The point is, you don't know our kids.

348
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
Oh, these tots have turned.

349
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,458
If we tried what you're proposing,

350
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,125
it... it would be apocalyptic.

351
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:51,166
You're right. I don't know your kids.
I don't know everything,

352
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,250
but...

353
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,666
I will say this.

354
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,166
You should say yes to a Yes Day.

355
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,500
Ooh! Meatloaf!

356
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,166
"Kids who are given Yes Days
consume less sugar,"

357
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,500
not really,
"and spend less time on the Internet."

358
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,875
It doesn't make sense.
You're not falling for this?

359
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,416
Everything happens for a reason.

360
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,458
Maybe there's a reason
that guy showed up with those tater tots.

361
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:21,458
Maybe by being a little less serious,
we can make things better.

362
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,166
I mean, you said it yourself.

363
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:27,375
We've been trying to do it the right way.
Maybe it's time to try something new.

364
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,583
[sighs]

365
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,458
So? Tired of hearing how great I am?

366
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,333
You want to give
Steven Spielberg here a Yes Day?

367
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,791
What's a Yes Day?

368
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,500
This new thing where parents agree

369
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,958
to say yes to everything
their kids ask for for 24 hours.

370
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,291
- Radical!
- How am I just hearing about this?

371
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,875
Well, don't get too excited.
Mom probably won't let us have one anyway.

372
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,041
Well, what does that mean? Why wouldn't I?

373
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,916
[Katie] Yes Days are, like, fun.

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,708
And you're, like, a fun killer.

375
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,791
- Oh.
- Come on, Katie, your mom is plenty fun.

376
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,291
She is fun.

377
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,500
[soft music playing]

378
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,750
I have had a very long day,
and I'm gonna go to bed.

379
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,625
- So, good night.
- [Carlos] No, we...

380
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,791
We still need to...

381
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,708
- [Allison] It's okay.
- Honey? Tell your mom she's fun.

382
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,875
- Nando?
- You told us never to lie.

383
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,958
Yeah, Daddy.

384
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,541
[faint screaming]

385
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,041
Hey, guys.

386
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,416
[whispers] Hey.

387
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,291
Of course you think your mom can't be fun.
You don't even know me.

388
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,625
I invented fun. I... I used to be
the funnest person I knew.

389
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,125
What happened?

390
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,250
What happened was I had three babies
that had to be kept safe and alive.

391
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,458
It was a lot of pressure,
but that's not the point.

392
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,916
The point is, I can be fun again.

393
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,375
Mom, really? There's no way.

394
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,083
[clicks tongue] I'll have a Yes Day.

395
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,875
We will have a super time.

396
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,791
Just you watch and see.

397
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,291
Mama can haiku too.

398
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,208
Sorry, but you couldn't make it through
a Yes Morning, let alone a Yes Day.

399
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,750
[clicks tongue] Would you like to have
a little wager on that?

400
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,916
Know what? I'd love to.

401
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,500
Hm. How about this?

402
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,750
If you say no one time,

403
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,708
I get to go to Fleekfest with Layla.
No adults, no parents.

404
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,375
Just us young, underage, vulnerable girls.

405
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,083
Wait, honey. Are you sure?

406
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,291
I'll take your wager, missy,

407
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,500
because I know that I won't say no.

408
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,916
And when you lose, and you will lose,

409
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,166
I am so fun that
you will still get to go to your concert.

410
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,041
- Really?
- Absolutely.

411
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,166
With me.

412
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,375
I'll sit next to you,
and we'll hold hands.

413
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,618
We'll put our hands in the air
like we just don't care.

414
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,750
I want in on this.

415
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,250
Me too.

416
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,375
Let's do this.

417
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,208
[all] <i>Arriba!</i>

418
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,583
[Allison]<i> There are ground rules, though.
The Yes Day has to be earned.</i>

419
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,916
<i>Do your chores.</i>

420
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,583
<i>Finish your homework.</i>

421
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,666
You can do better.

422
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:19,250
[Allison] <i>You can't ask to do anything
dangerous or illegal, obviously.</i>

423
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,333
- What are you guys up to over there?
- Don't worry. It's totally safe.

424
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,083
[Allison]<i> You'll each have a budget,</i>

425
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,750
<i>and you can't ask to travel
more than 20 miles from home.</i>

426
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:38,333
So this rules out Magic Mountain,
Japan, and all space tourism.

427
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:42,333
Will you have to say yes
to absolutely everything?

428
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,208
Close, but there are some rules.

429
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,458
Oh man!

430
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,125
Yes, bud.

431
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,708
[Allison]
<i>But the last rule is the biggest,</i>

432
00:19:54,791 --> 00:20:00,333
<i>that this family has the most fun
we've ever had in our entire lives.</i>

433
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,833
Any second. Any second.
Any second. Any second. Any second.

435
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,041

00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,416
Everybody, wake up!

437
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
All right.

Come on, you sleepyheads. Get up! Come on.

441
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:24,125
Nando, it's too early.
We have the whole day. Go back to bed.

442
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,041
Mom?

443
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,333
- Having regrets, Mom?
- Mom?

444
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,416
[Katie] Look, she's so afraid,
she can't even move.

445

What've you done with our mother?

453
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,791
You know my rule
about no bouncing on the bed?

454
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,000
Wanna bounce on the bed?

455
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,875
- Yes!
- [Nando] Sure!

456
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,500
Do it! Do it!

457
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,125
I know you're too mature. It's okay. Whoo!

- [Nando] This is so much fun!
- [Ellie] Nando!

- Get up!
- No!

00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,541
- Wake up!
- No! Get off!

00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,708

- Are you serious?
- Sorry, Mama.

467
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,375
The entire day you can't use anything
that has a screen.

468
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,583
That means no cell phones,
no laptops, no iPads, nada.

00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,375
What? Can I at least tell them
that I'll be off the grid?

- Please?
- I'm not the boss.

Okay, fine. You have one minute.

Yeah, the speaker...
You know what? Forget it. I'll text you.

Sorry, Dad. Time's up.

476
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,666
You knew to be prepared.

And we are so glad
that you're so prepared.

- Ah.

I'm... I'm glad
you're using your watercolors.

- Yeah.

- Yep.

Really? She's gonna use glitter?

487
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,916
Should we make you look
as crazy as possible?

488
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,041
Yes.

489
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,958

- Yes.

Do you think we should get a dog?

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,500
- Thank you.
- What's that?

507
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,583
We made a list of our five big asks.

508
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,375
For the day to be a success,
we have to make it through all five.

509
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,833
I love a list.

510
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:51,916
Number one!

511
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,250
- [Carlos] Is that Korean?
- [Nando] Breakfast surprise!

512
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,375
To the Explorer!

513
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,750
- We gotta change first, right?
- [Ellie] No!

514
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,916
- Katie?
- Right?

515
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,083
[Ellie] Nope on a rope.

516
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,291
Hey, kids, what is it
with the sparklies around number five?

517
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,583
The main event.

518
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,416
The only thing that
we can tell you about it is nothing.

519
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,375
Not even a hint?

520
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,125
The less you know, the better.

521
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,083
Oh, okay.

522
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,833
I'll be gone for the main event.
I'll be at Fleekfest.

523
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,500
It's gonna be so much fun!

524
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:23,125
I've been memorizing all the lyrics to
the H-E-R songs, and they're really good.

525
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,083
Mom, it's H.E.R.

526
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,708
Oh, H.E.R.? Okay.

527
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,851
- Who's H.E.R.?
- [Nando] This is H.E.R. on the radio.

528
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,708
She's the headliner for Fleekfest.

529
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,041
You know,
Katie and my girls' night tonight.

530
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,208
[Katie] You're not going.

531
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,500
Layla's cousin Julie's taking us.
I told her she could have the ticket.

532
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:40,583
Oh, you might want to tell Layla's cousin
Julie not to get her hopes up.

533
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,125
Last time I checked, it was a bet,
and I'm gonna win.

534
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,208
No, you're not.

535
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,416
Yeah, I am.

536
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,166
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
- [Katie] No. Not like that.

537
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,750
- [Nando] So embarrassing.
- Yes. Yes.

538
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,416
[H.E.R. song playing]

539
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,041
- Hi, we're celebrating our first...
- No! You can't tell him it's Yes Day.

540
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,458
Okay.

541
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,666
[Allison] Oh, coffee.

542
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,333
[Carlos] Ah, breakfast.

543
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,333
Hi. Where's the carnival?

544
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,583
Looks like Burning Man.

545
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,708
What can I get you?

546
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,291
Some acai bowls? Smoothies?

547
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,333
- Yes.
- We'd like that one, please.

548
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,875
The Gut Buster?

549
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,208
[Nando] Yeah, definitely!

550
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,666
Hey, it's $40.

551
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,291
Not if you finish it in under 30 minutes.
Then it's free.

552
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,666
- That is true.
- What's in the Gut Buster?

553
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,791
Ice cream!

554
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:27,500
[laughing]

555
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,083
- Oh boy. I wanted a cappuccino.
- Oh my God. Wow.

556
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,625
Are you ready for this?

557
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:32,892
- [Carlos] Okay.
- [Ellie] Yes!

558
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,796
[Nando] There's blueberries.
I love blueberries.

559
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:35,708
I want it.

560
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,916
So you must eat everything
inside the bowl and on the plate,

561
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,041
including ice cream, brownies,
waffle cones...

562
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:41,958
What is this?

563
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,541
Oh, just a standard contract.

564
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,083
And how many people
have lost their eyeballs?

565
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:47,000
[laughing]

566
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,083
You mean this month? Or all time?

567
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,041
[laughs]

568
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:51,958
He's a lawyer.

569
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,583
- Oh, is he?
- Yeah, I'm a lawyer.

570
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,166
- You have 30 minutes to finish this.
- [Carlos] Okay, ready.

571
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,208
I am looking forward to this.

572
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:01,791
Ready, set, go, go, go!

573
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,166
[bangs]

574
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,416
[workers cheering]

575
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
[ice cream employee speaking Korean]

576
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,083
[upbeat music playing]

577
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,083
Ellie, go! Ellie, keep eating.

578
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,416
[chuckling]

579
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:18,552
[employee] You guys are doing great,
but you have to pick up the pace.

580
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,250
It's a lot of ice cream.

581
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,000
[muffled shouting]

582
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,416
[cheering]

583
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,375
[employee] Let's go! Keep it moving!

584
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,833
- [in slow motion] Brain freeze!
- Help your brother.

585
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:44,458
The clown from your birthday party.
Snakes in the toilet. Summer school!

586
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,291
- Scaring's for hiccups.
- Hold his nose!

587
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,458
- Pull hard on your tongue!
- Also for hiccups!

588
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:57,791
[employee] Come on, family!

589
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,333
[cheering, whistling]

590
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,625
I can't do this anymore.
It's getting gross.

591
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,916
[scoffs] I'm gonna explode.

592
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,083
I'm full.

593
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,708
[crowd cheering, clapping]

594
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,291
Jeez, Dad.
You're like a human ice cream vacuum.

595
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:29,458
I saw him eat like this once
at a HomeTown Buffet when we were dating,

596
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,083
and I knew it would pay off.

597
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,000
I'll take your spoon.

598
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,041
Daddy! Daddy!

599
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,458
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

600
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,166
Daddy! Daddy!

601
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,791
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

602
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,916
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

603
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,916
Ten, nine,

604
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,958
eight, seven, six,

605
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:54,458
five, four, three, two, one!

606
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,000
[cheering]

607
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,833
[in Korean] Do you believe in miracles!

608
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,375
- [stomach rumbling]
- Are you feeling okay?

609
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,000
- [Allison] That was so beautiful.
- Is it coming up?

610
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,916
[stomach rumbling]

611
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:11,708
Uh, section 10 of the contract says
vomiting voids the win.

612
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:15,458
- Keep it down, babe. You can do it.
- Think of the family reputation.

613
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:16,625
Settle it right down.

614
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:19,500
Don't think of anything gross,
like beef sticks.

615
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,750
- [Allison] You can do it.
- It's up to you.

616
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:22,958
There's a bucket there.

617
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,916
- I'm good.
- He's fine. You got this.

618
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,916
You have to hold it. Ah.

619
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh.

620
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:33,250
Well, we're officially losers.

621
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,333
[Carlos] Oh, make it stop. [groans]

622
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:37,666
- I am sorry.
- Yeah, that doesn't sound good.

623
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,541
He didn't throw up! He didn't throw up!

624
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,208
It came out the other end!

625
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,458
[cheering]

626
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,041
You did it!

627
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,666
- [stomach rumbling]
- Okay, kids.

628
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,125
Look at your father. Look at this man.

629
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:56,333
He is going down as a Yes Day legend.

630
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:59,000
Yes, but no more food, please, not today.

631
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,541
Dad, it's gonna be super chill.

632
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,625
It's relaxing.

633
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:02,875
And sanitary.

634
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,666
What could be sanitary?

635
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,750
I don't know.

636
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,250
- Are we buying toilets?
- [laughs] Oh no.

637
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,916
Oh, now this is what I'm talking about.

638
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,958
A car wash is like being reborn.

639
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,125
This is exactly what I needed, kids.
Thank you.

640
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,291
- Yes.
- Yeah.

641
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah. This one's easy.

642
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,541
Hey, guys. One more thing.

643
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,583
- Windows down!
- What?

644
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,458
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
- What?

645
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,875
Well, you have to. It's Yes Day.

646
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,416
[gasps] What do we do?

647
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,666
I don't know. It's your car.

648
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:50,208
Come on, Mom. You can say it.
One word. Two letters. N-O.

649
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,916
Windows down!

650
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
[cheering]

651
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,458
[man] No, no, no, no, no!

652
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:01,583
[laughing]

653
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,041
[screaming]

654
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,166
[cheering]

655
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,916
Oh my God! [screams]

656
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,166
[screaming]

657
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,458
[screams]

658
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:15,791
Oh!

659
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,583
Mommy, your makeup!

660
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,750
[screaming]

661
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,041
Yes Day! Oh my gosh!

[banging]

663
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,458
Yes! Yes! Yes!

664
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,625
Yes Day!

665
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,541
I don't have to shower for a week!

666
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,208
You don't already!

667
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,208
[whirring]

668
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,583

[screaming]

671
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,833
- Will we make it through this day?
- They might be trying to kill us.

672
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:52,958
[both laughing]

673
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,583
Ew. Nando, you're...

674
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,625
- Ugh.
- Gross!

675
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,625
[Allison] An unexpected plus
of a windows-down car wash,

676
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,333
the mystery smell is finally gone.

677
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,333
I'd love to know where I'm driving.

678
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:10,291
Oh, sorry, Dad. The rules say
you're not allowed to know.

679
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,125
Stop asking so many questions.

680
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,416
Oh, and, guys, so, new activity,

681
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,083
new clothes.

682
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,708
Here you go, Katie.

683
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,583
And this is for Dad.

684
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,333
Are we starting a dance crew?

685
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,375
You wish we were starting a dance crew.

686
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,666
[birds chirping]

687
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,478
[Carlos] Seriously, what are we doing?

688
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,583
[indistinct chatter]

689
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,625
[Allison] Are those water balloons?

690
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,333
[Ellie] Kablowey!

691
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,736
- [Nando] Yeah!
- What's Kablowey?

692
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:41,750
It's capture the flag meets paintball
meets a butt ton of Kool-Aid.

693
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:45,375
A game Katie learned at camp. We played
once with the kids in the neighborhood.

694
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:48,750
[Katie] Yeah, Mom was the first one out.
It was so embarrassing.

695
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,583
[Nando]
Only true warriors survive Kablowey.

696
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:53,708
- It was a disaster.
- Oh, but not today. Today we'll Kablowey.

697
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,041
- Today we'll Kablowey.
- Yes!

698
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:58,250
[Allison] Where did you come up
with all of these people?

699
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:02,750
We told them there'd be a casting director
for a new, sexy, romantic reality show.

700
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,416
That's you, Mom.

701
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,958
Yeah,<i> Insatiable Island.</i>

702
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,041
[scoffs]

703
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,000
Come on, guys. Hey, guys!

704
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:14,041
[Allison]<i> Insatiable Island?</i> All right.
I'm in it to win it. Let's do this!

705
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,666
[Carlos] Hey.

706
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,958
Mr. Torres! You're on a Yes Day!

707
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,083
- Way to go!
- Yeah, yeah. What are you doing here?

708
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,875
Nando asked me to be here. Yeah.

709
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:25,875
- I'm gonna referee.
- You don't know anything about sports.

710
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:29,541
I don't know anything about sports,
but you can't say no on a Yes Day, right?

711
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,208
[chuckles] Okay, get in your spot.

712
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,625
[drums playing]

713
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,666
[Nando] Any of you jocks scared?

714
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,250
Well, you should be!

715
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:41,541
Anybody who wants to go home
to their mommy, now's your chance.

716
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:44,166
Sir?
Who should I give my headshot to, sir?

717
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:50,500
Sir, I was a runner-up season 12
on <i>The Bachelorette,</i> in case that helps.

718
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,375
I was, uh, season 9.

719
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,458
Season 13.

720
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,333
Whatever!

721
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:58,708
Each team has a color of flag to protect.
The goal is to catch the other team's flag

722
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,250
without getting hit
by their Kool-Aid balloons.

723
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,458
If you get Kablowey-ed, you're eliminated.

724
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,166
When one team has all the flags,
game's over.

725
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,458
Now, let's play some Kablowey!

726
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:09,666

- [all] What? What?

728
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,625
- [Allison] Break it down.
- [all] What?

729
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,541
Okay.

730
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,875

- [whistling]

732
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,750
That's enough of that.
That's a little awkward for everyone.

733
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,250
All right, guys, here we go.

734
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:28,166
Get your team's flag
and protect it like it's tots!

735
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,291
On the count of three,
I want you to charge!

736
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:32,708
Three, two...

737
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,416
Wait. No, I screwed that up. Sorry.

738
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,583
One, two...

739
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,208
- three!

742
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,166
Mom's our strongest enemy.

743
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,125
Let's go get her!

[screaming]

745
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,333
Don't worry about red.

746
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,625
My husband's on defense.

747
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:06,208
Don't worry about green. Katie's smart.
She's gonna go after her dad. Run!

748
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,708
Okay, guys. Okay, just...
Defense is the key. Okay?

749
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:12,375
Wait out here. Let them eliminate
each other. I know what I'm doing.

750
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:15,041
Go, go! Red team. Red team.
My dad's team first!

751
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,541
This is gonna be easy.

You in the headband, you're out!

The other headband. [whistles]

759
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,583
- Should we take a selfie?
- Yeah, sure.

760
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,833
- Sweet.
- Tag me on Insta, 'kay?

761
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:38,291
- One, two, three. <i>Insatiable Island!</i>
- Yeah!

[spatters]

763
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:45,875
Red team, what are you doing?
It's a bloodbath!

764
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,041
Half your team is eliminated!

765
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:51,625
Hold on. Change of strategy.
Run for your life. Billy, get out of here!

766
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,750
I love the smell
of Kool-Aid in the morning.

We're taking too many losses!

771

[whistles] You're out!

772
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:10,375
Too many casualties! Go back! Fall back!

773
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,500
Fall back, team!

774
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,250
New strategy.

775
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,250
Ma'am. Hi, my name's Eric.

776
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,916
- I'm here to make muscles, not friends.
- I'm more shredded. Check this out.

777
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,166
I have a very relatable body.
It's great for TV.

778
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,666
For TV. <i>Insatiable Island.</i>
Put your clothes on.

779
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,833
We're getting killed. I need that bag.

780
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,750
Load me up with ammo!

781
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,458
- Get her ammo!
- Bring it!

782
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:33,291
Blue, who wiped your bottoms
when you were babies?

783
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,625
- My mom!
- Our moms!

784
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:37,833
- Who tied your shoes when you were babies?
- Our moms!

785
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,458
Fight for your mom!

786

Oh.

You are going down!

[Katie] Oh, this is bad.

803
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,583
You wanted to make me a warrior?

804
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,458
I'm a warrior!

805
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:17,958
Listen, I think we need to team up
to take her out.

806
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:19,916
Deal.

807
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,125
Is that fair?

808

All's fair in love and Kablowey.

Go for it.

810
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:37,250
That was perfect. It's messing her up.

00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,958
- Yeah.
- Are you playing dirty, Nando?

Do you see which way she went?

- What?

Hey, Brian,
can I use your phone for a sec?

Sure.

We shipped the nano-cams?
We don't have clearance yet.

853
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,541
Tell Alan to issue a recall.

854
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,958
- [Ellie] Daddy?
- Honey.

855
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:01,708
- Were you talking on a phone?
- No. Phone? No, no.

856
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:06,625
I was just out here looking at...
Taking in the nature. I love nature.

857
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,333
- Well, it looked like you were.
- Nope, I wasn't.

858
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:10,250
[bird chirping]

859
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,791
- No.
- Daddy, do you hear that?

860
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,791
- What?
- It must be coming from that bush.

861
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,875
[chirping]

862
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,333
- [Carlos] Oh.
- [Ellie] Oh.

863
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,750
Oh, she fell out of her nest.

864
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,958
Yeah.

865
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:27,416
We have to put her back.

866
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,041
- What?
<i>- </i>I thought you loved nature.

867
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,041
Yeah, honey, but it's a very tall tree.

868
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,625
If you help the birdie, Daddy,

869
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:38,333
I won't tell anyone
I saw you talking on a phone.

870
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,791
Wait, wait. Ah. [grunts]

871
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,500
[Ellie] Come on, Daddy! Hurry up!

872
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,750
[groans]

873
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,166
[chirps]

874
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,750
- [chirps]
- [laughs]

875
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,791
Oh, they're a family again, honey.

876
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,833
Yay, Daddy!

877
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:06,291
It was actually a good idea, honey.
Thank you.

878
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:11,416
[screams] What's this?

879
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,583
She thinks you're stealing her babies!

880
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,541
We were just trying to help!

881
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,041
[screams, grunts]

882
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,541
Ah. Ah!

883
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,458
[yells]

884
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:24,041
Allison, baby!

885
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:26,416
Allison!

886
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,125
- [Ellie] Come down, Daddy!
- I'm coming down, honey!

887
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,708
[screams, groans]

888
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:31,708
[sighs]

889
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:34,125
Ooh. You okay, Daddy?

890
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,208
[grunts]

891
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,750
Yeah, honey.

892
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,583
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

893
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:42,625
[grunts]

894
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:43,666
I'm okay.

895
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,583
- [cawing]
- [screaming]

896
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,500
Oh my God! Stop!

897
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,166
Stop! Call your mom!

898
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,916
[Allison] Wow, that was amazing.
[chuckles]

899
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,875
See? I'm not always a fun killer.

900
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,500
Well, not today you aren't.

901
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:57,666
[scoffs]

902
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,291
Mom, there's no way
you'll make it through the day.

903
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:03,125
- I'm still saying yes, aren't I?
- [Carlos] Call 911!

904
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,500
[screaming]

905
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:07,000
- Allison!
- Is that Dad?

906
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,083
[Carlos screams]

907
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:08,958
Yup, that's him.

908
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,166
- [screaming]
- [cawing]

909
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,958
Your brother's taking you
to get dry ice, right?

910
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:17,125
We're good. By the way,
so many people are coming tonight.

911
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,541
It's gonna be awesome.

912
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,916
[Nando] <i>Fantastic.</i>

913
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,958
Are you sure you need
that much baking soda?

914
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah, it's a better catalyst.

915
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,666
Trust me. I'm an expert on catalysts now.

916
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,875
- Allison! Call 911!
- I'll have to call you right back.

917
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:31,083
[screams]

918
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:32,250
[groans]

919
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,000
[yells]

920
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,958
Call 911!

921
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,041
[siren blaring]

922
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,833
We need a doctor, stat!
There's been a horrific bird attack.

923
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:44,333
What? Do I have rabies?

924
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:48,458
No, this hospital sucks, so I exaggerated
a little to goose 'em. No pun intended.

925
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:51,375
- She's kidding. You're kidding, right?
- Sure.

926
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,541
Here's a waiting room.

927
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,125
- Katie, you are in charge.
<i>- </i>Okay.

928
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,833
Everybody stay with her,
so I can find you later.

929
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:59,375
- Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Stay. It's okay.

930
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,791
Okay, Mr. Torres, you can relax.

931
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:04,208
The scratches are superficial.
You'll be fine.

932
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:08,500
Oh good. So no concussion,
no rabies, no bruises? He's good to go?

933
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:09,416
He's in the clear.

934
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,583
- I'll send in a nurse to discharge you.
- Thank you.

935
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:15,250
- You're okay. That's great.
- Yeah.

936
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,666
I will get the kids,
and you take your time.

937
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:23,833
Honey, I hate to be a party pooper,
but my body's done.

938
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,750
Can we finish this another day, please?

939
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,208
Really?

940
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:29,916
Yeah.

941
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,833
Yeah, I guess if you're not feeling well,
of course we'll go home.

942
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,791
- Thank you.
- [Allison] Gosh.

943
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,250
Maybe I'll pop by the office,
then go home and crash.

944
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,250
- Sorry. What'd you say?
- Hm?

945
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,416
Maybe I'll pop by the office.

946
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,666
So you don't feel well enough
to finish this day for our family,

947
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,375
but you do feel well enough
to pop by the office.

948
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,625
It's a little crisis
that happened this morning.

949
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:58,625
Carlos, you want to cancel this day,
that's your choice,

950
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,041
but you're telling the kids.

951
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,375
[in Spanish]
It's your turn to be the bad guy.

952
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,416
Oh, Mrs. T. Hey, get this.

953
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,208
I told Karen I'd give her a Yes Day,
and she doesn't even want it.

954
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,208
We have an ambulance with a siren.

955
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,750
Think of the possibilities.

956
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,833
Grow up, Jean. Seriously.

957
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,500
How about you lighten up, Karen?

958
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,083
Take a chill pill.

959
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,083
Are you okay?

960
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:33,000
Yeah, I... I just got into a fight
with my husband.

961
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,166
Ah, and you want me to beat him up?

962
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,208
No, nothing like that.

963
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,541
[Jean] Give him a wedgie?

964
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:42,375
No, no. It's just that today was
the first day in, like, a year

965
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:45,125
where I felt like
we were really in it together.

966
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:48,291
- [Jean] Yeah.
- And then he just had to go and be a wuss.

967
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:49,291
Sounds like Karen.

968
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:53,416
She's mad because I took our life savings
and bought a fleet of ambulances.

969
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,458
I barely know how to drive this one.

970
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:57,416
But you can't force people to change.

971
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,125
You gotta do what works for you,

972
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:02,208
and he can either join the party,
or it's his loss. You know?

973
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,000
That's so true.

974
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,083
Oh.

975
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,041
Hey, guys.

976
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,958
Honey, can I talk to you for a second?

977
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:11,583
Yeah.

978
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,208
Look, I... I feel real bad.

979
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,125
I don't want to be the spoiler here.

980
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:21,208
Well, don't feel bad.
You are not the spoiler. You do you.

981
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,583
You can either come to this party or not.

982
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:24,666
Okay?

983
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:28,791
Hey guys, let me see what you got.
Big ask number four. Let me see.

984
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:32,250
Okay, number four. Putts N' Stuff.

985
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,333
That'd be very cool.
We'd have a great time.

986
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,375
But it does not compare

987
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,458
to Magic Mountain!

988
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:39,666
- What?
- Whoo!

989
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,791
[laughing]

990
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,958
But wait. What about the distance rule?

991
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,958
I've decided to make an exception.

992
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,250
And your dad has something
he wants to say.

993
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:51,291
Go ahead, Dad.

994
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,333
Well, guys, I'm feeling, um...

995
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,166
I'm... I'm feeling a little...

996
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,708
I'm feeling a little bit sick.

997
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,166
You're sick?

998
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,416
Are you going home?

999
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:12,625
I think I might be coming down
with Magic Mountain fever!

1000
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:14,291
Whoo!

1001
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,000
[Nando laughs]

1002
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,166
- But how are we gonna get there?
- Yeah.

1003
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:22,041
Because the SUV is at the Kablowey field,
and even with traffic, it'll take forever.

1004
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,458
Uh, duh. It's Yes Day!

1005
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:25,916
[siren blaring]

1006
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:30,541
Are we ready
for some roller coaster madness?

1007
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,166
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1008
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,041
Just so we're clear,
if an emergency comes in,

1009
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:37,458
I gotta leave you on the side of the road.

1010
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,833
[all] Whoa!

1011
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:41,125
- What if <i>we're </i>the emergency?
- Oh God.

1012
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,791
[chuckles] Good one.

1013
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:44,791
- [tires screeching]
- [siren blaring]

1014
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:47,250
[Jean] Oh boy. Hold on.

1015
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,833
All right, you guys can make fun of me
if you want, but I brought clean clothes.

1016
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,333
- Oh my gosh!
- Just in case!

1017
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:55,791
- Thank you so much, Mom.
- That is a nice mom.

1018
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,166
I know you hate when I dress you.
I took a stab.

1019
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,375
Beats smelling like Kool-Aid, so...

1020
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,708
[Jean] Whoa!

1021
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:03,458
It's Magic Mountain, baby!

1022
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,333
- Whoa!
- [screaming]

1023

00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,750
It was me. I won.

1194
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,333
- [Allison] Miss Cheetah?
<i>- </i>What?

1195
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:17,250
Can you tell her that I clearly won?
I was like a sniper.

1196
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,291
I <i>am </i>a freaking sniper, okay?

1197
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:23,250
- No, you are not. I won that gorilla!
- Honey!

1198
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:24,208
[Allison screams]

1199
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,708
- I'm staying out of this.
- [Carlos] It's not worth it!

1200
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,041
This is my gorilla!

1201
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,375
[woman 2]
You cheating suburban soccer mom!

1202
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:34,583
Hey! No, don't do this!
I got tickets here. Play again, okay?

1203
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:38,000
I shouldn't have to win it again.
You're a lawyer. You know about justice!

1204
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:39,791
- [thuds]
- [dings, rings]

1205
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:40,958
That's my wife!

1206
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,000
Get down!

1207
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,083
Security!

1208
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:45,791
[woman 2] You...

1209
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,916
No! Lady, please, no!

1210
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,500
Calm down! [grunts]

1211
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:55,166
Why does this keep happening to me? Honey.

1212
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,791
For my baby, give me the "golilla."

1213
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:00,750
If you are such a great mother,
then where are your kids?

1214
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,250
[grunts]

1215
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:06,000
No!

1216
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,208
Don't talk to me about my kids!

1217
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,416
Let go, lady!

1218
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,559
- Carlos, get this "golilla" for me!
- [Carlos] Let go!

1219
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:12,625
Is that all you got?

1220
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:13,833
It's for my baby!

1221
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:14,833
[thudding]

1222
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:16,208
[crowd groaning]

1223
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:19,875
- Where is that woman? Where is the...
- No, honey, stop! No, you...

1224
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,083
[siren blaring]

1225
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,416
[tires screeching]

1226
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
- Who's watching our kids?
- I love the law. It's why I'm a lawyer.

1227
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,351
- [officer] Profile.
- Ellie usually has a snack around now.

1228
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:31,309
- [officer] Thumb.
- But there are laws, and <i>laws.</i>

1229
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,625
- Ma'am?
- There are organic smoothies in my bag.

1230
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,250
- Stand still, please.
- Oh.

1231
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,250
[shutter clicking]

1232
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:38,875
- Can I do that again?
- Chin up.

1233
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:40,375
Go ahead, Antonio.

1234
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:42,208
[shutter clicking]

1235
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:46,333
I put the picture of the bad guy
right here so that I will find you.

1236
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:48,791
- Whatever you look like.
- Can you make him bald?

1237
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,208
Oh, I don't know. Can I

1238
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
make him bald? You know what I'm saying?

1239
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:54,125
He looks like you.

1240
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:55,333
Wait, what?

1241
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,250
I want a beard.

1242
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,458
Me too, you know?

1243
00:53:57,541 --> 00:54:00,583
Oh, you mean... Oh, yes.
Sorry. I should've known. Uh...

1244
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:02,666
Let's see. [chuckles]

1245
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,184
- Nice soul patch, brother. Snap it. Okay?
- [Nando] Thank you.

1246
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,333
Do you have mohawks?

1247
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:07,851
- [officer] I do.
- Give him a mohawk.

1248
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,666
[officer] Okay, wait. Uh, ha, ha!

1249
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,375
Can you make him a pirate?

1250
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:13,458
Oh, that's too elaborate, you know?

1251
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,625
It would take a really awesome officer to...

1252
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:16,916
- Uh-oh.
- [Ellie] Whoa!

1253
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
[officer] Captain Poopypants right here.

1254
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:20,583
Pirate Town. Pirate Town.

1255
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:22,625
I mean, it <i>was </i>your gorilla, honey.

1256
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,250
- Thank you. It <i>was </i>my gorilla.
<i>- </i>Yes.

1257
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,958
I hope you're happy, ya cheater.

1258
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:28,541
[growls]

1259
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:29,583
[inhales]

1260
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,708
You know what, honey? I don't think
you're mad about the gorilla.

1261
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:33,791
Really?

1262
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:35,666
Watching you with Katie...

1263
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,416
You're amazing.

1264
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,666
Hm.

1265
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,000
That's being a parent.

1266
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:46,083
All I've done is
force you to do the hard stuff, right?

1267
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,250
You don't need help from a Yes Day.

1268
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,208
What you need is a partner.

1269
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,166
That's what I'll be from now on,

1270
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:57,833
your partner.

1271
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,375
[in Spanish] I love you, my love.

1272
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:04,416
[in Spanish] Me too, my love. So much.

1273
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:09,166
[gags]

1274
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:11,416
[gags]

1275
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,666
[in English] Come on. Hey! Good news.
We're getting out of your hair.

1276
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:18,291
- Nana and Pop-Pop came to take us home.
- Those are cute nicknames.

1277
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:22,208
And really quickly,
I just wanted to say how sorry I am

1278
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:25,791
that you had to meet our parents this way.
They really are good people,

1279
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:26,875
just bad judgment.

1280
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,958
Oh, it's not your fault. You hear me?

1281
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,250
Where is Nana and Pop-Pop?

1282
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:32,166
What?

1283
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,000
So where is Nana and Pop-Pop?

1284
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:37,458
They're waiting in the car.
Yeah, they're waiting in the car.

1285
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,166
Our Pop-Pop's sciatica...

1286
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,041
really bad flareup.

1287
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:44,708
Oh <i>Dios mío, </i>no. Oh my God.
That sounds terrible. I am so sorry.

1288
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:47,791
- He's brave. Don't make him wait.
- We're gonna go. Thank you.

1289
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:49,958
I will sign you guys out. Best of luck.

1290
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:51,416
[Katie] Thank you. Bye.

1291
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,458
I'll be lonely without you,
but don't worry.

1292
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:54,916
I have other friends.

1293
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:58,875
Hey, Julie.

1294
00:55:58,958 --> 00:55:59,833
Hey.

1295
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:03,041
Dude, I cannot believe
your parents are in jail.

1296
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,125
It's crazy, right?

1297
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:06,750
Are we really just gonna
leave Mom and Dad?

1298
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,458
It's not our fault
they got put in the clink on our Yes Day.

1299
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:13,041
But we're not supposed
to get rides from strangers.

1300
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,125
Okay, well, you guys know Layla,

1301
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:17,125
and Julie is Layla's cousin.

1302
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,541
I mean, look, they even put in a car seat.

1303
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:22,166
Think of the upside to this.

1304
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,750
Now your big main event
can be even bigger.

1305
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,375
[indistinct chatter]

1306
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,333
- Awesome.
- What is this?

1307
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:36,458
What's with all the tubes and buckets?

1308
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:39,333
- It's just a nerd party. Hey, guys!
- [kids chanting] Nando!

1309
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:42,250
I feel like this is something
that we should have talked...

1310
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:45,083
[Nando] Hey, wait up!
Let's get the party started!

1311
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,291
[cheering]

1312
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,708
[upbeat music playing]

1313
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,500
[laughing]

1314
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,875
[gasps] You look pretty!

1315
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,500
Thanks, Ellie.

1316
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:11,250
[sighs] I can't go.

1317
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:12,333
What?

1318
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:13,416
I can't go.

1319
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:16,625
I'm sorry. I can't leave them.
What if something happens?

1320
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,708
I'm the oldest. It's my responsibility.

1321
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:22,166
But you've wanted
to go to this concert forever.

1322
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:25,416
And we're gonna be fine.
We won't make poor decisions. Promise.

1323
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,916
Promise to text me if something happens?

1324
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,833
Absolutely.

1325
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:33,083
Come on, Katie.
The guys are already there.

1326
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,250
[sighs]

1327
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:42,208
Okay. Okay.

1328
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,416
Be safe, please.

1329
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:46,875
- [Allison] Are the kids okay?
- [officer] Yes.

1330
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:48,708
And I have some phenomenal news.

1331
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:50,250
The park's not pressing charges.

1332
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,333
- Thank God.
- Yes!

1333
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:55,250
They looked at some security footage,
and it turns out you did win the gorilla.

1334
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:58,625
I knew it.
I knew I won this gorilla. I knew I...

1335
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,708
[Carlos] Okay.

1336
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:01,416
[exhales deeply]

1337
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,125
- Does she get to go too?
- [officer] In a little bit.

1338
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:06,208
Oh.

1339
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,125
Oh gosh. Here, you have it.

1340
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:10,458
You take the "golilla."

1341
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:12,541
You won it fair and square.

1342
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,517
- Thank you.
- [officer] Let's go.

1343
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:15,541
Let's go.

1344
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,000
- Katie?
<i>- </i>[Carlos] Nando?

1345
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:21,666
Ellie? Where are our kids?

1346
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,500
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Nana and Pop-Pop picked them up.

1347
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,666
Nana and Pop-Pop live in Pittsburgh.

1348
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,791
But they're here on vacation?

1349
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:33,166
- No, they're not.
- You let our children leave by themselves?

1350
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,708
You see, when you say it out loud,
I... I realize that it was a mistake.

1351
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:37,625
- [gasps]
- Oh no.

1352
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:39,250
[upbeat music playing]

1353
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:40,833
[indistinct chatter]

1354
00:58:44,166 --> 00:58:46,583
Can you believe this?

1355
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:50,166
We are actually pulling it off.
I'm gonna go check on the big surprise.

1356
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,333
Yeah. Okay. I'll see you over there, man.

1357
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:03,000
Who's ready to make some science miracles?

1358
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,541
[kids cheering]

1359
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,291
- Name?
<i>- </i>Hailey Peterson.

1360
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:08,875
