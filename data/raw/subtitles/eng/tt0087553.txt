1
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,140
Cambodia.

2
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,945
To many Westerners,
it seemed a paradise.

3
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:40,173
Another world, a secret world.

4
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:44,243
But the war in neighboring
Vietnam burst its borders...

5
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:47,817
...and the fighting soon spread
to neutral Cambodia.

6
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:51,789
In 1973, I went to cover
this sideshow struggle...

7
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:54,955
...as foreign correspondent
of The New York Times.

8
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:57,969
It was there, amidst the fighting...

9
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:01,359
...between government troops
and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...

10
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:05,002
...that I met my guide
and interpreter, Dith Pran...

11
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:08,074
...a man who was to change my life...

12
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,120
...in a country that I grew to love
and pity.

13
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:22,639
So here we go
with Voice of America...

14
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,745
...news for Southeast Asia.

15
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:28,904
It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy
morning here.

16
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:31,275
Clouds too in Washington.

17
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:35,084
President Nixon announced he'll
address the nation on Watergate...

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,070
...within the next few days.

19
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,784
The speech will be Nixon's
first since May.

20
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:45,414
The scandal has caused resignations
and paralyzed the White House staff.

21
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:49,065
It has also led to intense
confrontation and perhaps...

22
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:52,014
...a constitutional crisis
with Senate investigators...

23
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,727
...and a special
Watergate prosecutor.

24
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:58,157
The speech was announced
after the Gallup Poll disclosed...

25
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:02,060
...that Mr. Nixon's popularity
had fallen to the lowest point...

26
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,940
...for an American President
in 20 years.

27
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,917
A Supreme Court judge,
William O. Douglas...

28
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:21,963
...has ruled against an appeal
by the Administration...

29
00:02:22,157 --> 00:02:23,749
...for a stay of the injunction...

30
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:27,297
...on further U.S. Bombing
missions in Cambodia.

31
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,370
Congress has already ruled
these bombings illegal...

32
00:02:30,573 --> 00:02:34,664
...and they should cease in one
week's time on August the 15th.

33
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:57,151
Let's go, Sarun!
To the hospital!

34
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:17,377
Information. Information.

35
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:22,312
Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival
of flight number 125...

36
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:25,985
...from Bangkok because
of bad weather.

37
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:48,575
Mister, you want taxi?

38
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:50,945
Mister, you want taxi?
Good taxi.

39
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,284
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?

40
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,106
What's all this shit?

41
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,368
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,369
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.

43
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,265
If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.
I'm not feeling good.

44
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,802
Don't want to yell.
I want to be in a good mood.

45
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:43,809
The plane was late, no car.
I had to take a taxi here.

46
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:46,272
All I want to do is work.
I got you.

47
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:58,078
What the fuck is that on your head?

48
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:03,827
It's a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.

49
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:07,963
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?

50
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,800
No, I just came from the airport.

51
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:15,572
Well, if he comes in,
would you tell him I'm here?

52
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:18,293
I'll be at the Café Central, tell him.

53
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:19,699
Thanks a lot.

54
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:37,973
What do you want to eat?

55
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:40,826
Want some eggs?

56
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,402
I can't. Somebody told me they faint
with fright when you cook them.

57
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:46,742
- What do you want to eat?
- What are you having?

58
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,436
I'm having a café complet.

59
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:51,322
I'll have that. And some aspirin.

60
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:02,165
Anything I eat has got to be
absolutely dead.

61
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:04,183
That's why I can never eat an oyster.

62
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:07,578
I read somewhere that they put...

63
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,300
...that lemon juice on them
just to stun them. You know?

64
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,611
What's the difference?

65
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:20,281
An unconscious oyster's just as
horrible as the fucker wide awake...

66
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,310
- My God! Look at this.
- Did you see that?

67
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:37,781
What was it? A rocket?

68
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:40,563
I don't know.
I saw a guy on a motorbike.

69
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,457
I've been looking for you.

70
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,144
I left a message for you.

71
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,283
I didn't get it. I took a cab.

72
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:57,302
- There is a big accident right now.
- What?

73
00:06:57,495 --> 00:07:00,726
I think U.S. Drop many big bombs
on little city.

74
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:04,108
- U.S. Bombs? You're sure?
- I think many dead.

75
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,698
- Does anybody else know about it?
- Nothing at all.

76
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,651
We're going.

77
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:11,307
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.

78
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:40,240
Where you going, Schanberg?

79
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:43,122
Neak Luong.

80
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:44,525
Neak Luong's closed.

81
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:48,335
Don't give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.

82
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,880
I got a right to go wherever I like
in this sad little country.

83
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:56,784
That's the law. You impede me, you're
breaking the Cooper/Church Amendment!

84
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:59,729
Well, up the Cooper/Church
Amendment's ass!

85
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:03,305
Let's go!

86
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,815
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?

87
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm looking for information on why
my airplane was delayed this morning.

88
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,785
- Your plane was delayed?
- That's right.

89
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:31,148
I don't know. Maybe it's
bad weather. Your flight's...

90
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,317
You don't know anything about it?

91
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,045
No, I don't.

92
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:36,451
All right.

93
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:40,612
Then I'd like you
to listen to something...

94
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:42,758
...and then I'd like a comment.

95
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,663
This morning, for reasons beyond
anybody's control...

96
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,792
...I spend two hours in Bangkok
staring at a seat belt sign.

97
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,485
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...

98
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:56,329
...two Army helicopters are landing
here, just across the airfield.

99
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,008
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh
are waiting there to meet them.

100
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:04,389
And now there's a rumor that
the U.S. Air Force dropped a bomb...

101
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:06,410
...or several bombs, on Neak Luong.

102
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:09,638
That's a rumor, and I'm not gonna
comment on a rumor.

103
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:13,731
I just want to know if that's the
reason why my airplane was delayed!

104
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,380
No comment.

105
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,423
How many killed?

106
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:24,615
How many wounded?

107
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:32,580
Thank you for your cooperation,
Major Reeves.

108
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:38,822
When I scrape this story out, I will
no doubt be quoting you in full!

109
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:21,022
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:23,461
This is just not good enough.

111
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:25,564
This is a big story...

112
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:29,825
...a major story, you understand that?
We've got to get down there!

113
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:32,030
- I know, but...
- I don't want to hear "no"!

114
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,140
I want to get down that river!

115
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,002
We should be down there now!

116
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,152
I'll be here.

117
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,051
Good night, Sydney.

118
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:03,484
- Messages?
- No, sir.

119
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:04,952
No, sir.

120
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:10,015
I'd talk, but it's been
a heavy day and I've got to go.

121
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,579
Let's get together again soon, okay?

122
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:14,079
- Bob?
- See you.

123
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:15,458
Bob?

124
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:18,423
Hello, Sydney. Good night, Sydney.

125
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:21,693
- Listen, I can't talk with you.
- You can talk to me.

126
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:24,738
The embassy is jittery.
Get information from a press officer.

127
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,134
Let's not start insulting each other.

128
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:30,903
Good night, Sydney.

129
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:33,184
All right, good night.

130
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,222
You've heard of pilot error?

131
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:41,845
Computer malfunction?

132
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:44,094
They screwed up on the coordinates.

133
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,901
A single B-52 dropped
its entire load on Neak Luong.

134
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:52,156
There's a homing beacon
in the middle of the town.

135
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,605
- Casualties?
- You'll be briefed tomorrow.

136
00:11:55,805 --> 00:12:00,315
We estimate 55 military,
something like 35 civilians.

137
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:02,872
How many?

138
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,867
I hear it's in the hundreds.
Don't quote me on that.

139
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:11,194
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath

140
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,359
When the Khmer Rouge hit the town?

141
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,399
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath...?

142
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:22,101
Beer! We haven't had this
for four weeks.

143
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,315
New York Times probably
had it flown in.

144
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:28,155
- They keep it in their suite.
- We got a cellar. Don't you know?

145
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,716
Americans take themselves so seriously.

146
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:35,514
Don't be hard on the man. He's just
trying to get to the top of the heap.

147
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,155
We'll just have to pay more to get
our telexes to the top of the heap.

148
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:41,778
The man has just bought you a beer.
Now drink up.

149
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,993
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Syd.

150
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:45,104
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?

151
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,609
- New York Times goes to bed early.
- Sure!

152
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:51,925
Khmer Rouge in the sunset

153
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,609
The Yanks all at sea...

154
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,297
- All right?
- Very possible.

155
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:03,832
Let's go then!

156
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:12,940
This is good work.

157
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:49,581
- How much?
- Hundred fifty.

158
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:57,577
One hundred!

159
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,787
- All right?
- All right.

160
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:13,935
Nice going, Pran.

161
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,840
- What is he saying?
- He wants you to look at his family.

162
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:17,294
To take a photograph and help him
because his child was wounded.

163
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,740
Tell me what she's saying.

164
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:48,385
She needs help.

165
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:54,695
Her shop was destroyed last night.

166
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:57,229
Her husband killed.

167
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:58,596
How many bombs?

168
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,672
She doesn't know.

169
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:04,674
Does she know where the hospital is?

170
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,656
"Just over there."

171
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,845
She wants to know,
"Did someone arrest the pilot?"

172
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,060
Mister, you wanna buy?
Mister, you wanna buy?

173
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:24,517
- One dollar? You wanna buy?
- I'm out of film. I'm sorry.

174
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:28,486
Ask her how many kids she's got
in her family.

175
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:30,533
"Five."

176
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:33,319
Her husband was killed already.

177
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,659
What's this?

178
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:40,804
What are these guys over here?

179
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:48,710
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.

180
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:12,796
They kill a lot of villagers.

181
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,613
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags
in gasoline...

182
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:17,754
...and push them down
villagers' throat...

183
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:19,865
...then set the rags alight.

184
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,213
Film! No film!

185
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:22,841
I know there's no film.

186
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:24,124
No camera!

187
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:26,364
No camera!

188
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:27,837
It's all right.

189
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:32,067
Just take it easy.

190
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:39,292
Tell them we're jour...

191
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:49,922
Come on! Get in!

192
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,846
I'm worried.

193
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:37,534
I'm the guy who bring you over here.

194
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:40,410
They accuse me and they arrest me.

195
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:43,348
How can they arrest you?
You're already arrested.

196
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,707
They phone Phnom Penh about me.

197
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,109
I want some cigarettes.

198
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:00,601
And I need to take a leak.

199
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,552
Would you tell them I need to piss?

200
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:30,160
He said, "No piss."

201
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,012
What does that mean?

202
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:35,319
That's no piss.

203
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:41,782
I've had enough of this bullshit.

204
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,336
I got a story to get to New York!

205
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:50,611
Don't leave me!

206
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:02,261
I won't leave you.

207
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:10,575
They brought in the whole press corps!

208
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,969
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!

209
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,027
I am going to tell you something.

210
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,850
I'm walking out of here.

211
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,285
What are you gonna do?
Blow my head off?

212
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:33,414
You got a general out there,
this is an American passport...

213
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:35,471
...and I am walking out of here!

214
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:41,259
- He wants to get higher officer.
- Then get him! Get him!

215
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:53,286
I'm sorry we couldn't show you the
minor bomb damage in the city itself.

216
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:55,209
It's still a restricted area.

217
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:57,578
Now, if you look across the river...

218
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,588
...you'll see positions held by
Khmer Rouge...

219
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:02,506
...who moved in over
the past few days.

220
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:05,800
But the Cambodian Republican Army
is moving in on them.

221
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:09,348
They'll have the K.R. Out
before you can say "Jack Robinson."

222
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:11,849
Get in the chopper now!

223
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:15,458
No, Schanberg! You came on a boat,
you go back on a boat!

224
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:17,765
That won't stop my story!

225
00:22:20,397 --> 00:22:21,290
What is this?

226
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:24,386
If you weren't down here,
I wouldn't be down here.

227
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:27,371
And I don't want to be down here!
What good is it doing?

228
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:29,321
If anybody ever reads about this...

229
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:32,102
...you won't be able to look them
in the face!

230
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:11,777
Good morning.

231
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:13,534
What time is it?

232
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:16,894
Six o'clock.

233
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,141
Shit.

234
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:20,514
Telex for you.

235
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:22,536
You been to the telex?

236
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,149
We made the front page.

237
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:27,272
Sure.

238
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:31,264
We must be doing something right.

239
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,406
My wife is very worried.

240
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:45,470
She thinks all foreign journalists
are going to leave Cambodia.

241
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,291
Well, Pran...

242
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:53,669
...l'd feel kind of stupid trying to
cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.

243
00:23:55,046 --> 00:23:58,010
And she said if the war
keeps going like this...

244
00:23:58,211 --> 00:24:00,284
...the future could be very bad.

245
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:03,328
What do you think?

246
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:07,553
I don't know.

247
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:11,266
I don't know either.

248
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,813
- Is Sarun downstairs?
- Sure.

249
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,340
Let's get going.

250
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,198
All right.

251
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,454
Don't go back to sleep.

252
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:28,697
I won't.

253
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:39,454
K.R.'s making a push
for the airport road.

254
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,593
If they cut it,
the city could be lost.

255
00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:45,092
We hype these people up. "You'll be
all right with us," we say.

256
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:47,451
Now look at all this fucking mess!

257
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,467
In America, everybody got a good car.

258
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:01,887
He ask you what car you drive
in United States.

259
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,015
I don't have a car in America,
only the Mercedes here.

260
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:07,321
Mercedes, number one!

261
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,262
Ask him where he learned
to speak his English.

262
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:15,484
American advisor with his unit
teach him.

263
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,653
Mercedes, number one, okay?

264
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:55,378
What did he say?

265
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,483
He said he thought all
American people left already.

266
00:25:59,103 --> 00:26:00,955
Made in the USA.

267
00:26:04,315 --> 00:26:05,296
Are we winning?

268
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:08,178
No, you're not winning.

269
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:09,656
What should we do?

270
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:12,948
Well, you make sure they don't
cut off the airport road.

271
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:18,038
The first section came
by Route number 36.

272
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:22,227
And the second one
came down by Route number 26.

273
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:24,817
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.

274
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:26,617
He doesn't know how many.

275
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,718
They expect an attack today.

276
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,349
- Where's your commander?
- Phnom Penh.

277
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:31,895
- Why there?
- Don't know.

278
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,943
How many mortar rounds you have...?

279
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:51,217
Rockoff, get your ass out here!
Get out here!

280
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,921
Come on, let's get him out of here!

281
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:23,761
- Fuck this!
- They pulling out?

282
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:25,811
I'm not happy here, Syd.

283
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:27,827
Jon, I'm leaving.

284
00:27:28,086 --> 00:27:29,581
Syd, come on!

285
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:30,856
Come on!

286
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,299
Sydney, this way!

287
00:28:05,746 --> 00:28:07,467
Sydney, look! Khmer Rouge!

288
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:57,834
In Washington, the
Cambodian ambassador...

289
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,809
...in a speech to
the Washington Press Club said:

290
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,787
"Let's face it, you took
advantage of us."

291
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:04,841
I can't eat.

292
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:09,673
"You are cleverer than we are, and
you induced us into this fighting."

293
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,316
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge
insurgents in Cambodia...

294
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,551
...have tightened their ring
around the capital, Phnom Penh...

295
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,198
...now swollen with some two million
refugees from the fighting.

296
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:24,455
Reports from government troops talk
of the field situation being so bad...

297
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,847
...that soldiers are having
to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...

298
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:31,842
...in order to be able to get
the wounded back to the capital.

299
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,962
No more electricity.

300
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:27,390
And now I get a message
to try for negotiations.

301
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,479
Well, it's just too goddamn late!

302
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:31,908
Alan, this country's split apart.

303
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:35,747
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks
my heart not to help it back to port.

304
00:30:35,942 --> 00:30:36,990
Any port.

305
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:41,761
What pisses me off is, this country
has faults and strengths...

306
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:45,371
...and we have done nothing
but play to the faults.

307
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,842
I tell you, I will be damn
glad to get out of here.

308
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:55,583
This thing has dragged on too long for
it to end in all sweetness and light.

309
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:57,952
After what the Khmer Rouge
have been through...

310
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:00,996
...they won't be exactly
affectionate toward Westerners.

311
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,858
- Where do you want this?
- On the floor. Anywhere.

312
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:09,499
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.

313
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:10,910
Dith Pran and family.

314
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:12,089
Right.

315
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:18,017
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning
a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...

316
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:22,750
...and anticipate two weeks
in Cambodia touring the country.

317
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:26,560
Would you please send tour
information and brochures?

318
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:28,956
Thanking you in advance,
Wendell Payne."

319
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:31,932
Wendell lives in Wisacky,
South Carolina.

320
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:34,169
What about the airlift?

321
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,864
We're taking it with us.

322
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:39,903
- People will starve to death.
- I know, but what can we do?

323
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:42,366
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.

324
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:47,229
Excuse the pun, but we're
either staying or we're living.

325
00:31:58,238 --> 00:32:01,556
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then,
are we, Carver?

326
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:10,621
President Ford, in his foreign policy
speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...

327
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:14,589
...except to say that, as of now,
it may be too late.

328
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:30,867
I'm sorry. I'm late.

329
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:32,278
Where you been?

330
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:35,222
- They stop me because of the curfew.
- The curfew, huh?

331
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,981
Yes. I'm sorry.

332
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:42,734
Get started on this.
Tell them to start sending this out...

333
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:46,486
...but hold the last two paragraphs.
I'll have corrections in an hour.

334
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:51,506
They don't transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.

335
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:55,382
They say 6 p.m. We can file.

336
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:56,952
6 p.m.

337
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:01,753
What do you think this is?
A monthly magazine?

338
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,856
This is a newspaper.

339
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:08,371
How about update tomorrow?

340
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,782
Yeah, sure. We can file
an update tomorrow.

341
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:25,175
I was over at the
American Embassy yesterday.

342
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:27,190
Good news?

343
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:29,110
No, not good news.

344
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:37,490
They say that when
this place goes up...

345
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,208
...they think a lot of people
will be killed. A lot of people.

346
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,913
I've arranged for the evacuation
of you and your family.

347
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:53,974
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?

348
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,314
Do you want to stay
or leave?

349
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:07,657
And how about you?

350
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:10,610
That's none of your business.

351
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:18,929
Do you want to stay,
or do you want to leave?

352
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:23,500
I know.

353
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:25,803
You love my family.

354
00:34:29,908 --> 00:34:32,689
But me, I'm reporter too.

355
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,793
You know what I mean?

356
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,872
All right, we don't have
to decide this right now.

357
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:54,381
Take it easy.

358
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:02,184
But we'll have to make up our
minds pretty soon, right?

359
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:14,693
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?

360
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:17,540
This is the last check.

361
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:22,754
Last check. This is the last check!

362
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:30,525
Mr. Kincaid is not here.

363
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:33,760
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
You keep Mr. Kincaid's money.

364
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:35,908
Now, I want you to go right now!

365
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,855
I want you to leave now!

366
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:40,064
You won't see Mr. Kincaid again!

367
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:55,071
Okay, sergeant, let him in!

368
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,284
Have you got Pran here?
Have you got Pran on there?

369
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:04,001
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.

370
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:07,297
- Did they come in yet?
- No, sir, they haven't arrived yet.

371
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:21,632
Have you seen Pran?

372
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:22,777
No, I haven't.

373
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:24,507
Where is he?

374
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:30,079
Well, it's been real.

375
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:36,794
They're gonna miss it.

376
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,963
Why don't you check around
the other side?

377
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:43,513
If he comes here, I'm looking
for him in the back.

378
00:37:55,137 --> 00:37:57,471
Beth! Have you seen Pran?

379
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,772
No, have you looked at the hotel?

380
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:01,759
He's at the post office!

381
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,673
The post office!

382
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,338
Get the fuck out!
Get out of here now!

383
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,703
Move your asses out of here!

384
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,566
Hold those doors!

385
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:44,190
- Where do you think you're going?
- To embassy.

386
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,850
Yes, sir, what's your name?

387
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:02,362
Dith Pran family, sir.

388
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:04,247
Dith Pran family?

389
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:06,681
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They've been through.

390
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:09,522
- They've been through.
- Check one more time, please.

391
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,897
- You made a mistake, sir.
- No mistake.

392
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:21,404
Rockoff, help me!

393
00:41:28,306 --> 00:41:29,101
Run!

394
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,982
There's no time!

395
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,677
Wait a minute.

396
00:42:41,229 --> 00:42:42,210
Smile.

397
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:09,055
Jon.

398
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:10,656
Hello, Sydney.

399
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,112
If the going gets rough, I heard
our best bet's the French Embassy.

400
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:35,011
Who told you that?

401
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:39,521
The British Embassy.

402
00:44:08,773 --> 00:44:10,365
Khmer Rouge coming.

403
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,600
Look like government soldiers
give them big welcome.

404
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,637
No more fighting!

405
00:45:16,992 --> 00:45:18,267
I be right back!

406
00:45:33,758 --> 00:45:35,516
No more fighting! No more war!

407
00:45:35,935 --> 00:45:37,210
What do you think?

408
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,926
I don't like the look of this.

409
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:44,632
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.

410
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:47,643
I just don't think these guys
are for real.

411
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:50,968
I'm going to the hospital.
You want to come with me?

412
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,910
Tetracaine, 50 milligrams, please.

413
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,329
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?

414
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:03,797
Pentothal, 150 milligrams, quick.

415
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:17,840
Jesus, another shrapnel
in the spine here.

416
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,662
Okay, let's have her over.

417
00:47:25,237 --> 00:47:29,644
This is blood group A. We've had one
unit of blood in the last two days.

418
00:47:30,516 --> 00:47:32,459
Plasma substitute, please, quick.

419
00:47:33,334 --> 00:47:35,822
We've plenty of blood, gentlemen.
Plenty of blood.

420
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,509
The problem is, it's all in
the wrong fucking place.

421
00:47:41,237 --> 00:47:45,228
Why do corpses have to pile up before
people decide it's time to go home?

422
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:14,344
For God's sake, back up the car!
Sarun, back it up!

423
00:48:14,545 --> 00:48:16,880
For God's sake, back it up now!

424
00:49:29,515 --> 00:49:32,898
- Why doesn't he get his ass in here?
- He's trying to get in!

425
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,630
They won't let him in.

426
00:49:57,257 --> 00:49:58,336
All right?

427
00:56:01,678 --> 00:56:02,569
Okay?

428
00:56:02,763 --> 00:56:03,909
Looks all right.

429
00:58:56,927 --> 00:58:57,940
I'm coming!

430
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:07,475
Just a minute! He's with me!

431
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:09,497
He's with The New York Times!

432
00:59:09,694 --> 00:59:12,760
Wait just a minute!
He's a journalist and he's with me!

433
00:59:13,311 --> 00:59:16,572
Where is the consul? I want to talk
to the consul. Let me see him!

434
00:59:16,829 --> 00:59:19,382
You tell me where he is.
I want to speak to him!

435
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:23,992
The picture in Cambodia
is increasingly unclear.

436
00:59:24,188 --> 00:59:27,451
Journalists who have flown
from Thailand over Phnom Penh...

437
00:59:27,643 --> 00:59:30,196
...report that the Khmer Rouge
have attempted...

438
00:59:30,395 --> 00:59:33,396
...a mass evacuation
of the entire population.

439
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:37,970
Radio contact with the French Embassy
reveals that some 200 Europeans...

440
00:59:38,171 --> 00:59:42,296
...and an undisclosed number
of Cambodians have taken refuge.

441
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:46,454
As yet, no statement has been made
by the new rulers of Cambodia.

442
00:59:46,653 --> 00:59:51,024
The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk
and the Khmer Rouge leadership...

443
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:52,631
...are not clear.

444
00:59:58,297 --> 01:00:00,630
- Okay?
- Yes. He's sleeping.

445
01:00:25,366 --> 01:00:26,195
That's the consul.

446
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:37,908
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.

447
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:45,585
Look, piss off! Please!

448
01:00:45,781 --> 01:00:48,782
Get out! You won't get
anything here! Out!

449
01:00:56,214 --> 01:00:58,124
First, the main points of the news.

450
01:00:58,325 --> 01:00:59,786
BBC, Dougal.

451
01:01:02,419 --> 01:01:05,137
- Daily reports of fighting
around the airport...

452
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:09,009
...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh,
the capital of Cambodia.

453
01:01:09,908 --> 01:01:13,682
And now, an on-the-spot report
from our correspondent in Thailand...

454
01:01:13,877 --> 01:01:14,890
...Hugh Elder.

455
01:01:16,755 --> 01:01:18,796
Where do they get this crap?

456
01:01:19,315 --> 01:01:22,315
Do you see that guy across the gate?
The little guy?

457
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,800
Could we not all look at once, please?

458
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:29,991
I have it on reliable sources
that that's Hugh Elder.

459
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:31,501
You're kidding.

460
01:01:31,696 --> 01:01:35,014
He's disguised, but I got suspicious
about him. You know what I mean?

461
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:38,064
- How does he get copy out?
- How does he get his copy out?

462
01:01:38,258 --> 01:01:39,916
With specially trained hens.

463
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:45,197
The BBC has, like, commissioned
them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...

464
01:01:45,393 --> 01:01:47,084
...like their regular fowl.

465
01:01:47,282 --> 01:01:51,625
They've been crossing the border into
Thailand every day and every night.

466
01:01:52,655 --> 01:01:53,671
I told you.

467
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:57,643
Unconfirmed reports say
the Khmer Rouge are demanding...

468
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,319
...that any officials of
the defeated Lon Nol government...

469
01:02:01,522 --> 01:02:04,487
...especially the so-called
Six Traitors of the Cabinet...

470
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:06,248
...be handed over to them.

471
01:02:06,448 --> 01:02:09,066
It is not known whether
any of the ex-ministers...

472
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:11,270
...may have taken refuge
in the embassy...

473
01:02:11,473 --> 01:02:14,767
...where, in the words of a UNICEF
representative in Bangkok...

474
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,733
...the situation is said to be
"increasingly precarious."

475
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:48,018
And when I tried to go
just a kilometer further, no.

476
01:03:48,217 --> 01:03:50,738
The only sense I can make of it
is that there's...

477
01:03:50,938 --> 01:03:53,754
...some sort of internal
power struggle going on.

478
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:57,556
Different groups seem to be
holding different parts of the city...

479
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:02,838
...and they all appear to be equally
nervous over losing power and control.

480
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:05,326
Half of them are under 15.

481
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,825
Some Red Cross instruction
sheets want translating.

482
01:04:09,018 --> 01:04:09,967
Can you help?

483
01:04:10,297 --> 01:04:12,633
Use Pran. He speaks French
better than I do.

484
01:04:12,826 --> 01:04:14,801
I'd prefer it if it was you.
