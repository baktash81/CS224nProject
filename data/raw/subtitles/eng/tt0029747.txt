00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,110
(Music and chattering)

2
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,119
Hey, this thing
ain't working right.

3
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,839
It's working all right for me.

4
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,638
(Cheering)

5
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,878
(Applause )

6
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,276
(Landlord) Mary! Mary Roberts!

7
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,113
Get busy now. Here he is again.

8
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,435
What's up with you?
Why aren't you helping Lola?

9
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,750
I'm sorry, sir,
but the dishes...

10
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,038
Bother the dishes. You've got to
help her make her changes.

11
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,554
- Yes, sir.
- Now get going.

12
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,074
Come on, get going,
get going. Go on!

13
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,472
(All shout)
We want Lola! We want Lola!

14
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,709
(Silence )

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,394
Gentlemen, it's my aim

16
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,189
to give you the best
entertainment money can buy.

17
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,510
I've brought here
at great expense...

18
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,034
Get a piece of fat
and slide off!

19
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,599
Who said that?

20
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,392
(All scream )

21
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,073
All right, you'll get Lola.

22
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,593
(Laughter and shouting)

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,591
Hurry, they're getting restless.

24
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,911
- I gotta look good.
- They shot at me!

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,355
- Aw, quit whining.
- Hurry!

26
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,399
If we ever get enough money,
we'll leave this one-horse tank.

27
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,708
Come on, hurry.

28
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,553
- How do I look?
- Like a million.

29
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,596
(Band plays )

30
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,315
(Applause and whistles )

31
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,109
# Say, I've been roamin'
from Frisco to Maine

32
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,158
# Been huntin' a man
that's not too tame

33
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,073
# He's gotta have somethin'
I need a lot

34
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,597
# Baby, dear,
that's what you've got

35
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,590
# Will you be my lovey-dovey,
my little honey man?

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,717
# We could bill and coo

37
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,598
- Baby!
- # The way all lovers do

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,676
# Will you be my ducky-wucky,
my little sugar pie?

39
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,035
# Never make you blue

40
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,908
# I'd be so sweet to you... #

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,551
Say, Finn, you're a lucky skate,
having a swell gal like Lola.

42
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,278
I certainly am...

43
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,157
What do you mean?

44
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,676
She's the lucky one,
having a swell fellow like me.

45
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,719
- # Will you be my lovey-dovey
- That's me.

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,712
# My little honey man?

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,634
# I'm a little bit lonesome... #

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,756
Have you seen my husband?

49
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,592
Yeah, over there.

50
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,036
# Won't you be my ownsome

51
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,511
- # My little turtle dove... #
- Will I?!

52
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,798
Waiter, I want a big bottle
of wine, right here!

53
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,190
Come on, this here's no good.

54
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,793
Sweetheart!

55
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,434
Oh!

56
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,550
(Whistling and cheering)

57
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,996
Hi, Charley. Hiya, boys.

58
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,229
Oh!

59
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,350
Watch where you're going!

60
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,473
(Whistles )

61
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,830
Hey, Ollie, look.
We're only two miles from town.

62
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,309
Well, I'll never make it.

63
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,516
I've got one foot
in the grave now.

64
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,555
Hey, stop him.
Maybe we can get a ride.

65
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,835
I'll get my clothes on.
Hurry up.

66
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,639
Whoa! Whoa!

67
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,631
(Screeching)

68
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,475
All right, mister. We're in.
Come on, Dinah. Come on.

69
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,594
Are you going
to Brushwood Gulch?

70
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,829
Uh-huh.

71
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,356
We are, too.

72
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,833
A lot of weather
we've been having lately.

73
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,598
Pretty.

74
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,395
It's only four months
to Christmas.

75
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,349
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

76
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,275
Do you mind
if I put my hand right here?

77
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,360
I saw her first. Come.

78
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,358
That's it.

79
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,078
Darling!

80
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,514
Not you! I meant my husband.

81
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,955
Have a nice trip, darling?

82
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,191
Lovely...
until these two came aboard.

83
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,034
They've done nothing
but annoy me all the way in.

84
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,553
Here, you run along home.

85
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,153
Goodbye.

86
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,269
Fiddlin', huh?

87
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,435
We don't like your kind
around these parts.

88
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,637
And there's one thing
we don't allow,

89
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,188
and that's messin'
with our women.

90
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,589
If you want to stay healthy,

91
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,671
get the next coach
out of town.

92
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,354
Yes, sir. We'll be glad to.

93
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,000
Just as soon as we've finished
our business.

94
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,594
If you miss the next coach...

95
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,589
you'll be riding out of here
in a hearse.

96
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,832
- Good day, strangers.
- Good day, sir.

97
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,194
Goodbye.

98
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,396
Let well enough alone.

99
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,277

Howdy, gents. What'll it be?

153
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,914
Do you know the whereabouts
of a lady named Mary Roberts?

154
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,549
(Bartender) Sure.
She's around here someplace.

155
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,197
I'm Miss Roberts' guardian.
What do you want to see her for?

156
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,396
We have some news for her.

157
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,232
What's it about?

158
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,233
I'm sorry, sir, but we're
not supposed to discuss that.

159
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,710
It's private. Her father died
and left her a goldmine.

160
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,633
We're not supposed
to tell anyone but her.

161
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,789
Didn't we, Ollie?

162
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,950
- A goldmine?
- It's the biggest...

163
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,919
Now that he's taken you
into our confidence,

164
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,594
you might as well know the rest.

165
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,599
(Whispers ) We've got
the deed to the property.

166
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,752
We have to give it
to her in person.

167
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,750
What?

168
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,231
I said we've got the deed
to the property and... Oh!

169
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,836
Say, you better show it to him.
Maybe he doesn't believe us.

170
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,512
It's the truth.

171
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,116
Say, did I give you the deed?

172
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,917
Oh, I know where it is.
Excuse me.

173
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,274
See? Mary Roberts.

174
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,796
Come here. Have you ever seen
Mary Roberts?

175
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,670
Good. I'll go and find her.
Don't tell a soul till I return.

176
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,478
- We won't.
- Thank you.

177
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,996
Good thing we found her.

178
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,198
Lola!

179
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,671
Lola, we've got a fortune
right in the palm of our hand.

180
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,875
What?

181
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,554
There's men downstairs
looking for Mary Roberts.

182
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,550
So?

183
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,679
They have a deed to a goldmine
left to her by her father.

184
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,716
They're here to deliver it.

185
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,631
Well, ain't that just grand?

186
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,076
It would be
if you were Mary Roberts.

187
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,913
Yeah, but I'd never
get away with it.

188
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,560
Sure you would!
They've never seen her.

189
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,153
Then it's a cinch.

190
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,319
Put that shoe on properly.

191
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,678
- What's wrong?
- I can't eat that.

192
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,990
It's as tough as shoe leather.

193
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,555
- Think you can do it?
- Can I do it(?)

194
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,551
For a goldmine,
I'd be Cleopatra.

195
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,030
- That's the girl.
- Bring 'em up.

196
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,034
(Landlord) Hey!

197
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,237
- Come and meet Mary Roberts.
- Right away.

198
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,677
Did you call, Mr Finn?

199
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,469
Get back to the kitchen where
you belong. Don't bother me.

200
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,313
This way, gentlemen.
Come right this way.

201
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,236
This way, gentlemen.

202
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,195
Sit down and I'll get Lola...
I mean Mary for you.

203
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,511
I've told her the news
and she's terribly shocked.

204
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,358
- Lola, they're here.
- Swell, kiddo.

205
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,470
Put these in your arms.

206
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,395
Mary, these are the gentlemen
I was telling you about.

207
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,993
(Clop!)

208
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,110
Tell me... Tell me
about my dear, dear daddy.

209
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,350
Is it true that he's dead?

210
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,477
Well, we hope he is.
They buried him.

211
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,991
It can't be. What did he die of?

212
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,710
I think he died of a Tuesday.
Or was it Wednesday? Do you...?

213
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,872
I'll handle
this delicate situation.

214
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,030
Little lady,
you've heard the worst.

215
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,918
Now prepare yourself
for the best.

216
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,037
Now, cheer up.
Smile. That's right.

217
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,911
Remember, every cloud
has a silver lining.

218
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,356
That's right.
Any bird can build a nest,

219
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,035
but not everyone can
lay an egg, eh, Ollie?

220
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,269
That's right.

221
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,758
Do you know you own one of the
richest goldmines in the world?

222
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,671
Your father left you
the whole property.

223
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,710
And he gave me the honour
of presenting you with the deed.

224
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,315
- Isn't it wonderful, Uncle?
- Yes, my dear.

225
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,635
Who's there?

226
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,518
- Mary.
- Mary who?

227
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,034
Mary... Merry Christmas.

228
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,713
Excuse me, Mr Finn.

229
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,951
One gentleman
dropped this on the stairs.

230
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,999
Ooh, thank you, little lady.
You don't know what you've done.

231
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,116
All right. All right. All right.

232
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,438
There you are.
Signed, sealed and now...

233
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,238
delivered.

234
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,675
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

235
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,031
Come, Stanley. We'd better go.

236
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,953
Oh, say. What about the locket?

237
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,837
- That's right...
- We've something else.

238
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,797
I almost forgot.

239
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,911
And besides that...

240
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,349
your father left you
this family heirloom.

241
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,635
Oh, yes. I remember it well.

242
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,678
Help me get it off, Stanley.

243
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,476
Am I hurting you?

244
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,551
No. Just a minute.

245
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,596
Won't be long.

246
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,630
Maybe I'd better try
opening it again.

247
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,073
I think so.

248
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,072
(Whispers ) Slipped.

249
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,029
Maybe you'd better
take your coat off.

250
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,429
Pardon me just a minute.

251
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,918
We'll find it in just a moment.

252
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,951
We got it.

253
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,198
I'll go in and change.
Pardon us.

254
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,672
- Say, Ollie?
- What?

255
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,150
Now that you're undressed,
why not take a bath?

256
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,552
Would you mind leaving the room?
Can't I have a little privacy?

257
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,189
Just trying to kill two birds
with one stone.

258
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,993
I'll take care of those bozos.

259
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,312
Don't worry, leave it to me.
I've done pretty good so far.

260
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,756
You certainly have.
I wish you were in my shoes.

261
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,594
- (Coughs ) How about a drink?
- That suits me fine.

262
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,639
- How did you dress so quick?
- None of your business.

263
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,837
Goodbye, and thanks
for the use of your boudoir.

264
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,876
- You're very welcome.
- Goodbye.

265
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,919
Now you have the mine,
you'll be a swell gold-digger.

266
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,558
Goodbye.

267
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,308
Why did you leave them?

268
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,597
You have her sign
the deeds over to us.

269
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,353
You get those guys
out of town now!

270
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,032
All right.

271
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,194
What a cinch.

272
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,352
Give the gentlemen the best
in the house.

273
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,350
Yes, sir.

274
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,271
I'll be back in a minute.

275
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,752
# On a mountain in Virginia

276
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,396
# Stands a lonesome pine

277
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,833
# Just below is the cabin home

278
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,993
# Of a little girl of mine

279
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,676
# Her name is June
and very, very soon

280
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,673
# She'll belong to me

281
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,912
# For I know
she's waiting there for me

282
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,834
# 'Neath that lone pine tree

283
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:22,758
(In harmony ) # In the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia

00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,913

# Oh, June,
like the mountains I'm blue

288
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:49,516
# Like the pine
I'm lonesome for you-oh-oh-oh

289
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,948
# In the Blue Ridge Mountains

290
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,397

(Sings soprano ) # In the Blue

(Snores )

302
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,232
That's fine.

303
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,390
Miss Lola, what is this for?

304
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,950
Er... Now whatever we do
on your behalf is legal.

305
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,314
Thank you very much.

306
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,075
Don't mention it. Now run right
along with your work.

307
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,200
Well, here's looking at you.

308
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,952
(Growling)

309
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,912
Shoo!

310
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,718
- Well, I've got to be going.
- So have we.

311
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,155
- Goodbye, Mr Finn.
- Goodbye.

312
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,276
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

313
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,349
Have a good time.

314
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,309
- Goodbye, Miss, er...? Miss...?
- Roberts. Mary Roberts.

315
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,392
- Goodbye, Miss Roberts.
- Goodbye.

316
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,674
Did you hear what her name was?

317
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,193
Sure - Mary Roberts.

318
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,319
How can she be if we've just
given the deed to Mary Roberts?

319
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,277
I don't know.

320
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,872
- I smell a rat.
- I smell something, too.

321
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,791
(Sizzling)

322
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,192
Come on.

323
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,319
Pardon me.

324
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,358
Did you ever have
a father called Sy Roberts?

325
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,991
Why, yes. He left me with these
people when he went prospecting.

326
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,230
Who's that woman upstairs?

327
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,914
Lola Marcel. Mr Finn's wife.

328
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,434
She's my legal guardian now.

329
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,553
(Clang!)

330
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,551
Can I speak to you?

331
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,677
- Pardon us.
- We'll be right back.

332
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,875
You know what?

333
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,191
I think we've given that deed
to the wrong woman.

334
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,353
Our first mistake since that guy
sold us the Brooklyn Bridge.

335
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,592
That was no mistake. It'll be
worth a lot of money some day.

336
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,955
Maybe you're right.
Let's get the deed.

337
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,873
Say, maybe they won't
give it back to us?

338
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,791
What do you mean?

339
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,633
We'll get that deed
or I'll eat your hat.

340
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,917
That's what
I call determination.

341
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,797
Come on.

342
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,075
Splendid! Splendid!

343
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,470
She fell for it
like you fell for me.

344
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,552
Lola, my girl,
we're sittin' pretty.

345
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,518
- Who's there?
- Me.

346
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,036
- Me who?
- Me who(!)

347
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,712
What do you want?

348
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,598
Out of my way,
you snake in the grass!

349
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,278
You toad in the hole.

350
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,636
Say, what do ya mean
bustin' in here like this?

351
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,678
We want to know
why you're not Mary Roberts.

352
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,512
I'll take care of this.

353
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,318
So, you got wise?

354
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,188
If it's this deed you're after,
you're out of luck.

355
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,236
Take it, Stan. Beat it!

356
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,996
That's it. There you are!

357
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,228
Ow! Ow! AAAH!

358
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,675
AAAH!

359
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,912
(Puffs )

360
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,630
That's it!

361
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,951
Get it, Stan! Get it!

362
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,554
Go on, get it! Go on, Stan!

363
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,870
Go on and get it, Stan!

364
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,759
Give me that deed.

365
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,592
Get away! Get away!

366
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,352
Why don't you...?

367
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,079
Give me that!

368
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,074
Go on, get it.

369
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,072
Get away from that door!
Get away from it!

370
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,359
Now, you stop.

371
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,759
Stop!

372
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,719
(Laughs )

373
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,830
Back! Steady. Get back.

374
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,390
(Squeals) Ollie,
come and get...

375
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,313
Don't you touch that!

376
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,759
Stop! Ooh, you're tickling!

377
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,310
Not yet! Not yet!

378
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,468
Stay where you are. Don't move!

379
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,152
Ah-ha!

380
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,719
Ho-ho!

381
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,358
Hee-hee!

382
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,079
(Ollie yelling)

383
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,630
Here, Stan, take it!

384
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,395
I can't stand it!

385
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,997
Now, get 'em outta here.

386
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,234
(Finn ) Get out!

387
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,630
Now! Get out!

388
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,358
(Knock on door)

389
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,714
- Who's there?
- The Sheriff.

390
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,157
Just in the nick of time.
Now we'll get justice.

391
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,998
Sheriff, you're just the man
I'm looking for.

392
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,594
And you're just the man
I'M looking for.

393
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,831
Thank you. This man... Oh.

394
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,748
(Laughs even more )

395
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,278
I thought I told you two dudes
to catch the next coach.

396
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,713
Yes, sir.

397
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,631
It left ten minutes ago.

398
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,030
It did? Maybe we'd better
try and catch it.

399
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,236
I'll say you better!

400
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,675
(Gunshots )

401
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,711
- Look at them go!
- You can't see them for dust.

402
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,315
- Say, Ollie?
- What?

403
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,359
Are we taking a chance going
back and robbing that safe?

404
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,671
Chance or no chance,
we're getting that deed back.

405
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,834
As soon as my clothes are dry,
that's exactly what we'll do.

406
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,993
That's a good idea.
If that girl ever found out...

407
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,150
Give me a light.

408
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,671
Those matches are soaking wet.

409
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,473
Thank you.

410
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,159
See if my clothes are dry.

411
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,231
Your hat's dry.

412
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,636
That reminds me, you made
a statement this afternoon.

413
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,756
Did I?

414
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,391
You said if we didn't get
the deed, you'd eat my hat.

415
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,471
Now you're taking me
illiterally.

416
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,270
Nevertheless, I'm going to teach
you not to make rash promises.

417
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,429
Eat the hat.

418
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,638
That's silly. Who ever heard
of anybody eating a hat?

419
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,349
Who ever heard
of anybody doing that?

420
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,715
- Eat the hat.
- I won't do it.

421
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,392
If you don't,

422
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,917
I'll tie you to a tree
and let the buzzards get you.

423
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,873
- Would you really?
- I certainly would.

424
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,076
(Squeaks ) I never ate a hat.

425
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,196
Eat it.

426
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,713
(Boing!)

427
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,075
(Twang!)

428
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,632
(Ripping)

429
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,953
(Ripping)

430
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,836
Get my clothes.

431
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,719
Ow!

432
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,159
Shh!

433
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,632
(Whispers ) Wait a minute.
I'll help you.

434
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,836
(Alarm bell rings )

435
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,477
What did you push me
in there like that for?

436
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,835
You're the dumbest thing
I ever saw.

437
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,992
(Whispers ) Hey, hey,
I've got an idea.

438
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,834
Why don't we climb on the shed,
get on the balcony

439
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,549
and go in there
to save us going in the front?

440
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,076
Now, that deserves
consideration.

441
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,155
Hey! Psst! Psst!
Hey, Ollie! Psst!

442
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,231
Are you all right? Psst!

443
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,634
Wait. I'll get a ladder for you.
Won't be a minute. Shh!

444
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,758
I'm going
to get a ladder for him.

445
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,555
- Shh!
- Shh!

446
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,550
We'll follow our original plan
and go through the front.

447
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,039
Now, go ahead.

448
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,278
Do you mind
if I have another idea?

449
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,148
If it's anything like the last
one, yes. What is it?

450
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,392
How about me pulling you up
on the block and tackle?

451
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,235
What are you doing out here?

452
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,151
There's something wrong...

453
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,949
Yes, it's you. Come back to bed.
Scaring me to death...

454
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,438
Here, hold that.

455
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,077
Now, are you all ready?
Upsadaisy.

456
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,073
Now, don't get fancy.
Just get me up there.

457
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,276
(Creaking)

458
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,109
Wait till I spit on my hands.

459
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,350
All right... No!

460
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,837
Upsadaisy.

461
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,356
I'll spit on 'em
again to make sure.

462
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,598
(Creaking)

463
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,399
Uh!

464
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,600
Hand me the end of that rope.

465
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,150
Now hold out your hand.

466
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,595
Hold out your hand.

467
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,159
This one.

468
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,948
Now tie that on the mule.

469
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,468
Tie that on the mule.

470
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,276
Get on the mule.

471
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,911
Get on the mule.

472
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,559
(Clicks teeth)

473
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,115
Hey!

474
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,157
- Where are the tools?
- In the saddlebag.

475
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,071
Hand them to me.

476
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,309
OK.

477
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,556
I'll be right over.

478
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,551
Aaaaah!

479
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,030
What are you trying to do?

480
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,678
Get the mule down.

481
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,228
Not now.
We'll attend to that later.

482
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,312
- Maybe we can get in here.
- Good idea.

483
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,628
(Hisses )

484
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,759
- Shh!
- Shh!

485
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,037
- Wait there. We'll be right up.
- Shh!

486
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,074
(Brays )

487
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,915
What's the matter?

488
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,673
- Stop laughing in your sleep.
- I'm not.

489
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,274
I'd know your laugh anywhere.
Go to sleep!

490
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,510
Keeping me awake
all night like this...

491
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,472
Psst!

492
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,999
(Whistles )

493
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,268
Shh!

494
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,918
(Screams )

495
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,149
(Ollie ) Ow!

496
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,519
What are you doing here?

497
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,353
As soon as I get out of here,
I'll explain.

498
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,510
(Finn ) Mary!
What are you doing?

499
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,079
Hide me! Hide me!

500
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,355
(Finn ) What's that noise
down there?

501
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,953
(Finn ) Answer me!

502
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,755
Mary!

503
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,433
No! You must hide.

504
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,559
(Finn ) Mary, what's going on
down there? What's that noise?

505
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,240
Why are you roaming around
this late?

506
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,311
- Mr Finn, I...
- You...

507
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,154
Get back to bed and not another
peep out of you.

508
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,798
The idea.

509
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,799
Oh! Oh! Oh!

510
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,598
Shh!

511
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,156
Please, what are you doing here?

512
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,676
Come in and I'll tell you
all about it.

513
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,439
- Ollie.
- What?

514
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,035
Wait there.
I'll be right back. Shh!

515
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,393
(Silence )

516
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,791
You put on your clothes
and we'll see you later. Shh!

517
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,472
Ooh!

518
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,915
- Where have you been?
- I told Mary what happened.

519
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,310
When you get the deed,
she'll leave with us.

520
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,231
Good. Where is she now?

521
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,039
She's getting dressed.
She'll meet us outside.

522
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,588
Fine. Now get me out of this.

523
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,193
OK.

524
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,356
Take it easy, now.

525
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,436
You can't...

526
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,308
You can't do it that way.

527
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,595
(Creaking)

528
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,390
Take it easy. Shh!

529
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,113
Maybe I can pull you
all the way through.

530
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,037
Let go, you're choking...

531
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,108
Oh, me apple!

532
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,713
Are you all right?

533
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,712
(Rattle )

534
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,391
(Whirring)

535
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,877
(Rattle of coins )

536
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,555
Oh!

537
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,553
What did you go and do that for?

538
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,039
Well, I didn't know...

539
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,838
Shh!

540
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,399
(Yells in panic)

541
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,078
(Finn ) Mary!
What are you doing down there?

542
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,549
What's going on?

543
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,710
(Finn ) Mary! Mary!

544
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,472
(Finn ) Mary!

545
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,835
(Finn ) Mary!

546
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,598
Will you move over?

547
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,159
(Strums piano strings )

548
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,150
(Furious playing)

549
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,838
Aaah! Oh!

550
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,394
Give me that gun!

551
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,357
Put up your hands! Not you!

552
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,512
- What are you doing?
- Getting those deeds back.

553
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,558
- You can't do that!
- Go on! Go on!

554
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,555
Get in that room. Go on!
Open the safe and get the deed.

555
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,073
Hurry up.

556
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,918
(Screams )

557
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,039
Get back in that room. Go on.
Now give us that deed.

558
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,190
Come on, take it, Stan.

559
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,589
Get in there and get to bed.

560
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,558
- I-I-I...
- Go on! Shut up!

561
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,234
You can't get away...

562
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,073
- Get in bed.
- I'll fix you.

563
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,149
Tie him up.

564
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,755
- What are you going to do?
- Never mind.

565
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,674
- Stop that. You can't do that!
- Shut up. Shut up.

566
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,990
You can't.
I'll get you for this.

567
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,038
Go and get Dinah.
I'll take care of him.

568
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,193
Let me out of this.
Let me go. You can't do that.

569
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,429
Stop that. Let me down.
Let me outta here.

570
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,035
What are you going to do?

571
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:14,114
I'll get you for this. Let
me go! Let me go! Help! Lola!

572
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,239
Lola! Lola! Lola! Lola!

Let me out!
Stop! Come back here!

578
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,790
Now our troubles are over,
where do we go from here?

579
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,155
I'd like to return
to my hometown.

580
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,515
- Where's that?
- Way down south.

581
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,989
- You're from the South?
- Sure am.

582
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,356
Well, fan my brow!
I'm from the South.

583

The south of London.

587
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,349
London! Well, honey,
we'll all go down to Dixie.

588
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,319
Oh, for a slice
of possum and yam. Ooh!

589
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,109
Yes, sir, and some
good ol' fish and chips.

590
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,315
Fish and chips(!)

591
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,439

(Mary and Ollie ) # D.I.X... #

599
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,233
I know how to spell it.

600
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,958
