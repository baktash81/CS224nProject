The guy just...

179
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,045
(WAITER MUMBLING) Go get them.
Go get them.

180
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,741
I don't want that. I don't want that.
You eat it.

181
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,369
Chopsticks
and a fortune cookie.

182
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,374
Put out the fucking cigarette.
I'm eating.

183
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,209
Sorry.

184
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,208
What's the matter
with you?

185
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,542
I'm just...

186
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,382
What happened to all the
ashtrays in this town?

188

You run a perfectly
good business.

189
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,303
I don't know why you
want to change now.

190
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,640
You know how much my
business made last year?

191
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,179
Thirty grand.

192
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,313
I can build a car
in six months

193
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,188
and in six seconds, these
jerks write it off as a stunt

194
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,769
that won't even make
it into the movie.

195
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:40,953
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,239
See, all I need is
a hard used stock car.

197
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,657
That's all.

198
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,658
And I figure we start off with small
town circuit and we work our way up.

199
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,661
And once we get to the show,
we're talking millions.

00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,208
WAITER: I have the chopsticks, sir.
Yeah.

201
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,535
Where's the cookies?

202

WAITER: Uh... You know, I...
Forget it. Forget it.

203
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,206

given me a number.

207

Mr. Rose, I wouldn't
come to you with this

208
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,721
unless I was
absolutely sure about it.

209
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,552
How can you be sure,
Shannon?

210
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,851
What do you got that the big
professional race teams don't?

211
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,393
I got the driver.

212
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,021
You just told me they had
half a dozen drivers.

213
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,571
Not like this one.

214
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,861
This kid is special.

215
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:28,467
I've been working
with him for a while.

216
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,670
I've never seen
anything like it.

217
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,571
If I had the money,
I'd back him myself.

218
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,311
Yeah, but you don't
have the money.

219
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,370
Mr. Rose, you put this
kid behind the wheel,

220
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,705
there's nothing
he can't do.

221
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,092
There's money here.
You can't lose.

222

in my fucking restaurant?

225
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,561
Take a fucking hike. I want
to talk to my partner.

226
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,399
I'm just fucking
with you.

227
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,114
How you doing, Shannon?
How's the fucking leg?

228
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,446
I paid my debt.

229
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,072
I'll think about it.
Okay?

230
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,331
But I want to
meet the kid first.

231
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,492

Do we get the 400?

I help you?

just drop it down here.

be neighborly too.

are neighbors, right?

twice about it.

here about five or six years ago.

to see what he could do.

The kid's amazing.
Yeah.

283
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,321

on the spot.

Boom. (SNAPS FINGERS)

for a second, will you?

problem than I thought.

pussy in a whorehouse.

will even make you good-looking.

353

NINO: I'm already
good-looking, pal.

How's it going?

355
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,644
When's our
first race?

356
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,522
Uh, pretty soon.

357
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,475
You gonna
be ready?

358
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,440
I hope so.

Hey, no false modesty. I got
a lot of money in this.

361
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,371
Did Shannon ever
tell you how we met?

362
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,207
No.

363
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,034
I used to
produce movies.

364
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,415
In the '80s.

365
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,751
Kind of like action films.
Sexy stuff.

366
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,925
One critic called
them European.

367
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,002
I thought
they were shit.

368
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,889
Anyway, he arranged all the cars for me.
Did all the stunts.

369
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,058
I liked him. I liked
having him around.

370
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,431
Even though he overcharged
the shit out of me.

371
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,893
His next
business venture,

372
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,691
he got involved with
some of Nino's friends.

373
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,110
They didn't go for
the overcharging bit.

374
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,438
They broke his pelvis.

375
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,239
He's never had
a lot of luck.

376
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,694
The reason
I'm telling you this

377
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,325
is that he has a lot
invested in you.

378
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,073
And so do I.

379
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,372
So anything you need,
you call me.

380
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,623
We're a team now.

381

Yeah.

386
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,193
How can you tell?

387
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,651
Because he's
a shark.

388
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,237
There's no
good sharks?

389
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,369
No. I mean, just look at him.

going to call Bernie.

going to do?

I already gave you
my advice.

755
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:26,761
You should have taken the
money and left the guy alone.

756

It's not that
simple, Bernie.

He was going to invest
it here in LA.

up a rival operation.

on our action.

you come to me

She's off the map.

884
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:56,281
I can't offer
you the same.

885
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:59,576
So, this is what
I would suggest.

886
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:03,614
We conclude our deal.
We'll shake hands.

887
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,040
You start the
rest of your life.

888
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:11,375
Any dreams you have,
or plans,

889
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:13,377
or hopes for your future...

890
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,834
I think you're going to
have to put that on hold.

891
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,800
For the rest of your life you're going
to be looking over your shoulder.

892
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,256
I'm just telling you this

893
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:23,717
because I want you
to know the truth.

894
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:26,720
But the girl is safe.

895
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:49,325
Where's the money now?

896
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,753
It's in the car.

897
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:01,967
Come on.
