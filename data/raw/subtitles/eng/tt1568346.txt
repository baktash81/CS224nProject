1
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,157
- What kind is it?
- I don't know.

2
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,492
White?

3
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,327
And the frame?

4
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,247
- Dark.
- Postmark?

5
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,499
Same as last time.

6
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,668
And no note.

7
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,253
No.

8
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,589
I'm so sorry, Henrik.

9
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,954
Will you appeal?

10
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,415
What is this?
The media event of the year?

11
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,917
Don't try to play it down, Mikael.
It won't work.

12
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,378
Don't try to play it up.
That won't work either.

13
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,922
Mikael, can we get a quote?

14
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,842
Mikael, will you appeal?

15
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,303
Yes. I'll appeal to you, Viggo.

16
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,390
Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist
was able to play the victim...

17
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,976
...the brave journalist going up
against the bad guy.

18
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,604
I don't know why malicious intent
couldn't be proven.

19
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,899
- When you call a guy a criminal--
- If you want to say these things--

20
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,817
Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity.

21
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,904
There's really no greater disgrace
for a journalist than libel.

22
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,240
--was found guilty today on 16 counts
of aggravated libel.

23
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,994
Can I get that sandwich there?
And a black coffee.

24
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,080
In an article published earlier
this year, Blomkvist claimed...

25
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,459
...Wennerström, founder and president
of the Wennerström Group...

26
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:15,296
...used state funds intended
for industrial development in Poland...

27
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,382
...in an arms deal with the right-wing
Ustaše in Croatia.

28
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,510
I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist.
He's a fine journalist...

29
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,971
...who I don't believe
is guided by malice.

30
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,182
But what he wrote was inaccurate.

31
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,976
And inaccuracies
can't go unanswered.

32
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,438
All journalists have to accept,
like the rest of us...

33
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,650
...actions have consequences.

34
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,526
Blomkvist was ordered to pay...

35
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,321
...600,000 Swedish kronor
in damages and all court costs.

36
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,866
Can I get a packet of Marlboro Red
and a lighter?

37
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,023
Yeah.

38
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,660
- Where have you been?
- Walking. Thinking.

39
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,370
- Smoking?
- Yeah. Just one.

40
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,546
TV4 called.
I told them no statement...

41
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,965
...until we've read
the judgment in its entirety.

42
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,384
Well, I have. Anyone else?

43
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,428
Everyone who wants
to see you humiliated.

44
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,055
- Been on the phone all morning?
- I'm as much to blame.

45
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,474
- You are? You wrote it?
- I read it. I ran it.

46
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,810
- Not the same.
- Our credibility isn't dead yet.

47
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,603
Mine is.

48
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,066
I'm tired.

49
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,903
I'm gonna go home,
crawl under the duvet for a week.

50
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,785
I'll call Greger,
tell him I'm not coming home.

51
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,203
Thank you.

52
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,043
It's possible we could wait forever.

53
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,963
- You called her and spoke to her?
- I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.

54
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,845
No one here particularly likes her.

55
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,347
I find it's much better
if she works from home.

56
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,225
But you told her
I wanted to meet with her.

57
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,062
I've told her many times
I prefer her not to meet clients.

58
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,398
- You like her?
- Very much.

59
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,818
She's one of the best investigators
I have, as you saw from her report.

60
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,739
- But?
- I'm concerned you won't like her.

61
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,950
- She's different.
- In what way?

62
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,078
In every way.

63
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,127
Miss Salander is here.

64
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,510
Lisbeth.

65
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,929
Mr. Dirch Frode.

66
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,931
How do you do?

67
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,819
Something wrong with the report?

68
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,570
No, it was quite thorough.

69
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,657
But I'm also interested
in what's not in it.

70
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,827
- There's nothing not in it.
- Your opinion of him isn't.

71
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,831
- I'm not paid to give my opinion.
- So you don't have one?

72
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,961
He's clean, in my opinion.

73
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,672
You mean he's hygienic?

74
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,843
He's who he presents himself to be.
In his business, that's an asset.

75
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,138
Well, there's less in his asset column
after his conviction today.

76
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,140
True. He made a fool of himself.

77
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,808
If it happened that way.

78
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,977
Are you suggesting
that he was set up?

79
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,729
That was never part
of my assignment.

80
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,606
But you're right.

81
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,317
He did make a fool of himself
professionally.

82
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,821
How much of a fool did he make
of himself financially?

83
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,699
The judgment will just about
empty his savings.

84
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,033
- May I go?
- Moment.

85
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,370
Your report is light in another area.

86
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,247
His personal life.

87
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,249
Anything you chose not to disclose?

88
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,043
Nothing that warranted inclusion.

89
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,920
Does that mean yes or no?

90
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:29,216
I think what Miss Salander means, and
I agree, is that everyone has a right...

91
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,678
...to a certain amount of privacy,
even if they're being investigated.

92
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,389
Not in this case.
I need to know anything about him...

93
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,143
...I might find unsavory,
even if she doesn't.

94
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,982
He's had a longstanding
sexual relationship...

95
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,236
...with his co-editor of the magazine.
It wrecked his marriage but not hers.

96
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,655
Sometimes he performs cunnilingus.

97
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,158
Not often enough, in my opinion.

98
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,952
No, you're right not to include that.

99
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,495
I know.

100
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,513
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.

101
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:58,973
- She offered.
- He declined.

102
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,683
- As she hoped.
- Never a good idea.

103
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,310
- Mixing family and business.
- I would've lost anyway.

104
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,981
It wasn't about Mikael. It was about
Wennerström sending a message...

105
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,317
...to the press and the FSA,
saying, "Don't ask questions."

106
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,610
Cheer up.

107
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,824
Dad.

108
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,535
Nilla, you don't have
to worry about me.

109
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,495
- Mom's worried.
- About me?

110
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,664
About the money.

111
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,731
Good evening.

112
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,236
Nilla? What are you doing?

113
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,529
Nothing.

114
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,864
Are you serious?

115
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,618
I don't wanna talk about it
since I know you won't approve.

116
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:43,869
Of...?

117
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,704
- Nilla.
- Light of Life.

118
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,247
Light of what?

119
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,674
- Hello?
- Herr Blomkvist.

120
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,927
- Yeah.
- Forgive me for intruding on Christmas.

121
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,470
My name is Dirch Frode.

122
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,599
I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik
Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of him?

123
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,892
Yeah, of course I have.

124
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,478
He'd love to talk to you
about a private matter.

125
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,689
This is an awkward moment.

126
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,943
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down
to a Christmas dinner myself.

127
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,195
No, that's not exactly what I meant.

128
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,739
You're referring
to your recent legal problems.

129
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,783
That has provided us
with much amusement.

130
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,992
I'm sorry?

131
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,703
Herr Vanger has little love
for Herr Wennerström either.

132
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,456
- Have him call me.
- But he would love to speak to you...

133
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,209
...in person, if possible. Up north.

134
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,378
- In Hedestad.
- That's not gonna be possible.

135
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,381
Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old
to go to Stockholm. Please.

136
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,758
Be so kind as to consider.

137
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,719
Hedestad is lovely in the winter.

138
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,932
I'll call you back on this number.
Okay?

139
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,948
Usually when I wake up in a cold bed
it's at home.

140
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,867
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

141
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,036
- I'm writing a press release.
- Saying?

142
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,709
You're taking over as publisher,
you're very sorry...

143
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,170
...for any nuisance
Mr. Wennerström was caused...

144
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,339
- ...and I can't be reached for comment.
- Are you giving up?

145
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,799
Stepping aside.

146
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,885
This makes me sick.

147
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,507
- First time in Hedestad?
- And the last.

148
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,051
Oh, don't say that.
It's lovely in the spring.

149
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,970
You said it would be lovely
in the winter.

150
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,097
Well, this is unseasonable.

151
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,808
Well, I'll be on the 4:30 train
back to Stockholm.

152
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,227
Unless we get snowed in.

153
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,270
I'm joking.

154
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,315
You'll be home tonight,
if that's what you wish.

155
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,273
Welcome.

156
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,524
Come inside.

157
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,110
It's warm.

158
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,736
How do you do?

159
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,661
So...

160
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,372
...what do you know about me?

161
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,042
You used to run one of the largest
industrial firms in the country.

162
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,628
- "Used to." That's correct.
- Oh, I didn't mean that.

163
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,589
- Should I stay?
- No.

164
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,342
My grandfather forged the tracks...

165
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,678
...that the 4:30 train
will take you home on.

166
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,264
We stitched this country together.

167
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:37,144
We made the steel, milled the lumber
that built modern Sweden.

168
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,564
And what do you think
our most profitable product now is?

169
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,982
Fertilizer.

170
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,901
I'm not obsessed by
the declining health of the company.

171
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,696
But I am with
the settling of accounts.

172
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,198
And the clock is ticking.
I need your help.

173
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,783
I'm-- Doing what?

174
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,411
Officially, assisting
with my memoirs.

175
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:59,166
But what you'll really be doing...

176
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:03,378
...is solving a mystery
by doing what you do so well.

177
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,964
Your recent legal mishap
notwithstanding.

178
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:10,510
You will be investigating thieves,
misers, bullies...

179
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:16,183
...the most detestable collection
of people that you will ever meet.

180
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,893
My family.

181
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,278
Would you like to sit? I could possibly
clear a place if necessary.

182
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,614
- Did you make it?
- Have you something for me?

183
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,538
I am on welfare, I do not administer it.
This is not enough.

184
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,218
No, thank you.

185
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,597
This is Harriet.

186
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,018
The granddaughter
of my brother Richard.

187
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,563
Richard was a Nazi
of the first order...

188
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:09,194
...joining the Nationalist Socialist
Freedom League when he was 17.

189
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,949
Isn't it interesting how fascists
always steal the word "freedom"?

190
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,830
Oh, the 4:30. Yes, I know. Okay.

191
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:24,835
Anyway, Richard died a martyr
to the Nazi cause in 1940.

192
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,629
Missed all the real excitement.

193
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:32,134
But not the opportunity to regularly
beat his wife, Margareta...

194
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,052
...and their son, Gottfried.

195
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,929
Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father...

196
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,807
...was what they used to call
a good-time Charlie.

197
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,601
- They still call them that.
- Do they? Okay.

198
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,146
He was a charmer,
a ladies' man and a drunk.

199
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,274
In other words, a born salesman.
Which he did for the company...

200
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,152
...traveling around
and taking clients out to dinner.

201
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,654
- Well, somebody's gotta do it.
- That's right.

202
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,824
Anyway, he died in 1965.

203
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,993
Drowned, drunk, here on the island.

204
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:02,581
His wife, Isabella, who had been pretty
much useless as a parent before...

205
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,125
...became even more so
after his death...

206
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,961
...which is when I began
looking after the children.

207
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,131
Martin, who runs Vanger Industries,
now that I'm retired.

208
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,924
That's right, I Googled him.

209
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,259
And Harriet.

210
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,431
She was bright, curious...

211
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,893
...a winning combination
in any person.

212
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,480
- And beautiful.
- Yeah.

213
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,691
Something happened to her?

214
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,068
Someone in the family
murdered Harriet...

215
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,738
...and for the past 40 years...

216
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,991
...has been trying
to drive me insane.

217
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,454
It was September 24th, 1966.

218
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,414
A Saturday.

219
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,291
Harriet was 16.

220
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,584
My brothers...

221
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,420
...and their wives and their children
and grandchildren...

222
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,880
...were all gathered here...

223
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,091
...for our loathsome annual
board meeting and dinner.

224
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,304
It was also the day the yacht club
held their autumn parade.

225
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,641
Harriet, with one or two school
friends, went into town to see it.

226
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,894
She returned a little after 2:00.

227
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,940
She came into the parlor.
She asked if she could talk to me.

228
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,359
I honestly don't remember
what I was doing...

229
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,402
...that I thought
was more important...

230
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,030
...but I told her
to give me a few minutes.

231
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:23,578
It was during those few minutes
that something else occurred.

232
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,793
The accident had nothing to do
with Harriet...

233
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,086
...and yet everything.

234
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,298
It was chaos as everybody
put down what they were doing.

235
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,801
Police, ambulance, fire brigade...

236
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:41,888
...reporters, photographers, onlookers
all quickly arrived from town...

237
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:46,560
...just as we on the island, the family,
hurried to the bridge from our side.

238
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,144
The driver of the car...

239
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,896
...a man named Aronsson...

240
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,399
...was pinned and severely injured.

241
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,485
We tried desperately
to pry him loose with our hands...

242
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,029
...since metal tools might spark.

243
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:03,159
It was an hour after the crash
that Harriet was in the kitchen.

244
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,453
Anna herself saw her.

245
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:14,462
Well, we finally got poor Aronsson
out of his car and off to the hospital.

246
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,174
Just as we from our side...

247
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,344
...slowly drifted back to the house.

248
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,557
The sun was down,
the excitement over.

249
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,059
We sat down to dinner.

250
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,853
It was then that I noticed...

251
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,813
...Harriet wasn't there.

252
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,983
And she wasn't there
the next morning.

253
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:36,943
Or the next.

254
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,070
Or the next 40 years.

255
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,534
What was she going to tell me?

256
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,954
Why didn't I make time for her?
Why didn't I listen?

257
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,499
- And she couldn't have just run away?
- No. Not without being seen.

258
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
The firemen stayed out all night...

259
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,462
...on the bridge
pumping up gasoline.

260
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,465
No one swam across
or took a boat.

261
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,343
All the boats were still tied up
on this side Sunday.

262
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,137
Believe me, I checked.

263
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,099
She couldn't have just fallen
and drowned?

264
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:13,021
No. The currents aren't strong here.
Anything that falls in the water turns up.

265
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,481
Like her father.

266
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,025
His body didn't drift
more than 10 meters...

267
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,611
...when he drowned the year before.

268
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,906
Oh, no. Someone killed her.

269
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,700
Someone on the island that day.

270
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,869
Someone close enough to know...

271
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:32,457
...what she used to give me
each year on my birthday.

272
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,544
Those are from her.

273
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,507
And the rest, from her killer.

274
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,688
Who knows about these?

275
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,358
There's me, the police, the killer...

276
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,776
...and now you.

277
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,246
After the police investigation
evaporated...

278
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,207
...I kept at it, studying
all the information there was.

279
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:18,586
I have spent half my life
examining the events of a single day.

280
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,922
I understand your frustration...

281
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,925
...but what you're asking me to do,
it's a waste of money.

282
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,220
- But we haven't discussed your fee.
- We don't need to.

283
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,847
Thank you.

284
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,642
I can't find something
you've been unable to find in 40 years.

285
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,646
You don't know that. You have
a very keen investigative mind.

286
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,732
Here's what I propose:

287
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,650
You come stay on the island.

288
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,029
I have a nice little cottage
by the water you can use.

289
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,114
You study the material I send you.

290
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,533
You find something I've missed
or you don't.

291
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,786
What you're asking me to do
is set aside my life and career for--

292
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,997
Think of this
as a well-deserved holiday.

293
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:58,710
A way of avoiding all those people
that you might want to avoid right now.

294
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,421
As for compensation,
I'll pay you double your salary...

295
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,298
...for as many months as it takes.

296
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,259
- Quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
- Herr Vanger--

297
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,595
I'm not done.
I will throw in one more thing...

298
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,930
...even though
you're a terrible negotiator.

299
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,683
It's something you want
more than anything else...

300
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:17,312
...and it can't be bought at any price.
So let me give it to you.

301
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,899
Hans-Erik Wennerström.

302
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,110
He began his career
working for me...

303
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,947
...and I have followed it with interest,
shall we say, ever since.

304
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,368
You were right about him.

305
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,371
You just couldn't prove it.

306
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,364
We're in the middle of the worst crisis
ever, and you're writing a memoir.

307
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:13,201
- You fired me. I need something to do.
- You fired you.

308
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,413
I need you here, not the North Pole.

309
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,999
Mikael, you know
what this is going to look like.

310
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,252
Like I've been gutted.
I'm running away. I am.

311
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,296
Wennerström wants to see me
wave a white flag, not a red flag.

312
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,633
If it looks like there's a problem
between us, it'll satisfy him.

313
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,176
There is a problem between us.

314
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,929
He won't be satisfied
until he shuts us down.

315
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:37,559
- You're leaving me to fight him alone.
- It's four hours by train.

316
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,941
It's not the North Pole.

317
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,151
Hey, hey.

318
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:42,809
Network busy.
Please try again later.

319
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,483
What?

320
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,151
Some milk?

321
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,549
Network busy.
Please try again later.

322
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,095
Oh, yeah. These as well.

323
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,053
- You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
- His ward. He doesn't have a daughter.

324
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,431
Please.

325
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,518
He's had severe
cerebral hemorrhaging...

326
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,230
...either from the fall itself
or from a stroke that led to the fall.

327
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,316
His blood pressure is still high.

328
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:16,486
I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness,
but that's not assured.

329
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,946
And it's possible, even if he does...

330
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,908
...that there will be
neurological damage.

331
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,181
Oh, jeez.

332
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,271
Hi. I'm Gunnar.

333
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,440
The caretaker.

334
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,943
- Oh, hey, Gunnar. Come in.
- Okay.

335
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:04,158
- You want to put it in there?
- Okay.

336
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,960
You're an author.

337
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:18,214
Well, I'm doing a biography
of Herr Vanger.

338
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,302
- I saw you on television.
- That's unfortunate.

339
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,263
Bit of trouble, I guess.

340
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,766
- No jail time though. That's good.
- No.

341
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,936
Cost you a lot of money
though, yeah?

342
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,273
There.

343
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:42,989
The entire island
is owned by my family.

344
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:49,704
Your closest neighbor
is my brother Harald...

345
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,915
...another Nazi, if you can believe.

346
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,625
Two in the family.

347
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,963
Oh, yes, he's quite detestable,
to put it nicely.

348
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,550
But you'll probably never see him.
He's a recluse.

349
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,511
- He was there that day?
- Indeed, he was.

350
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,140
His daughter, Cecilia,
lives over there.

351
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,017
They don't speak.

352
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:13,769
Does anybody speak
to anybody on this island?

353
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,606
Actually, Isabella, Harriet's mother,
who lives there...

354
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,651
...she speaks to Harald, which is one
of the reasons I don't speak to her.

355
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,903
Right.

356
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,281
Cecilia's brother, Birger,
lives over there.

357
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,074
Who doesn't he speak to?

358
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,367
You, probably.

359
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,038
But you wouldn't want him to. He can
be just as unpleasant as Harald.

360
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,998
Quickly losing track
of who's who here.

361
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,168
How you'll wish it were always so.

362
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:41,297
Soon you will know us all
only too well. With my apologies.

363
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:46,636
Now, out there, my grandnephew
Martin's house, Harriet's brother.

364
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,514
- Who speaks to him?
- I speak to him.

365
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,725
He runs the company now,
as I think I told you.

366
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,605
Someone's shooting his dinner.
Gunnar, probably.

367
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,106
Oh, yes, I met him earlier.

368
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,860
He was 19 when
Harriet disappeared.

369
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,196
Well, he lives over there.

370
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,866
- And you live there.
- Sorry?

371
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,576
Your house.

372
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,997
Oh, yes.

373
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,250
Yes, you're right.

374
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,085
The man who hires the detective...

375
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:22,547
...should always be kept
on the suspects list.

376
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,809
Her mother.

377
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,965
But what about the search? Please.

378
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:52,011
Please. I beg you.

379
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:26,796
The fact that I never found a body
was not surprising.

380
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,882
You can't dig up an entire island.

381
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,344
But neither could I find the motive.

382
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,180
Was it spontaneous?
Was it calculated?

383
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,724
Did she know something
someone wished she didn't?

384
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,436
- Was it about business?
- Business? Well, she was 16.

385
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,355
And very bright.

386
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,233
Henrik told me and many others
he could easily see her...

387
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,068
...running the company one day.

388
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:52,321
She was with some friends
that day at a parade.

389
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:56,200
She told them she was feeling unwell.
She left early.

390
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,870
But they also told me
she kept secrets from them too.

391
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,624
The main thing I learned was that
teenage girls are complicated.

392
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,085
- I have one.
- Then you know.

393
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,337
I wanted to...

394
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,424
...ask you about this.

395
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,721
She received that from Henrik
the Christmas before.

396
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,143
I've studied it more times
than I can say.

397
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,895
I know every page of it.

398
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,398
- It's the last page I was curious about.
- As was I.

399
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:31,485
It's a list of names, numbers
and it must have some significance.

400
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,112
All local phone numbers.

401
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,573
The first belonged
to a woman, Margot...

402
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,659
...whose mother was Magda,
who denied knowing Harriet.

403
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,871
The fourth, R.L.,
belonged to Rosmarie Larsson...

404
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,916
...an elderly woman who died
some years before.

405
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:50,463
The other three were not connected
in any way that I could find.

406
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,300
I reminded you of things
you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry.

407
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,510
I can't forget.

408
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,638
It's my Rebecka case.

409
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:01,891
I don't know what that is.

410
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,271
Every policeman has at least one
unsolved case to obsess over.

411
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,483
Back then we had an
Officer Torstensson.

412
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,527
Year after year, he kept
going back to this Rebecka case.

413
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,947
Taking out the files,
studying them over and over.

414
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,158
We were young.
We laughed at him.

415
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,285
And that was also
a missing-girl case?

416
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,205
No, no, no,
that's not why I mention it.

417
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,291
I'm talking about
the soul of a policeman.

418
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,711
Poor old Torstensson
never solved it.

419
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,255
And he never let it go.

420
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,348
So how's Mr. Palmgren doing?

421
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,684
I heard he had a stroke
of some kind?

422
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:46,894
It's terrible.

423
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,106
Now, what exactly do you do
at this security company?

424
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,025
Make coffee, sort mail.

425
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,860
But not full-time.

426
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,071
Not even part-time consistently.

427
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:02,201
They somehow got along without
coffee or mail in July and August?

428
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,041
- How much do you make there?
- Enough.

429
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,877
How much is your rent?

430
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,546
I pay my rent.

431
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,051
And when was the last time
you were late?

432
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,261
Never.

433
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,974
You think that thing through your
eyebrow makes you attractive?

434
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,394
Here's the problem.

435
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,065
There's a discrepancy
between the obligation...

436
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:37,361
...of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship
and the management of your finances.

437
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,739
There's no discrepancy. It was clear
I could manage my own finances.

438
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,074
That is not clear to me.

439
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,410
- I'm not a child.
- You are not. But you were.

440
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,745
And between then and now,
you were committed...

441
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,748
...to the locked ward of St. Stefan's
where you continued...

442
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,042
...to display violent aggression.

443
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,421
And you failed to adapt
to four foster homes...

444
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:58,924
...were arrested twice for intoxication,
twice for narcotics...

445
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:03,137
...again for assault,
smashing a bottle into a man's face.

446
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,598
And it's not even that long ago.

447
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:10,102
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren
into thinking that you have changed...

448
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,104
...but when I'm looking at this...

449
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:16,233
...not to mention the way
you're looking at me now...

450
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,193
...I don't think you have.

451
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,322
So the good old
Mr. Palmgren days are over.

452
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,491
Starting now, you will be given
a monthly allowance.

453
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,952
You'll provide me with receipts
for your expenses.

454
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,331
If the numbers don't balance, I assume
the difference is going to drugs.

455
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,374
I've taken care of myself
since I was 10.

456
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,001
The state has taken care of you.

457
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,879
Miss Salander, please, look at me,
this is important.

458
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:40,382
Since your behavior
is elaborately documented in here...

459
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,135
...it will shock no one
if I chose an alternative...

460
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,680
...to the very lenient arrangement
I have just outlined.

461
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:53,312
Would you prefer
institutionalization?

462
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,334
- Mikael?
- Yes.

463
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,086
- I'm Liv.
- Oh, hi.

464
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,879
We're going to the same place.
Hop in.

465
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,422
Oh, good, thank you.

466
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,892
I found him at death's door,
halfway up the hill.

467
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,020
- I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape.
- It's a climb for anyone.

468
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,606
- I should've warned you. Come in.
- Thank you, Martin.

469
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,775
Henrik says great things about you.

470
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,946
- No, no. Leave your shoes on.
- Martin? Smells wonderful.

471
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,032
- What are we drinking?
- What a place. Look at that view.

472
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,869
I used to work in the company's
petrochemical division in Göteborg.

473
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,579
When it was sold, I went with it.

474
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,039
A dark day.

475
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,626
I live in Hong Kong, but come back
to Stockholm for family events.

476
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,212
And I drive up to spend
a couple of days with Martin.

477
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,216
- It's just the moose steak she wants.
- Who can blame her? It's wonderful.

478
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,096
Something's left open.
Do you like this wine...

479
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:13,058
- ...or you want to try something else?
- No, no, it's fine.

480
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,565
You're writing a book now,
Martin said.

481
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,359
- Henrik's biography.
- I love Henrik. He's fascinating.

482
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,819
Martin too.

483
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:27,197
Together they are the old Sweden
and the new.

484
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,615
Yes, they are.

485
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,745
You know about Harriet, right?

486
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,456
- You don't?
- Yes, I do.

487
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,419
The family doesn't want to talk about it,
but it can't be swept under the rug.

488
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,504
- What can't?
- Harriet.

489
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,757
We can talk about it later.

490
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,092
We can talk about it now.

491
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,511
Liv knows everything
about my crazy family.

492
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,139
- That's why she'll never marry me.
- That's one reason.

493
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,308
I don't want to read
about that in the book.

494
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,769
Everything else is fine.
Harriet certainly.

495
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,814
You know,
everything changed after that.

496
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,317
Not just the family
but the company as well.

497
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,569
- How so?
- We're not Ericsson or Nordea.

498
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,239
But we're still the largest
family-owned company in the country.

499
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,617
At our height we had
40,000 employees.

500
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,035
We have half of that now.

501
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:17,122
And that downward slide
began after my sister's death.

502
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,962
It broke Henrik's
entrepreneurial spirit...

503
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,380
...and his heart.

504
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,967
- You were here that day?
- I came in later...

505
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,887
...after the accident on the bridge,
with the 4:30 train.

506
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,015
- I know it well.
- A terrible day.

507
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,769
And the days after, you know?

508
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:43,190
Searching, not finding. Even worse.

509
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:47,986
This event, Mikael, it has to have
a big part in your book.

510
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,303
I got a call from social welfare.

511
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,306
I've been assigned a new guardian.

512
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,746
- Hi.
- Hello.

513
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:23,373
I thought I'd come over
and say hello.

514
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,085
- I'm Cecilia.
- Oh, yes. Please, come in.

515
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,424
Can I get you some coffee?

516
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,885
No, thank you.

517
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,857
We are all uncomfortable with the idea
of a chronicle of our family.

518
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,818
It's not about the family.
It's about Henrik and the company.

519
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,195
Like I said.

520
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,783
It's not my intention to present
a malicious portrait of anyone.

521
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,576
Unlike the one
that landed you in court.

522
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,955
Unlike that one, yes.

523
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,458
So you're not really here to find out
what happened to Harriet.

524
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:10,462
I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
but, no, that's by no means my focus.

525
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,589
Those boxes that Gunnar
carted down here...

526
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:17,135
...which are where, in the closet now?
Those weren't Henrik's investigation?

527
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,431
I wonder sometimes who's crazier,
my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.

528
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,643
Since we're talking about her...

529
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,979
...since you brought her up,
what was she like?

530
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,313
What was Harriet like?

531
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:31,149
- I'm sure Henrik has told you.
- He was my age back then.

532
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,486
He couldn't know what was
really going on with a teenager.

533
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,821
You were the same age.

534
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,906
My sister Anita
was closer to her in age.

535
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,826
She knew Harriet better than anyone.
You should talk to her.

536
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,662
- I'd love to. Where is she?
- If I had to guess, London.

537
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,164
You don't know
where your sister lives?

538
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,501
I haven't seen her in years.
We never really got along.

539
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:53,171
- I'm getting used to that comment.
- She hates this place more than I do.

540
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,174
She left.
Moved to London, that was it.

541
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,386
You couldn't pay her to send
a Christmas card, much less visit.

542
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,346
I'll track her down for you.

543
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:04,683
If you do, and try talking
to her about us...

544
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:08,020
...don't be surprised
if she tells you to fuck off.

545
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,695
You're backed up, aren't you?

546
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,698
Hard drive at home, yeah.

547
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:22,701
Okay. That's good,
because this one's done.

548
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,792
Have you ever had any
sexually transmitted diseases?

549
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:38,342
And when was the last time
that you were tested for HIV?

550
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,888
How many partners have you had
in the last month?

551
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,725
And how many of those were men?

552
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,273
It's regulation, I have to ask
these things. It's a health matter.

553
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,566
Write what you want.

554
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,110
And why do you need
such an expensive computer?

555
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,571
- For work.
- Making coffee, sorting mail.

556
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,699
- I should have control of my money.
- And you will.

557
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,577
Once you learn to be sociable,
get along with people.

558
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,537
Can you do that?

559
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:14,169
Why don't we start
with that now, huh?

560
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,883
Why don't we start with me?

561
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,559
You do something for me,
I do something for you.

562
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,771
That's what normal people do.

563
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,955
I want you to have that computer.

564
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,265
Feel that.

565
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,809
That's gabardine.

566
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,984
Unzip it.

567
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:32,581
And....

568
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:48,138
I like the reticence.

569
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,349
It's almost convincing.

570
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,654
Anita Vanger.

571
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,448
- Through there.
- Thank you.

572
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:33,827
Excuse me.

573
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,496
I probably should have made
an appointment.

574
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,332
No, it's fine.

575
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,793
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

576
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,963
- Mikael.
- Mikael. How do you do?

577
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,631
How do you do?

578
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:49,301
So you're looking
for investment counseling?

579
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,303
Well, I would be if I had any money.

580
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,305
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

581
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:59,519
I'm writing a biography of your
Uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.

582
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,063
I haven't seen him in over 20 years.

583
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,524
Actually it's a lot more than that.

584
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,694
Haven't seen my sister,
haven't seen anyone in that family.

585
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:11,031
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that...

586
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,158
...so your recollections are valid.

587
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:16,202
I wouldn't know where to start,
if that was a question.

588
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,331
Well, then let me narrow it down.
I've gotten up to the 1960s...

589
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:23,084
...to the event that, you know,
changed everything in Henrik's life.

590
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,669
Harriet.

591
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:31,885
Everything that I know about that
I told to whatever his name was.

592
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,136
Morell.

593
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,180
My recollections
were a lot better then.

594
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:38,391
I'm not really speaking
about the event itself.

595
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,853
I just want to get a clearer sense
of what Harriet was like.

596
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:46,066
She was very messed up.

597
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,071
Well, just like all us Vanger kids,
really, but....

598
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,365
Crazy mother.

599
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,450
Drunken father.

600
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,202
At least her father wasn't a Nazi.

601
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,079
- Was he abusive?
- Mine?

602
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,622
No, hers.

603
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:05,460
Not that I ever saw, but you could tell
that something was going on.

604
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:10,882
Some days
she'd be very withdrawn.

605
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,885
And then the next minute
she'd be putting on makeup...

606
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:17,847
...and wearing the tightest sweater
that she had to school.

607
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,434
And then she'd be studying
her Bible like a nun.

608
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,938
No Vanger was ever religious.
Can you imagine?

609
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,732
She was obviously very unhappy.

610
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:32,737
- What do you think happened to her?
- Everyone knows what.

611
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,241
You don't have any thoughts
about who or why?

612
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,577
All that I know
is that I felt really sorry for her.

613
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,915
I got away when I was 18
and I never went back.

614
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,418
And she'd have done the same.

615
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,962
But she never made it to 18.

616
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,756
Mr. Bjurman, please.
It's Lisbeth Salander.

617
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:54,008
Hold for a moment, please.

618
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,219
Lisbeth, I haven't seen you.
Are you well?

619
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,597
I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our
appointment, I had a lot of work.

620
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:00,890
Something the matter?

621
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,685
No, no, nothing to be
concerned about.

622
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:06,855
Actually, I need another advance
on my allowance.

623
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,357
Can I come to your office tonight?

624
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:11,651
I don't work at night, Lisbeth.

625
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,612
Why don't you come to my house,
huh? Do you have a pen?

626
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,656
I don't need a pen.
What's the address?

627
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,324
It's....

628
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,385
- Hello?
- It's me.

629
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,979
Lisbeth.

630
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,522
Come on in.

631
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,241
- You like it?
- It's nice.

632
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,743
It's home.

633
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,330
What do you need money for
this time?

634
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:06,539
Food.

635
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,128
How are you?

636
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:21,221
I'm so glad you decided
to come and visit.

637
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,431
I just want my money.

638
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,267
Well, let's see if we can
help you out with that.

639
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,988
Wait.

640
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,658
Is there a problem?

641
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:43,785
I just want to know...

642
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,955
...am I going to have to do this
every time I need money to eat?

643
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,916
You're so cute when you're surly.

644
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,855
I forgot to ask you:

645
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:37,941
You like anal sex?

646
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:37,041
Faith is the assurance
of things hoped for...

647
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:41,421
...the evidence of things not seen.
Through faith we understand...

648
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,091
...that the world was created
by the word of God.

649
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,933
- I'll drive you home.
- I can get home on my own.

650
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,186
Are you sure?

651
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,963
- Is it any warmer inside?
- No.

652
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:51,467
I apologize if you've been having
financial problems...

653
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,886
...at the magazine
during Mikael's absence.

654
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,222
- We'll work through them.
- Are you sure?

655
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,141
How long do you think
you can hang on?

656
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,476
Six months?

657
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:02,603
That sounds about right.

658
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,605
I used to be
in the newspaper business.

659
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:07,692
- We owned six dailies back in the '50s.
- We still own one.

660
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,987
- The Courier, here in town.
- Which I let my nephew, Birger, run...

661
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:13,573
...because he can't run
anything else.

662
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,200
So, what would you say
to taking on a partner?

663
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,830
Well, we've never had
to consider it before.

664
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,708
We value our independence
very much.

665
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,419
Independence in publishing
is dependent on advertisers.

666
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:30,006
However much you have, you retain.
We don't care about content.

667
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:33,301
Excuse me? Did I miss something?

668
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,094
Talking about investing
in the magazine.

669
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:39,182
- I gathered that. But why?
- Not out of greed, that's for sure.

670
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:43,603
I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away
from you at the worst possible time.

671
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:48,774
But now I am convinced that this is
the right thing to do. The moral thing.

672
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,985
That's one reason. And....

673
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,030
And...?

674
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,200
The enemies of my friends
are my enemies.

675
00:58:57,743 --> 00:59:00,036
How long have you been
discussing this with them?

676
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,830
I haven't. They called yesterday
and asked me to come up.

677
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:05,208
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You live in the woods.

678
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:09,921
- I deserve to be treated like an idiot?
- I wanted to hear what they had to say.

679
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,381
You would've said no
before they could.

680
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,425
Well, I'm saying it now.
It's a bad idea.

681
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,970
You heard me tell them
we had six months. I lied.

682
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,097
We will be out of business in three.

683
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,975
But you don't know this family
like I do. They're crazy.

684
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,435
We're not marrying into it.

685
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:27,730
If we do this,
that's exactly what we're doing.

686
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:30,191
So you wanna say no, let's say no.

687
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,403
Instead of 50 percent of something,
let's own 100 percent of nothing.

688
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,993
- Mikael?
- What?

689
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,537
I'm leaving this godforsaken island
in the morning.

690
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,582
- So?
- So are you coming to bed or not?

691
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,466
How much do one of those cost?

692
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:59,345
Around 3000.

693
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,974
This is really gonna hurt.

694
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:06,727
Your call.

695
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,902
Vanger Industries took a controlling
interest in Millennium magazine...

696
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:18,155
...which, according to analysts,
has been in financial trouble....

697
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,701
Millennium is an excellent magazine.
We think it's undervalued right now.

698
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,327
Which is good business for us.

699
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:25,830
Well, there's another reason.
I don't like bullies.

700
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:27,665
Are you referring
to Mr. Wennerström?

701
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:31,669
I'm referring to anyone who tries
to sue his enemies into submission.

702
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:34,297
If Herr Wennerström
would like to try it again...

703
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,842
...he will find himself fighting a
company that can afford to fight back.

704
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,721
I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
He's a titan and a gentleman.

705
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,764
But he's also quite old now...

706
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:47,518
...which may explain how he could be
taken in by a convicted liar.

707
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:48,728
Three-twenty.

708
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:08,998
Shit.

709
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,184
The current archive is on CDs.

710
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:54,728
The older stuff, still negatives.

711
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,231
What general period
are you interested in?

712
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,983
September, 1966.

713
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,320
Thank you.

714
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,494
Is this about Harriet Vanger?

715
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,955
You're too young
to know about that.

716
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:16,000
Everyone here grows up
knowing about her.

717
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,920
It's how we're taught
about strangers.

718
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,181
- Lisbeth.
- I need to pay my rent.

719
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:32,475
I need some money.

720
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:35,603
Oh, come on in.

721
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,863
I feel a bit badly
how we left it last time.

722
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,448
Me too.

723
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,039
Good. You're alive.

724
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:44,213
You recognize this? I had it with me
last time. I set it here, remember?

725
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,424
And this snap, you see it?
It's not a snap.

726
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,302
It's a wide-angle fiber-optics lens.

727
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,282
I thought it was going to be
another blow job...

728
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,242
...which is disgusting enough.

729
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,620
But I misjudged
just how sick you are.

730
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,426
Okay. Here's what's going to happen.

731
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,575
Pay attention.

732
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,035
Look at me.

733
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:00,039
Once you can sit again...

734
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,292
...which could be a while, I admit,
we're going to go to my bank...

735
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,045
...and tell them that I alone
have access to my money.

736
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,506
Nod. After that
you will never contact me again.

737
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:13,636
Each month you will prepare a report
of a meeting we will never have.

738
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,805
In it, you'll describe
how well I'm doing.

739
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:20,809
How "sociable" I'm becoming.
Then you will negotiate with the court...

740
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,479
...to have my declaration
of incompetence lifted.

741
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:27,650
If you fail, this video will spread
across the internet like a virus.

742
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,193
Nod.

743
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,947
And if anything should happen to me,
if I get run over by a car...

744
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:37,826
...if you run me over with a car,
this will upload automatically.

745
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,995
Nod that you understand.

746
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:45,626
Gabardine.

747
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,797
I'm taking the keys to this apartment
because I'll be checking on you.

748
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:54,843
If I find a girl in here with you, whether
she came of her own free will or not....

749
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,764
No, not the video.

750
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,066
I'll kill you.

751
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,695
Do you doubt anything I've said?

752
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:17,324
Do you doubt what's in the reports that
have followed me around all my life?

753
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:20,994
What do they say?
If you had to sum it up.

754
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,287
They say I'm insane.

755
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:26,917
No, it's okay,
you can nod because it's true.

756
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,586
I am insane.

757
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:32,881
Nod!

758
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,303
I know it's going to be hard for you
to abide by my rules.

759
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,431
The abstinence part most of all.

760
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,935
So I'm going to make it
easier for you.

761
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,490
Lie still.

762
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,617
I've never done this before.

763
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,786
And there will be blood.

764
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,082
- Hi.
- Hi.

765
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,750
What are you doing here?

766
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:35,128
On my way to Skellefteå.
I can only stay a couple of hours.

767
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,132
What's in Skellefteå?

768
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:41,093
Bible camp.

769
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,471
Oh, yeah.

770
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,034
I'm not dangerous.

771
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:10,205
It's fine, Nilla.
Whatever you want to do is fine.

772
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,040
Everybody needs something.

773
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,625
Just as long as it's not God.

774
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,627
I didn't say that.

775
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:22,426
I haven't been around enough to
really know what's going on with you.

776
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:29,600
And I apologize for that. But I'd never
want you not to tell me something...

777
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,102
...because you think
I might not want to hear it.

778
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,771
That's what I'm doing.

779
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:37,691
It should've been me visiting you.

780
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,735
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

781
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:41,987
It was nice seeing you.

782
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:43,822
Bye-bye.

783
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,782
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

784
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,117
Thanks.

785
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,955
Oh, don't go too hard
on the Catholics.

786
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:54,082
- The what?
- The article you're writing.

787
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,418
Oh, I'm not writing
an article about Catholics.

788
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,421
The Bible quotes by your desk.

789
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,089
I love you.

790
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:41,171
A woman who is a medium
or a sorcerer...

791
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:44,466
...shall be put to death by stoning.

792
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,511
If a dove is the sinner's offering...

793
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,223
...the priest shall wring off its head,
cleave its wings...

794
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,350
...and burn it upon the altar.

795
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:59,022
- Hello?
- Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist.

796
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,565
Yes, hello. How are you?

797
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,360
Not still freezing in Hedestad,
I hope, for your sake.

798
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:06,488
You know that Rebecka case
you mentioned.

799
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,240
Would you recall her last name?

800
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,034
Of course I do.
But what has that to do with anything?

801
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,787
- Nothing, probably.
- Jacobsson. Rebecka Jacobsson.

802
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,333
And how was she killed?

803
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,377
She was decapitated.

804
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:23,046
Her arms were cut off
and she was burned.

805
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:26,508
But all that happened in the 1940s.

806
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,303
- What have you found?
- I have to call you back.

807
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:31,555
Why--?

808
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,278
- Is it Henrik?
- We were talking.

809
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,113
He rubbed his arm,
then he collapsed.

810
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:51,074
- Think he's gonna be okay?
- I honestly don't know.

811
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:53,076
- You go. Talk to you later.
- I'm sorry.

812
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:05,839
Evening.

813
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,260
So how is he?

814
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:12,929
Well, the good news is he survived.

815
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:15,057
How he does now, we'll have to see.

816
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,268
- He's in intensive care.
- Right.

817
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,023
- May I have one of those?
- You want a sandwich?

818
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,234
- Small Scotch.
- Sure.

819
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,782
Thank you.

820
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,786
I hate to be indelicate,
but Henrik promised me something...

821
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,163
- ...when I agreed to do this.
- Wennerström.

822
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:41,291
I need to know what he has on him.
Now. In case....

823
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:42,918
In case he dies?

824
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:45,921
- Well, that is indelicate.
- And I apologize.

825
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:48,632
I don't know what he has on him,
if you're asking me.

826
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,095
And he can't tell you
in the condition he's in, so....

827
01:13:53,805 --> 01:13:57,808
We also didn't discuss who I'd report
to if something should happen to him.

828
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,810
Oh, well, you'd report to me,
of course.

829
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:03,939
But we both know that nothing's
going to come of this, don't we?

830
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:08,276
- No. No, we don't know that.
- What do you mean?

831
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,947
- I may have found something.
- You're joking.

832
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:13,657
What have you found?

833
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,161
The last time I reported on something
without being absolutely sure...

834
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:20,163
...I lost my life savings.

835
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:23,333
I need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?

836
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:26,670
Yes. Do you have one in mind?

837
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,005
- I can find someone.
- I know an excellent one.

838
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,841
She did the background check
on you.

839
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,008
The what?

840
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,761
Well, you don't think we can
hire just anyone...

841
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:37,013
...without doing
a background check.

842
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:39,141
I want to read that.

843
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:42,811
Herr Frode was kind enough
to share your report with me.

844
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,230
The investigator's name.
That is her name, yes?

845
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:50,193
See, I can't find any record of her,
and I'm pretty good at that.

846
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:53,905
- Would it matter what her name is?
- If I wanted to speak to her, yes.

847
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:56,116
- It's against policy.
- You sure?

848
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:58,368
Just like your sources.
You understand.

849
01:14:58,536 --> 01:14:59,536
Okay.

850
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,956
Here's a name for you.

851
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,207
My sister.

852
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,001
She's also my lawyer.

853
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:07,544
She'll be contacting you.

854
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,381
There are things in here that can
only have come from one place.

855
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,680
The reason you can find no record of
her is because her records are sealed.

856
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:22,350
- She's a ward of the state.
- What's that gotta do with anything?

857
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,895
She's had a rough life.

858
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:29,274
Can we please
not make it any rougher?

859
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:42,013
Who is it?

860
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,974
It's Mikael Blomkvist.

861
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,730
- Actually, I'm not really up yet.
- May I come in?

862
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:52,315
Please?

863
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:02,325
Hi. You and I need to talk.
I've got us some breakf--

864
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:05,036
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you had some company.

865
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,038
Who do you think you are?

866
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:10,166
I'm the guy you know better
than my closest friends do.

867
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:16,006
Why don't you put some clothes on,
get rid of your girlfriend.

868
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:17,299
We need to talk.

869
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,227
I'm sorry, you have to go.

870
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:31,104
Okay.

871
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,204
Do you need me to stay?

872
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:49,914
No.

873
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,049
- Bye.
- Bye.

874
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,140
Bye.

875
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:08,350
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

876
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:17,484
I guess I must have alarmed you,
turning up like that.

877
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:19,944
If you touch me,
I'll more than alarm you.

878
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,613
That won't be necessary.

879
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,575
Your report, very detailed.

880
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:28,745
- But for me, it wasn't very entertaining.
- It wasn't meant to be.

881
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,581
When I write about people,
I try to entertain the reader.

882
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,750
Wennerström wasn't
entertained much.

883
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:41,174
Your boss, Armansky...

884
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:44,761
...yeah, he tells me you only do jobs
that interest you...

885
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,430
...so I suppose I should be flattered.

886
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:49,933
You gonna sit down?

887
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:56,564
He also says that you're the one
he goes to when the job is sensitive.

888
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:00,652
That's the word he used, "sensitive."
I'm gonna use "illegal"...

889
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,947
...because that's what it was
when you hacked into my computer.

890
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:07,075
No, I'm not gonna do anything
about that. I could, but I won't.

891
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,869
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna tell you a story...

892
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:13,790
...and if it entertains you, maybe you'll
decide to help me research further.

893
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:17,127
And if not, I'll do the washing up
and you'll never see me again.

894
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,213
Here, you should eat that.

895
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,424
What kind of research?

896
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:25,093
Lisbeth-- Oh, can I call you Lisbeth?

897
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,139
I want you to help me catch
a killer of women.

898
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:31,975
I've got R.J.

899
01:19:32,143 --> 01:19:34,602
Rebecka Jacobsson.
I've got absolutely no idea...

900
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,355
...who the rest of these are
or how they're connected...

901
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:40,525
...to the death of a 16-year-old girl,
but they must be somehow.

902
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,987
What we've gotta do is find out who
they are, what happened to them...

903
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:47,157
...and what these Leviticus verses
have to do with anything.

904
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,328
- What are you doing?
- Getting started.

905
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:56,040
- You can keep talking if you want.
- Don't you need to look over these?

906
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,917
I got it.

907
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:44,881
Cat!

908
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,496
How'd you get in?

909
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,799
No one has asked me about
Magda in over 40 years.

910
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:32,428
Why would a lady like you want
to know about an awful murder?

911
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:35,098
- It interests me.
- Does it?

912
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,270
Her husband was the first suspect.

913
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,648
The husband is always
the first suspect and usually the last.

914
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:47,277
But not this time.
We moved on to a neighbor.

915
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:49,279
Then a vagrant.

916
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:52,031
Once you get to strangers,
it's only a matter of time...

917
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:55,743
...before you get to gypsies and you
know you're never going to solve it.

918
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,204
How exactly was she killed?

919
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,164
- Miss...?
- Salander.

920
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:04,168
Miss Salander. I hope you don't mind
me asking, but when did you last eat?

921
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,838
I have a high metabolism.
I can't put on weight.

922
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:11,634
I'm asking because it is better to look
at what I am about to show you...

923
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,136
...on an empty stomach.

924
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:21,102
If a man's offering is a lamb,
it shall be a female without blemish.

925
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,313
He should lay his hand
upon its head...

926
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,691
...slaughter it, empty its blood
on the base of the altar...

927
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:28,860
...and he shall be forgiven.

928
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,783
- How is he?
- He needs surgery...

929
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:39,662
...but there's no DNR in place.
So it's up to the family to decide...

930
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,665
...should the occasion arise,
whether to resuscitate or not.

931
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,002
And they're not good at decisions.

932
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,712
So how was it with Miss Salander?

933
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,882
She said yes. Do you think
I might be able to see him?

934
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:54,010
He was asleep the last time I looked,
but let me check.

935
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:55,678
- Thank you.
- Don't check.

936
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,139
Tell him to pack his things
and leave.

937
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:00,683
- Mother, please.
- Don't use that tone with me.

938
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,519
Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist
works for Henrik.

939
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:06,356
- We should put this to a vote.
- Don't be an idiot, Birger.

940
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:08,858
We all know what Henrik wants.
Can we just do that?

941
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:12,487
Henrik is fighting for his life in there.
This is the last thing he needs.

942
01:23:12,655 --> 01:23:15,323
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger,
there is no smoking in here.

943
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,369
Go back to Stockholm.

944
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:23,623
When we need a family chronicle
written by a libelist...

945
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,917
...we know who to call.

946
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:34,217
All right. Thanks.

947
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,886
This way, miss.

948
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,059
If a woman approaches any beast...

949
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:46,729
...and lies with it, you shall kill
the woman and the beast.

950
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:49,065
Their blood shall be upon them.

951
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,455
My family's impossible.

952
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:06,749
That's why the company's
such a mess.

953
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,293
I apologize for my
mother's behavior.

954
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,295
I'm used to it.

955
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:14,799
It has nothing to do with you.
It's between her and Henrik.

956
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:18,261
She lost it when my father died,
and her drinking and her....

957
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:23,057
Got so bad Henrik took me
and my sister away from her...

958
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:26,644
...and left her excommunicated
in the old house...

959
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,563
...on the other side of the island.

960
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:30,273
She hasn't forgiven him.

961
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,943
You must stay.

962
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:38,448
You're the last chance Henrik has
at some kind of resolution.

963
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,491
Put this to rest one way or another.

964
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:41,993
I'll keep my mother away.

965
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,454
But please, hurry.

966
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,080
Of course.

967
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,261
Lisbeth.

968
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:02,138
- I'll get that.
- It's okay.

969
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,348
- Martin Vanger.
- How do you do?

970
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:05,767
Fine.

971
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:13,316
- It's a girlfriend, or...?
- Assistant.

972
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,109
Thank you so much.

973
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,987
- Good night.
- Good night.

974
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,618
Problems finding the place?

975
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:25,870
Everyone in town knows
who and where you are.

976
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:28,956
That's comforting. Are you hungry?
I can make you a sandwich.

977
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,333
No.

978
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:34,045
I used to have a motorbike,
a Triumph.

979
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:35,505
I know.

980
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:37,882
The five cases from Harriet's list.

981
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:40,635
And five more she missed.
Three I'm sure of.

982
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:43,846
Rebecka was the first,
just as you thought.

983
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:47,308
The second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg,
a prostitute in Kalmar...

984
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:50,311
...murdered in 1954,
matching Leviticus 20:18.

985
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:53,189
Right. "If a man lies with a woman
having her sickness...

986
01:25:53,357 --> 01:25:56,025
...he has made naked her fountain
and she has uncovered...

987
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:57,610
...the fountain of her blood."

988
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:01,364
Raped and stabbed, but cause of death
was suffocation by sanitary napkin.

989
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:04,659
- Okay.
- R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957.

990
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:07,328
A cleaning woman
and part-time palm reader.

991
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:11,040
Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped.
Head crushed with a rock.

992
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:12,708
Leviticus 20:27.

993
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,710
"A woman who is a medium
or sorceress...

994
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:17,046
...shall be put to death by stoning."

995
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:21,217
- I usually like to smoke outside.
- Sara Witt, 1964.

996
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,302
Daughter of a pastor.
Tied to her bed.

997
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,097
Raped. Charred in the fire
that burned down her house.

998
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:27,723
Leviticus 21 :9.

999
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:31,185
"The daughter of a priest who profanes
herself by playing the harlot...

1000
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:33,813
...profanes her father
and shall be burned with fire."

1001
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:35,690
Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960.

1002
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:38,234
Found in a barn.
Stabbed and raped with farm tools.

1003
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:40,528
The cow in the next stall
had its throat slit.

1004
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,738
Its blood was splashed on her
and hers on it.

1005
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:45,449
Leviticus 20:16.
"If a woman lies with any beast...

1006
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:48,995
...you shall kill the woman and the
beast. Their blood is upon them."

1007
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,371
Lea Persson, 1962.

1008
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:53,457
Found by her sister in their pet shop.
Raped, beaten.

1009
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,252
The killer uncaged the animals,
smashed the aquariums.

1010
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,254
There was a parakeet inside her.

1011
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:00,965
Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960.

1012
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:05,428
A runaway. Raped, strangled.
A burnt pigeon tied around her neck.

1013
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:09,765
Lena Andersson, 1967. A student.
Raped, stabbed, decapitated--

1014
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:12,268
- Okay.
- I'm not finished.

1015
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:14,270
We're looking for
a serial murderer...

1016
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:17,773
...but what could that have to do
with a teenager living on an island?

1017
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:20,776
She was looking for him too.

1018
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,237
Rape. Torture. Fire.

1019
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:25,323
Animals. Religion.

1020
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,783
- Am I missing anything?
- The names.

1021
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:30,286
They're all Biblical.

1022
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:32,955
The first woman, the whore,
the Virgin Mary.

1023
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:36,834
Rebecka, Sara,
all from the Old Testament.

1024
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,086
Which means they're all Jewish.

1025
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:45,259
One thing the Vangers have more than
their fair share of, it's anti-Semites.

1026
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:50,640
There's one right there.

1027
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:55,561
I can sleep on a couch.

1028
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:58,022
Okay.

1029
01:27:58,732 --> 01:27:59,815
Right.

1030
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:04,320
Oh, yeah, there might be
a cat somewhere.

1031
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:05,905
- Good night.
- Night.

1032
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,366
Harriet's name isn't.

1033
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:11,160
Isn't what?

1034
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,122
- Jewish.
- No.

1035
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,027
- What are you doing?
- Reading your notes.

1036
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:46,696
They're encrypted.

1037
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:49,615
Please. Have some coffee.

1038
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:50,866
Okay.

1039
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:54,453
Then we're gonna have
a very serious conversation...

1040
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:56,872
...about what's yours
and what's mine.

1041
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,418
It's amazing what you figured out
with the parade photos.

1042
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,253
Thank you.

1043
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:06,257
- It's too bad you don't have hers.
- Whose?

1044
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:09,051
Her.

1045
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,348
Can I--? Sorry.

1046
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:16,892
Yeah, all right.

1047
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,519
Close that.

1048
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:20,021
No. Not that.

1049
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:22,982
That's the one. Yep.

1050
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:27,737
Where the fuck's that? That's down
there, isn't it? Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah.

1051
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:29,572
And....

1052
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,325
What does that say there?

1053
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:37,621
- "N" something "R-S-J."
- That's "Norsjö," yeah.

1054
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:40,958
Then something "K."
Something "R-I-F."

1055
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,752
"Carpentry."

1056
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:45,963
Well, we need to find a carpenter.

1057
01:29:48,467 --> 01:29:49,717
Fuck!

1058
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:47,817
The carpentry shop is gone. I don't
even know if he worked there or not...

1059
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:51,153
...but if he did, maybe he used
to come in here for hardware.

1060
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:53,447
I don't recognize him. Sorry.

1061
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:56,283
Well, I had to start somewhere.

1062
01:30:56,993 --> 01:31:02,331
I'm no detective, but 1966, I would
have started at a retirement home.

1063
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:10,798
This is Brännlund's kid.

1064
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:13,175
Do you know where I might find him?
The son?

1065
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:15,719
Next to his father at the cemetery.

1066
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:20,182
He was killed in an accident
on a construction site, years ago.

1067
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:23,602
But...

1068
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,523
...she might still be alive.
His widow.

1069
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:30,651
Do you know where
I might find her?

1070
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,578
Please drive to highlighted route.

1071
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:46,083
In 1966, you were in Hedestad
with your husband.

1072
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,211
Who took these?

1073
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:50,629
A local photographer.

1074
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:52,673
You were taking pictures
too that day...

1075
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,968
...and I'd love to look at them
if by some miracle you have them.

1076
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:58,470
It wouldn't be a miracle.
We were on our honeymoon.

1077
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,556
But why?

1078
01:32:00,724 --> 01:32:04,810
This girl here. Here, you can see
her better in the enlargement.

1079
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:07,438
See, that's you there.
Just after this was taken...

1080
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:11,066
...after she'd seen something
across the street, she was murdered.

1081
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,112
How awful.

1082
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:27,583
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1083
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:48,437
Would you mind if I made
a copy of this?

1084
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:49,605
No.

1085
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:54,610
I can't give you any of this stuff without
authorization from Mr. Armansky.

1086
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:56,445
So call him.

1087
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:07,456
Next time,
fill out the proper paperwork.

1088
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,969
Which one are you?

1089
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:36,443
Going down.

1090
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:44,994
How's your sex life?

1091
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:48,831
I didn't care much
for your last report.

1092
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:51,875
It felt perfunctory,
like your heart wasn't in it.

1093
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:55,212
Let's see a little more enthusiasm
for my recovery in next month's.

1094
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,007
Don't speak. I don't want to hear
your voice, just nod.

1095
01:33:58,174 --> 01:34:00,175
Start looking for a shrink
you can bribe...

1096
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:04,179
...to swear under oath he can find
absolutely nothing wrong with me.

1097
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,515
And stop visiting
tattoo-removal websites.

1098
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:08,350
Or I'll do it again...

1099
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:11,437
...right here.

1100
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:02,191
- Is that dental floss?
- Yes.

1101
01:37:05,695 --> 01:37:07,738
You're gonna sterilize that, right?

1102
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:13,702
Couldn't we just use tape
or something?

1103
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,245
No.

1104
01:37:16,623 --> 01:37:17,664
What?

1105
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:22,920
Thank you. Jesus!

1106
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:25,756
- Drink.
- Okay.

1107
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:29,593
Just be careful. It's my eye.

1108
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:32,387
- Don't move.
- You're not a doctor.

1109
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:49,071
- Take off your wet clothes.
- What?

1110
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:52,407
Yeah. Thank you.

1111
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:57,454
Yeah, I think it's stopped bleeding.

1112
01:37:57,622 --> 01:38:00,374
It still fucking hurts, though.

1113
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:06,004
Madness.

1114
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:17,099
I mean, madness.
This is fucking madness.

1115
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:22,437
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

1116
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:28,944
Jesus, that hurts. Fuck.

1117
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:38,620
This is insane.
I mean, these people--

1118
01:38:38,955 --> 01:38:42,165
Somebody was shooting at me.
I mean, it wasn't an accident.

1119
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:44,334
No one's shooting at you now.

1120
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,798
You know, I'm pretty sure
this is a bad idea.

1121
01:38:49,966 --> 01:38:51,091
Why?

1122
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:53,302
I'm old and we work together--

1123
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:55,762
You work with what's-her-name
and that's worked out for you.

1124
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:59,266
Yeah, well, I do have some standards,
believe it or not.

1125
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:01,435
You need to stop talking.

1126
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,820
Oh, shit.

1127
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:47,689
Do you want me to open a window?

1128
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:17,719
- I like working with you.
- I like working with you too.

1129
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:27,521
- It could have been a stray shot.
- Not by Gunnar.

1130
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:29,815
If he wanted to shoot him,
he wouldn't be here.

1131
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:32,901
And then we have poachers.
They shoot at anything that moves.

1132
01:40:33,069 --> 01:40:35,237
Or he's right, Dirch. What if he is?

1133
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:37,072
This has to stop.

1134
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:38,615
Do you want to stop, Mikael?

1135
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:40,784
Look, I have police reports, photos...

1136
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:43,412
...Henrik's notes, my notes,
Lisbeth's research.

1137
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:47,416
What I don't have is Vanger Industries'
records. That's what I want.

1138
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:50,419
- Why?
- Will you authorize it?

1139
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:53,213
What, the private corporate records?
Well, how far back?

1140
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:56,425
Henrik said I could have access
to everything. This is what I need.

1141
01:40:56,592 --> 01:41:00,137
- That's not what he meant.
- I'll sign a nondisclosure statement.

1142
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:01,638
Just a minute.

1143
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:05,934
I think Henrik would say yes.

1144
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:10,897
That's why he has me. To protect
him from himself. It's insane.

1145
01:41:11,274 --> 01:41:12,441
What have we got to hide?

1146
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:16,319
After 120 years of business,
probably a lot.

1147
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:19,531
If this is what he needs to finish,
he should have permission.

1148
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,620
What am I looking for?

1149
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:28,290
Any connections between
Vanger Industries...

1150
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:31,209
...and the towns
where the women were killed.

1151
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:33,795
And everything about Frode.

1152
01:42:25,807 --> 01:42:29,559
Your father was taking pictures
that day that no one has seen.

1153
01:42:29,727 --> 01:42:32,270
- I'd like to take a look at them.
- So ask him.

1154
01:42:32,438 --> 01:42:35,440
- I was wondering if you could do that.
- I don't speak to him.

1155
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:37,442
Could you make an exception
in my case?

1156
01:42:37,902 --> 01:42:40,028
Are you afraid to be
in the same room with him?

1157
01:42:40,196 --> 01:42:41,988
I'm not saying you shouldn't be.

1158
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:43,740
So you won't help me?

1159
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:47,661
Sorry.

1160
01:42:52,542 --> 01:42:53,625
Please?

1161
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:58,004
- Are you finished?
- I need to know where all factories...

1162
01:42:58,172 --> 01:43:01,299
...offices and projects
were from 1949 to 1966.

1163
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:03,510
- You already have everything.
- No, I don't.

1164
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:06,847
Nothing on subsidiary corporations,
partnerships or suppliers.

1165
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:09,850
- You'll have to do without.
- Mr. Frode said I have access...

1166
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:13,144
- ...to whatever I need. I need this.
- You have access to this floor.

1167
01:43:13,312 --> 01:43:14,354
Call him.

1168
01:43:51,893 --> 01:43:53,018
Thank you for seeing me.

1169
01:43:55,897 --> 01:43:57,522
Come in.

1170
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:00,984
- Tea?
- Please.

1171
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:10,744
Sven Olov Lindholm.

1172
01:44:11,203 --> 01:44:12,245
Me.

1173
01:44:12,914 --> 01:44:14,164
Handsome.

1174
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,875
Birger Furugård.

1175
01:44:17,043 --> 01:44:18,418
Me.

1176
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:20,837
Per Engdahl.

1177
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:25,300
But your interest is in my more
candid photographic work.

1178
01:44:25,468 --> 01:44:27,677
Friends, relations, that kind of thing.

1179
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:29,638
Please.

1180
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:58,041
"Blom" or "Bloom"?

1181
01:44:58,209 --> 01:44:59,376
Blomkvist.

1182
01:45:01,337 --> 01:45:03,046
I'm not a recluse.

1183
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:06,341
I don't close my door to anybody.

1184
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:07,550
Thank you.

1185
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:09,594
They just don't visit.

1186
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:11,221
Well...

1187
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:14,557
...perhaps if you redecorated.

1188
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:17,477
Hide the past like they do?

1189
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:19,646
Under a thin, shiny veneer?

1190
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,147
Like an IKEA table?

1191
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:24,109
I am the most honest of all of them.

1192
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:26,653
- The family?
- Sweden.

1193
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:39,749
Landscape?

1194
01:45:40,668 --> 01:45:42,460
Some nice landscapes there?

1195
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:44,170
Who is this?

1196
01:45:44,505 --> 01:45:46,256
The blurry one.

1197
01:45:46,424 --> 01:45:47,799
I can't tell.

1198
01:45:48,884 --> 01:45:50,510
Oh, that's Gottfried's boy.

1199
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:52,554
- That's Martin.
- Yeah.

1200
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:55,432
Handsome but useless young man.
Like his father.

1201
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:56,683
Like his father.

1202
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:11,531
- We're closing.
- Nowhere near finished.

1203
01:46:14,035 --> 01:46:16,619
- I'm not authorized to stay late.
- I am.

1204
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:20,373
And I need access to everything,
including anything that's locked.

1205
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:24,210
Call Frode.

1206
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:36,222
Leave the keys with the guard.

1207
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:06,789
Come on.

1208
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:12,128
Shit!

1209
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:49,100
Martin?

1210
01:54:07,299 --> 01:54:08,341
Mikael.

1211
01:54:12,012 --> 01:54:13,554
Hi there.

1212
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:16,265
Your evening stroll?

1213
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:18,684
Yes, that's right, I....

1214
01:54:21,104 --> 01:54:23,022
- How are you?
- Good.

1215
01:54:24,608 --> 01:54:27,568
I stopped by the hospital
on my way home.

1216
01:54:27,736 --> 01:54:29,487
Henrik asked me
to ask you something.

1217
01:54:30,197 --> 01:54:31,280
What was that?

1218
01:54:32,366 --> 01:54:35,368
Come on in. I'll make you a drink.

1219
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:24,959
Hello, Martin.

1220
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:29,213
Shut the door. It's quite windy.

1221
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:36,095
- What happened to you?
- When?

1222
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:37,597
Just now.

1223
01:55:37,764 --> 01:55:40,099
I fell in the dark.

1224
01:55:40,267 --> 01:55:42,852
You don't have a flashlight?
I'll get you one.

1225
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:45,688
I just wasn't being careful, that's all.

1226
01:55:52,237 --> 01:55:54,614
How's the investigation going?

1227
01:55:55,073 --> 01:55:57,283
- Nothing new to report.
- No?

1228
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:02,121
Dirch says the girl is really clever.

1229
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,544
Maybe she'll turn something up.

1230
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:09,920
Maybe.

1231
01:56:10,088 --> 01:56:11,631
Thank you for that.

1232
01:56:17,804 --> 01:56:19,805
- So, what did he say?
- What?

1233
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:22,058
You said Henrik asked you
to ask me something.

1234
01:56:22,225 --> 01:56:24,226
- Well, I just did.
- What?

1235
01:56:24,394 --> 01:56:26,896
- How's the investigation?
- Oh, yeah.

1236
01:56:27,064 --> 01:56:28,981
That was his question.

1237
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:37,448
Do you hunt?

1238
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,242
We should go hunting
together sometime.

1239
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:41,827
Sure.

1240
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:48,125
Nothing at all new to report?

1241
01:56:48,293 --> 01:56:49,418
No. Nothing.

1242
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:52,421
- I can see you're anxious.
- No.

1243
01:56:52,589 --> 01:56:54,757
No, I mean to get home
after the walk.

1244
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:56,842
Yeah, well, I suppose I am.

1245
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:59,345
To have dinner with your girlfriend.

1246
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:00,805
Assistant.

1247
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:06,352
We'll have better luck with a gun.

1248
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:09,146
- I'm sorry?
- When we go hunting.

1249
01:57:10,315 --> 01:57:13,192
A gun. Rather than a knife.

1250
01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:18,823
I want to show you something.

1251
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:21,701
Bring your drink.

1252
01:57:21,868 --> 01:57:23,452
Leave my knife.

1253
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,387
To the right.

1254
01:57:45,726 --> 01:57:47,226
Hi, leave a message. I'll call--

1255
01:57:47,394 --> 01:57:50,229
You know what's harder
than shooting someone?

1256
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,731
Just missing him.

1257
01:57:52,566 --> 01:57:54,984
That was a very good shot
up at the cabin.

1258
01:57:55,152 --> 01:57:57,653
It didn't work. I'm here.

1259
01:57:57,821 --> 01:58:01,157
Mikael, it did work. You're here.

1260
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:35,232
Inside.

1261
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:16,732
You spilled your drink.

1262
01:59:28,203 --> 01:59:30,329
Why didn't you just go home?

1263
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:32,498
May I?

1264
01:59:37,587 --> 01:59:39,171
How did you do it?

1265
01:59:40,841 --> 01:59:42,216
What did you find?

1266
01:59:45,804 --> 01:59:48,138
We can talk
or we can just get on with it.

1267
01:59:48,849 --> 01:59:51,183
I found a photograph...

1268
01:59:51,643 --> 01:59:53,185
...no one has seen.

1269
01:59:53,353 --> 01:59:54,520
- Of?
- You.

1270
01:59:55,146 --> 01:59:57,022
In an Uppsala prep school blazer.

1271
01:59:57,232 --> 01:59:59,108
What does that prove?

1272
01:59:59,276 --> 02:00:01,235
You lied about
where you were that day.

1273
02:00:01,403 --> 02:00:03,362
- Did I?
- Or rather, when.

1274
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:06,365
So what? People lie all the time.

1275
02:00:06,533 --> 02:00:10,160
It also says that you and Lena
Andersson were schoolmates.

1276
02:00:10,328 --> 02:00:12,037
Lena....

1277
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:15,416
That was a long time ago.

1278
02:00:16,585 --> 02:00:19,670
Where's this photo now? Is it with
all the other crap on your desk?

1279
02:00:19,838 --> 02:00:22,381
There's a copy on my laptop.
There's another copy...

1280
02:00:22,549 --> 02:00:25,217
- ...on a secure website.
- Secure website.

1281
02:00:25,677 --> 02:00:27,386
That's a lie.

1282
02:00:29,055 --> 02:00:30,556
How much does the girl know?

1283
02:00:31,892 --> 02:00:33,559
I hope it's as much as you do.

1284
02:00:33,727 --> 02:00:35,561
That'll make it fun.

1285
02:00:36,521 --> 02:00:37,563
Where is she?

1286
02:00:37,772 --> 02:00:39,899
Stockholm. She went this morning.

1287
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:41,567
That's a lie.

1288
02:00:41,735 --> 02:00:44,778
She's at our offices
looking at more old crap.

1289
02:00:44,946 --> 02:00:47,072
I got a call
from our archives manager.

1290
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:50,284
She was very perturbed
with this girl Lisbeth.

1291
02:00:50,452 --> 02:00:52,077
I like that name.

1292
02:00:52,287 --> 02:00:53,996
Lisbeth.

1293
02:00:54,581 --> 02:00:58,584
So when Lisbeth leaves,
I will get a call from security...

1294
02:00:58,793 --> 02:01:02,046
...so I can be at your cottage
to greet her.

1295
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:06,967
I can't thank you enough
for bringing her to me.

1296
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:09,094
Hey, hey.

1297
02:01:35,455 --> 02:01:37,790
So, what do you wanna know?

1298
02:01:40,293 --> 02:01:42,586
You're a journalist,
ask me questions.

1299
02:01:47,759 --> 02:01:49,718
What do I do with the girls?

1300
02:01:49,886 --> 02:01:50,970
That's a good question.

1301
02:01:51,888 --> 02:01:53,764
Well, before, I do what we're doing:

1302
02:01:53,974 --> 02:01:56,266
Sit down, relax, have a drink.

1303
02:01:56,476 --> 02:01:57,601
I like that part a lot.

1304
02:01:57,769 --> 02:02:01,271
Having a chat when both of you know
that one of you is going to die.

1305
02:02:02,273 --> 02:02:05,901
And afterwards, I just get rid of them,
far out at sea.

1306
02:02:06,111 --> 02:02:08,737
Unlike my father,
who left them scattered...

1307
02:02:08,905 --> 02:02:12,408
...all over the place, like trophies.
That's not very smart, if you ask me.

1308
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:14,910
Well, he was a loud
and garish man.

1309
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:18,163
Frankly, he got what he deserved.

1310
02:02:19,165 --> 02:02:21,500
You can't be a sloppy technician
like that.

1311
02:02:21,668 --> 02:02:23,919
You can't drink to excess
like he did.

1312
02:02:24,087 --> 02:02:25,587
This takes discipline.

1313
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:28,674
It's a science of a thousand details.

1314
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:31,719
The planning, the execution.

1315
02:02:31,886 --> 02:02:33,595
It's the cleanup.

1316
02:02:34,222 --> 02:02:36,015
I guess I don't have to tell you...

1317
02:02:36,182 --> 02:02:39,351
...but you're going to create
quite a mess here.

1318
02:02:42,105 --> 02:02:44,023
Let me ask you something.

1319
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:46,817
Why don't people
trust their instincts?

1320
02:02:47,736 --> 02:02:49,236
They sense something is wrong...

1321
02:02:49,404 --> 02:02:51,864
...someone is walking too close
behind them.

1322
02:02:52,323 --> 02:02:54,533
You knew something was wrong.

1323
02:02:54,826 --> 02:02:56,535
But you came back into the house.

1324
02:02:56,703 --> 02:02:59,872
Did I force you?
Did I drag you in? No.

1325
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:04,126
All I had to do was offer you a drink.

1326
02:03:04,753 --> 02:03:07,129
It's hard to believe that
the fear of offending...

1327
02:03:07,297 --> 02:03:12,259
...can be stronger than the fear
of pain, but you know what? It is.

1328
02:03:13,887 --> 02:03:15,721
And they always come willingly.

1329
02:03:16,181 --> 02:03:17,473
And then they sit there.

1330
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:20,142
They know it's all over,
just like you do.

1331
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:23,187
But somehow,
they still think they have a chance.

1332
02:03:23,354 --> 02:03:25,314
"Maybe if I say the right thing.

1333
02:03:25,482 --> 02:03:27,316
Maybe if I'm polite.

1334
02:03:27,484 --> 02:03:29,735
If I cry, if I beg."

1335
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:32,738
And when I see the hope
draining from their face...

1336
02:03:32,906 --> 02:03:35,365
...like it is from yours right now...

1337
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:37,242
...I can feel myself...

1338
02:03:37,786 --> 02:03:39,078
...getting hard.

1339
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:44,958
But, you know, we're not that different,
you and I. We both have urges.

1340
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:46,752
Satisfying mine...

1341
02:03:47,337 --> 02:03:49,421
...requires more towels.

1342
02:04:11,402 --> 02:04:13,195
It might amuse you to know...

1343
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:18,200
...that while you were upstairs
having moose with me and Liv...

1344
02:04:18,785 --> 02:04:22,955
...who, by the way,
finds me very conventional...

1345
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:25,707
...I had Irina down here in that cage.

1346
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:28,919
Who is Irina, you might ask?

1347
02:04:29,087 --> 02:04:30,921
Just another girl.

1348
02:04:31,464 --> 02:04:34,550
Just another immigrant whore.

1349
02:04:35,218 --> 02:04:37,010
- Who misses them?
- Your sister wasn't.

1350
02:04:37,637 --> 02:04:38,804
What?

1351
02:04:38,972 --> 02:04:43,433
Your sister Harriet
wasn't just another girl.

1352
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:45,477
You found her?

1353
02:04:47,313 --> 02:04:48,856
What happened to her?

1354
02:04:50,984 --> 02:04:53,527
You killed her.

1355
02:04:57,866 --> 02:05:01,034
You useless fucking detective.

1356
02:05:05,582 --> 02:05:09,918
This too tight to talk?
Good. I'm tired of talking to you.

1357
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:49,208
I've never had a man in here before.

1358
02:05:55,506 --> 02:05:57,299
In fact, I've never touched a man...

1359
02:05:57,467 --> 02:05:59,384
...except my father.

1360
02:06:00,887 --> 02:06:03,013
That was our duty.

1361
02:06:04,224 --> 02:06:06,308
Harriet's and mine.

1362
02:06:20,114 --> 02:06:21,406
Hey.

1363
02:06:37,757 --> 02:06:40,300
There's a gun.
There's a gun on the television.

1364
02:06:47,392 --> 02:06:49,351
- May I kill him?
- Yeah.

1365
02:09:58,583 --> 02:10:01,668
How come a 23-year-old...

1366
02:10:01,836 --> 02:10:04,546
...is a ward of the state?

1367
02:10:07,758 --> 02:10:11,803
I'm mentally incompetent
and can't manage daily life.

1368
02:10:14,348 --> 02:10:17,017
Since when have they said that?

1369
02:10:17,185 --> 02:10:19,895
Since I was 12.

1370
02:10:21,355 --> 02:10:23,148
What happened when you were 12?

1371
02:10:27,111 --> 02:10:30,906
I'm sorry,
that's none of my business.

1372
02:10:33,409 --> 02:10:35,118
I tried to kill my father.

1373
02:10:37,288 --> 02:10:39,372
Burned him alive.

1374
02:10:39,999 --> 02:10:44,127
Got about 80 percent of him.

1375
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,677
I made some coffee.

1376
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:59,726
- Who's that?
- It's Harriet.

1377
02:10:59,894 --> 02:11:03,563
I found it in Martin's basement
among his souvenirs.

1378
02:11:03,731 --> 02:11:06,858
No, Martin didn't deny
killing anyone.

1379
02:11:07,944 --> 02:11:11,363
But when I mentioned Harriet,
he was confused.

1380
02:11:11,531 --> 02:11:15,867
He got angry at me because I couldn't
tell him what had happened to her.

1381
02:11:16,035 --> 02:11:17,786
He didn't kill her.

1382
02:11:18,621 --> 02:11:22,707
His father didn't do it.
He was dead the year before.

1383
02:11:23,709 --> 02:11:27,462
What if she did somehow manage
to get away?

1384
02:11:28,464 --> 02:11:29,548
I mean, if...

1385
02:11:31,133 --> 02:11:33,510
...she is still alive...

1386
02:11:34,804 --> 02:11:38,974
...then there's only one person in this
family who'd know where she is.

1387
02:12:07,211 --> 02:12:08,420
Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.

1388
02:12:28,733 --> 02:12:30,317
Your turn.

1389
02:12:30,818 --> 02:12:32,277
Right.

1390
02:12:33,112 --> 02:12:34,487
Here.

1391
02:12:51,797 --> 02:12:54,883
Hi. Look, I'm sorry to bother you.

1392
02:12:55,051 --> 02:12:56,134
What do you want?

1393
02:12:56,302 --> 02:12:57,677
- Has no one called you?
- About?

1394
02:12:58,137 --> 02:12:59,638
Your cousin Martin.

1395
02:13:01,265 --> 02:13:04,476
- What about him?
- He died in a car accident...

1396
02:13:04,644 --> 02:13:07,479
...last Thursday. There's going
to be a memorial in Hedestad.

1397
02:13:07,647 --> 02:13:10,273
I'm not interested in any memorial.

1398
02:13:10,441 --> 02:13:12,734
- Well, I understand.
- What do you understand?

1399
02:13:12,902 --> 02:13:15,570
Well, that you don't care
very much for your family.

1400
02:13:15,738 --> 02:13:19,074
- Look, I just thought you should know.
- Now I know.

1401
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:30,418
How'd it go?

1402
02:13:30,586 --> 02:13:32,420
Okay, I think.

1403
02:13:32,588 --> 02:13:33,922
She's on.

1404
02:13:42,306 --> 02:13:43,807
And she's shopping.

1405
02:13:53,776 --> 02:13:55,902
She's still playing solitaire?

1406
02:13:56,195 --> 02:13:58,279
- And she hasn't called anyone?
- No.

1407
02:13:58,489 --> 02:14:00,699
We have her cell phone too?

1408
02:14:02,034 --> 02:14:04,327
I was so sure
she was gonna lead us to her.

1409
02:14:04,495 --> 02:14:06,871
Put your hand back in my shirt.

1410
02:14:09,834 --> 02:14:12,252
There's only one reason
she hasn't called Harriet.

1411
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:15,797
She can't. Because Harriet is dead.

1412
02:14:17,591 --> 02:14:19,092
I was just thinking that--

1413
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:21,428
- Just one second.
- Okay.

1414
02:14:35,234 --> 02:14:37,318
What were you going to say?

1415
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:41,322
I was just thinking,
there could be one other possibility.

1416
02:14:48,372 --> 02:14:49,748
Well, we could, absolutely.

1417
02:14:52,042 --> 02:14:53,251
What is it now?

1418
02:14:53,419 --> 02:14:56,045
Before he died,
your brother hung me from a hook...

1419
02:14:58,632 --> 02:15:00,091
...Harriet.

1420
02:15:03,262 --> 02:15:04,804
So you sent the flowers.

1421
02:15:04,972 --> 02:15:07,015
Yes, I did.

1422
02:15:07,183 --> 02:15:10,894
We found in the Swedish Family
Registry that Anita was married.

1423
02:15:11,061 --> 02:15:14,105
- But the family never knew, did they?
- No.

1424
02:15:14,273 --> 02:15:17,734
So I'm guessing she then came here
on her married-name passport...

1425
02:15:17,902 --> 02:15:20,153
...and you followed
on her maiden-name passport.

1426
02:15:20,321 --> 02:15:22,697
No, actually,
it was the other way around.

1427
02:15:22,865 --> 02:15:27,035
She thought that it was safer
if I traveled with Spencer myself.

1428
02:15:27,203 --> 02:15:29,496
Well, what did he think about that?

1429
02:15:29,663 --> 02:15:32,665
Nothing. Only that he loved her.

1430
02:15:33,292 --> 02:15:37,295
She said, "If you love me,
you'll do this and not ask why."

1431
02:15:37,463 --> 02:15:39,047
And he never did.

1432
02:15:39,215 --> 02:15:40,924
And they both died 20 years ago.

1433
02:15:41,091 --> 02:15:42,300
Car accident.

1434
02:15:42,468 --> 02:15:44,886
You found that out too.

1435
02:15:50,059 --> 02:15:51,601
Is that you?

1436
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:02,028
I was 14 the first time he raped me.

1437
02:16:02,196 --> 02:16:03,321
Martin.

1438
02:16:03,489 --> 02:16:05,114
No, my father.

1439
02:16:05,616 --> 02:16:09,744
Martin only started after he had died.

1440
02:16:09,912 --> 02:16:13,790
- Well, why didn't you tell somebody?
- I did. My mother.

1441
02:16:13,958 --> 02:16:17,043
- Henrik would've done something.
- I almost told him.

1442
02:16:17,211 --> 02:16:19,546
But I was afraid
because of what I'd done.

1443
02:16:20,339 --> 02:16:23,842
- I....
- You still don't understand, do you?

1444
02:16:24,927 --> 02:16:27,679
A year after the first time...

1445
02:16:27,847 --> 02:16:32,350
...and there were many times
during that year...

1446
02:16:33,143 --> 02:16:36,646
...my father got drunker
than usual one night...

1447
02:16:37,731 --> 02:16:43,695
...and he started bragging
about the women he'd killed.

1448
02:16:43,863 --> 02:16:47,031
He quoted from the Bible
as he tore my clothes off.

1449
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:50,451
He tied a belt around my neck.

1450
02:16:50,619 --> 02:16:53,037
He wanted to kill me.

1451
02:16:54,957 --> 02:16:57,250
I got out of the house.

1452
02:16:58,502 --> 02:16:59,627
I went down to the dock.

1453
02:16:59,962 --> 02:17:02,881
He came staggering after me.

1454
02:17:04,508 --> 02:17:06,676
I could never fight him off
in a small space...

1455
02:17:07,136 --> 02:17:09,721
...but out in the open...

1456
02:17:10,264 --> 02:17:13,224
...I was strong enough
to deal with an old drunk.

1457
02:17:16,729 --> 02:17:18,897
When it was over...

1458
02:17:20,149 --> 02:17:24,986
...I looked up and Martin was
standing there, staring at me.

1459
02:17:25,613 --> 02:17:30,658
And all I'd accomplished was
substitute one for another.

1460
02:17:33,203 --> 02:17:37,832
A couple of months later, Henrik
sent Martin to school in Uppsala.

1461
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:43,171
And I thought that maybe, just maybe,
the nightmare was finally over.

1462
02:17:44,548 --> 02:17:47,967
And then I saw him
the day of the parade...

1463
02:17:48,427 --> 02:17:50,094
...across the street.

1464
02:17:51,055 --> 02:17:55,558
And I knew
that it would never be over.

1465
02:17:56,018 --> 02:17:57,435
So how did you escape?

1466
02:17:57,728 --> 02:18:00,104
Anita. She....

1467
02:18:00,648 --> 02:18:03,316
She insisted
that I leave everything behind.

1468
02:18:04,109 --> 02:18:08,446
If I took anything the police might have
suspected that I was still alive.

1469
02:18:09,198 --> 02:18:14,369
As everyone ate dinner, I was no more
than 20 meters away from them.

1470
02:18:15,371 --> 02:18:19,040
I spent the night there.
That's when the search started.

1471
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:22,377
In the morning, she came to get me.

1472
02:18:23,671 --> 02:18:27,256
I'd grown up with that bridge
as my link to home...

1473
02:18:28,008 --> 02:18:29,467
...but all I could think is...

1474
02:18:30,678 --> 02:18:32,887
...if I could just
get away from them...

1475
02:18:34,390 --> 02:18:36,641
...just get past the police...

1476
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:39,268
...then I might be safe.

1477
02:18:42,481 --> 02:18:43,648
And I was.

1478
02:18:44,858 --> 02:18:46,693
Until you showed up.

1479
02:18:48,237 --> 02:18:49,529
You're safe now.

1480
02:18:52,324 --> 02:18:53,992
How did you get away?

1481
02:18:55,744 --> 02:18:57,829
Someone saved me too.

1482
02:19:10,718 --> 02:19:12,176
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

1483
02:19:12,344 --> 02:19:13,928
Thank you, Anna.

1484
02:19:15,431 --> 02:19:18,516
I made you a promise...

1485
02:19:19,852 --> 02:19:23,271
...whether you found anything or not.

1486
02:19:27,026 --> 02:19:29,652
So, what do you have to tell me?

1487
02:19:41,373 --> 02:19:43,082
What's this?

1488
02:20:00,350 --> 02:20:02,393
Hello, Henrik.

1489
02:20:21,330 --> 02:20:24,749
I barely remember Wennerström
working here, much less being fired.

1490
02:20:24,917 --> 02:20:27,043
How could you?
It was such a long time ago...

1491
02:20:27,211 --> 02:20:30,713
...which is kind of more to the point than
the money he embezzled from you.

1492
02:20:30,881 --> 02:20:33,341
You're referring
to the statute of limitations...

1493
02:20:33,509 --> 02:20:36,552
...but I had no idea this is what
Henrik was holding out.

1494
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:39,388
If I had, I never would've let him
bring you up here.

1495
02:20:39,598 --> 02:20:41,099
He wasn't trying to deceive you.

1496
02:20:41,266 --> 02:20:43,976
He knows you can't try somebody
35 years after the event.

1497
02:20:44,144 --> 02:20:47,688
- I like Henrik, but he knows that.
- A man's reputation means something.

1498
02:20:47,856 --> 02:20:50,775
He believes that. He thought
you could destroy Wennerström...

1499
02:20:50,943 --> 02:20:54,028
- ...in the court of public opinion.
- The court of public opinion...

1500
02:20:54,196 --> 02:20:57,198
- ...celebrates people's bad behavior.
- He's an elderly man.

1501
02:20:57,366 --> 02:20:59,909
He promised me
Wennerström's carcass on a plate.

1502
02:21:00,077 --> 02:21:01,953
This isn't even the plate.

1503
02:21:02,121 --> 02:21:05,373
- I can't do anything with this.
- Yes, of course.

1504
02:21:08,794 --> 02:21:11,129
What happened with Wennerström?

1505
02:21:11,463 --> 02:21:12,630
How did he get you?

1506
02:21:13,382 --> 02:21:18,136
I was stupid. I heard something.
I got it from an anonymous source...

1507
02:21:18,303 --> 02:21:21,430
...who I'm now sure
was one of Wennerström's lackeys.

1508
02:21:22,808 --> 02:21:24,142
It was fake.

1509
02:21:24,476 --> 02:21:26,811
Which he easily proved in court.

1510
02:21:26,979 --> 02:21:29,647
You were emphatic
that the way I looked into your life...

1511
02:21:29,815 --> 02:21:33,151
...was illegal and immoral. Would you
feel the same about Wennerström?

1512
02:21:33,318 --> 02:21:36,154
- Go on.
- I did some work on my own on him...

1513
02:21:36,321 --> 02:21:38,823
...before you hired me.
I haven't looked at it all...

1514
02:21:38,991 --> 02:21:41,200
...because you
and Harriet-fucking-Vanger...

1515
02:21:41,368 --> 02:21:42,493
...have kept me busy.

1516
02:21:44,329 --> 02:21:45,913
But I may have something.

1517
02:21:46,290 --> 02:21:47,999
You may have something?

1518
02:21:49,334 --> 02:21:50,501
Maybe.

1519
02:21:50,669 --> 02:21:52,837
They launder money
from arms and drug sales...

1520
02:21:53,005 --> 02:21:54,839
...and crime syndicates in Russia.

1521
02:21:55,132 --> 02:21:58,176
And that money accounts for all
but 5 percent of his holdings.

1522
02:21:58,343 --> 02:22:00,720
The rest ends up in accounts
in the Cayman Islands.

1523
02:22:00,929 --> 02:22:03,848
- And how do you know this?
- This time you don't want to know.

1524
02:22:04,016 --> 02:22:06,142
This time I do want to know.

1525
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:08,227
I have access to his computer.

1526
02:22:08,854 --> 02:22:12,023
- And his accountant's and lawyer's.
- And how do you have that?

1527
02:22:12,191 --> 02:22:14,025
I could've gotten it from a source
inside the company.

1528
02:22:14,193 --> 02:22:16,027
- You didn't.
- But that's what you'll say.

1529
02:22:16,195 --> 02:22:17,987
And what will you say to me?

1530
02:22:18,155 --> 02:22:20,239
Well, that depends
if you really want to know.

1531
02:22:20,407 --> 02:22:23,367
I do.
Mikael, how did you get access?

1532
02:22:35,380 --> 02:22:37,548
Financial journalist
Mikael Blomkvist...

1533
02:22:37,716 --> 02:22:40,218
...who, this time last year
was convicted of libel...

1534
02:22:40,385 --> 02:22:41,844
...in a Stockholm courtroom...

1535
02:22:42,012 --> 02:22:44,347
...doesn't seem to have learned
from his mistakes.

1536
02:22:44,514 --> 02:22:46,098
Or maybe he has.

1537
02:22:46,266 --> 02:22:49,393
In the current issue of Millennium
magazine, he now charges...

1538
02:22:49,561 --> 02:22:52,230
...the company that sued him,
the Wennerström Group...

1539
02:22:52,397 --> 02:22:53,564
The shit hits the fan.

1540
02:22:53,732 --> 02:22:56,567
...of criminal activities
on a global scale.

1541
02:22:56,735 --> 02:22:58,027
What happens now?

1542
02:22:58,195 --> 02:23:01,364
Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta,
which won't wash.

1543
02:23:01,531 --> 02:23:04,075
The police will investigate,
Fl will investigate.

1544
02:23:04,243 --> 02:23:06,702
It'll go to court.
Maybe he'll go to prison.

1545
02:23:07,496 --> 02:23:09,205
You think?

1546
02:23:09,373 --> 02:23:10,414
Probably not.

1547
02:23:11,124 --> 02:23:12,917
These guys never do.

1548
02:23:25,180 --> 02:23:26,264
What's wrong with you?

1549
02:23:26,431 --> 02:23:28,849
- It's embarrassing.
- Tell me.

1550
02:23:29,017 --> 02:23:30,559
I need to borrow some money.

1551
02:23:31,603 --> 02:23:33,104
Fifty thousand.

1552
02:23:35,107 --> 02:23:38,484
I have a chance to make an investment.
It's a smart, safe investment.

1553
02:23:38,652 --> 02:23:41,946
- I really don't think I've got 50,000.
- Yes, you do.

1554
02:23:42,114 --> 02:23:45,533
You have 65,000
in your two accounts.

1555
02:23:45,701 --> 02:23:47,868
I'm sorry that I know that.

1556
02:23:49,454 --> 02:23:51,163
You'll get the money back,
I promise.

1557
02:23:52,541 --> 02:23:55,793
Okay.

1558
02:23:57,129 --> 02:23:58,879
You want a coffee?

1559
02:24:02,467 --> 02:24:06,971
These allegations, like the last one
from this so-called journalist...

1560
02:24:07,139 --> 02:24:08,973
...are as ridiculous
as they are untrue.

1561
02:24:09,141 --> 02:24:12,643
I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court
again, and I'm looking forward to it.

1562
02:24:12,811 --> 02:24:14,186
What about his documentation?

1563
02:24:14,354 --> 02:24:16,314
Fabricated. All of it.

1564
02:24:16,481 --> 02:24:20,484
The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite
as certain as Mr. Wennerström of that.

1565
02:24:20,652 --> 02:24:23,654
If a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist
alleges proves to be true...

1566
02:24:23,822 --> 02:24:26,490
...not only will there be
a securities investigation...

1567
02:24:26,658 --> 02:24:28,826
...but an organized-crime inquiry
as well.

1568
02:24:28,994 --> 02:24:30,578
Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.

1569
02:24:30,746 --> 02:24:33,372
And we can't force him to.
But we can look for them.

1570
02:24:33,582 --> 02:24:36,334
- Beginning where?
- Those closest to Mr. Wennerström.

1571
02:24:36,501 --> 02:24:39,670
Only someone in the inner circle
of a corporation like this...

1572
02:24:39,838 --> 02:24:41,714
...has access to this kind
of information.

1573
02:24:41,882 --> 02:24:44,216
Mr. Wennerström isn't available
for comment...

1574
02:24:44,384 --> 02:24:46,177
...but I'm happy
to answer questions.

1575
02:24:46,345 --> 02:24:48,512
- Where is he?
- At home, I imagine.

1576
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:50,890
No, he's not.
Has he left the country?

1577
02:24:51,099 --> 02:24:52,600
I don't think so.

1578
02:25:03,528 --> 02:25:05,404
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1579
02:25:14,122 --> 02:25:17,666
Welcome to the Dolder Grand, miss.
May I have your passport, please?

1580
02:25:45,237 --> 02:25:46,612
With his failure to appear...

1581
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:49,073
...before a Security Exchange
Commission panel...

1582
02:25:49,241 --> 02:25:52,576
...a warrant has been issued
for the Wennerström Group CEO.

1583
02:25:52,744 --> 02:25:54,745
I can confirm that he left Sweden...

1584
02:25:54,913 --> 02:25:57,581
...on a private jet
that landed in Paris last week.

1585
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:00,668
Whether he's still there,
we don't know.

1586
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:03,712
He can be anywhere by now.

1587
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,475
Thank you.

1588
02:26:18,270 --> 02:26:21,230
I have accounts at Bank
of Kroenenfeld, Cayman Islands.

1589
02:26:21,398 --> 02:26:23,607
I'd like to transfer them
and convert to bonds.

1590
02:26:23,942 --> 02:26:26,944
- Naturally, you have the clearing codes.
- Naturally.

1591
02:26:28,113 --> 02:26:29,864
How many accounts
will you transfer?

1592
02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:31,115
Thirty.

1593
02:26:32,993 --> 02:26:36,287
- This will take some time.
- You will receive 4 percent commission.

1594
02:26:37,122 --> 02:26:39,457
- I will.
- Then it won't be a waste of it.

1595
02:26:42,586 --> 02:26:44,837
A Swedish tourist vacationing
here in Barbados...

1596
02:26:45,005 --> 02:26:48,799
...says he knows where fugitive
financier Hans-Erik Wennerström is:

1597
02:26:48,967 --> 02:26:51,510
Here, in this Caribbean island's
capital, Bridgetown.

1598
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:55,473
Police released this photo and
believe it is the disgraced billionaire.

1599
02:27:10,864 --> 02:27:13,782
How many of these would you like
to convert for deposit?

1600
02:27:13,950 --> 02:27:15,367
All 50, into five accounts.

1601
02:27:30,258 --> 02:27:31,884
Yes. That looks correct.

1602
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:47,710
The man who is now being called
Sweden's Charles Ponzi...

1603
02:28:47,877 --> 02:28:50,087
...may no longer have a country
to call home...

1604
02:28:50,255 --> 02:28:52,131
...but does have enough money
to buy one.

1605
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:54,758
According to the International
Banking Commission...

1606
02:28:54,926 --> 02:28:57,803
...Wennerström, a week after
the Millennium article appeared...

1607
02:28:57,971 --> 02:29:00,598
...on newsstands,
began emptying accounts...

1608
02:29:00,765 --> 02:29:03,392
...at Bank of Kroenenfeld
in the Cayman Islands.

1609
02:29:03,560 --> 02:29:06,270
That money,
approximately 2 billion euros...

1610
02:29:06,438 --> 02:29:08,897
...was then spread over
a number of accounts...

1611
02:29:09,065 --> 02:29:12,109
...with the help of this confederate,
seen here in Zurich.

1612
02:29:16,448 --> 02:29:18,073
- Hey.
- Hey.

1613
02:29:18,241 --> 02:29:20,367
- The money I borrowed.
- Already?

1614
02:29:22,537 --> 02:29:25,164
Thank you.

1615
02:29:28,418 --> 02:29:29,501
No, I quit.

1616
02:29:31,421 --> 02:29:32,796
It was a good investment?

1617
02:29:33,798 --> 02:29:35,132
It was okay.

1618
02:29:36,134 --> 02:29:37,301
What are you doing later?

1619
02:29:38,303 --> 02:29:39,887
I'm seeing my daughter.

1620
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:41,639
Okay.

1621
02:29:43,141 --> 02:29:44,475
You look nice.

1622
02:29:46,770 --> 02:29:48,812
It's Christmas again.

1623
02:29:49,773 --> 02:29:51,565
I'll see you soon.

1624
02:29:59,491 --> 02:30:01,659
Mr. Wennerström
won the libel case....

1625
02:30:01,826 --> 02:30:03,827
You got that call in the office.

1626
02:30:16,424 --> 02:30:18,133
I miss our meetings.

1627
02:30:19,719 --> 02:30:22,012
I'm sure you don't. Why would you?

1628
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:24,682
I was always such
a headache for you.

1629
02:30:25,016 --> 02:30:28,352
Never showing up with good news,
only problems.

1630
02:30:29,646 --> 02:30:30,938
I have good news now.

1631
02:30:31,189 --> 02:30:32,856
I made a friend.

1632
02:30:33,858 --> 02:30:36,026
I mean, one that you'd approve of.

1633
02:30:39,989 --> 02:30:41,407
I'm happy.

1634
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:45,035
A man who authorities here
in Marbella have confirmed...

1635
02:30:45,203 --> 02:30:49,581
...is fugitive Hans-Erik Wennerström,
shot three times in the head...

1636
02:30:49,749 --> 02:30:52,501
...in what police are calling
a classic gangland execution.

1637
02:30:52,669 --> 02:30:54,670
The investigation
into Wennerström's ties...

1638
02:30:54,838 --> 02:30:59,216
...to crime organizations worldwide
will now turn into speculation.

1639
02:30:59,384 --> 02:31:02,428
Which of them caught up with him
before Swedish authorities could?

1640
02:31:02,595 --> 02:31:05,764
Wennerström spent the last days
of his flamboyant life....

1641
02:31:16,985 --> 02:31:19,695
- It's nice.
- Your father?

1642
02:31:19,863 --> 02:31:22,281
- A friend.
- Must be a very good friend.

1643
02:32:04,949 --> 02:32:06,575
- We're late.
- Fashionably late.
