1
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,125
Ugh! This pick sucks.

2
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,250
My strap's not right. That's...

3
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,250
Okay. Okay, there we go.

4
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,541
Cocks.

5
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,916
All right, hold on.
Let's scoop that midrange.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,583
Nice.

7
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,541
One, two, three, four!

8
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,208
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

9
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,291
What was that?

10
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,458
I was just... You said play something fast.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,041
Did you read the music
that I wrote for you?

12
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,125
Yeah.

13
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,083
Do you know what polyrhythms are?

14
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,541
Yeah.

15
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:30,875
<i>I don't.</i>

16
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,000
<i>These aren't my drums.
They belong to Hunter.</i>

17
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:39,541
<i>And he came up with the band name.
I don't play the drums, I play the drum.</i>

18
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,041
<i>This drum, in marching band for two years.</i>

19
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:47,125
<i>I do it to get out of PE,
but Hunter says that doesn't matter.</i>

20
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,041
<i>All it takes to be great
is commitment and sacrifice,</i>

21
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,666
<i>which is what metal's all about.</i>

22
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,250
<i>Or maybe it's about power,</i>

23
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,708
<i>or sticking it to the man,
or denim, or motorcycles, or speed,</i>

24
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,166
<i>or the devil.</i>

25
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,083
<i>I don't totally understand it,
but Hunter says I don't have to.</i>

26
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,291
<i>All I have to do is...</i>

27
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,083
- Play something heavy, man.
- Okay.

28
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,083
Like, uh... "Rock of Ages"?

29
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:09,916
Heavy.

30
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:16,125
Play... something heavy.

31
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,541
Play... something heavy.

32
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,708
We need a bass player.

33
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,958
- Mm.
- A bass player will be huge for us.

34
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,875
- Yeah, no doubt.
- No doubt.

35
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,208
No doubt.

36
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,458
Stop. Stop.

37
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,958
That's enough for today.

38
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,416
Emily, can I talk to you for a second?

39
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,875
The song you're playing
is not the song they are playing.

40
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,208
I'm not sure you're even playing a march.

41
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,375
We've talked about this.
You have to listen and play.

42
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,041
It's an orchestra, right?
I know we're in a marching band, but...

43
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,250
I see you're upset.

44
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,583
Fuck you!

45
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,250
Fuck you!

46
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,875
Fuck! I don't give a fuck
about what I'm playing!

47
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,125
I don't give a fuck
about what they're playing!

48
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,208
Fuck you!

49
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,208
Fuck your shitty band!

50
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,625
Fucking bullshit!

51
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:07,083
- Too bad she can't play like she throws.
- I don't give a fuck, so fuck you!

52
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,166
Fuck you!

53
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,000
Cunt!

54
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,708
You can't say that in America.

55
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,250
<i>That seems pretty metal to me,
but I'm not sure.</i>

56
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,083
<i>I'll ask Hunter about it.</i>

57
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,416
<i>He's been into many things
since I met him,</i>

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,583
<i>but he's stuck with metal
longer than any of them.</i>

59
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,666
<i>When his mom left in seventh grade,
he decided it was the key to everything.</i>

60
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,375
<i>If we devote ourselves to metal,
we'll own this school.</i>

61
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,583
Watch it.

62
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,375
<i>Everybody will see what we
really are and worship us like gods.</i>

63
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,041
<i>I'm willing to give it a try.</i>

64
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,745
<i>Hunter's been my best friend</i>

65
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,333
<i>ever since he stopped Molly Levine
from pulling out my hair in third grade.</i>

66
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,791
<i>He always looks out for me.</i>

67
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,541
Skip Hoffman sucks pig dicks.

68
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,833
I don't think he was trying to hit me.
I was just in the way.

69
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,500
- Clay Moss.
- You ready for the game?

70
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,458
What I'm ready for
is your homecoming after-party, man.

71
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,333
Yep, my parents are in Geneva.

72
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,041
So bring the whole school
if you want, man, seriously.

73
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,500
- Tell whoever. Everybody's invited.
- All right.

74
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,303
- Peace out, bro.
- Catch you.

75
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,541
Hey, man.

76
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,208
What's up?

77
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,265
Asked your mom about the double bass kit?

78
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,458
What'd she say?

79
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,458
She said she doesn't have
a thousand dollars.

80
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay, well, what about
a double bass pedal?

81
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,123
Won't get the resonance,
but we'll have that attack.

82
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,916
Yeah, she said
she doesn't have $150 either.

83
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,916
She's in my speech class.
I think she's English.

84
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,458
Scottish. I don't know.

85
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,375
I heard she went apeshit
on the band teacher.

86
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,458
Yeah.

87
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,625

This is like three chords and they still
can't get it right. They suck.

106
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:18,791
Look at the drummer.

107
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,750
He's high out of his mind.

108
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:25,750

Kevin Schlieb and Hunter Sylvester?"

00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,875
"I went to high school with those guys."

114
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,458
"I could've even hung out
with them, maybe."

115
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,583
But it's gonna be too late,

116
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,750

Why?

139
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,750
Because you're pretty.
Why else do people stare at you?

140
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,666
People don't stare at me.

141
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,333
- That's dumb.
- What?

142
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,583

What's happening, man?

151
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,291
Hey, he just called you a dipshit.

152
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,041
- No. No, I...
- What did you call me?

153
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,958
I didn't say anything to anybody. I swear.

154
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,291
Yes, you did.

155
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,583
Really?

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Really.

157
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,208
That's why they don't stare at me.

158
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,166
They all stare at her.

159
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,208
Her? I could've stared at her.

160
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,416

I'm an impartmentege.

163
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,208

00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,333

168
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,250
- Here, let me help you.
- No, no. Let me help you.

169
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,500
Take lessons.

170
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,166
- You guys suck... bruh.
- Ooh.

171
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,500
I'm sorry that you feel that way.
Do you play?

172
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,041
Yeah, I have a band.

173
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,583
Me and my friend over here. A real band.

174
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,291
A serious band.

175
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,708
Not like you fucktards.

176
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,958
Got it. Um, I guess we'll be seeing you
at the Battle of the Bands then.

177
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,625
There hasn't been a Battle of the Bands
since Dave Migdall hung brain on stage.

178
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,083
There is this year.

179
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,666
Go sign up with Dean Swanson,
but maybe don't say "fucktard,"

180
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,083
'cause she's
a Special Olympics ambassador.

181
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,291
All right, guys.
Let's keep this party going!

182
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,708
Give me your car keys.

183
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,333
Come on.

184
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,333
Mm.

185
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,208
Hey.

186
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,750
I was next.

187
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,833
Hunter, I am busy.

188
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,375
If you'd like to wait
until I am done with the Merinos...

189
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,618
I demand you let us compete
in the Battle of the Bands.

190
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,208
Okay.

191
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,726
Not letting us play just because
we're a post-death metal band

192
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,291
would be a complete violation
of our First Amendment rights.

193
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,333
Your First Amendment rights
as a minor are unclear,

194
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,916
but I agree it would be wrong
to exclude you.

195
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,041
So why didn't
anybody tell us about it?

196
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,250
- I wasn't aware you had a death metal...
- Post-death.

197
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,666
Thank you, Frank.

198
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,625
A post-death metal band.

199
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,958
You're welcome to participate,

200
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:42,000
as long as your performance
is appropriate.

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,291
I had to work on her, but we're in.

202
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:53,875
Awesome.

203
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,583
So I guess we should start
looking for a bass player, huh?

204
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,125
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

205
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,791
This is huge for us.

206
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,791
Battle of the Bands is where
it starts for people. Check it out.

207
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,041
Troy Nix.

208
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,791
Jesus.

209
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:15,375
Guitarist and singer of Kiloton,
Battle of the Bands winners 1996.

210
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,916
They were gods.

211
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,831
No one in this school
liked heavy music same as now,

212
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,750
but Kiloton terrorized their way
straight to victory.

213
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:26,958
By 1997,

214
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,833
they were considered the greatest
unsigned metal band in the country.

215
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,083
They could have been right up there
with Metallica or Pantera,

216
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,625
but they broke up.

217
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,958
I think drinking was involved.

218
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,916
But you and me,
that's not gonna happen to us.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,958
This is our moment.
Heavy music is gonna rise up.

220
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,833
We win the Battle of the Bands,
parlay that win into gigs,

221
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,750
and then those gigs score us a deal.

222
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,916
Okay. Uh...

223
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,875
What kind of deal?

224
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,918
Cocks. Okay.
I've gotta get all the way to C Hall.

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,500
But, um, meet me after school.
We've got work to do.

226
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,333
Hail Satan.

227
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:06,916
'Sup, Robbie?

228
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,875
- Hop in.
- Where are we going?

229
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,184
<i>♪ You'll take my life
But I'll take yours too... ♪</i>

230
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,969
<i>It doesn't seem metal
to ask if he's got his dad's permission,</i>

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,375
<i>so I won't.</i>

232
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,541
<i>But this...</i>

233
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>This definitely seems metal, right?
I mean, I think it does.</i>

234
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,833
<i>I'm not sure my mom and dad will.</i>

235
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,291
These drums
are gonna be huge for us.

236
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,625
<i>He's right.</i>

237
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,541
<i>They're huge.</i>

238
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,125
Shut the fuck up!

239
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,333
Can I borrow the car?

240
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,916
If you drop your brother off first.

241
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,208
Your father will pick him up
between shifts.

242
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,875
I'm the best at crawl,
and I can tread water the second longest.

243
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:20,875
That's good, Earl.

244
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,041
And I can do the best cannonball,
everybody says.

245
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,041
What's all this stuff?

246
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,500
My drums.

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,625
Drums are dumb.

248
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,750
Yeah.

249
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,166
I thought you were a clarinet player.

250
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,416
No. No.

251
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,875
That was just so
I could do marching band instead of PE.

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I do that too.

253
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,333
I'm Kevin.

254
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,083
Emily.

255
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:00,958
Um...

256
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,166
I saw you on the field.

257
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,875
Yeah, that was my fault.

258
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,291
I hadn't taken my meds for, like...

259
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,166
...a week.

260
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,291
I... I take Pepcid, so...

261
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,458
Mm.

262
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,250
Do you like... heavy metal at all?

263
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,666
Like <i>Rock of Ages?</i>

264
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,791
Uh, no.

265
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:36,958
More like...

266
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,875
post-death doom metal?

267
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,458
I don't know what that is.

268
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:36,500
And the Slippers of Spider Climbing
go to Malmsteen of Gorgoroth.

269
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:43,250
What kind of girlie name
is Malmsteen of Gorgoroth?

270
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know, Dad. Why don't you ask
one of your real housewives

271
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,125
while you're shoving water balloons
into their tits?

272
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Plastic surgeon.

273
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,666
<i>I understand </i>Dungeons & Dragons
<i>even less than metal,</i>

274
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,208
<i>but it's a chance for us
to hang out with new people,</i>

275
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,541
<i>especially ones who play the bass.</i>

276
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,458
Malmsteen...

277
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,250
<i>If he joins Skullfucker,
then we're a band, right?</i>

278
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,541
<i>So we can play Battle of the Bands.</i>

279
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,500
<i>If people like us,
maybe they'll ask us to play some parties.</i>

280
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,750
<i>I hope Hunter likes this guy.</i>

281
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,000
<i>Sometimes he's not so nice to people
when he's uncomfortable.</i>

282
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,392
<i>Being around his dad makes him...</i>

283
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,541
Well, Malmsteen just can't believe

284
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,083
that a halfling rogue
would be dumb and ungrateful enough

285
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,625
to try and rip off a half-orc barbarian

286
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,916
who just saved him from five ice toads.

287
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,625
But he thinks he'll show mercy.

288
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,666
Until he remembers
that mercy is for the weak.

289
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,250
Malmsteen pulls out Hell Slinger,
his +3 great sword...

290
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,166
Hunter.

291
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,208
...and he tells Auriac Stormhollow
to shut his glory hole

292
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,250
before he starts his first attack.

293
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,625
- Plus ten, that's a hit.
- Hunter, don't be an idiot.

294
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,666
He runs the blade
between the thief's ribs.

295
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,333
Second attack.

296
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,416
Uh-oh!

297
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,500
There goes the leg.

298
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,625
And for the final attack...

299
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,250
Oh, shit.

300
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,333
Head over to Dr. Sylvester's
for some post-op implants,

301
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,041
because I just chopped off your dick.

302
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,625
Sure. Sure.

303
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,958
You just remember that those implants
are what paid for your guitar,

304
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,583
your incel action figures,

305
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,541
and all your dumbass
Satan-worship T-shirts!

306
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,500
I'm gonna go play tennis!

307
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,916
Did you see my American Express?

308
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,583
Where are you going?

309
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,791
Leaving.

310
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,916
This sucks compared to<i> Call of Duty.</i>
Kevin, see you in class.

311
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,958
Hunter, we were going to ask him
to play bass for us.

312
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,291
He says he's pretty good.

313
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,125
It's for the best.
We can never trust a guy like that.

314
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,388
I'm telling you,
she's really good.

315
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,083
We need a bass player.
A metal bass player.

316
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,166
She can be metal.

317
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,583
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

318
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,500
Why? Why is that the most ridiculous thing
you've ever heard?

319
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,333
Because a cello-playing girl
is so non-metal

320
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,000
that even thinking about it
is evaporating my balls.

321
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,708
A lot of the time, Hunter,
I don't know what you're talking about.

322
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,708
Metal, not metal... Uh...

323
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,458
Maybe I'm just not right for Skullfucker.

324
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,500
Okay, switch places with me.

325
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,041
- What?
- Just do it.

326
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,333
Slide over.
Open the door, but don't get out.

327
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,267
- Did you get her number?
- Of course I got it.

328
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,458
Then, what is it?

329
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,059
I know I said I'd get her number,
but I got her Snapchat.

330
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,666
- Snapchat is actually...
- No! No, no, no, no.

331
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,666
- No, no, no, no.
- It's fine.

332
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,500
- It's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing. You know it.

333
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,125
What?

334
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,041
Suck it, cunt.

335
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,666

00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,833
Truth to power, bitch! Drive!

341
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,458

00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah, still, they're gone.

434
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,833

to campus or anything.

435
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,956

they'll totally ass-rape me

436

440
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,458
Okay, well, at Clay Moss's party,

441
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,701
they pushed you into the speaker

442

443
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:56,375

your average suburban Nazi shitbag

444
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,458

00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:09,125

Yeah.

448
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah, I kind of look like Jason Newsted
from Metallica, the bass player.

449
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Hmm.

450
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,791
Oh, right, the one who got fired.

451
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,458
It's more Viking than Newsted.

452
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,416
Yeah, like the school mascot.

453
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,375
No. No, not like the school mascot.

454
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,458
Less like the school mascot
than anything on Earth.

455
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,340
More like a baby's dick
than the school mascot.

456
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,376
If a baby's dick grew its own baby dick,
then my hair would be more like...

457
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,583
Sorry I'm so late.
Glad you guys are still here.

458
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,583

00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:08,083

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500

00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:15,551
How far have you gone in the... the thing...

467
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:18,541
Yeah. I... I got through Metallica,
Judas Priest.

468
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,726
I'm in the middle of Slayer right now
and I'm having a little bit of trouble...

469
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,916
Okay. Okay. Let's try, uh...

470
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,958
Let's try "For Whom the Bell Tolls."
Okay? You got it, Kev?

471
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah, okay.

472
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:33,041
One, two, three, four. One, two.

473
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah. Okay, cool. All right, man.

474
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Let's...

475
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:12,125
That was cool.
Le... Um, let's try playing the song.

476
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,291
Let's try playing the song,

477
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,291
and we can see
how we vibe together as a band,

478
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:20,000
and then we'll work on
all the stage-show elements later.

479
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,083
Right. Cool.

480
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:27,208
Two, three, four.

481
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:50,500
I just...

482
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:54,583
Um, I'm, like, kind of getting confused,
'cause I just don't know what else to do.

483
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:57,541
Dude, you can play,
or you can be wasted,

484
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,541
but you can't play wasted.
It's not working out.

485
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,000
We don't need a bass player
to beat those stooges.

486
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,708
Just keep it us two.

487
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:07,541
Okay. Like, uh... White Stripes.

488
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:10,416
Weak. No, here, check this out.

489
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,541
It's just two guys.

490
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:19,375
It means that we wouldn't have to split
our contest winnings three ways...

491
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,166
Something to consider.

492
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:57,916
That's mean.

493
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,125
Yeah, it is.

494
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,142
<i>It doesn't feel
like a good time to tell Hunter</i>

495
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:08,083
<i>that I don't wanna be in a band
that sounds like people being tortured.</i>

496
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:12,166
<i>But I think it's time for him to seriously
consider the only good option we have.</i>

497
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,666
<i>No, it's a great option.</i>

498
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,625
<i>It is time to speak truth to power.</i>

499
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:20,583
We have, like, two weeks,
and she can learn everything in two days.

500
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,375
It's nothing personal, Emily.

501
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,916
It's just you're not consistent
with the image we're trying to project...

502
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:28,916
like I told Kevin.

503
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,791
Is it because she's a girl?

504
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:33,666
No.

505
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:37,000
Well... what about Joan Jett?

506
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,083
Doesn't she rock?

507
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,750
Um, the... What about The Runaways?

508
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:42,875
That's Joan Jett.

509
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:46,291
- Okay. Well, there's Lita Ford.
- That's The Runaways.

510
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,458
And there's, um...

511
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,541
There's, uh... What's her... Um...

512
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,791
- Kevin.
- Uh, what... what's...

513
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,541
- What's the one with the song...
- Kevin.

514
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,625
Kevin. Kevin. Kevin. Kevin.

515
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:56,916
Kevin, we are a metal band.

516
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,666
We are not an indie metal band.
We are not an alt-metal band.

517
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,083
We are not a sort of metal band.
We are a metal band.

518
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,541
And for us to have a cello player
instead of a bass player

519
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:06,916
would be completely gay.

520
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,083

<i>♪ Wants you to eat ♪</i>

525
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:26,625
You've gotta take all that in context.

526
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,416
Gay?

527
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,333
Gay? Our band is called Skullfucker.

528
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:32,791
Skullfucker.

529
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,958
You named it that to impress girls?

530
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:37,416
We're gonna die virgins
in a band called Skullfucker.

531
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,458
What I meant was, we're not...

532
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,500
Oh, come on. Like she didn't know.

533
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:00,416
Hello?

534
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,000
<i>- Hey. It's Kevin.</i>
- Oh.

535
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:04,583
<i>Hey.</i>

536
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:09,916
Uh, hey, I... wanted to apologize

537
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,083
<i>again for Hunter being so rude, and...</i>

538
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,250
<i>- That stuff he said. He...
- </i>It's okay.

539
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,541
I'm one too.

540
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,291
Hm?

541
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,416
A virgin.

542
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,625
I know, it's a shocker.

543
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:26,458
Oh, um... Uh, no,

544
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:31,458
I was talking about that stuff
he said about girl cello players

545
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,125
<i>in a metal band being gay.</i>

546
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:34,708
Right. Sorry. Eh...

547
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,892
<i>First of all,
that's a totally messed up thing to say.</i>

548
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,041
Well, maybe he's right.

549
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,375
No, he's not, and... you're not.

550
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:42,375
<i>Not what?</i>

551
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:45,958
Are we talking gayness,
or heavy metal, or virginity?

552
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:47,875
Uh, um...

553
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,416
All of them, I think. Uh...

554
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,041
They seem related.

555
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,416
You are, right?

556
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,000
Gay? I don't think so.

557
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,833
<i>I guess there's sort of a spectrum.</i>

558
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:00,916
A virgin.

559
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,625
Oh, um...

560
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,083
Yes, definitely.

561
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,583
Hm...

562
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:14,458
Do... you want to?

563
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,583
To...

564
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,500
Do you want to not be?

565
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,125
I, uh...

566
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,083
Y... yes.

567
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:31,291
Uh, um... Uh, do you?

568
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,958
- You know where Temple Solel is?
- On Cleavy? Yeah.

569
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:37,625
<i>Will you meet me
in the car park in a half hour?</i>

570
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:39,708
Oh, and can you bring thingies?

571
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:42,875
For your thingy?

572
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:48,333
Hey, Mom. Uh...

573
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:50,875
- I need the car.
- Okay.

574
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:54,833
Well, your father should be back
from the shop around 8:00.

575
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:56,875
- And then we...
- Mom, I need the car.

576
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,750
Fucking...

577
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,666
I know. I know.

578
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,625
We said 6:15.

579
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,791
It is now 8:00.

580
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,000
- Well, something came up.
- What?

581
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:28,750
What came up?

582
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:34,375
Nothing.

583
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:36,578
I thought it was something.
You said it was something.

584
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:39,125
Well, I was wrong. It was nothing.

585
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:43,625
I can imagine something
being more important than a band practice.

586
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,791
Actually, I can't.

587
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:49,291
But I definitely can't see how nothing
could be more important, Kevin.

588
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:51,583
Well, nothing
is more important.

589
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:54,291
Or nothing isn't more important.

590
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,208
What I mean...

591
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,375
I don't need Abbott and Costello
from you, okay?

592
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,541
I need a drummer. A real drummer.

593
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,708
Metal is commitment, Kevin.

594
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,708
It's dedication, sacrifice,

595
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,208
mortification of the flesh
and all that shit.

596
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,291
It's serious.

597
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,666
And if you're not gonna be,

598
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,590
if you'll be all "girls with cello,
showing up whenever I feel like it,"

599
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:13,916
then this isn't gonna work.

600
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,750
And we won't win the Battle of the Bands,

601
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:18,750
and then you're gonna be a loser
for the rest of your life.

602
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,333
Hey.

603
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:57,958
Hey!

604
00:43:58,375 --> 00:43:59,958
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

605
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:03,791
Hi.

606
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:05,458
Where did you learn how to play?

607
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:06,541
Uh...

608
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:07,458
I don't know.

609
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:10,791
My friend just gave me these songs,
and I practiced them.

610
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:14,041
I'm not, you know,
a real drummer or anything.

611
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,583
Are you fucking high?

612
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,458
That was intense.

613
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:20,125
Yeah?

614
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:22,000
Have you got a minute?

615
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:37,916
Are they all like this? Just pretty much
the same beat all the way through?

616
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,083
- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

617
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:43,708
Please, Kevin. I promised my sister,
and she's so psyched to have us play.

618
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:46,500
But Ray's not getting out of rehab
for another month,

619
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,291
and we're tired of playing
with a wasted drummer.

620
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,226
- Yeah, man.
- Fuck that dummy.

621
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,708
I would like to,

622
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,750
but it's like I said,
I'm in this band with Hunter,

623
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:58,958
and Battle of the Bands
is really important to him.

624
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:02,250
- Lots of guys are in two bands.
- Eric Clapton was in, like, 60 bands.

625
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,916
And I heard you play, man.

626
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:06,666
You could learn our songs in ten minutes.

627
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,625
Don't even worry
about the Battle of the Bands for now,

628
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,083
just my sister's wedding.

629
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:16,583
- Let me think about it.
- I feel you.

630
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,791
But the wedding's this weekend,

631
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,250
<i>so don't think too long.</i>

632
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:31,791
Fuck.

633
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:32,875
You blinked.

634
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,791
- I blunk.
- You blunk.

635
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:37,875
Three out of five?

636
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:41,625
I'm pretty sure
you're better at staring than me.

637
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:42,708
Mm-hmm.

638
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,250
Those your meds?

639
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:49,958
Mm-hmm.

640
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,166
My happy pills.

641
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,333
Don't you need more?

642
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:58,416
Mm-mm.

643
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,666
Lay on top of me.

644
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Not yet.

645
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,291
Let's just, um,

646
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
lie like this.

647
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:31,666
I like it.

648
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,875
Makes me feel... smooshed.

649
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:43,791
On the field, when I first saw you...

650
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:45,291
Yeah.

651
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,416
...did it feel... good to

652
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:52,166
throw stuff and yell at people?

653
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:57,875
No.

654
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:04,541
Feels good to not want to throw stuff
and yell at people.

655
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:09,666
You're my happy pill.

656
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,333
Mm.

657
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:27,833
It's only a wedding.

658
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:31,958
Look, you've got to understand something,
Kevin. We don't fit in.

659
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:35,208
You can try as hard as you want.
You can get yourself a girlfriend,

660
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:36,891
or whatever, but you still won't fit in.

661
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:40,291
She doesn't fit in either.
Why can't we all not fit in together?

662
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,833
We're not talking about that now.
I don't even wanna go there.

663
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:44,559
We're talking about you being a traitor...

664
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:45,708
Maybe I wanna talk about it.

665
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:48,750
I'm the founding member of Skullfucker,
and I say no Yokos.

666
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:49,958
You said "fuck."

667
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,875
We are both founding members
of Skullfucker.

668
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,558
- Don't!
- I am way more founding.

669
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:55,916
I write songs, buy equipment,
designed our Facebook page...

670
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,080
Oh, fuck our Facebook page!

671
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,434
I'm the founding member of Skullfucker,
and I say no Yokos!

672
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,000
- No more fuck!
- Shut up!

673
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,291
End of conversation.

674
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:05,208
No, you... No. You can't just declare
end of conversation.

675
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,491
You don't have that authority.

676
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:11,875
Fine, end of conversation.

677
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,333
And that is how you knit a sweater.

678
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,583
Very good, Andrea.

679
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:27,750
Did you hear
how she enunciated and projected?

680
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,041
Get her all the way in the back, right?

681
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:32,375
And now, Hunter.

682
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,750
<i>"Death closes all</i>

683
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,916
<i>But something ere the end</i>

684
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,666
<i>Some work of noble note</i>

685
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:45,916
<i>May yet be done</i>

686
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:50,791
<i>Not unbecoming men that strove with gods."</i>

687
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:55,875
Tennyson's "Ulysses."

688
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:57,875
You might know it from your English class.

689
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,791
This speech is about metal.

690
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,708
Metal is about what "Ulysses" was about.

691
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:14,750
Striving with gods.

692
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:17,750
Striking out for unknown territory.

693
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,000
The people that crossed the Bering Strait
12,000 years ago?

694
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:26,791
Metal.

695
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,250
That Kon-Tiki guy?

696
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,041
Metal.

697
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:38,166
The people on the Mayflower...

698
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,041
...would've been metal
if it weren't for all the Jesus crap.

699
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,333
And Ulysses, what did he do?

700
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:44,416
Huh?

701
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:48,125
Read Dante. He'll tell you.

702
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:52,708
Ulysses got together
the baddest ass crew he could find,

703
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:55,958
and then he sailed off
beyond the Pillars of Hercules,

704
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:58,250
and then he was drowned,

705
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,500
and pulled right down to hell.

706
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,541
Eighth circle.

707
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,208
What is more metal than that?

708
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:16,291
Only the ninth circle.

709
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:22,875
So... achieving your dreams
with fellow badasses,

710
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:25,375
going to hell if you have to...

711
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:28,125
Oh, that sounds great, right?

712
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,458
But it wasn't so easy for Ulysses.

713
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:34,166
See, he had, um...

714
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:36,791
He had Penelope,

715
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:41,166
Mrs. Ulysses, keeping him down.

716
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,041
"Stay home."

717
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:46,708
"Be king."

718
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,541
"Go to work every day."

719
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:56,000
He wasted decades of his life
on that shit.

720
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,416
Hunter.

721
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,250
Stop it.

722
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:02,833
But one day, Ulysses decided
he was finished with his woman.

723
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:04,416
Hunter, that's enough!

724
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,875
It was inevitable.

725
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:09,291
Sooner or later, the metal inside him
was bound to rise up...

726
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:12,333
...and crush
whatever stood in its path!

727
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:14,684
- Fucker! Fucking cunt!
- You're fucking crazy!

728
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,916
I'll fucking... I will fucking kill you!

729
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,041
- Don't you ever come near me again!
- Ow!

730
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:22,208
Not the guitar!

731
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:27,375
That was inappropriate,
bordering on inexcusable.

732
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:28,666
I completely agree.

733
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,000
I'm talking about you.

734
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:31,916
Wait, what?

735
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,458
Is that what you've learned
from your interactions

736
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:36,958
with the vicious morons like Skip Hoffman?

737
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,583
How to torment people weaker than you?

738
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:41,791
Look, I've got
some personal issues with her...

739
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:45,625
I could give a shit about
your personal issues with that poor girl.

740
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:49,666
You're going to write down
exactly what you did.

741
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,375
If Miss Johnson corroborates your account,

742
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:55,625
I'll include it in the disciplinary notice
I'll send to your father.

743
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:59,000
If she doesn't, I will suspend you.

744
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,833
Your friend's a massive dick.

745
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,208
What the fuck?

746
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,916
The fuck you doing?

747
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:44,583
You are afraid of everybody,
and instead of showing it like I do,

748
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:48,041
you treat everybody like shit
and you make them hate you.

749
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:50,708
Great. They leave you alone,
they leave me alone.

750
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,458
Both of us are alone.
Mission accomplished.

751
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:54,875
- No, no, no...
- No, shut up.

752
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,833
You need me a lot more than I need you.

753
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:02,250
Without me,
all of your dumb fantasies disappear.

754
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:05,333
But without you,
I might actually live a real life.

755
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,333
You... You can't.

756
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:11,416
You can't.

757
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,083
We're Skullfucker.

758
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:28,041
Fine. Fine. Go enjoy
your new fucking wacko girlfriend

759
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:30,375
and your new...
and your new shitty band and...

760
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,583
And<i> Rock of Ages!</i>

761
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:34,541
It's my fault.

762
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,208
It's Hunter's fault. He's a massive dick.

763
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:38,875
But I never would've lost it like that

764
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:42,000
- if I hadn't stopped taking my meds.
- It was not your fault! Wh...

765
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:48,916
No, don't...

766
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:53,625
I'm not mad.

767
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:58,583
You didn't do anything wrong.
There's nothing wrong with you.

768
00:53:58,666 --> 00:53:59,708
Yeah, there is.

769
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:03,708
The concentration of serotonin
in my synapses is too low.

770
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:09,375
Okay, but there's something more wrong
with everyone else.

771
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:14,083
You have a right to be mad,
especially at Hunter.

772
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,625
Why am I like this?

773
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:21,583
Everybody else
didn't make me like this.

774
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,208
Hunter didn't make me like this.

775
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:27,916
My parents love me.

776
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:30,833
They try as hard as they can.

777
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,708
Nah, not their fault.

778
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:37,041
You're not anybody's fault.

779
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,208
Huh.

780
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:39,333
You're not...

781
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:42,500
a fault.

782
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:43,583
You...

783
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:52,708
There may be something...
wrong with you, but...

784
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:57,416
you're perfect.

785
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:21,750
You ever get angry?

786
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:23,916
Sometimes.

787
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:30,416
I get it.

788
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:33,791
Sometimes... also sad.

789
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:40,875
You know why?

790
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,000
I don't know.

791
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:47,541
It's because people treat you
like you're invisible.

792
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:51,250
Like you're not even there.

793
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:52,500
Like you're nothing.

794
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,500
But you're more than that.
You're better than that.

795
00:55:56,583 --> 00:55:58,791
You're not nothing. You're something.

796
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,166
You're somebody.

797
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,166
I'm Robbie.

798
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:05,583
Fuck yeah, you are.

799
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:16,750
We're done taking shit, you and me.

800
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,958
Take off the costume, Krusty the Clown.

801
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:24,375
We gotta talk about this, uh, "What I did
at school today" essay right here.

802
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:27,625
Sorry, you're just a little late
with the whole parenting thing.

803
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:29,833
Get back inside!

804
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:31,625
Go bang another nurse!

805
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,833
Fuck.

My drummer's in there.

821
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:08,208
I'm going in.

822
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:10,333
No, you ain't. Get the hell out of here.

823
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:12,375
Who are you

824
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,875
to stop a man

825
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:17,708
who strives with gods?

826
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,291
That was great, brother.
Really great.

827
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:33,708
Yeah, it was fun.

828
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:37,000
You killed that shit. We never sounded
anything like that before.

829
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,958
I want you to know, man, if...

830
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:41,541
If you wanna play with us
at the Battle of the Bands,

831
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:43,041
we would love to have you.

832
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,416
Or even if you don't.

833
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,708
I mean, if you just wanna hang,
it's... It's all good.

834
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:50,458
Thanks.

835
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:53,125
Yeah, I might take you up
on both of those.

836
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:55,208
Respect.

837
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,125
Wanna come hang with the other dudes?

838
00:59:59,208 --> 01:00:00,375
Yeah. Yes.

839
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:02,416
Let me just finish up here.

840
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:16,517
You're lucky they didn't press charges.

841
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:18,125
I want my stuff back.

842
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:21,208
Weapons confiscated from a minor
at the time of an arrest

843
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:23,250
shall be considered forfeit
to the township.

844
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,416
This is the last straw. No, wait.

845
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,708
No.

846
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:34,166
This is the last straw.

847
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:37,708
Mm? Right there.

848
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:46,458
What are you gonna do?

849
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:57,666
Listen, look.

850
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,333
- The Battle of the Bands is on Friday...
- Not for you it ain't!

851
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,666
Let's go.

852
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:13,083
Go, go, go.

853
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:21,708
Hey!

854
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,333
Drummer boy!

855
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,125
I...

856
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,166
I don't have a bathing suit.

857
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:53,291
Every time I see you, you are wasted.

858
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:54,375
Yeah.

859
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:56,833
Hey, let me try your glasses.

860
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:04,208
I like these.

861
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:07,791
I saw Timothée Chalamet
wearing glasses like this on Insta once.

862
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,791
I like <i>Call Me by Your Name.</i>

863
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,500
It's so sweet, right?

864
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:13,500
He's so hot in that.

865
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:16,250
My cousin in Santa Barbara
totally fucked him.

866
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,375
You're staring at me again.

867
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:24,458
Uh...

868
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:26,500
I can't even see you.

869
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:29,250
Hmm. Yeah.
Well, I don't even know your name.

870
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:30,875
It's Kevin.

871
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,333
Kendall.

872
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:45,583
See me now?

873
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:54,958
Yo, dude.
What, are you waiting for a tutorial?

874
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:59,833
Come on, man. What about Emily?
They've got a real relationship.

875
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:02,208
One built on trust and emotional honesty.

876
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:05,666
And this? I mean, come on, dude.
What's really going on here?

877
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,750
Hold on, Tom. Kendall's a person too.

878
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,750
She likes Kevin.
She's making her desires known.

879
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:13,750
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with that.

880
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:17,000
Yeah, maybe, but Emily's really loyal.
This would ruin her.

881
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,833
Back in the day, we all got up to stuff.

882
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:21,267
He's only a drummer.
He should have what he wants.

883
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:23,250
If he's in that hot tub,
he'll have what he gets.

884
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,541
<i>A year ago,
I didn't know who these guys were.</i>

885
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:27,416
<i>But now, after a bottle of champagne,</i>

886
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,180
<i>they're all making
some really good points.</i>

887
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,250
Oy.

888
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,208
Oy!

889
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:34,333
You found someone who loves you.

890
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:36,125
Do you love her back?

891
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:38,000
Uh-huh.

892
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:40,083
Then, don't be an asshole, Kevin.

893
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:45,833
I'm sorry.

894
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,458
I have to go.

895
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,541
I have a girlfriend.

896
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,041
<i>Thank you,
Rob Halford of Judas Priest.</i>

897
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:02,875
<i>You don't turn your back
on the people who love you.</i>

898
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:14,958
I'm gonna get this.

899
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:17,708
You don't have to.

900
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,791
I want to.

901
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:28,666
Oh. Here it is.

902
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,500
I've been looking for this
for, like, forever.

903
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:38,583
- I should have it.
- What?

904
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:41,833
- I found it.
- What? Give me that.

905
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:45,416
<i>♪ I don't have... ♪</i>

906
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,250
You wouldn't even know
about Lamb of God if it wasn't for me?

907
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:53,416
<i>♪ And I don't have hopes and dreams ♪</i>

908
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,500
Cunt.

909
01:04:54,916 --> 01:05:01,041
<i>♪ I don't have anything ♪</i>

910
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:06,416
<i>♪ Since I don't have you ♪</i>

911
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:11,625
<i>♪ And I don't have... ♪</i>

912
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:20,375
<i>♪ And I don't have one who cares ♪</i>

913
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,291
<i>♪ I... ♪</i>

914
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:28,500
<i>♪ Don't have anything ♪</i>

915
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:33,833
<i>♪ Since I don't have you ♪</i>

916
01:05:43,791 --> 01:05:45,671
Listen, I've got to get out
of here immediately.

917
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:46,750
I've got this important...

918
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:49,708
We are doing
a preliminary eval on you, right?

919
01:05:49,791 --> 01:05:52,083
Let's get started.

920
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:53,250
I'm Dr. Nix.

921
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,208
Troy Nix?

922
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,291
Yeah.

923
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:05,333
The Troy Nix?

924
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:08,666
From Kiloton?

925
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:12,583
Yeah, that's right.

926
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:17,916
Dude. Dude, you guys were gods.

927
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,375
- I... I go to Glenwood Lake High, man.
- I see that.

928
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,333
Hmm. My condolences.

929
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:27,000
- So you're a doctor now?
- Yeah.

930
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:30,041
Was an alcoholic.

931
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:33,333
Place like this saved me
from a slow fucking suicide,

932
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:35,416
so I went back to school, got my Psy D.

933
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,458
Give something back, that kind of shit.

934
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,333
What happened to Kiloton?

935
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,625
My bandmates happened.

936
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:47,125
They wouldn't practice,
wouldn't learn the songs.

937
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:49,333
- So that's why you broke up?
- That was part of it.

938
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:51,750
But mostly it was because
those guys were fuck-holes.

939
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,625
They wouldn't go an inch
out of their own way

940
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:55,083
for anybody but themselves.

941
01:06:56,416 --> 01:07:00,125
Look, if you're gonna record with people,
you're gonna tour with people,

942
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:03,083
you're gonna spend all day, every day,
with them for years,

943
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:05,166
you sure as shit
better like hanging out with them.

944
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:07,166
Otherwise, your life is gonna suck.

945
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,851
Then you're gonna start drinking
to forget how bad your life sucks,

946
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,041
and before you know it...

947
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:15,416
You a drinker?

948
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,166
No.

949
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,458
Drugs? Weed?

950
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,333
- Coke?
- No.

951
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:22,250
- Meth?
- No.

952
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,083
- H?
- No.

953
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:25,250
- Acid?
- No.

954
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,541
- Molly?
- No.

955
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,375
- You vaping?
- No.

956
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:29,625
- Self-harm?
- No.

957
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:31,666
- Sleep too much?
- No.

958
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,166
- Too little?
- No.

959
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,541
Suicidal ideation?

960
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:36,541
Did you destroy any property?

961
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:38,916
Not that they know about.

962
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:41,083
What, then?

963
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:45,791
Just fucking metal, man.

964
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:54,791
I get this kind of shit all the time.
Okay, come on.

965
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,416
Up. Let's go.

966
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,208
Yo, hold up.

967
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,041
Where are you going?

968
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:06,291
You're fine, dude.

969
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,666
Now, this motherfucker...

970
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:10,833
Hey.

971
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:13,833
He's a mess.
He and I have a lot of work to do.

972
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:17,958
Which is why I can't babysit your ass just
because you like brutal fucking music.

973
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:20,000
I'm recommending you for discharge.

974
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:23,208
The board will follow my recommendations.
They always do.

975
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:26,333
- I scare the shit out of them.
- Thank you, man. Thank you.

976
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:29,500
No problem.
We will have you out of here by Monday.

977
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,375
Monday? Why Monday?

978
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:33,958
They review recommendations
over the weekend.

979
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:37,416
Okay. Um, is there any way
we could get that review done tonight?

980
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,500
Nah, no way in hell.

981
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:41,958
They're already driving home
in their Jaguars listening to Sting. Why?

982
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:46,416
The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow,
and my band is totally poised to win.

983
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,208
Okay, look, check it out.

984
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,291
Hmm.

985
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:52,291
Skullfucker.

986
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:53,958
Nice.

987
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:57,083
Fucking Battle of the motherfucking Bands.

988
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,666
Sorry.

989
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,875
Anyway, give you another year to practice.

990
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:10,500
See you around, bitch.

991
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:24,333
Nah. Thank you, man.

992
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:27,875
Hey, Clay.

993
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:31,208
Yeah, are we going to practice before?

994
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:36,166
No? Okay. No. We don't need to. It's fine.

995
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,875
Yeah, I'll see you
at 7:00 at the cafeteria.

996
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:43,500
All right. Thanks, Clay.

997
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:12,583
<i>It's Hunter. I'm not here. Deal.</i>

998
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,083
Fuck.

999
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:24,458
Who the fuck calls on a landline?

1000
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:26,916
Hello?

1001
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,375
Oh, hey, Kevin. Uh...

1002
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:33,708
No, Hunter isn't here right now.

1003
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:37,208
He... He what?

1004
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:38,833
So where is he?

1005
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:46,541
<i>I feel like this is his way
of begging me to come back to the band.</i>

1006
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:48,208
He doesn't belong in there.

1007
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:50,541
Maybe he does.

1008
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,916
There's definitely something wrong
with him. He's shitty to everyone.

1009
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,541
Even you.
You're supposed to be his best friend.

1010
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:05,250
You said it yourself, he's a massive dick.

1011
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,333
I would have never understood what
a massive dick he is if it wasn't for you.

1012
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:12,166
And I wouldn't have met you
if it wasn't for metal,

1013
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:16,583
and I wouldn't have thought about metal
for five seconds if it wasn't for Hunter.

1014
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:18,416
So you owe him?

1015
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:21,458
He's my best friend.

1016
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:23,750
I gotta get him out of there.

1017
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:29,250
Will you come with me?

1018
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:34,000
Wait, so first you tell me
that I should hate him,

1019
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:35,666
and now you want me to help him?

1020
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,750
Uh, you'd sort of be helping me help him.

1021
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:43,375
It's okay. It's okay.

1022
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:46,208
No, I can't!
Not after what he did.

1023
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:48,666
You don't have to. It's okay. I mean it.

1024
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:51,416
Okay?

1025
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:54,833
Okay.

1026
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,500
I have to go.

1027
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:39,125
Can I help you?

1028
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:41,708
Yeah. Yeah, I... I hope so.

1029
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:45,291
My best friend,
he's... he's got problems. He's a, uh...

1030
01:12:46,416 --> 01:12:47,416
A sniffer.

1031
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,625
Gasoline?

1032
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:51,500
- Turpentine, butane, propane?
- Yep, yep, yep, all those.

1033
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:54,458
He mixes them,
and his parents don't know what to do,

1034
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:58,208
so I wanted to get them a brochure.

1035
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:01,000
You're a good friend.
They're right back there.

1036
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,666
Wait right here. I'll get some more.

1037
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:20,333
<i>You four have outdone yourselves
yet again.</i>

1038
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:22,291
<i>It definitely looks like a party in here.</i>

1039
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:23,708
<i>Thank you.</i>

1040
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:26,416
<i>Now, before you tell us
which dessert you're taking,</i>

1041
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,416
<i>why don't you...</i>

1042
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,875
Where's the remote?

1043
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,583
<i>All right, you two,
which dessert are you choosing?</i>

1044
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:41,208
<i>We are choosing...</i>

1045
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:46,767
Come on.

1046
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,166
Are you serious?

1047
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,833
Kevin.

1048
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:54,541
Shh. Come on.

1049
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:56,750
Look, man, I gotta tell you, I'm just...

1050
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:59,083
- I, uh...
- Tell me later. Please. Come on.

1051
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:05,333
You know Ray.
He's the drummer from Mollycoddle.

1052
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:06,958
Anyway, he's a good guy.

1053
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:08,750
Bring him.

1054
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:11,750
You do know we have to bring you back
after Battle of the Bands?

1055
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:13,333
That's cool.

1056
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:17,000
Can't deal on the outside.
I don't have the coping mechanisms.

1057
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,500
Okay, wait. How are we getting out?

1058
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:26,833
- Okay.
- Right, come on.

1059
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:28,375
Move out, please.

1060
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:36,250
- Let's go. Come on.
- No running.

1061
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:37,583
Outside.

1062
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:54,958

1063
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:01,125

Here.

1075
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:03,583

You deserve a better best friend.

1080
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:28,541
Yeah, probably, but you're the one I got.

1081
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:34,125
I'm sorry, Kevin.

1082
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,583
Don't say it to me.

1083
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:17,096
You nearly cracked my fucking skull, dude.

1084
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:20,250
And you put a really large dent
in my guitar.

1085
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:24,208
Your behavior has been violent
and unpredictable.

1086
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:30,833
You are metal beyond reproach.

1087
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:39,250
So will you please, please, please,

1088
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,666
please accept my apology

1089
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:45,250
and come crack some fucking skulls with us
at the Battle of the Bands?

1091
01:17:57,916 --> 01:17:58,916
I can't.

1092
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,166
Emily.

1093
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:03,041
I'm not ready.

1094
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:07,041
Oh, God.

1095
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:36,000
Mollycoddle, you guys are up next.

1096
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,250
Dude.

1097
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,333
- Dude?
- I'm sorry.

1098
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:48,541
You guys have been great,
and I'd love to play with you again, but...

1099
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,208
I can only be in one band.

1100
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:55,496
I brought you your drummer.

1101
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:58,208
Is he wasted?

1102
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:02,416
I feel you, man.

1103
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,041
It's all good.

1104
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:06,583
Hey, brother.

1105
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:10,541
I've been meaning to apologize
for what happened at my party.

1106
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,416
Yeah, and I apologize

1107
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:16,041
for the whole... wedding thing.

1108
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,708
- That was...
- That was weird.

1109
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:22,291
Yup, and I'm sorry
about the things I said about your band.

1110
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:23,875
You guys are good...

1111

at what you do.

1112

So may the best band win.

1113
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:34,125
So you guys like a duo?

1114
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:37,375
Yeah, it looks that way.

1115
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:39,625

1116
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:43,708

01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:16,666
It's fine. It's cool.

1225
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:20,583
They're nice guys. The people have spoken.
This is what they want.

1226
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,291
No, fuck 'em.

1227
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:25,000
Fuck 'em, every single one.

1228
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:27,208
Who are people gonna remember? Us.

1229
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:29,125
That is us right there, headlining.

1230
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:31,875
- We were good.
- No, we were fucking great.

1231
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:34,291
You smashed that intro, dude.

1232
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:37,208
Yes, she did. That was some Yo-Yo Ma shit.

1233
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:39,458
- And your solo...
- Holy fuck, that was unreal.

1234
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,500
But what about this motherfucker?

1235
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:44,791
Oh, my man slapped them in their faces
with his double bass dick.

1236
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:49,750
Yes. Uh, yes, I did.

1237
01:29:50,708 --> 01:29:52,500
You know what?

1238
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:55,708
Let them have their fads.
Fads come and go.

1239
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:56,875
But not us.

1240
01:29:57,416 --> 01:29:58,250
We're forever.

1241
01:29:58,333 --> 01:30:00,833
Now it starts for us.
Now people know our name.

1242
01:30:01,958 --> 01:30:03,333
We're Skullflower.

1243
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:05,416
