1
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,546
Deep breath.

2
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,682
There we go. Deep breath.

3
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,351
There we go, there we go.

4
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,153
Okay...

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,987
okay.

6
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:22,289
Good, very good.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,360
One last piece, one last piece.

8
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:27,894
Okay, great.

9
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,096
Dr. Miller,
we're going to need your help.

10
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,797
We've got
a dozen wounded, Captain.

11
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,633
Apply pressure right here.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,902
You're doing well.
You're okay, hang in there.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,205
Help me turn him over, please.

14
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,639
Help me turn him over.

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,707
Nice and easy.

16
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,143
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,311
Jeff.

18
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,545
Oh, my God, honey.

19
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,647
Oh, what happened?

20
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,017
Michelle...

21
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,819
...they put a bomb on me.

22
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,889
Oh, my God.

23
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,192
Everybody, clear out!
There's a bomb!

24
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,926
Go, go, go!
Clear out, clear out!

25
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,429
Michelle, you need to get out.

26
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,365
I can fix this, I can fix this.

27
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:05,965
Blue to ignite, red--

28
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,568
Honey, please, go.

29
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,304
Somebody's got to be there
for Bobby.

30
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,306
No, no, I am not leaving you.

31
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:13,340
I love you.

32
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,177
No! No! No!

33
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,968
It's okay. You got it.

34
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,205
It's arterial!
Gotta bypass the tourniquet!

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,040
We need a clamp!
We need a clamp!

36
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,374
Please...

37
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,609
Shit, dropped it.
Hang in there. Hang in there.

38
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,710
It hurts!

39
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,945
Fuck! Fuck!
I know.

40
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,414
Almost there, almost there.

41
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,882
Push 50 milligrams
of Midazolam right now.

42
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,318
Quickly!

43
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,220
BP is dropping, doctor.

44
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,854
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die.

45
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,289
You're not going anywhere.
Lower his head.

46
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,658
You're not going anywhere, okay?
Hang in, hang in.

47
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:06,793
You're okay.

48
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,429
Hang in there.

49
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:09,662
Okay, okay.

50
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,730
He's stabilizing.

51
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,435
There you go. There you go.

52
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,103
Thank you.

53
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,938
Thank you.

54
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,942
Hey, Frank.
How you doing, man?

55
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,478
Hey, doc, you're in early.

56
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,181
Yeah, giving my favorite doctor
the night off.

57
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,551
Hey.

58
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,918
Hey.

59
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,193
Just beating myself up
over here.

60
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,463
I've been told
you saved his life.

61
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,267
I dropped the clamp,
like, what...

62
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,702
Hey, it takes guts
to bypass a tourniquet.

63
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,972
I don't know of any other doctor
that would have done that.

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,043
Afghan Combat Training 101.

65
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,213
"Think outside the box
because ISIS
thinks outside everything."

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,747
Mm-hmm.

67
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,484
But you have always had
ice in your veins.

68
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,620
I suppose that's what cools
that big heart of yours.

69
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,992
That patient
was lucky to have you.

70
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,830
You're going to be fine.

71
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,601
You were the best doc I had
over there...

72
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,436
and you are the best here.

73
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,774
I appreciate you
bringing me on here.

74
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,944
One day at a time.

75
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,745
One foot in front of the other.

76
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,981
Nothing more than that.

77
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,319
All right.

78
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,242
Jeff! Oh, my God.

79
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,944
<i>Clear out! There's a bomb!</i>
<i>Clear out!</i>

80
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,980
<i>Michelle, you need to leave.</i>
<i>Now!</i>

81
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,915
<i>Honey, please, go.</i>

82
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,584
<i>Somebody's gotta</i>
<i>be here for Bobby.</i>

83
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,952
<i>I am not leaving,</i>
<i>I am not leaving.</i>

84
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,155
<i>I am not leaving you. No! No!</i>

85
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,580
Surprise!

86
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,216
Bobby, hey!

87
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,953
You ready?
Yeah, just about.

88
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,988
Did Granny come in with you?

89
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,890
Just dropped me off.
Big day at the bingo hall.

90
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,960
Oh, really?
Working her magic, huh?

91
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,164
I have something for you.

92
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,033
Take a seat.

93
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,368
Eyes closed.
Why?

94
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,070
Just 'cause.

95
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,905
No peeking.

96
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,807
I'm not peeking.
No peeking.

97
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,543
Hands out.

98
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,412
What could it be?

99
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,814
A soccer ball?
Ah, man!

100
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,982
How could you tell?

101
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,917
I don't know, how could I?

102
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,355
Yes!

103
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:24,325
But it's not my birthday
until tomorrow.

104
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,526
I know, but...

105
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,262
I figured we'd go downtown,
grab some dinner,

106
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,664
and by the time we get home,
it might as well be.

107
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,799
Why?

108
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,401
Are we going somewhere
after dinner?

109
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,271
Look inside the scarf.

110
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,808
No way!
Tickets for tonight?

111
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,109
Mm-hmm.

112
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,112
I love you. Thanks!

113
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,351
All right. I'm gonna fill out
a quick report.

114
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,019
I need you to hang
in the waiting area.

115
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,287
I'll walk you out
and get you settled.

116
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,223
Mom, I'm basically an adult.

117
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,359
I think I know
where the waiting room is.

118
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,961
You're right, you are.

119
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,497
All right,
I'll be right there.

120
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,542
Special Agent McBride,
this is Agent Ellis.

121
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,145
You are Ryan Ethan Quinn.

122
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,782
<i>Born 1991, Limerick, Ireland.</i>

123
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,550
Immigrated
to these United States

124
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,487
with charming brother,
Sean James Quinn,

125
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,923
and the big Shillelagh himself,
Patrick "Big Boy" Quinn,

126
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,427
patriarch of
this whole sordid mess

127
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:37,398
that is the
Quinn Gang Brotherhood.

128
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,832
Quinn family,

129
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,933
suspected of
seven counts of homicide,

130
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,935
twelve counts of armed robbery,

131
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,772
a list of jury tampering,

132
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,840
trafficking, extortion charges,

133
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,342
tax evasion.

134
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,577
Guess you're the unlucky one
to get caught.

135
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,580
Caught?

136
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,582
Or targeted
as a way to get to my father?

137
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,420
Ryan, we know
you love your father,

138
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,355
you've made that
abundantly clear,

139
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,624
but this family's going down,
whether you like it or not.

140
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,025
Now, if you help us

141
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,860
provide evidence
against his business,

142
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,961
we could cut
a sweet deal for you

143
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,097
and for your brother, Sean,

144
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,632
and for your father.

145
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,502
Now, you've tried
this sort of thing before,

146
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,937
this bargain,

147
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,174
but it didn't work then,
it's not working now.

148
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,142
My father runs
a clean operation.

149
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,112
<i>Now, I suggest</i>
<i>you give me that phone call</i>

150
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,548
so I can call
my fancy lawyer friends.

151
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,550
You don't fool me, Quinn.

152
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:33,120
Rumor has it
that "Big Daddy Paddy"

153
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:36,623
has picked you and you alone
to run the enterprise,

154
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:40,627
bypassing
your big brother, Sean.

155
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,163
Not to mention the fact
that we've leaked

156
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,866
how cooperative
you're being with us.

157
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,468
That's bollocks.

158
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,003
You think Sean
will believe that?

159
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,605
You're fucking daft.

160
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,507
<i>I guess we'll see.</i>

161
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,210
Let's take him
to the Terminal building.

162
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,187
Watch your step.

163
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,103
Johnno. What's the craic?

164
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,006
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fucking shit.

165
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,207
All right.

166
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,743
Sean. It's Johnno.

167
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,981
Johnno, what's the story?

168
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,984
Sean, the Feds grabbed Ryan.

169
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,553
They're moving him now.

170
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,021
Fuck.

171
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,958
<i>Maybe this is</i>
<i>our opportunity.</i>

172
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,527
Watch your head.

173
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,462
Are you tooled up?

174
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,930
<i>Yeah.</i>

175
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,799
<i>You stay with him,</i>
<i>you keep your eye on him, yeah?</i>

176
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,401
<i>All right, good luck.</i>

177
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,578
What's going on?

178
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,080
The FBI have Ryan.

179
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,248
Christ.

180
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,716
Do you wanna call your dad?

181
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,753
No, I don't want
to call my fucking dad.

182
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,489
Hey, lads, we have to go.

183
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,624
Come on, Danny.

184
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,695
Come on, move it,
for fuck's sake.

185
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,671
It's not your first time
in cuffs, Quinn, relax.

186
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,172
Fuck you.

187
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,610
I'm just behind them.

188
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,612
We're coming up
right behind you.

189
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,714
Get ready to move in,
cut them off.

190
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,059
What's he doing?

191
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,459
Now.

192
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,294
Veer left, veer left!

193
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,430
Watch the fence,
watch the fence!

194
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,135
This is for you,
you fucking asshole.

195
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,437
Cut them off.

196
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,172
Jesus, got to be quick.

197
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,277
Jesus...

198
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,982
It's a fucking ambush!

199
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,819
We got bulletproof glass,
it's okay, it's okay.

200
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,421
Stay down!

201
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,058
Down! Down!

202
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,265
Danny, cover!

203
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,003
Fuck you, cunt.

204
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,372
This is the FBI!
Drop your weapon!

205
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,975
Fuck off!
Drop your weapon!

206
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:43,310
Get down!

207
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,857
Sean...

208
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,967
I got them.

209
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:15,976
Shit!

210
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:17,911
Fucking move. Johnno, Danny,
come on, let's go!

211
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,913
Where's my phone? Wow.

212
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,617
Get me directions
to the nearest hospital.

213
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:28,755
<i>Calculating. Mercy Hospital.</i>
<i>Please proceed to the route.</i>

214
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,792
Is that the birthday boy
I see?

215
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,226
Not yet. Think fast!

216
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,661
Ho!

217
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,165
Rumor has it,
you made the under-12 team.

218
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,398
I've been practicing.

219
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,566
Hey, you two.

220
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,136
Well, the hardest worker I know

221
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,005
finally taking a night off.

222
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:45,305
And for a soccer game.

223
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,840
It's "football".

224
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,508
A purist, I see.

225
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,977
Thanks again for tonight.

226
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,013
I owe you one.

227
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,147
Not at all.

228
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,049
Happy to cover.

229
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:56,850
You all ready? Okay.

230
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,218
Gotta sign out
and we're good to go.

231
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,920
Okay.
All right.

232
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,788
Come on, let's-- whoa!

233
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,390
Got ya!

234
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,499
Help. Medics!

235
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,801
FBI. We just got ambushed.

236
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,704
My partner is shot
and so is our witness.

237
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,440
Careful. Easy.
Got him.

238
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,111
Got him.

239
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:25,512
Here, let me get
the cuffs off him. Here you go.

240
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,183
Go, go, go, go, go.

241
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,383
IV is Ready!

242
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,651
Get them inside.

243
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,954
Coming through,
coming through!

244
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,791
Holy shit.

245
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,934
Bobby, come here, please.

246
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:49,569
What now?

247
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,272
You guys, go. I've got this.

248
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,940
Call Nurse Riley, please.

249
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:55,942
What happened?

250
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,644
I don't know, buddy.

251
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,513
Maybe you should go help.
We're still early.

252
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,115
We made birthday plans.

253
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:02,582
What if they need you?

254
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,220
Kindest heart I know,
you know that?

255
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,455
Just like your dad.

256
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,024
Can I go play in the tunnels?

257
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,059
No. You just stay right here.

258
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,393
I won't be long. Copy?

259
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,529
Copy.
Okay.

260
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,378
Luck of the Irish.

261
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,413
No luck in it
at all, gentlemen.

262
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,585
It's just a magnificent talent
that the Lord blessed me with.

263
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,487
Three in a row, Paddy.

264
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:41,822
Gettin' dangerous.

265
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,424
That was a hell of a shot,
wasn't it, huh?

266
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,862
Now, that,
I can have a little of that, eh?

267
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:50,430
Water of life.

268
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,998
Yeah, the water of life.

269
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,137
Mm, Jonesy.

270
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,072
Jonesy, I know what you want.

271
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,673
Here, look.

272
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,908
Here, there, look at this.

273
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,311
Here, here, here.

274
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,947
Jonesy, oh, you're
an alcoholic doggy, Jonesy?

275
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,583
You're an alcoholic,
but I love ya.

276
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,066
Sean.

277
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,334
<i>Dad.</i>

278
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,901
Dad?

279
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,770
You only call me "Dad"
when you're in trouble, son.

280
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,240
You're not in trouble, are ya?

281
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,641
<i>We have a problem.</i>

282
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,742
Oh?

283
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,777
The FBI
took Ryan into custody.

284
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:42,183
They have all his files,
everything on the business.

285
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,650
Christ.

286
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,120
<i>We tried to get him out.</i>
<i>Things got messy.</i>

287
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:47,520
Dad...

288
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,590
Ryan got shot.

289
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,792
What are you
fooling saying to me?

290
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,796
<i>Sean?</i>

291
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,433
Tell me Ryan is alive.

292
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:03,070
He is.

293
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,404
<i>He better be.</i>

294
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,440
Where'd they take him?

295
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:09,776
They've taken him to The Mercy.

296
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,449
Don't make another move
until I get there.

297
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,387
How many bullets?

298
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,888
One in the neck.
Ruptured an artery
from what I can see.

299
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,191
Second patient
has one in the left hip

300
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,259
and one in the stomach.

301
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:26,593
Wound is fairly large.

302
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,961
Okay, they're both
bleeding out.

303
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,232
What are you doing here?
You got a game to catch.

304
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:32,699
You're understaffed.

305
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,801
And I took orders from Bobby.

306
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,703
Runs in the family, I see.

307
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,607
All right, everyone,
let's prep OR 1.

308
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,143
Let's get busy.

309
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:47,981
He's stable.

310
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,317
Okay, good.

311
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,085
I think I got
the last bullet.

312
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:52,320
What's his pressure?

313
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:53,553
One thirty over 80.

314
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,189
Come on, come on, come on.

315
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:56,690
Easy does it.

316
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:00,860
There you go.
What is that?

317
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,264
It might be
an exploding bullet.

318
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,698
Be careful.

319
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,401
Okay.

320
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,540
Is everyone okay?

321
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,674
I'm okay.

322
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,743
Yes, Sir, ambushed.

323
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,179
It was the Quinn Gang.

324
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,679
They had to have known
we were coming.

325
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,148
It was a complete shit show.

326
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,117
Yeah, 1100, Sir.

327
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:25,353
Approximately.
Under the Southbound overpass.

328
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:30,458
I'm...I'm pretty sure our driver
took a fatal hit.

329
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,793
Yep, okay, will do. All right.

330
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:37,564
Excuse me. Yeah,
I'm Special Agent Ellis, FBI.

331
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,798
Are you with the ER team?

332
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,767
I'm Dr. Miller, yes.

333
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,372
Hi. I'm the one that brought in
a couple of gunshot victims.

334
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,374
Agent McBride,
he's the one with the gray hair.

335
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,540
How's he doing?

336
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:48,808
He's stable now.

337
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,810
Took a shot
to the anterior jugular.

338
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,747
Wow. I mean, he's going
to be all right, though, right?

339
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,749
Yes.
Okay, good.

340
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,119
Oh, and what about
our asset, Ryan Quinn?

341
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,023
Asset, huh?

342
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:04,025
Hit pretty bad.

343
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:08,129
Including an exploding bullet
wedged in his lower rib-cage.

344
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,796
Exploded in our ER.

345
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,965
Exploded?

346
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,100
Jesus.

347
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,802
You wanna tell me
what we're dealing with?

348
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,838
I'm sorry, doc, it's not--

349
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,540
It's not something
I can talk about.

350
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,376
It's a small hospital,
Agent Ellis,

351
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:25,379
we're not really equipped
to deal with illegal ammunition.

352
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:27,148
Look, I'm sorry, doc.

353
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,418
It's-- it's above my clearance
level to-- you know, to--

354
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:33,421
You're a by-the-book
kinda guy, huh?

355
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,888
I know the type.

356
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,857
A type?
What's that supposed to mean?

357
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,860
I know a rookie when I see one.

358
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,497
Word of advice.

359
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,232
Keep your head up.

360
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,967
Clearance levels
don't stop bullets.

361
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,052
Oh, fuck.

362
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,587
What are you gonna tell him?

363
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,156
Not gonna say anything.

364
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,691
Ryan was shot in the cross fire.
It was an accident.

365
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,662
All right, Mick.

366
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,900
You should have
come to me, son.

367
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:23,370
You should have come to me
as soon as Ryan was taken,

368
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:24,405
and you didn't, did ya?

369
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:26,373
I know, it's my fault.

370
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,843
You know how many times
I've had to clean up your mess?

371
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,313
My dog's shites
are less numerous.

372
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:35,949
Put that weapon away!
Put that weapon away!

373
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:40,354
What do you think this is,
Chicago 1920s?

374
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:42,822
You're making
a spectacle of yourself.

375
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,995
I never liked hospitals.

376
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:50,697
Too many people die in them.
Let's go.

377
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,266
You stay here.

378
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,400
What are you gonna do?

379
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,036
I'm going to see your brother.

380
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:59,340
The rest of ya, do nothing.

381
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:03,177
Do nothing
until I assess the situation.

382
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:07,515
Your father means well.

383
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,183
Yeah, I'm sure he does, yeah.

384
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,387
Hey, you, Billy the Kid.

385
00:19:13,454 --> 00:19:15,389
Do you want a box
in the fucking mouth?

386
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:17,158
Give me a fucking break.

387
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,792
I'll give you a fucking break,
I'll break your fucking legs.

388
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,611
Excuse me, sweetheart.

389
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,381
I'm looking
for Ryan Quinn's room.

390
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:45,386
Ryan Quinn.

391
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,422
Oh, I'm sorry, Sir.

392
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:50,823
That's been flagged
as a private ward.

393
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,393
No visitors.

394
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:53,793
No visitors?

395
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,730
Well, I'm not a visitor,

396
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,899
I'm his fucking father.

397
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,404
Okay. I'm sorry, Mr. Quinn.

398
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,905
There's a waiting room
around the corner

399
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,308
and you're welcome to sit there.

400
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,176
Oh, there's a waiting room.

401
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,810
Yeah. I'm sure one
of the Trauma Doctors
will be out soon.

402
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,446
Thank you,
around the corner.

403
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,181
Thank you.

404
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,449
Cunt.

405
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:28,462
Hey.

406
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:31,365
Think fast, son.

407
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,735
Whoa-ho!
Another five years,

408
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,771
I'll have to pay good money
just to watch ya.

409
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,274
Thanks.

410
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,810
Should I take
a quiet look around now?

411
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,880
No, stay.
Stay close-- for now.

412
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,986
You don't think
he's alive, do ya?

413
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,555
No way he survived.

414
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:56,223
We shot right at him.

415
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,891
Fucking explosives
didn't work anyway.

416
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:01,095
You know, I think Ryan
was put on this Earth

417
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:03,130
just to fucking torment me.

418
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,452
See you tomorrow, Dr. Miller.

419
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,221
Okay.

420
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,991
Excuse me.

421
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,994
Have you seen a little boy
around about 11 years old?

422
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,064
He's got a soccer ball with him?

423
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:39,400
I think you might find him

424
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,801
dribbling his ball
down at the end of this hallway.

425
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,870
Thank you.

426
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,740
You're a doctor, huh?

427
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,676
I'm actually off-duty, Sir.

428
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:51,779
Well, perhaps you can help me,
I can't seem to get any answers.

429
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,782
I'm looking for my son,
Ryan Quinn.

430
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,517
Your son?

431
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:01,088
You're a very lucky man,
Mr. Quinn.

432
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,956
We pulled two bullets
out of your boy.

433
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,627
Two bullets?
Is he...

434
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:08,861
He's heavily sedated
at the moment,

435
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,098
but there doesn't seem to be
any permanent damage

436
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:12,832
from what we can tell.

437
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,536
That's wonderful news.

438
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:18,272
You're an angel from God.
Can you take me to him?

439
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:21,008
You'll have to clear that
with the authorities, Sir.

440
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:22,710
Authorities?

441
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,345
What happened?

442
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,879
I'll make sure Dr. Terrence
comes to speak with you.

443
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,915
Appreciate it.

444
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,199
There you are.

445
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:47,401
I thought I asked you to stay
in the waiting area?

446
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:49,103
Sorry, I got bored.

447
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,606
Are you ready for the
biggest hotdog money can buy?

448
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,074
And ice-cream?

449
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,975
Anything for my birthday boy.

450
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,444
Let's go.

451
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:01,749
That's some pretty nice kicks
you got.

452
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:03,150
Thanks.
Yeah.

453
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,888
Wait. We got company.

454
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,826
Afternoon, fellas.

455
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,894
Hi. How's it going?
Good, good.

456
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,230
Y'all waiting for somebody?

457
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:17,498
Yeah, shouldn't be too long.

458
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,066
All right.

459
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,534
You still gotta pay
for a parking pass, though.

460
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:21,668
You a traffic cop?

461
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,670
Hey, Johnny, cop on.

462
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,239
Sorry, never mind him.

463
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:27,307
He's just--
he's a bit nervous.

464
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:29,443
His girlfriend's having
their first baby,
you know how it is.

465
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,778
Right.

466
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:32,945
Well, you still
gotta pay for parking.

467
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:34,947
Not a bother.

468
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:37,217
Take care. Bye.

469
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:45,925
I don't like him
checking us out like that.

470
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,228
Neither do I.

471
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:51,498
Come on, let's make a move.

472
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,549
We have some real sleazy types
out in the lot.

473
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,351
I'm gonna call their plate in
to my guy.

474
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:13,854
Always playing detective,
huh, Frank?

475
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:15,689
Well, you know
my hunches, right?

476
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,492
Hey, you.

477
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,861
Put the phone down,
get up against the wall.

478
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:22,396
Johnno.
Drop it, fucker.

479
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:23,464
Okay.

480
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,033
I said, drop it!
Okay, okay.

481
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:29,203
Don't fucking push it.

482
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:32,673
Oh, my God.

483
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,144
Christ.

484
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:41,048
Come on.

485
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,523
What the fuck
are you morons doing?

486
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,692
She was about to push
the panic button, Paddy.

487
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:57,264
What part of do nothing
didn't you understand?

488
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,299
All right,

489
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,635
move all these people
to the waiting area.

490
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:03,136
Lock it down.

491
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:05,405
You, guard the entrance.
No one in or out.

492
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:07,441
You, make sure
the back is secure.

493
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,042
Get that dead woman
out of there

494
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,277
and clean up that blood.

495
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,379
You, come with me.

496
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:13,714
Come on! Round them up.

497
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,781
Paddy, please...

498
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,049
Fucking idiot.

499
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:17,484
You heard him,
fucking move!

500
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:20,654
Boy, what the fuck
you looking at?

501
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:31,965
Where are we going?

502
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,433
Somewhere safe.

503
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,568
Come on.

504
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,938
Come in here.
Come in here.

505
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:39,072
All right,

506
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,374
I need you to wait in here.

507
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,742
Mom, no.

508
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:44,778
Come on, Bobby, I need you
to be brave now, okay?

509
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,046
This is the safest spot.

510
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:47,514
In there?

511
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,950
Come on, honey,
you've been brave before.

512
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,452
Do you remember
when we were camping

513
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,121
and I was scared of that snake?

514
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:57,291
You wound up
the biggest, hardest kick,

515
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:59,259
you didn't even bat an eye
before kicking it away.

516
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:00,327
Do you remember that?

517
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,729
Mom, I heard a gunshot.

518
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:04,565
I know what they sound like.

519
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:09,570
Listen, your mom's been
doing this a long time.

520
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:12,439
I am not going to let
anything happen to you.

521
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,544
Stay in here, stay quiet,

522
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,513
and we'll get
out of this together.

523
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:22,583
Dad'll watch over you.

524
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,485
That's my man.

525
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,754
Stay quiet.

526
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:29,389
I won't be long, okay?

527
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:31,792
Love you.

528
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,393
I love you, too.

529
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,070
Please, please,
it was an accident.

530
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:43,403
I didn't mean to.

531
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,771
Please, please.
Shut the fuck up.

532
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:46,173
Paddy, please...

533
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:51,079
Liam. Grab him.

534
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:54,615
I don't know what ears are for
if you don't use them.

535
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:56,750
You want to play with your gun?

536
00:26:57,918 --> 00:26:59,620
Here's the consequence.

537
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:16,236
Ah, fuck!

538
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:19,506
Next time
use the other ear to listen.

539
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:22,743
Or I'll cut that one off, too!

540
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,411
You hear me now?

541
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:31,818
Good man, Paddy.

542
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:37,491
Here, sit.

543
00:27:37,557 --> 00:27:39,593
Sit. Here, have a seat.
Sit down.

544
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:41,461
Over here.

545
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:44,065
Clean him up.
You, clean him up.

546
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:45,799
Clean him up.

547
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:47,868
Quickly.

548
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,872
Good afternoon, folks.

549
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,874
Don't mind him.

550
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,046
Now, I'm going to speak
very slowly and clearly
for everyone,

551
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:00,180
because people say sometimes

552
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:02,215
that it might be hard
to understand me

553
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:03,383
with my Irish accent.

554
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,087
So, listen up carefully,

555
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:08,522
so there's
no misunderstandings...

556
00:28:09,157 --> 00:28:10,924
and no one gets hurt, see?

557
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,295
Now, can anyone
please tell me

558
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:18,899
where my son, Ryan Quinn,
is being kept?

559
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,201
You tell me,

560
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:24,738
we will get him,
and be on our merry way.

561
00:28:24,805 --> 00:28:26,406
Simple as that.

562
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,277
Anyone?

563
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:32,479
I can.

564
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,750
I worked on him.
I know where he is.

565
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,351
Stand up.

566
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:43,290
Thank you, thank you, kind Sir.

567
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:45,826
You must be a father, huh?

568
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:48,995
Speak up.

569
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:51,431
I have a daughter.

570
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:52,833
Beautiful.

571
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:53,967
How old?

572
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,502
Almost 14.

573
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,072
Oh, a teenager.

574
00:28:58,139 --> 00:28:59,573
Wonderful.

575
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:02,409
So you understand
why I need to find my son.

576
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,377
Yes.

577
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:11,785
I just don't want anyone
unnecessarily hurt.

578
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,957
I don't want
to see anyone hurt.

579
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:21,695
Take me to him.

580
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:27,034
Sean.
Yeah.

581
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,608
No one move, no one talk.

582
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:39,312
Danny.

583
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,648
Christ, you okay?

584
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,985
Jesus.

585
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:16,883
Where is he?

586
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,552
He was here.

587
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:23,723
I don't see him.

588
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:31,132
I assure you, he was here,
with an FBI agent.

589
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,866
What agent?

590
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,937
Ellis. Agent Ellis.

591
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,638
They all came in together.

592
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:45,612
He's telling the truth.

593
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,848
How the fuck do you know?

594
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:50,117
Because I know.

595
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:52,953
Do ya?

596
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,136
What ya doing?

597
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,972
That's the little prick
that nicked Ryan.

598
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,783
What the hell, Sean?

599
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,119
What did you do?

600
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,090
He's responsible
for my little brother
being in here.

601
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:30,857
You're both responsible.

602
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:33,094
Will you please
stop killing people?

603
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:36,997
Fuck him.
He was dead anyway.

604
00:31:43,304 --> 00:31:44,804
Fuck.

605
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:48,441
You tried.

606
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:49,976
Let's go.

607
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,515
Liam, the Feds moved Ryan.

608
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,251
Send the boys out to find him.

609
00:31:57,318 --> 00:31:58,852
You got it, Paddy.

610
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:03,024
Search every floor,
every fucking room.

611
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,358
Come on,
let's find Ryan.

612
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,926
Come on, then!

613
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:08,428
Watch the bag, lad.

614
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:10,164
Good man.

615
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,290
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.

616
00:32:36,357 --> 00:32:39,226
Jesus Christ, they killed him.

617
00:34:07,348 --> 00:34:09,183
For Christ's sake.

618
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,551
You could've
gotten yourself shot.

619
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:13,421
You see anything?

620
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:14,954
No.

621
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:17,557
Still can't believe
Paddy did that.

622
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:21,195
Oi, keep your mouth shut.

623
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:22,695
Danny's a fucking idiot.

624
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:24,697
Takes too much after Sean.

625
00:34:30,438 --> 00:34:32,872
Easy.

626
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:34,908
That's my fucking cousin.

627
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,411
We're all family at this point.

628
00:34:37,877 --> 00:34:41,449
You want to do well by Danny?
By yourself?

629
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:43,716
You fucking
better listen to Paddy.

630
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:45,319
Understood?

631
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:04,405
Jesus, Frank.

632
00:35:04,472 --> 00:35:05,939
They shot Shannon.

633
00:35:06,706 --> 00:35:07,941
Oh, my God.

634
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:09,843
I gotta show you something.

635
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:23,524
Huh?

636
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,192
Those are the hostages.

637
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:26,560
Huh.

638
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:27,760
Agent Ellis.

639
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:28,995
Where is that?

640
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:30,431
Third-floor storage area.

641
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:31,698
Been abandoned for decades.

642
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:33,567
Cut the feed to the monitors.

643
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,635
The monitors? Why?

644
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:37,937
I don't need them
knowing where I am.

645
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,672
Okay.

646
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:58,292
Holy shit. Some doctor.

647
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,328
Skills from a past life.

648
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:02,862
What, as Wonder Woman?

649
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,731
Tie him up.

650
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:06,433
And cut those wires.

651
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,068
Yeah, I'm on it.

652
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,919
Wait, wait.

653
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:35,695
Don't shoot!

654
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:38,998
A Clown. Get up.

655
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,269
Come with me. Come with me.

656
00:36:43,836 --> 00:36:48,075
Move. Come on now.
Move. Move.

657
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:54,548
Clown--
You used to love clowns.

658
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:55,915
Still do.

659
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:58,185
That's why I have
five of them working for me.

660
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:03,023
Everybody's cool and calm.
Good job.

661
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,393
Hello, big ears.

662
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:12,132
Now, listen up.

663
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,102
It's been a long time
since I've taken a life,

664
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,769
I prefer to leave it to God
these days,

665
00:37:16,836 --> 00:37:18,639
but I am getting
fucking desperate.

666
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:20,807
I need to find my son.

667
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:23,377
I need someone to come with me

668
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:24,844
who knows the ins and outs

669
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:27,047
of the architecture
of this building.

670
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:30,451
Nobody?

671
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:33,287
What the?

672
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:35,022
Jesus fucking wept.

673
00:37:43,063 --> 00:37:45,299
Let's go! Move, move!

674
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:03,417
This is Agent Duncan Jones
of the FBI.

675
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:07,054
I would like to speak
to whomever is in charge here.

676
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:10,291
You, female nurse,
stand up, come with me.

677
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:11,791
Now.

678
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,261
Sean?

679
00:38:14,328 --> 00:38:16,497
I'm going to talk
to the cops, Paddy.

680
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:18,898
Unless you want
to show your face.

681
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:56,903
The fuck?

682
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,530
Ellis?

683
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,268
Ellis, it's Dr. Miller.

684
00:39:29,636 --> 00:39:30,870
Agent Ellis?

685
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:33,273
Psst. In here.

686
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:40,681
Ellis.
Yeah, in here.

687
00:39:40,748 --> 00:39:42,216
What are you doing?

688
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:44,418
I had to move him,
they were going to kill him.

689
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:46,587
They killed McBride.

690
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:48,088
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

691
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:50,758
They just unplugged
his life support,

692
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:52,059
just ripped it right off of him.

693
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:53,494
I was fine with my desk job.

694
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,696
You know,
they said you want action, huh?

695
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:57,264
You want to make a difference,

696
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:58,866
go into the field
with an easy first assignment.

697
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:00,067
Easy, my ass!

698
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:01,735
Ellis...
My partner's dead!

699
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:03,437
I should have been there,
I should have done something.

700
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:05,672
Agent Ellis, I need you
to get it together.

701
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,541
I'm sorry about your partner,

702
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:09,410
but right now,
they are searching for Ryan,

703
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:12,279
and they are not going to stop
until they find him.

704
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:15,182
What--
what happened?

705
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:17,050
The meds are wearing off.

706
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:18,519
I'm gonna find him something.

707
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,387
Just... stay here.

708
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:27,428
Fucking move.

709
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:29,363
Now, I'm going to tell you
one last time,

710
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,298
you're going to do
exactly as I tell you to do,

711
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:32,800
or I'm going to put a bullet
in your fucking head.

712
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:34,501
Open it.

713
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:41,074
Hey, you! Can you hear me?

714
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:44,111
I want you to listen
very carefully!

715
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:48,048
If any of you make a move
towards this building,

716
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,350
I will ice pick the spines

717
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:52,686
of every fucking hostage
in here!

718
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:55,255
Do you understand me?

719
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,024
I understand.

720
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,726
Nobody has to die, okay?

721
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:02,262
So let's work together here.

722
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,731
You just tell me
what you want...

723
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,034
and we'll do our best to comply.

724
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:11,205
I want your men
to back the fuck up!

725
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:15,175
Me and my family want
to leave here in one piece!

726
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:19,313
How we leave everyone else
is entirely up to you!

727
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:22,416
We'll be in touch.

728
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,123
Sir, that's Sean Quinn.
Patrick Quinn's eldest son.

729
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,660
I know who the fuck that is.

730
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:35,229
Goddammit.

731
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:53,347
You think you're really
fucking smart, don't you?

732
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,054
Don't move.

733
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,990
Drop it. Now!

734
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:09,630
You come to shoot?
Shoot. Don't talk.

735
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:16,036
Thanks for the advice.

736
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:19,940
You okay?

737
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:21,675
Yeah, it's just a graze.

738
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:24,945
That was my da's man.

739
00:42:25,013 --> 00:42:26,747
What the fuck did you just do?

740
00:42:27,514 --> 00:42:30,117
<i>Johnno, what is it?</i>

741
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:31,652
<i>I'll check it out, Boss.</i>

742
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:33,220
<i>Good man.</i>

743
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,423
We gotta move.

744
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,325
I think I'm bleeding.

745
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:48,068
"Cut the wires," she says.
"It'll be easy," she says.

746
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:50,704
I don't know
which wires to cut.

747
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:53,173
Yipee-ky-yay.

748
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,080
Ah, shit.

749
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:05,218
Danny, see what that is.

750
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:06,753
Paddy, I...

751
00:43:07,854 --> 00:43:09,623
I don't feel so good.

752
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,824
It's an ear.

753
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:13,727
You got the rest of your body.
Move it.

754
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:20,367
Go, go, go!

755
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:26,139
Hey, asshole!

756
00:43:26,206 --> 00:43:28,342
That's no way
to start a negotiation!

757
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:31,645
We're just
following protocol, Sean.

758
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:34,581
Now, help us out here.

759
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:36,650
Why don't you
just let the lady go?

760
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:39,987
Fuck you
and fuck your protocol!

761
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,855
I have enough C4 in here

762
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:44,291
to blow this whole
fucking place to hell!

763
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:46,727
Do not think I will not use it!

764
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:50,263
I won't hesitate,
not for a fucking second.

765
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,665
<i>I hear you.</i>

766
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:53,034
Now, listen to me.

767
00:43:53,101 --> 00:43:56,169
No one has to die, okay?

768
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:00,407
Fuck!

769
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,512
Gimme an update.

770
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:08,215
Just doin' the rounds, Sean.

771
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,118
<i>Still haven't seen anyone.</i>

772
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:11,852
You all right, Danny?

773
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:14,055
<i>All right?</i>

774
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:17,190
Your dad just cut
my fucking ear off.

775
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:19,793
<i>Are you listening now?</i>

776
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:22,130
That's what happens

777
00:44:22,195 --> 00:44:25,465
to little boys who don't do
what they're fucking told.

778
00:44:31,271 --> 00:44:32,906
Children, huh?

779
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,224
We meet again.

780
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:52,359
I know this looks bad,

781
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:54,461
but I was just, you know...

782
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:55,996
I'll shut up.

783
00:44:56,064 --> 00:44:57,197
You're gonna come with me.

784
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:58,765
I'm going to come with you.

785
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,674
What do we have here?

786
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,211
The Quinns have men
at all the exits.

787
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:12,779
Ambulance Bay, as well.

788
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:14,314
All guarded.

789
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:19,786
Fuck me.

790
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:22,090
Take a deep breath.
It's going to sting.

791
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:23,423
Breathe in.

792
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,692
Good.
There you go.

793
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:27,227
Ah, fuck.

794
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:30,931
So, uh, where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

795
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:35,669
Served two tours
in Afghanistan.

796
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:38,505
Saw more
than anyone should.

797
00:45:39,372 --> 00:45:41,274
Afghanistan, huh?

798
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:43,243
Well, thank you
for your service.

799
00:45:46,147 --> 00:45:47,514
It'll freeze up
in a few minutes.

800
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:49,816
You're lucky to be alive.

801
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:52,153
Yeah, tell that
to my brother.

802
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,687
He's the one who shot me.

803
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,522
Your brother?

804
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:57,125
Yeah, welcome
to the Quinn family.

805
00:45:57,557 --> 00:45:59,526
What, you've been an FBI agent
for two weeks now

806
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:01,394
and you know all about
me and my family?

807
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:08,102
My dad wants me to take over
the family business,

808
00:46:08,169 --> 00:46:09,703
Sean's fucking livid.

809
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:12,305
So he shot you?

810
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:14,808
My brother's
a fucking loonie.

811
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,245
I was never gonna
take over without him.

812
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,980
Sean's smart. I need him.

813
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:21,982
Yeah. Well, it's too bad,

814
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:23,950
because he's going to spend
the rest of his fucking life
in prison

815
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:26,720
for murdering Federal Agents,
along with your old man,

816
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:28,256
who's been aiding and abetting
his every move.

817
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:29,756
My old man
has nothing to do with it.

818
00:46:30,258 --> 00:46:32,926
This is Sean's mess,
and if he was here--

819
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:34,128
If he was here?

820
00:46:34,195 --> 00:46:35,462
What the fuck
do you think this is?

821
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:36,897
He's here looking for you,

822
00:46:36,963 --> 00:46:38,732
along with his gang
of fucking henchmen.

823
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,567
Then you need
to let me talk to him.

824
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:43,603
The only way out of this
is to get me to my dad.

825
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,505
You don't think
he'll come looking for Mick?

826
00:46:45,572 --> 00:46:46,907
The man she just killed?

827
00:46:46,973 --> 00:46:48,341
It was self-defense,

828
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:49,910
I had to shoot him,
he was coming at me.

829
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:51,212
I know.

830
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:52,679
I saw that.

831
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:54,447
But Sean's only gonna
use this against us.

832
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:56,050
Oh, my God.

833
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:57,684
You know what?
Listen to me carefully here.

834
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:59,153
There's no way in hell
I'm letting you near them.

835
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,320
You understand that?

836
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:02,089
There's no fucking way.

837
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:03,657
Then they will torture and kill
everyone in this hospital

838
00:47:03,723 --> 00:47:06,693
without remorse
until they find me.

839
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,461
On that I give you my word.

840
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:23,710
All right,
what am I looking at?

841
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:26,913
Closed-circuit video feed
from inside the hospital.

842
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,582
That's Agent Ellis.

843
00:47:28,648 --> 00:47:30,483
And that's Ryan Quinn, Sir.

844
00:47:31,384 --> 00:47:34,088
Wait. Who is she?

845
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,093
Move. Move.

846
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,028
Sean?
Johnno.

847
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:43,763
Remember this prick?

848
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,700
Someone also took out
one of Paddy's guys--

849
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:48,035
and I can't get ahold of Mick.

850
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:50,704
Well, I didn't do anything,
I swear.

851
00:47:51,805 --> 00:47:53,640
Stand over by the wall.

852
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:05,253
Are you a Fed?

853
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,759
I'm gonna ask you...

854
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:14,961
once.

855
00:48:15,029 --> 00:48:16,264
Where's my brother?

856
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,599
I don't know, okay,
I promise.

857
00:48:21,302 --> 00:48:22,736
I also found these.

858
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:26,439
Maps of the hospital.

859
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,978
Keep this to yourself.

860
00:48:32,313 --> 00:48:33,813
All right, Boss.

861
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:38,919
What the fuck's the plan?

862
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:42,455
Take the back stairs
down to the boiler room.

863
00:48:42,522 --> 00:48:44,125
If his brother's
coming after him,

864
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:45,359
it's the safest place to be.

865
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:46,993
Hang onto this.

866
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:50,764
What are you gonna do?

867
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,534
What I swore I wouldn't.

868
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:58,172
What you got for me, Tim?

869
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:01,875
Captain Michelle Miller.

870
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:04,412
E.O.D.S.
before becoming a Field Surgeon.

871
00:49:04,477 --> 00:49:06,646
Purple Heart.
Three-time Gold Star.

872
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:10,384
First tour in Afghanistan,
she led a team
in Operation Nasrat,

873
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,452
winning a Silver Star.

874
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:14,754
Her second tour,
she trained the Afghan Forces
in hand-to-hand combat,

875
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:17,657
before providing countermeasures
at the Bagram Air Base attack.

876
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:22,096
She was there during
an insurgent attack in Kandahar,

877
00:49:22,163 --> 00:49:23,496
where her husband...

878
00:49:23,563 --> 00:49:25,199
late husband...

879
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:26,633
Jeffrey Miller,

880
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,735
an explosive ordnance
disposal specialist,

881
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:31,138
was killed
on his third tour of duty.

882
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:33,807
She survived the attack,
herself.

883
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,579
Jesus.

884
00:49:40,613 --> 00:49:42,183
Yeah. That's her.

885
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:44,251
Looks like we've got
some help on the inside.

886
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:46,753
<i>Ma'am,</i>
<i>we've got activity on the roof.</i>

887
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:11,578
Let's do everything we can
to help that soldier.

888
00:50:11,644 --> 00:50:13,147
Yes, Sir.

889
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:38,805
Move.

890
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:40,408
Sit him down there, Johnno.

891
00:50:40,474 --> 00:50:41,674
On the fucking ground.
You know how it is.

892
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:43,977
Don't fuckin' look at me...

893
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:47,181
Any sign of him, Da?

894
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:50,317
What the...

895
00:50:52,253 --> 00:50:53,620
Fuck.

896
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:56,157
<i>Sean.</i>

897
00:50:57,791 --> 00:50:59,126
Danny, what's the story?

898
00:50:59,193 --> 00:51:01,028
<i>Mick's been shot.</i>

899
00:51:01,095 --> 00:51:02,296
He's dead.

900
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:09,437
There's another Fed
in this building.

901
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:13,606
We have to find him
and we have to kill him.

902
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:15,176
All right?

903
00:51:15,642 --> 00:51:17,911
You, go help Danny.

904
00:51:17,977 --> 00:51:18,745
Hurry.

905
00:51:18,812 --> 00:51:20,514
Shut the fucking alarm off.

906
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,848
You heard him.

907
00:51:23,616 --> 00:51:25,186
What the fuck?

908
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:27,021
What the fuck are you gonna do?

909
00:51:27,088 --> 00:51:28,621
We don't have a choice,
let's go.

910
00:51:28,688 --> 00:51:30,990
Jesus! Fuck!

911
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:52,812
Ah!

912
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:05,159
Funny place
for a lad to be hiding.

913
00:52:07,361 --> 00:52:08,661
Who's this?

914
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:14,901
Time to say hello
to Uncle Paddy.

915
00:52:47,568 --> 00:52:48,602
Shit.

916
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:51,138
Oh, dammit. Dammit.

917
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,776
Fuck.

918
00:52:57,944 --> 00:52:59,547
Hey, Paddy.

919
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:00,847
Look what I found!

920
00:53:00,914 --> 00:53:02,849
Oh, the footballer.

921
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:05,553
Your mother
was looking for you.

922
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,221
Did she find you?

923
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,191
Let him go.
Danny.

924
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,427
Did you find her, son?

925
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:14,662
No, sir.

926
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:16,729
I also found these, Paddy.

927
00:53:16,796 --> 00:53:19,400
You might want to take
a look for yourself.

928
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:21,235
Oh, you done good, Danny.

929
00:53:21,302 --> 00:53:22,702
You done good, huh?

930
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,673
This is a fine picture.
Look at this picture.

931
00:53:25,738 --> 00:53:27,608
Is that the family picture, huh?

932
00:53:27,675 --> 00:53:29,009
Yes, Sir.

933
00:53:29,076 --> 00:53:30,477
That's your family picture.

934
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:32,745
And your father...

935
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:35,149
your dad's in the military, huh?

936
00:53:35,216 --> 00:53:36,716
He was.

937
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:39,719
He was.

938
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,156
What's he doing now?

939
00:53:48,262 --> 00:53:50,997
<i>Paging Dr. Miller.</i>

940
00:53:51,065 --> 00:53:52,732
<i>Dr. Michelle Miller.</i>

941
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,636
<i>I assume you can hear me,</i>
<i>Dr. Miller,</i>

942
00:53:55,703 --> 00:53:57,971
<i>or should I say Captain Miller?</i>

943
00:53:58,038 --> 00:53:59,406
<i>Captain Miller.</i>

944
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,741
<i>Small world, isn't it?</i>

945
00:54:02,142 --> 00:54:06,513
Seems like not too long ago,
we met in the waiting area,

946
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,483
<i>just two parents</i>
<i>looking for their kids.</i>

947
00:54:11,118 --> 00:54:13,287
<i>I understand that you...</i>

948
00:54:14,255 --> 00:54:18,425
you've had a couple
of impressive careers now.

949
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:22,096
It's a shame
about your husband,

950
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:24,465
Lieutenant Jeffrey Miller.

951
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:29,536
<i>Bobby tells me</i>
<i>that he was quite the soldier.</i>

952
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,038
<i>Quite the soldier.</i>

953
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:35,942
Now, our family isn't one
for idle threats,

954
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,178
but I can assure you,

955
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:41,781
<i>Captain Miller,</i>
<i>that this can all go away.</i>

956
00:54:41,848 --> 00:54:43,550
Wouldn't you like that, Bobby?

957
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:45,818
<i>Mom...</i>

958
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:47,254
all he wants is his son,

959
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:48,522
<i>Ryan.</i>

960
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:51,125
Bobby, mom's right here, okay?

961
00:54:51,191 --> 00:54:52,959
Everything's going to be okay.

962
00:54:53,394 --> 00:54:55,329
Your boy
has nothing to worry about.

963
00:54:55,396 --> 00:54:56,764
He's in good hands.

964
00:54:56,829 --> 00:54:59,832
Of course, it's all contingent
on how my boy is doing.

965
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:04,004
In fact
I'd like to speak to him.

966
00:55:04,837 --> 00:55:06,206
Let me hear his voice.

967
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:10,411
<i>He's not here.</i>

968
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:12,446
But you know
where he is, don't ya?

969
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:13,681
<i>I do.</i>

970
00:55:13,747 --> 00:55:15,382
Good.

971
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:17,117
Can I assume he's alive?

972
00:55:17,184 --> 00:55:20,087
He's alive. I promise you,
he's alive.

973
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:21,921
Oh, that's very, very good news.

974
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:23,657
We have to go to plan B.

975
00:55:23,724 --> 00:55:25,726
Grab the bag.

976
00:55:25,793 --> 00:55:27,328
Danny.

977
00:55:27,394 --> 00:55:31,699
Now, I don't want this
to go on any longer than you.

978
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:33,933
<i>So, as good parents,</i>

979
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,538
let's both get our children
back home safely.

980
00:55:37,604 --> 00:55:38,871
Wouldn't you like that?

981
00:55:39,606 --> 00:55:41,075
Yes.

982
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:45,813
You bring me my boy,

983
00:55:45,878 --> 00:55:48,549
and Bobby will be
right back with you.

984
00:55:48,981 --> 00:55:50,584
<i>That's it.</i>

985
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:54,822
You did good.

986
00:55:54,887 --> 00:55:56,256
Fuck.

987
00:56:02,763 --> 00:56:04,331
Where's Sean?

988
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:23,983
You don't need
to do this, you know.

989
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:26,986
Nothin' gonna
happen to you, doctor.

990
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:29,490
You don't have to worry.

991
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:34,328
I need someone level-headed
and clear-minded

992
00:56:34,395 --> 00:56:36,563
to be able to relay a message.

993
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,831
That's you.

Don't shoot!

1017
00:57:39,726 --> 00:57:42,896

1018

1019

<i>in the parking lot.</i>

1023
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:03,016
Are you hurt?

1024
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:05,319
No, I'm okay.

1025
00:58:05,385 --> 00:58:08,021
But there are explosives
attached to my body.

1026
00:58:08,388 --> 00:58:09,823
Good God.

1027
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,358
They sent me out
with a message.

1028
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:12,992
What do they want?

1029
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,628
And blast and fire...

1030
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:16,196
They're planning
to execute hostages

1031
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:18,232
every 15 minutes
until you allow them out.

1032
00:58:18,298 --> 00:58:19,733
Now, I've seen
this type before.

1033
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,834
God forgive me.

1034
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:22,603
You need to act now

1035
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:23,937
and get these sons of bitches
before they hurt anyone else--

1036
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:39,753
What was that?

1037
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:44,057
What the fuck was that?

1038
00:58:44,124 --> 00:58:45,592
That was my brother.

1039
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:53,033
Jesus.

1040
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,768
You good, Cruz?
Yeah, I'm good.

1041
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,571
Enough of this shit.

1042
00:58:57,638 --> 00:59:00,040
The last thing we need
are dozens of dead hostages.

1043
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:03,076
Alert the SWAT team,
get them into position now.

1044
00:59:03,143 --> 00:59:04,678
Yes, Sir.

1045
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:07,848
Motherfuckers.

1046
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:10,417
Here. I'll give that to you.

1047
00:59:14,354 --> 00:59:16,056
In the name of Jesus.

1048
00:59:17,357 --> 00:59:19,426
What the fucking hell
did you do?

1049
00:59:19,493 --> 00:59:21,128
Hey, what the fuck's
going on with you?

1050
00:59:21,194 --> 00:59:22,930
I had a fucking agreement!

1051
00:59:23,363 --> 00:59:24,898
You've jeopardized
every fucking thing--

1052
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:26,567
She killed Mick.

1053
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:29,303
What the fuck
did you think, Paddy,

1054
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:31,371
that she was just
gonna hand Ryan back?

1055
00:59:31,438 --> 00:59:33,340
She's working for the Feds.

1056
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:36,276
Little Sean.

1057
00:59:36,343 --> 00:59:38,779
Ah, fuck off. Fuck off!

1058
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,115
What happened to you?

1059
00:59:42,182 --> 00:59:43,784
I favored you as a child,

1060
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:48,155
I favored you
and your little wild ways,

1061
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:49,690
I saw myself in you.

1062
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:52,359
The only fucking person
you ever thought about

1063
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:54,394
was Paddy "Big Boy" Quinn.

1064
00:59:54,461 --> 00:59:57,731
I was working for the family
the only way I know how.

1065
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:00,534
I was fighting
every fucking day with my hands

1066
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:03,537
to provide you
with a better life.

1067
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:06,607
Come here,
my life was fucking grand
back in Limerick, thanks.

1068
01:00:06,673 --> 01:00:08,976
You were headed for trouble,
and I saw it.

1069
01:00:09,043 --> 01:00:11,878
I had to pull you away
from those terrorist boys.

1070
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:13,347
Sean,

1071
01:00:13,413 --> 01:00:16,216
you coulda started over
when we come here.

1072
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:17,818
What, like Ryan?

1073
01:00:17,884 --> 01:00:18,852
Like Ryan.

1074
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,721
Yes, like Ryan.

1075
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:23,624
Well, I'm sorry, Paddy,
I don't have the fucking--

1076
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,093
Come here.

1077
01:00:25,192 --> 01:00:27,794
I don't have the brains
to become a lawyer like Ryan,

1078
01:00:27,861 --> 01:00:29,063
I'm sorry.

1079
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:30,764
But let me tell you something,

1080
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:32,165
your son, Ryan,

1081
01:00:32,232 --> 01:00:34,001
was going to see
our family business

1082
01:00:34,068 --> 01:00:35,435
go down the fucking toilet.

1083
01:00:35,502 --> 01:00:37,170
And here's something else
for nothing.

1084
01:00:37,237 --> 01:00:39,139
He was working for the Feds.

1085
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:46,246
I don't believe that.

1086
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:47,714
Oh, don't ya?

1087
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:51,418
Ryan's the reason
we're here, Paddy.

1088
01:00:52,886 --> 01:00:54,488
No, son.

1089
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:57,924
You're the reason
we're here.

1090
01:01:13,573 --> 01:01:15,776
Jesus fucking wept.

1091
01:01:31,758 --> 01:01:33,326
Fuck!

1092
01:01:34,728 --> 01:01:36,229
Fuck!

1093
01:01:58,152 --> 01:02:00,654
Dr. Miller,
did you get my message?

1094
01:02:02,023 --> 01:02:03,490
<i>He was a good man.</i>

1095
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:05,826
Yeah, I know he was.

1096
01:02:05,892 --> 01:02:07,728
That's why I chose him.

1097
01:02:07,794 --> 01:02:08,995
But so was Mick.

1098
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:11,598
<i>I just wanted</i>
<i>to protect my son!</i>

1099
01:02:11,665 --> 01:02:14,035
I'm trying
to protect my brother.

1100
01:02:14,102 --> 01:02:15,702
<i>And I want him back...</i>

1101
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:18,472
...and then you can have
your son back.

1102
01:02:18,538 --> 01:02:19,873
<i>There's a morgue.</i>

1103
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,541
<i>Lower basement.</i>

1104
01:02:21,608 --> 01:02:24,544
You come alone, with Bobby,
and I'll be there with Ryan.

1105
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:27,314
Dr. Miller...

1106
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,583
<i>I was born at night...</i>

1107
01:02:29,649 --> 01:02:32,753
but it wasn't
fucking last night.

1108
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:34,688
There's another Fed
in this building.

1109
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:38,092
He came in the car
with my brother.

1110
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:41,261
<i>Did you really think</i>
<i>I was just going to trust you?</i>

1111
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:46,433
<i>I swear on my life,</i>
<i>I will be alone. Deal?</i>

1112
01:02:47,534 --> 01:02:49,536
On your life, huh?

1113
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:53,673
Can't ask fairer than that.

1114
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:57,544
That's the morgue.

1115
01:02:57,611 --> 01:02:58,945
That's the best way out.

1116
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:00,914
What about the hostages?

1117
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:02,883
Bring them down here.

1118
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:04,384
Lock them in.

1119
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:06,386
Americans love a spectacle.

1120
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:08,488
Let's give it to them.

1121
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:10,057
He's a liability.

1122
01:03:10,124 --> 01:03:11,925
That's what he fucking is.

1123
01:03:11,992 --> 01:03:13,426
Nothing new, Paddy.

1124
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,429
He's out of control.
It's my fault.

1125
01:03:16,496 --> 01:03:19,566
My old man used to beat me
something brutal,

1126
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:21,401
and I swore
I'd never do the same,

1127
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:24,038
but maybe Seany needed it.

1128
01:03:25,006 --> 01:03:26,506
You did all you could.

1129
01:03:26,573 --> 01:03:29,709
Not every child responds well
to the stern hand.

1130
01:03:29,776 --> 01:03:33,346
And the apple
don't fall far from the tree.

1131
01:03:33,413 --> 01:03:35,615
That's another piece of wisdom.

1132
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,384
Get these people up here, John.

1133
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,819
Up, up, up, up, up!

1134
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:41,454
Move, fuckers, move,
the lot of ya's!

1135
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:43,323
The lot of ya's, go!

1136
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,559
No funny business,
cocksucker!

1137
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:47,861
Move, ya cunt, move!

1138
01:03:50,064 --> 01:03:52,133
The Feds are about
to make their move.

1139
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,834
We're making ours first.

1140
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,136
Time's up, Paddy.

1141
01:03:55,203 --> 01:03:56,736
Let's go.

1142
01:03:58,738 --> 01:04:00,407
People, come on!
Everybody in here!

1143
01:04:00,473 --> 01:04:02,243
Everybody, come on!
Come on, come one!

1144
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,710
Move! Move! Move!

1145
01:04:03,777 --> 01:04:05,579
No funny business
or you're fuckin' dead!

1146
01:04:05,645 --> 01:04:07,547
Where the fuck are you going?
Go in there!

1147
01:04:07,614 --> 01:04:09,083
Get down
with the rest of them!

1148
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,252
You're not a fucking guest,
you're a hostage!

1149
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:12,586
Come on.

1150
01:04:12,652 --> 01:04:13,887
File in, thank you.

1151
01:04:13,954 --> 01:04:15,589
Sean.
What?

1152
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:19,459
This is
a bad situation we're in.

1153
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:20,727
We have to think carefully now.

1154
01:04:20,794 --> 01:04:22,462
We have to be calm.
We have to be clear.

1155
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:26,167
I am being fucking calm
and I am being clear.

1156
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,737
Why don't you just let
Little Seany deal with this,
all right?

1157
01:04:35,475 --> 01:04:37,278
Right!

1158
01:04:37,345 --> 01:04:40,014
I want you all
to fucking listen
very carefully to me.

1159
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:51,691
Behind you.

1160
01:04:52,293 --> 01:04:53,894
Stay still.

1161
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,595
Arms up!

1162
01:04:55,662 --> 01:04:56,963
Turn around slowly.

1163
01:04:57,031 --> 01:04:58,865
Fuck! Come here!

1164
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,942
This one's so easy.

1165
01:05:10,443 --> 01:05:11,912
Take that!

1166
01:05:11,978 --> 01:05:13,180
Cunt.

1167
01:05:24,325 --> 01:05:26,394
Fall back! Relax!
Fall Back!

1168
01:05:26,459 --> 01:05:28,129
You fucking bitch!

1169
01:05:33,301 --> 01:05:34,402
Johnno, go.

1170
01:06:01,028 --> 01:06:02,662
Danny?

1171
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:06,599
Oi!

1172
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:08,835
Wake up!

1173
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:44,105
Give me the boy!

1174
01:06:44,571 --> 01:06:45,972
Give me the boy.

1175
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,742
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck's going on?

1176
01:06:48,808 --> 01:06:50,577
She killed Danny.

1177
01:06:50,643 --> 01:06:53,114
This is not on that boy.

1178
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,547
This is on all of us.

1179
01:06:55,016 --> 01:06:57,917
Take it down a notch,
we all wanna get out of here.

1180
01:06:59,753 --> 01:07:02,089
I'm following through
on an agreement

1181
01:07:02,156 --> 01:07:04,125
to get Ryan back

1182
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:05,692
and to get us all home,

1183
01:07:05,759 --> 01:07:08,561
and that's it.

1184
01:07:08,628 --> 01:07:10,398
I'm going downstairs, Paddy.

1185
01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:13,401
Fine. I'm coming with you.

1186
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:15,001
Bring the boy.

1187
01:07:17,604 --> 01:07:19,373
Have you lost hold
of yourself?

1188
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,975
You're lucky Liam didn't
shoot you in the fucking head.

1189
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,611
Her time will come.

1190
01:07:24,677 --> 01:07:25,745
Come on,

1191
01:07:25,812 --> 01:07:28,315
we're gonna go
see your mom, see.

1192
01:07:28,681 --> 01:07:30,251
You stay close to me.

1193
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,652
Come on, Paddy.

1194
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:41,395
Jesus Christ,

1195
01:07:42,163 --> 01:07:44,532
what the hell
are they all waiting for?

1196
01:07:44,597 --> 01:07:46,033
The longer we wait,

1197
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,668
the more Sean will take matters
into his own hands.

1198
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,775
You stay right here.

1199
01:07:59,946 --> 01:08:01,948
Jesus.

1200
01:08:02,016 --> 01:08:05,019
You guys made it.
Yeah.

1201
01:08:05,086 --> 01:08:07,154
How are you feeling?

1202
01:08:07,221 --> 01:08:08,655
Not so good.

1203
01:08:08,721 --> 01:08:10,324
Hang in there
just a little longer.

1204
01:08:11,325 --> 01:08:12,792
I spoke to your brother.

1205
01:08:12,859 --> 01:08:14,261
We're gonna do an exchange
and get you home.

1206
01:08:14,328 --> 01:08:16,497
What?
Wait, wait, wait.
An exchange for what?

1207
01:08:16,564 --> 01:08:17,597
He'll fucking kill me.

1208
01:08:17,664 --> 01:08:18,898
For my son.

1209
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:22,001
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.

1210
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:23,571
He thinks I'm working
with the Feds.

1211
01:08:23,636 --> 01:08:25,072
I told him I'd come alone.

1212
01:08:25,705 --> 01:08:27,508
Fuck!

1213
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:28,708
This is dangerous.

1214
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:30,077
I'll be fine.

1215
01:08:30,144 --> 01:08:31,011
He's right.

1216
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:32,712
No matter what he told you,

1217
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:35,282
my brother always got
another motive, it's me--

1218
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:37,984
I'll protect you. I promise.

1219
01:08:41,122 --> 01:08:42,755
Let's go.

1220
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:56,970
Sign says
the morgue's down here.

1221
01:08:58,671 --> 01:09:02,476
Doc, I'm pretty
fucking bleeding.

1222
01:09:02,543 --> 01:09:06,213
Just stay with me.
I'll take a look.

1223
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,115
Come on, keep up.

1224
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:15,156
Hang in there.

1225
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:18,225
You're almost home.

1226
01:09:20,693 --> 01:09:24,298
Well, would you look at
the fuckin' state of you, chum.

1227
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:32,439
Nice to put a face
to the voice.

1228
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,309
Florence Nightingale.

1229
01:09:35,742 --> 01:09:37,645
Take it easy.
Where's Bobby?

1230
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,846
He's right here.

1231
01:09:39,913 --> 01:09:41,814
Bobby!
Mom...

1232
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,451
You okay, buddy?

1233
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:45,586
I'm okay.

1234
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,055
I'm relieved to see you, son.

1235
01:09:48,122 --> 01:09:49,490
Hey, Da.

1236
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:52,859
Now I'm going to give you back
your little boy,

1237
01:09:52,926 --> 01:09:55,329
and you're going to give
us back our little boy.

1238
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:57,931
And we're gonna come out of here
the way we came in.

1239
01:09:58,632 --> 01:10:00,467
Just like that?

1240
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:02,369
Just like that.

1241
01:10:02,436 --> 01:10:05,939
Suffering Jesus,
can we please
put the weapons away

1242
01:10:06,006 --> 01:10:07,941
and get this over with?

1243
01:10:15,982 --> 01:10:17,917
Go to your mommy.
Come on.

1244
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:27,328
We thought we lost you, son.

1245
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:29,463
We thought we lost you.

1246
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:32,799
Now, let's--
let's get you out of here.

1247
01:10:32,865 --> 01:10:34,268
Why'd you do it?

1248
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,638
What?

1249
01:10:37,705 --> 01:10:39,607
I wanted to run
the business with you.

1250
01:10:39,673 --> 01:10:41,108
You're my brother...

1251
01:10:41,442 --> 01:10:42,710
I fucking loved you.

1252
01:10:42,775 --> 01:10:44,078
What's he talking about?

1253
01:10:44,144 --> 01:10:45,446
He's off his fucking game
on drugs--

1254
01:10:45,512 --> 01:10:48,748
I saw you, you shot
right through my window.

1255
01:10:50,817 --> 01:10:52,419
What?

1256
01:10:53,454 --> 01:10:55,422
That's fucking bollocks!

1257
01:10:55,489 --> 01:10:58,459
All I did was look up to you...

1258
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:02,696
What?

1259
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:05,299
You're going
to fucking believe him over me?

1260
01:11:06,066 --> 01:11:08,435
Why don't you
convince me otherwise?

1261
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:10,170
Fuck off.

1262
01:11:11,938 --> 01:11:13,940
You tried to kill him.

1263
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:16,210
I'll never forgive you.

1264
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,349
Come again?

1265
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:26,120
You'll never forgive me?

1266
01:11:26,186 --> 01:11:30,024
Who the fuck would you
be forgiving, Paddy Quinn?

1267
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,924
You have no right
to forgive anyone.

1268
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:36,130
You should be asking forgiveness
off of him, me,

1269
01:11:36,196 --> 01:11:37,964
every other person
you fucked over!

1270
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:41,101
I watched my mother
drink herself to death
for 10 years

1271
01:11:41,168 --> 01:11:43,470
because she couldn't go home
because of you!

1272
01:11:46,774 --> 01:11:48,609
Shut your fucking mouth.

1273
01:11:48,676 --> 01:11:50,311
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1274
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:54,481
Sean, stop it!

1275
01:11:57,718 --> 01:11:59,453
Stop! No!

1276
01:12:01,954 --> 01:12:04,024
Move, move, move, move!

1277
01:12:04,658 --> 01:12:06,026
Ready?

1278
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:14,768
The snipers are in position
and our men are in place.

1279
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:17,538
Alright. Send them in.

1280
01:12:17,604 --> 01:12:18,871
Move in, now!

1281
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:26,213
I need you
to listen to me closely.

1282
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,982
You know those tunnels, right?
Mm-hmm.

1283
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:40,960
When I tell you so,
I need you to run.

1284
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:42,730
Freeze!

1285
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:55,476
What the fuck happened to you?
What happened to you?

1286
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:57,044
What the fuck do you mean
happened to me?

1287
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:15,028
Dad?

1288
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,065
I deserve it.

1289
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,236
I wasn't the father you needed.

1290
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:25,439
I failed you.

1291
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:34,481
Go! Now! Now! Go!

1292
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,623
Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1293
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:44,191
Not so fast, little man.

1294
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:45,826
Drop it, you piece of shit!

1295
01:13:45,893 --> 01:13:47,461
Let the kid go.

1296
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:11,452
You fucking bitch.

1297
01:14:12,519 --> 01:14:15,255
What in the name of God,
possessed you

1298
01:14:15,322 --> 01:14:19,026
to stick your fucking nosy tits
into my father's business?

1299
01:14:19,092 --> 01:14:21,462
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon down!

1300
01:14:57,331 --> 01:14:59,266
<i>You can fix this.</i>

1301
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:01,502
<i>I can fix this.</i>

1302
01:15:01,568 --> 01:15:03,170
You can fix this.

1303
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:04,738
<i>I can fix this.</i>

1304
01:15:04,805 --> 01:15:06,139
<i>Michelle...</i>

1305
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,775
Wake up!

1306
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:33,300
What did he used to say?

1307
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:36,036
Blue to ignite.
Red to make it right.

1308
01:15:40,674 --> 01:15:44,177
Wait-- or was it red to ignite,
blue to make it right?

1309
01:15:45,013 --> 01:15:46,647
Shit! I don't remember.

1310
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:49,449
<i>You can fix this, Michelle.</i>

1311
01:15:49,516 --> 01:15:52,653
Red. Red's hot,
like a fire.

1312
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,454
Blue...

1313
01:16:38,465 --> 01:16:40,200
Well, I'll be damned.

1314
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:41,468
My God, you're shot.

1315
01:16:41,535 --> 01:16:42,402
Yeah.

1316
01:16:42,469 --> 01:16:44,638
Easy first assignment, huh?

1317
01:16:46,074 --> 01:16:47,608
Where's McBride?

1318
01:16:47,674 --> 01:16:49,509
He...

1319
01:16:49,576 --> 01:16:50,744
Fuck me.

1320
01:16:50,811 --> 01:16:52,746
Yeah.

1321
01:16:52,813 --> 01:16:54,815
Where's the kid?

1322
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:56,249
What kid?

1323
01:17:30,018 --> 01:17:31,718
Hey, not tall boy.

1324
01:17:32,853 --> 01:17:34,154
Get up.

1325
01:17:34,888 --> 01:17:36,189
I said, get fucking up.

1326
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:42,562
Are you deaf?

1327
01:17:43,563 --> 01:17:44,731
Good.

1328
01:17:56,144 --> 01:17:58,645
If you run, I'll shoot ya.

1329
01:17:58,712 --> 01:18:01,214
If you scream, I'll shoot ya.

1330
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:03,283
In point of fact, if you do
anything I don't like,

1331
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,718
what'll I do?

1332
01:18:04,785 --> 01:18:06,319
You'll shoot me.

1333
01:18:06,386 --> 01:18:07,954
You're very clever.

1334
01:18:09,556 --> 01:18:11,191
You're such a clever boy, huh?

1335
01:18:11,258 --> 01:18:14,494
Brains to burn,
very bright boy, huh?

1336
01:18:15,163 --> 01:18:16,763
Tell me...

1337
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:18,231
is this the way out?

1338
01:18:18,298 --> 01:18:22,136
There's a gate at the end.
I-- I used to play down there.

1339
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,371
Good. Take me to it.

1340
01:18:29,643 --> 01:18:32,579
Leave him alone, Sean!
Drop your weapon!

1341
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:35,248
Jesus fucking Christ.

1342
01:18:35,949 --> 01:18:38,752
Tiger mommies
and their fucking cubs, what?

1343
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:40,587
Just let him go.

1344
01:18:41,655 --> 01:18:42,956
It's over.

1345
01:18:43,024 --> 01:18:46,060
No, I won't just let him go.

1346
01:18:46,127 --> 01:18:47,928
And it's not all over.

1347
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:51,565
I see you stopped my bomb.

1348
01:18:52,866 --> 01:18:54,301
One of us, Dr. Miller.

1349
01:18:55,569 --> 01:18:56,937
Do you think you'll be able
to stop a bullet

1350
01:18:57,003 --> 01:18:59,239
going into the back
of his fucking head?

1351
01:18:59,306 --> 01:19:00,640
Okay.

1352
01:19:00,707 --> 01:19:02,776
Put the gun down, then.
Okay.

1353
01:19:02,843 --> 01:19:04,311
That's it.

1354
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:07,414
Okay. Easy.

1355
01:19:07,481 --> 01:19:08,482
That's it.

1356
01:19:08,548 --> 01:19:09,916
Easy.

1357
01:19:11,952 --> 01:19:14,021
Bobby, it's gonna be okay.

1358
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:17,257
We're gonna go home
and practice your soccer kicks.

1359
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:21,495
Your mommy is a lot fucking
smarter than she looks, boy.

1360
01:19:42,783 --> 01:19:43,984
Mom?

1361
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:53,994
Okay...

1362
01:20:03,804 --> 01:20:06,073
An incredible scene
here tonight

1363
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,874
at The Mercy Regional Hospital.

1364
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:09,910
Suspected loyalists
to the Quinn Gang,

1365
01:20:09,976 --> 01:20:13,680
including the patriarch himself,
Patrick "Paddy" Quinn,

1366
01:20:13,747 --> 01:20:16,583
have finally
been brought to justice.

1367
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:25,092
Hey.
Hey.

1368
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:28,962
So Ryan made it, huh?

1369
01:20:31,665 --> 01:20:33,733
Yeah, luck of the Irish.

1370
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:38,839
Guess Paddy might make it, too.

1371
01:20:42,642 --> 01:20:44,744
Some of the guys
brought this from inside.

1372
01:20:45,445 --> 01:20:47,547
I thought you'd want it back.

1373
01:20:49,883 --> 01:20:52,119
Thank you.

1374
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:54,621
Dr. Miller,
can you confirm the reports

1375
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,290
that you helped apprehend
the terrorists

1376
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:58,025
and saved the hostages?

1377
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:02,529
I did what any mom would do
to save her son.

1378
01:21:02,996 --> 01:21:06,533
Now I can tell you one thing.
she's an American hero.

1379
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,072
None of us would be alive today
if it wasn't for her courage.

1380
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,676
You know...

1381
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:19,446
you make
a pretty good partner.

1382
01:21:21,315 --> 01:21:23,284
You're not so bad yourself...

1383
01:21:23,351 --> 01:21:24,951
for a rookie.

1384
01:21:27,454 --> 01:21:29,023
I had that one coming.

1385
01:21:32,792 --> 01:21:33,994
I'll...

1386
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:35,495
I'll see you around.

1387
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:37,564
Yeah.

1388
01:21:37,631 --> 01:21:39,399
See you around.

1389
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:47,241
Shall we?

1390
01:21:47,308 --> 01:21:49,143
Yeah.
Yeah.

1391
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:52,946
So I think we're gonna have
to make the next soccer game.

1392
01:21:53,014 --> 01:21:54,447
Soccer game?

1393
01:21:54,514 --> 01:21:57,084
Who needs that when you've got
an action hero for a mom?

1394
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:58,252
Really?
Yeah.

1395
01:21:58,319 --> 01:21:59,519
You weren't so bad yourself.

1396
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:01,055
You had a killer
scissor kick back there,

1397
01:22:01,122 --> 01:22:02,256
that was like--
Mom...

1398
01:22:02,323 --> 01:22:03,590
It's a back-heel kick.

1399
01:22:03,657 --> 01:22:05,859
Oh, I'm sorry, pardon me.
