1
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,166
I'm comin' out now.

2
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,843
I'm tired,
I want something different.

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,367
I just want to have a conversation.

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,885
I just want to talk about it.

5
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,491
Shit.

6
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,761
What the shit, man?

7
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,001
Suck it! Drive.

8
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,407
How old is she?

9
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,567
A junior.

10
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,811
She's got nice titties. You talk to her?

11
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,121
No.

12
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,004
You're gonna have to talk to her.

13
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,081
I know.

14
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,921
Remind me when we get back to my house.

15
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,360
I think Galen's got a book on that.

16
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,121
Shit.

17
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,722
Your dad would kill us
if he knew we went out there.

18
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,762
I'm not worried about my dad killin' us.

19
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,520
We need to move
if we're gonna make it back.

20
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,322
Set your watch, we need a good 15 minutes.

21
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,525
There it is!

22
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,440
Galen says
it's been here awhile.

23
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,890
He thinks the last flood did it.

24
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,925
Oh, hold it.

25
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,081
Look.

26
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,481
Little shits.

27
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,207
There it is.

28
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,805
Yeah. There it is.

29
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,564
Came down from up there.

30
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,006
Motor's gone.

31
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,361
Who else knows about this?

32
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,601
Just me and Galen.

33
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,761
What's he think?

34
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,207
He don't care about it.

35
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,561
Good.

36
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,761
Because this boat's ours.

37
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,526
This is perfect.

38
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,170
Holy shit.

39
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,761
Dude.

40
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,169
Son of a bitch!

41
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,051
Those are awesome.

42
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,681
Man.

43
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,481
Neck.

44
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,563
Dude, look at that beave,
you gotta see this.

45
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,801
- Neck.
- What?

46
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,561
Someone's here.

47
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,721
What?

48
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,881
Someone's living here.

49
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,006
Shit.

50
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,606
We gotta go. Can't be late.

51
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,485
- What are you doing?
- I saw that same

52
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,763
boot print up in the tree.

53
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,520
It's got a cross in the heel.

54
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,686
Somebody's been in our boat.

55
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,843
Shit. Let's go!

56
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,005
We gotta go if you wanna make it back.

57
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,244
Takes twice as long goin' upriver.

58
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,601
Hold on.

59
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
Up there, they stop.

60
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,201
Where the hell'd he go?

61
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,401
I don't know.

62
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,165
Shit, you know that guy?

63
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,211
I've never seen him before.

64
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,801
Shit.

65
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,440
What'd you say, boy?

66
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,485
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it?

67
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,081
What's that?

68
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,486
Boat in a tree.

69
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,007
Hell of a thing.

70
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,685
You talkin' about our boat?

71
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,406
Talkin' about my boat.

72
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,681
We found it.

73
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,725
Yeah, you found it with me livin' in it.

74
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,764
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

75
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,006
You got crosses in your heels.

76
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,761
Nails.

77
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,046
Shaped like crosses.

78
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,481
What for?

79
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,450
Ward off evil spirits.

80
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,761
Bought 'em from a man I called an Indian,

81
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,691
but he was a Mexican,

82
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,245
said they were seven-league boots

83
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,527
worn by the seventh son
of the seventh son.

84
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,046
Told me they'd turn me into
a werewolf, that's a lie.

85
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,240
I don't know nothin' about that.

86
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,646
They just good luck boots.

87
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,048
As you can see,
they ain't working too well so far.

88
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,371
What's your name?

89
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,245
I'm Neckbone, he's Ellis.

90
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,648
And, mister, I know you're not
the owner of that boat,

91
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,960
not for nine-tenths of nothin'.

92
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,971
Neckbone...

93
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,090
That's a heck of a good handle, son.

94
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,561
Where y'all from?

95
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,121
What do you care where we're from?

96
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,441
DeWitt.

97
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,241
Arkansas boys.

98
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,443
Y'all had me worried for a second.

99
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,521
We supposed to know you?

100
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,721
I doubt it.

101
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,526
I grew up around here,
but I've been gone awhile.

102
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,086
Where at around here?

103
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,321
Different places.

104
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,089
Spent a lot of time back up near the White.

105
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,720
You know Shelly's Oxbow?

106
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,841
Ellis.

107
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,201
Yeah, I know it.

108
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,131
An old man named Tom Blankenship
used to live up in there.

109
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,001
He still does.

110
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,725
His boat's across from mine.

111
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,726
Well, ain't that somethin'?

112
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,643
Now, I like you two boys. You remind me of

113
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,361
me.

114
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,009
Seein' as how you two is from Arkansas,

115
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,811
and we know some of the same people
and we grew up in some of the same places,

116
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
I reckon we can make a deal for somethin'.

117
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,361
A deal for what?

118
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,401
Food.

119
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,601
Food for a boat.

120
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,160
He's a bum, Ellis. Come on.

121
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,800
Why don't you go get your own food?

122
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,051
Well, I would if I could.

123
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,648
See, I told somebody I'd
meet 'em here. So...

124
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,887
I'm stuck for now
and what I've got is runnin' low.

125
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,645
He's a bum, Ellis, come on.

126
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,370
I ain't no bum. I got money, boy.

127
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,281
You can call me a hobo,
'cause a hobo will work for his living,

128
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,880
and you can call me homeless 'cause...

129
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,049
Well, that's true for now,
but you call me a bum again,

130
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,720
I'm gonna teach you somethin' about
respect your daddy never did.

131
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,446
When they show up, you'll leave?

132
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,041
Yup.

133
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,445
And when you leave, that boat's ours?

134
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,001
That's right.

135
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,886
I'm just in a tight spot.

136
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,327
Could use a little help.

137
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,681
We gotta go.

138
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,761
You get his name?

139
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,486
No.

140
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,929
Sorry.

141
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,646
Where ya been?

142
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,210
Me and Neck got caught up helpin' Galen.

143
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,800
You're supposed to be helpin' me.
I had to load this myself.

144
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,166
I know. I'm sorry.

145
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,802
Get on in the back,
can't be later than we are.

146
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,481
Supposed to be 10.

147
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,000
It's 10, you do your share.

148
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,209
I loaded this morning, makes it five.

149
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,491
Can you drop me at Neck's?

150
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,602
Hadn't you seen enough of him today?

151
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,529
Said he had somethin' for me.

152
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,841
You see any more of them
Ding Dongs over there?

153
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,041
What did Mama want to talk to you about?

154
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,481
What?

155
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,243
This morning?
What did she want to talk to you about?

156
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,129
You spy on me in my own house?

157
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,649
I wasn't spyin', I just heard y'all.

158
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,010
That's your mother's business.

159
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,771
I came for that book.

160
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,641
Oh, yeah. Gotta give it a minute.

161
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,281
Hear that music?

162
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,166
Yeah?

163
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,007
That means he's doin' it.
That's his doin' it song.

164
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,281
You know who it is?

165
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,880
Whoever's drivin' that Pontiac.

166
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,210
You tell Galen about this morning?

167
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,165
Nah. You tell anybody?

168
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,881
That guy's crazy.

169
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,841
I don't know.
I think he just needed a little help.

170
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,323
He can swim his ass off
that island and get some.

171
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,605
I think I'm gonna go back out there,

172
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,205
give him some food.

173
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,406
Why?

174
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,411
You're Neckbone, right?

175
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,521
Yeah.

176
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,726
Word of advice.

177
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,881
Don't grow up to be like
your shit heel uncle.

178
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,761
Hey.

179
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,081
You hear me?

180
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,000
You treat a woman like a princess, got it?

181
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,241
Yeah.

182
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,527
Come on, baby!

183
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,084
I'm a goddamn princess!

184
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,764
That's uncalled for.

185
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,522
Hey, a lot of people are comfortable
with that kind of thing in the bedroom.

186
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,410
Some people aren't.
We know that about you now, okay?

187
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,602
What do you think I am?

188
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,086
Pearls.

189
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,850
Galen finds 'em in the mussel shells.

190
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,920
Come on, let's get that book.

191
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,443
- You weren't havin' any fun?
- No!

192
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,601
- No fun at all?
- No!

193
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,091
Please don't go.

194
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,040
I don't want you goin' back
out there by yourself.

195
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,963
That river's scary enough with two people.

196
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,284
I don't trust that guy.

197
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,646
Here it is.

198
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,282
Galen said that really turned
things around for him.

199
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,001
Thanks.

200
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,410
Watch out for that dog.

201
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,651
You really goin' back out there?

202
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,323
Yeah. I think it's the right thing to do.

203
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,401
All right.

204
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,925
I'll be over in the mornin' then.

205
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,166
Hey, that's a good book.
Be sure you do the worksheets in back.

206
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,401
Let's get some dinner, Neck.

207
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,446
Hey, I'll call before I come.

208
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,760
All right.

209
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,921
You okay, Mama?

210
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,841
Yes.

211
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,361
Are you hungry?

212
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,490
You want me to fix you something?

213
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,165
I'm all right.

214
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,684
Well, then, I'm going to turn in.

215
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,051
Hey, Dad.

216
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,810
What do you know about Tom Blankenship?

217
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,601
What?

218
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,761
Mr. Blankenship,
what do you know about him?

219
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,251
Why?

220
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,207
I don't know. He just looks lonely
over there all by himself.

221
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,244
Some people move to
this river to work on it,

222
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,766
and some people move here to be left alone.

223
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,681
I want us to try and sit down
for dinner tonight, okay?

224
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,360
Ellis?

225
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,131
Be home by 7:00.

226
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,441
Yes, ma'am.

227
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,281
Where do you think he's at?

228
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,805
Let's try the boat.

229
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,566
Looks like he made camp.

230
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,571
You think he's up there?

231
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,845
What are you doin'?

232
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,247
I try to never sleep in
the same spot twice.

233
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,040
- What you got there?
- Brought you some food.

234
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,885
Here, take it.

235
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,204
I owe you boys.

236
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,528
I was gonna try and run
a trotline this afternoon.

237
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,171
See where that got me.

238
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,361
Green beans never tasted so good.

239
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,285
Why you have that pistol?

240
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,401
Protection.

241
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,730
Y'all needn't be afraid of me.

242
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,086
I've got two ways to protect myself
out here, this shirt

243
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,041
and this pistol.

244
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,561
There are fierce powers
at work in the world, boys.

245
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,728
Good, evil,

246
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,167
poor luck, best luck.

247
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,846
As men,

248
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,243
we've got to take advantage where we can.

249
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,766
Y'all comin'?

250
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,440
So who's this guy
you're waiting on?

251
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,769
I'm not waitin' on no guy.

252
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,085
I'm waitin' on my girlfriend.

253
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,125
- Juniper.
- Is she hot?

254
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,366
She's beautiful.

255
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,726
Bullshit!

256
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,968
Prettiest girl I've ever seen, hands down.

257
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,969
Blonde hair, long legs.

258
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,400
I tell you, she's like a dream
you don't want to wake up from.

259
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,445
She's got these birds tattooed
on her hands here.

260
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,480
Nightingales.

261
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,650
Good luck birds.

262
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,249
That a good luck snake?

263
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,810
No, it is not.

264
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,211
I hate snakes.

265
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,291
That's because God put 'em
here for us to fear.

266
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,644
We knew to be afraid of snakes long
before we ever even got into this world.

267
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,290
The Cherokee would wrap their pregnant
women's bellies in snake skin.

268
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,721
Induce labor, scare the child out.

269
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,961
Put that around your bed at night.

270
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,842
Snake won't cross a braided rope.

271
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,961
Thanks.

272
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,570
So what's that tattoo for then?

273
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,966
A reminder.

274
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,326
Don't get bit.

275
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,886
I was 10, swimmin' about a mile
up from here, me and Juniper.

276
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,525
Son of a bitch

277
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,162
swam up on me,
bit me right here up under the armpit.

278
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,803
Juniper got me off to the clinic.

279
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,686
Doctor said I should have
been dead in 20 minutes.

280
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,842
Took us over an hour just to get to town.

281
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,720
So what'd they do for it?

282
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,000
Gave me the anti-venom.

283
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,401
Cottonmouth.

284
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,081
See here?

285
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,525
Thing with anti-venom is,

286
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,609
they can only give it to you once.

287
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,888
Made of horse blood.
Body would reject it a second time.

288
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,681
So the cure becomes
more dangerous than the poison.

289
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,724
What happens if you get bit again?

290
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,561
I die

291
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,766
or just sweat it out.

292
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,720
We gotta go help Neck's uncle.

293
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,761
All right.

294
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,571
You never said your name.

295
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,841
Mud.

296
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,331
You can call me Mud.

297
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,361
Here, Mud.

298
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,324
I think you need this worse than I do.

299
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,206
I'll be all right.

300
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,047
You start datin', I bet her dad'll
give you a free pickup.

301
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,005
I don't care about that.

302
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,641
What the hell are you doing?

303
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,481
Where you goin'?

304
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,361
Stop it!

305
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,925
Stop it! God!

306
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,406
Hey.

307
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,729
Holy shit, Pryor,
get off your ass!

308
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,524
You only got what you deserve!

309
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,444
That's right, go home, Pryor!

310
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,967
Do I know you?

311
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,210
I'm Ellis, that's Neck.

312
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,840
We went to junior high with you
before you went to high school.

313
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,841
How old are you?

314
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,001
Fourteen.

315
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,885
You know you just punched a senior.

316
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,961
So?

317
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,521
I'm May Pearl.

318
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,481
I know.

319
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,406
What else do you know?

320
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,561
Nothing.

321
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,240
Son of a bitch.

322
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,921
Ellis.

323
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,641
Ellis!

324
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,646
Look.

325
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,441
You ever seen that girl before?

326
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,601
No.

327
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,691
Did you see her hands?

328
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,726
Hey, girl!

329
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,121
Hey!

330
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,930
Hey, girl, where you goin'?

331
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,290
That ain't even cool.

332
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,320
Hello?

333
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,765
Oh, sorry.

334
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,927
We think we know a guy that might
know that girl over there.

335
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,168
May Pearl, let's go!

336
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,441
Okay.

337
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,601
Okay, I guess I'll see you.

338
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,488
If you can find my number,
you should give me a call.

339
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,806
I can find it.

340
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,121
Where'd she go?

341
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,680
Into the Piggly Wiggly.
She came from the motel.

342
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,406
Home for dinner?

343
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,641
What you hidin' for?

344
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,921
I ain't hidin'.

345
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,761
Come over here.

346
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,565
You know I love you?

347
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,487
Yes, sir.

348
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,281
I know.

349
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,687
I work you hard, 'cause life is work.

350
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,161
You know that?

351
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,281
Yes, sir.

352
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,049
Your mom is talkin' about movin' into town.

353
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,681
What's that mean?

354
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,600
She seems set on it,

355
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,806
wants to separate.

356
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,769
May even ask for a divorce.

357
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,651
What's that mean for me?

358
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,402
It means enjoy this river, son.

359
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,284
Enjoy it while you live on it.

360
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,122
'Cause this way of life
isn't long for this world.

361
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,208
River Authority's about
made certain of that.

362
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,766
But you and me,

363
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,083
we can still live out here, right?

364
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,564
R.A. can't take your boat.

365
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,120
Not while you're still livin' in it.

366
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,050
This houseboat's in your mother's name.

367
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,444
Her daddy gave it to her, not to me.

368
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,286
She wants to leave it.

369
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,690
River Authority's got every
right to come in here

370
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,446
and tear this place apart board by board.

371
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,685
That ain't right.

372
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,525
You work outta here.

373
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,006
We got the ice machine.

374
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,521
The traps.

375
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,526
What are we supposed to do?

376
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,281
Like I said, that's your mother's business.

377
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,927
I ain't no townie.

378
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,085
I ain't livin' like that.

379
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,011
I've let you down, son.

380
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,285
Man is supposed to be
in charge of his own affairs,

381
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,720
but I haven't worked it like that.

382
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,601
But y'all are married.

383
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,088
Y'all are supposed to love each other.

384
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,088
I don't know about that anymore.

385
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,921
Hey, Ellis.

386
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,401
You're late.

387
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,487
Ellis?

388
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,730
Damn, boy, what you doin' out here?

389
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,964
I got you some Beanie Weenie.

390
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,731
I appreciate that.

391
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,884
But I didn't expect you out here at night.

392
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,091
Look at that.

393
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,731
Boy, you really know how
to do somebody right.

394
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,405
I wasn't gonna say nothin',

395
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,251
but it's pretty tough to make
a meal out of pumpkin pie fillin'.

396
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,641
That's all my mom had.

397
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,571
I ain't complainin'.

398
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,284
Can I get one of those?

399
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,563
They're yours to begin with.

400
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,881
That's good, right?

401
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,204
You been out here too long.

402
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,891
The girl you're waitin' on,

403
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,450
she's your girlfriend?

404
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,241
Juniper.

405
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,041
Yeah.

406
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,811
How'd you meet her?

407
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,490
We grew up together.

408
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,846
You love her?

409
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,641
I do.

410
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,124
First time I saw her was on this river,
just up from here.

411
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,964
She saved my life.

412
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,208
From the snake bite.

413
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,728
I was younger than you are right now.

414
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,763
When I came to in the hospital
and she was there,

415
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,322
it was like the whole world just split
wide open and

416
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,326
come back together new.

417
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,768
I knew from then on I'd
do anything for her.

418
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,090
Why aren't y'all married then?

419
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,242
I've asked. Several times.

420
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,201
Marriage

421
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,728
just don't work for some people.

422
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,046
My dad says

423
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,842
my parents might be getting a divorce.

424
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,569
I'm sorry to hear that.

425
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,088
They say if it happens,
and my mom moves us off the river,

426
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,964
the government can come take our boat.

427
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,565
Who says that?

428
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,325
Everybody.

429
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,005
They passed a law.

430
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,006
I saw Juniper today.

431
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,201
What?

432
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,241
She had the birds tattooed on her hands.

433
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,044
Just like you said.

434
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,006
You're right.

435
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,441
She's pretty.

436
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,641
Where'd you see her?

437
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,561
At the Piggly Wiggly.

438
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,568
I think she's staying at
a motel nearby there.

439
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,124
That's good news.

440
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,640
That's real good news.

441
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,282
She know you're out here?

442
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,324
No. No, we...

443
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,491
We said we'd meet somewhere else,
a couple days from now.

444
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,967
You wanna go tonight?
I can take you up river.

445
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,361
Tomorrow.

446
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,841
I'll go tomorrow.

447
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,080
You want me to come and get you?

448
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,281
No, I can manage.

449
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,610
Hell, I made it out here, didn't I?

450
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,401
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it?

451
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,811
It's a hell of a thing.

452
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,561
Time to get up.

453
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,480
It's too early.

454
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,680
I'm going to Wal-Mart
and I need you to come with me.

455
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,281
Mom.

456
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,606
Come on.

457
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,526
Ellis, I know what
your father told you last night.

458
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,128
That's... That's not what I wanted.

459
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,803
I wanted to sit you down and talk about it.

460
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,325
What do you want to talk about?

461
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,010
You want to leave and that means
they can tear up our house.

462
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,128
Well, I spent my whole life on that boat.

463
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,443
I don't think it's too much to ask...

464
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,011
Oh, no.

465
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,322
I hope no one's hurt.

466
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,727
I'm just sayin' there
are two sides to this.

467
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,362
You know, I haven't made up my mind yet,

468
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,842
because I wanted you to be
involved with my decision.

469
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,202
But I need a change, Ellis.

470
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,204
I deserve one.

471
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,006
I think they're searching people.

472
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,001
How you doin' today, ma'am?

473
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,286
I'm all right, how are you?

474
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,960
I'm doin' just fine. Have you seen
or picked up any hitchhikers today?

475
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,121
No, sir.

476
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,089
Okay, could you open
the back for me, please?

477
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,605
- It's open.
- Okay.

478
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,450
Ma'am, have you seen this man?

479
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,161
No, sir.

480
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,364
Son, have you?

481
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,841
No.

482
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,166
Okay, well, there's been reports
that he's in the area.

483
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,208
So if you see him,
just call 9-1-1 for us, okay?

484
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,725
- Okay.
- What'd he do?

485
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,287
What'd he do?

486
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,165
Move along, please.

487
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,045
Neck, Neck, pick up!

488
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,121
I knew it!

489
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,640
I told you that crazy
son of a bitch was trouble.

490
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,121
Did you tell him where he is?

491
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,845
No, that's why I called you.

492
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,331
He needs to know
people are looking for him.

493
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,204
You think he doesn't know that already?

494
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,284
Jesus, Ellis.
Why do you even think he's on that island?

495
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,289
Ellis, I'm serious.

496
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,725
We don't know who this guy is.

497
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,010
He loves her, Neck. He told me.

498
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,890
I don't give a shit who he loves.

499
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,331
He's not dangerous.

500
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,120
It sounds like a shitload of
state troopers thinks different.

501
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,246
No tellin' where the
hell he's been sleepin'.

502
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,890
He might be gone already.

503
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,681
Shit.

504
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,446
Sorry, boys, but I'm going to have to go
back on our deal for the boat.

505
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,761
I don't feel good about it,
but I don't see any other way

506
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,843
out of what I'm into.

507
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,930
So you know about the state troopers?

508
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,000
What state troopers?

509
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,327
The ones spreadin'
your picture all over the place.

510
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,960
Stoppin' cars on the 165,
searching for your ass.

511
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,843
No, I don't know about that.

512
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,208
But it don't surprise me,
I got a lot of folks lookin' for me.

513
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,281
Why?

514
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,041
I shot a man.

515
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,361
Killed him.

516
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,564
I'm sorry I didn't tell you boys sooner,

517
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,371
but I was hopin' to be long gone
before anything came of it.

518
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,329
Didn't want y'all involved.

519
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,564
Look, y'all been real good to me.

520
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,088
You're the only friends I got out here.

521
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,809
If troopers got 165 blocked, that means
they got other roads blocked, too.

522
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,723
So I ain't goin' to get nowhere in a car.

523
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,323
I want to try getting this boat down.

524
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,205
See if we can get it in the water.

525
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,284
See, with a boat like this,
I can make it to the Gulf in two days.

526
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,687
Heck, from there, I can get anywhere.

527
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,242
But I need a boat at least this big
to make it on the open water.

528
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,204
It's got no title, no owner,

529
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,806
nobody lookin' for it.

530
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,566
It's my best shot.

531
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,006
Who'd you kill?

532
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,009
Just a bad piece of business.

533
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,001
Y'all don't need to hear about it.

534
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,765
I need to hear about it.

535
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,601
Juniper, she...

536
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,125
She made a mistake.

537
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,086
Hooked up with this guy.
He was no good. His name was...

538
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,285
Hutchins. His family owns a chain of
restaurants down in Texas.

539
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,961
Where were you?

540
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,291
I was around, but

541
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,601
me and Juniper was on the outs.

542
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,482
She met him, he sold her on a pack of lies,
he got her pregnant.

543
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,203
That's when he started
showin' who he really was.

544
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,328
He dropped her down a flight of stairs
after whoopin' her half to death.

545
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,801
She lost the baby, he made it so...

546
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,520
Doctors say she can't even have
children no more.

547
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,160
There are things you can get away with in
this world and there are things you can't.

548
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,446
I tracked him down,

549
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,881
found him in a little motel
outside of San Antonio, he was there

550
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,928
with another woman. That's...

551
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,684
That's where it happened.

552
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,490
So I understand if you boys
don't want to help me no more.

553
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,847
But I need this boat.

554
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,446
And I need to get it into the water, fast.

555
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,843
I made a list of things we're going to need.
What you think?

556
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,280
You did it for her?

557
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,361
To protect her?

558
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,601
Yeah.

559
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,081
What you think?

560
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,609
I think you want us to run around,
stickin' our necks out,

561
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,006
getting everything you need

562
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,725
just so you can take our boat.

563
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,161
That's about it.

564
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,401
What do we get out of it?

565
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,561
What you want?

566
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,281
What about that pistol?

567
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,680
Only two things I got out here
worth anything.

568
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,561
This shirt.

569
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,406
And this pistol.

570
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,450
And I can't give you this shirt,
'cause I need it for protection.

571
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,888
But if you help me get this
boat in the water, the pistol,

572
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,605
it's yours.

573
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,481
What kind is it?

574
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,288
Got to get this boat floatin' first.

575
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,561
All right.

576
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,562
All right, y'all scrounge
what you can off this list,

577
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,404
but if we're gonna do this right,

578
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,845
we're gonna need more help.
Can you fetch Tom for me?

579
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,125
Tom Blankenship?

580
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,010
Yeah, I was hopin' to let that
old assassin sit this one out.

581
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,768
We're gonna need him
to get things that y'all can't.

582
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,841
Can you find him?

583
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,762
I know where he lives,
but I've never talked to him.

584
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,928
Just tell him my name, he'll know.

585
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,807
Hey, boys.

586
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,801
Thanks.

587
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,610
Don't lose my pistol.

588
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,521
You coming?

589
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,004
Nah, I'll watch the boat.

590
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,046
Why are you huntin' me?

591
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,051
Are you deaf, boy?
I said why are you huntin' me?

592
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,121
I ain't huntin' you.

593
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,600
What's your business here?

594
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,001
I come to find you.

595
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,606
I got a message for you.

596
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,251
You Senior's boy?

597
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,361
Yes, sir.

598
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,600
What you got to say to me
that he can't tell me himself?

599
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,041
It ain't from him.

600
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,601
Mud sent me.

601
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,881
Mud?

602
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,681
Yes, sir.

603
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,961
What you know about him?

604
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,085
He told me to come find you.

605
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,205
Your daddy know about this?

606
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,081
No, sir.

607
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,091
Mud needs your help.

608
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,400
Where is he?

609
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,606
There he is.

610
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,721
You think that's his daddy?

611
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,881
I don't know.

612
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,687
Sir.

613
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,251
Where is she?

614
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,320
In town.

615
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,080
Got here yesterday.

616
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,966
What are you doing out here like this, Mud?

617
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,487
I killed that last man she was with, Tom.

618
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,651
He had it comin', too.

619
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,925
You have been doggin'
this girl your whole life.

620
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,527
She's run you halfway
across the country and back.

621
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,120
And for what? For this!

622
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,601
Be stuck out here on this island like this!

623
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,121
Beggin'!

624
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,843
A murderer now! A thief!

625
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,440
- I ain't no thief, Tom...
- No? What would you call it then?

626
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,043
Not to mention
draggin' these boys into this...

627
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,122
Man, he's really giving it to him.

628
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,963
You got any idea what you're doin'?

629
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,404
I'm right ashamed of you, Mud.

630
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,885
Don't expect any help from me,
'cause there's none to be given.

631
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,401
All right, I'm ready.

632
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,481
Where you goin'?

633
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,641
Hey!

634
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,087
God damn it.

635
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,961
You all right?

636
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,171
Looks like we're on our own, Ellis.

637
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,761
I didn't want to have to ask you to be
the one to do this, but I need

638
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,726
to get this letter to Juniper.
Can you take it to her for me?

639
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,281
Yeah.

640
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,124
All right, now listen up.

641
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,846
You got to be careful, all right?
You can't just

642
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,367
walk up and knock on her door.
You hear me?

643
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,602
You gotta watch yourself.

644
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,404
I can handle it.

645
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,529
Get that to her.

646
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,641
All right.

647
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,611
All right.

648
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,000
Watch yourself, Ellis.

649
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,841
You Mud's daddy?

650
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,285
Mud don't have no daddy.

651
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,809
No mama either, as far as I could tell.

652
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,880
He was livin' in the woods
when I first met him.

653
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,170
Younger than you are now.

654
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,922
You boys need to watch yourselves now.

655
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,525
What Mud's into is somethin'
you don't want to be involved in.

656
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,363
You best forget about him, you hear?

657
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,721
Which one?

658
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,286
Let's start at the top.

659
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,361
Work our way down.

660
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,041
All right.

661
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,201
What you want?

662
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,403
We're sellin' fish.
Would you like to buy some?

663
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,606
Fish? I don't want to buy no damn fish.

664
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,608
Keep lyin' and I'll crack your nose open!

665
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,566
Keep lyin'!

666
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,881
You hear me, trash? Where is that guy?

667
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,011
Who are you?

668
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,281
Who the hell are you?

669
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,964
He send you?

670
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,487
You know this man?

671
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,483
Look at it! Do you know this man?

672
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,126
Fish! Fish! We're just sellin' fish!

673
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,201
Fish...

674
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,725
I know you know where he is.

675
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,366
And I swear to God,

676
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,847
I'll cut a hole through every
one of you to find him.

677
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,164
We know you came here for him,

678
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,325
and we know he's too stupid
to leave here without you.

679
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,764
So whenever he sticks his head up

680
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,527
out of whatever shithole he's hidin' in,

681
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,731
I'm gonna be there.

682
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,530
You tell him that.

683
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,366
You need to mind your business, boy.

684
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,601
You okay?

685
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,881
Yeah.

686
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,450
Man, he popped your eye.

687
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,605
Let me see your face.

688
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,167
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

689
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,526
Here, hold this on there.

690
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,926
Thank you.

691
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,086
I'll buy your fish, okay?

692
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,082
How much do you want
for the whole cooler?

693
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,040
Mud sent us to give you this.

694
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,721
You know Mud?

695
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,161
Yeah, we know him.

696
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,321
Says, "Hold tight."

697
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,840
We know, we read it.

698
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,923
Well, do you know how long hold tight is?

699
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,520
I think
it's just a couple days.

700
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,330
He wants to get a boat for y'all.

701
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,681
God...

702
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,366
Tell him I'll wait.

703
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,201
But I don't want y'all gettin' involved.

704
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,291
So you tell him what I
said and let that be it.

705
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,081
I don't want you gettin' in any trouble.

706
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,441
We'll be all right.
Just keep your door locked.

707
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,481
We'll be in touch.

708
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,006
Wait.

709
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,481
What's your name?

710
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,809
I'm Ellis, he's Neckbone.

711
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,561
Thank you, Ellis.

712
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,521
We gotta go.

713
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,406
Let's go, hard on.

714
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,283
Hello? Is May Pearl there?

715
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,091
Hey, it's Ellis.

716
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,040
In the phone book.

717
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,481
Tomorrow?

718
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,890
Yeah, I can meet you.

719
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,930
Okay. Bye.

720
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,963
We got more, but no motor.

721
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,405
This will work for now.

722
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,245
Ellis, you get her my note?

723
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,807
Yeah.

724
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,845
Where'd you get that shiner from?

725
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,566
When we came up on Juniper's room,

726
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,760
there was this guy in there,
he was beatin' up on her.

727
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,130
Ellis rushed him.

728
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,531
Got smacked for it.

729
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,126
What'd he look like?

730
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,486
I don't know,

731
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,400
he was tall.

732
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,171
Looked like a cowboy.

733
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,606
Light hair slicked back?

734
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,121
Yeah.

735
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,846
Thank you for looking after her.

736
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,161
His name's Carver,

737
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,005
he's the brother of the man I killed.

738
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,164
If he's here, there's plenty more comin'.

739
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,127
More what?

740
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,851
Bounty hunters. Carver's rotten,

741
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,045
but his old man,

742
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,009
that's the one to be scared of.

743
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,050
He'll spend every dime
he's got to make sure I'm dead.

744
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,451
If it was up to me,

745
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,922
I'd lay the whole family down,
same as the other.

746
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,202
Ain't a decent man between them.

747
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,601
Now, look here.

748
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,970
Listen to me,

749
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,049
if you see that old man,
don't you go near him.

750
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,361
He's the triple six real deal scratch.

751
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,166
What's a scratch?

752
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,485
It's the devil himself.

753
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,043
Let's unload the rest
of this, get it up top.

754
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,765
Now, what are you waitin' for?

755
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,081
Shut up.

756
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,491
All right, Ellis.

757
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,286
Can you climb that trunk,

758
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,843
- choke this off that limb?
- Yeah.

759
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,809
Tie it in a bowline knot, you know it?

760
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,006
I'm not stupid.

761
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,483
Neck, I need you to start cuttin' line

762
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,721
in 15 two-foot pieces.
Count two foot as long as your arm.

763
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,330
Be careful.

764
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,370
What's so special about that shirt
you'd lose your pistol for it?

765
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,809
It's got a wolf's eye sewn into the sleeve.

766
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,009
More protection than a bullet ever gave.

767
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,770
Tom swears by it.

768
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,049
Tom said he wasn't your daddy.

769
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,280
He's the closest thing to
a father I've ever had.

770
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,124
I never met my parents.

771
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,565
It's hard,

772
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,361
not knowin' those you came from.

773
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,363
My Uncle Galen tells me things about 'em.

774
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,680
He's the one that takes care of me.

775
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,723
Yeah. Tom did that for me.

776
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,280
What'd you mean when
you called Tom an assassin?

777
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,840
Tom's had lives you'd
never even know about.

778
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,329
Grew up, up North. Went to Yale.

779
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,168
For a long time,
he was a paid assassin for the CIA.

780
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,243
Lived in Cuba in '63. Shoot, he's killed
more people than you all probably ever met.

781
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,765
Neck, how's that line comin'?

782
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,244
If you're gonna do it, do it!

783
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,445
This shit's crazy.

784
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,681
One down.

785
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,761
Come on.

786
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,645
Wanna sit down?

787
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,643
Hey, you must really like to fight.

788
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,646
Not really.

789
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,281
You got a lot of friends.

790
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,921
They're all right.

791
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,849
I don't know all of them.

792
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,322
I bet you're pretty popular.

793
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,003
Why do you say that?

794
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,888
Because you're nice to people.

795
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,721
How do you know that?

796
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,529
You're nice to me.

797
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,405
But I like you.

798
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,251
I got you something.

799
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,961
A bracelet?

800
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,241
Yeah.

801
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,481
Neckbone's uncle finds them in the river

802
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,291
and collects the pearls, and
I thought with your name and everything...

803
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,361
Thank you.

804
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,522
You wanna be my girlfriend?

805
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,965
You've been seeing Mud?

806
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,441
No.

807
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,050
You don't have to lie to me, boy.

808
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,843
I've seen you running
around, taking things.

809
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,521
He all right?

810
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,121
He's okay.

811
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,131
He called you an assassin.

812
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,410
How long have you known Mud?

813
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,966
A few days.

814
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,207
That's long enough to
know he's full of shit.

815
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,641
So, it's not true?

816
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,244
I was a sharpshooter for awhile

817
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:51,644
in the Marines. In Mud's world, that's an assassin.
But it's not exactly true, right?

818
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,565
Yeah, I guess.

819
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,005
Assassin.

820
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,004
You think he's a badass, don't you?

821
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,161
I don't know.

822
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,887
You know why he's stuck off on that island?

823
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,841
Yeah.

824
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,005
He shot somebody.

825
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,764
You know why he shot that man?

826
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,845
'Cause he hurt Juniper?

827
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,804
Right.

828
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:34,370
The real reason Mud's in all
the trouble he's got is because of her.

829
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,405
He's been in love with that girl
since he was your age.

830
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,363
Trouble is she don't care about nobody
but herself. I've told him as much.

831
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,880
She'd bed down with the meanest snake
she could find,

832
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,089
and then when things got bad,
she'd go runnin' back to Mud.

833
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,484
He'd take her back.

834
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,971
Then he'd go find whatever unlucky
son of a bitch laid a hand on her

835
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,250
and beat him so bad
he'd know never to touch her again.

836
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,165
Only this time, I guess

837
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,961
he figured beatin' wasn't good enough,
he had to go shoot that feller.

838
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,609
I'm not for sure, but I'd put money on it
that she knew he'd do it.

839
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,762
She might even put him up to it.

840
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,244
Either way, those two are set for failure.

841
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,287
The only chance he's got
is to cut her loose.

842
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,285
That'll never happen.

843
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,690
But I tell you what, Mud's no badass.
He's runnin' scared right now...

844
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,125
I've got to go.

845
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,171
You're wrong about Juniper.

846
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,920
They love each other
and they're going to make it.

847
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,165
If you weren't such a worn out
old man, you'd know it was true.

848
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,924
What do you say, Ellis?

849
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,166
I got more stuff.

850
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,208
Yeah? Did you find a motor?

851
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,685
Not yet.

852
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,761
What's that?

853
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,848
Bonfire's my all-purpose cure all

854
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,441
for bad luck.

855
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,443
I don't know where this boat's been

856
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,370
or what kind of person
the owner was before me.

857
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,409
For all I know, there could be some
serious bad business left on it.

858
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,964
We got too much ridin' on this thing
to leave to chance.

859
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,008
Tom called me over
to his place this morning.

860
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,161
What did he say?

861
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,725
He was runnin' down Juniper.

862
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,369
Told him he was a worn out old man.

863
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,200
And he couldn't know
how much you love her.

864
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,284
You don't know his story.

865
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,361
I don't care.

866
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,401
You should.

867
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,688
Tom loved a woman more than
most men can in two lifetimes.

868
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,241
They had a good life started together.

869
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,610
She was pregnant with a little boy,

870
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,363
birth got the best of them.

871
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,209
Tom's been alone ever since.

872
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,685
Lone wolf.

873
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,205
Thanks for the tin.

874
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,487
This shit never gets easy.

875
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,201
That's a good haul.

876
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,211
I've had worse.

877
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,610
You doin' all right?

878
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,441
Yeah.

879
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,764
Do you need to tell me anything?

880
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,647
Tell you what?

881
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,167
I know I'm just your uncle, not a parent.

882
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,042
But you can tell me things if you need to.

883
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,841
I can tell you this helmet
smells like my duck butter.

884
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,049
Where'd you get that black eye?

885
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,480
A kid in town. He got his, too.

886
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,531
What was y'all fightin' for?

887
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,485
About this girl.

888
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,761
What girl?

889
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,400
My girlfriend.

890
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,041
You got a girlfriend?

891
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,006
Yes, sir.

892
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,564
When did that happen?

893
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,046
Other day.

894
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,681
What's her name?

895
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,241
May Pearl.

896
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,524
May Pearl.

897
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,525
Two first names, just like your mother.

898
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,644
Have you seen your mother today?

899
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,201
No.

900
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,726
You're not talkin' to me now?

901
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,326
I'm talkin'. I'm talkin' to both of you.

902
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,004
All y'all want to do is talk.

903
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,565
That's your mother now.

904
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:13,883
She'd rather tongue lash a problem
than step up and handle it.

905
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,161
You'll see one day.

906
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,163
Women are tough, boy.

907
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,723
They set you up for things.

908
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,209
You can't trust love, Ellis.

909
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,805
If you're not careful,
it'll up and run out on you.

910
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,884
Daddy, this is Miller. He's one of ours.

911
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,725
Appreciate your help.

912
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,801
Yes, sir.

913
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,731
We'll be in, in a minute.

914
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,161
Catch me up.

915
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,085
We're working in shifts.

916
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,924
Got two outside her motel.

917
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,800
The others are either out searchin'
or sleepin' here.

918
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,325
I met the county sheriff,
but he wasn't much help.

919
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,290
Said they handle their own business.

920
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,609
But I got two of his people on payroll

921
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,243
and a person inside
at the state police.

922
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,482
Ellis, let's go, boy. Come on.

923
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,161
Okay.

924
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,691
Let's meet the men.

925
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,761
Yes, sir.

926
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,481
Shit.

927
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,806
Get up.

928
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,605
Y'all pay attention.

929
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,850
This is my father, King.

930
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,445
He runs the show.

931
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,081
Men.

932
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,481
All right, everybody up.

933
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,921
Gather around.

934
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,046
Now form a circle.

935
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,205
Everybody, take a knee.

936
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,131
Want you to join hands.

937
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,251
We're gonna pray for the death of
the man who killed my son.

938
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,291
Everybody, bow your heads.

939
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,966
You touch her titty?

940
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,081
A little.

941
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,441
That's great, man.

942
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,011
Thanks.

943
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,447
We could take it apart,
bring it out piece by piece.

944
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,441
It's welded, we'd just tear it up.

945
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,365
What if we float it out?

946
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,441
With what?

947
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,251
Come on.

948
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,891
Oh, Jesus!

949
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,601
What do you think?

950
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,205
That's great, Galen.

951
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,811
Come here, Ellis.

952
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,610
See that ceiling fan up there?

953
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,130
I found it in the river.

954
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,641
Works great.

955
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,489
Best ceiling fan I've ever owned.

956
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,527
This river brings a lot of trash down it.

957
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,403
Some of that trash is worth a lot of money.

958
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,606
Some of it's not.

959
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,931
You got to know what's worth keepin'
and what's worth lettin' go.

960
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,491
You know the difference?

961
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,481
I think so.

962
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,484
Neck looks up to you.

963
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,842
Don't get my nephew into anything
you can't get him out of. Okay?

964
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,045
<i>Help Me, Rhonda's just about a guy needin'</i>

965
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,010
to get a piece to get over
a girl that put one over on him.

966
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,245
So, you get your heart broke?

967
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,207
Don't walk around with
a shit look on your face.

968
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,931
Get back in there, get your tip wet.

969
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,161
You hear me?

970
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,371
- You know what I'm sayin'.
- Let's go.

971
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,687
Want to hang out? Allen's comin' over,
we're going to pump it up.

972
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,361
No. We got stuff to do.

973
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,401
Whatever.

974
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,920
What were y'all talking about?

975
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,770
I don't know.

976
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,570
<i>King! That's what they call him.</i>

977
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,571
Y'all didn't go near him, did ya?

978
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,121
No.

979
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,167
Good.

980
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,480
How we lookin' on that motor?

981
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,403
There's one in the scrap yard
that might work.

982
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,640
We're gonna need one that runs.

983
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,281
- I can get it runnin'. Tell him, Ellis.
- Let's pull this.

984
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,926
It's true, he built his own dirt bike.

985
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,124
Little more.

986
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,731
Neck, take a shot at it.

987
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,688
I don't know, that motor's worth somethin'.

988
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,201
It's not like all the rest of that junk.

989
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,248
It's been there for months.
Nobody will even know it's gone.

990
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,401
Ellis.

991
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,641
We need a motor.

992
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,441
<i>Winds out of
the west at 22 miles per hour...</i>

993
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,166
Hello?

994
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,281
<i>Juniper?</i>

995
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,401
Ellis.

996
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,601
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

997
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,121
Thank God. I'm goin' crazy in this room.

998
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,847
Is Mud okay?

999
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,129
Yeah, it's time to take you out to him.

1000
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,961
<i>Now?</i>

1001
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,801
Tomorrow.

1002
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,360
Tomorrow, we'll come get you.

1003
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,610
<i>He's got a plan for y'all to get away.</i>

1004
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,040
Be ready tomorrow at 5:00.

1005
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,840
Neckbone'll be waitin' at the side
of the motel with a dirt bike.

1006
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,570
Wait, just...

1007
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,440
Just wait a minute.
I don't know about all that.

1008
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,805
<i>Where does he think we're gonna go?</i>

1009
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,130
What are we even gonna do?

1010
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,922
This is Mud, this is exactly what he does.

1011
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,767
<i>It's okay.</i>

1012
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:37,966
It's a good plan.

1013
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,481
Just be ready.

1014
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,164
Why are you doing this?

1015
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,526
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1016
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,164
Why are you helping us?

1017
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,844
Because y'all love each other.

1018
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,241
I'll see you tomorrow.

1019
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,606
Wait.

1020
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,681
- How'd it go?
- We're good.

1021
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,801
Give me a quarter.

1022
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,921
May Pearl!

1023
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,721
May Pearl!

1024
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,169
It's all right, man, she's with her family.

1025
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,046
Come on, I want to get
that motor before dark.

1026
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,361
Hey.

1027
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,530
Y'all remember me, don't ya?

1028
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,121
Sorry about that.

1029
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,281
You caught me at a real bad time.

1030
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,481
Hold on a second.

1031
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,281
Just a sec.

1032
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,008
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

1033
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,523
Y'all were just doin' a job
and I got in the way.

1034
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,405
What do you say I buy a whole batch
of fish y'all were sellin'?

1035
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:08,681
Forty cover it?

1036
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,201
That'll about do it.

1037
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,765
We don't want your money.

1038
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,371
Hold on. Hold on.

1039
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,765
Y'all get around, don't you?

1040
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,411
Bet ya know every

1041
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,923
hole and ditch in this town.

1042
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,650
You haven't come across that man
whose picture I showed you?

1043
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,721
Have you?

1044
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,081
Sure about that?

1045
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,365
Take a look with your good eye.

1046
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,407
I'm sure.

1047
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,764
What about that girl from the motel?

1048
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,011
The pretty one.

1049
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,729
Talk to her some more?

1050
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,000
There's a number on there.

1051
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,971
Let me know if you do.

1052
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,041
This is it. This is it.

1053
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,085
All right, it's loose.

1054
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,001
Shit's heavy.

1055
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,401
Shit!

1056
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,811
Was she there?

1057
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,450
No.

1058
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,965
Come on.

1059
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,206
Excuse me, sir.

1060
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,685
What?

1061
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,120
We're lookin' for the girl in room 210.
You seen her?

1062
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,561
Yeah, I've seen her.

1063
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,801
You seen her today?

1064
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,251
Yeah, she came down here
lookin' for a bar nearby.

1065
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,482
Sent her up to that place off 61.

1066
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:07,402
Just leave it there,
Mud's going to have to help us with it.

1067
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,568
What are you going to tell him?

1068
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,241
I'll just tell him the truth.

1069
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,283
Hey, what you say there, Ellis?

1070
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,845
Tom left this for you.

1071
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,564
Where's Juniper?

1072
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,325
Ellis, what happened?

1073
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,290
Is she okay?

1074
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,165
Was it Carver?

1075
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,481
It wasn't Carver.

1076
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:04,846
What's goin' on, Ellis?

1077
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,880
She was supposed to meet us
on the side of the motel.

1078
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,326
She never showed up.

1079
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,963
We went around looking for her.

1080
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,329
Motel clerk said she
went out to a bar on 61.

1081
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,925
We tracked her down.

1082
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,005
She was there with another guy.

1083
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,000
They were together.

1084
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,202
She must've thought Carver

1085
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,850
was onto her.

1086
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,891
She knew the plan, Mud.

1087
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,451
She just didn't show up.

1088
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,684
What was she doin' with that guy?

1089
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,604
What was she doin' with that guy, Ellis?

1090
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,490
They were playing pool.

1091
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,211
And they were drinkin'.

1092
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,881
And laughin'.

1093
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,050
He was close up on her.

1094
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,884
He kissed her neck.

1095
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,924
So that's how it is?

1096
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,245
We got that motor.

1097
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,924
What do you want us to do?

1098
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,044
Just go home, Ellis.

1099
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,401
Hello?

1100
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:02,881
Is May Pearl there?

1101
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,083
This is Ellis.

1102
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,564
I called yesterday,
you didn't give her my messages?

1103
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,600
I said it's Ellis.

1104
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,841
I'm her boyfriend.

1105
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,208
- Oh, she's asleep...
- Mary Lee!

1106
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,601
Mary Lee!

1107
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,762
What the hell have you been doin'?

1108
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,840
What have you been doin'?

1109
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,360
- Senior, damn it! Damn it! Stop it!
- You tell her what you've been doin'.

1110
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,602
- I don't know what you're sayin'.
- Take your hands off him, Senior!

1111
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:28,571
J.J. Crawford said a boat motor
went missin' from his stockyard!

1112
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:32,326
He said his daughter saw this one
and his friend haulin' it off!

1113
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:36,166
Now, you tell me, right now,
did you steal that motor?

1114
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,366
We didn't steal it.

1115
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,170
You lie to me again.

1116
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,885
We thought it was junk.

1117
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,406
We didn't think it was worth anything.

1118
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,481
Ellis?

1119
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,608
You tellin' me I raised a thief?

1120
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,887
I'm not a thief.

1121
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:54,122
You take property that's not yours,

1122
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,886
property that belongs to another man.

1123
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,686
That junk was his livelihood.

1124
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,563
- I'm ashamed of you!
- Senior...

1125
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,761
Shut your mouth.

1126
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,248
You think you can take things
and not have him see it?

1127
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,723
Neither one of you's got any respect
for a man's livelihood!

1128
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,768
A life that puts clothes on your back
and food in your stomach!

1129
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,524
Don't you blame this on me.

1130
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,521
One doesn't have a thing to do
with the other and you know it.

1131
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,648
You don't tell me what I know.

1132
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,807
If you can steal a man's life
out from under him

1133
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,009
and think he won't take a lesson from that,
then you're dumber than you look.

1134
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,645
- Stop it, Dad!
- And she's raisin' you

1135
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,768
a snake, just like herself.

1136
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,844
And you can curl up beside her
before I give a goddamn!

1137
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,963
But you just remember this, boy.

1138
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,846
You just remember, when they come in here
and they tear this place apart

1139
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,924
board by board! You hear me?

1140
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:51,486
You are a man who's never had
the strength to support his own life.

1141
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:56,761
Ellis.

1142
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,080
You'll return that motor
from where you found it,

1143
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:04,442
and you'll apologize in person
to the man you took it from.

1144
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,527
I won't hear about
anything like this again.

1145
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,325
I can't take that motor back.

1146
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,880
But I can pay him for it.

1147
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,210
I'll give him what he wants.

1148
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,888
I don't care what you do, Ellis.

1149
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,681
What the hell's all this?

1150
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,161
It's a bonfire.

1151
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,168
I guess he didn't care about bein' seen.

1152
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,043
He had something else on his mind.

1153
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,130
What you all hidin' for?

1154
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,441
Found your shirt.

1155
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:11,361
You can keep it.

1156
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,085
I don't need it no more.

1157
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,042
Saw what's left of your bonfire.

1158
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,851
Somebody could have seen you.

1159
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:29,681
I guess.

1160
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,970
Do some drinkin' last night?

1161
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,889
I did a lot of drinkin' last night.

1162
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:40,129
Neck, I'm gonna need you
to stay here and get this motor runnin'.

1163
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,762
Ellis, I need you to do
somethin' else for me.

1164
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,970
I need you to get that to Juniper.

1165
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,601
Okay, Mud.

1166
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:51,680
Neck, let's go.

1167
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,366
You still takin' Juniper?

1168
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,681
Neck, fetch me that socket wrench.

1169
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:13,525
You be all right?

1170
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,523
Yeah. How about you?

1171
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,641
He'll be okay.

1172
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,686
Can I borrow your bike?

1173
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,761
Yeah.

1174
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,651
Don't tump it.

1175
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,569
I was wonderin' when I'd see you.

1176
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,451
Sorry about last night.

1177
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,045
I'm supposed to give this to you.

1178
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:20,641
What?

1179
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,201
Okay.

1180
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,401
Did you read it?

1181
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,081
No.

1182
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:35,721
I gotta go.

1183
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,041
Ellis.

1184
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,805
I said I was sorry.

1185
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,810
All you had to do was be there.

1186
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:43,881
I couldn't.

1187
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,085
Then Why'd you even come here?

1188
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,449
I came here to leave with him.

1189
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,001
I did.

1190
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,967
You know you don't know him, right?

1191
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,808
I know he'd do anything for you.

1192
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,605
Is that what you think?

1193
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:09,971
Mud's a born liar.

1194
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:15,085
That's why people like him,
he makes them feel good about themselves.

1195
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,611
I do love him.

1196
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,520
I just

1197
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,602
can't spend the rest of my life
runnin' away with him.

1198
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,250
Tell him I understand.

1199
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,521
What's it say?

1200
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,324
Says, "It's over."

1201
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,765
Bye, Ellis.

1202
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,651
Did you get my phone calls?

1203
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,324
- What?
- I've been tryin' to call you.

1204
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,807
- Who's this guy?
- Get your head out of my car, kid.

1205
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,161
- Ellis!
- I called you twice!

1206
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,770
Stop it, Kyle!

1207
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:45,246
Stop it!

1208
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,481
Kyle!

1209
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,445
Stop it, Kyle!

1210
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,561
God!

1211
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:55,680
What the hell you doin' here, Ellis?

1212
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,761
What?

1213
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,920
You can't just run up
and punch people I'm with.

1214
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:04,528
I'm sorry, I just wanted to know
why you hadn't called me back.

1215
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,403
Why would I call you back, Ellis?

1216
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:10,926
Because you're my girlfriend.

1217
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,126
I'm not your girlfriend.

1218
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,041
We've been on one date.

1219
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,201
One.

1220
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,961
Yeah, but...

1221
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,447
But what? What'd you expect, Ellis?

1222
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,886
I love you.

1223
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,725
You're 14.

1224
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,644
I don't know. He's just this kid.

1225
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,485
Come on, let's...

1226
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,726
Try it now.

1227
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,201
Nothin'.

1228
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,010
Son of a bitch.

1229
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,846
What she say?

1230
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,491
You're a liar!

1231
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,368
Makin' two kids run around,
doin' all the work

1232
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,681
because you're too scared
to do it yourself!

1233
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,449
Makin' me tell her it's over
because you're too scared!

1234
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,208
You said you loved her and you lied!

1235
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,447
You gave up on her,
and she gave up on you!

1236
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,091
Just like everybody else!

1237
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,331
I trusted you!

1238
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,726
Bonfires and crosses
and wolf's eye... Bullshit!

1239
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,531
Now, come on, Ellis.

1240
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:41,285
Every single thing you told me was a lie!

1241
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:45,691
You never cared about her,
and you never cared about us!

1242
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,765
Not enough to matter!

1243
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,647
You used us.

1244
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,369
You made me a thief!

1245
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,361
Let me talk to him.

1246
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,481
Ellis!

1247
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,046
Ellis, come on!

1248
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,970
Ellis, wait a minute.

1249
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,201
Ellis!

1250
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,241
Shit.

1251
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,681
Mud!

1252
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,922
Ellis! He fell in the creek!

1253
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,484
He fell into the snakes!

1254
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,165
Mud, please!

1255
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,804
Get the motor started, Neck!

1256
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,244
Is he okay? Is he bit?

1257
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,041
Shit.

1258
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:24,685
What time is it?

1259
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,925
What time is it?

1260
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:29,691
4:18!

1261
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,721
Yell it out every 10 minutes.

1262
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:33,961
Okay.

1263
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:39,607
Is he going to be okay?

1264
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,530
Got to get him to the clinic.

1265
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,250
Are you bit?

1266
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:49,841
No.

1267
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:09,084
My bike's up there!

1268
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,405
Need some help here!

1269
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,566
Snake bite!

1270
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,050
- It's a snake bite!
- Stay calm.

1271
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,571
Cottonmouth.

1272
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,485
Just under an hour.

1273
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,929
Okay, we'll take care of him.
Let's go! Let's go, people.

1274
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:10,921
Sir.

1275
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,961
We're going to need
some information from you.

1276
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,561
Sir.

1277
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:29,601
Sir!

1278
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:49,761
Hello?

1279
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,521
It's okay.

1280
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,886
Just sit back.

1281
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:50,841
Where am I?

1282
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,645
You're home.

1283
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,243
We brought you home.

1284
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,526
Come on, sit up.

1285
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:00,601
Come on.

1286
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,371
You had us scared, son.

1287
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,449
I'm so glad you're okay.

1288
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,288
The doctors
gave you some medicine.

1289
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,124
You had a snake bite.

1290
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,528
How did I get to the doctor?

1291
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:22,090
A man brought you in.

1292
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,450
No one knew him.

1293
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,085
Oh, no, no, it's all right.

1294
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,680
You just rest now. We'll
talk about it later.

1295
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:35,484
Do you need anything? Are you hungry?

1296
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,361
No.

1297
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:42,161
Come on, let him get some rest.

1298
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:49,047
I'll be back in to check on you.

1299
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,645
Mom? Dad?

1300
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,680
I love you.

1301
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,444
We love you, too, Ellis.

1302
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:51,403
The sun does
shine on a dog's ass some days?

1303
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,406
It ain't sunk yet.

1304
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,086
Wish Ellis could see it.

1305
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,001
I know.

1306
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,241
Well...

1307
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,402
Looks like you get your end of the deal.

1308
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:13,647
Where's the bullets?

1309
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,005
Deal was for the gun, not the bullets.

1310
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:18,761
Shit.

1311
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,081
Yeah.

1312
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,651
Neck, I've got one more
favor I want to ask of you.

1313
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,081
Mud?

1314
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,605
Don't get up.

1315
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,046
How'd you get here?

1316
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:14,080
Neck brought me.

1317
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:30,285
We got the boat in the water.

1318
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:31,885
- You did?
- Yeah.

1319
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,129
Smooth sailing from here on out.

1320
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:43,489
Wouldn't have felt right leavin' town
without comin' to say goodbye.

1321
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,925
I'm sorry about what I said.

1322
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,969
No, you were right to be mad.
You were right about a lot of things.

1323
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,927
I don't traffic in the truth too often, but

1324
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:00,691
I did love her.

1325
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:03,161
I do

1326
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,211
love her.

1327
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,685
She loves you, too.

1328
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:10,161
She said it.

1329
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:16,001
Yeah, I just made mistakes.
Heck, we both did, you know.

1330
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:18,765
It's a hard life to keep up with,

1331
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:22,481
can't blame her for
gettin' tired of tryin'.

1332
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:28,167
My dad says you can't
count on women loving you.

1333
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,848
He said you can't trust them.

1334
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,810
That's not true.

1335
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,207
You're a good man, Ellis.

1336
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:46,130
You meet a girl half as good as you,
you're going to be all right.

1337
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,686
You're a good man, too, Mud.

1338
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:55,281
No.

1339
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,008
No, I ain't, Ellis.

1340
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,650
Maybe from here on out, I can...

1341
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,441
Stay put.

1342
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:16,201
Ellis!

1343
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:17,881
Ellis!

1344
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:21,371
Don't move.

1345
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,001
Mud!

1346
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,046
Let him go.

1347
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:03,006
You still down there, buddy?

1348
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:05,248
- Yeah.
- All right, stay put.

1349
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:45,644
Flush him out this way.

1350
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:08,641
Mud!

1351
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,006
Mud!

1352
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:23,641
Mud!

1353
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,486
Mud!

1354
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:31,407
- Mud!
- Ellis!

1355
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,721
Ellis!

1356
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:36,364
Ellis. Ellis.

1357
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:40,207
It's okay.

1358
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:00,681
Hello?

1359
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,491
You're speaking to him.

1360
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,966
He's dead?

1361
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:45,161
Hey.

1362
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:47,561
You got your bike back?

1363
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,721
Yeah.

1364
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:51,090
Mud dinged the shit out of it.

1365
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:57,410
They're really doing it.

1366
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:01,971
It's the law.

1367
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:04,361
It's bullshit.

1368
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:08,361
They ever find Tom?

1369
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:11,364
No. He's gone.

1370
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:15,526
I heard on the news,

1371
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:19,364
they still hadn't found Mud's body.

1372
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:22,605
You think he's dead?

1373
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:26,121
I don't know.

1374
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:27,761
I hope not.

1375
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:33,451
I gotta go.

1376
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:35,922
Come by the apartments later,
help me fix up my room.

1377
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,001
All right.

1378
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:55,121
I'll see you next week?

1379
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:57,606
You betcha.

1380
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:03,881
Ellis.

1381
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,330
You mind your mother, okay?

1382
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:08,210
This is a big change for her, too.

1383
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,685
She's gonna need your support.

1384
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:12,601
Yes, sir.

1385
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,001
All right.

1386
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:21,361
I love you.

1387
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:27,321
I love you, too.

1388
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:10,610
Come on, son.

1389
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:13,005
You gotta see this.
