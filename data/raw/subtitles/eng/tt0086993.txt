1
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,003
This way.

2
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,169
Court is assembled

3
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,048
by the Right Honorable Lords,
Commissioners of the Admiralty

4
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:03,762
and I quote: "To enquire into the cause
and circumstances of the seizure

5
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,432
of His Majesty's armed vessel,
The Bounty,

6
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,435
commanded by
Lieutenant William Bligh

7
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,105
and to try the said
Lieutenant William Bligh

8
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,568
for his conduct
on that occasion."

9
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,531
Surrender your sword
and be seated.

10
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,472
Lieutenant Bligh.

11
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,851
Perhaps it would be useful if you
told the court in your own words

12
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:55,480
the events
of April 28th last year.

13
00:05:55,605 --> 00:06:02,195
Yes, sir. If it please, my Lords,
I will first read a list of the mutineers

14
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,697
who seized my ship.

15
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:09,619
The crew is not on trial here,
Mr Bligh. You, sir, are on trial.

16
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:14,708
The question at issue is
how you came to lose your ship.

17
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,586
To understand that, Captain Greetham,
it is essential to know

18
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,588
who were the mutineers
aboard that ship.

19
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:25,468
Alleged mutineers.
Continue, Mr Bligh.

20
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,513
Fletcher Christian,
Masters Mate.

21
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,142
Wasn't this Christian
a friend of yours?

22
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,977
He was, sir.

23
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,479
Fifty guineas says he's dead.

24
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,191
- Sixty says he's alive.
- I'll wager he's still alive.

25
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,818
How much?

26
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,445
We'll dine within the hour.

27
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,864
- How much?
- Sixty guineas.

28
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,950
Taken.

29
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,331
I'll be back to collect it.

30
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,461
William!

31
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,629
Fletcher!
What are you all doing?

32
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,506
One of our members collapsed.

33
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,550
We're betting on
whether or not he's dead.

34
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:10,972
- What brings you to this den of iniquity?
- Is there somewhere we can talk?

35
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,775
It's a breadfruit.

36
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,026
Breadfruit?

37
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,737
The Admiralty has instructed me
to lead an expedition,

38
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,741
to take breadfruit plants
from Tahiti to Jamaica.

39
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,242
Tahiti?

40
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,037
Fletcher, I want you
to sail with me again.

41
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,747
In what capacity?

42
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:40,043
Well, the Admiralty's already assigned
a Mr John Fryer as Master of the ship.

43
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,338
He's a good man, I think.
But I want you to be Master's Mate.

44
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,758
- If you agree, that is.
- Agreed.

45
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,344
Good, splendid! Good.

46
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,887
Why take breadfruit to Jamaica?

47
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,391
Cheap fodder for the slaves
on the plantations there.

48
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,060
Bananas are very expensive
there these days.

49
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,396
It lacks glory, William.

50
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,357
Well, I don't have your connections,
you see, Fletcher.

51
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,693
I want to make a name for myself,
before I'm too old.

52
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:09,197
And this green grocery trip
will make your name?

53
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:15,495
Now look, we'll go around
Cape Horn to Tahiti.

54
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,498
We'll pick up the breadfruit
then continue on

55
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,252
through the Endeavour Straits around
the Cape of Good Hope to Jamaica.

56
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,588
And then back to England.
We'll circumnavigate the globe.

57
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,466
Yes, but why risk going
round the Horn? - What?

58
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,761
Because it is the
quicker route, Mr Fryer.

59
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,472
Quicker if we strike the
one week in a hundred

60
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,058
when there isn't
a storm raging.

61
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,479
So you would have us go the long way?
Around Africa and Australia.

62
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,567
There and back.
Avoid the Horn altogether.

63
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,072
What conditions
do the plants need?

64
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,618
Warmth, light and water.
I shall be giving up my cabin to them.

65
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,371
We shall be like little pigs
in a stye. Shan't we?

66
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,334
No, sir, we shall not.
I run a healthy ship, Mr Fryer.

67
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,711
I only say
the Bounty's too small.

68
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,547
We should have a frigate,
not a chamber pot.

69
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,259
Yes, and I should have
promotion to Captain.

70
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:17,223
But the Navy Board would
not heed either request. See?

71
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,436
Quickly now, children.

72
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,063
Ah, my little ones.

73
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,689
They've come to say goodnight.

74
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:30,779
Goodnight, goodnight.
Off you go...

75
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:36,117
Aren't you going to say goodnight to
Mr Christian, Mr Fryer? - Don't I get a kiss?

76
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,498
Goodnight, young ladies.

77
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,292
Goodnight, goodnight.

78
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,423
William, a toast.
To circumnavigation.

79
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,758
To circumnavigation.

80
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,510
Circumnavigation.

81
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,595
And your safe
and speedy return.

82
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,972
Yes.

83
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,290
{y:i}We set sail
{y:i}two days before Christmas,

84
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,335
{y:i}23rd December 1787.

85
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,922
Stand by to set the mainsail.

86
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:48,481
What are you staring at me for? Aloft!
Loose that mizzen topsail, lively!

87
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,526
Remove some of these gussets!

88
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,070
Back down in the rigging!

89
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,323
Stand by, you crew gunners!

90
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,494
Away, you crew gunners.

91
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,255
Southwest by south.
That's your course.

92
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,051
Southwest by south.
Aye, aye, sir.

93
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:54,130
Right men! Food up!
Come on.

94
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:06,017
What's the name of the cook?
Lamb? Hey, Lamb!

95
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:10,480
I hope you got some lamb
in that stew.

96
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,984
Hey, is it true
what they say about Tahiti?

97
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,569
You mean the women.

98
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,406
Do they really go around
with no clothes on?

99
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:23,910
All they wear is tattoos.
In wonderful places.

100
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:24,869
True?

101
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,707
Cross my heart.
Paradise.

102
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,127
You're in my place, Quintel.

103
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,632
Move yourself.

104
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,346
Don't look at him.
There'll be trouble.

105
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,645
I said you're in my seat.

106
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,107
- Piss off.
- Bugger off.

107
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,443
- What did you say?
- Shut it, Churchill.

108
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,029
You keep out of this.

109
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,533
Look out, he's got a knife.

110
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,160
Keep it quiet, Churchill.

111
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,163
Keep it down, lads.

112
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,083
Churchill!

113
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,141
The King.

114
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,353
The King.
God bless him.

115
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,397
To the ship.
May she swim well.

116
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,941
The ship.

117
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,002
The men are very quiet.

118
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,894
Charming tune.

119
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:18,358
And a fine musician.
We're lucky to have him.

120
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,946
Yes. He is not there
by chance, Mr Nelson.

121
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,950
Having him there
is good for morale.

122
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,328
Dr Huggen, another glass?

123
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,580
No, thank you, sir.

124
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,042
You're uncommonly
abstemious tonight.

125
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,255
Well, more men have died
at sea from drink,

126
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,259
disease and dirt than
ever died by drowning.

127
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,969
Depend upon it, gentlemen.

128
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,638
I'm determined the Bounty
shall not lose a single man.

129
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:52,100
By heavens!
I'll drink to that.

130
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,840
- Striking a superior officer.
- No, I didn't.

131
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,843
- It's a hanging offence, sir.
- Sorry, sir.

132
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:30,889
Can't be helped. We shall all get
to know each other pretty closely.

133
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,641
I wonder what
we shall find out.

134
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:37,228
It depends how inquisitive
we are, Mr Young.

135
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,327
It doesn't sound quite right to me.

136
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,289
Do you think someone
had better go and look?

137
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,893
Good evening, Mr Heywood, sir.

138
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,228
Good evening, Adams.

139
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,021
Evening, Mr Adams, sir.

140
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,648
Everything alright here?

141
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,485
Couldn't be better, sir.

142
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,538
My place.

143
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,915
Stupid buggers.

144
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,959
You watch your
mouth too, old man.

145
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:46,256
Don't old man me, Churchill.
You haven't got a lucky face.

146
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,613
Seasick, Mr Heywood, sir?

147
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,950
Just leaving England.

148
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,286
Home sick.

149
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,749
- Feels you'll never see it again.
- Don't say that, sir. It's bad luck.

150
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:27,172
Sorry. Never been to sea before.
Two months ago I was still at school.

151
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,966
Never been to school meself.

152
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,801
Can't even read.

153
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,553
I can't steer a ship.

154
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:39,267
Any fool can steer a ship, sir.
It's just knowing where to take it.

155
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,928
{y:i}23rd December 1787.

156
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:19,307
{y:i}The end of our
{y:i}first day at sea.

157
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:31,611
Tot of rum, sir?

158
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,279
No, thank you, no.

159
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,532
Come on, sir. We don't cross
the Equator every day.

160
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:41,204
No. Thank you. No. Make sure
Mr Heywood has some, though.

161
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,876
OK. That'll do.
Haul him in. Away.

162
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:50,839
Coming up for sup,
Mr Heywood. Sir.

163
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,569
Here you go, sir. Have some of that.
Have some of that, sir.

164
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:17,866
Revive the spirit as they say.
Have a sup of that. Go on.

165
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,705
Get some of this
muck down you.

166
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,043
Well done, sir.

167
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,712
Thank you, Quintel.

168
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:39,179
Lieutenant Bligh,
I have your log here before me.

169
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:44,225
In it, there is the frequent entry
of a single word: dancing.

170
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,770
Can you explain that?

171
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:47,937
I can, sir.

172
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:52,859
A crew on a long voyage may easily
fall into melancholy and violence.

173
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:56,237
I believe this can be relieved
by regular exercise.

174
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:00,241
So for 20 minutes each day, I had the
crew mustered and I had them dance.

175
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,911
- Dance?
- Yes. They danced.

176
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,373
An activity they participated
in wholeheartedly?

177
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,624
I think so. Yes.

178
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,834
And yet, Mr Bligh,
in your own log,

179
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,713
you admit that this rather
unorthodox form of exercise

180
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,257
led to grave discontent.

181
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:20,887
On one occasion only, sir.
And not grave.

182
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:45,286
Charlie. If you only had a frock on,
I'd ask you for a dance.

183
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,166
Get your knees up, Quintel.

184
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,793
I'm doing me best, sir.

185
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,379
Don't answer back.

186
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,010
We're bloody sailors,
not bloody dancers.

187
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:04,014
Mr Christian. Mr Young.
Put a gag on Quintel.

188
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,640
It wasn't bloody me!

189
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,643
Don't make it worse, Quintel.

190
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,312
It wasn't him, sir. It was me.

191
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,814
Come along, Mr Christian.

192
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,733
You've got the wrong man, sir.

193
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,194
Churchill said it was he
who made the remark.

194
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,160
Gag them both.

195
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,829
Jesus Christ.

196
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:35,170
- Do as he says, Mr Christian.
- Sir!

197
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,688
Fletcher.

198
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,483
William, don't you think those men
have been gagged there long enough?

199
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,943
They were both guilty
of an act of insubordination.

200
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:02,238
I could have passed it off with
a laugh and have done less harm.

201
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,367
The Royal Navy is not a
humorous institution, sir.

202
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:09,287
And insubordination
is no laughing matter.

203
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:13,333
However, you may cut them
loose, Mr Christian.

204
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,336
But mind they appreciate
the gravity of their offence.

205
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,797
Thank you, sir.

206
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,429
Captain's orders.

207
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:30,725
Yeah. Sure.

208
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:35,230
You can close your mouth.
Or I'll put it back in.

209
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:06,970
I hadn't expected this from the Horn.
Do you think the weather will stay with us?

210
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,514
Perhaps.

211
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,522
It doesn't look much. Does it?

212
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:21,651
No, no, it doesn't, sir. But I've
seen the Horn when the waves

213
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:26,906
were as high as three houses
one on top of the other.

214
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:31,661
I once saw six men washed
overboard on one wave.

215
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,874
Someone on this ship
is very lucky.

216
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,836
Mr Fryer! Close reef!

217
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,212
Close reef, sir?

218
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:45,342
Don't argue with me.
Close reef.

219
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,639
Close reef, Mr Cole.

220
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:59,606
Stand by to close reef! All hands
on deck! Move yourselves!

221
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:05,445
- Hurry along and take those sails in!
- Get further aloft!

222
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,366
Hurry up! - Move yourselves!
Get those sails in!

223
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:13,870
Doesn't seem to like
fair weather, does he?

224
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,835
Haul on that sheet!
Get those sails in!

225
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:10,802
Mr Fryer. I seem to have
made a misjudgement.

226
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,680
You don't make many, sir.

227
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,224
Make sail.

228
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,309
Make sail, Mr Cole.

229
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:27,402
Aye, Aye, sir. Prepare to make sail!
Let go sheets and tack!

230
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,462
Square away!

231
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:57,515
Get aloft!

232
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:30,674
Someone!

233
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:36,388
- Mr Christian!
- Move on!

234
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,990
Pull! Pull!

235
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:15,552
Robert, mind those bloody pots! Robert!
Robert's on fire! Someone douse him!

236
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,060
We'll all be killed!

237
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,771
All hands on deck!

238
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,399
Everyone on deck!

239
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:31,943
Close the hatches!

240
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:40,243
- Take the wheel, man.
- Steering to port side.

241
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,768
The wheel, McKoy!

242
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:43,640
You all right, sir?

243
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,976
Man those pumps!

244
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:51,564
Jamie, hold that board.
Someone!

245
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:55,568
Don't let go on the pumps!

246
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,863
Somebody get a bloody hammer!

247
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,616
Sir! Sir!

248
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,743
Have the carpenter lash
those things down, now!

249
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,120
- We must turn back!
- What?

250
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:06,705
In my opinion,
we should put about.

251
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,792
In my opinion we should not, sir.
We keep on our course.

252
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:14,421
You'll never make it round the Horn.
We must turn back.

253
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,923
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!

254
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:18,717
I want my opinion in the log, sir.

255
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,928
Mr Cole, have that lashed down.
And all the men on deck, now!

256
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:23,972
I want my opinion in the log!

257
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,516
Very well, Mr Fryer. If that's
what you wish, you shall have it.

258
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:27,517
The ship can't stand it!

259
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:29,394
The ship can stand it
very well, Mr Fryer!

260
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,146
And how long do you think
the men can stand it?

261
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,231
As long as the officers
can stand it, Mr Fryer!

262
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:36,943
Get these things
tied down now!

263
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:47,704
Valentine!
Come with me, boy!

264
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:57,130
Mr Bligh, how long did you
attempt to round the Horn?

265
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:58,798
31 days.

266
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:02,927
And how far did you
travel in that time?

267
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:08,808
- 85 miles, sir.
- 85 miles in 31 days, Mr Bligh.

268
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:12,562
You endangered your ship
and your crew for 31 days

269
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:17,692
in order to satisfy your ambition
to circumnavigate the globe.

270
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,082
{y:i}My dearest Betsy,

271
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:36,586
{y:i}Only to you in this bitter moment
{y:i}can I reveal my heart.

272
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:40,465
{y:i}I have failed completely
{y:i}in my attempt to round Cape Horn

273
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,551
{y:i}and circumnavigate the globe.

274
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:49,516
{y:i}My doubts about Mr Fryer's
{y:i}commitment to our endeavour

275
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,602
{y:i}have been confirmed.

276
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:57,440
Enter.

277
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,447
- The men are assembled, sir.
- Come in. Come in.

278
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,667
I'm very sorry, William.

279
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:20,130
It can't be helped.
Come along.

280
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:27,470
Lads!

281
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:48,825
We will go about and run downwind
for Africa and the Indian Ocean.

282
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,702
- Mr Lamb!
- Here, sir.

283
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:55,206
As soon as we have put about it will be
safe to light your galley fires again.

284
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:57,584
Tonight I want as much hot mush
as every man can eat.

285
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,170
Let's hear it for the
Captain, lads! Hip-hip!

286
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,464
Hooray! Hooray!

287
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:08,303
However. However. We're still
faced with a long hard voyage.

288
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:11,806
I mean to make good use
of every hour of sailing time.

289
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:16,603
And to assist me in this, I'm replacing
Mr Fryer with Mr Christian

290
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,897
who will now act as
executive second in command

291
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,732
with the rank of
Acting Second Lieutenant.

292
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:25,111
Mr Fryer, come back here.
Mr Fryer, sir! Come back here!

293
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:33,036
You'll dismiss when I have done
with you, sir. Do you hear me?

294
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:35,246
- This is an outrage!
- Mr Fryer.

295
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:36,289
In all my years at sea...

296
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:37,999
Your years at sea?
Good Lord, man.

297
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:39,000
If I had known your nature,

298
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,878
I would not have accepted you
as boson of a river barge.

299
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,046
Must I suffer this before...

300
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,090
You'll suffer my correction,
whenever you're at fault, sir!

301
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:45,882
What fault?

302
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,843
Damn your eyes, man!
You turned your back on me!

303
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,595
- For that I apologize.
- Very well.

304
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,514
- But I protest.
- You protest, do you?

305
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:53,932
I am Master of The Bounty.

306
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:58,728
And I am Commander, by law!
I am the first. Do you understand?

307
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:01,690
God damn your hide.

308
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:07,112
And now you may dismiss, sir!

309
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:28,675
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.

310
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,303
All hands on deck.
If you please.

311
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:43,440
Surely, Mr Bligh. It was unwise
to replace a professional sailor

312
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:47,360
like Mr Fryer
with a relative novice?

313
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:50,238
Fletcher Christian could
hardly be called a novice, sir.

314
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,532
The fact that he was
a good friend of yours,

315
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:55,577
was not of undue
influence upon you?

316
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:58,038
Let me know the intent of
your question, Mr Greetham.

317
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:02,000
We're trying to establish, Mr Bligh,
how you came to lose your ship.

318
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,835
I did not lose my ship, sir!

319
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,131
It was taken from me by a gang of
mutineers led by Fletcher Christian.

320
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,591
The man you promoted.

321
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:13,678
Yes. I promoted him because
John Fryer was grossly inefficient.

322
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:17,932
And he was also a coward.
Fletcher Christian at least had courage.

323
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:23,271
More, perhaps, than you ultimately
found to be acceptable, Mr Bligh?

324
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,111
{y:i}Friday, October 10th.

325
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:33,865
{y:i}At half-past twelve today,
{y:i}James Valentine departed this life

326
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:38,870
{y:i}as a result of illness and fatigue
{y:i}sustained at Cape Horn.

327
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:41,664
{y:i}This after all my care of the men

328
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,835
{y:i}is surely a result of our
{y:i}drunken surgeon's neglect.

329
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,714
Oh, God. By whose mercy
the souls of all men rest.

330
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,842
Bless these waters
and absolve from sin,

331
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,595
he whose body
we now confine to them.

332
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,559
Eternal rest grant unto him.
And may he rest in peace. Amen.

333
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:04,145
Amen.

334
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,858
Commit the body to the deep.

335
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:15,865
{y:i}At four o'clock
{y:i}we buried Valentine

336
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,577
{y:i}with all the decency in our power.

337
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:29,087
Twenty-five degrees.
Thirty-six minutes.

338
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:10,045
Land Ho! Land Ho!

339
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,172
Where away?

340
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,799
Dead ahead, sir.

341
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,932
Stand by to fire the salute!

342
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:51,396
Ready to fire the salute.
Fire!

343
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:16,004
Stand by for a second salute!

344
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:27,265
Fire second salute!

345
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,304
I'll have her.

346
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,651
Thank you.

347
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:10,702
Quintel!

348
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:12,037
Sorry, sir.

349
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:14,789
Have you ever seen
a woman before?

350
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:17,417
Keep your mind and your eyes
on your work, man.

351
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:20,462
Come on, get in line there.

352
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:40,398
Oars!

353
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,525
Prepare to toss oars.

354
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,153
Toss oars.

355
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:50,158
Toss your oars.

356
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:12,097
Thank you.

357
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:10,613
Hail, Capitan Bligh.

358
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,159
Hail, King Tynah.

359
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:17,245
Thank you, your Majesty.

360
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:30,425
I bring you greetings from His Majesty,
King George of England.

361
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,927
How is the great Captain Cook?

362
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:37,682
Captain Cook! He's well,
and he also sends his greetings.

363
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:40,518
- He lives?
- Yes.

364
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:45,106
- He is my friend.
- I know.

365
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:49,861
Now you see.

366
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:52,572
He gave me his picture.

367
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:53,615
Yes.

368
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,952
Some people say he was killed
by the people of Hawaii.

369
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:02,374
No... Captain Cook
is very much alive.

370
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:08,213
And he's in good health, King Tynah.
He's very much alive.

371
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:10,965
As I said, he sends
his greetings to you.

372
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:14,302
And he always talks of you
as his very close friend.

373
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:19,057
You told that
to this man... Tynah?

374
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:20,600
King Tynah, sir.

375
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:23,603
A savage King.

376
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:26,523
A King, my lord.
Descended from many Kings.

377
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:29,734
As our King George
is descended from many Kings.

378
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:31,319
Yes, in a way, sir.

379
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:34,280
Then why did you lie to him?
Why did you not tell him

380
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:37,409
Captain Cook was murdered
in Hawaii 10 years before?

381
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:41,413
Because they believe
that Captain Cook is immortal.

382
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:43,289
Literally?

383
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:47,752
Yes, I think so, sir. They seem to
regard his likeness as a sacred image.

384
00:43:47,877 --> 00:43:49,587
Interesting.

385
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:54,217
They also believe that every British
officer is more or less related to him.

386
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:59,431
So you were
more or less immortal too.

387
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:05,603
It would appear so, sir. And...
I also needed their assistance.

388
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:09,274
Captain Cook was our guarantor.

389
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,944
How long you stay in Tahiti?

390
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:15,155
About two months.
Round about the islands.

391
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,285
Stay here. Do not go to the other
islands. No welcome there for you.

392
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,580
Everything you need is here.

393
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:25,665
I'm much obliged to you.

394
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,501
His Majesty King George
has sent you many gifts,

395
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:31,796
King Tynah. Perhaps
I could carry back in return.

396
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:35,508
Gifts from yourself
to His Majesty King George.

397
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:43,183
Anything for a King. Pigs.
Bananas. Coconuts. Breadfruit.

398
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:48,688
Breadfruit. Breadfruit's
a very good idea. Yes, breadfruit.

399
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:52,359
I think His Majesty likes breadfruit.
Isn't that true, Mr Nelson?

400
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:58,031
Indeed it is, sir.
His Majesty is a very keen gardener.

401
00:44:58,156 --> 00:45:01,326
He would appreciate
breadfruit greatly.

402
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,995
If you were to send him
little breadfruit plants.

403
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,499
He could grow them
in his own garden.

404
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:19,678
We shall grow him
many little plants.

405
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:20,970
Thank you.

406
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:23,682
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.

407
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:29,562
Mr Cole. Would you distribute the gifts
to King Tynah and his good people.

408
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:34,859
These are gifts from His Majesty King
George of England to yourselves.

409
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:39,739
Sir.

410
00:46:04,931 --> 00:46:06,850
Take it away, Mr Cole.

411
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:09,352
Oh, dear God.

412
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:13,606
- I hoped to avoid this.
- Avoid what, sir?

413
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:16,401
Dammit all, man,
I'm expected to sleep with her.

414
00:46:16,526 --> 00:46:21,448
She's one of King Tynah's wives.
A gift from one chief to another as it were.

415
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:24,325
Now look,
five minutes after I go below,

416
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,870
you must call me up on some
important business. Alright?

417
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:27,912
Yes, sir. What business?

418
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:30,165
Business, dammit.
Any bloody business.

419
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,792
Welcome aboard, Ma'am.

420
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:39,132
Yes.
Get on with your work.

421
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:47,432
She should soften
the old man up a bit.

422
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:05,992
Hot.

423
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,737
Enter.

424
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:45,240
Excuse me, sir. I...

425
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,783
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.

426
00:47:46,908 --> 00:47:48,576
What demands
my immediate attention?

427
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:50,328
It could wait until tomorrow.

428
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:51,413
What is it? Damn you.

429
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:53,081
The ship is sinking, sir.

430
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:55,291
Good.

431
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:04,759
Ma'am.

432
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:14,686
Was Fletcher Christian at this time
still your friend and ally?

433
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:16,104
At that time, yes.

434
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:19,816
There was no indication
of any resentment towards you?

435
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:22,902
No. None.

436
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:27,574
Mr Bligh. When you
planted out your breadfruit,

437
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:31,244
did not the savages carry out
some sort of ceremony?

438
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:32,954
An indecent ceremony?

439
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:35,665
Is this relevant,
Captain Greetham?

440
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:39,419
My Lord, if the crew were
allowed to witness it, yes.

441
00:48:39,544 --> 00:48:42,964
Were the crew present,
Mr Bligh?

442
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:44,257
Yes.

443
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:47,594
And was it indecent?

444
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:49,929
It is their deep belief

445
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:54,225
that the earth is rendered fruitful
by the coupling of their Gods.

446
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:59,439
And that the Gods can be roused
by the coupling of men and women.

447
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:28,356
So it did begin at the ceremony?

448
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:30,525
No, sir.
Not at the ceremony.

449
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:34,529
No, it was Fletcher Christian
and the native girl.

450
00:52:34,654 --> 00:52:37,741
You misunderstood the depth
of the emotion between them?

451
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,951
Yes. I realise that now.

452
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:43,663
I had assumed that it was
simply youthful passion.

453
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:48,418
It takes more than an infatuated
youth to make a mutiny.

454
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:50,670
It takes a discontented crew.

455
00:52:50,795 --> 00:52:53,423
The crew were anything
but discontented, sir.

456
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:55,342
Fletcher Christian corrupted them.

457
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:59,804
Yes, but what made them
so easy to corrupt?

458
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:04,434
I don't know.
It was the place itself.

459
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:38,927
Come here.

460
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:11,199
Mr Christian.

461
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:13,993
Come in, whoever you are.

462
00:58:24,587 --> 00:58:26,089
Captain Bligh's surprised

463
00:58:26,214 --> 00:58:29,926
that he hasn't had the pleasure of your
company at supper for some weeks.

464
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:31,553
Do you still do that?

465
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:34,514
And the Captain says
he'll expect you this evening.

466
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:37,392
Today...
Today's not Friday.

467
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:41,896
Six o'clock.
Prompt, if you please.

468
00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:08,965
Wait, Dr Huggen.

469
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:15,055
I found the most extraordinary plant today.
On the west side of the island.

470
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,391
Just by the mouth of the river.

471
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:28,777
Mr Christian,
it is half past seven.

472
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:30,987
Well, you didn't
wait for me, I hope.

473
00:59:31,112 --> 00:59:35,408
May I ask why you have come
to my table in a state of undress?

474
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:39,329
Well, I couldn't wear the jacket.
The tattoo's too painful.

475
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:43,166
- Good God.
- Put on your jacket, Mr Christian.

476
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:44,751
It's very painful, sir.

477
00:59:44,876 --> 00:59:49,464
Put on your jacket, Mr Christian.
If you please.

478
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:09,401
- May I serve now?
- Wait!

479
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:15,907
Thank you, Mr Christian.

480
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,576
Very well, Smith,
you may serve now.

481
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:21,162
Thank you, sir.

482
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:35,010
- Mr Nelson.
- Sir.

483
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:39,014
When did you last inspect
the breadfruit plants?

484
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,223
Yesterday, sir.

485
01:00:40,348 --> 01:00:41,433
Not today?

486
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:45,270
No, sir. Mr Christian said a daily
inspection was not necessary.

487
01:00:45,395 --> 01:00:49,107
Oh, did he indeed?
Well, Mr Christian.

488
01:00:49,232 --> 01:00:53,570
And when do you think they will be
ready to transport in your opinion?

489
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:55,238
They'll be some time yet, sir.

490
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:58,116
We've already been here thirteen
weeks longer than we intended.

491
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:01,578
- Will we never leave this place?
- Because we arrived so late. The plants...

492
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:05,582
I want to be advised of their
progress every day, Mr Christian.

493
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:09,753
Unless you need the time to cover
the rest of your body in pretty pictures.

494
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:11,921
Wait!

495
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:20,263
The sooner we are
seamen again the better.

496
01:01:20,388 --> 01:01:23,808
Don't you agree, gentlemen?

497
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:31,649
Now perhaps you will join me in prayer.
Oh Lord, our heavenly father.

498
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,027
Almighty and everlasting God.

499
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:39,657
Most humbly do we thank thee
for what we're about to receive.

500
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:15,694
It won't be long now, lads.
You'll all be on your way home.

501
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,654
You're not coming?

502
01:02:17,779 --> 01:02:21,658
I fancy having a look at a few
of the other islands around here.

503
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:25,787
- They'll hang you for desertion.
- Only if we're caught.

504
01:02:27,288 --> 01:02:29,666
You with us, John?

505
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:36,131
No. I've got a wife
and three kids back home.

506
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:43,138
There he goes.
Mr Bligh and bloody mighty.

507
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:46,433
How do you fancy the Endeavour
Straits? The Indian Ocean?

508
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:48,268
The South Atlantic?
The North Atlantic?

509
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:50,854
Nothing but
rotten biscuits and pork.

510
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:55,358
And his bloody lordship on your back
morning, noon and night.

511
01:02:55,483 --> 01:02:58,820
Not me, lads. Not me.

512
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:02,365
When do we go then?

513
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:06,536
Who's officer
of the watch tonight?

514
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:08,788
I am.

515
01:03:09,497 --> 01:03:11,499
Yeah?

516
01:03:11,624 --> 01:03:13,668
Yes.

517
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:17,339
Well, that's it, then.

518
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:46,201
Hey, Fletcher Christian.
Harami.

519
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:52,248
Maieva.

520
01:03:57,712 --> 01:03:59,047
Harahai.

521
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:01,466
Thank you.

522
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:08,640
You wanted to see me, sir?

523
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:12,936
My daughter...
She has something of yours.

524
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:15,271
Of mine?

525
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:25,073
You are here now.
Tamari.

526
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:28,576
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I...

527
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:39,713
Take this tusk.

528
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:46,803
And when you see it, you'll remember
my daughter and my grandchild.

529
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,266
You will never forget Tahiti Nui.

530
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:57,397
Fletcher Christian. Your wife.

531
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:05,363
- Think we should go as well?
- No, I do not.

532
01:05:05,488 --> 01:05:08,199
Mr Heywood's going to have
to answer for this, you know.

533
01:05:08,324 --> 01:05:10,785
Poor Heywood.

534
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:18,001
Hey, you bloody fools.

535
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:21,004
The Hottentots out there aren't as
friendly as these ones, you know.

536
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:24,132
Yeah. Come on, lads.

537
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:28,678
Good luck to them,
that's what I say.

538
01:05:28,803 --> 01:05:31,348
They'll need it.

539
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:40,357
All hands.

540
01:05:41,066 --> 01:05:44,069
Thank you, Mr Fryer.

541
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:50,241
Last night. Three men of
Mr Heywood's watch deserted ship.

542
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:53,578
The penalty for which
is death by hanging.

543
01:05:53,703 --> 01:06:01,920
Mr Heywood, how is it you did not
see them? Were you asleep?

544
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:04,297
Yes, sir.

545
01:06:04,422 --> 01:06:08,885
Very well. You shall kiss
the gunner's daughter.

546
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:11,721
- Bosun.
- Sir.

547
01:06:11,846 --> 01:06:14,265
Put this man over the cannon.

548
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:15,809
Do it now!

549
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,728
Aye, aye, sir.

550
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:21,940
Now listen to me, all of you.

551
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,025
In one week's time...

552
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:33,743
Stop that laughing! Silence!
You think this is funny?

553
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:36,955
You're a pitiful sight, Dr Huggen.

554
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:40,417
Go below to your quarters...

555
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:49,217
You think this is a
humorous occasion.

556
01:06:49,342 --> 01:06:55,140
You are mistaken. From now on there's
going to be discipline on this ship.

557
01:06:55,265 --> 01:07:00,145
We're going to have order.
And we're going to be like seamen.

558
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:08,111
In one week's time we will put to sea.
There will be no more grog.

559
01:07:08,236 --> 01:07:14,325
There will be no more shore leave.
You've become a rabble, all of you.

560
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:19,414
And you will clean up
this ship and yourselves.

561
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:22,959
- Bosun.
- Sir!

562
01:07:23,084 --> 01:07:25,962
Administer the punishment now.

563
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:45,648
Capitan Bligh.

564
01:07:51,488 --> 01:07:54,532
Mr Christian!
Mr Christian, sir.

565
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:58,495
Sir! - I wish to talk
to you outside. Now!

566
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:02,165
- Coming, sir.
- Thank you.

567
01:08:22,852 --> 01:08:24,229
Is there anything wrong, sir?

568
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:28,066
Yes. Last night while the mate
of the watch was asleep, three...

569
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:30,276
Stop that noise!

570
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:44,374
Three men jumped ship last night.
Churchill was one of them.

571
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:46,918
You don't seem surprised?

572
01:08:47,043 --> 01:08:50,255
Now that it's happened, no.
No, I'm not surprised.

573
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,340
I must say I'm no longer
surprised myself

574
01:08:52,465 --> 01:08:54,884
when I see the example
being set by my first officer.

575
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:56,886
Just look at yourself, man.
Look at the way you're dressed.

576
01:08:57,012 --> 01:09:00,265
Come on. You're no better
than one of these natives.

577
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,267
At least I am no worse.

578
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:04,227
I think your brain
has been overheated, sir.

579
01:09:04,352 --> 01:09:06,271
And your body overindulged
in sexual excess.

580
01:09:06,396 --> 01:09:08,773
I have done no more than
any natural man would do.

581
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:11,776
No. You have done no more
than any wild animal would do.

582
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:12,902
It always makes me laugh,

583
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:15,739
but when men lose their self-restraint
they say they're natural.

584
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:19,284
They are more natural than men
who have nothing to restrain.

585
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:22,787
Mr Christian, you will report
to the ship before sundown.

586
01:09:22,912 --> 01:09:25,498
- Is that understood?
- No. No.

587
01:09:25,623 --> 01:09:32,422
What did you say? You said no. Is that
what you said? Is that what you said? No.

588
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:36,259
Alright. You will report to the ship
immediately. Do you understand me?

589
01:09:36,384 --> 01:09:37,635
And you will stay on ship.

590
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:40,638
There will be no more mixing with the
damned degenerate natives of these islands.

591
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:42,515
By any of my officers.
Or by any of my crew.

592
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,102
You comprehend
my meaning, sir? Good.

593
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:07,874
Keep em' coming.
Move it along. Don't drop them.

594
01:10:07,999 --> 01:10:13,380
Come on, Purcell. Remember
that's what we're here for.

595
01:10:13,505 --> 01:10:14,798
And the next one, please.

596
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:19,386
Come on. Keep them coming.
Good lads.

597
01:10:34,275 --> 01:10:35,777
Alright.
Where are they?

598
01:10:35,902 --> 01:10:40,031
I don't know yet, sir.
We'll find them.

599
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:50,125
Damn fools.
Don't make it worse for yourself.

600
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:53,378
Stand up.

601
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:56,423
Stand up!

602
01:10:56,548 --> 01:11:02,012
He can't, sir. Bit of trouble
with the locals out there.

603
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:05,765
You know the penalty
for desertion, mister?

604
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:08,393
We came back
of our own accord, sir.

605
01:11:08,518 --> 01:11:10,770
You're a mindless animal,
Churchill.

606
01:11:10,895 --> 01:11:14,065
I will decide your punishment
when you're fit to receive it.

607
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,445
Mr Cole! Get Dr Huggen.

608
01:11:18,903 --> 01:11:21,448
Aye, aye, sir.

609
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:48,558
Sir. Over here.

610
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:57,233
- Is he dead?
- Yes, sir.

611
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,237
Poor bugger.
Alright, bury him.

612
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:05,492
Will you organise that,
please, Mr Cole?

613
01:13:57,395 --> 01:13:59,814
Fletcher.

614
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:26,216
I've come to say good-bye.

615
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:35,308
You do not come back.
Do you?

616
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:38,728
Ever?

617
01:15:25,316 --> 01:15:28,653
- I must go now.
- No.

618
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:34,159
Not yet. Soon.

619
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:59,828
Eyes front, Mr Christian!

620
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:08,586
Off hats.

621
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:12,340
Take the men below.

622
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:21,016
- Make sail, Mr Fryer.
- Aye, aye, sir.

623
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:23,810
Stand aside.

624
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:28,773
Stand down.

625
01:17:34,446 --> 01:17:37,282
Stand down!

626
01:17:38,324 --> 01:17:42,078
Come on, lads.
No sense in this.

627
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:30,603
Well, gentlemen, between ourselves
and home are 27,000 sea miles,

628
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:35,316
the Endeavour Straits
and the Great Barrier Reef.

629
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:38,361
Now, the crew is deeply
demoralised, gentlemen.

630
01:19:38,486 --> 01:19:42,240
And I must accept,
as every captain must accept,

631
01:19:42,365 --> 01:19:47,162
the inevitable and theoretical
responsibilty for that.

632
01:19:48,663 --> 01:19:52,917
The actual and immediate
responsibilty, however,

633
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:55,545
I place on you,
my fellow officers,

634
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:59,883
who met this crisis with
lethargy, impudence

635
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:05,930
and flagrant defiance
publicly uttered.

636
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:13,688
And perhaps also for that,
I am to blame.

637
01:20:13,813 --> 01:20:18,485
I counted on a strength of character
which you do not possess.

638
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:26,284
However, the cure for our
predicament is discipline.

639
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:30,413
And I shall apply it
with an even hand, of course,

640
01:20:30,538 --> 01:20:34,834
but most
where it is most required.

641
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:38,922
Yes, well, that will be all.
Thank you.

642
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:43,426
You may leave now.
Not you, Mr Christian.

643
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:53,019
Leave it. Now!

644
01:20:57,607 --> 01:21:02,487
Alright, Smith, you may go
and close the door, please.

645
01:21:06,324 --> 01:21:08,660
So...

646
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:13,456
You think I'm harsh with you?

647
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:20,714
Look, I've been at sea many years,
Fletcher. Since I was twelve.

648
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:24,592
And I've seen many men,
many good men,

649
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:28,054
lose their heads over native
women in these waters.

650
01:21:28,179 --> 01:21:32,225
And I've never yet
seen it come out well.

651
01:21:32,517 --> 01:21:36,813
Of course I understand
the excitement and...

652
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:40,984
But think to yourself, man.

653
01:21:41,109 --> 01:21:44,863
Could you take a woman like that
back home to your friends and family?

654
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:47,574
No, of course you couldn't.

655
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:51,828
They're not like us, Fletcher.
You think I was harsh with you.

656
01:21:51,953 --> 01:21:57,375
But you needed someone to show
you where your duty really lay.

657
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,545
Because you were
at a loss, my friend.

658
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:04,758
You may not thank me now
but you will later.

659
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,845
So, let's get the ship
running properly

660
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:14,392
and get back to
where we were before.

661
01:22:17,896 --> 01:22:20,357
Now look, Fletcher.

662
01:22:22,692 --> 01:22:24,652
Listen to me.

663
01:22:24,778 --> 01:22:29,240
I am prepared to forgive
and I am prepared to forget.

664
01:22:29,366 --> 01:22:32,243
Do you understand me?

665
01:22:34,746 --> 01:22:37,457
Will that be all, sir?

666
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:42,712
- Yes, that will be all.
- Thank you.

667
01:22:57,811 --> 01:22:59,813
You sent for me, sir?

668
01:22:59,938 --> 01:23:06,528
Yes, I did.
This ship is filthy, Mr Christian.

669
01:23:07,737 --> 01:23:08,822
Sir?

670
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:13,410
The ship is filthy, Mr Christian!
Look for yourself.

671
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:16,037
Look! Filthy, sir!
Filth there!

672
01:23:16,162 --> 01:23:19,874
And there!
And look at there!

673
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,836
I understand you dismissed
the swabbing party.

674
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:27,716
You left these decks crusted
with grime. Look at it there!

675
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:31,219
Bloody disgrace.
Now you'll be well advised, sir,

676
01:23:31,344 --> 01:23:34,931
to call them back again
and this time do it properly.

677
01:23:35,056 --> 01:23:37,809
Do you understand me?

678
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:48,028
Filth, sir! Filthy, Mr Christian.
Still filthy! Look!

679
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:50,238
I see nothing, sir,
but your finger.

680
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:53,158
I'll not have your vile ways
brought aboard my ship, sir!

681
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:54,743
Do you understand?

682
01:23:54,868 --> 01:23:57,162
Now you'll call up the
swabbing party, yet again!

683
01:23:57,287 --> 01:24:00,040
And this time you'll make bloody sure
that the decks are clean!

684
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:02,042
Or by God,
you'll answer for it, sir!

685
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:05,712
I'll not have any of your foul,
filthy gutter ways on board my ship!

686
01:24:05,837 --> 01:24:10,091
Do you understand? Good God,
pigs in a sty have more comprehension

687
01:24:10,216 --> 01:24:13,720
or cleanliness
than you buggers have.

688
01:24:13,845 --> 01:24:15,764
Now you'll get
these decks clean

689
01:24:15,889 --> 01:24:19,017
or by God I'll make you
lick them clean with your tongues

690
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:22,479
if you don't mend your ways.

691
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:53,760
There is a thief among us.

692
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:57,263
Yes, there is a thief on board
this ship, which is unfortunate

693
01:24:57,389 --> 01:25:01,059
because you know what hardship
that means for honest men.

694
01:25:01,184 --> 01:25:05,730
Last night my personal store of coconuts
was well up to the top of the netting.

695
01:25:05,855 --> 01:25:09,651
This morning, I... Well, I mean,
look for yourselves. See?

696
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:13,238
Now, if the thief will declare
himself, I will punish him alone.

697
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:14,823
And then we can
forget the matter.

698
01:25:14,948 --> 01:25:15,699
Sir.

699
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:19,953
Hold your tongue, Goddamn you, sir!
I'm addressing the crew, Mr Christian.

700
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:23,123
Who do you think you are?

701
01:25:26,459 --> 01:25:28,628
Now if the thief will not
declare himself...

702
01:25:28,753 --> 01:25:31,172
I took one.

703
01:25:31,381 --> 01:25:33,508
You?

704
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,971
I was thirsty. I took one of your coconuts.
I thought it of no consequence.

705
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:41,808
One coconut, Mr Christian?
A dozen were taken, man.

706
01:25:41,933 --> 01:25:45,061
I know nothing of a dozen.

707
01:25:48,648 --> 01:25:50,734
Then, unless you're a liar
as well as a thief,

708
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:53,278
the rest were taken by
other members of your watch

709
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:56,239
who look to you for their
example, do they not, sir?

710
01:25:56,364 --> 01:25:59,117
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.

711
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:02,620
Impound the personal stores of
every man on Mr Christian's watch

712
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:04,414
and put them on half rations.

713
01:26:04,539 --> 01:26:08,877
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Thank you. Stand down.

714
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:18,530
That isn't a raft,
it's a coffin.

715
01:27:18,655 --> 01:27:23,034
There's a five-knot current running
between here and that island.

716
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:25,829
I'll take my chance.

717
01:27:26,871 --> 01:27:29,749
You think a lot of us
haven't thought of this?

718
01:27:29,874 --> 01:27:33,962
You're not the only one
to have left a woman behind.

719
01:27:34,087 --> 01:27:37,966
Fletcher, the men are
ready for anything.

720
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:45,807
What are you saying, Ned?
Are you inciting me to mutiny?

721
01:27:45,932 --> 01:27:50,145
If I were you,
I'd take the ship. That's all.

722
01:27:51,646 --> 01:27:53,023
Why don't you, then?

723
01:27:53,148 --> 01:27:57,485
I said if I were you. I'm not.

724
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:13,168
What I have to say to you is the
result of considerable reflection.

725
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:16,629
Its consequences
would be two-fold.

726
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:19,674
Firstly, our journey
will be shortened.

727
01:28:19,799 --> 01:28:23,386
Which I know is a consideration
that cannot distress you.

728
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:27,140
And secondly,
upon its successful conclusion

729
01:28:27,265 --> 01:28:33,480
not one of you in later years
will look back without a surge of pride.

730
01:28:35,815 --> 01:28:41,571
We shall go with the winds to Jamaica
by way of Cape Horn.

731
01:28:42,655 --> 01:28:45,200
You'll kill us all.

732
01:28:49,204 --> 01:28:51,081
What did you say, Adams?

733
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:56,544
We tried the Horn before.
It was almost the end of us.

734
01:28:58,004 --> 01:29:02,342
Damn you, man.
Don't you bloody cross me.

735
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:09,933
Mr Cole, take this man below.

736
01:29:10,058 --> 01:29:13,520
And tomorrow we will assemble
to watch him receive punishment

737
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:16,314
for cowardice
and insubordination.

738
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:18,817
Mr Cole, take him below, sir!

739
01:29:18,942 --> 01:29:21,277
You, Mr Fryer,
give him the makings.

740
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:23,571
Sir.

741
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:33,206
Now. We set out to circumnavigate
the globe. And by God we shall do it.

742
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:39,087
To the greater glory of us all.
Is that understood?

743
01:29:42,048 --> 01:29:46,386
Thank you.
Now you may dismiss.

744
01:30:02,736 --> 01:30:05,447
Enter.

745
01:30:07,365 --> 01:30:10,910
- Can I have a word with you?
- I'm busy. Is it important?

746
01:30:11,036 --> 01:30:13,496
I think, yes.

747
01:30:13,663 --> 01:30:16,166
Be brief!

748
01:30:18,918 --> 01:30:21,504
William, about your decision
to go around the Horn.

749
01:30:21,629 --> 01:30:26,634
William? Not sir?
Not captain? William.

750
01:30:27,218 --> 01:30:29,012
I don't think the men
will have it.

751
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:34,059
Oh, the men won't have it.
Are they in charge of the Bounty?

752
01:30:34,184 --> 01:30:35,602
They might be if you insist.

753
01:30:35,727 --> 01:30:39,147
Again. Will you repeat that, please?
The men might be in charge.

754
01:30:39,272 --> 01:30:41,649
What are you
threatening me with?

755
01:30:41,775 --> 01:30:43,651
It's not a threat,
it's a warning.

756
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,403
There are rumblings,
are there?

757
01:30:45,528 --> 01:30:49,115
No. There is fear.

758
01:30:49,532 --> 01:30:52,035
Around the Horn is the easiest way.
The better way.

759
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:55,997
And that is how we will go.
Anything more?

760
01:30:56,122 --> 01:30:57,624
Don't put Adams
under the lash.

761
01:30:57,749 --> 01:31:00,377
He was insubordinate.
Cowardly and insubordinate.

762
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:04,339
He frightened the men.
I did not put that fear there, he did.

763
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:09,260
So he will be lashed
and we will go around the Horn.

764
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:13,348
Are you frightened to go
around the Horn, Mr Christian?

765
01:31:13,473 --> 01:31:16,893
Are you a coward too, sir?

766
01:31:58,143 --> 01:32:00,979
There will be no killing.

767
01:32:01,104 --> 01:32:01,938
Except Bligh.

768
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:07,652
There will be no killing.
We set him adrift.

769
01:32:16,161 --> 01:32:18,830
Hi. Christian's taking the ship.
Are you with us?

770
01:32:18,955 --> 01:32:23,293
Come on, wake up.
We're taking the ship.

771
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:24,753
Wake up.

772
01:32:24,878 --> 01:32:25,754
Wake up!

773
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:30,300
Shut up. Christian's taking the ship.
Christian's taking the ship.

774
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:35,013
We're taking the ship.
Are you with us? Come on then.

775
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:48,234
Come on, Fryer. Wake up!
Get up! - Come on, Fryer!

776
01:32:51,446 --> 01:32:56,785
Mr Bligh. Will you get up?
Get up.

777
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:59,371
Get up!

778
01:33:02,082 --> 01:33:04,626
On your feet.

779
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:08,046
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

780
01:33:08,171 --> 01:33:10,423
- Tie him.
- What are you doing?

781
01:33:10,548 --> 01:33:14,552
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!

782
01:33:16,012 --> 01:33:18,223
Come on, get up on deck.

783
01:33:18,348 --> 01:33:21,351
Mr Cole!
You'll hang for this!

784
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:24,145
Mr Nelson.

785
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:29,192
We've taken the ship.
We've taken the ship!

786
01:33:29,317 --> 01:33:33,655
We've taken the ship!
We've got Bligh! Get on deck!

787
01:33:36,574 --> 01:33:39,411
Dance! Dance!

788
01:33:39,536 --> 01:33:41,454
Easy!

789
01:33:41,579 --> 01:33:42,872
Dance!

790
01:33:42,997 --> 01:33:46,835
You shut up!
You dance! Dance!

791
01:33:51,172 --> 01:33:54,134
Come on. Get going.

792
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:58,054
You're a fool, Quintel.
You'll hang for this.

793
01:34:03,101 --> 01:34:05,687
- Are you in this, Norton?
- No, sir, I'm not.

794
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:07,522
Shut up your trap!

795
01:34:07,647 --> 01:34:09,482
Desist this madness!

796
01:34:09,607 --> 01:34:11,026
Be quiet!

797
01:34:11,151 --> 01:34:13,570
Have you any conception
of what you're doing?

798
01:34:13,695 --> 01:34:15,405
Just shut your mouth!

799
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:16,948
Are you in this, Adams?

800
01:34:17,073 --> 01:34:20,118
It's all you fault. - Yes, you're in this!
- There was never a coward on this ship!

801
01:34:20,243 --> 01:34:22,412
- You're a coward, sir!
- And that was your mistake!

802
01:34:22,537 --> 01:34:23,997
You're a blackhearted villian, sir!

803
01:34:24,122 --> 01:34:26,916
Pritchard, get over here!

804
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:28,043
Stay there, Pritchard.

805
01:34:28,168 --> 01:34:31,254
Stay, Pritchard, you're a man.

806
01:34:31,671 --> 01:34:34,924
Get over then.

807
01:34:35,425 --> 01:34:38,345
Allison, get over here!

808
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:40,638
Shut up! I'm staying here!

809
01:34:40,764 --> 01:34:43,683
Let's kill the bugger now, lads.

810
01:34:44,434 --> 01:34:47,437
I said leave him!
You sodding bastards!

811
01:34:47,562 --> 01:34:49,481
You take you hands off him!

812
01:34:49,606 --> 01:34:51,566
- Let's kill him!
- Take your hands off him, now!

813
01:34:51,691 --> 01:34:56,905
- Kill him!
- Get your hands off him. Now!

814
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:03,203
Mr Christian, I appeal to you, sir.

815
01:35:03,328 --> 01:35:06,498
Put aside this madness and it will be
forgotten. I give you my word. - It's too late.

816
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:09,292
Think of my family and my
friendship. Think of my wife.

817
01:35:09,417 --> 01:35:17,676
I am in hell! Hell, sir! Why are you
being so damn reasonable now?

818
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:22,972
God damn your blood
to hell with mine, sir!

819
01:35:23,098 --> 01:35:24,432
God damn your blood!

820
01:35:24,557 --> 01:35:27,894
- Mr Christian, get a hold of yourself!
- You be quiet or I will run you through!

821
01:35:28,019 --> 01:35:29,354
Do it, Christian. Kill him!

822
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:34,693
Just shut your mouth! You shut
your mouth! I will run you through!

823
01:35:34,818 --> 01:35:38,905
And then I will kill myself after.
You get him dressed now.

824
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:41,991
Get him dressed!

825
01:35:42,117 --> 01:35:43,702
- What's the matter with you all?
- Bastard!

826
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:46,413
- What's the matter with you all?
- You be quiet!

827
01:35:46,538 --> 01:35:48,164
Gun him down, damn you!
They're common criminals.

828
01:35:48,289 --> 01:35:51,501
- Oh, will be silent, sir!
- Get out of it, Cole!

829
01:35:55,255 --> 01:35:59,134
You will be silent or I will
have you killed, you bastard!

830
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:04,014
You do and you will have
my blood on your hands.

831
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:06,850
Stop!

832
01:36:07,058 --> 01:36:14,983
Quiet! We will get him in the boat.
Set him adrift. Get him dressed!

833
01:36:16,818 --> 01:36:19,529
Will someone give me my britches?

834
01:36:19,654 --> 01:36:21,865
Pass us your watch up here then.

835
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:25,160
Come on, move yourselves.

836
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:35,712
You blackguard! Traitors!

837
01:36:38,673 --> 01:36:42,093
Mr Bligh, come here, please.

838
01:36:43,094 --> 01:36:46,181
If you wish to leave some
of these men on the ship,

839
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:48,725
I give you my word
they will not be harmed.

840
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:52,437
Lads. One of you will have to
come out. There's no room.

841
01:36:52,562 --> 01:36:56,024
- Mr Fryer, you come up here.
- We'll do without him. We don't want you.

842
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:57,275
Mr Fryer. Get up here.

843
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,112
Stay where you are.
Or I'll blow your head off.

844
01:37:01,237 --> 01:37:04,908
God damn you!
You're the scum of the earth!

845
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:07,285
Fulman. Get up here.

846
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:09,746
Come on, Fulman.
Move yourself.

847
01:37:09,871 --> 01:37:12,207
Faster, man!

848
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:19,673
It will be fairly reported that you were
not part of this rabble. Thank you.

849
01:37:21,549 --> 01:37:24,135
Smith, bring that chest to me.

850
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,763
Do it now.

851
01:37:28,014 --> 01:37:30,350
Get in the boat.

852
01:37:45,448 --> 01:37:48,576
What use is that without charts?

853
01:37:48,702 --> 01:37:53,039
I need the charts.
Turn around.

854
01:37:54,332 --> 01:37:56,835
You really think you'll be able
to command this rabble?

855
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,461
I'll do my best.

856
01:37:58,586 --> 01:38:03,675
Well, I did my best,
and I had the authority of the law.

857
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,970
- You're a dead man, Fletcher.
- That's enough of that.

858
01:38:07,095 --> 01:38:10,223
- You're a dead man, sir.
- Get on the boat, sir.

859
01:38:13,184 --> 01:38:16,479
Quickly. - You've not seen the last of me,
Ned Young. Take my word for it.

860
01:38:16,604 --> 01:38:19,816
Thank you, Mr Lamb.
Or you, John Adams.

861
01:38:19,941 --> 01:38:25,071
- You've not seen the last of me.
- I wouldn't wager on it. - We shall see, sir.

862
01:38:28,616 --> 01:38:31,286
I'll see you hanged.

863
01:38:31,411 --> 01:38:33,038
Veer them away.

864
01:38:33,163 --> 01:38:35,540
- Did you bring anything, Smith?
- Yeah, I got a carpent... - Shut up!

865
01:38:35,665 --> 01:38:39,586
Veer them away...

866
01:38:40,045 --> 01:38:43,131
Get ready, boys.
Get the oars out.

867
01:38:43,256 --> 01:38:45,342
Sorry to see you go.

868
01:38:45,467 --> 01:38:49,596
Isn't this what you came for?
Here you go.

869
01:39:02,442 --> 01:39:05,403
From us to King George.

870
01:39:05,528 --> 01:39:10,533
Goodbye, boys! Hope you never come
back. Hope I never see you again.

871
01:39:10,658 --> 01:39:13,328
If you get home,
tell my mother that I love her.

872
01:39:13,453 --> 01:39:17,332
That she's got a lovely
little Tahitian grandson.

873
01:39:22,087 --> 01:39:26,841
Have a long ride, Tim.
I hope they bloody eat yer, Fryer.

874
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,626
{y:i}I hope never to see
{y:i}Fletcher Christian again.

875
01:40:01,751 --> 01:40:04,587
{y:i}Unless it is to see him hanged.

876
01:40:04,713 --> 01:40:08,717
{y:i}How could he betray my
{y:i}friendship and kindness to him?

877
01:40:08,842 --> 01:40:14,180
{y:i}I can only assume he has
{y:i}decided to return to a life in Tahiti.

878
01:40:15,598 --> 01:40:18,852
{y:i}After taking stock of the
{y:i}meagre provisions allowed us,

879
01:40:18,977 --> 01:40:22,105
{y:i}I have decided to make
{y:i}for the island of Tafuha

880
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:26,735
{y:i}in the hope of supplementing
{y:i}our supplies of food and water.

881
01:40:27,235 --> 01:40:30,113
{y:i}By now, there are
{y:i}many natives about us.

882
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:35,910
{y:i}And by their manner, we do not expect
{y:i}our welcome to last much longer.

883
01:40:42,709 --> 01:40:44,669
- Mr Cole?
- Sir.

884
01:40:44,794 --> 01:40:47,922
You take charge of my log...

885
01:40:48,048 --> 01:40:54,763
and slowly...
make your way out to the launch.

886
01:40:56,931 --> 01:41:00,727
- Easy, Mr Cole.
- Aye, aye, sir.

887
01:41:04,773 --> 01:41:06,274
Go now?

888
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:09,778
Now. That's right.

889
01:41:21,456 --> 01:41:25,710
You give me no summer, my boys.
Nasty bugger.

890
01:41:25,835 --> 01:41:26,795
Come on, lads!

891
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:33,426
Get in the boat! Lose that barrel.
Stop playing games!

892
01:41:39,974 --> 01:41:42,686
Is that what you want?

893
01:41:53,196 --> 01:41:57,200
Everybody in the boat!
Prepare to pull away!

894
01:41:57,784 --> 01:42:02,747
Mr Bligh! - Get in the boat!
Where's the captain? Where's Mr Bligh?

895
01:42:02,872 --> 01:42:05,208
Over there.

896
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:08,336
Come on then.

897
01:42:08,461 --> 01:42:11,214
- Norton, come back, you fool!
- Mr Bligh!

898
01:42:11,339 --> 01:42:13,216
What are you doing?

899
01:42:13,341 --> 01:42:15,969
Get aboard, sir!

900
01:42:19,723 --> 01:42:21,850
Come, Bligh!

901
01:42:25,353 --> 01:42:27,814
Mr Bligh!

902
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:34,529
Get back, you... you bastard!
Keep back, you bastard!

903
01:42:40,702 --> 01:42:44,873
- I'll have your eyes for footballs!
- Get back in the boat!

904
01:42:53,048 --> 01:42:57,469
- Help the man!
- Get in the boat, sir.

905
01:43:03,141 --> 01:43:06,353
My God! No!

906
01:43:10,607 --> 01:43:14,778
Row for your lives!
Take your clothes off.

907
01:43:17,364 --> 01:43:20,742
- Throw those clothes over!
- Bloody savages!

908
01:43:22,494 --> 01:43:28,083
Row for your lives! We're chops
and liver to them if they catch us.

909
01:43:32,379 --> 01:43:36,299
That's the spirit!
Come on, we'll do it!

910
01:43:55,902 --> 01:44:01,991
We cannot risk going ashore again.
What are we going to do, sir?

911
01:44:06,663 --> 01:44:09,332
Well, we shall just have to try
and reach Coupang.

912
01:44:09,457 --> 01:44:12,043
Without charts?

913
01:44:12,168 --> 01:44:15,755
Well, I shall have to navigate
from memory, Mr Fryer.

914
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:20,343
It'll take us close to the most
savage islands in these waters.

915
01:44:20,468 --> 01:44:25,098
The Fiji islands where cannibalism
is perfected almost to a science.

916
01:44:25,223 --> 01:44:27,058
And from there, my friends,
God willing,

917
01:44:27,183 --> 01:44:30,061
we shall proceed onward
to the Great Barrier Reef itself.

918
01:44:30,186 --> 01:44:33,898
Then to the coast of New Holland and
from there across the Timor Sea to Coupang.

919
01:44:34,024 --> 01:44:36,192
Now it will take us
at least two months

920
01:44:36,317 --> 01:44:40,363
and we have provisions or more
enough to last us one week.

921
01:44:40,488 --> 01:44:44,701
So that is the situation, gentlemen.
Plain and simple.

922
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:52,250
Well, we'll just have to make
the best of it. Won't we, sir?

923
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:54,377
Make the best of it, Smith?
Yes, but will you?

924
01:44:54,502 --> 01:44:57,088
That's what I ask myself.
Will you make the best of it?

925
01:44:57,213 --> 01:45:01,718
Do you hear me? Are you prepared
to make the best of it? All of you?

926
01:45:01,843 --> 01:45:05,638
Because all I can promise you, lads,
is relentless pain and hardship.

927
01:45:05,764 --> 01:45:09,726
Now, if you're prepared
to make do and make sacrifices

928
01:45:09,851 --> 01:45:13,104
and furthermore
are willing to swear by it,

929
01:45:13,229 --> 01:45:17,817
I promise you, our chances
of survival are fair.

930
01:45:18,902 --> 01:45:22,197
You hear me?
You all say, aye.

931
01:45:22,322 --> 01:45:23,531
Aye.

932
01:45:23,656 --> 01:45:25,950
Good!

933
01:45:27,285 --> 01:45:29,746
Mr Fryer, make way.

934
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:35,085
Prepare to make way.
Make way.

935
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:08,076
Fletcher!

936
01:46:13,289 --> 01:46:15,875
Fletcher!

937
01:46:42,152 --> 01:46:47,323
In the box are gifts
for the people of Tahiti Nui.

938
01:46:49,451 --> 01:46:55,206
We did not expect you back.
We have already given you everything.

939
01:46:55,540 --> 01:47:01,212
We only want our women. And perhaps
some men to help me sail the ship.

940
01:47:01,338 --> 01:47:05,467
Where's Captain Bligh?
Why doesn't he come himself?

941
01:47:05,592 --> 01:47:09,429
He's no longer with us.
I've taken the ship.

942
01:47:09,554 --> 01:47:10,722
He's dead?

943
01:47:10,847 --> 01:47:16,811
No, no, he's not dead.
We set him adrift with some of the crew.

944
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:32,160
You shame me by coming here.
You shame me.

945
01:47:32,285 --> 01:47:38,708
King George will send many ships with many
guns to punish us for what you have done.

946
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:43,129
We can give you nothing.
Go now.

947
01:47:45,965 --> 01:47:50,220
Some of the men would like to
remain here and wait for the next ship.

948
01:47:50,345 --> 01:47:54,891
They wanted to go with Bligh
but there was no room in his boat.

949
01:48:02,899 --> 01:48:08,738
They can stay, but not you.
Take your gifts and go.

950
01:48:11,366 --> 01:48:13,576
No!

951
01:48:18,206 --> 01:48:22,293
Should she not be allowed
to choose for herself, sir?

952
01:49:29,694 --> 01:49:32,530
Where will you take her?

953
01:49:33,907 --> 01:49:39,621
I don't know. Somewhere
the British ships won't find us.

954
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:46,878
Take her. You will have
all the men you need. Go now.

955
01:50:36,302 --> 01:50:39,014
- Goodbye, Peter.
- Good luck, sir.

956
01:50:39,139 --> 01:50:40,932
I think you'll need it
more than I.

957
01:50:41,057 --> 01:50:43,018
Thank you.

958
01:50:48,189 --> 01:50:56,406
I'm not coming, Fletcher. I've thought
it out, and... Well, I'm staying here.

959
01:50:58,867 --> 01:51:03,038
- Let's go.
- I think I'll stay too, sir.

960
01:51:03,538 --> 01:51:06,291
Get out. Let's go!

961
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:09,085
Come on, lads.

962
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:13,089
They'll hang you.

963
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:16,593
I might just have a lucky face.

964
01:52:54,858 --> 01:52:59,362
Here they come.
Get it. Good one!

965
01:53:00,864 --> 01:53:04,993
Loads of them.
They're all over the place.

966
01:53:08,121 --> 01:53:11,583
Look, there's hundreds of them!

967
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:23,386
Here we go. There we go. - Go on.
- Sod it. Who loaded these things?

968
01:53:26,389 --> 01:53:30,685
Come on, man.
Quick, quick, quick! - Yeah!

969
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:41,780
{y:i}The only one I wholly trust
{y:i}is Adams.

970
01:53:41,905 --> 01:53:44,949
{y:i}I go everywhere
{y:i}with a loaded pistol.

971
01:53:45,075 --> 01:53:50,830
{y:i}And where we are to head beyond
{y:i}the reach of justice, I know not.

972
01:54:07,681 --> 01:54:10,600
{y:i}Thursday, June 11th.

973
01:54:10,725 --> 01:54:14,688
{y:i}In the afternoon we saw gannets
{y:i}and many other birds.

974
01:54:14,813 --> 01:54:18,274
{y:i}And at sunset
{y:i}we caught one in our sail.

975
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:21,444
{y:i}Which I reserved
{y:i}for our dinner next day.

976
01:54:21,569 --> 01:54:24,364
Who shall have this?

977
01:54:24,489 --> 01:54:26,950
Smith.

978
01:54:31,454 --> 01:54:33,832
And who shall have this?

979
01:54:33,957 --> 01:54:36,167
Mr Fryer.

980
01:54:43,466 --> 01:54:45,677
What about the rest of us?

981
01:54:45,802 --> 01:54:49,180
You just have to wait your turn,
Purcell, like everyone else.

982
01:54:49,305 --> 01:54:51,057
Some of us haven't had
nothing in days.

983
01:54:51,182 --> 01:54:52,934
That's enough, Purcell.

984
01:54:53,059 --> 01:54:57,230
Well, it's not enough for me, sir!
I'll tell you something.

985
01:54:57,355 --> 01:54:59,691
The officers and their lot
get everything.

986
01:54:59,816 --> 01:55:01,568
Shut your mouth, Purcell.

987
01:55:01,693 --> 01:55:04,154
I'm as much a man
as you are, sir.

988
01:55:04,279 --> 01:55:07,449
What did you say? - I said
I'm as much a man as you are!

989
01:55:07,574 --> 01:55:11,119
Are you indeed?
I'm not so certain about that.

990
01:55:11,244 --> 01:55:14,664
Sit down, damn you!
I'll knock you on the head with it.

991
01:55:14,789 --> 01:55:18,168
Sit down! Sit down!

992
01:55:21,713 --> 01:55:26,384
Mr Cole, give this man
my share of food.

993
01:55:52,911 --> 01:55:56,247
{y:i}I am committed
{y:i}to a desperate enterprise.

994
01:55:56,373 --> 01:55:57,957
{y:i}I have said farewell

995
01:55:58,083 --> 01:56:01,252
{y:i}to everything I've been accustomed
{y:i}to regard as indispensable.

996
01:56:01,378 --> 01:56:05,048
{y:i}But I suppose
{y:i}I have found freedom.

997
01:56:11,262 --> 01:56:13,431
So you've found freedom,
have you?

998
01:56:13,556 --> 01:56:17,560
Freedom, retribution,
that's what you want.

999
01:56:17,686 --> 01:56:20,897
- Isn't that why you gave him your compass?
- I wanted to give him a chance.

1000
01:56:21,022 --> 01:56:22,816
A chance to survive,
so he'll come after us again.

1001
01:56:22,941 --> 01:56:26,277
How can he come after us?
He'll be marooned on some island.

1002
01:56:26,403 --> 01:56:31,741
I only wish to God I'd given
him muskets. Now get out.

1003
01:56:42,711 --> 01:56:45,839
{y:i}At least ten times
{y:i}we have touched land.

1004
01:56:45,964 --> 01:56:49,009
{y:i}Only to find either barren rocks
{y:i}or hostile inhabitants.

1005
01:56:49,134 --> 01:56:52,220
{y:i}And once nearly ran a foul
{y:i}of an English frigate.

1006
01:56:52,345 --> 01:56:57,183
{y:i}Our stores are low.
{y:i}The spirit of the men even lower.

1007
01:56:57,517 --> 01:57:00,020
His royal highness
woken up at last, has he?

1008
01:57:00,145 --> 01:57:03,523
Given you a rest,
has he, darling?

1009
01:57:05,358 --> 01:57:08,319
Fletcher wants you.

1010
01:57:15,076 --> 01:57:19,122
Ned, I found it.
Listen.

1011
01:57:19,831 --> 01:57:21,124
Where is it?

1012
01:57:21,249 --> 01:57:24,419
"July 2nd, we discovered an island,
seeming uninhabited. It was

1013
01:57:24,544 --> 01:57:28,423
well timbered. But we did not linger
for we could find no anchorage."

1014
01:57:28,548 --> 01:57:29,674
That's perfect.

1015
01:57:29,799 --> 01:57:33,094
Every ship in the Royal Navy has a
copy of that book and those charts.

1016
01:57:33,219 --> 01:57:34,637
They never drew it
on the charts.

1017
01:57:34,763 --> 01:57:37,640
All they give is a latitude,
25 degrees south.

1018
01:57:37,766 --> 01:57:41,353
Now it seems to me, all we have to do
is simply sail along this line of latitude.

1019
01:57:41,478 --> 01:57:42,896
We'll find the island.
Somewhere.

1020
01:57:43,021 --> 01:57:48,276
And if we don't? These men need a
home, Fletcher. They've mutinied once.

1021
01:57:48,401 --> 01:57:51,488
Oh, they'll have a home.
Pitcairn's Island.

1022
01:57:51,613 --> 01:57:54,157
They'd better.

1023
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:06,294
{y:i}I can no longer write
{y:i}for lack of strength.

1024
01:58:06,419 --> 01:58:11,383
{y:i}Commend me to your parents
{y:i}and our loving daughters.

1025
01:58:11,591 --> 01:58:17,681
Mr Bligh,
when my spirit is gone,

1026
01:58:17,806 --> 01:58:22,936
there will be nothing
but flesh remaining.

1027
01:58:24,396 --> 01:58:32,404
I beg you, use that poor flesh
to save the others.

1028
01:58:32,529 --> 01:58:37,534
No, no, Mr Nelson.
We're civilised men, not savages.

1029
01:58:37,659 --> 01:58:42,914
And as civilised men we shall die.
Have no fear.

1030
01:59:21,411 --> 01:59:25,331
Sir, we'd like a word.
We've had it up to here.

1031
01:59:25,457 --> 01:59:30,545
There is no island.
We want to turn back to Tahiti.

1032
01:59:32,088 --> 01:59:34,507
And who'll navigate?

1033
01:59:34,632 --> 01:59:37,802
You. You're the navigator.

1034
01:59:41,431 --> 01:59:44,267
I'll navigate.

1035
01:59:50,315 --> 01:59:54,569
This ship's going to
Pitcairn's Island.

1036
02:00:46,913 --> 02:00:49,207
Sir!

1037
02:00:51,710 --> 02:00:54,129
Sir!

1038
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:00,719
Smith.

1039
02:01:00,844 --> 02:01:02,220
It's land.

1040
02:01:02,345 --> 02:01:06,433
- What?
- I think it's land.

1041
02:01:10,645 --> 02:01:14,399
Mr Cole, you'll hoist the Jack.

1042
02:01:14,524 --> 02:01:19,112
It's not proper to land
without identification.

1043
02:02:20,256 --> 02:02:23,009
Oh, God.

1044
02:02:28,098 --> 02:02:36,898
Sir. I am Lieutenant William Bligh.
I'm a British naval officer...

1045
02:02:37,148 --> 02:02:41,653
and I have to report
an act of piracy.

1046
02:02:57,669 --> 02:03:01,965
We've found it.
We've found it, Ned.

1047
02:03:03,091 --> 02:03:05,719
It's our island.

1048
02:03:34,039 --> 02:03:37,208
We could easily have missed it.

1049
02:03:39,461 --> 02:03:42,047
Yes.

1050
02:05:40,707 --> 02:05:44,169
We'll never get off this
island now, will we, sir?

1051
02:05:44,294 --> 02:05:47,589
Never see England again.

1052
02:05:52,218 --> 02:05:58,933
This court finds that the seizure of
His Majesty's armed vessel, Bounty,

1053
02:05:59,059 --> 02:06:06,191
was an act of mutiny by Fletcher
Christian and others of her crew.

1054
02:06:06,316 --> 02:06:12,947
And that her captain, Lieutenant William
Bligh, is in the opinion of this court,

1055
02:06:13,073 --> 02:06:17,952
to be exonerated
of all blame on this occasion.

1056
02:06:18,078 --> 02:06:24,292
Indeed, in the matter of his command
of the Bounty's open launch,

1057
02:06:24,417 --> 02:06:31,883
we commend Lieutenant Bligh for his
courage and exemplary seamanship.

1058
02:06:32,175 --> 02:06:35,762
Will you please come
forward, Lieutenant?

1059
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:51,528
My Lord.

1060
02:06:53,655 --> 02:06:56,282
Thank you.
