300MB UNITED TEAM - sunmenghao

2
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:48,585
The coffin...

3
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:51,213
it has your initials, J.B.

4
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:53,048
At this moment,
rather him than me.

5
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,553
At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.

6
00:00:57,594 --> 00:01:00,889
Colonel Bouvar passed away
in his sleep, so they tell me.

7
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:06,186
You sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself.

8
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,899
I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues.

9
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:21,368
Is there anything else our
French station can do for Monsiuer Bond?

10
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:23,912
Later, perhaps.

11
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:37,509
As I said, later. Come on.

12
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:20,969
Madame...

13
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:24,473
I've come to offer
my sincere condolences.

14
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,060
My dear Colonel Bouvar...

15
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:31,146
I don't think you should have
opened that car door by yourself.

16
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,087
No well-dressed man
should be without one.

17
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:20,381
Yes, very practical.

18
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:22,174
Get inside.

19
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:25,844
- They're coming to get me.
- Hurry!

20
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:57,334
<i>He always runs</i>

21
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:00,003
<i>While others walk</i>

22
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:06,093
<i>He acts</i>

23
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:10,472
<i>While other men just talk</i>

24
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:17,896
<i>He looks at this world</i>

25
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,108
<i>And wants it all</i>

26
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:26,780
<i>So he strikes</i>

27
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:31,994
<i>Like Thunderball</i>

28
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:39,001
<i>He knows the meaning</i>

29
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:42,337
<i>Of success</i>

30
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:48,719
<i>His needs are more</i>

31
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:52,473
<i>So he gives less</i>

32
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:57,394
<i>They call him</i>

33
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,149
<i>The winner who takes all</i>

34
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:07,029
<i>And he strikes</i>

35
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:11,450
<i>Like Thunderball</i>

36
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:19,750
<i>Any woman he wants</i>

37
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,336
<i>He'll get</i>

38
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:28,509
<i>He will break any heart</i>

39
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:33,013
<i>Without regret</i>

40
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:39,144
<i>His days of asking</i>

41
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:42,314
<i>Are all gone</i>

42
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,237
<i>His fight goes on</i>

43
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,782
<i>And on and on</i>

44
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:58,247
<i>But he thinks that the fight</i>

45
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,250
<i>Is worth it all</i>

46
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:06,338
<i>So he strikes</i>

47
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:11,468
<i>Like Thunderball</i>

48
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:56,163
Hey, no parking here!

49
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,165
<i>Pardon, Monsieur Largo.</i>

50
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:10,135
<i>The International Brotherhood for
the Assistance of Stateless Persons...</i>

51
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:11,845
<i>is purely philanthropic.</i>

52
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:13,639
<i>We're not interested in politics...</i>

53
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:15,641
<i>only in your rehabilitation.</i>

54
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:19,645
We have been able to arrange for
visas at the Brazilian Consulate.

55
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:21,980
The Brotherhood
will look after you until...

56
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:24,399
- Good morning, Mr. Largo.
- Good morning.

57
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:27,027
- Nice to have you back again.
- Thank you, my dear.

58
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,404
- We pay back everything!
- There will be no need.

59
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:32,741
We have certain funds from
private individuals who share our aim.

60
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:57,683
Sit down, Number Two.
We will discuss...

61
00:08:57,766 --> 00:09:00,435
your NATO project later.

62
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:05,983
I regret to inform you all
of the death of Spectre Number Six.

63
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:09,444
Colonel Jacques Bouvar was killed
by an unknown assassin.

64
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:12,614
His services will be greatly missed.

65
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:16,785
We will now proceed with the area
financial reports. Number Seven.

66
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:22,291
Blackmail of the double agent
Matsou Fujiwa.

67
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:26,044
Unfortunately, only 40 million yen.

68
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:28,213
- All the man had.
- Number Ten.

69
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:31,883
Assassination of Perringe,
the French antimatter specialist...

70
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,885
who went over to the Russians.

71
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,305
Three million francs
from the special department...

72
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,432
- of the Quai D'Orsay.
- Number Five.

73
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:43,061
Our consultation fee for the
British train robbery: 250,000 pounds.

74
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:46,481
Number 11.

75
00:09:46,523 --> 00:09:50,360
Distribution of Red China narcotics
in the United States...

76
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:55,073
2,300,000 dollars, collected by
Number Nine and myself.

77
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:56,992
Two million three...

78
00:09:57,034 --> 00:10:01,455
Our expectations were considerably
higher, Number 11.

79
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,791
Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.

80
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,793
I anticipated that factor.

81
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:10,088
Are you quite sure all monies...

82
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:13,550
have been accounted for
by yourself and Number Nine?

83
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:17,095
- To the penny, Number One.
- On the contrary...

84
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:19,973
I have satisfied myself that
one of you is clearly...

85
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:22,184
guilty of embezzlement.

86
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,227
Spectre is a dedicated fraternity...

87
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,273
whose strength lies in
the absolute integrity of its members.

88
00:10:28,357 --> 00:10:30,525
The culprit is known to me.

89
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:33,278
I have decided
on the appropriate action.

90
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:57,261
Let us now proceed with new business.

91
00:10:57,302 --> 00:11:01,306
We will hear from Number Two,
who's in charge of our NATO project...

92
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,059
the most ambitious Spectre
has ever undertaken.

93
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:06,186
Your report, Number Two.

94
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:08,605
Thank you, Number One.

95
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:11,400
Our intention
is to demand a ransom...

96
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,944
from the
North Atlantic Treaty Powers...

97
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:16,738
of 280 million dollars...

98
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:19,283
100 million pounds.

99
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:23,453
I have sent Spectre agent Count Lippe
to the south of England...

100
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:26,707
where he is making
the necessary preparations.

101
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,417
He is at a health clinic...

102
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,255
conveniently located
near the NATO air base.

103
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:35,424
- Oh, Pat?
- Hello.

104
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,968
- I'll see you when I've had a shower.
- I'll soon be finished.

105
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,054
- Mr. Bond, Count Lippe.
- You're not taking her away already?

106
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:43,599
She's the only joy
in this dreary place.

107
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,727
I see you've discovered that too.

108
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:50,272
- About half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.

109
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:51,815
I've heard that before.

110
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:56,069
Nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.

111
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:00,574
Funny looking bruise. A fall?

112
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:03,910
A poker in the hands of a widow.

113
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:08,040
I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.

114
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:11,001
Not this one.
He didn't like me at all.

115
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:15,422
A red square
with a spike through it.

116
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:18,967
I think it's a Tong sign,
the red dragon from Macao.

117
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:23,138
<i>- Ask records to verify it for me.
- Sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.</i>

118
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,223
<i>- File it till you get back.
- Moneypenny...</i>

119
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:27,726
next time I see you,
I'll put you across my knee.

120
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:32,648
On yogurt and lemon juice?
I can hardly wait.

121
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,274
Come on, Pat.

122
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:35,984
I'm coming.

123
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:40,656
<i>I can't hear you. Have you fainted?</i>

124
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:15,834
You're late, Mr. Bond.

125
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,004
Me?

126
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,506
I'd never have recognized myself.

127
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,428
- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy. Take off your bathrobe.

128
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,891
You never say that
as if you meant it.

129
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:33,018
Arms above your head, please.

130
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:49,284
Behave yourself, Mr. Bond!

131
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:52,746
I can see there's only
one place to keep you quiet.

132
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,540
What's this?

133
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:58,543
A motorized traction table
for stretching the spine.

134
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:00,587
Some patients call it the rack.

135
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:02,255
I'm not surprised.

136
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,924
Get on.

137
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:07,135
Where's the kick starter?

138
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,846
Stop fooling around
and face down, please.

139
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,431
Face down.

140
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:15,310
By the way, who is the man
in the room next to your Count Lippe?

141
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,479
I really don't know
too much about him.

142
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:19,273
A Mr. Angelo.

143
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:23,860
He's here with a private physician,
recuperating from an awful car crash.

144
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:28,991
There, now, the first time
I've felt really safe all day.

145
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,579
I'll look in and see
how you're doing in 15 minutes.

146
00:15:55,058 --> 00:15:57,019
Nice to have met you.

147
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,859
Hey, come back!

148
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,826
Help!

149
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,634
Oh, thank God!

150
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:31,345
You could've been killed!

151
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,390
I must be six inches taller.

152
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,393
You poor dear.

153
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:41,021
I can't think how
it could have happened.

154
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:44,900
I can tell you, it's a miracle
I came back when I did.

155
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:49,321
I can only think that you must have
pushed the switch accidentally.

156
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:51,323
You better come along with me.

157
00:16:51,406 --> 00:16:55,160
Spend a few minutes in the steam room.
It'll help to relax you.

158
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:57,913
- Yes.
- Might even shrink you back to size.

159
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:01,083
Somebody's going to wish
today had never happened.

160
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,251
You wouldn't tell Dr. Wain.

161
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:05,504
Please, I'd lose my job.

162
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:10,217
Well, I suppose my silence
could have a price.

163
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,762
You don't mean... Oh, no.

164
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,764
Oh, yes.

165
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:27,943
See you later, irrigator.

166
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:03,145
- What the hell are you doing?
- Don't you worry. I'll tell the chef.

167
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:06,148
Let me out of this bloody machine!

168
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:07,983
Help!

169
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,829
Mink.

170
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:23,832
It reduces the tensions.

171
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,628
Not mine.

172
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:43,143
Major Derval's social secretary.

173
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:45,687
<i>- I would like to speak to Mr. Angelo.
- What's that?</i>

174
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,689
<i>- Mr. Angelo.
- I'm sorry.</i>

175
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:50,484
You got the wrong number.

176
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,112
You don't think you could be
more comfortable if you take off this...

177
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:57,866
<i>- Yes?
- Major Derval?</i>

178
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,868
<i>- This is Major Derval.
- Your car is waiting.</i>

179
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:02,496
I'll be down right away. Thank you.

180
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:06,458
My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.

181
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,877
You'll be late at the air base.

182
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,380
Besides, it will give you
time to cool off.

183
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:13,548
You'll be here when I come back?

184
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:18,053
But I may not be in the mood then.

185
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:21,640
- Do you wanna bet?
- You know your Francois.

186
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:23,392
I know me.

187
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:25,560
All right.

188
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:28,772
- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir.

189
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:32,609
Happy landing!

190
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,611
Thank you.

191
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:37,364
Be good, at least until I get back.

192
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,381
- Nobody saw us. The corridor's empty.
- Shut the door!

193
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,930
He's dead all right.
Lippe, you take over.

194
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:04,850
- Are the doctor and ambulance outside?
- Everything as arranged.

195
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:07,436
Angelo.

196
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,605
Your breathing equipment.

197
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,399
Isolates you from the oxygen supply.

198
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,779
Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used. And most important...

199
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:27,956
Not enough.
100,000 dollars is not enough.

200
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:30,542
- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.

201
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:32,419
Two years of my life...

202
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:34,963
studying the film, the reports...

203
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:38,884
plastic operations, voice lessons.

204
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:43,096
Make it a quarter of a million,
or get someone else.

205
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,808
- There is no one else.
- Exactly. I am Derval.

206
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:56,985
Put that away. Angelo is right.

207
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,905
I'll inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.

208
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:02,866
This is merely a down payment.

209
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,619
All right, but against
a quarter of a million.

210
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:07,829
- Agreed.
- His watch.

211
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:10,082
Identification Disc.

212
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:16,505
- Au revoir!
- No, he always says ciao.

213
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:21,510
The cap's too far back on your head.

214
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:27,015
The rest of my money,
just have it ready.

215
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:33,480
Come on. Get him into his pajamas.

216
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:49,538
Sir, identity, please.

217
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,380
Thank you, sir.

218
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:02,718
This is a normal training sortie,
and you'll be accompanied...

219
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,054
by a NATO representative,
Commandant Derval...

220
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,432
Major Derval of NATO.

221
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:11,226
It's a routine flight.
You'll be flying a Vulcan...

222
00:22:11,268 --> 00:22:13,228
<i>at an altitude of 45,000 feet...</i>

223
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,024
<i>armed with two atomic bombs,
M.O.S. Type.</i>

224
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:19,693
<i>Fuses as usual
in the white security box.</i>

225
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,974
Oh, those damned aeroplanes!

226
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:54,436
They're enough to drive you mad.

227
00:22:56,271 --> 00:23:00,067
Unless, of course,
it's that mink glove of yours.

228
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,488
I'll shut out the noise.

229
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:29,429
James, where are you going?

230
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:34,935
Nowhere. I thought
I'd take a little exercise.

231
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:37,145
You must be joking.

232
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,440
Come on.

233
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:45,445
Quiet!

234
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:50,946
<i>Can I help you?
County Police here.</i>

235
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:52,614
<i>Hello?</i>

236
00:25:58,954 --> 00:26:01,415
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

237
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:03,625
Could it be the front doorbell?

238
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:06,503
- It most certainly could not.
- Hello.

239
00:26:06,587 --> 00:26:10,549
Haven't you had enough exercise
for one evening?

240
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:13,093
It's funny you should say that.

241
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:18,640
Point of return...

242
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:21,602
45 minutes, 30 seconds.

243
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,148
Switch from manual to auto.

244
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,609
It's set on automatic. Commandant...

245
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,153
would you care to change places
with the copilot?

246
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:33,280
- Better view up here.
- I'd be delighted.

247
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:09,816
<i>This is Southern Radar.</i>

248
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:13,570
<i>You are now under
positive radar control.</i>

249
00:27:13,654 --> 00:27:15,572
<i>This is avoiding action.</i>

250
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:15,549
<i>Request you report your position.</i>

251
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:54,212
Take this, will you?
What's the flap, Dawson?

252
00:28:54,296 --> 00:28:57,215
O-B-N-R, sir. NATO training flight.
Air traffic flashed us.

253
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,968
They lost it on radar. We haven't
been able to pick it up anywhere.

254
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:02,554
Was she losing altitude
when she went off the screen?

255
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:05,140
Rapidly.
We can't scan below 300 feet.

256
00:29:05,223 --> 00:29:07,142
- She may have gone down.
- Was she in trouble?

257
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:10,228
Not according to the last report,
which came from about here.

258
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:13,565
- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, M.O.S. Type.

259
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:16,026
Get everything you can into the area.
A thorough search.

260
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:19,488
Notify the Admiralty at once.
Top priority. Absolute security.

261
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:21,615
- Ask them to contact Washington.
- Very good, sir.

262
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:51,353
Is there anything else in sight?

263
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:53,188
No. All clear.

264
00:29:53,272 --> 00:29:56,233
Switch on
the underwater landing lights.

265
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:16,605
Open the underwater hatch.

266
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:42,037
- Stand by to winch in the submarine.
- Man the winches!

267
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:50,879
- Give these bomb fuses to Mr. Kutze.
- Right, sir.

268
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:57,219
Get the submarine up quickly and
the bombs loaded in the containers.

269
00:35:57,302 --> 00:36:00,472
Kutze, are you pleased
with your new toys?

270
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:03,392
Some new safety device.
A secret control.

271
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:06,728
What can they have that the great
Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?

272
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:10,023
Life was much simpler
in my Warsaw laboratory.

273
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:13,485
Your share will amount to
how many Nobel Prizes?

274
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:15,487
Pull forward!

275
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:19,574
More. Hold it!

276
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:45,559
Paris, sir.
Number One on the scrambler.

277
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,356
Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.

278
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,944
Number Two has done well,
unlike Count Lippe...

279
00:36:56,028 --> 00:37:00,657
whose choice of Angelo might have
jeopardized the success of our project.

280
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:03,243
Send a message to the Execution Branch.

281
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:06,079
You will write,
or telephone at the least.

282
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:09,666
Day by day. I'm truly sorry
I have to dash off like this.

283
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,668
There's been a bit
of a flap at the office.

284
00:37:11,752 --> 00:37:14,212
- What kind of work do you do?
- I travel...

285
00:37:14,296 --> 00:37:17,257
sort of a licensed troubleshooter.

286
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,470
Mr. Angelo. Heart attack last night.

287
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:23,388
I'm not surprised.

288
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:28,226
- Keep in touch.
- Anytime, James. Anyplace.

289
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,396
Another time, another place.

290
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:55,355
- You are late!
- Yes.

291
00:38:55,397 --> 00:38:57,816
Some people on the road
really burn you up these days.

292
00:38:57,899 --> 00:39:00,360
In the conference room.
Something pretty big.

293
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:04,740
Every Double-0 man in Europe has been
rushed in, and the Home Secretary too.

294
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:07,200
His wife's probably lost her dog.

295
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:24,468
Well, now that we're all here...

296
00:39:29,431 --> 00:39:32,809
The Prime Minister
has asked the Home Secretary...

297
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:35,020
to come and represent him here today.

298
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:36,438
The Home Secretary.

299
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:41,234
Gentlemen, the tape
that you are about to hear...

300
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:43,904
was received at 10 Downing Street
this morning.

301
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:47,282
<i>My dear Prime Minister.</i>

302
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:49,284
<i>Two atomic bombs...</i>

303
00:39:49,326 --> 00:39:51,912
<i>numbers 4-5-6 and 4-5-7...</i>

304
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:55,165
<i>which were aboard NATO flight 7-5-9...</i>

305
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:57,626
<i>are now in the possession of Spectre.</i>

306
00:39:57,668 --> 00:40:01,004
<i>Unless within the next seven days
your government...</i>

307
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:05,259
<i>pays to us
100 million pounds sterling...</i>

308
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,428
<i>in a manner to be designated by us...</i>

309
00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:10,597
<i>we shall destroy
a major city in England...</i>

310
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,101
<i>or the United States of America.</i>

311
00:40:14,184 --> 00:40:16,979
<i>Please signal your acceptance
of our terms by arranging...</i>

312
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,607
<i>for Big Ben to strike seven times...</i>

313
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:24,778
<i>at 6:00 p. m. Tomorrow.</i>

314
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,322
The Prime Minister and the President...

315
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:32,119
have talked together
over the hot line and have agreed...

316
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,790
that unless the bombs are recovered,
payment will have to be made.

317
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:38,625
To avoid general panic...

318
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:42,170
complete secrecy will be maintained
and no press announcements.

319
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:45,674
The Prime Minister has asked
that your department...

320
00:40:45,716 --> 00:40:47,676
take charge of the operation.

321
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:49,803
Thank you. Sir John.

322
00:41:06,194 --> 00:41:09,823
This circle represents
the full flying range of the Vulcan.

323
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:12,993
Extensive search has failed to locate
any evidence of either a crash...

324
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:16,038
or landing, and worldwide reports
have proved negative...

325
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,041
on all airfields large enough
to handle the Vulcan.

326
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:21,877
- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.

327
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:26,465
I'll leave you to carry on.
We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.

328
00:41:26,548 --> 00:41:28,467
Thank you, sir.

329
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:33,138
You may now open the folders
in front of you.

330
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:44,149
Code name: Thunderball.

331
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:49,029
As you can see,
we've very little to go on.

332
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,573
All the members of the crew...

333
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:53,951
had top security clearance.

334
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:57,204
You'll find their photographs
and service records in your files.

335
00:41:57,287 --> 00:42:00,582
You'll be working with NATO, C.I. A...

336
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,584
and all allied intelligence units.

337
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:04,002
That's all...

338
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,380
until you discuss your
individual assignments with me.

339
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:12,010
I've assigned you
to station C, Canada.

340
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,846
Group Captain Pritchard here
will be your Air Force liaison.

341
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,183
Sir, I respectfully suggest that
you change my assignment to Nassau.

342
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:21,937
Is there any other reason besides
your enthusiasm of water sports?

343
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,606
Perhaps this, sir.

344
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,362
- Well?
- There was a photograph of that man...

345
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:32,364
in this dossier you gave us.

346
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:34,366
His name is Derval.

347
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:37,536
I saw him last night at Shrublands,
but he was dead.

348
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:39,955
Oh, no, sir. Not possible.
He was seen...

349
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:41,957
boarding the Vulcan
and took off last night.

350
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,420
If 007 says he saw Derval
last night and he was dead...

351
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:49,131
that's enough for me
to initiate inquiries.

352
00:42:49,214 --> 00:42:50,882
Yes, of course.

353
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:54,219
- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister.

354
00:42:56,221 --> 00:42:58,140
- Do you know where she is now?
- Nassau.

355
00:42:59,474 --> 00:43:01,602
Do you think she's worth going after?

356
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:03,812
I wouldn't put it quite that way.

357
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:06,440
We've only got four days.

358
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:09,067
Don't spend your time sitting around.

359
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:11,445
No, sir, I won't.

360
00:43:12,988 --> 00:43:15,115
Good luck.

361
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:17,242
Thank you, sir.

362
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:19,453
Smashing figure.
I don't suppose...

363
00:43:19,494 --> 00:43:22,164
that has anything to do
with your request?

364
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:24,416
Was there ever a man
more misunderstood?

365
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:26,627
You can't pull the wool over my eyes.

366
00:43:26,668 --> 00:43:30,464
You may be able to con the old man,
but I know better. I could...

367
00:43:31,757 --> 00:43:33,926
So do I, Miss Moneypenny.

368
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:38,096
And I'll thank you not to refer to me
as the old man.

369
00:43:39,431 --> 00:43:41,975
I think I had a hat when I came in.

370
00:43:49,274 --> 00:43:51,902
How else will you recognize her?

371
00:43:51,985 --> 00:43:55,614
Couldn't miss.
She has two moles on the left thigh.

372
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:02,598
- Thank you, Mr...
- James Bond.

373
00:45:02,681 --> 00:45:04,725
I arrived soon after you went down.

374
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:06,893
- I've been admiring your form.
- Have you?

375
00:45:06,935 --> 00:45:10,397
Your name's James Bond
and you've been admiring my form.

376
00:45:10,439 --> 00:45:12,774
Most girls just paddle around.

377
00:45:12,816 --> 00:45:15,527
- You swim like a man.
- So do you.

378
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:18,030
I've had quite a bit of practice.

379
00:45:18,113 --> 00:45:20,741
- Do you come here often?
- Whenever I'm bored.

380
00:45:20,782 --> 00:45:22,618
Practically every day.

381
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:24,745
What else do you do, and where?

382
00:45:24,786 --> 00:45:27,205
- You don't waste time, do you?
- No.

383
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:29,207
- For effort.
- Thank you.

384
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:31,543
I'll wear it so you know me next time.

385
00:45:32,878 --> 00:45:34,796
I was right. Couldn't miss.

386
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,424
- I'm not with you.
- You soon will be.

387
00:45:40,802 --> 00:45:41,929
Paula!

388
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,556
- Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.

389
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:50,437
Tell London I've made contact
with the girl.

390
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:52,898
Well, it's not what I'd call contact.

391
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:55,442
I'll pass it through
you've seen the girl.

392
00:45:56,944 --> 00:46:00,155
- Keep trying.
- It won't start!

393
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:10,165
Ahoy there! Our motor's conked out.

394
00:46:10,249 --> 00:46:12,209
You wouldn't be going anywhere
near Coral Harbor, would you?

395
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:14,002
I wasn't, but I could.

396
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:17,297
I have a very important appointment.
I'd appreciate a lift.

397
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,132
Come aboard then!

398
00:46:19,174 --> 00:46:21,176
You don't mind taking
the service boat, do you?

399
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,678
Not at all.

400
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:25,305
Hurry up!

401
00:47:04,886 --> 00:47:08,515
- Perhaps lunch by the pool.
- How about your urgent appointment?

402
00:47:25,866 --> 00:47:27,784
How long have you been out here?

403
00:47:27,868 --> 00:47:29,786
About three weeks.

404
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:32,080
Don't you ever stop asking questions?

405
00:47:32,164 --> 00:47:35,667
All right. Change of tack.
Have some of my conch chowder.

406
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:38,837
You've been reading
the wrong books, Mr. Bond.

407
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:40,881
- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.

408
00:47:41,965 --> 00:47:44,217
It just so happens that
I like conch chowder.

409
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,391
Friend of yours?

410
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:54,895
- Works for my guardian.
- Your guardian has you watched?

411
00:47:54,978 --> 00:47:58,440
- He likes to know where I am.
- I don't blame him.

412
00:48:06,531 --> 00:48:09,284
- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?

413
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:11,078
I'm afraid so.

414
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,705
My guardian's yacht.

415
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:15,123
Oh, really?

416
00:48:15,165 --> 00:48:17,626
- He'll be expecting me.
- May I come with you?

417
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:20,462
- I'd love to meet your guardian.
- Oh, no.

418
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:23,340
- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.

419
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:25,926
- Perhaps we can have dinner together.
- No.

420
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:29,513
- My dear, uncooperative Domino.
- How do you know that?

421
00:48:29,596 --> 00:48:32,641
How do you know
my friends call me Domino?

422
00:48:32,724 --> 00:48:34,935
It's on the bracelet on your ankle.

423
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:38,105
What sharp little eyes you've got.

424
00:48:39,648 --> 00:48:41,566
Wait till you get to my teeth.

425
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:53,495
Bye then.
See you tomorrow on the beach.

426
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:29,448
- 500 pounds, please.
- Certainly, monsieur.

427
00:49:29,573 --> 00:49:31,033
Thanks.

428
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:36,121
Sorry.

429
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:38,123
- There.
- Thank you.

430
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:50,260
Two hundred.

431
00:50:09,154 --> 00:50:10,238
Eight.

432
00:50:12,324 --> 00:50:14,534
Someone has to lose.

433
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:16,662
Yes, I thought I saw
a spectre at your shoulder.

434
00:50:18,288 --> 00:50:20,249
What do you mean?

435
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,502
The spectre of defeat.
Your luck was due to change.

436
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:25,545
We'll soon find out.

437
00:50:25,587 --> 00:50:28,215
Any objection to raise the limit?
500 pounds shall we say?

438
00:50:28,298 --> 00:50:30,592
- Too big for me.
- Count me out too.

439
00:50:30,676 --> 00:50:32,594
Perhaps you would like
to take the shoe.

440
00:50:32,678 --> 00:50:34,846
My friend won't mind, Mr...

441
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,516
- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr. Bond.

442
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:42,521
- One of my associates spoke about you.
- Nothing bad, I hope.

443
00:50:45,524 --> 00:50:48,735
It's your spectre against mine.

444
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:50,862
You wish to put the evil eye on me?

445
00:50:50,946 --> 00:50:54,074
We have a way to deal with that
where I come from.

446
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:56,118
You may hex me.
Let's see what it does for the cards.

447
00:50:58,287 --> 00:51:01,123
- No.
- Seven.

448
00:51:01,164 --> 00:51:02,457
Six.

449
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:22,894
Eight.

450
00:51:22,978 --> 00:51:24,563
Nine.

451
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:28,942
You seem to be unbeatable, Mr. Bond.

452
00:51:28,984 --> 00:51:31,486
For the moment.
This sort of thing can't last.

453
00:51:31,528 --> 00:51:33,488
Emilio, you promised
to buy me a drink.

454
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,574
Soon, my dear.
I want to get my money back first.

455
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:38,118
May I be allowed
to buy the lady a drink?

456
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:42,998
- I would appreciate that.
- Then I must pass the shoe.

457
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:50,172
He's going to be impossible
if his luck doesn't change.

458
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:52,341
Somehow, I don't think it will tonight.

459
00:51:54,635 --> 00:51:57,137
Beluga caviar, Dom Perignon, '55.

460
00:51:57,179 --> 00:51:59,806
- Monsieur.
- Thank you.

461
00:51:59,848 --> 00:52:01,808
I understand you're Mr. Largo's niece.

462
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:07,689
Sounds better than... What would you say?
Mistress? Kept woman?

463
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:10,442
I wouldn't say that.
Where did you meet him?

464
00:52:10,525 --> 00:52:13,779
In Capri. I was there
with my brother, Francois.

465
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:18,909
Strange. I found Emilio attractive...

466
00:52:18,992 --> 00:52:20,118
then.

467
00:52:21,245 --> 00:52:24,456
- Does he live aboard the yacht?
- No. He has a house on the island.

468
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:27,834
Must we talk about him?
I'd much rather dance.

469
00:52:27,876 --> 00:52:29,836
So would I.

470
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:39,179
- Where is your brother now?
- In England.

471
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:42,015
He's a Commandant
with the NATO forces there.

472
00:52:42,057 --> 00:52:44,559
He's a wonderful person.

473
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:47,437
The trouble is
I never meet anyone like him.

474
00:52:47,521 --> 00:52:51,233
- Only men like Largo and myself.
- You are not like Largo.

475
00:52:51,316 --> 00:52:52,901
No?

476
00:52:53,944 --> 00:52:55,904
Why do you say that?

477
00:52:58,448 --> 00:53:01,159
The way you hold me.

478
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:06,582
There.

479
00:53:12,421 --> 00:53:15,882
- How long are you staying in Nassau?
- We're going the day after tomorrow.

480
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:20,887
As I said,
we haven't got much time.

481
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:23,056
Emilio wants to leave.

482
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,146
Are you sleeping aboard tonight?

483
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,108
I hoped you'd not be so obvious.

484
00:53:33,191 --> 00:53:35,902
Well, when one has so little time,
one sort of has to be obvious.

485
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:38,780
- You know where you can find me.
- Mr. Bond.

486
00:53:38,864 --> 00:53:41,116
Your niece is an excellent dancer.

487
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,620
Let me prove I'm as good a loser
as you are a winner.

488
00:53:44,703 --> 00:53:47,915
Come to lunch on Sunday.
The Palmyra. It's my house.

489
00:53:47,998 --> 00:53:49,958
Sunday at noon, then.

490
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,460
My dear.

491
00:53:51,543 --> 00:53:53,503
- Good night.
- Good night.

492
00:53:53,587 --> 00:53:56,882
You must tell me what Mr. Bond
had to say, word for word.

493
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:58,884
He talked about you a little.

494
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:01,011
What was he saying just then?
I didn't quite hear.

495
00:54:01,094 --> 00:54:03,138
He asked were we
sleeping aboard tonight.

496
00:54:03,221 --> 00:54:04,806
Interesting.

497
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:24,952
- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.

498
00:54:26,703 --> 00:54:29,623
- I'm sorry, no mail.
- Thank you.

499
00:56:33,372 --> 00:56:34,998
Well, hello, 00...

500
00:57:02,109 --> 00:57:04,236
That's a fine way
to treat the C.I.A.

501
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,656
Sorry about that, Felix,
but you were about to say 007.

502
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:09,324
Here.

503
00:57:11,201 --> 00:57:13,161
Have you killed him?

504
00:57:13,203 --> 00:57:15,664
You know me better than that.
Here you go, Smiler.

505
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:20,627
Have you seen everything
you came to see?

506
00:57:20,669 --> 00:57:22,629
Go back to your friends and report.

507
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:27,009
Tell them, the little fish I throw back
into the sea. Give it to him.

508
00:57:27,092 --> 00:57:29,636
You're going to shoot me in the back.

509
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,805
The gun, I mean.

510
00:57:35,183 --> 00:57:37,019
Get out!

511
00:57:37,102 --> 00:57:40,147
- Who was he?
- Like I said, a small fish...

512
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,190
working for a Mr. Largo.

513
00:57:42,274 --> 00:57:44,818
He's got a yacht
we should take a look at later.

514
00:57:49,698 --> 00:57:52,826
- Quist to see Mr. Largo.
- Open up.

515
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,342
Yes? It's Quist.

516
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:13,180
Gently, my friend.

517
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:16,433
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

518
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:19,186
- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.

519
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:21,229
What happened?

520
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,069
You let him get the better of you.

521
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:57,683
Hey, there,
did you finally make contact?

522
00:58:57,766 --> 00:59:00,811
You're late. Felix Leiter,
this is Pinder, our man here.

523
00:59:00,894 --> 00:59:03,814
- How do you do?
- This way, gentlemen.

524
00:59:03,897 --> 00:59:06,733
- Who's the girl?
- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.

525
00:59:12,614 --> 00:59:15,534
<i>He has no plans
to visit the United States.</i>

526
00:59:15,617 --> 00:59:17,536
<i>Now here's a special announcement...</i>

527
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:19,705
<i>from the Overseas Service
of the B.B.C.</i>

528
00:59:19,788 --> 00:59:24,459
<i>Big Ben actually did strike
seven times at 6:00 this evening.</i>

529
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,461
<i>This was caused
by a mechanical failure...</i>

530
00:59:26,545 --> 00:59:30,591
<i>which last occurred during
a violent electrical storm in 1898.</i>

531
00:59:30,674 --> 00:59:33,093
<i>And here once again
are the headlines.</i>

532
00:59:33,135 --> 00:59:35,137
Obviously stalling for time.

533
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:40,934
- Oh, no!
- Ah, 007.

534
00:59:41,018 --> 00:59:43,687
- What a wonderful surprise.
- For me too.

535
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:46,940
I must say, I find this business
of equipping you in the field...

536
00:59:47,024 --> 00:59:50,110
on the run, as it were...
highly irregular.

537
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:53,780
Here we have a Geiger counter.

538
00:59:53,864 --> 00:59:55,824
Useful and unobtrusive.

539
00:59:55,866 --> 00:59:58,952
The sweep hand
takes the radioactivity count.

540
00:59:59,036 --> 01:00:01,163
- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.

541
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:05,876
Now, here's something I want you
to use with special care.

542
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,547
- With special care.
- Everything you give me...

543
01:00:10,631 --> 01:00:12,799
Is treated with equal contempt.
Yes, I know.

544
01:00:12,883 --> 01:00:15,469
But that's an underwater camera.
It takes eight pictures...

545
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:18,805
in rapid succession
by pressing that button there.

546
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:20,933
- Is that clever?
- If you can take pictures...

547
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:23,977
in the dark with an infrared film, yes.

548
01:00:27,189 --> 01:00:30,651
Try to be a little less than
your usual frivolous self, 007.

549
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:33,070
Here's a miniature Very pistol...

550
01:00:33,153 --> 01:00:36,907
which fires a bright red flare,
a distress signal.

551
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:39,743
You should keep it on you
day and night.

552
01:00:39,826 --> 01:00:42,746
I resent that remark.

553
01:00:44,248 --> 01:00:46,833
Look, do you mind?

554
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:49,294
Now, in the event of a re-breather
not being available...

555
01:00:49,378 --> 01:00:52,256
you can use this device
for short periods only, of course.

556
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:54,508
Say, about four minutes.

557
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:57,844
- Clever.
- You'll only use it as a last resort.

558
01:00:57,886 --> 01:01:01,682
It closes
to a convenient pocket size.

559
01:01:01,765 --> 01:01:03,725
Assuming one has a convenient pocket.

560
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:06,770
Now pay attention.
A recently developed...

561
01:01:06,853 --> 01:01:09,189
harmless radioactive device.

562
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:10,691
Harmless.

563
01:01:10,732 --> 01:01:13,527
It sends out a homing signal
to a special receiver.

564
01:01:16,613 --> 01:01:19,575
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Obviously, you...

565
01:01:19,616 --> 01:01:20,867
swallow it.

566
01:01:22,286 --> 01:01:23,620
Now?

567
01:01:27,207 --> 01:01:30,252
Let's hope she'll still be lying
in the same place tonight.

568
01:01:30,335 --> 01:01:34,172
We'll use this catamaran
as a rendezvous place for later.

569
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:35,841
Good idea.

570
01:01:35,924 --> 01:01:38,218
Take her in.

571
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:42,180
<i>A container will be dropped
off the coast of Burma...</i>

572
01:01:42,264 --> 01:01:44,391
<i>in the Megui Archipelago...</i>

573
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:49,730
<i>latitude 20 degrees north,
longitude 60 degrees east...</i>

574
01:01:49,771 --> 01:01:53,400
<i>at 20 hundred hours
Greenwich mean time on May 27.</i>

575
01:01:54,818 --> 01:01:58,822
<i>It will hold blue-white
flawless diamonds between...</i>

576
01:01:58,906 --> 01:02:00,657
<i>three and eight carats.</i>

577
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:03,869
<i>Total value to be not less than
100 million pounds...</i>

578
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:06,580
<i>present market price.</i>

579
01:02:06,663 --> 01:02:09,166
<i>After we have
recovered the container...</i>

580
01:02:09,249 --> 01:02:11,168
<i>and verified its contents...</i>

581
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:16,006
<i>you will be notified on
radio frequency 16.23 megacycles...</i>

582
01:02:16,089 --> 01:02:18,759
<i>where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.</i>

583
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:22,554
Kenniston, you'd better get on
to De Beers at once.

584
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:24,014
Yes, sir.

585
01:02:24,097 --> 01:02:27,726
Well, gentlemen,
unless those bombs are found...

586
01:02:27,809 --> 01:02:29,937
I'm very much afraid
we'll have to pay their price.

587
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:33,106
- Sir?
- Oh, yes.

588
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:35,192
Signal from 007 in Nassau.

589
01:02:35,275 --> 01:02:37,402
One or two things
that might interest us.

590
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:40,864
<i>The Disco Volante is still in the
harbor, lying off the casino channel.</i>

591
01:02:40,948 --> 01:02:43,450
The catamaran is there too,
so we can use it for cover.

592
01:02:43,533 --> 01:02:46,411
That's fine. You can drop me
in the water behind her.

593
01:02:46,495 --> 01:02:48,497
- Any further news from London?
- No.

594
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,416
Zero hour is still
20 hundred hours on the 27th.

595
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,920
- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?

596
01:02:59,174 --> 01:03:02,344
- Okay, this will do here.
- We'll meet back at Pinder's.

597
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:04,012
Good luck.

598
01:03:57,608 --> 01:03:59,568
Turn the underwater lights on.

599
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:09,328
TV, closed-circuit!

600
01:04:30,724 --> 01:04:32,309
Hand grenades.

601
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:35,729
Ready.

602
01:04:43,487 --> 01:04:45,656
Down there.

603
01:05:00,212 --> 01:05:02,089
There!

604
01:05:42,337 --> 01:05:44,756
Hey, there's something there!

605
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:07,362
Look! Must have hit him
with the propeller.

606
01:06:07,446 --> 01:06:09,364
Let's get back and tell Largo.

607
01:06:49,154 --> 01:06:51,073
- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.

608
01:06:51,156 --> 01:06:53,867
Thank you.
You just about saved my life.

609
01:06:54,952 --> 01:06:57,704
My outboard capsized,
so I had to swim ashore.

610
01:06:59,539 --> 01:07:01,458
How far do you go?

611
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:05,921
You better fasten your safety belt.

612
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:10,550
What's your name?

613
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:12,469
James Bond.

614
01:07:13,553 --> 01:07:15,555
Fiona Volpe.

615
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:35,742
- Do you fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?

616
01:07:35,826 --> 01:07:38,287
No, it's just that
I have no desire...

617
01:07:38,328 --> 01:07:41,248
to be capsized twice in one night.

618
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,792
At least you won't
have to swim ashore.

619
01:07:49,506 --> 01:07:51,675
Have you been here before, Mr. Bond?

620
01:07:51,758 --> 01:07:55,929
No, I haven't.
But this is the road to Nassau?

621
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:59,016
Yes, eventually.

622
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:26,168
- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Me too. This is my hotel.

623
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:28,629
- What a coincidence.
- Yes, so convenient.

624
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:34,718
You look pale.
I hope I didn't frighten you.

625
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:36,720
You see, I've always
been a nervous passenger.

626
01:08:36,803 --> 01:08:38,722
Some men just don't like to be driven.

627
01:08:38,805 --> 01:08:41,642
No, some men just don't like
to be taken for a ride.

628
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,487
Look at this.

629
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:55,489
An underwater hatch.

630
01:08:55,572 --> 01:08:58,825
Yeah. So that's how
they could leave and get back.

631
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:01,286
Yes, and nobody saw them.
Obviously the whole operation...

632
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,288
was carried out underwater.

633
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,999
That's where we'll have to look
for the plane. Come on.

634
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:08,502
I'll bring the prints
to the hotel when they're dry.

635
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:19,429
Don't forget the Air Force searched
the area 250 miles out of Nassau.

636
01:09:19,513 --> 01:09:21,598
It must be beyond that radius.

637
01:09:21,682 --> 01:09:24,142
<i>That's if the Disco Volante
was out that night.</i>

638
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:27,896
Sure she was, but harbor control
said for only six hours.

639
01:09:29,523 --> 01:09:33,777
She couldn't cover 500 miles
in that time, no.

640
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:37,614
About 90 miles is her limit for
six hours, and that's out and back.

641
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:45,497
I reckon we've got to go further out.
We'll need more gas for that.

642
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,916
All right.
Let's get back to Nassau.

643
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:51,378
- We haven't got much time.
- You're right, we haven't.

644
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:11,690
Pull!

645
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:13,859
Of course they are watching us.

646
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:16,778
What else have they to do?

647
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:23,118
- You would like Bond dead?
- I can think of no better arrangement.

648
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:26,496
Because he tries to make love
to your woman?

649
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:30,500
Because he is Bond, and as an enemy
of Spectre, he should be killed.

650
01:10:30,584 --> 01:10:31,877
Mark!

651
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,089
If Bond had died last night
as a result of your hastiness...

652
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:39,968
his government would have known
for certain that the bombs are here.

653
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:43,221
When the time is right,
he will be killed. Pull!

654
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:48,185
I shall kill him.

655
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:55,776
A separate pool.
For sharks, no less. Move in.

656
01:10:57,527 --> 01:10:59,488
Hold on that line.

657
01:11:02,532 --> 01:11:05,619
That's Largo's place, all right.
My next port of call.

658
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:27,975
- Mr. Largo?
- Yes, sir.

659
01:11:28,016 --> 01:11:29,309
Thank you.

660
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:49,496
- Can I help?
- Why, Mr. Bond.

661
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,499
- Of course you can.
- That looks particularly inviting.

662
01:11:54,626 --> 01:11:56,920
- Welcome to Palmyra.
- It's a pleasure.

663
01:11:57,004 --> 01:11:59,381
I just hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

664
01:11:59,423 --> 01:12:02,050
- What do you mean?
- I thought you had another visitor.

665
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:09,182
That gun, it looks
more fitting for a woman.

666
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,518
You know much about guns?

667
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,146
No. I know a little about women.

668
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:19,568
Mr. Jenni, Mr. Vargas.
Mr. Vargas, Mr. Jenni.

669
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:22,321
- Which is which?
- I thought you might have met...

670
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,323
Mr. Vargas the other night.

671
01:12:25,991 --> 01:12:29,161
- Yes, I believe I did.
- Drink, sir?

672
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:32,331
- Rum Collins?
- Yes.

673
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:34,499
Just about that hour, isn't it?

674
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,961
For you? Of course!

675
01:12:38,045 --> 01:12:40,339
Vargas does not drink,
does not smoke...

676
01:12:41,673 --> 01:12:44,051
does not make love.

677
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:49,181
What do you do, Vargas?
Every man has his passion.

678
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,183
Mine is fishing.

679
01:12:52,559 --> 01:12:54,811
What is yours, Mr. Bond?

680
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:57,940
Well, I'm not what you'd call
a passionate man.

681
01:13:04,696 --> 01:13:07,115
I think it's time I went to change.

682
01:13:08,575 --> 01:13:10,994
You must let me show you around.

683
01:13:11,078 --> 01:13:15,332
- I'd love that.
- I thought you might.

684
01:13:15,415 --> 01:13:17,042
Pull!

685
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:20,462
- What could be easier?
- Perhaps you would call one for me?

686
01:13:20,504 --> 01:13:23,048
- Of course. Pull!
- It seems terribly difficult.

687
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:28,512
No, it isn't, is it?

688
01:13:34,726 --> 01:13:38,522
I collect big game fish
for various marine institutions.

689
01:13:38,605 --> 01:13:40,524
Magnificent creatures!

690
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,277
Charming.

691
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,279
The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.

692
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,906
The most savage, the most dangerous.

693
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,908
They know when it's time
for them to be fed.

694
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,455
- That boat, is she yours?
- Yes. I'm very proud of her.

695
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:58,166
What does she do, about 15 knots?

696
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,128
Better than that. Near 20.

697
01:14:01,169 --> 01:14:05,173
- Perhaps you'd like to see over her?
- Yes, I would very much.

698
01:14:05,257 --> 01:14:07,968
- Lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.

699
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,846
Come along, Mr. Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.

700
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:13,181
Domino, I was just thinking.

701
01:14:13,265 --> 01:14:16,727
As I'll be busy this evening,
perhaps Mr. Bond will be kind enough...

702
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:20,314
to take you to the Jankanoo,
our local Mardi Gras.

703
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,316
You'll be my guest tonight.

704
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,693
- That's very kind of you.
- It will be my pleasure.

705
01:14:34,453 --> 01:14:36,997
Our Mr. Bond must have
a very high opinion of himself.

706
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,290
Opinion?

707
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:41,919
Yes. He has a date with me too.

708
01:14:45,297 --> 01:14:46,632
Excuse me.

709
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,943
- Let me go!
- Over here.

710
01:15:09,196 --> 01:15:12,241
Don't let her make so much noise.
Use the chloroform.

711
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:46,942
Largo did promise
he'd come, didn't he?

712
01:15:47,985 --> 01:15:50,779
He'll be here. Don't worry.

713
01:15:50,862 --> 01:15:53,282
I think that man is waving at you.

714
01:15:53,365 --> 01:15:54,866
Come down here.

715
01:15:56,368 --> 01:15:57,786
Quick!

716
01:15:59,329 --> 01:16:01,707
Excuse me for a second.

717
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,378
- James, Paula's gone!
- What do you mean, gone?

718
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,380
She just checked out of the hotel.

719
01:16:09,673 --> 01:16:11,633
You look after Domino. Watch her.

720
01:16:11,675 --> 01:16:15,012
- Do you think she was onto something?
- I don't know, but I gotta find out.

721
01:16:15,095 --> 01:16:17,014
- You watch out for her.
- Right.

722
01:16:17,097 --> 01:16:19,016
All right. Thank you.

723
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,893
The governor's not very happy,
but you'll have...

724
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:24,187
a power cut as requested
all over the island.

725
01:16:24,271 --> 01:16:26,273
I don't give a damn
about the rest of the island.

726
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,775
- I want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.

727
01:16:58,138 --> 01:17:00,223
What do you mean, she won't talk?

728
01:17:00,307 --> 01:17:02,559
Don't worry, she will.

729
01:17:02,643 --> 01:17:04,561
What's wrong?

730
01:17:09,608 --> 01:17:12,110
- Is it a power failure?
- Yes, all over the island.

731
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:14,988
Switch over
to the emergency generator.

732
01:17:52,568 --> 01:17:54,528
Largo told you to be careful.

733
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:58,323
I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.

734
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:01,201
A capsule in the mouth.
What do you think, cyanide?

735
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,497
She's dead.

736
01:18:22,222 --> 01:18:24,141
Ricardo, someone's got him!

737
01:18:32,357 --> 01:18:34,776
Search that way!
And you, the shark pool!

738
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,491
- What happened?
- I don't know.

739
01:18:41,575 --> 01:18:43,368
Leave him! This way!

740
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,376
Stop it!

741
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:55,088
You fools! He's got
you all shooting at each other!

742
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,184
Over here!

743
01:19:40,217 --> 01:19:42,552
No! I've got a better idea.

744
01:20:00,487 --> 01:20:03,031
Lift the tunnel hatch
and let them eat.

745
01:20:03,115 --> 01:20:04,533
Yes, sir.

746
01:21:16,772 --> 01:21:19,441
Sorry, old chap.
Better luck next time.

747
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:29,952
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.
I'll get back to him as soon as I can.

748
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:32,496
- Anything else?
- Tell him Paula's dead.

749
01:22:13,954 --> 01:22:15,872
Aren't you in the wrong room?

750
01:22:16,999 --> 01:22:19,251
Not from where I'm standing.

751
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:23,213
Since you're here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?

752
01:22:39,646 --> 01:22:41,899
Anyway, I'm very glad to see you again.

753
01:22:41,982 --> 01:22:44,276
I'm glad to see you again.

754
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,820
I had the feeling
you've been avoiding me.

755
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:50,407
I had no idea that
we were next-door neighbors.

756
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:52,910
They just moved me down
this afternoon.

757
01:22:52,993 --> 01:22:55,746
It's extraordinary, isn't it?
Almost as if...

758
01:22:55,829 --> 01:22:57,915
As if it was intended.

759
01:22:57,998 --> 01:23:01,043
Yes, it is extraordinary.

760
01:23:01,126 --> 01:23:03,795
Shouldn't you get out
of those wet clothes?

761
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:06,840
You'll catch your death of cold.

762
01:23:14,139 --> 01:23:16,892
Look, you know
we're going to be too late.

763
01:23:16,934 --> 01:23:19,811
- Too late for what?
- The Jankanoo.

764
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:22,231
I promised my friends
I'd meet them there.

765
01:23:22,272 --> 01:23:24,733
Perhaps you know them, the Largos.

766
01:23:26,109 --> 01:23:29,238
Questions. All I get is questions.

767
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:31,990
But the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow.

768
01:23:32,074 --> 01:23:35,911
Enough to drive you wild.
Do you like wild things?

769
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:42,584
Wild. You should be
locked up in a cage.

770
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,884
This bed feels like a cage.

771
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:53,053
All these bars.

772
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:56,974
Do you think I'll be safe?

773
01:24:08,235 --> 01:24:12,072
You made a shocking mess out of
my hair, you sadistic brute.

774
01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:14,575
Will you zip me up, please?

775
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,080
No wonder you can
get dressed so quickly.

776
01:24:20,163 --> 01:24:22,666
On the way, we can have a little talk.

777
01:24:22,749 --> 01:24:26,128
You may find it interesting. Come on.

778
01:24:26,169 --> 01:24:27,629
I'm coming.

779
01:24:27,713 --> 01:24:29,715
I hate to think
I'm gonna miss anything.

780
01:24:33,218 --> 01:24:35,971
And now we can go somewhere
for an interesting talk.

781
01:24:36,054 --> 01:24:39,182
Friends of yours, no doubt. Come in.

782
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:44,396
You dress quickly too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.

783
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:49,902
Not that it matters, but that
was under the pillow all the time.

784
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:54,364
When did you find out?

785
01:24:54,448 --> 01:24:56,992
You're wearing the same ring
as Largo.

786
01:24:58,619 --> 01:25:01,580
- It's a ring I like to wear.
- Then it has its dangers.

787
01:25:02,456 --> 01:25:04,333
Vanity, Mr. Bond.

788
01:25:04,374 --> 01:25:07,336
- It's something you know so much about.
- My dear girl.

789
01:25:07,419 --> 01:25:11,089
Don't flatter yourself. What I did
this evening was for King and Country.

790
01:25:11,173 --> 01:25:14,176
You don't think it gave me
any pleasure, do you?

791
01:25:19,389 --> 01:25:21,433
But of course.
I forgot your ego.

792
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:25,437
James Bond, who only has
to make love to a woman...

793
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,357
and she starts to hear
heavenly choirs singing.

794
01:25:28,398 --> 01:25:32,694
She repents and immediately returns
to the side of right and virtue.

795
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:36,323
But not this one.

796
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:42,537
What a blow it must have been,
you having a failure.

797
01:25:42,621 --> 01:25:45,707
Well, you can't win them all.

798
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:49,670
We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.

799
01:25:49,753 --> 01:25:51,713
Careful, Mr. Bond.

800
01:26:08,397 --> 01:26:09,856
Now what?

801
01:26:12,818 --> 01:26:17,114
Get through to Palmyra and tell them
we've been held up by the Jankanoo.

802
01:26:17,197 --> 01:26:19,199
- Like to have a drink, man?
- Get him away!

803
01:26:19,241 --> 01:26:21,368
- Don't you try anything now.
- Get out of here!

804
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,871
- It's real firewater.
- Get out of here!

805
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,173
After him! Get him!

806
01:26:52,107 --> 01:26:54,192
You haven't seen anything?

807
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:55,944
Look!

808
01:26:56,028 --> 01:26:59,239
Follow him. You that side, you there.

809
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,095
Stay with us.

810
01:30:01,964 --> 01:30:04,091
- Thank you, I'd love to.
- Love to what?

811
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:11,807
- You're mad. Do you know that?
- Yes. Isn't everyone?

812
01:30:15,561 --> 01:30:17,479
May I cut in?

813
01:30:17,563 --> 01:30:19,606
You should have told me
your wife was here.

814
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,203
Do you come here often?

815
01:30:33,287 --> 01:30:36,915
It's no good trying to escape.

816
01:30:36,999 --> 01:30:38,917
I don't want to escape.

817
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:44,256
Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.

818
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:58,437
Why don't you come with us quietly?

819
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,024
You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.

820
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:45,025
Do you mind if my friend
sits this one out? She's just dead.

821
01:31:55,744 --> 01:32:00,582
You'll leave here at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.

822
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:03,252
You will then proceed
to the Megui Archipelago...

823
01:32:03,335 --> 01:32:06,004
to make your drop precisely at...

824
01:32:06,088 --> 01:32:08,882
<i>20 degrees north,
60 degrees east.</i>

825
01:32:08,924 --> 01:32:11,426
<i>The diamonds will be
in a special container.</i>

826
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:13,553
I hate to give in like this.

827
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:16,431
Paying the blood money,
letting them beat us.

828
01:32:16,473 --> 01:32:19,560
- Have you an alternative suggestion?
- I'm afraid I haven't.

829
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:22,604
Your man, 007,
I thought he was on to something.

830
01:32:22,688 --> 01:32:24,815
- I thought so too, sir.
- False alarm?

831
01:32:24,898 --> 01:32:26,817
- I'm afraid so.
- He obviously has...

832
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:29,486
a highly developed sense of,
shall we say, drama?

833
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:31,822
If 007 thought
he was on to something...

834
01:32:31,905 --> 01:32:34,783
It's a great pity he didn't make sure
before he started to shout the odds.

835
01:32:34,825 --> 01:32:37,619
Well, we have exactly
14 hours and 50 minutes.

836
01:32:37,703 --> 01:32:41,748
Then I suppose we shall have to pay up
and look as happy as we can. Shan't we?

837
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:22,122
Well, that's it, James.
We've looked about everywhere.

838
01:33:22,164 --> 01:33:25,000
We've got to find that plane.

839
01:33:26,585 --> 01:33:29,796
You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.

840
01:33:31,423 --> 01:33:34,509
- Golden Grotto?
- Yeah. All you'll find...

841
01:33:34,593 --> 01:33:36,511
down there are sharks.

842
01:33:37,596 --> 01:33:39,806
Take her down. I want a closer look.

843
01:33:39,848 --> 01:33:42,184
- At what?
- Never mind! Take her down, quick!

844
01:33:49,524 --> 01:33:51,652
Set her down.
I think we've found it.

845
01:34:03,705 --> 01:34:07,709
There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.

846
01:34:07,793 --> 01:34:11,046
Shoot one of those sharks.
It'll keep the others occupied.

847
01:34:21,056 --> 01:34:24,393
I don't know how long the others
will take before they finish him off...

848
01:34:24,476 --> 01:34:26,603
- but they'll be back.
- I'll keep an eye on them.

849
01:34:26,687 --> 01:34:28,146
Good.

850
01:36:39,653 --> 01:36:42,072
- She's down there, all right.
- Are the bombs on board?

851
01:36:42,155 --> 01:36:45,409
- No.
- Great. What's our next move?

852
01:36:45,492 --> 01:36:47,411
<i>We'll check on the Disco Volante.</i>

853
01:36:47,494 --> 01:36:49,580
If the bombs aren't aboard her now,
they soon will be.

854
01:36:49,663 --> 01:36:52,165
Who are you going to ask, Largo?

855
01:36:52,249 --> 01:36:55,335
No, I don't think we'll have to.

856
01:37:49,181 --> 01:37:51,225
I hope we didn't frighten the fish.

857
01:37:54,102 --> 01:37:58,315
Ow! Sea egg spines.
They're poisonous!

858
01:37:58,398 --> 01:38:01,068
Here, give me your arm.

859
01:38:03,403 --> 01:38:04,863
Sit down.

860
01:38:06,531 --> 01:38:08,450
Now turn over.

861
01:38:10,953 --> 01:38:12,913
This is going to hurt a bit.

862
01:38:22,297 --> 01:38:24,549
It's the first time I've
tasted women. They're rather good.

863
01:38:24,633 --> 01:38:27,302
You're the only man
to ever make me cry.

864
01:38:27,386 --> 01:38:30,556
Except perhaps Francois,
my brother, when we were children.

865
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,559
Domino, I have to tell you something.

866
01:38:35,394 --> 01:38:39,189
I'm sorry, James. I didn't mean
to embarrass you, speaking of love.

867
01:38:39,273 --> 01:38:42,859
- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away?

868
01:38:42,943 --> 01:38:45,821
So sorry, my dear, but it's all over.

869
01:38:45,862 --> 01:38:47,823
No, it's about your brother.

870
01:38:47,864 --> 01:38:49,825
What about him?

871
01:39:15,851 --> 01:39:17,269
He's dead.

872
01:39:21,523 --> 01:39:23,025
What happened?

873
01:39:23,108 --> 01:39:27,821
It's a long story,
and it involves your friend Largo.

874
01:39:39,041 --> 01:39:41,376
I need your help.

875
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,712
Of course.

876
01:39:43,795 --> 01:39:45,714
That's why you made love to me.

877
01:39:45,797 --> 01:39:48,550
Look, I can't explain
what this is all about.

878
01:39:48,634 --> 01:39:51,762
- But you must trust me.
- Because you want me to help you?

879
01:39:51,845 --> 01:39:54,514
Largo had your brother murdered,
or it was on his orders.

880
01:39:54,556 --> 01:39:58,018
Hundreds of thousands of people
will die very soon...

881
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:00,854
if you don't help me.

882
01:40:04,733 --> 01:40:07,778
That much we do know,
but there's something we don't...

883
01:40:07,861 --> 01:40:11,323
<i>The bombs, when they're being loaded
aboard the Disco Volante.</i>

884
01:40:11,406 --> 01:40:14,326
- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.

885
01:40:16,787 --> 01:40:19,748
It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.

886
01:40:19,831 --> 01:40:22,334
What can he do to me
he hasn't already done?

887
01:40:22,417 --> 01:40:24,211
Then you'll do it?

888
01:40:26,463 --> 01:40:28,006
- Yes.
- Good.

889
01:40:29,383 --> 01:40:32,261
This is a Geiger counter.
You press this lever.

890
01:40:32,344 --> 01:40:34,471
If it starts clicking,
it means the bombs are aboard.

891
01:40:35,556 --> 01:40:37,975
- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.

892
01:40:38,058 --> 01:40:41,019
<i>As the Disco Volante is being watched,
you'll be spotted.</i>

893
01:40:41,103 --> 01:40:42,604
Vargas, behind you.

894
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:46,733
Really?

895
01:40:48,443 --> 01:40:51,154
He must have followed us.

896
01:40:55,867 --> 01:40:57,786
I think he got the point.

897
01:40:57,869 --> 01:41:00,414
It should have been Largo.

898
01:41:00,455 --> 01:41:03,375
Largo? When did he expect you back?

899
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:07,296
Very soon now. He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.

900
01:41:08,797 --> 01:41:11,592
You better go straight back. I'll take
care of Vargas and everything here.

901
01:41:11,633 --> 01:41:15,637
Understand I'm doing this for
my brother, for what he did to him.

902
01:41:15,721 --> 01:41:19,057
But promise you will kill Largo
for me, whatever happens.

903
01:41:24,146 --> 01:41:26,106
- We haven't much time.
- All right.

904
01:41:26,148 --> 01:41:29,109
Oh, something I remembered.
It may not be important.

905
01:41:29,151 --> 01:41:31,486
- Tell me. Everything's important.
- There's a small bridge over the canal.

906
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:34,781
Largo never allows strangers
to go near it.

907
01:41:34,823 --> 01:41:36,992
By the canal there's a flight of steps.

908
01:41:37,075 --> 01:41:39,286
- Where do they lead to?
- Down into the sea...

909
01:41:39,328 --> 01:41:41,538
on the far side of Palmyra.

910
01:41:41,622 --> 01:41:44,041
Perhaps it is important after all.

911
01:43:14,923 --> 01:43:17,092
Put on your equipment.

912
01:43:34,109 --> 01:43:36,403
<i>Did we get a message saying the girl
went on board the Disco?</i>

913
01:43:36,445 --> 01:43:38,530
Yes, sir. Signal received at...

914
01:43:38,614 --> 01:43:41,366
- If she is on board, where is 007 now?
- That's the question.

915
01:43:44,369 --> 01:43:47,122
Stand by. Five seconds.

916
01:43:47,205 --> 01:43:49,416
Watch my signal.

917
01:44:33,961 --> 01:44:37,047
- Prepare to get underway.
- Aye, aye, sir.

918
01:44:40,467 --> 01:44:42,761
Captain, weigh anchor.

919
01:44:42,844 --> 01:44:45,180
Get underway immediately.

920
01:44:45,222 --> 01:44:49,059
Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.

921
01:44:57,609 --> 01:44:59,528
<i>The Disco Volante's leaving, sir.</i>

922
01:49:08,443 --> 01:49:11,238
- I told you to stay in your cabin.
- It's stuffy in there.

923
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:14,491
- I want a breath of air.
- My dear, did you not hear me?

924
01:49:14,575 --> 01:49:16,493
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.

925
01:49:16,577 --> 01:49:19,663
- Let me see.
- No. Why should I?

926
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:30,257
Mr. Bond gave you this little toy,
I imagine, and Vargas is dead.

927
01:49:34,469 --> 01:49:36,847
No, my dear.
There is no escape for you.

928
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:39,558
Like your friend,
you've been a little too clever.

929
01:49:39,641 --> 01:49:41,518
And now you are caught!

930
01:50:29,358 --> 01:50:33,111
You have given me
much pleasure, Domino.

931
01:50:33,195 --> 01:50:37,324
But in return, unless you tell me
how much Bond knows...

932
01:50:37,366 --> 01:50:40,285
I'll be forced to cause you great pain.

933
01:50:40,369 --> 01:50:44,289
This for heat, these for cold.

934
01:50:44,373 --> 01:50:48,502
Applied scientifically and slowly.

935
01:50:48,543 --> 01:50:51,380
Very, very slowly.

936
01:51:02,057 --> 01:51:04,977
- What do you want?
- We're activating the bombs.

937
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:07,396
- You said you wanted to be told.
- Oh, yes.

938
01:51:09,356 --> 01:51:13,318
A private little matter between
the young woman and myself.

939
01:51:13,402 --> 01:51:15,362
Go!

940
01:51:15,404 --> 01:51:19,700
Do not live in hope, my dear.
There is no one to rescue you.

941
01:51:34,881 --> 01:51:36,466
Now go on!

942
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:39,386
It's a good thing
the homing capsule he swallowed...

943
01:51:39,428 --> 01:51:40,679
is still working.

944
01:51:40,762 --> 01:51:41,930
Straight ahead.

945
01:51:47,436 --> 01:51:49,563
Go right.

946
01:52:10,709 --> 01:52:12,628
That's him!

947
01:52:28,143 --> 01:52:29,770
Hold it!

948
01:52:39,655 --> 01:52:41,198
Up.

949
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:58,924
Get your radio man
on to Orlando Beach.

950
01:52:59,007 --> 01:53:01,426
Warn them the target is Miami.

951
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:04,555
<i>Also, the bomb is transferred
from the Disco Volante...</i>

952
01:53:04,638 --> 01:53:06,848
onto a wreck off Fowley Point.

953
01:53:06,932 --> 01:53:08,850
Right. Hang on to that.

954
01:55:57,728 --> 01:55:59,730
And the kitchen sink.

955
01:55:59,813 --> 01:56:02,441
On you, everything looks good.

956
01:56:02,524 --> 01:56:04,443
Take this.

957
01:56:09,489 --> 01:56:11,408
Good luck.

958
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:18,126
- Weigh anchor!
- Aye, aye, sir.

959
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:49,074
- Make smoke.
- Making smoke now.

960
02:03:56,248 --> 02:03:59,835
- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.

961
02:04:03,547 --> 02:04:05,716
Jettison cocoon.

962
02:04:12,848 --> 02:04:14,683
Cocoon's away.

963
02:04:27,446 --> 02:04:30,574
Keep firing! They're closing!

964
02:04:50,052 --> 02:04:52,304
Fire more, more!

965
02:05:05,525 --> 02:05:07,986
Wait a minute.

966
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:10,656
We've still got one bomb aboard.

967
02:05:10,739 --> 02:05:15,369
He's gone mad!
Please talk to them for me.

968
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:18,956
Tell them that I only did what
I had to do, what I was told to do.

969
02:05:31,843 --> 02:05:35,722
- Where is he?
- The bomb cannot be exploded now.

970
02:05:35,806 --> 02:05:37,808
I threw the arming device
into the sea.

971
02:05:37,891 --> 02:05:39,810
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

972
02:05:48,777 --> 02:05:50,320
Get him!

973
02:07:34,841 --> 02:07:38,595
- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad?

974
02:07:38,679 --> 02:07:41,098
- Who's he?
- I don't know, but he helped me.

975
02:07:42,599 --> 02:07:45,686
- Look out! The rocks!
- The reef!

976
02:07:47,604 --> 02:07:49,898
He's jammed the controls!
Come on!

977
02:07:49,982 --> 02:07:51,900
- Come on, now, jump!
- I never learned to swim!

978
02:07:51,984 --> 02:07:54,194
Never too late to learn.

979
02:07:57,197 --> 02:07:59,366
Get down!

980
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:26,310
Up.
