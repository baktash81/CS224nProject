1
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,992
I told him, "Donald...

2
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,658
I have to attend.
It's my ball."

3
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,267
And then he said:

4
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:14,432
"The lodge
only throws their ball
once every decade.

5
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,442
Why can't you ever
attend my balls?"

6
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,106
And I said, "Jesus Christ,
Donald, that's what
I've been doing for 30 years."

7
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,379
You're such an idiot.

8
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,352
Gov. Dalton,
this is Jared Svenning...

9
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,826
the gentleman
to whom you are presenting
the honorarium.

10
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,261
Governor, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

11
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,891
Might I add,
you're absolutely stunning
this evening?

12
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,427
You can dispense
with the ass-munching.

13
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,529
You're getting your check.

14
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,672
Thank you. Thank you.

15
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,372
The grant, that is,
will go a long way...

16
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,406
towards funding
the new programming
that I'm working on for KREL.

17
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,916
That's the
public access station, right?

18
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,615
The one they run
the lottery numbers on?

19
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,488
Well, we air more
than just lottery numbers.

20
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,220
I mean, in fact...

21
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,654
we're going to broadcast
a live game show from
a local mall this Saturday.

22
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,028
How long is this thing
going to take?

23
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,128
Tonight I've got
<i>Melrose</i> at 9:00.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,002
Well, there's dinner,
followed by
the presentation.

25
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,013
And then we adjourn
into the auditorium
for a stage presentation...

26
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,913
by the Drama
and History Clubs.

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,647
They put together
an impressive musical
about Paul Revere...

28
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,155
entitled
<i>Light Your Own Lamps.</i>

29
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,191
Is there a dance number?

30
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:45,055
Nothing better than
a couple of skimpily clad
undergraduates...

31
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,931
just hurling themselves
across the stage,
I always say.

32
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,994
Get me another highball.
Right away, Governor.

33
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,700
Will you stop?
Stop it! Cut it out!

34
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:01,302
Just don't eyeball everyone
like that. All you're doing
is creeping everyone out.

35
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,480
Sorry, Governor.

36
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,883
Sven, you know
these security types...

37
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,415
everyone a glory hound,
I always say.

38
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,361
They're all just waiting
to tackle
the next Sirhan Sirhan.

39
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,999
I mean, I ask you...

40
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:27,339
Can you imagine anyone
wanting to attack me,
for Christ's sake?

41
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,139
Freeze!

42
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,312
What are you doing?
You looking at naked guys
in the shower again?

43
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,155
Didn't anyone ever tell you
not to point guns at people?

44
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,024
Once. I shot him.

45
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,524
Nice sneakers.

46
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,497
I went to look for you
in your room...

47
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,472
and Ronnie told me
I could find you up here.

48
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,666
What gives?

49
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,040
I wanted to finish
that paper on supernovas...

50
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,409
and John Slas said that
I could use his telescope...

51
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,311
before he went home
for break.

52
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,543
What do you need his for?
You got your own.

53
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,882
No, I got the lenses, T.S.,
but I need Slas' shaft.

54
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,378
Oh.

55
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,615
You need Slas' shaft, huh?

56
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,989
You insatiable slut!

57
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,429
"We're all in the gutter,
but some of us
are looking at the stars."

58
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,830
Oscar Wilde.

59
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,495
I thought that you'd be
down there trying to secure
the best seat in the house.

60
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,870
This might be the first
and last time you ever see
your boyfriend on stage...

61
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,909
especially in a musical.

62
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,146
So I'd like you
to be down there
front row, up center.

63
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,546
I'm gonna watch you
from up here.

64
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,952
With that thing?
You'll never see me.

65
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,648
Are you kidding?
Do you have any idea
how powerful this thing is?

66
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,022
I'll be able to see
the flop sweat
form on your brow.

67
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,654
Yeah, but you won't be able
to hear me sing.

68
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,889
Bingo.

69
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,858
Strident.

70
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:38,097
I'm gonna have to
teach you a lesson about
being demure for your man.

71
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,502
In fact...

72
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,507
that's it.
I'm having sex with you
right here, right now.

73
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,564
What are you doing?

74
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,167
Let's go, come on.
Pull them down.

75
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,041
Would you get off me?
I've got work to do.

76
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,102
I don't mind.

77
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,012
I'll just let you finish
your star gazing.

78
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,345
I'll take you
from behind here.

79
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,909
It'll be great practice
for when we get older, and you
watch TV while we screw.

80
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,614
Will you get off me?

81
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,020
All right.

82
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,787
For now. But when
we get to Florida in...

83
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,787
about approximately 17 hours,
you owe me.

84
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,694
About that...

85
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,364
Yes?

86
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,801
Well, I can't go.

87
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,334
Excuse me?

88
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,075
My dad's asked me
to help him with his new show.

89
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,208
What, like
his assistant or...

90
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,751
As a contestant.

91
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,582
You mean that
<i>Dating Game</i> rip-off thing?

92
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,918
That is what
you're talking about here,
right?

93
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,822
That guy knows no shame.

94
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,056
What, so he forbid you
to go to Florida
when you said no, is that it?

95
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,257
I can't believe...

96
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,928
Brandi?

97
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,699
You didn't say no?

98
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,174
T.S., it's no big deal.
I mean, it's just TV.

99
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,178
Besides,
it is really important
for my father's career.

100
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,510
Otherwise,
he would never have asked me.

101
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,446
Brandi, the guy hates me,
for Christ's sake.

102
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,951
Don't you think
that might be a little part
of the motive here?

103
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,043
He'd love to see us break up.

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,554
He'd love for us
not to go on that vacation,
that's for sure.

105
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,648
What did you think,
for Christ's sake?

106
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,352
Jesus! You know,
for a science major...

107
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,225
you can be really
fucking stupid sometimes.

108
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,162
I was giving you
the benefit of the doubt, T.S.

109
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,901
I thought that you
might be able to handle this
like an adult...

110
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,533
and show my father
how wrong he is
about our relationship.

111
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,677
Well, I guess
I credited you with too much.

112
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,680
You are just as thoughtless
and possessive as he is.

113
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,841
You both see me as property.

114
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,974
In fact...

115
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,315
the two of you
have so much in common...

116
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,821
you should just go
date each other.

117
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,524
Brandi, wait!

118
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,719
Just leave me alone.
Please.

119
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,126
Oh, no. The gun's caught
in your hair.

120
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,188
Would you get it out?
I'm trying.

121
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,391
Mr. Svenning...

122
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,333
Jesus Christ!
Don't kill me!

123
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,133
Oh, no! No, no.
For God's sake!

124
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,867
He's with me.
He's with me.

125
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,502
Oh, God!
He's one of my people.
It's okay.

126
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:03,646
We'll be ready in five,
Mr. Svenning.

127
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,373
Go, it's okay.

128
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,679
No, your hair's caught
around the trigger here.
Stop moving.

129
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,881
Would you just get it off?
It hurts.

130
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:15,121
The presentation will begin
in about five minutes,
Governor.

131
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,627
Why not freshen up a bit?

132
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,687
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

133
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,527
That I look like
a piece of shit or something?

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,091
Maybe we can jar it loose.
Here, come over here
to the right.

135
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,193
Here, lean over here.

136
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,137
Come over here, okay?
All right? Ready?

137
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,867
Sniper!

138
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,442
Oh, shit!

139
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,475
How many are there?

140
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,885
I spotted two,
a male and a female.

141
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,549
What kind of artillery?
Perps were using a shotgun.

142
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,651
Was the Governor hit?
Of course I'm hit,
you asshole.

143
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,753
You hit me like some
goddamn wrestler.

144
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,321
There's no blood.
She wasn't attacked.

145
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,833
Get your foot off my tit!
Oh, sorry, ma'am.

146
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,699
Mr. Svenning, I quit!

147
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,067
Hey, I think
they're trying
to signal us.

148
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,670
It's okay, we're not armed.

149
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,442
This is just a prop.
I'm in the musical.

150
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,344
It's just a blank.
It wasn't serious.

151
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,851
What did he say?
I think he said
they were Syrians.

152
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,478
Sweet Christ,
terrorists on our campus?

153
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,716
Why is he dressed like
a Revolutionary
War minuteman?

154
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,987
For irony! Your average
terrorist's a showman first,
killer second.

155
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,551
My God!
It's a member of
the History Club.

156
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,688
I blame the parents.
It's the parents at blame.

157
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,962
They are not
raising their children
properly these days.

158
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,595
Is Jared Svenning down there?

159
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,138
<i></i>

160
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,263
Hey.

161
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,764
That's you, isn't it?

162
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,934
No. Well, yes...

163
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,808
but, I mean,
how would a terrorist
know me?

164
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,106
Daddy? It's me, Brandi.

165
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,679
That explains it.

166
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,987
Governor, please.

167
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,891
I want to apologize
for this fiasco. My daughter
is a huge fan of your work.

168
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,225
Svenning.

169
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,130
Your check.

170
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,528
Oh, I don't know what to say,
but thank you.

171
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,473
You want money
for your pissant station.

172
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,272
Just try playing the lottery.

173
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,767
No!

174
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,178
You know
where they air those results.

175
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,446
Get me
to the goddamned hospital.

176
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,079
Now!

177
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,989
God damn,
I fractured my collarbone.

178
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,826
Mr. Svenning,
Mr. Svenning, look,
I want to apologize.

179
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,369
Thank you
for squaring everything
with the police.

180
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:42,339
I know we probably
worried you, but Brandi and I
are both okay. We...

181
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,538
If it wouldn't mean
implicating my daughter
in this somehow...

182
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,047
I would insist
that the authorities
lock you up...

183
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,777
for the rest of
your young life,
you goddamned little menace!

184
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,216
Sir, it was an accident,
I swear!

185
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,378
No, you're the accident,
you moron!

186
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,617
You have no idea
what you just cost me
here today.

187
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,792
I mean, you're like
all the other
spoiled jerks...

188
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,226
I've ever known
in my whole life!

189
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,696
Everything is handed to you
on a silver platter.

190
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,594
You people,
you just don't grasp
the precept...

191
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,104
of somebody
who has to work
for their breaks.

192
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,037
That's "concept."
What?

193
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,509
You said "precept,"
I think you meant to say...

194
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,569
"concept."
Listen to me,
you little prick, you.

195
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,515
You may have
my daughter snowed...

196
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:28,019
but it'll be
a cold day in hell before you
pull the wool over my eyes.

197
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,154
What you just did to me
here tonight...

198
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,952
I'm going to make it
my missión in life...

199
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,926
to do to you
on a regular basis.

200
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,252
Mmm!

201
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,765
Nobody fucks with
Jared Svenning's career...

202
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,630
and walks away clean.

203
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,064
I promise you that.

204
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,611
Hey man, I just want
to tell you that I really dug
what you did up there.

205
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,970
Anarchy rules, dude!

206
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,478
We're over, T.S.
Oh, come on!

207
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,544
I thought we weren't going
through this break-up,
make-up shit anymore.

208
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,714
No, we're not.
So you can just forget
about making up.

209
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,985
Listen to you.
Why don't you just admit it?
Admit what?

210
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,118
That this isn't about
just what happened
on the roof.

211
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,789
You're using that as an excuse
'cause you
don't have the guts...

212
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,422
to stand up to your father.
Maybe I don't.

213
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,262
Come on, Brandi.
What about Florida?

214
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,667
You have just humiliated me
in front of
the entire school...

215
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,763
the community, the nation,
for God's sakes.

216
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,808
You seriously damaged
my father's career...

217
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,503
you insult me with that
good-cop bad-cop routine...

218
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,207
and now you have the gall
to ask me if I still want to
go on vacation.

219
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,479
I was going to propose to you
in Florida.

220
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,484
I thought that
you'd screwed up in every way
possible tonight, T.S.

221
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,254
Guess I underestimated you.

222
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,725
Shit!

223
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,532


224
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,912


225
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,516
Sweet fucking Christ,
would you knock it off?

226
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,856
God!
What?

227
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,138
What time is it?
9:30.

228
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,237
Man, go back to sleep!

229
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,051
Thank Christ.

230
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,881
What the hell are you doing?
Finishing my game.

231
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,825
No. You promised me
breakfast.
Breakfast!

232
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,357
Breakfast, shmeckfast.
Look at the score,
for God's sake.

233
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,696
I'm only in the middle
of the second
and I'm winning 12 to 2.

234
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,962
Breakfasts come and go, Rene.

235
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,901
Now Hartford, the Whale?

236
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,601
They only beat Vancouver once,
maybe twice, in a lifetime.

237
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,769
<i></i>

238
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,482
You hit the bathroom already?

239
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,485
Don't worry. I didn't let
your mother see me.

240
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,145
Who's worried?
Are you kidding me?

241
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,816
I've never met a person
who lives in as much fear
of his mother as you do.

242
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,153
I do not.

243
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,151
So that's why
I have to sneak in here...

244
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,288
after everyone's
asleep at night and sneak out
undetected in the morning?

245
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,163
You want
I should tell my mother
what we do in here at night?

246
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,032
That you play videogames
and I fall asleep unfulfilled?

247
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,902
Go ahead. It beats
the sneaking-around shit.

248
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,498
What can I say?
She doesn't like you.

249
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,144
You've never even
introduced me
to her, Brodie.

250
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,304
She wouldn't like you.

251
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,281
You're retarded.
Everybody's mother
likes me.

252
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,811
Not mine.

253
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,447
Jesus Christ!
Are you back
in the bathroom again?

254
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,787
What do you do in there
all the time?

255
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,554
Figure it out.

256
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,195
No, I mean like before.
Like every morning
before you leave...

257
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,630
you're in there for like
a half an hour and all
I ever hear is water running.

258
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,758
And?

259
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,228
You're not in there
touching yourself, are you?

260
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,563
I was wrong about you.
You're crass and retarded.

261
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,739
What do you do in there?

262
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,403
You really want to know?

263
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,676
I asked, didn't I?
I'm playing the role
of the concerned guy.

264
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:31,909
I cry.

265
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,615
You cry?
I cry.

266
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,249
Any particular reason?

267
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,984
Hey.

268
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,120
I think about the people
that make decisions
that affect our lives.

269
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,562
The doctors
who make advancements
in curing diseases.

270
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,595
The engineer
that designs skyscrapers.

271
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,739
The guy that maps out
a plane's flight path.
The navigator.

272
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,504
I think about how those people
are out there every day...

273
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,307
making a difference,
leading big lives...

274
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,143
And how they refuse
to be intimidated...

275
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,117
by the tremendous odds
of failure they face.

276
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,911
And how they only
concern themselves with peers
and company that apply...

277
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,547
to their goals
and noble causes.

278
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:16,958
Jesus! I'd hate to tell you
what I think about
when I'm in the bathroom.

279
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,496
I think about all that
and I cry...

280
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,696
Because I have
nothing better to do
than fuck you.

281
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,107
You're dumping me?

282
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,246
What are you, crazy?

283
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,120
Is this because
I didn't introduce you
to my mother?

284
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,337
Holy shit!
If it isn't <i>mon frère.</i>

285
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,977
Last time I saw you,
you were on CNN taking shots
at public officials.

286
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,922
Mr. Quint. Mr. Quint.

287
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,418
Move!

288
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,255
Mr. Quint. Mr. Quint.

289
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,724
So you're looking
for sanctuary.

290
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,166
It's been like this
all morning.

291
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,830
Can you blame them
after the spectacle
you made of yourself?

292
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,272
What were you trying to do,
anyway? Lmpress Jodie Foster?

293
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,004
I wasn't gunning for
the Governor, Brodie. It was
a stupid misunderstanding.

294
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,046
Ah. Now you're crying
patsy...

295
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,207
thus demonstrating
all the key characteristics...

296
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,183
of a lone nut assassin.

297
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,725
Usual vault rules apply:
Touch not,
lest ye be touched.

298
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,855
You're such an
anal-retentive bastard.

299
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,330
I tried to teach you
how to handle comics
in the sixth grade, but no...

300
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,129
you wanted to play
Little League instead.

301
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,102
What's that?
Like it? I framed it
before you got here.

302
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,537
Oh, my God! Rene dumped you!

303
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,703
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned for Sega.

304
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,077
What's that mean?
You had to be there.
Just keep reading.

305
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,050
Wow! Look at this laundry list
of complaints.

306
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,679
You have no direction,
no college ambition,
no job prospects.

307
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,689
Yeah. It also says
I have no dick.

308
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:29,158
But you'll notice that follows
the financial question,
proving once more...

309
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,059
what women really look for.

310
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,653
What do you do for money,
anyway?

311
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,360
Blood bank, sperm bank,
currently considering
the eye bank.

312
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,060
Wow, she calls you callow
in here.
You say that like it's bad.

313
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,198
It means frightened
and weak-willed.
Really?

314
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,676
Shit. That was
the only part of the letter
I thought was complimentary.

315
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,739
Yeah, well, you're lucky.

316
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:56,049
Unlike you, I didn't even
get a letter filled with
obscure adjectives.

317
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,180
What are you telling me here?

318
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,384
I, too, now am in
the framing business.

319
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,654
Holy shit! Brandi dumped you.

320
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,354
Wait a second, aren't you two
supposed to go to Florida?

321
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,264
Should've left this morning.
It gets worse.

322
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,635
I was gonna propose to her.
Where?

323
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,568
On the Universal tour.
You're kidding! What part?

324
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,473
When Jaws
pops out of the water.

325
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,272
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

326
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,607
Too bad I'm not trying
to marry you.

327
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:30,582
Let me ask you something.
Did you ever fart
in front of her?

328
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,282
Why do you ask?

329
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,088
I never farted
in front of Rene,
not once, all right?

330
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,358
Then last week I let one slip.
Today she dumps me.

331
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,127
You think that
that's why Rene dumped you?

332
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,032
She's not
the shallow type, Brodie.

333
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,037
She was going down on me
at the time.

334
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,233
Shut up!
What can I say?
I was feeling very relaxed.

335
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,869
When I'm relaxed, I squirt.

336
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,310
If all she did was dump you,
you got off light.

337
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,643
I can't believe this shit.

338
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,650
Why are we sitting here
trying to figure out...

339
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,709
where we went wrong
with our significant others?

340
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,152
We just nailed it,
in your case.

341
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,779
No, there is something
out there...

342
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,347
that can help ease
our simultaneous double loss.

343
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,486
Ritual suicide?
No, you idiot.
The fucking mall!

344
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,529
I prefer ritual suicide.

345
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:16,158
Come on, man! It'll be great.
They got these new cookies
at the cookie stand.

346
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,395
You have to try them,
they're awesome.

347
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,597
You think
the promise of a cookie
is gonna lure me...

348
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,606
into doing something
I have zero interest in?

349
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,971
What am I, 5 years old?

350
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,205
Quint, don't be such a pussy,
all right? Just go.

351
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,776
All right, I'll tell you what.

352
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,315
We can stop off at Brandi's
if that'll make you
feel better.

353
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,443
You can talk to her,
maybe patch this thing up.

354
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,644
Mr. Quint, I'm Fred Bishop
with NBC.

355
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,021
The network would like to buy
the rights to your story...

356
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,354
to make a tasteful telepic.

357
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,928
Mr. Quint, Tom Drucker, CBS.

358
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,329
We'll pay more money
and we'll get Drew Barrymore
to play your girlfriend.

359
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,890
Hey, back off.

360
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,993
We can stop at Brandi's,
right?
Yeah.

361
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,571
Get dressed.

362
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,360


363
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,605
<i>Jazzercise?</i>
Why does your mother have
an aerobics tape in her car?

364
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,141
We lose them?

365
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,678
Not a news van in sight.

366
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,506
Damn, anyone ever tell you
you drive like the bandit?

367
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,310
Oh, shit! So much
for seeing Brandi.

368
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,811
Just ignore them and go in.

369
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,322
You kidding?
That's <i>Hard Edition.</i>
That's tabloid TV.

370
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,915
They see me here
and it's "Suburban
Bonnie and Clyde reunite...

371
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,392
to slay father
in his own home."

372
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,292
Man, I don't know
what you're crying about.

373
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,558
I'd cut one of my nuts in half
to be on TV.

374
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,497
That'd get you on this show.

375
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,899
All right, tell you what.
You go round the back...

376
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,597
I'll run interference
with the fourth estate.

377
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,663
You got my back?
Your back is got.

378
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,072
All right.

379
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,046
So what's this all about?

380
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,015
I'm Tori Metzger
from <i>Hard Edition.</i>

381
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,517
We're hoping
to get an interview
with Brandi Svenning.

382
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,111
Yeah, that's the girl
who took a shot
at the Governor.

383
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,486
The same. Do you know her?

384
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,049
Oh, I should say so.
I've lived next door to her
for 19 years.

385
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,594
Even dated her once.

386
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,563
Shit, the stories
I could tell you!
Really?

387
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,417
Satanic rituals?
All the time.

388
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,644
I remember coming over
for Christmas one year...

389
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,780
and they were celebrating
a black mass.

390
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,849
Her father had sex with a goat
right there in the den.

391
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,827
And nobody ever reported this
to the authorities?

392
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,456
Everyone around here
is paralyzed by fear.

393
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,762
Makes for
shitty block parties.

394
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,302
Could we possibly
go onto your property...

395
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,861
and get you on tape
with their backyard
behind you?

396
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,930
You want to put me on TV?

397
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,103
Shit, I'll take you
to their property...

398
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,771
if you're gonna put me
on TV. Come on!

399
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,981
I was thinking of calling you.

400
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,413
Has your dad
calmed down any?

401
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,616
Well, until this morning.

402
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:31,254
He read an article today
comparing him to the father
of James Earl Ray.

403
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,029
Can't you explain it to him?
You know it was an accident.

404
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,660
I know it wasn't planned.

405
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,261
But "accident"
is too light a term...

406
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,669
to describe
what happened, T.S.

407
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,436
Whatever. Can't we
just forget about it?

408
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,141
Look, we already
missed Florida.

409
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,839
We could be spending
this time alone together.

410
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:53,180
Away from our friends,
school, studies, everything.

411
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,112
Don't you want to
spend some time alone
with me?

412
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,189
Just to talk.

413
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:01,820
Perhaps.

414
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,422
Perhaps.

415
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,055
Or perhaps more than talk.

416
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,688
Oh.

417
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:13,564
Absolutely. I'm always one
for active non-talking.

418
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,643
Why don't you go get a pizza
with me tonight?

419
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,175
I've got the game show
tonight.

420
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,380
This is Svenning's bedroom.

421
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,679
Now, I must warn you.

422
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,585
The images that you capture,
whatever is going on
in that room...

423
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,816
may be ungodly
and horrific.

424
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,291
Take a look.

425
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,504
I can't believe that
you're still going through
with this.

426
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,736
Come on, T.S.,
it's no big deal.

427
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,904
I mean, it's not like
I'm going to sleep with them.

428
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,969
You might as well.

429
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,776
I thought you had
more backbone than this.

430
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,044
Why do you have to
do everything
that he tells you to do?

431
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,244
There you go again.

432
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,482
Just as you're making headway,
you louse it up with this...

433
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,423
possessive machismo
which brings everything
endearing about you...

434
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,084
to a screaming halt, T.S.

435
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,584
What are you doing out here?
Who are you people?

436
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,884
What are you doing
on my property?
Get out of here!

437
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,016
How do you answer
to your neighbor's charges...

438
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,855
that you practice
satanic rituals?

439
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,189
Satanic what?

440
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,890
Daddy, what are you doing
outside in a towel?

441
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,523
You did this, didn't you?

442
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,090
You trashed my fiscal year...

443
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,569
and now,
you and your crony here
egg these media vultures...

444
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,663
into thinking they can...

445
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,903
Daddy, T.S. Had nothing
to do with...

446
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,537
Mr. Svenning, look.
Whatever happened,
I assure you, I didn't...

447
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:05,913
You get your ass
off my property now! Go!

448
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:10,216
And you people,
you get the hell out of here
before I call the cops!

449
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,113
Me, too?
Now!

450
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,410
I don't know
what he's so mad about.

451
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,845
They'll digitally
erase his organ
when they air the footage.

452
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,439
Goddamn it!
What is my problem?

453
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,451
I was this close
to reconciliation
and I blew up at her.

454
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,783
And here I'm going
to the fucking mall,
of all places.

455
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,289
You know what,
as a matter of fact, I'm not.
I'm going home.

456
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,985
Look, the safest place
for you to be right now
is at the mall.

457
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,460
No press'll think
to look for you here.
Hide in plain sight.

458
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,587
Just shut up!

459
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,030
You know what,
this is all your fault
this happened anyway.

460
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,625
You and your 15 minutes
of fame.
Get a grip,
for God's sake.

461
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,828
Did you ever stop
to think...

462
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,395
that maybe the relationship
wasn't on firm ground
to begin with?

463
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,969
You know, it couldn't
have been that strong
if she breaks up with you...

464
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,606
over something stupid
like getting her shot at,
numbskull.

465
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:14,876
Hey.

466
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,860
I love the smell of commerce
in the morning!

467
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,330
You're really
making that last.
Waste not, want not.

468
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,939
What, you want to
say something?
About a million things...

469
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,168
but I can't express myself
monosyllabically enough

470
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,473
for you to understand
them all.

471
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,141
Asshole!
Prick!

472
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,078
Fuck you!
What the hell
was that all about?

473
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:48,813
He's a jerk from
Fashionable Male, this upscale
wannabe shop on the 2nd floor.

474
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,613
He's the manager.
The guy's always
giving me shit.

475
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,749
I've no idea why.
I thought everybody loved you
at this mall.

476
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,353
"F" him! Where do you
want to go first?
Back to Brandi's.

477
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:02,526
Look, Brandi is the past,
my friend.
She's behind you now.

478
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:07,769
You face forward,
or you face the possibility
of shock and damage.

479
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,874
You should learn
to heed your own advice.

480
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,845
Where the hell
did that come from?
What's going on here?

481
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,542
It looks like
a stage is being erected.

482
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,083
What is this monstrosity?
Maybe it's for
the Easter Bunny pictures.

483
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,247
Impossible!
The Easter Bunny Court is down
at the other end of the mall.

484
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,884
It's been up since two days
after Christmas.
I want answers.

485
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,860
Ask one of the workers.

486
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,197
No, there's a soul
who might know what's up.

487
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,502
Willam.

488
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,411
Willam!
Poopie trim.

489
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,910
Brodie, man,
what's going on?

490
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:54,440
What, do you work here now?
No, man.
Just hanging with T.S.

491
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,716
T.S., I saw you on TV.
I think it was on <i>Baywatch.</i>

492
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,086
CNN, Willam.

493
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,717
Oh yeah,
didn't you kill the Pope
or something?

494
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,786
I got a musket tangled
in my girlfriend's hair,
for Christ's sake.

495
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,732
What are you doing, Willam?
Looking for
the hidden picture.

496
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,633
If you stare
at these things long enough,
you're supposed to see...

497
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,399
some kind of hidden
three-dimensional picture.

498
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,908
Oh, yeah, look.
It's a sailboat.
You saw it, too? Dammit!

499
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,103
What?
I've been staring
at this thing...

500
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,807
for a week now from opening
till closing and I can't see
a goddamned thing!

501
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,613
You gotta relax your eyes.
Everyone sees this thing
except me.

502
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,085
Today's my day.
I brought a lunch
and a soda...

503
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:34,056
and I'm not gonna leave
until I see this sailboat
everyone keeps talking about.

504
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,922
So, Willam...

505
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,390
would you happen to know
what this stage business
is all about?

506
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,091
It's not a stage!

507
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,325
I'm gonna see it
if I have to go blind trying.

508
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,528
No man,
this stage over here.

509
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,703
That thing?
I think some game show
in the mall today.

510
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,732
I think it's going to
be on TV. It's called
<i>Truth or Date</i> or something.

511
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,778
Oh, my God!
That's Brandi's father's
game show.

512
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,337
What is it?
It's this cheesy <i>Dating Game</i>
rip-off thing.

513
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,746
Supposed to be
for college kids.

514
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:02,217
Just trying to capture
the '90s youth market with
a staple of '70s televisión.

515
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,653
Why can't they bring back
or remake good shows...

516
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,019
like <i>BJ and the Bear?</i>

517
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,082
Now there's a concept
I can't get enough of:
A man and his monkey.

518
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,060
Would you guys shut up?

519
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,356
You're breaking
my concentration.
Sorry, Willam.

520
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,933
Now I have to start
all over again.

521
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,299
Good luck with that thing.
Remember,
relax your eyes.

522
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,280
Wow, a sailboat!
Shut up!

523
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,712
Could this week
get any worse?

524
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,550
Now she's going to be
auctioned off on live TV
from a mall.

525
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,853
Not "a" mall, all right?
"The" mall.
Show some respect.

526
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,860
It doesn't have to
go down like that,
if we trash the thing.

527
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,158
There's a unique way
of getting back
in her good graces...

528
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,629
by ruining
her father's show.

529
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,894
You're a clever one.
I can get someone
to do it for us.

530
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,665
We'll be blame-free
and Brandi won't be able
to do the show.

531
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:57,030
Who is this imaginary
hatchet man?
Hatchet men.

532
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,464
Knock it off!

533
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,632
Kitty, kitty, kitty!

534
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,100
Look at these two.
$10 says they're trying
to figure out...

535
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,297
which one they're gonna
bury up to its neck and
run over with a lawn mower.

536
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,068
Kitty, kitty, kitty!
Hey, Jay!

537
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,632
Brodie, man!
Nootchy nootchies!

538
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,111
And, holy shit, what do
we have here? Mr. America's
Most Wanted himself.

539
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,909
I had a musket tangled
in my girlfriend's hair.

540
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,007
Ex-girlfriend.
What's he doing?

541
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,348
Shithead here
watched <i>Empire</i> and <i>Jedi</i>
last week...

542
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,820
and ever since,
he's been trying to do
the Jedi mind trick.

543
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,119
Crazy fuck thinks
he'll levitate shit
with his thoughts.

544
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,180
Knock it off!

545
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,988
The Force is strong
with this one.
Dude, don't encourage him.

546
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,929
So I was telling T.S. Here
we gotta find
Jay and Silent Bob.

547
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,556
If there's anyone
that can help us out...

548
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,692
it's the two guys
that have even less to do
than us.

549
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,794
What is this shit?
Everyone's
looking for us today.

550
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,204
We're ducking Tricia 'cause
she wants to talk to Obi-Wan
about her video set-up.

551
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,572
Why him?
Silent Bob's
an electrical genius.

552
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,976
He won the science fair
in eighth grade by
turning his mom's vibrator...

553
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,072
into a CD player,
using chicken wire and shit.

554
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,141
Motherfucker's like MacGyver.
No, motherfucker's
better than MacGyver!

555
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,276
Knock it off!

556
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,480
And it's that kind of smarts
we need, right, mopey?

557
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,647
Leave me out of this.

558
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:23,558
We need you to embark
on a little sabotage missión
on behalf of T.S.'s love life.

559
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,130
You know about this
game show thing
they've got going on here?

560
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,139
We need you guys
to somehow ensure that
it doesn't happen.

561
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,107
Is that it?
We were gonna do that anyway.

562
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,303
Really? Why?
What else are we gonna do?

563
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,677
Silent Bob just stole
the schematic of the stage
from some foolish carpenter...

564
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,308
and found a weakness,
just like
the fucking Death Star.

565
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,352
He figures if you pull
this crossbeam out...

566
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,183
fucking bickety-bam,
the whole stage
comes crashing down.

567
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,052
We were thinking
about something simple...

568
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,752
but if you want to
destroy the stage,
we're all for that.

569
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,192
Only problem is LaFours.
Who's LaFours?

570
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,390
You don't know who LaFours is?
They don't know
who LaFours is!

571
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,299
He's only the most feared
security guard
in the business, man.

572
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:08,236
460 collars, all convicted.
I hear
he's even got two kills.

573
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,638
Holy shit! I never thought
I'd see the day...

574
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,905
when two such highly reputable
mischief-makers
as yourselves...

575
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:17,175
douse their drawers
at the sight
of a mall security guard.

576
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,479
Shit, bitch! We're gonna
bust out that stage
like a high-school kegger.

577
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,815
We're just gonna
outwit LaFours, X-Men style.

578
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,548
Should I call you Logan,
Weapon X?

579
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,819
No, Wolverine!
Snicky, snicky, snoine.

580
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:31,794
What he's doing is imitating
Wolverine's berserker attack
with his Adamantium claws.

581
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,957
I never would have guessed.
All right, guys.
You have your missión...

582
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:38,331
go forth and wreak havoc.
Bye, baby kitties.

583
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,136
Damn, Silent Bob,
show some heart.

584
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,162
Pss, pss, pss.

585
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,039
That's better.
We're on the job.

586
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,439
Thanks.

587
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,244
I have to admit I'm shocked
you didn't try
to dissuade them.

588
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:56,184
I would if I
actually thought for a second
they could pull it off.

589
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,779
Ye of little faith,
want a cookie?

590
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,427
What's he doing?

591
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,829
If you stare at this póster
for a few seconds,
a hidden picture appears.

592
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,992
Can we do it? Please?

593
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,629
Go ahead, but hurry,
the Easter Bunny's waiting.

594
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,968
Wow, it's a schooner!

595
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,274
You dumb bastard!
It's not a schooner,
it's a sailboat.

596
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,576
A schooner is a sailboat,
stupidhead.

597
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,485
You know what?
There is no Easter Bunny!

598
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:35,321
Over there is just a guy
in a suit!

599
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,598
But they're engaged.
It doesn't matter,
it can't happen.

600
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,099
Why not?
It's bound to come up.

601
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,227
It's impossible.
Lois could never have
Superman's baby.

602
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,932
Do you think
her fallopian tubes
can handle his sperm?

603
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:52,407
I guarantee he blows a load
like a shotgun,
right through her back.

604
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:53,534
What about her womb?

605
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,704
Do you think
it's strong enough
to carry his child?

606
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,804
Sure. Why not?

607
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,576
He's an alien,
for Christ's sake!

608
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,176
His Kryptonian
biological makeup is enhanced
by Earth's yellow sun.

609
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,279
If Lois gets a tan,
the kid could kick
right through her stomach.

610
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:09,087
Only someone like Wonder Woman
has a strong enough uterus
to carry his kid.

611
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,425
The only way
he could bang regular chicks
is with a Kryptonite condom.

612
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,861
But that would kill him.

613
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,627
How did I go from the verge
of hot Floridian sex
with Brandi...

614
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,033
to Man of Steel
coital debates with you
in the food court?

615
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:22,732
Cookie stand is not part
of the food court.
Of course it is.

616
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,605
The food court is downstairs,
the cookie stand is upstairs.

617
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,576
It's not like we're talking
quantum physics here.

618
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,739
The cookie stand counts
as an eatery, the eatery's
a part of the food court.

619
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:31,804
Bullshit.

620
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,282
Eateries that operate
within the designated square
downstairs...

621
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,376
qualify as food court.

622
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,819
Anything outside
of said designated square...

623
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,880
is considered
an autonomous unit
for mid-mall snacking.

624
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,291
Now if you're gonna
wax intellectual
about the subject...

625
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,693
Holy shit!

626
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,294
Wait here.
Where are you going?

627
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,696
<i>Cherchez la femme.</i>

628
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,374
He said it was
just a guy in a suit.

629
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,810
Don't listen to that man,
he just said it to be mean.

630
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,879
That would look terrible
on you.

631
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,922
Didn't I dump your ass
this morning?

632
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,220
Look, I know you've had
some time to think about
the mistake you've made...

633
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,853
and I just want
to let you know
you don't have to apologize.

634
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,158
I'm sure you were just PMSing
or something.

635
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,995
Brodie, what kills me
about you is your inability
to function...

636
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,763
on the same plane of existence
as the rest of us.

637
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,098
Piss off.

638
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,701
Okay. I see you want to
continue with this charade
of ending our unión.

639
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:32,834
Fine, I'll play along.

640
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,004
But if we're divorced,
we're gonna have to divide
our mutual possessions.

641
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,445
What the hell
are you talking about?

642
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,540
You have
my <i>Punisher War Journal</i> #<i>6...</i>

643
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,552
my copy of <i>Fletch</i>
and the remote control
to my TV.

644
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,249
I know it's gonna be hard
to give this stuff up because
of its sentimental attachment.

645
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,552
Sentimental attachment?

646
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,024
If I have any
of that crap...

647
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:52,119
it's because
you brought it over
to my house and left it there.

648
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:56,458
Okay, then let's talk about
coming up with a schedule
for visitation rights.

649
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,831
For what?
For the mall.

650
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,167
I figure you can have
the odd days, I'll take
the even days and weekends.

651
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,605
When there's
any special function like
a sidewalk sale, boat show...

652
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:05,903
Brodie!

653
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,812
I have always taken you
with a grain of salt.

654
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,380
On your birthday,
when you asked me
to do a striptease...

655
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,283
to the theme
from <i>Mighty Mouse,</i>
I said okay.

656
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,944
When we were
at that hotel, prom night...

657
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,921
and you asked me
to sleep underneath the bed...

658
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,389
in case your mother burst in,
I did it.

659
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,586
And even when we were
at my grandmother's funeral...

660
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,094
when you told
most of my relatives...

661
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,825
that you could see her nipples
through her burial dress,
I let it slide.

662
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,925
If you think that
I'm gonna suffer any more
of your shit with a smile...

663
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:36,564
now that we're broken up,
you're in for some serious
fucking disappointment.

664
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:44,181
It wasn't <i>Mighty Mouse.</i>
It was
<i>Josie and the Pussycats.</i>

665
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,242
What?

666
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,449
Sorry.

667
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:57,951
Phase one:

668
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,895
First, you take a run
at LaFours with a sock
full of quarters.

669
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,262
I'd do it,
but I pulled my back...

670
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,494
out humping your mom
last night. Nudge.

671
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,628
You clock him on his headpiece
and knock his ass out cold.

672
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,365
That's when phase two
kicks in.

673
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,932
I attack the structure
Wolvie-berserk style and
knock out the fucking pin...

674
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,140
and bickety-bam,
the motherfucker's rubble.
Hence, no game show.

675
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,771
What? Do you know that kid
or something?

676
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,814
I hope his pants get caught
and a bloodbath ensues.

677
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,007
What is with you today?

678
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,050
Don't get me wrong.
I don't wish the kid harm...

679
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,176
but his mother should suffer
that horrific ordeal...

680
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,153
so she'll learn
how to manage her child.

681
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,156
That's sort of a harsh lesson,
don't you think?

682
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:37,490
There's not a year goes by
that I don't read about
an escalator accident...

683
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,724
involving some bastard kid
that could've been
easily avoided...

684
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:41,958
had some parent...

685
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,195
I don't care which one,
but some parent,
conditioned him...

686
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,829
to fear and respect
that escalator!

687
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,937
Wow! Look who it is.

688
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,003
Jerk!

689
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,880
Little Tricia Jones!
What's a pretty girl
like you...

690
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:04,751
doing sitting alone
in the middle of this
monument to consumerism?

691
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:08,189
Updating my calendar
and waiting for Jay
and Silent Bob.

692
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,695
And I suppose
you're here with no agenda,
as per usual.

693
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,026
On the contrary,
I'm here for comics.

694
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,693
T.S. Quint, Tricia Jones.
They call her Trish the Dish.

695
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,030
Nobody calls me that.

696
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:23,233
Our little Tricia here
is only 15 but somehow
she's a senior.

697
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,665
How'd you manage that?

698
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,835
Don't listen to him.
I studied my ass off.
Yeah, right.

699
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,904
So what do you say?
You wanna nail T.S. Or what?

700
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,073
Jesus, Brodie!

701
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:35,516
Calm down.
Tricia's compiling data
for this book she's writing...

702
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,453
about the sex drive of men
ages 14 to 30.

703
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:39,949
If I remember correctly...

704
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,983
it's titled <i>Bore-gasm:</i>
<i>A Study of the '90s Male's</i>
<i>Sexual Prowess.</i>

705
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,128
Ready to get sick?
Tell him about the advance
you got.

706
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:51,031
Pendant Publishing gave me
$20,000 based on a treatment
and a sample chapter.

707
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,568
You're kidding.
It's true.

708
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,900
She'll be the youngest author
to tackle the subject.

709
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,839
So when are they going
to publish this filthy
little tome of yours?

710
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,969
After my 18th birthday,
to avoid the moral
and legal entanglements.

711
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,639
So Tricia
sleeps with a bunch of guys
as research.

712
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,182
If that's not enough,
get this:

713
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,218
She videotapes all of them.
What?

714
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:12,187
I get everybody's consent
before we do it.
Most guys get off on it.

715
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,121
Men are easily amused.

716
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,619
What are you writing
in the calendar?

717
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,559
I was coding
last night's research.

718
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,154
She means sex.
I know what she meant.

719
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,290
What kind of codes?
Here, look.

720
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,067
The smiley face
is for when I go down
on the guy.

721
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,300
The smiley face with lashes
is for when the guy
goes down on me.

722
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,238
The circle is for
when we have sex.

723
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,971
The circle with the "X" in it
is for when I have an orgasm.

724
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,208
The little house
is when we do it inside
and the grass is for outside.

725
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,149
That kid is back
on the escalator again!

726
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:44,412
Wow, that's
a pretty elaborate log
you got there.

727
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,956
Wow, look at all
those smiley faces
without eyelashes.

728
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,288
That shows you
how courteous men are.

729
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,989
Out of 50 entries, only two
have smiley faces with lashes.

730
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,028
You slept with 50 guys?

731
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,760
To fill out my research, yes.

732
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,098
That's more guys
than you've slept with, dude.

733
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,969
Oh, my God.
That kid is sitting
on the escalator again!

734
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,170
How old
was last night's subject,
if you don't mind me asking?

735
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:10,179
Twenty-five. It was the guy
who runs that store
Fashionable Male.

736
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,875
Holy shit!
You slept with that asshole?
Why?

737
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,713
I needed a 25-year-old.

738
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,652
And he has
quite a distaste for you,
I might add.

739
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,349
He mentioned me during sex?
Afterwards.

740
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,552
He says he wants to
kick your ass. I'd steer
clear of him, if I were you.

741
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,686
Tell me you videotaped him
saying that.
No.

742
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,628
I shut the camera off
after the sex.

743
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,825
You should have heard
the stuff he wanted to do.

744
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,492
I'm having a hard time
with this.

745
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,832
Do your parents
know about this?
Of course.

746
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,873
That's remarkable.
That's criminal. That kid...

747
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,068
That kid is back
on the escalator again!

748
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,907
Leave it alone.
What?

749
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,641
So, I heard you were going
to propose to Brandi Svenning
in some theme park.

750
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,614
When are men going to learn
that women want romance?

751
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,783
Not Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
Be fair, all right?

752
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:58,087
Everyone wants
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
We gotta go.

753
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,091
Remember my offer.

754
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,929
I'm young, virile, sensitive
to a woman's needs...

755
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,196
Somehow I doubt it, Sega-boy.

756
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,061
Good luck with
the comic-book store.

757
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,276
"Sega-boy." God,
Rene's got a big mouth!

758
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,216
What does that mean,
"Good luck
with the comic-book store"?

759
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,278
How does that junior
Masters and Johnson
know about my proposal?

760
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,482
It's not like
she's in an exclusive club
or anything.

761
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,786
What are you talking about?

762
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,089
Sean Hartle's giving everyone
the inside scoop.

763
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,628
What? What's he saying?

764
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:36,598
How her father made her
do the game show so you
couldn't take her to Florida.

765
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,658
Now, what the hell
is this shit?

766
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,468
One hour? For what?

767
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,507
What the hell is this?
What's going on here?

768
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,102
What, you live
in a fucking cave?
The man is in there.

769
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,942
How'd Sean find this out?

770
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,244
He was interning at KREL
and he said
he heard Svenning...

771
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,841
barking at Brandi
over the phone about it.

772
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,352
Apparently he had a feeling
you were gonna
pop the question.

773
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,082
Who the fuck is the man?

774
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,680
What, you waited till now
to tell me this?

775
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,318
If you're gonna bother me
about this
for the rest of the day...

776
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,792
I'll go home!
You dragged me here!

777
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,660
You needed this.
Who the fuck is in there?

778
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,788
One side, Red.

779
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,866
What the hell's going on here?
I was warned about you.

780
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,302
Take it easy
before I have you removed...
Warned?

781
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,966
What the fuck
are you talking about?
Tell him, Steve.

782
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,474
Fuck you, fan-boy!

783
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,034
Would you two
testosterone-seething,
He-Man comic book fans...

784
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,807
finish up with this tough-guy
back-and-forth?

785
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,179
I got some questions
I need answered.
Who's in there?

786
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,377
You got to ask me nicely.
Fuck this.

787
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,113
Jesus Christ!

788
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,882
Get the hell off of him.
Come on.

789
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,322
You fuckers think
just 'cause a guy reads comics
he can't start some shit?

790
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,689
I'll fucking take
all of you on!

791
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,125
Somebody get a medic!

792
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,220
There's a little boy
caught in the escalator!

793
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,629
Come back here
and arrest this goon!

794
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,894
You're fucking next, man.
Jesus, Brodie!

795
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,369
I'm not going anywhere
until I find out
why I can't get my comics.

796
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,769
All right.

797
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,041
Excuse me.
Don't hit me.

798
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:55,203
Why is there a line?
Stan Lee is signing comics.

799
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,576
Stan Lee?

800
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,043
Okay, Lunchbox,
let's try this again.

801
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,054
We tie you to the roof,
you jump and sail
like a Spitfire...

802
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,556
passing right over
the arch-nemesis LaFours.

803
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:10,149
You then swing up to the stage
and knock out the pin.

804
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:13,321
And when that's gone,
the stage is trashed
and we go smoke a bowl.

805
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,729
You got it?
Now, get your fat ass
out there!

806
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,734
And, dude,
don't forget your helmet.
Snoogins.

807
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,734
Fly, fat-ass, fly!

808
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,744
What the fuck?

809
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,388
You fucker!

810
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:15,985
Security?
Is it alive?

811
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,890
Yeah.
This is Popular Girl.

812
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,828
We just had something crash
through the wall.

813
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,662
Stan Lee!
How does something
as big as the creator...

814
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,202
of the most important titles
in comics history...

815
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,967
coming to my mall get by me?
I must be slipping
in my old age.

816
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,871
The name amongst names.

817
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,206
There's a million questions
I'd love to ask him.

818
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:35,506
Her father!

819
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,639
I knew this game show thing
was just a beard
for an attempt to break us up.

820
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,809
Why can't he just
leave us alone and let us
follow through with our plans?

821
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,012
What kind of man
are you, anyway?

822
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,318
I'm talking comics
and you bring up
chicks and romance?

823
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,792
While we're on the subject,
why the hell do you want
to get married now, anyway?

824
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,227
You're still in college.
I was just gonna propose.

825
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,231
The wedding wouldn't be
till after we graduate.

826
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,732
Waste of time,
if you ask me.

827
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,166
My grandmother always said,
"Why buy the cow...

828
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,466
when you get the sex
for free?"

829
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,199
She did?
All the time.

830
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,468
Of course,
she became a lesbian
on her 60th birthday...

831
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,134
but that's beside the point.

832
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,940
Where the hell
are these two going
in such a hurry?

833
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,827
Is he gone?
Halfway to Buy Me Toys
by now.

834
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,095
Damn, that bastard's faster
than Walt Flanagan's dog.

835
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,236
What's with all the running?

836
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,101
What the hell happened to him?

837
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,607
The human brown-eye here
is a walking calamity.

838
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,109
We'll have to take a pass
on the stage-trashing
business...

839
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,078
otherwise he's liable
to kill himself.

840
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,273
Sorry, bro.
No hard feelings.

841
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,274
Isn't that Rene?

842
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,081
She's probably looking for me.
I better go talk to her.

843
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,484
Keep that.

844
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,420
I don't know.
She's with somebody.

845
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,720
She's practically blowing him.

846
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,223
Wait a minute, isn't that...
The asshole
from Fashionable Male!

847
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,697
Son of a bitch!
My God! You think
that they're...

848
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,394
Could be.
It'll explain why
he hates me so much.

849
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,460
And there's only one way
to find out.

850
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,129
Can you run interference
with the lug?

851
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,731
What are you gonna do?
Get some answers.

852
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:16,838
Shit!

853
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,661
You work
at the Fashionable Male,
don't you?

854
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,327
Yeah? So?

855
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:40,235
That's a great store
you got there.

856
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:45,899
Thanks. Listen, I'm trying
to spend my lunch hour
with my lady friend here.

857
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,000
So why don't you beat it?

858
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,239
That's your girlfriend?
Right there?

859
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,845
If you don't stop
gawking at me and get the hell
out of here...

860
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,254
I'll kick your ass.

861
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:05,283
Haven't you ever
heard the phrase,
"The customer's always right"?

862
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,589
Let me tell you
a little secret:

863
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,996
The customer's
always an asshole!

864
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,597
Jesus Christ!
What the hell
gives with the cover boy?

865
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,608
None of your damn business.
He'd kick your ass
if he knew about this.

866
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:22,770
Are you insane?
The guy looks like
a date rapist!

867
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,642
Is that my jacket?
Start the elevator.

868
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:28,514
Not until you tell me
what the situation is with you
and the Sperminator out there.

869
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,212
How long has this
been going on?

870
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,778
Since I finally mustered
the good sense
to send you packing.

871
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,949
He's a much more
suitable companion than you,
any day.

872
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,185
Are you nuts?

873
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,854
The guy's pure testosterone!
He's a walking hard-on,
looking for a hole!

874
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,058
I need testosterone
after babysitting you and
your comic book collection.

875
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,691
I forgot what real men
were like.

876
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:49,000
I can't believe
you have the nerve to come
to my mall and pick up guys!

877
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,664
No, Shannon
did the picking up.

878
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,674
He's already taken me to lunch
at the Cheese Haus...

879
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,506
purchased tickets
for the opera night
and took me to stores I like!

880
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,945
I took you shopping
all the time!

881
00:51:58,014 --> 00:51:59,675
You took me
where you went shopping, jerk!

882
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:00,738
Do you think I care...

883
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,183
what rat-hole store
in that shit-pit
you call the dirt mall...

884
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,550
has got the latest
<i>Godzilla</i> bootlegs?

885
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,590
You call eating pizza
in the same dive pizzeria
every night eating out?

886
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:08,646
Do I give a shit...

887
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,955
when two major comic labels
are crossing over
characters...

888
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,860
and selling two editions
of the book
in varied-ink chromium covers?

889
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,192
I'm a girl, damn it!

890
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:19,292
I want to do girly things
like fix someone's hair
and get romantic phone calls.

891
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,064
I call you all the time!

892
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,698
"Rene, my mom's asleep.
Come over."
You call that romantic?

893
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,936
When was the last time
you pulled out my chair
or told me I was beautiful?

894
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,171
This guy does all this
in the span of a day!

895
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,010
This guy already introduced me
to his mother.

896
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,208
Really?

897
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,547
He was up and at work
by 9:00 this morning.

898
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,746
Unlike my ex-boyfriend,
who would sleep until 1:00...

899
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,415
'cause he played Sega
and watched videos
all night long!

900
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,754
Which, by the way,
has enormous effect
on your libido.

901
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,726
Now you attack my libido?

902
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,786
There's no libido to attack.
No libido to attack?

903
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:57,070
You're sure you saw her
get on, right?
Maybe she was getting off.

904
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,443
Ow.

905
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,316
Sorry.
It's all right.

906
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:19,194
You know something?
You look familiar to me.

907
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,596
Couldn't be.
I'm never at the mall much.

908
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,759
No, it's not from the mall.

909
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,467
I know. You're the guy
from the news that kidnapped
the President's daughter...

910
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,632
and threw her off the roof.

911
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,072
I got a musket tangled
in my girlfriend's hair,
for Christ's sake.

912
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,480
There, that was romantic,
right?

913
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,813
Passionate, yeah.

914
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:49,421
No, Brodie.
That was too little, too late.

915
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:51,517
Too little?

916
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,495
You said it was a good size.

917
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:57,260
The effort, you retard.
The effort was too little,
too late.

918
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:01,593
But now that you mention it,
when a girl says
it's a good size...

919
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:04,603
it's a nice way of saying
that it's small.

920
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,108
Hey!

921
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,646
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch.
No, forget about him.

922
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:23,122
He just wanted to give me
something that he forgot
to give me a long time ago.

923
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,161
He's harmless now. Okay?

924
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,094
Fine. I gotta get back
to the store. Let's go.

925
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,335
Right there
in the elevator?

926
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,174
I don't know
what came over me.
She challenged my libido.

927
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:46,374
I felt obligated
to defend myself
against her accusations.

928
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,781
It's not like
you still wanted her
or anything like that.

929
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,082
Not in the least.
I'm over her.

930
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:55,855
Holy shit!
You really love that girl.
Yeah, right.

931
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,524
No, I never noticed it before,
but she really
fuels your engine.

932
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,257
You have this
new glow about you.

933
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,355
I don't have a glow.

934
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:03,558
You do. You're glowing.

935
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,965
If I have a glow
it's because just I got laid.

936
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:10,803
I'd look the same if I banged
anyone in that elevator,
present company excluded.

937
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,669
Deny it all you want.
I think you're too proud
to admit you want her back.

938
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:17,574
I suddenly want something
very bad to happen to you.

939
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,376
What is your problem?
I don't understand.

940
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,248
Gwen! I'm sorry.
You fucker!

941
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,292
See! That's what you get
for fucking with me.

942
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,687
Hey, Gwen,
he didn't really mean
to hit you.

943
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:37,494
He's got a funny way
of showing it, by elbowing me
in my frigging tit!

944
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,559
Why the hell are you glowing?
I'm not glowing.

945
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:41,966
Brandi dumped him.

946
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,972
Would you stop saying that?

947
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,304
I know. I heard.
You heard? How?

948
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:49,004
She told me. I ran into her
a few minutes ago.

949
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,172
Really? Where?
By the stage.

950
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,708
Do you want me to rub it?

951
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,918
Work with me, people,
would you please?
No, I don't want this here.

952
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,322
I want it toward the front.
The rug keeps popping up.

953
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,122
If I put the podium there,
it'll stay down.

954
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,822
Move it!

955
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,496
Mr. Svenning!
Give me the podium!

956
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:15,934
You put the podium down
over here...

957
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,365
Like this.

958
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:23,242
You stamp the carpet down
with your feet.
You speak English?

959
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,178
Like this.

960
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,315
Mr. Svenning!
Let me help you up.

961
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,278
Get off! Move!
Here, let me help you.

962
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,188
All right,
where's Brandi?
Let go of me!

963
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:37,749
Where's Brandi?

964
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,363
You're fired.
You get the hell out of here.

965
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,024
Get off my set!

966
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,736
Where is she?

967
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,601
You are out of her life.

968
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,835
Now, you stay
out of her business and mine,
understand me?

969
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,774
Come on, people.
Are we working here?

970
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,404
Get the backdrop ready.
Are those lights ready to go?

971
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,209
Okay, Mr. Svenning.

972
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:00,476
Go on the other side...

973
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,917
and put the podium
over the bad spot
in the carpet, okay?

974
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,420
The hole? Please. Go. Now.

975
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:06,750
So, you made her dump me...

976
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,518
and now you're going to
auction her off...

977
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,821
in an effort to better
further your own career?

978
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:12,293
Not that
it's any of your concern...

979
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,159
but Brandi agreed
to be on <i>Truth or Date.</i>

980
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,688
After that shit you pulled
last night, I think she's even
looking forward to it.

981
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,100
It'll give her a chance
to find herself a decent guy.

982
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,570
Somebody with a brain.

983
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,834
You admit it?
You are behind
our break-up.

984
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,170
Admit it?

985
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,734
Hell, I'm as proud of it
as I am
of this game show here.

986
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,246
Listen to me.
It's over between you two.

987
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,954
The sooner you get that,
the better off
we're all gonna be.

988
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:44,257
Understand me? You don't.

989
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,927
Guard, come here.
Get this guy off of my set.

990
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:53,291
If he gives you any shit,
you have my permissión
to castrate him.

991
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,300
You can't do this!

992
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,736
I just did.

993
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:04,243
Get me LaFours.
Right away, sir.

994
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,213
Well, go on!

995
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,879
I wonder
if my mother ever wore
a pair like this.

996
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,056
How about these?

997
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,557
Very sexy.
That sounded convincing.

998
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,187
I'm preoccupied.

999
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:21,355
T.S., she told you.
She's just doing it
as a favor to her father.

1000
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,455
Regardless.

1001
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,659
It's not like
she'll fuck the guy
on public access.

1002
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,328
She might as well.
You're overreacting again.

1003
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:31,237
That's why
your relationships fail.
It's certainly why ours did.

1004
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:35,334
You got bent out of shape
the same way over that
costume party in high school.

1005
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,436
You fucked Rick Derris
on a pool table!

1006
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,415
With everyone watching,
no less.
It was a costume party, T.S.

1007
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,110
No one could tell it was me.

1008
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,450
Besides, who else but you
remembers shit like that?

1009
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,351
I would've been a sexy chick.

1010
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,414
Do you remember
that costume party?

1011
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:52,950
Might that have been the one
where you banged Rick Derris
on the pool table?

1012
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,326
Nobody remembers
shit like that?

1013
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,831
How is it that you recall
the most trivial events?

1014
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,666
I'll never forget it.
How many chances do you get to
see Smokey fuck the Bandit?

1015
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:02,671
Didn't I look just like
Burt Reynolds?

1016
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,536
Except for the moustache.

1017
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,402
You know, they have
a whole room
you're supposed to do that in?

1018
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,037
Some pervert wanted to
see me naked so badly today...

1019
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,637
he busted in on me twice
while I was trying on stuff.

1020
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,842
This saves him the effort.

1021
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,487
How much longer are we
gonna be in this
chick store, anyway?

1022
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,852
I'm starting to get
a mean hard-on.

1023
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:22,323
Brodie, Tell me about
the Rene break-up.

1024
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,917
I threw her away
like a parking ticket.

1025
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,826
Don't front, Brodie.
I talked to Rene's cousin
this morning.

1026
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:31,526
It was vice-versa.
They certainly aren't
acting broken up.

1027
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,091
Go ahead.
Ask him about the elevator.

1028
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:36,103
Tell me about the elevator.
It goes up and down.

1029
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:40,904
Rene seems so coarse, anyway.
What was it like to date her?

1030
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,740
Ever slept with somebody?
Uh, yeah.

1031
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,404
I mean,
really slept with somebody.

1032
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:48,541
Beside them,
not just fuck them
on a gaming table.

1033
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,352
We slept together one time,
remember, in high school?

1034
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,480
That ski trip?
That was you?

1035
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:57,390
Yes, Brodie,
I've slept beside many people.
All right.

1036
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,757
You know how when someone lays
with their back to you...

1037
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,821
and you lay behind them
really close and you throw
one arm over them?

1038
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,458
It's called spooning.

1039
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,229
But you gotta put
the other arm somewhere.

1040
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,294
You can either lay on it
or just shove it
in between your bodies.

1041
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,932
The only other option is
to stretch it above your head.

1042
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,671
But sometimes my arm pops out
of the socket when
I'm sleeping like that.

1043
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,508
So, I was constantly searching
for someplace
to keep my arm...

1044
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:20,674
while still laying
close to her.

1045
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:22,541
And?

1046
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:26,644
What do you mean, "And"?
That's like a metaphor for
our whole relationship.

1047
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,383
Jackass.

1048
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,218
I'm all out. I'll meet you
at the food court.

1049
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,989
I know exactly how he feels.
Excuse me.

1050
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,167
Fill this with Coke, no ice.

1051
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,206
Want a sip of my soda?

1052
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,012
Smartass ex-boyfriend.

1053
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,284
You know who I am?

1054
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,219
A deeply resentful
retail manager?

1055
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:05,689
Rene's with me now. Okay?
You got that?

1056
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:09,189
So don't be sniffing
around her anymore like
you tried to do today.

1057
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:10,254
Shit!

1058
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,195
There goes the lung.

1059
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:13,530
Listen to me.

1060
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:17,004
I got two things to tell you.
One: I don't like you.

1061
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,438
I see you every week
in this mall.

1062
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,203
I don't like
shiftless layabouts.

1063
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,244
You're one of these
fucking loser mallrat kids.

1064
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,508
You don't come here
to work or shop,
you hang out all day.

1065
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,276
Act like you
fucking live here.

1066
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,012
I have no respect
for people with
no shopping agenda.

1067
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:32,919
Is this what's known as
motivated salesmanship?

1068
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:40,886
Rene told me to
leave you alone,
but she's fucking clueless.

1069
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,766
The newly single often feel
strangely protective of
the ex-boyfriend.

1070
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:51,136
If this is her idea
of protective,
hate to have her mad at me.

1071
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,080
Now, you see, Bruce...

1072
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:04,114
I like to pick up giris
on the rebound from
a disappointing relationship.

1073
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:07,088
They're more vulnerable,
they're in much more
need of solace...

1074
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,021
and they're fairly
open to suggestion.

1075
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:13,188
And I use that suggestion
to fuck them someplace
very uncomfortable.

1076
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:16,221
What,
like the back of a Volkswagen?

1077
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:20,801
No,
like somewhere giris dread.

1078
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,667
All right. Now...

1079
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,670
is it because
it's a challenge?
Is it because it's taboo?

1080
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,579
Or is it because
I like to, you know...

1081
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:38,018
have them differently than
they've ever been had before?

1082
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,248
This sounds like a discussión
much more suited...

1083
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:42,814
to an extended professional
counseling sessión.

1084
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,019
I'll go get a therapist
for you.

1085
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:51,963
Now, evidently, the only one
that's gonna need
a doctor here...

1086
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,729
is yourself, my friend.

1087
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,805
And my suggestion to you is...

1088
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,140
forget you ever dated Rene.

1089
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,934
Until I get what
I'm looking for from
this latest dalliance...

1090
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,573
I better not find you within
10 city blocks of her...

1091
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:08,947
otherwise I will be forced
to do you some
very serious damage.

1092
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:11,248
All right?
We clear on that?

1093
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,752
Rene who?

1094
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:16,316
There you go.
Not bad, you're learning.

1095
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,058
We're all right, right?

1096
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,116
Bruce.

1097
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,629
I'm glad we had
this little chat.

1098
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,964
I'll remember it
when I'm fucking
your girlfriend.

1099
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,439
And my store's having
a sale next weekend.

1100
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,941
You should come by.
I'll cut you a nice deal
on a suit.

1101
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,240
Did we ever get along?
Once or twice.

1102
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,148
How come we went out
as long as we did?
You had cable.

1103
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,950
So, are you gonna stay
for the show?

1104
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,287
Absolutely not.
As soon as he gets back here,
I'm gone.

1105
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,122
T.S. Quint. Where's your
sense of chivalry?

1106
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,854
Oh, my God! Is that Brodie?

1107
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,492
You're fucking kidding?
The Easter Bunny did this?

1108
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,001
All I said was
the Easter Bunny...

1109
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,934
at the Menlo Park mall
was more convincing.

1110
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,869
He just jumped the railing
and knocked me down.

1111
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,000
He's fucking dead!
Let it go.
He's under a lot of pressure.

1112
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:08,167
What the hell happened to him?

1113
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,576
The guy in the Easter Bunny
suit kicked his ass.
