1
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,084
For as long as humans
have existed on Earth,

2
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,542
we have looked to the heavens in wonder.

3
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:50,792
Fascinated by the countless stars
in the night sky.

4
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:07,501
But in all the unimaginable
vastness of space,

5
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,626
we found only one place like this.

6
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:21,876
It's a small blue planet,
with a rocky moon.

7
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,376
Travelling around a star.

8
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,417
It's just close enough
to be fed by its sun's energy,

9
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,876
but not blasted by its heat.

10
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:48,167
It spins on its axis,

11
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,792
so that for half a day
its surface basks in light,

12
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:55,667
then for half it cools in shade.

13
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,626
You might say, it's the lucky planet.

14
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:15,042
Because its rhythm of light and shade,

15
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:19,417
turns out to be a vital ingredient,
for life itself.

16
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,709
Earth, our home.

17
00:02:57,292 --> 00:03:00,667
As far as we know, our planet is unique.

18
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:03,251
As far as we know,

19
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:08,834
one day spent here is the most
amazing thing in the whole universe.

20
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,626
The magical dance of Earth and Sun,

21
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:50,042
has created millions of different kinds
of plants and animals,

22
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:52,334
alive on our Earth today.

23
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,334
Some, you see every day.

24
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:02,709
Others, are very rare.

25
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,917
But, we all have one thing in common.

26
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:19,584
Our lives are driven
by the rhythm of night and day.

27
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,501
One hint of morning sunlight...

28
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:28,917
And we respond in so many different ways.

29
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:05,959
Some animals need it.

30
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,001
Others, hide from it.

31
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,626
Most of us, love it.

32
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,376
Some, even greet it with song.

33
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:19,709
Whatever way we choose to meet it,

34
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:25,292
sunrise is the power
that brings our world to life.

35
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:36,917
Africa.

36
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:43,667
Here, the first hours of the day belong
not just to those who rise early,

37
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,709
but to those who stayed up late.

38
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,334
This serval has been hunting
during the night.

39
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,751
But now he's pushing his luck.

40
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:33,251
He's out late,
trying for a final mouthful.

41
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,709
His high jumping technique is perfect,

42
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,167
for hunting amongst the long grass
of the African savanna.

43
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:53,751
He's looking for prey,
but mostly listening for it.

44
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:01,334
His enormous radar ears
can hear a pin drop.

45
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:11,376
Or a careless step
from a southern vlei rat.

46
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:38,709
Now the sunlight's growing stronger,
maybe it's time for bed.

47
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:58,792
On the other side of the world,
on an isolated group of Pacific islands,

48
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:05,417
there are animals who can't even think
about running around so early in the day.

49
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:14,792
They can't do anything until they've
been warmed up by the Sun's power.

50
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,334
The Galapagos Islands are home for some
of the most unusual animals on Earth.

51
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:33,042
Marine iguana.

52
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:42,917
Their morning ritual is always the same.

53
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,792
As the sun comes up on their island home,

54
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,084
they simply sprawl on the rocks,

55
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:51,834
lapping it up.

56
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,584
Reptiles are pretty much solar-powered.

57
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:09,042
They need the sun's heat,
before they can move a muscle.

58
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,417
And they're not the only creatures
soaking up the sun.

59
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:43,292
Galapagos racer snakes aren't big enough
to trouble an adult iguana.

60
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:47,167
But, something smaller?

61
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:03,251
Away from the rocks where grown-ups live,
buried in the sand,

62
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:06,292
baby iguanas have been incubating
underground...

63
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,584
for over three months.

64
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:14,042
Today when the Sun has warmed the sand,

65
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:17,084
they will emerge.

66
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:31,917
It's time for this one,
to crawl out into the rest of life.

67
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,251
If she starts too early,
before she's warm enough,

68
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:41,876
she won't have the energy
to run very fast.

69
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:50,542
If she leaves too late,
then her enemies may be supercharged.

70
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,542
It's the biggest decision
she'll ever make.

71
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,126
She made it.

72
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,459
The snakes missed their chance.

73
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,709
But more babies are hatching.

74
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,626
And now the snakes are on alert.

75
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:05,167
It's the best opportunity
they will get to eat all year.

76
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:33,584
On flat ground a baby iguana
can outrun a racer snake.

77
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:38,917
But, others are waiting in ambush.

78
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:12,251
Another hatchling has his first glimpse
of a dangerous world.

79
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:11,501
The snake's eyes aren't very good,

80
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,917
but they can detect movement.

81
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:24,001
So, if the hatchling keeps its nerve,
it may just be okay.

82
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,001
An amazing escape.

83
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,501
The biggest achievement
of any young animal's life.

84
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:42,126
Powered by our local star.

85
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:56,709
Mid-morning.

86
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:02,292
As the Sun climbs higher,
its rays reach further.

87
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:06,917
Bringing magic wherever they touch.

88
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:31,084
Plants turn the light into life.

89
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:40,042
They take thin air and the Sun's energy
and with photosynthesis make new growth.

90
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:47,417
Conjuring up tangled forest worlds,
leaf by leaf.

91
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:12,667
It's the alchemy upon which
everything else on Earth depends.

92
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,376
A matter of life,

93
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:17,959
and death.

94
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:46,542
One plant can weave
its particular spell in a single day.

95
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:53,959
This is bamboo.

96
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:57,334
It can grow almost a millimetre a minute.

97
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,876
The fastest growing plant in the world.

98
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:15,292
It's still only mid-morning.

99
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,667
Most of this has grown since dawn.

100
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:32,751
And since dawn,
this giant panda has been eating it.

101
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:42,042
The trouble with bamboo,
is that it's not very nutritious.

102
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:47,209
The trouble with pandas,
is that they're very fussy.

103
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:52,001
Bamboo is almost
the only thing they'll eat.

104
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,959
To get enough energy to feed herself,

105
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:03,376
this panda will need
to eat up to 14 hours today.

106
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:08,084
Longer probably, because she's nursing.

107
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:13,917
But for her cub, it's different.

108
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:21,709
She lives mostly on her mother's milk,
so chewing is only really her hobby.

109
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:25,417
Not yet a full-time job.

110
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:57,792
This morning, she has something
rare in the natural world.

111
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:01,792
Time to spare.

112
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,751
And, to explore.

113
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,292
Because of their specialised way of life,

114
00:21:57,459 --> 00:22:00,792
giant pandas are amongst
the rarest animals in the world.

115
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,751
Cubs like her are more precious still.

116
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,209
There are only a few hundred alive.

117
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:20,334
A rare animal with the rarest luxury.

118
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:23,792
Time.

119
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:48,376
As the morning sun grows in strength,

120
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:52,376
it begins to brew a spell
of a different kind.

121
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:01,376
The Sun is pouring energy
into our atmosphere, heating it up.

122
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:07,709
It evaporates water from land and sea,

123
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,501
and builds clouds.

124
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:41,709
Across Africa, clouds and weather
are constantly on the move,

125
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:48,751
bringing rain and fresh grass
to different places at different times.

126
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:56,417
For millions of animals,
the job of every morning is to move

127
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:02,126
to where the rain
will make the grass grow next.

128
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:04,917
Whatever stands in their way.

129
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,042
This morning,

130
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:18,709
the need to keep moving will present a
particular challenge for one young zebra.

131
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:27,667
This foal could walk
less than an hour after birth.

132
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,126
She can handle almost anything.

133
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:47,001
But she's never faced
an obstacle like this.

134
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:56,209
Swollen by highland rain,
the river is fast and furious.

135
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,876
And full of dangers.

136
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:36,751
The young zebra is going to need
every bit of her mother's help,

137
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:38,542
if she's going to make it.

138
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,209
It turns out the biggest threat
isn't attack by other animals,

139
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:56,542
it's the river itself.

140
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:05,959
Her mother tries to lead the foal
to the shallowest waters,

141
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,959
but she's just too small.

142
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:14,251
And the current's just too strong.

143
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,917
The foal is on the verge of exhaustion,

144
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:30,334
but her mother will not give up.

145
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:57,209
While others are escaping,
she calls for her foal to keep going.

146
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:20,917
And finally, a way out.

147
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:34,876
There is a saying in Africa,
"If you wanna go quickly, go alone.

148
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:38,876
If you wanna go far, go together."

149
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:54,167
After this,

150
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:59,167
the zebra foal and her mother can surely
handle anything the day throws at them.

151
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:12,459
The Sun is approaching
its highest and most powerful.

152
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,584
In the far north, in the Arctic,

153
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:28,042
ice has held land and ocean
in its grip for months.

154
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:33,792
The Sun near the poles is always lower
and weaker than anywhere else.

155
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:38,417
But still, its energy will transform.

156
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:54,834
Narwhal.

157
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:02,167
One of the most mysterious
animals on the planet.

158
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,792
For the moment they can't travel far,

159
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:20,042
only small openings in the ice
allow them to surface and breathe.

160
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:26,501
But the power of the Sun
is coming to their rescue.

161
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:38,959
For many days

162
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:42,917
the Sun's heat has been gnawing away
at the ice's hold on sea and land.

163
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:54,459
Now, approaching its highest
and strongest, the Sun begins to triumph.

164
00:30:56,792 --> 00:31:01,126
And the battle of heat against cold,
becomes a rout.

165
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:14,167
On land, rivers flow again.

166
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,751
In the oceans, where the ice is now weak,

167
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,959
the Sun's warmth, opens cracks.

168
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:34,042
And the cracks become channels.

169
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:39,876
Roadways along, which the narwhal
can traverse their icy kingdom.

170
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:49,042
In Inuit legend, the first narwhal
was a brave female hunter.

171
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:54,626
Caught up in a deadly embrace
with a whale she hunted,

172
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:01,792
Her braided hair flung out,
becoming the twisted tusk.

173
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:31,626
For these narwhal, what an amazing day.

174
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:37,459
They are free again,
to roam their ocean home.

175
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:56,209
The strength of the Sun becomes greater
and greater, the further south you go.

176
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,501
In the mountains of North America,

177
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:13,626
the sunlight of a spring day,
brings the freshly thawed world to life.

178
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,751
If you're still wearing your winter coat,

179
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:34,042
the heat during the middle-of-the-day
can get a bit uncomfortable.

180
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:41,834
You need to find a tree
and give yourself a good scratch.

181
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:09,917
Rubbing against the bark
not only gets to the itch,

182
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:13,042
it helps a hot bear shed its winter fur.

183
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:21,626
It's also a chance to mark the territory
with your personal scent.

184
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:25,834
So everyone knows exactly who's in town.

185
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:27,084
It's now midday,

186
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:31,876
and the world feels the full force
of our friendly neighbourhood star.

187
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:37,209
The sun is now at its highest in the sky.

188
00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:42,084
Its light penetrates even
the deep hidden folds of the Earth.

189
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:10,126
In Africa, near the equator,
its energy creates a furnace.

190
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:27,417
This zebra foal and her herd
still need to move on.

191
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:39,292
But every step is tough in heat like this.

192
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:48,834
Any scrap of shade...

193
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:50,667
is an oasis.

194
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:09,042
In full sunlight,
the herd are easy for hunters to see.

195
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:27,376
But there is one blessing
about the midday sun.

196
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:38,917
It's simply too hot for lions to hunt.

197
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:08,917
There is something, however,
that doesn't take a break,

198
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:11,459
even in the heat of the day.

199
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:15,459
The struggle for power.

200
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:39,584
Rivalry between males for territory
and for the attentions of females

201
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:45,126
is so overpowering, it drives even
the most placid of creatures to combat.

202
00:39:50,376 --> 00:39:52,251
At high noon in the desert heat,

203
00:39:55,292 --> 00:40:00,001
a young male giraffe is challenging
the resident bull for prime territory

204
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:02,584
and the females that go with it.

205
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:28,917
At first they just push and shove,
trying to intimidate each other.

206
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,084
Normally, this would be an end to it,

207
00:40:34,584 --> 00:40:39,126
but the young rival seems to think
he has a chance and attacks.

208
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,209
Neither will back down.

209
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:47,626
The old bull is down.

210
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:52,417
He knows the final blow is coming.

211
00:41:55,876 --> 00:41:57,167
So, he ducks...

212
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,584
and hits back.

213
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:27,251
It is over.

214
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:38,251
The day still belongs to the old master.

215
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:45,084
For the loser, it's exile in the desert.

216
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:32,709
The land and the creatures that live
on it, toast under the noonday sun.

217
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:43,584
But one habitat remains cool, even now.

218
00:43:53,876 --> 00:43:58,084
Over the course of a single day,
even the enormous power of the Sun,

219
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:01,584
isn't strong enough to warm
the great oceans by much.

220
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:07,584
Here, some of the largest
creatures on Earth,

221
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:11,459
live lives as long,
and perhaps as complex, as our own.

222
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:30,709
This is a family of sperm whales.

223
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:43,167
And at its heart, a rare sight.

224
00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:45,792
A calf.

225
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:52,626
Already 15ft long, she's about a year old,

226
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:56,376
and very inquisitive.

227
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:20,917
For two or three years,
she will feed on her mother's milk.

228
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:25,542
It's so rich in fat,
it has the consistency of cottage cheese.

229
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:29,626
So it doesn't dissolve in the sea
water as it's being gulped down.

230
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:43,417
The great whales are the biggest
predators that have ever existed,

231
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:47,292
yet, they make
the most protective parents.

232
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:53,209
And very talkative ones,

233
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,334
chatting in a language of clicks.

234
00:45:59,459 --> 00:46:01,334
They're the loudest
creatures on the planet,

235
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,084
capable of sounds,
far louder than a jet engine.

236
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:17,042
But right now, it's time for silence.

237
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:22,626
Hanging vertically,
the giants of the sea...

238
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,959
take an afternoon nap.

239
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:42,626
These whales have brains larger
than any other animal.

240
00:46:48,126 --> 00:46:51,834
Who can guess with what richness
they dream away the day.

241
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:54,584
In the tropics, the oppressive heat
of midday lingers well into the afternoon.

242
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,667
On a tiny island, off the coast of Panama,
in Central America,

243
00:48:03,126 --> 00:48:05,292
everything takes life slowly.

244
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:18,334
A pygmy three-toed sloth.

245
00:48:22,626 --> 00:48:26,084
At his best, he is slothful.

246
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:35,709
At this time of day,
he's pretty much comatose.

247
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:50,959
Only one thing might rouse him.

248
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:56,251
And it's this...

249
00:48:59,126 --> 00:49:03,959
The call of the female sloth,
out there somewhere.

250
00:49:10,084 --> 00:49:12,834
And since it's high tide,
why not take the short cut.

251
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:26,667
The only problem is from down here,

252
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:31,251
it's not easy to tell where
the potential mate is calling from.

253
00:50:07,626 --> 00:50:08,626
Could this be her?

254
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:00,876
Sadly for him,
this female is not looking for a date.

255
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:12,709
While she's nursing her cub,
she's quite happy to stay single.

256
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:23,959
As they say, "mañana."
There's always tomorrow.

257
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:48,792
Though island life here moves slowly,

258
00:51:49,876 --> 00:51:53,584
the pace of the afternoon is very
different in other parts of the world.

259
00:52:23,126 --> 00:52:26,042
This is Zavodovski Island in Antarctica,

260
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:29,917
home for 1. 5 million chinstrap penguins.

261
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:46,917
It's an extraordinary place.

262
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:51,542
An outcrop of rock,
spewed out by the volcano at its heart.

263
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:00,626
The oceans beat against it night and day.

264
00:53:08,209 --> 00:53:10,834
And the penguins
are caught in the crossfire.

265
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:20,084
All day, the adult penguins
struggle against the waves

266
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:23,167
as they journey between home
and their hunting grounds, offshore.

267
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:28,251
It's an ordeal they can't avoid.

268
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,584
Their families depend on them.

269
00:53:37,042 --> 00:53:39,501
Chinstrap penguin chicks
are completely helpless,

270
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:42,209
without the support
of both mother and father.

271
00:53:46,584 --> 00:53:48,417
They need fresh food every day.

272
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:53,542
And their parents take turns to fetch it.

273
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:59,417
It means an awful lot of hunting...

274
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:04,167
...for an awful lot of moms and dads.

275
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:11,709
This mother has no food
left to feed her chicks.

276
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,001
They now need their father to return,

277
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:19,542
and soon.

278
00:54:30,626 --> 00:54:31,459
At mid-afternoon,

279
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:35,667
the first wave of hunters,
who left early this morning, return.

280
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,209
Amongst them is the chick's father.

281
00:54:44,376 --> 00:54:49,417
He's been fishing 50 miles offshore,
but now he's not far away.

282
00:54:55,334 --> 00:55:00,209
If getting safely into the water
was difficult, getting out is even harder.

283
00:55:25,751 --> 00:55:29,792
Tiny claws help them to get whatever
grip he can on the rough water.

284
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:03,542
The father now has
a two mile walk to his family.

285
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:08,959
And a stomach loaded
with food, doesn't help.

286
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,834
This is the largest
penguin colony on Earth.

287
00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:28,209
But, as he makes the same
journey every other day,

288
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:33,167
he should be able
to do it with his eyes closed.

289
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:38,209
At least, most of the time.

290
00:56:41,751 --> 00:56:43,959
Like any commute,
it can get a little congested.

291
00:56:44,959 --> 00:56:48,626
And sometimes, it can be hard
to remember where you parked your kids.

292
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:57,376
The mother is still waiting,
the chicks are now desperate.

293
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:09,376
In the midst of all this deafening chorus,
he can recognise her particular cry.

294
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:13,167
She is, literally, one in a million.

295
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:22,792
A head bob, is the penguin's way
of saying, "Welcome home."

296
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:32,959
Both chicks will get a meal.

297
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:42,167
A happy end to the toughest
commute on Earth.

298
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:58,251
Mid-afternoon
in the rainforests of Ecuador.

299
00:58:00,417 --> 00:58:02,126
The air steams in the heat.

300
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:14,876
Here, the Sun and plants conspire
to create their own unique weather.

301
00:58:17,584 --> 00:58:19,459
And is the same practically every day.

302
00:58:25,917 --> 00:58:29,126
This afternoon,
that's going to help one of its smallest

303
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:33,001
and most beautiful inhabitants
in a surprising way.

304
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:43,251
The racket-tailed hummingbird
is about the size of your thumb.

305
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:52,834
It takes a lot of energy
to look this graceful.

306
00:58:58,126 --> 00:59:01,709
That means it's living
in a perpetual state of near starvation.

307
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:11,292
In fact, its metabolism is so fast,
it needs to fuel up on nectar,

308
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:13,209
over a thousand times a day.

309
00:59:20,709 --> 00:59:22,459
It can't stop feeding for a moment.

310
00:59:24,334 --> 00:59:26,292
All day is a race against time.

311
00:59:55,376 --> 00:59:58,834
The racket-tail isn't the only one
hunting for nectar in the forest flowers.

312
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:03,209
Bees are too,
and they don't like to share.

313
01:00:07,626 --> 01:00:11,459
A single bee sting,
close to the bird's heart, could be fatal.

314
01:00:36,709 --> 01:00:39,126
But time, is on the racket-tail's side.

315
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:43,251
Rain is about to intervene.

316
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:51,834
The heat of the afternoon sun,
has built massive thunder clouds.

317
01:00:58,584 --> 01:01:01,917
And when they can no longer
hold their burden, they break.

318
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:23,584
Above the canopy, the rain is torrential.

319
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:33,084
Under the shelter of layers of leaves,
the deluge is reduced to drips.

320
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:47,334
A raindrop as big as its head,
may not be much fun for a hummingbird.

321
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:56,917
But it's altogether too much, for a bee.

322
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,876
The race to eat, continues.

323
01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:45,751
All over the world, tiny creatures
are on a mission to stock up before night.

324
01:02:52,626 --> 01:02:56,417
In a European meadow, there's a great
deal of food hidden in the plants.

325
01:02:58,167 --> 01:02:59,376
For those who can reach it.

326
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:15,292
As the day begins to fade,

327
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:19,251
this tiny harvest mouse,
must gather as much fuel as possible.

328
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:39,167
Her best chance for a good dinner,

329
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:42,792
are the seeds and fruit,
at the tips of the tallest stalks.

330
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:52,042
But, it's the most dangerous part,
of her tiny world.

331
01:04:12,876 --> 01:04:15,501
A barn owl, is a night-time hunter.

332
01:04:25,584 --> 01:04:27,042
But this one has woken early.

333
01:04:28,876 --> 01:04:29,876
And hungry.

334
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:54,834
The world at ground-level is bewildering
for a mouse used to the high life.

335
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:20,126
But she can read the pattern
of the stems overhead, like a map.

336
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:32,751
Which is just as well,
because back home...

337
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:35,501
she's needed.

338
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,459
The light is dying.

339
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:17,334
But new life is being born.

340
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,126
A mayfly emerges.

341
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:40,251
It will live for just this day.

342
01:06:46,626 --> 01:06:49,667
Or less, if it doesn't move fast enough.

343
01:07:07,251 --> 01:07:09,292
When life is as perilous as this...

344
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:16,376
nature finds safety in numbers.

345
01:07:20,251 --> 01:07:22,626
This hatch, on the Tisza River in Hungary,

346
01:07:23,334 --> 01:07:25,917
is one of the world's
great wildlife spectacles.

347
01:07:33,709 --> 01:07:36,251
Having spent three years
as nymphs in the river,

348
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:41,084
up to five million of these
remarkable insects emerge together,

349
01:07:42,584 --> 01:07:44,542
on just this stretch of water alone.

350
01:07:52,626 --> 01:07:55,459
They'll never feed.
They don't even have mouths.

351
01:07:56,584 --> 01:08:02,042
Instead, as soon as they hatch,
they begin a vast glittering mating dance.

352
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:18,834
Every day on Earth is amazing.

353
01:08:20,084 --> 01:08:24,709
But surely the mayfly's day,
is one of the most amazing of all.

354
01:08:30,834 --> 01:08:35,417
By nightfall, they will have met,
mated, laid their eggs, and died.

355
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:39,084
The future entrusted
to the next generation.

356
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:51,376
Their entire adult life will be spent
in just a few hours of a single day.

357
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:15,876
Day, is now spinning swiftly,
towards night.

358
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:23,792
The Sun slips, ever lower in the sky.

359
01:09:28,501 --> 01:09:30,209
It is a time of great beauty...

360
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,917
and grave danger.

361
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:45,542
In the cool evening shadows,
is the best time to be a predator,

362
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:49,042
and the worst time to be prey.

363
01:09:57,542 --> 01:10:02,251
For a zebra and her foal, this
is the most dangerous time of the day.

364
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:49,417
A cheetah has his eye on the foal.

365
01:11:49,001 --> 01:11:52,751
Sometimes a mother's love...

366
01:11:52,834 --> 01:11:54,667
Can be a match for almost anything.

367
01:12:10,126 --> 01:12:14,292
As the day fades,
the shadow world is taking over.

368
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,626
In the Changzhou mountains,
in Southwest China,

369
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:25,042
the world is turning its face
away from its nurturing star,

370
01:12:26,126 --> 01:12:28,459
towards the chilly emptiness of space.

371
01:12:34,334 --> 01:12:38,709
Here, white-headed langurs
are taking their last meal of the day.

372
01:12:43,584 --> 01:12:45,792
They're amongst
the rarest creatures on Earth.

373
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:48,959
Rarer, even than the giant panda.

374
01:12:54,751 --> 01:13:00,376
But when daylight disappears,
this is no place to linger.

375
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:26,334
They are obeying an ancient
and overpowering instinct.

376
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:45,959
With the lengthening of the shadows,
they scramble for height and refuge.

377
01:13:54,917 --> 01:13:56,709
The route is precarious.

378
01:13:57,751 --> 01:13:59,667
It's not unknown for a langur to fall,

379
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:02,917
or baby be dropped.

380
01:14:11,959 --> 01:14:16,417
Yet, despite the risks,
the langurs never stay out after dark.

381
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:54,834
Even the babies feel it,
and know to fear it.

382
01:14:58,417 --> 01:14:59,667
Night is coming.

383
01:15:02,209 --> 01:15:04,417
The world no longer belongs to them.

384
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:15,751
It belongs to another set of players.

385
01:15:17,959 --> 01:15:19,709
The creatures of darkness.

386
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:55,209
The night can turn a friend
into a deadly foe.

387
01:17:00,876 --> 01:17:02,001
During the day,

388
01:17:02,542 --> 01:17:07,667
whitetip sharks are content
to cruise gently around the reef alone.

389
01:17:16,751 --> 01:17:17,876
But when night comes,

390
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:23,542
they're transformed
into hunters working in packs.

391
01:17:31,542 --> 01:17:33,751
In the gloom,
the shark's eyesight is poor.

392
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:40,584
But they can smell
potential prey from far off.

393
01:17:44,501 --> 01:17:45,917
And they have another advantage.

394
01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:51,001
A sixth sense, that can pick up
the tiny electrical signals

395
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,459
from the heartbeat of a frightened fish.

396
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:58,167
And track it down.

397
01:18:04,626 --> 01:18:07,376
Even the deepest shadow,
is no hiding place.

398
01:18:57,292 --> 01:19:00,084
Darkness is not just
a time for nightmares.

399
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:05,459
But also for dreams and wonders.

400
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:32,792
Energy stored
from the sunlight is recycled.

401
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,626
And the world lights up again.

402
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:03,376
Some creatures use their lights for love.

403
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:10,209
For this male click beetle,

404
01:20:10,626 --> 01:20:15,417
his glowing spots are designed
to impress and attract a mate.

405
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:21,626
And seeing the glow from this fungus,
he thinks he's found one...

406
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:23,667
hidden inside.

407
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:31,834
But the fungus is playing a trick on him.

408
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:35,251
The glow comes from the fungus itself.

409
01:20:42,251 --> 01:20:43,959
Puzzled, he searches everywhere.

410
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:48,084
And gets covered in fungal spores.

411
01:20:53,334 --> 01:20:55,626
He'll spread them wherever he goes next.

412
01:20:56,376 --> 01:21:01,834
Not reproducing himself,
but helping reproduce the fungus instead.

413
01:21:09,501 --> 01:21:13,417
A light in the dark,
can also be a deadly trap.

414
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:24,959
In New Zealand,
glow-worms cling to the roof of a cave.

415
01:21:27,709 --> 01:21:31,876
They shine out their strange lights
from within circles of hanging silk,

416
01:21:32,542 --> 01:21:33,792
sticky with mucus.

417
01:21:43,834 --> 01:21:46,917
Tiny flies are drawn
to the beautiful lights.

418
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:53,459
Only to become glued
to the dangling strands and trapped.

419
01:21:55,251 --> 01:21:57,626
Later, they'll be reeled in for supper.

420
01:22:13,709 --> 01:22:16,751
And the night brings magic,
on a much grander scale.

421
01:22:24,042 --> 01:22:26,251
The sky seems to come alive.

422
01:22:49,584 --> 01:22:53,084
Even when the sun is out of sight,
it makes its presence felt.

423
01:22:57,084 --> 01:23:01,126
Its electrical energy powers a firework
display that lights up the planet.

424
01:23:05,542 --> 01:23:06,542
The Aurora.

425
01:23:34,334 --> 01:23:36,251
And there is another light show on Earth.

426
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:39,542
One powered by us.

427
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:47,584
We no longer have to wait for sunrise.

428
01:23:49,626 --> 01:23:52,042
We no longer
need to be afraid of the dark.

429
01:23:54,376 --> 01:23:57,834
In our cities, we've created
an endless electrical daylight of our own.

430
01:24:10,876 --> 01:24:13,501
We've broken away
from the rhythm of night and day.

431
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:26,626
As more and more of us live this way,

432
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:30,501
it's easy for us to forget
our connexion to the natural world.

433
01:24:32,084 --> 01:24:33,917
Even, when it's on our doorstep.

434
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:57,126
These raccoons in Toronto
seem just as home in the city, as we are.

435
01:25:27,709 --> 01:25:30,334
Not all creatures can adapt
so easily to our world.

436
01:25:32,417 --> 01:25:34,334
But we humans can do something to help.

437
01:25:36,626 --> 01:25:40,334
We have the ability to appreciate
what no other animal on Earth can.

438
01:25:43,334 --> 01:25:47,751
If we open our eyes,
we can see the magic all around us.

439
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:52,417
The extraordinary in the everyday.

440
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:07,917
We can see the fragile web
that connects us with all living things.

441
01:26:11,001 --> 01:26:13,751
And understand that the future
of all life...

442
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:16,042
lies in our hands.

443
01:26:36,376 --> 01:26:39,334
We have searched
the far reaches of space for wonders.

444
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:46,959
But instead, we found the most wonderful
things of all, back home.

445
01:26:50,126 --> 01:26:52,251
Here, on our lucky planet.

446
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:57,917
Small and blue,
spinning in an ocean of stars.

447
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:10,959
In the whole universe, as far as we know,

448
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:14,501
there's nowhere else with life.

449
01:27:15,876 --> 01:27:17,251
Nothing more extraordinary...

450
01:27:18,584 --> 01:27:19,626
Than planet Earth.

451
01:27:21,334 --> 01:27:24,709
Nothing more important to protect
than our one and only home.

452
01:27:26,834 --> 01:27:32,542
And nothing more amazing
than what happens here, day after day.
