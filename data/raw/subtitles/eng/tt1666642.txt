get over here.

It has just
been forever.

169

Mother! Mother!

170
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,882
You remember
Parker and Abigail.

171
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:06,842
Yes.

172
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,808
Hey, Rach!
Rachel! Hey!

PARKER: Hey!
ABIGAIL: Hey!

174
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:17,811
Did you change
your e-mail?

175
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,273
I've been trying to
get a hold of you.
I'm sorry. I...

176
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,860
Oh! Oh, my goodness,
y'all don't even know
why I am here.

177
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:25,986
These are
my bridesmaids.

178
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,822
Yup. I'm getting married!

179
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:31,950
To a groom or a chair?

180
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,871
Oh, you and
your little quips.

181
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:36,246
You know, the wedding's
in 10 days.

182
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,250
And I so wanted to
invite y'all,

183
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,752
but Mother said
she couldn't find
your addresses anywhere.

184
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,171
I'm sure if you called
Parker's parents...

185
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,715
What's that, Parker,
like 30 years
in the same house?

186
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,048
I'm sure they could
have told you.

187
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,886
Oh, gosh!
Well, of course! Mother.

188
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,431
Goodness me,
you're right.

189
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:54,973
Next time, huh?

190
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,018
Oh, oh, oh,
let me introduce you
to everyone.

191
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,144
Rachel
you know of course.

192
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,688
And these are my other
super bridesmaids.

193
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,231
Bitsy, Ashley
and Ashlie.

194
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,941
Oh, you're not
hearing double.

195
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,860
They're both really
named Ashley.

196
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,737
I spell it "ie" and
she spells it "ey."

197
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,696
Some people
get confused.

198
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,780
ASHLIE: But not us.
Right, Ash?

199
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,240
You got it, Ash.

200
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,575
(WOMEN GIGGLING)

201
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,117

look at that ring.

Oh, yes.

204
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,832
So, Rachel,
you're a bridesmaid.

205
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,250
I so wish I could come
to the wedding.

206
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,753
I could meet Tony.
He's going to
be there, right?

207
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,462
BITSY: Say "cheese."

208
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,631
Uh, yes.

209
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,508
Oh, is that him?

210
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,592
I recognize him
from your PhotoBox.

211
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,009
Nice, sister.

212
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:33,178
OLIVIA: There's
our gorgeous groom.

We have been waiting
for you!

bridesmaids, groomsmen,
let's get this lunch moving.

216
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,022
CAITLYN: Oh, you, stop.

217
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,608
Someone has a game
he wants to catch at 3:00,
hmm?

Excuse me
for a moment.

221
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,459
All right, y'all.
Let's go.

222
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,253

OLIVIA: Gregory, dear...
Oh, my goodness.
So good seeing y'all.

224
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,925
Close your mouths.

225
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,344
Rachel an old
friend of yours?

226
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,930
And I'm guessing
you haven't talked to
her in a while.

227
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,266
So, yeah, that's the Tony
that Rachel used to
go out with.

228
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,060
Although we can't
officially acknowledge
that ever happened.

229
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,770
So, this is me
not acknowledging.

230
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,314
You're Henry Kent.
You used to have big ears
and a slutty sister.

231
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,234
I grew into my ears.

232
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,319
And I'll tell Carol
you said hi.

233
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,071
Thank you.

234
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:33,572
I don't remember you.
Really?

235
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,451
We only had
Bio together twice and
I asked you to prom.

236
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,536
What?
No, I'm just kidding.

237
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,037
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
I was two years older

238
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,124
and I spent most of
high school tripping
over my ears.

239
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,043
So, you still live
in Lambert?

240
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,129
Yeah, still live
in Lambert.

241
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,256
I'm sorry, no,
I didn't mean it
like that.

242
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,007
Yeah, you did.
Yeah, you did.
Let's go find Rach.

243
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,508
Okay.

244
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,134
See you around.
Bye.

245
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,760
Cute!
I know.

246
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,725
Now, you two
just have to stay
for the wedding.

247
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,602
Oh, we would love to,

248
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,729
but I have
this big audition.

249
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,689

re-curl my weave.

Listen to you.

you want to come
to this wedding.

would just adore
to have you.

dating Tony
for like ever.

he was the one.
What happened?

266
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,845
Yeah, why the hell
didn't you call us?

been mad and
yelled at me.

didn't she?

No, no.
Caitlyn's a good friend.

272
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,899
After all, she asked me
to be her bridesmaid.

273
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,859
And why did you
say yes?

274
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:53,985
Because I was
brought up well.

what are you gonna do?

that I'm completely and
totally over Tony Penning.

It really wasn't even
worth my time.

338
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,042
You wanted it bad,
didn't you?
So much.

339
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,752
Yeah, I know.
Here, babe,
take this,

340
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,003
and I'll get
some more for me.

341
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,800
WOMAN ON TV:
<i>Well, how was I supposed</i>
<i>to know, silly?</i>

342
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,135
<i>A girl's not a mind reader,</i>
<i>you know.</i>
MAN:<i>  Darling...</i>

343
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,805
PARKER: How could
Rachel and Tony
have mucked this up?

344
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,097
They were perfect
for each other.

345
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,057
You never met him.
I'm highly intuitive.

346
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,892
They were meant
for each other,

347
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,229
and now Tony is
gonna marry Caitlyn.
<i>(BRIDAL MARCH</i>  PLAYING ON TV)

348
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:34,979
And Rachel's gonna have
her heart broken forever.

349
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,314
(SWITCHES OFF TV)

350
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,108
Three thousand years of
watching romantic comedies

351
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,443
and it's just
one big stinking lie.

352
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,111
I mean,
the couple stumbles
around for two hours

353
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,614
and then miraculously,
five minutes before
the credits roll,

354
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,615
they realize that
they're meant
to be together?

355
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,283
(LAUGHS)

356
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,245
That is not how
life works, my friend.

357
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,371
Action movies
have it right.

358
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,831
You hate
action movies.

359
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,541
I hate them
because they're right.

360
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:58,586
In action movies,
some psychopath takes
25 sweet people hostage

361
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,587
and he's gonna
kill 'em all.

362
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,048
And then
Bruce Willis...
Or Denzel.

363
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,675
Also good.
He puts together
an elite SWAT team

364
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,969
of Navy SEALs,
and they go behind
enemy lines

365
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,428
and they do
what has to be done.

366
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,138
They wipe out
the henchmen,

367
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,723
the psychopath dies
a spectacular death,

368
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,850
and the sweet people
go free.

369
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,810
That's what you need
to make love work,

370
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,353
a ruthless SWAT team
with guns.

371
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,107
Gavin still
hasn't called yet?
No.

372
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,066
He went to LA
for pilot season

373
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,442
with his cute
scene partner...

374
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,152
BOTH: ...that he swears
he's not sleeping with. Ha!

375
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,154
You should not
date actors.

376
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,489
Who else do I meet?

377
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,241
Oh, you met that
really cute guy
Henry today.

378
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,826
And he liked you.

379
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,577
No. He did not like me.

380
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,498
Okay, yeah,
he did like me.
But he is a trap.

381
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,876
There's like 300 of them
in every hometown.

382
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,335
Nice, regular guy,
unpretentious.

383
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,545
You go out on
one date

384
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,589
and all of a sudden
you wake up 10 years later

385
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,800
with six kids, a fat ass,
and ugly pink sweatpants.

386
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,261
You like him.

387
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,179
You really, really
like him.

388
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,306
(STAMMERS) I do not.

389
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,807
What are you going to do
when he calls?

390
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,018
He's not going to call
because nice guys
don't call me.

391
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,354
Just selfish actors who
screw their scene partners.

392
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,981
And what are we going
to do about Rachel?

393
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,024
I say we go
full bore SWAT team

394
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,859
and break up
Caitlyn and Tony.

395
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:03,651
Okay, no more
wine for you.

396
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,112
No, I'm serious, right?

397
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,447
That's what Will Smith
or Matt Damon

398
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,658
or any of those
hot action guys
would've done.

399
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,286
We sneak into the compound,
we bust stuff the hell up.

400
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,331
What are we gonna do,
disguise ourselves
as German officers?

401
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,374
Exactly.

402
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,502
(CHUCKLES) All right.
What the hell
are you talking about?

403
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,464
I'm saying,
we wear the uniform
of the enemy.

404
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,716
Bridesmaids.

405
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,051
She already has
her bridesmaids.

406
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,762
Okay, then two of them
"have a little accident."

407
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,597
Parker,

408
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,350
if anyone deserves to be
knocked down a couple
of pegs, it's Caitlyn.

409
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,052
Rachel had one thing
she loved in life
and Caitlyn took it.

410
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,981
Are you really gonna
let her get away
with that?

411
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,149
Do you really think
we could take down
Caitlyn?

412
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,069
And do you think
we could stop
this wedding?

413
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,487
We can do anything. Why?

414
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,031
Because we're
sophisticated babes
from New York.

415
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,699
Or as Miss Olivia
would put it,

416
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,743
"You girls are just
a little too thinky."

417
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,535
All right.

418
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,996
I'm starting to like it.

419
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:58,998
Caitlyn is going down.

420
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,042
Yes!

421
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,460
The Thinky Girls
are back.
Yes!

422
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,295
To love.
To Rachel.

423
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,546
To the defeat of
the Third Reich!

424
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,464
(BOTH LAUGHING)

425
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,687
Mmm.
Girls, you're so right.

426
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,940
This is the best
frozen yogurt
in all of Lambert.

427
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,900
Told you.

428
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,029
Aren't you glad
you called us?

429
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,030
So glad.

430
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,033
We owe you Ashleys.
We really owe them.

431
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,787
Yeah, but what can
we give them that
they don't have?

432
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,874
(SIGHS) Huh... Well...

433
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,875
How's it going up
at the house?

434
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,004
You guys getting along
with Olivia?

435
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:46,963
It's okay.

436
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,007
Yeah. Not so bad.

437
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,009
Ashleys! Come on.
We're yogurt pals now.

438
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:52,844
Share.

439
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,138
We can't do
anything right.

440
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,890
She's always
on our case.

441
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,267
And she treats us
like we're big dopes.

442
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,393
Can you believe that?

443
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,689
This is how
we can help them.

444
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,648
You mean
our secret Olivia tip?

445
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,359
You're right.
Yeah, she always liked us.

446
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,444
Really?

447
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,862
Look, girls,
you have to understand.

448
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,574
I mean, Olivia's
under a lot of
pressure right now,

449
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,658
wedding
and everything.
BOTH: Uh-huh.

450
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,035
Is she drinking?

451
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:17,160
Yes. Constantly.

452
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,122
That's what happens.
ABIGAIL: Yeah,
here's the trick.

453
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,707
When she's drinking,
tell her to slow down.

454
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,627
Like, in front
of everybody?

455
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:26,961
That's the only way
it works.

456
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,757
What we used to do
is we would count her drinks
and then we'd let her know.

457
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,008
Mmm-hmm.

458
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,552
PARKER: She'd always
thank us in the morning.

459
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,344
We could do that.
Yeah, we could.

460
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,763
Do it, you'll be golden.

461
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,098
How's the frozen yogurt?

462
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,224
It's really cold.
(LAUGHS)

463
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,643
If I eat it too fast,
my brain freezes.

464
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,603
(BOTH ASHLEYS CHUCKLE)

465
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,645
How can you tell?

466
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,692
And the trap is set.

467
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,319
Their poor frozen brains
never stood a chance.

468
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,072
Well, you pick up
a few skills when
you live in the big city.

469
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,199
How the world works.

470
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,200
Oh, my God,
they're towing
my mom's car!

471
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:57,742
No! Hey!

472
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:00,703
Hey, what are you doing?

473
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,417
Where did that
come from?

474
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,002
Been up there
for about three years.

475
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,464
Okay, well, we didn't
know 'cause we don't
live here anymore.

476
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:11,881
We live in New York City.

477
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,056
Hey, Dougie,
how's it going?

478
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,559
Livin' the dream, Henry.
How about you?

479
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,144
I'm good.
Can you give me a sec?

480
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:26,729
(SIGHS)

481
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,399
There's your boy.
Okay.

482
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,859
(INAUDIBLE)

483
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,445
My mistake.

484
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,739
It turns out
you can park here

485
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,574
if you're back in town for
your parents' anniversary.

486
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:40,910
So cute.
Okay.

487
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,123
So cute.

488
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,001
Hi.
Hi.

489
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,052
You know, I think I lost
something somewhere.

490
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,263
I'm gonna go look for it
in case I did.

491
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,182
I like your friend.

492
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,935
How did you do that?

493
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,812
I pulled a thorn
out of his paw
a few years back.

494
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,232
Or I'm a cop and
Dougie owes me a favor.

495
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:11,899
You're a cop?

496
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,652
Wow, that sounded awful.
I'm...

497
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,530
Let me try that again.

498
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,531
Oh, so you're in
law enforcement?

499
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,159
That sounds like
very important work.

500
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,618
That wasn't
much better either.

501
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,871
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

502
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,038
I like seeing
you rattled. It's cute.

503
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,041
So, listen, Parker...

504
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,710
Look, I...

505
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,253
I think you're
really nice

506
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,671
and I so appreciate
what you just did
right there,

507
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:34,922
but I don't think
it would be smart for...

508
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,132
Take it easy.
Nobody's asking
anybody out.

509
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,967
Oh.

510
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,010
Just wanna say
be sure you read

511
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,304
all of our small-town
parking signs,

512
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,931
and you have
yourself a safe trip
back to the big city.

513
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,267
Okay?

514
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,813
That's it?

515
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,321
My mother's
great grandfather
built Bellefontaine

516
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,488
with his own
two hands.

517
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,576
Oh, Mr. Woodward,
it would be such
an honor

518
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,911
to have it grace
the cover of your magazine.

519
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,580
Now, I'm just
writing the article,
Miss Caitlyn.

520
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,124
I can't
guarantee you a cover.

521
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,709
Well, I see there are
no weight restrictions

522
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,336
on the brides
you feature.

523
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,880
That gown must've
taken all the lace
in England that year.

524
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,340
That's the Governor's
niece you're referring to.

525
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,258
She has a lovely
complexion.

526
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:20,927
Mmm.

527
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,055
(CLEARING THROAT)

528
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,556
Did you know,
Mr. Woodward,

529
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,142
that all the bridesmaids
are living here
at Bellefontaine

530
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:28,768
right up until
the wedding?

531
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,230
And staying at such
a magnificent home,

532
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,857
why, it's like living
in a fairyland.

533
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,025
(ALL CHUCKLING)

534
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:38,736
(WHISPERS) Now you.
Oh, yes.

535
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,532
You know, all the girls
are staying right here
at Bellefontaine

536
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:43,824
up until the wedding.

537
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:49,747
I said that part.
And um...

538
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,250
Snowglobe.
Yes.

539
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,837
This home is so beautiful,
isn't it?

540
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,005
It's like an idyllic scene
in a snowglobe.

541
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,340
Oh!

542
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,592
That is so sweet
of you to say.

543
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,261
More sherry, anyone?

544
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,095
Oh, yes, precious,
I believe I will.

545
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:05,721
Number three!

546
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,808
I beg your pardon?

547
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,142
Oh, that's your
third glass of sherry.

548
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,852
Actually,
it's her fourth.

549
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,187
She had a little nip
in the kitchen.

550
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,689
But I think
that was scotch.

551
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,733
What are you doing?

552
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,818
Helping.

553
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,194
We know you're under
a lot of pressure,

554
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,655
and we certainly don't
want to see you
get hammered

555
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,198
like you did
Wednesday night.

556
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,491
When you fell
into the duck pond.

557
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:25,649
And told the gardener
your hedge needed trimming.

558
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,955
So, we'll be here
counting your drinks
every day.

559
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,331
And night,
when you really
go to town.

560
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,917
How thoughtful of you.

561
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,879
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

562
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,970
I think those girls
gave us bad advice.

563
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,888
Boy, I think
you're right.

564
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,449
Well, apparently,
some of Caitlyn's
old rivals

565
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,410
were pulling some
silly sorority stunt.

566
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:12,621
(LAUGHING) Oh,
why thank you, Mr. Woodward,
I knew you'd understand.

567
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,042
So, we'll see you
and your photographer
tomorrow morning?

568
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,294
Wonderful. Okay.
Bye, now.

569
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,962
Oh! Mama!

570
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,757
(EXCLAIMING)
Fantastic news!

571
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,383
Abby and Parker have
changed their plans.

572
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,927
Because of me!
They're going to stay
in town for the wedding.

573
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,429
Isn't that
just the best?

574
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,097
Mmm.

575
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,015
Oh, don't worry,
we'll sit in the back.

576
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,516
We're not going to
make a peep.

577
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,018
PARKER: Yeah,
we don't even need
to be in the photos.

578
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,644
(LAUGHING) It's not like
we're bridesmaids
or anything.

579
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,854
Oh, my gosh.

580
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,231
Lightbulb!

581
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,817
What if you
were bridesmaids?

582
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,319
No!
I mean, it would...

583
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,904
Yes!
It would be a dream
come true.

584
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,781
PARKER: Yeah.

585
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,199
Caitlyn, may I have
a word with you?

586
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:51,952
(GIGGLES)

587
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,125
(WHISPERING)
They are not
bridesmaid material.

588
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,627
Mom, it's okay.

589
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,797
Listen to me...
It's my wedding and
I want my bridesmaids.

590
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,756
(CLEARING THROAT)

591
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,092
Mama has something to say.

592
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:06,884
Yes.

593
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,304
Mother?

594
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,808
We would be
honored if you would...

595
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,438
Oh, for gosh sakes.
You're my new bridesmaids!

596
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,524
No way!

597
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,149
Yay!
Shut up!

598
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,111
Yes, yes, yes!
Amazing!

599
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,572
PARKER: Okay, here we are.

600
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,244
Got cherubs?

601
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,580
There's something
I've learned in life,

602
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,957
you can never have
too many cherubs.

603
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:43,170
All right, Sarge,
we're behind
enemy lines. What's next?

604
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,755
Why are you asking me?

605
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,090
Because you're the plotter.

606
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,591
Didn't<i>  Publishers Weekly</i>
call you inventive?

607
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,635
"Abigail Scanlon
is in full command
of her narrative."

608
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,096
I will give you that one.

609
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,059
All right, break up
the couple. Break up
the wedding couple.

610
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,646
(GASPS) I got it!
You sleep with the groom.

611
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,898
Huh, yeah. We help
our friend Rachel

612
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,316
by me sleeping
with the love
of her life.

613
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,902
Hey, I never said
there wouldn't be
any casualties.

614
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,781
(GASPS) Uh...
You sleep with Caitlyn.

615
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,200
Why do all of your plans
have me sleeping
with someone?

616
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,118
Is this how you see me?

617
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,661
A little bit.

618
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,246
All right. Well,
if Tony's like most guys,

619
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,082
me and Caitlyn
in bed together
will not be a deal breaker.

620
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,584
I wonder where
they have Rachel stashed?

621
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,753
Probably in the
"Ha, ha, stole
your boyfriend" room.

622
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,671
No, she's
in the Persimmon Room.

623
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,214
How do you know?

624
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,717
Oh, it's right here,
under "Room Assignments"

625
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,260
in the<i>  Bridesmaids' News.</i>

626
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:32,845
Oh, of course.

An in-home published
newspaper about
your very own wedding.

628
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,808
Guess who made
the cover? Caitlyn.

629
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:40,227
You know,
I really think that
we're over-thinking this.

630
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,604
If we want to get
Rachel and Tony
back together,

631
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,190
well, let's just get
Rachel and Tony
back together.

632
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,858
We can fix her up a bit,

633
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,569
boost her confidence,
and then throw 'em
in a room together.

634
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:51,614
They were cooking before.
Come on, let's turn up
the flame a little bit,

635
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,865
and then I do not
have to sleep
with anyone.

636
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,283
You okay with that?

637
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,494
Oh, behold!
The Persimmon Room.

(GASPS) What are
you guys doing here?
How'd you get in?

640

We're the new bridesmaids.

641
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,463
Really?
Does Olivia know?

642
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,882
OLIVIA: Yes, she does.

643
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,176
Is there something wrong
with your room, girls?

644
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,845
No, I just wanted to
check out the
Persimmon Room.

645
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,974
It's clearly stated in
the newsletter that
lights out is 11:00 p.m.

646
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,351
A curfew?
Are you kidding me?

647
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:24,230
(CHUCKLING)
By which she means,
"Yes, ma'am."

648
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:24,939
Good night then, Rachel.

649
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:28,567
Good night.
Good night.

650
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:30,611
It's off to bed.
Mmm-hmm.

651
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,325
I know why you're here.
I know exactly
what you're planning.

652
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,120
You think being
a bridesmaid
is a little game.

653
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:42,665
You're here to
laugh at our expense.

654
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:47,086
No, we take
what we're doing here
very seriously.

655
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,672
Yeah, like we're
on a mission or something.

656
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,592
This wedding
is in eight days.

657
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:58,639
I expect you to honor
the sacred trust that Caitlyn
has bestowed upon you.

658
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,932
We do understand
each other, don't we?

659
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,769
Yeah.
Good.

660
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:04,436
Well, I'm glad
we've had this little talk.

661
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,982
Now you two girls
get to bed.

662
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,400
You need your beauty sleep.

663
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,235
Especially you, Abigail.

00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,432
No dinners out.
No men upstairs.

845
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:23,810
Too bad.
I'm just trying to get
a little background

846
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,021
on the woman
I'm walking down
the aisle with.

847
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,735
New York actress.
Gone next Monday.

848
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,112
(BELL TINKLING)

849
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,491
You two, let's go.

850
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,658
Plenty of time
to hit on her

851
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:39,576
when you're tanked
at the reception.

852
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,039
Thank you.

853
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,960
CHARLOTTE: Oh, dear,
I don't know.

854
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,048
Livvy, the dress
was made
for one of those

855
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,217
shapely Ashley girls
you discarded.

856
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,969
This bony child
has no rump at all.

857
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,346
Where's your bottom, dear?

858
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,682
Charlotte, this girl
is as good as
we can get.

859
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,644
We're just gonna
have to soldier on.

860
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,521
Pin, my dear,
till your hands bleed.

861
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:12,484
Uh, hey, excuse me.
I don't think that
this dress fits anybody.

862
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,487
Ah, a woman built
to bear children.

863
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,572
Excuse me?

864
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,951
If only there was a way
of transplanting some of
your womanly abundance

865
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,286
to the one
built like a little boy.

866
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,372
A boy? Have you not
seen these babies?

867
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,999
Charlotte, she's going to lose
10 pounds by the wedding.

868
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,502
I'm sorry.
Why don't you try
to alter the dresses

869
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,087
instead of the bridesmaids?

870
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:35,173
Abigail, dear Abigail.

871
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,174
You're going to be
standing in front of

872
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,509
hundreds of people
next Saturday.

873
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,136
You don't want them
looking at you

874
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,180
and recalling that
hateful nickname
they used to have for you.

875
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,015
What was it again?

876
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:44,683
Flabigail.

877
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,519
(GASPS)

878
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,478
Young people
can be so cruel.

879
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,067
(SIGHS)

880
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:01,783
(CLATTERING)

881
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,713
Soup? Are you
frickin' kidding me?

882
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,633
Figured I'd find you
down here.

883
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:22,846
They moved everything.
Everything.

884
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,348
This cabinet...
This cabinet used to be
full of cookies.

885
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:31,146
Always. Even the
Little Debbie cakes
with the pink wrapper.

886
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,356
I could count on it.

887
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,442
And now
she's starving me
for 24 hours,

888
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,861
and what does she give me
in my happy cabinet?
A frickin' can of tomato soup!

889
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,114
You know what?

890
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,617
Fine.

891
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:49,789
(SLURPING) Mmm.

892
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:52,250
It's not that bad.

893
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:54,753
Can I buy you a round?

894
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,587
No.

895
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:02,219
Flabigail.

896
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,430
She really put
the knife in on that one.

897
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,559
Well, pull it right back out.
She was just trying
to get to you.

898
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,395
One word and that sad
little 12-year-old girl
was back.

899
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,481
But now you're beautiful.

900
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,942
And you're a very
successful New York writer.

901
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,610
Who's hitting
her head up
against the wall

902
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:21,738
because she has
not one idea
for her second novel.

903
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:22,697
Not one. Nothing.

904
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,450
I'm blocked, I'm spent,

905
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,955
I'm a has-been
after one book.

906
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:30,872
Cold spaghetti?

907
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:31,790
Give it to me.

908
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,710
Mmm.
Mmm-hmm. Nuh-uh.

909
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,087
Okay.

910
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:41,091
Remember when
we used to sneak down
that secret passageway

911
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,592
and make snacks
for movie night?

912
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,386
(LAUGHS) Always
the same snacks,
right?

913
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,264
It was s'mores
and pink lemonade.

914
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,431
And always the same movie.

915
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,183
BOTH:<i>  An Officer</i>
<i>and a Gentleman.</i>

916
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,894
For two years,
that's the only movie Caitlyn
would ever let us watch.

917
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:55,397
Oh, my God, that's it.

918
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,567
Okay,
Caitlyn's not pregnant.

919
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,737
Ready?
<i>Officer and a Gentleman,</i>

920
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,864
Lisa Eilbacher
pretended to be pregnant

921
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,742
so that David Keith
will marry her.

922
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,996
Caitlyn is Lisa Eilbacher.
Oh, it's so obvious.

923
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,666
She went to
Dr. Wallach, Abigail.
She got a test.

924
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,667
No. Mmm-mmm.
I don't think she did.

925
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,168
I think Caitlyn is lying.

926
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,545
Okay, you might need
a little proof of that.

927
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,839
I'll get you some proof,
Little Miss Skeptical No Butt.

928
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,925
We move at dawn.

929
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,468
Let's get going,
we need our sleep. Let's go!

930
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:26,428
And I need my spaghetti.

931
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:28,763
Oh, yeah.

932
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:31,850
PARKER: Oh!

933
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,485
KELTON: Well,
good morning, bridesmaids.

934
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,946
What are you ladies up to?

935
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,532
Uh, we were just
gonna go into town.

936
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:48,992
Yeah, I need to
run an errand.

937
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,660
You know,
Miss Olivia doesn't like
people driving off,

938
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:51,828
doing their own thing, now.

939
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:52,829
I need tampons.

940
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,041
Well, have a good day.

941
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:03,882
ABIGAIL: Bye!

942
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,637
Hi, how are you?

943
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,347
Come on.

944
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,730
Hi, we're here from, uh...

945
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:21,816
Filex Cabinets.

946
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,317
Uh-huh.

947
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,904
Yes. You obviously
got the recall notice.

948
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,322
The what?

949
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,908
The recall notice, sweetheart.
Don't you read the news?

950
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,370
Yeah, a lot of
our filing cabinets
have been collapsing.

951
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:37,290
Apparently the titanium
brackets have a little
too much alloy in them.

952
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:37,749
Yeah, way too much.

953
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,628
These cabinets
were purchased
after 1970?

954
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,754
Um, I started here in June.

955
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,840
Then we need to
check those, don't we?

956
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:50,887
Okay. Let's go.
(DOOR BUZZING)

957
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,140
I'm gonna pick
a file at random.

958
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,683
You know what,
how about "M"?

959
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,436
"M." Middle letter.
Very wise.

960
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,232
Oh, my God.
Those glasses are so cute.

961
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,608
Thank you.

962
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:04,401
They must have been
really expensive.

963
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,819
No, I bought them online.

964
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,278
$20.

965
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:11,116
Get out of here!
Would it be okay
if I tried them on?

966
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:12,826
Oh.

967
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:14,285
Thanks.

968
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,291
Oh. Wow, they're so comfy.
How do I look?

969
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,587
Blurry.
I can't see a thing
without my glasses.

970
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,923
(BOTH LAUGHING)

971
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,967
Have you ever tried contacts?

972
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,761
Because, you know,
your eyes are really pretty.

973
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,556
Oh, I did,
but don't they hurt?

974
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,890
Beauty is pain, girlfriend!

975
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:37,851
(EXCLAIMING ANGRILY)
She's pregnant!

976
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:42,981
That's just an expression
that we use to mean

977
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:47,485
that this cabinet is
crazy full and
it's about to go.

978
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,362
So, we need to
get that report in
right away.

979
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,281
Absolutely.
Okay.

980
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:51,948
Here are your glasses.
Thank you.

981
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,537
Stay clear of those.

982
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,041
(PARKER LAUGHS)

983
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,924
Lab report
with urine test.

984
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,427
"McNabb comma Caitlyn.
Bun in oven."

985
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,012
What about
<i>An Officer and a Gentleman?</i>

986
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,974
Just like every other
romantic movie, okay?
It let us down.

987
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,523
ALL: Mmm. Mmm.

988
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:28,818
That was the orange ginger.

989
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,949
Bitsy, don't copy off me.

990
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,203
I wasn't!

991
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,288
Girls, do I have to
separate the two of you?

992
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:42,707
This next one
is red velvet.

993
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:43,917
Very daring
for a wedding.

994
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,172
What do you think, honey?

995
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:49,339
It's really good.
I like it.

996
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:54,302
Men. Put food
in their mouths
and that's all they need.

997
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,679
Not all. At least not
in my experience.

998
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:57,347
Which is no doubt
extensive.

999
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:02,519
You like it? Sweetheart,
that's what you said
about the last three.

1000
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,397
I like cake. All cake.

1001
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,565
Cake and me,
we just get along.

1002
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:13,947
Tony-Bear, participate.

1003
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,948
Come on, we need
an opinion from the groom.

1004
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:25,792
Look, Caitlyn,
I'm doing what
everybody wants here.

1005
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:26,209
It's just cake.

1006
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,506
Yes, you do like milk
with your cake.

1007
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,091
Why don't you go
get some milk, hmm?

1008
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:33,883
I think I will.

1009
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,220
He's just getting
some milk.

1010
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,810
OLIVIA: Well, if he's
going to have milk,

1011
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:44,352
I think we should all
have a sherry.

1012
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,229
Mmm.

1013
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,236
Oh. Uh...
Oh.

1014
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,696
Sorry. Bye.

00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:58,304
Look, Henry,

1182
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,680
I leave for New York
the day after the wedding.

1183
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,141
And there's not much time.
And I sort of have this rule

1184
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:03,434
where I don't
sleep with a guy

1185
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:03,809
until I've known him
for three weeks.

1186
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,019
Parker?

1187
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,479
Yeah?

1188
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:07,021
It's just dinner.

1189
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,026
Although, if I happen
to find myself in New York

1190
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,695
in, I don't know,
exactly three weeks, then...

1191
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,417
Hey!

1192
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:30,795
How was the date
with the cop?

1193
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,546
Did he frisk you?
Did he find anything?

1194
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,464
It was awful.

1195
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:36,634
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I thought that was solid.

1196
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:39,804
No, he's great.
Possibly better than great.

1197
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,223
And he likes me.
Oh, God.

1198
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:46,227
Well, why don't
you stick around
and see what happens?

1199
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,395
Because I live
in New York City.
My career is there.

1200
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,564
Which I don't even have.

1201
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,900
I didn't tell you this,
but my agent, Alice,
dumped me yesterday

1202
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:54,819
in an email
which she signed
"Love." (LAUGHS)

1203
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:57,113
So I'm going home
to nothing

1204
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,532
and I'm leaving
this adorable guy here.

1205
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:02,535
Olivia has me
so carb-starved

1206
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,620
that if you put
your sweet hand
on a kaiser roll,

1207
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:05,913
I'd eat it in three bites.

1208
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:09,959
Out of the two of us,
who do you think
is more pathetic?

1209
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,544
I need BAND-AIDs.

1210
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:14,505
We were scrapbooking
last night and I got
all these paper cuts.

1211
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:16,006
We have a winner.

1212
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,884
(SIGHS) What a
super morning it is!

1213
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,177
I just saw a redbird
outside my window.

1214
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,515
You know, Bitsy.
I hope we all
stay in touch

1215
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,057
when this week is over.

1216
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,770
Girls, breakfast
is on the patio,
not in the kitchen.

1217
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:31,522
Is Caitlyn out there?

1218
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,317
No. Our bride-to-be
is not feeling at all
well this morning.

1219
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,186
I thought I heard her
throwing up. Is she okay?

1220
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,405
Well, these things happen.

1221
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:40,573
Mmm, morning sickness.

1222
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,158
Oh, yeah.

1223
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:45,661
Or somebody and her
maid of honor were
up late last night

1224
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:46,787
doing<i>  mucho, mucho</i>
tequila shots.

1225
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,041
Pregnant girls
don't do tequila shots.

1226
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:54,211
Unless they're
not pregnant.

1227
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:05,347
Bitsy, you need
to tell us the truth.

1228
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,267
Mmm-mmm.

1229
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:11,061
It'll be much easier
on you if you just talk.

1230
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,021
Anything yet?
No.

1231
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:14,023
Not gonna happen.

1232
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,403
Oh, what is this?

1233
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:20,863
(GASPS) Ooh!

1234
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,741
Oh, my.

1235
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,410
Those are mine!
Where did you get those?

1236
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:27,786
From your room.
Is that cashmere?

1237
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:28,746
I think so.

1238
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,998
And there's not
a spot on it.

1239
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,875
It would be a shame
if anything happened to it.

1240
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:33,542
Don't you dare.
Mmm!

1241
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:34,501
(GASPS)

1242
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,920
What do you got there,
Abigail?

1243
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:39,298
You know, just a few things
that spill on fine garments.

1244
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:40,382
Like

1245
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,427
marinara sauce.

1246
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,386
Club soda.
Gets it right out.

1247
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:49,225
Soy sauce.

1248
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:49,934
(GASPS)
White vinegar and peroxide.

1249
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:00,152
Oh, well, look
what I have here.

1250
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:00,945
Mmm.

1251
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:04,114
Fruit preserves.
And I think that's... (SNIFFS)

1252
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,616
Yeah, that's blueberry.

1253
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,827
You wouldn't.

1254
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,100
(GASPS) She's not pregnant,
she never was!

1255
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,726
Please don't
hurt my sweaters.

1256
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,605
Okay, but what about
the pregnancy test?
We saw the lab results.

1257
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:37,439
That was my sister's urine.

1258
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,317
Muffy married
an Irish Catholic guy,
so she's always pregnant.

1259
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,737
Caitlyn asked me
to get a cup
of her pee, so I did.

1260
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,701
Please don't tell her
I blabbed.

1261
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,953
We're Gamma Kappa Nus.
Forever.

1262
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:56,333
It's okay, Bitsy. It's over.

1263
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,042
Can I go now?
Sure.

I can't believe it.

1266
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:10,014
Caitlyn lied about
being pregnant to trick
Tony into marrying her.

1267
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:15,019
That bi...
That...

1268
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,062
Say it.
Yeah, it'll make
you feel good.

1269

No, I can't.
I just can't.

How about right now?
He's here.

1280

We'll distract Caitlyn,
and you go tell Tony.

1281

Me tell him?
I don't think I can.

1282

After what
she did to you?

After what
she did to us?

Yeah, you're right.
I'll tell him.
I have to.

Okay. Here goes.

1286
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,681
I'm taking my life back.

Three days out
in the woods.

No laptops,
no cell phones,

1294
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:15,287
no strippers,
thank you very much.

1295
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:16,622
So when are they
gonna be back?

1296
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:20,376
Just right
before the wedding,
which is fine by me.

1297
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:22,127
All he has to do is shave
and put on a tux.

1298

Men are not
very complicated,
are they?

1299
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:43,982
I got it. Why don't we
just find out what river
they are on,

1300
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:45,943
rent a canoe
and some maps and stuff,

1301
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,570
and just hunt them down?

00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:52,574
Excellent. A plan
that utilizes our vast

has to be exactly right.

you went through.

Mmm-hmm.

Ooh, I just
got chills.

1349
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:01,662
Yes, is this the
florist in charge of
the McNabb wedding?

1350
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,790
Who am I?
Caitlyn.
You can do Caitlyn.

1351
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,461
Well, this is
Miss Caitlyn McNabb,
bride-to-be.

1352
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:10,796
I would like to make
a few changes to my
floral arrangements...

1353
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,591
I would never
order lilies.

1354

six years old...

1355

they do to her?
Her eyes water.

1356
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,390

awful hives
all over my body.

Mother and I think
a white tent
is just so blah,

1359
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:29,898
so I was wondering
if you had anything

1360

I dreamed about, Mother!

we will find it.

This is Olivia Warburton
from Bellefontaine.

1367
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:52,838
Are you the woman in charge
of the ice sculptures
in my Caitlyn's wedding?

1368
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,216

What, honeybelle?

1371
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,639
Is there some
little something
that they got wrong?

1372
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,354
That's not so little.

1373

to be a baby cupid,

their umbrellas on him.

01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:52,396
What? Oh, where did all
the ideas come from?

1856
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:55,774

You know,

1857
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:57,985

of me constantly.

1858
01:25:58,028 --> 01:25:58,527
I can't stop it.

1859
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:57,877
(INAUDIBLE)
