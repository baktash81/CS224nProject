1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,712
# <i>There is a lonely road
That runs from Ixopo #</i>

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,350
<i># Into the hills #</i>

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,193
<i># These hills are grass-covered
And rolling #</i>

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,799
<i># And they are lovely
Beyond any singing of it #</i>

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,509
<i># About you there is grass and bracken #</i>

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,358
<i># And you may hear
The forlorn crying of the titihoya bird</i> #

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,953
<i># The grass of the veld is rich and matted
You cannot see the soil #</i>

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,200
<i># The grass holds the rain and mist #</i>

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,153
<i># They seep into the ground
Feeding the streams in every dove #</i>

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,552
<i># The clove is cool #</i>

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,119
<i># And green #</i>

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,038
<i># And lovely beyond any singing of it #</i>

13
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,476
<i># Where you stand
The grass is rich and matted #</i>

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,916
<i># But the rich green hills break down #</i>

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,073
<i># They fall to the valley below #</i>

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,310
<i># And failing change #</i>

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,597
<i># For they grow red and bare #</i>

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,956
<i># They cannot hold the rain and mist #</i>

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,112
<i># The streams run dry in the doves #</i>

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,112
<i># Too many cattle feed an the grass #</i>

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,957
<i># It is not kept or guarded or and for #</i>

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,352
<i># It no longer keeps men, guards men #</i>

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,749
<i># Cares for men #</i>

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,469
<i># The titihoya #</i>

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,192
<i># Cries here no more #</i>

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,718
<i># The great red hills stand desolate #</i>

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,993
<i># And the earth has torn away like flesh #</i>

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,309
<i># These are the valleys
Of old men and old women #</i>

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:48,238
<i># Of mothers and children #</i>

30
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,598
<i># The men are away #</i>

31
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,160
<i># The young men and the girls are away #</i>

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,715
<i># The soil cannot keep them #</i>

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,717
<i># Anymore</i> #

34
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,477
You got your Latin grammar
to study on the train?

35
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,959
Yes, Grandfather.

36
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,598
How are you getting on
with your other subjects?

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,590
Very well.

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,751
- Geography, do you like that?
- Yes.

39
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,559
- Now, you remember, you write to me. Hmm?
- Yes, I will.

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,756
You promise? That's a good boy.

41
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,512
There's Stephen Kumalo.

42
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,590
- I won't be a moment.
- Arthur?

43
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,830
Yes?

44
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,797
I don't know what the customs are now
in Johannesburg.

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,473
They may have changed since I was there.

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,679
But in our village, one does not go
out of one's way to speak to a black.

47
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,277
I have friends among the Zulus, Father.

48
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,639
And my friends are my friends,
both in Johannesburg and elsewhere.

49
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,790
Then speak to him in Johannesburg.

50
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,949
<i># Johannesburg! Johannesburg! #</i>

51
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,316
<i># Johannesburg! Johannesburg! #</i>

52
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,836
# <i>Train go now to Johannesburg #</i>

53
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,515
<i>- # Farewell! Go well! #

54
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,956
<i># Train go now to Johannesburg #</i>

55
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,316
<i>- # Farewell! Go well! #
- # Farewell! Go well! #</i>

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,233
<i># This boy we love, this brother #</i>

57
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,316
<i># Go to Johannesburg #</i>

58
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,790
<i># White man go to Johannesburg #</i>

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,191
<i># He come back, he come back</i> #

60
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,875
<i># Black man go to Johannesburg #</i>

61
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,918
<i># Never come back, never come back #</i>

62
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,153
<i># Black man go to Johannesburg #</i>

63
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,956
<i># Go, go, never come back #</i>

64
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,191
<i># Go, go, never come back #</i>

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,751
<i># White man go to Johannesburg #</i>

66
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,151
<i># He come back, he come back</i> #

67
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,152
<i># Black man go to Johannesburg #</i>

68
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,835
<i># He never come back
He never come back #</i>

69
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,434
Mr. Kumalo?

70
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,193
Ah, Mr. Jarvis!

71
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,476
Beg your pardon.
Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Excuse ma.

72
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,509
You're making a journey, Reverend?

73
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,919
To Johannesburg, sir.

74
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,559
It is my first long journey anywhere.

75
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,030
- I... I go to find my son.
- To find him?

76
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,998
Well, it is nearly a year
since we had a letter from him.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,832
Letters can be lost.

78
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,589
He's been in the mines.

79
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,150
I'm told that no young man
works in the mines and does not change.

80
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,913
Oh, Johannesburg is a big city, <i>mfundisi.</i>

81
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,630
Well, my sister, Gertrude, is there,
and my brother, John.

82
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,233
I will go there first.

83
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,679
Well, I do hope you find your son.

84
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,470
It's always a pleasure to see you, sir.

85
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,312
Perhaps when you come again to Ndotsheni...

86
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,231
Yes, yes. I won't forget.

87
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,113
<i>Stay well, mfundisi.</i>

88
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,155
Go well, sir.

89
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,955
John?

90
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,109
What is <i>it, mfundisi</i>?

91
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,237
Have I changed so much, my brother?

92
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,758
The old gospel bird,
scratching round here in the big city.

93
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,717
Stephen!

94
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,278
Ah, Stephen. Ah...

95
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,039
Gertrude's boy.

96
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,269
Come here, son.

97
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,350
Come here.

98
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,238
<i>Alex, the mfundisi</i> is <i>your uncle.</i>

99
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,199
Alex.

100
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,238
Ah. Gentlemen, my own brother,
my mother's son, has come.

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,676
Gentlemen, we will conclude the deal
tomorrow at William's.

102
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,437
Come, brother, come, come.

103
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,439
I must take a look at you, Stephen.

104
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,312
You get much rain down your way this year?

105
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,557
Oh, less than we needed, John.

106
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,439
Ah, well. But you must pray.

107
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,511
And you must pray more.

108
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,039
Tell me, where is our sister, Gertrude?

109
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,391
She's gone.

110
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,236
Gone?

111
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,595
Brother, I don't know whether it was you

112
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,876
that sent our dear sister
to Johannesburg or not,

113
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,838
but if it was, it was a big mistake.

114
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,270
Uh...

115
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,677
She came to find her a husband.

116
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,358
She found plenty husband.

117
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,550
Stephen.

118
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,840
There is a new thing
that is growing in Johannesburg.

119
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,429
And you people in the country,
you don't understand the way life is here.

120
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,910
How is life different here, my brother?

121
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,154
Stephen, in Johannesburg, it's the mines.

122
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,630
Everything is the mines.

123
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,675
The new buildings, the city hall.

124
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,478
Wonderful new hospital.

125
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,914
The rich mansions.

126
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,036
All built with gold from the mines.

127
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,031
But when gold is found,
it's not we that get more for our labor.

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,479
They bring us in from the bush,

129
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,270
and we dig, dig, dig underground,
for three shillings a day.

130
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,990
And from our wages, they take a heavy tax.

131
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,591
But what would a man like you
from Ndotsheni,

132
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,717
who falls on his knees and prays,
know about things like that?

133
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,151
We in Johannesburg, we know.

134
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,917
What should be done with our sister's boy?

135
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,031
Take him back to your hills

136
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,873
and your sheet-iron chapel
and your rusty God.

137
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,275
Money.

138
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,434
Money is the Tixo here in Johannesburg.

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,637
There is one thing more I must ask.

140
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,359
Where is my son, Absalom?

141
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,598
Gone, with my son, Matthew.

142
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,156
They left together?

143
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,315
I threw them out.

144
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,636
Where are they?

145
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,876
I hear they got a room in Sophiatown.

146
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,154
They work in a factory there.

147
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,910
Do you know the factory?

148
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,836
Yes, I do. I have a paper outside. Come.

149
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,909
Doornfontein Textile Company.

150
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,953
14 Krause Street.

151
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,273
You have a telephone. May I call?

152
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,315
Why?

153
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,076
To ask if Absalom Kumalo works there?

154
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,279
Perhaps you want them
to bring him to the telephone.

155
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,311
They do not do such things
for black men, my brother.

156
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,629
Thank you.

157
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,560
Good-bye, John.

158
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,676
Stephen.

159
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,754
Your sister's boy.

160
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,309
Good-bye.

161
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,990
You old faker in Christ.

162
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,356
Yes, he did work here, you know.

163
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,233
But he left a few months ago now.

164
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,874
Could you tell me where he went?

165
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,676
7723rd Avenue, Alexandra.

166
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,875
Thank you, sir.

167
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,389
Come, Alex.

168
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,395
# <i>How many miles to the heart of a son?</i> #

169
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,794
<i># Thousands of miles, thousands of miles #</i>

170
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,752
<i># When he lay on your breast
He looked up and smiled #</i>

171
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,676
<i># Across tens of thousands

172
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,516
<i># Each lives alone in a world of dark #</i>

173
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,471
<i># Crossing the skies in a lonely arc #</i>

174
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,518
<i># Save when love leaps out #</i>

175
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,673
<i># Like a leaping spark #</i>

176
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,438
<i># Over thousands, thousands of miles</i> #

177

00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,396
Yes, mfundisi. He's been paroled.

199
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,997
Partly because of his good behavior
and partly because of his age.

200
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,915
But mainly because
there's a girl pregnant by him.

201
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,279
- Is he married?
- No, <i>mfundisi.</i> Pregnant and unmarried.

202
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,395
Do sit down.

203
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,151
Look,
he's promised me that he'll work hard

204
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,514
to support the child and its mother.

205
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,793
He's living with the girl
in, um, Pimville.

206
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,910
- Pimville?
- Shanty Town.

207
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,276
The streets are...
Well, they're pretty hard to get about in.

208
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,710
I'd have to take you.

209
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,270
Mr. Eland, could you go tonight?

210
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,839
<i>No, not tonight, mfundisi</i>.

211
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,878
But if you could be here
early tomorrow morning.

212
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,558
Oh, yes. Thank you.

213
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,757
Alex. Alex.

214
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,995
Alex.

215
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,274
Absalom. I woke up. The bed was empty.

216
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,759
1 thought you had run away.

217
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,915
Where would I run?

218
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,759
Come home.

219
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,795
Home?

220
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,959
Shanty Town.

221
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,475
Filth.

222
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,953
Nothing. That is home.

223
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,033
<i>Weep the house dean.</i>

224
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,029
Nobody can keep Shanty Town clean.

225
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,034
Go home.

226
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,270
Irina.

227
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,113
I have never been able
to bring you a gift.

228
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,153
[don't need gifts.

229
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,152
Never enough to live on.

230
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,150
Even... the way we live.

231
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,154
A shop. That's what I want.
A shop, just like my uncle's.

232
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,478
But where could you get the money?

233
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,549
I'll get it.

234
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,269
You won't steal again?

235
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,395
I'll get it.

236
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,599
But, Absalom,
if they catch you one more time,

237
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,399
they're gonna put you in a prison
for your whole lifetime.

238
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,434
Goddamn this world.

239
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,189
Uncle Stephen?

240
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,356
Yes, Alex?

241
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,998
This room is small and it's not clean.

242
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,238
Well, it's the best they had.

243
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,040
Are we going to live here?

244
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,954
Oh, no. You will live in Ndotsheni,
in the country.

245
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,189
In my home.

246
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,999
What will our house be like?

247
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,234
Oh, it's small and it's gray.

248
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,674
Is there grass?

249
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,394
Yes, and flowers.

250
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,915
Why is it gray?

251
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,199
- What?
- The house.

252
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,834
Well, because it has not been painted.

253
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,116
Do you have to boil the water
from the tap?

254
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,274
No, no, Alex.

255
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,153
We get water from a spring.

256
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,794
There's a tree that my son used to climb.

257
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,352
He liked to sleep in it.

258
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,079
- Like a nest?
- Yes, like a nest.

259
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,679
Come, sit here.

260
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,874
<i># There's a lime gray house #</i>

261
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,158
<i># In a one-street town</i> #

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,313

263
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,995
<i># And the steps run down #</i>

264
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,712
<i># And you prop up the window #</i>

265
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,714
<i># With a stick on the sill #</i>

266
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,834

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,916
<i># From the bottom of the hill #</i>

268
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,357

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,274
<i># Grows in the yard #</i>

270
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,793

272
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,873

276

<i># It's a lung road, God knows #</i>

277
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,038
<i># A long and turning iron road

279
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,356

281

<i># That house again #</i>

284
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,959
<i># There's a lamp in the road #</i>

285
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,397
<i># And it lights the face #</i>

286
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,837

287
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,674

333
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,159
<i># He dug so deep and he dug so well #</i>

334

348
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,040
Did you bring the gun?

349
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,476
Listen. The white man never
lock his doors, day or night.

350
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,430
- Why not?
- He say, "Anybody want what I've got,

351
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,313
he can come and take it away."

352
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,715
That's what he say.

353
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,396
Then why do we need a gun
when we go there?

354
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,475
Because nobody ever knows when he's gonna
need a gun, and you've got the gun.

355
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,509
But Jo... Johannes says
there won't be anybody there.

356
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,238
The white man went for a trip somewhere,

357
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,913
and the servant gets home late
every night.

358
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,434
Hey, man. Look...

359
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,992
That's the way we <i>think</i> it's gonna be.

360
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,076
What happens if somebody comes in?

361
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,639
We don't wanna take any chances.

362
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,509
- Matthew!
- Right with you, baby.

363
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,230
- What do you say?
- I think it's better without the gun.

364
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,674
I don't, see?

365
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,869
Look.

366
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,639
We get to the new gold fields
that just opened.

367
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,474
If you want to help us
raise the money to get there,

368
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,799
we'll take you along.

369
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,835
You're in.

370
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,554
But if you're scared to carry
that cheap revolver of yours,

371
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,513
you're no use to us at all.

372
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,312
Bring it or stay home.

373
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,509
Eat your cookies.

374
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,954
Johannes!

375
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,917
Think it over, country boy.

376
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,074
I'm on parole. You're not.

377
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,199
Listen. You're just going to be
one more black boy in the gold field.

378
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,997
They never find you. Come on.

379
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,198
Change your name, man.
New clothes. Cash in your pocket.

380
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,396
There'll be no more Absalom Kumalo.

381
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,914
Irina?

382
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,156
Irina?

383
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,390
Irina?

384
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,879
This is the Reverend Stephen Kumalo,
Irina. Absalom's father.

385
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,516
He's come to Johannesburg to find Absalom.

386
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,040
He's not here.

387
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,829
Where is he, then?

388
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,749
I do not know.

389
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,751
He-He did not come home last night.

390
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,874
I do not know where he is.

391
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,194
Has he left you?

392
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,276
Maybe.

393
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,871
Could I be alone with her a moment?

394
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,794
- Irina?
- Yes, mfundisi?

395
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,159
Perhaps my son never spoke of me to you.

396
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,315
We love him very much, his mother and I.

397
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,189
Do you believe that?

398
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,389
<i>Yes, mfundisi.</i>

399
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,356
He has lived here with you for some time?

400
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,190
<i>Yes.</i>

401
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,871
You were not married in the church?

402
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,750
No.

403
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,638
And you are to have a child.

404
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,635
<i>Yes.</i>

405
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,394
Why has he left you?

406
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,159
There is no money.

407
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,558
Do you have a family?

408
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,152
Have no one.

409
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,913
But you lived somewhere
before you met Absalom?

410
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,314
Sophiatown.

411
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,800
Alone?

412
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,594
Nobody lives alone in Sophiatown.

413
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,475
You lived there with your first husband?

414
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,672
Yes. My first.

415
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,840
How many have there been?

416
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,514
There have been three.

417
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,674
Three.

418
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,717
And now you will seek a fourth?

419
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,911
No, I wait for Absalom.

420
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,790
No. You would go to anyone.

421
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,520
I think you would do anything.

422
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,037
I'm an old man, Absalom's father.

423
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,713
You would come to me if I asked you.

424
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,276
- No!
- Yes.

425
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,032
<i>You</i> think <i>an mfundisi</i> is not a <i>man?</i>

426
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,997
What if I desired you with my whole body?

427
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,033
What if I desire you now?

428
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,234
That would not be right.

429
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,751
Was it right before with the others?

430
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,189
No.

431
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,149
Then why would you not be willing with me?

432
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,354
I do not know.

433
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,960
Then you would be willing?

434
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,069
Would you be willing?

435
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,752
Speak. Tell me.

436
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,149
I could be willing.

437
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,909
<i>Yes.</i>

438
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,316
You are a woman who could go to anyone.

439
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,594
Why did you come here?

440
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,949
How would I know what you want
or what you think?

441
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,920
I don't...

442
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,477
I'm to have a child.

443
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,790
Your Absalom is gone.

444
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,558
I love Absalom.

445
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,116
He has brought me trouble, but...
I love Absalom. I love Absalom.

446
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,679
- Please, please forgive me.
- I love Absalom.

447
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,513
- I should not have put you to such a test.
- Absalom! Absalom!

448
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,670
Will you forgive me?

449
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,196
We all do what we must do.
Not what we wish but what we can.

450
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,555
I am searching for my son.

451
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,519
- Absalom!
- If I find him, I'll come and tell you...

452
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,194
Absalom. Absalom.

453
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,676
- My Absalom,
- I'll write my address on this paper.

454
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,237
If... Please.

455
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,074
If... If he comes back to you,
please let me know.

456
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,599
Oh, no. Absalom.

457
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,273
Absalom.

458
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:42,515
<i># Since you first came to me

Where's the gun?

501
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,917
- What do you want?
- We want money and clothes.

502
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,509
You're Johannes!

503
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,198
- I know you too. You cannot...
- You want to die, old man?

504
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,349
Master! Master!

505
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,673
Richard!

506
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,671
Get out! Get out of here. Move, quick!

00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,994
I have bad news for you, Mr. Jarvis.

525
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,430
- Bad news?
- From Johannesburg.

526
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,190
Is it my son?

541
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,831
<i>It's not proved yet, mfundisi</i>.

542
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,035
The charge is that he shot Arthur Jarvis?

543
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,269
<i>Yes.</i>

544
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,110
- Where is he?
»In prison.

551
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,520
My son.

552
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,514
My father.

553
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,034
- At last, I have found you.
- Yes.

554
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,672
I've searched for you, and...

555
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,158
in every place, and I...

556
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,514
I find you here.

557
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,713
Why have they charged you
with this terrible crime?

558
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,914
Answer me.

559
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,877
Oh, Father! My father.

560
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,510
My son!

561
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,632
If only I had come sooner.

562
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,158
But when this trouble is over,
you will come back to Ndotsheni

563
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,878
and be content in our quietness.

564
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,919
You were a boy without guile
and without anger...

565
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,354
Oh, my father!

566
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,589
Yes?

567
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,916
Yes?

568
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,554
I cannot say!

569
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,112
Son, I know you so well that I...

570
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,390
1 know you could not be guilty
of these crimes.

571
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,150
You need not fear what the judge will say.

572
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,390
You will live again at Ndotsheni.

573
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,399
[shall never come home.

574
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,280
Why, my son?

575
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,718
Because I am guilty.

576
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,273
Of what, my son?

577
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,038
I killed the white man.

578
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,879
Th-This cannot be true. He...

579
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,871
- He was shot in his house.
- Yes.

580
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,553
There are three men accused in his murder.

581
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,918
- You are shielding someone.
- No, sir.

582
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,631
We were there.
Matthew Kumalo, Johannes Pafuri, and I.

583
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,998
Johannes struck the servant,
and it was I who carried the revolver.

584
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,477
And you killed this man?

585
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,077
I did not mean to kill him.

586
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,152
We thought he would not be there.

587
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,515
Suddenly, he was there,
and I was frightened and...

588
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,476
My son.

589
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,391
I stand here and see you.

590
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,358
And a kind of dizziness
comes over me so that...

591
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,789
I'm not sure what is real
or whether this is...

592
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,797
a true place or in a dream.

593
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,674
Did you tell me...

594
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,831
you, my son, Absalom...

595
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,713
that you had killed a man?

596
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,195
<i>Yes.</i>

597
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,029
That is the truth.

598
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,514
But why?

599
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,195
Answer me.

600
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,151
We needed money to go to the gold fields.

601
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,914
That is no answer...
to steal, to take a life.

602
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,310
You... You were not taught this.

603
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,833
What is your answer?

604
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,275
Father. It's in the air we breathe.

605
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,114
The life we live.

606
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,199
Here, we have nothing. We are nothing!

607
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,395
Absalom!

608
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,753
This earth is yours.

609
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,869
This air, this life.

610
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,396
You are Kumalo. This you were taught
as I was and my father before me.

611
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,755
Father, you do not understand.

612
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,357
Here, we live like cattle.

613
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,433
My son,
our fathers atoned before tribal law.

614
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,158
But we know salvation is in truth,
as I have taught you, and it is...

615
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,073
I'm sorry, mfundisi.
It's time for you to go.

616
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,715
My son.

617
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,636
My son.

618
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,276
Stay well, my son.

619
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,678
Go well, my father.

620
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,200
No, no, no.

621
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,316
Stephen!

622
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,438
Brother, we must get a lawyer.

623
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,033
A lawyer. Why?

624
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,919
The story is plain.

625
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,990
What is the story?

626
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,433
They went to a house
they thought was empty...

627
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,233
struck down the servant,

628
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,993
and when the white man appeared,
my son shot him.

629
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,873
My brother, perhaps you do not need
a lawyer after all.

630
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,039
Will you get Matthew a lawyer?

631
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,237
And Johannes Pafuri.
You see, my brother...

632
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,916
there was no proof that my son, Matthew,
or Johannes were there at all.

633
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,909
But there is an identification
by the servant.

634
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,558
And my son says they were there.

635
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,272
Well, when a lawyer get through with that,
maybe not.

636
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,910
The only one that the servant identified
was Johannes.

637
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,433
They said he knew him by his eyes.

638
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,439
With his face covered up.

639
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,511
It would be very hard to be sure that
it was Johannes Pafuri, wouldn't it?

640
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,476
And our lawyer will bring it up in court.

641
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,437
He'll shake that servant up plenty.

642
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,033
And there's no other evidence.

643
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,795
There's no other evidence
that they were there,

644
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,119
positively not.

645
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,793
Except that they were there.

646
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,632
They will have to say they were there.

647
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,869
But why, my brother?

648
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,554
Because it is the truth.

649
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,119
And the court will recognize the truth.

650
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,269
The truth?

651
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,795
My God, man. Why should your son
tell the truth in a white man's court?

652
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,518
Does he want to get himself hanged?

653
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,109
You listen to me, Stephen.

654
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,311
My son, Matthew, and Johannes Pafuri
are going to plead not guilty.

655
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,355
I'll get them off.

656
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,273
You'd better tell your son, Absalom,
to keep his mouth shut,

657
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,154
or I'll fix him myself.

658
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,596
Speak to him. Speak to him.

659
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,592
I have. He will plead guilty.

660
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,639
Stephen, a man who pleads guilty to murder
get the punishment of first degree.

661
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,757
That's hanging, with a sack over his head.

662
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,195
Stephen, if you want Absalom to live,

663
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,117
please, tell him to plead not guilty.

<i># Grief is your gift to me #</i>

<i># Grief alone #</i>

701
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,276
<i># Wild passion at midnight #</i>

702
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:22,200
<i># Wild anger at dawn #</i>

703
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,392
<i># Yet when you're absent #</i>

704
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,119

00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:22,394

716
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,230
<i># And since with you #</i>

717
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,952
<i># It will remain #</i>

718
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:38,150

719
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,198
<i># Despair of heaven #</i>

720
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:48,036
<i># Stay well #</i>

721
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:55,117
<i># Come well to my door #</i>

722
00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:01,355
<i># Again #</i>

723
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,674
Irina?

724
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,000
<i>Mfundisi.</i>

725
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,198
The trial begins tomorrow.

726
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,109
Do you wish to be there?

727
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,074
Yes, yes.

728
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,833
<i>Mfundisi.</i>

729
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,479
Will he go free?

730
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,634
He says that he will tell the truth,
that he will plead guilty.

731
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:31,151
If he does, I think that he will
stay in prison for a long time.

732
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,559
- A long time?
- Many years.

733
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,155
Would you be willing to wait for him
for many years?

734
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,554
Yes, I would wait.

735
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,672
Would you wish to marry him in prison...

736
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,354
so that your child will bear his name?

737
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,990
Does he wish it?

738
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,309
<i>Yes.</i>

739
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,999
Then I wish it.

740
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,836
<i>Mfundisi.</i>

741
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,229
Will they kill him?

742
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,189
Nothing is sure.

743
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,194
But I want him to live.
I want him to come back to me.

744
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,919
# <i>When the first judge sat in his place</i> #

745
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,639
<i># And the murderer held his breath #</i>

746
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,314
<i># With fear of death in his face #</i>

747
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,630
<i># Fear of death for death #</i>

748
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,589
<i># And all that could be said
For or against was said #</i>

749
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,114
<i># And the books were balanced #</i>

750
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:44,069
<i># And two, not one, were dead</i> #

751
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,276
<i># Was justice caught in this net? #</i>

752
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,718

753
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,118
<i># No, not quite yet #</i>

754
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,513
<i># Not yet #</i>

755
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,392
<i># Often when I was young #</i>

756
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,909
<i># It was my father who said

759
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,750
<i># But I heeded him not at all #</i>

760
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,515
<i># Like rain, I ran through his hands #</i>

761
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,834
<i># Concealing as a boy will #</i>

762
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,354
<i># Taking what was not mine #</i>

763
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,556
<i># Evading commands #</i>

764
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,916
<i># For I seemed to hear none of his words #</i>

765
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,479
<i># Turning and shifting, I ran #</i>

766
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,711

767
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,712
<i># 'fill I was lost to his sight #</i>

768
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,317
<i># And ran far into evil and evil ways #</i>

769
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,119
<i># And was struck at and struck back #</i>

770
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,235
<i># And I was loved #</i>

771
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,835
<i># And I was desperate with love
And fear and anger</i> #

772
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,753
<i># And at last, I came to this #</i>

773
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,034

777
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:34,393
<i># To the death of a man #</i>

778
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,554

799
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,910

01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,470
<i># "It shall not profit a man #</i>

01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:14,317
<i># Help me #</i>

808
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,075
Johannes.

809
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,591
You have been identified
as one of three masked men

810
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,557
who entered the kitchen of Arthur Jarvis

811
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,154
on October the 8th
between 11:00 and 12:00.

812
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,718
Were you there at that time?

813
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,917
No, sir, I never been this place.

814
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,910
Where were you?

815
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,631
At Mrs. Ndela's in End Street.

816
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,037
How do you know
you were there at eleven o'clock?

817
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,480
Because we were at a place dancing
till nearly 11:00.

818
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,999
And at 11:00, we were at Mrs. Ndela's.

819
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,597
Who else was there?

820
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,313
Matthew Kumalo was there.

821
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,436
And the girls, Linda and Rose.

822
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,234
The witness is excused.

823
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,759
Will Matthew Kumalo take the stand?

824
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,478
Matthew Kumalo, you are accused

825
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:18,675
of being one of three masked men
who entered the kitchen of Arthur Jarvis

826
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,274
on October the 8th
between 11:00 and 12:00.

827
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,037
- Were you there at that time?
- No, sir.

828
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,919
- Where were you?
- Mrs. Ndela's house in End Street.

829
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,992
- You're sure of the time?
- Yes, sir.

830
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,799
We had been dancing
at a place in High Street.

831
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,359
Then we went to Mrs. Ndela's house.

832
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,197
We got there,
she said, "Come in. You're late."

833
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,560
We saw it was near 11:00.

834
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,635
Do you know Absalom Kumalo?

835
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,272
Yes, sir.
He is the son of my father's brother.

836
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,552
Was he with you that evening?

837
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,475
No, sir.

838
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,674
- Do you know where he was?
- No, sir.

839
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,399
The witness is excused.
Will Absalom Kumalo take the stand?

840
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,829
Absalom Kumalo...

841
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,113
you are accused of being
one of three masked men

842
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,077
who entered the kitchen of Arthur Jarvis

843
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:23,154
on October the 8th between
11:00 and 12:00 in the evening.

844
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,990
Were you there at that time?

845
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,880
Yes, sir.

846
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,477
Who were the two masked men with you?

847
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,874
Matthew Kumalo and Johannes Pafuri.

848
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,278
What was your purpose in going there?

849
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,392
- To steal something from the house.
- But why did you choose this day?

850
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,870
Because Johannes said that the house
would be empty at that time.

851
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,030
The same Johannes Pafuri here?

852
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,235
Yes, sir.

853
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,794
Tell the court what happened.

854
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,192
We went into the kitchen,
and there was a servant there.

855
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,276
This man was afraid. He saw my revolver.

856
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,035
He said, "What do you want?"

857
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,309
Johannes said,
"We want money and clothes."

858
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,190
This man said,
"You cannot do such a thing."

859
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,838
Johannes said, "Do you want to die?"

860
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,437
And this man called out, "Master. Master."

861
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,193
And Johannes struck him
over the head with the iron bar.

862
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,872
A white man came into the doorway.

863
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,955
I was frightened.

864
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,799
I fired the revolver.

865
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,480
The white man fell.

866
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,839
And what did you do next?

867
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,035
I prayed.

868
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,753
How did the police find you?

869
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,519
Johannes Pafuri brought them
to where I was.

870
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,399
And what did you tell the police?

871
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,676
Exactly that which I have just told you.

872
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,555
And every word you have said is true?

873
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,915
Every word of it.

874
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,269
There is no lie in it?

875
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,479
There is no lie in it.

876
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,079
For I have said to myself...

877
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,953
I shall not lie anymore,
all the rest of my days.

878
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,599
And I have finished with evil.

879
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,550
1 have no further questions,
Mr. Charmichael.

880
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,078
The witness will step down.

881
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,429
<i>Mnumzane.</i>

882
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,953
I have been waiting for you.

883
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,036
Yes?

884
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,749
Would you intercede for my son?

885
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,877
If you do not help,
he will die for his truthfulness.

886
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,879
Have you thought of what it is for me
that my son is dead?

887
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,279
I have tried. I...

888
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,071
Have you thought what it is
for his mother?

889
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,994
She will die of this. It's in her face.

890
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,199
I see the face of my son's mother. I...

891
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,830
Oh, I know what this is to you, but...

892
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,709
if he were only to live,
even shut up, even far from us.

893
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,232
He grew up in Ndotsheni.

894
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,554
There was no evil in him there.

895
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,749
He could see from our house
up through the clove to your great house.

896
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,800
Your son was a friend of my people.

897
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,309
Th-This would not have happened
if it were not for the gold mines

898
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,470
and the great city
your people have built and...

899
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,636
And the little hope we have...

900
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,473
Parson.

901
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,437
There are two races in South Africa.

902
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,111
The difference between us is greater
than that I live on a hill

903
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,554
and you live in the valley.

904
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,915
If my son had killed your son,

905
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,558
1 would not have come to you for mercy.

906
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,877
Whether it was my son or yours, I would
have said, "Let him answer to the law."

907
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,235
But... you could save him.

908
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,673
<i>Mfundisi.</i>
You have not heard or understood me.

909
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,879
Those who will not keep order
must be kept in order.

910
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,398
Those who lift their hands to kill

911
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,438
must know
that the penalty for death is death.

912
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,753
Mnumzane, I read my Testament carefully.

913
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,998
Jesus has not said this.

914
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,798
Have you anything more to say to me?

915
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,435
No.

916
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,519
<i>No, mnumzane.</i>

917
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,672
The evidence in this case
is in many ways inconclusive,

918
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:04,310
unsatisfactory, and fragmentary.

919
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,119
Some of the accused appear
to have testified

920
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,636
in collusion with each other
or other witnesses.

921
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:18,837
The alibis offered by Matthew and Johannes
are obviously doubtful.

922
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,232
No reason has come to light

923
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,790
why Absalom should involve
in the robbery and murder

924
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,918
two men who were not with him
at the time and not guilty.

925
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:33,109
And yet, after long
and thoughtful consideration...

926
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,912
my assessors and I have come
to the conclusion

927
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,151
that the guilt
against Matthew and Johannes

928
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,956
is not sufficiently established.

929
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,389
There remains the case
against Absalom Kumalo.

930
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,631
No reason has been offered
why he should confess

931
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,233
to a deed he did not commit.

932
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,472
And his own insistence
that he had no intention to kill

933
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,632
operates to validate
the confession itself.

934
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,239
Matthew Kumalo and Johannes Pafuri.

935
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,998
You are discharged and may step down.

936
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,119
Absalom Kumalo.

937
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,474
You are a young man.

938
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:30,833
But this court has a solemn duty
to protect society

939
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,713
against the murderous attacks
of dangerous men, young or old...

940
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,473
and to show clearly
it will punish such offenders.

941
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,155
Absalom Kumalo.

942
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,634
Have you anything to say
before I pronounce sentence?

943
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,118
<i>Wave om Ms to say.</i>

944
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,794
That I killed this man...

945
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,359
but I did not mean to kill him.

946
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,829
I was afraid.

947
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,313
I now sentence you,

948
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,915
Absalom Kumalo,
to be returned to custody...

949
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,393
and to be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

950
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,194
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.

All right, <i>mfundisi,</i> it's time to go.

01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,276
Give us a little time. Please.

992
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,510
Will you wish to say good-bye to Irina?

993
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,150
There is no way to say good-bye.

994
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,829
- There will be an appeal.
- But it will not help.

995
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,874
I'm afraid.

996
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,638
Afraid of the hanging.

997
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,516
Be of courage, my son.

998
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,273
It is of no help to be of courage!

999
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,879
I'm afraid... of the rope!

01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,149
Of the hanging!

1001
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:29,438
Please, don't go.

01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,319
Where is your father?

1047
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,871
He died in Johannesburg. Where's yours?

1048
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,875
I don't know.

1049
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,279
I don't have any father.

1050
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,395
I'll bet this would work all the time
if you fixed it.

1051
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,235
Maybe.

1052
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,159
I have to go now.
My grandfather's waiting for me.

1053
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,473
I could comeback here tonight.

1054
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,999
And maybe we could both fix
that old toy together. All right?

1055
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,510
See you later.

1056
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,998
Well, good-bye, Alex.

1057
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,713
Alex? It's Edward.

1058
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,429
Oh, hi there.

1059
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,358
We could fix that old toy now.

1060
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,316
Okay.

1061
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,559
Let's take a look at it.

1062
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,834
Edward!

1063
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,112
[told you never to come into the village
without my permission.

1064
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,951
When you're a man,
you'll live your own life.

1065
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,157
But while you live with me,
never let me see you here again alone.

1066
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,991
- But I promised Alex...
- Edward!

1067
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,911
There are not many rules in my house...

1068
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,349
but this I do know.

1069
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,434
There are still some things
I cannot bear to look at.

1070
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,354
Now come home.

1071
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,796
1 am resigning from my pastorate
at Ndotsheni.

1072
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,031
I shall be your mfundisi no more.

1073
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:14,318
It had been my hope to end my years here,
but I cannot now.

1074
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:18,472
My people, if I stay here now,

1075
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,915
I become a hindrance to you
and not a help.

1076
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,558
And so I must go.

1077
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,997
You cannot go, mfundisi!

1078
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,434
You cannot go!

1079
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,352
Ndotsheni is a poor village,
and it will go poorer still,

1080
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,476
and no one will help you while I remain.

1081
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:38,509
Listen. Listen, please! Please listen!

1082
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,280
When I...

1083
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:53,030
When I began to serve my God
and my church...

1084
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,357
I had a sure faith that the

1085
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:01,239
God of our world ordered things well
with men.

1086
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,439
I had a sure faith that
though there was good and evil,

1087
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,795
1 knew which was good and God knew it.

1088
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:17,919
And men were better in their hearts
for choosing good and not evil.

1089
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,150
Something has shaken my faith.

1090
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,919
I am not sure.

1091
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,680
I am lost.

1092
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:34,350
I am not sure
that we are not all lost here.

1093
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:38,280
And a leader should not be lost.

1094
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,394
He should know the way.

1095
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,429
So I...

1096
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,230
I must resign my place.

1097
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,437
No, stay. Stay.

1098
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,675
- We need you!
- I cannot stay!

1099
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,318
This terrible thing has happened.

1100
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,160
My son will hang.

1101
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,280
If I stay,

1102
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,834
little by little,
you will shrink away from me

1103
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,320
and away from this church.

1104
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,118
Stones will break those windows
still unbroken.

1105
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,871
This rusty roof will leak...

1106
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,998
and the unpainted walls
of this chapel that I have loved

1107
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,910
will stand empty and roofless.

1108
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:27,989
And I...

1109
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,119
I shall live in despair beside it,

1110
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,911
knowing that I have done this to you...

1111
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:39,311
and to my church, by remaining here.

1112
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,516
Go home.

1113
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,755
Go home.

1114
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,117
I shall not preach here again.

1115
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,349
Go home.

1116
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,795
Go.

1117
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,634
<i>Mfundisi.</i>

1118
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,517
- Yes?
- She's fallen asleep.

1119
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:14,117
She meant to watch with you at this hour,
but she's fallen asleep.

1120
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,719
It is past 4:00.

1121
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,349
He is awake now.

1122
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:26,630
Yes.

1123
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,950
Why do they choose the morning?

1124
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,798
I do not know, my father.

1125
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,670
My daughter.

1126
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,435
Stay with her.

1127
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,751
I'm going up into the mountain.

1128
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,070
Irina.

1129
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,391
I am glad he found you, not some other.

1130
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,914
Stephen Kumalo. Stephen Kumalo.

1131
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,070
Last night,

1132
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,398
when you spoke to your congregation...

1133
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,113
1 was outside your church.

1134
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,478
I heard them when they cried out to you.

1135
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,758
I heard when they said,
"Do not go, mfundisi.

1136
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:48,318
Stay with us. Stay in Ndotsheni

1137
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,113
If I stayed,
do you know what I would preach here?

1138
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,439
If there is a God,

1139
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,277
he has hidden and has not spoken to men.

1140
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,912
That we're all lost here,
the fools and the wise.

1141
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,153
Lost and hopeless.

1142
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,509
Condemned on this rock
that goes round the sun without meaning.

1143
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,956
Better try and find a meaning,
Stephen Kumalo.

1144
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,039
Stephen Kumalo.

1145
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,838
You must listen to your people.

1146
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,353
Listen to those who need you.

1147
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,874
<i>Ge well, mfundisi.</i>

1148
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:36,114
Oh, Absalom. My son!

1149
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,034
MY sun!
