not so very special day,

1744
01:54:01,010 --> 01:54:03,444
I went to my typewriter,

1745
01:54:03,442 --> 01:54:05,672
I sat down...

1746
01:54:05,682 --> 01:54:07,582
and I wrote our story.

1747
01:54:09,395 --> 01:54:12,296
A story about a time,

1748
01:54:12,276 --> 01:54:15,439
a story about a place,

1749
01:54:15,413 --> 01:54:18,678
a story about the people.

1750
01:54:18,645 --> 01:54:21,307
But above all things,

1751
01:54:21,301 --> 01:54:24,668
a story about love.

1752
01:54:26,327 --> 01:54:27,589
A love...

1753
01:54:27,639 --> 01:54:29,539
that will live...

1754
01:54:29,559 --> 01:54:31,459
forever.

1755
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:35,960
The...

1756
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:37,860
end.

1757
01:54:41,786 --> 01:54:45,381
[ Christian ]
The greatest thing

1758
01:54:46,651 --> 01:54:51,554
You'll ever learn

1759
01:54:52,508 --> 01:54:56,945
Is just to love

1760
01:54:58,141 --> 01:55:01,338
And be loved

1761
01:55:03,358 --> 01:55:08,762
In return
