1
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,265
Please...

2
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,051
If he makes it to the river,
he's won.

3
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,513
We cannot allow that
to happen, Mr. Lopaki.

4
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,129
You're firing too close!

5
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,110
Brandy?

6
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,202
It's like a drug, isn't it?

7
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,373
To bring a man down.

8
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,256
Was it worth it?

9
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,551
- Every nickel.
- Good.

10
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,194
Yes?

11
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:47,658
Hi, I'm looking for
Douglas Binder.

12
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,286
- You a friend of Mr. Binder's?
- No, I...

13
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,539
I'm his daughter.

14
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,752
Doug was a nice man.
He had manners.

15
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:02,506
He didn't tell you where
he was moving, did he?

16
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,343
He owed some rent, honey.

17
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:11,181
I told him he could wait, to pay me
'til he got back on his feet.

18
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:17,604
- He wasn't in an accident, was he?
- No. He lost his job with the tool company.

19
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:22,818
When Doug moved out,
he left this box.

20
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,740
He told me
I could hold it...

21
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,327
'til he could make up
his back rent.

22
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,084
Do you have any idea
where he might be now?

23
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,921
You might try checking down
at Our Lady o' Charity.

24
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,633
Marine, huh?
Ah, Recon.

25
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:50,345
- I was in the service for a while myself.
- Really?

26
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,389
- Yeah.
- Do you know him?

27
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,850
Well, he comes here
sometimes.

28
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,518
Nice guy too.

29
00:07:56,602 --> 00:08:00,981
If I see him,
I'll tell him you're lookin'.

30
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,775
Do you happen to know
where he lives?

31
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,782
I'm afraid
your-your daddy, well...

32
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:16,038
well, he was like the rest of us.
Out-of-doors. You know?

33
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,947
How is that gumbo, Chance?

34
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,325
A tragedy.

35
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,954
- The coffee was tolerable, though.
- It ain't free neither.

36
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,039
Yeah, I know.

37
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,292
Leave your wallet
in your tuxedo?

38
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:08,715
- I play that one on you before?
- Yeah. For the gumbo.

39
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,050
That's right.

40
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,077
Hi.
Do you have any change?

41
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,085
Thank you.

42
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,649
Hi Marie.

43
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:11,445
Yes, I was wondering if my father
came to pick up his mail yet.

44
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,199
He hasn't? No, that's fine.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

45
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,425
- Hello, pretty lady.
- Leave me the hell alone.

46
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,552
We'll take the wallet.

47
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,513
How about a little extra,
honey?

48
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,562
You having fun?

49
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,446
Why don't you do yourself
a favor, boy?

50
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,325
I think the favor
gonna be done for you.

51
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,746
It's okay.

52
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,332
I said get lost.

53
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,255
Now, take your big stick
and your boyfriend...

54
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,008
and find a bus to catch.

55
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,177
Oh, this guy's funny.

56
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,215
Come on, let's go!

57
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,827
Let's go!

58
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,203
Come on!

59
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:44,389
You know, it's a shame.
This used to be such a nice part of town.

60
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:52,397
Next time, be more careful
when you show your wallet.

61
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:24,679
Without cops, the city stops!
Without cops, the city stops!

62
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,901
Come on, let's hurry now!
Come on!

63
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,155
Will the strike end soon?

64
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,135
Happy birthday to me.

65
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,097
Excuse me.

66
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,900
Can I help you?

67
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:22,028
Yeah. I nee-I need to fill out
a missing person report.

68
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:27,200
Look, I just pulled a double shift.
Why don't you catch me tomorrow.

69
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,871
Okay...
Why don't you catch me now.

70
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:36,626
- What is the name of the missing individual?
- Douglas Charles Binder.

71
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,298
- Relationship of reporting party?
- Daughter.

72
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,261
Okay. You got a picture?

73
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,730
- Got something a little more recent?
- Oh, no, I don't.

74
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,942
See, my parents
were divorced 20 years ago.

75
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,905
- You got an address?
- I think my father was homeless.

76
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:10,243
I didn't even know myself
until I just came down here.

77
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:14,706
Look, um, I'm not sure
what you want me to do here.

78
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,917
I want you
to take my report.

79
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,839
Generally, in order to be considered missing,
you need somewhere to be missing from.

80
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,841
Fine.

81
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,844
Look, if you're too busy
to do your job, detective...

82
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,555
then I'll find somebody
who isn't so busy.

83
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,600
Look.

84
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,271
You wanna find your father, take my advice.
Canvas the missions...

85
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,440
ask at the shelters, but...

86
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,735
get somebody who knows the city
to show you around...

87
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,155
or I'll be filling out
one of these on you.

88
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,284
Hey, you're welcome.

89
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,625
All right,
pipe down and listen up.

90
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:45,005
We got 12 positions this morning,
able seaman or better.

91
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,299
When I call your name, come
into the office, show your papers...

92
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,094
you'll get your ship.

93
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,055
Here we go.
First man, Gombas, Luigi.

94
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,765
- Able seaman.
- Right here.

95
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,644
Walker, Steven.
Second engineer.

96
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,355
Hi.

97
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,526
They told me at the cafe
that you might be down here.

98
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:11,031
- I need to talk to you about something.
- I don't think this is a good time now.

99
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,283
Walters, Nichols D.

100
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,701
- Yeah.
- Able seaman.

101
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:20,665
How'd you, um, like to work for me?
I'll pay you. 100 dollars a day.

102
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,920
- For doing what?
- For 100 dollars, does it really matter?

103
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,300
Actually, it does.

104
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,552
Yeah... it does.

105
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:38,725
- I really need you to help me find someone.
- Jales, Bill. Cook.

106
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,687
You know this city, you...
obviously can take care of yourself.

107
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:46,566
Boudreaux, C.
Able seaman.

108
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,445
I would like to
help you, darling.

109
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,782
- Looks like I'm gonna be out of town.
- Bakelman, Fats.

110
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,576
- Way out of town.
- Able seaman.

111
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,620
Sorry.

112
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:09,297
Chance. Thought you got blackballed
about that thing with captain McDonald.

113
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,967
- That was a big misunderstanding, you know.
- Right...

114
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,429
Broke his damn jaw
is what I heard.

115
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,891
You make sure
I said a big "hello".

116
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,976
Whoa. Wait a minute.

117
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,063
Johnson says
I was reinstated.

118
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,732
With the company.
Not with the union.

119
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,568
You owe
some dues here, boy.

120
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:34,239
- 217 bucks.
- I'll pay that off on this cruise.

121
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,909
No. Nobody ships out if
they're in arrears, you know that.

122
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,954
How am I gonna pay my dues
if I can't get the job?

123
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,915
I don't make the rules,
mate.

124
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,419
Look, your ride doesn't sail
'til the end of the week.

125
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:53,383
- If I can get the money, then what?
- Then I'll let you ship out.

126
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,595
I'll get the money.

127
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,066
Keep goin'.
Take it back. Yeah.

128
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:14,821
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it.
Okay, down.

129
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,972
So, this guy you're looking for,
he owes you money or something?

130
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,726
- He's my father.
- Okay, I changed my mind.

131
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:50,732
I'll help you for two days,
you'll pay me 217 dollars.

132
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,610
It's a deal.

133
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:59,824
- You can drive.
- I don't have a driver's license, ma'am.

134
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:07,582
- So, what's your name?
- Chance Boudreaux. What's your name?

135
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,542
It's Nat.

136
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,836
Nat?

137
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,715
Your parents name you
for a... bug?

138
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,676
No, actually,
it's short for Natasha.

139
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,012
Natasha...

140
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,765
What kind of a name
is Chance?

141
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,227
Well, my mama took one.

142
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,691
So, how did you lose
your papa?

143
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,780
My parents, um, they got divorced
when I was 7 and my father...

144
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,157
Well, he moved away.

145
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:48,206
We started to write and...
he even called me a couple of times.

146
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,668
Three weeks ago,
the letters just... stopped.

147
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,007
I've got a friend here
who can help us.

148
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,678
You check the line,
I'll look around inside.

149
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:14,357
Hey, you don't have a bottle
of hot sauce on you, do you?

150
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,695
- Elijah. What's happening?
- Wednesday meat loaf.

151
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,155
I mean, they said
it was meat loaf.

152
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:26,369
- I thought you were gonna get a ship.
- I lost my boarding pass.

153
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,456
I've got something
to show you.

154
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,334
- You two know each other?
- We met yesterday.

155
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,504
- Have you seen... my father?
- I saw the next best thing.

156
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:42,302
I was over at Plaza d'Italia yesterday
and I saw this sleeping bag in a cart.

157
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:46,723
It was a tiger stripe, like the kind
they used to issue to Recon guys.

158
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,726
Your daddy had one
just like it.

159
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,604
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You bet.

160
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:53,915
Don't be offended.
He passed them out for money.

161
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,125
Yeah, I've had
to do it myself.

162
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,132
Here. Barracks Street.

163
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,969
Both sides this time, grandpa.
Next! Get!

164
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,640
Here, Decatur.
Lower half.

165
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,312
Well, if it ain't
my good friend Boudreaux.

166
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,564
I thought you was gonna
catch a ship.

167
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,484
Maybe I'll stick around
to run for mayor.

168
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,194
We're looking for someone
who worked for you.

169
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,446
The man's name
is Douglas Binder.

170
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,909
- I never heard of him.
- I think he know you.

171
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:33,329
- Did he work for you, sir?
- Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.

172
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,665
I'm not too good
with names.

173
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,800
I have a photograph.

174
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:54,100
What Mr. Poe tryin' to say,
he's not too good with faces.

175
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,935
Right?

176
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:02,984
Hello Randal.
I didn't know you had company.

177
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,458
We're just leaving.

178
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,924
- You know, we should go back up there.
- Not now. Not together.

179
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,886
Poe knows something
about my father, obviously.

180
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,638
Look, if you don't wanna go back
up there, I'll just go back myself.

181
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:36,476
If you want to find your daddy,
you're gonna have to work smarter...

182
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,561
not harder.

183
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,897
Yeah...

184
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,362
- Natasha Binder?
- What's the problem?

185
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,948
Miss Binder, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

186
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,743
They found
your father's body.

187
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,145
I'm sorry.

188
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:24,982
- They made a positive I.D.
- How did it happen?

189
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:29,946
There was a fire last night
in an abandoned building in the 9th Ward.

190
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:34,534
The fire department discovered
your father's body in one of the rooms.

191
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:39,497
- I need to see him.
- Your daddy was burned pretty badly.

192
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:46,963
The identification had to be made from
dental charts, in your father's service record.

193
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,975
What's your
involvement here?

194
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,936
I was helping her
find her daddy.

195
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:34,302
Wakey, wakey,
you fat fuck!

196
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:50,234
Oh, God!
Mr. Fouchon, what are you doing here?

197
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:54,488
- Don't talk, Randal. Listen.
- Oh, don't worry about Randal.

198
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,033
He's all ears.

199
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,494
When Mr. Van Cleaf came upon
your visitors yesterday...

200
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:04,373
you neglected to tell him that they were
inquiring about one of our volunteers.

201
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:09,545
- That was nothin', Mr. Fouchon.
- Oh, it was something, Randal.

202
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,811
This man
we hunted last night.

203
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,689
Why don't you
tell us his real name?

204
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:32,652
- You fuck.
- Binder. Binder. Douglas Binder.

205
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:35,446
That's not the one
we selected, is it?

206
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,907
I couldn't get the guy
you asked for.

207
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,952
Look, you said you wanted a combat veteran,
so I sent you Binder.

208
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,455
- He has more medals.
- He had a family.

209
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:48,292
- Now they're asking questions.
- Please. Please. I said I was sorry...

210
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:52,171
- I said I was sorry.
- Careless is what you are, Randal.

211
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:56,592
Careless and stupid,
and now you're sorry, too.

212
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,928
He said he...
He said he was alone.

213
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,431
- I didn't know he had any relatives. Honest.
- You made a mistake?

214
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,184
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,020
And I see you're anxious
to make up for it, aren't you?

216
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,480
Yeah. Yes. Yes, sir.

217
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,149
We've got another client...

218
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,444
and he's about
to select a new playmate.

219
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:22,118
Next time... send us
the one we ask for.

220
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,538
I will, Mr. Fouchon,
I swear. I...

221
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,960
I think
we understand each other.

222
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,755
- Yes? No?
- Yes. Yeah.

223
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,841
Randal...

224
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:41,846
I come back here...
I cut me a steak.

225
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:51,522
- You did your best.
- No, I came too late.

226
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:55,443
I mean, Jesus, he was living
out of a shopping cart.

227
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:01,282
Goddamn it.
Why didn't he just tell me?

228
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,951
Why didn't he ask
for my help?

229
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:09,248
I've been there myself on the street.
It's hard.

230
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,753
It's hard to...
put your hand out.

231
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,757
I just kept thinking
if I could...

232
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,179
just tell him
that I loved him.

233
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,975
And because
he loved you so much...

234
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:32,354
he didn't want
to pull you into it.

235
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,987
Our friend,
Mr. Boudreaux.

236
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,783
Silver Star.

237
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:48,329
- Marine Force Recon.
- Joined the merchant service after he got out.

238
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,456
His captain
was smuggling opium.

239
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,376
When Boudreaux found out,
he threw the man overboard.

240
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,921
He's been looking
for work ever since.

241
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:00,549
He's obviously not someone
we should underestimate.

242
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,886
He was raised
in the bayous by his uncle.

243
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:08,933
I think Mr. Boudreaux would make
a very interesting quarry.

244
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,439
- Maybe I should pay him a visit.
- No, no, no, no, no.

245
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:19,360
Send a couple of lads down there
to have a chat with him, once you're back.

246
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,111
Yeah.

247
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,077
Yeah...

248
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,253
Bingo.

249
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:37,665
Some friendly advice, Boudreaux:
Get the fuck outta Dodge!

250
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,834
Do it today!
And tell that bitch girlfriend o' yours...

251
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:44,171
to point her titties north
and step on the gas!

252
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,931
It's always
nice to see you.

253
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:58,519
You seem to have a real talent,
Mr. Boudreaux, for attracting violence.

254
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,522
Does that make me
a bad person?

255
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:06,443
Why did you arrest me for?
Getting beat up without a license?

256
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:08,237
Thank you for calling me.

257
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,906
Oh, my God,
you look awful.

258
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:15,911
- Darling, you hurt my feelings.
- What we have here is a charge sheet.

259
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:19,498
Willfully crossing a police barrier,
that's considered criminal trespass.

260
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,793
Yes, that officer was nice enough
to mention that to me.

261
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:27,423
- What were you doing at the house?
- The dog tag you find in that fire?

262
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,925
They always
come in twos.

263
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:34,805
So, I went back to that place
to look for the other one.

264
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:38,142
Your daddy...
he didn't die in the fire.

265
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,646
- He was murdered.
- There's no evidence of that.

266
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,815
There is now.

267
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,280
That hole in that tag was made
by something sharp and hard.

268
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:56,785
And I'll bet my rent money it was made
when Binder was still wearing it.

269
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:00,414
Now, why would somebody go through
all this trouble to kill a homeless man?

270
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,460
- Do you believe us now?
- Honey, the wheels turn slow around here.

271
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,129
- Real slow.
- But they do turn.

272
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,928
I'll order a new autopsy.
This'll help.

273
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:27,024
- You should see a doctor.
- I hate them doctors.

274
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,975
Yeah... Shit!

275
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,480
What?

276
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,398
Not now!

277
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:22,788
- So, you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, a long time ago.

278
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:27,126
It seems to me a man with your experience
should be pullin' down a lot more money.

279
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:33,632
You're gonna pay me
100 bucks to fill out a form?

280
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,635
I'll pay you a lot more than that
if you got the experience.

281
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,308
What kind of experience?

282
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:47,938
- Well, maybe you ain't interested.
- No.

283
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,024
I'll fill out the application.

284
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,777
You got any family?
Anybody to worry about you?

285
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:57,823
- Friends? Anything like that?
- I got nobody.

286
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:21,680
You'll deposit 500,000 dollars in our account
in a bank in the Cayman Islands.

287
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:26,935
Do not refer to our agreement by telex
or in conversations on the phone.

288
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:34,401
You'll be provided with a guide, trackers
and the weapon of your choice.

289
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,820
Naturally, we will
dispose of the body...

290
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:41,408
and provide you with
an out-of-town, airtight alibi.

291
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:46,121
Don't worry, Mr. Zenan,
all you have to do is point and shoot.

292
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:56,715
Mr. Zenan has made
his selection.

293
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:01,011
A black man named Roper.
Used to be in Special Forces.

294
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,180
Excellent.

295
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,724
I don't see any problem
with your choice.

296
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:10,354
It has always been the privilege of the few
to hunt the many.

297
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:14,775
Soldiers, policemen,
fighter pilots.

298
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,736
Men who kill for the government
do so with impunity.

299
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:22,366
Now, all we do is offer the same opportunity
for private citizens such as yourself.

300
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:26,703
- These opponents, they're volunteers?
- More or less.

301
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:31,124
The same government that has made murder
their sole preserve, they train our targets.

302
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:34,878
We pride ourselves on
only hunting combat veterans...

303
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,047
men who have
the necessary skills...

304
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,759
- to make our hunts more interesting.
- What about the police?

305
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,679
I'm sure that they would be interested
if they were to find out.

306
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:48,892
Dr. Morton here assists us
with the formality of police autopsies.

307
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:51,979
It's no accident
that we're in New Orleans.

308
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:55,524
Last year we conducted hunts
in Rio de Janeiro at Carnival...

309
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,444
Yugoslavia during
the late unpleasantness.. Oh, yeah.

310
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:04,366
You see, there's always some unhappy
little corner of the planet...

311
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,077
where we can ply
our trade.

312
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,538
All right, Mr. Fouchon.

313
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:17,504
- You have a client.
- Well, thank you for visiting, Mr. Zenan.

314
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,923
Dr. Morton will show you
to the car.

315
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:22,509
My bank will arrange
the transfer of funds within the hour.

316
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,928
- Excellent.
- When do we go out?

317
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:29,141
We'll contact you when the necessary
arrangements have been made.

318
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,485
Chance.
What you doing here?

319
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,070
Secret mission.

320
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,033
Rub me, baby.

321
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,387
Oh, yeah, baby...

322
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:11,391
- Hello Poe.
- What the fuck?

323
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,146
- You miss me?
- Aw, Christ, not again.

324
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:21,109
Looks like you're short an ear,
so you better listen very carefully.

325
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:24,237
Now, are you
paying attention?

326
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:30,160
- Who sent those apes after me?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

327
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,373
Two million people
in this city.

328
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:40,128
- Who's gonna miss a fat slob like you, Poe?
- Van Cleaf! His name was Van Cleaf.

329
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,172
Good boy.
Where is he?

330
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,801
I don't know where he lives!
He ain't even American!

331
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:51,181
Look, he'll kill me if I don't do what he says!
Please! You gotta believe that!

332
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,725
Tell your boyfriend
Van Cleaf...

333
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:57,187
I'm gonna find out who
killed Douglas Binder.

334
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,565
If you understand me,
just grunt.

335
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,319
Again.

336
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,335
Did you get my memo?

337
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,673
Binder, Douglas C.

338
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,385
I want you to take another look
at the post-mortem.

339
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:36,309
That memo contains evidence
that might make Binder's death a homicide.

340
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:40,105
Now, you can act on it,
doctor, or you can file it...

341
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,942
but if I have to get a court order
for a formal inquest...

342
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,986
I will.

343
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:04,045
You should do something
about that cough.

344
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,090
Don't you ever knock?

345
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:19,227
We have a problem.
A big problem.

346
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,939
They want me to redo
the autopsy on Binder.

347
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:30,572
- Who is it that's asking?
- A detective named Mitchell.

348
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,033
Binder's family's
breathing down her neck.

349
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,496
- Can we buy her?
- No.

350
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,922
I guess we've overstayed
our welcome.

351
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,179
Tonight is our last hunt
in New Orleans.

352
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,729
Open it.

353
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,763
What a funny little man, eh?

354
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,809
A change of scenery's what we need.
Something less tropical.

355
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,478
Rolling hills, castles...

356
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,983
Eastern Europe.
We can work there for years.

357
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:29,274
- Where's Poe?
- Mr. Poe couldn't make it.

358
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,067
He's got an ear infection.

359
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:40,076
- Look, he said he'd have some work for me.
- That may still be a possibility.

360
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:44,914
We got a little game
we'd like you to play with us.

361
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,794
This money belt...

362
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:52,714
has 10,000 dollars in it.

363
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:56,760
It's all yours if you want it,
every penny.

364
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:02,015
- What do I have to do?
- The rules of the game are very simple.

365
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:06,061
All you have to do is get to the river.
Ten miles through the city.

366
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:10,565
You and the money belt make it to the river,
you're 10,000 dollars richer.

367
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,984
Bullshit.

368
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:19,199
Maybe you like being the object of pity,
begging for quarters, sleeping in the rain,

369
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:23,578
listening to a half an hour of fire
and brimstone for a bowl of soup.

370
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:27,415
- Man, fuck you.
- You could change everything tonight.

371
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:31,127
Think of what
10,000 dollars could buy you.

372
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:34,547
You could get new clothes,
clean yourself up...

373
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:38,009
look men in the eyes when
you pass 'em on the street.

374
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:41,221
This money could
make you a man again...

375
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:44,766
instead of the shadow
of your former self.

376
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:54,359
- I get to the river, I get the cash.
- Every nickel.

377
00:44:56,111 --> 00:45:00,865
- If I don't make it?
- Oh, you're a sports fan, Roper.

378
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,326
Figure it out.

379
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,882
You got a five-minute head start.
Don't waste it.

380
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:45,660
This is New Orleans,
Mr. Zenan, not Beirut.

381
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,493
After you, sir.

382
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:32,248
Mr. Zenan,
take it off "safe".

383
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,770
Finish him.

384
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:38,898
I don't want him.
He's wounded.

385
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:43,319
- Finish him.
- I can't do that. I hit him.

386
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:47,073
Listen, don't make me look bad
in front of my dogs.

387
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,700
You know
why you're here?

388
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:53,621
You paid us a half a million dollars
to find out if you're alive or dead.

389
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:55,665
Now finish him.

390
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,334
Finish him.

391
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,796
God, why didn't he
go fishing?

392
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:43,546
Now you understand
why we insist on payment up front.

393
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:48,509
Here.

394
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:54,474
Set the dogs on him, won't you, Pick?
I don't wanna be out here all night.

395
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,900
Help me!
Please! Please!

396
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,992
Help me!

397
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:18,456
- Please! Help me! Help me!
- Go on, get a job!

398
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,709
- Please!
- Watch it! Damn! Watch yourself!

399
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,545
Help me. Help me!

400
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:26,839
Help me!

401
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:39,143
- Hey, look! Come on, man!
- Walk on by, now, man.

402
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:42,772
Call the police here or somethin'!
Help me! Help me!

403
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:49,362
- Hey! Let me in! Come on!
- No, we're closed!

404
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,781
Hey, buddy!
Hey! Hey! Come on!

405
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,575
- Brother, get out of here, man.
- Hey, come on, man!

406
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,037
- Help me!
- Hey! I ain't got no change, man!

407
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:45,269
- He was passin' out flyers for Randal Poe.
- Let's pay him a visit.

408
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:49,375
Randal, Randal, Randal...

409
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,838
You were gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

410
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:58,676
My mama got sick
in Biloxi...

411
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:05,641
- I was gonna call you, Mr. Van Cleaf.
- Of course you were, Randal.

412
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,727
Of course you were.

413
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:12,815
I know you didn't mean
to hurt my feelings.

414
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:03,032
Looks like we missed
the party.

415
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,834
Get down!

416
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,196
Stay down!

417
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,678
Go! Go! Go!

418
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:23,172
- Let's go.
- We can't just leave her here!

419
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:27,301
<i>Keep him in the Quarter.
Stay on his ass.</i>

420
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:30,221
She's dead. Come on.

421
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,509
Grab the bar!

422
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,094
Yeah!

423
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,098
Ladies first.

424
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,683
What?

425
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:35,591
It appears we'll have
one last hunt after all, Pick.

426
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:12,294
The train went by maybe two,
two and a half hours ago.

427
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:16,256
This could be dangerous.
We're on his turf now.

428
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,968
Thank you, gentlemen, for making
yourselves available on such short notice.

429
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:23,013
We are stalking
an exceptional opponent.

430
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:29,895
Truly a world-class trophy.
The price for participating in this excursion..

431
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,773
is 750,000 dollars each.

432
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,900
Should one of you be lucky
enough to bring him down...

433
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:37,444
I'll consider that hunter's
account paid in full.

434
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:45,327
Shouldn't we be worried
about alligators or something?

435
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:49,164
If it make you feel better...
Yeah.

436
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,923
Come on, keep going.

437
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:01,427
It's still a long way
to uncle Douvee's place.

438
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,595
At least they won't
be able to find us out here.

439
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,850
Yes, they will, if they have
a tracker as good as uncle Douvee.

440
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:11,687
All they have to do
is to check along the railroad.

441
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:16,066
- I'm just guessing we have a couple of hours.
- Okay.

442
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:18,569
Maybe less.
Come on. Let's go.

443
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:31,165
Isn't there
a trail or something?

444
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:33,751
This is the trail.

445
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:42,009
- You're enjoying yourself, aren't you, Chance?
- If it's tough for us, it's tough for them.

446
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,766
You trust me?

447
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,770
Of course I trust you.

448
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:55,481
Close your eyes.

449
01:02:57,316 --> 01:03:00,402
Why do you want me to trust you
with my eyes closed?

450
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,322
Close your eyes.

451
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:40,692
- Is it dead?
- Not hardly.

452
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:47,324
What are you doing?

453
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,410
I'm leaving a surprise
for my friends.

454
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,724
Son of a bitch!

455
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:41,587
I'll kill you
and I'll eat you!

456
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:47,968
If you would die quieter...
and pick up the pace...

457
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:52,764
Boudreaux would have less time
for these little surprises. Jerome!

458
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:55,392
Would you be so kind?

459
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:59,187
And do watch your step, won't you?
Let's go.

460
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:33,722
Sometime
I amaze myself, me!

461
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:38,226
Good whiskey!
Make jack rabbit slap the bear!

462
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,998
- Chance? Chance...
- Yeah!

463
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,842
Chance...
You come to see your uncle Douvee.

464
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:17,224
Natasha,
my uncle Douvee.

465
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:27,150
We'll fix him up good.
Put bandage on, it no hurt.

466
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:31,863
- Be strong, my boy.
- Douvee, I've got some people after me.

467
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:33,699
I know.

468
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,076
I can smell them.

469
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,413
You've still got a 30-06,
the one I gave you for your birthday?

470
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,457
No. A gator ate it.

471
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,544
But...

472
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:49,631
I've still got your shotgun.

473
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,892
So, tell me, this mans
what chase after you...

474
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,352
he mad at you
for business or pleasure?

475
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:45,562
Both.

476
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:52,152
I'm gonna take Elvira south,
then to Bayou La Fouche...

477
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,988
Mardi Gras graveyard.

478
01:07:55,072 --> 01:07:58,450
If you can talk her into it,
go ahead.

479
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,619
You be careful.

480
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,377
Don't worry about me.

481
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,547
I love the company.

482
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,972
Be careful.
Without you, I'm hunting them.

483
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:51,253
He's gonna be all right.

484
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,797
Oui. Come.

485
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:55,799
We go.

486
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:42,387
Here, drink.
But do not spill.

487
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,848
It kill the grass.

488
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:49,603
The place is clean.
He just left.

489
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,149
Get the fuck down!

490
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,144
Hey!

491
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:14,938
Hold it!

492
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:20,527
Boudreaux is the target
we're after.

493
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:24,572
You are a fucking buffalo!

494
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:26,992
Move!

495
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:44,676
Boudreaux went this way, maybe 10,
15 minutes ago. He's on a horse.

496
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:49,431
He's trying to lead us
away from his friends.

497
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:53,435
Get in the fucking trucks.

498
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:57,814
Move! Fucking move!
Will you move? Move!

499
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,110
They're fucking brain-dead.

500
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,489
Get the helicopter.
Find Boudreaux.

501
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:09,409
We'll set up an ambush
this side of Bayou La Fouche.

502
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,036
I can take him
from the air.

503
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,331
Any pinhead can take him from the air.
I wanna take him from the ground!

504
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:16,374
I can take him
from the air!

505
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:20,378
- Be a professional, Pick.
- Hey, you're making a mistake here.

506
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,132
Make sure
he gets there, Pick.

507
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,582
That's him.

508
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:18,074
Hey pigeon.

509
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:50,231
Avril Pybus has a store two miles this way.
You go to a telephone, call the sheriff.

510
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:56,070
You know, chére,
I think you should call the sheriff.

511
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:04,287
It appears your trophy's
ripping us a new orifice.

512
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,457
Let me review the tactical situation
for you, gentlemen.

513
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,083
Boudreaux is wounded.

514
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:12,920
He's been pursued and harried
across miles of open country.

515
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:16,549
Now he's cornered
and outnumbered 20 to 1.

516
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:21,929
He's an annoying little fucking insect
and I want him stepped on, hard.

517
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,726
You're not angry with me,
are you, Pick?

518
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,313
I don't get angry-

519
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,065
I'm a professional.

520
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,387
Let's move!

521
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,324
This is not good.

522
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:10,538
If we walk away now,
we can be in Mexico in five hours.

523
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:15,126
What the fuck is the matter with you, Pick?
Hunting drunks in alleys made you soft?

524
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:04,675
God, that son-of-a-bitch
is good!

525
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:09,972
Goddamn it, I'm gonna blow
his goddamn head off!

526
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:15,603
What are you lookin' at, you sons-of-bitches?
This is what you paid for! Get him!

527
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,787
Seal off this place.

528
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:36,582
The son-of-a-bitch is mine.

529
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:32,763
Sorry about the shirt.

530
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:37,393
Give it a rest, pal.

531
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:47,904
Now what do you wanna do?

532
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:53,117
Now we put arrow into everyone
what's not Chance, huh?

533
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,744
Come.

534
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:40,706
You fuckin' bitch!

535
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,507
Now...
Now look what you do.

536
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:52,677
Give me this gun.
I take care all this bad guy.

537
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,887
Give me this gun!

538
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:30,381
Chance!

539
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:02,079
- I told you to go for help.
- But we help.

540
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:05,249
All these men try to kill you.
We're here to help.

541
01:25:05,059 --> 01:25:08,020
Boudreaux,
Boudreaux, Boudreaux.

542
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:14,068
I've been looking
all over for you.

543
01:25:14,652 --> 01:25:17,571
You've been looking
in the wrong places.

544
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:23,077
That's good, cause I know you wouldn't
want to hurt my feelings.

545
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:19,777
Can you get up?

546
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:22,863
I cannot dance,
but I can get up.

547
01:28:05,823 --> 01:28:07,324
Hey!

548
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,537
Hey!

549
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:01,128
You lucky son-of-a-bitch!

550
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:04,298
- You want some more o' that?
- Yeah!

551
01:29:07,468 --> 01:29:10,137
How does it feel
to be hunted?

552
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:16,060
- You tell me!
- You should know better.

553
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:20,105
There's no country in the world
I haven't fired a bullet in!

554
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:25,444
You can't kill me!

555
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:28,572
You can't kill me!

556
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,161
I'm on every
battlefield!

557
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:40,209
There's a winner here!

558
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:43,796
- I don't see one.
- You're looking at him!

559
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,385
Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!
Take your best shot.

560
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:09,696
Chance!

561
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:13,325
Chance!

562
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:15,828
My boy!

563
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:32,469
Just shoot him!

564
01:30:35,264 --> 01:30:37,808
You won't do that, will you,
Mr. Boudreaux?

565
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:40,310
Chance! Please!

566
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:45,149
If he shoots me, he'll kill you.
He's picked the wrong tool for the job.

567
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:52,614
Put the weapon down...

568
01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:56,326
or I'll run her through!

569
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:29,276
You see, Miss Binder...

570
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:32,821
you I can understand.
It was a matter of family.

571
01:31:32,905 --> 01:31:36,492
You had nothing in common
with those people.

572
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:40,954
What made you wanna
complicate my life like this?

573
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:45,626
Poor people get bored too.

574
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:49,129
- Come here.
- Please!

575
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,305
Load me.

576
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:55,505
Hunting season is over.

577
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:30,540
Douvee! Douvee!

578
01:34:32,793 --> 01:34:38,298
What is this noise?
I was dreaming. Chére, I think about you.

579
01:34:38,382 --> 01:34:42,803
I tell this turkey
he no kill this eagle.

580
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:46,348
Oh, headache I got here.

581
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:52,896
Oh, my God.

582
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:59,069
- What?
- I think I hurt pretty bad.

583
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,451
Now this,
this real catastrophe!

584
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:09,538
- This real bad.
- Yeah, real bad.
