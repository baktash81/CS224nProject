1
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,900
My name is Alice.

2
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,450
I worked for
the Umbrella Corporation...

3
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,870
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

4
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,370
I was head of security...

5
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,170
...at a secret high-tech facility
called The Hive...

6
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,590
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

7
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,500
...viral weaponry.

8
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,090
But there was an incident.

9
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,050
The virus escaped
and everybody died.

10
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,060
Trouble was...

11
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,350
...they didn't stay dead.

12
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,810
The T-virus reanimated their bodies.

13
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,280
But I survived.
Myself and one other...

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,240
...an environmentalist named Matt.

15
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,070
When we emerged we were
seized by Umbrella scientists.

16
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,620
Matt and I were separated.

17
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,410
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

18
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,830
Matt!

19
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,420
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility...

20
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,340
...and assemble the team.

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,090
We're reopening The Hive.

22
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,670
I want to know
what went on down there.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,590
We thought we'd
survived the horror.

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,720
But we were wrong.

25
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,740
You're watching Raccoon 7.
Now the weather with Terri Morales.

26
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,280
It's 6:10 in the a.m. and already
the temperature has reached...

27
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,950
...a massive 92 degrees as this
unprecedented heat wave continues.

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,750
Clear skies in Raccoon City and a
light breeze coming in from the west.

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,210
And as a special bonus just for you
we have a pollen count of 0.7.

30
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,550
That's a record low
for this time of year.

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,550
Good news for all you hay fever
and asthma sufferers.

32
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,560
All in all it looks like it's gonna be
another beautiful day.

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,430
Stay with us. After the break...

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,560
...we're gonna look at your favorite
holiday hot spots.

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,010
Advance team proceed.

36
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,810
Sir.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Holy shit.

38
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,070
Excuse us ma'am.
There's been an incident.

39
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,840
Excuse us sir.
There's been an incident.

40
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,010
How bad is it?

41
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,680
- You must come with us.
- I must get my daughter.

42
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,970
- It's taken care of.
- What are you doing?

43
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,600
You don't understand.
She's left for school.

44
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,940
This is U-Gamma 7
evacuation complete...

45
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,320
...but we just lost contact
with Gamma 12.

46
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,140
Unit 12 calling for immediate backup
at city hall.

47
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,690
Still no explanation for this wave
of unexplained killings...

48
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,110
...that is sweeping across the city.

49
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,780
A deadly crime spree with no end.

50
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,490
Backup we need backup now!

51
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,790
Just like Valentine told us...

52
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,620
Off-duty law enforcement personnel
report for duty immediately.

53
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,510
Give us a hand over here
this guy's insane!

54
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,480
- It's Valentine.
- Hold your fire.

55
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,230
- Valentine!
- They're infected.

56
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,730
Somebody get this ugly bitch
off of me!

57
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,190
I told you. Shoot for the head.

58
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,570
Please somebody get her.

59
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,530
No! Don't shoot! Don't...

60
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,910
I'm leaving town.
I suggest you do the same.

61
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,580
Everyone's leaving the city.

62
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,330
We've received reports
of Umbrella Corporation...

63
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,920
...dispatching armed guards
and troop carriers.

64
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,510
Move in an orderly fashion
to security checkpoints.

65
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,020
The city is completely contained.
Troops have sealed all exits.

66
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,850
The only way out is this bridge.

67
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,020
All citizens must pass through
medical scanning.

68
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,030
Sir! You better take a look at this.

69
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,610
Family members must pass through
security checkpoints together.

70
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,200
Please proceed in an orderly fashion.
Do not run.

71
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,380
- He's clean. Let him pass.
- Next!

72
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,880
No pushing please. Keep in line.

73
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,510
Can we get some
reinforcements down here?

74
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,010
Chopper Delta new orders.

75
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,220
Proceed directly to
Ravens Gate Bridge.

76
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,060
Reinforcements urgently needed.

77
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,310
Copy that base. On our way.

78
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,210
Get it.

79
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,790
No! Get off!

80
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,720
Get away! No! Stop! Get off!

81
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,570
No! Get back!

82
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,450
Civilian in trouble. Three o'clock.
Go down.

83
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,200
I can't. We have our orders.

84
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,620
No! Get back! No!

85
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,950
They're gonna kill her!
Take us down now!

86
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,920
She's a civilian. We have orders.

87
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,750
Fuck orders!

88
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,590
Nicholai tie me off.

89
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,260
Get back! No!

90
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,800
Wait!

91
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,150
Now!

92
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,700
Take us down! Down now!

93
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,960
Hey. Hey you okay?

94
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,670
Step away from the edge.
Come over to me.

95
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,680
- Everything's okay.
- No it's not.

96
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,350
I've seen what happens to you
once you've been bitten.

97
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,270
- We can help you.
- There's no going back.

98
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,850
No!

99
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,080
Move! Peyton!

100
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,210
- Peyton!
- Valentine. Hey Valentine.

101
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,550
- Move! Police! Move!
- Let her through.

102
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,590
Glad you're here.
We could use the help.

103
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,890
- He has a weak heart.
- Get away from him!

104
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,680
Everybody stand back!

105
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,640
- Daddy!
- Get away from him!

106
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,690
- Get her away from him!
- It's okay.

107
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,940
- Get her away!
- It's okay. Come on.

108
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,530
- Daddy!
- It's okay I got you.

109
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,950
- Get him off! Get him off me!
- Move aside!

110
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,200
Get back!

111
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,590
It's here. It's reached the gate.

112
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,050
Why are you here? You should've
got out while you had the chance.

113
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,260
These are our people Jill.

114
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,720
- Close them.
- Sir?

115
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,270
Seal the gates.

116
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,690
- Our men are still out there...
- Just do it.

117
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,400
Oh my God they're closing
the gates!

118
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,800
This is a biohazard quarantine area.

119
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,050
Due to risk of infection you cannot
be allowed to leave the city.

120
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,100
What the fuck is going on here?

121
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,020
All appropriate measures
are being taken.

122
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,480
The situation is under control.

123
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,650
Please return to your homes.

124
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,610
You won't get away with this!

125
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,990
Let us out!

126
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,290
You have five seconds
to turn around...

127
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,160
...and return to the city.

128
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
Do it.

129
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,840
Use of live ammunition
has been authorized.

130
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,630
Five.

131
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,930
- They can't shoot people!
- They won't fire.

132
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,850
Three.

133
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,220
- Get them back!
- Two.

134
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,640
- Move!
- One.

135
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,360
Everybody clear out!

136
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,050
Kilo and Romeo squads
rendezvous at sector 01...

137
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,890
...and secure against enemy.

138
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,500
- Grenade!
- Grenade!

139
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,720
Squads three to seven
are on full retreat.

140
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,300
No sir. Suppression measures
have failed. We can't contain it.

141
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,770
The infection is spreading faster
than anyone anticipated.

142
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,600
Dr. Ashford.

143
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,020
- Shouldn't you be on the chopper?
- I'm not going.

144
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,030
I was instructed to get you and
the other scientists out of the hot zone.

145
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,610
You're too important to Umbrella
to be at risk.

146
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,110
I'm not leaving without my daughter.

147
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,790
I'm sorry truly.
But the city is sealed.

148
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,460
She may have survived the crash
but we couldn't find her anywhere.

149
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,710
Even if she were still alive
I couldn't let her out.

150
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,460
The risk of infection is too great.
You must understand.

151
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,050
You do what you have to do.

152
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,550
I'm staying.

153
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,680
There has to be someone left alive.

154
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,550
Come on.

155
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,780
- Matt!
- Take her to the Raccoon City facility.

156
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,950
I want her quarantined.
Close observation.

157
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,130
Prepare her for exposure.

158
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,630
Up the dosage.

159
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,970
Just do it.

160
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,780
We'll rest up soon.

161
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,740
Don't worry about me.

162
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,660
What the fuck is going on?
They were shooting on people.

163
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,160
Innocent people.

164
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,580
Why didn't you guys do something?
You're the police.

165
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,540
Inside.

166
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,920
Inside.

167
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,050
Let's get under cover.

168
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,710
You have to get out.

169
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,210
This is my place. I'm hiding here.

170
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,090
- It's big enough for all of us.
- Don't tell me...

171
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,180
Okay just cool it. Put the gun down.

172
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,970
Put the gun down.

173
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,140
And you take it easy.

174
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,400
There's plenty of ways to get
yourself killed here...

175
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,570
...without getting yourself shot.

176
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,620
Jill Valentine right?

177
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,740
Remember me?
I covered some of your cases...

178
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,160
...before your suspension.

179
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,250
Terri Morales Raccoon 7.

180
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,960
I've seen all your work.

181
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,420
A fan.

182
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,340
Not really.
You do the weather now right?

183
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,720
This is Sergeant Peyton Wells.

184
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,430
What's that you got there?

185
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
My Emmy.

186
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,690
That's if any of us make it out.

187
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,600
So does the Raccoon City
Police Department...

188
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,940
...have any comment
on what those things are?

189
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,940
The Lord's judgment!

190
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,320
Behold I will bring evil
upon this people...

191
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,990
...for they have not hearkened
unto my words nor my law...

192
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,120
...but have rejected it.

193
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,630
Awake ye that dwell in dust.

194
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,630
The dead shall walk amongst
the living...

195
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,300
...and bring damnation unto them.

196
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,840
That's quite a speech.

197
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,800
That was great.
That's gonna make the final cut.

198
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,140
- What was that?
- It's nothing.

199
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,190
Are you all right?

200
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,040
What are you doing?

201
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,160
What's wrong?

202
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,790
It's my sister. She's not well.

203
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,210
- Maybe I can help.
- No.

204
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,420
Out of my way.

205
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,260
Just get out.

206
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,180
You're feeding her? You're sick.

207
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,060
Just leave us alone.

208
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,520
No!

209
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,070
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey.

210
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,410
Hey! Hey no!

211
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,490
Oh my God!

212
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,960
Hey help us! Come on!

213
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,920
Get it in there! Get it in there!

214
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,640
What the hell was that?

215
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,450
There!

216
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,790
Jesus.

217
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,660
- What the fuck is that thing?
- What are you doing?

218
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,620
Get back here.

219
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Peyton.

220
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,550
Terri.

221
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,970
Peyton.

222
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,770
I know.

223
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,320
The Irish dude.

224
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,440
No he's Scottish.

225
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,110
Was.

226
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,240
I count three of them.

227
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,160
They got us boxed in.

228
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,040
What are we gonna do?

229
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,200
You wanna pray for help?

230
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,330
Let's go.

231
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,020
Jesus.

232
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,810
We're gonna need
more ammo. I'm out.

233
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,290
Shit. I'm out.

234
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,930
Move.

235
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,670
Who the fuck are you?

236
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,770
GTA motherfucker!

237
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,850
Oh yeah!

238
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,020
Ten points!

239
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,400
You still looking good baby.

240
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,280
I'll spend 5 dollars
on your stanking ass.

241
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,400
Yuri. You okay?

242
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,490
Bite this.

243
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,170
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

244
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,860
Pull back! Pull back!

245
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,800
This way.

246
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,800
This is Olivera. We've been overrun.
Request immediate chopper evac.

247
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,920
And what the fuck
are we doing here?

248
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,920
Hello?

249
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,430
Am I the only one who's noticing
that we're in a graveyard people?

250
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,470
Okay what's the plan?

251
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,430
Stay alive.

252
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,100
- That's it? That's it?
- That's it.

253
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,480
We need to find somewhere
to stop for a moment.

254
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,400
I don't think that's a good idea.

255
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,230
There might be more of those...

256
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
...things.

257
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,030
If there were more
we'd have seen them by now.

258
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,700
- You know what they are?
- They're bio-weapons...

259
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,870
...from Umbrella labs
beneath the city.

260
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,660
How come you know so much
about Umbrella?

261
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,500
I used to work for them.

262
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,870
Damn it.

263
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,710
Hold it.

264
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,460
What do you think you're doing?

265
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,050
He's wounded.
The infection's spreading.

266
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,470
I'm fine.

267
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,470
You should take care of him now.

268
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,930
It'll be more difficult later.

269
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,640
You know that.

270
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,310
No.

271
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,190
If it comes to that...

272
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,980
...I'II take care of it myself.

273
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,410
As you wish.

274
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,830
It's nothing personal.
But in an hour maybe two...

275
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,540
...you'll be dead.

276
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,330
And moments later
you'll become one of them.

277
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,540
You'll endanger your friends
try to kill them...

278
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,090
...probably succeed.

279
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,430
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

280
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,140
Help me!

281
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,990
There's too many of them.

282
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,820
Let's get out of here.
This way!

283
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,090
Sir T-virus infection
has reached critical levels.

284
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,600
This is a perfect opportunity.

285
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,140
Ensure all data streams
are recorded.

286
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,140
Activate Nemesis Program now.

287
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,470
Alpha Team to base.
This is Alpha Team to base.

288
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,640
- Come in base.
- Hey! Pay attention soldier.

289
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,150
Alpha Team to base.
This is Alpha Team to base.

290
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,810
Come in base.

291
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,320
- You stay focused all right?
- Yes sir.

292
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,360
Alpha Team to base.
This is Alpha...

293
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,700
Why don't they respond Carlos?

294
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,080
- Why don't they evac us huh?
- I don't know.

295
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,910
Why did they send us in here in
first place? We never stood a chance.

296
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,830
- We're not trained for this.
- Wait.

297
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,670
Listen.

298
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,180
- Hey!
- Here! We're down here!

299
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,390
- Hey!
- Come! We're here!

300
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,690
- Where are they going?
- They're landing there. Let's get Yuri!

301
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,320
- Come on Yuri. We're getting out.
- We'll get you fixed up. Come.

302
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,920
Hold on Yuri. We're almost there.

303
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,420
No. No! Don't leave!

304
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:22,050
- Down here! We're coming!
- They dropped something.

305
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,930
Maybe a radio. One that works.

306
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,890
Take Yuri.

307
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,730
Hold on Yuri.

308
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,710
Nicholai put me down.

309
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,340
Okay rest here.

310
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,470
What is this?

311
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,100
Looks like weapon cases.

312
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,980
We don't need weapons.
We need evacuation!

313
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,770
These weren't meant for us.

314
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,240
Yuri!

315
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,010
Plenty to go around.

316
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,690
Don't shoot!

317
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,820
I got the power.

318
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,290
Thank you! Owe you one man.

319
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,620
Shit!

320
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,710
Maybe I was safer outside.

321
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,550
Get them guns out of my damn face.

322
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,840
Motherfucker please. Look...

323
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,590
...my shit is custom.

324
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,860
What the fuck is that?

325
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,580
Shit!

326
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,920
You're going down
you son of a bitch!

327
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,800
Fuck.

328
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,610
Deploy defensive formation.
Take him down.

329
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,240
You fuckers is crazy. Look at that guy
got a rocket launcher.

330
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:17,290
- What do we have?
- A dozen armed men. Well organized.

331
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,210
- I'm surprised there's anyone left.
- They're S.T.A.R.S.

332
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,340
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.
They're the best.

333
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,680
Fire!

334
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,780
Back! Fall back!

335
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,950
- Let's see how good they really are.
- Altering protocols.

336
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,390
S.T.A.R.S.

337
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,520
Oh shit.

338
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,490
Respect.

339
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,590
That's right motherfucker.

340
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Yeah I knew you
wasn't gonna do shit.

341
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,430
Punk son of a bitch!

342
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,310
Shit I'm a bad motherfucker.

343
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,640
I'm a bad mother...

344
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,230
Let me get the fuck up out of here.

345
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,980
What are you staring at?

346
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,740
I'm not sure.

347
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,280
What made you wanna
work for Umbrella?

348
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,490
Girl's gotta make a living.

349
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,450
Those were some pretty slick moves
back there.

350
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,000
I'm good...

351
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,170
...but I'm not that good.

352
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,500
- You should be thankful for that.
- What do you mean?

353
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,970
They did something to me.

354
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,930
I barely feel human anymore.

355
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,350
We should keep moving.
Before the sound attracts anything.

356
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Keep moving.

357
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,960
- Hello?
- God I thought you'd never answer.

358
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,720
- Who is this?
- I can get you out of the city.

359
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,380
All four of you.

360
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,010
But first we have
to come to an arrangement.

361
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,180
Are you ready to make a deal?

362
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,560
- Do we have a choice?
- Not if you want to live past tonight no.

363
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,980
His name is Dr. Ashford and he...

364
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:36,190
Runs the genetics and viral research
division of Umbrella Corporation.

365
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,650
What's he want with us?

366
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,280
His daughter Angela
is trapped in the city.

367
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:43,240
Umbrella was to evac her
but she didn't make it.

368
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,160
She's hiding out in her school.

369
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,160
We find her he'll help us escape
the perimeter.

370
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,580
No fucking deal.

371
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,710
We find the building with
the thickest walls and doors...

372
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,170
...and we barricade ourselves in.
Sit tight wait for help.

373
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,420
There won't be any help.

374
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,340
Umbrella knows
they can't contain the infection.

375
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:05,760
So at sunrise this morning Raccoon
City will be completely sanitized.

376
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,140
What do you mean by "sanitized"?

377
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,770
A precision tactical nuclear device.

378
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,900
- What yield?
- Five kilotons.

379
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,190
- Fuck me.
- Stupid.

380
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:23,200
- What does that mean?
- It means it'll destroy the infection...

381
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,030
...and all evidence of it.

382
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,830
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!

383
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,330
No fucking way would they
get away with that!

384
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,170
- It would be all over the fucking news!
- Cover-up.

385
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,960
Cover-up's already prepared.

386
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,970
A meltdown
at the nuclear power plant.

387
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,800
- A tragic accident.
- Not even Umbrella is capable of this.

388
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,550
Not capable?

389
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,100
Peyton you were there at the bridge.

390
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,230
You know exactly how far
Umbrella will go.

391
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,030
So what do we do now huh?

392
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,280
I think we should be out of here
by sunrise.

393
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,660
What if there is no way out and he's
watching us on these cameras...

394
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,040
...like this is some kind
of sick game?

395
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
- What is it?
- What's going on?

396
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,670
- Wait.
- Sunrise ain't gonna wait.

397
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,340
No.

398
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,090
- There's something down there.
- Where?

399
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,100
There.

400
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,470
I don't see anything.

401
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,270
That doesn't alter the fact that
there is something down there.

402
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,060
I'm getting sick of this bullshit!

403
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,610
Peyton!

404
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,780
No!

405
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,530
He's located another two
S.T.A.R.S. members.

406
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,250
Nemesis.

407
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,630
Run. Just go!

408
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,300
Primary target is identified.

409
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:11,560
Gentlemen this is what
we've been waiting for.

410
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,100
Confirm at 2:18 and 27 seconds.

411
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:19,690
The Nemesis Program is now
fully activated.

412
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,480
Look I'm...
I'm sorry about your friend.

413
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,860
Let's just get to the school
and find this kid.

414
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,160
Peyton!

415
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,190
This bite...

416
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,020
...it won't stop bleeding.

417
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,860
- Why didn't they see us?
- What?

418
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:56,110
The chopper. We were right there
in the street in front of the hospital.

419
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,950
- How could they not see us?
- They saw us.

420
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,540
What do you mean?

421
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,960
We're assets Nicholai.

422
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,960
Expendable assets.

423
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,800
And we've just been expended.

424
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,730
Stop!

425
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,110
I'm not one of those things.

426
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:33,570
Hey remember me? Look I haven't
been bitten or anything. Look.

427
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,280
Climb aboard.

428
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,280
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.

429
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:44,700
You can call me L.J. on account
of the informal situation.

430
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,880
We're gonna have to split up
to search this place.

431
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:38,130
Forget it. Forget it! I'm not going
out there by myself.

432
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,220
I can go with you.

433
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,350
You take the first floor.

434
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:44,890
You take the second.

435
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,890
I'll take the basement.

436
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,270
- I've never shot a gun before.
- There's nothing to it.

437
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,480
Point pull repeat.

438
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,690
Try to hit them in the head.

439
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,550
Point...

440
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,890
...pull...

441
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,600
...repeat.

442
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:35,440
Point pull repeat.

443
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,120
I see you mother...

444
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,500
Oh shit!

445
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,460
Elvis!

446
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,760
So did you get the call as well?

447
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,470
- What?
- You're here for the girl?

448
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,760
Oh yeah yeah. The girl.

449
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,270
Dr. Ashford didn't say he made a deal
with someone else.

450
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:52,930
I guess we're partners.

451
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,780
Shit.

452
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,470
Angela?

453
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,680
It's gonna be okay.

454
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,390
There's no need to be afraid.

455
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,980
We're gonna take you home.

456
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,490
Oh my God.

457
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,330
Help me!

458
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,760
Terri?

459
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,820
You can't help her.

460
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,740
Not now.

461
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,410
I've seen what they do.

462
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,710
- Are you Angela?
- Yes.

463
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,460
We should hurry
before they come back.

464
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,090
Hold this.

465
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,390
Angela Ashford huh?

466
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:58,230
That's a pretty grown-up name
for a little girl.

467
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,310
I'm not a little girl.

468
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,230
Besides...

469
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:06,150
- ... all my friends call me Angie.
- Angie huh?

470
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,570
I like that.

471
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,740
Those things are in here.

472
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,750
It's okay honey. They're slow.
We can run around them.

473
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,870
No.

474
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,920
Not them.

475
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,420
Them.

476
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,130
Get back.

477
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,620
Stay.

478
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,790
Thought you might need a hand.

479
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,620
- You work for Umbrella?
- Used to.

480
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:09,130
Until they left us for dead in this place.
Now I consider myself freelance.

481
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:14,050
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev
at your service.

482
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,720
- Come on!
- Wait! Angie!

483
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:20,140
Save the girl! I've got this bitch.

484
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,820
Oh shit.

485
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:41,200
From now on stay right beside me.

486
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,080
It's blocked.

487
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,130
What do we do now?

488
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,520
Wait here. Eyes:

489
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,600
Okay?

490
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,900
Thank you.

491
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,320
You two know each other?

492
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,410
She's infected.

493
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,830
She's infected on a massive level.

494
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,660
- How can you know that?
- Because she is too.

495
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:51,580
You're infected? When were
you gonna tell us that?

496
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,800
- Let me see.
- No.

497
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,060
You know I'm not gonna hurt you.

498
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,480
Let me see.

499
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,500
It's the antivirus
the cure to the T-virus.

500
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,920
There's a cure?

501
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:36,590
How did you get this?

502
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,220
My daddy.
My daddy made it for me.

503
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:43,760
He's sick.
And someday I'II get sick too.

504
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,680
He just wanted to stop that.

505
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,600
When I was little...

506
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,690
...I had to walk on crutches.

507
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:54,310
They said I'd never get better
just worse.

508
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,400
He found a way
to make me stronger.

509
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,530
The T-virus.

510
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:05,370
Then they took the invention
away from him.

511
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,160
Get out of my house!

512
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,590
He's not a bad man.

513
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:19,300
He didn't mean for any of this.

514
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,550
It's okay.

515
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,810
Don't shoot! He's cool.

516
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,650
He made a deal with Dr. Doom
same as you.

517
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,820
How many of you guys are there?

518
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,740
What do you mean?

519
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,240
Nicholai.

520
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,290
When were you bitten?

521
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:57,170
- Three hours ago.
- What the...?

522
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,260
It's your lucky day.

523
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,430
Should have told me you got bit.
I'm hanging with you and shit.

524
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:18,020
- Let me speak to my daughter.
- First you tell us how we're getting out.

525
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:21,730
There's a helicopter
already being prepped.

526
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,650
It takes off in 47 minutes.

527
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:29,030
It'll be the last transport to leave
Raccoon City before they detonate.

528
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,950
I take it this helicopter isn't
laid out just for us.

529
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,370
No. It has another purpose
but it'll be lightly guarded.

530
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:39,500
- Where's the evac site?
- May I speak to my daughter now?

531
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,380
- Daddy?
- Hey sweetheart.

532
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:49,180
- Are you all right?
- When can I see you?

533
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:51,810
Soon. These people will
bring you to see me.

534
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:53,640
I'll see you very soon.

535
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,480
Put the lady back on.

536
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:57,900
Where do we have to go?

537
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,190
The helicopter will be at city hall.

538
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,440
I suggest you make haste.

539
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:11,950
Computers...

540
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:14,330
...so unreliable.

541
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,840
Just like people.

542
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,180
You really thought I didn't know?

543
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,360
So what are you injecting me with?

544
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:48,280
The antivirus.

545
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,990
The T-virus reanimates dead cells.

546
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,200
Basically bringing the dead to life.

547
01:04:56,370 --> 01:05:00,540
Or in a living human
it can cause uncontrollable mutation.

548
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:05,210
Or it can help her walk again
if the virus is kept in check with this.

549
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,670
- Angie's infected?
- Yes.

550
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,590
The cellular growth is enough
to regenerate her...

551
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,890
...but not enough to cause mutation.

552
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,510
And they infected you
with the T-virus as well?

553
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,770
Yeah.

554
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:20,640
But don't worry.
I'm not contagious.

555
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,980
Here.

556
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:29,610
Tape the story.
I'll see that it gets put to good use.

557
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,490
My name is Alice.

558
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:36,580
I worked for the
Umbrella Corporation...

559
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:41,580
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

560
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:47,090
I was head of security at a secret
high-tech facility called The Hive...

561
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:51,090
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

562
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:53,090
...viral weaponry.

563
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,620
Let's go.

564
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,290
You missed one.

565
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,740
We have to hurry.

566
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:05,950
- We're okay. We have time.
- No! We have to hurry.

567
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:11,330
- Holy shit! We stealing his ride!
- Take off.

568
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:15,630
- I said take off!
- What's the rush?

569
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,380
We've been expecting you.

570
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:27,180
- Perimeter secure.
- All sectors locked down.

571
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:37,650
- Angie!
- Daddy!

572
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:42,490
- I knew you wouldn't leave me.
- No. Never.

573
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,660
Discard primary weaponry.

574
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:04,430
The two of you showed such promise
but we had to see you in action.

575
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,260
And most impressive you've been.

576
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,180
You're like brother and sister.

577
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:13,730
Heightened speed strength
agility the same killer instincts.

578
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,150
Parallel strands of research.

579
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,400
And now...
Now we'll discover which is superior.

580
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:25,030
Fight him.

581
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:27,700
No.

582
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,200
Fight him or they die.

583
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,920
What makes you think I care?

584
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:42,260
Daddy! Daddy no.

585
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,430
No.

586
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:47,640
He was a valuable asset
to the corporation.

587
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,810
I don't even care
about these people.

588
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,070
Begin.

589
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:45,480
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

590
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,740
Matt!

591
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:55,410
Cellular structure breaking down.

592
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:58,410
T- virus is manifesting itself
in a genetic mutation.

593
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:05,090
We're seeing similar
cellular regeneration.

594
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,090
I'm sorry.

595
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:12,970
Oh Matt. I'm so sorry.

596
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,270
Finish him.

597
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:21,770
I said finish him.

598
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,520
No.

599
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:27,440
No.

600
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:32,070
Don't you understand
how important you are to me?

601
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,450
That creature is one thing
but you...

602
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:38,160
...somehow you bonded
with the T-virus on a cellular level.

603
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,960
You adapted it changed it.
You became magnificent.

604
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,500
- I became a freak.
- No.

605
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:49,460
You're not mutation.
You're evolution.

606
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:53,720
With my help just imagine
what you can achieve.

607
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,220
What about him?

608
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,640
Evolution has its dead ends.

609
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:06,150
Now finish this.
Put him out of his misery...

610
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:08,480
...and come with me.

611
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,070
No.

612
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,780
You're such
a disappointment to me.

613
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,490
All that strength...

614
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:22,080
...but no will to use it.

615
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,210
What a waste.

616
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,680
Prepare for takeoff.

617
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:43,020
Sanitation of Raccoon City
to commence on my mark.

618
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:54,030
Kill her.

619
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,250
What are you doing?

620
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,220
Get us airborne.

621
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:33,400
This is Cain. Priority overload.
Initiate launch proceedings.

622
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:37,240
Detonation set
at T-minus 5 minutes.

623
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,250
Angie get down!

624
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,300
Why haven't we taken off?

625
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:59,300
Because I usually drive a Cadillac.

626
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:21,320
Surrender or we open fire.

627
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:52,810
Drop it.

628
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:01,200
Alice!

629
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:10,330
Drop your weapon and surrender.

630
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:50,120
Let's get this thing in the air!

631
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,130
You have to get up.

632
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:05,680
Matt...

633
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,180
Come on we have to go.
We have to go. Come on.

634
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,940
Come on.

635
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,240
Get up!

636
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:31,080
If you expect me to beg I will not.

637
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,500
Wait.

638
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:46,590
Killing me won't put things right.

639
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:48,600
No...

640
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,600
...but it's a start.

641
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:04,090
Are you going to be all right?

642
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:40,790
Hang on to something!

643
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,270
We're going down!

644
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:39,770
U-Gamma 9 to base.
Confirmation.

645
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,600
We've located the crash site.

646
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:57,330
Fetch the medical team.

647
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,120
What about the others?

648
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:02,790
No other bodies found sir.

649
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:18,890
We have unconfirmed reports
of disaster at Raccoon City.

650
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,890
These shocking images just in.

651
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,190
A mysterious plague
or viral outbreak has run rampant...

652
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:27,690
Implicating Umbrella Corporation
in deaths of innocent citizens.

653
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:32,240
This tape work of former Raccoon 7
anchorwoman Terri Morales.

654
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,820
New evidence now
discredits earlier reports...

655
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:38,490
- Nothing more than sick joke.
- Fake videotape totally discredited.

656
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,240
Nothing more than a big hoax.

657
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:42,290
Playing on the very real tragedy...

658
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,830
...which overwhelmed
Raccoon City this week.

659
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,170
The reactor at the nuclear
power station went critical.

660
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:52,960
The worst atomic disaster since the
Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986.

661
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:56,510
The state governor personally
thanked the Umbrella Corporation...

662
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,050
...for their swift action.

663
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:01,930
The perpetrators of the hoax
Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...

664
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,020
...now being sought
for questioning by the police.

665
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:20,370
Alice.

666
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,700
Alice.

667
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:32,800
Alice wake up.

668
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,720
Can you hear me?

669
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:43,180
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

670
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,190
Good.

671
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:52,440
Begin the purging process.

672
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,930
Her recovery's remarkable.

673
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,600
And her powers
both physical and mental...

674
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:28,770
...are developing
at a geometric rate.

675
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:43,410
Where are you?

676
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,160
You're safe.

677
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:48,160
Come on.

678
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,500
That's it.

679
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:54,630
There we are.

680
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:08,470
Do you know what that is?

681
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:11,940
It's a pen.

682
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,520
You see?

683
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,480
You try.

684
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:20,490
That's it.

685
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,160
Pen.

686
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,620
Look at me.

687
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:35,290
Can you remember anything?

688
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,550
You remember your name?

689
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:43,340
My name?

690
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,050
My name.

691
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,350
I want her under
24-hour observation.

692
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:54,350
A complete set of blood work.

693
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,900
Chemical and electrolyte analysis
by the end of the day.

694
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:00,570
My name.

695
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:03,360
- My name.
- Sir.

696
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:05,530
Advanced reflex testing is a priority.

697
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:06,700
My name.

698
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:09,700
- Monitor electrical impulses...
- Sir.

699
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,370
Sir!

700
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:16,920
What is it?

701
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:23,220
My name...

702
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,220
...is Alice.

703
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:31,720
And I remember everything.

704
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,970
This is central.
Request immediate backup.

705
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:07,130
Maximum response.

706
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,300
Thank you gentlemen.
We'll take over from here.

707
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:53,810
- On whose authority?
- Classified. Level six authorization.

708
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:57,890
Sorry sir.

709
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:56,870
Let them go.

710
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,670
Good to have you back.

711
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,880
Are you all right?

712
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,460
Program Alice activated.

713
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:15,640
What did they do to you?

714
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:39,280
This is a product of the
Umbrella Corporation.

715
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:41,990
Our business is life itself.

716
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:45,000
Some side effects may occur.
