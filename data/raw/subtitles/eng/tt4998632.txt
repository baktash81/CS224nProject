00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,133

No, I saw the way you-you
handled the whole situation.

That's why I want to do

398

Scott, Scott,
I'm gonna give you some advice

399
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:21,454
'cause you're new
and you talk too much.

400
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,986
Yeah, I-I do.

401
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:24,286
It's just a job. Nothing else.

00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:32,822
Ah. I see what they say about
you is true. That's a bummer.

405
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,794
What, you're just
gonna drop that?

406
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,530
Oh, you want me to take
the bait. Okay. Give it to me.

407
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,204
You're the best paramedic

408
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,870
you can keep anyone alive
for 20 minutes...

410

to be your partner.

411
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:46,772
I already did my research.

412
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:53,011
Well, there's definitely
something wrong with me, Scott.

413
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,715
Okay, maybe I'm just trying
to get to know you.

414
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,519
You think about that?
So we don't have to sit

415
00:16:57,654 --> 00:16:59,189
in that car
and be awkward the whole time.

416

I'm into.

417
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,654
I feel like I may have said
something too much,

418
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,997
so I'm just gonna rewind,

419
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:09,160
retract a little bit here, okay?

420
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,837

at the end of the day. Uh...

Okay.

00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:20,847
Um, I'm from Thousand Oaks,
but I was raised in Tarzana.

- Wow. Tarzana.

425
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:25,182
Wait, hold up.
So you don't know her name?

426
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:27,048
I do know her name.
Her name's Kim.

427
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:28,348
- Kim?
- Yeah.

428
00:17:28,484 --> 00:17:30,851
Okay, so did you ask Kim out?

429
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:32,355
No.

430
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:34,556
But I'm seeing her
across the bank, right?

431
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:37,428

And it's electric.

ZACH: Yeah, you know,
I was thinking about

515
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,524
starting a savings account.
(clears throat)

516
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:35,393
Oh, nice. We've got some great
junior accounts.

517
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:37,220
- I'll let you in in 20 minutes.
- Yeah?

518
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,695
You know what, though,
'cause, um...

519
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,328
if I could just get it done
real quick,

520
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:41,993
'cause I'm on the clock.

521
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,661
Uh, promise not
to rob the place.

522
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,404
(Danny laughs)

523
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,536
- What do you think?
- Promise?

524
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:49,035
- I won't rob it.
- Seriously.

525
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,675
'Cause that would be bad
for my job, you know.

526
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,204
- (laughs) I promise.
- All right, okay. All right.

527
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:53,974
- All right, come on in. Okay.
- Okay. All right.

528
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,050
ZACH:
Thought I'd give you a try.

529
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:00,585
I saw your commercials.

530
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:02,048
- Really emotional.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

531
00:23:02,184 --> 00:23:03,854
Yeah, the one with
the airplane and the dog.

532
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,424
- I mean, gets me every time.
- Yeah, that was really cute.

533
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,019
Well, I'm sure Big Bob
can help you over here.

534
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,528
Uh, I can help you
right over here.

535
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:11,390
- ZACH: Oh, that's-that's okay.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:14,023
(quietly): Can the woman next
to him help me out? Over there.

537
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:16,062
Uh, I think her name is Kim.

538
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:19,028
Kim? Could you just
tell me her last name?

539
00:23:19,163 --> 00:23:20,740
I just want to be thorough.

540
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,200
Uh...

541
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,536
- Last name. Her-her name.
- Sorry, what?

542
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,202
Her full name.

543
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,440
- Kim?
- Uh, yeah. Just, Kim who?

544
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,213
Park.

545
00:23:30,348 --> 00:23:32,117
Park. Okay, swell.

546
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:33,582
Okay, Kim's fantastic.

547
00:23:33,717 --> 00:23:35,114
DANNY:
Kim, you have a visitor.

548
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,054
- Make it quick.
- (Zach sighs, clears throat)

549
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:38,923
Hi. Hello.

550
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:40,218
Um...

551
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:43,859
This is gonna sound
a little crazy, uh...

552
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,961
- What is it?
- Well, I-I've...

553
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:50,401
I've been in here
in the bank a few times...

554
00:23:50,536 --> 00:23:52,571
Wow, it's really
just me in here.

555
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:55,298
Um, uh, I-I was personally
gonna... gonna try

556
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,574
and play it a little cooler,
but my...

557
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,270
my-my partner in there,
you see...

558
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,271
He's right out there
in this... in the car.

559
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,241
He just wanted me
to come in and...

560
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,241
say something to you,
'cause I told myself

561
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,944
that if I ever got
the chance to,

562
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,955
that I would ask you out...

563
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,557
on a date.

564
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,590
Like, right now?

565
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:17,121
Doesn't have to be. (chuckles)

566
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:18,824
Could...
It-it could be another time.

567
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,165
Maybe this weekend or something.

568
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,163
Um, but obviously,

569
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:25,434
it doesn't seem like
a great time... (chuckles)

570
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:28,431
right now, so I, uh...

571
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:34,312
Hey, are you okay?

572
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:36,539
Fucked up the name, didn't I?

573
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,480
No. Uh-uh-uh-uh. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

574
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:41,015
No, no, no, no, no.

575
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,821
These are the decisions
that matter in life,

576
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:44,621
so let me give you all the
information before you decide.

577
00:24:44,757 --> 00:24:46,450
Okay, I have two guns,
fully auto.

578
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,521
One's aimed at you,
and the other one's at Kim,

579
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:50,290
your girlfriend.

580
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:51,960
I have you, the tellers,
and nine employees in the back,

581
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:53,663
and your partner outside,
and it's up to you

582
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,366
to make sure
that they are all safe.

583
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:57,968
Yeah, kind of a heavy burden.

584
00:24:59,004 --> 00:25:01,332
I need you to nod
if you understand, Officer.

585
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:07,009
Now, take your fucking hand
off the weapon.

586
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:10,275
Give me a big smile
and wave at your partner.

587
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,310
There you go.
Yeah, there you go.

588
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:17,046
- Yeah. All right.
- WILL: Fuck.

589
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,322
Let's go, D. Let's go.

590
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:20,689
$32 million, guys.

591
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:22,155
It's all yours. Please take it.

592
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:23,857
We don't want any problems.
I'm out of here.

593
00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:25,728
- Hey.
- Hello, sir. Yes, sir.

594
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:27,159
Million per block, man.
You ever seen

595
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:28,826
any shit like this
in Afghanistan, brother?

596
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,402
WILL:
Once.

597
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:32,068
I was giving it to the Taliban.

598
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:33,205
(whoops)

599
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:34,834
WILL:
Hey, work fast.

600
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,842
My wife's gonna be very happy.

601
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:38,503
Whoa...

602
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,511
Yep.

603
00:25:40,647 --> 00:25:42,714
WILL:
Eight million per bag.

604
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:52,754
Hey, pick up the radio, dude.

605
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,683
Been out here so long. Come on.

606
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,359
RANDAZZO: You've got
nothing to do all fucking day

607
00:25:56,494 --> 00:25:57,723
but bust my balls.

608
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,027
I told you I'm busy.

609
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,728
Yeah, I'm glad
you're taking a bath.

610
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:03,163
I hope you fucking drown.

611
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:08,898
Babycakes, kiss the kids.

612
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,433
I got to go now.

613
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,875
Oh, fuck.
There's a cop around front.

614
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,043
(engine chugging,
brakes squeaking)

615
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:18,781
- (engine stops)
- God, this fucking truck.

616
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:20,884
- Son of a bitch!
- (engine sputtering)

617
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,113
DANNY (over radio):
Randazzo, let's roll.

618
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,546
- Here we go.
- It's down.

619
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:25,789
Pig's not working, Danny.

620
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:28,060
I told you this thing's
a f-fucking pig,

621
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:29,926
piece of shit.

622
00:26:31,364 --> 00:26:32,893
Fuck. He's coming.

623
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:34,758
Yeah, the copper's coming over.

624
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:39,068
Let me see... let me see if I
can bullshit this fucking guy.

625
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:42,068
- Oh, how you doing, Officer?
- Hey there. No go?

626
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:44,070
Yeah, you know
the way these trucks...

627
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:46,536
they're funny sometimes,
you know?

628
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,780
Trent!

629
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,109
Why are you using
my real name, dude?

630
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,775
What the hell are you doing?

631
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,253
- Shopping for my girlfriend.
- Leave the lady alone.

632
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:57,220
Let's go, dumbass.

633
00:26:58,223 --> 00:27:00,550
He's not swearing at you,
Vivian. He's just a dick.

634
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,423
Ooh!

635
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,095
- That's a nice-looking engine.
- I got him in front.

636
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,096
Should I fucking kill him?
Should I run him over?

637
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,000
We're gonna leave one by one.

638
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:15,499
Nobody raise their head.
Do not get up!

639
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,601
You are almost there.
You are almost there.

640
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:21,113
MARK:
Try it now.

641
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:22,471
(engine starts)

642
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:23,809
All right, what do you know,
Officer?

643
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,277
You saved the day.

644
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,179
Sometimes you just
got to look at her.

645
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:28,519
Officer Ranshaw,
I'm gonna drop you off

646
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:30,152
one of my mother's cannolis.

647
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,817
- You have a great day. God bless you.
- All right.

648
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:34,089
Thank you, Officer.

649
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:37,690
(sandals squeaking)

650
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:38,995
Randazzo!

651
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:42,290
You are all gonna have
the greatest story

652
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:43,664
to tell at dinner tonight.

653
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,297
Hey, you! Stay down!

654
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,634
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Come on.

655
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,135
Let's go! Let's go!

656
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:49,775
Randazzo, it's time to party,
brother.

657
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:58,113
Fuck. What's taking him so long?

658
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:00,982
Let's go. Let's go.

659
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:02,447
- Let's go.
- Move, move, move, move.

660
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:06,823
Shit. Get down! Get out!

661
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,618
DANNY:
Move, move, move! Come on!

662
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:14,294
Ah, you motherfucker!

663
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:17,895
- (tapping buttons)
- Come on! Fuck!

664
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,336
Get outside!

665
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:20,703
Get outside now!

666
00:28:20,838 --> 00:28:23,235
(frantic chatter, screaming)

667
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:24,704
- It's go time.
- Oh, shit. Let's go.

668
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,306
Shit. Get SWAT.

669
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,708
(people screaming)

670
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:38,753
(tires squealing)

671
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:40,826
- S.I.S.! S.I.S.!
- S.I.S.!

672
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:43,686
Randazzo!

673
00:28:45,864 --> 00:28:47,899
- Wrong door!
- (siren wailing)

674
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,262
DANNY:
Go, go, go, go! Mel!

675
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,662
Mel Gibson, go!
Don't shoot a cop!

676
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,666
Ah, you idiot! Come on!

677
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:05,417
Go, go, go, go, go!
Get down! Down, down, down!

678
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:07,582
Come on, come on, come on!

679
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:09,046
Come on, Will.

680
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,412
Where's Randazzo?

681
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,280
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

682
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,721
Let's go, Will. Come on!

683
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:15,355
WILL:
Move!

684
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:28,731
RANDAZZO:

00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,090
- I-I don't know.
- Are you sure?

857
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:34,722
- I don't know.
- Okay. Move.

858
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,223
No exit.
Probably got the femur.

859
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:39,558
Okay.

860
00:37:39,694 --> 00:37:41,128
Shed me light, shed me light.

861
00:37:41,263 --> 00:37:42,594
Over here.

862
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:44,125
- What's his name?
- Zach.

863
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,903
Okay. Give me this.
Give me this.

864
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,805
Zach. Zach, buddy.

865
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,566
Come to me.

866
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,403
Zach. Hey, buddy.

867
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:54,379
Come to me. Come to me.

868
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,278
- There he is. There he is.
- (gasping)

869
00:37:58,414 --> 00:37:59,478
Let's carry him up.

870

Help us. One, two, three.

871
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:04,084
- Go!
- (grunting)

872
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,589
Clear.

873
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:07,487
- Hey, hey. You're okay now.
- Come on, go, go.

874
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:09,486
I had him go in for a girl.

875
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:11,088
It's my fault.

876
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:12,925
- I had him go in for a girl.
- Mark, save it.

877

- (siren blares)

878
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:24,438
Call Memorial.
Tell them we have

879
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:26,004
an ETA of seven minutes, okay?

880
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,813
'Cause you're driving
like a goddamned granny.

881
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:32,278
Zach, I'm gonna be
helping you, okay?

Shit. Call trauma.

Tell them to activate the team.

We're gonna need lots of blood.

He's hypotensive

fucking gun pointed
at me right now.

That wasn't a question.

We don't have a choice.
Let's go.

904
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:20,162
Step back up.

905
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:21,560
What do you want?

906
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:22,824
Just gonna borrow it.

907
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,991
All right? Come on.

908
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,530
Did you shoot him already?

909
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:26,730
No, I did not shoot him.

910
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:28,033
Will, bring the bags here.

A lot of running.

919
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:53,356
Just like any other day
for you, Camille,

920

except the life you save today
might be your own.

We got cops ahead.

DANNY: All right, look, Cam,
we can shoot our way

933
00:40:20,022 --> 00:40:21,616
out of this,
or you can help us, all right?

934
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:23,858
I'm gonna need you to help us.
Why don't you help us?

935
00:40:25,193 --> 00:40:26,563

What's your hospital, Cam?

938
00:40:30,368 --> 00:40:31,901
It's-it's L.A. Memorial.

shit, shit, shit.

Who let you in here?
Who let you in?

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I got an officer down!

Let me see your hands.

Chris, Chris, hold it.

WILL: Hey, I'm just a...
I'm just a driver.

951

I've got an officer down.

952

Ready? Go.

953
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:59,659

I got a...

955
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,467
I got a cop shot.
We got to go. Move your cars.

956
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:05,100
We got to get him
to the hospital.

957
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:06,571
Move!

958
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,431
It's a cop!

Let me do my job!
What are you doing?

- All right. Fine.

00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:15,338
He's a cop.
Let's get him out of here.

962
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,108
All right, let's go.
Get him out of here.

963
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:18,612

- All right, let's go!

964
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:20,616
Let's go! Let's go, people!

Make a hole. Get 'em out.

See? That wasn't so hard.

971
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,004
Give me your phone.
G-Give me your phone.

972
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:41,366
Yeah, yeah.

973
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:42,669
(sniffs)

974
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:44,035
Lights. I need lights. Lights.

00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,809
CAM:
Center console. The red button.

976
00:41:45,944 --> 00:41:47,011

Hey, Will. We got through it.

979
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:55,653
Not as tight as I wanted,
but we got through it.

(sighs)

981
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:03,819
$16 million. $16 million.

982

983
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,825
WILL: Say, Cam, how does
your company track this thing?

984
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,667
CAM:
Satellite.

985
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,205
Found it.

986
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,538
(device clatters)

987
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:20,508
I'm gonna work on him now.

988
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:22,339
Is that okay with you?

989
00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:24,845
DANNY: Yeah, yeah.
Work on saving the rookie.

990
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:26,677
MARK:
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, buddy!

991
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:27,844
What happened?

992
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,213
Hey, what happened?

993
00:42:29,348 --> 00:42:30,752
Where's the ambulance?
What happened?

994
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:32,181
- Huh?
- They took the ambulance.

995
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,153
- Say "they"?
- They took...

996
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:37,355
1-Adam-25 to Control.

997
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,924
Suspects have hijacked
a red and white ambulance.

998
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,759
The ambulance got my partner.

999
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,833
They got my partner.

1000
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:49,767
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

1001
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:51,533
Hey, listen. Hey.

1002
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:55,174
You tell me exactly
what they look like.

1003
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:57,744
DANNY:
Backup car's on Flower, Will.

1004
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,546
Just at the end of the street.

1005
00:42:59,681 --> 00:43:00,880
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1006
00:43:01,016 --> 00:43:02,584
- Hey, give me your radio.
- What?

1007
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,380
DANNY:
Give me your radio.

1008
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:06,049
CAM: What are you gonna do
with those?

1009
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:07,592
DANNY:
Don't worry about that.

1010
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:09,726
You're not gonna put those
on me, are you?

1011
00:43:09,862 --> 00:43:11,256
When we're clear,
I'm gonna call 911.

1012
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:12,954
I'm gonna tell them
where you are. Okay?

1013
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:14,725
All right?

1014
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,460
Yeah. Hey.

1015
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:18,299
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to point the gun at you.

1016
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:19,902
(chuckling): I don't really
like pointing guns at anybody.

1017
00:43:20,038 --> 00:43:21,970
It's not really my thing,
but, like, when you...

1018
00:43:22,106 --> 00:43:23,632
I mean, what was I
supposed to do, you know?

1019
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,776
I know it's funny, but it's...
I'm sort of more of

1020
00:43:25,912 --> 00:43:27,606
the sensitive one
of the two of us. It's...

1021
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:29,780
(siren whooping)

1022
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:36,317
Hey, boss.

1023
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:38,089
Jesus.

1024
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:39,315
Talk to me.

1025
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:40,756
How does something
like this go down

1026
00:43:40,892 --> 00:43:42,586
right in front
of LAPD headquarters?

1027
00:43:42,722 --> 00:43:44,324
So the Brooklyn crew we've been
following, they're all dead.

1028
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,923
Yeah, we think it's an L.A.
crew inside the ambulance.

1029
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:47,291
Oh, we got a new crew?

1030
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:49,466
We don't know.
It's looking that way.

1031
00:43:49,601 --> 00:43:50,930
Talk to me about that ambulance.

1032
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:52,669
- Who fucked that up?
- We did.

1033
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:54,438
- It was a clusterfuck.
- You think?

1034
00:43:54,573 --> 00:43:55,971
But the rookie screwed us up

1035
00:43:56,107 --> 00:43:57,333
trying to get his future
ex-wife's phone number.

1036

MARK:
What's that? What'd you say?

1037
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,507
You're the one
that caused this mess.

1038
00:44:00,642 --> 00:44:01,941
(laughter)

1039
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:03,440

- Hey!

1040

Calm down
before I smash your ass

1043
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:08,610
- back to the academy.
- Stop.

1044
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:09,851
- You're the reason we're in this.
- Stop!

1045
00:44:09,987 --> 00:44:11,280
Mark, right?
Can I call you Mark?

1046
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,790
- Yeah.
- That was my call, Mark.

1047
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:14,825
You want to blame somebody,
you blame me.

1048
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,957
Now it's my job to get
your partner back, okay?

1049
00:44:17,092 --> 00:44:19,191
- His name's Zach.
- All right.

1050
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,459
Three months out of the academy.
Good kid.

1051
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:23,793
- He's gonna be all right.
- You know that for sure?

1052
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:26,936
No, but I know I got the best
possible people on it, okay?

- What the hell?

1058
00:44:48,526 --> 00:44:49,990
We're screwed.

1059
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:52,291
- We got an airship.
- DANNY: What?

1060
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,495
Airship.

1061
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,164
Where?

1062
00:44:57,299 --> 00:44:58,667
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1063

You sure they see us or not?

- Yeah, no, no. Shit. Look.
- WILL: I'm not sure.

1065
00:45:02,142 --> 00:45:03,340

over us. They didn't see us.

(distant sirens wailing)

1067

Really, really wasn't expecting
helicopters today.

1068
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,407
- You think we should bounce on foot?
- No, no.

1069
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:12,408
The stash car's too far.
We won't make it.

We're a sitting duck, Will.
We got to move.

1074
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:20,920
We're not gonna do anything.
We're just sitting here.

1075
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:22,253
I got to get back to my wife

1076
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:23,518
and my son, Danny,
no matter what.

1077
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:24,862
You're going to.
You drove generals

1078
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:26,557
and politicians in Kabul.
You can do this.

1079
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:28,358
- This ain't Kabul, man.
- I know. It's L. fucking A.

1080
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:29,698
Nobody knows this city
better than you.

1081
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,165
Nobody drives better than you.

1082
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:35,235

What's going on back there?

It's good.
I'm just helping him.

Stop it!

00:57:43,732 --> 00:57:45,596
Never a dull moment with you.

1363
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:47,999
Why are you calling me?

1364
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,604
Look, I need help.
I need a diversion.

1365
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,936
I'm kind of in
a dealmaking mood.

1366
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:53,636
MONROE:
<i>All right. Start boxing them in</i>

1367
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,612
(sirens blaring)

1368
00:57:59,113 --> 00:58:00,644
You should've thought of that
before, Danny.

1369
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,113
You're on your own now.

1370
00:58:02,248 --> 00:58:03,785
Look, I got 16 million
in here right now.

1371
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,622
You throw me a lifeline,
I'll give you half.

1372
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,493
DANNY:
<i>Come on, Papi.</i>

1373
00:58:09,628 --> 00:58:11,459
<i>Do it for my dad.
You're family.</i>

1374
00:58:11,595 --> 00:58:12,826
I know about the Zetas, Papi.

1375
00:58:12,961 --> 00:58:14,290
I know about the money
you owe them.

1376
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:15,623
You save my ass,
you can buy 'em out tonight.

1377
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:17,033
(groans)

1378
00:58:17,168 --> 00:58:19,299
(sirens blaring)

1379
00:58:19,434 --> 00:58:20,697
What's the plan?

1380
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:22,366
Look, it's simple.

1381
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:23,798
I just need your guys to
pick up some trucks Downtown.

1382
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,509
We got a deal?

1383
00:58:25,645 --> 00:58:27,535
We just steal them
from the yard, yeah?

1384
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,642
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man,
we'll pick 'em up. Don't worry.

1385
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:31,639
I'll get Roberto right now.

1386
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:32,979
Goddamn.

1387
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,154
Saddle up. We're on the move.

1388
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:38,378
ROBERTO:
What's up?

1389
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:40,718
It's insane,
and it's our ticket.

1390
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:42,689
DANNY:
Make your moves.

1391
00:58:42,824 --> 00:58:45,158
(sportscaster speaking Spanish)

1392
00:58:45,293 --> 00:58:47,528
- (phone ringing)
- All you got to do is go that way.

1393
00:58:47,663 --> 00:58:49,324
Pass it, though. Oh, my God.

1394
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,501
G-Go!
That's what they pay you for.

1395
00:58:52,636 --> 00:58:54,167
- Hello?
- DANNY: Hey, Castro.

1396
00:58:54,303 --> 00:58:55,669
Boss man, what's up, man?
Your flamingos just got here.

1397
00:58:55,804 --> 00:58:57,063
What you want me
to do with them?

1398
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:59,008
They came to the office?

1399
00:58:59,144 --> 00:59:00,539
No, they're supposed to be at
the Turks and Caicos property.

1400
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:01,874
She turns six tomorrow.

1401
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,671
I'm gonna get
in so much trouble, man.

1402
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,175
<i>We have the elephants.
We have the bouncy castle.</i>

1403
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,517
Tommy the Clown
is already there.

1404
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:08,915
We've gone over this
so many times.

1405
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:10,379
Danny, slow the...
First of all, slow down.

1406
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:11,850
- (groans) Castro...
- My blood pressure high.

1407
00:59:11,985 --> 00:59:13,518
Are you... you good? What's up?

1408
00:59:13,653 --> 00:59:14,823
What? I'm fine!

1409
00:59:20,492 --> 00:59:23,029
Yes, I need your sprayer,
blue paint, and you...

1410
00:59:23,164 --> 00:59:25,429
and meet me at that pin
that I just sent you.

1411
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:27,395
And I'm going to give you
$10,000 when you get there.

1412
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,201
- You hear me? Blue paint.
- Got you.

1413
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:30,934
But I'm watching the game
right now, and I got

1414
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:32,101
money on it, so what's going on?

1415
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,110
DANNY:
What, soccer? What? I...

1416
00:59:34,246 --> 00:59:35,536
It's football,

1417
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:37,110
and it's actually
the most sophisticated

1418
00:59:37,245 --> 00:59:38,449
and the biggest game
in the world, but continue.

1419
00:59:38,584 --> 00:59:40,243
I don't care about
your dumb sport

1420
00:59:40,379 --> 00:59:41,913
- or your dumb ball!
- Okay, I got you.

1421
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:43,616
Blue paint, sprayer, flamingos.

1422
00:59:43,751 --> 00:59:45,550
No! Not the flamingos!

1423
00:59:45,685 --> 00:59:47,053
Listen! No.

1424
00:59:47,188 --> 00:59:48,788
The blue paint comes
with the spray gun.

1425
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:51,053
Just leave the flamingos alone!

1426
00:59:51,189 --> 00:59:53,257
They are two separate events!

1427
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,591
(tires squealing)

1428
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:02,773
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

1429
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:04,739
I'm running low on fluids.
He could use some blood.

1430
01:00:04,874 --> 01:00:06,100
DANNY (sighs):
What's the problem now?

1431
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,434
I'm O negative, universal.

1432
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,807
Oh, my God.
You can donate blood.

1433
01:00:08,943 --> 01:00:10,138
Come here. Come here. Help me.

1434
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,746
I will run an IV to your arm,

1435
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:13,573
and I can just connect you
to him.

1436
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:15,752
- (indistinct radio chatter)
- (groans)

1437
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:18,485
It's almost rush hour.

1438
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:20,252
We got to wrap this up,

1439
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:22,121
or a lot of innocent people
are gonna be in danger.

1440
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,623
Bank surveillance was corrupted.

1441
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,624
They got into the computer.
Oh, they're good.

1442
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:32,092
DEPUTY (over phone):
FBI database facial rec

1443
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,433
has him as Danny Sharp.

1444
01:00:33,568 --> 01:00:35,464
Holy shit.

1445
01:00:36,475 --> 01:00:39,667
Tell LAPD we want in now.

1446
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,437
PILOT (over radio):
Air 64 confirmed off Flower

1447
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:44,112
to Figueroa, approaching
Convention Center Drive.

1448
01:00:44,248 --> 01:00:46,312
Dhazghig, give me a code 100.
Stagger the units ahead.

1449
01:00:46,448 --> 01:00:49,476
DHAZGHIG: Setting all lights
to green for eastbound Olympic.

1450
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,147
So far, RHD cyber found
a sat phone

1451
01:00:52,283 --> 01:00:54,456
and police scanners on board.

1452
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:56,293
So they're hearing us.

1453
01:00:56,428 --> 01:00:58,157
Well, we'll use that.

1454
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:00,124
MARK: Hey, what's up?
What's happening?

1455
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,294
OFFICER:
They're gonna try to trap 'em.

1456
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:04,030
MONROE: All right, our target's
near Staples Center.

1457
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,698
- Let's roll.
- (taps ceiling, whistles)

1458
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:07,460
JAY:
Let's roll!

1459
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:08,968
OFFICER:
Hey, that's my car.

1460
01:01:09,104 --> 01:01:11,104
(engines revving,
tires squealing)

1461
01:01:13,444 --> 01:01:14,545
Swap the cars out.

1462
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,977
Get our aggressive guys
up front.

1463
01:01:18,777 --> 01:01:20,984
Jesus.

1464
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,346
Careful.

1465
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:29,490
Send a unit
to the driver's-side door

1466
01:01:29,626 --> 01:01:30,557
and irritate him a bit.

1467
01:01:30,693 --> 01:01:32,192
They don't lay back,

1468
01:01:32,327 --> 01:01:34,027
we're gonna crash this whole
motherfucking thing!

1469
01:01:34,163 --> 01:01:36,563
Why do you keep
switching the cars around?

1470
01:01:36,698 --> 01:01:38,231
It unnerves them,

1471
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:39,567
makes them feel like
we're coming from everywhere.

1472
01:01:39,703 --> 01:01:41,366
Switch so he can hear me.

1473
01:01:41,501 --> 01:01:44,336
This is Captain Monroe,
LAPD Special Investigations.

1474
01:01:44,471 --> 01:01:46,505
Okay, well, you need
to tell them to lay back.

1475
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,905
DANNY: Big message for LAPD...
you pull your helos up and out,

1476
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,539
or I hurt people.

1477
01:01:54,046 --> 01:01:55,344
Who am I speaking with?

1478
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,015
I don't want to call you
Mr. Bank Robber.

1479
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,512
- Come on, buddy.
- (Cam grunts)

1480
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,381
There's a Dodgers game
tonight at 7:30.

1481
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:02,024
DANNY:
Ooh, I love Dodger Dogs.

1482
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:03,858
MONROE: I want to wrap this up
so we can both...

1483
01:02:03,993 --> 01:02:05,829
You get your helos
out of here now!

1484
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,228
You don't want me
hurting this cop.

1485
01:02:12,363 --> 01:02:14,530
Why don't you listen to me now?

1486
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,598
<i>You give me my officer
and one paramedic,</i>

1487
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,706
<i>not only will I get rid
of the choppers,</i>

1488
01:02:18,841 --> 01:02:20,441
I'll throw in a Dodger Dog.

1489
01:02:20,576 --> 01:02:22,036
What do you say?

1490
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:23,911
This asshole.

1491
01:02:24,046 --> 01:02:26,311
We're a locomotive.
We don't stop.

1492
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:28,776
Look, I'm not trying
to trick you.

1493
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,114
DANNY: I don't think
you're getting the message.

1494
01:02:30,249 --> 01:02:32,581
(echoing):
We don't stop!

1495
01:02:33,723 --> 01:02:35,254
Well, neither do we.

1496
01:02:37,919 --> 01:02:39,588
ROBERTO: Protecting
our investment, Danny.

1497
01:02:40,697 --> 01:02:42,096
Getting ready right now.

1498
01:02:42,232 --> 01:02:43,894
We're bringing one of our
special cartel builds.

1499
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,401
We'll be there, brother.

1500
01:02:45,537 --> 01:02:46,903
Three minutes! Let's go!

1501
01:02:48,374 --> 01:02:50,572
- Papi.
- Jesus.

1502
01:02:50,707 --> 01:02:52,770
Roberto's ready to go.

1503
01:02:52,906 --> 01:02:54,273
Get me a Topo.

1504
01:02:58,049 --> 01:03:01,379
I got this very nice gift
from the Zetas.

1505
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:04,580
Very charming.

1506
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:06,286
REPORTER: Seems like
the police are playing

1507
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:07,581
some sort of cat-and-mouse game
with these suspects...

1508
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,487
Let's go watch crazy Danny
on TV.

1509
01:03:09,622 --> 01:03:11,258
REPORTER 2: Chuck,
as you can see in the studio,

1510
01:03:11,393 --> 01:03:13,125
what's going on right now
is there are a lot of cops

1511
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:14,630
staggered around
a bunch of blocks

1512
01:03:14,766 --> 01:03:16,263
around the Convention Center.

1513
01:03:16,398 --> 01:03:18,098
REPORTER 3: We have
a-a massive police presence

1514
01:03:18,233 --> 01:03:19,762
forming around
the Convention Center.

1515
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:21,497
MONROE: <i>It's gonna be
a hard one to lock down.</i>

1516
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:23,434
<i>18, you on for 11?
You available?</i>

1517
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:24,807
PILOT: A hundred percent.
Yes. Come on.

1518
01:03:24,942 --> 01:03:26,443
MONROE:
We're gonna trap 'em here.

1519
01:03:26,578 --> 01:03:28,109
Lock this place down.

1520
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:29,810
PILOT: We have no visuals
around the corner.

1521
01:03:29,946 --> 01:03:31,611
(pilot continues indistinctly)

1522
01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:33,614
(sirens wailing)

1523
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:36,177
(tires squealing)

1524
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,688
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1525
01:03:37,823 --> 01:03:39,582
Oh, shit!
They're gonna box us in.

1526
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,432
Just keep it steady, Will.

1527
01:04:04,115 --> 01:04:06,444
Who the hell is this?
I can't shake this guy.

1528
01:04:10,854 --> 01:04:12,846
CAM:

01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:44,891
<i>They're gonna be dead
in three minutes.</i>

2028
01:22:46,596 --> 01:22:48,264
This might be our last chance.

2029
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,937
Blockade every exit. Push 'em.

2030
01:22:51,073 --> 01:22:52,603
The paramedic is still alive.

2031
01:22:52,738 --> 01:22:54,768
MONROE: <i>And I want
to keep her that way.</i>

2032
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:56,640
(over radio):
<i>Coming at us about 65,</i>

2033
01:22:56,775 --> 01:22:58,939
<i>70 miles an hour,
about a minute out.</i>

2034
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:01,942
- What are your odds?
- OFFICER: Well, it's not 100%.

2035
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,945
She's in the back, sir.
It'll have to be head shots.

2036
01:23:04,081 --> 01:23:06,486
Then we've got a ground team
that'll come in and sweep it up.

2037
01:23:06,622 --> 01:23:08,116
MONROE: Give me your odds.
What are the chances, Dyle?

2038
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:10,454
80, 90 percent.

2039
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:13,124
No more waiting.
Wait broke the wagon.

2040
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,856
D-Team, that's a green light.

2041
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:17,266
You got to negotiate her out.
This is a mistake.

2042
01:23:18,102 --> 01:23:20,631
MONROE:
<i>This is a mistake, Toledo?</i>

2043
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:22,929
- Not your buddy killing a cop?
- He's not my buddy.

2044
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:28,540
Why haven't they tried
to stop us?

2045
01:23:28,676 --> 01:23:30,043
DANNY: <i>'Cause our lucky
rookie cop is on board.</i>

2046
01:23:30,178 --> 01:23:31,973
Mobile unit is in position now.

2047
01:23:32,109 --> 01:23:34,179
- DANNY: <i>Hey, we got to turn around.</i>
- (horn honks)

2048
01:23:34,314 --> 01:23:36,118
<i>We got to get back Downtown.</i>

2049
01:23:38,117 --> 01:23:39,647
Zach's phone.

2050
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:41,147
Zach's ph...
Hey, give me the...

2051
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:43,015
the cop in the ambulance,
give me his phone number.

2052
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,992
DHAZGHIG:
<i>Snipers, 45 seconds.</i>

2053
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,208
(cell phone buzzing)

2054
01:24:07,382 --> 01:24:09,079
- (whispers): Hello?
- ANSON: Cam?

2055
01:24:09,215 --> 01:24:10,746
Don't talk. Just listen.

2056
01:24:10,882 --> 01:24:12,680
This is Agent Clark, FBI.
I need you to get down

2057
01:24:12,816 --> 01:24:14,816
under the stretcher,
and do it now.

2058
01:24:16,321 --> 01:24:17,517
Snipers, 20 seconds.

2059
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:19,722
I have eyes on the target.

2060
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:31,338
OFFICER: Two-nine, negative.
We're still on the freeway.

2061
01:24:32,874 --> 01:24:34,506
Light brown car.

2062
01:24:35,674 --> 01:24:36,870
The snipers are gonna
take them out.

2063
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,106
You need to stay
as low as possible.

2064
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:39,207
What?

2065
01:24:39,342 --> 01:24:40,710
We still green?

2066
01:24:40,845 --> 01:24:41,940
MONROE: We're still green.
Green for go.

2067
01:24:42,076 --> 01:24:42,844
Take-take the shot
if you got it.

2068
01:24:44,354 --> 01:24:46,121
- SNIPER: Target one, green.
- (whirring)

2069
01:24:46,257 --> 01:24:48,053
Kill shots.
Nothing gets in the back.

2070
01:24:48,188 --> 01:24:49,382
We've got friendlies.

2071
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:50,555
On my call.

2072
01:24:52,054 --> 01:24:55,021
SNIPER: Target two, red.
Target two not clear.

2073
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:58,757
Wh-What about Zach?
I can't protect him. Can you?

2074
01:24:58,892 --> 01:25:00,134
What are you talking about?

2075
01:25:00,269 --> 01:25:02,098
- He's alive?
- Yes, he's alive.

2076
01:25:02,233 --> 01:25:03,136
Hey, he's alive.

2077
01:25:03,271 --> 01:25:04,398
- Our cop's alive.
- God!

2078
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:06,302
- Three.
- No.

2079
01:25:06,438 --> 01:25:07,907
- ANSON: Cam?
- No.

2080
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:09,706
SNIPER:
Two.

2081
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:16,752
- Snipers! Snipers!
- WILL: What?

2082
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:18,915
Where? Black building!

2083
01:25:19,051 --> 01:25:20,253
One.

2084
01:25:20,389 --> 01:25:22,958
- Engage.
- (gunfire, bullets ricochet)

2085
01:25:23,094 --> 01:25:25,117
- Oh, shit!
- (tires squealing)

2086
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:37,300
- Go!
- (bullet whizzes)

2087
01:25:37,435 --> 01:25:38,634
Ten-David, stand down.

2088
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,273
- Stand down.
- Fuck! The billboard!

2089
01:25:40,409 --> 01:25:41,467
SNIPER:
<i>He knows what he's doing.</i>

2090
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:43,307
<i>Must be a vet.</i>

2091
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:45,143
I see what's happening now!

2092
01:25:45,278 --> 01:25:46,908
Oh, you want to play?

2093
01:25:48,082 --> 01:25:49,647
(tires squealing)

2094
01:25:54,586 --> 01:25:56,355
- (sighs)
- (sirens wailing)

2095
01:25:56,491 --> 01:25:57,953
MONROE:
Now we just pissed them off.

2096
01:25:58,088 --> 01:25:59,356
- So, where are they going?
- Anywhere he wants.

2097
01:25:59,492 --> 01:26:00,955
DHAZGHIG:
She warned them.

2098
01:26:10,264 --> 01:26:12,637
All units, fall back.
I repeat, fall back.

2099
01:26:12,773 --> 01:26:14,804
And give me an assessment.
Anybody get hurt?

2100
01:26:17,007 --> 01:26:19,178
All right. You want to play?
Let's go.

2101
01:26:19,313 --> 01:26:20,645
MONROE:
<i>I only want two</i>

2102
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,016
<i>undercover cars on them,
500 feet.</i>

2103
01:26:22,152 --> 01:26:23,313
<i>These are smart L.A. boys.</i>

2104
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:24,814
<i>Danny's studied FBI.</i>

2105
01:26:24,949 --> 01:26:26,482
<i>He's studied
LAPD pursuit tactics.</i>

2106
01:26:26,617 --> 01:26:28,214
<i>He knows it's all standard shit</i>

2107
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,824
But what he doesn't know,
super special agent,

2108
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,525
is I'm S.I.S.

2109
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:34,828
We set traps.
We let the bad guys come to us.

2110
01:26:34,963 --> 01:26:37,165
So you text Cam.

2111
01:26:37,301 --> 01:26:38,826
You make her an asset,
you hear me?

2112
01:26:38,962 --> 01:26:40,366
You find out
where they're going.

2113
01:26:40,502 --> 01:26:42,469
I'll set a trap
nobody gets out of.

2114
01:26:44,302 --> 01:26:45,498
Where's Monroe?

2115
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:47,203
We got contact.

2116
01:26:47,338 --> 01:26:48,739
I'm here.

2117
01:26:48,874 --> 01:26:51,169
You're supposed to save
the hostages, right?

2118
01:26:51,305 --> 01:26:53,342
You're supposed to
keep them alive, right?

2119
01:26:53,478 --> 01:26:54,840
Or did I get that wrong?

2120
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,580
I want everyone alive, Danny.

2121
01:26:56,716 --> 01:26:58,853
So why the fuck
are you shooting at us?

2122
01:26:58,988 --> 01:27:00,018
That was a breach.

2123
01:27:00,154 --> 01:27:01,682
DANNY:
A what?

2124
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:04,020
A mistake. Miscommunication.

2125
01:27:04,156 --> 01:27:07,352
Bullshit! You don't think
I'm gonna hurt anyone, do you?

2126
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:09,862
MONROE: That's not true.
I know what you're capable of.

2127
01:27:09,997 --> 01:27:12,895
Oh, yeah? Did Anson tell you
what my father would've done?

2128
01:27:14,203 --> 01:27:15,901
Why don't you tell me again?

2129
01:27:16,036 --> 01:27:18,274
He would've killed your cops
and the EMT back at the bank,

2130
01:27:18,409 --> 01:27:20,265
and then he would've had
a snack afterwards.

2131
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,210
MONROE: Just take it easy,
all right, Danny?

2132
01:27:22,346 --> 01:27:23,710
Everybody knows
how dangerous you are.

2133
01:27:23,846 --> 01:27:25,205
Do you?

2134
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,073
Hey, you need to keep it cool
back there, man.

2135
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,911
You don't got to prove
a thing to me.

2136
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:34,213
MONROE:
Danny? Did I lose you, buddy?

2137
01:27:35,253 --> 01:27:36,287
Take it.

2138
01:27:36,422 --> 01:27:38,223
- No.
- Take it.

2139
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:40,424
- Why?
- Go on, take it.

2140
01:27:40,559 --> 01:27:42,430
Come on. Just click it open

2141
01:27:42,565 --> 01:27:44,899
and make sure
they can hear everything.

2142
01:27:45,035 --> 01:27:47,259
Tell him what I'm doing.

2143
01:27:49,034 --> 01:27:52,398
He's standing up,
and he has a gun in his hand.

2144
01:27:52,534 --> 01:27:55,073
Danny...

2145
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:57,071
I saved you.

2146
01:27:57,206 --> 01:27:59,579
(over radio):
I saved both of you. Okay?

2147
01:27:59,714 --> 01:28:02,284
Why does everybody think
they are so special?

2148
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,415
I don't know
what's going on nowadays.

2149
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:05,811
You're just like the rest of us.

2150
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,449
You're just not important.

2151
01:28:07,584 --> 01:28:08,751
Yo, Danny, relax.

2152
01:28:08,887 --> 01:28:10,420
No, I'm not important,
but he is.

2153
01:28:10,556 --> 01:28:12,150
And I'm keeping him alive.

2154
01:28:12,286 --> 01:28:13,652
(over radio):
You need me, Danny.

2155
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:14,986
Careful, kid.

2156
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:16,757
No, we don't need you anymore.

2157
01:28:16,892 --> 01:28:18,759
WILL:
Danny, relax!

2158
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:20,864
You're full of shit, Danny.

2159
01:28:21,567 --> 01:28:22,797
- DANNY: Am I?
- (gasps)

2160
01:28:22,932 --> 01:28:24,764
- WILL: Danny!
- (Cam screaming)

2161
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,138
- CAM: Will!
- Danny!

2162
01:28:26,273 --> 01:28:28,740
(tires screeching)

2163
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:31,975
Will!

2164
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:33,310
- Are you crazy right now?
- What are you doing?

2165
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:34,783
What did she say? Will?

2166
01:28:34,918 --> 01:28:36,115
Was that a name?

2167
01:28:36,251 --> 01:28:37,512
What are you doing?

2168
01:28:37,648 --> 01:28:39,448
They need to know...

2169
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:42,285
(grunting and groaning)

2170
01:28:42,421 --> 01:28:43,986
Motherfucker!

2171
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:49,854
(horn honking)

2172
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:51,994
(horn continues honking)

2173
01:28:53,434 --> 01:28:55,300
ANSON:
William Sharp.

2174
01:28:55,435 --> 01:28:56,833
He's Danny's brother.

2175
01:28:56,968 --> 01:28:58,468
WILL:
You always got a fucking plan.

2176
01:28:58,604 --> 01:28:59,837
DANNY:
Stop the car!

2177
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:02,334
Who's fighting? Can we see?

2178
01:29:03,772 --> 01:29:05,308
You fucking stop!

2179
01:29:05,443 --> 01:29:07,013
(yells) God!

2180
01:29:07,148 --> 01:29:09,379
(grunts, pants)

2181
01:29:09,515 --> 01:29:11,783
That hurt! (grunts)

2182
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:15,182
Hey! All right, all right,
all right, all right,

2183
01:29:15,317 --> 01:29:16,822
all right, all right,
all right, all right...

2184
01:29:16,957 --> 01:29:17,816
- Do it again. Do it again!
- All right, all right...

2185
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:19,553
Easy, easy. Easy.

2186
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,053
(Danny panting)

2187
01:29:21,188 --> 01:29:22,693
- You're crazy.
- Say it! Say it!

2188
01:29:22,829 --> 01:29:25,324
- Look! I have a plan!
- Shut up!

2189
01:29:25,459 --> 01:29:26,660
DANNY: Papi's guys are
setting a diversion

2190
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:28,395
for us at Boyle Heights.

2191
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,665
She says they're going
to Boyle Heights intersection.

2192
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,666
Boyle Heights intersection.

2193
01:29:30,801 --> 01:29:32,232
He's gonna try to lose us there.

2194
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,409
- Shit, the FBI. Let go.
- (cell phone ringing)

2195
01:29:34,545 --> 01:29:36,910
ANSON: It's Anson, FBI.
Danny, you there?

2196
01:29:37,045 --> 01:29:38,679
Danny?

2197
01:29:38,815 --> 01:29:41,543
No, we just got a change
in the pitching rotation.

2198
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,078
ANSON:
Hi, Will.

2199
01:29:43,214 --> 01:29:45,747
You boys having a little
squabble in there, huh?

2200
01:29:45,882 --> 01:29:47,379
What's your plan here, man?

2201
01:29:47,514 --> 01:29:49,554
Guess you're in charge now,
little brother.

2202
01:29:49,689 --> 01:29:51,019
MONROE:
Bad guys can't hear me.

2203
01:29:51,155 --> 01:29:52,217
Our fixed-wing has
high-altitude eyes.

2204
01:29:52,352 --> 01:29:54,025
Make it look like
we disappeared.

2205
01:29:54,161 --> 01:29:56,093
PILOT: <i>Air 11 to every team.
We're pulling off.</i>

2206
01:29:56,229 --> 01:29:58,191
You know, it seems to me like
we're the only ones trying

2207
01:29:58,327 --> 01:29:59,764
to keep these people alive,
Special Agent.

2208
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,860
(chuckling):
Oh, yeah? How you figure?

2209
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:03,430
Just give us some space.

2210
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,930
I thought you were supposed
to be the smart one, no?

2211
01:30:05,065 --> 01:30:06,775
Yeah, apparently not.

2212
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:08,941
ANSON: I've seen your file.
I mean, you joined the Marines

2213
01:30:09,077 --> 01:30:11,036
so you wouldn't have to end up
like dipshit brother Danny

2214
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:12,380
or your psycho dad LT, right?

2215
01:30:12,516 --> 01:30:13,443
I mean, you're
a fucking war hero, man.

2216
01:30:13,579 --> 01:30:15,045
What are you doing?

2217
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,384
That was yesterday.
We're talking about today.

2218
01:30:16,519 --> 01:30:18,210
You take a hostage,
it's 30 years.

2219
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:19,552
ANSON:
Just shut the fuck up, Danny.

2220
01:30:19,688 --> 01:30:21,050
What are you,
his fucking lawyer?

2221
01:30:21,185 --> 01:30:22,315
DANNY: I'm giving him
great legal advice.

2222
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:23,424
ANSON: Will, listen to me.
You got a family.

2223
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,491
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

2224
01:30:24,627 --> 01:30:25,525
You gonna tell him
it's 30 years?

2225
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:26,992
You take a hostage,
it's 30 years?

2226
01:30:27,128 --> 01:30:27,721
- You gonna tell him, Anson?
- It's time to call it quits.

2227
01:30:27,857 --> 01:30:28,926
Just pull over, man.

2228
01:30:29,061 --> 01:30:30,391
Fucking reading you
out of the playbook.

2229
01:30:30,527 --> 01:30:31,732
- ANSON: Don't listen to him.
- DANNY: You take a hostage,

2230
01:30:31,867 --> 01:30:33,324
- it's 30 years.
- Danny, this is between Will and I.

2231
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,661
- Will, focus.
- (laughs) This guy.

2232
01:30:35,796 --> 01:30:37,005
ANSON: Your wife... you want me
to call your wife right now?

2233
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:38,399
Do not call my wife.

2234
01:30:38,534 --> 01:30:39,805
He's got your best interests,
my friend. That's it.

2235
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,399
There's only so much
I can do for you, Will.

2236
01:30:41,535 --> 01:30:42,776
- 30 years.
- ANSON: You've got a family.

2237
01:30:42,912 --> 01:30:44,239
- Ask him what happens when you shoot a cop.
- Shut up!

2238
01:30:44,374 --> 01:30:46,139
Tate will only see his daddy
behind plexiglass.

2239
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:47,640
ANSON:
What the fuck are you doing?

2240
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,143
The truth is he probably won't
even want to see you at all.

2241
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:50,944
Okay, everybody...
everybody just shut up!

2242
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,447
Everybody just shut up, okay?

2243
01:30:52,582 --> 01:30:54,749
ANSON: You're gonna dig your
own grave on this one, my man.

2244
01:30:54,884 --> 01:30:55,819
I can give you an out,

2245
01:30:55,955 --> 01:30:57,922
but I can only do that
right now.

2246
01:31:00,262 --> 01:31:01,758
We don't stop.

2247
01:31:01,893 --> 01:31:03,925
DANNY:
<i>That's my brother!</i>

2248
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:05,761
William Sharp is the weak link.

2249
01:31:05,896 --> 01:31:07,635
He is not gonna kill anyone.

2250
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:12,805
ANSON (over phone):
Cam, you need to work Will.

2251
01:31:16,647 --> 01:31:19,008
DHAZGHIG:
Rerouting to surface streets.

2252
01:31:19,144 --> 01:31:21,473
Don't lick your fingers
and touch my shit.

2253
01:31:23,786 --> 01:31:25,643
All units, Boyle Heights,
set perimeters.

2254
01:31:25,779 --> 01:31:27,488
Where is that? I don't usually
go east of Downtown.

2255
01:31:27,624 --> 01:31:29,355
You realize
four million Angelenos

2256
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:30,956
live east of Downtown?

2257
01:31:31,091 --> 01:31:33,127
Sorry. My husband is
an environmental attorney.

2258
01:31:33,263 --> 01:31:34,662
Okay? We like the beach.

2259
01:31:34,798 --> 01:31:36,188
That's, like, the whitest
thing I've ever heard.

2260
01:31:36,323 --> 01:31:37,864
Well, I'm white.
I can't help it.

2261
01:31:37,999 --> 01:31:40,096
Save it for Oprah, buddy.
We got shit going on.

2262
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:43,972
You get any of that freaking
Cheeto dust in my hair,

2263
01:31:44,107 --> 01:31:45,464
I swear...

2264
01:31:45,599 --> 01:31:47,741
Please. You could lose
a raccoon in there.

2265
01:31:48,777 --> 01:31:50,372
DANNY:
Easy on the blood bank, Cam.

2266
01:31:50,508 --> 01:31:52,971
- Will needs some of it, too.
- CAM: Okay. (clears throat)

2267
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:54,974
It's fine. Just take it.

2268
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:56,710
So you were a Marine?

2269
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,510
Until today.

2270
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,553
It's my wife.

2271
01:32:04,688 --> 01:32:05,852
Hey, babe.

2272
01:32:05,988 --> 01:32:07,521
Will, where are you?

2273
01:32:07,657 --> 01:32:09,026
(laughs)

2274
01:32:09,161 --> 01:32:11,897
Yeah, the interview
went long, and, uh...

2275
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:15,234
and they needed somebody
to start today, so...

2276
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:16,571
You got the job?

2277
01:32:16,707 --> 01:32:19,841
(laughs)
Yeah, I got... I got the job.

2278
01:32:19,977 --> 01:32:21,002
(gasps)

2279
01:32:21,137 --> 01:32:22,571
(singsongy):
He got the job.

2280
01:32:22,706 --> 01:32:24,068
He got the job.

2281
01:32:24,204 --> 01:32:25,675
Oh, we'll celebrate.

2282
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:27,174
Wait, are you driving now?

2283
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:29,377
WILL:
Yeah, there's a lot of traffic.

2284
01:32:29,512 --> 01:32:32,186
Yeah, some car chase
bank robbery thing on the news.

2285
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:33,754
Only in L.A., huh?

2286
01:32:33,889 --> 01:32:35,690
Yeah, you know,
they probably don't want me

2287
01:32:35,825 --> 01:32:38,688
to be on the phone
on my first day, so...

2288
01:32:38,824 --> 01:32:40,486
call you back, all right?

2289
01:32:41,493 --> 01:32:43,526
Will?

2290
01:32:43,661 --> 01:32:44,891
Yeah, baby?

2291
01:32:45,027 --> 01:32:46,833
I'm so proud of you.

2292
01:32:48,001 --> 01:32:50,034
Not just for taking care
of everything

2293
01:32:50,169 --> 01:32:52,535
with the insurance
and the money, but...

2294
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:54,368
for being a man.

2295
01:32:55,376 --> 01:32:57,008
Aw, babe.

2296
01:32:58,041 --> 01:33:00,506
One our son will look up to.

2297
01:33:02,352 --> 01:33:04,377
- Can I see him?
- Yeah.

2298
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:06,444
Hey, vampire princess,
are you done?

2299
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,281
Are you done sucking
the life out

2300
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:10,384
of every person
in this ambulance?!

2301
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:15,387
WILL:
Hey, what's up, big guy?

2302
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:18,194
Just waking up?
You're so beautiful.

2303
01:33:19,368 --> 01:33:21,263
So beautiful.

2304
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,200
AMY:
I love you.

2305
01:33:32,379 --> 01:33:34,139
Surgery?

2306
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,747
Yeah. Cancer's expensive.

2307
01:33:36,883 --> 01:33:38,414
You know what's gonna happen?

2308
01:33:38,549 --> 01:33:40,118
You're gonna get all his blood,
and then we're gonna die

2309
01:33:40,253 --> 01:33:41,981
in some perfectly preventable
traffic accident.

2310
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:43,481
Fan-fucking-tastic!

2311
01:33:43,617 --> 01:33:44,789
That's why you're
robbing the banks.

2312
01:33:44,924 --> 01:33:46,420
Yeah, that and everything else.

2313
01:33:46,555 --> 01:33:48,154
I'm not blaming nobody.
I'm here because of me.

2314
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,260
You're not blaming your brother?

2315
01:33:50,395 --> 01:33:51,931
I think you need to be
a little more careful, Cam.

2316
01:33:52,066 --> 01:33:53,932
That's my brother
you're talking about.

2317
01:33:54,068 --> 01:33:55,604
I know it's your brother
I'm talking about,

2318
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:57,603
but he's putting
people's lives at risk.

2319
01:33:57,739 --> 01:33:59,466
- Let me help you, Will.
- Stop.

2320
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:04,604
What you talking about?

2321
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:07,078
Nothing. It's okay.
I-I have everything I need.

2322
01:34:08,077 --> 01:34:09,817
(indistinct shouting)

2323
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,114
DANNY:
Castro? Castro?

2324
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,459
You tuck way under?

2325
01:34:17,594 --> 01:34:19,287
CASTRO:
Danny, listen. Um...

2326
01:34:19,423 --> 01:34:21,658
what the hell is going on
right now, man?

2327
01:34:21,794 --> 01:34:23,160
Is this shit legal?

2328
01:34:23,295 --> 01:34:24,966
You cannot be arrested
for possession of paint.

2329
01:34:25,102 --> 01:34:26,635
CASTRO: Yeah, I understand
that, but th-these guys are

2330
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:27,699
giving me
<i>Grand Theft Auto</i> vibes,

2331
01:34:27,835 --> 01:34:29,199
man, and it's throwing me off.

2332
01:34:29,334 --> 01:34:31,137
I don't know,
the explosives, th-the guns.

2333
01:34:31,273 --> 01:34:32,972
These guys look like they do
this type of shit all the time.

2334
01:34:33,108 --> 01:34:34,706
Man, I just...
I just really want to go home.

2335
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:36,139
I really want to go home, man.

2336
01:34:36,275 --> 01:34:37,535
DANNY: You're not going
anywhere, Castro.

2337
01:34:37,671 --> 01:34:38,678
- You stay right there.
- Is that Danny?

2338
01:34:38,813 --> 01:34:40,312
- Um, uh...
- Just say yes.

2339
01:34:40,447 --> 01:34:41,717
Yeah.

2340
01:34:41,852 --> 01:34:43,785
DANNY (enunciates):
Give him the phone.

2341
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:48,153
Hey, we're all set up.
You close?

2342
01:34:48,288 --> 01:34:50,490
- Yeah. Five minutes.
- All right, good. The money?

2343
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,156
I'm a man of my word.

2344
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:53,860
Good. Papi's gonna be glad
to hear that.

What's going on in there?

2347
01:34:59,498 --> 01:35:01,159
DANNY: Whew! I got to
chill out. I got to chill out.

2348
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:02,667
I got to chill out.

2349
01:35:02,802 --> 01:35:05,498
Hit me up. Hit me up.
