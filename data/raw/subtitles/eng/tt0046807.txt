1
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:30,384
Once in the Highlands

2
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:34,409
The Highlands of Scotland

3
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:40,177
Deep in the night
on a murky brae

4
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:44,231
There in the Highlands

5
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:48,527
The Highlands of Scotland

6
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:52,586
Two weary hunters

7
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:55,886
Lost their way

8
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:58,855
And this is what happened

9
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,344
The strange thing
that happened

10
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:06,639
To two weary hunters

11
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:12,400
Who lost their way

12
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:29,092
Brigadoon

13
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:33,478
Brigadoon

14
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,869
Blooming under

15
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:42,181
Sable skies

16
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:46,254
Brigadoon

17
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:50,794
Brigadoon

18
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:52,937
There my heart

19
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:57,515
Forever

20
00:02:57,585 --> 00:03:00,399
Lies

21
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:05,382
Let the world grow cold

22
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:09,002
Around us

23
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:13,296
Let the heavens

24
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:18,860
Cry above

25
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:23,760
Brigadoon

26
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:29,008
Brigadoon

27
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:33,808
ln my valley

28
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:37,801
There'll be

29
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:41,648
Love

30
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,095
Come all to the square

31
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:27,943
Come all to the square

32
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:29,991
The market square

33
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,880
The market square

34
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:37,032
Salted meat
l'm sellin' there

35
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:38,992
'' At the square, laddie''

36
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:46,887
Come ye to the fair

37
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,862
Ale for sale
or barter there

38
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:51,430
'' At the square, laddie''

39
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:53,359
Ale for sale
or barter there

40
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:55,563
'' At the square, laddie''

41
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:01,230
Come all ye down

42
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:03,151
Ye in the town

43
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:06,412
Come ye from the hills

44
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:10,092
'' Woolen cloth l'm sellin' there
at the square, laddie''

45
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,292
Come ye from the mills

46
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,921
Come all ye there

47
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:16,934
Come all ye there

48
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:20,237
Come ye to the fair

49
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:23,403
'' Come ye, all ye''

50
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:27,085
Everywhere to the fair

51
00:05:27,153 --> 00:05:30,448
Come ye from the hills

52
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:33,741
Come ye from the mills

53
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:37,070
Come ye in the glen

54
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,630
Come ye bairn

55
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,362
Come ye men

56
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:43,848
Come ye from the loom

57
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,052
Come from pail and broom

58
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:50,350
Hear ye everywhere

59
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,285
Don't ye ken
There's a fair

60
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:59,949
Down on MacConnachy Square

61
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:02,438
l'm sellin' a bit
of milk and cream

62
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:04,367
Come sip it and ye will vow

63
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,342
That this is
the finest milk and cream

64
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,304
That ever came out a cow

65
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,343
Though fine as it is
the price is small

66
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,325
With milk an' the cream alack

67
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,270
There's nothin' to do
but sell it all

68
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:17,232
The cow will not take it back

69
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,008
Come all ye there

70
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:24,239
Come all ye there

71
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:26,792
Come ye to the fair

72
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:29,286
Now all of ye come
to Sandy here

73
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:31,084
Come over to Sandy's booth

74
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:33,007
l'm sellin'
the sweetest candy here

75
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:34,960
That ever shook loose a tooth

76
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:36,911
l eat it myself
and there's no doubt

77
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,864
'Tis creamy and good and thick

78
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:41,514
'' So, laddies, l hope
you'll buy me out''

79
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:43,756
'Tis makin' me kind o' sick

80
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,988
Come ye to the fair

81
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:50,187
Come ye to the fair

82
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:53,420
Come ye in the glen

83
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:55,049
Come ye bairn

84
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,647
Come ye men

85
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,917
Come ye from the loom

86
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:03,148
Come from pail and broom

87
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:06,380
Hear ye everywhere

88
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:09,863
Don't ye ken
There's a fair

89
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:14,671
Down on MacConnachy Square

90
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:23,334
Let me see that map again.

91
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,521
Let's see.
Here's Auchindale.

92
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:31,342
''As l remember, that should be
on the left, and l don't remember.''

93
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,001
lt is.

94
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,698
Here's Braekirk.

95
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,262
Should be on the right.

96
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:38,725
-Then where the devil are we?
-What's in the middle?

97
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,687
-Nothing.
-That's where we are.

98
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,640
-Nothing?
-Yep.

99
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:44,559
For a fellow
of my potentialities...

100
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:46,599
this is an ideal location.

101
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:49,519
We'll find our way out
when the mist clears.

102
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:52,040
Must be depressing to be a bird...

103
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:53,967
and know the hunting season is on.

104
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:55,887
''The way you aim, the birds
have nothing to worry about.''

105
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,895
Yeah? Watch.

106
00:07:57,968 --> 00:07:59,856
Wait a second.
That isn't a grouse.

107
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:04,009
Fine couple of game hunters we are.

108
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,561
''We come here from New York,
and the first night out, we get lost.''

109
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:10,000
Maybe we took the high road
instead of the low road.

110
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:11,657
''-Like a drink?
-No, thanks.''

111
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:13,582
Good. That leaves more for me.

112
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:15,590
You told me
you were gonna cut down.

113
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:18,479
''Yes, l did,
but l'm a terrible liar.''

114
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:20,487
''Besides, it doesn't pay.''

115
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:24,104
l remember l was going
with a wonderful girl once...

116
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:26,543
and she used to plead with me
to give it up.

117
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:28,015
''So, one day l did.''

118
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,048
''We discovered we had nothing more
to talk about, so we broke up.''

119
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,842
There's something about this forest...

120
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:39,498
that gives me the feeling
of being in a cathedral.

121
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:42,218
''lf we were, l'd know
where the exit is.''

122
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,103
''-You don't believe in anything, do you?
-Of course l do.''

123
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:46,379
Really? What?

124
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:48,335
Practically anything
l can understand.

125
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,156
Anything that's real to me.

126
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:55,276
''Things l can touch, taste,
hear, see, smell and swallow.''

127
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,319
What about the things
you don't understand?

128
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:59,215
l dismiss 'em.

129
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,135
''Makes it very easy, doesn't it?''

130
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,404
''Comfortable, anyhow.''

131
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:05,359
-l envy you.
-Why?

132
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:06,831
You seem so satisfied.

133
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:08,457
l am. Aren't you?

134
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:11,183
''No, l'm not.''

135
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:13,419
That's the silliest thing
l ever heard.

136
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:16,335
You've got a fine job
and you're engaged to a fine girl.

137
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:19,248
You're lost in a fine forest.
What more do you want?

138
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:23,109
l don't know.
Something seems wrong.

139
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:25,224
Especially about Jane and me.

140
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,816
That makes everything seem wrong.

141
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:31,849
Look how l postponed getting married.
l can't get myself to that altar.

142
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,302
Don't you love her?
You did when we left New York.

143
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:39,567
Sometimes l think l'm really
not capable of loving.

144
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:43,340
Sometimes l think nobody is anymore.

145
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,685
That's nonsense.

146
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:48,068
Don't start talking yourself
into an inferiority complex.

147
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:50,151
-You don't deserve it.
-What do you mean?

148
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:53,934
Most of my friends who have
an inferiority complex are right.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,909
They're not as good
as everybody else.

150
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:59,148
''But you--
young, dashing, loaded.''

151
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:11,367
Hey. Look at that.

152
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,440
-lt looks like a village.
-lt is.

153
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:17,065
l thought you said there were
no towns on the map around here.

154
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:20,005
''-l did. You wanna see the map?
-No, l believe you.''

155
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,284
Let's go down.
There must be people down there.

156
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:24,686
They must eat food.
That's what we're interested in.

157
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,560
Funny it isn't on the map.

158
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:30,533
Maybe they don't like publicity.

159
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:48,905
Jean. Jean!

160
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:51,791
-Come away from the window.
-l'm tryin' to see Charlie.

161
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:54,474
''l know you are,
and you're not supposed to.''

162
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:57,610
'Tis bad luck to see the groom
before the weddin'.

163
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,403
Put the clothes in the chest.

164
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,611
Do you think he's glad
he's marryin' me...

165
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,102
or do you think he's
beginnin' to regret it?

166
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:06,696
''Well, if l see him...''

167
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:07,978
l'll ask him.

168
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:10,382
''Now, hurry up.''

169
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:14,885
''Father, how did ye feel
when Mother agreed to marry ye?''

170
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,935
l didn't propose to her.
She proposed to me.

171
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,382
Didn't it make you happy?

172
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:21,415
''Aye, her good judgment
pleased me highly.''

173
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:24,074
''Fiona, you'll be sure
to see Charlie and tell him...''

174
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:25,999
to come over to sign
the family Bible.

175
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:28,617
''-Aye, Father.
-l'm off to see Mr. Lundie.''

176
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,062
Attend to the marketing.

177
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,616
Buy everything that's needed
for the weddin' supper.

178
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:35,950
''-Aye.
-But remember, just what's needed.''

179
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:39,311
My aim for this occasion
is to be hospitable...

180
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:40,685
not philanthropic.

181
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:47,014
When you gonna think
about marriage for yourself?

182
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:49,543
When l find someone
who makes me think of it.

183
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:52,365
You've never met anyone up 'til now
that made you think of it?

184
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:54,439
''No, not as yet.''

185
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:56,846
Doesn't that worry you?

186
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:58,189
''Aye, a little...''

187
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:01,769
but l'm not gonna let it worry me
into marryin' the wrong one.

188
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Many a lassie
as everyone knows'll

189
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:10,287
Try to be married before 25

190
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:14,127
So she'll agree
to most any proposal

191
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:19,211
All he must be
is a man and alive

192
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,069
l hold a dream
and there's no compromisin'

193
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:29,840
l know there's one
certain laddie for me

194
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:35,600
One day he'll come
walkin' o'er the horizon

195
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:38,031
But should he not

196
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,551
Then an old maid l'll be

197
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,245
Foolish ye may say

198
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:53,007
Foolish l will stay

199
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:01,199
Waitin' for my dearie

200
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:05,355
And happy am l

201
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:09,483
To hold my heart
'til he comes

202
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:14,156
Strollin' by

203
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:17,934
'' When he comes, my dearie''

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,156
One look and l'll know

205
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:24,395
That he's the dearie

206
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:29,199
l've been wantin' so

207
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:32,013
Though l'll live 40 lives

208
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,218
'Til the day he arrives

209
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:38,379
'' l'll not ever, ever grieve''

210
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:40,749
For my hope will be high

211
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:44,590
That he'll come strollin' by

212
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,794
For you see

213
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:51,781
l believe

214
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:53,514
That

215
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:57,643
There's a laddie weary

216
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:01,541
And wanderin' free

217
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:03,656
Who's waitin'

218
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:07,656
For his dearie

219
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:11,045
Me

220
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:06,159
What do you do
while you're waitin' around

221
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:09,836
For your lad to come your way

222
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:12,489
'' Well, when no one is lookin'''

223
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,310
You kneel on the ground

224
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:17,896
And you pray and pray

225
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,520
And pray

226
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:23,658
But when lassies sit
and have no men

227
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:25,866
'' Oh, how long becomes the night''

228
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:32,165
But l fear the night
is longer when

229
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,858
The lad's not right

230
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:42,219
Waitin' for my dearie

231
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:46,062
ls sweeter to me

232
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:49,924
Than wooin' any laddie

233
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,302
On the lea

234
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:57,828
Dreamin' of your dearie

235
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:01,515
And idlin' the day

236
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,853
That's how l am

237
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,157
And how l'll always stay

238
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:13,094
Though l'll live 40 lives
'til the day he arrives

239
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:17,096
'' l'll not ever, ever grieve''

240
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:19,143
For my hopes will be high

241
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:22,281
That he'll come strollin' by

242
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:26,378
For you see

243
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:31,947
l believe

244
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:34,154
That

245
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:39,919
There's a laddie weary

246
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,895
And wanderin' free

247
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,156
Who's waitin'

248
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:55,494
For his dearie

249
00:16:56,592 --> 00:17:02,288
Me

250
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:19,238
''Good mornin', Fiona!''

251
00:17:19,312 --> 00:17:20,653
Thanks.

252
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,011
''-Good mornin', Miss Fiona.
-Good mornin', Mr. Beaton.''

253
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,935
-Good day.
-What would you be lookin' for?

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,942
A waistcoat for my father
for the weddin'.

255
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:32,239
''Of course. Jean and young Dalrymple
are gettin' married today, aren't they?''

256
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:35,533
''lf she had to choose someone
other than my son, Harry...''

257
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,934
l'm glad 'twas a lad
as fine as Charlie.

258
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:41,870
Would you have a waistcoat
of this that would fit him?

259
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,231
l think so. l'll have Harry
run over to the house and see.

260
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:47,685
''Friends, your attention, please!''

261
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:56,746
This is the second day
of our blessing...

262
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,245
and so to remind ye...

263
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,102
Mr. Lundie has drawn up
a map of our town...

264
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,102
and asked me to hang it
in the public square here...

265
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:06,314
where ye all can see it
and be reminded.

266
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:11,789
''Now, the boundaries
of our village are:''

267
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:15,630
''To the east, the bridge.
To the west, the old kirk road.''

268
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:18,892
''To the north, the stone fence
at the edge of the forest...''

269
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:21,447
''and to the south, Loch Harold.''

270
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,894
Let no one cross...

271
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:26,255
or we shall be ungrateful
before God...

272
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,167
and night shall
fall upon us forever.

273
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:40,174
The second day of whose blessin'?
'Tis for certain not mine.

274
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,606
-l'm truly sorry.
-Do not be.

275
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:45,290
''lf anyone's goin' to pity me,
let it be me.''

276
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,524
'Tis not fair for Charlie Dalrymple
to be weddin' her.

277
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:51,723
He's got everything--
school in Edinburgh and now Jean--

278
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:53,548
and l've got nothing.

279
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:57,259
Nothing but to be trapped
in this peasant village all my life.

280
00:18:57,328 --> 00:18:59,597
Look at it.
The boundaries of a town?

281
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:02,663
Not to me.

282
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:05,932
'Tis more the dimensions
of my jail.

283
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,369
''Hey, sonny, could you tell us
where we could get some breakfast?''

284
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,091
That kid's gonna have problems
when he grows up.

285
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:48,324
Pardon me. Could you tell us
where we could find a local inn?

286
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:54,383
What is this?

287
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,822
ls there a place around here
where we could get some breakfast?

288
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:03,149
''-l do not know, sir.
-What do you know? lt talks.''

289
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:05,070
What's the name of this town?

290
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:08,461
l do not know.
You'll have to excuse me.

291
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:12,719
You're in Brigadoon.

292
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:21,998
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

293
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:25,380
You must forgive him. l imagine
he was a wee bit taken back.

294
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:27,365
People do not come here
very often.

295
00:20:28,496 --> 00:20:30,634
What did you say
the name of this town is?

296
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:31,947
Brigadoon.

297
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:34,830
That's funny.
lt isn't on the map.

298
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:36,390
l should not be surprised.

299
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:38,318
You know it isn't on the map?

300
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:39,594
Aye.

301
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:41,736
''That's a little snobbish of you,
don't you think?''

302
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:46,276
-Why isn't it on the map?
-For good reason.

303
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,509
''Well, look, Miss, uh--''

304
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:52,910
-Campbell.
-Thank you.

305
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:57,231
We're trying to get some breakfast.
ls there an inn around here?

306
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:59,151
An inn?
l do not think so.

307
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,801
''But if you follow the road,
you'll come to MacConnachy Square.''

308
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:03,944
You can find all the food you want
for sale there.

309
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,795
Thank you very much.

310
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,292
You're more than welcome.

311
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,109
Good day.

312
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:12,428
Good day.

313
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,614
Good day.

314
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:17,931
Good day.

315
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,210
Good day.

316
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:49,899
Look!

317
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:55,142
Funny clothes
they wear around here.

318
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:58,062
Maybe this is the day
they take pictures for postcards.

319
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:22,826
Hello.

320
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:27,019
lt couldn't be me. There must be
something peculiar about you.

321
00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:34,889
''This milk is for sale,
isn't it?''

322
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,869
-Aye.
-Do you mind if l help myself?

323
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:40,456
''One moment, sir.
l'll have to see your money first.''

324
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,382
-My money?
-Show 'im the money.

325
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:51,495
-Look at the date!
-Funny-lookin' thing.

326
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,607
What did you give 'em?
A hunk of uranium?

327
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,810
''No, just a shilling.
What a loony layout this is.''

328
00:22:57,775 --> 00:23:00,142
''Aye, 'tis very interesting, sir...''

329
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:01,931
but it does me no good.

330
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,007
You mean you won't sell me anything?

331
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,981
''l'm sorry, sir. l cannot.''

332
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:08,265
Why not?

333
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:10,223
''l cannot explain further, sir.''

334
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:14,158
They just happened in
a wee while ago.

335
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,373
''Well, welcome to Brigadoon.
How did you gentlemen get here?''

336
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,090
''We came from Graymore,
six miles yonder.''

337
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,200
Six miles.
That's quite a distance.

338
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:27,501
''You must be hungry. Angus, how about
some breakfast for our visitors?''

339
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:29,705
''Charlie, their money--''

340
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,499
l do not want their money.

341
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:34,284
''This is my weddin' day, laddie.
You're my invited guests.''

342
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:38,126
''Help yourselves.
Bread, scones, ginger cakes.''

343
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:41,038
''Oh, but first,
a bit o' heather ale.''

344
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:43,622
Sandy!

345
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:46,469
-Here l am.
-Some ale for our guests.

346
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:49,444
Ale for everybody!

347
00:23:54,992 --> 00:23:57,228
So you're getting married today.
That's wonderful.

348
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:58,888
''Aye, it is.''

349
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,348
''This afternoon,
to Miss Jean Campbell.''

350
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,278
-Campbell?
-Aye.

351
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:08,581
l think l met your bride
a few minutes ago. She's very charming.

352
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,022
''Aye, that she is.''

353
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,974
Her health.
Her health!

354
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,375
-To our visitors!
-Here!

355
00:24:18,447 --> 00:24:20,138
And to Mr. Forsythe.

356
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,346
l hope he knows
how grateful l am to him...

357
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:24,106
to postponin' the miracle for me.

358
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:26,826
''-That what?
-'Tis a toast we have here, sir.''

359
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:30,157
And may God bless me this evenin'
as much as l would bless him...

360
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:33,671
if l were he
and he were Charles Dalrymple.

361
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:37,610
l guess we'll not be seein' you
at the tavern anymore.

362
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,032
''Aye, lads.
My tavern days are over.''

363
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,450
l used to be a rovin' lad

364
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,868
A rovin' and wanderin' life
l had

365
00:24:48,943 --> 00:24:51,147
On any lass l'd frown

366
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:55,143
Who would try to tie me down

367
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:59,527
But then one day
l saw a maid

368
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,942
Who held out her hand
and l stayed and stayed

369
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:07,082
And now across the green

370
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:12,618
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

371
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:14,411
'' Go home, go home''

372
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,389
Go home with bonnie Jean

373
00:25:16,463 --> 00:25:17,924
'' Go home, go home''

374
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:21,960
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

375
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,745
ln Aberdeen l used to know

376
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:52,263
A lass with an air
an' her name was Jo

377
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:54,702
And every night at 10:00

378
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:59,404
l would meet her
in the glen

379
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:02,438
But now you'll not
see her again

380
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:05,894
Especially not
in the glen at 10:00

381
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:08,268
For now across the green

382
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:10,190
You'll--

383
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,639
Go home with bonnie Jean

384
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:15,467
'' Go home, go home''

385
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,258
Go home with bonnie Jean

386
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,953
'' Go home, go home''

387
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:23,016
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

388
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:48,841
Hello to married men l've known

389
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:52,294
l'll soon have a wife
and leave yours alone

390
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:54,734
A bonnie wife indeed

391
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,720
And she's all l'll ever need

392
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,474
You wanted her at any cost

393
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:05,772
But how do you know
if you've won or lost

394
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,206
And still across the green

395
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:12,232
You'll go home with bonnie Jean

396
00:27:12,303 --> 00:27:14,158
'' Go home, go home''

397
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:15,979
Go home with bonnie Jean

398
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:17,607
'' Go home, go home''

399
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,159
You'll

400
00:27:21,231 --> 00:27:23,119
Go home with bonnie Jean

401
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,076
''-Oh, you can't stop now!
-Go on!''

402
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:07,785
'' Go home, go home''

403
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:09,579
Go home with bonnie Jean

404
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,076
'' Go home, go home''

405
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:13,190
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

406
00:29:13,263 --> 00:29:14,954
'' Go home, go home''

407
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:16,714
Go home with bonnie Jean

408
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:18,376
'' Go home, go home''

409
00:29:18,447 --> 00:29:20,422
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

410
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,185
'' Go home, go home''

411
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:24,011
Go home with bonnie Jean

412
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,705
'' Go home, go home''

413
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:29,736
l'll go home

414
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:33,669
With bonnie

415
00:29:33,743 --> 00:29:35,597
'' - Jean
- Go home, go home''

416
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:38,892
'' Go home, go home
go home, go home''

417
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:41,774
'' Go home with bonnie Jean, aye''

418
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:57,676
Meg Brockie just told me
at the back window...

419
00:29:57,743 --> 00:29:59,783
there are two strangers in town.

420
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:02,221
-Aye.
-Ya mean ya know it?

421
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:04,905
Why didn't ya tell me?
Did ya see them?

422
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:07,146
-Aye.
-Tell me about them.

423
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:09,070
What are they like?
How do they look?

424
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:12,234
''He has brownish hair,
a wee bit taller than father.''

425
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:14,921
-Very nice face.
-What about the other one?

426
00:30:14,991 --> 00:30:17,642
''The other? He's about
the same, l imagine.''

427
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:20,394
l really cannot remember.
l only saw them for a moment.

428
00:30:20,463 --> 00:30:22,318
Where are they?
Where did they go?

429
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:25,580
To the square for some food.
They've probably left by now.

430
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,348
Maybe they haven't.
l'm goin' to see.

431
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:35,332
l'll pick up the bread for ya.

432
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:39,108
Jean! Are you daft?

433
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:41,419
How can you even think
of goin' out today?

434
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,428
Supposin' you run into Charlie.

435
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:46,569
Do you want to start out your marriage
under a cloud of bad luck?

436
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:48,647
''-l'll get the bread.
-Oh, but, Fiona--''

437
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:51,752
Who ever heard of a bride bein' seen
on the day of her weddin'?

438
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:54,157
l'm surprised at you
for even thinkin' of it.

439
00:31:14,126 --> 00:31:15,501
Lovely.

440
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:28,747
''Oh, you're a winnin' lad.
A right winnin' lad!''

441
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:30,702
''You've noticed that, have you?''

442
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:33,029
Do you have a wife?

443
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,285
l never touch the stuff.
l don't believe in marriage.

444
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,693
l've seen too many happy love affairs
broken up by it.

445
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,825
''Oh, you're a braw and handsome lad,
Mr. Douglas.''

446
00:31:42,895 --> 00:31:45,545
You should see me when l'm rested.
l'm almost robust.

447
00:31:50,927 --> 00:31:53,196
We do not have enough lads
in Brigadoon.

448
00:31:53,263 --> 00:31:55,718
''Enough for everybody else,
or enough for you?''

449
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,962
There are so few single lads
in town.

450
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:00,071
lt's hard for a lass
to catch a husband.

451
00:32:00,143 --> 00:32:03,438
lt would be so nice if ya
could stay a while. Could ya?

452
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:05,357
l'll have to ask my pop.

453
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:13,127
We came over here to hunt grouse.

454
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,053
And coming from this hill--

455
00:32:16,463 --> 00:32:18,372
''-Oh.
-Good mornin', dearie.''

456
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:20,301
Father asked me
to remind ya...

457
00:32:20,366 --> 00:32:22,668
to be sure and come sign
the family Bible this afternoon.

458
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,262
l'll be over.

459
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:27,150
''-How was breakfast, sir?
-Wonderful. Thanks.''

460
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,730
Where's my bride?

461
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,009
She's home...

462
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,217
palpitatin'.

463
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:36,836
lsn't that your bride?

464
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:39,725
''No, lad.
That's her older sister, Fiona.''

465
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,685
-Do you mind if l have more ale?
-Help yourself.

466
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:58,407
''Here, old tank.
Amuse yourself.''

467
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,333
l thought we were going hunting.

468
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,675
l am.

469
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,477
See you at the weddin'.

470
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,101
Can l carry that for you?

471
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,556
''No, thank you.
l do not have far to go with it.''

472
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:13,540
''You're very busy today,
aren't you?''

473
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:16,135
''-Aye, my sister--
-They told me she's getting married.''

474
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,817
-l was overjoyed.
-That's very kind of ya.

475
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:23,563
''Not at all. ln this case,
her happiness is mine.''

476
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,932
''Besides, Charlie's a nice kid.''

477
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,236
''Aye, he is that.''

478
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:30,921
lt's wonderfully refreshing
these days...

479
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:33,958
to see someone so enthusiastic
about getting married.

480
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:36,300
-ls it so unusual?
-l think so.

481
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:38,854
l was thinking of facing
the minister once...

482
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:41,545
and l certainly wasn't
bubbling over like Charlie.

483
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:43,108
Oh?

484
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:44,295
''Oh, what?''

485
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,057
l'm very surprised.

486
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:49,901
You do not look like the sort of lad
who'd be thinkin' of settlin' down.

487
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:53,829
l didn't say that. l just said
l was thinking of getting married.

488
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:55,844
''Well, if ya felt that way...''

489
00:33:55,918 --> 00:33:57,806
'tis a very good thing ya didn't.

490
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:03,881
''Yes, l suppose it was
a very good thing l didn't.''

491
00:34:06,926 --> 00:34:09,708
''-Good mornin', Fiona.
-Good day, Mrs. Maclntosh.''

492
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:12,491
-This is--
-Albright. Tommy Albright.

493
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:16,588
-Likewise.
-He's just passin' through.

494
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,043
Where do ya come from?

495
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:21,453
From America.

496
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,559
You're an American?

497
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,453
lsn't that all right?

498
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,177
''Aye, of course.''

499
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:30,148
''-The bread, Mrs. Maclntosh.
-Aye.''

500
00:34:30,222 --> 00:34:33,256
Andrew! Come to the window
and look at the stranger!

501
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:34,853
He's an American.

502
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:36,966
She gives us bread
for our potatoes.

503
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,178
-That's nice.
-She's a very nice lady.

504
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,457
'Tis just that--

505
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:43,112
People don't come here
very often.

506
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,703
Aye. You're very understandin'.

507
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:47,847
''No, l'm not.''

508
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,050
l don't understand one thing
about this place.

509
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:55,820
The bread will be ready in an hour.
l'll bring it to your cottage.

510
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,991
''-Thank you, Mrs. Maclntosh.
-Good day.''

511
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,339
Good day.

512
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:08,909
l've been wanting
to do that all day.

513
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:12,393
Now where?

514
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:15,724
l must gather some heather
for the weddin' decorations.

515
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,384
Where do you do that?

516
00:35:17,455 --> 00:35:19,910
''On the far hill,
where the heather is.''

517
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:23,981
Do you mind if l come along?

518
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:35,468
-Why did ya want to?
-Why?

519
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,924
''Oh, l don't know exactly.''

520
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:40,868
Maybe it's because
l've nothing much else to do.

521
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:44,139
Or maybe it's because l'm so
full of wonder about this place...

522
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:46,061
and want to stay a little longer.

523
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:50,022
Or maybe it's because
l remember how relieved l was...

524
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:53,161
when l found out it was
your sister's wedding day and not yours.

525
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:02,535
Can't we two
go walkin' together

526
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:07,396
Out beyond
the valley of trees

527
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:12,457
Out where there's
a hillside of heather

528
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:18,059
Curtsyin' gently
in the breeze

529
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:22,534
That's what l'd like to do

530
00:36:22,606 --> 00:36:25,541
See the heather

531
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:30,252
But with you

532
00:36:33,295 --> 00:36:38,794
The mist of May
is in the gloamin'

533
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:42,953
And all the clouds
are holdin' still

534
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:48,364
So take my hand
and let's go roamin'

535
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:53,798
Through the heather
on the hill

536
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:59,976
The mornin' dew
is blinkin' yonder

537
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:04,781
There's lazy music
in the rill

538
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:08,775
And all l wanna do is wander

539
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:13,898
Through the heather
on the hill

540
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:19,018
There may be other days
as rich and rare

541
00:37:19,086 --> 00:37:24,072
There may be other springs
as full and fair

542
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,793
But they won't be the same

543
00:37:26,862 --> 00:37:30,659
They'll come and go

544
00:37:30,735 --> 00:37:32,622
For this

545
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:37,739
l know

546
00:37:38,894 --> 00:37:42,669
That when the mist
is in the gloamin'

547
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:49,283
And all the clouds
are holdin' still

548
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,760
lf you're not there
l won't go roamin'

549
00:37:54,831 --> 00:38:00,526
Through the heather
on the hill

550
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:05,612
The heather

551
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:11,374
On the hill

552
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:53,383
''-Here's your waistcoat, Mr. Campbell.
-Thank you, Harry.''

553
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:55,341
'Tis good to see ya.

554
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:58,373
''-Wait a minute, lad.
-What for?''

555
00:41:58,446 --> 00:42:01,097
Why don't ya take my hand?
l'm not your enemy.

556
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:04,908
''Ye may not mean to be, but ye are,
and so is everybody in this town.''

557
00:42:04,974 --> 00:42:07,178
Why do ya hate everybody?

558
00:42:07,246 --> 00:42:11,021
l couldn't get through seein' her
marry someone else if l didn't.

559
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:14,730
What else can ya do when ya realize
your life means less than nothin'?

560
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,351
l cannot leave here.

561
00:42:17,422 --> 00:42:20,292
l cannot go to the university
and make something o' myself...

562
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:23,083
and l cannot have Jean.

563
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,379
So there's nothin' left to do
but to hate everything and everybody...

564
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:28,835
in this cursed town.

565
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,528
''You'll never find peace
by hatin', lad.''

566
00:42:31,598 --> 00:42:34,348
lt only shuts ya off more
from the world...

567
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:37,447
and this is only a cursed town
if ya make it so.

568
00:42:37,518 --> 00:42:40,300
''To the rest of us,
'tis a blessed place.''

569
00:42:56,046 --> 00:42:57,322
Who was that?

570
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,074
My waistcoat came.
You should be gettin' ready.

571
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:01,865
l was waitin' for Fiona.

572
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,356
Where is she?
She's been gone for hours.

573
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:09,486
Go to your room.
Close the door.

574
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,405
''Charlie, go 'round to the window.''

575
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,560
Here's the Bible.

576
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,157
There's the quill and ink.

577
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:24,078
Now sit ye down there and sign
right under the name...

578
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:26,214
of my dear departed wife.

579
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:28,675
''And when you've done that,
take your leave!''

580
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,994
''Aye, sir.''

581
00:43:57,006 --> 00:44:00,006
This is where l come all day
and tend my flock.

582
00:44:00,078 --> 00:44:02,893
''When l say it sounds fascinating,
l want you to believe me.''

583
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:09,478
-lt's a very picturesque view.
-Thank ya.

584
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,201
-What for?
-For likin' where l've brought ya.

585
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,245
lt makes me very happy.

586
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,707
''-You get happy very easily, don't you?
-Aye.''

587
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:22,630
l haven't been in a shed like this
since l was in college...

588
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,549
''which at this point seems
a good 2,000 years ago.''

589
00:44:25,614 --> 00:44:28,549
''-Ya mean you're tired?
-Aye, lassie, l'm tired.''

590
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:31,437
''That's what you brought me here for,
wasn't it, so l could take a nap?''

591
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,950
l should not think a long walk
would fatigue a young lad like ye.

592
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:37,443
''-A young lad?
-Aye, you're very young.''

593
00:44:37,518 --> 00:44:40,169
That's either a deliberate lie
or wishful thinking.

594
00:44:40,238 --> 00:44:43,467
''l am ancient, decrepit
and disintegrating rapidly.''

595
00:44:43,534 --> 00:44:45,836
My mother and father
met in this shed.

596
00:44:45,902 --> 00:44:47,527
We all make mistakes.

597
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:49,224
My mother was a gypsy...

598
00:44:49,294 --> 00:44:51,181
and one day she was
walkin' past this shed...

599
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:53,831
and she saw my father
lyin' down asleep.

600
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:57,285
''She liked his looks,
and she was achin' for a husband.''

601
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:01,187
''So, she took off her shoes,
sat in the rocking chair there...''

602
00:45:01,262 --> 00:45:03,401
and waited for him to wake up.

603
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,055
And it was not long after that
that l was born.

604
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:09,061
That's one of the sweetest
bedtime stories l've ever heard.

605
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:13,253
''What's under here, your father?''

606
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:18,701
Thank you very much.
You've been more than kind.

607
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:21,766
''Now, if you want to round out
your generosity, buzz off.''

608
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:23,813
l just hate to leave ya.

609
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:27,628
''You better. When l sleep,
l make all sorts of odd noises.''

610
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:30,061
Who told ya?
Ya do not have a wife.

611
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:31,555
l was engaged once.

612
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,215
You're a right winnin' lad.

613
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:36,140
You should have someone
to take care of ya.

614
00:45:36,205 --> 00:45:39,501
l don't know what you're after.
l just wanna go to sleep.

615
00:45:39,566 --> 00:45:40,776
Now go!

616
00:45:42,925 --> 00:45:44,136
Go?

617
00:45:45,102 --> 00:45:49,030
But do ya not see?
l'm highly attracted to ya.

618
00:45:49,102 --> 00:45:53,063
''Why, when l look at ya, l feel
wee tadpoles jumpin' in my spine.''

619
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:56,482
That's about as repulsive an idea
as l've heard in years.

620
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:59,558
''lf love were a hobby,
you'd be a collector's item.''

621
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,572
All you men are all alike.

622
00:46:01,646 --> 00:46:04,101
-l should certainly hope so.
-You're all brutes!

623
00:46:04,174 --> 00:46:06,825
Ya get what ya want from a lass
an' then 'tis farewell!

624
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:09,228
Get what l want?
l can't even get you to go away!

625
00:46:09,294 --> 00:46:10,985
That's what l'm referrin' to.

626
00:46:11,054 --> 00:46:14,349
l thought ya wanted to propose to me.
That's why ya brought me here.

627
00:46:15,662 --> 00:46:17,320
You misled me.

628
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,423
You sure have one lulu
of an imagination.

629
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:23,429
''Can you think of one good reason
why l, a strange man...''

630
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:26,316
''should be interested in proposing
to you, a mighty strange woman...''

631
00:46:26,381 --> 00:46:27,942
and at this hour of the day?

632
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:30,763
''Because you're a lad,
and l'm a lass.''

633
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,829
''With that philosophy, you must have
had a provocative career.''

634
00:46:33,902 --> 00:46:36,652
Now go. Be off.
Away with ya.

635
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:39,533
-But--
-Go tend your flock.

636
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:38,602
''Fiona! There's some white heather,
lots of it.''

637
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:39,880
''Tommy, stop!''

638
00:47:42,254 --> 00:47:44,971
There isn't any
white heather over there.

639
00:47:45,038 --> 00:47:46,948
Of course there is.
There's plenty--

640
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,252
What is it?
What frightened you?

641
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:52,227
'Tis nothin'.

642
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,651
ls it the bridge? Why do you have
such a look of fear on your face?

643
00:47:55,726 --> 00:47:56,970
l cannot say.

644
00:47:57,998 --> 00:47:59,852
Why can't you?

645
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:03,846
''Fiona, what's the matter?
What's going on around here?''

646
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,436
What was all that business
about Charlie and a miracle?

647
00:48:43,374 --> 00:48:46,821
''Hey, look out! Tommy!''

648
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:48,901
What happened? Tommy!

649
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:50,500
Are you all right?

650
00:48:57,742 --> 00:49:01,833
''lf there's anything l hate,
it's you.''

651
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:04,454
Any civilized person
would be dead by now.

652
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:09,548
Maybe the sun
gave me the power

653
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:14,349
For l could swim Loch Lomond
and be home in half an hour

654
00:49:14,414 --> 00:49:18,375
Maybe the air
gave me the drive

655
00:49:18,446 --> 00:49:20,617
For l'm all aglow

656
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:26,054
And alive

657
00:49:26,126 --> 00:49:29,988
What a day this has been

658
00:49:30,062 --> 00:49:32,712
What a rare mood l'm in

659
00:49:32,781 --> 00:49:36,676
Why it's almost
like bein' in love

660
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,650
There's a smile on my face

661
00:49:40,718 --> 00:49:43,270
For the whole human race

662
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:48,644
'' Why, it's almost
like bein' in love''

663
00:49:48,718 --> 00:49:53,803
All the music of life
seems to be

664
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:58,791
Like a bell that is ringin'
for me

665
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,861
And from the way
that l feel

666
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:04,803
When that bell
starts to peal

667
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,595
l could swear l was fallin'

668
00:50:07,662 --> 00:50:10,826
l would swear l was fallin'

669
00:50:10,894 --> 00:50:14,374
lt's almost like bein'

670
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:17,064
ln love

671
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:22,730
When we walked up the brae

672
00:50:22,797 --> 00:50:26,791
Not a word did we say

673
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:28,138
lt was

674
00:50:36,014 --> 00:50:38,632
And her arm linked in mine

675
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,150
Made the world kind of fine

676
00:50:42,222 --> 00:50:43,596
lt was

677
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:38,019
'' Why, it's''

678
00:51:38,093 --> 00:51:42,501
Almost like bein' in love

679
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:57,420
'' Why, it's almost like bein'
in love''

680
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:36,492
Life seems to be

681
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:41,540
Like a bell
that keeps ringin'

682
00:52:41,614 --> 00:52:44,331
For me

683
00:52:44,398 --> 00:52:48,937
And from the way that l feel

684
00:52:49,006 --> 00:52:52,868
When that bell starts to peal

685
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:56,804
l would swear l was fallin'

686
00:52:56,878 --> 00:53:01,253
l could swear l was fallin'

687
00:53:01,326 --> 00:53:06,060
lt's almost like bein'

688
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:11,821
ln love

689
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:29,542
-Aren't we headin' back?
-There's no hurry.

690
00:53:29,614 --> 00:53:32,002
Let's stick around a while.
There's gonna be a wedding.

691
00:53:32,077 --> 00:53:34,663
''-Yours?
-Oh, very funny.''

692
00:53:38,893 --> 00:53:41,741
l thought we came to Scotland
to go grouse shooting.

693
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:44,970
l'd like to get one little bird
before the day is over.

694
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:47,820
-What's the matter?
-Hey.

695
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:51,300
l must be a little touched.
Listen to this.

696
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:53,707
''''''Married: Elizabeth Lang
to Andrew Campbell...''

697
00:53:53,774 --> 00:53:57,035
''''''July 2nd, 1719.''''''

698
00:53:57,102 --> 00:53:59,589
What about it?
People used to get married then.

699
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:03,273
''No, wait a minute.
''''Children: Fiona.''

700
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:07,051
''''''Born October 10th, 1732.''

701
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:11,340
''''''Jean. Born April 8th, 1736.''''''

702
00:54:11,406 --> 00:54:12,966
Well?

703
00:54:13,038 --> 00:54:17,129
Fiona told me Jean's four years younger.

704
00:54:17,197 --> 00:54:19,652
-Well?
-They're the sisters in this Bible!

705
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:23,587
That's ridiculous.
They're probably just named after them.

706
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:27,142
''-You know Charlie's last name, right?
-Dalrymple, isn't it?''

707
00:54:27,213 --> 00:54:29,123
''Dalrymple, yes.
Get this.''

708
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:31,565
''''''Married: Jean Campbell to
Charles Chisholm Dalrymple...''

709
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:35,427
''''''May 24th, 1754.''''''

710
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:39,243
Now what do you say?

711
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,165
Congratulations.

712
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:45,960
l don't understand.

713
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:48,299
No Brigadoon on the map.

714
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:52,998
All those odd things that happened when
l was out with Fiona this afternoon...

715
00:54:53,069 --> 00:54:56,681
all that stuff about a miracle...

716
00:54:56,749 --> 00:54:58,604
and now this.

717
00:55:08,046 --> 00:55:10,118
Why are you getting so worked up?

718
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:15,369
''lf it makes 'em happy to disregard
200 years of human bing-bang, let 'em.''

719
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:18,820
''There must be a logical explanation
for this, logical enough even for you.''

720
00:55:18,893 --> 00:55:21,927
You don't have to explain
anything to me. l don't care.

721
00:55:26,061 --> 00:55:28,483
What's the matter?

722
00:55:28,557 --> 00:55:31,624
ls that your name
in this Bible?

723
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:32,642
Aye.

724
00:55:32,718 --> 00:55:35,336
Someone seems to have
messed up your book.

725
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:39,690
What does it mean?
You must tell me.

726
00:55:39,757 --> 00:55:42,212
''There is an explanation for it,
isn't there?''

727
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:45,319
''Aye, there is,
but l cannot tell ya.''

728
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,456
ls there anybody who can?
l've got to know.

729
00:55:48,526 --> 00:55:50,947
-You must talk with the dominie.
-Who?

730
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:52,876
''Our schoolmaster, Mr. Lundie.''

731
00:55:52,941 --> 00:55:55,494
''-Where does he live?
-Down the road in a tree, maybe.''

732
00:55:55,565 --> 00:56:00,267
''He does not live in a tree, Mr. Douglas.
Mr. Lundie's a great man.''

733
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:03,148
''All right, Tommy,
l'll take you to him.''

734
00:56:07,726 --> 00:56:09,897
l hadn't wanted to...

735
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:14,472
because it'll be so hard
for you to believe what you'll hear.

736
00:56:15,565 --> 00:56:17,158
And l wanted--

737
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:21,229
l wanted you to stay with me...

738
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:23,398
'til the end of our day.

739
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:34,091
Take us to see Mr. Lundie.

740
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,870
Aye.

741
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:40,519
''ls it informal,
or should l wear my Napoleon hat?''

742
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,240
''Good day, Mr. Lundie.''

743
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:22,473
''Why, hello, Fiona.
What a pleasant surprise.''

744
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:25,476
''Mr. Lundie, l'd like you
to meet Mr. Tommy Albright...''

745
00:57:25,549 --> 00:57:27,883
and Mr. Jeff Douglas.

746
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,891
''-Good afternoon, gentlemen.
-How do you do, sir?''

747
00:57:29,965 --> 00:57:32,387
Good afternoon.

748
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:34,501
Where do you gentlemen come from?

749
00:57:34,573 --> 00:57:36,483
-We're from New York.
-New York?

750
00:57:36,558 --> 00:57:38,859
We changed it from New Amsterdam.

751
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:41,828
-So l understand.
-The British changed it.

752
00:57:41,901 --> 00:57:44,552
''Confidentially, though, as soon as
Washington organizes himself...''

753
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:46,890
''we're gonna chase them out,
but keep it under your hat.''

754
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:48,812
''Put a cork in it,
will you, Jeff?''

755
00:57:48,877 --> 00:57:51,244
''Mr. Lundie, l was wonderin'
if you'd be good enough...''

756
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:53,611
to tell these gentlemen
about Brigadoon.

757
00:57:53,677 --> 00:57:55,914
They've heard and
they've seen a great deal...

758
00:57:55,981 --> 00:57:57,988
and they're very perplexed indeed.

759
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:01,290
-Perplexed is right.
-l would very much like him--

760
00:58:01,357 --> 00:58:05,034
l mean them--to know.

761
00:58:05,102 --> 00:58:07,403
l see.

762
00:58:07,469 --> 00:58:11,114
''-Will you not be seated, gentlemen?
-Thank you.''

763
00:58:11,181 --> 00:58:14,443
''From what l gather, nobody can talk
about the place around here but you.''

764
00:58:14,509 --> 00:58:17,291
''-ls that right?
-No, that's wrong.''

765
00:58:17,357 --> 00:58:19,462
Mr. Forsythe could've told ya.

766
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:23,210
''Forsythe? l've heard about him,
but l didn't meet him.''

767
00:58:23,277 --> 00:58:26,376
Likely not.
l think he's dead.

768
00:58:26,445 --> 00:58:28,933
''That would stand in the way,
l suppose.''

769
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,779
''Let me warn you that what l'm goin'
to tell ya, ya will not believe.''

770
00:58:32,845 --> 00:58:36,674
That's all right.
We've already been warned.

771
00:58:36,749 --> 00:58:38,342
Why won't we believe it?

772
00:58:38,413 --> 00:58:42,057
Because what happened
in Brigadoon was a miracle...

773
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,907
and most folks
do not believe in miracles.

774
00:58:44,973 --> 00:58:49,315
''Miracles require faith,
and faith seems to be as dead as--''

775
00:58:49,389 --> 00:58:51,658
Mr. Forsythe?

776
00:58:51,725 --> 00:58:52,870
Aye.

777
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:56,487
Now this miracle happened--
Let me see.

778
00:58:56,557 --> 00:58:58,597
-What day is it?
-Friday.

779
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:04,037
Friday. That means it happened
exactly 200 years ago.

780
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:08,419
Two hundred years ago the Highlands
of Scotland were plagued with witches--

781
00:59:08,493 --> 00:59:11,111
wicked sorcerers who were
takin' the Scottish people...

782
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:15,688
away from the teachings of God
and puttin' the devil into their souls.

783
00:59:15,757 --> 00:59:19,783
''They were indeed
horrible, destructive women.''

784
00:59:19,853 --> 00:59:23,169
-l do not suppose you have such women.
-Witches?

785
00:59:23,245 --> 00:59:25,863
''Oh, we have 'em.
We pronounce it differently.''

786
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:28,999
lt did not matter that
they were not real sorcerers...

787
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:31,338
because you and l know
there's no such thing...

788
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:35,049
but their influence
was very real indeed.

789
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:38,280
Now we had at that time
in Brigadoon...

790
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:40,738
an old minister of the kirk...

791
00:59:40,813 --> 00:59:42,700
named Mr. Forsythe...

792
00:59:42,765 --> 00:59:45,733
and a good man he was.

793
00:59:45,805 --> 00:59:49,252
-The kindest man in Scotland.
-l believe he was.

794
00:59:49,325 --> 00:59:53,319
No man loved his parish
as did Mr. Forsythe...

795
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,902
''but he was gettin' old,
and it grieved him that one day soon...''

796
00:59:56,973 --> 00:59:59,558
he'd have to leave
those he loved so well.

797
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,150
But most of all
he worried about the witches.

798
01:00:02,221 --> 01:00:05,036
''Now mind you, they hadn't
visited us as yet in Brigadoon...''

799
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:09,095
but he knew that there was
a band of them coming our way.

800
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:13,287
So he began to wonder whether
there was not something he could do...

801
01:00:13,357 --> 01:00:17,252
''to protect the folk of his parish,
not only against them...''

802
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:19,944
but against all the evils
that might come to Brigadoon...

803
01:00:20,013 --> 01:00:22,915
from the outside world
after he died.

804
01:00:22,989 --> 01:00:26,056
Then one day he came to me
and told me...

805
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:30,085
that he had decided
to ask God for a miracle.

806
01:00:30,157 --> 01:00:34,762
''And on an early Wednesday mornin',
right after midnight...''

807
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:38,309
he went out to a hill
beyond Brigadoon...

808
01:00:38,381 --> 01:00:41,643
and made his prayer to God.

809
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:45,571
''And there, in the hush
of the sleeping world...''

810
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:48,744
he asked God that night
to make Brigadoon...

811
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:51,431
and all the people in it...

812
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:55,298
vanish into the highland mist.

813
01:00:55,373 --> 01:00:57,795
Vanish...

814
01:00:57,869 --> 01:00:59,811
but not for always.

815
01:00:59,885 --> 01:01:02,951
They would return
just as they were for one day...

816
01:01:03,021 --> 01:01:05,322
every hundred years.

817
01:01:05,389 --> 01:01:08,007
The people would lead
their customary lives...

818
01:01:08,077 --> 01:01:10,794
but every day when they awoke...

819
01:01:10,861 --> 01:01:13,861
it would be a hundred years later.

820
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:17,544
And when we awoke next day...

821
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:21,409
it was a hundred years later.

822
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:25,830
''ln this way,
Mr. Forsythe figured that...''

823
01:01:25,901 --> 01:01:28,039
there'd be no change
in the lives of the people.

824
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:32,779
They just wouldn't be in any century
long enough to be touched by it.

825
01:01:32,845 --> 01:01:34,536
You mean that--

826
01:01:34,605 --> 01:01:36,710
You mean that you
go to bed at night...

827
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:40,097
''and when you wake up the next day,
it's a hundred years later?''

828
01:01:40,173 --> 01:01:41,383
Aye.

829
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:44,900
And every day
is a hundred years later?

830
01:01:44,973 --> 01:01:46,085
Aye.

831
01:01:46,157 --> 01:01:48,132
What happened to the minister?

832
01:01:49,325 --> 01:01:51,180
We ne'er saw him again.

833
01:01:51,245 --> 01:01:54,311
''You see, he realized
to ask for such a miracle...''

834
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:58,375
''some sacrifice would have to be made,
and he wanted to be the one to make it.''

835
01:01:58,445 --> 01:02:03,300
''Well, what was the greatest
sacrifice that he could offer?''

836
01:02:03,373 --> 01:02:06,886
lt was to be separated from
those he loved before his time.

837
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:11,081
And that was why he went out
to a hill beyond Brigadoon...

838
01:02:11,149 --> 01:02:14,116
''where, his miracle granted...''

839
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,807
he'd ne'er see Brigadoon again.

840
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:20,968
All this happened
200 years ago?

841
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,313
''Aye, lad.''

842
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:25,415
''Which of course to us, you see,
is only two days ago.''

843
01:02:25,485 --> 01:02:27,754
Let me ask you something.

844
01:02:29,293 --> 01:02:33,068
Suppose somebody around here
got fed up and wanted to leave?

845
01:02:33,133 --> 01:02:35,021
''-Then what?
-Well, he cannot leave.''

846
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:39,143
''-You mean, l've gotta stay here now?
-No, lad.''

847
01:02:39,212 --> 01:02:41,579
But according to Mr. Forsythe's
contract with God...

848
01:02:41,645 --> 01:02:44,906
if anyone belonging
to Brigadoon leaves...

849
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:47,394
the enchantment
will be broken for all.

850
01:02:48,621 --> 01:02:51,882
''And that night,
when all the people go to sleep...''

851
01:02:51,949 --> 01:02:55,244
Brigadoon will disappear forever.

852
01:02:57,997 --> 01:03:01,707
''Look, l'm not saying
l believe all this...''

853
01:03:01,773 --> 01:03:04,140
butjust for argument's sake...

854
01:03:04,205 --> 01:03:06,409
suppose a stranger like--

855
01:03:06,477 --> 01:03:08,746
''well, like me--''

856
01:03:08,813 --> 01:03:11,879
came to Brigadoon
and wanted to stay.

857
01:03:11,949 --> 01:03:13,324
Could he?

858
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:19,331
''Aye, he could.
Mr. Forsythe provided for that.''

859
01:03:19,405 --> 01:03:21,347
''He didn't miss a trick, did he?''

860
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:23,526
''No, lad, he did not.''

861
01:03:23,597 --> 01:03:26,663
A stranger can stay
if he loves someone here.

862
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:30,377
''Not Brigadoon itself, mind you,
but someone in Brigadoon...''

863
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:33,444
enough to be willing
to give up everything...

864
01:03:33,517 --> 01:03:36,267
to stay near that person.

865
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:39,399
''Which is only right,
because after all, lad...''

866
01:03:39,469 --> 01:03:43,560
if you love someone
deeply enough...

867
01:03:43,629 --> 01:03:46,280
anything is possible.

868
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:49,797
Aye. Anything is possible.

869
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:52,935
''Oh, Fiona, shouldn't you be thinkin'
of changin' for the weddin'?''

870
01:03:53,005 --> 01:03:54,860
l had.

871
01:03:58,349 --> 01:04:01,447
''Tommy, will l see ya later?''

872
01:04:02,477 --> 01:04:04,332
l'll be there.

873
01:04:05,293 --> 01:04:07,180
l'd like to stick around...

874
01:04:07,245 --> 01:04:10,540
and see if this place evaporates
like you say.

875
01:04:10,605 --> 01:04:12,296
l must hurry now.

876
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:13,859
''Good-bye, Mr. Lundie...''

877
01:04:15,405 --> 01:04:17,260
and thank you.

878
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:25,065
She's a dear lassie.

879
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,996
''Yes, l'm finding that out.''

880
01:04:29,069 --> 01:04:33,259
''Mr. Lundie, are you all perfectly happy
living here in this little town?''

881
01:04:33,325 --> 01:04:35,714
''Why, of course, lad.''

882
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:39,651
''After all, sunshine can peep
through a wee hole.''

883
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:44,264
But what's it like at night
when you go to sleep?

884
01:04:46,477 --> 01:04:50,089
For me it's like being
carried on shadowy arms...

885
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:52,328
up to a distant cloud...

886
01:04:52,397 --> 01:04:56,259
and there l float 'til mornin'.

887
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,860
And yet...

888
01:04:57,933 --> 01:05:01,991
sometimes l think
l hear strange voices.

889
01:05:02,061 --> 01:05:04,003
-Voices?
-Aye.

890
01:05:04,076 --> 01:05:07,655
They say no words
that l can remember...

891
01:05:07,725 --> 01:05:09,579
and yet...

892
01:05:09,645 --> 01:05:13,441
they're voices filled
with a fearful longin'.

893
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:18,635
And often they seem
to call me back.

894
01:05:20,237 --> 01:05:23,620
l've pondered over it
when l was awake...

895
01:05:23,693 --> 01:05:26,148
and l think...

896
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:30,498
l have a feelin'
l'm hearin' the outside world.

897
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:36,453
''Oh, there must be
an awful lot of folk out there...''

898
01:05:36,525 --> 01:05:39,558
searchin'...

899
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:41,604
for a Brigadoon.

900
01:06:52,013 --> 01:06:53,987
Buchanan!

901
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:34,443
Douglas!

902
01:07:41,485 --> 01:07:43,492
Lindsey!

903
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,995
There's goin' to be a weddin'.

904
01:09:14,253 --> 01:09:17,766
We have no minister
in Brigadoon now.

905
01:09:17,836 --> 01:09:21,579
''ln most villages,
this would be a calamitous thing...''

906
01:09:21,645 --> 01:09:23,849
but when there is
no minister present...

907
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:27,594
''it is perfectly proper,
according to the laws of Scotland...''

908
01:09:27,661 --> 01:09:32,200
for two people to wed each other
by sincere mutual consent.

909
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,439
There need be nothin' in writin'.

910
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:36,418
All that is necessary...

911
01:09:36,493 --> 01:09:39,307
is that ye promise
to love each other...

912
01:09:39,373 --> 01:09:42,439
while ye both are on Earth.

913
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:44,614
''Go ahead, lad.''

914
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:59,425
l shall love ya 'til l die...

915
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,755
and l'll make all effort
to be a good husband to ya.

916
01:10:03,821 --> 01:10:06,820
And so much will l try...

917
01:10:06,892 --> 01:10:09,707
to be a fine and lovin' wife.

918
01:10:12,877 --> 01:10:16,489
''-Are we married now, Mr. Lundie?
-Aye, lad, you're married.''

919
01:10:18,637 --> 01:10:20,841
''Go on, kiss her, lad.''

920
01:10:30,572 --> 01:10:34,282
''Mr. Forsythe would have liked
to have been here, l know...''

921
01:10:34,349 --> 01:10:37,665
but as long as you're both
good and true to one another...

922
01:10:37,741 --> 01:10:40,708
ya cannot fail
but live in the grace of God...

923
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:44,129
and Mr. Forsythe could've
wished no more than that.

924
01:14:59,404 --> 01:15:02,633
All l've done
was to want ya too much.

925
01:15:25,997 --> 01:15:27,906
l'm leavin' Brigadoon!

926
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:31,079
'Tis the end of all of us!
The miracle is over!

927
01:15:32,844 --> 01:15:36,227
''We must stop 'im! Cover the woods!
Sandy and Angus, guard the bridge!''

928
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:38,788
''Robert, take a group
and spread out along the old kirk!''

929
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:42,243
''Fiona, is it true?
Could he make Brigadoon disappear?''

930
01:15:42,317 --> 01:15:45,131
''Aye, if he gets away.''

931
01:16:04,332 --> 01:16:07,114
Harry Beaton!

932
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,569
Harry Beaton!

933
01:16:09,644 --> 01:16:12,132
Harry Beaton

934
01:16:12,204 --> 01:16:14,059
Harry Beaton

935
01:16:25,036 --> 01:16:27,305
Run and get him
Get him

936
01:16:27,372 --> 01:16:30,023
Run and get him
Get him

937
01:16:30,092 --> 01:16:35,111
Run ye men or ye will
never see another mornin'

938
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,668
Go and stop him
Stop him

939
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,261
Go and stop him
Stop him

940
01:16:40,332 --> 01:16:45,634
Run ye Highland men
or ye won't get another day

941
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:48,425
Harry Beaton!

942
01:16:53,388 --> 01:16:55,690
Harry Beaton!

943
01:16:57,068 --> 01:16:59,402
Beaton sure came this way

944
01:16:59,468 --> 01:17:01,989
'' And we cannot be
too far behind him, laddie''

945
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,515
'' Ye there, head for the brae''

946
01:17:04,588 --> 01:17:07,076
'' Keep your eye open
or ye will not find him, laddie''

947
01:17:07,148 --> 01:17:09,636
l'll go down to the creek

948
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,229
'' And by God, if l see him
l'll throw him in it''

949
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,821
Search the hill to the peak

950
01:17:14,892 --> 01:17:19,943
'' Find him, lads
or tomorrow will never, never come''

951
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:22,434
Run and get him
Get him

952
01:17:22,508 --> 01:17:24,363
Run and get him
Get him

953
01:17:24,428 --> 01:17:27,211
Run and get him now

954
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:30,178
Or ye won't plow another meadow

955
01:17:30,252 --> 01:17:32,903
Go and stop him
Stop him

956
01:17:32,972 --> 01:17:35,208
Go and stop him
Stop him

957
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:37,480
Run ye Highland men

958
01:17:37,548 --> 01:17:41,028
Or ye won't get another day

959
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,304
Harry Beaton!

960
01:17:51,436 --> 01:17:53,291
Harry Beaton!

961
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,894
lf he comes into sight

962
01:18:09,964 --> 01:18:12,419
Hold him fast
Many lives are depending on it

963
01:18:12,492 --> 01:18:14,947
This must not end tonight

964
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:20,137
They must know that tomorrow
is really going to come

965
01:18:20,204 --> 01:18:22,659
Run and get him
Get him

966
01:18:22,732 --> 01:18:25,220
Run and get him
Get him

967
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:27,496
Spread your human net

968
01:18:27,564 --> 01:18:30,281
But don't forget
that time's against ya

969
01:18:30,348 --> 01:18:32,868
Go and stop him
Stop him

970
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,428
Go and stop him
Stop him

971
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,922
Run ye Highland men

972
01:18:37,996 --> 01:18:42,252
Or ye won't get another day

973
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:39,014
-How did it happen?
-He must've hit his head on a rock.

974
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:41,320
''Ah, the poor lad!''

975
01:19:50,316 --> 01:19:53,545
''Oh, Harry, my son, my son.''

976
01:19:53,612 --> 01:19:56,678
How could ya be so ungrateful?

977
01:19:56,748 --> 01:19:59,366
''Oh, l'm so ashamed for ye.''

978
01:19:59,436 --> 01:20:01,924
l'm so ashamed for ye.

979
01:20:01,996 --> 01:20:06,120
''Look here, all of ya. There's been
enough sorrow for one weddin' night.''

980
01:20:06,188 --> 01:20:09,570
Don't tell anyone he's dead.
Just say he was stopped.

981
01:20:09,644 --> 01:20:12,033
They can find out in the mornin'.

982
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:22,889
l'll take him to my cottage.

983
01:20:22,956 --> 01:20:25,028
No one will see him.

984
01:20:54,796 --> 01:20:57,316
''-Father, what happened?
-lt's all right. The alarm is over.''

985
01:20:57,388 --> 01:21:00,006
''-Was he hurt bad?
-No, just scratched a wee bit.''

986
01:21:00,076 --> 01:21:01,931
He'll be fine and fit
in the mornin'.

987
01:21:01,996 --> 01:21:04,680
Now let's all come back
to the weddin' supper.

988
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,649
''-Aren't ya comin', Fiona?
-Aye, Father.''

989
01:21:15,243 --> 01:21:17,098
''Angus, did ya see
Tommy, the American?''

990
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:20,546
''Aye, dearie.
l saw him cross the bridge.''

991
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,595
''Angus, did he come back?''

992
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:24,740
l did not see him.

993
01:22:13,132 --> 01:22:16,132
They stopped him just in time.
He wasn't far from the brook.

994
01:22:16,204 --> 01:22:18,855
''Yes, they told me.''

995
01:22:18,924 --> 01:22:22,371
''Oh, Fiona, when l think
what could have happened--''

996
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:26,466
''Your whole world, gone forever.''

997
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:30,369
l thought my world was gone.
l thought you'd left.

998
01:22:31,724 --> 01:22:34,571
Without saying good-bye to you?

999
01:22:34,636 --> 01:22:36,807
You know l wouldn't do that.

1000
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:38,731
l know ya wouldn't have.

1001
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,275
''Tommy, darlin'.''

1002
01:24:48,619 --> 01:24:51,074
l can't leave you.

1003
01:24:51,147 --> 01:24:52,576
l can't.

1004
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:57,162
Lundie said you could stay
if you love someone enough...

1005
01:24:57,228 --> 01:24:58,788
and l do.

1006
01:25:00,043 --> 01:25:01,985
l love you.

1007
01:25:02,059 --> 01:25:05,442
l'd better hurry and find him.
There's not much time.

1008
01:25:26,315 --> 01:25:28,771
-Are they after you now?
-l'm looking for Lundie.

1009
01:25:28,843 --> 01:25:31,778
l've got something
very important to tell you.

1010
01:25:31,852 --> 01:25:34,437
l'm not going back with you.
l'm gonna stay here.

1011
01:25:34,507 --> 01:25:36,646
''Oh, that's nice.''

1012
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:39,301
''Please, Jeff, be serious,
just for once.''

1013
01:25:39,372 --> 01:25:42,055
l am. l'm being serious
all over the place.

1014
01:25:42,123 --> 01:25:45,287
''l tell ya, l feel more
a part of her and all this...''

1015
01:25:45,355 --> 01:25:48,389
than l ever felt about Jane
or anybody or anything back home.

1016
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,875
-Great.
-l can't give it up. l belong here.

1017
01:25:51,948 --> 01:25:55,144
''Yeah, you belong here, all right.
No doubt about it.''

1018
01:25:55,211 --> 01:25:58,375
''Milking cows in the morning,
planting little things...''

1019
01:25:58,443 --> 01:26:00,418
''weaving, butter churning.''

1020
01:26:00,492 --> 01:26:02,913
''That's for you, boy.
You'll have a ball.''

1021
01:26:02,987 --> 01:26:06,303
''And just think,
you can do it for always, always...''

1022
01:26:06,379 --> 01:26:09,925
''in a town that's got one of
the longest ''''always'''' on record.''

1023
01:26:09,996 --> 01:26:13,771
lt's got nothing to do with
all these things you're talking about.

1024
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:16,040
Don't you see?
l believe in her.

1025
01:26:16,108 --> 01:26:19,457
''And what's more, l believe
in this place, and l can't leave.''

1026
01:26:19,532 --> 01:26:21,987
''Well, kiddies,
that's what happened to Tommy today.''

1027
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:25,856
''But what about his friend, Jeff?
Well, he had fun too.''

1028
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:29,193
Tonight he went running off through
the woods after some Highland hothead...

1029
01:26:29,259 --> 01:26:31,593
who was gonna make
all the people disappear...

1030
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:33,831
by crossing the wrong street.

1031
01:26:35,179 --> 01:26:37,514
''Well, after a while
Jeff thought he saw a bird...''

1032
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:41,158
''perched low in a tree,
and he shot at it.''

1033
01:26:41,228 --> 01:26:43,432
Something fell to the ground.

1034
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,816
''He rushed over to it,
and what do you think it was?''

1035
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:48,549
lt was Hothead Harry.

1036
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:53,507
''Yes, sir, the boy dervish himself,
lying there looking all dead.''

1037
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:54,921
You mean you--

1038
01:26:54,987 --> 01:26:58,632
To kill somebody somewhere else in the
world would have been an awful thing.

1039
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,497
But Harry was a citizen
of the little town that wasn't there...

1040
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:04,808
and he probably never lived
in the first place.

1041
01:27:04,876 --> 01:27:07,145
''Chances are,
there weren't even any woods.''

1042
01:27:07,211 --> 01:27:09,895
''ln fact, the whole day
probably never even happened...''

1043
01:27:09,964 --> 01:27:13,193
''because, you see,
this is a fairy tale.''

1044
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:17,035
''Oh, Jeff, you poor guy.
You must feel horrible.''

1045
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,627
''What do you mean, l must feel?''

1046
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,252
What am l supposed to feel
in a voodoo joint like this?

1047
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:24,619
''Dream stuff, boy, all made up
out of broomsticks and wishing wells.''

1048
01:27:24,683 --> 01:27:27,814
lt's that or a boot camp for lunatics.
l don't know what goes on around here.

1049
01:27:27,883 --> 01:27:31,047
''All l know is that whatever it is,
it's got nothing to do with me or you...''

1050
01:27:31,115 --> 01:27:33,603
and anything that happens
to either of us just doesn't count!

1051
01:27:33,676 --> 01:27:35,716
How can it when
you don't understand it?

1052
01:27:35,788 --> 01:27:39,017
''And you want to give up your family,
your friends, your whole life for this?''

1053
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:40,938
lt's not even worth arguing about.

1054
01:27:41,003 --> 01:27:44,931
Now go say good-bye to the little people
and thank them for the picnic.

1055
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:51,016
''You're confused, aren't you, boy?''

1056
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:54,760
''You know, if you believed as much
as you think you do, you wouldn't be.''

1057
01:27:59,436 --> 01:28:03,047
''Tommy, Fiona tells me
you want to stay.''

1058
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:05,417
l'll wait for you by the bridge.

1059
01:28:06,635 --> 01:28:10,280
''Tommy, what did he mean by that?''

1060
01:28:11,308 --> 01:28:13,413
What is it?

1061
01:28:13,484 --> 01:28:16,102
''Fiona, it's me.
l thought--''

1062
01:28:21,707 --> 01:28:24,642
''Do not be ashamed
of yourself, lad.''

1063
01:28:24,715 --> 01:28:27,333
lt's the hardest thing in the world
to give everything...

1064
01:28:27,403 --> 01:28:30,502
though it's usually the only way
to get everything.

1065
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:39,333
''You'd better hurry, Fiona.
There's not much time left.''

1066
01:28:46,603 --> 01:28:50,181
''Fiona, do you understand at all?''

1067
01:28:50,251 --> 01:28:53,186
-l think so.
-Then you're not sorry l came?

1068
01:28:53,259 --> 01:28:56,772
''No, l'm glad.
l'll be less lonely now.''

1069
01:28:56,843 --> 01:28:59,974
Real loneliness is not
bein' in love in vain...

1070
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,465
but not bein' in love at all.

1071
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:06,282
-lf l only had more time.
-lt's not your fault.

1072
01:29:10,059 --> 01:29:12,231
'Tis the end of our day!

1073
01:29:24,299 --> 01:29:27,616
''-lt isn't because l don't love you.
-l know, l know.''

1074
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:30,080
''But to stay, l had to have
no fears and no doubts.''

1075
01:29:30,155 --> 01:29:32,010
''Aye, Tommy, aye.''

1076
01:29:52,108 --> 01:29:53,798
''Good-bye, Tommy...''

1077
01:29:53,867 --> 01:29:57,283
''and do not forget
any day, any night...''

1078
01:29:57,355 --> 01:30:00,072
that always and always...

1079
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,179
l love you.

1080
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:04,455
l love you.

1081
01:30:04,523 --> 01:30:06,345
l love you.

1082
01:30:07,372 --> 01:30:09,030
l love you.

1083
01:30:10,187 --> 01:30:11,943
l love you.

1084
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:39,594
''Peter, Peter,
l left the dogs in the car.''

1085
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:43,304
Will you be a dear and ask the driver
to take them home and feed them?

1086
01:30:48,203 --> 01:30:51,203
''l can't afford to get a divorce,
what with community property and taxes.''

1087
01:30:51,276 --> 01:30:53,861
-But alimony is deductible.
-But she'll want capital.

1088
01:30:53,931 --> 01:30:56,582
l can't give her that.
lt isn't fair to the children.

1089
01:30:56,651 --> 01:31:00,961
''Darling, l'm so sorry l'm late,
but l had the most agonizing afternoon.''

1090
01:31:01,036 --> 01:31:03,491
My new analyst is divine.

1091
01:31:03,563 --> 01:31:05,864
He has the most
marvelous new theory.

1092
01:31:05,932 --> 01:31:10,187
He believes that childhood
hasn't got anything to do with anything.

1093
01:31:10,251 --> 01:31:12,804
-Sounds dreamy.
-l've got my standards.

1094
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:15,842
''l'll lie, cheat,
steal for this company...''

1095
01:31:15,915 --> 01:31:18,785
but l will not
give up my integrity.

1096
01:31:18,859 --> 01:31:22,754
l feel that a man is of value
to the organization as long as he--

1097
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:28,168
''-Yes, it arrived this afternoon.
-Have Andre fix it for a party at 6:00.''

1098
01:31:28,235 --> 01:31:31,334
Tell him for me that if he
messes up the sauce this time--

1099
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:34,785
''Great little car.
Hiya, Jeff.''

1100
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:37,096
Once you get into
one of those foreign cars--

1101
01:31:37,163 --> 01:31:40,676
''But, honey, why don't you
try and see my side of it?''

1102
01:31:40,748 --> 01:31:42,602
''Frank, bring me another brandy.''

1103
01:31:42,668 --> 01:31:44,871
''-lt's bourbon, sir.
-lt is?''

1104
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:48,322
''That's all you've had for four months,
ever since you got back from Scotland.''

1105
01:31:48,395 --> 01:31:51,461
ls that right?
l just decided l don't like it.

1106
01:31:51,531 --> 01:31:54,498
lt's not near as good as the whiskey
Mother used to make. l'll have brandy.

1107
01:31:54,571 --> 01:31:57,288
''-Yes, sir.
-Honey, l can't get home tonight.''

1108
01:31:57,355 --> 01:32:01,032
''l know, but l can't
let the boss down.''

1109
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,555
He's got this girl
that he wants to take out...

1110
01:32:03,627 --> 01:32:07,784
and he needs another man along
so it won't look like she's with him.

1111
01:32:08,619 --> 01:32:10,790
''Yes, dear.''

1112
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:13,129
''You'd better bring me
two glasses of water, Frank.''

1113
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:17,188
''l know, baby, but we can celebrate
your birthday tomorrow night.''

1114
01:32:17,259 --> 01:32:21,220
''Honey, l can't take any longer.
l've gotta get back. Talk to you later.''

1115
01:32:21,291 --> 01:32:23,527
Frank? Sorry.

1116
01:32:24,971 --> 01:32:27,360
''-Sorry.
-Would you like dinner, Mr. Douglas?''

1117
01:32:27,436 --> 01:32:29,574
-No. Bring me my lunch check.
-Certainly.

1118
01:32:29,643 --> 01:32:31,880
l think l'll eat out tonight.

1119
01:32:34,156 --> 01:32:38,018
''-Frank, bring me another.
-So soon? Where's the last one?''

1120
01:32:38,091 --> 01:32:41,670
lt vanished...
like Brigadoon.

1121
01:32:41,739 --> 01:32:43,593
''Like who, sir?''

1122
01:32:43,659 --> 01:32:46,212
That was the name
of my brother who ran away.

1123
01:32:50,859 --> 01:32:53,609
''Good evening, Mr. Albright.
Your table will be ready in a moment.''

1124
01:32:53,675 --> 01:32:55,530
''-Thank you, Peter.
-Tommy, Tommy.''

1125
01:32:55,595 --> 01:32:57,929
What's your opinion
about the Parker deal?

1126
01:32:57,995 --> 01:33:01,061
-l'll let you know tomorrow.
-l've got a real slant on it--

1127
01:33:01,131 --> 01:33:03,782
l'll tell you tomorrow.
l'll give you a call.

1128
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:07,496
''Albright, how about that meeting
this morning? Was that great?''

1129
01:33:07,563 --> 01:33:09,668
-Great.
-Things were brought out in the open.

1130
01:33:09,739 --> 01:33:11,975
-Let in a lot of fresh air.
-Great.

1131
01:33:12,043 --> 01:33:14,564
-Do you like how l handled the old man?
-Great.

1132
01:33:14,635 --> 01:33:16,490
''Thanks, Albright.''

1133
01:33:19,307 --> 01:33:21,674
-Hi.
-Hi.

1134
01:33:21,739 --> 01:33:24,260
-lt's hot in here.
-lt's not the heat. lt's the humanity.

1135
01:33:24,331 --> 01:33:27,592
''-Good evening, Mr. Albright.
-Oh, thank you, Frank.''

1136
01:33:27,659 --> 01:33:29,961
-Have you seen Jane?
-She meeting you here?

1137
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:32,897
-Yeah.
-l'll drink up and get outta here.

1138
01:33:32,971 --> 01:33:36,069
There's nothing a woman hates more
than her fiancé's best friend.

1139
01:33:36,139 --> 01:33:39,936
He knows the secrets she's gonna spend
the rest of her life tryin' to find out.

1140
01:33:40,011 --> 01:33:43,327
-l've been dodging her for a month now.
-Don't worry about it.

1141
01:33:43,403 --> 01:33:46,600
''l always say, scratch the surface
of any woman and she'll enjoy it.''

1142
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:49,285
-When are you getting married?
-l don't know.

1143
01:33:49,355 --> 01:33:52,737
-l don't know if l want to get married.
-Why?

1144
01:33:52,811 --> 01:33:55,462
''Because, old tank,
l'm in love with someone else...''

1145
01:33:55,531 --> 01:33:58,117
''and l ''''canna'''' get over it.''

1146
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:04,489
''And the trouble is, because l can't
be with her, l can't be with anyone.''

1147
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:06,726
So many things
remind me of her.

1148
01:34:06,795 --> 01:34:09,129
''l'll be talking with people,
and they might say one little word...''

1149
01:34:09,195 --> 01:34:13,058
''that opens the door
to a memory for me, and then...''

1150
01:34:13,131 --> 01:34:17,539
''l'm a few thousand miles away with--
well, you know.''

1151
01:34:17,611 --> 01:34:21,986
''But slowly l come back to the
conversation, they ask me a question...''

1152
01:34:22,059 --> 01:34:24,393
and l don't know what in the world
they've been talking about.

1153
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:28,419
-l haven't heard a word.
-You must be fascinating company.

1154
01:34:28,491 --> 01:34:29,866
lt ain't easy.

1155
01:34:40,491 --> 01:34:42,346
''-Hello, Jane!
-Hello, Jane!''

1156
01:34:42,411 --> 01:34:44,899
''-You've certainly been elusive.
-Hello, Jeff.''

1157
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:47,240
l've been up to my neck at the office.
Would you like a drink?

1158
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:50,307
''Love one. An old-fashioned, please,
and would you bring it to the table?''

1159
01:34:50,379 --> 01:34:53,346
''-How are you, Jeff?
-Darling, it's been weeks.''

1160
01:34:53,419 --> 01:34:55,688
''-Fine, Jane. How are you?
-l'm sorry.''

1161
01:34:55,755 --> 01:34:57,894
''Oh, l've had a little cold,
but other than that--''

1162
01:34:57,963 --> 01:35:01,224
-But you could've called more often.
-l hate to eat and run.

1163
01:35:01,291 --> 01:35:03,298
''-Your table is ready, Mr. Albright.
-Thank you.''

1164
01:35:03,371 --> 01:35:05,258
-l'll call you later.
-Hello!

1165
01:35:05,323 --> 01:35:08,520
''Good-bye!
Frank, put it on the bill.''

1166
01:35:08,587 --> 01:35:11,783
''-Your bill, sir, is very high.
-So am l!''

1167
01:35:15,947 --> 01:35:17,954
''-Jane, you look fine.
-So do you.''

1168
01:35:18,027 --> 01:35:21,540
''-Would you care to order dinner now?
-No, we'll finish our drinks first.''

1169
01:35:21,611 --> 01:35:24,164
''Darling, l wish you'd been
with me over the weekend.''

1170
01:35:24,235 --> 01:35:27,617
''l went up to Connecticut, house hunting.
Saw the most wonderful place.''

1171
01:35:27,691 --> 01:35:31,750
''Rather interesting. Colonial,
and right on top of a beautiful hill.''

1172
01:35:31,819 --> 01:35:34,885
Through the heather

1173
01:35:34,955 --> 01:35:37,770
On the hill

1174
01:35:39,115 --> 01:35:41,352
The mornin' dew

1175
01:35:41,419 --> 01:35:45,445
ls blinkin' yonder

1176
01:35:45,515 --> 01:35:47,936
There's lazy music

1177
01:35:48,011 --> 01:35:51,808
On the rill

1178
01:35:51,883 --> 01:35:56,968
And all l want to do is wander

1179
01:35:57,035 --> 01:36:00,002
Through the heather--

1180
01:36:00,075 --> 01:36:02,563
''And l didn't think you'd
want to do that, would you?''

1181
01:36:02,635 --> 01:36:05,352
''Hmm? Uh, maybe.''

1182
01:36:05,419 --> 01:36:07,524
''You mean, you'd even consider it?''

1183
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:08,936
What?

1184
01:36:09,003 --> 01:36:11,392
Commuting from
60 miles out of New York.

1185
01:36:11,467 --> 01:36:14,435
''-No, l wouldn't wanna do that.
-l didn't think so.''

1186
01:36:14,507 --> 01:36:17,157
And l told Mr. Bradville.

1187
01:36:17,227 --> 01:36:20,293
-Who?
-Herbert Bradville.

1188
01:36:21,643 --> 01:36:24,228
''-Who's he?
-Darling, he's the real estate man...''

1189
01:36:24,299 --> 01:36:27,016
l just told you
l've been working with.

1190
01:36:27,082 --> 01:36:31,555
''l told him you'd call, so please do.
l'm trying hard to arrange everything.''

1191
01:36:31,627 --> 01:36:35,489
''By the way, do you still want
Jeff to stand up for you?''

1192
01:36:35,563 --> 01:36:38,760
''Yes, if he can.''

1193
01:36:38,827 --> 01:36:40,201
Why?

1194
01:36:41,227 --> 01:36:44,904
Nothing. lt's just
he's so impossible these days.

1195
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:47,337
Everybody's bored to death with him.

1196
01:36:47,403 --> 01:36:50,185
''Maybe l'm not interested
in everybody, Jane.''

1197
01:36:50,251 --> 01:36:54,626
''Well, you certainly have been antisocial
since you got back from Scotland.''

1198
01:36:54,699 --> 01:36:57,732
l thought for a while there was
something really bothering you.

1199
01:36:57,802 --> 01:36:59,777
You certainly wouldn't
keep me waiting and--

1200
01:36:59,851 --> 01:37:03,910
Waitin' for my dearie

1201
01:37:03,979 --> 01:37:08,005
And happy am l

1202
01:37:08,075 --> 01:37:10,344
To hold my heart

1203
01:37:10,411 --> 01:37:16,390
'Til he comes strollin' by

1204
01:37:16,459 --> 01:37:19,044
''-Give me a ring, won't you?
-Oh, of course.''

1205
01:37:19,115 --> 01:37:22,857
'' When he comes, my dearie''

1206
01:37:22,923 --> 01:37:26,981
One look and l'll know

1207
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:29,353
That he's the dearie

1208
01:37:29,419 --> 01:37:34,023
l've been wantin' so

1209
01:37:34,091 --> 01:37:37,538
''-When l see you wander around like--
-No, Jane. No.''

1210
01:37:37,611 --> 01:37:41,059
-No what?
-There won't be a wedding next month.

1211
01:37:41,131 --> 01:37:44,393
''-Do you mean you're postponing it again?
-No, Jane, l'm not postponing it.''

1212
01:37:44,459 --> 01:37:47,525
-l'm calling it off for good.
-Calling it off?

1213
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:50,497
''Jane, l'm sorry.
You've been wonderful, darling.''

1214
01:37:50,571 --> 01:37:53,887
''lt's not your fault, but something
strange happened to me a few months ago.''

1215
01:37:53,963 --> 01:37:56,832
''l can't explain it,
but l just don't fit here anymore.''

1216
01:37:56,907 --> 01:37:59,395
You've gone clean out of your mind.

1217
01:37:59,467 --> 01:38:02,947
We can't stand here and talk about it.
Let's go home and--

1218
01:38:03,019 --> 01:38:06,696
''Go home, go home
Go home with bonnie Jean''

1219
01:38:06,763 --> 01:38:08,257
'' Go home, go home''

1220
01:38:08,331 --> 01:38:10,884
''lf you want to stay and make
a fool of yourself, you can.''

1221
01:38:10,955 --> 01:38:12,810
l'll go home with bonnie Jean

1222
01:38:12,875 --> 01:38:16,355
'' Go home, go home
Go home with bonnie Jean''

1223
01:38:18,507 --> 01:38:21,321
Until l'm old enough
for Social Security...

1224
01:38:21,387 --> 01:38:23,525
l've got my expense account.

1225
01:38:23,595 --> 01:38:26,824
''But most important of all,
l'm building.''

1226
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:31,560
Building every day. That's about
the only security a man can have.

1227
01:38:31,627 --> 01:38:34,497
''Hello. Room 732, please.''

1228
01:38:34,570 --> 01:38:37,026
''Jeff, are you sober?
Listen to me.''

1229
01:38:37,099 --> 01:38:39,913
l wanna go back to Scotland.
You wanna come along?

1230
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:42,695
Never mind what for!
Do you wanna come with me?

1231
01:38:42,763 --> 01:38:45,184
''Okay, get plane reservations
right away.''

1232
01:38:45,259 --> 01:38:48,707
''l know it isn't there,
but l wanna see where it was!''

1233
01:38:48,779 --> 01:38:52,707
''Who cares if it doesn't make sense?
Jeff, l wanna go!''

1234
01:38:52,779 --> 01:38:54,470
l've got to!

1235
01:39:06,795 --> 01:39:09,032
lt's unbelievable.

1236
01:39:09,099 --> 01:39:12,547
-Awful and unbelievable.
-What is?

1237
01:39:12,618 --> 01:39:16,481
''To think that down there, somewhere
between the mist and the stars...''

1238
01:39:16,554 --> 01:39:21,191
''there's someone l want so terribly,
and l know she's not dead.''

1239
01:39:21,258 --> 01:39:25,863
''She's only asleep,
and yet l'll never see her again.''

1240
01:39:25,931 --> 01:39:28,866
''Well, you didn't have to come
all the way over here just to say that.''

1241
01:39:28,938 --> 01:39:32,321
You could've told me on the phone
back in New York for a dime.

1242
01:39:32,395 --> 01:39:34,631
''No, l'll tell you why.''

1243
01:39:34,698 --> 01:39:37,797
She became so alive to me that
l had to come back and see for myself...

1244
01:39:37,867 --> 01:39:40,617
if the place really wasn't here.

1245
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:43,203
lt didn't work that way for me.

1246
01:39:43,275 --> 01:39:45,697
lt's so much like a dream now
that l have to work hard...

1247
01:39:45,771 --> 01:39:48,454
to convince myself
it happened at all.

1248
01:39:48,523 --> 01:39:51,011
''There's the big difference
between us, Jeff.''

1249
01:39:51,083 --> 01:39:54,344
''Oh, tell me about it.''

1250
01:39:55,914 --> 01:39:58,762
l found that...

1251
01:39:58,827 --> 01:40:02,439
sometimes the things you believe in
become more real to you...

1252
01:40:02,507 --> 01:40:06,401
than all the things
you can explain away or understand.

1253
01:40:08,331 --> 01:40:11,048
''Oh, why do people
have to lose things...''

1254
01:40:11,115 --> 01:40:13,832
to find out
what they really mean?

1255
01:40:15,787 --> 01:40:18,088
''Well, let's start walkin'.''

1256
01:40:18,154 --> 01:40:20,937
l got lost around here once.

1257
01:40:21,003 --> 01:40:24,298
Brigadoon

1258
01:40:24,362 --> 01:40:27,777
Brigadoon

1259
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:32,193
Blooming under

1260
01:40:32,267 --> 01:40:36,358
Sable skies

1261
01:40:38,539 --> 01:40:41,855
Brigadoon

1262
01:40:41,931 --> 01:40:46,121
Brigadoon

1263
01:40:46,186 --> 01:40:51,882
There my heart forever

1264
01:40:51,946 --> 01:40:55,524
Lies

1265
01:40:56,490 --> 01:41:00,680
Let the world grow cold

1266
01:41:00,746 --> 01:41:04,194
Around us

1267
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:08,675
Let the heavens

1268
01:41:08,747 --> 01:41:11,529
Cry above

1269
01:41:12,907 --> 01:41:14,762
Tommy!

1270
01:41:23,819 --> 01:41:26,153
''Tommy, lad, you!''

1271
01:41:26,218 --> 01:41:30,245
''My, my, you must really love her.
You woke me up.''

1272
01:41:31,466 --> 01:41:33,888
''Come, lad.''

1273
01:41:49,995 --> 01:41:52,417
You shouldn't be too surprised.

1274
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:55,622
''l told ya, if ya loved
someone deeply enough...''

1275
01:41:55,691 --> 01:41:58,244
anything is possible.

1276
01:42:00,874 --> 01:42:03,296
Even miracles.

1277
01:42:43,978 --> 01:42:47,753
Brigadoon

1278
01:42:47,818 --> 01:42:50,786
Brigadoon

1279
01:42:53,131 --> 01:42:58,346
ln my valley

1280
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:03,527
There'll be

1281
01:43:03,595 --> 01:43:06,661
Love

1282
01:43:06,731 --> 01:43:10,342
There'll be love
