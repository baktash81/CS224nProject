1
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:36,166
I can hear

2
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:40,900
Church bells tolling

3
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:45,570
I can hear

4
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:50,207
Saints a-singing

5
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:53,844
I can see

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,981
See hearse wheels rollin'

7
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:03,027
Somebody's leavin'

8
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:08,329
The world of toil and strife

9
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:17,173
I realize...
that surely and eventually

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,940
We're gonna leave

11
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:25,610
This old world behind,
yes, we are

12
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,813
That's why I'm makin'

13
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:33,587
Oh, yes, I am,
making preparations

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,823
He-e-e-ey...
to meet the Lord

15
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,420
To meet

16
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,590
He-e-e-ey

17
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,430
The Lord

18
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:46,939
A woman came up to me one day...

19
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,769
Thanks, Darrin.

20
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,275
You're welcome.

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,976
She said I'm not ready...

22
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,950
I'm not ready to give up
my wicked ways...

23
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,714
You want to be
my girlfriend?

24
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,884
Sorry, but I want to marry
Michael Jackson.

25
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,092
Darrin, Lilly,
get in there and sit down.

26
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,831
...he gives me a hard time

27
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,339
Yeah, yeah

28
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,841
I told that woman

29
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,314
I told that woman how
could you hold out any longer

30
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:37,949
When you see that Jesus...
Jesus, he loves you so?

31
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,925
Then I heard her say,
I'm gettin' ready

32
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,227
Yeah, gettin' ready

33
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,530
I'm gettin' ready
to meet the Lord

34
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,967
To meet

35
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,402
Oh, yes, I am

36
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,065

37
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,506
Gonna holler and testify

38
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,476

Gettin' ready

50
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:11,913

Are you ready?

59
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,058
Gettin' ready

60
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,295
Are you ready?

61
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,301
Gettin' ready

62
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,302
Are you gettin' ready?

63
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,303
Gettin' ready

64
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,304
I'm gettin' ready

00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,807
I'm gettin' ready

00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,934
Gettin' ready

68
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,942
Oh, yes, I am

69
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,138
To meet the Lord

70
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,682
- To meet
- Yeah

71
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,512
Yeah, yeah

72
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,950
The Lord

73
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,646
To meet the Lord.

74
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,723
Oh, I'm looking for that stone

75
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,951
That stone, that

76
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,754
Flew down the mountain

77
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,523
I'm looking for that stone
that came...

78
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,360
Oh, alleluia

79
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,957
I'm looking for that stone,
yes, I am

80
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,763
Flew down the mountain

81
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,303
And it's coming
all the way down

82
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,168
- Yes, it is
- Coming down

83
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,337
Coming down... to the
demon town, yeah, girl

84
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,505
We're near it,
the 21st Century

85
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,915
Oh, yeah, and the Lord
could come at any time

86
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:13,917
At any time

87
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,920
- In a second
- A second

88
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,183
- In a moment
- A moment

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,554
In a twinkle of an eye

90
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,684
Eye

91
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,127
Going to my home up,
up in the sky

92
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,530
Oh, I'm looking
for that stone, yes, I am

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,329
Hewn off the mountain

94
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,802
I'm looking for that stone

95
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,668
Rolling down to earth

96
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,538
I've got to find my stone,
yes, I have

97
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,735
Hewn off the mountain

98
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,277
And it's coming down

99
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,277
Down

100
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,711
All the way down

101
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,146
All the way down

102
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,581
All the way down

103
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,551
To redeem a dying world

104
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,813
Oh, that stone

105
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,616
Oh, that stone, oh, that stone

106
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,953
I love that stone, yes, sir

107
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,357
That Jesus called a stone

108
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,588
- That healed the stone
- Rejected that stone

109
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,927
- That stone
- That stone

110
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,558
I love that stone, yeah,
I love that stone

111
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,092
- Well...<i>*</i>
- I love that stone

112
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,866
I found that stone that was...

113
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,770
Hewn off the mountain

114
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,833
I found that stone, yes, I did

115
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,345
Rolling down the mountain

116
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,109
Said I love my stone

117
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,582
- Whoa!
- Hewn off the mountain

118
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,778
And it's coming
all the way down

119
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,616
- All the way down
- Coming all down

120
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,919
- To redeem a dying world
- To redeem...

121
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,753
Yes, it is

122
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,726
...a dying world

123
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,764
- A dying world.
- World!

124
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,889
Bless you.

125
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,026
Oh, my goodness,
there she goes again.

126
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,194
Wouldn't be a normal Sunday

127
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,931
if Faye didn't get
slain in the spirit.

128
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,030
Uh-huh.

129
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,039
Oh, Maryann.

130
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,040
Pastor.

131
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,168
This boy is growing like a weed.

132
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,576
You must be feeding
him fertilizer.

133
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,808
And his teachers say
he's the smartest in his class.

134
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:50,940
There she is.

135
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,949
Hold her, Reverend.

136
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,952
The nerve.

137
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,486
Standing in the house of God

138
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,819
and all the while
singing the devil's music.

139
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,414
Paulina, what's this all about?

140
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,892
I found this down
at Robinson's store.

141
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,086
It's Maryann,

142
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,062
singing that R&B sex music.

143
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,393
Oh. Oh, uh, uh,

144
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,629
uh, Maryann. Maryann!

145
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,670
What you got to say
about all this?

146
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,263
I finally got my chance
to become a singer.

147
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,331
I didn't think
anything was wrong.

148
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,673
Reverend, the church bylaws
clearly state

149
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,236
that no member shall partake
of fornication,

150
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,338
Amen.

151
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,347
Gambling.

152
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,348
Amen.

153
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,146
And drinking, which
is all going on down

154
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,914
at that juke joint
where she sings.

155
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,818
Just take a look at this.

156
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,915
"Do it to me again."

157
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,424
My, my, my, my, my.

158
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,927
Now, we all know
what "it" means.

159
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,155
Paulina.

160
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,698
I'm surprised you'd
even remember what "it" is.

161
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,461
And besides,

162
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,559
what were you doing
down at the record store

163
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,331
Iooking through
"the devil's music"?

164
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,635
I got the Lord on my
side with this one.

165
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,140
Paulina, you need to hush.

166
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,266
Tell her, honey.

167
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,275
Because this girl

168
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,471
ain't doing nothing
to hurt nobody.

169
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,774
Amen, sister Sally.

170
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,543
Need I remind you
of the church motto?

171
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,278
Tell her, sister!

172
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:04,051
"Beware of brief delight
and lasting shame."

173
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,284
That must be them kids
on that organ again.

174
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,417
I'm-I'm gonna go.

175
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,551
Stop stalling, Paul.

176
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,890
You know the church rules.

177
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,826
- You're supposed to handle this.
- Paulina,

178
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,490
I'm the pastor here.
Leave it to me, please?

179
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,034
You do your job, boy,
or I'm going to go and get Mama.

180
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,034
Now, you know you're supposed

181
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,127
to call me "reverend"
around here.

182
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,364
I'm going to handle this
my way, okay?

183
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,566
Now, Maryann.

184
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,108
It's like this.

185
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:26,937
It's like she says.

186
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,143
You stop singing
that secular music,

187
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,914
or you're going to have
to leave the choir.

188
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,579
I'm sorry.

189
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,385
It's your pick.

190
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,619
Make up your mind, child.

191
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,821
Think about what
you're doing, sister.

192
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,409
Wave good-bye to Aunt Sally.

193
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,060
Darrin, here's that

194
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,227
market research you wanted,

195
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,736
and I know you're real busy,

196
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,397
but there's something
you should know.

197
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,067
Yes... I'm going
to blow them away.

198
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,234
I'm a player.

199
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,436
I'm in the zone.

200
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,241
Corner office, huge window.

201
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,144
Take care of these
credit card bills for me.

202
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,239
All right.

203
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,750
Use this one
to pay off this one, okay?

204
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,411
- Okay.
- And, uh, do a balance transfer

205
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,421
from... oh, excuse me...
from here to here

206
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,081
for that one, all right,

207
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,455
and cover this one
with that one.

208
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,256
So, what were you
trying to say earlier?

209
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,923
There's a private investigator
over there looking for you.

210
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,261
Why?

211
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,800
Who's trying to find me?

212
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,267
I'm double checking...
is Darrin Hill around?

213
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,805
What did he say?
Did you tell him anything?

214
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,862
Does he know what I look like?

215
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,373
No. Chill.

216
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,966
I told him you're not in,

217
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,274
- so he's leaving a message.
- Uh, tell him I'm out of town.

218
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,313
I did.

219
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,042
Good.

220
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,482
Time to climb
the corporate ladder.

221
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,880
By our projections,

222
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,718
this plan will increase
the market shares

223
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,488
of Lincoln & Gerald Liquors
by a whopping eight percent

224
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,496
in as little as two years.

225
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,589
We were hoping to see
faster growth.

226
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,156
We can give them
double digit growth.

227
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,500
As I said, it is

228
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,039
the company position that
eight percent growth should be

229
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,198
the goal.

230
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,242
- Now...
- lf there's a different opinion

231
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,471
that'll lead to better growth,
we want to hear it.

232
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,647
Now let me ask you

233
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,554
which demographic consumes
the most malt liquor?

234
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,922
Go ahead, you can say it.

235
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,019
Black people.

236
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,359
There you go.

237
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,922
Very good.

238
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,762
However, I noticed
in your company report

239
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,735
that you don't have
a malt liquor division.

240
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,294
I noticed that, too.

241
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,839
I propose

242
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,932
a new ad campaign
for a malt liquor division

243
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,103
that maximizes exposure
in the African-American market.

244
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,272
Place positive images
of your product

245
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,906
in areas
where black people live.

246
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,951
By tapping into
the buying power

247
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,518
of this consumer base,

248
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,952
you'll pass single-digit growth
faster than a pro athlete

249
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,013
can get his criminal charges
dropped.

250
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,953
That, my friends,
is not thinking outside the box.

251
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,930
That's realizing
there is no box.

252
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,627
Now, those are the kind of ideas
we hired this company for.

253
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,669
Where have you been hiding
this one, Fairchild?

254
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,170
He's one
of our junior executives.

255
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,865
This man needs to be
on the team.

256
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,807
I mean, he was a junior
executive... before today.

257
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,071
Congratulations.
You've just been promoted.

258
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,134
Thank you, sir.

259
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,805
Where'd you learn
that kind of thinking?

260
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,644
- Yale.
- Oh, I'm a Princeton man myself,

261
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,616
but I see we let one get away.

262
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,184
Okay, well, we better leave

263
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,849
and let them get started
on this interesting idea.

264
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,931
Well, I guess I'll be giving you

265
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,591
a corner office with a view.

266
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,101
Thank you, sir.

267
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,295
Cigar?

268
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,784
Well, this is France's finest.

269
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,913
I first encountered it
growing up in Monte Carlo.

270
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,753
Please, you're a New York boy
if I ever saw one.

271
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,816
No, I lived there
until I was 17.

272
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:38,728
Wow, I have never met a brother
who grew up in Europe before.

273
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,164
Actually, I was born
in South America.

274
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,393
Where?

275
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,801
Homé Vidéo.

276
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,967
That's in Peru, right?

277
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,977
Venezuela.
My father was in oil.

278
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,070
You sound so American.

279
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,615
Well, I went to prep school
here... at Andover.

280
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,150
Money was no object.

281
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,243
- Cool.
- Mr. Hill,

282
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,845
I'm afraid your credit card
has been declined.

283
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,086
R-Right, that was, uh,
not activated yet.

284
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:15,896
Okay. Uh... try this one.

285
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,096
Darrin, Mr. Fairchild
wants to see you

286
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,764
first thing in the morning.

287
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,433
Great.

288
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,737
Great, great, great.

289
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,107
As you can see,
there is nothing

290
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,544
in my refrigerator but water,

291
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,945
water and wine.

292
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,175
This is the dining room.

293
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,444
We don't spend a lot of time

294
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,783
in here so it looks
very nice and well-set.

295
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,288
Like this chandelier...

296
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,789
it's not just
a normal chandelier.

297
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,450
It's just kind of funky and fun.

298
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,659
You wanted to see me, sir?

299
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,358
Darrin.

300
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,630
What I have to say
is very difficult.

301
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,969
We have a, uh... situation.

302
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,599
A situation that involves
deception,

303
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,904
a lack of candor,

304
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,138
and an unbridled passion

305
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,907
to get what one wants
at any cost.

306
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,039
I think you know
what I'm referring to.

307
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,913
Of course, sir, company policy.

308
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,109
No, no, no...

309
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,653
well, yes, of course it is,

310
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,246
but in this case
it's something more personal.

311
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,019
Darrin, you're fired.

312
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,552
Fired?

313
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,030
But why?

314
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,795
A representative
of Lincoln & Gerald

315
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:26,395
has an annoying habit
of checking up on things.

316
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,772
It seems that you were
thrown out of Yale

317
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:31,935
when it was discovered

318
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,946
you faked your high school
diploma from Andover.

319
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,709
How long did you think
it would take

320
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,773
before your deception
caught up with you?

321
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,319
But, sir,
I've been doing such good work.

322
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,547
Mr. Hill,

323
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,385
we cannot be represented
by people who tell lies.

324
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,288
We're in advertising.

325
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,384
You obtained this job
under false pretenses,

326
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,861
and now you've caused the firm
great embarrassment

327
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,398
in front of important clients.

328
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,399
I'm sorry.
I have to let you go.

329
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,094
You're good, you're smart,

330
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,637
but you broke
the Eleventh Commandment...

331
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,366
"Thou shalt not get caught."

332
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:03,797
Now...

333
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,276
Sir, please,
you're making a big mistake.

334
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,312
I'm here for you.

335
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,744
I'm smart, I'm ambitious...

336
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,746
Have your things

337
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,476
out of here in half an hour.

338
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,621
I'm disappointed in you.

339
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,252
I expected more
from a congressman's son.

340
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,825
Darrin Hill?

341
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,832
Yes.

342
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,596
You've been a tough one
to track down, Mr. Hill.

343
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,931
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

344
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,598
but this is for you.

345
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:39,303
What is it? A subpoena?
Summons?

346
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,814
Ploy to distract me
while you repo my stuff?

347
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,373
Sure, those are fun,
but no.

348
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,544
Oh, my Aunt Sally died.

349
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,284
"We request your presence
at the funeral

350
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,121
and reading of the will."

351
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,285
Oh...

352
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,726
The funeral is tomorrow.

353
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,456
Maybe you should
ask your boss

354
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,792
for some time off.

355
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,800
You know you just cut
a brother, right?

356
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,893
Oh.

357
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,130
Hurts when you do that, man.

358
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,039
Sorry.

359
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,280
Come on, baby.

360
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,353
Make me happy.

361
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,187
Cash advance.

362
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,666
Be a winner.
Be a winner.

363
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,724
Whoo-hoo!

364
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:42,031
Thank you, Bank of Piscataway.

365
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:06,255
Heaven only knows

366
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:13,602
How much I love you, baby

367
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:19,702
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
oh, oh, oh

368
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:25,944
Heaven's in your eyes...

369
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,354
Baby, please

370
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:35,450
Please don't take
your love from me

371
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:39,122
I am yours forevermore

372
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,862
Till eternity

373
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,530
Silently

374
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,699
Listen to the words
I say

375
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,836
Now I'm not talking
just for play

376
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,437
Listen to me, please...

377
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,210
I told you kids ain't got

378
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,547
no business playing
a man's game.

379
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,747
Funny, that's the same thing
someone told me...

380
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:04,789
oh...

381
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,324
two hours ago.

382
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,723
Don't you know

383
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,693
Don't you know,
don't you know

384
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:17,794
Love is all I need

385
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,237
'Cause I love you
and I need you

386
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,870
Yes, I want you,
gotta have you

387
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,346
Ooh, yeah, yeah.

388
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,796
Spent my whole life

389
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:50,528
On the way
to someplace else

390
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:55,232
Thinking right around
the bend

391
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,073
I might find myself

392
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:04,104
But the search goes on

393
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:08,483
I won't quit
till I get home.

394
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,521
Hi.

395
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,530
Hi.

396
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,160
Can I get something
to eat around here?

397
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,894
Reed?

398
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,805
Coming right up.

399
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,174
Better make that to go.

400
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,337
I need a taxi.

401
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,506
Reed's only got two hands.

402
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,244
Wait until he fixes
your dinner.

403
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,683
Right.

404
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,386
No signal.

405
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,890
Wait, wait, wait.

406
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,722
Oh!

407
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,162
You must be Darrin.

408
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,467
Damn, word, get low.

409
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,528
What's up?

410
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,234
Darrin, I'm Lucius, man,

411
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,276
I'm your welcome committee.

412
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,868
Oh, well,
how'd you know I was here?

413
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,572
Man, word travels
fast, and Aunt Sally

414
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,115
always bragged she had a
successful nephew from New York.

415
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,377
Let me get your stuff, man.

416
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,383
Really?

417
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,384
Come on.

418
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,477
Oh.

419
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,351
Monte Carlo didn't change, man.

420
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,219
It used to be a one-horse town.

421
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,656
What, did the horse die?

422
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,354
No, see, see, now you'll see,
you'll see, you'll see.

423
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,862
We got everything to offer
that a big city does.

424
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,193
Oh.

425
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,131
I'm happy to have another
player in town, man.

426
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,725
I've got tired of
holding this down solo.

427
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,860
Hey, man, reach over there

428
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,404
and pull this handle
from the inside.

429
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,564
It only open from the inside.

430
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,074
Okay.

431
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,201
- Appreciate that.
- Sure.

432
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,269
So you came by train.
That's cool.

433
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,075
I was trying to meet the bus.

434
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,616
Going to the Canaan Inn.

435
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,049
Okay, that-that Canaan Inn,

436
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,586
that's straight down this road

437
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,781
about five minutes.

438
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,588
Oh. Whoa.

439
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,632
Your door won't open,
and mine won't stay shut.

440
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,758
But it opens.

441
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,825
Oh.

442
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,132
Yes, it opens.

443
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,369
The next hour of programming

444
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,434
is brought to you by
Mitchell's Funeral Home,

445
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:17,346
where the caskets are so nice,
you'll wish you were dead.

446
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,508
Now for the news.

447
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,246
Like to give a shout out
to Darrin Hill,

448
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,151
in town for Sally's funeral.

449
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,951
Welcome home, little Darrin.

450
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:25,955
That's news?

451
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,616
I'll be right back
with traffic.

452
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,682
There is no traffic.

453
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,852
There is no traffic.

454
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,123
This is easy.
I could do this job.

455
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,688
Oh, I wonder what
the temperature is.

456
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:35,960
The temperature is 85.

457
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,467
Thanks.

458
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,130
Boy, you done got up there
in New York and got soft,

459
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,639
and this ain't nothing compared
to July and August.

460
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,802
That's when you can take an egg
and just fry it on the sidewalk.

461
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:46,969
Well, you can keep that.

462
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,979
After the funeral, I'm going
straight back to New York City,

463
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,481
where we don't have eggs frying
on the sidewalk.

464
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,848
Why? Because it's cold?

465
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,887
No, because it's civilization.

466
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,047
There's too much urine
on the sidewalk.

467
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,220
See, boy, see, you don't
know what you're missing.

468
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,594
Now I'm telling you,
now the hotter

469
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,927
it get down here,
the less and less

470
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,226
the honeys start wearing.

471
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,928
You know, they got to
let that booty bo...

472
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,537
...got to let
that booty breathe.

473
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,503
Now I'm telling you,

474
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,699
I know you got all your

475
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,901
Naomo Campbos
and your Holle Berrys,

476
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:18,943
and your Teary-Eyed Banks,

477
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,476
all them models
and junk up there,

478
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,708
but for the booty, you
got to come down south.

479
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,046
We booty experts.
Booty-ologists.

480
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,915
Booty is in the eye
of the beholder.

481
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,216
No, booty gonna be in my hand.

482
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,813
Check it out now, you see,

483
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,189
now your Louisiana booty,
it gets its renowned buoyancy

484
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,751
from its heavy seafood diet,
while your Alabama booty,

485
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,387
it's characterized
by its density.

486
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,557
You're talking
about a quarter-bouncing ping.

487
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,658
And as for your
Mississippi booty,

488
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,532
it's been an ongoing debate,

489
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,368
but consensus say that the
Indian-genetic contribution

490
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,873
gives us its beautiful tone.

491
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,704
And as for your
Georgia booty,

492
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,507
it's been known for ages
that the Georgia sun

493
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,480
bakes and seals
all the booty juices

494
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,141
into a slow roast.

495
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,185
I see I'm dealing
with a connoisseur.

496
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,690
Oh yeah, for sure.
A booty connoisseur.

497
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,884
Oh. Who's that?

498
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,292
Lilly. Please, hurry up.

499
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,455
That's Lilly.

500
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,123
Forget all of that booty stuff.

501
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,565
She's in a spectrum
of fine as the energy

502
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,126
is so potent, she got
a class-action suit

503
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,466
against her right now

504
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,302
for reckless endangerment, man.

505
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,466
Sounds like

506
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,907
a special kind of woman.

507
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,534
Well, holler at me
later on tonight.

508
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,805
I'll hook you up with her.

509
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,246
This is where you're staying.

510
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,187
I thought they were
putting me up in a hotel.

511
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,486
This looks like a house.

512
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,618
It's a boarding house.

513
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,389
It's the only place
that has room.

514
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,294
The prison officer's
convention is in town.

515
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,389
Hey, Jimmy B.

516
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,797
Hey, what up, Smooth L?

517
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,596
His grandmother
owns the place.

518
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,637
You Darrin?

519
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,636
Yes.

520
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,763
You're late.

521
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,774
Yo, come on, everybody
is already at the funeral.

522
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,742
- Um... uh...
- Get in.

523
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,415
Mama catch me put a whuppin'
to my backside

524
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,115
And even as a crack fiend...

525
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,588
Hey, man, now, come on, look.

526
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,818
That's inappropriate
music for this occasion.

527
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,860
Show some respect.

528
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,191
This man's auntie is
about to be maggot food.

529
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,322
At any moment, the funeral
is beginning

530
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,367
of Sally Walker.

531
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,631
Let us have a moment of silence
to pay our respect.

532
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,273
Uh, uh, sorry 'bout that.

533
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,939
I guess I was celebrating
her life

534
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,246
a little late, uh,
into the night.

535
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:43,617
Oh, Simon. Sarah,
how are y'all doing today?

536
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,384
This is Aunt Sally's nephew,
Darrin.

537
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,550
Nice to meet you.

538
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,059
Sorry about your aunt.

539
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,254
Oh, yes, we all
loved Miss Sally.

540
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,661
Why, she was little
Nicholas' godmother.

541
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,358
Hey, little man.

542
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,563
You know I'm your daddy, right?

543
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:11,574
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

544
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,811
I'm in the friggin'
twilight zone.

545
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,944
Wake up.

546
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,971
Wake up.

547
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,900
Oh, Sally!

548
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,905
Why'd it have to be her?

549
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,134
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord.

550
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,871
Good Lord, Faye!

551
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,608
Couldn't you find someplace else
to be slain in the spirit?

552
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,411
Grandma, get up.

553
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,042
She's your grandma?

554
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,450
- Yeah.
- Oh, Lord, oh, Lord.

555
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,852
They've got a lot of nerve

556
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,588
showing their faces
in the House of God.

557
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,562
I'm glad my dear departed
husband James

558
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,565
isn't here to witness
this abomination.

559
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,794
You can't keep people
from a funeral, Paulina.

560
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,301
Besides, they all love Sally.

561
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,463
They're a bunch of heathens.

562
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,372
I don't even know why she cared.

563
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,709
Move down.

564
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,865
Brothers and sisters,
we are gathered here today

565
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,903
to pay tribute
to a great woman...

566
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,027
Yeah!

567
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,629
...Sally Walker.

568
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:21,005
And we will now be blessed
with a selection from the choir

569
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,377
and their lead singer,

570
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,643
Reverend Shirley Caesar.

571
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,626
Oh...

572
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,831
I got a signal. It's a miracle.

573
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,561
Son, if that ain't Jesus
calling, shut it off.

574
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,798
Sorry. Go on.

575
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,532
I, uh... I...

576
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,234
cell phone's been out of range.

577
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,935
Has Mr. Fairchild
changed his mind?

578
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,943
I...

579
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,577
What?!

580
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,418
They've already started
repossessing your stuff.

581
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,821
Not my TV!

582
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,888
Nothing can replace Aunt Sally!

583
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,522
Not my TV, not my Bose
home theater system...

584
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah, let it out, son,
let it out.

585
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,434
Mm, yeah. Mm.

586
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,802
Keep stalling the creditors,
I'll call you back.

587
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,070
It's all right.

588
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,704
Gonna be all right, man.

589
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,318
The church is in mourning

590
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,854
Mourning

591
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,287
Glory to God

592
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,554
The church is in mourning

593
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:43,719
Mourning

594
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,525
Oh, yes, oh, yeah, yeah, oh

595
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:47,860
The church is in

596
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,593
Mourning

597
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,135
Mourning

598
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,760
Good God almighty

599
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,068
Another soldier

600
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,133
A true born soldier

601
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,008
Has gone...

602
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,139
Gone home

603
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,410
Hallelujah!

604
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,076
Well, we're here today

605
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,485
For the home-going

606
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,487
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

607
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,114
And the celebration
of a wonderful woman

608
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,251
Aunt Sally

609
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,227
Everybody loved Aunt Sally

610
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,823
She took the young people

611
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,097
And carried them under her wings

612
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,604
And she cared for the elderly

613
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:31,403
I just want to say, listen

614
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,912
We might not have this chance

615
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,037
Sleep on, Aunt Sally

616
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,174
Sleep on, Aunt Sally

617
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,081
And take your rest

618
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,143
We loved you, Aunt Sally

619
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,155
But God loves you best

620
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,652
If you see my mother there

621
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,595
Tell my mama I'm on my way

622
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,825
I'm on my way

623
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,630
Our hearts are in mourning

624
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,641
Mourning

625
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,506
Glory to God

626
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,445
Yes, to lift our hearts
in mourning

627
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,448
Mourning

628
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,881
Good God almighty

629
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,851
Good God almighty

630
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,786
Yes, to lift our hearts
in mourning

631
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,323
Soldier

632
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,881
Another soldier

633
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,155
A true born soldier

634
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,493
A Holy Ghost soldier

635
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,623
A heaven-bound soldier

636
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,160
Has...

637
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,535
Gone

638
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,904
Gone, gone

639
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,272
Gone

640
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,573
Gone on home

641
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,408
Gone home

642
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,209
Hallelujah!

643
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,807
Hallelujah!

644
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,910
Hallelujah!

645
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,418
Hallelujah!

646
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,955
Hallelujah!

647
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,084
Hallelujah!

648
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,252
Hallelujah!

649
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,919
Yeah...

650
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,258
Hallelujah!

651
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,131
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah...

652
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,074
Let the church say amen.

653
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,270
Amen!

654
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,903
Let the church say amen.

655
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,038
Amen!

656
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,446
- Yes, Lord...
- Amen.

657
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,505
Yes, Lord!

658
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,951
Yes, yes, yes.
Well, well, well.

659
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,718
At this time,

660
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,224
we'd like to give

661
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,420
some of Sally's
family and loved ones

662
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,190
an opportunity
to come up here

663
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,288
and say how much
she meant to them.

664
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,061
And it's only fitting
to start with the person

665
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,433
that came the farthest way
to be here.

666
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,967
That's her great-nephew, Darrin.

667
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,132
All right, Darrin, all right.

668
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,541
Oh, yeah, brother Darrin.

669
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,737
Yes, my brother.

670
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,110
Come on.

671
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,153
Oh, yeah. Amen.

672
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,620
Hi.

673
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,497
Many of you don't remember me.

674
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,092
The one that had the phone.

675
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,297
Yeah. But before that,

676
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,739
I was Aunt Sally's
favorite nephew.

677
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,936
Hmm!

678
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,445
I thought we'd see forever,

679
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,813
but forever's gone away.

680
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,946
And it's so hard
to say good-bye

681
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,352
to yesterday.

682
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,651
Boyz II Men.

683
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,454
I got one amen.
Can I get another?

684
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,825
Amen.

685
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:43,630
My mom passed away
a few years ago

686
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,566
in a hit-and-run accident

687
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,764
when I was still a teenager,

688
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,636
and it's the talks
I had with her

689
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,301
I cherish more than anything.

690
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:58,145
I remember her telling me...

691
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,811
that it was Aunt Sally
who took us in

692
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:07,620
when I was just a baby,
after my father died in Vietnam.

693
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,483
I'll always love her for that.

694
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,394
Your mama dead, too?

695
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,432
He just said it.

696
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,636
Young man,

697
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,835
I'm so glad that you came
for your aunt's funeral.

698
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,842
Yeah.

699
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:27,935
She was always telling us

700
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,844
how well you were doing
up in New York.

701
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,644
With your important job.

702
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,549
What was it?

703
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,212
What was what?

704
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,653
Your job.

705
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,214
It's funny, she never mentioned
what it was.

706
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,260
Boy, I haven't seen you

707
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,558
since you were knee-high
to a grasshopper.

708
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,862
Reverend, um, have you seen
this very pretty lady...

709
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,060
I think her name is Lilly?

710
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,363
She ain't no lady.

711
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,904
Oh, now, Mother Cooley.

712
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,100
All sinners are welcome
in the house of the Lord.

713
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,642
Sinner? She's a sinner?

714
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,007
What kind of sinner?

715
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,842
Unrepentant.

716
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,142
Really.

717
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,546
Well, Darrin, I just come

718
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,084
to offer you my condolences
and to just let you know

719
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,121
that to be absent from the body
is to be present with the Lord.

720
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,022
You got to understand
that she's in

721
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,616
a far better place, okay?

722
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,456
Yes, ma'am.

723
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,927
You know, I got to tell you,

724
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,554
you and that choir...
boy, you're pretty good.

725
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,157
Pretty good? Huh.

726
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,638
And to my neighbor
and best friend, Faye,

727
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,643
I leave all my favorite recipes.

728
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,269
Thank you, Sally.

729
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,143
Now, Faye, depending

730
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,239
on what I die from,

731
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,615
you might want to divide
the Crisco measurements by half.

732
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,551
Don't change
that Chicken Supreme.

733
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,253
And to Paulina Pritchett,

734
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,794
I leave my collection
of church hats

735
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,057
that she always
complimented me on.

736
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,497
She should really enjoy
wearing them,

737
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,535
unless, of course, she was lying
to me all those years

738
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,798
but criticizing my taste
behind my back.

739
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,873
I'll wear them every Sunday.

740
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:13,613
And now,
for my only surviving relative,

741
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:16,482
my great-nephew, Darrin.

742
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,819
To Darrin, I leave the box

743
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,916
containing the letters
his mother sent me

744
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,459
after they left Monte Carlo.

745
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,052
I also pass on to him

746
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,098
the charge of returning
to Monte Carlo

747
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,293
to continue the family tradition

748
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,599
of... directing
the Beulah Baptist Church Choir.

749
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,468
- No!
- No.

750
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,509
I-lt's her dying wish.

751
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,840
I was next in line

752
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,072
to get the choir.

753
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,114
I been waiting years
for Sally to die.

754
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,451
God rest her soul.

755
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,782
Listen, lady, you can have it.

756
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,449
I'm not staying, let alone
leading some small-town choir.

757
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,515
Good.

758
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,153
O-On the condition that Darrin
gets the choir accepted

759
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,459
into the annual Gospel Explosion
in Columbus,

760
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,557
and performs there,
I also leave him

761
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,159
my entire stock
in Georgia Telecom,

762
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,102
currently worth $150,000.

763
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,665
I was just kidding
about that small-town stuff.

764
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,573
And the church bus.

765
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,702
How much that worth?

766
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,371
No way! Mm-mmm!

767
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,176
I don't care
what Sally's dying wish was.

768
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,479
We all know she was losing it
these last few years.

769
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,416
Besides, Paul,

770
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,512
it's your church,
and you have final say

771
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,817
over who leads
the choir.

772
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,879
It's in the bylaws.

773
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,290
Well, I guess
that would seem kind of odd

774
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,920
to have someone
with no musical experience

775
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,087
leading the choir.

776
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,861
No, no, I have plenty
of musical experience.

777
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,334
Now, you all
don't know this,

778
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,429
and I didn't tell
anyone, but, um...

779
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,567
I'm a music producer.

780
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,769
Oh.

781
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,607
Yeah, that's what
I do for a living.

782
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,079
Ooh, looks like Sally
might have been onto something.

783
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,709
W-W-W-What kind
of producing have you done?

784
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,344
Well, I've worked with, uh...
P. Diddy.

785
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,583
Dre, Dark Child...
all of them.

786
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,249
- Who that?
- That's the gangsta stuff

787
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,418
that's polluting
my grandson's mind.

788
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,791
I was the one that put an end

789
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,092
to that whole East Coast
versus West Coast thing.

790
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,759
Yeah, I just sat them all down
and made them watch <i>Roots.</i>

791
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,394
I think
I read about that.

792
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,802
So, what
is this Gospel Explosion?

793
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,772
Oh, it's the annual event

794
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,570
where choirs
from all over the southeast

795
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,803
come to Columbus, Georgia,

796
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,573
to compete for the best
gospel performance

797
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,012
and a $10,000 cash prize.

798
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,541
Yeah, a prize that could pay

799
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,280
for some much-needed
church repairs...

800
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,054
...if a certain musical producer

801
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,592
would bring it home, yes?

802
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,890
Paul Lewis, have you lost
your natural mind?

803
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,190
I wish Mama was alive

804
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,595
to see how you turn
on family like this.

805
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,497
Sally was as close to family
as anybody can get,

806
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,126
and I intend
on honoring her dying wish.

807
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,433
Now, Darrin,
the choir is yours.

808
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,938
You have six weeks

809
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,506
until the Gospel Explosion.

810
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:51,803
Whatever you need,

811
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,844
we're at your disposal.

812
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,876
But you're going to have to talk

813
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,010
to the church treasurer
about logistics.

814
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,759
Let me guess.

815
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,356
You're the treasurer.

816
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:20,632
Yes. Everything you need
is at my disposal.

817
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,503
Great.

818
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,510
Take it easy.

819
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,011
Oh, oh, uh, Paulina,

820
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,514
can I get a ride
back to my room?

821
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,035
Oh, Darrin.

822
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,071
Since you're going to be here

823
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:54,934
for longer than I thought,

824
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,939
let me give you
the extended stay rates.

825
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,202
Great.

826
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,209
There's an extra charge

827
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,870
of $1.50 for every
bar of soap you use,

828
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,880
from now on,
$2.00

829
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,540
for any clean towel you require,

830
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,481
and $1.00 a minute
for all calls made.

831
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,076
You get one
free 9-1-1 call.

832
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:13,146
I suggest you use it wisely.

833
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,425
Air conditioning?

834
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,895
You're charging me
for air conditioning?

835
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,931
It gets 100 degrees at night.

836
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,094
What is that?

837
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,069
It's a Monte Cristo.

838
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,196
It's a cigar.

839
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,330
Obviously.

840
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:29,896
Cuban?

841
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,167
Of course.

842
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,869
Cool.

843
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,510
Hey!

844
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,707
That-That cost me $20.

845
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,216
This is a no-smoking house.

846
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,876
It's a no-smoking,

847
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,750
no drinking, no fornicating,
no point of living at all house.

848
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,056
Why are we here?

849
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,186
You'll see.

850
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,322
A little Southern delight.

851
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,796
Now the honeys in here,
they make them girls in Atlanta

852
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,862
Iook like somebody hit them in
the face with a sack of nickels.

853
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,168
And I don't mean that
in a sexy way.

854
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,200
There she is.

855
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,780
You're on your own.

856
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,510
I see somebody
that owes me some money.

857
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,017
Hey man, don't run away from me.

858
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,678
Man, I told you
I was going to get...

859
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,346
- Ooh, hi, sexy.
- Hey, baby.

860
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:29,896
Oh...

861
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:36,167
You give me fever...

862
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,903
Fever... oh...

863
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,645
Oh...

864
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,549
You give me fever

865
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,608
Fever in the morning

866
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,087
Fever when
it's late at night

867
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,317
You give me fever

868
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,450
Fever

869
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,925
Fever when you kiss me

870
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,224
Fever when
you hold me tight

871
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,820
You give me fever

872
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,887
Fever

873
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,194
Fever when you're with me

874
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,360
Fever when you love...

875
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:09,202
He's so sweet

876
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,538
He's so good to me

877
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,738
He's so intelligent

878
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:19,249
He's so confident

879
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,547
Baby, so damn sexy

880
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,214
Baby, put the fever on me

881
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:32,422
Give me a fever... oh...

882
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,573
Never know how much I love you

883
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,973
Never know
how much I care

884
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,802
When you put
your arms around me

885
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,508
I get the fever
that's so hard to bear

886
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,914
You give me fever

887
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,611
Fever

888
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:56,983
When you kiss me

889
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,181
And fever when
you hold me tight

890
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,655
You give me fever

891
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,589
Fever

892
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,684
In the morning

893
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,252
And fever
all through the night

894
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,026
Baby's so damn sexy

895
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:12,933
But baby
put the fever on me, uh-uh

896
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,801
Baby knows just what to do

897
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,933
Got me boiling past 102

898
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,910
Give me a fever

899
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:26,780
Ooh...

900
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,582
Everybody's got a fever

901
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,487
That is something
you all know

902
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:37,323
Fever isn't such a new thing

903
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,329
Fever started long ago

904
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:43,059
Romeo loved Juliet

905
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,728
And Juliet felt the same

906
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,830
When he puts
his arms around her

907
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,501
He said, "Julie, baby,
you're my flame"

908
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,568
Give me fever

909
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:56,977
When we kisseth

910
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:00,379
Fever with a flame in you

911
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,420
Fever... I'm on fire

912
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:06,923
Fever, yeah,
I burn and soothe

913
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,185
Now that you listened
to my story

914
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,458
Here's a point
that I have made

915
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,329
Chicks were born
to give you fever

916
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,096
Being Fahrenheit
or Centigrade

917
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:22,332
They give you fever

918
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,703
When you kiss them

919
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,368
And fever
if you live and learn

920
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:29,537
Fever, until you sizzle

921
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:33,242
What a lovely way to burn

922
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,684
What a lovely way to burn

923
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,951
What a lovely way to burn

924
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,653
What a lovely way to burn...

925
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,161
What a lovely way to burn

926
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,495
What a lovely way to...

927
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:54,266
Burn...

928
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,301
Fever.

929
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,545
Whoo!

930
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,690
Tea with honey.

931
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,918
Here you go, Lilly.

932
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,187
Thank you.

933
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,459
You really know how
to connect with your audience.

934
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:22,499
That was hot.

935
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,295
It's a part of my act.

936
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,495
I pick out the guy
who's drooling the most,

937
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,594
and I make him sweat.

938
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,330
Well, it worked.

939
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,238
Can I buy you a real drink?

940
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,241
I'm Darrin.

941
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,643
You really don't remember me?

942
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,375
That Lilly?

943
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,508
You kept asking me
to be your girlfriend.

944
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,211
And you kept saying no.

945
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,584
Yeah, I was determined to be
Mrs. Michael Jackson.

946
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:46,621
And how's that going?

947
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,918
Ah, turns out
I'm not his type.

948
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,722
I can't believe you
remember that stuff.

949
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,319
I left town when you
were what, five?

950
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,329
Four.

951
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,229
Man, we heard about you
all the time.

952
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,700
Every week in choir rehearsal,
Sally would tell

953
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,031
us poor country folk
how well you

954
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,662
and your mama were
doing in slick city.

955
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,900
She was very special
to all of us.

956
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,032
Yeah.

957
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,669
When I talked to her
on the phone,

958
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,076
just before she passed,

959
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,081
she kept saying that
she wanted me to come back

960
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,242
and be with her
friends, like you.

961
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,309
You spoke with Sally that day?

962
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,479
Oh, yeah.

963
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,545
She went on and on.

964
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:22,683
I suppose she hung up
the phone and, uh...

965
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,533
And her dying wish
was for us to hook up?

966
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,596
God love her.

967
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,139
Sally was in a coma
two weeks before she died.

968
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,906
That's right.

969
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,447
It was...

970
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,948
must have been a couple
of weeks ago...

971
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:46,948
Right.

972
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:47,949
Anyway, I'm back

973
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,815
amongst all you
wonderful people

974
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,878
who need consoling
as much as I do.

975
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,320
How long are you in town?

976
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,755
Just tonight.

977
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,588
Hey, how about being
my girlfriend,

978
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,150
for old times' sake?

979
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,991
I've got a man.

980
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,156
Oh.

981
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,892
Dean is big and strong

982
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,160
and has a real big
jealous streak.

983
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:08,898
Sometimes he watches
from the back.

984
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,566
Excuse me,
I got a show to do.

985
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,041
Uh, okay.

986
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,509
Hey, knock 'em dead.

987
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,478
Your act is terrific.

988
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,947
Yours needs a lot of work.

989
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,348
I know I missed your call, Rosa,

990
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,752
but this is the only place
I get a signal.

991
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,451
More charges came in,
more late fees.

992
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,652
You're up to 44 grand now.

993
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,492
Okay, listen, I just came
into some money, all right?

994
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,828
And I'll be able to take care of
everything in just a few weeks.

995
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,629
Just, uh, make sure they
don't know where to find me.

996
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:39,862
I'll do my best.

997
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:40,869
You're a doll.

998
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:41,836
Kick ass.

999
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,533
Sorry.

1000
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,614
Okay, when
everyone gets here,

1001
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,119
we'll begin rehearsals.

1002
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,449
I was thinking
we should just

1003
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,547
stick to that number
you did at the funeral.

1004
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:04,116
Should be good enough to get
into any gospel competition.

1005
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,027
That was Shirley Caesar, fool.

1006
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,157
She hasn't gone
to this church for years,

1007
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,326
but since she loved Sally,

1008
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,369
we let her and her choir
sing at the funeral.

1009
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,995
She's gone?

1010
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:16,130
She's gone.

1011
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,639
Well, where's our choir?

1012
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,801
You're looking at it.

1013
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,105
This is it?

1014
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,476
Six measly people.

1015
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,571
Actually just five.

1016
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,912
Um, I'm just here 'cause
my wife's family's in town.

1017
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:27,916
They're staying at my house.

1018
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,040
Too late.

1019
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,416
You're in the choir now.

1020
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:33,149
Well, actually there
are two or three others.

1021
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,088
Yeah, but they never show up.

1022
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,558
Man, this is busted.

1023
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,094
Why do I have to be here?

1024
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,322
Oh, Brother Darrin?

1025
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:42,058
When are you going to get us
our first record contract?

1026
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,327
I want to hurry up
and get a Benz.

1027
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,028
Hey, I didn't know we
were going to be famous.

1028
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,092
You know what?

1029
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,866
Definitely count me in now.

1030
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:53,308
Um... let's do, uh...
"Amazing Grace."

1031
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:56,034
Amaze...

1032
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,137
Maze...

1033
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,704
Amaze...

1034
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,773
Ah-amaze...

1035
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,820
...zing grace

1036
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:08,756
How sweet the sound

1037
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,226
That saved a wretch like me.

1038
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,887
Stop, stop, stop.

1039
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,055
Stop, please.

1040
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,529
Okay, okay, okay,
let's not panic.

1041
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,591
Um...

1042
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,904
I'm open to suggestion.

1043
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,570
Hey, when you get us
that record deal,

1044
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,840
and they do one of those
VH1 <i>Behind the Musics</i> on us,

1045
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,711
I think it's best
if we don't talk about

1046
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,114
me trying to leave the group.

1047
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,446
You know?

1048
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,043
They'll just make it look ugly.

1049
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:45,286
Everything I do
is just for you

1050
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,423
Counting every second
till we rendezvous

1051
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,364
You want
to rendezvous

1052
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:56,805
Ah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1053
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,867
Oh, baby, oh, baby

1054
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:04,174
Oh, and I want to give it
to you, baby

1055
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,875
Give it to me, baby

1056
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,679
I want to give it to you

1057
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,983
Oh, give it to me, baby

1058
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,218
Hey...

1059
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:23,859
'Cause everything I do
is just for you

1060
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,062
'Cause everything
I do is just for you

1061
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,365
All for you

1062
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,133
Come on, give me your love.

1063
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,711
Uh, hello, there.

1064
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,480
I just had
to see you again.

1065
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,180
Aren't you supposed
to be gone?

1066
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,917
Yes, but, uh,
I was feeling bad

1067
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,118
about our little
misunderstanding last night.

1068
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,820
No misunderstanding,

1069
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,523
just using Aunt Sally's memory
to hit on me.

1070
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,361
- That's low.
- Come on.

1071
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,923
Can I at least
buy you a drink?

1072
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,696
Is that Dean?

1073
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,260
No.

1074
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:04,000
Okay, you can buy me a drink.

1075
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,837
Oh, I'm sure you heard

1076
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,706
- about Aunt Sally's will.
- No.

1077
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,767
It seems she wants me

1078
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,870
to take care of
the choir down at Beulah.

1079
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,280
Why did she put you
in charge of it?

1080
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,977
I'm sorry,
that came out wrong.

1081
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,144
Oh, no, no, no.

1082
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,880
It's okay,
it was a shock to me, too.

1083
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,751
Yeah, it's a big job.

1084
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,587
That's why I've cleared my
schedule for the next six weeks,

1085
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,854
put some business deals on hold,

1086
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,520
so that I can focus
on getting the choir

1087
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:27,893
into the Gospel Explosion.

1088
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:28,896
No.

1089
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,762
I been there and done that.

1090
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,768
Look, if it's Paulina
you're worried about,

1091
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,030
I'll take care of Paulina.

1092
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,402
I'd love to see that one.

1093
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,031
I'm the choir director now.

1094
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,234
Yeah, for six weeks.

1095
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,573
Listen, if she starts getting
all Christian on you...

1096
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,612
- Christian?
- Yeah.

1097
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:43,668
She is not a Christian.

1098
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,271
My mama said hollering
in the church

1099
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,010
don't make you
any more of a Christian

1100
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,245
than standing in the garage
makes you a Cadillac.

1101
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,014
No, man, I can't let
those hypocrites

1102
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:53,215
Iook down their noses at me
just because I...

1103
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,281
Sing sexy songs for a living.

1104
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,451
Exactly.

1105
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:57,584
And just because I...

1106
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,685
Dress like that.

1107
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,457
What's wrong with
the way I dress?

1108
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,361
Oh, no, no, I'm just
finishing your sentence.

1109
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,763
I was going to say
because I...

1110
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,766
Cheat on your boyfriend

1111
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,393
with hot choir directors
from New York City?

1112
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,459
Stop...

1113
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:08,936
- Finishing your sentences?
- Look.

1114
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,267
I know your kind.

1115
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,774
You came here last night
'cause you wanted something.

1116
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,334
You came back again tonight
'cause you want something else,

1117
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,539
and tomorrow you're going
to want something else.

1118
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,742
I can smell when a man
is trying to use me,

1119
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,444
and mister, you stink.

1120
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,510
Okay, is that how
you feel about it?

1121
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:25,520
Fine.

1122
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,784
This town is full of singers.

1123
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,884
I don't need you anyway.

1124
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:37,329
And remember, everybody,
Handy's Funeral Home

1125
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,926
offers limousines
for all occasions.

1126
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:43,234
Why not get in one
while you're still living?

1127
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,639
Well, now that we done
paid the bills...

1128
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,813
Ladies and gentlemen,

1129
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,815
sitting directly
across from me,

1130
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:57,786
I have Mr. Darrin Hill
all the way from New York City.

1131
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,760
So Darrin,

1132
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,421
tell the good people
of Monte Carlo

1133
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,362
what brings you
down here with us?

1134
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,596
I'm responsible
for rebuilding the choir

1135
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,261
down at Beulah Baptist Church.

1136
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,828
In fact, I'm holding auditions
tomorrow morning,

1137
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,932
and anyone with any musical

1138
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,169
ability can come by.

1139
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,474
As long as they are,
as we say at Beulah,

1140
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,174
fully committed to God's work.

1141
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:30,948
Amazing Grace

1142
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:35,957
How sweet the sound

1143
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:42,955
That saved a wretch like me.

1144
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,965
Whoa!

1145
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,161
Forgiving my sins

1146
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,601
Baptized in the water

1147
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,104
Freed by the Holy Ghost

1148
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,833
Washed in the blood
of the lamb

1149
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,067
Forgiving my sins

1150
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:53,803
Baptized in the water

1151
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,344
Freed by the Holy Ghost

1152
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:56,743
Washed in the blood
of the lamb

1153
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:57,973
God's going
to move this place

1154
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,141
God's going to move
this place

1155
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,742
God's going to turn the world
upside down

1156
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:08,051
Auditions for the Beulah Baptist
Church Choir are still open.

1157
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,891
Applicants need not be fully
committed to God's work,

1158
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,897
but shouldn't be against it.

1159
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,935
I'm the hottest shit in
New York since Air Force Ones

1160
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,910
And from the borough that
brought you Chris and Pun

1161
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,106
Yeah, a lot of cats rhyme,
but not like some

1162
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,673
I make it hard, like breathing
with a slug in your lung

1163
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,719
Blow, blow, now you got
to deal with me

1164
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,949
Isn't she lovely?

1165
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:44,152
Isn't she wonderful?

1166
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,029
Isn't she precious?

1167
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,428
Isn't she precious?

1168
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,898
Just one minute old

1169
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,401
You got to be kidding me!

1170
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,904
I never thought
true love would bring

1171
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,271
One that's has lovely as she

1172
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,072
But isn't she lovely?

1173
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,773
Made from love.

1174
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,515
News update.

1175
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,576
Auditions for the Beulah
Baptist Church Choir,

1176
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,884
atheists may now apply.

1177
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,859
Oh, thanks for coming, Lucius.

1178
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,926
No problem.
Where to?

1179
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,471
Oh, I just need to print
up some more fliers.

1180
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,565
Paulina won't let me use
Jimmy B's printer anymore.

1181
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,166
She says it's running
up her light bill.

1182
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,405
Oh, well, you know
old folks in the south

1183
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:37,810
believe some crazy stuff.

1184
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:38,813
Tell me about it.

1185
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,871
When it's storming,

1186
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,941
she doesn't even
use the electricity.

1187
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,818
You don't play with God.

1188
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,584
Right.

1189
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,194
You don't sing, do you, Lucius?

1190
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:57,927
Do I sing? Y-Yeah.

1191
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,333
They say I sound like
a black Al Jarreau.

1192
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,531
Great, you're in the choir.

1193
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,633
Oh, whoa, wait a minute.
What'd you say?

1194
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,371
Pump your brakes.

1195
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:09,878
I'm not planning on
joining the church

1196
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,504
until I have sown my wild oats.

1197
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,482
Then I'm going to get me
a young virgin and settle down.

1198
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,075
Say no more.

1199
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,915
Besides...

1200
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,021
word's out.

1201
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,354
Paulina's bad enough,
you done pissed her off.

1202
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,915
Don't nobody want
to be a part

1203
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,324
of that mix
made in hell.

1204
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:28,023
Now the only way
I can join is...

1205
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,828
is if... is if you paying.

1206
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,562
How about the prize money?
50/50?

1207
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,869
Done deal, 50/50.

1208
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,635
Hello, are you Joseph?

1209
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:44,680
Yeah.

1210
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:45,908
Can I line you up, son?

1211
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:48,143
Actually I just came by
to post some fliers

1212
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,186
for my choir auditions,
if that's okay.

1213
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:51,481
Sure.

1214
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,749
Seeing how you're new
in these parts,

1215
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,415
it's going to be kind of hard
for you

1216
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,255
to attract people.

1217
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,726
Most folks around here,

1218
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,524
they don't trust an outsider.

1219
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,326
It was years
before I told anyone

1220
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,832
I'm not from Mississippi.

1221
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,435
I've got a guy here

1222
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:07,561
who needs his ears lowered.

1223
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,797
Hey, Lilly.

1224
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,396
Dean, my man.

1225
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,997
Come on,
I'll get the seat.

1226
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:14,336
That's Dean?

1227
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,743
He's big, strong and jealous,

1228
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,110
so watch yourself.

1229
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,705
So I see you done met

1230
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,251
the big-time music producer
from New York, huh?

1231
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,513
Music producer?

1232
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,019
Lilly has the best

1233
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,020
voice in town.

1234
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,078
I know.

1235
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,682
You don't have to wait with me.

1236
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,818
No one else's mom
waits for them.

1237
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,385
He'll be fine.

1238
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:36,455
Okay, I'm going to be
next door, all right?

1239
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:42,568
Dean, don't talk to strangers.

1240
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,038
Yo, big man.

1241
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:47,372
You want us to sing you
a song like we did last time?

1242
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,843
Yes, please.

1243
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,174
It'll cost you.

1244
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,646
I'll give you
a thousand money.

1245
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,445
Deal.

1246
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,783
Ooh...

1247
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,850
When I was a little boy

1248
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:06,793
When I was just a boy

1249
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,490
And the devil
would call my name

1250
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,157
When I was just a boy

1251
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,724
I'd say "Now who do,

1252
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,066
Who do you think
you're fooling?"

1253
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,470
- When I was just a boy
- I'm a consecrated boy

1254
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,906
When I was just a boy

1255
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:23,309
I'm a singer in a Sunday choir

1256
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,575
Oh, my mama loves me

1257
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,513
She loves me

1258
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:30,451
She get down on her knees
and hug me

1259
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,318
Oh, she loves me like a rock

1260
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,655
She rocks me
like the rock of ages

1261
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,661
And loves me

1262
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,789
She love me, love me,
love me, love me

1263
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,595
When I was grown
to be a man

1264
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,134
Grown to be a man

1265
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:47,931
And the devil would
call my name

1266
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,596
Grown to be a man

1267
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,833
I'd say "Now who do,

1268
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,604
Who do you think
you're fooling?"

1269
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,840
- Grown to be a man
- I'm a consummated man

1270
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,472
Grown to be a man

1271
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:03,212
I can snatch a little purity

1272
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:06,722
Oh, my mama loves me,
she loves me

1273
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,759
She get down on her knees
and hug me

1274
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,693
Like she loves me like a rock.

1275
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,554
Lilly.

1276
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,999
You know, at first I was
afraid you'd follow me here,

1277
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,695
but I actually feel a lot safer

1278
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,567
knowing you're not
in the same room with my son.

1279
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,766
And to answer
your next question, no...

1280
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:25,899
You're not married.

1281
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,840
Don't finish my sentences.

1282
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:30,209
That's why you're
a sinner.

1283
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,578
Stay far away from me.

1284
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,550
No, no...

1285
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,712
No, I'm saying, that's no
reason to treat you badly.

1286
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,119
I mean, how dare they?

1287
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,248
It's not your fault.

1288
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:42,689
Well, it's 50% your fault

1289
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,624
because it takes
two people to...

1290
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,184
Well, you know what I mean.

1291
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:48,753
No.

1292
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:51,392
I'm saying it's a pity

1293
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,333
that you don't have
a complete family,

1294
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,734
but it's still no reason...

1295
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,669
Oh, don't talk to me
about family,

1296
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,071
Mr. Didn't Call Aunt Sally
For 20 Years.

1297
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:01,840
Hi.
Hi.

1298
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:07,777
I'm sorry.

1299
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:11,287
I'm starting to see how
tough things are for you.

1300
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:12,378
Oh, yes.

1301
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,218
Boo-hoo for the poor,
black mother

1302
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,190
stuck in her hometown
without a man.

1303
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,283
Whatever shall I do?

1304
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,793
I didn't mean it that way.

1305
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,294
Excuse me, Lilly, I'm sorry,

1306
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,560
but your card
is maxed out again.

1307
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,626
I forgot to put
my paycheck in.

1308
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,905
Thank you.

1309
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,738
- Excuse me.
- Hmm-mm.

1310
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,746
Hey, try this one.

1311
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,042
Sorry, Dr. Hill,

1312
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,280
yours is declined, too.

1313
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,448
Dr. Hill? You a doctor?

1314
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,014
No, that's just my music name.

1315
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,787
You know, like Dr. John,
Dr. Dre.

1316
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,657
Try this one.

1317
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:55,930
Well, that's cleared.

1318
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,054
Of course.

1319
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,293
Sign here.

1320
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,164
Thank you.

1321
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:03,170
That was really nice.

1322
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,297
You didn't
have to do that.

1323
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,467
That's what I'm saying,
I'm a nice guy.

1324
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,170
I don't know
what the problem is.

1325
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,973
I usually get along better
with beautiful women.

1326
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,446
Okay, I'll...

1327
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,574
I'll give you a check
tomorrow, first thing.

1328
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,551
Oh, um, cash.

1329
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,109
Cash.

1330
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,182
Reverend.

1331
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:26,888
Oh... Darrin.

1332
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,294
Thanks for meeting me here.

1333
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,698
Uh, how's it going
with the choir?

1334
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:37,365
Well, I'm still having trouble
recruiting the members.

1335
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,533
Son, it's at times like these

1336
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:42,203
I suggest listening
to God's voice.

1337
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:45,042
Sorry, Rev, I'm not
into the spooky stuff.

1338
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:46,638
Oh, just open it up.

1339
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,013
And these people can sing?

1340
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,113
Oh, yes.

1341
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,888
Please don't tell my sister.

1342
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,623
Hello, everyone.

1343
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:01,891
I'd like you to welcome

1344
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,523
the new members of our choir.

1345
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,465
So when is this competition?

1346
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:06,934
In a few weeks.

1347
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,833
And our new organist.

1348
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,505
You touch my keyboard

1349
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,478
and I kick your
drunk 'bama ass.

1350
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:18,878
Oh, oh, wait, Homer.

1351
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,279
Now, if we stand any chance

1352
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,147
of getting into
the Gospel Explosion,

1353
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,049
we could use
all the help we can get.

1354
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,052
Shoot.

1355
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,213
Bringing all these drunks

1356
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,688
up into the church
with hats on

1357
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,554
and drunks and everything.

1358
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,253
Okay, everyone, please.

1359
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,659
Okay, good.

1360
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:41,466
Good. Uh...
I'd like to...

1361
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,232
I'd like to try a new song.

1362
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,967
Um... uh...

1363
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,406
Tasha?

1364
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,668
Can you, uh, get rid
of the gum, please?

1365
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:53,011
Sure.

1366
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,249
Okay.

1367
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,259
That was nasty.

1368
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:10,391
Uh..."Swing Low,
Sweet Chariot."

1369
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,299
Oh, ah, uh, Homer, please.

1370
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,199
Scooter.

1371
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:38,918
Swing low

1372
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:43,329
Sweet chariot

1373
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:49,395
Comin' for to carry me
home...

1374
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,463
Wait-wait-wait,
wait, wait, stop, stop.

1375
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,475
Stop, wait, um...
this is not working.

1376
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,635
Um...

1377
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,508
You need to pick
a lead singer.

1378
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,809
You'd know that if you knew what
you were doing.

1379
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,315
Oh, oh, could-could I maybe try?

1380
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,019
Bessie...

1381
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:07,352
would you, uh, like to try?

1382
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:10,952
No.

1383
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,922
My dear departed
husband James said

1384
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:18,524
that when I sing, it
made him think of heaven.

1385
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,967
Probably meant he wanted
to blow his brains out.

1386
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:23,639
Paulina,

1387
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:24,832
you've sung lead

1388
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,704
- before?
- I have,

1389
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,300
and it gave me great joy.

1390
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,106
Oh, good. Then it'll hurt
that much more

1391
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,306
when I find someone else.

1392
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,616
Be careful, Dean, baby,
don't hurt yourself.

1393
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:43,784
Oh, let the boy be.

1394
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,452
He's already wearing
more protection

1395
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,553
then they gave me
when I fought in the war.

1396
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,562
Oh!

1397
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:49,791
- Hey.
- Hey.

1398
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:51,959
You're the pain in the butt
from the barbershop.

1399
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,327
He must have heard
that somewhere.

1400
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,338
Hi, there, young man.

1401
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,374
I'm Lilly's grandfather.

1402
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,000
Hello, sir.

1403
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,238
I've been waiting
for a nice, strong young man

1404
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,212
to come and whisk Lilly away.

1405
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,249
Somebody did that already,
remember?

1406
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,546
She shouldn't be wasting
the next 25 years of her life

1407
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,587
taking care of no old man.

1408
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:13,519
No, she should go off

1409
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,819
and have a life of her own.

1410
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,361
Cool!

1411
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,920
Sammy Sosa.

1412
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:23,929
What do you say?

1413
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,490
He said cool.

1414
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:26,899
Dean?

1415
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,937
Thank you.

1416
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,098
Look, Granddaddy.

1417
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,369
- I got Sammy Sosa.
- Oh, okay.

1418
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:36,036
So have you changed
your mind about the choir?

1419
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,876
Why should I,
'cause you gave Dean a toy?

1420
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:42,213
No. Yes?

1421
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,954
Why is this so important to you?

1422
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:49,617
Because it's what
my Aunt Sally wanted me to do.

1423
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,626
Every time I pack my bags
to leave,

1424
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,457
I get that image
of her helping my Mom out

1425
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:54,791
when I was little...

1426
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,456
and because
it was her last wish

1427
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:57,965
to get into the Explosion,

1428
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,126
and because...

1429
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:01,227
And because
you're getting $150,000.

1430
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,864
I thought I'd finish
your sentence for you.

1431
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,874
That is the truth, right?

1432
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:13,138
Yeah. Yes.

1433
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:15,081
Thanks for being honest,

1434
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,085
but I can't.

1435
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,586
What?

1436
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:20,554
You mean, I just told the truth
for nothing?

1437
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,750
Thank you for the loan
yesterday.

1438
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:25,055
I know you want cash.

1439
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:28,722
You know, this truth stuff
is highly overrated.

1440
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:31,596
I don't care who started it.

1441
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,658
You both should be ashamed.

1442
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:37,137
Okay, let's try it
once more from the top.

1443
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:41,165
Hey. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1444
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,370
I'm not doing this for you.

1445
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:43,935
The truth is I'm doing this
for Sally.

1446
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,038
Well, thank you anyway.

1447
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:52,279
Choir, I'd like you to meet
our new soloist, Lilly.

1448
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:53,947
- What's your last name?
- Tramp.

1449
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,115
I knew this would happen.

1450
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:57,955
No-no-no, wait, wait,
wait, please, please.

1451
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:01,087
Let me handle this. Please.

1452
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,893
Have you forgotten that Jesus
loved Mary Magdalene?

1453
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:08,402
She was a ho.

1454
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:09,870
"Let him who is without sin

1455
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,634
cast the first stone."

1456
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:12,901
Thank you for handling it.

1457
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,239
No, no, no, no, no,
I-I don't mean it.

1458
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:18,542
I'm just saying it
for effect. Please.

1459
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:21,613
It is your duty

1460
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,083
to help fallen women.

1461
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:24,915
I'm willing to help.

1462
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,852
- Hi.
- I agree. It's about time

1463
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,118
we get some young Baptist booty
up in this choir.

1464
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,751
Ask her how come she has to keep
so many husbands

1465
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,260
away from their homes down

1466
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,388
at that old sin hole
she be working at.

1467
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,329
Would Aunt Sally
have been this harsh?

1468
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,867
No.

1469
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,199
No, Sally would've wanted Lilly
to stay in the choir...

1470
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,170
- Amen.
- Unlike some people.

1471
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,433
- Amen again.
- That's right.

1472
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,202
If she was a respectable woman,

1473
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,936
she would have
a respectable job.

1474
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,103
The last thing we need
is another loose woman

1475
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,578
up in the choir stand.

1476
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,274
Now she should just
go on home, take care

1477
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:54,611
of that little bastard baby...

1478
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:55,742
Leave my son out of this.

1479
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:56,807
Talk to her. Tell her.

1480
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,319
Dean is a gift from God.
