2
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,920
Okay, come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,453
Oh, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go, buddy.

4
00:00:50,478 --> 00:00:52,582
Come on. Come on.
We got to move. We got to move.

5
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:56,345
Whoa!

6
00:00:59,094 --> 00:00:59,878
Oh...!

7
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:01,966
Yes, yes, yes...
No, no, no...

8
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:03,377
Ahhh!

9
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:04,503
Aw!

10
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,533
Uh!
What!

11
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:11,617
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

12
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:14,547
Egg! Egg!
Got you.

13
00:01:17,197 --> 00:01:18,370
Ow.
Ow.

14
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:21,230
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow.

15
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:24,533
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

16
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:38,515
Beak.
Wing.

17
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,663
Tail.
Ribs.

18
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:42,440
Giblets.

19
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:49,407
I'm flying.
No, still can't fly.

20
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:53,675
Notta dodbly leees.
(Not the top of my list.)

21
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,908
Breathe.
Breathe.

22
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:01,273
Bottom feeder.

23
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,194
Up... and over.

24
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:06,262
Woo.
Huh!

25
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:10,393
Ta-da!

26
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:11,443
No, no, no...

27
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:13,802
Look, it's okay.
I'm just a clown.

28
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:16,224
Oh boy.
That's loud.

29
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:18,295
You're loud.
You're... very scared of me.

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,165
Here, come here.
No? Okay. No, never mind.

31
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,768
Uh.
Happy Hatchday.

32
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,343
Oh.
Hi, pal.

33
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:27,083
You must be so disappointed
in yourself for being this late.

34
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:28,736
Oh, no.
No. No, no, no.

35
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:30,136
I'm not late.
Look at the time.

36
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,483
See.
The order said, "Before noon."

37
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:36,197
Okay.
Now, you're late.

38
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,234
- What?
- Where have you been?

39
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,333
- It's funny you ask. I was...
- You missed the party.

40
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:41,898
- What is that?
- Oh, that.

41
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:44,342
Uh, yes.
I fell on the box.

42
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:46,828
Oh, the squirrel.
That's on us.

43
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:49,742
You know, I tried to keep my body
between the ground and the box,

44
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,532
but...
No, I think I got a little bruise.

45
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:53,284
You see anything back there?

46
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:55,354
Hear that, honey?
The clown we paid

47
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,028
to be here an hour ago,
fell on our son's hatchday cake.

48
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,704
That's why our son's hatchday
party is ruined.

49
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,827
- Oh.
- And the next time you messed up.

50
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:08,563
Don't tell me a story.
Just take responsibility.

51
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,299
Hey, man.
It wasn't a story.

52
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,785
I'm a screw up
that woke up late

53
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,359
and fell on the thing
you paid for!

54
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:17,938
It wasn't a story,
I almost drown.

55
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:22,029
Why don't we just settle this out
and say the cake's on you.

56
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:28,986
I'm sorry.
It's on me?

57
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:31,409
Well, who else will it be on?

58
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,971
Well, you know, I...

59
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:36,504
I'm not sure you're
going to like this.

60
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,860
Um...
but, since you asked.

61
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,141
Rather than being on me
as you suggested.

62
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,143
This cake...

63
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:44,899
... is on YOU!

64
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:49,092
So, you want to hear a story?

65
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,807
I run my butt off,
literally, mind you.

66
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,027
To get the "gluten free cake."

67
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:57,535
What the heck is gluten?
I mean, does gluten even exist?

68
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,488
Who are you?

69
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:01,111
- Get out of here!
- Already.

70
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:03,696
But, you're the only one
that has cake.

71
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:06,168
Oh, that's good stuff.

72
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:08,393
Anybody want to eat some cake
off their dad or husband?

73
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:11,122
Who needs plates when
you got this guy's face, right?

74
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,691
Oh, oh, oh, mm.
Oh, wait. I almost forgot.

75
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:16,175
You know, I'm suppose to do a
quick customers satisfaction survey

76
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,744
before I... weet weet split, okay.

77
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,753
So, on a scale of 1 to 3 stars,

78
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:21,042
what would you say
about my performance.

79
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,734
And don't forget,
the squirrel was...

80
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:27,913
... free

81
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:32,237
- Sorry about this.
- No!

82
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:35,878
My bad.

83
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:37,981
Huh?

84
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:48,656
Congratulations!

85
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:49,916
- Huh?
- Oh...!

86
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,831
It's a boy.

87
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,084
Hey.
Eyebrows.

88
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,268
Eyebrows.

89
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,591
- Eyebrows.
- Eyebrows.

90
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,091
- Eyebrows.
- Eyebrows.

91
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,203
Oh...

92
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,485
Hm.

93
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:13,975
Oh.

94
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:17,955
Oh.

95
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,431
Your Honor.

96
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:45,997
Our family has always practice
natural child attach,

97
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:49,846
the risk of having a scramble
infant are too great.

98
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:51,388
There is going to be music

99
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:55,253
The nest was going to be full
of beautiful fresh cut flowers.

100
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:58,749
And the first 2 faces
he was going to see

101
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:03,405
were the loving faces of his
mother and his father.

102
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:07,652
We can never get that moment back.

103
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,016
Ma'am, I never wanted my face
to the first face your the baby saw.

104
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,862
What are we talking about here.
He probably doesn't even remember me.

105
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,187
Daddy!

106
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:19,002
No, no, no. No.
Shhh, shut up.

107
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:21,555
Shut up.
Cool it!

108
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:25,696
Ladies and gentlemen.
Am I a passionate bird?

109
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:28,089
Yes.
Guilty as can be.

110
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,378
It was a quality cake.

111
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:34,410
Look, I worked very hard
to get it there, on time.

112
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:38,254
And he wouldn't even try it.

113
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,479
Mr. Red.

114
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:46,072
We are a happy happy bird community.
Under the protection of Mighty Eagle

115
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:49,416
We work, we play, we laugh.

116
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,441
We love and we live our lives
free from conflict and strife, sir.

117
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:56,040
We love the sound of our
own voice too, evidently.

118
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:59,491
Perhaps you've never heard the joke,
"Why don't birds fly?"

119
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:00,938
I'm going to tell you why.

120
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:04,370
Because, where else
would we ever want to go?

121
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,400
- Wow. Not a good joke.
- It kills me every time, guys.

122
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:11,535
So now, what am I
to make of the likes of you.

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,990
There seems to be
a recurring issue here.

124
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:16,569
Anger.

125
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:19,181
I don't think I have an anger issue,
I think you got an anger issue.

126
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,764
- Oh.
- Oh.

127
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:22,689
Anger...

128
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:26,960
is a weed growing in our garden.

129
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:30,406
And what do you do
when you find a weed?

130
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,608
I don't know.
But I bet you're going to tell me.

131
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:34,601
You pluck it out!

132
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,439
Oh my gosh.

133
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,901
Mr. Red.

134
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:40,481
When you moved your house
outside of our village,

135
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:43,681
did you notice that
nobody try to stop you?

136
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:46,496
Birds, they may smile
at you on the street

137
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:50,458
but, that doesn't mean
they like you.

138
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,226
Mm-Hm.

139
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:54,013
Hey, you know what?
I got a question for you.

140
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:57,869
Are you aware that, that robe
you're wearing isn't fooling anybody?

141
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:01,927
We all see you prancing
along the street, your Honor.

142
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:04,367
And, you're what?
And I'm just approximating here.

143
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:05,795
Like an inch tall!

144
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,098
You...
What are you doing?

145
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:09,588
- Viola.
- Ah-choo!

146
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,939
- What the?
- Daddy.

147
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:16,265
Mr. Red, given the
severity of the crimes,

148
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,877
I have no choice but to
impose the maximum penalty

149
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:23,375
allowed by the law.

150
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,721
Anger management class.

151
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,748
Aw.
Pluck my life.

152
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,713
- Fresh worms, caught today.
- Huh?

153
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:34,984
Hey, Red.
How are you?

154
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,253
Oh, I'm horrible.

155
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,560
Oh. Hi, Red.
It's good to see you.

156
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:40,642
I wish I could
say the same.

157
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:43,439
- Ups-a-daisy
- Aw! Ow.

158
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:44,895
Thank you.

159
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,018
Huh?

160
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:49,400
- Huh?
- Nm-mm.

161
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,677
- Let's go.
- Oh.

162
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:54,314
How are you, Suzie?
You good?

163
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,516
No running.
No running.

164
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:58,750
- Oop.
- Come on.

165
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:02,462
Hey.
How's that nap schedule coming along?

166
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:03,865
Oh boy.

167
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,346
Y'guys ever thought about bird control.

168
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:10,296
Left, right, left, right,
there you go.

169
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:16,240
Hi.
Hi.

170
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:24,663
Alright.
Oop!

171
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:27,216
Girlie. Girlie.
You got this.

172
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,778
We don't want you to fall now,
take your time.

173
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,996
Here we go.
That's it.

174
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:36,414
Oh, you're doing it.

175
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,859
- Seriously?
- I'm almost there.

176
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:45,154
<font color="#379bff">(HUG TRADER)</font>
- Nope.

180
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,790
Chicken pose.

181
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:04,255
Crane pose.

182
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,570
Wow.

183
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:12,252
Mighty Might Eagle soaring free.
Defender of our homes and liberty.

184
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:14,956
Hi, Red.
Is one of those yours?

185
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:16,122
What?

186
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:18,190
Yeah.
When birds fly.

187
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:21,037
Mighty Eagle is a legend.

188
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,109
You think that's funny.
Ha ha ha. This is funny.

189
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,487
Oh oh.

190
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:31,233
What?

191
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:52,946
Don't look, Bobby.

192
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,331
The anger might be contagious.

193
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,062
Let's go.

194
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:58,702
He started it.

195
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:02,769
There you go.

196
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,738
Ah-hah.

197
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,880
Oh, look at this.
This is going to be awful.

198
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,020
Okay, I guess that's art.

199
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:25,478
That's garbage.

200
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:29,484
And that's,
exotic.

201
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,290
- Free rage what?
- Oh, hi.

202
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:35,761
- Hi, there. Welcome...
- Hello.

203
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:37,977
... to the Infinity Acceptance Group.

204
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,548
- I, am Matilda.
- Okay.

205
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:44,038
And I'm just super psych to be
taking this journey with you

206
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,363
Oh.
You're gonna have a blast!

207
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:50,013
I'm really fun.
Everybody says that about me.

208
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:52,965
Hey, guys.
Say hello to Red, everyone.

209
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,495
Hello.

210
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,879
Hi, Red.

211
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:57,956
Hello, birds I won't
get to know well.

212
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:00,493
Hey, apparently somebody didn't get
the memo that we like to start on time.

213
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:02,461
Because you're about 2 minutes late,
don't let it happen again.

214
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:04,620
Hi, my name is Chuck. I'm sorry
we got off on the wrong foot.

215
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,456
I like you a lot.
I can tell.

216
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,187
Okay.
Now, Red.

217
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:11,474
Would you like to share
your story with us?

218
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:12,599
No.
Not really.

219
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:15,741
Well, the court mentioned
something about a rage episode

220
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:18,292
at a child's birthday party.

221
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,219
How long is this class anyway?

222
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:22,618
As long as you make it.

223
00:14:22,643 --> 00:14:24,120
Really?
Oh, okay.

224
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,324
Uh, gentlemen,
very nice to see you.

225
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,199
And uh, almost meet you.

226
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:30,040
Probably the nicest part of it
is not getting to meet you.

227
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:31,225
You know,
in some weird away.

228
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,451
Alright.
So, I'm gonna go ahead and...

229
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:37,545
scoot on back out, past
those creepy statues and...

230
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,225
HAH!
Back you go.

231
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,140
Sure. No, I can...
take a seat.

232
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:43,408
So, in another sense,

233
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:46,386
you are here until I
notify the court

234
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:49,946
that your anger issues
have been resolved.

235
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,623
Oh boy.

236
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:54,157
Chuck!
Share your story with Red.

237
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:56,375
Me? I'm the last guy
that should be here.

238
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,714
Simple speeding ticket.

239
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:58,991
Judge tells me
I was going too fast,

240
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:01,652
So I say, "Your Honor.
To be honest. I was"

241
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,837
You caught me.
I'm not angry. I'm honest.

242
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,324
So, shouldn't I be in an
honesty management class?

243
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:08,791
'Cause we got to
manage my honesty.

244
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:09,995
Mmf-hmm.

245
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,772
My one problem,

246
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:14,886
that's a different story
than you told last time.

247
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:16,578
Uh-uh...

248
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:40,507
<font color="#ff9933">Officer
Bill Beakins</font>

249
00:15:40,532 --> 00:15:42,875
Drinks on me, guys!

250
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:51,758
Chuck...

251
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,806
Okay.
Maybe, it wasn't ice cream.

252
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:55,698
Alright, Chuck.
Thanks, we got it.

253
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:59,305
And this is Terence.

254
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:02,218
Woof.
More like, terrifying

255
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:05,533
No.
It says here in the little filey.

256
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,836
Terence uh, seems to have an
incident.

257
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:26,219
Now, Bomb's started
with us 2 weeks ago

258
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:29,201
Tell us your story, Bomb.

259
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:32,415
Okay.
Well, sometimes when I get upset,

260
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,454
I... have been known to...
blow up.

261
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,954
So, like uh. Like what?
Like you get mad, you mean.

262
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:42,972
Well. No.
I literally blow up, okay.

263
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:46,256
I explode like a bomb.

264
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,350
Hence the name.

265
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:57,080
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

266
00:17:00,848 --> 00:17:03,091
Excuse me.
Party foul.

267
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:04,280
Ow!

268
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,273
- Do it!
- No can do.

269
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:09,987
I just went boom-boom
before class.

270
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,331
Hey, look.
I don't want to be here and all,

271
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:13,613
but this can maybe make it
a little more interesting to me.

272
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,340
So.
Please, explode.

273
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,442
- You can't do it, can you?
- Yes, I can.

274
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,777
But, I'm having back issues today,
so...

275
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:22,219
I'm gonna have to
take a rain check.

276
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:23,607
Oh...
Do it!

277
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:25,359
This is not the time
or place, little amigo.

278
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,885
These guys are all nuts,
huh, big man?

279
00:17:30,244 --> 00:17:33,462
Are we speaking telepathically
or you're just...

280
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:36,704
Good talk.

281
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,318
Nice chatting with you.

282
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,067
Managing our anger
through movement.

283
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:49,139
The first pose is
the dancer pose.

284
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:51,027
Great form, Terence.

285
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:53,138
Eagle. Parrot.
Peacock? Warrior.

286
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:55,236
Mountain. Tree. Rabbit.
Fish. Locust. King pigeon.

287
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:57,639
And of course, downward duck.

288
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,193
- Excuse me, boring heavy lady.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:02,838
Looks like the exploding
guy's gonna puke.

290
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:04,639
And have you done this before?

291
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:07,274
Uh, yes, I have.
But, usually not for free.

292
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:08,547
- Didn't think so.
- Awesome.

293
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:10,123
And how are we doing over here, Bomb?

294
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:13,039
Doing wonderful.
Stretching out the core.

295
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:16,549
Just remember to breathe,
up to your feathers,

296
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:20,818
and from your talons.

297
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:22,239
Bomb?

298
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,268
Nice.

299
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,493
I don't know what happened

300
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:33,557
I was doing the poses.
I was feeling all zen.

301
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:35,348
Matilda was digging it!

302
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:36,846
Then I lost my grip on it.

303
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:39,058
I let it slipped and
it just squeaked out.

304
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,356
Hey.
So, where are we going?

305
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:41,894
I'm sorry.
We?

306
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,931
Yes, we

307
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,388
There's a new happiness exhibit
at the Museum of Happiness

308
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:48,155
that I'm dying to see.

309
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:50,580
Uh, you know what?
I... I mean I got a...

310
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:52,491
- I got a thing.
- A thing?

311
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:53,778
Like a disease?

312
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,709
Huh! Is it bird flu?
Chicken pox?

313
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,051
Huh!
Cardinal sin?

314
00:18:57,076 --> 00:19:02,532
No. By thing, I mean like...
desire not to hang out, with you.

315
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:03,900
Oh.

316
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,778
Oh, yeah. Well, may... you know.
Maybe for the best, you know.

317
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:08,451
Because... I got something too.

318
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:10,359
Ha!
How did I forget?

319
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:13,948
Even if you'd say yes,
I probably couldn't have gone.

320
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:19,787
I'm busy too,
I have a...

321
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:23,351
Business offer... deal
that is...

322
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:25,264
No, Bomb.
You're not good at this, buddy.

323
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,073
It's-It's charming up to a point
and now it's just sad.

324
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,991
It's a guy I know.

325
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:38,865
And he's opening up a brand new
luxury class reunion.

326
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,329
Okay, good.
Good, good, good.

327
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:45,513
Looks like it's just us.
Want to go get a bite?

328
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:49,409
Oh, but what about your class reunion,
where everybody brings a business offer.

329
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:53,377
Oh. No, no, no.
Chuck, I was lying.

330
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,466
 I'm sorry if I've fooled you.

331
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:02,487
Nah-uh.
No means no.

332
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:06,111
I love your eye.

333
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,794
Cheers.

334
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,472
- Hey!
- Huh?

335
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:14,137
- Get over here!
- Hey, pecker heads.

336
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:15,171
- What's up?
- Yo.

337
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:16,459
Hey, man.

338
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,931
Oh.

339
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:23,939
Oh.

340
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:26,272
- Oh, I felt a peck.
- Whoa.

341
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:37,883
Ah...

342
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:47,341
This is the legendary Mighty Eagle.

343
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:52,268
Our protector and hero, but
no one has seen him for years.

344
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,174
Mighty Eagle is missing.

345
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,538
When's Mighty Eagle
going to come back.

346
00:20:57,563 --> 00:20:59,828
Eyebrows, didn't your parents
ever tell you,

347
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:01,533
Mighty Eagle isn't real?

348
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,687
Shhh. He doesn't know that.
He doesn't have parents.

349
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:09,064
- He does not have parents.
- Yeah, or even friends.

350
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:59,724
Ah ha!
Eureka!

351
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:05,262
Say bye to daddy.

352
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:06,594
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

353
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,284
- Goodbye, hatchlings.
 - Bye!

354
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,329
- Have a happy day.
- Bye.

355
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:13,256
- Good morning.
- Morning, your Honor.

356
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:15,705
Here you go.

357
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:18,115
- Ah-Choo!
- Bless you.

358
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,005
- Yes!
- Bye, daddy's making dinner.

359
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,169
If my name were Bobby,
would you ask about my hobbies.

360
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:33,330
- Wow
- Or if my name were Judas,

361
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:36,038
would you ask me
what my mood is?

362
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,675
I laugh, I cry,
I love, I hate.

363
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,494
I do so much more
than detonate.

364
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,140
Think of it

365
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:48,765
That was beautiful.

366
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,510
You're gonna make me cry.

367
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,198
Yeah, that was some real
clever symbolism.

368
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:56,035
Ah! Red, why don't
we hear you poem?

369
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,204
I don't have a poem.

370
00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:58,835
Uh-huh.
Why not?

371
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,569
Because I didn't write one.

372
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:04,866
Right, uh-huh.
And, is there a reason?

373
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:06,292
Well. You know,
I was gonna do it,

374
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,891
but then I thought about it.

375
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,922
and I realized,
"Oh, this is a huge waste of my time."

376
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:12,611
So I didn't do it.

377
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:16,472
Deep breath. Deep breath.
DEEP BREATH!

378
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:19,769
And we're back in the now.
Chuck!

379
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:22,913
- You had your hand up the whole time.
- Um-Hm.

380
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:27,090
My poem,
is about a hate crimes

381
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,564
- How did it...?
- Oh oh.

382
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:32,840
Oh no.

383
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:35,066
A lot of sickos out there.
A lot of sickos.

384
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:39,611
What? Oh, what
did I make you of?

385
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:41,346
- I made you out of love.
- Wow.

386
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:44,799
But, wait. Too late.
Now I see your fate.

387
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:50,074
Some very troubled somebody
destroyed you out of hate.

388
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:57,864
What could have made him so despise
your happy smile, your laughing eyes.

389
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:01,259
Your soul was pure.
Your heart was true.

390
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:06,063
And someone hated that.
But, who?

391
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,522
Oh!

392
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,484
Terence.

393
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:16,840
Whoa!
<font color="#ff8080">[ HANG IN THERE ]</font>

394
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:19,156
Yeah, I deserve that.
Oh.

395
00:24:19,181 --> 00:24:23,137
Billy has passed
to a high plane of existence.?

396
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,753
Everyone join wings.

397
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:28,377
Let us,
all say our goodbyes.

398
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:30,424
Yeah. Let me get in here,
I got to say goodbye...

399
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:31,740
Okay.

400
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:35,392
Okay. You know, I'll just mourn
from back here, that's fine.

401
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,813
You know, if there is one thing
Billy always hated was goodbyes.

402
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:40,375
- Hey. What's going on there?
- Huh?

403
00:24:41,332 --> 00:24:42,928
Class dismiss.

404
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:45,792
Very moving.

405
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,172
Come on, everybody.
Let's go!

406
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:48,711
Hey.
Where's everybody going?

407
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:50,282
Hurry, something's coming!

408
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:52,942
- Last one to the beach is a rotten egg!
- Let's go.

409
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:55,132
Coming through. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

410
00:24:58,037 --> 00:24:59,356
What?

411
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:04,759
Aw.
Again?

412
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:06,729
Let's get down to the beach!

413
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:09,311
- Follow me.
- Let's get down to the beach.

414
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,293
What?

415
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,385
Huh?

416
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,831
I didn't mean to photo bomb you,
sorry about it

417
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:24,970
What is that thing?

418
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:29,149
It looks like an UFO.
An unidentified floating object.

419
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:30,770
Daddy!

420
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,592
Stop it.
No, I'm not your daddy.

421
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:35,768
- What is that?
- Look at the size of that thing.

422
00:25:35,793 --> 00:25:37,100
Where is it going?

423
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:39,537
I don't know,
but it's not stopping.

424
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:44,858
My house.
My house.

425
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:47,837
Slow down!
Stop!

426
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:55,940
Oh.

427
00:25:58,652 --> 00:26:00,135
Phew.

428
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:04,794
What the?

429
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:10,263
That house took me
5 years to build.

430
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:11,353
Wow.

431
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:15,803
It's such a shame when you create
something and someone just destroys it.

432
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:19,506
Ladies and gentlemen.

433
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:22,702
- We have a very special guest for you.
- Huh?

434
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:25,541
- He's a green marine sailing machine.
- Here we go.

435
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:28,588
And he's king, to let you know,
he's not mean.

436
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:33,680
Put your wings together for
Leonard!

437
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:36,900
Oh.
Thank you very much.

438
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:39,550
Please hold your applause.

439
00:26:39,575 --> 00:26:45,307
Greetings from my world,
the world of the pigs.

440
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:47,071
What's a pig?

441
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:50,147
I am a pig!

442
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:57,253
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

443
00:26:58,337 --> 00:27:01,107
Oh, where're we going?
Wrong way.

444
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:03,251
Oopsie.
Not working.

445
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:05,600
We practiced this a hundred times.

446
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,244
- Oh, man.
- Give it to me.

447
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:09,254
- Oh.
- We're gonna come in again.

448
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,896
I'm so sorry.

449
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:17,198
My name is Leonard,
but my friends call me Chuckles.

450
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:19,584
- Oh, ho ho ho! Very generous.
- Yeah.

451
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:20,597
- Thank y...
- Oh.

452
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:22,671
- We mean no harm.
- Aw. Ow.

453
00:27:22,696 --> 00:27:26,724
We saw your island across the sea
and we thought,

454
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:28,239
"I wonder what they're up to?"

455
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:30,889
But, there's no other place
besides here.

456
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:33,990
Yes, there is.
And we are from there.

457
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:36,332
We call it, Piggy Island.

458
00:27:36,357 --> 00:27:37,672
Oh my gosh.

459
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:41,634
P-I-GG-Y Island.

460
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,139
Who else is out there?

461
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:46,395
My first officer, Ross and I
have sailed everywhere.

462
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,188
One brave soul against the sea,
and Ross.

463
00:27:50,213 --> 00:27:51,425
Ah, excuse me.

464
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,868
Have you come to smash
all of our houses or just mine?

465
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:58,291
- Oh, man.
- Ho ho. Somebody want a gift basket.

466
00:27:58,316 --> 00:28:00,900
Please. Please.
Don't be afraid.

467
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:04,469
My partner and I request
the honor of your friendship.

468
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:06,758
- Ross, show them how'd we do it.
- Oh?

469
00:28:06,783 --> 00:28:09,062
Don't worry, he's always shy.

470
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,945
- Well, I'll say now.
- Hi! Uhh!

471
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,374
Hi, friends.

472
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,146
Oh, not a hugger.

473
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:20,394
Welcome to Bird Island.

474
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:23,610
Welcome to our new friends,
the Pigs.

475
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:26,793
- Let us have a celebration!
- Put it there!

476
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:28,281
- Welcome
- Oh.

477
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,507
What?
Sorry.

478
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:30,698
And a hoof to a wing.

479
00:28:30,723 --> 00:28:34,652
We would like to honor the pig's
with a special performance.

480
00:28:37,964 --> 00:28:41,184
Oh, watch out.
Shaking my bacon.

481
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:42,479
They don't have feathers?

482
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:45,767
You know, they're just walking around
naked just presenting themselves.

483
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,638
I'm looking at all
their business here.

484
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:49,345
That part about them,
I really admire.

485
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:53,178
Now we would like to welcome
our special guest, the PIGS!

486
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:55,061
- Yay.
- Alright.

487
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:58,072
Thank you for your kindness
and hospitality.

488
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:00,846
- Our king sends his warmest regards.
- King?

489
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:06,050
You have shared with us the wonders
of your quaint simple little island.

490
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:08,219
Drop the banner, Ross!

491
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,701
Ah!
Whoa!

492
00:29:09,726 --> 00:29:14,179
Now, we would love to humbly share
some of the wonders of our world.

493
00:29:14,204 --> 00:29:16,331
Ha! Yeah.
Humble my bird butt.

494
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:17,397
Language.

495
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,207
100 years from now,
everyone will ask,

496
00:29:20,232 --> 00:29:24,357
"How do the friendship between
the pigs and the birds start?"

497
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:25,644
Who cares!

498
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:27,112
- Oh no.
- Hey.

499
00:29:27,137 --> 00:29:30,713
Well, let them say us,
"We lite up the night!"

500
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,538
Holy moley!

501
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:38,765
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!

502
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,717
Hey, look. They destroyed more of
the stuff we worked hard to build.

503
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:43,690
But, there's more!
- More?

504
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,726
Has gravity gone haywire?

505
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:50,805
No! Even better, your friends,
the pigs, proudly give you...

506
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,427
- The trampoline!
- Oh.

507
00:29:54,452 --> 00:29:55,726
Those are my assistance.

508
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:58,533
- Oinky and John Ham!
- Hello.

509
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:01,944
Hey, hold on a second. I thought there's
only suppose to be 2 of these guys.

510
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:06,149
What goes?
Look at those jiggly pigglies!

511
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:10,247
But, that's not all, throwing things
just got a whole lot easier.

512
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:12,215
Say hello to...

513
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:15,148
- "The Slingshot!"
- Ta-da!

514
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,311
- I can't see.
- This is crazy.

515
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:17,868
Wow!

516
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:20,000
- Tired of carrying things from place to place?
- Yeah!

517
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:21,766
Wish you could just get it there?

518
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:22,836
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

519
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:24,511
Well, now you can!

520
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:25,953
- Waiters, do me a favor.
- Huh!

521
00:30:25,978 --> 00:30:27,481
- Take the rest of the night off.
- Okay.

522
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:30,154
Hey, if you got the night off
why don't you fix my house.

523
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,726
Yeah.
It's the same guy.

524
00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:36,725
Well, the slingshot does it all
in 3 easy steps.

525
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,525
Ready.
Aim!

526
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,478
- Fire!
- I got it.

527
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:46,082
- Follow them fish!
- Me! Me! I want fruit!

528
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:50,165
Guys. It's the same fruit sitting
on the plates in front of you.

529
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:55,245
And now, for our
last gift to you.

530
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,795
Shut up and fix my house!

531
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,825
We don't know him.

532
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:04,022
I'm going to ask for a volunteer
from the audience.

533
00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:05,052
- Me!
- Me!

534
00:31:05,077 --> 00:31:06,714
Who should I pick?

535
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,399
- Who, who, who.
- Pick me, Mr. Pig.

536
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:11,219
How about the red guy,
with the enormous eyebrows?

537
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,296
- Aw.
- Ha ha ha ha.

538
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:14,129
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

539
00:31:14,154 --> 00:31:15,914
Oh. No, no, no, no.

540
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:19,473
Yes, you sir. Come on
up here it's your lucky day.

541
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:20,967
Are you sure you don't
want to choose

542
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,640
one of the 100s of birds
that had their wings up?

543
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:25,833
- Get him up here!
- Come on, Red. Have some fun!

544
00:31:25,858 --> 00:31:27,599
- Go!
- Go!

545
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,796
Oh, he's shy.

546
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,816
You hear that?
They're cheering for you!

547
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:33,201
Uh.
You got to be kidding me.

548
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,274
Red guy with the eyebrows!

549
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,050
I would have sat closer
had I known.

550
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:38,888
that I was going to be
part of the show.

551
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:42,000
- Okay. Now what?
- Come on, give him a hand.

552
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,971
Right this way, come on.
Relax, deep breathe.

553
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:45,977
Ready!

554
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:47,129
Who? Me?
Yeah. No. I'm ready.

555
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:48,625
- Aim!
- Aim at what?

556
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,873
Everybody on this one.

557
00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:52,221
- Fire!
- Fire!

558
00:31:53,597 --> 00:31:55,623
Who says birds don't fly

559
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,665
This seems really unnatural!

560
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,148
- Huh!
- Aw. I hope he's okay.

561
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:01,406
Ow.

562
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,441
Hey, don't worry.
I'm fine.

563
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:12,056
Thanks for the lift!

564
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:14,779
I wished they would have
done that 10 minutes ago.

565
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,677
Huh.

566
00:32:19,512 --> 00:32:21,833
You know you want to
search their boat.

567
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,360
What?
No, I don't.

568
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:26,284
Yeah, you're right, I do.

569
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:30,330
Bomb's on his way.
Mm. Mmm.

570
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,107
Come on.
Let's go!

571
00:32:33,132 --> 00:32:35,615
And remember, keep it quiet.

572
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:39,197
Oh, yeah.

573
00:32:41,412 --> 00:32:43,081
Whoa!
This is an impressive ship.

574
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:46,114
Shh. No. Inside voice.
Inside voice. Come on.

575
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:48,434
Sorry.

576
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,122
Piggy fitness.

577
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:52,241
- Mm?
- Nmm?

578
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:53,483
Mm-hm.

579
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:58,215
<font color="#80ff80">FIFTY SHADES
OF GREEN</font>

580
00:33:04,673 --> 00:33:06,501
Very strange.

581
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,469
- Huh?
- Aw!

582
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:14,160
Who are these weirdos?
Huh?

583
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:21,193
What are you doing,
we're trying to sneak around.

584
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:22,516
We didn't rent this place out.

585
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,745
Wow, you can rent this place?

586
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,470
- Hm.
- Give me that!

587
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,234
- Huh!
- Huh!

588
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,829
Hey, guys!

589
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:38,262
Looks like there's some more
stuff down here.

590
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,010
We were hiding.

591
00:33:48,064 --> 00:33:50,229
When I say "Hey."
You say "Ho."

592
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:52,013
- Hey!
- Ho!

593
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:53,460
- Hey!
- Ho!

594
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:54,731
- Hey!
- Ho!

595
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:56,534
There's more of them!

596
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,223
- Hey!
- Ho...!

597
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,557
That's right.
I'm back, uh-huh.

598
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,199
Enjoying the party, everyone?

599
00:34:03,224 --> 00:34:08,588
Because while you were living it up,
I snuck up onto their boat.

600
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,191
- What!
- What did he say?

601
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,035
And look at what I found.

602
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:15,466
There's more of them!
Than we thought.

603
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,488
Which is uh... mysterious and weird.
Am I right?

604
00:34:18,513 --> 00:34:19,894
Ho ho ho ho.
Ho ho.

605
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,412
Hi.

606
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:22,977
- How're you doing?
- Oh.

607
00:34:23,002 --> 00:34:26,055
You remember. He said there
were only 2 pigs on board,

608
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,216
- but he was obviously lying.
- Hmm.

609
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:32,451
Oh, and there's strange
devices on their boat!

610
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:35,306
So clearly there's... you know,
some messed up stuff going on here.

611
00:34:35,331 --> 00:34:36,803
How messed up?
I don't know

612
00:34:36,828 --> 00:34:39,060
What's specifically?
I don't know either.

613
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:40,965
Any questions?

614
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,533
You snuck onto their boat?

615
00:34:45,557 --> 00:34:47,519
You know.
I don't need a award.

616
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,965
If you guys are trying to think of
what honor to bestow upon me

617
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,563
- Don't need it.
- Boo!

618
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:52,978
Yeah, boo them.

619
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:54,407
- Boo.
- Boo.

620
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:55,810
- You're booing them or me?
- You.

621
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:57,217
Oh, it's me.

622
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:59,867
Perhaps, I can explain.

623
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:03,473
You see, my cousins
are simple folk.

624
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:07,509
Watch.
A, B, C...

625
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:10,124
Nothing.
See, nothing.

626
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,926
I didn't want to risk their lives

627
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,484
until I found out that the...
the new world was safe.

628
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:18,330
We were gonna put on
a cowboy show for you.

629
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:22,233
Let her go, boys!
Yee-haw!

630
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,592
- Ha ha, yeah!
- Yoo!

631
00:35:25,617 --> 00:35:27,066
Shhh.

632
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,528
 . . ..

633
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:31,054
- That was Pigleand.
- Oh.

634
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,663
But perhaps,
it wasn't meant to be.

635
00:35:33,688 --> 00:35:34,413
Oh.

636
00:35:34,438 --> 00:35:38,593
I believe that birds and pigs
are meant to be friends.

637
00:35:38,618 --> 00:35:43,404
But if we crossed boundaries
that were not meant to be crossed...

638
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:45,321
- Oh.
- Oh.

639
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:48,252
Mr. Red,
you shamed not only yourself,

640
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:50,372
but our entire community.

641
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:51,809
Oh, I think you messed up there.

642
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:53,886
You said shamed when
you meant saved, right?

643
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:57,304
I sent you to treatment
to deal with your problems.

644
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:59,937
Clearly, more treatment is required.

645
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:01,339
- No!
- No!

646
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:04,838
Do not trouble
our honored guests again!

647
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:09,701
My friends, we would love
to see your cowboy show.

648
00:36:09,726 --> 00:36:12,642
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

649
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:15,010
Come on, everybody!
Put your hands together!

650
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:16,122
- Woo-Hoo!
- Yeah!

651
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:18,024
Whatever.
Don't listen to me.

652
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:20,949
Body train coming through.
Choo-choo.

653
00:36:29,963 --> 00:36:32,632
Ah! I can't see.
I can't see.

654
00:36:32,854 --> 00:36:34,222
Whoa!

655
00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:54,813
- This is fun!
- Piggyback rides?

656
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,795
Yee-haw!
Let's move it there.

657
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,740
Oh boy.

658
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:59,725
Group picture.
Group picture.

659
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,229
Everybody say cheese.

660
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:02,355
-Cheese...
- Cheese.

661
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,766
- ... omelet.
- Cheese omelet.

662
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,221
Woo.
Spoiler alert.

663
00:37:08,246 --> 00:37:09,972
- Hello.
- Jump!

664
00:37:19,134 --> 00:37:22,409
- I am famish... Whoa.
- It's chow time!

665
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:27,660
Yuck.

666
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:31,408
Hanging tough through thick and thin.

667
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,164
Yeah!

668
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:37,830
Ow!

669
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:39,977
What?

670
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,822
What the heck?

671
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:50,393
Who invited you to move in?

672
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:52,767
Hey! Whoa!
That's my toothbrush.

673
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,092
Get it out!

674
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:56,706
- Woo!
- Yee-haw!

675
00:38:00,298 --> 00:38:01,573
Huh?

676
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:10,023
Alright, class.
Thought for the day.

677
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:11,964
"Water is the softest thing,

678
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,929
yet it can penetrate
mountains and earth.

679
00:38:15,954 --> 00:38:17,867
Here's my thought of the day,
"When are we done?"

680
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:19,141
Aw.
Red.

681
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:23,390
What the caterpillar calls the end,
the world calls a butterfly.

682
00:38:23,415 --> 00:38:27,219
Can I just say, I never understand
a single thing you are talking about.

683
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:36,130
Wow, that's very life like.

684
00:38:36,155 --> 00:38:38,207
Ah...!
Ha ha!

685
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,308
- Woo. Ho ho ho.
- So deep.

686
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,942
And Terence, let's see your...

687
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:46,036
Oh, my goodness.

688
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:48,684
I did not know
you felt that way.

689
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:49,955
Uh.
Class dismiss.

690
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,927
And now, we've come
to the prestigious Palm Cistern.

691
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,351
Where birds of all feathers
flock together

692
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,757
for the 8 kinds of
fruit and nut trees.

693
00:38:58,782 --> 00:39:01,211
Suck those bellies in.
Instaham!

694
00:39:01,236 --> 00:39:03,713
Hmm.
Is that what I think it is?

695
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:06,890
That's an egg.
That's how our children are born.

696
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:09,505
You guys don't lay eggs?

697
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,762
Aye.
Wished we did.

698
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,668
Enchanté.

699
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:22,378
You look delicious, my dear.

700
00:39:33,656 --> 00:39:35,598
That's us.

701
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:41,465
Hey! Hello!
Excuse me. Buddy?

702
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,661
Those are fragile.

703
00:39:42,686 --> 00:39:44,561
Maybe you shouldn't pick them up, alright?
Not yours.

704
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:47,592
Oh.
My friend from the banquet.

705
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:50,332
Now that's a very good painting.
Very good.

706
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:51,518
Oh.
Yeah uh.

707
00:39:51,543 --> 00:39:55,669
The assignment was, "Paint your pain."
So I... painted your pain.

708
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:57,890
It's actually the first
in a series.

709
00:39:57,915 --> 00:39:59,362
- Here you go.
- Uh-huh.

710
00:39:59,387 --> 00:40:01,010
- This one is nice.
- Oh.

711
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:03,773
I call this one, "Ketosis."

712
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,624
And, oh, I call this one,
"Bye bye."

713
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:09,251
Wonderful likeness.

714
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:12,159
I thought you said you stored
your nuts for winter

715
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:14,275
- Ha ha ha...
- Burn.

716
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,517
Alright, what's going on here?

717
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:17,674
Are you explorers
or are you staying?

718
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:20,929
Because if you are explorers, then
why are there more of you coming, huh?

719
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:23,037
Hi there, everybody!

720
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:28,858
Not my house again.
Tha-That's my home.

721
00:40:28,883 --> 00:40:30,384
And you know what?
If you are staying,

722
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:32,389
why don't you just say so?
And why did you leave your home?

723
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:34,651
How do we know you're not
fugitives of the law?

724
00:40:34,676 --> 00:40:37,181
You are making our guests
feel unwelcome.

725
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:39,303
And you're not asking
basic questions!

726
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:43,186
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.
Your opinion is not needed!

727
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:44,354
Why do we have to agree?

728
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:45,936
Why does it matter that
we're not the same?

729
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:49,186
Anger, is not always the answer!

730
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:50,665
Continue the tour.

731
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,512
Umm.
Surfs up, you guys.

732
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:56,049
- So, get ready to hang loose.
- That went well, if you're me.

733
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:57,363
Ha ha ha...

734
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,798
Dummy.

735
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:05,629
We could really use you
right about now.

736
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:07,806
Wait.
Actually...

737
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,768
Hey, Chuck.
It's Red, zip on down here.

738
00:41:13,145 --> 00:41:17,089
Oh. Hey, Chuck's mom,
can your son come out to play?

739
00:41:18,031 --> 00:41:21,242
All of this, does not
just happen on it's own.

740
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:25,382
BOMB'S
SHELTER

741
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:28,327
Oh, hey.
Just taking a shower.

742
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,410
- Bomb, buddy, TMI.
- Ah ha ha!

743
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:34,144
Now, I'm telling you.
Something isn't kosher with these pigs.

744
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:36,691
And it's up to us
to figure it out.

745
00:41:36,716 --> 00:41:38,272
Figure what out exactly?

746
00:41:38,297 --> 00:41:40,092
I don't know.
Maybe they are just being innovative.

747
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:42,697
- Go ahead.
- All aboard.

748
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,442
It does seem a little odd though.

749
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,964
- Weee!
- Nailed it.

750
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:51,709
Flawless.

751
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:54,792
Come on. Does none of this
seem wrong to you guys?

752
00:41:55,027 --> 00:41:57,841
I'll tell you this, if anyone knows
what these pigs are up to,

753
00:41:57,866 --> 00:42:00,085
- Hey!
- it's Mighty Eagle.

754
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,419
MIGHTY EAGLE!

755
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,975
Oh yeah.

756
00:42:15,017 --> 00:42:16,815
Take that, tree.

757
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,691
Eat my foot.

758
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:22,569
Tasty.
Yum yum yum.

759
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:26,234
Whoa.

760
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:29,202
MIGHTY EAGLE!

761
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,972
Peek-a-boo.

762
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:35,704
Hello, Bird Island!

763
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:42,913
Mighty Eagle xo
- Heh heh, you're welcome.

764
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:46,554
- Does Mighty Eagle still live?
- Did he ever lived.

765
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:48,193
And if he did live,
where would he live?

766
00:42:48,218 --> 00:42:51,054
By the Lake of Wisdom
in the ancient tree.

767
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:52,237
It's a fairy tale.

768
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:54,874
I've run all over this island,
where could that possibly be?

769
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:57,303
Way up high.

770
00:42:59,013 --> 00:43:03,119
It's a long up that mountain,
and if I'm being honestly...

771
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:05,234
Well. I mean, you know,
I can kind of use your help.

772
00:43:05,258 --> 00:43:06,953
What's that?
What are you trying to say?

773
00:43:06,978 --> 00:43:09,699
Nothing. I was just saying that I can
you know, I can use your help.

774
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:12,145
Oh. I'm sorry, I couldn't quite
hear you over your ego.

775
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:14,140
Could you enunciate
that last word a little bit.

776
00:43:14,165 --> 00:43:15,563
I need your help!

777
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:18,373
Oh.
Why didn't you say so?

778
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:21,514
- Bomb?
- Let's... do it!

779
00:43:24,465 --> 00:43:25,880
Oh gosh.

780
00:43:25,905 --> 00:43:27,692
If there is a Mighty Eagle,

781
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:30,335
well, how come we don't
ever hear his battle cry?

782
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,488
- I don't know.
- Maybe we have.

783
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:35,095
What would a Mighty Eagle
battle cry sound like?

784
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,457
You know what?
I think I got an idea.

785
00:43:36,482 --> 00:43:38,348
Maybe it's something like...

786
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,079
No!
That's more like...

787
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,105
That's theoretically what
it's more like, scientifically.

788
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,374
Oh, I got one.

789
00:43:52,044 --> 00:43:53,701
Not bad.
It's a good impression.

790
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:57,291
But, in my head, I'm kind of
imagining something more like a...

791
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:05,572
That sounds about right.

792
00:44:05,597 --> 00:44:07,723
No. I'm thinking it maybe
it's a little bit more subtle.

793
00:44:07,748 --> 00:44:10,393
Like a little bit,
just more majestic like...

794
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,472
- I'm cAlling for yOu!
- I'm coming foR You so OpeN your door!

795
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:30,327
Stop making Mighty Eagle noises!

796
00:44:30,352 --> 00:44:33,329
It's like running a nursery.
Absolute childcare.

797
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:37,296
Someone has anger issues.

798
00:44:42,407 --> 00:44:45,641
This uh.
This is the wrong mountain.

799
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,455
My calves are killing me.

800
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,185
Aw!

801
00:45:16,353 --> 00:45:18,093
- Oh, wow.
- Whoa.

802
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:20,689
That is simply unreal.

803
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:22,872
The Lake of Wisdom.

804
00:45:26,454 --> 00:45:28,830
What are you guys waiting for?

805
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:32,253
Guys, hurry up!

806
00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:36,007
This is what Mama talked about.

807
00:45:36,758 --> 00:45:38,675
Wow.

808
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:45,903
Ah. Be honest.
Do I sound any wiser?

809
00:45:45,928 --> 00:45:47,694
Oh, way wiser.

810
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,913
You were kind of dumb before,
I can say that now.

811
00:45:49,938 --> 00:45:51,691
That water is no joke.

812
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:55,261
I can literally taste the
intelligence and wisdom...

813
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:58,040
- ... circulating through my body now.
- Hey, guys. Nobody's here.

814
00:45:58,065 --> 00:46:00,812
I mean, nobody's used
this place in years.

815
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:03,751
What are you doing?

816
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:06,265
Get out of there!

817
00:46:13,097 --> 00:46:14,701
Aww.

818
00:46:16,088 --> 00:46:17,848
Don't spit in his mouth!

819
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:20,216
No, don't spit it back!

820
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:22,324
Uh, don't swallow it.

821
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,821
Ew.
Ack.

822
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:34,912
Whoa!

823
00:46:36,528 --> 00:46:38,653
Get out. Let's go.
Come on.

824
00:46:38,678 --> 00:46:40,843
Shh, shh, Bomb.
Take your time, will you.

825
00:46:40,868 --> 00:46:42,476
Red.
I found the meaning of life.

826
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:44,787
- It's...
- Shut your worm hole!

827
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:08,593
Oh, wow, it's him.

828
00:47:33,163 --> 00:47:34,870
Oh man.

829
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:46,806
No, no, no.
Ack!

830
00:47:47,874 --> 00:47:50,945
 Horrible turn of events, horrible.

831
00:48:06,312 --> 00:48:07,547
Well.

832
00:48:07,572 --> 00:48:10,623
Not so much the Lake of Wisdom,
it's more like the Lake of Wizz.

833
00:48:10,648 --> 00:48:14,181
Did you just come here
to look at me?

834
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:17,896
Or did you have
something to say?

835
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,248
- I think he saw us.
- Oh, you think so?

836
00:48:22,495 --> 00:48:25,253
You have passed the first test!

837
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,054
You have found me.

838
00:48:27,094 --> 00:48:28,294
- Whoa!
- Look out. Whoa!

839
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,126
Behold.
Gaze upon.

840
00:48:32,151 --> 00:48:36,439
Mighty Eagle!

841
00:48:39,225 --> 00:48:43,308
I see all and know all.

842
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:45,658
- What are your names?
- If you know all,

843
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:47,540
why don't you know where we are?

844
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:48,578
Ow!

845
00:48:48,603 --> 00:48:51,004
I know very well
who you are.

846
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:56,000
You are lost souls, who have
come here, seeking wisdom.

847
00:48:56,025 --> 00:48:58,255
- Whoa!
- Can we have some?

848
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,347
Wisdom is not something
that is given.

849
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,475
It is something that is...
attain.

850
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,929
Okay.
Goodbye.

851
00:49:06,954 --> 00:49:10,277
No no no...
Will I help you attain wisdom?

852
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:11,909
- Whoa! Ha ha!
- Yes!

853
00:49:11,934 --> 00:49:13,955
That, I will do.

854
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,554
Right. So, the reason we've climbed
the mountain is that we want to know...

855
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,590
- Prepare!
- Okay.

856
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:21,900
... to have your minds Blown.

857
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,478
Aw!
Son of a...

858
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,644
This guy is good.

859
00:49:25,669 --> 00:49:28,948
Welcome, to the Hall of Heroism.

860
00:49:28,973 --> 00:49:31,801
Wow.
It's really amazing to meet you.

861
00:49:31,826 --> 00:49:33,788
You know, I actually
have your poster up uh...

862
00:49:33,813 --> 00:49:38,172
You might want to shield your eyes
from the sprinkle of those trophies.

863
00:49:38,197 --> 00:49:39,818
How many?
I have no idea.

864
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,813
Countless, I'm sure.
13.

865
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,052
Wow. This is way nicer than
my Hall of Wimpiness.

866
00:49:45,077 --> 00:49:47,568
Bring it home, mamacita.

867
00:49:47,724 --> 00:49:50,345
Get out of town.
Ha ha ha ha!

868
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,914
What the?

869
00:50:00,095 --> 00:50:02,001
Those are some
old school moves there.

870
00:50:02,026 --> 00:50:03,732
Yeah.

871
00:50:07,927 --> 00:50:09,071
What?

872
00:50:09,096 --> 00:50:10,416
...
Wow.

873
00:50:10,714 --> 00:50:12,222
YES!

874
00:50:12,247 --> 00:50:13,391
Yeah.

875
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:18,006
So, he's kind of a wackadoodle.

876
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:20,551
That, you know,
it doesn't mean he's not wise.

877
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:26,171
Hey. Are you tired of filling
your balloons with heavy old air?

878
00:50:26,196 --> 00:50:28,379
Finally, there's a better way.

879
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:29,595
- Helium.
- Helium.

880
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,378
It's a gas.

881
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,716
Aw.
Don't worry about your balloon.

882
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:37,690
It will just land in the ocean.
The fish love it.

883
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:40,093
It's good for their tummy.

884
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,226
Free party.
Free party.

885
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,307
It's going to be the
piggiest party of the year.

886
00:50:48,491 --> 00:50:50,665
Party!
Get a bird sitter.

887
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,296
Let's go, piggies.

888
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:55,030
Well now, that,
is some fine handy work.

889
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:57,203
- Hey, judge, you're under arrest.
- What?

890
00:50:57,229 --> 00:50:58,885
For looking too good.

891
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:00,136
Hello.
What about me?

892
00:51:00,161 --> 00:51:02,943
Do I get a plus one?
Oh! Thank you.

893
00:51:02,968 --> 00:51:04,571
Let me see.
Let me see.

894
00:51:04,596 --> 00:51:07,258
Ah-choo!
Oh, that was a wet one.

895
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:15,803
- Ooo.
- Ooo.

896
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:19,008
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

897
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,562
Almost there.
Don't rush me.

898
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:26,076
- Oop. Slow down there.
- Deep breath. Deep breath.

899
00:51:27,341 --> 00:51:29,054
And we're back.
And now...

900
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:30,771
Who's ready for trust falls?

901
00:51:30,803 --> 00:51:32,516
- I got you.
- No no no no no.

902
00:51:36,224 --> 00:51:40,413
Mighty Mighty Eagle soaring free.

903
00:51:40,438 --> 00:51:44,928
Defender of our homes and liberty.

904
00:51:44,953 --> 00:51:49,503
Bravery, humility, and honesty.

905
00:51:49,528 --> 00:51:53,496
You must have grown up
singing this song in school.

906
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:56,025
Uhh.
Yeah.

907
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:59,650
- Yes, we did.
- Um. Right. Yeah.

908
00:51:59,796 --> 00:52:06,273
Mighty, Mighty Eagle, rescue me.

909
00:52:06,298 --> 00:52:08,506
Now you do the second verse.

910
00:52:08,531 --> 00:52:10,691
- Uh. I.. I...
- Come on.

911
00:52:10,716 --> 00:52:12,424
- Me?
- Yes.

912
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:15,156
Do it.

913
00:52:15,181 --> 00:52:19,186
- Mighty, Mighty Eagle flap your wings.
- Oh yeah!

914
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:22,847
And fill up your big cave
with all your fancy things.

915
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:23,757
That's it.

916
00:52:23,782 --> 00:52:26,177
- Politeness, Good sportsmanship.
- That's no me.

917
00:52:26,202 --> 00:52:28,197
- and the long attention span.
- What?

918
00:52:28,222 --> 00:52:32,453
Mighty, Mighty Eagle, yeah.

919
00:52:32,478 --> 00:52:34,278
Take it away, Charles.

920
00:52:34,303 --> 00:52:38,267
Oh great heroic Mighty Eagle.

921
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:40,718
With finer plumage

922
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:43,878
- ... than a sea gull.
- Oh, sing it.

923
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:49,691
Uh.
Ambidexterity, pottery,

924
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:52,001
- ... and bankruptcy
- Ouch.

925
00:52:52,026 --> 00:52:56,401
Mighty, Mighty Eagle...
Harmonize. Harmonize.

926
00:52:56,426 --> 00:53:01,877
- Rescue me.
- Rescue me.

927
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:09,369
Wow.
You know it better than me.

928
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:13,548
So, anyway, the other day,
these pigs showed up out of nowhere.

929
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:16,142
And, it caused me
a great deal of suspicion.

930
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:18,588
And he's walking
out of the room.

931
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,202
Unbelie...
I don't get this.

932
00:53:20,227 --> 00:53:22,181
This guy sits here on
his butt, all alone.

933
00:53:22,206 --> 00:53:23,689
clearly doesn't leave the house.

934
00:53:23,714 --> 00:53:26,893
He talk's a good game, but, he
doesn't care about anyone but himself.

935
00:53:26,918 --> 00:53:28,517
Sounds a lot like you.

936
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:31,704
Oh good.
Thank you for your opinion, Chuck.

937
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:36,816
Well, hello.

938
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:39,318
- Hello. Mighty Eagle.
- What?

939
00:53:39,343 --> 00:53:40,904
- What are you doing?
- Uh.

940
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,671
- I am bird watching.
- What?

941
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:45,810
- Ah.
- Take a peek.

942
00:53:48,439 --> 00:53:51,176
- Oh you're disgusting
- Oh yeah.

943
00:53:51,201 --> 00:53:53,217
Look.
Are you gonna help us or not?

944
00:53:53,242 --> 00:53:55,598
- I am helping you!
- No. This is you helping.

945
00:53:55,623 --> 00:53:57,983
Looking through binoculars.
Spying on old ladies.

946
00:53:58,008 --> 00:53:59,731
Whoa, whoa.
What is that?

947
00:54:00,845 --> 00:54:02,569
Wait.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

948
00:54:03,604 --> 00:54:06,345
Oh my.

949
00:54:06,554 --> 00:54:09,080
Huh!
I was right.

950
00:54:09,105 --> 00:54:10,686
I was right.
I knew it!

951
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:12,471
Bomb, Chuck, hurry up!
Get out here!

952
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:13,577
Oh oh.

953
00:54:13,602 --> 00:54:16,613
Mighty Eagle, hey.
Fly us down there, now.

954
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,736
- No.
- I'm sorry. What?

955
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:25,080
I don't do that anymore.
I'm retired.

956
00:54:25,105 --> 00:54:26,528
Mostly just tired.

957
00:54:26,553 --> 00:54:27,743
Go handle it yourself.

958
00:54:27,774 --> 00:54:30,927
This is everything
I've prepared you for.

959
00:54:30,952 --> 00:54:32,560
What?
Prepared us for?

960
00:54:32,585 --> 00:54:33,911
Hold on.
Did I missed something?

961
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,846
Let me just go through
my notes really quick. Let's see.

962
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:38,340
Crazy stuff, bragging,
crazy stuff, karaoke.

963
00:54:38,365 --> 00:54:40,900
No. See, I don't see
anything useful here.

964
00:54:40,925 --> 00:54:44,198
The whole world,
everyone we know, is in danger.

965
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,806
Yes, it is.

966
00:54:45,831 --> 00:54:48,803
- So, off you go.
- Hey. You know what?

967
00:54:49,468 --> 00:54:51,773
I used to believe in you.

968
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:56,093
When I was a kid, I believed
nothing really bad could ever happen

969
00:54:56,118 --> 00:54:57,706
because you were here.

970
00:54:57,731 --> 00:55:01,889
And now I see the fate of
the world hangs on idiots like me.

971
00:55:01,914 --> 00:55:05,873
And that, sir,
is sort of terrifying.

972
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,322
It's time for you to go.

973
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:11,757
You know, it's really upsetting to me
that you're the only bird that can fly.

974
00:55:11,782 --> 00:55:13,755
And you're too afraid to do it.

975
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,534
- Huh!
- Huh?

976
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:17,881
Hey, guys. Come on, let's go.
We're done here. He's no hero.

977
00:55:17,906 --> 00:55:20,086
So, uh, I'm having
a party next Tuesday.

978
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:22,517
Could you just
do a little pop in?

979
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:29,396
Come on, run faster!

980
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:30,383
- Whoa!
- Ah!

981
00:55:30,408 --> 00:55:32,280
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Whoa!

982
00:55:35,156 --> 00:55:37,213
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Let's go!

983
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,172
- Woo!
- Yeah!

984
00:55:40,613 --> 00:55:41,713
- Woo.
- Woo.

985
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,664
I love this song.

986
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:52,168
I sentence you all
to 4 hours of hard partying.

987
00:55:54,497 --> 00:55:56,159
Watch out below!

988
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:57,343
- Huh?
- Huh?

989
00:55:57,368 --> 00:56:00,940
- Huh! They're taking the eggs!
- Follow them.

990
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:03,393
Gangway!

991
00:56:07,243 --> 00:56:09,090
Oh man.

992
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:22,532
Right on time. Excellent.
Ah ha ha... !

993
00:56:22,557 --> 00:56:24,637
Chuck, go shut
that party down, now!

994
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:27,713
Ee. But I only know
how to get party started.

995
00:56:27,738 --> 00:56:29,040
- Go!
- On it.

996
00:56:29,065 --> 00:56:31,423
- Bomb, we got to stop them.
- Yeah!

997
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:38,311
Got to get more speeeeed!

998
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,909
Ah!
Whoa!

999
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:43,400
It's Chuck time!

1000
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:45,891
Get to the ship!

1001
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,213
Eggs.

1002
00:56:54,054 --> 00:56:58,682
Can everybody please stop partying?
There are eggs being stolen!

1003
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,160
Matilda, we need your help.

1004
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,204
- The pigs are stealing our eggs!
- What?

1005
00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:07,027
- I'm airborne!
- We have to get back to the village!

1006
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:07,716
Whoa!

1007
00:57:07,741 --> 00:57:10,850
Stop dancing and start running!

1008
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:13,670
Huh!
Hors d'oeuvres, my weakness.

1009
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:16,219
Come on, let's wrap it up.

1010
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,419
- We got to get the eggs off the ship!
- Yeah, let's go!

1011
00:57:18,444 --> 00:57:19,943
- Is everyone on board?
- Let's go. Let's go!

1012
00:57:19,968 --> 00:57:22,033
Use the trampolines!

1013
00:57:23,496 --> 00:57:24,870
Can you get up there?

1014
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:26,425
We got an intruder!

1015
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,973
What the heck are they doing?

1016
00:57:27,998 --> 00:57:30,149
Untie the ropes.
Drop the eggs in the water.

1017
00:57:30,174 --> 00:57:33,783
Get rid of them.
Get him off of there.

1018
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:36,286
It's too strong,
I can't break it.

1019
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:38,899
Huh!
Bomb, blow off the chain.

1020
00:57:39,117 --> 00:57:40,841
Knock them down!

1021
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:43,849
Come on, Bomb.
You can do this.

1022
00:57:46,238 --> 00:57:47,817
Come on, Bomb.
You got this.

1023
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:49,940
- Blow up.
- You got to get me mad.

1024
00:57:49,965 --> 00:57:51,804
Okay. Well then,
what makes you mad?

1025
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:54,551
Try insulting me
on a personal level.

1026
00:57:54,578 --> 00:57:57,229
Oh, oh, uh.
Your poetry stinks!

1027
00:57:57,254 --> 00:57:59,515
You're just a bad poet.
And you know it!

1028
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,134
Oh. I know.
I know!

1029
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:04,625
Hey.
Who wants a birdie bath?

1030
00:58:12,465 --> 00:58:14,561
Oh. I'm sorry, Red.
I couldn't do it.

1031
00:58:14,586 --> 00:58:16,397
Don't give up.
This isn't over!

1032
00:58:16,425 --> 00:58:18,989
Thanks for your hospitality.

1033
00:58:19,014 --> 00:58:21,981
- Ha ha ha... !
- Yeah.

1034
00:58:22,006 --> 00:58:25,209
Set sail for Piggy Island!

1035
00:58:30,294 --> 00:58:31,716
- Huh!
- Huh!

00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,951
Huh!
Oh no!

1038
00:58:58,976 --> 00:59:00,701
We'll find them

1039
00:59:00,726 --> 00:59:02,924
Oh.
Oh.

1040
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:06,887
Oh.
They're all gone.

1042
00:59:09,742 --> 00:59:12,311
Shh, shh.
It's okay.

1043
00:59:18,533 --> 00:59:20,671
Mr. Red!

1044
00:59:26,244 --> 00:59:28,533
What do we do now?

1045
00:59:29,116 --> 00:59:30,721
Wait, hold on.
You're asking me?

1046
00:59:30,746 --> 00:59:33,663
You knew.
You try to tell us.

1047
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:35,885
But we didn't listen.

1048
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:39,104
I didn't hear

1049
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:41,726
Red, we need a leader.

1050
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:43,442
- What do we do now?
- What do we do?

1051
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:45,702
Wait a minute.
I'm not a leader.

1052
00:59:45,727 --> 00:59:47,801
Okay. Pigs stole our kids.
That sucks.

1053
00:59:47,826 --> 00:59:51,110
Made all you guys looked like idiots.
You know what we got to do?

1054
00:59:51,135 --> 00:59:54,073
We start replacing those kids.

1055
00:59:54,098 --> 00:59:56,860
Ladies, get busy!

1056
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,984
We're going to be laying
some eggs tonight!

1057
00:59:59,009 --> 01:00:00,813
No. No, stop.
No no no...

1058
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:02,811
We're not going to
replace those kids.

1059
01:00:02,836 --> 01:00:05,856
- We're gonna get them back.
- How are we going to do that?

1060
01:00:05,881 --> 01:00:08,558
What do you mean how?
The pigs already showed us how.

1061
01:00:08,857 --> 01:00:10,699
That, is where they went!

1062
01:00:10,724 --> 01:00:13,134
And, so that,
is where we are going!

1063
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:15,305
But how do we get from here
to there?

1064
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:17,298
I'm not aquatic,
in the least.

1065
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:19,615
Well.
You know

1066
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,373
We're gonna build our own boat.

1067
01:00:21,398 --> 01:00:22,840
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

1068
01:00:22,865 --> 01:00:24,629
They stole your kids.

1069
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:28,749
No. They stole our kids.
I mean, who does that?

1070
01:00:28,774 --> 01:00:31,318
Have you ever stolen
any one's children?

1071
01:00:31,343 --> 01:00:33,696
Huh?
Have you?

1072
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:35,783
I mean, you look like you would.

1073
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:38,451
And you know what?
I'm a little bit angry.

1074
01:00:38,476 --> 01:00:41,236
Correction.
I'm really angry.

1075
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:43,295
And I don't think
I'm the only one.

1076
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,880
Come on, we're birds!
We're descendants from dinosaurs!

1077
01:00:46,905 --> 01:00:49,678
We're not supposed to be nice!
Right?

1078
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,274
Uh.
Yeah, point-point made.

1079
01:00:56,299 --> 01:00:57,795
- Who else here is angry?
- I! -I!

1080
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,976
- I am.
- Yeah, you are!

1081
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:02,736
We're getting our kids back,
and I don't need any

1082
01:01:02,761 --> 01:01:05,607
- ... calm, detach, happy birds.
- No.

1083
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:07,605
Not going to help us.
Don't need it.

1084
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:11,244
I need some angry flocking birds.

1085
01:01:11,269 --> 01:01:13,099
You hear me!
Now, who's angry!

1086
01:01:13,124 --> 01:01:14,486
- Yeah!
- Angry!

1087
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:16,131
Well, let's go!

1088
01:01:16,156 --> 01:01:18,692
Bring me everything that floats.

1089
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:20,586
Yeah. Yeah.
That's perfect, yeah.

1090
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:32,551
With every single feather
of my being,

1091
01:01:32,576 --> 01:01:37,187
I am not going to let any of these
eggs be taken from their parents.

1092
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:47,893
Chuck, I need you to
tie those crates together.

1093
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:49,247
You got it.

1094
01:01:49,996 --> 01:01:52,558
- Done, and done.
- Uh. A little help here?

1095
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,261
Let's go!
Move it, everybody!

1096
01:01:54,286 --> 01:01:56,163
- Push with your upper body.
- Put your back into it.

1097
01:01:56,188 --> 01:01:58,974
I have no upper body!

1098
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,372
Darn good for a bunch of birds.

1099
01:02:01,397 --> 01:02:04,550
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yay!

1100
01:02:13,885 --> 01:02:15,245
Go Leonard!

1101
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:18,540
When I say, "Eat the".
You say, "eggs."

1102
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:21,949
- Eat the.
- Eggs!

1103
01:02:21,974 --> 01:02:23,849
Wow, what a reception.

1104
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:26,417
Alright, snouts up!

1105
01:02:27,629 --> 01:02:31,728
My, it's a snout staircase.
Who thinks of that?

1106
01:02:32,806 --> 01:02:37,870
Welcome home,
King Mudbeard!

1107
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:44,245
My father, and my father's father,
and my weird Aunt Chloe,

1108
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:46,502
have all searched for the eggs.

1109
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,630
But only I,

1110
01:02:48,655 --> 01:02:51,933
- King Mudbeard, have found them.
- Oh. My pom-poms.

1111
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:55,428
I present to you,
the EGGS!

1112
01:02:58,356 --> 01:02:59,876
Say goodbye to Harvey.

1113
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,700
- A feast!
- Huh!

1114
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:04,996
I proclaim a feast!
2 nights heads.

1115
01:03:05,021 --> 01:03:06,341
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1116
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,766
- I ♥ cholesterol!
- Let's EAT.

1117
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:10,790
Let's go make some omelets!

1118
01:03:19,365 --> 01:03:22,107
Oh. I feel a little nervous inside,
but that's normal, right?

1119
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,444
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

1120
01:03:25,692 --> 01:03:28,489
Uh. Anybody else got
butterflies in the stomach?

1121
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:29,531
Yeah.

1122
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:32,032
Probably because you ate
too many caterpillars.

1123
01:03:34,161 --> 01:03:36,708
Drop your nuts
and move your butts!

1124
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,154
Come on, let's go!

1125
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,849
- Oh no.
- Whoa.

1126
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:50,728
I wasn't expecting this.

1127
01:03:53,575 --> 01:03:55,303
Well.
Hold on a second.

1128
01:03:55,328 --> 01:03:57,522
That guy is the king?

1129
01:03:57,742 --> 01:04:00,278
He's got to have the eggs
with him in the castle.

1130
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,288
- What the heck is a castle?
- And that's where we're going.

1131
01:04:02,313 --> 01:04:05,826
Hey, guys. Do you remember
everything you learned in my class?

1132
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:06,949
- Yep.
- Nope.

1133
01:04:06,974 --> 01:04:09,107
- What class?
- Well, forget all of it for now.

1134
01:04:09,132 --> 01:04:10,931
Now it's time to let loose.

1135
01:04:10,956 --> 01:04:12,840
Oh good.
Because I never learn anything anyway.

1136
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:14,652
Oh, me neither.
I actually just came to socialize.

1137
01:04:14,677 --> 01:04:15,996
I came for the snacks.

1138
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:18,165
You don't happen to have
any of it now, do you?

1139
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:20,204
Deep breath. Deep breath.
DEEP BREATH.

1140
01:04:20,229 --> 01:04:22,740
How are we going to
get over those walls?

1141
01:04:22,765 --> 01:04:24,064
Uh.

1142
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:28,287
I'll tell you how.
We're gonna fly.

1143
01:04:28,592 --> 01:04:30,535
Remember.
The goal is the castle.

1144
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,348
Get to the castle.
Who wants to go first?

1145
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:34,706
- Over here!
- I do!

1146
01:04:34,731 --> 01:04:37,128
- Me. Me. Me.
- Hey. Alright, Matilda.

1147
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:38,767
Always a brides-space.

1148
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,893
Step right up.
Keep your wings, legs and beak

1149
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,456
- inside the slingshot at all times.
- Shoot it!

1150
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:44,641
Okey-doke.
Fire!

1151
01:04:48,034 --> 01:04:49,585
And one,
and a whoa...

1152
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:50,921
Take that, porkers!

1153
01:04:50,946 --> 01:04:52,947
Incoming!

1154
01:04:53,274 --> 01:04:55,769
Boom, baby, boom!

1155
01:04:55,794 --> 01:04:58,627
Well, how about that? My teacher
can shoot fireballs out of her butt.

1156
01:04:58,652 --> 01:05:00,128
You, what's your name?
Hal?

1157
01:05:00,153 --> 01:05:01,659
I've seen you do something
strange before, right?

1158
01:05:01,684 --> 01:05:02,666
Well, let's see.

1159
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:06,128
- I'm really good at...
- It doesn't matter. Launch him.

1160
01:05:06,848 --> 01:05:08,729
Oh, this guys looks good.

1161
01:05:08,754 --> 01:05:10,461
He's gonna make it.

1162
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:14,236
This is incredible.
We're witnessing history right now.

1163
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:15,729
No, he's coming back.

1164
01:05:15,754 --> 01:05:16,921
- He's coming, duck.
- Whoa whoa whoa...

1165
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:18,611
Get down.
DUCK!

1166
01:05:18,636 --> 01:05:20,299
Whoa whoa whoa...

1167
01:05:20,324 --> 01:05:22,204
Uh.
Did we win?

1168
01:05:22,229 --> 01:05:23,942
Uh, no.
Not quite yet, buddy.

1169
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:27,090
Uh, we're still tied.
Hey, can we get an ice pack for Hal?

1170
01:05:27,115 --> 01:05:29,333
- Medic!
- Alright. Who's up next!

1171
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,022
Whoa whoa whoa...
What can you do?

1172
01:05:31,047 --> 01:05:32,913
Ah-choo!

1173
01:05:32,938 --> 01:05:36,267
- Uh... Yuck.
- Uh, need a tissue?

1174
01:05:41,649 --> 01:05:45,345
Calvin Swine.

1175
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,842
Who's next?
We need flyers, not standbyers!

1176
01:05:47,867 --> 01:05:49,195
Let's go!

1177
01:05:49,353 --> 01:05:52,291
You go out there and you show them
how frightening mimes can be.

1178
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:53,312
Yeah!

1179
01:05:53,337 --> 01:05:55,119
Oh my gosh!

1180
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,725
We're having a feast.
We're eating the eggs.

1181
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:01,277
Going to have a big feast.
Going to eat all the eggs.

1182
01:06:01,302 --> 01:06:03,416
Huh?
What?

1183
01:06:04,385 --> 01:06:06,294
- What is that?
- Whoa!

1184
01:06:08,785 --> 01:06:09,915
Fire!

1185
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,878
That guy again.

1186
01:06:11,903 --> 01:06:14,512
HAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
- Citizens of Pig Island.

1187
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:17,556
If you spot any birds
destroying your neighbourhood,

1188
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:20,424
- please capture them.
- What did he say?

1189
01:06:20,448 --> 01:06:25,192
There's been a change of plan.
We will eat the eggs for lunch.

1190
01:06:25,217 --> 01:06:28,074
Did he say eat the eggs?

1191
01:06:38,987 --> 01:06:41,491
Okay. I want you to curl up
into a little ball, alright?

1192
01:06:41,516 --> 01:06:44,182
- Make yourself aerodynamic.
- Like this?

1193
01:06:44,207 --> 01:06:45,704
To the left!
To the left!

1194
01:06:45,729 --> 01:06:47,641
- Let me at em!
- Launch!

1195
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:54,023
Don't mess with Bubbles!

1196
01:06:54,622 --> 01:06:58,312
- Get him!
- Heat pile. Hog pile.

1197
01:06:58,441 --> 01:07:01,283
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO MESS WITH ME!

1198
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:04,463
Wow, that blows.
Uh, in a good way.

1199
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:06,139
- To the left!
- Oh. Hold on, wait.

1200
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:07,745
My left of your left?

1201
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:11,105
My left is your left.
We are facing the same direction.

1202
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,227
Right.
Good call.

1203
01:07:12,252 --> 01:07:15,292
Just look where the last bird went
and adjust from there.

1204
01:07:15,317 --> 01:07:17,694
- I got this you guys.
- Alright.

1205
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:38,806
She got far,
but not far enough.

1206
01:07:38,831 --> 01:07:40,258
- Get her out of our town!
- Oh oh.

1207
01:07:40,283 --> 01:07:42,757
We have to get closer.

1208
01:07:43,463 --> 01:07:47,507
Judge power!

1209
01:07:50,478 --> 01:07:52,405
Trial by fire!

1210
01:07:52,445 --> 01:07:55,905
No, literally he's on fire right now.
Can somebody please help him?

1211
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:10,367
Mighty Eagle!

1212
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:19,505
Terence.
I got an idea.

1213
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,854
Do you think you can pull
the slingshot back far enough

1214
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:23,827
to hit that giant boulder?

1215
01:08:23,852 --> 01:08:27,286
Okay. Launch me right towards
the top of that thing.

1216
01:08:30,266 --> 01:08:31,833
Ready.

1217
01:08:33,038 --> 01:08:35,430
Red, I'm not going to lie to you.
I am...

1218
01:08:35,804 --> 01:08:37,704
... going to miss you
when you die.

1219
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:40,849
Rest in peace, my friend.
Rest in peace.

1220
01:08:40,874 --> 01:08:43,125
Hey, guys.
Let's not get cheesy, okay?

1221
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,426
Ready.
Fire!

1222
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,965
This is gonna hurt.

1223
01:08:55,863 --> 01:08:57,915
What was that?
Huh?

1224
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,368
- My roof!
- Oh oh.

1225
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:03,701
- Did he make it?
- I hope he's okay.

1226
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:07,635
- I'm in!
- Yeah. I knew he would make it.

1227
01:09:09,026 --> 01:09:11,351
Send everyone else!

1228
01:09:11,376 --> 01:09:15,038
Guards!
There's a red bird in these walls.

1229
01:09:15,063 --> 01:09:16,736
Bring him to me.

1230
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:18,868
- Aye aye, sir.
- Roger that, boss.

1231
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,594
Not in these walls.

1232
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:24,727
In the castle!
Come on, you guys.

1233
01:09:24,752 --> 01:09:27,604
Here, pretty bird.
Here, pretty bird.

1234
01:09:31,016 --> 01:09:33,617
Transport the eggs!

1235
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:40,085
<font color="#ff8080">NO EGGS
IN HERE</font>

1236
01:09:40,211 --> 01:09:43,414
Launch me exactly the same way
you did for Red...!

1237
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:47,756
I wasn't ready!
Uh, faster!

1238
01:10:02,997 --> 01:10:04,462
Chuck, is that you?

1239
01:10:04,487 --> 01:10:06,873
Is this the house of horrors?

1240
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:08,987
I got to be honest.
You look a little... fine.

1241
01:10:09,012 --> 01:10:12,242
- You look fine, come on.
- Bomb's on his way.

1242
01:10:17,654 --> 01:10:19,302
Ouchy.

1243
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:22,881
Ah! Ha!
Call in the Piggy Air Force!

1244
01:10:22,906 --> 01:10:24,454
What is that?

1245
01:10:25,557 --> 01:10:27,539
My loyal subjects.

1246
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:30,681
The treacherous birds
have repaid our friendship

1247
01:10:30,706 --> 01:10:33,531
with an unprovoked act of aggression!

1248
01:10:33,556 --> 01:10:35,686
The attack will fail!

1249
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:40,515
We have glass! We have wood!
We have TNT.

1250
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:44,835
We tried to kill them with kindness
and now we're just gonna have to...

1251
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,896
Well, you know.

1252
01:10:46,921 --> 01:10:48,685
Run!

1253
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:52,358
Who's gonna go next?

1254
01:10:58,558 --> 01:11:00,153
Aim for that ram.

1255
01:11:00,178 --> 01:11:01,336
- Yes.
- Yeah!

1256
01:11:01,361 --> 01:11:06,371
- Terence.
- Terence.

1257
01:11:06,506 --> 01:11:07,928
Get them!

1258
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:13,473
- No.
- What happened?

1259
01:11:16,879 --> 01:11:19,012
No eggs in here.
No. Nope. No. No.

1260
01:11:19,037 --> 01:11:21,327
Hey! Whoa.
I'm on this.

1261
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:25,390
Redrum.

1262
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:27,978
Uh.
Never mind.

1263
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:31,767
Backup engine.

1264
01:11:36,528 --> 01:11:38,141
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Wait. Hold on a second.

1265
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:39,859
Wait, I know that rear end.
That's Bomb.

1266
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:42,617
Yeah. Chuck, that's not his rear end.
That's his face, man.

1267
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:44,258
- Sorry, Bomb.
- No problem.

1268
01:11:44,283 --> 01:11:46,150
It's a shaky week.

1269
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,544
Thanks for getting me out.

1270
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:54,190
- We want egg!
- We want egg!

1271
01:11:55,763 --> 01:11:58,283
He was sick.
But, then he got cured.

1272
01:11:58,673 --> 01:12:02,136
No eggs in... huh!
Ooo, these are clever pigs.

1273
01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:04,527
Okay, look. I'm gonna run up
and tackle the pig on the left.

1274
01:12:04,552 --> 01:12:07,430
Bomb, you can handle too.
Chuck, I don't know if you can help?

1275
01:12:07,455 --> 01:12:12,178
We got to figure out a way
to get into that room...

1276
01:12:19,429 --> 01:12:20,711
<font color="#ff8080">FART
FACE</font>

1277
01:12:30,248 --> 01:12:32,712
... room
Anyone have any bright ideas?

1278
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:40,321
- Uh. Huh?
- You are gonna pay for that.

1279
01:12:41,295 --> 01:12:42,608
What just happened?

1280
01:12:42,633 --> 01:12:44,868
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were saying.

1281
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:47,137
And here we are?

1282
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,065
We found them!
Oh oh.

1283
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:51,120
Oh, come on

1284
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:55,616
- Red!
- Guys, come on!

1285
01:12:55,641 --> 01:12:57,180
Quick, follow him.

1286
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:00,565
Things are looking sunny side up!

1287
01:13:00,903 --> 01:13:03,001
Guys, I'm here.
Everything is going to be okay.

1288
01:13:03,026 --> 01:13:04,491
- We are gonna get you out of here.
- Hurry up, Bomb!

1289
01:13:04,516 --> 01:13:05,815
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

1290
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,793
Don't lose me!

1291
01:13:07,818 --> 01:13:09,555
Goodness, they made a harem!

1292
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,288
Oh boy.

1293
01:13:11,313 --> 01:13:13,272
- We want egg!
- We want egg!

1294
01:13:13,297 --> 01:13:17,499
What is he doing up there?
This is a civilize buffet.

1295
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:27,099
Don't hatch now.
Do not hatch now.

1296
01:13:27,124 --> 01:13:29,289
Get that red skank off my eggs.

1297
01:13:29,314 --> 01:13:31,301
- Hey!
- Oh man

1298
01:13:31,326 --> 01:13:34,256
- Bomb, are you okay?
- Oh, I've been better.

1299
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,552
I'm going to get
a running start!

1300
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:41,677
- It's show time!
- Oh.

1301
01:13:41,702 --> 01:13:43,749
Fine.
Boil him too!

1302
01:13:43,774 --> 01:13:45,629
Let's pig out.

1303
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:48,127
Looks like it's just
you and me, pork belly!

1304
01:13:48,152 --> 01:13:49,445
I'll be taking that!

1305
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,618
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa.

1306
01:13:54,428 --> 01:13:57,884
- Hey? Oh.
- No!

1307
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:03,144
- We're coming.
- Deep breath.

1308
01:14:07,883 --> 01:14:10,803
Ow! I'm in!
Classy joint.

1309
01:14:10,828 --> 01:14:12,585
- HELLO!
- Huh!

1310
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:15,850
- Where is everyone?
- Mighty Eagle. Where's he going?

1311
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:18,198
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

1312
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,831
Oh, my battle cry?

1313
01:14:25,268 --> 01:14:27,052
Coming in.
Coming in.

1314
01:14:27,077 --> 01:14:31,115
Mighty Eagle!

1315
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,406
Oh oh.

1316
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:38,272
Whoa!

1317
01:14:45,533 --> 01:14:47,940
Mighty-Mighty Eagle.
Might Eagle, wake up, come on.

1318
01:14:47,965 --> 01:14:49,211
Oh, that's bad breath.

1319
01:14:49,236 --> 01:14:52,588
I can sleep late, Mom.
It's not a school day.

1320
01:14:52,612 --> 01:14:56,497
Throw him in the pot too.
I'll have the big turkey.

1321
01:14:59,222 --> 01:15:00,860
- Red!
- What!

1322
01:15:00,885 --> 01:15:02,878
- Huh!
- Whoa! What did I miss.

1323
01:15:02,903 --> 01:15:05,483
- You got to fly those eggs to safety.
- I got this.

1324
01:15:05,508 --> 01:15:07,341
Here we go!

1325
01:15:10,622 --> 01:15:14,515
- Whoa. Whoooaaa.
- Yes! Yes. Yes!

1326
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:19,151
My eggs!

1327
01:15:19,176 --> 01:15:21,412
- Don't forget Chuck and Bomb.
- Who?

1328
01:15:21,437 --> 01:15:23,797
- Those guys.
- Right. Right.

1329
01:15:25,046 --> 01:15:26,702
Got you.

1330
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:34,566
You're not getting away that easy.

1331
01:15:38,015 --> 01:15:39,519
No!

1332
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,048
- Save yourselves.
- Hold on, Red!

1333
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:48,947
- I'm gonna save that egg.
- Red, don't be a hero.

1334
01:15:48,972 --> 01:15:51,419
- Red, no.
- No!

1335
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,039
Huh?

1336
01:15:56,064 --> 01:15:59,218
- Get out of town, everybody.
- Whoa.

1337
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,506
There's just so many of them,
we're outnumbered.

1338
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:04,376
What?
How many?

1339
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:06,033
Oh, not that many.
Just the right amount really.

1340
01:16:06,058 --> 01:16:07,888
No need to look back.
Just keep flying.

1341
01:16:07,913 --> 01:16:09,571
FASTER!

1342
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:12,503
- I'll take that!
- No, you won't!

1343
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,368
Give me that!

1344
01:16:16,917 --> 01:16:19,265
You just don't know
when to stop, do you?

1345
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:21,598
Here's a 2 word answer,
"Uh-uh!"

1346
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:24,830
Looks like your little
slingshot game ends here.

1347
01:16:24,855 --> 01:16:26,968
- Give me that!
- Not going to happen!

1348
01:16:26,993 --> 01:16:28,289
Huh!

1349
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:31,148
Oh no.

1350
01:16:32,203 --> 01:16:33,967
Get out of my way.

1351
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:38,758
- Every pig for himself.
- I quit!

1352
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:42,901
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1353
01:16:42,926 --> 01:16:45,933
I know what I got to do.
I got to blow up that ram.

1354
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:48,705
And that would be a good plan
if you were good at blowing up.

1355
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,385
I need to stop those planes!

1356
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,376
Remember me, Chuck.
Remember me.

1357
01:16:52,401 --> 01:16:55,073
Bomb's away!

1358
01:16:59,956 --> 01:17:02,817
- Oh, hi there.
- Here, chicky chicky chicky.

1359
01:17:02,842 --> 01:17:05,032
This little piggy popped!

1360
01:17:05,057 --> 01:17:07,239
This little piggy exploded.

1361
01:17:07,264 --> 01:17:09,641
And this little piggy went
wee, wee, wee,

1362
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,951
"I want my mother!"

1363
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,939
Come on, Bomb,
you can you do this!

1364
01:17:16,964 --> 01:17:19,363
Blow up.
Blow up.

1365
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,594
- Oh oh.
- Ah ha ha ha!

1366
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:25,775
Oh no.

1367
01:17:26,284 --> 01:17:29,871
Think explosive thoughts.
Surprise parties!

1368
01:17:30,737 --> 01:17:32,778
Yoga poses!

1369
01:17:33,705 --> 01:17:36,438
PIG CITY AIRPLANES!

1370
01:17:40,943 --> 01:17:44,078
I blew up, on purpose.

1371
01:17:44,211 --> 01:17:46,421
You're wrecking my house.
What's wrong with you?

1372
01:17:46,446 --> 01:17:48,893
- You wrecked my house!
- Your house was ugly!

1373
01:17:48,918 --> 01:17:50,894
Well, now we're even.

1374
01:17:57,578 --> 01:17:59,106
Strike!

1375
01:18:01,285 --> 01:18:03,081
Run!
Run!

1376
01:18:05,766 --> 01:18:07,861
Guys, look out!

1377
01:18:09,368 --> 01:18:11,409
Everyone, stand back!

1378
01:18:16,919 --> 01:18:18,419
Terence?

1379
01:18:18,707 --> 01:18:21,732
Put on your seat belts, everyone.
Trust me.

1380
01:18:26,671 --> 01:18:29,908
Well.
This is dynamite.

1381
01:18:36,848 --> 01:18:38,186
Aw.
There you are.

1382
01:18:38,211 --> 01:18:41,119
Not by the hair on
my chinny-chin-chin!

1383
01:18:44,295 --> 01:18:47,096
Delicious bird eggy wiggy.
Ooo.

1384
01:18:47,121 --> 01:18:48,614
You can't eat eggs!

1385
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:51,090
What are you going to do?
I'm a foodie.

1386
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:56,548
It's over.
You're finished, eyebrows.

1387
01:18:56,573 --> 01:18:58,988
Ah ha ha ha...!

1388
01:19:01,316 --> 01:19:04,997
Anger, is not always the answer!

1389
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:10,144
Well, you know what,
I guess you win.

1390
01:19:10,169 --> 01:19:11,634
What?

1391
01:19:12,057 --> 01:19:15,597
That was an awesome plan.
Mind blower.

1392
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:18,546
Really?
Well, thank you.

1393
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:21,880
You know, a lot of hard work
goes in my sinister plans.

1394
01:19:21,905 --> 01:19:23,398
It does.

1395
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:26,956
No, I mean your plan was great.

1396
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:29,527
But you didn't plan for THIS!

1397
01:19:46,357 --> 01:19:49,269
You have annoyed me
for the last time.

1398
01:19:49,294 --> 01:19:50,611
Yep.

1399
01:19:50,806 --> 01:19:52,073
Huh?

1400
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:56,529
FASTER!

1401
01:19:56,554 --> 01:19:58,551
Whoa!

1402
01:20:08,211 --> 01:20:10,441
Cramp.
Cramp.

1403
01:20:11,052 --> 01:20:12,852
- It's them!
- Look at that.

1404
01:20:12,877 --> 01:20:14,518
Are you seeing
what I am seeing?

1405
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,336
- It's Mighty Eagle.
- It's him!

1406
01:20:16,361 --> 01:20:18,603
Well. This guy looks
nothing like his statue.

1407
01:20:18,628 --> 01:20:21,082
- Honey.
- Our eggs!

1408
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,724
- Are you okay?
- Chuck, my man.

1409
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:39,162
- Did you see what I did back there?
- Yeah.

1410
01:20:40,991 --> 01:20:43,622
Oh.
This egg is a splitting image of you.

1411
01:20:43,647 --> 01:20:46,713
There, safe and sound.

1412
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:55,110
- Oh!
- Huh!

1413
01:20:55,135 --> 01:20:57,442
- Where is he?
- Red.

1414
01:20:58,450 --> 01:20:59,949
Where is he?

1415
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:10,060
Huh!

1416
01:21:10,085 --> 01:21:12,673
I think he might be dead.

1417
01:21:26,462 --> 01:21:28,552
Daddy!

1418
01:21:28,747 --> 01:21:32,345
- He's alive!
- He's alive!

1419
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,172
Woo-hoo!

1420
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,233
- Oh!
- What?

1421
01:21:50,346 --> 01:21:51,771
- Yeah!
- Oh ho ho!

1422
01:21:51,796 --> 01:21:53,320
I'm glad you're alive.

1423
01:21:53,345 --> 01:21:56,206
I thought you died
or defected to the pig's side.

1424
01:21:56,231 --> 01:21:59,090
- Hey, buddy, way to not be dead.
- Oh.

1425
01:21:59,115 --> 01:22:01,970
- It's good to see you guys.
- Come on.

1426
01:22:03,156 --> 01:22:06,380
- Yay!
- Yay!

1427
01:22:06,496 --> 01:22:09,022
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Glad you're back!

1428
01:22:09,242 --> 01:22:12,710
- You did it, great job!
- You're the bird!

1429
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,762
Sir.
Ma'am.

1430
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:23,239
I think these belong to you.

1431
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:25,954
Oh.
Oh.

1432
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:32,713
Thank you.

1433
01:22:33,494 --> 01:22:36,640
Oh, Crimson, Woody, Ash.

1434
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:38,108
- Who?
- Is he talking to us?

1435
01:22:38,133 --> 01:22:40,509
You learn your lessons well.

1436
01:22:40,534 --> 01:22:42,767
Come on, bring it in.

1437
01:22:42,946 --> 01:22:44,476
No.
I'm not the really affectionate type.

1438
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,702
Uh.
Okay

1439
01:22:46,727 --> 01:22:49,332
Does it feel like this is
crossing the line, anyone else?

1440
01:22:49,357 --> 01:22:51,568
- Yep.
- No.

1441
01:22:51,806 --> 01:22:54,633
- You're my prize pupils.
- Your prize what?

1442
01:22:54,658 --> 01:22:56,455
Ho ho, don't you see?

1443
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,846
I had to make you
lose faith in me.

1444
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:01,355
So you can learn to have
faith in yourself.

1445
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:04,159
- That's not really how it felt.
- Tell them, Rosie.

1446
01:23:04,184 --> 01:23:06,122
Yeah. I don't think
that's what happened, man.

1447
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,436
Oh look, he's blushing.

1448
01:23:09,733 --> 01:23:12,737
I'm not blushing,
I'm just red.

1449
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:18,962
Okay, who wants an autograph?

1450
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:28,622
Go get him.

1451
01:23:28,647 --> 01:23:29,913
Hoist it up.

1452
01:23:30,342 --> 01:23:31,757
Nice.

1457

Well done indeed.

1458
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,411
Wow.
Is that you right there, Red?

1459
01:23:52,436 --> 01:23:53,701
Aw, really?
Where?

1460
01:23:53,726 --> 01:23:56,686
No, they didn't have to...
Oh. Yeah.

1461
01:23:56,711 --> 01:23:59,885
That's funny. I don't remember
crying on my knees like that.

1462
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,160
But, you know,
it's nice.

1463
01:24:02,185 --> 01:24:05,482
Look at that.
They gave Mighty Eagle all the credit.

1464
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:08,503
They made him look so much
more handsome than you.

1465
01:24:08,528 --> 01:24:10,792
You know,
back when I was angry.

1466
01:24:10,817 --> 01:24:12,858
That would have
really ticked me off.

1467
01:24:12,883 --> 01:24:14,517
Ah, forget about that.

1468
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:16,506
You know what we should do?
Let's go to the village.

1469
01:24:16,531 --> 01:24:18,254
- Let's do it.
- No. Actually I love to go...

1470
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:20,050
... hang out with you guys.
But you know I got this thing.

1471
01:24:20,075 --> 01:24:21,771
And I have another thing
after that thing

1472
01:24:21,796 --> 01:24:24,737
- and there's all these things in a row.
- Would you look at that.

1473
01:24:26,825 --> 01:24:28,488
What the?

1474
01:24:41,883 --> 01:24:44,005
HOME TWEET HOME

1475
01:24:49,508 --> 01:24:53,807
Mr. Red.
Welcome back, to the village.

1476
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,931
Ta-da!

1477
01:25:22,515 --> 01:25:27,159
Mighty Mighty Red
You rescued me.

1478
01:25:27,184 --> 01:25:32,194
Defender of our homes and liberty.

1479
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:37,691
Bravery. Humility. Angery

1480
01:25:38,524 --> 01:25:45,335
Mighty Mighty Red
You Rescued Me

1481
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,008
Me...

1482
01:25:48,033 --> 01:25:54,813

1483

Lalalaa
Lalalalaaaaaaaaa.

1484
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,905
Oh my gosh.

1485
01:26:17,322 --> 01:26:19,928
How did you guys find
the time to pull this off?

1486
01:26:19,953 --> 01:26:22,174
This is why we went to
go get pedicure, isn't it?

1487
01:26:22,205 --> 01:26:24,706
Nope. We got pedicures
because we are worth it.

1488
01:26:24,731 --> 01:26:26,734
- I got gels.
- You guys are something else.

1489
01:26:26,759 --> 01:26:28,942
To be honest with you,
I'm going to miss the beach view.

1490
01:26:28,967 --> 01:26:30,441
But, so what.
It's still there.

1491
01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:33,374
It's just not... right there when
I wake up and look out my window.

1492
01:26:33,399 --> 01:26:35,910
Well, you can still look out your
window and see me and Bomb.

1493
01:26:35,935 --> 01:26:37,115
Right.

1494
01:26:37,154 --> 01:26:39,158
So you know,
pluses and minuses.

1495
01:26:39,183 --> 01:26:41,224
Okay, see you later.

1496
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:43,018
Oh.

1497
01:26:44,274 --> 01:26:48,136
- Well, this just got awkward.
- That's really insensitive.

1498
01:26:48,379 --> 01:26:49,954
Want to go get a bite?

1499
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:52,834
Forget it, let's just go home.

1500
01:26:55,859 --> 01:26:58,505
Guys, I'm just messing with you.

1501
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:00,165
Get in here!

1502
01:27:00,829 --> 01:27:03,135
- Ha ha ha ha! I knew it!
- Let's be roomies.

1503
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,931
Room mates. Boy, I can't wait
to make a chores list.

1504
01:27:05,956 --> 01:27:07,902
- Wait, hold on a second.
- I'll move my nest into the master bedroom.

1505
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:09,616
- Bomb, you can stay in the guest half.
- No no no...

1506
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:12,180
- Ah! Can we get a bunk nest?
- Oh, this is going to be perfect.

1507
01:27:12,205 --> 01:27:14,898
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Guys... No!

01:27:28,529 --> 01:27:30,032
Moving out.

1511
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:32,856

Coming right at you.

1512

Oh yeah.

Come on, Leonard.

1516
01:28:36,839 --> 01:28:41,730
Leonard can't dance.
He's hatching a new plan.

1517
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:50,628
Okay, maybe I'll dance
for just a sec.

1518
01:28:55,466 --> 01:28:56,413
- Woo!
- Yee-haw!

1519
01:28:56,438 --> 01:28:58,089
- Show them what you got, Red.
- Bomb, uh-uh.

1520
01:28:58,114 --> 01:28:59,784
- Come on, Red stuff.
- Nope.

1521
01:28:59,809 --> 01:29:01,750
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nice try.

1522
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:06,814
Oh.

1523
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,547
Okay.

01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:47,627
Wait.
What are we doing?

1527
01:29:51,814 --> 01:29:53,280
Watch out!
