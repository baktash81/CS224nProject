1
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,258
Hi, babe.

2
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,267
- I have something for you.
- What is it?

3
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,035
- Just a little something.

4
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:33,168
Here you go.

5
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,083
Oh. Johnny, it's beautiful.
Thank you.

6
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,523
- You wait right here.
- Mmm.

7
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:52,688
- I'm gonna try it on right now.
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:06,241
Wow. You look so sexy, Lisa.

9
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:14,809
- Isn't it fabulous?
- I would do anything for my girl.

10
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:20,090
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, hi, Denny.

11
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:26,661
- Wow. Look at you.
- It's from Johnny.

12
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,667
Anything for my princess.

13
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,000
- How much was it?
- Denny, don't ask a question like that.

14
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,667
Nice to see you, Denny.
I'm going to take a nap.

15
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,643
Can I go upstairs too?

16
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:44,842
Denny, I think I'm gonna join him.

17
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,185
I've got some candles upstairs.

18
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,619
You always think.

19
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:53,623
All right. I'm ready.

20
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,319
This is so great. I can't wait
for you to get it off of me.

21
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:58,919
Oh, yeah.

22
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,329
- You're in for it.
- Oh, yeah.

23
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,333
How much you pay for this dress?

24
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:05,528
Don't even ask.

25
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,112
Ooh.

26
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,249
Ouch.

27
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,814
Stop.

28
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,722
Stop. No, stop.

29
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,727
Get up.

30
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:41,231
Denny, do you have
something else to do?

31
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,239
I just like to watch you guys.

32
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,708
Oh, Denny, Denny. Denny boy.

33
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:50,578
Denny, two's great,
but three is a crowd.

34
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:57,516
- I get it. You guys wanna be alone.
- That's the idea.

35
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,685
Fine. I have homework to do anyway.

36
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:03,920
Bye, lovebirds.

37
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,259
- Bye, Denny.
- Bye, Denny.

38
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:27,813
Come here.

39
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:33,821
Oh, Lisa, you know. Oh, yeah.

40
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:49,139
It'd be a shame

41
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:54,110
Living in this world without you

42
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:58,478
There's nothing I
wouldn't do for you

43
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:03,077
You are my fantasy dream come true

44
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:11,195
When I see your face

45
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:15,528
It stirs up my emotions

46
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:19,593
Your style and grace

47
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:24,505
It inspires my devotion

48
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,909
There's nothing I
wouldn't do for you

49
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:33,280
You are my fantasy dream come true

50
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:36,718
Oh, oh

51
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:41,053
And I will stand in
the way of a bullet

52
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:45,425
I will run through
a forest of flames

53
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,864
I will climb
the highest of mountains

54
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:54,132
Just to show you I love you
I will

55
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,471
I will stand in the way of a bullet

56
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:02,877
I will run through
a forest of flames

57
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:07,213
I will climb
the highest of mountains

58
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:11,915
Just to show you I love you
I will

59
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:15,515
I will, I will

60
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:20,587
I will, I will

61
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,362
I will, I will

62
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:29,304
I will, I will

63
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:32,865
I will, I will

64
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:37,938
I will, I will

65
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,610
I will, I will

66
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,680
I will, I will

67
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:07,939
And I will stand in the way
of a bullet

68
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:12,244
I will run through
a forest of flames

69
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,650
I will climb
the highest of mountains

70
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:20,953
Just to show you I love you
I will

71
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,428
I will stand in the way of a bullet

72
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:34,905
- Oh.
- Mm.

73
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:50,346
Did you like last night?

74
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:53,246
Yes, I did.

75
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,251
Can I get you anything?

76
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:58,811
- Mm-mmm. I have to go now.
- Okay.

77
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:00,857
- Bye.
- Bye.

78
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,269
Hi, Mom. How are you?

79
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:17,539
I'm fine. How are you?

80
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:20,076
Hmm?

81
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,612
Okay. Let's go to the couch.

82
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,912
And we will sit down.

83
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,111
Now...

84
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,188
what's happening with you?

85
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:34,918
- Hmm?
- Nothin' much. Do you want some coffee?

86
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,358
What's wrong? Tell me.

87
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:39,453
I'm not feeling good today.

88
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,464
Well, why not?

89
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,767
I don't love him anymore.

90
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,337
Why don't you love him anymore?
Tell me.

91
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,839
He's so... boring.

92
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:52,569
You've known him for
over five years.

93
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:54,611
You're engaged.

94
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,442
You said you loved him.

95
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,347
He supports you.
He provides for you.

96
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,579
And, darling, you can't
support yourself.

97
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:08,182
He's a wonderful man, and
he loves you very much.

98
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:11,694
And his position is very secure.

99
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:15,823
And he told me he plans
to buy you a house.

100
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,959
That's why he's so boring.

101
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,436
- Well, what are you going to do?
- I don't know.

102
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:23,302
I don't mind living with him.

103
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,105
Well, you can't do that.
Have you talked to him about it?

104
00:11:27,112 --> 00:11:29,112
No.

105
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:33,583
- I don't know what to do.
- He's a wonderful person.

106
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:37,121
And he's getting a
promotion very soon.

107
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:39,122
He bought you a car.

108
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:42,625
He bought you a ring, clothes-
whatever you wanted.

109
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:46,322
Now you wanna dump him.
That's not right.

110
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,059
I've always thought of
him as my son-in-law.

111
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:54,065
You should marry Johnny.
He would be good for you.

112
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:58,074
- I guess you're right about that.
- Of course I'm right.

113
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:01,839
I know men.
I wasn't born yesterday.

114
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,278
I'm glad you're listening
to your mother.

115
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:06,350
Nobody else listens to me.

116
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,976
You're probably right
about that, Mom.

117
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:11,954
Well, I'm glad you're
listening to your mother.

118
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:14,183
Listen, I've gotta go.

119
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,887
But you remember what
I told you, okay?

120
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:19,896
Mm-hmm.

121
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:22,159
Bye-bye, now.

122
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,398
Thanks, Mom.

123
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,274
- Hello?
- Hey, baby. How you doin'?

124
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:40,647
Oh, hey. How you doin'? Yeah,
I'm very busy. What's goin' on?

125
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:42,652
I just finished talking to my mom.

126
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:44,722
She gave me this big
lecture about Johnny.

127
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,383
- We'll talk about it later.
I told you I'm very busy.
- We'll talk about it now.

128
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,462
Whenever you say we'll talk
about it later, we never do.

129
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:54,054
I can't wait till later.
I wanna talk right now.

130
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,065
You owe me one anyway.

131
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,533
Okay. All right, what do
you want to talk about?

132
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,536
She's a stupid bitch.

133
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:04,267
She wants to control my life.
I'm not gonna put up with that.

134
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:07,344
I'm gonna do what I wanna
do, and that's it.

135
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,345
What do you think I should do?

136
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:13,144
Why do you ask me? You've been
very happy with Johnny.

137
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:16,584
What do you want me to say?
You should enjoy your life.

138
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,020
What's the problem?

139
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:23,253
Maybe you're right.
Can I see you tomorrow?

140
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,921
Okay. All right. How about noon?

141
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,228
- I'll be waiting for you. Bye.
- All right, see ya.

142
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:53,620
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Hi. I'm fine. Come in.

143
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:01,097
Have a seat.

144
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,990
Thank you.

145
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,263
It's hot in here.

146
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,100
- Do you mind?
- No.

147
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:01,089
I mean, the candles...

148
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:03,820
the music, the sexy dress.

149
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:06,624
I mean, what's goin' on here?

150
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:22,502
I like you very much, lover boy.

151
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:26,049
What are you doin' this for?

152
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,385
What's the matter?

153
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,387
Don't you like me?

154
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,616
I'm your girl.

155
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,230
Johnny's my best friend.

156
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,233
You're gonna be married
next month. Come on.

157
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,365
Forget... about Johnny.

158
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,239
This is between you... and me.

159
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:09,758
I don't think so.
I-I'm leaving now.

160
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,694
Please don't leave.
Please don't leave.

161
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:15,857
I need you. I love you.

162
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:18,128
I don't wanna get married anymore.

163
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:22,570
I don't love Johnny.
I dream about you.

164
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:27,043
I need you to make love to me.

165
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,347
I don't think so.

166
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:37,148
Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise.

167
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:28,969
Oh. Oh, yeah.

168
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,800
Your touch

169
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:37,711
Pulling fire out of me

170
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,715
Your touch

171
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:43,844
Like a wave crashing on the sea

172
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,980
Your kiss

173
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,083
As gentle as a summer breeze

174
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:56,133
Your love is what I
need to set me free

175
00:17:57,735 --> 00:18:00,633
A rose

176
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:03,673
Is what

177
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:06,743
You are

178
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:09,870
To me

179
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,973
The smell

180
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:16,451
Of wonders

181
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:22,117
Oh, so sweet

182
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:25,218
- You are

00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:29,789

196
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,742
Oh, yes.

You are my rose

198
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:18,605

You are my rose

00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:33,863
You are my rose You are my rose

204
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:36,297
You are my rose

205
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,468
God. Why did you do this to me?

206
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,099
Why?

207
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,804
Johnny's my best friend.

208
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:52,983
Didn't you enjoy it?

209
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:56,253
That's not the point.

210
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:00,649
I love you, Mark.

211
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,427
Look, you're very attractive.
All right? You're beautiful.

212
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:10,596
But we can't do this anymore.

213
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,335
I can't hurt Johnny.

214
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,736
I know.

215
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:18,741
He's your best friend.

216
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,580
Hey. This'll be our secret.

217
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,018
Mmm.

218
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,042
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

219
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,510
Yeah. Can I have a dozen
red roses, please?

220
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:58,104
Oh, hi, Johnny.
I didn't know it was you.

221
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:01,548
- Here you go.
- That's me. How much is it?

222
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,177
- It'll be $18.
- Here you go. Keep the change.

223
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:06,279
- Hi, doggy.
- You're my favorite customer.

224
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,221
- Thanks a lot. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

225
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:18,235
Yeah. Deliver it.

226
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,565
Yeah. Deliver it.

227
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,901
555-4828.

228
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:26,008
Half Canadian bacon
with pineapple...

229
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,840
half artichoke with pesto,
and light on the cheese.

230
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:30,846
Thanks.

231
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:36,586
Who is it?

232
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:37,754
Denny.

233
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,584
Denny.

234
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,057
- Hey, Denny. How are you doing?
- I'm fine. What's new?

235
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,754
Actually, I'm really busy.
Do you want something to drink?

236
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:49,026
No, thanks. I just
wanna talk to Johnny.

237
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:52,495
You look beautiful today.

238
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:56,232
- Can I kiss you?
- You are such a little brat.

239
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,740
I'm just kidding.
I love you and Johnny.

240
00:21:58,743 --> 00:22:01,209
Okay, okay. Johnny's gonna
be here any minute.

241
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:04,440
- You can wait if you want.
- Mm, I gotta go.

242
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,743
- You'll tell him I stopped by.
- Of course I will.

243
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,751
- Bye.
- Bye, Denny.

244
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,964
Hi, babe. These are for you.

245
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,308
Thanks, honey. They're beautiful.

246
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,514
- Did you get your promotion?
- Nah.

247
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,892
You didn't get it, did you?

248
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:55,261
That son of a bitch told me that I
would get it within three months.

249
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:59,962
I saved them bundles. They're crazy.
I don't think I will ever get it.

250
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,766
They betrayed me. They
didn't keep their promise.

251
00:23:02,773 --> 00:23:05,433
They tricked me, and I
don't care anymore.

252
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:07,477
Did you tell them how
much you save them?

253
00:23:07,478 --> 00:23:11,014
Of course. What do you think?
They already put my ideas into practice.

254
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:15,984
The bank saves money, and they
are using me. And I am the fool.

255
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:18,554
I still love you.

256
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:22,490
- You're the only one who does.
- At least you have friends.

257
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:24,686
I didn't get any calls today.

258
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:28,629
You're right. The computer
business is too competitive.

259
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,030
Do you want me to order a pizza?

260
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,435
- Whatever. I don't care.
- I already ordered a pizza.

261
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,700
You think about everything.

262
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,834
What's the matter? You all right?

263
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:43,004
It's just a lousy promotion.

264
00:23:43,013 --> 00:23:47,948
You know what you need?
You need a drink.

265
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:50,885
I don't drink. You know that.

266
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,814
Don't worry about it.
It's good for you.

267
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,754
You must be crazy.
I can't drink this.

268
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:40,227
If you love me, you'll drink this.

269
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:50,641
You're right. It tastes good.

270
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:52,648
I know. I am right.

271
00:24:54,518 --> 00:24:57,143
Don't worry about those fuckers.
You're a good man.

272
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:59,449
Drink, and let's have some fun.

273
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,691
Mmm!

274
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:19,364
Oh!

275
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,306
You have nice legs, Lisa.

276
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,976
And you have nice pecs.

277
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:34,816
I'm tired. I'm wasted.
I love you, darling.

278
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,326
Come on. Make love to me.

279
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,727
Come on. You owe me one.

280
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,393
I love you, Lisa.

281
00:25:45,402 --> 00:25:47,402
I love you, Johnny.

282
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:09,891
Mm.

283
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:28,540
I see you walkin' by, yeah

284
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,443
I hear your lullaby

285
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:36,110
It seems to reel me in

286
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,915
Yeah, yeah

287
00:26:37,921 --> 00:26:40,717
You really got me good from

288
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,759
From just one little look now

289
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:48,594
All my mind can do is spin

290
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,533
I'm goin' crazy crazy
thinkin' about you

291
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:55,662
Crazy, so crazy about you

292
00:26:55,673 --> 00:27:00,836
Crazy, wantin' you with me

293
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:04,937
I'm goin' crazy crazy
thinkin' about you

294
00:27:04,948 --> 00:27:08,279
Crazy, so crazy about you

295
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:12,088
I need you here with me

296
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,110
I need you here with me

297
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,619
So, I'm organizing a party
for Johnny's birthday.

298
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:20,856
- Can you come?
- When is it?

299
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:23,797
Next Friday at 6:00.
It's a surprise.

300
00:27:23,801 --> 00:27:26,563
- Oh.
- You can bring someone if you want.

301
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:31,232
Well, sure, I can come, but I
don't know if I'll bring anybody.

302
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:34,333
Oh, that jerk, Harold.

303
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:37,642
He wants me to give him
a share of my house.

304
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:40,649
That house belongs to me.
He has no right.

305
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:43,015
I am not giving him a penny.

306
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,351
- Who does he think he is?
- He's your brother.

307
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:49,187
He is always bugging
me about my house.

308
00:27:49,193 --> 00:27:53,855
Fifteen years ago, we agreed
that house belongs to me.

309
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:57,593
Now the value of the house is going
up, and he's seeing dollar signs.

310
00:27:57,601 --> 00:27:59,794
Everything goes wrong at once.

311
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:04,602
- Nobody wants to help me, and I'm dying.
- You're not dying, Mom.

312
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:07,973
I got the results of the test back.

313
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,308
I definitely have breast cancer.

314
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,315
Look, don't worry about it.
Everything will be fine.

315
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,318
- Mm.
- They're curing lots of people every day.

316
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,513
I'm sure I'll be all right.

317
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:21,455
Oh. I heard Edward
is talking about me.

318
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:26,461
He is a hateful man. Oh, I'm
so glad I divorced him.

319
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:30,158
Look, don't worry about it.
You just concentrate on getting well.

320
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:34,135
Well, at least you have a good man.

321
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:38,299
You're wrong. Mom, he's
not what you think he is.

322
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:42,674
He didn't get his promotion,
and he got drunk last night.

323
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,838
And he hit me.

324
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,679
Johnny doesn't drink. What
are you talking about?

325
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,619
He did last night, and I
don't love him anymore.

326
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:54,850
Johnny is your financial security.

327
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,586
You can't afford to ignore this.

328
00:28:57,594 --> 00:29:00,424
Yeah, okay, Mom.
Can I just talk to you later?

329
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:02,829
You don't want to talk to me.

330
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:06,334
I just got done talking
with a client...

331
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:08,870
and I have to get
ready to meet him.

332
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,497
- Can I just talk to you later?
- Okay.

333
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:13,872
I will see you later.

334
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,445
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

335
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:39,128
How much time do we have?

336
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:42,330
I don't know. Uh, couple hours.

337
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:44,339
At least.

338
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:49,478
Well, let's have some fun.

339
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,673
Did you, uh, know...

340
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:58,380
that chocolate is
the symbol of love?

341
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:01,480
Feed me.

342
00:30:23,747 --> 00:30:25,747
Yum.

343
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:28,909
That's delicious.

344
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:33,079
Arms up.

345
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:44,390
Chocolate is a symbol of love.

346
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:11,828
Hello?

347
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,728
Hello?

348
00:31:15,732 --> 00:31:19,324
What are these
characters doing here?

349
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,837
- They like to come here to do their homework.
- What homework?

350
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,999
Mom, this is Michelle's
boyfriend, Mike.

351
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:30,102
Mike, this is my mother.

352
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:32,272
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Mm.

353
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:36,477
Uh-huh.

354
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:38,554
Oh.

355
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:45,584
All that shopping wore me out.

356
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:48,096
- Hey, Lisa.
- Hey, Denny.

357
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:52,032
Denny, this is my mom.
Mom, this is Denny.

358
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,036
How many people come in and out
of this apartment every day?

359
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,971
This is worse than
Grand Central Station.

360
00:31:57,975 --> 00:32:01,044
- I just need to borrow some sugar.
- Help yourself, Denny.

361
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,635
I also need a cup of flour and
a half a stick of butter.

362
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:07,774
- Doesn't your home have a kitchen?
- I'll come back later.

363
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:18,724
- Tell me, what does Denny do?
- Johnny wanted to adopt Denny.

364
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:23,129
It's really a tragedy how many
kids out there don't have parents.

365
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:26,430
When Denny turned 18, Johnny found him
a little apartment in this building...

366
00:32:26,436 --> 00:32:29,403
and he's paying for it until
he graduates from school.

367
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:33,408
Johnny really loves Denny even
though he doesn't say it much.

368
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,808
He's, like, a father figure to him.

369
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:39,746
I told you, Mom.Johnny is very
caring about the people in his life.

370
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,479
And he gave Denny his own
set of keys to our place.

371
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:46,522
Please, don't hurt Johnny.

372
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:51,253
Now, if you really don't love him,
so be it. But you should tell him.

373
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:54,593
I forgot my, uh, book.

374
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:58,031
Oh! What-What's this?

375
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:01,832
Oh. That's-That's nothing. Really.

376
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,368
Homework.

377
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:08,376
Don't worry about it.

378
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:11,345
If I were a burglar, you
would be my best friend.

379
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:13,348
Look, I don't wanna talk about it.

380
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,079
You know I worry about you.

381
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:20,623
- Oh. I have to go home.
- Okay, Mom.

382
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,427
Bye-bye.

383
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,963
Oh, my God.

384
00:33:54,257 --> 00:33:56,257
Hey, Denny.

385
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:58,384
Chris-R. I've been lookin' for you.

386
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,163
Yeah, sure you have.
You have my money, right?

387
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:06,224
Yeah. It's comin'. It'll
be here in a few minutes.

388
00:34:08,238 --> 00:34:10,704
What do you mean
it's coming, Denny?

389
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:13,776
Where's... my money?

390
00:34:13,777 --> 00:34:17,108
Okay. Just-Just give
me five minutes.

391
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:21,412
- Just give me five.
- Five minutes?

392
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,986
You want five fuckin'
minutes, Denny?

393
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:26,317
You know what? I haven't
got five fucking minutes!

394
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:31,426
I'm gonna ask you again, Denny.

395
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:34,156
- Where's my money?
- I don't have anything.

396
00:34:34,164 --> 00:34:36,164
Where's my money, Denny?

397
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:38,234
Where's my fucking money, Denny?

398
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:41,827
- What did you do with my fucking money?
- I swear to God. It's coming.

399
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:44,463
- Where's my fuckin' money, Denny?
- Put the gun down.!

400
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:46,542
My fucking money.!
Where's my fucking money, Denny?

401
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,543
What's with this guy? Get off!

402
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:52,775
You're fuckin' dead, Denny!

403
00:34:52,783 --> 00:34:57,047
What's going on here?
Somebody help!

404
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,054
- Let's take him to the police.
- You're fucking dead!

405
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,681
Denny. Are you okay?

406
00:35:02,692 --> 00:35:05,056
- What did that man want from you?
- Nothing.

407
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,061
Oh, that was not nothing.

408
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,963
- Tell me everything.
- You have no idea what kind of
trouble you're in here, do you?

409
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:14,468
- I owe him some money.
- What kind of money?

410
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:16,732
- I owe him some money.
- What kind of money?

411
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,502
- Everything is okay. He's gone.
- Everything is not okay.

412
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:21,702
Denny, that is a dangerous man.

413
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:23,574
Just calm down. He's going to jail.

414
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,013
- Denny, what kind of money? Just tell me!
- What do you need money for?

415
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:30,018
Mom, please! Denny's
with me and Johnny!

416
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,588
A man like that,
with a gun. My God!

417
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,022
Denny, look at me in the
eyes and tell me the truth.

418
00:35:36,026 --> 00:35:39,493
- We're your friends.
- I bought some drugs off of him.

419
00:35:39,496 --> 00:35:42,565
Things got mixed up. I
didn't mean this to happen.

420
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:45,658
- Denny!
- And I don't have them anymore.

421
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:48,932
- What kind of drugs, Denny?
- It doesn't matter. I don't have them anymore.

422
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,769
It doesn't matter? How in the hell
did you get involved with drugs?

423
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,673
Were you giving them to him?
Selling them to him?

424
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:58,043
- Where in the hell did you meet that man?
- What kind of drugs do you take?

425
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:01,174
- It's nothing like that.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

426
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:03,718
I just needed some money
to pay off some stuff.

427
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,720
How much do you have to give him?

428
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:07,949
- This is not the way you make money.
- How much?

429
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,958
Stop ganging up on me!

430
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,291
Well, it is time somebody ganged
up on you. For God's sake!

431
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,956
A man like that! Where in the hell
did you meet a man like that?

432
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:20,025
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters a great deal.

433
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:23,799
A man holds a gun on you. You almost got
killed. You expect me to forget that?

434
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,636
You're not my fucking mother!

435
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,711
- You listen to me, little boy!
- No, no! No, don't!

436
00:36:28,712 --> 00:36:31,940
Somebody had better do
something around here.

437
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:34,448
It's okay.

438
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:36,576
Are you okay, Denny?

439
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:38,813
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

440
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,981
What's okay? He's taking drugs.

441
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:44,925
- Come on, stop. It was a mistake.
- A mistake. That he takes drugs.

442
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,428
- Let's go home.
- Come on. It's clear.

443
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,159
- What's clear? I am going to call the police.
- Mom, stop.

444
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,827
- It was Denny's mistake. Just stop.
- Let's go.

445
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,428
- Why did you do this? You know better, right?
- I'm sorry.

446
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:58,439
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

447
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:01,135
You know better, Denny.
You almost got killed.

448
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:03,075
I'm sorry.

449
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:05,079
It won't happen again. I promise.

450
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:07,513
Denny, you know that
Johnny's like your father.

451
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,949
And we're your friends.
We're gonna help you.

452
00:37:12,122 --> 00:37:14,122
Let's go home.

453
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:16,192
I miss you.

454
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,850
I miss you.

455
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,361
I just saw you. What
are you talking about?

456
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,624
I just wanted to hear
your sexy voice.

457
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:25,326
I keep thinking about your
strong hands around my body.

458
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:27,596
It excites me so much.

459
00:37:27,604 --> 00:37:30,400
I love you.

460
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,407
Is Johnny there?

461
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:34,670
He's... in the shower.

462
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:38,646
I don't understand you.
Why do you do things like this?

463
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:41,546
Because I love you.
You just don't care, do you?

464
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,119
No, I do care.

465
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,656
But we agreed.
It's over between us.

466
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:49,987
I understand. It's our secret.

467
00:37:49,993 --> 00:37:52,254
But I still have feelings for you.

468
00:37:52,262 --> 00:37:55,854
- You just don't care.
- I do care.

469
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:58,433
I have to go now.
I'll see you later, darling.

470
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:01,368
- Don't call me that.
- Okay. Bye.

471
00:38:03,606 --> 00:38:04,238
I did not hit her. It's not true.

472
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,773
I did not hit her. It's not true.

473
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:09,538
It's bullshit! I did not
hit her. I did not.

474
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:11,546
Oh, hi, Mark.

475
00:38:11,548 --> 00:38:13,548
- Hey, Johnny. What's up?
- I have a problem with Lisa.

476
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,210
- She said that I hit her.
- What?

477
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:19,720
- Well, did you?
- No. It's not true. Don't even ask.

478
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:24,226
- What's new with you?
- I'm just sittin' up here thinkin', you know.

479
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:26,261
- I got a question for you.
- Yeah?

480
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,227
You think girls like
to cheat like guys do?

481
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:30,356
What makes you say that?

482
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:32,435
I don't know.

483
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,197
I'm just-I'm just thinkin'.

484
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:38,103
I don't have to worry about that,
because Lisa's loyal to me.

485
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,506
Yeah, man, you never know.

486
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,510
People are very strange these days.

487
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:46,673
I used to know a girl.
She had a dozen guys.

488
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:50,412
One of 'em found out, beat her up so bad she
ended up in a hospital on Guerrero Street.

489
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,353
What a story, Mark.

490
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:55,356
You can say that again.

491
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,622
I'm so happy I have you as my best
friend, and I love Lisa so much.

492
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,755
Yeah, man. Yeah, you
are very lucky.

493
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:04,766
Maybe you should have a girl, Mark.

494
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:09,032
Yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right.

495
00:39:10,206 --> 00:39:13,366
Maybe I have one already.
I don't know yet.

496
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:16,104
What happened?
Remember Betty? That's her name?

497
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:18,112
- Betty?
- Yeah.

498
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:21,809
Yeah, we don't see
each other anymore.

499
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:26,048
She wasn't any good in bed. She was
beautiful, but we had too many arguments.

500
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:29,523
That's too bad. My Lisa is
great when I can get it.

501
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:32,094
Aw, man. I just can't
figure women out.

502
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:34,993
Sometimes they're just too smart.

503
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,828
Sometimes they're flat-out stupid.

504
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,834
Other times they're just evil.

505
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:43,633
It seems to me like
you're the expert, Mark.

506
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,106
No, definitely not
an expert, Johnny.

507
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:48,177
What's bothering you, Mark?

508
00:39:51,948 --> 00:39:54,107
- Nothin', man.
- Do you have some secrets?

509
00:39:54,117 --> 00:39:56,117
- Forget it. Forget it, dude.
- Why don't you tell me?

510
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,449
- Is it some secret? Tell me.
- Forget it. I'll talk to you later.

511
00:39:58,455 --> 00:40:01,115
Well, whatever.

512
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,531
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hi, Denny.

513
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,864
- What's wrong with Mark?
- He's cranky today.

514
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,097
Girl trouble, I guess.

515
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:18,401
- What's new with you?
- Not much.

516
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:21,204
- Still goin' to the movie tonight?
- Oh, sure. We are.

517
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,279
What kind of movie
are we gonna see?

518
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:25,973
Well, we'll see-

519
00:40:25,982 --> 00:40:29,313
Denny, don't plan too much.
It may not come out right.

520
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:31,683
All right. Let's toss
the ball around.

521
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:33,983
Okay.

522
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:38,292
Gotta tell you about somethin'.

523
00:40:38,294 --> 00:40:40,658
Shoot, Denny.

524
00:40:40,663 --> 00:40:44,631
- It's about Lisa.
- Go on.

525
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:46,861
She's beautiful.

526
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,938
She looks great in her red dress.

527
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:55,401
- I think I'm in love with her.
- Go on.

528
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,036
I know she doesn't like me,
because sometimes she's mean to me.

529
00:40:58,047 --> 00:41:01,548
But sometimes, when
I'm around her...

530
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:04,085
I feel like wantin' to kiss her
and tell her that I love her.

531
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,348
I don't know.

532
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:08,390
I'm just confused.

533
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:12,393
Denny, don't worry about that.

534
00:41:12,395 --> 00:41:14,486
Lisa loves you, too, as a person...

535
00:41:14,497 --> 00:41:18,089
as a human being, as a friend.

536
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,635
You know, people don't
have to say it.

537
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:23,171
They can feel it.

538
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:25,434
What do you mean?

539
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:29,405
You can love someone
deep inside your heart...

540
00:41:29,412 --> 00:41:31,377
and there is nothing wrong with it.

541
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:33,676
If a lot of people
loved each other...

542
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:35,944
the world would be a
better place to live.

543
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:39,681
- Lisa's your future wife.
- Denny, don't worry about it.

544
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:43,281
You are part of our family,
and we love you very much.

545
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,384
And we'll help you anytime.

546
00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:49,261
And Lisa loves you,
too, as a friend.

547
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,424
You are sort of like her son.

548
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:53,468
You mean you're not upset with me?

549
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,595
No, because I trust
you, and I trust Lisa.

550
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:02,242
- What about Elizabeth, huh?
- Well-

551
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:08,615
- I love her.
- Mm-hmm.

552
00:42:08,618 --> 00:42:11,414
When I graduate from
college, get a good job...

553
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:13,421
I wanna marry her and
have kids with her.

554
00:42:13,423 --> 00:42:17,152
- That's the idea.
- You're right.

555
00:42:18,461 --> 00:42:20,552
Thanks for paying my tuition.

556
00:42:20,563 --> 00:42:22,790
You're very welcome,
Denny, and keep in mind...

557
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:26,232
if you have any problems,
talk to me, and I will help you.

558
00:42:26,236 --> 00:42:29,396
- Awesome. Thanks, Johnny.
- Let's go eat, huh?

559
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:31,939
Come on. Let's go.

560
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,703
Let's go, huh? I'm starving.

561
00:42:40,783 --> 00:42:41,517
So, how's Johnny?

562
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,551
So, how's Johnny?

563
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:47,749
- He didn't get his promotion.
- Oh. Is he disappointed?

564
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:51,816
Quite a bit. He got
drunk last night.

565
00:42:53,162 --> 00:42:56,959
- And he hit me.
- He hit you?

566
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:59,694
He didn't know what he was doing.

567
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,965
Are you okay?

568
00:43:02,972 --> 00:43:05,666
- Well, I don't wanna marry him anymore.
- What?

569
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:11,008
Johnny's... okay, but I
found somebody else.

570
00:43:11,014 --> 00:43:14,845
Lisa. This isn't right.

571
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:18,682
You're living with one guy, and
you're sleeping with another guy?

572
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:21,518
I'm doing what I wanna do.

573
00:43:21,524 --> 00:43:24,058
Well, who is he?

574
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,424
His best friend.

575
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,932
And he lives in this building.

576
00:43:30,933 --> 00:43:33,126
I can't believe you're
telling me this.

577
00:43:33,136 --> 00:43:35,864
It's Mark, isn't it?

578
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:38,736
Lisa, you know what?

579
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,571
You're just thinking
about yourself.

580
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:45,374
Somebody's gonna get hurt.
You've gotta be honest with Johnny.

581
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:48,678
I can't do that.
He would be devastated.

582
00:43:48,685 --> 00:43:51,379
If you care so much for
him, why cheat on him?

583
00:43:51,387 --> 00:43:54,718
Look, I really don't
know what to do.

584
00:43:54,724 --> 00:43:57,292
I love Mark.

585
00:43:57,293 --> 00:43:59,293
I don't have any more
feelings for Johnny.

586
00:43:59,295 --> 00:44:03,161
Johnny is so excited
about this wedding.

587
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:07,032
- I know.
- You've got to tell Johnny.

588
00:44:07,036 --> 00:44:09,764
No guilt trips.

589
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,931
You don't feel guilty
about this at all?

590
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,566
No. I'm happy.

591
00:44:15,845 --> 00:44:19,676
Something awful is gonna happen.

592
00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:22,910
Please don't tell anybody.

593
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:32,128
Don't worry. You can trust me.

594
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:35,629
Don't worry. You can trust me.

595
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,359
Your secret is safe with me.

596
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:44,440
Hello, Michelle. I heard you.

597
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,440
What secret?

598
00:44:46,442 --> 00:44:48,976
- It's between us women.
- Hi, Johnny.

599
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,205
Did you get a new dress?

600
00:44:51,214 --> 00:44:54,374
Um, well, I guess I'd
better be going.

601
00:44:54,384 --> 00:44:56,782
Uh, I'll just talk
to you guys later?

602
00:44:58,855 --> 00:45:00,855
Excuse me.

603
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,258
Lisa, remember what I told you.

604
00:45:16,773 --> 00:45:21,833
- What's she talking about?
- It's girl talk. I just told you that.

605
00:45:25,948 --> 00:45:31,076
I never hit you. You shouldn't
have any secrets from me.

606
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:34,588
I'm your future husband.

607
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,624
You sure about that?

608
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:38,751
Maybe I'll change my mind.

609
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:42,957
- Don't talk like that. What do you mean?
- What do you think?

610
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:45,329
Women change their
minds all the time.

611
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:48,301
You must be kidding, aren't you?

612
00:45:48,304 --> 00:45:50,304
I don't wanna talk about it.

613
00:45:50,306 --> 00:45:52,533
I'm gonna go upstairs and
wash up and go to bed.

614
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:55,372
How dare you talk to me like that?

615
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:59,107
- You should tell me everything.
- I can't talk right now.

616
00:45:59,115 --> 00:46:02,480
Why, Lisa? Why, Lisa?
Please talk to me.

617
00:46:02,485 --> 00:46:04,280
Please!

618
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,719
You're part of my life.
You're everything.

619
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,188
I could not go on
without you, Lisa.

620
00:46:09,192 --> 00:46:11,283
You're scaring me.

621
00:46:11,294 --> 00:46:14,022
You are lying! I never hit you!

622
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,690
You are tearing me apart, Lisa!

623
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:21,327
- Why are you so hysterical?
- Do you understand life?

624
00:46:21,337 --> 00:46:23,371
Do you?

625
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:35,383
Don't worry about it.
Everything will be all right.

626
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:37,543
You drive me crazy.

627
00:46:37,553 --> 00:46:40,315
Good night, Johnny.

628
00:46:40,323 --> 00:46:43,187
Don't worry about it.
I still love you.

629
00:46:43,192 --> 00:46:45,192
Good night, Lisa.

630
00:46:58,341 --> 00:46:58,772
- Hey, Johnny. What's goin' on, man?
- Hi, Mike. What's new?

631
00:46:58,773 --> 00:47:01,209
- Hey, Johnny. What's goin' on, man?
- Hi, Mike. What's new?

632
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,540
- How you doing?
- Um, actually, Johnny...

633
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:07,412
- I-I got a little bit of a tragedy on my hands.
- Uh-huh.

634
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:12,249
Yeah. Me and Michelle, we
were-we were makin' out.

635
00:47:12,255 --> 00:47:14,255
Uh, at your place.

636
00:47:14,257 --> 00:47:17,758
And, uh, Lisa and
Claudette sort of, uh...

637
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,725
walked in on us in
the middle of it.

638
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:22,923
- That's not the end of the story.
- Go on. I'm listening.

639
00:47:22,932 --> 00:47:26,763
We're goin' at it, and, um, I get
out of there as fast as possible.

640
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:29,497
I get my pants, I get my
shirt, and I get outta there.

641
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:32,005
Then about halfway down the
stairs, I realize that I-

642
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:34,804
I have misplaced-
I've forgotten something.

643
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,378
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, my underwear.

644
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,439
- I know.
- So, I come back to get it,
and I pretend I need a book.

645
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:44,519
I'm lookin' for my book. I reach in,
put the underwear in my pocket...

646
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,520
and sort of slide out real quick.

647
00:47:46,522 --> 00:47:48,920
Claudette-She saw it
sticking out of my pocket.

648
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:53,894
She pulls it out, and she's
showing everybody me underwears.

649
00:47:53,896 --> 00:47:55,931
You must be kidding.
Underwear-I got the picture.

650
00:47:55,932 --> 00:47:58,592
- Yeah. I don't know what-
- That's life.

651
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:00,601
- Hey, Johnny. Hey, Mike.
- Oh, hey, Denny.

652
00:48:00,603 --> 00:48:02,603
- What's up, buddy?
- Wanna play some football?

653
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:05,435
I gotta go see Michelle in a
little bit to make out with her.

654
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:07,668
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.
- Come on. Football.

655
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:10,610
- You think I'm-All right. Whatever.
- Let's go for it.

656
00:48:10,613 --> 00:48:13,113
- I'm goin' out.
- All right.

657
00:48:13,115 --> 00:48:15,843
- Yeah. Sorry you had to see that.
- I'm not sorry.

658
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,648
Your turn. Almost as much as I was.

659
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:22,724
- Studying, right?
- Come on, guys.

660
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:25,316
- I don't study like that.
- He doesn't.

661
00:48:27,964 --> 00:48:29,998
- Denny, what's up?
- What's up, Mark?
- Hi, Mark.

662
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:32,693
- Catch it.
- Not too much. What about you guys?

663
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:36,169
- Uh-
- He's just tellin' us
about an underwear issue.

664
00:48:36,172 --> 00:48:38,240
- Dude, it's-
- Underwear? What's that?

665
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,009
- It's embarrassing, man.
I don't wanna get into it.
- Underwear, man?

666
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,170
You okay?

667
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,180
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

668
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:48,182
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

669
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:51,617
- Do you want to see a doctor?
- No. No, no, no.

670
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:54,417
I'm good. I'm all right. I'm fine.

671
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:56,423
- I'll take him home.
- Why don't you take him home?

672
00:48:56,425 --> 00:48:59,027
Mike, listen. If you need anything,
call me. Anytime, all right?

673
00:48:59,028 --> 00:49:01,028
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

674
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,394
- See you guys.
- See you guys.

675
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:07,869
Let's go home, Denny.

676
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,541
You look really tired today, Mom.
Are you feeling okay?

677
00:49:14,543 --> 00:49:18,545
- I didn't get much sleep last night.
- Why not? What's wrong?

678
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:21,047
- You remember my friend, Shirley Hamilton?
- Uh-huh.

679
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:23,050
She wants to buy a new house...

680
00:49:23,052 --> 00:49:26,553
and so I asked Johnny if he could
help her with the down payment.

681
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:30,421
All he can tell me is,
"It's an awkward situation."

682
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,825
I expected your husband to
be a little more generous.

683
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:36,090
- He's not my husband.
- I know.

684
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,826
But Johnny is part of our family.

685
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:40,834
Mom, I don't love Johnny anymore.

686
00:49:40,836 --> 00:49:42,836
Ohh.

687
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:44,838
I don't even like him.

688
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,706
- I had sex with someone else.
- You can't be serious.

689
00:49:48,711 --> 00:49:52,338
- You don't understand.
- Who?

690
00:49:52,348 --> 00:49:54,348
Who is it?

691
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,647
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- You don't want to talk about it.

692
00:49:57,653 --> 00:50:01,484
- Then why did you bring
it up in the first place?
- I don't know.

693
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,490
You don't know.

694
00:50:03,492 --> 00:50:08,325
If you think I'm tired today,
wait till you see me tomorrow.

695
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,330
Coming to the party?

696
00:50:10,332 --> 00:50:12,559
Sure. I suppose so.

697
00:50:18,574 --> 00:50:18,974
How can they say this about me?

698
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:21,565
How can they say this about me?

699
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:23,577
I don't believe it.

700
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,579
I'll show them.

701
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:27,649
I'll record everything.

702
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,226
I don't understand women.

703
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,228
Do you, Peter?

704
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,230
What man does?

705
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,392
- What's the problem?
- They never say what they mean.

706
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:56,528
And they always play games.

707
00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:00,166
Okay, um, what do you mean?

708
00:52:00,176 --> 00:52:03,040
I have a serious problem with Lisa.

709
00:52:03,045 --> 00:52:05,579
Um, I don't think
she's faithful to me.

710
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,275
In fact, I know she isn't.

711
00:52:08,284 --> 00:52:10,852
Lisa? Are you sure?

712
00:52:10,853 --> 00:52:15,686
Yeah, I'm sure. I overheard a
conversation between Lisa and her mother.

713
00:52:15,691 --> 00:52:17,759
What should I do, Peter?

714
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:22,397
- This is Lisa we're talking about?
- Yeah.

715
00:52:22,398 --> 00:52:26,730
- I don't know what to say.
- But you are a psychologist.

716
00:52:26,735 --> 00:52:28,860
Do you have some advice?

717
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,867
It's a complicated
situation, Johnny.

718
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:40,014
I mean, you're my friend, and I don't
wanna get between you and Lisa.

719
00:52:42,017 --> 00:52:45,917
But look, if you want to,
you should confront her.

720
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:48,922
I can't confront her.

721
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:52,926
I want to give her a second chance.
After all, she's my future wife.

722
00:52:52,928 --> 00:52:56,589
You know what they say-
Love is blind.

723
00:52:58,534 --> 00:53:01,034
You got a lot of faith in Lisa.

724
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:04,596
Sometimes life gets complicated.

725
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:06,675
The unexpected can happen.

726
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,577
When it does, you just
gotta deal with it.

727
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:14,581
Did you hear the door?

728
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,651
Yeah. I did.

729
00:53:21,357 --> 00:53:24,483
- Oh, hi, Mark. Come in.
- Oh, hey, Johnny.

730
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,493
Hey, Peter.

731
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,563
We're just talking about women.

732
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,169
Women, man. Women just confuse me.

733
00:53:40,976 --> 00:53:44,239
I have a girl, but she's married.

734
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:47,474
She's very attractive.
It's just... It's driving me crazy.

735
00:53:47,483 --> 00:53:50,143
Why didn't you mention this before?
Is it anyone I know?

736
00:53:50,152 --> 00:53:54,416
- No, man. You don't know her.
- Can I meet her?

737
00:53:54,423 --> 00:53:58,254
I don't think so.
It's an awkward situation.

738
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:02,126
You mean she's too old, or you think
I would take her away from you?

739
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:05,166
Huh?

740
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:06,996
No.

741
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:09,502
I have my own problems.

742
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:12,005
Tell me about your
problems, Johnny.

743
00:54:12,007 --> 00:54:14,974
Peter, you always play
psychologist with us.

744
00:54:14,977 --> 00:54:19,138
Look, I'm just your friend,
and I'm just worried about you.

745
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:23,048
Lisa's teasing me about whether we
are going to get married or not.

746
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:25,677
And we didn't make
love in a while...

747
00:54:25,688 --> 00:54:27,688
and I don't know what to do.

748
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:31,226
You never really know. I mean-

749
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,227
Look, you should tell her
about your feelings. Okay?

750
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,229
You shouldn't hide 'em.

751
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,231
You two have been together forever.

752
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:42,702
- You can work out anything
as long as you talk about it.
- Not always.

753
00:54:42,705 --> 00:54:46,172
People are people. Sometimes they
just can't see their own faults.

754
00:54:46,175 --> 00:54:49,972
I'm thinking of moving to a bigger place,
man. I'm making some good money.

755
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:53,537
You should tell her the truth.
You're doing this for your girl, right?

756
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:56,140
You're right, Peter.

757
00:54:56,151 --> 00:54:59,516
- Is she getting a divorce, Mark?
- You guys are too much.

758
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:02,055
Hey, are you running Bay
to Breakers this year?

759
00:55:02,057 --> 00:55:04,887
- I am, sure.
- No, I'm not doing it this year.

760
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:08,861
Chicken, Peter.!
You're just a little chicken.!

761
00:55:08,864 --> 00:55:11,194
Cheep! Cheep-cheep-cheep cheep!

762
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,928
Who are you calling a chicken?

763
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,937
I just don't like all the weirdos.
There's too many weirdos there.

764
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,269
I-I-I don't mind.

765
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,275
Mark, do you remember the one
with the big tits? The blondie one?

766
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,778
- How about the one with the
bridal gown, with the sign?
- Oh, yeah... "Can you marry me?"

767
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:29,009
I thought I would
take her up on it.

768
00:55:29,018 --> 00:55:32,246
- I never ate so much.
- The barbecue chicken was delicious.

769
00:55:32,254 --> 00:55:34,754
Rice. That was cool.

770
00:55:34,757 --> 00:55:37,325
You guys prove my point-
You're both weird.

771
00:55:37,326 --> 00:55:39,326
You guys wanna play cards?

772
00:55:39,328 --> 00:55:42,090
No, we can't. I expect
Lisa any minute.

773
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:44,097
Come on, man. Who's the
king of the house?

774
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:48,101
You gotta establish these
guidelines before you get married.

775
00:55:48,103 --> 00:55:50,603
How did you ever meet Lisa?
You never told us.

776
00:55:50,606 --> 00:55:52,606
That's a very interesting story.

777
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:56,940
When I moved to San Francisco with
two suitcases, I didn't know anyone.

778
00:55:56,945 --> 00:55:59,741
I have-I hit Y.M.C.A...

779
00:55:59,748 --> 00:56:02,908
with a $2,000 check
which I couldn't cash.

780
00:56:02,918 --> 00:56:07,250
- Why not?
- Well, because it was an out-of-state bank.

781
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:10,257
Anyway, I was working
as a busboy in a hotel...

782
00:56:10,259 --> 00:56:13,692
and, uh-uh, she was sitting...

783
00:56:13,695 --> 00:56:15,695
drinking her coffee.

784
00:56:15,697 --> 00:56:17,992
She was so beautiful.

785
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,001
And I say "Hi" to her.
That's how we met.

786
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,333
So, what's the interesting part?

787
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:27,966
Well, the interesting part is that on
our first date, she paid for dinner.

788
00:56:27,976 --> 00:56:30,874
- What? No tips from your job?
- Whatever.

789
00:56:30,879 --> 00:56:34,244
Do you guys wanna eat something?

790
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:44,325
Hey, guys. What's going on?

791
00:56:44,326 --> 00:56:47,088
- Oh, hey, Lisa.
- Hi, Lisa.

792
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,161
- Where's Johnny?
- In the kitchen.

793
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,170
I gotta go.

794
00:56:57,172 --> 00:57:01,436
I didn't mean to chase you off.
Wish you'd stick around for a while.

795
00:57:01,443 --> 00:57:04,034
I gotta work early.

796
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:08,238
See ya.

797
00:57:20,362 --> 00:57:25,092
- Did you get your wedding gown yet?
- No. I've got plenty of time.

798
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,601
Are you sure you have plenty of time?
It's only a month away.

799
00:57:28,604 --> 00:57:31,605
It'll be fine. What are
you so worried about?

800
00:57:31,607 --> 00:57:33,607
Everything's okay.

801
00:57:33,609 --> 00:57:35,609
Johnny doesn't seem very excited.

802
00:57:35,611 --> 00:57:37,611
Is there a problem?

803
00:57:37,613 --> 00:57:40,682
There's no problem. Why do you ask?

804
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,180
I just want you and
Johnny to be happy.

805
00:57:44,186 --> 00:57:46,186
I am happy.

806
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:49,985
Look, Denny, I need to talk to
Johnny. Okay? I'll see you later.

807
00:57:49,992 --> 00:57:53,061
- Okay. Tell him I said hello?
- Yeah.

808
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,773
Hey, Mark. What's up?

809
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,775
Oh, hey, Peter.

810
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:11,744
It's a good place to
think up here, isn't it?

811
00:58:12,848 --> 00:58:16,042
What, man? You wanna
put me on the clock?

812
00:58:16,051 --> 00:58:18,142
What the hell is that?

813
00:58:20,022 --> 00:58:22,249
You want some? It's good, bro.

814
00:58:22,257 --> 00:58:25,793
You know I don't smoke that stuff.

815
00:58:31,033 --> 00:58:33,101
You look depressed.

816
00:58:34,503 --> 00:58:38,004
I got this sick feeling
in my stomach, man.

817
00:58:38,006 --> 00:58:40,734
I did something awful.

818
00:58:40,742 --> 00:58:43,811
I don't think I can forgive myself.

819
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:47,415
Tell me about it.

820
00:58:50,185 --> 00:58:52,810
I just feel like-like running...

821
00:58:55,224 --> 00:58:57,849
killing myself.

822
00:58:57,859 --> 00:58:59,893
Something crazy like that.

823
00:58:59,895 --> 00:59:01,895
Why are you smoking that crap?

824
00:59:01,897 --> 00:59:05,262
It's no wonder you can't think straight.
It's gonna screw with your head.

825
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:09,836
It's none of your business, man.

826
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,838
You think you know everything.

827
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,841
- You don't know shit.
- Wait a second. Who do you think you are?

828
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:17,343
You're acting like a kid.
Just grow up.

829
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,346
Who you calling a kid? Fuck you!

830
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:22,417
Just chill out, Mark.
I'm just trying to help.

831
00:59:25,087 --> 00:59:28,088
You're having an affair
with Lisa, aren't you?

832
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,158
- Am I wrong?
- What?

833
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,322
What are you, nuts?

834
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,070
Sorry.

835
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:46,072
I'm sorry, man. Are you okay?

836
00:59:46,074 --> 00:59:48,074
Yeah, I'm fine.

837
00:59:48,076 --> 00:59:51,077
Let's just talk about your problem.

838
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:53,147
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

839
01:00:00,455 --> 01:00:02,648
Goddamn it, man. Fuck!

840
01:00:02,658 --> 01:00:05,989
Why do you want to
know my secret, man?

841
01:00:05,994 --> 01:00:07,994
Well, you're right.

842
01:00:07,996 --> 01:00:09,996
It's Lisa.

843
01:00:09,998 --> 01:00:12,396
I don't know what to do, man.

844
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,402
I'm so depressed. It's all her fault.
She's such a manipulative bitch!

845
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,904
- How the hell did you let this happen?
- Fuck!

846
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:20,907
You know this is gonna ruin
your friendship with Johnny.

847
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,705
What were you thinking?

848
01:00:23,712 --> 01:00:26,372
All right, you want my advice?

849
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:29,109
Sometimes life can
get complicated...

850
01:00:29,117 --> 01:00:31,276
and you've gotta be responsible.

851
01:00:31,286 --> 01:00:35,288
So you don't see Lisa again, and you
definitely don't sleep with her again.

852
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,187
Just find yourself another girl.

853
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:39,089
She's a sociopath.

854
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:42,857
She only cares about herself.
She can't love anyone.

855
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:47,034
Whatever, Peter. Come on.

856
01:00:59,414 --> 01:00:59,612
Oh, thank you. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

857
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:01,978
Oh, thank you. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

858
01:01:01,983 --> 01:01:04,244
Oh, hi, Denny.

859
01:01:04,252 --> 01:01:06,252
Nice tux! You look great!

860
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:08,254
You look really handsome.

861
01:01:08,256 --> 01:01:11,723
- Your wedding picture's gonna look great.
- Oh, thanks.

862
01:01:15,197 --> 01:01:17,197
Hey, Peter. Come on in.

863
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:19,199
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Peter. Come in.

864
01:01:19,201 --> 01:01:21,201
- You look good too.
- Sit down.

865
01:01:26,441 --> 01:01:29,032
- Whoa!
- Whoa.!

866
01:01:29,044 --> 01:01:31,704
Hey, guys.

867
01:01:31,713 --> 01:01:34,179
- You like it?
- Yeah. It looks good.

868
01:01:34,182 --> 01:01:37,183
You look great. You look
like a baby-face now.

869
01:01:37,185 --> 01:01:39,685
You guys wanna play some football?

870
01:01:39,688 --> 01:01:42,689
In tuxes? No. You gotta be kidding.

871
01:01:42,691 --> 01:01:45,191
- Come on, Mark. Let's do it.
- I'm up for it.

872
01:01:45,193 --> 01:01:47,193
- Johnny?

873
01:01:47,195 --> 01:01:49,195
- Ask Peter.
- Come on, Peter!

874
01:01:49,197 --> 01:01:51,197
- No, I don't think so.
- Please?

875
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:53,199
- Nope.
- Come on!

876
01:01:53,201 --> 01:01:56,134
- No.
- Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!

877
01:01:56,138 --> 01:01:56,171
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

878
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:58,501
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

879
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:00,768
Catch, Johnny! Whoo!

880
01:02:00,776 --> 01:02:02,776
Yeah! Nice snag!

881
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:05,039
All right, Peter!

882
01:02:05,046 --> 01:02:07,046
Here we go, Mark!

883
01:02:07,048 --> 01:02:09,207
Come on! Come on! Come on!

884
01:02:09,217 --> 01:02:11,217
- Ohh!
- Yeah!

885
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:12,980
- Catch, Mark!
- Go.

886
01:02:12,988 --> 01:02:14,988
Go deep!

887
01:02:19,628 --> 01:02:21,628
Gee, Peter, you're clumsy.

888
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,630
All right, that's it. I'm done.

889
01:02:23,632 --> 01:02:26,565
Great idea, Denny.

890
01:02:51,193 --> 01:02:54,524
I'm gonna get a slice of
cheesecake and a bottle of water.

891
01:02:54,529 --> 01:02:57,530
I'll have a large peanut butter whip
with extra whipped cream, please.

892
01:02:57,532 --> 01:03:01,090
- All right.
- And I'll take some cheesecake and a coffee.

893
01:03:01,102 --> 01:03:04,603
Okay. Have a seat. We'll
have that right out for you.

894
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:07,607
Hi. How you doing?
What would you like?

895
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:10,837
- Can I get a bagel and an Americana?
- Great. Sure.

896
01:03:10,846 --> 01:03:13,847
I'm gonna get a slice of
cheesecake and a bottle of water.

897
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:16,850
Sounds good. Have a seat.
We'll have that right out for you.

898
01:03:16,852 --> 01:03:19,284
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Johnny. How are you?

899
01:03:19,287 --> 01:03:22,515
- Good to see you. What would you like?
- Hot chocolate, please.

900
01:03:22,524 --> 01:03:24,524
- What size?
- Medium, please.

901
01:03:24,526 --> 01:03:26,856
- How about you?
- I'll have the mint tea.

902
01:03:26,862 --> 01:03:28,862
- Medium also?
- Yeah.

903
01:03:28,864 --> 01:03:30,932
Go sit down. We'll be right there.

904
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:35,903
I'm so tired of girls' games.

905
01:03:35,904 --> 01:03:37,904
What happened now, Mark?

906
01:03:37,906 --> 01:03:41,601
Relationships never work.
I don't know why I waste my time.

907
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:44,304
What makes you say that?

908
01:03:44,312 --> 01:03:46,380
It's not that easy, Johnny.

909
01:03:46,381 --> 01:03:50,008
Well, you should be happy, Mark.

910
01:03:50,018 --> 01:03:52,916
Yeah, I know. Life is too short.

911
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:55,421
- Oh, thank you, Susan.
- You're welcome.

912
01:03:55,423 --> 01:03:57,423
How 'bout somethin'
like cheesecake?

913
01:03:57,425 --> 01:03:59,425
- No.
- Not today.

914
01:03:59,427 --> 01:04:01,495
It's real good. All right.

915
01:04:02,531 --> 01:04:05,191
- How was work today?
- Oh, pretty good.

916
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,929
We got a new client, and the
bank will make a lot of money.

917
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:12,438
- What client?
- I cannot tell you. It's confidential.

918
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,940
- Aw, come on. Why not?
- No, I can't.

919
01:04:14,943 --> 01:04:16,943
Anyway, how's your sex life?

920
01:04:16,945 --> 01:04:19,309
I can't talk about it.

921
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,938
Why not?

922
01:04:20,949 --> 01:04:23,950
- Take your time.
- Oh, God, I have to run.

923
01:04:23,952 --> 01:04:25,952
- Already?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

924
01:04:25,954 --> 01:04:27,954
- It's on me.
- See you, Mark.

925
01:04:27,956 --> 01:04:30,115
- You wanna go jogging?
- Sure. What time?

926
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:32,420
- Golden Gate Park, 6:30.
- Right on.

927
01:04:32,427 --> 01:04:34,051
- All right? See ya.
- Okey dokey, pal.

928
01:04:50,211 --> 01:04:52,211
What's going on here?

929
01:04:52,213 --> 01:04:54,873
I like you very much, Mark.

930
01:04:54,883 --> 01:04:57,884
Come on. Johnny's my best friend.

931
01:04:57,886 --> 01:04:59,886
Just one more time.

932
01:05:21,943 --> 01:05:24,876
I couldn't picture

933
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:29,143
Spending life with anyone but you

934
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:33,880
And we wouldn't be here

935
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:38,652
If it weren't for all the
things we've been through

936
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,059
And my heart wouldn't beat if

937
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,063
Oh, yeah.

938
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,497
If you didn't come and save me

939
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:48,899
With your love

940
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:53,372
You are the reason I breathe

941
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:57,912
You are my everything

942
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:01,004
In your eyes I can see

943
01:06:01,016 --> 01:06:05,018
Baby, you are the one for me

944
01:06:06,388 --> 01:06:09,753
I can't imagine

945
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:15,592
Sharing love with no one
in this world but you

946
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,791
It's so exciting

947
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,232
When you're here with me

948
01:06:21,236 --> 01:06:24,601
And I am here with you

949
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,732
My heart couldn't beat if

950
01:06:27,742 --> 01:06:33,803
If it wasn't for your
warm and tender touch

951
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:38,249
You are the reason I breathe

952
01:06:38,253 --> 01:06:42,756
You are my everything

953
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:45,758
In your eyes I can see

954
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,456
Baby, you are the one for me

955
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,434
Even though at times

956
01:06:54,436 --> 01:06:57,164
It's been hard

957
01:06:57,172 --> 01:07:01,106
We've conquered winds and storms

958
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:06,203
And our hearts will always be one

959
01:07:06,214 --> 01:07:12,378
Until the very end

960
01:07:12,387 --> 01:07:13,031
Very end

961
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:18,823
Ohh

962
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:23,227
You are the reason I breathe

963
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:27,665
You are my everything

964
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:30,932
In your eyes I can see

965
01:07:30,939 --> 01:07:36,671
Baby, you are the one for me

966
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:41,010
You are the reason I breathe

967
01:08:14,415 --> 01:08:16,608
- Hey.
- Hey, Johnny. How's it going?

968
01:08:16,618 --> 01:08:18,879
Really good.

969
01:08:22,457 --> 01:08:25,048
- What's going on, Johnny?
- Not much.

970
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,184
Oh, yeah!

971
01:08:27,195 --> 01:08:29,195
Throw it, dude. Throw it.

972
01:08:29,197 --> 01:08:31,891
- What's new with you, man?
- Not much, man.

973
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,900
- Catch this!
- All right!

974
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:36,630
Whoo-hoo! Whee! Ooh-whee!

975
01:08:36,638 --> 01:08:38,638
Boom!

976
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,265
Oh! Oh, yeah!

977
01:08:41,276 --> 01:08:43,344
Catch this, Johnny!

978
01:08:45,713 --> 01:08:47,747
Right on, man.

979
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:51,307
- What's new with you, man?
- I'm doin' good.

980
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:53,319
- How's your work?
- Things are good.

981
01:08:53,321 --> 01:08:55,321
Try and catch me! Come on-Ohh!

982
01:08:55,323 --> 01:08:57,323
Ha-ha! I got you!

983
01:08:57,325 --> 01:08:59,256
- Oh, man!
- There you go!

984
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,594
Who is it?

985
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,600
Delivery man.

986
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:10,102
It's me, Lisa. Come on. Open up.

987
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,172
Come on in.

988
01:09:15,476 --> 01:09:17,544
Hey, Mark.

989
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:25,181
Wow. So, uh, you gonna be ready?

990
01:09:25,186 --> 01:09:27,186
How do you mean that?

991
01:09:27,188 --> 01:09:29,188
I'm always ready... for you.

992
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,690
I mean for the party.

993
01:09:31,693 --> 01:09:33,693
We have plenty of time.

994
01:09:33,695 --> 01:09:36,389
All I have to do
is put on my party dress.

995
01:09:39,734 --> 01:09:41,995
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

996
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:44,071
Nothing.

997
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:50,877
You're so beautiful.

998
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:08,225
- Hurry up. I have to open the door.
- Wait! Hang on. Hang on.

999
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,567
Come on in. It's open.

1000
01:10:18,306 --> 01:10:20,067
Hi!

1001
01:10:20,074 --> 01:10:22,074
I brought the stuff.

1002
01:10:22,076 --> 01:10:24,610
I knew I could count on you.

1003
01:10:24,612 --> 01:10:26,805
Hi, Mark. X-Y-Z.

1004
01:10:26,814 --> 01:10:28,745
What are you talking about?

1005
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:31,114
Examine your zipper.

1006
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,854
You guys are too much.

1007
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:36,924
So, what can I do to help?

1008
01:10:39,327 --> 01:10:41,520
I gotta go.

1009
01:10:49,971 --> 01:10:53,370
- Come on and help me move the coffee table.
- Okay.

1010
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,344
What was he doing here?

1011
01:10:57,345 --> 01:11:00,346
Ah, he just brought by
some take-out.

1012
01:11:00,348 --> 01:11:02,848
What about his zipper?

1013
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,077
What about his zipper?

1014
01:11:08,957 --> 01:11:11,457
Leave him alone. He's a good guy.

1015
01:11:11,459 --> 01:11:13,288
Did you tell Johnny yet?

1016
01:11:13,294 --> 01:11:16,989
No. Mark's his best friend.

1017
01:11:16,998 --> 01:11:19,566
Tricky, tricky.

1018
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:22,795
You know,
I really loved Johnny at first.

1019
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,738
Everything's changed.

1020
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,502
I need more from life
than what Johnny can give me.

1021
01:11:28,509 --> 01:11:30,201
Suddenly my eyes are wide open...

1022
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:32,211
and I can see
everything so clearly.

1023
01:11:32,213 --> 01:11:33,837
I want it all.

1024
01:11:33,848 --> 01:11:36,644
You think you can
get it all from Mark?

1025
01:11:36,651 --> 01:11:41,381
If he can't give me what I want,
somebody else will.

1026
01:11:41,389 --> 01:11:44,014
Lisa, you're sounding
just like your mother.

1027
01:11:44,025 --> 01:11:46,093
You're being so manipulative.

1028
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:48,594
So what? You can
learn something from me.

1029
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:51,597
You have to take
as much as you can.

1030
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,190
You have to live, live, live.

1031
01:11:54,202 --> 01:11:57,271
Don't worry about me.
I have everything covered.

1032
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:00,101
Your point of view
is so different from mine.

1033
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:02,768
Look, I don't wanna talk about it.

1034
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:08,413
People are gonna be getting here soon,
and we have to finish.

1035
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:10,484
Lisa.

1036
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:14,287
I don't see what the big deal is.

1037
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:18,218
Doesn't everybody
look out for number one?

1038
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:22,559
Don't I deserve the best?

1039
01:12:23,998 --> 01:12:27,795
I couldn't do that.
You're too much for me, Lisa.

1040
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:30,803
You know, you're not
such an angel yourself.

1041
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:34,033
Yeah, but we're not
talking about me, are we?

1042
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:38,777
Stop it!
Are you trying to ruin my party?

1043
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:47,820
- Live fast, die young, man.
- Yeah, you're right.

1044
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:50,982
- Live fast, die young, man.
- Yeah, you're right.

1045
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:54,289
- Yeah. That's the idea.
- Yeah!

1046
01:12:56,297 --> 01:12:58,365
Catch me! Come on!

1047
01:13:08,209 --> 01:13:10,675
I'm looking at this property
in Sausalito.

1048
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,678
How are the loans like these days?

1049
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,408
Pretty good. Yeah.
You'll be qualified.

1050
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:17,416
- You serious?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1051
01:13:17,418 --> 01:13:20,749
- When can we meet about that?
- We can talk about this tomorrow.

1052
01:13:20,755 --> 01:13:22,755
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

1053
01:13:22,757 --> 01:13:25,758
- I can come in, like, in the late afternoon?
- Absolutely. 8:00?

1054
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,455
Really? Right on. That's great.

1055
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:08,735
Bye, Lisa.

1056
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:15,007
Oh, hi, Claudette.

1057
01:14:15,009 --> 01:14:17,009
- Oh!
- Bye!

1058
01:14:17,011 --> 01:14:20,012
- Uh-huh!
- Hello, Mom. How are you?

1059
01:14:20,014 --> 01:14:22,480
I'm okay. How are you?

1060
01:14:22,483 --> 01:14:26,041
I'm fixing the apartment for Johnny's birthday,
but I'm really not into it.

1061
01:14:26,053 --> 01:14:28,053
Oh? Why not?

1062
01:14:28,055 --> 01:14:30,248
'Cause I'm in love with Mark,
not Johnny.

1063
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:33,384
And here I am planning his party.

1064
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:35,394
It's not right, Lisa.

1065
01:14:35,396 --> 01:14:38,397
I still think
you should marry Johnny.

1066
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:41,195
Now, you can't live on love.

1067
01:14:41,202 --> 01:14:43,361
You need financial security.

1068
01:14:43,371 --> 01:14:45,939
But I'm not happy.

1069
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,600
He still thinks
I'm gonna marry him next month.

1070
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,199
He's a fool.

1071
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,204
You expect to be happy.

1072
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:58,217
I haven't been happy
since I married my first husband.

1073
01:14:58,219 --> 01:15:01,618
I didn't even want
to marry your father.

1074
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,622
You never told me that.

1075
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:06,249
Well, it's true.
All men are assholes.

1076
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:10,797
Men and women use and abuse each other
all the time. There's nothing wrong with it.

1077
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,560
Marriage has nothing
to do with love.

1078
01:15:13,568 --> 01:15:16,432
Johnny's okay, I suppose.

1079
01:15:16,437 --> 01:15:18,129
Actually...

1080
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:21,106
I have him wrapped
around my little finger.

1081
01:15:21,108 --> 01:15:23,039
You should be happy then.

1082
01:15:23,044 --> 01:15:26,307
But I don't love him.

1083
01:15:27,748 --> 01:15:31,784
Don't throw your life away just
because you don't love him.

1084
01:15:31,786 --> 01:15:33,877
That's ridiculous!

1085
01:15:33,888 --> 01:15:37,389
You need to grow up,
and you need to listen to me.

1086
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:40,119
Okay.
Mom, I'll see you at the party.

1087
01:15:40,127 --> 01:15:43,321
- I just need to be alone right now.
- Mmm.

1088
01:15:48,402 --> 01:15:51,164
Bye-bye, my precious.

1089
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:33,507
Surprise!

1090
01:16:36,183 --> 01:16:40,185
Happy birthday to you

1091
01:16:40,187 --> 01:16:45,020
- Happy birthday to you
- Hey. Oh, wow!

1092
01:16:45,026 --> 01:16:48,061
Happy birthday, dear Johnny

1093
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,858
Wow. All right.
Thank you, thank you.

1094
01:16:50,865 --> 01:16:54,662
- Happy birthday to you
- All right, I'm blushing.

1095
01:16:56,671 --> 01:17:00,138
- Cheers!
- Happy birthday!

1096
01:17:00,141 --> 01:17:03,733
Thank you. You guys pre-Hey!

1097
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:07,302
- So, were you surprised?
- Yeah, I'm surprised. That's right.

1098
01:17:07,315 --> 01:17:09,315
Well-

1099
01:17:09,317 --> 01:17:12,318
Thanks a lot again.
Thank you. Thanks. Hey!

1100
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,854
Wanna drink this one?

1101
01:17:14,855 --> 01:17:16,855
Yeah, later. Later.

1102
01:17:16,857 --> 01:17:19,084
- Later?
- Yes.

1103
01:17:55,262 --> 01:17:58,422
That's, like, the third time
you've told me that joke tonight.

1104
01:17:58,432 --> 01:18:01,865
Now, listen, have you given
any more thought to-

1105
01:18:07,108 --> 01:18:10,644
- I know you think I'm awfully bold-
- No, it's okay.

1106
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:13,144
Well, you know, I don't
want to be a pest...

1107
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:15,579
but we have to help her.

1108
01:18:17,218 --> 01:18:19,286
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1109
01:18:26,127 --> 01:18:28,923
I'm just f-

1110
01:18:28,929 --> 01:18:30,929
Okay.

1111
01:18:30,931 --> 01:18:33,431
That's what friends are for.

1112
01:18:36,937 --> 01:18:39,938
It's up to us, as her friends...

1113
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,941
to give her a little
boost when she needs it.

1114
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:46,171
That's all I had to say.
One of my little speeches.

1115
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:52,609
Hey, everybody, let's go
outside for some fresh air.

1116
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:55,621
Yeah.! Yeah.!

1117
01:18:55,623 --> 01:18:57,691
Yeah.

1118
01:19:10,738 --> 01:19:12,738
Wait.

1119
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:15,240
I have something I wanna show you.

1120
01:19:15,242 --> 01:19:17,071
Oh, really?

1121
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:27,252
So, uh, what do you
want to show me?

1122
01:19:27,254 --> 01:19:29,481
It's a surprise.

1123
01:19:38,098 --> 01:19:41,998
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
Everybody's here.

1124
01:19:42,002 --> 01:19:44,002
No, they're not.

1125
01:19:44,004 --> 01:19:46,004
They're all outside.

1126
01:19:48,008 --> 01:19:51,077
You devil. You planned
this all along.

1127
01:19:54,982 --> 01:19:57,516
What's going on here?

1128
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:01,677
Why are you doing this?

1129
01:20:05,659 --> 01:20:07,659
I love him.

1130
01:20:07,661 --> 01:20:09,422
I don't believe it.

1131
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,430
You don't understand anything.

1132
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,057
Leave your stupid
comments in your pocket!

1133
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:20,101
Do you understand
what you're doing?

1134
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:23,608
You're going to destroy Johnny.
He's very sensitive.

1135
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:26,009
I don't care.

1136
01:20:26,013 --> 01:20:28,081
I'm in love with Mark.

1137
01:20:28,082 --> 01:20:31,879
How can you do this?
You make me sick.

1138
01:20:33,521 --> 01:20:35,714
Hey!

1139
01:20:35,723 --> 01:20:38,792
Thank you, honey.
This is a beautiful party.

1140
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,383
You invited all my friends.
Good thinking!

1141
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:43,395
You're welcome, darling.

1142
01:20:43,397 --> 01:20:46,125
- You know how much I love you.
- I do.

1143
01:20:49,436 --> 01:20:51,436
It's getting really hot in here.

1144
01:20:51,438 --> 01:20:53,699
- Why don't we go back outside.
- Uh-huh.

1145
01:20:53,707 --> 01:20:56,503
Okay.

1146
01:21:24,872 --> 01:21:28,533
Hey, everybody! I have
an announcement to make!

1147
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:31,110
We're expecting!

1148
01:21:32,046 --> 01:21:34,114
That's great!

1149
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:38,509
Hey! Thank you.

1150
01:21:40,654 --> 01:21:43,154
Lisa, I have to talk to you.

1151
01:21:47,394 --> 01:21:50,486
You have got to be
honest with Johnny.

1152
01:21:50,497 --> 01:21:53,361
I agree with that.

1153
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,367
Look, I'm gonna tell him. Okay?

1154
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:58,370
I just-I don't want
to ruin his birthday.

1155
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,633
When is the baby due?

1156
01:22:01,976 --> 01:22:04,977
- There is no baby.
- What?
- What?

1157
01:22:04,979 --> 01:22:07,240
W-What are you talking about?

1158
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:14,219
I told him that to
make it interesting.

1159
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:18,485
We're probably gonna have
a baby eventually anyway.

1160
01:22:18,492 --> 01:22:21,060
You're not gonna tell
Johnny, are you?

1161
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,686
Lisa, are you feeling okay?

1162
01:22:23,697 --> 01:22:26,357
Because this is just
getting worse and worse.

1163
01:22:26,367 --> 01:22:29,493
I feel like I'm sitting on an atomic
bomb, waiting for it to go off.

1164
01:22:29,503 --> 01:22:33,733
Me too. I mean, there's no
simple solution to this.

1165
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:38,005
Don't worry. You guys worry
entirely too much about me.

1166
01:22:38,012 --> 01:22:41,707
We're not worried about you.
We're worried about Johnny.

1167
01:22:41,715 --> 01:22:45,251
You don't understand the psychological
impact of what you're doing here.

1168
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:48,378
You're hurting yourself.
You're hurting our friendship.

1169
01:22:48,389 --> 01:22:51,856
I am not responsible for Johnny.
I'm through with that.

1170
01:22:51,859 --> 01:22:55,258
I'm changing.
I have the right, don't I?

1171
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:58,058
People are changing all the time.

1172
01:22:58,065 --> 01:23:01,225
I have to think about my future.

1173
01:23:01,235 --> 01:23:03,394
What's it to you?

1174
01:23:03,404 --> 01:23:06,837
This is going to pull us all down.

1175
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,932
It's gonna shake up
our group of friends.

1176
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:13,012
It's gonna destroy our
friendship, Lisa.

1177
01:23:14,014 --> 01:23:16,674
I don't think Mark
really loves you.

1178
01:23:17,751 --> 01:23:20,115
I don't wanna talk about it!

1179
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,120
Lisa, you're gonna have to face it.

1180
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:25,521
I, for one, am gonna have a hard
time forgiving you if you don't.

1181
01:23:27,027 --> 01:23:30,460
Hey, everybody! Let's go
inside and eat some cake!

1182
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:33,533
That's a good idea.!

1183
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:38,902
I don't understand you, Lisa.

1184
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:43,977
- Mmm!
- Mm-hmm.

1185
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:46,477
- Mmm!
- Mm-hmm.

1186
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,482
- Lisa looks hot tonight.
- What do you mean, "hot"?

1187
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:53,576
- Sorry about what happened.
- That's all right, darling.

1188
01:23:53,587 --> 01:23:55,587
I'll-I'll help.

1189
01:23:55,589 --> 01:23:57,589
Whose baby is it? Is it mine?

1190
01:23:57,591 --> 01:23:59,386
No, of course not.

1191
01:23:59,393 --> 01:24:02,826
- How can you be sure?
- Just stop asking me stupid questions.

1192
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,455
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Just shut up!

1193
01:24:05,466 --> 01:24:07,932
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

1194
01:24:07,935 --> 01:24:11,266
- You really don't know, do you?
- Maybe I know more than you think I do, Mark.

1195
01:24:11,271 --> 01:24:13,669
- Shit! All right?
- What do you want from me?

1196
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,674
Huh?

1197
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:19,577
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

1198
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,807
All right. All right!

1199
01:24:21,815 --> 01:24:23,576
Okay, folks everything is fine.

1200
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:26,016
The fight is over. I'm sorry, Mark.

1201
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:29,923
Yeah. Me too.

1202
01:24:31,558 --> 01:24:34,957
Lisa, can-Can you
clean up here, please?

1203
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:11,897
What are you doing?

1204
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:14,160
None of your business.

1205
01:25:14,168 --> 01:25:17,726
- You're my future wife.
What are you doing, Lisa?
- Leave her alone, man.

1206
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:20,573
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Since when do you give me orders?

1207
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:23,973
Since Lisa changed
her mind about you.

1208
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:26,978
Wake up, man!
What planet are you on?

1209
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:29,014
I think you should leave right now.

1210
01:25:29,016 --> 01:25:32,745
Don't spoil it. We
were just having fun.

1211
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:35,253
Don't worry about it, man.

1212
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:38,085
Don't touch me,
motherfucker. Get out.

1213
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:42,662
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Leave my girl alone!

1214
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,855
You two are acting like children.

1215
01:25:47,367 --> 01:25:49,526
- Son of a bitch.
- You're gonna ruin the party.

1216
01:25:49,536 --> 01:25:51,904
If you'd keep your girl satisfied,
she wouldn't come to me.

1217
01:25:51,905 --> 01:25:54,701
Get out of my house. I'll kill you!

1218
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:56,901
I'll break every bone in your body!

1219
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:59,774
- Stop it!
- I'll kill you, you bastard!

1220
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:02,747
- You couldn't kill me if you tried.!
- You betrayed me!

1221
01:26:02,749 --> 01:26:05,716
You're not good. You're just a chicken.
Cheep-cheep-cheep.!

1222
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:10,652
- Johnny, chill out! It's over!
- Shut up!

1223
01:26:10,657 --> 01:26:12,782
- Cool it! It's over!
- Shut up!

1224
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:17,660
It's not over.! Everybody betrayed me.!
I'm fed up with this world.!

1225
01:26:34,014 --> 01:26:36,014
I cleaned up the kitchen,
sweetheart...

1226
01:26:36,016 --> 01:26:38,744
so you don't have
to worry about that.

1227
01:26:40,854 --> 01:26:42,888
He still won't come
out of the bathroom.

1228
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:44,890
Sweetheart, he's upset.

1229
01:26:44,892 --> 01:26:47,222
Now, Johnny is a sensible man.

1230
01:26:47,227 --> 01:26:51,491
He will come out. You will discuss this.
Everything is going to be okay.

1231
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:54,658
I just think I should be
alone with him right now.

1232
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:59,102
I understand, sweetheart.
I'm going to go home now.

1233
01:26:59,106 --> 01:27:01,936
- Bye-bye. You call me if you need me.
- I will.

1234
01:27:01,942 --> 01:27:04,203
- Thanks, Mom.
- Mm-hmm!

1235
01:27:22,663 --> 01:27:26,460
You can come out now, Johnny.
She's gone.

1236
01:27:26,466 --> 01:27:29,160
In a few minutes, bitch.

1237
01:27:29,169 --> 01:27:31,931
Who are you calling a bitch?

1238
01:27:31,939 --> 01:27:34,599
You and your stupid mother.

1239
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,720
- Hello?
- Hi, Mark.

1240
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:51,723
I need to talk to you.

1241
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:55,192
- What's going on?
- Don't worry about Johnny.

1242
01:27:55,195 --> 01:27:57,889
He's just being a big baby.

1243
01:27:57,898 --> 01:28:00,558
You know, I love you very much.

1244
01:28:07,007 --> 01:28:09,337
I love you.

1245
01:28:09,343 --> 01:28:11,673
Why don't you ditch this creep?

1246
01:28:11,678 --> 01:28:13,678
I don't like him anymore.

1247
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,248
I know. He's not worth it.

1248
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:19,250
Why don't I come up there
and be with you?

1249
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,752
Sure, baby. Come on up.

1250
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:24,221
I want your body.

1251
01:28:24,224 --> 01:28:26,224
You got it.

1252
01:28:26,226 --> 01:28:28,817
- I'm on my way. Bye.
- Bye.

1253
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:35,925
Who were you talking to?

1254
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:39,199
- Nobody.
- We'll see about that.

1255
01:29:01,028 --> 01:29:03,460
We'll see about that.

1256
01:29:08,001 --> 01:29:10,092
Hello?

1257
01:29:10,103 --> 01:29:12,763
Hi, Mark. I need to talk to you.

1258
01:29:12,773 --> 01:29:15,637
What's going on?

1259
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:19,041
Don't worry about Johnny.
He's just being a big baby.

1260
01:29:19,046 --> 01:29:22,809
You know, I love you very much.

1261
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:27,285
You're the sparkle of my life.
I can't live without you. I love you.

1262
01:29:27,287 --> 01:29:31,483
You little tramp.
How could you do this to me?

1263
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:35,425
I gave you
seven years of my life...

1264
01:29:35,429 --> 01:29:37,463
and you betray me.

1265
01:29:37,464 --> 01:29:41,091
- We'll see what else we have on this tape.
- No! Stop.

1266
01:29:41,101 --> 01:29:45,331
You little prick.
I put up with you for seven years.

1267
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:48,999
You think you're an angel.
You're just like everybody.

1268
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:53,136
I treat you like a princess,
and you stab me in the back.

1269
01:29:53,146 --> 01:29:57,182
I love you, and I did anything for you
to just please you.

1270
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:59,184
And now you betray me!

1271
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:01,777
How could you love him?

1272
01:30:01,788 --> 01:30:04,789
Why don't you just
ditch this creep?

1273
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,291
I don't like him anymore.

1274
01:30:07,294 --> 01:30:09,589
I know. He's not worth it.

1275
01:30:09,596 --> 01:30:12,665
Why don't I come up there
and be with you?

1276
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:14,666
Sure, baby. Come on up.

1277
01:30:14,668 --> 01:30:16,963
I want your body.

1278
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:19,038
You got it.

1279
01:30:24,077 --> 01:30:28,307
Everybody betrayed me.
I don't have a friend in the world.

1280
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:32,716
I'm leaving you, Johnny.

1281
01:30:47,868 --> 01:30:51,369
Get out. Get out!
Get out of my life!

1282
01:31:07,888 --> 01:31:11,082
Why, Lisa? Why? Why?

1283
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:32,737
You bitch!

1284
01:31:42,322 --> 01:31:45,949
You bitch! You bitch!

1285
01:31:49,262 --> 01:31:52,820
Screw the whole world!
I don't need them!

1286
01:32:47,988 --> 01:32:50,181
You little tramp.

1287
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:58,097
I put up with you-

1288
01:33:11,011 --> 01:33:15,377
Why? Why is this
happening to me? Why?

1289
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:17,450
It's over.

1290
01:33:20,587 --> 01:33:23,212
God, forgive me.

1291
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:24,688
Everything'll be all right.

1292
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,219
Good night, Johnny.

1293
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:47,973
Wake up, Johnny! Come on!

1294
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:55,211
Is he dead?

1295
01:33:56,389 --> 01:33:59,515
My God. Mark, is he dead?

1296
01:34:08,968 --> 01:34:11,468
Yes, he's dead.

1297
01:34:11,471 --> 01:34:13,630
Yes, he's dead!

1298
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:17,232
Oh, my God!

1299
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,528
Oh, my God.

1300
01:34:42,035 --> 01:34:45,263
I've lost him, but I still
have you. Right?

1301
01:34:45,271 --> 01:34:47,339
Right?

1302
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,569
You don't have me.

1303
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:54,069
You'll never have me.

1304
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:57,545
You killed him.

1305
01:34:57,550 --> 01:35:00,141
Mark, we're free to be together.

1306
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:02,653
I love you.

1307
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:04,450
I love you.

1308
01:35:04,457 --> 01:35:06,457
You tramp.

1309
01:35:06,459 --> 01:35:09,585
You killed him. You're the
cause of all of this.

1310
01:35:09,596 --> 01:35:12,221
I don't love you.

1311
01:35:15,235 --> 01:35:17,860
Get out of my life, you bitch!

1312
01:35:18,905 --> 01:35:21,235
- What's happening?
- Don't look, Denny.

1313
01:35:21,241 --> 01:35:23,832
Johnny's dead!

1314
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:26,935
Wake up, Johnny! Please!
Please! It's not right!

1315
01:35:26,946 --> 01:35:30,607
It's not right.

1316
01:35:30,617 --> 01:35:33,413
Denny, he's in a better place.

1317
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,613
Leave us!

1318
01:35:35,622 --> 01:35:37,690
Both of you leave.

1319
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:42,818
As far as I'm concerned, you can
drop off the earth. That's a promise.

1320
01:35:42,829 --> 01:35:45,489
Just leave! Both of you!

1321
01:35:45,498 --> 01:35:49,830
Leave him, all right?
Let him be with him!

1322
01:35:49,836 --> 01:35:53,565
Why, Johnny?

1323
01:35:53,573 --> 01:35:57,131
Why? Johnny, why?

1324
01:35:57,143 --> 01:35:59,370
Why?

1325
01:36:38,284 --> 01:36:40,477
- What's happened?
- Is everything okay?

1326
01:36:40,487 --> 01:36:42,612
I heard a shot.

1327
01:36:42,622 --> 01:36:45,282
- Someone fired a gun. I smell smoke.
- What's going on?

1328
01:36:47,794 --> 01:36:50,294
Call 911.

1329
01:36:50,296 --> 01:36:52,921
Is everyone okay?

1330
01:37:33,273 --> 01:37:35,773
Your touch

1331
01:37:35,775 --> 01:37:39,504
Pulling fire out of me

1332
01:37:39,512 --> 01:37:41,341
Your touch

1333
01:37:41,347 --> 01:37:45,543
Like a wave crashing on the sea

1334
01:37:45,552 --> 01:37:47,620
Your kiss

1335
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:51,713
As gentle as a summer breeze

1336
01:37:51,724 --> 01:37:53,849
Your love

1337
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:59,364
Is what I need to set me free

1338
01:37:59,365 --> 01:38:02,434
A rose

1339
01:38:02,435 --> 01:38:05,527
Is what

1340
01:38:05,538 --> 01:38:08,436
You are

1341
01:38:08,441 --> 01:38:11,510
To me

1342
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:14,603
The smell

1343
01:38:14,614 --> 01:38:18,047
Of wonders

1344
01:38:18,051 --> 01:38:23,817
Oh, so sweet

1345
01:38:23,823 --> 01:38:26,858

- Baby

1352
01:38:45,645 --> 01:38:48,111
Yeah, baby

1353
01:38:48,114 --> 01:38:51,342
- You are

01:38:51,351 --> 01:38:54,420
