00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,128
- Why'd you agree to come in then ?
- Hey, I'm only here until 12:00.

160
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,431
After that, I'm gone.
The boss comes in.

161
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,435
- Why don't you open the shutters?
Get some sunlight in here.
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

162
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,538
- You're kidding.
- Bunch of savages in this town.

163
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,447
- Thanks.
- How much money did you leave up there?

164
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:56,517
Like, three dollars in mixed change
and a couple of singles.

165
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:59,486
This time in the morning,
people just get a paper or coffee.

166
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,122
- You're trusting.
- Why do you say that ?

167
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,193
How do you know they're taking
the right amount of change
or even paying for what they take ?

168
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,962
Theoretically, people see money
on the counter, no one around,

169
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,998
they think they're being watched.

170
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,166
Honesty through paranoia.

171
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,335
Why do you smell like shoe polish ?

172
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,838
I needed shoe polish
to make that sign out there.

173
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:21,008
- Smell won't come off.

174
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,477
You think anybody
can see us down here ?

175
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,546
Why, you wanna have sex or something ?

176
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,681
- Can we ?
- Really ?

177
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,851
- l was kidding.
- Like you can't get enough of me.

178
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,288
- Typically male point of view.
- How do you figure ?

179
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:37,624
Show some bedroom proficiency,
you think you're gods.

180
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,960
What about what we do for you ?

181
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:44,131
Women as lovers are basically the same;
they just have to be there.

182
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,134
- Be there ?
- Making a male climax
isn't at all challenging.

183
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:51,138
Insert somewhere close,
preferably moist, thrust, repeat.

184
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,140
How flattering.

185
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:56,143
Now, making a woman come,
therein lies a challenge.

186
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,778
You think so ?

187
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,914
A woman makes a guy come,
it's standard.

188
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,550
A guy makes a woman come,
it's talent.

189
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,353
- And l actually date you ?
- Something wrong ?

190
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:10,824
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it
takes more than that to get a guy off.

191
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,660
Just being there, as you put it,
is not enough.

192
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,662
Hmm, I've touched a nerve.

193
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,198
I'm astonished to hear you
you trivialize my role in our sex life.

194
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,834
It wasn't directed at you.
I was making a broad generalization.

195
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,337
You're making a generalization
about broads.

196
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:25,873
Those are my opinions
based on the few women...

How many different girls

this discussion once before ?
- We might have.

- l don't remember. How many ?
- including you ?

202
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,455
It better be up to and including me.

203
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:45,025
- Twelve.
- You slept with 12 different girls ?

204
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,294
Including you ? Yes.

205
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,296
- Ow ! What'd you do that for ?
- You're a pig !

206
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:52,299
- Why'd you hit me ?
- Do you know how many different men
I've had sex with ?

207
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,301
Do l get to hit you after you tell me ?

208
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,003
- Three.
- Three ?

209
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,006
- Three, including you.
- You only slept
with three different people ?

210
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,008
- I'm not the pig you are.
- Who ?

211
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,911
- You !
- No, who are the three, besides me.

212

- John Francin and Rob Stanslik.
- Wow.

213
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:10,517
That's why you should feel like a pig.
You men make me feel sick.

214
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:13,987
- You'll sleep with anything
that says yes.
- Animal, mineral or vegetable.

215
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,522
Vegetable, meaning paraplegic.

216
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,824
They put up
the least amount of struggle.

217
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,527
After dropping a bombshell like that,
you owe me big.

218
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,029
Name it.

219
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,031
I want you to come with me on Monday.

220
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,033
- Where ?
- To school.

221
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,802
There's a seminar about getting
back into a scholastic program...

222
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,804
after a lapse in enrollment.

223
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,439
Can't we ever have a discussion
without that coming up ?

224
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,474
It's important to me, Dante.

225
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:37,644
You have so much potential
that's going to waste in this pit.

226
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,948
- l wish you'd go back to school.
- Stop. You're making my head hurt.

227
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,984
-Shit ! Why're you getting up ?
-Unlike you, l have class in 45 minutes.

What, do you work here now ?

231
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:56,997
No, l was visiting my man.

Dante, this is Willam Black.
This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

- No, and a pack of cigarettes.

234

So where you been, man ?
Still going to Seton Hall ?

235
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,714
No, l transferred into Monmouth
this year. l was tired of missing him.

236
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,017
That's beautiful, man.

237
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,319
So, you still talk to Silvan ?

238
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,523
I just talked to her on Monday.
We still hang out on weekends.

239
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,525
Oh, that's great.

240
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:28,395
Well, you two lovebirds
take it easy, okay ?

241
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,465
Bye. Take it easy.

242
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:35,202
- [ Ronni ] That was Snowball.
- Why do you call him that ?

243
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:39,006
Silvan made it up.
It's a blow job thing.

244
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,008
What do you mean ?

245
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,645
After the blow job, he likes to have it
spit back into his mouth while kissing.

246
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,647
It's called snowballing.

247
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:49,483
- He requests this ?
- He gets off on it.

248
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,819
- Silvan can be talked into anything.
- Why do you say that ?

249
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:55,322
Like you said, she snowballed him.

250
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:59,493
- Silvan ? No, l snowballed him.
- Yeah, right.

251
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,662
I'm serious.

252
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:05,332
- You sucked that guy's dick ?
- Yeah. How do you think l knew--

253
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:09,169
You said you only had sex
with three different guys !
You never mentioned him !

254
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,005
- Because l never had sex with him.
- You sucked his dick !

255
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,008
We went out a few times.
We never had sex, but we fooled around.

256
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,178
Oh, my God. Why did you tell me
you only had sex with three guys ?

257
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,714
Because l did
only have sex with three guys.

258
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:24,184
- it doesn't mean
I didn't just go with people.
- Oh, my God, l feel so nauseous !

259
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,220
I'm sorry, Dante.
I thought you understood.

260
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,788
I did understand !

261
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:30,824
I understood that you had sex with
three guys and that's all you said !

262
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:32,826
- Please calm down.
- How many ?

263
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,128
- Dante, let it go !
- How many dicks have you sucked ?

264
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,831
Shut up a second and I'll tell you.
Jesus !

265
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:40,634
I didn't freak out like this when
you told me how many girls you fucked !

266
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:43,337
This is different. This is important.
How many ?

267
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,516
Well ?

268
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,655
- Something like 36.
- What ? Something like 36 ?

269
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,525
- Lower your voice.
- What is that-- ""Something like 36"" ?

270
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,493
Does that include me ?

271
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,364
- Uh... 37.
- I'm 37 ?

272
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,667
- I'm going to class.
- Oh, my God.

273
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:17,938
- 37 ! My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks!
- in a row ?

274
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,341
- Where you going ?
- Hey, listen, jerk.
Until today, you never even knew...

how many guys l slept with
because you never even bothered to ask.

276
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:28,048
Then you act all nonchalant
about fucking 12 girls.
I never had sex with 12 guys !

277
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:31,018
- No, but you sucked enough dick !
- Yeah, l went down on a few guys.

278
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,620
- A few ?
- One of those guys was you.
The last one, l might add.

279
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,791
Which, if you're too stupid
to comprehend, means that
I've been faithful to you since we met.

280
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,628
All the other guys
I went with before l met you.
If you want to have a complex, go ahead.

281
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:45,165
But don't look at me like
I'm the town whore, because you
were plenty busy before you met me.

282
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:49,002
Why did you suck their dick ?
Why couldn't you sleep with them
Like any other decent person ?

283
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,004
Because going down isn't a big deal.

284

and sooner or later I'd go down on him.

with the guys l loved.
- l feel sick.

you'll be a bit more rational.
- I'm 37 ! l just can't--

Good-bye, Dante !

Hey, try not to suck any dick

Hey ! Hey, you !

it's a demanding job over there.

to sit on my ass and watch TV.

- I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
- Are you calling me a liar ?

298
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:45,459
- Are you calling me a liar ?
- No ! He was probably
just resting his eyes.

299
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,861
What the hell is that,
""resting his eyes"" ?

300
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:51,765
- Like he's some air traffic controller?
- Actually, that's his night job.

Wise ass too, huh ?
Go ahead. Keep cracking wise.

She cheated on you how many times ?

- Eight and a half ?

351
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:17,171
Party at John Kay's, senior year;
I get blitzed, pass out in his bedroom.

-Caitlin comes in and jumps all over me.
-So that's cheating ?

353

- No.
In the middle of it she called me Brad.
- She called you Brad ?

354
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,446
That's not cheating.
People say crazy shit during sex.

355

- One time, l called this girl ""mom.""
- l hit the light, she freaks.

- She thought l was Brad Michelson.
- What do you mean ?

357
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:35,255
She was supposed to meet Brad in a
dark bedroom. She picked the wrong one.

358
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,424
- She didn't even know
I was at the party.
- Oh, my God.

- That girl was vile to you.

Interesting postscript to that story.
Do you know who wound up
in that bedroom with Brad ?

361

- Your mother ?
- Alan Harris.

362

- Chess team Alan Harris ?
- The two moved to Idaho together.

drove men to deviant lifestyles.

There was a lot of good
in our relationship.

Aside from the cheating,
we were a great couple.

- They are.

she's a different person.
She's frightened, vulnerable.

and about to enter the real world.

- And she's looking for support.

- l think this is leading
our relationship to a new level.
- What about Veronica ?

377
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:29,309
I think the arguments Veronica and l are
having are some kind of manifestation...

378
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,478
of a subconscious desire
to break up with her,

379
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,981
so l can pursue a more meaningful
relationship with Caitlin.

380
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,750

- it's safe to say yes.

00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:09,650
I mean, Luke gets his hand cut off,
finds out Vader's his father.

468
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,187
Han gets frozen, taken away by
Boba Fett. it ends on such a down note.

469
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,657
I mean, that's what life is:
a series of down endings.

470
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:19,326
All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.

471
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,663
There was something else
going on in Jedi.
I never noticed it 'til today.

472
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:25,032
- They build another Death Star, right ?
- Yeah.

473
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:28,168
The first one
was completed and fully operational
before the rebels destroyed it.

474
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,671
Luke blew it up.
Give credit where credit's due.

475
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:34,274
- The second one was still
being built when they blew it up.
- Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

476
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:37,110
Something just never sat right with me
that second time around.

477
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:39,947
I could never put my finger on it,
but something just wasn't right.

478
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:43,884
- And you figured it out.
- The first Death Star
was manned by the lmperial Army.

479
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,487
The only people on board were Storm
Troopers, dignitaries, lmperialists.

480
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:51,391
- Basically.
- So when they blew it up, no problem.
Evil's punished.

481
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:55,128
- And the second time around ?
- it wasn't even done being built yet.

482
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:57,464
- it was still under construction.
- So ?

483
00:29:57,531 --> 00:29:59,900
A construction job
of that magnitude would require...

484
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,036
a lot more manpower
than the lmperial Army had to offer.

485
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,839
I'll bet they brought independent
contractors in on that thing.

486
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:08,675
- Plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers--
- Not just lmperialists.

487
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:11,144
- Is that what you're getting at ?
- Exactly.

488
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:13,981
To get it built quickly and quietly,
they'd hire anybody
that could do the job.

489
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,683
You think the average Storm Trooper
knows how to install a toilet main ?

490
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,355
- All they know is killing.
- So they bring in
independent contractors.

491
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:26,360
- Why are you so upset ?
- Those innocent contractors
brought in are killed,

492
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:29,196
casualties of a war
they had nothing to do with.

493
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:33,433
Look, you're a roofer. Some juicy
government contract comes your way.

494
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,336
You got a wife and kids,
the two-story in suburbia.

495
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:39,506
This is a government contract
which means all sorts of benefits.

496
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:41,708
Along come these left-wing militants
who blast everything...

497
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:43,777
within a three-mile radius
with their lasers.

498
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:46,446
You didn't ask for that;
you had no personal politics.

499
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:49,516
- You're just trying
to scrape out a living.
- l don't mean to interrupt,

500
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,553
- but what are you talking about ?
- The ending of Return Of The Jedi.

501
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:57,324
My friend is trying to convince me
that independent contractors
working on the Death Star...

502
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:59,960
were innocent victims
when it was destroyed by the rebels.

503
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:02,729
I'm a contractor myself.
I'm a roofer.

504
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:04,731
""Done And Ready Home improvements.""

505
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,035
Speaking as a roofer, l can tell you
a roofer's personal politics...

506
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:11,238
- comes into play heavily
when choosing jobs.
- Like when ?

507
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:14,708
Three weeks ago, l was offered a job
up in the hills. Beautiful house.

508
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:17,711
Tons of property.
A simple re-shingling job.

509
00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:21,515
They told me if l could finish it
in one day, l would double my price.

510
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,184
- Then l realized whose house it was.
- [ Dante ] Whose house was it ?

511
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:28,255
- Dominic Bambino's.
- Baby Face Bambino ? The gangster ?

512
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:32,226
The same ! The money was right,
but the risk was too high.

513
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:36,363
I knew who he was, and based on that,
I turned the job over to a friend.

514
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,999
- Based on personal politics.
- Right !

515
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:43,370
The next week, the Foresie family
put a hit on Baby Face's house.

516
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:48,075
- My friend was shot and killed.
Didn't even finish re-shingling.
- No way.

517
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:52,112
I'm alive because l knew the risk
involved in that particular client.

518
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:54,181
My friend wasn't so lucky.

519
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:58,285
Any contractor working on that
Death Star knew the risk involved.

520
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:00,954
If they got killed,
it's their own fault.

521
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:04,057
A roofer listens to this,
not his wallet.

522
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:18,572
They say so much, but they never
tell you if it's any good.

523
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:24,945
Are either one of these any good ?

524
00:32:24,978 --> 00:32:26,947
- Sir ?
- What ?

525
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,784
- Are either one of these any good ?
- l don't watch movies.

526
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:34,188
[ Sighs ] Well, have you heard anything
about either one of them ?

527
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:37,524
I find it's best to stay out
of other people's affairs.

528
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:41,528
You mean you haven't heard anybody
say anything about either one of these ?

529
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,530
Nope.

530
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,532
[ Sighs ]

531
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:51,071
- Well, what about these two ?
- They suck.

532
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:54,541
[ Sighs ]
These are the same two movies.

533
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:58,145
- You weren't paying any attention.
- No, l wasn't.

534
00:32:58,212 --> 00:33:00,714
I don't think your manager
would appreciate it--

535
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:03,750
- l don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
- l beg your pardon ?

536
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:07,387
Your ruse.
Your cunning attempt to trick me.

537
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:11,758
I was only pointing out that
you weren't paying any attention
to what l was saying.

538
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,727
And l hope it feels good.

539
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:17,264
- You hope what feels good ?
- l hope it feels so good to be right.

540
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:19,266
There's nothing more exhilarating...

541
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,435
than pointing out
the shortcomings of others, is there ?

542
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,738
[ Heavy Sigh ] Well, this is
the last time l rent here !

543
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:28,108
- You will be missed.
- Screw you !

544
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:34,715
- Hey, you're not allowed
to rent here anymore !
- [ Jay ] Yeah !

545
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:36,717
Screw me ?

546
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,566
- You'll never believe
what this unruly customer just said.
- Wait.

547
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:56,003
- She in here ?
- This guy's going through all the eggs.

548
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:58,639
This has been going on
for 20 minutes now.

549
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:01,308
- What's he looking for ?
- Said he has to find the perfect dozen.

550
00:34:01,408 --> 00:34:04,244
- Perfect dozen ?
- Each egg has to be perfect.

551
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:06,547
- The quest isn't going well ?
- Obviously not.

552
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:09,983
- Look at all the cartons
that didn't make the grade.
- Why doesn't he mix and match ?

553
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,553
- l told him that, and he yelled at me.
- What'd he say ?

554
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,923
He said
it was important to have standards.
He says no one has any pride anymore.

555
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,225
It's not like
you laid the eggs yourself.

556
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:21,261
I give him five more minutes.
After that, I'm calling the cops.

557
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:24,331
I don't need this.
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

558
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,601
Two packs of cigarettes.

559
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:33,874
- I'm as puzzled as you.
- I've actually seen it before.

560
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:37,044
- You know him ?
- No, but l know the behavior.

561
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,214
- Let me guess. He's looking
for the perfect carton of eggs ?
- [ Randal ] How'd you know ?

562
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,051
- I'll bet you a million dollars
he's a guidance counselor.
- [ Dante ] Why do you say that ?

563
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:48,155
I saw it happen in Food City,
Like, last year. Different guy, though.

564
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,191
Stock boy said he'd been looking through
cartons of eggs for half an hour,

565
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,794
doing all sorts
of endurance tests and stuff.

566
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:56,230
I asked him why nobody ever called
the manager, and he said it happens...

567
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:58,599
two, three times a week, sometimes more.

568
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,868
- Get out of here.
- No, l kid you not.

569
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:04,371
They call it shell shock. Seems to
only happen with guidance counselors.

570
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:07,174
They used to make a big deal of it,
but they just let it go now...

571
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:10,410
because they always pay
for whatever they break,
and they never bother anybody.

572
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:12,412
Why guidance counselors ?

573
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:15,415
If your job was as meaningless
as theirs, wouldn't you go crazy too ?

574
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:18,952
- Come to think of it, my guidance
counselor was kinda worthless.
- See ?

575
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:21,488
It's important to have a job
that makes a difference, boys.

576
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:26,760
That's why l manually masturbate caged
animals for artificial insemination.

577
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:32,299
<MUSIC> Go your own way <MUSIC>

578
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:37,538
<MUSIC> You can call it
another lonely day <MUSIC><MUSIC>

579
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:05,098
Did you ever notice
that all the prices end in ""9"" ?

580
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:07,100
Damn, that's eerie.

581
00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:11,104
- Do you know how much the average
jiz-mopper makes per hour ?
- What's a jiz-mopper ?

582
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:14,408
The guy that cleans up the nudie booths
after each guy jerks off.

583
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:16,577
- ""Nudie booth"" ?
- Yeah, nudie booth.

584
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:19,246
- You ever been in a nudie booth ?
- Guess not.

585
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:21,248
Oh, man, it's great.

586
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,784
You go into this booth, and there's
this glass between you and these chicks.

587
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:27,087
- And they put on a show for you
for, like, ten bucks.
- What kind of a show ?

588
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:30,257
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit
you'd like to see chicks do.

589
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:34,061
These chicks do it all. They insert
things into any opening on their body.

590
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:36,530
- Any opening.
- Can we not talk about this now ?

591
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,700
The jiz-mopper's job is to clean it up
after each guy shoots a load.

592
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,069
Practically everybody
does it right on the window.

593
00:36:42,135 --> 00:36:45,138
I don't know if you know this,
but cum leaves streaks
if you don't clean it right away.

594
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:48,275
- l will never come to this place again.
- Excuse me ?

595
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:52,179
Using filthy language in front of
the customers. You both should be fired.

596
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:55,782
Oh, l-I'm sorry.
I guess we kinda got carried away.

597
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:58,919
I don't know
if sorry can make up for it.

598
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:01,788
You've highly offended me.

599
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:04,925
Well, if you think that's offensive,
check this out.

600
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:06,860
Oh !
[ Screaming ]

601
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,663
- l think you can see her kidneys.
- Why do you do things like that ?

602
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:12,599
- You know he's only going
to come back and tell the boss.
- Who cares ?

603
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,602
That guy's an asshole. Everybody
that comes in here is way too uptight.

604
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:18,605
This job would be great
if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

605
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:21,942
- Jesus ! I'm gonna hear
from the boss tomorrow.
- Would you loosen up ?

606
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:25,112
You'd feel a lot better if you'd just
rip into the occasional customer.

607
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:28,115
Why ? l-l don't bother them
and they don't bother me.

608
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:32,886
Liar ! Tell me there aren't
customers that annoy the piss
out of you on a daily basis.

609
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:35,556
- There aren't !
- How can you lie like that ?

610
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:41,228
Why don't you vent ? Vent your
frustrations. Who pisses you off ?

611
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:44,731
Well, l guess it isn't
customers in particular.

612
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:47,568
Maybe just a group of customers.

613
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:51,972
- Well, let's hear it.
- Well, the Milk Maids.

614
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:53,974
The Milk Maids ?

615
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:58,078
The women that go through every gallon
of milk, looking for that later date,

616
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:01,081
as if somewhere beyond all the other
gallons is a container of milk...

617
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:03,851
that won't go bad for like a decade.

618
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:08,088
You know who l can do without ?

00:56:55,883 --> 00:56:58,819
I wouldn't be allowed to spit water
at that guy, but l did.

926
00:56:58,852 --> 00:57:01,455
My point is that
people dictate their own behavior.

927
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:04,992
Even though l work in a video store,
I choose to rent movies at Big Choice.

928
00:57:05,058 --> 00:57:08,395
- Agreed ?
- You are a danger
to both the dead and the living.

929
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:10,898
I like to think
I'm a master of my own destiny.

930
00:57:10,964 --> 00:57:14,001
- Please get the hell outta here.
- You know I'm your hero.

931
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,342
Sounds to me like somebody
needs to hit the gym.

932
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:25,279
- Excuse me ?
- l heard you strain
when you picked up that milk.

933
00:57:25,345 --> 00:57:28,348
- it only weighs seven pounds.
- l didn't strain. l sighed.

934
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:30,717
I don't think so.
That was a grunt.

935
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:34,288
A deep inhalation of oxygen
to aid in the stretching of muscles.

936
00:57:34,354 --> 00:57:38,525
I'm a trainer. l know what that
sound signifies. You're out of shape.

937
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:41,828
- What ? There's no fat on my body.
- No fat !

938
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:44,331
No tone either.
You don't get enough exercise.

939
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:46,400
- You open ?
- Yes.

940
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:49,169
- Just the paper.
- Thirty-five.

941
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:52,906
Hey, uh, let me ask you a question.
Think this guy's out of shape ?

942
00:57:53,006 --> 00:57:54,908
I don't know.
Can't really tell from here.

943
00:57:55,008 --> 00:57:57,845
- l am-- l am not !
- He is.

944
00:57:57,878 --> 00:57:59,847
How much can you bench ?

945
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,883
- l don't know.
- I'd say about 60, 70, tops.

946
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:04,885
I know l can bench more than that.

947
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:07,688
- Three-fifty, four.
- No way !

948
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:09,723
Feel that.

949
00:58:09,756 --> 00:58:12,626
Hey, that's tight.
Solid.

950
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,928
Yeah. Now feel this.
Roll up your sleeve, chief.

951
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:17,497
- Oh, for God's sakes !
- See, you're ashamed.

952
00:58:17,564 --> 00:58:19,566
You know you're out of shape.

953
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,568
Here.
Take my card.

954
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:23,604
I can get you on
an aerobics/free weights program.

955
00:58:23,637 --> 00:58:26,607
- Are you open ?
- [ Dante ] Yes. I'm not out of shape.

956
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,642
Excuse me.
Have you been here all day ?

957
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:31,812
- Yeah, since 6:00 this morning.
- He's got those love handles.

958
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:33,847
I don't have love handles !

959
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:36,083
- Were you working here about 4:00 ?
- Yes.

960
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:39,119
- it's probably from being
around all this food every day.
- Oh, l know.

961
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:42,756
If l had to work here all day,
I'd be bloated and out of shape too.

962
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:45,559
- I'm not out of shape.
- Can l have your name, please ?

963
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:47,995
Dante Hicks. Why ?
What's this all about ?

964
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:52,199
You're Dante Hicks ? Oh, my God.
I didn't even recognize you.

965
00:58:52,299 --> 00:58:54,768
- Because he's out of shape !
- Do l know you ?

966
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:57,404
Yeah. Do you remember Alyssa Jones ?
She used to hang out--

967
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:59,306
- With Caitlin Bree !
- I'm her sister.

968
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:01,308
You're Alyssa's sister Heather ?

969
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:03,477
- Yeah.
- You, uh, say Caitlin Bree ?

970
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:05,612
- Yeah.
- Pretty girl ?

971
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:08,215
A little taller than her ?
Gorgeous body ?

972
00:59:08,282 --> 00:59:10,284
- Yeah.
- And you're Dante Hicks.

973
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:12,419
You went to the same school.
You played hockey.

974
00:59:12,486 --> 00:59:15,122
- Yeah. How did you know that ?
- You still goin' out with her ?

975
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:17,391
- No, she's getting married.
- To you ?

976
00:59:17,457 --> 00:59:19,426
No. To an Asian design major.

977
00:59:19,493 --> 00:59:21,428
Aw, shit !

978
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:24,765
Don't take this the wrong way,
but, uh, l used to fuck her.

979
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:27,334
- What ?
- Yeah, about two, three years ago.

980
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:30,170
While you two were dating.
I drove a black Trans Am.

981
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,306
- You're Rick Daress ?
- Yeah.

982
00:59:32,372 --> 00:59:34,308
- You know him ?
- Yeah.

983
00:59:34,374 --> 00:59:36,910
- Caitlin used to
talk about him all the time.
- Really ?

984
00:59:36,977 --> 00:59:41,048
Wait a second. You used to fuck
Caitlin Bree while l was dating her ?

985
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:43,917
Nah, man, don't let it bother you.
That was a long time ago.

986
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:46,286
I'm surprised you didn't
know about it, Dante.

987
00:59:46,353 --> 00:59:48,989
Everybody in school knew about it.
Even in my class.

988
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:51,024
Jesus Christ ! What next ?

989
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:53,026
- Here you go.
- What's this ?

990
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:54,862
- A fine for $500.
- What ?

991
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,897
Five hundred bucks ?
For what ?

992
00:59:56,997 --> 01:00:01,535
For violation of New Jersey Statute,
Section 2A, Number 170/51.

993
01:00:01,635 --> 01:00:04,238
Any person who sells
or makes available tobacco,

994
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:07,241
or tobacco-related products,
to persons under the age of 18,

995
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:09,276
is regarded as disorderly.

996
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:13,680
- What are you talkin' about ?
- An angry mother called
the state division of taxation...

997
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:15,716
and claimed
that a Quick Stop employee...

998
01:00:15,749 --> 01:00:18,852
sold her four-year-old daughter
a pack of cigarettes at 4:00 today.

999
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:21,788
The New Jersey Division of Taxation
called the Board of Health...

1000
01:00:21,855 --> 01:00:23,790
and sent me down to issue a fine.

1001
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:27,394
You claimed you were working here
all day. Hence, the fine is yours.

1002
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:30,063
The fine is doubled due to
the incredibly young age of the child.

1003
01:00:30,163 --> 01:00:32,065
But l didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids !

1004
01:00:32,165 --> 01:00:35,235
You sold cigarettes to a four-year-old ?
What a scumbag !

1005
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:37,404
That's sick, Dante.

1006
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:39,606
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids !
I swear !

1007
01:00:39,673 --> 01:00:44,645
The due date is on the bottom.
This summons cannot be contested
in any court of law.

1008
01:00:44,678 --> 01:00:46,747
Failure to remit before the due date...

1009
01:00:46,847 --> 01:00:48,749
will result
in a charge of criminal negligence,

1010
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:50,751
and a warrant
will be issued for your arrest.

1011
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:53,620
- Have a nice day.
- But l didn't sell
any cigarettes to any kids.

1012
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,723
Hey, wait a minute !

1013
01:00:56,790 --> 01:01:01,361
Forget it. l don't wanna deal with a guy
that sells cigarettes to four-year-olds.

1014
01:01:01,428 --> 01:01:03,764
Can l, uh, give you
a lift somewhere ?

1015
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:06,733
Sure. How 'bout the beach ?

1016
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,702
I like the way you think.

1017
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:15,509
Jesus ! What next ?

1018
01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:19,079
- [ Woman ] Dante ?
- What ? Caitlin !

- When did you get home ?
- Just now.

1021
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:46,540
I can't believe it.
I haven't seen you in so long.

1022
01:01:48,675 --> 01:01:50,777
Dante, you have a customer.

1023
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:56,683
I just saw Alyssa's
Little sister outside.

1024
01:01:56,783 --> 01:01:59,720
- She was with Rick Daress.
- Let's not talk about her.

1025
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,723
- How'd you get home ?
- Train. it took eight hours.

1026
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:04,925
- l can't believe you're here.
- Excuse me. Do you have--

1027
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:07,160
Uh, yeah. Back behind the oil.
How long you staying ?

1028
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:10,264
Until Monday.
Then l have to take the train back.

1029
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,399
Pack of cigarettes.
Hey, congratulations.

1030
01:02:12,499 --> 01:02:14,401
I saw the announcement
in today's paper.

1031
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:16,370
You know, she's marrying
an Asian design major.

1032
01:02:16,436 --> 01:02:18,405

<MUSIC><MUSIC> [ Hip-Hop ]

You're just gonna close
the store like that ?

1035
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:52,206
I wanna talk to you about something,
and l don't wanna be disturbed.

1036
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:54,308
Something l read in the tabloids.

1037
01:02:54,374 --> 01:02:56,376
- You saw it.
- Very dramatic, l thought.

1038
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:58,579
- it is not what you think.
- Oh, it's not what l think.

1039
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:01,515
What is it, worse ? You're pregnant
with the Asian design major's child ?

1040
01:03:01,582 --> 01:03:03,584
- What's goin' on here ?
- l am not pregnant.

1041
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,253
Were you gonna tell me, or were
you gonna send me an invitation ?

1042
01:03:06,353 --> 01:03:09,556
I was gonna tell you,
but we were getting along so well,
I didn't wanna mess it up.

1043
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,592
You could've broken it to me gently.

1044
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:14,595
You could've started
by telling me you had a boyfriend.
I told you l had a girlfriend.

1045
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:18,665
I know. I'm sorry,
but when we started talking,
it was like l forgot l had a boyfriend.

1046
01:03:18,732 --> 01:03:21,134
- And then he proposed last month.
- And you said yes.

1047
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:23,136
Well, kind of. Sort of.

1048
01:03:23,237 --> 01:03:26,039
Is that what they teach you in that
school of yours ? ""Kind of,"" ""sort of"" ?

1049
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:28,842
Everybody knows about this except me !
Do you know how humiliating that is ?

1050
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:31,812
I would've told you, and you would've
stopped calling me, like a baby.

1051
01:03:31,912 --> 01:03:33,881
- How do you know that ?
- Because l know you.

1052
01:03:33,914 --> 01:03:36,617
You prefer drastic measures
to rational ones.

1053
01:03:36,717 --> 01:03:38,986
- So you're really getting married ?
- No.

1054
01:03:39,052 --> 01:03:41,355
- You're not really getting married ?
- [ Scoffs ]

1055
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:45,792
The story goes like this: He proposed,
I told him l had to think about it,

1056
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:47,895
and he insisted
that l wear the ring anyway.

1057
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:50,430
Then my mother told the paper
we were engaged.

1058
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,966
- Oh, how like her.
- Then my mother called this morning...

1059
01:03:53,033 --> 01:03:55,469
to let me know that
the announcement was in the paper.

1060
01:03:55,536 --> 01:03:58,672
That's when l hopped a train
to come back here,
because l knew you'd be a wreck.

1061
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:01,408
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Was l right ?

1062
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:03,377
""Wreck"" is a harsh term.

1063
01:04:03,477 --> 01:04:05,512
""Disturbed"" is more like it.
""Mildly disturbed,"" even.

1064
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:09,116
Oh, l love a macho facade.
It is such a turn-on.

1065
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:13,153
- What smells like shoe polish ?
- So you came here to what ?
To comfort me ?

1066
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,223
The last thing l needed was for you to
think l was hiding something from you.

1067
01:04:16,323 --> 01:04:18,592
- But you were !
- No, l wasn't ! Not really.

1068
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:20,594
I told you
I'd been seeing other people.

1069
01:04:20,661 --> 01:04:23,630
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ,
you're ready to walk down the aisle.

1070
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,732
I think that constitutes something
more than just seeing somebody.

01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:28,969
- What's going on ?
- I'm giving him his ring back.

- What ?
- [ Sighs ] l don't want to marry him.

and then l want to start a career.

and then have to worry about...

when I'm gonna
fit in the other stuff.

1077
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:45,252
I have come way too far
and studied too damn hard...

1078

go to waste as a housewife.

1389
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:17,150
- Yeah, you close soon ?
- in half an hour.

1390
01:20:17,217 --> 01:20:19,152
Yeah, we get off
the same time every day.

1391
01:20:19,219 --> 01:20:21,655
- We should hang out. You get high ?
- l should start.

1392
01:20:21,755 --> 01:20:24,391
Wanna come to this party tonight ?
There's gonna be some pussy there.

1393
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:26,393
With you ? l don't think so.

1394
01:20:26,426 --> 01:20:28,762
Oh, look at you.
""l don't hang out with drug dealers.""

1395
01:20:28,795 --> 01:20:32,032
- Nothing personal.
- What happened with that old guy ?

1396
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:35,035
- He died in the bathroom.
- l heard he was jerkin' off
or something.

1397
01:20:35,102 --> 01:20:37,237
I don't know.
I wasn't watching.

1398
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:40,707
He probably saw that Caitlin chick.
I know l felt like beatin' it
when l saw her.

1399
01:20:40,807 --> 01:20:42,876
Oh, come here, bitch.
You like this ? Huh ?

1400
01:20:42,943 --> 01:20:46,246
- This what you want ?
- Knock it off. That used to be
my girlfriend, all right ?

1401
01:20:46,313 --> 01:20:48,148
Oh, you used to go out with her ?

1402
01:20:48,248 --> 01:20:50,517
Yeah, well, l thought
we might be starting again.

1403
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:54,121
- Don't you already have a girlfriend ?
- [ Dante ] Yeah, Veronica.

1404
01:20:54,154 --> 01:20:57,558
- And what, you're gonna dump her
for that Caitlin chick ?
- Maybe.

1405
01:20:57,591 --> 01:21:00,561
I don't know, dude. That Caitlin chick's
nice, but l see that Veronica girl...

1406
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:02,563
doin' shit for you all the time.

1407
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:05,566
I saw her rubbin' your back,
fuckin' comes and brings your food.

1408
01:21:05,632 --> 01:21:08,468
-Didn't l see her change your tire once?
-Hey, l jacked up the car.

1409
01:21:08,569 --> 01:21:11,038
All she did was unloosen the nuts
and put the tire on.

1410
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:14,641
- Well, l know she does a lot for you.
- She's my girlfriend.

1411
01:21:14,675 --> 01:21:19,012
I had some girlfriends too, but all
they wanted from me was weed and shit.

1412
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:21,014
Shit, my grandmother used to say,
""What's better ?

1413
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:24,051
Fuckin' a good plate
with nothin' on it ?""

1414
01:21:24,117 --> 01:21:26,587
No, wait. l fucked up. ""What's
a good plate with nothin' on it ?""

1415
01:21:26,687 --> 01:21:28,589
Meaning ?

1416
01:21:28,689 --> 01:21:32,626
I don't know. She was senile. She used
to fuckin' piss herself all the time...

1417
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:34,628
and shit herself.

1418
01:21:34,728 --> 01:21:37,831
Come on, Silent Bob. Let's get
the fuck outta this fuckin' gyp joint...

1419
01:21:37,931 --> 01:21:40,100
with this fuckin' faggot Dante.

1420
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,469
You cock smoker.

1421
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:45,572
You know, there's a million
fine-lookin' women in the world, dude,

1422
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:47,608
but they don't all bring ya
Lasagna at work.

1423
01:21:47,674 --> 01:21:49,643
Most of 'em just cheat on ya.

1424
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:52,179
[ Jay ]
Come on, limp dick !

1425
01:21:52,246 --> 01:21:54,781
[ Silent Bob ]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1426
01:21:56,183 --> 01:21:58,151
He's right.

1427
01:21:58,252 --> 01:22:00,821
I love her.

1428
01:22:00,888 --> 01:22:04,558
So that's it. He doesn't love you
anymore. He loves Caitlin.

1429
01:22:04,658 --> 01:22:06,760
And he told you all of this ?

1430
01:22:06,793 --> 01:22:11,131
Pretty much. All except
the latent homosexuality part.
That's just my theory.

1431
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:13,567
Uh-- l don't know what to say.

1432
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:17,504
Don't hold it against him. He just
never got Caitlin out of his system.

1433
01:22:17,571 --> 01:22:20,607
It's not your fault. it's Dante.

1434
01:22:20,707 --> 01:22:23,644
I-Look. l don't know
thing one about chicks.

1435
01:22:23,744 --> 01:22:26,680
So if you gotta cry or something,
I can get outta here.

1436
01:22:26,747 --> 01:22:29,149
- I'm not sad.
- You're not ?

1437
01:22:29,216 --> 01:22:31,185
Ow ! What'd you do that for ?

1438
01:22:31,218 --> 01:22:34,188
If you didn't wanna go out with me
anymore, why didn't you say so ?

1439
01:22:34,221 --> 01:22:36,690
Instead you pussyfoot around
and see that slut behind my back !

1440
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:39,693
- What are you talking about ?
- You've been talking to her
on the phone for weeks !

1441
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,229
- it was only a few times.
- Then you pull that shit this morning,

1442
01:22:42,262 --> 01:22:44,298
freaking out because
I've gone down a couple of guys.

1443
01:22:44,364 --> 01:22:47,301
- Oh, a couple ?
- I'm not the one trying
to patch things up with my ex,

1444
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:49,336
sneaking around behind your back !

1445
01:22:49,403 --> 01:22:52,372
If you think 37 dicks are a lot,
just wait and see, mister.

1446
01:22:52,472 --> 01:22:55,375
I'm going to put the hookers
in Times Square to shame
with all the guys l go down on now !

1447
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:57,377
- Will you let me explain ?
- Explain what ?

1448
01:22:57,444 --> 01:23:00,414
How you've been waiting
until the time was right, and then
you were going to dump me for her ?

1449
01:23:00,514 --> 01:23:02,583
- it isn't like that !
- Damn right it isn't like that !

1450
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:06,220
Because l won't let it be like that.
You want your slut ?
Fine, the slut is yours.

1451
01:23:06,286 --> 01:23:08,856
- l don't want Caitlin.
- You don't know what you want !

1452
01:23:08,956 --> 01:23:12,025
But I'm not going to sit here
holding your hand anymore
until you figure it out !

1453
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:14,194
I've tried with you, Dante.

1454
01:23:14,261 --> 01:23:17,264
I've encouraged you to get out of this
fucking dump and go back to school,

1455
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:19,533
to take charge of your life
and find direction.

1456
01:23:19,633 --> 01:23:21,668
I even transferred
so maybe you'd be more inclined...

1457
01:23:21,735 --> 01:23:23,770
to go back to college
if l was with you.

1458
01:23:23,871 --> 01:23:26,106
Everyone said it was a stupid move,
but l didn't care...

1459
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:28,108
because l loved you
and wanted to see you...

1460
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:30,544
pull yourself out of this senseless funk
that you've been in...

1461
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:32,546
since that whore dumped you
oh, so many years ago.

1462
01:23:32,613 --> 01:23:35,315
Now you wanna go back to her
so she can fuck you over some more !

1463
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:37,951
- l don't wanna go back--
- Of course not ! Not now !

1464
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:40,988
You're caught,
and now you're trying to snake out
of doing what you wanted to do !

1465
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,823
Well, l won't let you.

1466
01:23:42,923 --> 01:23:45,993
I want you to follow through on this
so you can find out
what a fucking idiot you are !

1467
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:48,996
And when she dumps you again--
and l promise you, she will--

1468
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:51,398
I want to laugh in your face
so you realize that...

1469
01:23:51,465 --> 01:23:53,400
that was what you gave up
our relationship for !

1470
01:23:53,467 --> 01:23:56,036
I'm just glad that Randal had the balls
to tell me since you couldn't !

1471
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:59,072
- Randal ?
- And having him tell me,
that was just the weakest move ever.

1472
01:23:59,106 --> 01:24:01,275
- You're spineless !
- Veronica, l love you !

1473
01:24:01,341 --> 01:24:03,076
Fuck you !

The swelling's not that bad,
but the F.D.S. stings.

1487
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:02,402
- How's your neck ?
- it's kinda hard to swallow.

1488
01:25:04,037 --> 01:25:06,006
You didn't have to choke me, you know.

1489
01:25:06,073 --> 01:25:09,443
Why did you tell Veronica that l was
gonna dump her to go back with Caitlin ?

1490
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:12,579
- l thought l was doing you a favor.
- Oh, Jesus.

1491
01:25:12,646 --> 01:25:14,648
You're always saying
how you can't initiate change yourself.

1492
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:16,583
I thought I'd give you a hand.

1493
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:18,752
Thanks.

1494
01:25:18,852 --> 01:25:20,821
You still didn't have to choke me.

1495
01:25:20,854 --> 01:25:23,824
Oh, please.
I'm surprised l didn't kill you.

1496
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:25,993
- Why do you say that ?
- Why do l say that ?

1497
01:25:26,093 --> 01:25:28,061
Randal-- [ Sighs ]
Forget it.

1498
01:25:28,095 --> 01:25:31,164
- No, really.
What did l do that was so wrong ?
- What don't you do ?

1499
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:34,434
Sometimes l think
the only reason you come to work
is to make my life miserable.

1500
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:36,904
- How do you figure ?
- What time did you get to work today ?

1501
01:25:36,937 --> 01:25:39,339
Like 10:00, or ten after.

1502
01:25:39,406 --> 01:25:42,509
You were over a half an hour late.
And then all you do is come in here.

1503
01:25:42,543 --> 01:25:46,346
- Yeah, to talk to you.
- Which means the video store
is ostensibly closed !

1504
01:25:46,413 --> 01:25:48,382
Oh, it's not like I'm miles away.

1505
01:25:48,415 --> 01:25:50,450
Unless you're out renting video
at other video stores.

1506
01:25:50,551 --> 01:25:54,688
- Hermaphrodites. l rented it
so we could watch it together.
- You get me slapped with a fine.

1507
01:25:54,788 --> 01:25:57,691
You argue with the customers,
and l have to patch everything up.

1508
01:25:57,791 --> 01:26:00,093
You get us thrown out of a funeral
by violating the corpse.

1509
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,031
Then to top it all off,
you ruin my relationship.
I mean, what's your encore ?

1510
01:26:04,097 --> 01:26:07,768
Do you, like, anally rape my mother
while pouring sugar in my gas tank ?

1511
01:26:10,304 --> 01:26:13,574
You know what the real tragedy
about all of this is ?

1512
01:26:13,674 --> 01:26:15,776
I'm not even supposed
to be here today !

1513
01:26:15,876 --> 01:26:19,246
Oh, fuck you !
Fuck you, pal !

Jesus, there you go,
trying to pass the buck.

1515
01:26:21,548 --> 01:26:23,450
I'm the source of all your misery.

1516
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:27,187
Who closed the store to play hockey ?
Who closed the store to go to a wake ?

1517
01:26:27,221 --> 01:26:29,289
Who tried to win back
his ex-girlfriend...

1518
01:26:29,389 --> 01:26:32,392
without even discussing
how he felt with his present one ?

1519
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:35,028
You wanna blame somebody ?
Blame yourself.

1520
01:26:35,095 --> 01:26:37,064
""I'm not even supposed
to be here today.""

1521
01:26:37,097 --> 01:26:38,866
You sound like an asshole !

1522
01:26:38,932 --> 01:26:41,001
Jesus, nobody twisted
your arm to be here.

1523
01:26:41,068 --> 01:26:43,103
You're here of your own volition.

1524
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:46,139
You like to think the weight
of the world rests on your shoulder,

1525
01:26:46,173 --> 01:26:49,142
Like this place would fall apart
if Dante wasn't here.

1526
01:26:49,243 --> 01:26:52,012
Jesus, you overcompensate for having
what's basically a monkey's job.

1527
01:26:52,112 --> 01:26:57,017
You push fuckin' buttons. Anybody
could waltz in here and do our jobs.

1528
01:26:57,117 --> 01:27:00,387
You're so obsessed
with making it seem so much more epic,

1529
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,823
so much more important
than it really is.

1530
01:27:02,923 --> 01:27:07,494
Christ, you work in a convenience store,
Dante, and badly, l might add !

You know, that guy Jay's got it right.
He has no delusions about what he does.

1533

Us, we like to make ourselves
seem so much more important...

1534
01:27:17,538 --> 01:27:20,908
than the people that come in here to
buy a paper or, God forbid, cigarettes.

1535
01:27:20,941 --> 01:27:23,243
We look down on them
as if we're so advanced.

1536
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:25,245
Well, if we're so fuckin' advanced,

1537
01:27:25,312 --> 01:27:27,714
what are we doin' workin' here ?

1538
01:27:45,966 --> 01:27:49,436
Hey, the floor looks pretty clean.
I put the cat next door.

1539
01:27:49,503 --> 01:27:52,973
- Need a ride home ?
- No, l got one. Just pulled up.

1540
01:27:53,006 --> 01:27:54,975
You workin' tomorrow ?

1541
