00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:41,765
OK... Here we go. Focus.

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,207
Speed. I am speed.

4
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:49,642
One winner, 42 losers.

5
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:52,274
I eat losers for breakfast.

6
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:55,819
Breakfast.

7
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:57,980
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

8
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:01,753
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

9
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:05,691
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

10
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:07,356
I am lightning!

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,799
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

12
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:15,600
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

13
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:54,970
Ka-chow!

14
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,151
Get your antenna balls here!

15
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:52,896
Go, Lightnin'!

16
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:56,964
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick.

17
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:12,479
Uh!

18
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,800
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

19
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,499
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

20
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:32,566
<i>We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.</i>

21
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:34,669
<i>Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.</i>

22
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:38,341
<i>If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>

23
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,474
<i>Right, Darrell.</i>

24
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,179
<i>Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,</i>

25
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:44,346
<i>heading into the final race
of the season.</i>

26
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:49,189
<i>And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>

27
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,955
<i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>

28
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:53,429
<i>have one more victory in him
before retirement?</i>

29
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:56,092
<i>He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!</i>

30
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,362
<i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>

31
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:01,803
<i>And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>

32
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:04,398
<i>He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.</i>

33
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,637
<i>Chick thought
this was his year.</i>

34
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:09,475
<i>His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.</i>

35
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:13,608
<i>But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!</i>

36
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:16,313
<i>You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.</i>

37
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:19,015
<i>The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.</i>

38
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,580
<i>But everyone knows him now.</i>

39
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:24,719
<i>Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>

40
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,389
<i>The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!</i>

41
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:30,332
<i>Three cars, one champion!</i>

42
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,004
No you don't.

43
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,709
Hey!

44
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:57,593
What a ride!

45
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,192
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

46
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:06,834
I love you, Lightning!

47
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:09,567
Dinoco is all mine.

48
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,575
Trouble, turn three!

49
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:14,874
- Get through that, McQueen.
- Huge crash behind the leaders!

50
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:39,635
Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

51
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:42,537
There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

52
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:43,835
Not in one piece, that is.

53
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:00,151
Yeah!

54
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:02,193
Lightning! Oh!

55
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:06,563
Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

56
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:09,099
A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

57
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,294
Yeah! Ka-chow!

58
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,634
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

59
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:17,675
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

60
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,972
While everyone
heads into the pits,

61
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,807
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

62
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,872
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

63
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:32,089
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

64
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:34,090
- McQueen made it!
- What?

65
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:35,216
He's not pitting!

66
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:38,421
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

67
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,259
McQueen's not going into the pits!

68
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:43,892
The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

69
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,266
- Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

70
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:48,567
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

71
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,041
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

72
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,510
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

73
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,493
Come on, come on, come on!

74
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,967
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

75
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:27,739
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- What?

76
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,938
You need tires, you idiot!

77
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:33,250
Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

78
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:34,751
Right. No tires again.

79
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,515
That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

80
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:41,251
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

81
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:53,599
This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

82
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,538
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

83
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:58,905
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

84
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,613
Checkered flag, here I come!

85
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,676
No! McQueen's blown a tire!

86
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:12,484
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

87
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:15,117
You fool!

88
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:18,962
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

89
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,520
Go, go, go!

90
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:31,436
He's lost another tire!

91
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,740
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!

92
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,677
Come on.

93
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,779
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

94
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:44,379
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

95
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:52,722
The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

96
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,865
Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

97
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:01,734
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

98
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:03,171
Lightning!

99
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:06,466
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

100
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:10,002
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

101
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:12,106
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

102
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:25,820
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

103
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:28,092
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

104
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,700
<i>We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.</i>

105
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:33,236
<i>McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.</i>

106
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:34,293
<i>Tell me about it!</i>

107
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:37,034
<i>Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?</i>

108
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:40,544
<i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.</i>

109
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:44,513
<i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?</i>

110
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,516
<i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>

111
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:48,711
<i>- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>

112
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:50,947
<i>No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>

113
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:52,455
<i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>

114
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:54,582
<i>That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.</i>

115
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:57,287
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

116
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,056
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

117
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,825
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

118
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,889
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

119
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:06,562
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

120
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:10,698
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

121
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,470
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

122
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:16,309
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

123
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:20,349
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

124
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,079
Oh, whatever.

125
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:24,178
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

126
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:27,554
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

127
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,855
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

128
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,452
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

129
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,192
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

130
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:39,828
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

131
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,735
In your dreams, Thunder.

132
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:44,900
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

133
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,809
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

134
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,676
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

135
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:52,181
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

136
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,945
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

137
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:55,485
Right in the lens.

138
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,814
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

139
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:01,188
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

140
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:10,957
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

141
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:12,024
Thank you, King.

142
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:14,867
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

143
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:16,304
It's the least I could do.

144
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:19,605
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

145
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:22,475
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

146
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:24,242
Kch-i-ka-chow!

147
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:26,977
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

148
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:30,316
We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

149
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:32,879
I love being me.

150
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:36,051
- OK, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!

151
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,862
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

152
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,490
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

153
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,364
You got more talent in one lug nut

154
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:46,995
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

155
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,665
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.

156
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,300
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

157
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:55,470
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

158
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:58,572
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

159
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,948
and you let them
do their job, like they should.

160
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,749
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.

161
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,722
Yeah...

162
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,022
Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

163
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,811
Oh, Lightning!

164
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:42,090
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

165
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,788
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

166
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:47,296
Thank you, Mr. The King.

167
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,458
Ladies and gentlemen,

168
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,763
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

169
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:55,533
A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

170
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,998
Yes!

171
00:12:57,074 --> 00:13:00,009
...we have a three-way tie.

172
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:09,718
Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

173
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:12,449
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

174
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:16,925
Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

175
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:21,226
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

176
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:24,730
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

177
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:28,499
Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.

178
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:31,541
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

179
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:38,044
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

180
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:41,246
Yep! All right! Got it!

181
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:44,777
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself. "

182
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:47,483
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

183
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:48,650
Huh?

184
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:52,059
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

185
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,996
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

186
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,261
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

187
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:59,326
Gotta make your personal appearance.

188
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,963
No. No! No, no, no, no!

189
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:04,506
<i>Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.</i>

190
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:08,204
<i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!</i>

191
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,976
<i>Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.</i>

192
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,817
<i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>

193
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:18,616
<i>Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!</i>

194
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:19,951
<i>Ka-chow!</i>

195
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,218
I met this car from Swampscott.

196
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:28,356
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

197
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:31,299
You could see his dirty undercarriage.

198
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:35,601
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

199
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:39,074
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

200
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:42,044
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

201
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:46,072
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

202
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,584
But remember,
all that salt and grime...

203
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:50,620
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

204
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,656
Hey, look! There he is!

205
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,691
Our almost champ!

206
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,420
Get your rear end in here.

207
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:58,519
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

208
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:00,757
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

209
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:02,890
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

210
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,798
Yes, I know.

211
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,427
"Fred. " Fred, thank you.

212
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,095
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

213
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,134
Looking good, Freddie!

214
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,676
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

215
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:16,269
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

216
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,372
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

217
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:20,781
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

218
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:23,843
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

219
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:25,912
because the track is always lit.

220
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,187
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

221
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:37,864
- Ladies and gentlemen,
- Lightning McQueen!

222
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:42,772
Free Bird!

223
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,173
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

224
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:48,108
ran a great race today.

225
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,844
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

226
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:53,109
And an insane
amount of luck,

227
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:57,712
...you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.

228
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:01,824
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.

229
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,360
And we're looking forward
to another great year.

230
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:05,725
Just like this year!

231
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:09,599
Not on your life.

232
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:13,395
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

233
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:16,463
<i>California, here we come!</i>

234
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:19,236
Dinoco, here we come!

235
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:12,980
Oh... oh... uh,
I needed this. Hello?

236
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:16,652
<i>Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?</i>

237
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:18,854
Is this Harv,
the world's greatest agent?

238
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:21,693
<i>And it is such an honor
to be your agent</i>

239
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:24,791
<i>that it almost hurts me to take
ten percent of your winnings.</i>

240
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:29,965
<i>Merchandising. And ancillary rights in
perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!</i>

241
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,531
<i>I didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.</i>

242
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,736
Thanks, Harv.

243
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:37,474
<i>Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets
for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.</i>

244
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:40,244
<i>I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.</i>

245
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:43,445
<i>- You let Harv rock it for you, baby.
- Right. Friends.</i>

246
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,454
Yes, there's...

247
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:48,986
<i>OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.</i>

248
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,187
<i>So many you can't even narrow it down.
Hey, when you get to town,</i>

249
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:54,423
<i>you better make time
for your best friend!</i>

250
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:56,659
<i>Break bread
with your mishpocheh here!</i>

251
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,793
That'd be great!
We should totally...

252
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,633
<i>OK, I gotta jump, kid.
Let me know how it goes. I'm out.</i>

253
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:07,968
What? A minivan?

254
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:09,740
<i>Come on, you're in the slow lane.</i>

255
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:12,145
<i>This is Lightning McQueen
you're hauling here.</i>

256
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,741
Just stopping off
for a quick breather, kid.

257
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:17,252
<i>- Old Mack needs a rest.
- Absolutely not.</i>

258
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:21,052
<i>We're driving all night till we
get to California. We agreed to it.</i>

259
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:25,323
All night? May I remind you
federal DOT regs state...

260
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:28,456
<i>Come on, I need to get there
before Chick and hang with Dinoco.</i>

261
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,625
All those sleeping trucks.

262
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:33,431
<i>Hey, kid,
I don't know if I can make it.</i>

263
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:34,937
Oh, sure you can, Mack.

264
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:37,337
Look, it'll be easy.
I'll stay up with you.

265
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:40,275
<i>- All night?
- All night long.</i>

266
00:19:58,028 --> 00:20:00,690
Uh!

267
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,298
Ah-choo!

268
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:01,391
- Hey, yo, D.J.
- What up?

269
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,484
We got ourselves a nodder.

270
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:14,370
Pretty music.

271
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:17,839
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

272
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:20,407
- Right back at ya!
- Yeah!

273
00:21:20,477 --> 00:21:23,571
- Oops! I missed.
- You going on vacation?

274
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:46,332
- Oh, no, Snot Rod...
- He's gonna blow!

275
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:49,236
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

276
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:50,600
Gesundheit!

277
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:54,770
One should never drive while drowsy.

278
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:10,285
Uh! Ah!

279
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,765
Mack!

280
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:23,003
Mack!

281
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:30,204
Mack!

282
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:33,113
Hey, Mack! Mack!

283
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:36,777
Mack!

284
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:39,379
Mack, wait for me!

285
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:49,193
Mack!

286
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,846
Mack! Mack!

287
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:16,492
Mack! Mack...

288
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,028
...wait up! Mack.

289
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:22,027
Mack! Mack!

290
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:24,294
What? You're not Mack.

291
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:29,135
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

292
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:32,134
Turn on your lights, you moron!

293
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:39,241
Mack... The Interstate!

294
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,796
Huh?

295
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:56,731
Not in my town, you don't.

296
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:02,834
Oh, no.

297
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,465
Oh, maybe he can help me!

298
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,806
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?

299
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:11,243
I haven't gone this fast in years.

300
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:14,148
I'm gonna
blow a gasket or somethin'.

301
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:16,549
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

302
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,315
What in the blue blazes?

303
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:19,912
Crazy hot-rodder.

304
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:25,513
I'm telling you, man,
every third blink is slower.

305
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:32,689
The sixties weren't good to you,
were they?

306
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:45,302
What? That's not the Interstate!

307
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,240
Ah! Oh!

308
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,609
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

309
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:56,049
No, no, no, no, no, no!

310
00:25:57,454 --> 00:25:58,546
Ow!

311
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:03,783
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

312
00:26:04,227 --> 00:26:05,922
- Incoming!
- Whoa, man.

313
00:26:05,996 --> 00:26:07,327
- No!
- Hey!

314
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:09,662
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

315
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,896
My tires!

316
00:26:57,547 --> 00:27:00,778
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

317
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,896
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

318
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:20,064
<i>We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway</i>

319
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:22,662
<i>as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,</i>

320
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:25,037
<i>is arriving at the track.</i>

321
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:27,042
<i>Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?</i>

322
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,270
<i>What's your strategy?</i>

323
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:33,009
<i>What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?</i>

324
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:37,918
<i>McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.</i>

325
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:41,947
<i>- McQueen was reported missing.
- ... to race an unprecedented...</i>

326
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:44,585
<i>Sponsor stated
they have no idea where he is.</i>

327
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:51,023
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

328
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:55,299
<i>I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!</i>

329
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:58,466
<i>Lightning McQueen
must be found at all costs!</i>

330
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:02,501
<i>They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?</i>

331
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,641
Oh, boy.

332
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,777
Where am I?

333
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:11,444
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!
- Ah!

334
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:14,646
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.

335
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:17,420
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

336
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:20,390
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

337
00:28:20,463 --> 00:28:25,423
- What's going on here? Please!
- You're funny.

338
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:28,562
I like you already. My name's Mater.

339
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:31,062
Mater?

340
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:34,076
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

341
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:37,409
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

342
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,469
Uh...

343
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:41,949
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

344
00:28:42,018 --> 00:28:43,042
What?

345
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,886
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

346
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,222
Where are you? Shoot!

347
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:51,851
You're in Radiator Springs.

348
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:55,329
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

349
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:58,265
Oh, great. Just great!

350
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:02,863
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

351
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:06,739
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

352
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:09,776
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

353
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:12,576
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

354
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:14,879
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

355
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:16,475
- Cool!
- Mater!

356
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:19,420
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

357
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:20,979
To not to.

358
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:25,494
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

359
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:27,655
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

360
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:30,598
"Later, Mater. "
That's funny!

361
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:31,856
Ah!

362
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:35,632
The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

363
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:39,232
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

364
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,709
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

365
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:42,802
- Fascist!
- Commie!

366
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:45,575
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

367
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,412
I gotta get to California, pronto.

368
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:48,644
Where's your lawyer?

369
00:29:48,718 --> 00:29:51,983
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

370
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:57,186
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

371
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,251
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

372
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,962
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

373
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:06,799
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

374
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:08,263
Show-off.

375
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:11,671
May Doc have mercy on your soul.

376
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:12,935
All right,

377
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:16,137
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

378
00:30:16,212 --> 00:30:18,112
I want his hood on a platter!

379
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:20,843
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

380
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:24,683
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

381
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:28,417
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

382
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:30,015
I'm...

383
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:33,929
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

384
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:37,364
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

385
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,092
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

386
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:41,433
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

387
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:42,971
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

388
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:48,000
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

389
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:50,546
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

390
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:53,047
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

391
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:55,050
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

392
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:58,281
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

393
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:01,916
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

394
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:03,952
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

395
00:31:04,027 --> 00:31:07,087
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

396
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,757
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

397
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,495
Agh! Ow!

398
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:14,969
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

399
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:17,063
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

400
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,906
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

401
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:23,571
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

402
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:27,343
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

403
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,418
Ka-ching!

404
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:30,578
Ah!

405
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,654
I'll keep that in mind.

406
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:35,222
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

407
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:37,890
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

408
00:31:38,628 --> 00:31:39,617
You know her?

409
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:42,665
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

410
00:31:42,732 --> 00:31:43,721
What?

411
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,896
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

412
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:51,805
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

413
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,536
What do you want, Sally?

414
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,977
Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

415
00:31:57,046 --> 00:32:00,209
No. I know his type. Racecar.

416
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:02,342
That's the last thing this town needs.

417
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:06,913
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

418
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,926
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

419
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:12,427
Here she goes again.

420
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,191
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

421
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:18,894
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

422
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:22,768
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

423
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:25,831
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

424
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:27,069
Ignore him.

425
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:30,510
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

426
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,912
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

427
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:35,780
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

428
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:37,342
And if no one can get to you?

429
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,754
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

430
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:44,658
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

431
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:48,128
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

432
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:51,725
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

433
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:55,293
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

434
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:58,499
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

435
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:01,135
- Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

436
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:04,044
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

437
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:07,344
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

438
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,647
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

439
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:11,744
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

440
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:12,810
Oh, he can do it.

441
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:15,687
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

442
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:17,225
Fix the road!

443
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:20,854
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

444
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:25,462
Order in the court!

445
00:33:26,236 --> 00:33:29,000
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

446
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:31,063
- Yeah!
- No!

447
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,471
Nice ruling.

448
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:36,701
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

449
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:40,647
That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

450
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,545
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

451
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,247
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

452
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,983
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

453
00:33:50,193 --> 00:33:54,152
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

454
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,290
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

455
00:33:57,367 --> 00:34:00,097
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

456
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:02,501
What? This place is crazy!

457
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:04,733
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

458
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:07,799
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

459
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:08,866
What?

460
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:12,506
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

461
00:34:12,582 --> 00:34:14,174
You gotta be kidding me.

462
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,912
You start there where the road begins.

463
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:20,279
You finish down there
where the road ends.

464
00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:24,522
Holy shoot!

465
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,461
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

466
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:31,091
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

467
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,327
Five days?

468
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:35,337
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

469
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:38,374
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

470
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:40,932
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

471
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:51,248
Freedom!

472
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,086
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

473
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:04,162
...and then...
then took the boot off.

474
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:08,035
Whoo-hoo!

475
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:12,764
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

476
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:16,710
California, here I come! Yeah!

477
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,073
Oh, feel that wind.

478
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:23,109
Yes!

479
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,312
No. No, no, no.

480
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:28,921
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

481
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:30,983
How can I be outta gas?

482
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,019
Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

483
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:37,430
But how did,
how did... you...?

484
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,832
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

485
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:42,803
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

486
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:53,614
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

487
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:54,775
Hey, Sheriff.

488
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:57,115
<i>- Why here?
- Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

489
00:35:57,186 --> 00:35:59,677
<i>- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

490
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:01,621
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

491
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:04,524
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

492
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:07,427
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

493
00:36:07,497 --> 00:36:10,227
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

494
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:13,200
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

495
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:16,636
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

496
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:18,936
That's why we made him the judge.

497
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:23,272
<i>Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

498
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:24,711
Now, I'm not one to brag

499
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:28,080
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

500
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:29,575
Oh!

501
00:36:29,652 --> 00:36:32,485
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

502
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:34,352
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

503
00:36:34,424 --> 00:36:36,688
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

504
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:41,458
No, no, no!

505
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:43,863
That won't be necessary.

506
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:48,233
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

507
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:50,932
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

508
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,365
Where's he goin'?

509
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:57,880
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

510
00:36:57,947 --> 00:36:59,471
I shouldn't put up with this.

511
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:02,416
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

512
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:05,511
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

513
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:08,985
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

514
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:11,686
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

515
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:15,754
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

516
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:18,130
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

517
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:20,294
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

518
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:22,360
I must scream it to the world!

519
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:26,670
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

520
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:29,234
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

521
00:37:29,312 --> 00:37:32,281
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

522
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:35,984
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

523
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:43,417
Is that what I think it is?

524
00:37:44,994 --> 00:37:46,256
Customers.

525
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:49,787
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

526
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:51,231
- OK!
- Customers?

527
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,133
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

528
00:37:54,203 --> 00:37:56,763
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

529
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:00,366
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

530
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:03,105
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

531
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:07,582
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

532
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,312
- Honey, please.
- Hello.

533
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:13,355
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

534
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:15,686
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

535
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:16,782
How can we help you?

536
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:20,920
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

537
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:24,228
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

538
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,734
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

539
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:29,636
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

540
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:32,765
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

541
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:36,903
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

542
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:38,674
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

543
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:41,945
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

544
00:38:42,018 --> 00:38:45,351
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

545
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:47,753
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

546
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:50,156
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

547
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:53,389
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

548
00:38:53,462 --> 00:38:57,193
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

549
00:38:57,266 --> 00:39:00,724
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

550
00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:04,739
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

551
00:39:04,807 --> 00:39:05,967
No we just topped off.

552
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:09,910
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

553
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:12,447
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

554
00:39:12,515 --> 00:39:15,848
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

555
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:19,081
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

556
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:21,453
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

557
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:22,855
Maybe ghost flames!

558
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:25,485
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

559
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:29,463
Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

560
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:32,558
OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

561
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:34,125
Ow!

562
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:37,400
A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

563
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,733
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

564
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:43,301
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

565
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:46,973
OK! Yes. You bet.

566
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,313
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

567
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:52,479
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

568
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:54,716
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

569
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,452
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:39:57,526 --> 00:39:58,993
No, not really. But listen.

571
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:02,690
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

572
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:05,290
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

573
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:09,202
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

574
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:12,436
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

575
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:16,376
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

576
00:40:16,445 --> 00:40:19,608
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

577
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:21,775
I'm becoming one of them!

578
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:25,780
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

579
00:40:25,855 --> 00:40:27,618
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

580
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,557
<i>We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>

581
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:33,356
<i>- That's good.
- ... after a Piston Cup update.</i>

582
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:37,331
<i>Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

583
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,858
<i>and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.</i>

584
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:44,100
<i>It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.</i>

585
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:47,939
<i>You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.</i>

586
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,177
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

587
00:40:58,254 --> 00:40:59,243
Ha-ha!

588
00:41:03,092 --> 00:41:04,081
Yeah!

589
00:41:15,705 --> 00:41:18,037
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

590
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:20,338
Oh!

591
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:21,774
Let me get this straight.

592
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:24,779
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

593
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:28,578
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

594
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:29,743
I got a road to finish.

595
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:43,997
- He's done!
- Done?

596
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:46,432
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

597
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:51,704
Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

598
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:54,641
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

599
00:41:55,244 --> 00:41:58,907
Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

600
00:41:59,482 --> 00:42:01,074
Oh!

601
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:05,114
It rides purty smooth.

602
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:08,812
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

603
00:42:08,924 --> 00:42:12,416
Oh!

604
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:14,786
Red.

605
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,731
Who do you think you are?

606
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:22,100
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

607
00:42:22,171 --> 00:42:25,607
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

608
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:28,142
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

609
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,839
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

610
00:42:31,914 --> 00:42:33,404
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

611
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:37,714
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

612
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:41,587
- What?
- Me and you. That a joke?

613
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:44,023
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

614
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:46,789
If I win, you do the road my way.

615
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:48,386
Doc, what're you doin'?

616
00:42:48,764 --> 00:42:50,595
I don't mean to be rude here,

617
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:54,397
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

618
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,995
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

619
00:42:57,073 --> 00:43:01,737
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

620
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:06,004
Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

621
00:43:06,082 --> 00:43:10,576
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

622
00:43:10,653 --> 00:43:13,588
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

623
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:16,181
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

624
00:43:16,258 --> 00:43:21,389
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

625
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:23,227
and no lollygaggin'.

626
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:24,857
Speed. I'm speed.

627
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:27,494
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

628
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:33,538
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

629
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:36,134
- Peet stop!
- Uh...

630
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:39,079
The race is only one lap, guys.

631
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:41,639
<i>Uno lappo! Don't need any help.</i>

632
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:45,551
<i>- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.</i>

633
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:50,724
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

634
00:43:50,826 --> 00:43:52,817
Gentlemen...

635
00:43:53,462 --> 00:43:56,295
...start your engines!

636
00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:05,438
<i>- Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.</i>

637
00:44:05,508 --> 00:44:08,602
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

638
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:10,275
Luigi?

639
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:13,543
On your mark, get set...

640
00:44:13,616 --> 00:44:15,846
<i>Uno for the money,
due for the show,</i>

641
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:21,618
<i>tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!</i>

642
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:31,430
Huh?

643
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,592
Doc... the flag means go.

644
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,003
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

645
00:44:38,073 --> 00:44:40,803
Doc, what are you doing, man?

646
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:44,437
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

647
00:44:44,513 --> 00:44:47,641
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

648
00:44:47,716 --> 00:44:50,480
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

649
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:53,621
You got your tow cable?

650
00:44:53,689 --> 00:44:55,884
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

651
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:58,256
Oh, just in case.

652
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:08,997
Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

653
00:45:09,071 --> 00:45:10,800
No, no, no, no, no!

654
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,340
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

655
00:45:14,076 --> 00:45:16,374
- Ow!
- Bad trip, man.

656
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:25,544
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

657
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:27,987
I'm confused.

658
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:30,150
You drive like you fix roads.

659
00:45:30,226 --> 00:45:33,423
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

660
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:39,064
Ah!

661
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:42,771
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

662
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:45,966
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

663
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:51,012
I can make a little turn on dirt.

664
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,513
You think?

665
00:45:52,581 --> 00:45:57,041
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

666
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,587
<i>Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!</i>

667
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:02,624
- No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

668
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:05,057
- That freak juice?
- Pass.

669
00:46:05,127 --> 00:46:09,587
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

670
00:46:09,665 --> 00:46:11,257
Nah, not me, Flo.

671
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,801
I'm on one of them there special diets.

672
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:18,465
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

673
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:21,305
"You race like you fix roads. "

674
00:46:21,377 --> 00:46:26,144
I'll show him.
I will show him!

675
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:38,824
Oh, great! I hate it!

676
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:42,523
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- Music. Sweet music.

677
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:46,292
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

678
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:49,098
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

679
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:52,197
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

680
00:46:54,743 --> 00:46:58,543
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

681
00:47:11,593 --> 00:47:12,651
Wow.

682
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:14,690
Mornin', Sally!

683
00:47:14,763 --> 00:47:19,962
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

684
00:47:20,035 --> 00:47:22,060
Yes! Uh, amazing!

685
00:47:22,538 --> 00:47:26,167
Whoa-ho! Yeah!

686
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:30,439
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

687
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:33,072
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

688
00:47:33,148 --> 00:47:37,278
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

689
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:39,548
<i>E bellissima! It's beautiful!</i>

690
00:47:39,621 --> 00:47:43,352
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

691
00:47:44,293 --> 00:47:45,590
Boy, I tell you what.

692
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:48,494
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

693
00:47:48,564 --> 00:47:50,225
Doc, look at this!

694
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:53,233
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

695
00:47:53,302 --> 00:47:56,794
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

696
00:47:56,872 --> 00:47:59,841
Guido, look at Luigi!

697
00:48:00,442 --> 00:48:02,171
<i>This is fantastico!</i>

698
00:48:02,244 --> 00:48:05,702
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

699
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:10,081
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

700
00:48:10,753 --> 00:48:13,449
That crazy old devil woman.

701
00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:17,323
Oh!

702
00:48:17,393 --> 00:48:19,224
She's right!

703
00:48:19,294 --> 00:48:20,852
- Ah!
- Guido!

704
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:24,695
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

705
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:29,768
Well, now... where the heck is he?

706
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:38,841
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

707
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:42,281
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

708
00:48:42,351 --> 00:48:44,717
and asked me if he could
come down here.

709
00:48:44,787 --> 00:48:47,187
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

710
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:50,089
No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

711
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,084
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

712
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:59,256
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

713
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:00,733
I'll keep an eye on him.

714
00:49:00,803 --> 00:49:04,705
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

715
00:49:19,087 --> 00:49:21,555
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

716
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:24,353
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

717
00:49:24,426 --> 00:49:27,759
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

718
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:31,322
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

719
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,460
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

720
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:37,630
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

721
00:49:37,706 --> 00:49:39,367
I'll put it simple.

722
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:43,605
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

723
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:50,084
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

724
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:51,949
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

725
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,615
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

726
00:49:58,427 --> 00:50:01,828
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

727
00:50:09,471 --> 00:50:11,405
Turn right to go left.

728
00:50:12,674 --> 00:50:14,665
Hmm...

729
00:50:14,743 --> 00:50:15,801
Whoa!

730
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:19,613
Oh!

731
00:50:20,082 --> 00:50:24,041
Ow! Oh, that...

732
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:28,988
Ow!

733
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:33,690
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

734
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:36,856
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

735
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:40,333
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

736
00:50:40,402 --> 00:50:44,338
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

737
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:54,774
<i>- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?</i>

738
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:59,219
<i>- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

739
00:51:01,823 --> 00:51:03,814
Oh, Lord.

740
00:51:03,892 --> 00:51:05,519
Mater!

741
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:07,755
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

742
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:11,128
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

743
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,032
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

744
00:51:14,102 --> 00:51:16,570
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

745
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:19,334
Oh...

746
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:22,070
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

747
00:51:22,144 --> 00:51:24,704
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

748
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,045
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

749
00:51:28,116 --> 00:51:30,414
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

750
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:32,510
You make-a such a nice new road.

751
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:35,250
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

752
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:36,916
Even though you not a Ferrari.

753
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:41,088
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

754
00:51:41,163 --> 00:51:45,031
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

755
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,627
I like your style, eh?

756
00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:52,265
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

757
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:55,799
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

758
00:51:55,877 --> 00:51:57,538
Oh, would you look at that?

759
00:51:57,613 --> 00:51:59,740
Ramone, Ramone!

760
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:01,908
Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

761
00:52:01,984 --> 00:52:04,976
No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

762
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:08,682
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

763
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:13,456
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

764
00:52:13,528 --> 00:52:16,395
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

765
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:18,959
Ah!

766
00:52:19,034 --> 00:52:21,161
Stop! Let me...

767
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:25,404
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

768
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:27,499
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

769
00:52:27,576 --> 00:52:30,909
Stop, stop! That's cold!

770
00:52:30,979 --> 00:52:33,470
Help! Please! Stop!

771
00:52:33,548 --> 00:52:36,915
Thanks, Red.

772
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:39,415
What was that for?

773
00:52:39,488 --> 00:52:41,615
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

774
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:43,180
If you do, you gotta be clean.

775
00:52:43,258 --> 00:52:45,783
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

776
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:47,590
What, I...? I don't get it.

777
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:50,257
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

778
00:52:50,332 --> 00:52:53,563
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

779
00:52:53,635 --> 00:52:58,265
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

780
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,208
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

781
00:53:02,277 --> 00:53:04,677
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

782
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:08,011
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

783
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:11,280
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- It's newly refurbished.

784
00:53:11,353 --> 00:53:14,811
Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

785
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:19,020
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

786
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:22,461
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

787
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:26,195
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

788
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:29,637
Cone number one, if you want.

789
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:33,105
Oh...

790
00:53:34,242 --> 00:53:37,973
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

791
00:53:38,046 --> 00:53:41,140
Oh...
That's just a... Oh!

792
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:47,052
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

793
00:53:47,122 --> 00:53:49,750
Gonna... Yeah.

794
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:57,090
You know, I knew this girl Doreen.

795
00:53:57,165 --> 00:53:58,655
Good-lookin' girl.

796
00:53:58,734 --> 00:54:02,033
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

797
00:54:02,104 --> 00:54:05,596
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

798
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:09,176
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

799
00:54:09,244 --> 00:54:13,374
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

800
00:54:13,448 --> 00:54:17,612
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

801
00:54:17,686 --> 00:54:21,247
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

802
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:23,621
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

803
00:54:23,692 --> 00:54:25,455
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

804
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:28,519
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

805
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:30,929
I can handle anything.

806
00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:35,834
- I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it!

807
00:54:36,104 --> 00:54:39,631
- Tractor-tippin's fun.
- This is ridiculous.

808
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:42,142
All right, listen.

809
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:46,203
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

810
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:48,112
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

811
00:54:49,117 --> 00:54:51,085
Mater!

812
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:52,586
Wait, Mater!

813
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:55,721
OK, here's what you do.

814
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:59,192
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

815
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:01,752
And they do the rest. Watch this.

816
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:10,635
Oh!

817
00:55:10,705 --> 00:55:15,904
Oh... Oh! Oh...

818
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:25,946
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

819
00:55:26,021 --> 00:55:29,821
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

820
00:55:29,891 --> 00:55:32,485
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

821
00:55:35,463 --> 00:55:38,057
Oh!

822
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:41,728
Oh! Oh...

823
00:55:44,773 --> 00:55:48,766
I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

824
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:50,607
Oh, your turn, bud.

825
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:53,079
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

826
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:55,378
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

827
00:55:56,518 --> 00:55:59,919
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

828
00:56:50,826 --> 00:56:52,225
That's Frank.

829
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,476
Run!

830
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:16,540
Here he comes, look out!

831
00:57:17,552 --> 00:57:19,179
Whoa!

832
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:25,155
Run! He's gonna get ya!

833
00:57:44,512 --> 00:57:45,604
Oh! Customers!

834
00:57:46,548 --> 00:57:48,311
Oh!

835
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:51,710
Ah, no, no, no.

836
00:57:51,786 --> 00:57:53,515
Oof! Oh!

837
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:57,957
Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

838
00:57:58,026 --> 00:58:01,518
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

839
00:58:01,796 --> 00:58:05,892
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

840
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:07,901
Oh, yeah... yeah.

841
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:11,063
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

842
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:14,336
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

843
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:15,398
Oh...

844
00:58:15,477 --> 00:58:20,744
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

845
00:58:20,815 --> 00:58:25,081
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

846
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:29,055
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

847
00:58:29,124 --> 00:58:31,854
Where, where?

848
00:58:31,927 --> 00:58:34,521
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

849
00:58:34,596 --> 00:58:36,757
- Yes, you do.
- No way.

850
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:38,025
- Way.
- Come on, look...

851
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,533
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

852
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:42,229
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

853
00:58:42,304 --> 00:58:44,169
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

854
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:46,264
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

855
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:47,865
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

856
00:58:47,943 --> 00:58:49,934
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

857
00:58:50,011 --> 00:58:53,310
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

858
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:58,284
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

859
00:58:58,353 --> 00:59:01,481
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

860
00:59:01,556 --> 00:59:04,218
What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

861
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:05,691
Mater? Mater!

862
00:59:06,895 --> 00:59:09,363
Mater!

863
00:59:20,508 --> 00:59:21,941
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

864
00:59:27,382 --> 00:59:28,713
Oof!

865
00:59:28,783 --> 00:59:32,184
Yee-hee!

866
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:34,519
He's nuts.

867
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:38,053
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

868
00:59:40,862 --> 00:59:42,591
Just need to know where I've been.

869
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:45,792
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

870
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:49,860
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

871
00:59:49,938 --> 00:59:53,169
Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

872
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:56,768
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

873
00:59:58,279 --> 01:00:02,010
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

874
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:04,415
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

875
01:00:04,486 --> 01:00:07,512
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

876
01:00:07,589 --> 01:00:11,150
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

877
01:00:11,226 --> 01:00:12,887
with private helicopters.

878
01:00:12,961 --> 01:00:16,226
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

879
01:00:16,297 --> 01:00:18,424
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

880
01:00:20,235 --> 01:00:23,864
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

881
01:00:23,938 --> 01:00:27,101
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

882
01:00:27,442 --> 01:00:32,141
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

883
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:36,809
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

884
01:00:36,885 --> 01:00:39,683
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

885
01:00:39,754 --> 01:00:41,517
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

886
01:00:41,756 --> 01:00:45,556
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

887
01:00:45,627 --> 01:00:47,458
In what?

888
01:00:48,363 --> 01:00:50,297
My best friend.

889
01:00:56,738 --> 01:00:58,467
See you tomorrow, buddy!

890
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:01,998
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath a tree,</i>

891
01:01:02,077 --> 01:01:05,740
<i>K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!</i>

892
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:11,177
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

893
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:18,456
Number one. Number one...
Ah, number one!

894
01:01:19,461 --> 01:01:21,952
- Ah, this is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

895
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:26,159
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

896
01:01:26,234 --> 01:01:28,361
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.

897
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:31,530
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.

898
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:34,336
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

899
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:37,139
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

900
01:01:37,212 --> 01:01:39,203
Something about a helicopter ride.

901
01:01:39,681 --> 01:01:42,445
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

902
01:01:42,517 --> 01:01:44,417
- Did you mean it?
- What?

903
01:01:44,486 --> 01:01:46,511
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

904
01:01:46,588 --> 01:01:49,614
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.

905
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:51,682
Uh-huh.

906
01:01:51,759 --> 01:01:54,956
You know... Mater trusts you.

907
01:01:56,331 --> 01:01:58,697
Yeah, OK.

908
01:01:58,766 --> 01:02:01,462
- Did you mean that?
- What?

909
01:02:01,536 --> 01:02:07,168
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

910
01:02:07,242 --> 01:02:09,904
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

911
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:13,478
Yeah, OK. G'night.

912
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:17,077
Oh...

913
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:19,347
Hey, thank you.

914
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:23,317
What did you just say?

915
01:02:24,025 --> 01:02:26,220
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

916
01:02:26,294 --> 01:02:30,162
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

917
01:02:30,231 --> 01:02:33,792
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

918
01:02:34,702 --> 01:02:37,227
- G'night.
- Good night.

919
01:02:41,442 --> 01:02:42,932
Hmm.

920
01:02:58,422 --> 01:03:01,448
Will you turn
that disrespectful junk off?

921
01:03:01,525 --> 01:03:05,359
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

922
01:03:16,374 --> 01:03:17,864
Ah!

923
01:03:24,281 --> 01:03:25,407
No!

924
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:34,888
No!

925
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:36,692
I gotta get outta here!

926
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:40,096
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

927
01:03:40,164 --> 01:03:43,429
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

928
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:46,993
I just need my
daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

929
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:49,198
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.

930
01:03:49,273 --> 01:03:51,935
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

931
01:03:52,009 --> 01:03:54,500
Hope you enjoyed the show!

932
01:04:08,092 --> 01:04:09,889
Whoa, Doc.

933
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,691
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

934
01:04:29,547 --> 01:04:31,378
What?

935
01:04:32,483 --> 01:04:35,281
He has a Piston Cup?

936
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:44,122
Oh, my gosh.

937
01:04:45,496 --> 01:04:47,521
Three Piston Cups?

938
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:01,835
Sign says stay out.

939
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,274
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

940
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:08,443
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

941
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:11,545
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

942
01:05:11,622 --> 01:05:14,147
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

943
01:05:14,225 --> 01:05:15,954
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

944
01:05:16,026 --> 01:05:19,689
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

945
01:05:19,763 --> 01:05:22,493
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.

946
01:05:22,566 --> 01:05:25,296
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

947
01:05:25,369 --> 01:05:28,805
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

948
01:05:34,044 --> 01:05:39,346
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

949
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:41,213
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

950
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:44,516
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!

951
01:05:44,588 --> 01:05:48,319
- Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!

952
01:05:48,392 --> 01:05:49,450
There he is.

953
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:52,519
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

954
01:05:55,766 --> 01:05:58,530
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

955
01:05:58,602 --> 01:06:01,196
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

956
01:06:01,272 --> 01:06:03,536
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

957
01:06:03,607 --> 01:06:06,906
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

958
01:06:06,977 --> 01:06:09,036
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

959
01:06:09,113 --> 01:06:12,708
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

960
01:06:12,783 --> 01:06:16,651
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

961
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,052
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

962
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:21,250
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

963
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:23,725
I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

964
01:06:23,794 --> 01:06:26,558
- Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.

965
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,393
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

966
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:34,228
- Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's OK. You can trust me, right?

967
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:37,001
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

968
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:40,274
Hmm... I trust him.

969
01:06:41,245 --> 01:06:43,543
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

970
01:06:43,614 --> 01:06:44,911
Yeah, a drive.

971
01:06:44,982 --> 01:06:48,110
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

972
01:06:48,185 --> 01:06:50,881
Ah... No. No, we don't.

973
01:07:13,377 --> 01:07:17,211
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

974
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,214
Mm-hm!

975
01:07:24,288 --> 01:07:27,746
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

976
01:07:27,825 --> 01:07:30,259
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

977
01:07:31,295 --> 01:07:33,263
That's so too much!

978
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:37,767
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

979
01:07:37,835 --> 01:07:39,826
I don't know.

980
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:46,699
Whoa! Yes.

981
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:05,154
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!

982
01:08:05,229 --> 01:08:08,892
Bleah!

983
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:14,889
Oh!

984
01:09:35,152 --> 01:09:38,883
Wow. What is this place?

985
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:40,955
Wheel Well.

986
01:09:41,024 --> 01:09:44,289
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

987
01:09:48,932 --> 01:09:50,661
This place?

988
01:09:54,271 --> 01:09:56,330
Yeah, imagine.

989
01:09:58,008 --> 01:10:00,738
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

990
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,638
You know, I don't get you.

991
01:10:04,715 --> 01:10:07,946
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

992
01:10:08,018 --> 01:10:10,213
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

993
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:14,451
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

994
01:10:14,525 --> 01:10:18,086
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

995
01:10:18,162 --> 01:10:21,563
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

996
01:10:22,332 --> 01:10:24,960
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

997
01:10:25,035 --> 01:10:26,798
And you know what?

998
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:30,499
It never felt... happy.

999
01:10:32,142 --> 01:10:35,236
Yeah. I mean... really?

1000
01:10:35,312 --> 01:10:37,041
Yeah. So I left California.

1001
01:10:37,114 --> 01:10:40,413
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1002
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,949
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1003
01:10:44,021 --> 01:10:47,013
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1004
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:49,987
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1005
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,893
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

1006
01:10:52,963 --> 01:10:56,694
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

1007
01:10:57,668 --> 01:11:01,126
I fell in love.

1008
01:11:01,205 --> 01:11:04,868
- Oh.
- Yep.

1009
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:08,507
- Corvette?
- No.

1010
01:11:14,051 --> 01:11:16,815
I fell in love with this.

1011
01:11:28,832 --> 01:11:32,563
Whoa. Look at that.

1012
01:11:33,437 --> 01:11:35,769
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1013
01:11:35,839 --> 01:11:38,034
They don't even know
what they're missing!

1014
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:41,374
Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

1015
01:11:42,846 --> 01:11:44,177
Oh, yeah?

1016
01:11:44,248 --> 01:11:48,150
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1017
01:11:49,286 --> 01:11:50,275
Really?

1018
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:53,050
Yeah. Back then,

1019
01:11:53,123 --> 01:11:55,990
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

1020
01:11:57,261 --> 01:11:58,592
How do you mean?

1021
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:02,063
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

1022
01:12:02,132 --> 01:12:06,330
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

1023
01:12:07,838 --> 01:12:09,829
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

1024
01:12:11,742 --> 01:12:14,540
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

1025
01:12:14,611 --> 01:12:17,171
They drove on it to have a great time.

1026
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:53,581
Well, what happened?

1027
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:57,108
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

1028
01:14:23,273 --> 01:14:26,868
How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

1029
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,741
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

1030
01:14:29,813 --> 01:14:33,476
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

1031
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:37,213
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1032
01:14:37,287 --> 01:14:39,118
I had a great time.

1033
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:41,919
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

1034
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,720
You're welcome.

1035
01:14:52,102 --> 01:14:53,364
Hey, listen, listen!

1036
01:14:53,437 --> 01:14:56,531
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

1037
01:14:56,606 --> 01:14:58,699
Wha... what?

1038
01:15:14,024 --> 01:15:16,083
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

1039
01:15:26,703 --> 01:15:28,568
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!

1040
01:15:28,638 --> 01:15:32,233
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.

1041
01:15:32,309 --> 01:15:34,607
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

1042
01:15:34,678 --> 01:15:37,704
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?

1043
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:40,280
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

1044
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:42,318
There's one goin' this way.

1045
01:15:43,286 --> 01:15:45,481
I got it.

1046
01:15:48,992 --> 01:15:51,290
Come here, little tractor,
come here.

1047
01:15:51,361 --> 01:15:53,625
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

1048
01:15:53,697 --> 01:15:55,062
No, no, no, no, come here.

1049
01:15:55,132 --> 01:15:56,497
What are you doing?

1050
01:15:56,566 --> 01:15:59,262
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...

1051
01:15:59,569 --> 01:16:01,935
...alone.

1052
01:16:12,315 --> 01:16:16,547
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tires?

1053
01:16:23,226 --> 01:16:25,524
Come on, Doc, drive.

1054
01:17:43,406 --> 01:17:45,203
Ah... Yeah.

1055
01:17:45,275 --> 01:17:46,936
- Wow.
- Huh?

1056
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:48,602
You're amazing!

1057
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,844
What are you doin'?

1058
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:54,611
Doc, wait!

1059
01:17:58,488 --> 01:18:00,922
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.

1060
01:18:03,827 --> 01:18:07,024
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1061
01:18:07,097 --> 01:18:10,396
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1062
01:18:10,467 --> 01:18:12,298
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.

1063
01:18:12,369 --> 01:18:15,361
I'm a racecar,
you're a much older racecar,

1064
01:18:15,438 --> 01:18:17,429
but under the hood
you and I are the same.

1065
01:18:17,507 --> 01:18:20,567
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

1066
01:18:20,644 --> 01:18:23,579
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

1067
01:18:25,448 --> 01:18:27,916
You think I quit?

1068
01:18:40,497 --> 01:18:42,192
Right.

1069
01:18:42,832 --> 01:18:45,460
Your big wreck in '54.

1070
01:18:46,202 --> 01:18:48,500
They quit on me.

1071
01:18:48,571 --> 01:18:52,132
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.

1072
01:18:52,208 --> 01:18:55,109
You know what they said?
"You're history. "

1073
01:18:55,178 --> 01:18:58,238
Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

1074
01:19:01,084 --> 01:19:03,314
There was a lot left in me.

1075
01:19:04,054 --> 01:19:07,046
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1076
01:19:08,558 --> 01:19:12,585
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

1077
01:19:13,763 --> 01:19:16,926
I just never expected that
that world would...

1078
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,195
...would find me here.

1079
01:19:20,303 --> 01:19:22,897
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Oh, yeah?

1080
01:19:22,972 --> 01:19:23,961
No, I'm not.

1081
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,874
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?

1082
01:19:27,944 --> 01:19:32,540
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

1083
01:19:34,384 --> 01:19:37,376
Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

1084
01:19:37,787 --> 01:19:41,553
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

1085
01:19:42,192 --> 01:19:45,320
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.

1086
01:19:45,895 --> 01:19:47,920
Oh, like you?
You've been here how long

1087
01:19:47,997 --> 01:19:50,227
and your friends
don't even know who you are?

1088
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,959
Who's caring about only himself?

1089
01:19:53,036 --> 01:19:55,834
Just finish that road
and get outta here!

1090
01:20:09,986 --> 01:20:12,682
Will you turn that
disrespectful junk off?

1091
01:20:12,756 --> 01:20:15,190
Respect the classics, man.

1092
01:20:24,934 --> 01:20:27,732
Ah...

1093
01:20:41,651 --> 01:20:43,016
He's done.

1094
01:20:43,086 --> 01:20:46,317
He must've finished it
while we was all sleepin'.

1095
01:20:46,389 --> 01:20:48,619
Good riddance.

1096
01:20:56,499 --> 01:20:57,932
He's gone?

1097
01:20:58,001 --> 01:21:01,027
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.

1098
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:10,810
- Oh, dude, are you crying?
- No! I'm happy!

1099
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,849
I don't have to watch him
every second of the day anymore!

1100
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:15,111
I'm glad he's gone!

1101
01:21:21,724 --> 01:21:23,521
What's wrong with Red?

1102
01:21:23,593 --> 01:21:26,994
Oh, he's just sad
'cause you left town

1103
01:21:27,063 --> 01:21:29,998
and went to your big race to win
the Piston Cup

1104
01:21:30,066 --> 01:21:32,933
that you've always dreamed about
your whole life

1105
01:21:33,002 --> 01:21:38,531
and get that big ol' sponsor and that
fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1106
01:21:43,179 --> 01:21:45,477
Wait a minute!

1107
01:21:46,883 --> 01:21:49,716
I knowed you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1108
01:21:49,786 --> 01:21:52,516
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.

1109
01:21:52,589 --> 01:21:56,252
Don't worry. I'll give you
a police escort, and we'll make up time.

1110
01:21:56,326 --> 01:21:57,486
Thank you, Sheriff.

1111
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,687
But you know I can't go just yet.

1112
01:21:59,762 --> 01:22:01,252
Well, why not?

1113
01:22:01,331 --> 01:22:04,164
I'm not sure these tires...

1114
01:22:04,234 --> 01:22:07,135
...can get me to California.
- Peet stop?

1115
01:22:07,203 --> 01:22:10,468
Yeah, does anybody know
what time Luigi's opens?

1116
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,875
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1117
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,706
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1118
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:16,504
<i>Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!</i>

1119
01:22:16,579 --> 01:22:20,675
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!

1120
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:24,345
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

1121
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:28,288
for this is the most glorious day
of my life!

1122
01:22:28,358 --> 01:22:32,351
All right, Luigi, give me
the best set of blackwalls you've got.

1123
01:22:32,562 --> 01:22:33,790
No! No, no, no.

1124
01:22:33,863 --> 01:22:37,230
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.

1125
01:22:38,368 --> 01:22:42,737
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.

1126
01:22:42,805 --> 01:22:44,272
But-a this...

1127
01:22:44,574 --> 01:22:46,405
Whitewall tires!

1128
01:22:46,476 --> 01:22:51,641
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me. "

1129
01:22:51,714 --> 01:22:53,511
All right, you're the expert.

1130
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:56,518
Don't forget the spare.

1131
01:22:56,586 --> 01:22:59,419
<i>- Perfetto. Guido!
- Peet stop!</i>

1132
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,735
What did Luigi tell you, eh?

1133
01:23:13,803 --> 01:23:17,261
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1134
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:19,201
Eh... No.

1135
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:26,674
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't I heard about it before?

1136
01:23:26,749 --> 01:23:28,740
It's a conspiracy, man!

1137
01:23:28,818 --> 01:23:31,286
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!

1138
01:23:31,354 --> 01:23:34,585
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1139
01:23:34,657 --> 01:23:36,784
OK, I'll take a case.

1140
01:23:51,841 --> 01:23:53,308
Ow! Eh!

1141
01:24:02,151 --> 01:24:03,778
Ah... Yeah.

1142
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,844
Ka-chow.

1143
01:24:06,723 --> 01:24:09,692
- Here she comes!
- Places, everybody. Hurry!

1144
01:24:09,759 --> 01:24:11,488
Act natural.

1145
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:12,892
<i>- Hi, Sally.
- Buon giorno!</i>

1146
01:24:12,962 --> 01:24:14,793
All right, what's goin' on?

1147
01:24:14,864 --> 01:24:17,025
Ladies and gentlecars,

1148
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:21,036
please welcome
the new Lightning McQueen!

1149
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:23,662
Pow! What do you think?

1150
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,935
Radiator Springs
looks pretty good on me.

1151
01:24:26,009 --> 01:24:27,806
I'll say.

1152
01:24:27,877 --> 01:24:31,074
Ka-chow.

1153
01:24:31,147 --> 01:24:33,672
You're gonna fit right in
in California.

1154
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:37,678
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.

1155
01:24:37,754 --> 01:24:39,585
Yeah, everybody except one.

1156
01:24:40,823 --> 01:24:45,817
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

1157
01:24:45,895 --> 01:24:48,921
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

1158
01:24:48,998 --> 01:24:51,193
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

1159
01:25:15,191 --> 01:25:17,989
They fixed their neon!

1160
01:25:25,401 --> 01:25:30,395
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby!

1161
01:25:34,711 --> 01:25:38,044
Just like in its heyday, right?

1162
01:25:38,114 --> 01:25:41,481
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1163
01:26:08,911 --> 01:26:10,344
Shall we cruise?

1164
01:26:10,413 --> 01:26:12,745
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1165
01:26:12,815 --> 01:26:14,282
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1166
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:18,684
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1167
01:26:18,755 --> 01:26:21,622
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1168
01:26:21,691 --> 01:26:25,058
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1169
01:26:31,534 --> 01:26:35,903
...and again and I said, "No. "
He asked me again, and I said, "No. "

1170
01:26:35,972 --> 01:26:40,306
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1171
01:26:40,376 --> 01:26:43,777
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive. "

1172
01:26:45,948 --> 01:26:48,940
Oh!

1173
01:26:53,289 --> 01:26:55,416
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1174
01:26:55,491 --> 01:26:57,789
Good evenin', you two.

1175
01:27:00,296 --> 01:27:05,529
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1176
01:27:09,639 --> 01:27:13,439
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1177
01:27:13,509 --> 01:27:19,175
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1178
01:27:19,248 --> 01:27:21,842
Not that. That.

1179
01:27:21,918 --> 01:27:21,984
Customers?

1180
01:27:22,019 --> 01:27:24,316
Customers?

1181
01:27:24,387 --> 01:27:27,049
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1182
01:27:27,123 --> 01:27:29,284
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1183
01:27:30,426 --> 01:27:33,020
It's the ghostlight!

1184
01:27:33,095 --> 01:27:35,689
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1185
01:27:36,566 --> 01:27:38,033
McQueen, over here!

1186
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,864
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1187
01:27:40,937 --> 01:27:43,064
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1188
01:27:43,139 --> 01:27:45,869
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1189
01:27:45,942 --> 01:27:46,931
Stickers!

1190
01:27:47,009 --> 01:27:49,170
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1191
01:27:49,245 --> 01:27:51,713
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1192
01:27:51,781 --> 01:27:54,978
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1193
01:27:55,051 --> 01:27:56,643
Sally! Sally!

1194
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,778
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1195
01:27:58,855 --> 01:28:00,584
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1196
01:28:00,656 --> 01:28:03,056
Come on, give us some bolt!

1197
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:07,619
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1198
01:28:07,697 --> 01:28:11,064
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1199
01:28:11,133 --> 01:28:15,001
You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1200
01:28:15,071 --> 01:28:17,801
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1201
01:28:17,874 --> 01:28:19,739
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1202
01:28:19,809 --> 01:28:22,403
<i>Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?</i>

1203
01:28:22,478 --> 01:28:25,003
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1204
01:28:26,616 --> 01:28:29,551
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1205
01:28:29,619 --> 01:28:32,884
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1206
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:35,214
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1207
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:37,147
- Harv?
- Come on!

1208
01:28:37,226 --> 01:28:39,922
<i>- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?</i>

1209
01:28:39,996 --> 01:28:42,658
<i>My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!</i>

1210
01:28:42,732 --> 01:28:44,927
<i>- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.</i>

1211
01:28:45,001 --> 01:28:49,404
<i>I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!</i>

1212
01:28:49,472 --> 01:28:52,532
<i>You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?</i>

1213
01:28:52,608 --> 01:28:55,076
<i>That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.</i>

1214
01:28:55,144 --> 01:28:57,442
<i>Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.</i>

1215
01:28:57,513 --> 01:29:00,038
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1216
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:03,312
<i>- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.</i>

1217
01:29:03,386 --> 01:29:04,580
<i>Playtime is over, pal.</i>

1218
01:29:04,654 --> 01:29:08,488
<i>While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.</i>

1219
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:10,252
<i>- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!</i>

1220
01:29:10,326 --> 01:29:13,955
<i>Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.</i>

1221
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:16,191
<i>- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?</i>

1222
01:29:16,265 --> 01:29:19,894
<i>You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!</i>

1223
01:29:19,969 --> 01:29:23,234
<i>- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1224
01:29:23,306 --> 01:29:27,299
<i>Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?</i>

1225
01:29:27,376 --> 01:29:29,105
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1226
01:29:29,278 --> 01:29:30,973
<i>No, wait. Where are you goin'?</i>

1227
01:29:31,047 --> 01:29:34,312
<i>Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?</i>

1228
01:29:38,454 --> 01:29:41,252
Sally, I... I want you to...

1229
01:29:41,891 --> 01:29:44,985
Look, I wish...

1230
01:29:46,462 --> 01:29:49,329
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1231
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:56,699
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1232
01:29:59,842 --> 01:30:03,039
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1233
01:30:03,112 --> 01:30:06,343
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1234
01:30:06,415 --> 01:30:09,145
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1235
01:30:09,218 --> 01:30:11,448
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1236
01:30:13,823 --> 01:30:16,849
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1237
01:30:16,926 --> 01:30:19,019
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1238
01:30:19,095 --> 01:30:22,326
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1239
01:30:22,398 --> 01:30:24,491
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1240
01:30:30,339 --> 01:30:33,103
<i>- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?</i>

1241
01:30:33,175 --> 01:30:35,541
<i>- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!</i>

1242
01:30:35,611 --> 01:30:38,307
<i>You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.</i>

1243
01:30:38,381 --> 01:30:40,679
<i>You don't belong there, anyway.</i>

1244
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:43,742
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1245
01:30:46,555 --> 01:30:48,785
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1246
01:30:55,931 --> 01:30:58,297
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1247
01:30:58,367 --> 01:31:00,767
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1248
01:31:09,245 --> 01:31:12,976
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1249
01:31:13,616 --> 01:31:16,744
Best for everyone or best for you?

1250
01:31:33,235 --> 01:31:36,033
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1251
01:32:35,598 --> 01:32:38,931
Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1252
01:32:39,001 --> 01:32:41,299
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1253
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:43,600
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1254
01:32:43,672 --> 01:32:46,140
There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1255
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,768
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1256
01:32:48,844 --> 01:32:53,178
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1257
01:32:53,249 --> 01:32:55,809
The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1258
01:32:55,885 --> 01:32:59,218
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1259
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:02,519
I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1260
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:06,584
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1261
01:33:06,662 --> 01:33:08,994
In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1262
01:33:09,064 --> 01:33:13,160
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century. "

1263
01:33:13,235 --> 01:33:15,863
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1264
01:33:15,938 --> 01:33:20,034
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1265
01:33:20,109 --> 01:33:23,203
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1266
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:24,268
He's hot!

1267
01:33:24,346 --> 01:33:27,008
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1268
01:33:27,082 --> 01:33:30,176
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1269
01:33:30,252 --> 01:33:32,777
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1270
01:33:32,855 --> 01:33:35,790
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1271
01:33:35,858 --> 01:33:38,622
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1272
01:33:38,694 --> 01:33:41,822
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1273
01:33:41,897 --> 01:33:46,857
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1274
01:33:46,936 --> 01:33:50,838
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1275
01:33:50,906 --> 01:33:52,168
Sorry, pal.

1276
01:33:52,241 --> 01:33:56,507
OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1277
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:00,077
I am speed.

1278
01:34:01,817 --> 01:34:03,011
Victory.

1279
01:34:03,085 --> 01:34:05,212
One winner, two losers.

1280
01:34:07,323 --> 01:34:12,852
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1281
01:34:18,033 --> 01:34:19,625
Lightnin'! You ready?

1282
01:34:19,702 --> 01:34:22,398
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1283
01:34:35,751 --> 01:34:38,584
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1284
01:34:38,654 --> 01:34:41,248
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1285
01:34:41,323 --> 01:34:43,723
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1286
01:34:43,792 --> 01:34:46,158
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1287
01:35:03,445 --> 01:35:04,844
Uh-oh

1288
01:35:15,724 --> 01:35:18,693
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1289
01:35:18,861 --> 01:35:21,091
And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1290
01:35:21,163 --> 01:35:24,291
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1291
01:35:24,366 --> 01:35:26,766
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1292
01:35:26,835 --> 01:35:29,895
Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1293
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,168
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1294
01:35:35,477 --> 01:35:37,809
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1295
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,781
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1296
01:35:40,849 --> 01:35:43,841
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1297
01:35:43,919 --> 01:35:47,082
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1298
01:35:53,929 --> 01:35:55,988
Agh! Shoot!

1299
01:35:56,065 --> 01:35:59,193
Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1300
01:36:05,474 --> 01:36:07,032
Come on, you can do it!

1301
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:09,134
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1302
01:36:10,346 --> 01:36:13,543
Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1303
01:36:13,615 --> 01:36:16,846
McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1304
01:36:19,021 --> 01:36:21,182
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1305
01:36:21,256 --> 01:36:23,656
Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1306
01:36:23,726 --> 01:36:25,455
He lost momentum,

1307
01:36:25,527 --> 01:36:27,825
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1308
01:36:37,239 --> 01:36:39,298
McQueen spins out in the infield!

1309
01:36:43,278 --> 01:36:45,872
Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1310
01:36:45,948 --> 01:36:49,475
McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1311
01:36:50,652 --> 01:36:54,713
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1312
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:56,223
I don't think I...

1313
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:59,021
I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1314
01:36:59,261 --> 01:37:00,785
Doc?

1315
01:37:03,465 --> 01:37:06,093
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1316
01:37:06,168 --> 01:37:09,934
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1317
01:37:10,005 --> 01:37:11,905
You said you'd never come back.

1318
01:37:11,974 --> 01:37:15,569
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1319
01:37:15,644 --> 01:37:18,545
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1320
01:37:22,518 --> 01:37:26,010
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1321
01:37:26,088 --> 01:37:29,353
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1322
01:37:29,425 --> 01:37:31,416
Now, get back out there!

1323
01:37:33,662 --> 01:37:36,631
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1324
01:37:36,698 --> 01:37:38,996
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1325
01:37:39,067 --> 01:37:42,230
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1326
01:37:42,304 --> 01:37:43,999
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1327
01:37:44,072 --> 01:37:47,473
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1328
01:37:59,188 --> 01:38:01,088
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1329
01:38:01,156 --> 01:38:04,922
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1330
01:38:04,993 --> 01:38:07,621
It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1331
01:38:07,696 --> 01:38:10,096
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1332
01:38:10,165 --> 01:38:12,861
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1333
01:38:12,935 --> 01:38:16,268
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1334
01:38:20,909 --> 01:38:22,934
<i>Wow, this is history
in the making.</i>

1335
01:38:23,011 --> 01:38:25,912
<i>Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!</i>

1336
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:27,380
Hey, Doc!

1337
01:38:27,449 --> 01:38:31,613
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1338
01:38:36,525 --> 01:38:40,325
- McQueen passes on the inside!
- He's nearly a lap down.

1339
01:38:40,395 --> 01:38:43,296
Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1340
01:38:43,365 --> 01:38:46,266
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1341
01:38:46,335 --> 01:38:47,927
<i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>

1342
01:38:48,003 --> 01:38:50,904
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1343
01:38:50,973 --> 01:38:54,409
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1344
01:38:55,577 --> 01:38:58,171
<i>Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>

1345
01:38:58,247 --> 01:39:01,410
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1346
01:39:15,864 --> 01:39:18,662
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1347
01:39:20,235 --> 01:39:21,497
What do you think of this?

1348
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:23,731
Yeah, that's it, kid.

1349
01:39:27,042 --> 01:39:28,339
What?

1350
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:30,207
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1351
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:36,246
- I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1352
01:39:36,318 --> 01:39:39,287
What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1353
01:39:39,354 --> 01:39:41,185
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1354
01:39:41,256 --> 01:39:44,419
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1355
01:39:48,063 --> 01:39:51,260
Look at that boy go out there!

1356
01:39:56,972 --> 01:39:59,270
Oh!

1357
01:40:00,208 --> 01:40:01,766
No, you don't.

1358
01:40:04,846 --> 01:40:06,837
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1359
01:40:06,915 --> 01:40:10,351
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1360
01:40:10,419 --> 01:40:13,718
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1361
01:40:15,657 --> 01:40:17,784
We gotta get him
back out there fast

1362
01:40:17,859 --> 01:40:20,794
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1363
01:40:20,862 --> 01:40:23,023
Guido! It's time.

1364
01:40:27,302 --> 01:40:30,396
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1365
01:40:39,514 --> 01:40:40,947
I don't believe it!

1366
01:40:41,016 --> 01:40:42,711
That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1367
01:40:42,784 --> 01:40:45,344
It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1368
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:47,115
It's gonna be close.

1369
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:51,258
Yeah, baby!

1370
01:40:51,326 --> 01:40:52,691
<i>He's back in!</i>

1371
01:40:54,029 --> 01:40:55,018
Peet stop.

1372
01:40:56,465 --> 01:40:58,399
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1373
01:41:13,682 --> 01:41:16,742
This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1374
01:41:16,818 --> 01:41:19,184
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1375
01:41:19,254 --> 01:41:22,781
A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1376
01:41:22,858 --> 01:41:24,120
This is it, kiddo.

1377
01:41:24,192 --> 01:41:26,683
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1378
01:41:26,762 --> 01:41:29,196
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1379
01:41:29,264 --> 01:41:30,663
Go!

1380
01:41:33,368 --> 01:41:34,494
We'll see about that!

1381
01:41:36,004 --> 01:41:37,562
McQueen's going inside!

1382
01:41:40,542 --> 01:41:43,568
- Chick and King are loose!
- I think McQueen's out!

1383
01:41:54,256 --> 01:41:56,724
- McQueen saved it!
- He's back on the track!

1384
01:41:57,125 --> 01:41:59,787
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1385
01:42:00,862 --> 01:42:04,491
Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...

1386
01:42:06,068 --> 01:42:09,060
Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1387
01:42:09,137 --> 01:42:11,230
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1388
01:42:12,741 --> 01:42:16,541
I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1389
01:42:26,888 --> 01:42:28,788
Oh, no!

1390
01:42:47,309 --> 01:42:49,504
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1391
01:42:49,578 --> 01:42:53,309
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1392
01:42:54,616 --> 01:42:56,743
What's he up to, Doc?

1393
01:43:07,129 --> 01:43:08,494
What are you doin', kid?

1394
01:43:08,563 --> 01:43:11,794
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1395
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:17,962
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1396
01:43:18,039 --> 01:43:21,634
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1397
01:43:21,710 --> 01:43:23,769
It's just an empty cup.

1398
01:43:25,881 --> 01:43:28,441
Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1399
01:43:28,517 --> 01:43:32,180
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1400
01:43:32,254 --> 01:43:34,552
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1401
01:43:34,623 --> 01:43:37,319
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1402
01:43:37,392 --> 01:43:39,656
That's what I call racin'.

1403
01:43:55,610 --> 01:43:58,670
<i>- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!</i>

1404
01:43:58,747 --> 01:44:01,341
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1405
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:05,944
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1406
01:44:07,989 --> 01:44:11,425
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1407
01:44:11,493 --> 01:44:12,892
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1408
01:44:12,961 --> 01:44:15,930
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1409
01:44:15,997 --> 01:44:19,125
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1410
01:44:19,201 --> 01:44:21,431
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1411
01:44:21,503 --> 01:44:25,098
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1412
01:44:25,173 --> 01:44:28,472
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1413
01:44:28,543 --> 01:44:30,010
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1414
01:44:30,178 --> 01:44:31,702
- Boo!
- Boo!

1415
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:34,874
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1416
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:37,043
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1417
01:44:42,958 --> 01:44:45,449
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1418
01:44:47,863 --> 01:44:50,297
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1419
01:44:50,365 --> 01:44:52,356
You're The King! Yeah!

1420
01:45:02,777 --> 01:45:06,235
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1421
01:45:09,451 --> 01:45:12,079
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1422
01:45:12,287 --> 01:45:13,948
Thanks, Doc.

1423
01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:16,421
Hey, Lightnin'.

1424
01:45:16,491 --> 01:45:19,153
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1425
01:45:20,061 --> 01:45:23,087
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1426
01:45:23,164 --> 01:45:25,928
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1427
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:32,106
But I didn't win.

1428
01:45:32,173 --> 01:45:35,836
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1429
01:45:35,911 --> 01:45:38,607
He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1430
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:42,844
buzzards used to circle the car!

1431
01:45:42,918 --> 01:45:44,647
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1432
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,450
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1433
01:45:49,991 --> 01:45:51,720
I'm gonna stick with them.

1434
01:45:51,793 --> 01:45:54,853
Well, I sure can respect that.

1435
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:56,090
Still, you know,

1436
01:45:56,164 --> 01:46:00,032
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1437
01:46:00,101 --> 01:46:02,626
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1438
01:46:04,105 --> 01:46:07,097
Actually, there is one thing.

1439
01:46:07,809 --> 01:46:10,038
Whoo-hoo!

1440
01:46:10,111 --> 01:46:13,979
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1441
01:46:18,486 --> 01:46:21,478
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1442
01:46:25,126 --> 01:46:27,424
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1443
01:46:30,565 --> 01:46:34,001
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1444
01:46:34,069 --> 01:46:35,058
to get tires.

1445
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:39,334
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1446
01:46:39,407 --> 01:46:44,606
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1447
01:46:44,679 --> 01:46:46,977
A real Ferrari!

1448
01:46:47,048 --> 01:46:49,175
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1449
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:52,708
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1450
01:46:54,022 --> 01:46:57,583
<i>Wow.
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.</i>

1451
01:46:57,659 --> 01:46:59,991
<i>Mi dicono che siete fantastici.</i>

1452
01:47:16,277 --> 01:47:17,801
Just passin' through?

1453
01:47:17,879 --> 01:47:20,177
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1454
01:47:20,248 --> 01:47:23,513
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1455
01:47:23,585 --> 01:47:27,351
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1456
01:47:27,422 --> 01:47:29,890
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1457
01:47:29,958 --> 01:47:32,791
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1458
01:47:32,861 --> 01:47:35,352
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1459
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:39,560
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1460
01:47:39,634 --> 01:47:41,795
blah, blah, blah.

1461
01:47:42,203 --> 01:47:45,195
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath the tree,</i>

1462
01:47:45,273 --> 01:47:49,903
<i>K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!</i>

1463
01:47:50,278 --> 01:47:52,246
Great timing, Mater!

1464
01:47:52,313 --> 01:47:56,306
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!

1465
01:47:56,384 --> 01:47:58,818
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

1466
01:47:58,887 --> 01:48:01,822
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1467
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:04,586
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1468
01:48:04,659 --> 01:48:07,253
Hmm... Nah.

1469
01:48:08,997 --> 01:48:11,232
Yeah! Ka-chow!

1470
01:49:16,297 --> 01:49:20,290
Ah-choo!

1471
01:49:23,103 --> 01:49:26,095
All right, everybody
please keep together now.

1472
01:49:26,173 --> 01:49:30,940
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

1473
01:49:31,011 --> 01:49:33,980
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

1474
01:49:34,048 --> 01:49:38,109
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1475
01:49:38,185 --> 01:49:41,643
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1476
01:49:41,722 --> 01:49:45,522
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

1477
01:49:48,862 --> 01:49:52,025
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Yeah!

1478
01:49:52,099 --> 01:49:54,624
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1479
01:49:54,702 --> 01:49:57,762
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.

1480
01:50:02,042 --> 01:50:03,976
Doc! Doc!

1481
01:50:04,278 --> 01:50:05,745
Whoo-ah!

1482
01:50:06,213 --> 01:50:08,408
Not all my tricks, rookie!

1483
01:50:25,032 --> 01:50:28,524
Attention!
Kiss the pavement goodbye.

When I'm finished, you'll have mud
in places you didn't know you had!

1485
01:50:32,106 --> 01:50:35,940
- Yo, I've never been off-road!
- Well, that's gonna change right now!

1486
01:50:36,210 --> 01:50:39,111
About face!
Drop and give me 20 miles!

1487
01:50:39,179 --> 01:50:41,170
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1488
01:50:41,248 --> 01:50:44,081
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

1489
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:48,711
Huh? Look at this!

1490
01:50:48,789 --> 01:50:50,950
It's my hood! It's my hood!

1491
01:50:51,024 --> 01:50:54,118
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

1492
01:50:54,728 --> 01:50:58,687
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look? Ah-choo!

1493
01:51:04,371 --> 01:51:05,633
Oh, dang.

1494
01:51:10,811 --> 01:51:14,338
<i>You are a toy car!</i>

1495
01:51:14,415 --> 01:51:19,182
<i>You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.</i>

1496
01:51:19,586 --> 01:51:22,316
<i>Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!</i>

1497
01:51:22,389 --> 01:51:26,086
<i>Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!</i>

1498
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:28,526
<i>Birthday guests at three o'clock!</i>

1499
01:51:28,595 --> 01:51:31,928
Oh, man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,

1500
01:51:31,999 --> 01:51:34,559
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

1501
01:51:35,102 --> 01:51:39,300
<i>We're banished, genius! Stuck here
in this wasteland without chains!</i>

1502
01:51:39,373 --> 01:51:43,139
<i>But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!</i>

1503
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:47,476
<i>- You're still not listening!
- Ah!</i>

1504
01:51:47,548 --> 01:51:51,177
<i>Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?</i>

1505
01:51:51,485 --> 01:51:55,182
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!

1506
01:51:55,722 --> 01:51:57,713
<i>Just get in there.
Go! Go, go, go!</i>

1507
01:51:57,791 --> 01:51:59,190
<i>Circus cars?</i>

1508
01:51:59,259 --> 01:52:01,727
<i>How can you be circus cars?</i>

1509
01:52:01,795 --> 01:52:04,320
<i>These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,</i>

1510
01:52:04,398 --> 01:52:06,389
<i>and they're gonna make me rich!</i>

1511
01:52:06,467 --> 01:52:07,593
Wait a minute here.

1512
01:52:07,668 --> 01:52:10,136
They're just usin' the same actor
over and over.

1513
01:52:10,204 --> 01:52:12,764
What kind of a cut-rate production
is this?

1514
01:55:38,612 --> 01:55:43,276
Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we
please ask someone for directions?

1515
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:47,582
No! There's an on-ramp close!
I know it! I can feel it!
