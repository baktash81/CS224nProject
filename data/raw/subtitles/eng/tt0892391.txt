Paul Newman: The names
we give our wild places

6
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:37,014
tell us something
about them.

7
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:41,349
This one in southern Africa
is known as the Kalahari...

8
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,617
"Land of the Great Thirst."

9
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,182
But this bone-dry land was once a
vast system of lakes and rivers,

10
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:53,517
one of Africa's
great wetlands.

11
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,681
Then, over time,
the climate changed

12
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:03,682
and a lush, fertile landscape
became a desert of rusty sand.

13
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:17,350
Life clings on here,
but barely.

14
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,348
Those that call
this place home

15
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,350
have been forced to adapt
or face extinction.

18
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:56,015
Here, in a remote valley,

19
00:02:56,017 --> 00:03:00,915
one small group of survivors
have dug themselves in...

20
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:03,917
[music softens]

21
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,184
and against all odds...

22
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:17,251
these creatures
are here to stay.

23
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:49,015
[churring]

24
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:51,847
This is Kolo.

25
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,348
He's just three weeks old,

26
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,848
and his entire life so far

27
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,017
has been spent
in pitch darkness.

00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:03,847
[meerkat churrs]

29
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:08,015
This is the moment he sees his
family for the first time...

00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,648
[churring continues]

31
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,014
the moment he starts to learn

32
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:15,017
how a little creature
can stand tall.

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,217
[squeaking]

34
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,848
His mother heads up
the whole group,

35
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,048
but it is
the extended family,

36
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,848
his uncles, aunts,
brothers, and sisters

37
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,847
who will watch over him,
teach him,

38
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,681
and see him through dangers.

39
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:02,683

[churrs]

42
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,014
The birth of his five
brothers and sisters

43
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,183
has doubled the size
of the family.

44
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,014
In many litters
there is a pup like Kolo,

45
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:50,016
one who stands apart
from the others...

46
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:03,581
one who is bolder,

47
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:08,581
more curious,

48
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,016
more independent.

49
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,415
[sniffing]

50
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:28,349
His brother is a year older,
and a full year wiser.

51
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:36,681
He seems to tower over Kolo,

52
00:06:36,683 --> 00:06:40,450
but measured up,
he's barely one foot tall.

53
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:07,081
Kolo must learn that he
lives in a land of giants.

54
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,150
[music fades]

55
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:35,149
The martial eagle...
meerkat enemy number one.

56
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,817
His eyes scour the ground
for unsuspecting prey.

57
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:56,082
With a seven-foot wingspan
and razor-sharp talons,

58
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:59,850
there is no eagle in Africa
more powerful.

59
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:19,014
This is the hottest and
driest corner of the Kalahari.

60
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:20,514
What little rain
comes this way

61
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:23,549
is funneled by hills
into their valley.

62
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,515
But what nature
gives with one hand

63
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:32,015
is taken away by the other.

64
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:35,180
The same hills create
rising currents of warm air

65
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,382
on which the eagle soars.

66
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:50,449
[squeaking]

67
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:28,348
That was a lesson
Kolo needed to learn...

68
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,348
"Stay close. Watch.

69
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,017
Danger comes from any corner."

70
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:39,181
Growing up will be
his greatest challenge.

71
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:40,914
Many pups never do.

72
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:44,115
They just don't
get the chance.

73
00:09:56,517 --> 00:10:00,114
Under careful supervision,
Kolo was allowed to play.

74
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:03,782
[churring,
tribal music playing]

75
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:38,781
Even a brush with the
neighbors is a chance to learn.

76
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:42,947
But should you keep well away
from a ground squirrel

77
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:45,182
or take it on?

78
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:57,014
[music ends]

79
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:59,350
His mother is less playful.

80
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:07,181
She may give birth to over
seventy pups in her lifetime.

81
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:11,181
These early months will see a third
of them fall victim to predators,

82
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:15,581
to disease, to starvation.

83
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,681
If she can just
get them through

84
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:19,847
the first critical
six months,

85
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:23,680
they'll all have
a better chance.

86
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,348
She needs everyone
to toe the line.

87
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,183
Everyone.

88
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,046
They live in a network of
underground tunnels and chambers

89
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:49,014
that plunge twenty feet
into the sand,

90
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:52,515
a secure sanctuary
from both the roasting heat

91
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:54,948
and the bone-chilling cold
of the night.

92
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:05,681
Huddled safe,
Kolo is just one small creature

93
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,847
who has survived
another day

94
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:11,350
under this immense
African sky.

95
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:24,015
[distant animal cries]

96
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:37,347
Today is the first
really hot day of summer.

97
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:42,481
By mid-morning it will be over
a hundred degrees in the shade.

98
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:46,347
Survival here now depends
on just one thing...

99
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,183
rain.

100
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:03,348
But until
the summer storms come,

101
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,683
they will have to compete for an
ever dwindling supply of food.

102
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:11,681
This means Kolo's mother must
leave him and the other pups

103
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,682
to forage further away.

104
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,181
But they are far too young
and inexperienced

105
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:28,016
to enter the tall grass.

106
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:44,517
Kolo's brother
is left in charge.

107
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:52,515
Six boisterous young pups,

108
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:56,013
and just one pair of eyes
to watch over them.

109
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,983
[animal neighs]

110
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,883

[squealing]

112
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,014
Like everyone
in the Kalahari,

113
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:31,680
desert lions
must scrounge for food.

114
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:36,949
They can't afford to overlook any
prey, however small.

115
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:49,283
[animal neighs]

116
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,846
Because Kolo's family
is small,

117
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:11,014
his older brother
must perform double duty.

118
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:14,350
He's both baby-sitter
and provider.

119
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,514
Meerkats mostly eat insects.

120
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:40,848
Almost every bug and grub
he roots out is passed on.

121
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:53,347
All Kolo has to do
is stay close by...

122
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:56,015
[tribal music begins]

123
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:08,517
but that's not Kolo.

124
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:08,682
One temptation
leads to another.

125
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,350
[music fades]

126
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:36,049
Something as big as this
would be a real prize...

127
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:48,013
but without his brother
to guide him,

128
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:50,680
Kolo doesn't even know
if he can eat it,

129
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:54,083
let alone which end to start.

130
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:11,347
The further Kolo's curiosity
takes him from his family,

131
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:13,615
the more vulnerable
he becomes.

132

[churrs]

133
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:10,847
Getting lost can lead
to grave consequences.

134
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:14,849
The Kalahari
is not the place to be alone.

135

[distant meerkat cry]

136
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:35,815
When Kolo cries for help,
his brother has no choice.

137
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:46,146
It's a huge risk,
but instinct compels him to respond,

138
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:49,516
even though it means leaving
all the others unprotected.

139
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:05,015
He just has to go.

140
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:17,382

[Kolo whimpering]

142
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:13,346
Kolo's brother
has saved his life,

143
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:15,847
and Kolo's recklessness shows

144
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,516
that he has a lot to learn
if he's to make it.

145
00:21:58,215 --> 00:22:03,016
Mother and Father come back
from the day's hunt.

146
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:15,679
They find the pups safe,

147
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:18,681
but it could have been
so very different.

148
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:26,249
Kolo is lucky to be alive.

149
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:32,514
In the Kalahari,
each and every sunset is another victory

150
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:35,349
for those who get the chance
to glimpse it.

151
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:49,249
[birds chittering]

But they are not the great
tree's only residents.

155
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:24,847
At this time of year,
snakes emerge from hibernation,

156
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:28,016
seeking a summer home
between the branches.

157

[meerkats churring]

158
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:57,680
The parents prepare
for their daily toil,

that's increasingly scarce.

160
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:05,682
They're unaware
of their deadly new neighbor.

[whimpering]

162
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:19,513
This is the cape cobra,

163
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:23,682
one of the deadliest snakes
in Africa.

164
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:08,648
Once again,
Kolo's brother has his hands full.

165
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:29,582
Reinforcements arrive.

166
00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:38,680
The cobra is six foot
of coiled muscle.

167
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:42,181
Its bite has enough venom
to kill ten men.

168
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,782
This is the mob.

169
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:11,312
Side by side,
the family seems more intimidating

170
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,615
than they really are.

171
00:28:24,682 --> 00:28:27,846
Meerkats only have a fraction
of a second to react,

172

so keep your distance,

watch his eyes,

174
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:35,782
never turn your back.

175
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:41,513
Like its cousin
the mongoose,

176
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:44,680
the meerkat
will stand up to any snake,

177
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:47,181
no matter how ferocious.

178
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:57,679
Snakes often leave an area once they've
encountered such a determined mob.

179
00:28:57,681 --> 00:29:01,081
But this one? No.

180
00:29:05,582 --> 00:29:09,012
He'll stay close by,

181
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:12,180
watching, waiting.

182
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:15,681
Perhaps a young pup
will stray from the litter.

183
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:40,680
A predator on their doorstep
is unsettling,

184
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:43,514
but that's nothing new
for the family.

185
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:47,846
Snakes and meerkats
are ancient enemies.

186
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:52,182
Dealing with them is just one
survival skill that Kolo must learn.

187
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:10,979
Like all pups,
he needs a good teacher

188
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:14,015
to pass down
these ancestral skills.

189
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:21,145
Some youngsters
have many teachers.

190
00:30:21,147 --> 00:30:23,847
Others fight over a favorite.

191
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:31,514
After all his brother
has done for him,

192
00:30:31,516 --> 00:30:34,182
there's only one choice
for Kolo.

193
00:30:35,314 --> 00:30:39,314
[tribal music begins]

194
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:54,846
His brother starts by
teaching him a vital skill...

195
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:57,182
how to find prey.

196
00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:02,848
But it's so dry now,
there's not much about.

197
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:16,180
Becoming a reliable guard
with a keen eye for danger

198
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:19,346
is another important lesson.

199
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:23,681
Eventually, Kolo will have to
learn the meerkats' warning calls.

200
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:34,682
But right now he's too small
to spot danger...

201
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:42,682
and too young
to keep his mind on the job.

202
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:57,845
Together, the two brothers
go as far as the tall grass,

203
00:31:57,847 --> 00:31:59,179
but no further.

204
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:01,379
They know
that danger lies beyond.

205
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:02,547

It's the place you can only
see the largest animals.

208
00:32:08,815 --> 00:32:14,014
Others, smaller and more
lethal, lurk unseen.

209

[music continues]

210
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:26,679
All around him are tantalizing
glimpses of what lies beyond.

211
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:30,179
But Kolo cannot yet climb,
so it will be many months

212
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,847
before he's able to perform
lookout duty like this.

213
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:43,515
[music fades]

214
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:47,514
He needs time,

215
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:51,014
but for this little family,
time is running out.

216
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:12,845
Kolo's birth was timed to
coincide with the onset of rains

217
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:17,179
and the abundant food
they would bring.

218
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:19,678
But this summer,
when clouds form

219
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,012
the sun seems
to burn the rain away

220
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:23,847
before it even hits
the ground...

221
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:33,681
a cruel mirage that leaves
the valley parched.

222
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:48,846
The creatures on which
the meerkats thrive

223
00:33:48,848 --> 00:33:52,015
have long since
dug themselves underground.

224
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:22,279
Kolo needs to be taught
how to handle dangerous prey.

225
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:26,448
Without this skill,
a meerkat can't survive such lean times.

226
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:05,180
His brother teaches him each
step of this deadly dance,

227
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:08,681
and crucially,
how to disarm his victim.

228
00:35:42,548 --> 00:35:48,045
These are the secrets he needs
to survive in the Kalahari.

229
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:51,348
His brother
has taught him well.

230
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:02,845
Summer temperatures
continue to rise,

231
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:06,513
turning the valley floor
into an oven.

232
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:11,615
The heat saps the energy of even
those most determined to stay alert...

233
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:27,015
and sometimes you just can't
resist the need to sit down.

234
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,848
Well, at least
sleeping saves energy.

235
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:43,212
Dryness, heat, dust.

236
00:37:43,214 --> 00:37:45,013
The dead hand of high summer

237
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:48,348
presses down on the land
and all its inhabitants.

238
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:05,678
Not a drop of rain
for several months.

239
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,514
The fate of life in the Kalahari
now hangs by a thread.

240
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:21,180
The desert turns to red
as the plant life withers away

241
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:24,014
and the sand reclaims
the valley floor.

242
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:36,513
Meerkats carry
no fat reserves,

243
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:40,515
and the little family will
soon be facing starvation.

244

[meerkats churring]

245
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:16,081
Perhaps someone has noticed
that they are growing weaker.

246
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,679
The family has no choice now.

247
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:38,515
They must strike out and search
for food in the tall grass.

248
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:56,414
For Kolo, the tall grass is a whispering
forest full of unseen dangers.

249
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,746
The family may have left,

250
00:40:20,748 --> 00:40:23,345
but that flickering tongue
tastes the air

251
00:40:23,347 --> 00:40:25,514

255
00:40:55,681 --> 00:41:00,181
and this is when a small
family is most at risk.

256
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:07,348
There aren't enough of them
to keep guard all the time.

257
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:21,012
These last few morsels of food

258
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:24,614
make their land very
attractive to rival meerkats.

259
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:43,513
Rivals will invade
another's territory

260
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:45,679
to get wider hunting grounds.

261
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:48,045
This could mean bloodshed.

262

Not Kolo's brother, though.

357
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,580
[growling]

358
00:57:19,913 --> 00:57:24,045
Kolo finds
himself surrounded.

359
00:57:24,047 --> 00:57:29,678
He has to take the only
escape route left to him...

360
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,079
and that leads away from home.

361
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:34,680
[whimpers]

362
00:57:39,846 --> 00:57:45,513
Mother is injured,
but they've held on to their land.

363
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,678
They're one down...

364
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,346
Kolo.

365
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,177
His flight has taken him away

366
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:07,746
to an unknown world
beyond the valley.

367
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:25,514
Not even his older brother
had been this far.

368
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:47,178
Lost, alone, and afraid,

369
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,914
his chances look grim...

370
00:58:54,013 --> 00:58:58,679
and this time, there's no
brother to come to his rescue.

371
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:14,013
Even his basic instincts
mislead him.

372
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,445
He might think
he's safest underground,

373
00:59:19,447 --> 00:59:23,146
but out here
that's not always the case.

374
00:59:31,846 --> 00:59:33,846
[animal growling]

375
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:53,514
There is nothing sweet about
a bad-tempered honey badger.

376
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:18,513
Darkness is falling.

377
01:00:28,847 --> 01:00:32,178
Meerkats rarely stay
above ground at night.

378
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,180
It's too dangerous
and too cold.

379
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:50,512
Kolo must rest,

380
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:54,479
but there are no warm bodies
to comfort him tonight.

381
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,180
[birds chittering]

382
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,777
At home,
under the acacia tree,

383
01:01:16,779 --> 01:01:21,012
mother settles down with
what remains of her family.

384
01:01:25,013 --> 01:01:29,078
First they lost his brother,
and now Kolo.

385
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,080
[thunder]

386
01:01:48,347 --> 01:01:51,677
Smaller, weaker,

387
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:54,011
one by one
her little family

388
01:01:54,013 --> 01:01:56,680
is being pushed
closer to the edge.

389
01:02:13,012 --> 01:02:16,177
It's even worse for Kolo.

390
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:19,680
This is the first night
he'll spend alone.

391
01:02:22,112 --> 01:02:24,912
[growling]

392
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:47,845
[lions growl]

393
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:12,511
A meerkat can't survive
for long without his family.

394
01:03:12,513 --> 01:03:14,344
For Kolo,
the safety of the group

395
01:03:14,346 --> 01:03:17,012
is his only hope of salvation.

396
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:32,178
He's going to have to draw
on every skill

397
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,512
his brother taught him.

398
01:03:33,514 --> 01:03:38,677
His only real chance
is to find his way home.

399
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:41,680
[tribal music begins]

400
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:17,347
[music softens]

401
01:06:32,347 --> 01:06:37,344
Finally, Kolo picks up scents
that carry a thrilling message.

402
01:06:37,346 --> 01:06:41,177
His family was in this place.

403
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:44,180
[tribal music continues]

404
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,514
This is where
they fought the invaders.

405
01:07:06,845 --> 01:07:10,010
A few weeks ago
he could never have done this,

406
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:12,844
but now he's stronger
and agile enough

407
01:07:12,846 --> 01:07:15,644
to get the vantage point
he needs.

408
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:19,012
[music softens]

409
01:07:21,514 --> 01:07:23,347
There.

410
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:02,745
[animal growls]

411
01:08:08,347 --> 01:08:11,677
There's one last obstacle
in his way,

412
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:13,512
and it's a big one.

413
01:09:24,979 --> 01:09:29,344
There was a time
when Kolo might have panicked.

414
01:09:29,346 --> 01:09:31,347
Not anymore.

415
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:48,347
The whole pride
stands between him and home.

416
01:09:50,346 --> 01:09:53,512
They won't be moving on
from this kill in a hurry.

417
01:10:04,279 --> 01:10:07,510
His family.

418
01:10:07,512 --> 01:10:09,344
Just a narrow strip of sand,

419
01:10:09,346 --> 01:10:12,346
but it could be as wide
as the desert itself.

420
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:29,479
He can't risk detection.

421
01:10:55,646 --> 01:11:00,513
Stealth, patience,
and timing...

422
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:12,145
he'll need all three
to make it.

423
01:11:20,513 --> 01:11:23,247
[churring]

424
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:44,079
[barking]

425
01:12:02,846 --> 01:12:06,013
He can be forgiven
for acting like a pup again.

426
01:12:15,678 --> 01:12:19,011
However,
Kolo is no longer a pup.

427
01:12:19,013 --> 01:12:21,880
His ordeal
has transformed him...

428
01:12:26,345 --> 01:12:28,843
and just in time.

429
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,010
A new litter
is on its way soon,

430
01:12:31,012 --> 01:12:33,179
from the look of things.

431
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,612
[chittering]

432
01:12:59,179 --> 01:13:03,178
All childhoods
come to an end.

433
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,846
Kolo is now
nearly fully grown.

434
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,679
It's a hard-won victory
for the entire family.

435
01:13:42,645 --> 01:13:45,011
Now that another six pups
have arrived,

436
01:13:45,013 --> 01:13:47,579
a whole new challenge begins.

437
01:13:49,178 --> 01:13:51,843
The family
has a better chance now,

438
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:55,246
but only if the new pups
survive those early months.

439
01:13:57,013 --> 01:14:00,843
So this will be
Kolo's big moment,

440
01:14:00,845 --> 01:14:04,179
his chance to do
everything he can to help.

441
01:14:20,013 --> 01:14:21,178
[snorts]

442
01:14:23,478 --> 01:14:28,012
The rain has poured hope into
this corner of the Kalahari.

443
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:39,176
The desert is restored.

444
01:14:39,178 --> 01:14:42,345
The hardships of high summer
are behind them now.

445
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:03,511
Now Kolo can guard, teach,

446
01:15:03,513 --> 01:15:06,010
and protect the pups,

447
01:15:06,012 --> 01:15:08,678
just as his brother
once did for him.

448
01:15:27,678 --> 01:15:30,444
Just why they find the ground
squirrel so interesting,

449
01:15:30,446 --> 01:15:32,476
he's quite forgotten.

450
01:15:32,478 --> 01:15:35,179
[animal shrieks]

451
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:47,177
It's Kolo
who senses trouble first.

452
01:15:47,179 --> 01:15:48,912
He needs a better view.

453
01:16:34,312 --> 01:16:35,646
[squeaks]

454
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:41,142
The call can't be ignored.

455
01:16:41,144 --> 01:16:43,178
Kolo makes a dash for it...

456
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,044
but his father
gets there first.

457
01:17:35,179 --> 01:17:37,012
It's over.

458
01:17:55,678 --> 01:18:01,343
Not so long ago,
Kolo might have been the weakest link.

459
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:06,511
Now he has become
a key member of the family,

460
01:18:06,513 --> 01:18:08,346
someone to trust.

461
01:18:17,678 --> 01:18:20,511
It's not easy growing up.

462
01:18:20,513 --> 01:18:23,510
It never is for anyone.

463
01:18:23,512 --> 01:18:27,344
But here in the Kalahari,
in the heat and the dust,

464
01:18:27,346 --> 01:18:29,179
it's even harder.

465
01:18:31,912 --> 01:18:35,676
And Kolo has grown up.

466
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:39,810
He has learned
what it is to be a meerkat.

467
01:18:39,812 --> 01:18:43,843
He is now old enough
to do his duty for the family,

468
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:47,177
to guard, to protect,

469
01:18:47,179 --> 01:18:50,677
and to teach the next
generation how to survive.

470
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:53,678
[tribal music begins]

471
01:19:23,178 --> 01:19:26,178
[music continues]

472
01:21:24,845 --> 01:21:28,844
[music softens]

473
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:08,343
[song ends]

474
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:11,345
[tribal music begins]

475
01:23:01,011 --> 01:23:04,011
