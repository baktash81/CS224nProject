1
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:30,405
Yeah!

2
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:33,032
Stay! Stay!

3
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,951
- Stay!
- I got it!

4
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,680
Good morning, gentlemen,

5
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:37,683
and welcome to another season
of Indians baseball.

6
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:45,107
I know it may not seem the same
without Donald here,

7
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:47,819
but I promise you,
by the end of this season,

8
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:50,239
we will have made history.

9
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:54,785
Unfortunately, there are
some in the press who feel that

10
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:58,288
"the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps

11
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:02,501
"has no business being the owner
of a major league baseball team. "

12
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,963
Spring training begins in two weeks.

13
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:09,968
Here's a list of the players
we'll be inviting to camp.

14
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:16,140
I never heard of half of these guys,

15
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:18,643
and the ones I do know
are way past their prime.

16
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:20,562
Most of these guys never had a prime.

17
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:24,190
The facts are, we lost
our two best players to free agency.

18
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:26,150
We haven't won a pennant
in over 35 years.

19
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:29,654
We haven't placed higher than fourth
in the last 15.

20
00:04:29,738 --> 00:04:32,116
Obviously, it's time for some changes.

21
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,161
- This guy here is dead.
- Cross him off, then.

22
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:38,789
Spring training starts on the 1st.

23
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:41,834
How do you think the Indians
will do this year?

24
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,919
It doesn't look too good.

25
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:47,006
These guys don't look too fucking good.

26
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:55,765
Oh, hi, Charlie. Come in, have a seat.

27
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,434
I'm glad you called me in.

28
00:04:57,518 --> 00:05:00,520
I'm still unclear
about a couple of things.

29
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:01,938
Oh, really? Like what?

30
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:05,150
Well, if I'm the GM,
who's gonna be the manager?

31
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:08,403
I was thinking of Lou Brown.

32
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,363
Who's Lou Brown?

33
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,741
He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens
of the International League

34
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,618
for the last 30 years.

35
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:17,622
I think he'll fit right in
with our team concept.

36
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:20,291
What exactly is our team concept?

37
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,668
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about, Charlie.

38
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:26,672
I want to put together a team
that'll help us relocate to Miami.

39
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:28,049
What do you mean?

40
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,925
Some of these guys
are furniture movers?

41
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,595
I'm serious about this, Charlie.

42
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:36,349
It's no secret
I've never liked Cleveland much.

43
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:39,978
The stadium's falling apart,
we don't draw dick, the weather's lousy.

44
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,104
Another couple years of this,

45
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:44,608
and I'm gonna have to start
feeding Cha-Cha real dog food.

46
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:48,320
Mrs. Phelps, you just can't
up and move a team on a whim.

47
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:50,155
It's hardly a whim.

48
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:54,117
Miami's offered
to build us a new stadium:

49
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,328
62,000 capacity,

50
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:58,413
45 VIP boxes,

51
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,708
and for me, a mansion in Boca Raton,

52
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:04,712
plus free membership in
the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club.

53
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:08,383
Now, no other franchise in baseball
can match that deal.

54
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,009
The league will never let us
leave Cleveland.

55
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:11,761
We got a lease with the city.

56
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:13,513
The lease says
we have the right to move

57
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,890
if the attendance falls below 800,000
for the year.

58
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:17,892
Paragraph 40, line 17.

59
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:21,187
If we play bad enough, we should
be able to come in under that.

60
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:23,565
What are you saying?
You want us to lose?

61
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,943
No. We've been losing.

62
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:30,447
What I want is for us to finish dead last.

63
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:55,348
- Yeah?
- Hello, Jake?

64
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:59,269
This is Charlie Donovan,
the new GM of the Cleveland Indians.

65
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,645
Yeah.

66
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,522
We'd love for you
to come to spring training

67
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:04,065
for a shot at this year's club.

68
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,694
- Is that you, Talbert?
- What?

69
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:09,488
This isn't very funny, you know.
I'm hung over,

70
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,782
my knees are killing me,
and if you're gonna pull this shit,

71
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:15,327
at least you could have said
you were from the Yankees.

72
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:18,164
Tire World.

73
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:21,500
Hello, Lou? This is Charlie Donovan
of the Cleveland Indians.

74
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:24,378
How would you like to manage
the Indians this year?

75
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:26,172
I don't know.

76
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:28,257
What do you mean, you don't know?

77
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:30,469
This is a chance to manage
in the big leagues.

78
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:32,137
Let me think it over, will you, Charlie?

79
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:34,931
I got a guy on the other line
about some whitewalls.

80
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:36,683
I'll talk to you later.

81
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,519
Rick, we heard about your pitching
out of Portland last year.

82
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:41,563
I'm not really with them anymore.

83
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:43,356
Well, we'd still like to take a look at you

84
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:46,067
at our spring camp in Arizona,
March the 1st.

85
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:48,862
Well, I'm not sure I can make it by then.

86
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,064
There's Jake Taylor.

87
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:24,316
He was an all-star at Boston, wasn't he?

88
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,610
Yeah, wound up in the Mexican League.

89
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:28,695
Had some problems with his knees.

90
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,865
- Wish we had him two years ago.
- We did.

91
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,826
Four years ago, then.

92
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,043
Who is that?

93
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:44,087
Must be Cerrano.

94
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:46,965
Defected from Cuba.
Wanted religious freedom.

95
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:48,925
What's his religion?

96
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:51,928
Voodoo.

97
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,942
I thought you didn't have
any high-priced talent.

98
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,278
Forgot about Dorn,
'cause he's only high-priced.

99
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,446
Picked him up as a free agent
three years ago.

100
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:11,407
Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he?

101
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:13,701
Yeah. He just can't field it.

102
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:18,247
We'll shape him up.

103
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,916
Hey.

104
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:25,964
I don't recognize this guy.

105
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:31,761
Say, hey. Willie Mays Hayes here.

106
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:34,264
Play like Mays, but I run like Hayes.

107
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:36,349
How you doing?

108
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:37,893
How you doing?

109
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:41,981
- My man.
- Lou Brown. Nice to meet you, Hayes.

110
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:44,817
The parking lot is right out there.

111
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,362
Thanks.

112
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,866
Oh, and don't you guys go anywhere.

113
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,827
I plan to put on a hitting display.

114
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:59,540
I don't remember a Hayes on the list.

115
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:19,311
Look at this fucking guy.

116
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:27,487
My kinda team, Charlie.
It's my kinda team.

117
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:32,492
Mr. Dorn.

118
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:34,577
Harris! How you doing?

119
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:36,621
Hey, that weave is looking good, huh?

120
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:39,290
It's better than that rug of yours.

121
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,125
Whoa! Another freak show candidate.

122
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,920
How do you cut your hair, rook?
Vegematic?

123
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:48,592
The earring's cute, too. Have you got
the matching bracelet, veg-head?

124
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,387
Whoa.

125
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,603
- Watch yourself, Rog.
- Mr. Tough Guy.

126
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:07,778
Hi. Jake Taylor.

127
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,995
So, you got a name,
or are you gonna settle for "veg-head"?

128
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,747
- Vaughn. Rick Vaughn.
- Hi, Rick.

129
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:19,207
Hey, forget about Dorn.

130
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,792
He's always a little tough
on the rookies.

131
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,502
You get a lot worse from other clubs.

132
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:25,797
Say, hey! How you doing?
Willie Mays Hayes here.

133
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,590
Jake Taylor here.

134
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:29,843
Rick Vaughn.

135
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:31,594
What the hell league
you been playing in?

136
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,347
California Penal.

137
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:36,058
Never heard of it.
Well, how'd you end up playing there?

138
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:37,560
Stole a car.

139
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:44,942
Hey, big guy. You a golfer?

140
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,112
Hats for bats.

141
00:11:49,614 --> 00:11:51,782
Yeah. What's your handicap?

142
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:54,452
Keep bats warm.

143
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:58,165
Gracias.

144
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,377
Whoa, amigo, I...

145
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:04,129
You can't...

146
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:08,133
You're welcome.

147
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,362
This is the guy
that wasn't invited to the camp.

148
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,323
Let's take his ass out.

149
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,520
Shit! I've been cut already?

150
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:08,780
Who the hell is that?

151
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,677
Get him a uniform.

152
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:31,887
All right.
Did you get enough hay for him?

153
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:35,266
You sure?
Take good care of it, all right? All right.

154
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,645
Hey, Jake. How's the knees holding up?

155
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,147
Great. Never been better.

156
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,983
Mobility's good? No problem
getting off the throw to second?

157
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,192
No problemo.

158
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:46,570
I need a catcher, Jake,

159
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:48,822
somebody who can lead this team
on the field.

160
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:52,409
So, I want the absolute truth here.
Are you 100%?

161
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:54,452
Yeah. Would I bullshit you
about something like that?

162
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:57,247
You better,
if you wanna make this team.

163
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:01,501
Second base!

164
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:05,380
Shit.

165
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:30,407
Hold it. Hold it.

166
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:36,580
Well, you may run like Mays,
but you hit like shit.

167
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:39,208
With your speed,
you should hit the ball on the ground

168
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,417
and be legging them out.

169
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:43,212
Every time I see you hit one in the air,

170
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:45,130
you owe me 20 pushups.

171
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,383
Hey, no problem.

172
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:00,939
Shit.

173
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:07,737
All right, Vaughn,
they tell us you're a pitcher.

174
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:10,073
You're sure not much of a dresser.

175
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:13,117
We wear caps and sleeves
at this level, son.

176
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:15,079
Understood?

177
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:18,999
All right, let's see what you can do.

178
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,845
- Nice velocity.
- Sounded like it.

179
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,180
Jesus.

180
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,766
How much?

181
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,228
96.

182
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,024
Better teach this kid some control
before he kills somebody.

183
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,862
Come on, Dorn.
Get in front of the damn ball.

184
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,323
Don't give me this olé bullshit.

185
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,950
Look, I took one of those
in the eye last year.

186
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,285
I'm not about to lose my sight.

187
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,121
I'm deeply moved.
Every time you play one off your hips,

188
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,039
you owe me 40 sit-ups.

189
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,375
What?

190
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,359
Jesus. This guy hits a ton.

191
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:26,820
How come nobody else
picked up on him?

192
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:30,407
Okay, Eddie, that's enough fastballs.
Throw him some breaking balls.

193
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,419
Lou, I want a word with you here.

194
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:44,922
Sure.

195
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,303
About those sit-ups you want me to do,

196
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:53,014
I got it right here in my contract.
Says I don't have to do any calisthenics

197
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:56,768
I don't feel are necessary.
So, what do you think about that?

198
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:14,161
Two hundred pushups. How am I
supposed to hit if I can't lift my arms?

199
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:15,537
Shit.

200
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:16,663
The way I played today,

201
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:18,874
I wouldn't be surprised
if they red-tagged me already.

202
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,209
What do you mean?

203
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:22,878
You get a red tag on your locker,
it means the manager wants to see you

204
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:26,215
because you just died
and went down to the minors.

205
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,474
Hey, don't worry, kid.

206
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,394
They ain't gonna cut anybody
the first day.

207
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:50,199
What's that shit on your chest?

208
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:52,410
Crisco.

209
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,829
Bardahl.

210
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,039
Vagisil.

211
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:58,290
Any one of 'em will give you

212
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,751
another 2 to 3 inches drop
on your curve ball.

213
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,753
'Course, if the umps
are watching me close,

214
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:05,756
I just rub a little jalapeño
inside my nose, get it running.

215
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:07,800
Then if I need to load the ball up a little,

216
00:18:07,884 --> 00:18:09,802
I just wipe my nose.

217
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:13,056
You put snot on the ball?

218
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,103
I haven't got an arm like yours.
I gotta put anything on it I can find.

219
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:20,689
Someday you will, too.

220
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,756
Qué pasa there, Pedro?

221
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:49,719
Bats, they are sick.

222
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:52,138
I can no hit curve ball.

223
00:18:52,222 --> 00:18:54,640
Straight ball, I hit it very much.

224
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,811
Curve ball, bats are afraid.

225
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:04,067
I ask Jobu to come, take fear from bats.

226
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:08,030
I offer him cigar and rum.

227
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:11,325
He will come.

228
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:12,993
Hey, you know, you might think about

229
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:14,786
taking Jesus Christ as your savior,

230
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:17,289
instead of fooling around
with all this stuff.

231
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,542
Shit, Harris.

232
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:24,964
Jesus. I like him very much,

233
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,259
but he no help with curve ball.

234
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:31,262
You trying to say
Jesus Christ can't hit a curve ball?

235
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:34,265
Okay, Harris.
Let's not start a holy war here.

236
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:40,189
I wouldn't leave that rum sitting around
out here with this group.

237
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:46,445
Is very bad to steal Jobu's rum.

238
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:53,410
Is very bad.

239
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:01,961
Sí, sí, Pedro.

240
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:33,911
Attaboy, Dorn.
Way to get in front of that ball.

241
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:35,830
That's the ticket.

242
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:03,817
Gracias.

243
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:06,486
Okay.

244
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,086
Third base.

245
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:30,846
- Shit.
- Jesus!

246
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:34,391
He's safe!

247
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,189
Damn!

248
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:46,487
Jeez!

249
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:50,074
He's going.

250
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:55,622
- Come on.
- Out!

251
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:03,380
- Final cut-down day, right?
- Afraid so.

252
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,840
I don't wanna go in there.

253
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,717
Yeah. Look, whatever happens,

254
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:10,845
you just keep it to yourselves
until you get out of the clubhouse.

255
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,474
You don't wanna celebrate
in front of guys who just died.

256
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:18,104
Yeah, but what if
we're one of the deceased, huh?

257
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:27,279
Come on, Jake, it's only your life.

258
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:49,199
Yes, yes, yes.

259
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:17,686
I got news for you, Mr. Brown.
You haven't heard the last of me.

260
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,188
You may think I'm shit now,

261
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:21,941
but someday,
you're gonna be sorry that you cut me.

262
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,234
I'm gonna catch on somewhere else,

263
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:25,486
and every time that I pitch against you,

264
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,448
I'm gonna stick it up your fucking ass!

265
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:33,829
Good. I like that kind of spirit
in a player.

266
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:36,998
The only problem is I didn't cut you.

267
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,083
What?

268
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:41,253
I think someone's been
having some fun with you.

269
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:48,718
Jesus.

270
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:54,100
Hey, hey, hey!

271
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:57,728
Vaughn!

272
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:01,107
Come on, guys! Cool it!

273
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:02,692
- Don't fuck with me, Vaughn!
- Yeah?

274
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:03,776
Fuck you!

275
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:06,195
What's the matter, rookie fuckwad,
can't you take a little joke?

276
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,823
Oh, yeah. Real fucking funny, asshole!

277
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,701
All right. All right! Knock that shit off!

278
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:15,038
Lou, you better make it real clear
to this little lady,

279
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:17,291
I'm not about to take his shit.

280
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,126
Shut up, Dorn.

281
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,795
Save all that energy for the field.

282
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,882
Got a long way to go
before the season's over.

283
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:31,430
Hey, forget about Dorn.
We got other things to do.

284
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:33,015
Like what?

285
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,603
Like packing for Cleveland.

286
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,772
Come on.

287
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,708
Ricky Vaughn? Willie Hayes?

288
00:25:58,585 --> 00:26:00,711
I never heard of most of 'em.

289
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:03,130
Mitchell Friedman?

290
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,091
Who are these fucking guys?

291
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:27,614
Two down. Bottom of the ninth.

292
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:29,783
Game is tied.

293
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:32,619
Taylor calls his shot.

294
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:38,166
There's the pitch.

295
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,197
Yeah!

296
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:11,326
Whoo! Oh, boy!
Oh, you really got a hold of that one.

297
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:13,912
Yeah. What was that, a slider?

298
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:16,999
It was out of here.

299
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:33,141
Are you gentlemen ready to order?

300
00:27:33,225 --> 00:27:36,060
Oh, we'll need a few
minutes more, please.

301
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:45,570
I look like a banker in this.

302
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,241
Sorry, Rick, those are the house rules.

303
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:52,077
So, what are we gonna have?

304
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:53,954
What language is this?

305
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,289
French.

306
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,916
They got chilidogs over there?

307
00:27:58,001 --> 00:28:00,919
Forget it, I'll order. Let's have a toast.

308
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,133
Here's to baseball,

309
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:09,094
and to the start of two great careers.

310
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,556
And for me,

311
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:14,726
here's to one more good year
in the sun.

312
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,501
What is it, the chick?

313
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:42,213
- That's my wife.
- Does she know that?

314
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:44,673
I mean, she would have been,
if I hadn't messed it up.

315
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:45,883
Who's that guy she's with?

316
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:48,552
I don't know.
He's not wearing a name tag.

317
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:52,515
You want me to drag him out of here,
kick the shit out of him?

318
00:28:57,522 --> 00:28:58,563
Excuse me.

319
00:28:58,648 --> 00:29:01,274
Miss Westland, there's
a telephone call for you at the desk.

320
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:03,151
Oh, okay, thank you.

321
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:06,363
That's strange. I'll be right back.

322
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:15,413
- Hello?
- Hello, Lynn? It's Jake.

323
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:18,334
Jake.

324
00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:20,837
- Jake Taylor?
- Uh-huh.

325
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:24,257
How'd you know I was here?

326
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:26,092
Oh, just a hunch.

327
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:30,138
I took you there when you
got your master's degree, remember?

328
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:33,933
I figured you're wearing that black dress
with the red sash.

329
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:38,564
How'd you know that?
I didn't even have this dress when...

330
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:48,198
You're still a stunner.

331
00:29:48,908 --> 00:29:50,117
Thanks.

332
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,329
What are you doing here?

333
00:29:54,414 --> 00:29:56,707
Aren't you supposed to be
in Mexico somewhere?

334
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:59,626
Well, I'm playing with the Indians again.
Back in the bigs.

335
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:03,214
Well, that's great.
That's great, Jake. I'm happy for you.

336
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,885
Lynn, I don't think he's gonna buy
the phone bit now.

337
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:13,892
I... I gotta get back.

338
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:15,602
Wait a minute. I need your number.

339
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:17,854
I tried calling you at home,
but you're not listed.

340
00:30:17,938 --> 00:30:20,023
My life is different
from when you knew me, Jake.

341
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:22,066
Meaning what,
I don't know you anymore?

342
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:23,485
Couldn't we talk about this
some other time?

343
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,446
- I really gotta get back.
- Okay. Just give me the number.

344
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,948
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why? 'Cause of this guy you're with?

345
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,451
- What is he, an accountant?
- Attorney.

346
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:33,829
- Oh, worse.
- Please. He's watching us.

347
00:30:33,914 --> 00:30:36,957
I'm not leaving
till you give me your number.

348
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,463
All right. It's 555-1934.

349
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:44,256
Thank you.

350
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:46,343
Lynn.

351
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,513
I'm back. I'm gonna be around.

352
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,937
Relax, kid.
We got 162 of these games to go.

353
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:44,695
All right, everybody.

354
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:48,365
We got 10 minutes to game time.
Let's all gather round.

355
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,165
I'm not much
for giving inspirational addresses,

356
00:31:56,458 --> 00:32:00,712
but I'd just like to point out
that every newspaper in the country

357
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:03,214
has picked us to finish last.

358
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:08,469
The local press seems to think
we'd save everyone

359
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,847
a lot of time and trouble

360
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,767
if we just went out and shot ourselves.

361
00:32:14,185 --> 00:32:17,104
Me? I'm for wasting sportswriters' time.

362
00:32:17,355 --> 00:32:19,565
So, I'd like to hang around

363
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:23,610
and see if we can give 'em all
a nice big shit-burger to eat.

364
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:27,906
Shit-burger?

365
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:29,867
Hey, Lou.

366
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:34,079
Aren't we gonna have a prayer?

367
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:37,917
I mean, we're not all savages
like Cerrano over there.

368
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:42,505
You guys go ahead.

369
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,591
Oh, well, okay. Let's...

370
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:49,512
- Let's all bow our heads.
- Excuse me. I'll be in my office.

371
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:55,810
Dear Heavenly Father,
we humbly pray that you will guide...

372
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,899
Jesus Christ, Cerrano.

373
00:32:59,983 --> 00:33:01,776
Have to wake up bats.

374
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,862
Okay. Shit, can we try this again?

375
00:33:07,282 --> 00:33:12,286
Dear God, we humbly pray
that you will guide and protect us

376
00:33:12,371 --> 00:33:15,164
as we gird up our loins
to take the field of battle.

377
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:18,459
Lead us all into victory
in the name of Jesus...

378
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:21,213
Christ.

379
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:25,258
- Way to go, Cerrano.
- God damn it.

380
00:33:25,343 --> 00:33:27,469
- Jesus.
- Let's go. Go.

381
00:33:33,476 --> 00:33:34,518
Hello again, everybody.

382
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:37,646
Harry Doyle here, welcoming all you
friends of the feather

383
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:40,190
to another season of Indians baseball.

384
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:43,277
A lot of new faces in Chief Wahoo's
tribe this year

385
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:45,613
as they take on the defending
American League champs,

386
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:46,989
the New York Yankees.

387
00:33:47,074 --> 00:33:49,617
And hopefully, we'll have some
of the names that go with those faces

388
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:51,202
before their first at-bat.

389
00:33:51,286 --> 00:33:55,665
Anyway, listen to the roar of the crowd
as the Indians take the field.

390
00:34:03,757 --> 00:34:07,219
Yes, sir,
they love this club here in Cleveland.

391
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:10,389
Just a reminder, fans,
about Die Hard Night

392
00:34:10,473 --> 00:34:11,682
coming up here at the stadium.

393
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,518
Free admission to anyone
who was actually alive

394
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:17,521
the last time the Indians won a pennant.

395
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:22,818
Here's to the thrill of defeat, Charlie.

396
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,991
Keltner delivers. Here's a swing,
and a high fly ball to center field.

397
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,284
Hayes under it.

398
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,454
Hey. Makes a basket catch,
Willie Mays style.

399
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:34,247
And the side is retired.

400
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,959
All right. Way to look out there. Great.

401
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:41,379
Nice catch, Hayes.
Don't ever fucking do it again.

402
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:44,466
- All right. Let's go! Let's get it going!
- Let's go.

403
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:46,718
Bottom of the first,
and Willie Mays Hayes

404
00:34:46,802 --> 00:34:48,721
to lead it off for the wigwammers.

405
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:51,390
A lot of people say you can tell
how the season's gonna go

406
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:53,017
by the first hitter of the year.

407
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:55,394
Brewster into the wind,
and comes to the plate.

408
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:56,854
Oops!

409
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:58,689
Hey! Here's a hot shot toward the hole.

410
00:34:58,773 --> 00:35:02,610
Rudiya knocks it down, fires to first.
Late! Hayes beat it!

411
00:35:04,404 --> 00:35:08,324
Hey, give Rudiya credit
for sacrificing his body on that racket.

412
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:10,159
That guy's got a family to think about.

413
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:13,079
So, Hayes becomes
the first Indian in 15 years

414
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:14,581
to lead off the season with a hit.

415
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:16,875
Really knocked the crap out of that one.

416
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:19,169
Oh, I plan to get
at least a double out of this.

417
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:22,797
I bought 100 of these,
one for every base I'm gonna steal.

418
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:23,840
Shit.

419
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:27,010
Well, maybe things will turn around
a little for the Indians this year.

420
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:29,262
Now batting, number seven,
catcher Jake Taylor.

421
00:35:29,347 --> 00:35:32,599
Excuse me. Gotta take my first step
toward the Hall of Fame.

422
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:33,684
My ass.

423
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,895
We don't know where Hayes
played last year,

424
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:38,105
but I'm sure he did a hell of a job.

425
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,526
Brewster ready from the stretch.
Hayes with a good lead.

426
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,903
You look real sharp,
but it's hard to steal second base

427
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:45,821
with your shoe untied.

428
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:48,366
Quick move to first. He got him!

429
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,284
Hayes is picked off.

430
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:55,582
Well, so much for that.

431
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:58,794
Personally, I think we got hosed
on that call.

432
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:08,804
Nice going. Don't bounce the damn ball.

433
00:36:10,098 --> 00:36:11,974
Nice throw, dickhead.

434
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:15,352
Strike.

435
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:17,145
Son of a bitch!

436
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:18,856
Coming through! I...

437
00:36:18,941 --> 00:36:21,568
Oh, shit!

438
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:27,240
Top of the sixth, and rookie sensation
Ricky Vaughn on the pitch now.

439
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:31,077
You can close the book on Keltner.
Thank God.

440
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:32,745
Relax, rookie.
We're only four runs down.

441
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,913
We're still in this game.

442
00:36:33,998 --> 00:36:35,123
You take it to 'em.

443
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:36,416
- Let's go.
- All right.

444
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,002
Look, man, a guy gets to second,
first sign indicator.

445
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:41,672
Vaughn, a juvenile delinquent
in the off-season,

446
00:36:41,756 --> 00:36:43,257
in his major league debut.

447
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:45,843
I'm gonna light your ass up, meat.

448
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:51,265
Vaughn into the wind-up
in his first offering.

449
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,394
Just a bit outside.
He tried the corner and missed.

450
00:36:56,771 --> 00:36:59,023
Ball four. Ball eight.

451
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:03,069
Low, and Vaughn has walked
the bases loaded

452
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,654
on 12 straight pitches.

453
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,865
Boy, how can these guys
lay off pitches that close?

454
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:07,949
Fuck!

455
00:37:11,037 --> 00:37:13,830
Wild thing

456
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:16,082
You make my heart sing

457
00:37:17,877 --> 00:37:20,003
You walk everything

458
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:23,465
Taylor, what are you doing
back up here?

459
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:26,469
I couldn't cut it in the Mexican League.

460
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,971
How's your wife and my kids?

461
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:31,807
Vaughn in deep trouble here
with Clue Haywood,

462
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:35,311
last year's American League
home-run champ at the plate.

463
00:37:35,395 --> 00:37:37,146
Vaughn kicks, fires.

464
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,275
Here is a swing, and a drive
toward left field, and deep. Oh, boy.

465
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,028
No way. No way. Too high. Too high.

466
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:47,115
It is gone off the reservation.

467
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,910
A grand-slam home run for Haywood.

468
00:37:51,245 --> 00:37:52,329
Looked like a strike, anyway.

469
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:53,497
Where are you going?

470
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:55,165
"Too high"?
What does that mean, "too high"?

471
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:56,833
Too high, I thought.

472
00:37:56,918 --> 00:37:59,127
So, Vaughn is off to a rocky start,

473
00:37:59,212 --> 00:38:02,005
as Haywood clears the bases
with one swing.

474
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,840
Not "too high," "too hard," right?

475
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:06,927
- At first, it was really high.
- Who gives a shit? It's gone.

476
00:38:09,598 --> 00:38:12,892
- Want me to go get him?
- Nah. Let's see how he reacts.

477
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,561
Well, Brown, apparently,
is going to stay with Vaughn here,

478
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:18,439
as the Indians trail now,
eight to nothing.

479
00:38:18,565 --> 00:38:22,235
Coleman steps in. A.281 lifetime hitter.

480
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:25,905
Taylor with a sign,
Vaughn into his motion, and the pitch.

481
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:27,699
Uh-oh!

482
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:29,242
Interesting.

483
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:30,327
About time, it's eight-nothing.

484
00:38:30,412 --> 00:38:31,995
You! You're gone!

485
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:34,498
- What?
- You heard me, you're gone!

486
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:35,874
He was right on top of the plate.

487
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,085
Get him out of here!
He's horse shit.

488
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:40,421
I think you can go get him now.

489
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:42,798
The ball slipped out of my hand.
It was an accident.

490
00:38:42,882 --> 00:38:44,341
You threw at him intentionally.

491
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:46,593
- Kiss my ass.
- You're gone.

492
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:49,221
- You're full of shit! Fuck you!
- Get out of here, rookie!

493
00:38:49,305 --> 00:38:51,056
Why don't you blow me, ump?

494
00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:52,392
You're gone!

495
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:54,436
All right, Coleman, take it easy.
Accidents will happen.

496
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,354
You show a lot of heart
shaking it off like this.

497
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:57,772
Fuck you, Taylor.

498
00:38:57,857 --> 00:38:59,607
- He done hurt him, hurt himself!
- Come on!

499
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:01,693
Don't even think about it, Coleman.

500
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:04,612
The fucking wall, you pansy!

501
00:39:05,656 --> 00:39:06,656
Hard and high.

502
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:09,409
They succeeded at getting the object
that they were trying to establish.

503
00:39:09,493 --> 00:39:12,078
Because of the trajectory of the ball,
it looked way too high.

504
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:16,417
So, a tough start for the Erie warriors,

505
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:20,421
as they drop a heartbreaker
to the Yankees, nine to nothing.

506
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:23,048
Post-game show is brought to you by...

507
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,179
Christ, I can't find it. The hell with it.

508
00:39:30,223 --> 00:39:32,349
Hello. Cuyahoga Sheet Metal.

509
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:36,020
Yeah, you wouldn't happen to have
someone working there

510
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,273
named Lynn Westland, would you?

511
00:39:38,357 --> 00:39:40,275
Nah, nobody here by that name.

512
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,027
Didn't think so.

513
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,679
Jake, you shouldn't have come here.

514
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:10,473
I was wondering
why you'd give an old friend

515
00:40:10,557 --> 00:40:12,600
a bum phone number.

516
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:16,062
- Let's talk in my office, okay?
- I don't wanna talk in your office.

517
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:18,397
I told you, I don't think it's a good idea
that we see each other.

518
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:19,482
Why not?

519
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:20,733
Because we don't have
anything in common.

520
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,236
Sometimes I wonder if we ever did.

521
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,654
What are you talking about?

522
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:26,240
We were both athletes, world-class,
hot for each other.

523
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,658
What more could we have in common?

524
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:29,701
I stopped being an athlete
three years ago, Jake.

525
00:40:29,786 --> 00:40:31,662
Books are my life now.

526
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:35,040
Don't you dare laugh.
In two years, I put together

527
00:40:35,124 --> 00:40:37,376
one of the best special collection
departments in the country.

528
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,921
What is this? You're still sore
I never read Moby Dick?

529
00:40:41,256 --> 00:40:43,258
You never read anything I asked you to.

530
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:45,760
All right, I'll check it out now.
Is this the whale section?

531
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:47,762
I'll bet what's-his-name at the restaurant
read it.

532
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:49,389
Tom. His name's Tom,
and keep your voice down.

533
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:50,723
What do you see in this guy?

534
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:52,517
Well, he's stable, intelligent,

535
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:54,602
and I never found him in bed
with a stewardess.

536
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:56,229
That's because no stewardess
would have him.

537
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:58,356
Hey, wouldn't you rather be
with someone who's in demand?

538
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,191
Oh, God, you know, Jake,
it's just like always.

539
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:02,402
You don't take anything seriously.
Everything's a joke to you.

540
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:05,698
Oh, come on, man, for Christ's sake.
I'm just trying to loosen things up.

541
00:41:05,782 --> 00:41:07,950
I'm getting frostbite here.

542
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:11,453
Tom and I
are getting married in the fall.

543
00:41:12,122 --> 00:41:14,790
Oh, God, Lynn, that's crazy.
I had plans for us.

544
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:16,000
- Plans?
- Yeah.

545
00:41:16,126 --> 00:41:17,793
How can you say stuff like that?

546
00:41:17,878 --> 00:41:20,880
I haven't seen you in three years.
You never even wrote me a letter.

547
00:41:20,964 --> 00:41:22,047
Well, I'm sorry about that,

548
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:23,757
but I wasn't exactly proud
of my situation.

549
00:41:23,842 --> 00:41:25,593
Come on, you never thought
about me at all while I was gone?

550
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:27,219
Yeah, Jake, not so loud.

551
00:41:27,304 --> 00:41:29,431
What about the three nights we spent
on the beach in Veracruz?

552
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:30,891
You ever have nights like that
with Mr. Briefcase?

553
00:41:30,975 --> 00:41:33,435
What about the night you had in Detroit
with Miss Fuel Injection?

554
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:34,519
Well, what was I supposed to do?

555
00:41:34,645 --> 00:41:36,229
She bet me 50 bucks
she had a better body than you,

556
00:41:36,314 --> 00:41:37,355
and I had to defend your honor.

557
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,523
Oh, what a bunch of bullshit!

558
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:41,651
I have a much better body
than she does!

559
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,366
She's right.

560
00:41:50,537 --> 00:41:51,913
You haven't changed at all, have you?

561
00:41:51,997 --> 00:41:53,664
I'm afraid I have, or I wouldn't be here.

562
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:57,001
Come on, Lynn. Don't make me do time
for things that happened years ago.

563
00:41:57,085 --> 00:41:58,252
Jake, I'm sorry.

564
00:41:58,337 --> 00:42:01,839
You'll just always be the little boy
who wouldn't grow up.

565
00:42:01,924 --> 00:42:03,007
Lynn.

566
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:09,972
A quarter of the season's gone.
We're 15 and 24.

567
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:11,557
Seven games out of first.

568
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:13,185
That's bad. It's not bad enough.

569
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:16,480
Plus, this team is showing
signs of improvement.

570
00:42:16,648 --> 00:42:18,941
I didn't think we'd win
15 games all year.

571
00:42:19,025 --> 00:42:21,485
- Any ideas?
- On how we can get worse?

572
00:42:22,862 --> 00:42:25,113
How about a series of fines
for good play?

573
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:29,117
Maybe a $30,000 bonus for the guy
voted least valuable player.

574
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:33,497
Maybe the problem is

575
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:37,293
we're coddling these guys too much.

576
00:42:38,212 --> 00:42:39,295
Yeah.

577
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:48,554
What's with this?
We never leave from down here.

578
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,932
Maybe the Jetway isn't working.

579
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,936
Hey, this is good. This is real good.

580
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,438
A 757 to Milwaukee?

581
00:42:56,523 --> 00:43:00,359
No, that's not your plane.
Yours is this one rolling in.

582
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:18,920
Oh, sure, now you come around.

583
00:43:19,255 --> 00:43:20,422
He's not fooled.

584
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:25,677
So, the sons of Geronimo,
still suffering from propeller-lag,

585
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:28,596
are nipped by the Brewers tonight,
seven to nothing.

586
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:31,057
The only excitement for the tribe
provided by Rick Vaughn,

587
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:32,892
who set an American League record

588
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,228
by throwing four wild pitches
in one inning.

589
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,105
Hey, congratulations, Rick.

590
00:43:37,189 --> 00:43:40,400
Excuse me, Mr. Vaughn?
Can I have your autograph?

591
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,986
Yeah, sure.

592
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:44,697
My first autograph.

593
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:46,699
Couldn't give these away
a couple of weeks ago.

594
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:50,661
I saw your record on the news.
You made their Hall of Shame.

595
00:43:50,746 --> 00:43:52,371
Congratulations.

596
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:54,915
- Thanks.
- Hey, thank you.

597
00:43:56,752 --> 00:43:58,544
Nice hair.

598
00:43:58,754 --> 00:44:01,130
Well, you're a celebrity now, Vaughn.

599
00:44:01,214 --> 00:44:03,717
Thought you had to do something good
to be a celebrity.

600
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:05,260
Not if you do it colorfully.

601
00:44:08,723 --> 00:44:12,059
Call the stewardess, Vaughn.
I need one of those bags.

602
00:44:12,143 --> 00:44:14,644
There aren't any stewardesses.

603
00:44:14,937 --> 00:44:17,397
I wonder if there are any pilots.

604
00:44:20,568 --> 00:44:22,819
So, the tribe drops
its third straight on this trip.

605
00:44:22,904 --> 00:44:24,613
Six to one to the Rangers.

606
00:44:24,697 --> 00:44:27,992
For the Indians, one run on,
let's see, one hit.

607
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,828
That's all we got, one goddamn hit?

608
00:44:31,622 --> 00:44:33,331
You can't say "goddamn" on the air.

609
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:35,917
Don't worry, nobody's listening anyway.

610
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:38,795
Hey, Mort, what is Comtec at?

611
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:42,215
Buy it when it hits 34.

612
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:44,801
What?

613
00:44:44,885 --> 00:44:46,844
Moby Dick? What you reading that for?

614
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:52,518
This happens to be a masterpiece
of American literature, that's why.

615
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,144
Lynn turned you on to that?

616
00:44:54,229 --> 00:44:56,355
Yeah, a long time ago.

617
00:44:56,439 --> 00:44:57,773
Well, look, if we ever get out of here,

618
00:44:57,857 --> 00:45:00,150
me and the guys, we're gonna
go to a club later on tonight.

619
00:45:00,235 --> 00:45:01,860
Wanna come along?

620
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,696
Well, I... I got some reading to do.

621
00:45:04,781 --> 00:45:06,198
What, you got a test or something?

622
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:08,325
Hey, Jake, man, why don't you
just go over there and see her?

623
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:10,370
I mean, maybe she'll let you slide
on a couple of these.

624
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:12,747
Well, I would, if I knew where she lived.

625
00:45:12,832 --> 00:45:15,917
That's easy.
Just tail her home from the library.

626
00:45:16,085 --> 00:45:19,420
What, do you mean sit in the car
and wait for her to come out?

627
00:45:19,505 --> 00:45:22,340
- That's kinda juvenile, don't you think?
- Yeah.

628
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,732
Jake, this isn't my place.

629
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,361
- Who is this, love?
- Whose is it?

630
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:03,988
Oh, Mr. Taylor, right?

631
00:47:05,074 --> 00:47:07,075
I remember you from the restaurant.

632
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:09,410
Lynn's told me a lot about you.

633
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:12,664
Why don't you come in for a while?

634
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:14,874
Oh, no.
I really ought to be running along.

635
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:17,752
- Yeah, he's gotta get going.
- Yeah.

636
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:20,255
Really. Come on in for a drink.

637
00:47:20,506 --> 00:47:21,673
Well...

638
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:26,428
Excuse me, everybody.
This is Jake Taylor.

639
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:29,098
Jake, Arthur and Claire Holloway.

640
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:30,349
- How do you do?
- Hi.

641
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:32,768
- Hello.
- Brent and Janice Bowden.

642
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:34,353
- How do you do?
- Hi. How are you?

643
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:35,688
Hi.

644
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:38,274
Jake is a professional baseball player.

645
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,525
Really?

646
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:43,195
Jake, what brings you here
this evening?

647
00:47:44,365 --> 00:47:47,117
Well, I wanted to discuss
a couple of books with Lynn,

648
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,828
and I thought this was her place.

649
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:52,956
Well, it soon will be.

650
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:58,211
Yeah, I heard you were engaged.
Congratulations.

651
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:04,009
Thank you.

652
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:07,805
- What can I get you to drink?
- Beer will be fine.

653
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:09,640
Great. Have a seat.

654
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:24,697
- That's great.
- Yeah.

655
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:26,240
- No, thanks.
- Sir.

656
00:48:27,784 --> 00:48:28,785
No.

657
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,838
Well, what team do you play for, Jake?

658
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:41,381
The Indians.

659
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:43,300
Here in Cleveland?

660
00:48:43,593 --> 00:48:45,927
I didn't know they still had a team.

661
00:48:46,012 --> 00:48:49,389
Yeah. We got uniforms and everything.
It's really great.

662
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,229
They're in last right now,
but hopefully moving up, eh, Jake?

663
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:03,237
I've heard baseball players make
very good salaries these days.

664
00:49:04,198 --> 00:49:07,367
Well, that depends on
how good they are, I guess.

665
00:49:07,618 --> 00:49:09,243
How good are you?

666
00:49:10,954 --> 00:49:12,956
I make the league minimum.

667
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:19,630
He was one of the best in baseball
before he had problems with his knees.

668
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:28,097
Well, Jake, what are you gonna do
when your career's over?

669
00:49:28,556 --> 00:49:31,850
I mean, you can't play baseball forever,
can you?

670
00:49:32,644 --> 00:49:34,728
Something will come up.

671
00:49:35,356 --> 00:49:37,148
Will it?

672
00:49:39,485 --> 00:49:41,820
Well, I thought I'd go to Hawaii,

673
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,198
have a couple of kids who grow up
to be Olympic champions.

674
00:49:46,158 --> 00:49:48,827
Really? In what event?

675
00:49:49,328 --> 00:49:50,495
Swimming.

676
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:53,873
The 200-meter individual medley.

677
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,418
I figure it ought to be real big by then.

678
00:49:56,502 --> 00:49:57,920
You got the girl picked out?

679
00:49:58,004 --> 00:50:01,507
I did, but I wasn't smart enough
to hold on to her.

680
00:50:04,928 --> 00:50:07,138
You used to be an athlete,
didn't you, Lynn?

681
00:50:07,222 --> 00:50:08,556
Yeah.

682
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,975
What did you do?

683
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:15,062
200-meter individual medley.

684
00:50:21,529 --> 00:50:24,156
Alternate on the '80 Olympic team.

685
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:27,701
Oh, really? Well...

686
00:50:31,706 --> 00:50:33,498
Well, I better get going.

687
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,125
Oh, let me walk you out.

688
00:50:35,209 --> 00:50:37,711
- Nice meeting all of you.
- Yeah.

689
00:50:40,798 --> 00:50:43,217
- Thanks for the beer.
- Don't mention it.

690
00:50:43,302 --> 00:50:46,137
I'll let you know if I land a job.
I know you're very concerned.

691
00:50:46,263 --> 00:50:48,514
Yeah, well, I

692
00:50:49,308 --> 00:50:53,102
just wanted Lynn to know
what she would have had ahead of her.

693
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:56,355
- Stay away from her.
- Suck my dick.

694
00:51:07,577 --> 00:51:10,120
- Pepper says you wanted to see me.
- Yeah, Rick.

695
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:12,414
Come on in. Have a seat.

696
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:20,964
Rick, I'm not gonna
beat around the bush here.

697
00:51:21,049 --> 00:51:24,343
You've got a great arm.
It's one of the best I've ever seen,

698
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:28,056
but your control hasn't come around
like we'd hoped it would.

699
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:30,391
Now, a lot of pitchers started off wild,

700
00:51:30,476 --> 00:51:33,102
and after they worked it out
in the minors for a while,

701
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:35,188
they went on to great careers.

702
00:51:35,272 --> 00:51:36,898
Take Ryan there.

703
00:51:43,906 --> 00:51:46,699
- What about him?
- Never mind Ryan.

704
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:56,961
Read these letters for me.

705
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,967
You can't read them, can you?

706
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:11,226
Yo, man, they look nice.
I had a pair just like 'em.

707
00:52:12,311 --> 00:52:15,564
Well, after the game, I'm gonna
pick out a pair that's more me.

708
00:52:15,648 --> 00:52:17,232
- Good luck.
- They look good.

709
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:20,360
Besides, seeing's
the most important thing, son.

710
00:52:20,653 --> 00:52:23,029
I don't think it's that important.

711
00:52:26,158 --> 00:52:27,367
Fuck.

712
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:30,579
All right, let's hit the field.

713
00:53:00,695 --> 00:53:02,613
Up your butt, Jobu.

714
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,215
Yo, bartender! Jobu needs a refill!

715
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:24,010
- Head's up!
- Yo, watch it!

716
00:53:24,094 --> 00:53:25,637
Hustle! Let's go!

717
00:53:25,721 --> 00:53:27,347
- God damn!
- Shit.

718
00:53:30,601 --> 00:53:32,810
We're in the ninth.

719
00:53:33,729 --> 00:53:35,021
Two down, a man on first,

720
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:37,649
and the Indians clinging to
a one-run lead.

721
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:40,027
Ricky Vaughn,
the kid they call "Wild Thing,"

722
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:43,280
one out away
from his first major league victory.

723
00:53:44,074 --> 00:53:46,158
Vaughn's been looking good
out there today.

724
00:53:46,242 --> 00:53:48,452
Don't worry, he'll blow it.

725
00:53:48,536 --> 00:53:51,372
Vaughn's showing some signs
of fatigue out there.

726
00:53:51,456 --> 00:53:54,500
He seems to have lost some zip
on his fastball.

727
00:53:54,584 --> 00:53:56,543
Slow curve. Here's a swing,
and a bouncing ball.

728
00:53:56,628 --> 00:53:59,421
Dorn has a chance to make the play.
He can't get it.

729
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:02,759
Clark digging around second.
He'll make it to third easily.

730
00:54:02,843 --> 00:54:05,970
And the A's have runners at the corners.

731
00:54:06,263 --> 00:54:08,932
Dorn didn't get much of a jump
on that ball, Monte.

732
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:12,644
But let's give him credit,
at least he didn't spike himself.

733
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:15,605
You want me to get him
out of there, Lou?

734
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:16,731
No.

735
00:54:16,816 --> 00:54:19,359
He's come this far,
let's see if he can finish it.

736
00:54:19,443 --> 00:54:21,528
Come on, we need some defense here!

737
00:54:21,612 --> 00:54:23,823
Johnny, maybe we ought to do
one of those waves.

738
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:26,867
So, Vaughn in a little trouble here.

739
00:54:26,952 --> 00:54:28,869
But I'll tell you,
these Cleveland fans are great.

740
00:54:28,954 --> 00:54:31,122
Listen to them get behind Vaughn.

741
00:54:31,206 --> 00:54:33,874
- Hey, way to go, Rick!
- Go, Rick!

742
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:37,044
Come on, baby. Come on, Ricky.
Come on, Ricky.

743
00:54:38,296 --> 00:54:41,424
Okay, Ricky, there's two outs,
so forget about the runners.

744
00:54:41,508 --> 00:54:44,802
Get this guy at the plate.
Come on, Rick. Get tough.

745
00:54:45,596 --> 00:54:46,596
This guy's a first-ball hitter.

746
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:48,598
You gotta come up
with something nasty.

747
00:54:48,683 --> 00:54:50,517
Fucking Dorn.
This game should be over by now.

748
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:53,061
He could have had that ball.
He tanked it on purpose.

749
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:55,522
This isn't the California Penal League,
Vaughn.

750
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:56,940
We're professionals here.

751
00:54:57,024 --> 00:54:58,483
We don't tank plays
for personal reasons,

752
00:54:58,568 --> 00:55:00,318
so cut the crybaby shit.

753
00:55:00,403 --> 00:55:03,113
Now, you pitched a hell of a game.
You want to finish it, don't you?

754
00:55:03,197 --> 00:55:04,990
- Yeah.
- All right.

755
00:55:05,408 --> 00:55:07,451
You think you can throw
a strike on this pitch?

756
00:55:07,536 --> 00:55:10,079
There's not gonna be much on it.
My arm feels like Jell-O right now.

757
00:55:10,164 --> 00:55:12,874
Just get it over the plate.
I want him to swing.

758
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:15,752
Last time I did that,
the guy hit one that hasn't landed yet.

759
00:55:15,836 --> 00:55:17,253
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

760
00:55:17,337 --> 00:55:20,047
Number 27, right fielder Mike Rexman.

761
00:55:20,132 --> 00:55:21,340
Hi, Rexman.

762
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:23,551
Hell of a situation we got here.
Two on, two out,

763
00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:25,845
you guys trailing by one in the ninth.

764
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:27,930
You got a chance to be a hero
on national television.

765
00:55:28,015 --> 00:55:29,515
If you don't blow it.

766
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,769
By the way, I saw your wife
at the Capri Lounge last night.

767
00:55:31,853 --> 00:55:33,937
Hell of a dancer.
You must be very, very proud.

768
00:55:34,022 --> 00:55:35,105
That guy she was with,

769
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,899
I mean, I'm sure
he's a close personal friend and all,

770
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:38,108
but tell me, what was he doing

771
00:55:38,193 --> 00:55:40,444
wearing her panties on his head?

772
00:55:40,695 --> 00:55:42,154
Swung on and popped up.

773
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:46,033
Uh-oh, Rexie,
I don't think this one's got the distance.

774
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,162
Taylor under it.
He's got it, and this ball game is over...

775
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:51,288
Shit.

776
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:53,208
...as the Indians hold out
for a 3-2 victory.

777
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:54,501
Yeah.

778
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:56,795
Starting to come together, Pepper.
Starting to come together.

779
00:55:56,879 --> 00:55:57,879
Yeah.

780
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:04,594
Knock it off, Charlie.
