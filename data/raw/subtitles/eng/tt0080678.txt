1
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,586

No Entry

2
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,292

The fruit of Original Sin

3
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:16,066

Away with it!
- Don't be difficult!

4
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,778

Let's take
our lovely children on an outing!

5
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,209

You can't do this. I know my rights.

6
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,128

I have the authority
to close you down.

7
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,424

This exhibit degrades those who see it
and the poor creature himself.

8
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,470

He is a freak. How else will he live?

9
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,431

This is entirely different!

10
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,810

This is montrous
and should not be allowed!

11
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:57,023

These officers will see
that you are on your way. Good day!

12
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,777

Move along please!

13
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,033

Hold it there, sir. Come this way.

14
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,214

On the move again...

15
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,679

My treasure.

16
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:10,138

We're seeing a lot more
of these machine accidents.

17
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,730

Abominable things these machines.
You can't reason with them.

18
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,066

What a mess.

19
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,113

Pull on the rope!

20
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,242

Irons, please!

21
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,466

Who is it?

22
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,012

Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

23
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,974

I found it.
- Good. Did you see it?

24
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,728

No.
- Alright.

25
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,564

I'll see you in a moment. Thank you.

26
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,445

Who's that?
- A friend of mine.

27
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,739

Oh yes?

28
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,118

What are you up to?
- Nothing.

29
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,744

Oh, come on!

30
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,207

Nothing of any importance.

31
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,929

Where's Green Street, please?

32
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:20,143

Second on the left, then right.
- Thanks.

33
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,892

Are you the proprietor?
- And who might you be, sir?

34
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,896

Just one of the curious.
I'd like to see it.

35
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,693

I don't think so, we're...

36
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:59,200

closed!
- I'd pay handsomely for a showing.

37
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,579

Are you the proprietor?
- Handsomely?. Who sent you?

38
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,248

I beg your pardon?
- Never mind.

39
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,255

I'm the owner.

40
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:34,921

Life...

41
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,969

is full of surprises.

42
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,600

Consider the fate

43
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,562

of this creature's poor mother,

44
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,315

struck down...

45
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:01,906

in the fourth month
of her condition by wild elephants.

46
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,909

Struck down...

47
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:09,706

on an uncharted African isle.

48
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,459

The result...

49
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,629

is plain to see.

50
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,592

Ladies and Gentlemen,

51
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,928

the terrible...

52
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,184

Elephant Man!

53
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,825

Stand up!
- Stand up!

54
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,044

Turn around!
- Turn around!

55
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:43,174

You'll bring him to me
tomorrow, ten o'clock, Mr....?

56
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,302

Bytes. He'll be there.

57
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,521

Here is my card. I'll send a cab.

58
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,649

We have a deal.

59
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,654

We understand each other,

60
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,199

more than money has changed hands.

61
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,911

We understand each other
completely, my friend.

62
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,873

Yes. Thank you, Mr. Bytes.

63
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,706

Cor, what a stink!

64
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,126

I'm looking for Mr. Frederick Treves.

65
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,212

Please, ma'am.

66
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,217

I'll send for him. Nurse!

67
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,595

Mr. Treves, this...

68
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,264

Yes.
- Says, that...

69
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,767

Yes, I was expecting him.

70
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,271

Are you the cab driver? - Yes.
- Anyone else with you?

71
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,318

No, just this gentleman.
- Thank you for your troubles.

72
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:29,030

Not at all. My pleasure.
- Thank you.

73
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,575

This way, please?

74
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,873

I'll be in my room
and I'm not to be disturbed.

75
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,376

Of course, sir.

76
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,256

Will you come with me?

77
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,136

You heard the doctor?

78
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,685

Go on!

79
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:42,354

My name is Frederick Treves and I'm
the surgeon at the London Hospital.

80
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,813

And...

81
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:49,819

I lecture in anatomy
at the medical college.

82
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,739

Sorry.

83
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,035

I'd like very much to examine you.

84
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,332

Would that be alright?

85
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,251

Please.

86
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,258

I'd like to ask you a few questions.

87
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,720

Would that be alright?

88
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:21,101

Your owner...The man,
who looks after you, tells me that...

89
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,271

you're English
and that your name is John Merrick.

90
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,817

John Merrick, is that right?

91
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,533

I tell you what,
I think I'll ask you a question

92
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,496

and you shake you head for 'no'.

93
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,209

Have you always been this way?

94
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,130

Are you in any pain?

95
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,385

Are your parents still alive?

96
00:18:56,094 --> 00:19:01,266

Do you understand me? Your father,
your mother, are they dead?

97
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,561

Freddie, what are you doing...?

98
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,440

Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea...

99
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:15,113

What have you got there?
- You'll find out at the meeting.

100
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,116

Until then, not a word to anyone.

101
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,494

Alright.
You must have quite a find in there.

102
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:25,749

I don't know.
- "Nothing of any importance", eh?

103
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,961

Not a word, please, Fox.

104
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,008

Alright.

105
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,894

I think I'll examine you now.

106
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:32,065

I'll leave the questions till later.

107
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,861

Will you take your hat off?

108
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,158

Don't be frightened.
I simply want to look at you.

109
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,247

Take your hat off.
Don't be frightened.

110
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,469

Thank you. Good afternoon.

111
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,806

Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers!

112
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,148

Pull the curtains aside!

113
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,617

He's English. He is 21 years of age.

114
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,954

His name is John Merrick.

115
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:32,584

In the course
of my profession I have come upon

116
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,796

many deformities of the face
due to injury or disease

117
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:41,885

as well as mutilations and contortions
of the body from like causes.

118
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:47,098

I have never seen such a perverted,
degraded version of a human being.

119
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:51,186

I wish to draw your attention to
his insidious conditions.

120
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,271

Can you see over there?

121
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,400

Note, if you will,
the extreme enlargement of the skull

122
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,653

and the limb, which is useless,

123
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,783

the alarming curvature of the spine.
Would you turn round, please?

124
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,743

Turn round, please!

125
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,539

The looseness of the skin

126
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:16,461

and the fibrous tumours
that cover 90% of the body.

127
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,049

There is every indication that these
afflictions have existed and have

128
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,260

progressed rapidly since birth.

129
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,930

He suffers from chronic bronchitis.

130
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:31,059

Interesting side note:
Despite these anomalies

131
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:36,314

the patient's genitals
remain entirely intact and unaffected.

132
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,650

Thank you.

133
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,406

And his left arm
is perfectly normal, as you see.

134
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:47,826

So gentlemen,

135
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,371

owing to the
congenital extostoses of the skull,

136
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,291

extensive papillomatous growths,
pendulous masses of skin,

137
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,753

the enlargement of
the right limb and all the bones,

138
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,048

the distortion of the head
and the extensive area

139
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:05,135

covered by papillomatous growth,

140
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,097

The patient
has been called the "Elephant Man".

141
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:10,974

Thank you.

142
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,629

You haven't
mentioned his mental state.

143
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,217

He's an imbecile, probably from birth.
A complete idiot.

144
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,096

Pray to God he is.

145
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,068

Where have you been?

146
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:34,599

Out!

147
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,396

How can I eat with a noise like that?

148
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,949

Bytes, don't!

149
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,870

Where were you? What did you do?

150
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,920

Our man is sick. Come right away!
- What is it?

151
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,672

Like this...

152
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:12,262

What did you do with him?
He's been like this all night!

153
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,891

He was fine when he left here.
Now look at him!

154
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,227

Yes, I intend to.

155
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:24,482

What happened?
- He had a fall. He falls.

156
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:36,286

Looks like a very severe fall.

157
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,039

He's a...

158
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:40,999

... clumsy soul.

159
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,753

Never looks where he's going.
But that's alright.

160
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,380

He has me to take care of him.

161
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,759

Why is he sitting up? He needs rest!

162
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,720

That's how he sleeps.

163
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,432

If he lies down, he'll kill himself.

164
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,102

His head's too big.

165
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,022

This man belongs in the hospital.

166
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:10,487

Can't you treat him here?
Listen, he's my livelihood.

167
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:14,074

We're business partners, he and l.

168
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:20,663

He's the greatest freak in the world!
- Now, you listen,

169
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,251

you're not going to have a livelihood
if he dies. Go and fetch a cab!

170
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,130

I truly appreciate this, my friend.

171
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,257

Listen,

172
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,843

there's much I can do for you.

173
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:39,933

I move in the proper circles.

174
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:45,230

In fact, anything at all,
if you take my meaning.

175
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:51,319

Everything will be taken care of.
- Good to do business with you.

176
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:39,427

Can I have a bowl of oatmeal?

177
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:45,850

Breakfasting with the patients?
- It's for a patient.

178
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:47,769

There you are.

179
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,398

Thank you. Good morning.
- Morning.

180
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,072

Come here a moment!

181
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,750

What's that you've got there?

182
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:15,547

Good Heavens! You haven't acquired
a taste for this stuff?

183
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,800

Yes, it's quite nutricious.
- Possibly.

184
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,679

Not quite the diet for
a grown man. Nurse!

185
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:28,935

Just take this to the patient
in the isolation ward, will you?

186
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,646

Yes, sir.

187
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,568

Don't be frightened.
He won't hurt you.

188
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:42,157

Won't he indeed. Just a moment!
There's something I want to say.

189
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,747

A hospital's no place for secrecy.

190
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:53,168

Doctors spiriting hooded figures
around cause comment.

191
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:57,380

Why wasn't he properly admitted?
Why the isolation ward?

192
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,843

He's not contagious, is he?
- No, he's got chronic bronchitis,

193
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:05,305

and he's been beaten.
- Why not the General Ward then?

194
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:09,309

He's seriously deformed.

195
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,395

I fear it could shock the patients.

196
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:18,443

Deformed, is that it?
ls he ultimately incurable?

197
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,779

Yes, sir.
- But you must be aware,

198
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,616

that this hospital
doesn't accept incurables.

199
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:29,913

I'm aware of that.
But this case is quite exceptional.

200
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,062

I quite appreciate your problem.

201
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:58,608

Why not contact
the Royal Hospital for lncurables?

202
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:03,488

Perhaps they might find him a place.
- Yes. Would you like to meet him?

203
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:21,756

Excuse me!

204
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,010

The Elephant Man.

205
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,767

Sorry.

206
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,228

Sorry.

207
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,901

I should have warned you.

208
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:45,947

Please forgive me. You alright?

209
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,078

Please send Mrs. Mothershead up here.

210
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:55,957

Tell her to knock and wait for me.

211
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,637

I'm sorry about that.

212
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:15,518

We'll bring you another breakfast.
You must be very hungry.

213
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,067

You'll be comfortable here.
I'll see you get everything you need.

214
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:45,520

Blimey!

215
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:54,904

So, this is the Elephant Man.

216
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:59,325

I ain't seen nothing like you before.

217
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,413

What the hell happened to you?

218
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,753

Dumb, eh?

219
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:14,049

I like people that can keep quiet.

220
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,679

Here, have a drink!

221
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,518

Go on! No?

222
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,609

You should be more sociable.

223
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,112

Get yourself disliked.

224
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:47,707

We're going to be good friends and my
friends will want to meet you.

225
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:52,545

And they will, believe me.

226
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:07,268

I've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?

227
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:09,938

Come up on the bed.

228
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,481

Come on!

229
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:50,520

All he understands is a good smack.
- He's had his share of smacks.

230
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:55,692

That drives him under the bed.
Treat him with kindness and patience.

231
00:37:56,151 --> 00:38:00,697

Perhaps you've
got time for that sort of treatment.

232
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:05,160

I've got a hospital to run.
Don't you waste your time, with him.

233
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:09,497

It's like talking to a brick wall.

234
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:12,709

I don't mean to be harsh,

235
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:17,005

but he doesn't belong here.

236
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:23,553

Honestly, sir,
what can you do for him?

237
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:39,235

By the way, Mr. Carr-Gomm said

238
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:42,197

he'd like to see you
when you can spare a moment.

239
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:43,782

Yes.
- Thank you.

240
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:53,041

I can't help you, unless you help me.

241
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:05,053

I believe there's something
you want to say to me.

242
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,806

Something back there.

243
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:11,309

I can't help you, unless you help me!

244
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:17,190

I believe you want to say something.

245
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,736

I've got to understand
what you're feeling and thinking.

246
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,490

Do you understand me?

247
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:32,163

Just nod your head.
Can you understand me?

248
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:35,291

Nod your head if you understand me.

249
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,548

Alright.

250
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,593

You do understand.

251
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:50,181

I want to hear you talk.
You are not a wall.

252
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,977

Do you understand?
I want you to talk to me.

253
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:56,980

Now. I want to hear you say it.

254
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,361

I want to hear how you say things.
I'm not going to hurt you.

255
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,113

Got to hear!

256
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:09,701

Very slowly, I want you to say "yes".

257
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:12,328

Say "yes".

258
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,293

Yes.

259
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,755

Yes!

260
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:24,549

Alright.

261
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,761

Now just once more: "yes".

262
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,769

I can understand that. That's good!

263
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,564

That's very good. Alright now

264
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:44,944

I'm going to say some words to you
and you repeat them. Understand?

265
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:49,616

Say "Hello, my name is..."

266
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,121

Hello.

267
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:59,334

My name is...

268
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:01,836

John Merrick.

269
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,090

John Merrick.

270
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:10,637

John, that's very good.
Say "John Merrick".

271
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:14,683

Merrick.

272
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:19,270

"Hello, my name is John Merrick".

273
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:24,526

Hello, my name is...

274
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:28,488

... is John Merrick.

275
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,281

You can speak!

276
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:41,459

How did you get up here?

277
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,713

I want my man back.
- Just a moment.

278
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:47,716

Never mind. I want my man.

279
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:53,138

He's still very sick.
Come downstairs and I'll explain.

280
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:54,597

No!

281
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,435

Don't.

282
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:03,732

You've had plenty of time to cure him.

283
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:07,277

And now he's leaving with me.

284
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:10,447

Do you understand me?

285
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:12,824

Now, Mr. Treves.

286
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:16,453

We made a deal.
- You misunderstood.

287
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:21,207

This man has suffered a severe fall.
If you take my meaning.

288
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:25,170

He is my patient now.
- Pull the other one!

289
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:30,091

I'm sorry. But all you do is profit
from another man's misery.

290
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,847

Do you think you are better than me?
- No.

291
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,808

You wanted the freak

292
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,021

to show your doctor chums,
make a name for yourself.

293
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,107

You, my friend...

294
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:51,321

I gave you the freak... on trust.

295
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:54,657

In the name of science.

296
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:59,412

And now I want him back!
- You do not own this man. Stop it!

297
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:02,749

I want him back!
- So you can beat him?

298
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:06,586

So you can starve him?
A dog in the street would fare better.

299
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:09,964

I'll go to the authorities.
- Go to them, then!

300
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:11,966

By all means.

301
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:15,762

They'll be interested
to hear your story and ours.

302
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:20,517

Now, I think

303
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:23,645

we really understand one another.

304
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,316

Alright.

305
00:43:31,194 --> 00:43:32,779

Alright.

306
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:47,085

A singularly unattractive character!

307
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,716

It seems to me I might
as well meet this patient of yours.

308
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:55,969

Thank you very much.

309
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:01,182

Shall we say in a few days?

310
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:03,518

Two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?

311
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,442

Whatever's most convenient, sir.

312
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:12,902

Two o'clock then, tomorrow.

313
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:14,738

Thank you very much.

314
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:20,869

Two o'clock...

315
00:44:24,664 --> 00:44:27,667

Morning, Mr Treves. Early again!
- Yes.

316
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:31,129

You'd have made a good milkman!

317
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:34,549

I'll keep that in mind.
- Okay, sir.

318
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,894

"He restoreth my soul.

319
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:50,982

He leadeth me into paths of...
righteousness for his name's sake."

320
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:53,318

"Righteousness!"

321
00:44:56,154 --> 00:45:01,034

"He leadeth me into the paths of

322
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:03,453

righteousness for his name's sake."

323
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,622

Good. It's very good.

324
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:10,919

When your visitor comes today,
I want you to say it exactly the same.

325
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:15,799

When I introduce him to you,
just say the words you've learnt.

326
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:19,636

If you have trouble with the words,
I'll help you, nothing to worry about.

327
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:24,599

I'll introduce you to him and say:
"Please meet Mr. Carr-Gomm."

328
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:26,685

And will you say:

329
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:31,815

Hello, my name is John Merrick.

330
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:35,026

I'm very pleased to meet you.

331
00:45:36,152 --> 00:45:38,154

Good. Good.

332
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,865

I'll go and get Mr. Carr-Gomm.

333
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:50,625

It is only a physical problem.

334
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:55,714

He has trouble with certain sounds
because of the constrictive deformity.

335
00:45:56,172 --> 00:46:00,176

But he can talk.
- Is he able to understand?

336
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:03,972

Yes. Oh, yes.

337
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:10,687

Except he's so anxious to make a good
impression, that he might be nervous.

338
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:29,664

Come in!

339
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:49,851

May I introduce you to Mr. Carr-Gomm?

340
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,730

This is John Merrick.
- Hello.

341
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:57,984

My name is John Merrick.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

342
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:00,528

I'm very pleased to meet you.

343
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:07,869

How are you feeling today?
- I feel much better.

344
00:47:09,287 --> 00:47:11,998

Are you comfortable here?

345
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:17,212

Everybody's very kind.

346
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:20,340

How is your bronchitis?

347
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:34,938

Mr. Merrick likes
the food here, don't you?

348
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:44,531

Much better than what I'm used to.
- Oh yes?

349
00:47:45,865 --> 00:47:47,909

And what was that?

350
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:52,163

Potatoes.

351
00:47:53,915 --> 00:47:56,001

You were flogged?

352
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:02,340

I feel much better now.

353
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:06,636

Splendid.
How do you find Mr. Treves

354
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:10,515

as a teacher, I mean?

355
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:20,817

Very kind.

356
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:26,614

How long did you and Mr. Treves
prepare for this interview?

357
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:36,458

Very kind.

358
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:42,130

I understand.
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

359
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:43,757

Good day.

360
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:57,312

It was very good, John.

361
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:00,357

I'll be back in a moment.

362
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:06,696

"The Lord is my shepherd,

363
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:10,867

I shall not want.

364
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:13,286

He maketh me lie down..."

365
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:17,749

A brave attempt but he simply
mouthed words taught by you.

366
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:21,586

I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

367
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:24,881

"He retoreth my soul."

368
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,969

He simply doesn't belong here.
He should be constantly looked after.

369
00:49:30,428 --> 00:49:33,098

I'm sorry, things have
turned out this way. Good day.

370
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:34,557

Yes.

371
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:41,398

"Though I walked through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no

372
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:46,611

evil, for Thou art with me,
Thy rod and Thy staff..."

373
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,780

Mr. Carr-Gomm!

374
00:49:50,615 --> 00:49:52,158

What is it?

375
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,453

It's that!

376
00:49:57,706 --> 00:50:00,208

I didn't teach him that part!

377
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:07,632

"Goodness and mercy
will follow me all the days of my life

378
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:13,555

and I shall dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

379
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:21,271

How did you know the rest of it?
- Very strange.

380
00:50:23,773 --> 00:50:26,985

How did you know
the rest of the 23rd Psalm?

381
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:36,244

I used to read the Bible every day.

382
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:43,460

I know it very well
and the Book of Common Prayer.

383
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:48,965

The 23rd Psalm's beautiful.
It's my favourite.

384
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:54,179

Come and see me in my office
when you're through.

385
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:57,223

There's something
important I want to say.

386
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:01,936

Goodbye.
I do hope we shall meet again.

387
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:15,742

Why didn't you tell me you can read?

388
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:18,411

I was frightened.

389
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:25,877

I see.
- I was afraid to talk.

390
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:31,925

Please forgive me.

391
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:47,107

Can you imagine the life he must
have had? - Yes, I think I can.

392
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:52,862

I don't believe so.
I don't believe any of us can.

393
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:09,546

Terrible though his appearance is,
so terrible, that nervous persons

394
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:13,174

fly in horror from the sight of him,

395
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:18,763

and that he is debarred from
earning his livelihood in any way.

396
00:52:19,222 --> 00:52:23,184

Yet he is superior in intelligence.
He can read and write,

397
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:28,982

is quiet, gentle,
not to say even refined.

398
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:40,785

I should like to meet this gentleman.

399
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:09,439

Have you seen this?
- No.

400
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:19,866

Listen to this!
- Hey up, hey up!

401
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,701

Hey up!

402
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:27,624

Listen! This is a letter

403
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:32,253

to the London Times
from the governor of the hospital.

404
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:37,717

In a little room in one of attic wards
is a man named John Merrick,

405
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:44,474

so dreadful a sight, that he is
unable even to come out by day.

406
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,771

He's been called the "Elephant Man"
on account of his terrible deformity.

407
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:54,818

His appearance is so terrible,
that women and nervous persons

408
00:53:55,276 --> 00:53:57,862

fly in terror at the sight of him.

409
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:03,201

And how do you get tickets to see him?

410
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,371

Your very own Sunny Jim!
- Let's go and see him!

411
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:10,125

Keep your shirt on.
The time must be right.

412
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:17,716

Now he's in the attic, but tomorrow
they'll move him to Bedstead Square,

413
00:54:18,174 --> 00:54:22,637

right into my lap.
Then, for the right price

414
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:28,893

you'll see something you'll
never ever see again in your life!

415
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:23,114

Don't look so glum girls!
Volunteers should be more cheerful!

416
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:27,035

Put your collar straight, girl!

417
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,537

And remember

418
00:55:29,996 --> 00:55:34,584

that under no circumstances whatsoever

419
00:55:36,544 --> 00:55:39,798

are any mirrors to be brought here.
- Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.

420
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:42,926

Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.
- Yes.

421
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:45,720

Right.

422
00:55:50,975 --> 00:55:54,396

He's so ugly!
- Well, ugly or not, help me!

423
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:04,364

Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

424
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:05,865

Yes.

425
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:08,993

You look nice in your new clothes.

426
00:56:11,454 --> 00:56:15,000

Thank you very much.
- Well, if there's nothing else,

427
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:19,087

we'll be leaving you now.
- No, there's nothing.

428
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:51,453

Ready for tea?

429
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:55,707

Please go in, John.

430
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:04,382

Make yourself comfortable.

431
00:57:16,853 --> 00:57:19,898

Anne, come and meet our guest.

432
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:30,700

I'd like you to meet my wife, Anne.

433
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:33,453

Anne, this is John Merrick.

434
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:40,752

I'm very pleased to meet you.

435
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:45,632

I...

436
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:49,719

I'm very pleased.

437
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,520

What is it? What's the matter?

438
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:02,649

It's just that I...

439
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:06,736

I'm not used

440
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:10,782

to being treated so well

441
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:14,911

by so beautiful a woman.

442
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:22,377

Would you like a cup of tea?
- That's a good idea.

443
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:28,508

Come and see the rest of the house!

444
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,564

How's your tea?

445
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:47,736

Very good.

446
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:54,784

I'm enjoying my visit very much.

447
00:58:56,036 --> 00:59:00,623

It's very kind of you
to invite me to your home.

448
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:09,257

I'm sorry
that I made a spectacle of myself.

449
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:11,301

No, not at all.

450
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:18,767

I love the way

451
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:23,897

you've arranged the pictures.
- Oh, thank you.

452
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:27,609

Is that the way in most houses?

453
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:30,570

Yes, I'm sure it is.

454
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:33,114

Who are they of?

455
00:59:33,823 --> 00:59:38,078

These are relatives
and these are our children.

456
00:59:38,536 --> 00:59:40,997

Children? May I see?

457
00:59:41,664 --> 00:59:43,083

Yes, of course.

458
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,801

Where are the children?

459
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:57,055

They're out with friends.

460
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,266

Friends...

461
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:04,437

Here is Frederick's mother.

462
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,696

And these are my parents.

463
01:00:18,535 --> 01:00:23,415

They have such noble faces.

464
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:28,378

Yes, I've always thought so myself.

465
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:32,173

Would you...

466
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:36,386

care to see my mother?

467
01:00:37,512 --> 01:00:39,055

Your mother?

468
01:00:40,598 --> 01:00:41,975

Yes, please.

469
01:00:50,775 --> 01:00:52,402

Oh, but she's...

470
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:55,822

Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful!

471
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:57,449

She has...

472
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:01,995

She has the face of an angel.

473
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:12,213

I must...

474
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:19,429

I must have been
a great disappointment to her.

475
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:22,015

No, Mr. Merrick, no.

476
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:26,061

No son as loving as you
could ever be a disappointment.

477
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:31,524

If only I could find her!

478
01:01:31,983 --> 01:01:37,238

If she could see me
with such lovely friends,

479
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:42,035

perhaps she could love me as I am.

480
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:48,917

I've tried so hard to be good.

481
01:01:55,548 --> 01:01:56,800

I'm so sorry.

482
01:01:57,258 --> 01:01:59,886

Sorry.
- Please!

483
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:02,305

I'm so sorry.

484
01:02:03,264 --> 01:02:05,600

Please!

485
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:45,849

What's that you're doing?

486
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:50,854

What is it?

487
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:56,359

Oh, I see! St. Philip's!

488
01:02:56,818 --> 01:03:01,656

Why, it's very good!
You've got the windows just right!

489
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:18,590

I wish

490
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,761

I could sleep

491
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:25,972

Iike normal people.

492
01:03:33,396 --> 01:03:35,065

Mr. Treves,

493
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:41,571

there's something
I've been meaning to ask you

494
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,492

for some time now.
- What's that?

495
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:48,661

Can you cure me?

496
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:51,164

No.

497
01:03:52,874 --> 01:03:55,335

No. We can care for you,

498
01:03:57,253 --> 01:03:59,839

but we can't cure you.

499
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:01,299

No.

500
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:04,469

I thought not.

501
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,357

Come in.

502
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:19,734

Good morning!

503
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:25,865

Good morning.
- Someone would like to meet you.

504
01:04:26,324 --> 01:04:30,370

May I introduce you to one of the
bright lights of the English stage?

505
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:33,373

Mrs. Kendal, this is John Merrick.

506
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:38,545

Good day!
- Good day.

507
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:41,548

I've brought you some things.
I hope you like them.

508
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:47,512

I hope you don't think it too forward?
- Oh, no.

509
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:52,434

I knew you'd understand.
- I'll leave you together.

510
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,604

Here.

511
01:04:58,773 --> 01:05:02,944

I want you to know I don't give
my pictures to just anyone.

512
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:06,781

No, I wouldn't think of it.

513
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:11,870

It's beautiful. You're so...

514
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:16,833

I'll put it...
