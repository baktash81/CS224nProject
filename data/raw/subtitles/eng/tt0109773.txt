Timing's everything.

00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:56,833
Morning.

4
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,667
I found this apron
in the drawer.

5
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,233
It's my pop's.

00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:04,867
Did you cook?

8
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,033
Cook?

9
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,867
I don't cook, Nelson,
at least not that way.

10
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:12,867
You're going to need
your strength, baby.

11
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:13,867
Uh, for...

12
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:18,300
Oh, look, I got
to get to work.

At 10:00?

14
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,467
Yeah. It's
banker's hours.

15
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,900
You can spare me
five minutes.

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,400
You won't regret it.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,133
I take longer
than five minutes.

18
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,867
But I don't.

19
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,533
Man.

20

Look, people,
just because I have this devilish charm

25
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,567
doesn't mean I won't
blow her brains out.

26
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:04,767
Everybody down right now.

27
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,533

You're my helper.

Don't shoot.

Move, you're dead meat.

39
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,933
You! You don't move,
and you're dead meat.

get here, I'll be gone.

I am taking this lady
hostage.

64
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I don't want anybody to move
for the next five minutes.

65
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,100
Is that understood?

66
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,867

tchaikovsky?

mood today.

I want to hear
the <i>1812 overture.</i>

Get in the car!

78
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,467
Did you have to push me
against that guy?

79
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,667
He smelled like a dead fish or
something equally disgusting.

[Sniffing]

81
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:18,767
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess it was your cologne.

Good morning to you, too, patrice.

83
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,100

What?

85
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:24,900
The teller put
a dye bundle in.

86

90
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:46,100
Guess you didn't figure on a cop being in the area.

91
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,600
Nelson, you're getting
arrogant and careless.

92
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,367
Patrice, did you want
to help me or bitch?

93
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,867
Let me rephrase that.

94
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,867

and help me.

It's agency business,
mira,

You know, mira,
I know your story.

371
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,100
You made a few busts

372
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,600
on some small-time counterfeiting rings,

373
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
and then you quit
the agency

374
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
and the people
who trained you.

375
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Then you hired yourself out to private industry

376
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,900
like some
cheap whore.

377
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,100
Then you hire some punk kid to help you.

378
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,100
Pardon me. I think
this is important.

379
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,600
[Whistle]

380
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,033
It looks like somebody
threw a party in here.

381
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:51,433
Where's patrice?

382
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:55,000
She's, uh, she's
having a bad hair day.

383
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,500
She's coming,
isn't she?

384
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,467
May I say
something, please?

385
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,367
According to our
initial figures,

386
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:04,200
no money
has been taken.

387
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,367
So what?

388
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:07,267
Doesn't that seem
a little strange--

389
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,600
the bank is robbed,
and nothing was taken?

390
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,333
Idiot. They're
after something

391
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,100
in the safety
deposit boxes.

392
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,100
Just give me that inventory list I asked you for

393
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,533
and quit wasting everybody's time playing detective.

394
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:29,333
Just another amateur.

395
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,333
I got a proposition
for you.

396
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,333
It's right up
your alley.

397
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,100
How would you
and patrice

398
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,333
like to do some serious investigating work for us?

399
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,600
You've got
to get me a lead

400
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
before the company
goes bankrupt

401
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,100
paying off these inflated safe deposit box claims.

402
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Hey, I'm staking a lot
on you and patrice.

403
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,100
I know. I know.

404
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,600
You can't let me down.

405
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
I won't.

406
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,700
Come on.
I'll buy you lunch and explain it.

407
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,600
You know why I love
tires so much, Tony?

408
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Nope.

409
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,700
Do you want to know?

410
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,167
No, not a bit.

411
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:37,467
Tires are circles,

412
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:40,300
the most perfect geometric shape in the universe.

413
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,833
Everything possible is represented in a circle.

414
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,767
It's a beginning
and an end.

415
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:50,767
Tony, I have come to see second chances are possible

416
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:53,433
'cause we're all
in the same path.

417
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:55,100
Redemption is simply
another path

418
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,400
leading us back
to a new beginning.

419
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,833
Why couldn't you just get Jesus like every other con?

420
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
My boy!

421
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Hey, what are you
doing here?

422
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,100
You weren't supposed to be here till next week.

423
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,233
I was in
the neighborhood, pop.

424
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,233
What's that?

425
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:17,233
New job.

426
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:18,233
Tony.

427
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,233
Hey.

428
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,633
What? What?
What? What?

429
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,633
What? What?

430
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:25,633
All right, patrice
is bailing on me.

431
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:28,100
She finally got tired
of you acting

432
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
like some kid
with expensive toys.

433
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Thanks for all
your support, pop. Great.

434
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,267
Hey, I love you,

435
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:36,767
but I know you.

436
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,100
You know me.

437
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,400
Come on. Sit back down.

438
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,600
You want to talk about it?

439
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,600
No, pop.
I don't want to talk about her now.

440
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,467
All right. Fine.

441
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,800
Wait a minute.

442
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,067
It's from those robberies
on the news.

443
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:25,767
These are tire tracks
from the scene?

444
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:27,067
That's right.

445
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,033
Bennington xgc-79s.

446
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:33,033
You can tell the tire by looking at the photos?

447
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:34,033
Yeah.

448
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:36,533
Come on, pop,
give me more.

449
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,600
Give me more
about the tracks.

450
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,267
Nothing. I just thought
it was interesting.

451
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:43,800
Oh, wait.

452
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,600
No cash was taken?

453
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Nope.
No cash whatsoever.

454
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Mira thinks it's some sort of big insurance scam.

455
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Still, leave that money
just sitting there?

456
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
So you would
take it, huh?

457
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
No, I'm
making a point.

458
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
I myself
am reformed.

459
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
That stuff don't tempt me no more.

460
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,100
All I want to do is my time,
get out,

461
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
and open
my tire store.

462
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,600
Sam Potter's on
a straight path,

463
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,833
or rather,
a circular one.

464
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:17,400
Ooh-whee,
I know this ass.

465
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
What?

466
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Lily.

467
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Lily?

468
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Lily?

469
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Your Lily?

470
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,600
His Lily?
Our Lily?

471
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
I mean, Lily-Lily?

472
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Are you sure
about this, pop?

473
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,100
Trust me.
It's her.

474
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,267
Ain't that right,
Tony?

475
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,700
I don't want to
talk about it.

476
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:33,867
See?

477
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,867
Tell me.
This is Lily?

478
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,367
She's behind
these heists?

479
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:38,367
Lily?

480
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,367
Wait a minute. Lily's
got a great--hmm--

481
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:42,367
yeah.

482
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:43,867
But brains--no.

483
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:46,867
She must be hooked up
with somebody else.

484
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:49,100
Pop, this is an
unbelievable lead.

485
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,600
I can take this to mira.
I solved the case.

486
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,100
Slow down, Sherlock.

487
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
We didn't solve
nothing yet.

488
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,600
We can't prove
that's Lily's ass.

489
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,233
O.K., what else?

490
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,100
You want to do this
with me?

491
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,600
Yeah, pop. Just like old times.
You and me.

492
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,100
All right,
first things first.

493
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,600
We got to plan our work.

494
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,100
And work our plan.

495
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,600
All right.
There's something that bugs me about this.

496
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,767
What are you
doing here?

497
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:38,767
I knocked.

498
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:39,767
Bullshit.

499
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:42,867
Yeah. I know.

500
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,400
Nice place, patrice.

501
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,900
Yeah. Real nice.

502
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,933
You and Nelson
have it good.

503
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:51,433
I don't live here.

504
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:53,867
We just have
our offices here.

505
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:56,600
Yeah. Actually,
actually, I knew that.

506
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,100
You two have a funny
kind of business,

507
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,533
don't you think?

508
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:04,200
What exactly is it
that you want, agent rankin?

509
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,600
Well, I'll tell you
exactly, patrice.

510
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,100
I want you to know that as far as I'm concerned,

511
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,600
Nelson Potter's nothing more than a common criminal.

512
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Well, the court
said otherwise.

513
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,400
Now, if you'll excuse me,

514
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,600
I have to make
a phone call to your office

515
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,533
to let them know
you're a slimy little creep.

516
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Nelson's old man cut
a deal with the d.A.

517
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
To get his son
off the hook.

518
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,500
The deal stunk then,
and it stinks now.

519
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,500
So what? It's old news.
Now let me pass.

520
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,000
Let you pass, patrice?

521
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,433
Well, why don't you
use the magic word?

522
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:44,600
All right.

523
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,100
Let me pass, asshole.

524
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,167
Aah!

525
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,667
Don't.

526
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:01,000
All right.

527
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,167
Here's a real cute gag
for you, patrice.

528
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,667
Tell me what you think.

529
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,367
Nelson uses
your security company

530
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:08,867
to pass along
the information he needs

531
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:11,367
to take down these banks
real easy.

532
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:12,700
That's just stupid.

533
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,100
Who's being stupid here?

534
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,600
Isn't it odd that of the last five banks robbed,

535
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,100
you and Nelson did security work on three of them?

536
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,600
Yeah. Nelson's
dirty, patrice.

537
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,100
I want him,
and one way or the other,

538
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,033
I'm going to get him.
You got that?

539
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,600
Now, in case you happen
to be involved,

540
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,600
you better come to me
and cut a deal

541
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,100
'cause you're too young
to go to prison.

542
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,600
And you will go down as an accessory.
I promise.

543
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,533
It is a nice place.

544
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,100
What's this?

545
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
I'll tell you
something, patrice.

546
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
You should've thought
twice about quitting

547
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,533
before you
actually quit.

548
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:30,267

00:49:58,067 --> 00:49:59,567
No, I didn't.

What's going on?

742
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,100
Nothing. I just thought
maybe the security camera

of the intruder.

744
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,600
That's a good idea.

745

Yeah, I know, Nelson.

746
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,100
That's what I do best.

01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:21,733
Patrice.
Patrice, it's me.

911
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:22,933
It's Nelson.

912
01:04:22,933 --> 01:04:25,467
I'm a few doors down
from this place.

913
01:04:25,467 --> 01:04:28,900
It's called grime-busters
laundromat. I'm on 10th.

914
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,033
Listen, sweetie, I'm giving
myself up, all right?

915
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:34,533
I need someone
to go with me, though.

916
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:37,900
I don't need rankin putting
warning shots in my head.

917
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,767
He's giving himself up.

918
01:04:39,767 --> 01:04:42,367
Wherever you are,
you stay there.

919
01:04:42,367 --> 01:04:44,900
Pop? What are you doing
out of jail?

920
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,167
I'll tell you later.

921
01:05:13,967 --> 01:05:15,733
Where's Potter?

922
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:17,400
Sam's in the bathroom.

923
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,367
Yeah, right.

924
01:05:19,367 --> 01:05:21,300
He's got diarrhea
from dinner.

925
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:27,900
Good idea.

926
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,333
Check on him later.

927
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:00,633
Ahh.

928
01:06:00,633 --> 01:06:02,333
Hee hee hee hee!

929
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:06,000
The daughter
I always wanted.

930
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,500
Shh, pop.
I'm incognito.

931
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,767
You're incog-something.

932
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,233
Yeah, yeah.

933
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:12,067
What are you
doing here?

934
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:14,567
As long as I'm back
before roll call,

935
01:06:14,567 --> 01:06:16,067
everything will be fine.

936
01:06:16,067 --> 01:06:19,567
Can we go now?
We'll drop your father off at prison.

937
01:06:19,567 --> 01:06:21,900
Maybe they have
a night depository.

938
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,400
It's a joke,
wasn't it?

939
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,033
You told me she had
no sense of humor.

940
01:06:26,033 --> 01:06:28,033
She doesn't.
That was a joke.

941
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:29,267
Are you two done?

942
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:31,267
I want to ask Nelson
something

943
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:32,767
before I forget again.

944
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:35,167
Remember when we made up
those gags?

945
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:39,000
Did you ever tell Lily about
that treasury deal gag?

946
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
No.

947
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,667
No, but that's it.

948
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:43,833
That's it, pop.
That's got to be it.

949
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,367
What?

950
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:46,633
What? Please.

951
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:50,133
Banks turn in old cash,
damaged cash to the treasury.

952
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:52,567
The treasury replaces it
with brand-new currency.

953
01:06:52,567 --> 01:06:53,567
If you were
a counterfeiter

954
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,900
and wanted
your phony money

955
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,800
to get to the biggest number of people

956
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,900
without being
checked...

957
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,200
Break into a bank,
substitute the funny money.

958
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,233
And nobody checks
the treasury's currency.

959
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:06,233
It's from the treasury.
It's got to be good.

960
01:07:06,233 --> 01:07:07,867
That's pretty clever.

961
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:08,967
Thank you.
Thank you.

962
01:07:08,967 --> 01:07:09,900
[Door opens]

963
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:19,700
Well, well, well.

964
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,933
Sam,

965
01:07:21,933 --> 01:07:23,933
what a pleasant
surprise.

966
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:26,300
And what do we
have here?

967
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,233
Looks like a scumbag
reunion to me.

968
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:36,967
And just where do you think you're going?

969
01:07:36,967 --> 01:07:38,967
Huh, Sam?

970
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:41,100
Want to get downwind
of you.

971
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,233
Good one, pop.

972
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,067
Shut up, butthead.

973
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,933
No. Nelson.

974
01:07:52,933 --> 01:07:55,333
Stay here
and face this.

975
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:43,900
Pop, maybe we should try to find the next bank.

976
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,400
Time's running out.

977
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,133
This gag's only got
a short life span.

978
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:49,633
I don't know then.

979
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:51,133
Maybe I should
give up

980
01:08:51,133 --> 01:08:53,967
and you should go
back to prison.

981
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:55,467
Maybe that's
the best thing.

982
01:08:55,467 --> 01:08:56,967
What? Give up?

983
01:08:56,967 --> 01:09:00,967
Will you quit thinking like
some middle-class doofus?

984
01:09:00,967 --> 01:09:04,000
Who's going to believe us about this counterfeit thing?

985
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,433
The gang's
going to disappear.

986
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:08,433
You'll be left
holding the bag.

987
01:09:08,433 --> 01:09:10,567
Besides, we're Potters.

988
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:12,400
We don't quit.

989
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,800
Fast getaways--
that's our specialty.

990
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,300
Yeah, I know, pop.

991
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,800
You know, if you
think about it,

992
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,467
all we really need is the delivery list from the treasury.

993
01:09:23,467 --> 01:09:24,800
That'd do it.

994
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,900
What are you doing?

995
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,400
You know, pop...

996
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,233
Pop, patrice's computer
is at the house, right?

997
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,733
It's hooked right into

998
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:34,767
the police department's
database. Huh?

999
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,500
Now, that's my boy.

1000
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,067
"Give up."

1001
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:42,333
Ought to give you
a noogie.

1002
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:43,367
Noogie, noogie.

1003
01:09:43,367 --> 01:09:44,867
Pop, I'm driving here!

1004
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:46,567
Just like old times.

1005
01:09:46,567 --> 01:09:48,467
Yeah, it is.

1006
01:09:48,467 --> 01:09:52,967
This is great, pop.
This is what it used to be like

1007
01:09:52,967 --> 01:09:55,467
when we used to go
camping, remember?

1008
01:09:55,467 --> 01:09:56,967
We never went camping,
Nelson.

1009
01:09:56,967 --> 01:09:58,567
We were bank robbers.

1010
01:09:58,567 --> 01:09:59,733
Oh, yeah.

1011
01:09:59,733 --> 01:10:02,233
This is what it
would have been like

1012
01:10:02,233 --> 01:10:05,233
if we would have
went camping.

1013
01:10:07,567 --> 01:10:09,567
Did you miss that stuff?

1014
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:12,233
You know, boy scouts,
fishing trips,

1015
01:10:12,233 --> 01:10:13,233
normal stuff?

1016
01:10:13,233 --> 01:10:15,067
No. No, I didn't.

1017
01:10:15,067 --> 01:10:17,567
I turned out o.K.,
didn't I, pop?

1018
01:10:17,567 --> 01:10:19,467
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

1019
01:10:19,467 --> 01:10:20,400
Thanks.

1020
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:25,733
What did you do?

1021
01:10:25,733 --> 01:10:28,400
Mexican food.
It does me wrong.

1022
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,900
That's why we never
went camping.

1023
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,967
Yeah.

1024
01:10:31,967 --> 01:10:32,900
Phew.

1025
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,067
Something died.

1026
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:37,233
Sorry, pop.

1027
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,167
Ooh!

1028
01:10:41,733 --> 01:10:45,067
Surprising, they didn't charge you with anything.

1029
01:10:45,067 --> 01:10:47,567
They still might,
according to rankin.

1030
01:10:47,567 --> 01:10:49,067
Nelson say anything?

1031
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:50,567
Something about
counterfeiters

1032
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:53,567
replacing cash in banks.

1033
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:54,567
What?

1034
01:10:54,567 --> 01:10:56,567
Replacing what cash?

1035
01:10:56,567 --> 01:10:58,567
I don't know.

1036
01:10:58,567 --> 01:11:01,633
It just sounded right
at the time.

1037
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:04,067
Now it just sounds dumb.

1038
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,433
Let's go get
in my car.

1039
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:23,567
Hmm.

1040
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:25,067
Where'd you get these?

1041
01:11:25,067 --> 01:11:28,067
Patrice has got a survival kit in the Jeep.

1042
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:30,367
If the world
comes to an end

1043
01:11:30,367 --> 01:11:31,667
right now,
right here,

1044
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:32,667
we're covered.

1045
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:33,667
Smart girl.

1046
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:35,433
Yeah, yeah.

1047
01:11:35,433 --> 01:11:38,100
Look, what if it's not this bank?

1048
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:40,567
Nelson...

1049
01:11:40,567 --> 01:11:44,600
Both of us go to jail
for a long time.

1050
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:49,567
Oh...

1051
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:51,067
Hello, Lily.

1052
01:11:51,067 --> 01:11:52,567
How you been?

1053
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:53,800
Ha ha!

1054
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,867
Down. Down. Down.

1055
01:11:56,867 --> 01:11:58,100
She's coming.

1056
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,467
[Telephone rings]

1057
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:05,367
[Ring]

1058
01:12:06,867 --> 01:12:07,967
Hello?

1059
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:08,967
Nelson.

1060
01:12:08,967 --> 01:12:10,467
Are you o.K.?

1061
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:13,000
Yeah. They didn't
charge me with anything.

1062
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,500
Where are you?

1063
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:17,000
Me and pop
got them surrounded.

1064
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,667
You'll see us on
the 11:00 news.

1065
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,667
Nelson, please,

1066
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:20,967
no more cops and robbers.

1067
01:12:20,967 --> 01:12:22,567
Tell me where you are

1068
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:25,500
so mira and I
can come and get you.

1069
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:30,033
God, I hate it
when he does that.

1070
01:12:30,033 --> 01:12:32,567
It was
a wrong number.

1071
01:12:32,567 --> 01:12:35,067
That's a good thing
you did, son,

1072
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:37,100
keeping her out of it.

1073
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,400
Where is he?

1074
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,100
He's got them surrounded.

1075
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,233
Does your car
have a lo-Jack?

1076
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,900
Of course.
I'm a security expert.

1077
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,900
I got a friend on the Tucson police department.

1078
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,400
Hi. It's mira.

1079
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,900
I need a favor.

1080
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,067
No questions, o.K.?

1081
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:59,333
A lo-Jack trace.

1082
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:20,067
Pop, when do we call
the cops?

1083
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:22,267
How about never?

1084
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:40,100
Oh, this is
going to hurt.

1085
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,167
Sam.

1086
01:13:51,067 --> 01:13:52,567
Knock it off, Lily.

1087
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:54,067
You want some, too,
Nelson?

1088
01:13:54,067 --> 01:13:56,567
You do, and I'll shove
those fake tits

1089
01:13:56,567 --> 01:13:58,100
right up into your throat.

1090
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,100
Fake?

1091
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,567
Fake, my ass.

1092
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:02,667
Yeah.
Maybe that, too.

1093
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:06,333
Ladies, ladies,
peace. Be friends.

1094
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:08,633
Is little Nelson going to protect his girlfriend

1095
01:14:08,633 --> 01:14:10,933
like he did with
the FBI agent?

1096
01:14:10,933 --> 01:14:12,333
You did what?

1097
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:14,733
They're ready.

1098
01:14:18,867 --> 01:14:23,067
Aah!

1099
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:24,767
All right!
Let's go!

1100
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:29,567
Let's go!
Let's go!

1101
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:30,567
Come on!

1102
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:31,867
Come on.

1103
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,900
Come on, move!

1104
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,400
Come on.
Come on.

1105
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,733
Get on the floor.

1106
01:14:56,733 --> 01:14:58,067
Get on the floor.

1107
01:15:01,867 --> 01:15:03,300
Listen up.

1108
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,600
The generator's going to replace the city's power,

1109
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,600
but the alarms are going to be cut from the inside.

1110
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,600
Then mira will show up

1111
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,567
and make sure nobody from the
cops or the bank comes inside.

1112
01:15:14,567 --> 01:15:16,067
That's pretty clever.

1113
01:15:16,067 --> 01:15:17,567
Thank you.
Thank you.

1114
01:15:17,567 --> 01:15:20,067
Yeah.
We thought about it.

1115
01:15:20,067 --> 01:15:22,400
So much brains
and talent...

1116
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,967
And so little common sense.

1117
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:38,933
Ha ha ha ha.

1118
01:15:38,933 --> 01:15:40,433
Better watch her, buddy.

1119
01:15:40,433 --> 01:15:44,833
She's got a way
of coming back at you...

1120
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:47,367
Like
a bad tuna sandwich.

1121
01:15:47,367 --> 01:15:50,433
I thought tuna fish
was your favorite.

1122
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:54,133
[Lily]
Just sit back and relax.

1123
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,633
We have a few hours.

1124
01:16:14,067 --> 01:16:16,033
Pop, pop,
you all right?

1125
01:16:16,033 --> 01:16:17,000
Yeah.

1126
01:16:21,067 --> 01:16:22,567
[Bruno]
Tie her up.

1127
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:42,867
Tell everybody
five minutes.

1128
01:16:42,867 --> 01:16:44,533
Perfect.

1129
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,333
How you doing?

1130
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:51,567
Frank mira,
bankers security insurance.

1131
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:53,067
Everything's under control.

1132
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,033
Thanks.

1133
01:16:58,667 --> 01:17:00,700
[Softly counting]

1134
01:17:06,967 --> 01:17:08,467
My butt fell asleep.

1135
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:09,967
Yeah, mine, too.

1136
01:17:09,967 --> 01:17:11,167
Shh!

1137
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:12,633
Hey, eat me, Bruno.

1138
01:17:14,933 --> 01:17:16,567
All right, Bruno,
I'm shushing.

1139
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:18,167
I'm shushing.

1140
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:22,833
How can you laugh
at a time like this?

1141
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:25,167
I do have
a sense of humor.

1142
01:17:25,167 --> 01:17:26,167
I know.

1143
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:27,200
I know.

1144
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,467
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you earlier

1145
01:17:29,467 --> 01:17:31,700
how much I liked it.

1146
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:35,067
I hope it's not too late or anything, but...

1147
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,767
I don't want you
to leave the company.

1148
01:17:37,767 --> 01:17:42,067
It takes imminent death for you to appreciate a person.

1149
01:17:42,067 --> 01:17:44,233
You know something,
Nelson?

1150
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:46,667
You know what
your main problem--

1151
01:17:54,067 --> 01:17:56,567
your problem is that...

1152
01:17:56,567 --> 01:17:59,067
Well, you haven't done that
nearly enough.

1153
01:17:59,067 --> 01:18:02,067
Well, I never thought
I had a chance with you.

1154
01:18:02,067 --> 01:18:03,733
Are you serious?

1155
01:18:03,733 --> 01:18:05,033
Shh!

1156
01:18:05,033 --> 01:18:07,267
Oh, eat us, Bruno.

1157
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:17,400
Let 'em make as much noise as they want.

1158
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,133
We're all clear!

1159
01:18:19,133 --> 01:18:20,133
Um...

1160
01:18:20,133 --> 01:18:23,000
Could we
stand up maybe?

1161
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,567
Slowly...

1162
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:25,767
Very slowly.

1163
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,300
You know, Lily,

1164
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,800
I think my dad has
a, uh, concussion.

1165
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,800
He won't feel a thing
after that nitro blows up.

1166
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,467
Mira, that was not
in the original plan.

1167
01:18:36,467 --> 01:18:37,967
A slight modification.

1168
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:39,300
You all die here,

1169
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,800
and it looks like
you messed up

1170
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,267
with the acetylene tanks,

1171
01:18:43,267 --> 01:18:45,967
a sad ending to a brilliant
bank-robbing team.

1172
01:18:45,967 --> 01:18:48,467
Put that cash in my car.

1173
01:18:48,467 --> 01:18:49,967
Hurry. Let's go.

1174
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:52,900
Damiano, you're going
to blow us all up!

1175
01:18:54,767 --> 01:18:56,467
Move them
into the vault.

1176
01:19:22,533 --> 01:19:23,533
Easy.

1177
01:19:23,533 --> 01:19:26,067
On the shelf.
Over there.

1178
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:28,033
Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

1179
01:19:30,067 --> 01:19:31,567
We got two minutes.

1180
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:33,567
Let's move it.

1181
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:35,067
Come on.
Bruno, two minutes.

1182
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:36,367
Let's go. Out.

1183
01:19:36,367 --> 01:19:37,367
Come on.

1184
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:38,367
[Beeping]

1185
01:19:38,367 --> 01:19:39,300
Watch it!

1186
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,333
Aah!

1187
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:45,900
Aah!

1188
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,567
Aah!

1189
01:19:47,567 --> 01:19:50,567
Aah!

1190
01:19:50,567 --> 01:19:51,567
Lily!

1191
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:52,567
[Alarm ringing]

1192
01:19:52,567 --> 01:19:53,567
Lily!

1193
01:19:53,567 --> 01:19:55,067
It's not my fault!

1194
01:19:55,067 --> 01:19:56,567
I shut down the alarm!

1195
01:19:56,567 --> 01:19:57,967
That goddamn fire alarm!

1196
01:19:57,967 --> 01:20:00,467
Go! Go!
Get out! Get out!

1197
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:01,567
Go!

1198
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:02,500
Pop? Pop?

1199
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:06,067
Aah!

1200
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,067
Shut up!

1201
01:20:07,067 --> 01:20:08,567
Don't be funny.

1202
01:20:08,567 --> 01:20:11,133
Come on.
Let's go.

1203
01:20:11,133 --> 01:20:12,133
Pop.

1204
01:20:12,133 --> 01:20:13,633
Come on. Pop. Pop.

1205
01:20:13,633 --> 01:20:14,633
Hmm?

1206
01:20:14,633 --> 01:20:15,633
Hi, Nelson.

1207
01:20:15,633 --> 01:20:16,633
Come on.

1208
01:20:16,633 --> 01:20:17,633
What's up?

1209
01:20:17,633 --> 01:20:18,633
Untie me.

1210
01:20:18,633 --> 01:20:19,633
Oh, sure.

1211
01:20:19,633 --> 01:20:20,667
Yeah.

1212
01:20:21,967 --> 01:20:25,467
How come everything looks like a bad porno movie?

1213
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:27,400
Snap out of it.
Let's go.

1214
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,367
Lily!

1215
01:20:49,467 --> 01:20:51,900
Let's get out of here.
Let's go.

1216
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:04,567
I'll drive.

1217
01:21:04,567 --> 01:21:05,567
You sure?

1218
01:21:05,567 --> 01:21:07,067
Is a pig's ass pork?

1219
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:08,200
All right?

1220
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,233
Yeah.

Yeah?

1223

I'm still
a little fuzzy.

1224
01:21:26,867 --> 01:21:28,367
Maybe you
should drive.

1225
01:21:28,367 --> 01:21:29,667
I'll disconnect it.

1226
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:31,367
Good idea.
You all right?

1227
01:21:31,367 --> 01:21:32,367
Yeah.

01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,533
Patrice!

1276
01:25:00,533 --> 01:25:02,133
Aah!
Aah!

1277
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:17,467
Let go of me!

1278
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,267
Lily! Lily!

1279
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,833
It's payday.

1280
01:25:58,700 --> 01:25:59,733
Nelson...

1281
01:25:59,733 --> 01:26:02,000
Nelson,
are you o.K.?

1282
01:26:03,567 --> 01:26:05,067
Any serious damage?

1283
01:26:05,067 --> 01:26:06,100
Uh-uh.

1284
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:09,067
We got to find pop,
get him back to jail.

1285
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,867
Pop!

1286
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,267
Oh, my god.

1287
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,800
Pop!

1288
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,600
Pop!

1289
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:04,567
Didn't anybody ever teach you personal hygiene?

1290
01:27:04,567 --> 01:27:05,567
Pop!

1291
01:27:05,567 --> 01:27:06,567
Pop!

1292
01:27:06,567 --> 01:27:09,533
Pop, you gotta
go right now.

1293
01:27:09,533 --> 01:27:11,200
All right--
I love you, boy.

1294
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,533
Take good care of her!

1295
01:27:12,533 --> 01:27:13,533
I will.

1296
01:27:13,533 --> 01:27:15,067
Go, pop! Go! Go!

1297
01:27:15,067 --> 01:27:16,067
Whoo!

1298
01:27:16,067 --> 01:27:17,933
Ha ha!

1299
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:30,900
Yee-ha!

1300
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:37,833
[Sirens]

1301
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,333
Oh, shit.

1302
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,100
He's been in there
all night!

1303
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,033
You don't have to
check on him!

1304
01:27:59,667 --> 01:28:02,100
Oh. Sorry, Sam.

1305
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:04,367
No problem, eustus.

1306
01:28:04,367 --> 01:28:05,867
You o.K. Then?

1307
01:28:05,867 --> 01:28:07,633
Mexican food.

1308
01:28:07,633 --> 01:28:09,967
Yeah. O.K., well...

1309
01:28:09,967 --> 01:28:11,300
You relax,
take your time,

1310
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,733
come to breakfast
when you feel like it.

1311
01:28:13,733 --> 01:28:14,733
Thank you.

1312
01:28:14,733 --> 01:28:16,067
Come on, bash.

1313
01:28:16,067 --> 01:28:18,367
Give him some peace,
for crap's sake!

1314
01:28:18,367 --> 01:28:20,367
I made a joke.
Get it?

1315
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:23,267
For crap's sake!

1316
01:28:23,267 --> 01:28:24,667
Ha ha ha ha.

1317
01:28:27,533 --> 01:28:29,033
Timing is everything.

1318
01:28:29,033 --> 01:28:32,067
Hee hee hee hee hee.

1319
01:28:34,067 --> 01:28:37,133
Tire stores
are expensive to open...

1320
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:43,833
And old habits
are hard to break.

1321
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:46,067
Everything
looks so quiet.

1322
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:49,567
Do you think
he made it o.K.?

1323
01:28:49,567 --> 01:28:51,567
I hope so.

1324
01:28:51,567 --> 01:28:52,833
Yeah.

1325
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:54,833
Yeah.
Pop made it o.K.

1326
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:58,033
Soon I'm going to need
a new business partner.

1327
01:28:58,033 --> 01:29:02,000
You still want me
to leave the business?

1328
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I don't want you
to leave the business.

1329
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,900
I know you don't
believe in mixing...

1330
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,633
Business relationships
with romantic ones.

1331
01:29:12,733 --> 01:29:14,233
Wait a minute.

1332
01:29:14,233 --> 01:29:15,233
What?

1333
01:29:15,233 --> 01:29:17,167
Did I hear Lily right?

1334
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:18,733
Did you go after rankin
for me?

1335
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:21,033
Yes, milady, I did.

1336
01:29:21,033 --> 01:29:25,633
Nelson, do you know how
irresponsible that was?

1337
01:29:25,633 --> 01:29:28,100
Why did you do something
like that?

1338
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:32,467
"Why" is the wrong question to ask me right now.

1339
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:33,633
What?

1340
01:29:33,633 --> 01:29:35,100
Exactly.

1341
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,100
What do you say
about me and you, huh?

1342
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,600
I say, mmm...

1343
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,900
I'll think about it.

1344
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:51,900
O.K.

1345
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:52,900
Maybe.

1346
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:53,933
O.K.

1347
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:56,633
If your dad makes it o.K.,
then we'll talk.

1348
01:29:56,633 --> 01:29:57,733
Look.

1349
01:30:00,767 --> 01:30:02,567
Peace, pop.

1350
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:04,467
Dad's
going to be fine.

1351
01:30:07,733 --> 01:30:10,467
Us Potters are famous
for our fast getaways.

1352
01:30:10,467 --> 01:30:11,967
Do you know that?

1353
01:30:11,967 --> 01:30:13,067
Buckle up.

1354
01:30:13,067 --> 01:30:14,500
We're out of here.
