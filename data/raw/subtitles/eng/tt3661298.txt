he would be saying

Islamic revolutionaries have

178
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:09,862
(Isaac) Eight months.

179
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,665
(Farnaz) Just remember,
if they ask you questions,

180
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,749
say the minimum necessary.

181
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,212
(Habibeh) Don't worry, Amin is
a good man and he will get out.

182
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,966
Praise Allah.

183
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:31,384
Every pilgrim goes
to Mecca his own way.

184
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,891
(Guard) Sister?

185
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,810
I am looking
for my husband.

186
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,186
I was wondering if he's here.

187
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,021
- We don't give
out such information.

188
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:44,693
Brother, please, I would
like to know if he's alive.

189
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,279
He didn't come home
from work last night.

190
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,406
Maybe he had
better things to do?

191
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,741
I know plenty
of men like that,

192
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,911
but Isaac Amin is
not one of them.

193
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,912
(Guard) Who is this?

194
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,874
(Habibeh) I'm a friend.

195
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,419
All right, wait here.

196
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,754
(Habibeh) You see, khanoum, it
was good that you brought me.

197
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,507
He liked the idea of
someone like you would have

198
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:12,508
a friend like me.

199
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,597
(Guard) Come in.

200
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:17,560
(Habibeh) <i>n</i> will be all right.

201
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,730
(Guard) Yalla, yalla.

202
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:28,112
<i>S'?</i>

203
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,935
[gasp]

204
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,479
(Mohsen) State your name.

205
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,441
<i>(V avian) Vartan Soioy an.</i>

206
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,112
(Mohsen) You know this man.

207
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,822
I am afraid not.

208
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,491
(Mohsen) Then why the gasp?

209
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:19,664
The hood, brother, it
startled me.

210
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,544
(Mohsen) Take him.

211
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,296
Follow me.

212
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:36,973
<i>S'?</i>

213
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,210
You know that man,
Vartan Sofoyan.

214
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,170
I said I didn't and I don't.

215
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:14,050
Brother, I am here looking
for my husband, Isaac Amin.

216
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:18,221
(Mohsen) Sofoyan was good
friends with the royal family.

217
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,515
He played for them
on many occasions.

218
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,561
I really would like to
find out where my husband is.

219
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:28,315
You were once a journalist,
is that not correct?

220
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,276
(Farnaz) I would not
call myself that.

221
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,320
I wrote once in a while.

222
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,155
(Mohsen) A dabbler, then.

223
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,531
(Farnaz) I suppose.

224
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,577
Only those who can
afford to be dabblers, dabble.

225
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,662
Those who have to work, work.

226
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,790
I could only afford
it thanks to my husband,

227
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,875
who worked very hard.

228
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,712
(Mohsen) Yes, he worked very
hard in amassing his fortune.

229
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,756
He earned
his money honestly.

230
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,091
Tell me about
these articles of yours.

231
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,259
(Farnaz) They were light pieces.

232
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,803
I'm feeling light
this morning, indulge me.

233
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,513
(Farnaz) I wrote
about foreign places.

234
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,932
(Mohsen) You touted
the virtues of alcohol

235
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,434
and gushed about cathedrals.

236
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:08,438
Your articles were pieces of
propaganda for an indecent life.

237
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,982
(Farnaz) Why am I
being interrogated?

238
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,653
I am not charged with anything.

239
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:20,159
Please, Brother, tell
me where my husband is.

240
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,664
(Mohsen) It's time you
understood, Sister Amin,

241
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:30,665
that the times when people like
you could demand things from us

242
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,963
8T6 OVGI...

243
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,967
Now, it is our turn.

244
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,055
Get out.

245
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,900
Did they
say anything to you?

246
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,488
They asked me whether
I like being a servant.

247
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:03,489
What does that
have to do with anything?

248
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,080
You're not letting these people
put ideas into your head,

249
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,832
are you, Habibeh?

250
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:13,833
- No, no, khanoum, of
course not.

251
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,171
- Good.

252
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,005
- But I don't know.

253
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:21,006
My son says there's a lot
that needs to be set right.

254
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,220
- What?

255
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,180
Morteza has become
a revolutionary?

256
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,182
- He has joined the Guards.

257
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,269
I didn't want to tell you,
because I thought you might get

258
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,271
upset with me.

259
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:35,233
But when I listen to him,
he makes a lot of sense.

260
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,527
- What does he say
that makes so much sense?

261
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,822
- He says, Why should
some people live like kings,

262
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,949
and the rest like rats?

263
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,495
And why should the wealthy, so
crazy for the West and Europe,

264
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:52,041
decide how the whole country
should dress, talk, live.

265
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,546
What if we want our mullahs to
rule us and not that saint,

266
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:00,049
Morteza told me he's
worshipped in Europe.

267
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,885
I know, Saint Laurent?

268
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,636
Or something like that.

269
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,096
(Farnaz) Yves Saint Laurent?

270
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,559
(Habibeh) Yes, that's him.

271
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,438
- He's not a saint,
he's a designer,

272
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,774
that is his actual name.

273
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,358
- You see, khanoum?

274
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,903
You put me down
every chance you get.

275
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,280
- No, Habibeh,
I'm not putting you down,

276
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,948
but you don't know what
you're talking about.

277
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,202
You're just repeating some
nonsense that you heard.

278
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:32,203
Khanoum, you're
doing it again.

279
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:37,003
Sorry. Habibeh, you're
entitled to your feelings,

280
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,215
but what I ask of you is that
you don't forget the friendship

281
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,467
that we've shared
for so many years.

282
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,094
(Habibeh) No, khanoum,
I don't forget,

283
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:50,095
but am I a friend to you as Mr.
Sofoyan is to you, and Amin?

284
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,768
You dine all together.

285
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,771
You go to the theater,
but in 20 years,

286
00:21:54,772 --> 00:22:01,111
I have not even
shared table with you.

287
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:23,963
[distant shouting]

288
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,139
(Mehdi) Get used to it.

289
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,310
If they don't say
your name, thank God.

290
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,856
If they do, say a prayer.

291
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:46,777
Ask Allamfor-- he
knew his end was near.

292
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,202
(Isaac) How did he know?

293
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,330
(Mehti) He just did.

294
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:58,126
One develops a sense
for these things.

295
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:02,547
You can smell it on your
interrogator's breath.

296
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:07,548
You know when he's had
enough to deal with you.

297
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:13,434
[distant shouting]

298
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:20,690
(Farnaz) Your father gave it
to me when Parviz was born.

299
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,400
He cut the stone himself.

300
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,611
(Shirin) Okay, when were
you last wearing it?

301
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,238
(Farnaz) For Parviz,
at the farewell party.

302
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,699
(Habibeh) You're going to be
late getting Shirin to school.

303
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,077
(Farnaz) Habibeh, have
you seen my sapphire ring?

304
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,831
The one with the small diamonds
around the center stone?

305
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,041
I'm afraid not, khanoum.

306
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:43,042
It was just here. It did not
walk out on its own.

307
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,133
I'll keep
an eye out for it.

308
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,554
(Farnaz) Thank you.

309
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:56,059
(Mohsen) Tell me about
your brother, Navid.

310
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,270
I'm not really
all that close to him.

311
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,230
(Mohsen) Well, it may interest
you to know that

312
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,274
he has a new job...

313
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,568
smuggling vodka
into the country.

314
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,905
Well, if in fact my
brother is involved with

315
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,825
smuggling vodka, I have
nothing to do with it.

316
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,245
(Mohsen) You know, I
like you for some reason,

317
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,915
and I want to help you,
but I can't do it alone.

318
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,251
You have to help me.

319
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,587
Do you think he'll
get away with it?

320
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,673
You and your family
of libertines,

321
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,008
you think you can
protect each other?

322
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,885
Perhaps there
has been some mistake.

323
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,597
(Mohsen) The mistake,
Brother, is yours.

324
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,183
You seem to think this
is some kind of game.

325
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:37,934
(Isaac) No, no, no--

326
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:45,985
(Mohsen) Then you will tell me
where I can find your brother.

327
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,945
(Isaac) Look, Brother,
lam a simple man,

328
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:53,658
I-- my preoccupations
are my work,

329
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,618
and my wife, my daughter--

330
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,497
(Mohsen) Simple? I suppose
figuring out all

331
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,666
your bank accounts is simple.

332
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,043
I for one had trouble
following it all.

333
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:09,044
I'd say it takes a pretty
sophisticated mind to carry out

334
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,633
all these transactions.

335
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,969
Sophisticated
in business, yes, but--

336
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,805
(Mohsen) Listen
to me, listen to me!

337
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:20,806
We know everything about you,
what you stock in your pantry,

338
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:26,854
even the kind of cognac
your wife likes to drink.

339
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,697
How sad it should come to this.

340
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,326
Here.

341
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,127
Help yourself...

342
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,548
we may be here a long time.

343
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,145
What's the matter?

344
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,232
I need a light.

345
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,693
(Mohsen) Well, then,
Brother, just ask.

346
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,028
And I'd like the same from you.

347
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,989
When I ask you for something,
I'd like to get it

348
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,452
without too much difficulty.

349
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,874
[sizzling noise, screaming]

350
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:29,505
You can make it stop.
You can make it stop!

351
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:50,359
[screaming]

352
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:55,734
[phone rings]

353
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,157
Hello.

354
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,535
Momma, it's me.

355
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,410
Parviz.

356
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,872
I'm just-- I'm checking to
see how you are.

357
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,583
It is so good
to hear your voice.

358
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,085
And how
is Shirin doing?

359
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,253
She's fine.

360
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,003
And Papa?

361
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:15,091
He's-- he's still at the
office, working late.

362
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,718
Listen, sweetheart,
would it be all right

363
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,387
if I call you back later?

364
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,098
I am expecting a call.

365
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,391
Okay, sure.

366
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,351
We love you.

367
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,020
I love you, too.

368
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:33,652
<i>S'?</i>

369
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,500
(Habibeh) Good morning, khanoum.

370
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,628
(Farnaz) Good morning.

371
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,922
(Habibeh) Are you all right?

372
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,382
(Farnaz) Yeah...

373
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,343
I'm getting up.

374
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:05,017
(Habibeh) This practice,
khanoum, will have to stop.

375
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,978
(Farnaz) Oh, I
only had one glass.

376
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:13,232
(Habibeh) One glass or ten,
it makes no difference.

377
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,069
It is illegal now.

378
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,493
Is that a threat?

379
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,204
It's just
a fact, khanoum.

380
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:31,000
The fact is that
this is my house...

381
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:36,001
and today is Wednesday, so don't
forget to wash the windows.

382
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,885
Yes, khanoum.

383
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,742
(Sofoyan) Isaac.

384
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,078
(Isaac) Vartan.

385
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,122
Vartan Sofoyan...

386
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,333
my god.

387
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,210
Three weeks ago you were
teaching Shirin

388
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,545
to play the violin.

389
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,548
(Sofoyan) I wish...

390
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:24,846
(Guard) All prisoners,
go back to your cells.

391
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,611
(Navid) Farnaz, please
take it easy, okay? Please!

392
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,363
(Farnaz) Sorry, but nobody's
picking up the phone

393
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,532
in this place. Why is that for?

394
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,408
(Navid) Just calm down.

395
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,037
(Farnaz) I don't understand
what's going on.

396
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,330
Talia, what is happening?

397
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,164
What are you doing?

398
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,124
(Morteza) Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey-

399
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,084
Everything is okay, don't
worry. Don't worry.

400
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,044
(Farnaz) Morteza,
what is going on here?

401
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,587
Nothing, nothing, we're
just trying to move the

402
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,132
equipment and the stones
to a more secure location.

403
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:01,841
(Farnaz) The stones?

404
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,426
Yes, to protect them
from the revolutionaries.

405
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,095
We think they may
want to seize them. Okay?

406
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,681
(Farnaz) Is that so?
(Morteza) Yes.

407
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,807
(Farnaz) And how do you know?

408
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,268
Now listen to me,
trust me, okay?

409
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:16,939
I just want to help you.
Wait, wait, please.

410
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
We would like to go in.

411
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,650
No, no, you cannot
go in now.

412
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,735
Don't come in, just leave.

413
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,111
(Navid) Where are you
taking everything?

414
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,279
(Morteza) To a safe place.

415
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,364
Now go home, you must have
more important things

416
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,782
to take care of.

417
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,283
I'm going in.

418
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:30,953
You're not going in. I'm
asking you nicely.

419
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,664
Don't let this get nasty.
I'm telling you--

420
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,917
[screams]

421
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:41,088
(Navid) Farnez... Farnaz.

422
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,799
Whoa, let me go, let me go.
Farnaz, be careful!

423
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,886
What is going on here?

424
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,431
Farhanika, can you explain this?

425
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm sorry, khanoum, things
have gotten out of hand.

426
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:56,020
I tried to talk some sense into
them, but there was no use.

427
00:30:56,021 --> 00:31:00,316
They said-- they said I was
blind to all the exploitation

428
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,109
that's been going on for years.

429
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,110
- Exploitation?

430
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,737
- They said--
- These people were all

431
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,656
unemployed gypsies when
my husband hired them.

432
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,825
He took them in, paid
for their education.

433
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,702
Is this what you
call exploitation?

434
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,121
They weren't
exactly gypsies, khanoum.

435
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,831
They might have
lacked education,

436
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,832
but we weren't--

437
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,752
I'm sorry, I did not
mean it that way,

438
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,338
especially not
about you.

439
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:26,675
It's just that I--
I don't understand.

440
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,302
Why are they doing this?

441
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,723
How could they forget everything
that he did for them?

442
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,059
(Farhanika) That's
how it is now...

443
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,893
sorry, khanoum.

444
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,811
(Navid) Have you lost your mind?

445
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,397
This is not fair, he hasn't
even had his trial yet.

446
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,856
Farnaz, are you okay?

447
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,524
(Morteza) Trial?

448
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,359
If you guys think there's
going to be a trial,

449
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,154
you're going to be
very disappointed.

450
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,829
Morteza, why
are you doing this?

451
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,874
Was my husband bad to you?

452
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,461
Did he ever refuse you anything?

453
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,714
You see, khanoum...

454
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,759
you fail to understand.

455
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,178
I mean that sincerely.

456
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,890
You see, this isn't
just about one man.

457
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,851
It's about a collection of men.

458
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:20,896
Men who turned their
back on injustice.

459
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,691
Men who profited from
a corrupt regime.

460
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:28,692
Men who built their villas and
traveled whenever they wished...

461
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:34,614
to places the likes of us
didn't even dare to dream of.

462
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,664
Have you ever thought
about how we lived?

463
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,415
Huh?

464
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:44,416
Why does a country with so much,
give so little to the poor?

465
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,505
You never cared.

466
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,174
But that's okay, you know why?

467
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:52,219
Because God has answered
the prayer of the weak.

468
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,220
God is on the side of the
faithful, not on the sinners.

469
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,267
God will forever--

470
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,019
- Since when are you
so faithful?

471
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,563
Just a couple of years ago, you
would show up with your tight

472
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:07,564
jeans and borrow our car to pick
up one of your five girlfriends.

473
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,656
You think that beard
makes you a man of God?

474
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,617
(Navid) Farnaz, come on,
let's go, that's enough.

475
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:18,579
(Farnaz) And since when is
stealing people's possessions

476
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,414
the call of God?

477
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,249
You are all hypocrites...

478
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,126
who have suddenly
come into power

479
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,421
and don't know how to handle it.

480
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:45,941
<i>S'?</i>

481
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:05,956
Does anyone remember a
time when this country

482
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,713
was just, generous?

483
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,257
(Sofoyan) Cyrus the Great.

484
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:18,181
They were all equal.
Muslim, Christian, Jew...

485
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:26,397
didn't matter.

486
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,109
What a great empire.

487
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,527
(Mehdi) Oh, what
would you please?

488
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,196
That's the problem
with this country.

489
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,366
We somehow think we're special,
because once upon a time

490
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,159
we were great.

491
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,789
Darius, Cyrus, Persepolis...

492
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,625
that was 2,500 years ago.

493
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,794
What are we now?

494
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,588
Huh?

495
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,591
Barbarians.

496
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:57,136
No...

497
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,848
not all of us.

498
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,060
You're gonna throw this
to them or get a picture?

499
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:05,936
(Farnaz) Not yet.

500
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,104
(Isaac) Take a picture for her.

501
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:11,900
(Farnaz) Ah! Wait maybe a pin--
- Sorry, sorry--

502
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:16,901
(Shirin) Mom! What
happened here?

503
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,951
I looked everywhere
for that ring.

504
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,997
It's just not here.

505
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,340
(Shirin) Look at Papa's head.

506
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:40,258
And look at
you, you're so beautiful.

507
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,558
You're so beautiful.

508
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,105
What's he doing that?

509
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,815
(Farnaz) He's
stepping on the glass.

510
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,441
(Shirin) What for?

511
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:57,442
(Farnaz) It's to remind us that
even in times of great joy,

512
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,824
<i>there is sadness.</i>

513
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,660
That love is fragile.

514
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:07,957
It can break if
you're not careful.

515
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,839
Shirin...

516
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,840
at some point, Guards will be
coming to search the house.

517
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,848
We have to get rid of anything
that could look incriminating

518
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,100
to your father.

519
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,769
The same way that you had to
tear the pictures of the Shah

520
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:37,487
from your school books, all
of this will have to go.

521
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:57,841
That is your Uncle Navid
when he was a little boy.

522
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,769
(Shirin) Momma?

523
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Believe it or
not, September, 1958,

524
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,737
when I first met your
father in Shiraz.

525
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,906
(Shirin) My breath is narrowed
down to one long sigh,

526
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:27,828
for a red mouth that burns
my thoughts like fire.

527
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,788
Give me that.

528
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,706
Papa wrote that.

529
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:35,707
It is his handwriting,
the words belong to Hafiz.

530
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,213
It's about love?

531
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,382
Yeah.

532
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,635
Let me read it.

533
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,271
My breath is narrowed
down to one long sigh,

534
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,816
for a red mouth that burns
my thoughts like a fire.

535
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,320
When will that mouth
draw near and make reply,

536
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:06,868
to one whose life is
straightened with desire?

537
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:27,472
(Farnaz) Oh, it's beautiful!

538
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,599
Look at the kitchen!

539
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:31,934
(Isaac) You like it?

540
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:36,731
(Farnaz) Can we afford it?
(Isaac) Yes.

541
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,278
Oh, it's beautiful!
It's beautiful!

542
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,571
Want to see the
best part?

543
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,864
- Yeah.
- The bedroom.

544
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:50,619
No, I'm kidding. Come on.
It's not that, but come on.

545
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,787
Okay.

546
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,288
Close your eyes.

547
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,250
No!

548
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,961
(Farnaz) Oh... a
reflecting pool.

549
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,295
(Isaac) It needs some water.

550
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:04,800
You always talked about
the one you had growing up. Hm?

551
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,635
What was it you used to say?

552
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:14,394
I could always count on
its, simplified beauty. Hm?

553
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,396

554
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,314

Hurry! Take that.
Move. Take it.

562
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,347
(Farnaz) Shirin.

563
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,518
Shirin?

564
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,906

566
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,945
I have to go
check on my daughter.

567
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,488
(Guard) You're not
going anywhere.

568
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,697
I'll be right back.

569
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,576
(Guard) Sit!

570
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,492
The ring...

571
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:41,124
give it to me or
I'll cut it off.

572
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,425
Give it to me now!

00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,945
Where were you?

576
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,363
I was hungry.

577
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,657
I was in the kitchen.

578
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,577
Well, now
that you are here,

579
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:24,000
show me where your
mother keeps her jewelry.

580
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,130
Goodbye, Sister.

581
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:50,109
<i>S'?</i>

582
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,003
(Farnaz) It's okay.

583
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:14,424
Everything is going
to be all right, baby.

586
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,566
- Praise Allah.
- It's Okay.

587
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,278
(Ramin) They already
killed my mother.

588
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,950
They really killed my mother.

589
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:51,457
(Guard) Bijan Yadgar, Behrooz
Ghodsi, Jahanshah Soheil,

Sofoyan, Ramin Ameri.

594
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,418
(Ramin) it will be all right.

595
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,461
Isaac it will be all
right, you will see.

596
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,757
72 virgins may be
waiting for each of us.

607
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,915
(Farnaz) Your mother
is feeling better?

608
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,750
(Habibeh) Much better, khanoum.

609
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,918
(Farnaz) Hold on sugar.

610
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:41,006
Thank you, her birthday was
a real celebration.

611
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:44,759
You should see my nephew, what
a handsome boy he is becoming.

612
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,513
In a few years, he will make
a fine husband for Shirin.

613
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,933
(Farnaz) And Morteza?
Was he there?

614
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,059
(Habibeh) No, khanoum,

615
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,478
he doesn't come to these
family gatherings.

616
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,440
He thinks he has
better things to do.

617
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:03,441
(Farnaz) Like looting.

618
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:09,993
What?

619
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,203
He didn't tell you.

620
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,955
He looted Isaac's office.

621
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,166
He and the other employees.

622
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,667
My Morteza?

623
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,919
I was there, I saw it.

624
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,962
You misunderstood.

625
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,173
He said they were
moving the goods someplace else

626
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,926
for safe keeping,
but I know better.

627
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,970
You know better?

628
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,890
What is it that you
see it always right?

629
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:35,518
Is it possible you choose
to see what you want?

630
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,270
(Farnaz) I saw what I saw.

631
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,147
You saw what you saw.

632
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,691
You're a kind woman,
Farnaz-khanoum,

633
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,818
but you are full of scorn.

634
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,821
When I tell you maybe one
day my little nephew

635
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,573
will marry your Shirin...

636
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,658
do you think I'm serious?

637
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,702
I say these things as a joke.

638
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,331
I know that you will never
tell me how you really feel,

639
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,541
so you say nothing or you smile.

640
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,668
I am telling
you what I saw.

641
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:05,669
I saw your son and the other
employees taking jewels,

642
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,134
paintings, tables, chairs.

643
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:12,972
And when I confronted him, he
said that Isaac had to pay for

644
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:16,434
the sins of a whole
collection of men.

645
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,685
He said this?

646
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,396
Yes.

647
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,774
Well, maybe
Amin-agha should pay.

648
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,984
Maybe it's time someone paid.

649
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:28,363
(Farnaz) Isaac has never
harmed anybody,

650
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:30,532
least of all, you and your son.

651
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,699
He does not have to pay.

652
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,993
Why is it that some
people were meant to be served

653
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:38,373
on hand and foot, and all the
others could hope for was

654
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,457
washing toilets?

655
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,876
(Farnaz) You think
Isaac was born a prince?

656
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,922
No, Habibeh, the money
didn't fall from the sky.

657
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,341
You work hard, you do well.

658
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,134
I work hard.

659
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,301
My son works hard.

660
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:54,681
And you have come a
long way from where you started.

661
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:58,435
Do I need to remind you of the
way you lived when we met you?

662
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:02,230
You and your snot-nosed son
selling flowers

663
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,232
on the street corner.

664
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:08,278
You were so emaciated
that you fainted.

665
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:12,240
We got out of the car
and Isaac said to me,

666
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:17,241
Isn't there something we
can do to help these people?

667
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:23,747
And we took you in.

668
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,837
Now you tell me...

669
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:30,468
is this what my
husband has to pay for?

670
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:42,271
<i>S'?</i>

671
00:49:56,452 --> 00:50:01,452
(Mohsen) You say you wanted to
become a poet, so write me this.

672
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:14,011
How does a poet become
such a rich man?

673
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,559
Perhaps because the
jeweler and the poet

674
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,151
share the same weakness.

675
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,569
We seek perfection.

676
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:36,570
(Mohsen) There is no mention of
any friends or acquaintances.

677
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:39,744
(Isaac) I'm an introvert
by nature, Brother.

678
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:44,745
I enjoy spending time with
my family or being alone.

679
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:51,590
(Mohsen) Then we brought
you to the right place.

680
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:04,394
[faint shouting]

681
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,563
Hear that?

682
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:10,859
(Man) Ow! Ow! Agh!

683
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,369
(Mohsen) Now talk.

684
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,750
What do you
want me to tell you?

685
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,712
L-- I don't know the answers,
I don't know what to sa--

686
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:35,713
(Mohsen) Tell me about your
activities for the Shah!

687
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:40,054
And that brother of yours!

688
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,556
Where is he?

689
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,309
I swear I don't know.

690
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,185
I swear.

691
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,272
Brother, I swear.

692
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:49,856
Brother--

693
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:54,857
(Mohsen) Brother Mostafa, your
next man is ready for you.

694
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,154
(Isaac) Oh, no, please.

695
00:51:56,155 --> 00:52:03,829
I swear, I'm not--
please, Brother, please.

696
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:28,062
<i>S'?</i>

697
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:13,607
<i>S'?</i>

698
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,708
(Farnaz) Navid, you scared me.

699
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:34,293
Did you find out where he is?

700
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,338
I wish I had
more information.

701
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,091
The friend who told me about
Isaac's arrest tells me that the

702
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,801
Guards are after me, too.

703
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,137
They will get us
all at the end.

704
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:48,099
(Navid) Next month I'm expecting
lots of cash from a transaction.

705
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,269
I will use the cash
to pay the smugglers.

706
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,021
They will take me
over the mountains.

707
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,815
What transaction?

708
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,276
I'm importing
vodka from Russia.

709
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:01,904
If they catch
you, they will execute you.

710
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,489
I can't really
talk about it,

711
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,407
and the less you
know, the better.

712
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:07,368
The only thing is, I need a bit
of cash to hold me over until

713
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,537
the shipment arrives.

714
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,330
How much do you need?

715
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,249
About 10,000.

716
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,542
Dollars?

717
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:15,710
Of course.

718
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,837
That's a lot of money.

719
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,840
Please, if I
don't get out of Tehran,

720
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:25,011
they're bound to catch me.

721
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:30,012
On one condition, if
anything happens to Isaac and I,

722
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:35,730
you will see to it
that Shirin and Parviz

723
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:39,567
are safe and together.

724
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,027
Promise me.

725
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:46,700
(Navid) I promise.

726
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,758
(Farnaz) You can
fill in the rest.

727
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:11,475
(Navid) One more thing.

728
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:20,479
My god...

729
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,567
my ring.

730
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,110
I needed collateral
against the money I owed.

731
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:28,111
I didn't mention it, because
I knew I would return it.

732
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:29,909
So long, Farnaz.

733
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,162
Kiss little Shirin for
me and god willing,

734
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,290
I will see you on
some other continent.

735
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,879
Please, you need to
leave as well.

736
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:01,316
(Hossein) Water.

737
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,369
Fresh bandages.

738
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:18,370
(Isaac) Thank you.

739
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,005
(Hossein) Have you cried?

740
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:27,008
I can't anymore.

741
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:31,012
(Hossein) You'll feel
better if you cry.

742
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:36,013
[child running and shouting]

743
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,441
Mohsen's little boy.

744
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:48,029
Why would he bring his
child to a place like this?

745
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:52,033
(Hossein) Mohsen is very
proud of his son, you know?

746
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:55,870
He himself was in the same
prison for many years...

747
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,872
tortured by Savak.

748
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,416
(Isaac) Do you know why?

749
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:05,797
(Hossein) They
didn't need a reason.

750
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,217
So the missing finger...

751
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,678
(Hossein) That's not the
only torture he underwent.

752
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,306
Let's just say he never
thought he would have a child.

753
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:20,307
That little boy is a miracle,
the badge of his faith.

754
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,899
He's not a bad man.

755
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:32,491
You may have trouble believing
that, but he is not.

756
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,461
(Isaac) The Koran?

757
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,382
(Hossein) Have you ever read it?

758
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,968
You might find it helpful.

759
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:55,262
You have to believe
that you will make it.

760
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,225
Have faith.

761
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,806
[Phone]

762
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,349
Hello?

763
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,475
Momma.

764
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,812
Sweetheart,
how are you?

765
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,147
(Parviz) I'm great.

766
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,399
Actually I've just about to
play baseball with my friends,

767
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,400
but I was wanting to-- I was
wondering if Baba was there.

768
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:58,076
I wanted to say happy
birthday to him.

769
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,454
I'm afraid
he is not here.

770
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:06,455
What do you mean? It must be
close to midnight there, right?

771
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,461
Momma?

772
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:11,423
Momma, what's going on?

773
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:17,261
Momma, where is Baba?

774
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:20,389
He's been arrested.

775
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:20,723
What?

776
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:25,724
I went to prison, but
they wouldn't tell me anything.

777
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,855
Is he alive?

778
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,858
I don't know.

779
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:35,154
I'm so sorry.

780
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,282
We should have
left when you did.

781
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,492
It's okay.

782
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,493
No, it's not.

783
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,912
(Parviz) Please, Momma, ssh.

784
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,705
It's okay, Momma.

785
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:49,543
I'm so sorry.

786
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,255
I just loved who we were here.

787
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,215
Okay, I'm coming home.

788
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,759
- Nah, nah, nah--
- Momma, please!

789
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,262
You stay in
school where you're safe.

790
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,056
There's nothing you can do here.

791
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,766
There's nothing I can do.

792
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,560
They will release him when
they realize that he's

793
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,938
done nothing wrong.

794
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:12,775
And we will get out.

795
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:17,571
Please promise me that
you will not come back,

796
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:22,201
that you will stay there.

797
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,577
Please.

798
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,037
Okay,
okay, I-- I promise.

799
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,039
I need to
leave the line open,

800
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,000
in case your uncle calls, okay?

801
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,669
And what about
Shirin, huh?

802
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,212
She's upstairs...

803
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,631
asleep.

804
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,259
We are okay.

805
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:41,596
We will see you very soon.

806
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,770
We love you very much.

807
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,898
(Parviz) I love you, too.

808
01:00:52,899 --> 01:01:00,323
<i>S'?</i>

809
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:34,065
[cell door opens,
banging and shouting]

810
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,566
[gunshots]

811
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:32,082
[gunshots]

812
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:59,651
[sobbing]

813
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:08,033
[trickling urine]

814
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:15,375
[cries hopelessly]

815
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:37,647
[call to prayer sounds]

816
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,118
(Mohsen) What do you
say in defence?

817
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,203
What I said before.

818
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:58,204
That I am innocent.

819
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:07,719
I will also say this, I have
followed the wrong path in life.

820
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:16,723
I pursued material wealth, which
in the end, brought me nothing.

821
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,607
(Mohsen) Nothing?

822
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:26,608
Look at your villas, the trips
you took, the oars you drove.

823
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,408
Me, I have nothing.

824
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,620
For two years, my son
wore the same shoes,

825
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,538
because I couldn't
buy him a new pair.

826
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:41,539
In the end, I had to cut the
front, so his feet could grow.

827
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:47,921
(Isaac) Yes, but,
look at me now...

828
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:52,346
and look at you.

829
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:58,645
I sit here before you,
my fate in your hands.

830
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:07,649
My daughter, with her
closet full of shoes,

831
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,615
has no idea where her father is.

832
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:15,077
The power of Abu
Lahab will perish...

833
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,288
and he will perish.

834
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:22,084
His wealth and his gains
will not exempt him.

835
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,545
(Mohsen) Very well
said, Brother.

836
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:28,298
I see you've been
using your time wisely.

837
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,802
I did the same when
I was in prison.

838
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,971
I read.

839
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:38,972
They were difficult
years, but the Koran,

840
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,813
the Koran gave me hope.

841
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:47,025
You know that I bring
my son here every day?

842
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:51,029
That is what I hear going up
and down above my cell?

843
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:54,074
(Mohsen) I once sat in a
chair very similar

844
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,410
to the one you're in.

845
01:05:56,411 --> 01:06:01,411
Now that the tables have turned,
why should I have mercy on you?

846
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,794
Because I have nothing
to do with the people

847
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,588
who caused you pain.

848
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:10,382
(Mohsen) Oh, but you do.

849
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,593
You look the other way.

850
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:15,471
Yes, you're
right about that.

851
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,098
I was blind.

852
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,851
I recognize that now.

853
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:25,852
But, please, Brother, if you say
that you sat in the same chair

854
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:32,779
as me, then you
must know my fear.

855
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:37,780
And more than that, my despair
at never seeing my family again.

856
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:45,455
(Mohsen) I not only know
your fear, I can smell it.

857
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:49,213
Afraid I've gotten
addicted to it.

858
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:54,636
Than you are as much
a prisoner today as I am.

859
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:04,432
Your mercy may liberate me from
these walls, but more than that,

860
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,860
it will save you from yourself.

861
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:19,702
<i>S'?</i>

862
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:37,345
I can change my ways.

863
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,807
I can prove my sincerity.

864
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:46,186
Perhaps I can sustain the
cause of the revolution

865
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,523
with a generous donation.

866
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:52,526
(Mohsen) How generous?

867
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,361
As generous
as necessary.

868
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:58,198
I've received similar
offers before, Brother,

869
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:02,452
none was satisfactory.

870
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:07,083
I need a more specific answer.

871
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:11,545
(Isaac) Everything...

872
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:16,546
my entire life's savings.

873
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,721
Everything.

874
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:30,023
Every pilgrim goes
to Mecca his own way.

875
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,417
I have to go home first.

876
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:53,462
The bank will need

Not the weather, not the Guards
that patrol the borders,

You will need God by your side
throughout this adventure.

1070

- I've called on God many
times already this year.

could have taken the letter.

there I thought of you

and Parviz, your mother.

1108

I talked to you.

- I saw Vartan
Sofoyan in prison.

1115
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:29,053
- So did I...

1116
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,764

1117

I got to know him.

(Morteza) Yes, sir.

1127
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:55,014
I was in the old office building
when he came back looking for

1128

1129
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:00,812
My guess is that he was
planning to leave the country.

1130

I'll pass this along
to the proper authorities.
