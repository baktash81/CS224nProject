1
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:38,733
He ain't got nothing on me.

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,998
Who's he making accusations?

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,099
With that stringy haired ho,
she ain't going nowhere.

4
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,873
Saw that bitch the other day,
and I was like,

5
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,708
why are you always up in his face?

6
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,312
And she was like, "don't go there".

7
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,349
Anyway, he better
keep his thing out of

8
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,015
that smelly trash before saying
I got me some fun going on.

9
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,593
You know what I'm saying?
Right?

10
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,628
You see, she agrees.

11
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:13,104
Come on. She knows.
She remembers.

12
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,589
...and even the eggs of
intestinal parasites may be preserved.

13
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:42,560
What at times disturbs the purity of
the archeological deposits

14
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,301
is the discovery of fossils
belonging to the burrowing rodent.

15
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,936
They die naturally in their burrows long

16
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,102
after humans have occupied the site.

17
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,241
That's it for today.

18
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,418
Don't forget your assignments,
for next week.

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,217
It's hard to say.
It's still really early.

20
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,950
Right. Right.
That's what I figured.

21
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,055
You know what?

22
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,192
Mom, I gotta go.
I gotta lot of work to do.

23
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,160
Oh, okay.

24
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,557
Cathy asked me
who you were seeing these days

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,429
and I just didn't know what to say.

26
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,503
Tell her I'm not seeing anyone.

27
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,799
So... there's... no one?

28
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,466
Why, like...
what do you want me to say?

29
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:32,181
Fine, tell her Gustav,
I'm all into Gustav.

30
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,286
Who's this?

31
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,748
I changed my mind.

32
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,884
Where did you meet him?

33
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:38,991
The bookstore.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,049
Well, what's he like?

35
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,726
Hmm, well, he's kind of a square.

36
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,999
I am so relieved
that you're meeting boys again.

37
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,696
Mom, I gotta go.

38
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,800
You know, he's waiting for me.

39
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,740
He's right with you now?

40
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,173
He's right in front of me.

41
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,803
Well, I'd like to meet him.

42
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,178
I think you should.

43
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,714
Hey, oh, I'm so excited you're here!

44
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,751
We'll be back, okay?

45
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,457
My God. I'm really glad you came.

46
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,685
Allison said you wouldn't.

47
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,022
I think you intimidate her.

48
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,492
She's something.

49
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,427
You think?

50
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,136
This year feels so different.

51
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:10,041
Like it should be better,
you know, but it's not better.

52
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,611
I'm drifting.

53
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,985
Rooming with you was
kinda like having an anchor

54
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,493
I didn't even know I needed.

55
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:25,890
I'm serious.

56
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,957
Why are you so amazing?

57
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:35,340
You're the amazing one, that voice.

58
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,503
Yeah, I sing...

59
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:57,956
Old man time......
why you gotta be unkind?

60
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,026
Old man time...

61
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,872
I feel so alone.

62
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,882
That was beautiful.

63
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,148
Thank you.

64
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,014
You must take lessons.

65
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,556
No, but I'm gonna.

66
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,430
You're an angel.

67
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,897
You know that, don't you?

68
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,000
I was just telling my friends that.

69
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,666
You were?

70
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,568
I told them you were special.

71
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,372
Real special.

72
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:50,945
Where you going?

73
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,549
Out the door.

74
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,614
What's your name?

75
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,146
Maya.

76
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,050
I'm Jared.

77
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,025
You are a beautiful girl, Maya.

78
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,422
Well, Jared, there are
a lot of beautiful women here

79
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,620
and I'm sure one of them

80
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,357
might find your crossing-guard
a bit endearing

81
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:07,830
-but I'm on my way out.
-Wait. Wait. Wait.

82
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,491
Let me ask you something.

83
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,603
I mean, how does one
approach such rare beauty

84
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,039
and not come off
the clumsy fool because...?

85
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,769
So that line has worked for you?

86
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,313
Has a high success rate?

87
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,653
This was its maiden voyage.
And I'm about to retire it.

88
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,758
Why are you all such phonies?

89
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,386
Tired and obvious lies.

90
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,325
You say that and it just shows
how little you think of me.

91
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,930
Try the truth next time.

92
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,272
You know those cold days, so cold,

93
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,636
you just can't feel your face cold,

94
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,574
and you start to figure how many
more steps before I'm inside.

95
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,737
If I slow down I may just not make it.

96
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,082
I first saw you on one of those days.

97
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,380
I just caught you smiling right there

98
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,819
in the middle of the arctic blast

99
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,822
and I nearly stopped dead in my tracks.

100
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,455
Your eyes, were just wide and intense,
you were reading some letter,

101
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:14,425
and then you let out this laugh
that was so natural, it was glowing.

102
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,200
And I wanted to smile too
but my face just wouldn't budge.

103
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,738
Then you walked right past me
and I was relieved somehow

104
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,866
because I wanted you to look up
but I was afraid you'd stop smiling...

105
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,379
And then I just had to let you pass me.

106
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,445
And I turned around but then you were

107
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,987
just a black coat
and a red hat walking away from me.

108
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,516
I've seen you a few times since then...

109
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,720
followed you a couple times but nothing.

110
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,886
Nothing.

111
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,194
This was my chance.
I couldn't let you go.

112
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,542
That was flattering, Jared...
in a restraining order kind of way.

113
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,544
Come on, just give me a chance, okay?

114
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,705
Let me get you a drink.

115
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,784
Okay then,
let me get myself a drink, okay?

116
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,083
We'll go out back, and just talk
and get to know each other.

117
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,623
-Alright.
-I mean it, just talk.

118
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,194
Great. Great. Just talk. Scout's honor.

119
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,042
I'm guessing Cub Scout.

120
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,885
He took Ben out back
and started whaling on him.

121
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,650
What?

122
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,454
You know, he was just bustin on him,
giving him the shit.

123
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,859
That's how brothers are.
No hard feelings.

124
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,290
All because Ben didn't wake Jesse up.

125
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,124
Jesse's funny that way.

126
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,057
Sounds funny-farm funny.

127
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,893
You and your brother,
you two never fought?

128
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,538
Not over something so stupid.

129
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,936
Come on. Brothers and sisters
only fight over the stupid stuff.

130
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,270
Think about it. Who knows you better?

131
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,435
They're like master button-pushers.

132
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,979
All right, I admit I may
recall an incident involving

133
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,652
a hair clip of mine being
turned into a slingshot

134
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,124
where in which I might have
overreacted a little bit, and,

135
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,230
throwing my brother
in the closet for about three hours.

136
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,762
Ah-Hah, I see. Okay.

137
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,638
Any more twisted little tales
I should know about?

138
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,208
Not at this time, your honor.

139
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,776
So I was right about fighting
over stupid stuff.

140
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,713
And you admit being wrong
for once.

141
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,780
Maybe.

142
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:49,387
So, in conclusion,
the court finds Maya guilty,

143
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:57,359
guilty of being a tired, obvious liar...
and sentences her

144
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:03,132
to one amazing kiss from the prosecutor.

145
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,365
I'm suspending that sentence.

146
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,607
It's late.

147
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,079
And the verdict will have to be
returned at a future date.

148
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,386
Good night, Jared.

149
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,597
Future date. I hope spring's eternal.

150
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,137
I didn't know what to say to you.

151
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,576
I don't. I'm not sorry.

152
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,241
I didn't fuckin do anything.

153
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,561
You okay?

154
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,438
Just a little tired, I guess.

155
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:15,866
Here are the support beams.

156
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,037
Thanks.

157
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,243
I don't think there's
a place for you here.

158
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,252
You see the problem is
I have three T.A.'s already

159
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,051
and they won't let me
take on a fourth.

160
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,987
I just wish you would have
come to me sooner.

161
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,057
Do you realize that last semester
you didn't seem interested at all?

162
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,723
It's just that I thought
I wasn't gonna have the time

163
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,770
but I realize now I'm ready to
make that commitment.

164
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,467
Really it's a shame.

165
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,700
Well, my loss completely.

166
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,605
Well, the department has rules
and my hands are tied. I'm sorry.

167
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,217
I understand.
I just had to give it a try.

168
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,256
Standouts.

169
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,187
Students like you are stand outs,
Maya.

170
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,294
Smart and articulate.

171
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,628
That's a powerful combination.

172
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:17,831
I shall miss your input.
Well, first on my list next year.

173
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,901
Maya, hey, it's Jared.

174
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,346
What are you doing?

175
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,445
You know, it's been five days
exactly since we met.

176
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,710
Happy anniversary.

177
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:07,508
I've been thinking about you.

178
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,645
I was thinking we should go to
some really fancy restaurant,

179
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,987
and just make a romantic night out of it.

180
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:19,192
I've been thinking about you a lot.
I like you, Maya.

181
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,456
I want to see you.

182
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,226
What are you doing tonight?

183
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,733
Come on out. Come out.

184
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,303
We'll make it a night to remember.

185
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,674
I try to get the guys to listen
but they shoot me down.

186
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,851
Curious. Football.

187
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,745
What's that all about?

188
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,919
It pushes me, makes me prove myself.

189
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,153
You know, kind of like you.

190
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,830
But with you it's just not fair,
this way you got of seeing right into me.

191
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,069
Go ahead and try.
Read my mind.

192
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,102
Come on.

193
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,544
It's a big void.

194
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,887
That's all right. You'll find out later.

195
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,319
Pepper, please.

196
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,330
Thank you.

197
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,095
You know I could
have been a concert pianist.

198
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,901
...by the time I was twelve
I had my own recitals.

199
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,410
Big hopes for little Jared.

200
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,379
And then?

201
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,510
I turned thirteen.

202
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,557
Somehow sitting at the piano not so cool

203
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:57,254
but hanging out in the woods
drinking and partying.

204
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:02,332
Yeah, like, why tickle the ivories
when I could be tickling the girls?

205
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:04,792
You wasted your gift.

206
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,336
No, just outgrew it.

207
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,200
It was too controlled,
not spontaneous enough for me.

208
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:14,678
Give me, give me a challenge
that's dynamic with bite and real risks.

209
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,480
I can do without
all the mental yo-yo-ing.

210
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,552
Bringing that music to life.

211
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,551
Yeah, two hundred years ago,
as it was being created,

212
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,053
that's when it lived.

213
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,050
Playing it now
is like resurrecting the dead.

214
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:38,700
Why hang on to the past
when I can create my own moments now?

215
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,400
Beauty like that is hard to find.

216
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,704
I have something I want to show you.

217
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,412
This is my sanctuary.

218
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,084
A place to go when
things get out of control.

219
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,617
I'm always sneaking up here.
It's like...

220
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,294
You ever feel you're flunking out
in every way and no one notices?

221
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,665
Ever feel that?

222
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:15,505
Sometimes.

223
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,406
Yeah, it melts away up here.

224
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,170
A trillion stars each with
its own planets, and its own moons.

225
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,379
Suddenly, it's hard to
take anything so serious.

226
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,076
Check this out. Come on.

227
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:30,348
It's beautiful.

228
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:39,261
Yeah, that's the sight that
clears my mind, and erases all my pain.

229
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,575
You ever been hurt before?

230
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,642
I've had my share of pain.

231
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,807
I kind of doubt it.

232
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,050
You're an expert on my pain?

233
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,121
There's just something missing,
that's all.

234
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,884
A sadness, an edge, maybe, I don't know.

235
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,923
That's all.

236
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,990
You wouldn't know.

237
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,169
I only mean that it's,
it's packed real low, you know?

238
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:21,205
It's deep, it's not for public viewing.

239
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,980
But why talk about these things?

240
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,143
Blah, blah, blah.

241
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,588
Everything's the same afterwards.

242
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:45,124
Right, the fact is he was a great guy.

243
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,829
He still is I imagine,

244
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,097
and every reason was solid
and structured, no loopholes.

245
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,869
Amicable in every way.

246
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,506
And the hurt's all in my head.

247
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,288
I need to get over it,
I know it, and I will.

248
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,652
There's always the stars.

249
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,771
Catch! Oh, she's a pro.

250
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,545
They still make these?

251
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:47,858
What happened here?

252
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,882
You and I don't mix.

253
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,047
The little squirt broke my foot once.

254
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:27,765
My cousin had a beat-up one,
plastic all stripped off.

255
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:35,439
I threw it straight up,
higher than all the boys,

256
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,343
and it flew right into the pool.

257
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,380
It became a big,
soppy sponge, real heavy.

258
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,209
And I tried stomping on it...

259
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,415
I found a nice Cabernet.

260
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,155
Never doubted I would come.

261
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,223
You never know.

262
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,560
You can put that down now.

263
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,239
Sorry.

264
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:13,942
Here.

265
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,307
We should take it downstairs.

266
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,134
Don't.

267
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,706
You tap, they die.

268
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,082
How's the air up there?

269
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,555
Up where?

270
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:34,155
You ever see how they look at you?

271
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,583
The boys.

272
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,926
Look at me how?

273
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,704
Like a juicy plum their dry mouths aren't

274
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,535
permitted to touch.

275
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,479
Is that right?

276
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:09,191
Their eyes get all helpless, needy.

277
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,731
I've seen that look in your eyes.

278
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:25,874
I'm a quick learner.

279
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,338
Like silk.

280
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,486
So fess up, where you from?

281
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:16,952
Baltimore.

282
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,936
That's not what I mean.

283
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,835
God, you're so goddamned perfect.

284
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,589
Little Miss Perfect.

285
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:22,738
Enough, Jared. I mean it.

286
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:55,143
Okay, I give in, let go.

287
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,089
Let go!

288
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:09,983
Off!

289
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,184
Off!

290
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:18,864
You like that, huh?

291
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,404
-You like that?
-Don't!

292
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,231
Get off of me.

293
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,046
Fucking savage!

294
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,561
Hairy. Hairy fucking...

295
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,832
Sewer grease.

296
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,970
Look down at me, huh?

297
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,509
Look down at me, huh?

298
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:04,046
You fuckin' maggot...
you fuckin' nothing...

299
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,618
You fuckin little.....Nigger.

300
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:14,658
Little nigger, nigger with attitude.

301
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,167
Fuckin maggot.

302
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,141
You fuckin maggot.

303
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,677
You fuckin nothing.

304
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,080
Nigger with attitude.

305
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,460
Little Miss Shit.

306
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,899
You smelly fuckin' baboon cunt!

307
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,568
Oh God.

308
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,710
Oh God.

309
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:19,517
Oh, you fuckin baboon cunt...
baboon bitch...Oh God.

310
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:20,886
Do you lighten up.

311
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:27,192
Lighten up. Oh God.

312
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,429
Oh God.

313
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,644
Oh God.

314
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,090
Oh God.

315
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:06,070
Oh God.

316
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,302
God.

317
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:41,631
SPRING

318
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,803
It was a bright day like today

319
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:50,448
that I too began
my trek into the wilderness,

320
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:55,018
my odyssey into the wholly unknown.

321
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:04,690
It's for those of you today standing
at the precipice of your future,

322
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,833
preparing to tumble forward,
that what I'm about to say,

323
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,903
I hope, may let you soar.

324
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,273
Three words. Simple words.

325
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:24,747
So simple, in fact, they have
no meaning without context.

326
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:34,282
But understand them, believe them
and you too will live a life,

327
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:40,262
whether it be short or long like mine,
with no regrets.

328
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,929
It's these three words that society

329
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:50,837
and all others who are not
you unconsciously fear.

330
00:31:51,977 --> 00:32:00,180
But, if you choose to heed them,
heed them carefully, quietly...

331
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,711
You...are it.

332
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:10,918
Take a second, think about it
but just know that no one else...

333
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,163
No one knows
what it's like to be you.

334
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:20,566
Hard as they may try,
other people see you

335
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:26,871
only in terms of their lives,
their experiences.

336
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,736
Don't let them decide
what's right for you.

337
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,815
Your every step is yours as is
the path you walk on.

338
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,823
Yours alone.

339
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,681
Hi honey.

340
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:13,122
Ow, your brain dead mother fell asleep
in the sun yesterday,

341
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,919
and now I'm a crispy red.

342
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,620
Ouch, you're bad.

343
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,161
He's calling me "Hyawatha".

344
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,423
He is so bad.

345
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,290
Anyway, we're really going to
miss you this summer.

346
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,493
Our first summer without our little girl.

347
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,637
I'm sure you'll have no problems
getting a job though.

348
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,736
You get along so well with others.

349
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,148
Never a dull moment, that's what I love.

350
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,847
Always on your feet, always keeping busy

351
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,081
...now that is retail.

352
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:50,217
This is just the beginning of
our busiest season.

353
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,991
Now everyone can fold,
but there is an art to it.

354
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,192
Now, if we want the piece to sell,

355
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,599
we have to care about the fabric.

356
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:04,405
Appearance is everything. All right.

357
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,067
See. Here, give it a try.

358
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,442
Now watch for those wrinkles.

359
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:15,309
Okay. Keep it loose, let it breathe.

360
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,623
Right, that's it. Good job.

361
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,817
So you go to Claremont?

362
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,792
I took a class there once.

363
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,995
That's where I met my ex.
Ron was his name.

364
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,199
I don't know how he got
in there he was so stupid.

365
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,608
Anyway, that's Ron, you're Maya.

366
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:42,074
He must have been the stupidest person to

367
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,703
ever graduate from there.

368
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,847
I mean, sometimes I sit home

369
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:49,351
and think about
how stupid he was and just laugh.

370
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,657
Oh, so stupid.

371
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,851
Oh really you had to be there.

372
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,063
I am just lucky he's gone.

373
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,894
I mean, even his name is stupid. Ron.

374
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,328
Say it enough you'll realize it.

375
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:15,441
Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron.

376
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:21,046
Anyway, that's Ron.
I thought you should know.

377
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:50,100
You guys are right. Total bitch.

378
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,300
-Slammed.
-Mission impossible.

379
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:53,868
Leave it, okay?

380
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,537
Details?

381
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,346
It doesn't matter.

382
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,139
Come on, spill it, Johnny Tingle.

383
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,273
You're our only hope.

384
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:02,748
All right, all I'm going to say is

385
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,220
that I was so fucking real,
that it, it hurt.

386
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,455
Share your pain.

387
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,616
Hit us with dialogue.

388
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,456
So cold that she didn't even look at me.

389
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,828
And I ask her,
"what do you do in your spare time?"

390
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,363
She says, "I fold."

391
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,430
You got that in common.

392
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,400
Fuck you.

393
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,099
You know, she told Seline,
that in her spare time

394
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,142
she likes to build houses.

395
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,441
This girl does not build houses.

396
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,910
She builds houses.

397
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,682
That's a "dykey" thing to do.

398
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,190
See, how am I supposed to score

399
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,452
if we're not even playing the same game?

400
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,263
Hey.

401
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,039
Going for refills?

402
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:20,709
How you feeling?

403
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,041
Fine.

404
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,322
I put her in the closet.

405
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,028
You know the rules, Adrian.
She goes out back.

406
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,893
I can't just throw her out in the street.

407
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,158
I just can't.

408
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,200
Sure you can.

409
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:15,493
Hey chica, you're with us.

410
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:22,639
You want an apple? I got an apple.

411
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,901
Where am I?

412
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,070
Where dreams come true.

413
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:32,808
Comfortable?

414
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,845
Why did you bring me here?

415
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,047
I wake up and here you are.

416
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,490
Such beautiful lips. I want to cry.

417
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:46,057
I don't understand.

418
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,892
It don't matter. Look at me.

419
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,939
The eyes are innocent and sad.

420
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,979
You're not ready.

421
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,387
I'm sorry.

422
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,304
I don't have my purse.

423
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,147
Adrian. He'll have it.

424
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:43,510
As much as he loves us,
he don't trust us.

425
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:45,911
Adrian?

426
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,916
First door to the left.

427
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:51,521
He helps the helpless.

428
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,446
Last night's a blur.

429
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:54,156
Yeah, well you got burned.

430
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,020
I'm not catching.

431
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:01,363
Well, you're playing with fire,
you know...

432
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:09,771
Why are you here?

433
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:12,831
To get my purse.

434
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:19,010
You've been hanging around a lot.

435
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:21,546
Yep.

436
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,679
But you're not twenty-one.

437
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:29,755
I saw it. Nineteen.

438
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,819
A million times I have seen it.

439
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,398
Pretty just like you.

440
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,200
All that and more.

441
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:40,731
And she ends up hurting.

442
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,375
Are you trying to save me?

443
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:52,481
Eh, fuck it.

444
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:53,750
Just get out.

445
00:46:58,883 --> 00:47:00,680
Don't be mad, baby.

446
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,616
You brought me here, remember?

447
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:12,422
Why so cold?

448
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:18,767
Help the helpless?

449
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:35,509
Lost cause?

450
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,599
I DJ tonight.

451
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,931
Come by, hang out in the booth.

452
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,348
You're not that smooth.

453
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,362
Yeah I can get pretty rough sometimes.

454
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:53,925
See how they bleed into each other,

455
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:57,598
sharing themselves
with total strangers...

456
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,342
They need me...I love it.

457
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:52,822
You never went down.

458
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,619
No, I didn't.

459
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:58,893
That's okay.

460
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,864
It's better up than anywhere.

461
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,092
No one to hurt you.

462
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,570
Except when I lose it and go POW!

463
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,702
And then you're in trouble.

464
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,285
Maya, Maya. What's up?

465
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:29,620
So, Maya, you party hard, Maya?

466
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:30,791
Oh, you got?

467
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,489
Support. Support.

468
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:34,860
Don't worry about it, Maya,
I got you covered.

469
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,765
I'm okay.

470
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,273
You gonna offend him. Try a little.

471
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,576
Yeah, send it this way. She's cool.

472
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,441
You know Danny's here, right?

473
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:52,914
And?

474
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,347
You're the only reason he's here.

475
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,314
Hey, Maya what do you think of that guy?

476
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,948
Huh, is he cute?

477
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,496
Yeah.

478
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,167
You want to meet him?

479
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:15,503
Sure.

480
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:21,806
Later, he usually needs
a couple of hours to warm up.

481
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,518
You see, cause this guy, like,
what the hell is this?

482
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,088
You love it.

483
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,025
Hey.

484
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,856
Who's the clown with the silly cap, huh?

485
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,093
Hey Danny.

486
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,669
You said that you liked it.

487
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:54,140
Yeah, on the baseball field, maybe,
but not here in the hood yo.

488
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,370
Okay, fine.

489
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:03,784
Happy now?

490
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,388
Can you believe this joker
once spent five hours

491
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,996
in the pouring rain waiting for me
to come out of the club.

492
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,723
You know, I remember that.

493
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:18,026
That's not cool.

494
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:27,736
Yeah, he was all wet, crying...
Hey, ask, don't take.

495
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:31,006
Fine, Adrian can I please have a smoke?

496
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:38,486
Smoke mine?

497
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:42,422
Sure.

498
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,424
So, go ahead and smoke it.

499
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,369
I'm not gonna smoke it in
between your toes.

500
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:57,562
Yeah, you are.

501
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:37,845
Good boy.

502
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:47,145
So, Maya, you and Adrian...you know?

503
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,697
Why do you let him treat you like that?

504
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,466
He's just having fun. It's all good.

505
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,599
He's not trying to hurt nobody, really.

506
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,501
Really.

507
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,580
You know you have beautiful feet,
you know that?

508
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:24,183
Go ahead... kiss it...

509
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:46,445
Deeper.

510
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,224
Yeah, you are.

511
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,694
Yeah, you are.

512
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:52,439
Yeah, you are.

513
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:58,672
Yeah, you are.

514
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:40,395
I had this girl once...
like you, a college baby.

515
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,505
She said she had all the answers.

516
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:49,408
But, you know what,
she crumbled at all the wrong times...

517
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:54,310
yeah, I fucked her good though.

518
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,253
But I'm hearing shit yo.

519
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:03,824
Shit like
"Watch the bitch, she'll cut you down,

520
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,159
that soul is mean and cold..."

521
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,498
...But I see 'tude not ice...

522
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:18,103
My player's all growing up.

523
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,141
Oh, I'm liking that.

524
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:24,106
I'm down with you letting loose,
being you.

525
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,442
But don't forget who got you there,

526
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,950
who made you real...I schooled you.

527
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:39,220
So why go back?
You got nothing to prove.

528
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:52,083
FALL

529
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:00,626
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

530
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:05,400
May I have your attention please
cell phones, pagers, off.

531
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:11,443
Every semester
I'm blessed to share my voyage

532
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,550
with three world-weary travelers.

533
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:18,885
I'd like you to meet the Nina,
the Pinta and the Santa Maria.

534
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:23,825
They are my eyes and ears.
Treat them well.

535
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,390
They also have mouths.

536
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,796
So Tim, why don't you
introduce yourself.

537
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:37,670
I'm Tim Banks, grad student emeritus,
seven years and counting.

538
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,534
This is my fifth year
as the Santa Maria...

539
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,639
...and I do feel world-weary.

540
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:47,304
I'll be running the discussion groups
on Monday and Wednesday nights.

541
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:49,644
I look forward to meeting with you.

542
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:54,354
Thank you, Tim. Maya.

543
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,663
I'm Maya, undergraduate.

544
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:07,093
I'm on Tuesdays and Fridays.

545
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:25,276
Do you see how a few extra steps

546
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,582
gives you the momentum to
knock a guy's block off.

547
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:29,658
Well, that's the way it's gonna feel
when you play them.

548
01:05:29,993 --> 01:05:32,120
They're bigger, faster, stronger.

549
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,320
Now we're gonna play it
at the line this time...

550
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:37,856
See that pain you're feeling,
I want you to fire it back.

551
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:39,697
Go.

552
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:43,338
Tonight the Claremont Falcons take
on the Eastman Lions

553
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:46,738
in a war between teams
that goes back six decades.

554
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:49,071
It's under way. It's kicking it off.

555
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:50,975
Joe Goodman gets it for the Falcons

556
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:54,709
and tackled down just short of
the fifty-yard line by Seth Hall.

557
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:57,177
So we get an opportunity to
look at the young man,

558
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,550
Mike Mason, making his second start.

559
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,813
Tell him, hit me, it doesn't matter.

560
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,926
He stumbles back, off balance,

561
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,255
and I catch him just enough to
send him flying.

562
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,031
I gotta say if he turned
just the wrong way he'd be.

563
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:10,291
Are these real?

564
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,694
Hand 'em over, asshole.

565
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:14,494
You man enough to take them
from me, pretty boy?

566
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:18,569
You fuck!

567
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:20,408
Something in there you want, huh?

568
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,404
Lose the fucking attitude.

569
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:19,157
Marcie... Happy anniversary.

570
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,396
It was exactly two days ago that we met.

571
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:35,372
Pens down. Bring 'em up front.

572
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:14,046
Jared.

573
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:22,921
I saw you.

574
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:24,256
Huh?

575
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,725
I saw you cheating.

576
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,590
I'm reporting it to Professor Byron
and the dean's office.

577
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,259
You're shitting me. What the fuck?

578
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:37,569
It's your word against mine.

579
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,116
You could have called me right up there.

580
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:00,286
Why'd you wait?

581
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,630
Setting up some private time,

582
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,033
some you and me time.

583
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:21,178
I think you're hooked on me.

584
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:24,343
That's cool, you know.

585
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:25,977
Nothing to be ashamed of.

586
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:34,055
You want to see me again?
That can be arranged.

587
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:49,311
Ah, you're a sweet girl.
I still see that.

588
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:55,984
So what do you say?

589
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,028
I want to see you again.

590
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,573
I brought you something.

591
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:56,206
All right.

592
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:03,449
Get comfortable.

593
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:45,788
You are truly beautiful.

594
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:51,662
Thank you. And you...

595
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:56,729
are really sweaty.

596
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,072
I came straight from practice.

597
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,476
He's riding us hard for Midstate.

598
01:13:09,018 --> 01:13:10,144
He's... You been to any games?

599
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,045
No.

600
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:12,784
For real?

601
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,787
Oh shit, you're missing out on me
trying to impress you.

602
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,424
Saturday, I catch it at the two,
take a mad dive in for the TD.

603
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,624
Everyone's just going wild.

604
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:29,301
It was good.

605
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:31,267
You don't need to lie.

606
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:33,831
I'm not lying.

607
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,538
I don't go to the games. But I follow.

608
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:45,049
I follow you
and you didn't score a touchdown.

609
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:46,446
You didn't play.

610
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:51,356
I played.

611
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:56,859
It's okay. Really.

612
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:04,966
Words don't matter anymore.

613
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:14,371
You came tonight
and that means the world to me.

614
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:20,819
To a night to remember.

615
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:28,488
A night to remember.

616
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:41,075
So, I'm all yours, as I promised.

617
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,979
...at your complete disposal.

618
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:50,014
So when does this night
to remember begin?

619
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,081
I already thought it had.

620
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,389
I mean, what do you got in store for me?

621
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,663
Maybe you should look to the stars.

622
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:12,072
All right. You gotta let me take you
and show you something beautiful.

623
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:14,771
I promise you you won't regret it.

624
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,610
I don't regret.

625
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:33,458
Well, that's good, you know,

626
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:37,226
cause what's the point when you got now
just staring you in the face.

627
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,233
I'm starting to learn that myself.

628
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:49,133
I want you to stand up.

629
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:51,771
What for?

630
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,173
It's my night.

631
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:58,685
You promised.

632
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:15,902
Strip.

633
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:51,763
Embarrassed?

634
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:53,805
No.

635
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:03,949
Then... take it all off.

636
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,968
Cold?

637
01:18:18,773 --> 01:18:19,831
Uh-uh.

638
01:18:21,042 --> 01:18:22,202
You're shaking.

639
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:30,513
I'd light the fireplace...

640
01:18:33,514 --> 01:18:34,614
If there's one !

641
01:18:40,892 --> 01:18:41,916
Don't...

642
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:54,298
I can't help feeling
you're not at home here.

643
01:19:04,249 --> 01:19:06,149
What's mine is yours,

644
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,509
you know that.

645
01:19:16,661 --> 01:19:24,033
Seeing you, you here now,

646
01:19:28,106 --> 01:19:29,596
is more than I imagined.

647
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:37,642
Not a scar.

648
01:19:38,783 --> 01:19:40,148
No blemish.

649
01:19:46,691 --> 01:19:49,524
Just pure old-fashioned perfection.

650
01:19:55,066 --> 01:19:56,931
What every girl wants...

651
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:06,472
-Eyes to the sky.
-Oh God.

652
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,406
Yeah.

653
01:20:14,586 --> 01:20:16,076
I want to make you feel good.

654
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,624
I was such a stuck-up bitch before.

655
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,827
It's okay. I know how I was.

656
01:20:38,943 --> 01:20:40,570
I'm not a prude though am I?

657
01:20:50,889 --> 01:20:52,789
You're a big boy.

658
01:20:57,162 --> 01:20:58,823
You can take what I give you?

659
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:09,636
You know...I believe you.

660
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:32,826
You got it?

661
01:21:33,298 --> 01:21:33,957
Yeah.

662
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:42,136
We're almost there.

663
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:08,559
Lie back.

664
01:22:16,608 --> 01:22:23,878
You're my kind of guy... my hero.

665
01:22:26,451 --> 01:22:30,547
Not the kind of guy to wimp out.

666
01:22:36,127 --> 01:22:40,564
You know what it's like to have fun.

667
01:22:46,571 --> 01:22:49,699
You know how to let go
and fuck the rules.

668
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:00,180
You like things spontaneous

669
01:23:02,153 --> 01:23:09,855
with bite and real risks,
and I remember that.

670
01:23:14,866 --> 01:23:18,199
I thought you were crazy.

671
01:23:19,904 --> 01:23:26,104
But you opened my eyes,

672
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:34,043
you made me realize
we're not so different.

673
01:23:46,844 --> 01:23:47,344
there's ?

674
01:24:05,345 --> 01:24:06,845
No more talking !

675
01:24:20,546 --> 01:24:21,846
What the fuck ?

676
01:24:29,136 --> 01:24:33,800
One more word... and you lose the tongue.

677
01:24:38,779 --> 01:24:40,110
My turn.

678
01:24:42,183 --> 01:24:45,880
My turn to talk.

679
01:24:49,824 --> 01:24:58,357
Just talk. No worries. Scout's honor.

680
01:25:01,402 --> 01:25:06,601
I was gonna say what harm
can come from talking? Right?

681
01:25:08,175 --> 01:25:15,707
Like that night at the party.
I knew you.

682
01:25:18,953 --> 01:25:27,520
I let you talk and retalk and rephrase

683
01:25:28,195 --> 01:25:33,792
and ramble on and words,

684
01:25:35,303 --> 01:25:42,141
they kept piling up
and I couldn't see you anymore.

685
01:25:45,379 --> 01:25:56,881
I had a secret admirer.
Nervous, and eager to please.

686
01:26:01,429 --> 01:26:07,334
I kind of felt bad for being so harsh.

687
01:26:08,769 --> 01:26:11,363
You know, you being so open

688
01:26:11,505 --> 01:26:22,507
and straight up and me just a meanie,
calling you a tired, obvious liar.

689
01:26:26,887 --> 01:26:36,159
Isn't that funny?
Funny how words create ideas.

690
01:26:45,773 --> 01:26:50,210
Ideas are hard to shake it turns out.

691
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,028
You come up in dreams.

692
01:27:20,941 --> 01:27:24,104
Walking alone to
that restaurant, that night.

693
01:27:25,746 --> 01:27:27,213
That's where it always starts.

694
01:27:30,451 --> 01:27:34,979
I know I shouldn't but I'm excited,
and I'm kind of nervous.

695
01:27:35,122 --> 01:27:37,090
You know, it's a big,
fancy restaurant, and...

696
01:27:39,794 --> 01:27:43,491
So then we're sitting there,
across from each other.

697
01:27:44,098 --> 01:27:48,762
And it's a diner,
and we're talking and drinking.

698
01:27:50,905 --> 01:27:55,205
But this time, we dance.

699
01:27:56,043 --> 01:27:58,307
I mean, it's more like grind
on each other.

700
01:27:59,914 --> 01:28:00,972
And it's a club.

701
01:28:03,284 --> 01:28:08,779
And oh, am I on fire,
just swallowing that music whole,

702
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:18,531
and there you are...
just smooth...

703
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:25,571
real smooth and I can't believe
you're keeping up but you are

704
01:28:30,177 --> 01:28:40,644
and it's right then that I know
that you're the one, my forever...

705
01:28:42,156 --> 01:28:46,752
So we're playing pool, right,
and I am so going to beat you,

706
01:28:46,894 --> 01:28:52,491
I just know it and that makes me giddy

707
01:28:53,934 --> 01:28:58,132
because now I know
that you're the one I'd do anything for

708
01:29:01,942 --> 01:29:07,847
and that makes me vulnerable, you know, so,
so I need this...

709
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:09,916
...something on my side.

710
01:29:16,924 --> 01:29:18,289
And I win,

711
01:29:23,564 --> 01:29:28,092
and everybody's watching, thousands,

712
01:29:30,905 --> 01:29:38,004
and the applause just sweeps me up and,
and I look at you.

713
01:29:40,014 --> 01:29:46,476
I know I did wrong...and it's now
that I remember who you are.

714
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:50,951
The fog lifts.

715
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:59,257
And you take me right there
on the pool table.

716
01:30:02,002 --> 01:30:03,731
You know I knew not to struggle.

717
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:11,773
My eyes are closed

718
01:30:17,284 --> 01:30:20,583
but I can hear them gasp,

719
01:30:21,555 --> 01:30:26,015
some giggle as you...

720
01:30:41,475 --> 01:30:48,540
I need you. I need you, baby.

721
01:30:53,921 --> 01:30:55,013
It's okay.

722
01:30:58,259 --> 01:30:59,283
It's okay.

723
01:31:04,331 --> 01:31:05,457
It's okay.

724
01:31:08,903 --> 01:31:15,172
Shut the fuck up!
No one wants to hear from you!

725
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:22,280
Yeah. Yeah.

726
01:31:39,054 --> 01:31:42,581
Yeah, you like that bitch.

727
01:31:53,802 --> 01:31:55,269
I can't hear you.

728
01:32:02,278 --> 01:32:07,840
Mine now. You're mine, yeah.

729
01:32:17,922 --> 01:32:19,389
Oh yeah.

730
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:22,390
You fucking maggot.

731
01:32:23,191 --> 01:32:24,391
You fucking nothing.

732
01:32:41,759 --> 01:32:43,056
Take it all in.

733
01:32:51,169 --> 01:32:52,568
Yeah, you like that?

734
01:33:03,814 --> 01:33:04,838
Do you want me to keep going?

735
01:33:06,884 --> 01:33:08,408
Jared liking this?

736
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:18,693
Little Jared...
He knows what he likes.

737
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:25,864
Come on...
give it to me.

738
01:34:02,065 --> 01:34:03,265
Down way.

739
01:34:57,466 --> 01:34:59,666
Yes, help me.

740
01:35:11,467 --> 01:35:13,467
he's know how to wrong ?

741
01:35:16,968 --> 01:35:19,268
That's right.
That's it.

742
01:35:19,269 --> 01:35:20,269
Make me feel it.

743
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:23,570
Puta!

744
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:31,845
You like raping smart girls, huh?

745
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,388
Make them feel small and stupid.

746
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:37,789
Stupid fuck.

747
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:43,390
Who's streching you now ?

748
01:35:46,691 --> 01:35:48,691
Like that.
Love it.

749
01:35:55,693 --> 01:35:56,717
Take it off him...

750
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:59,594
Make him see his Daddy....

751
01:36:08,072 --> 01:36:09,369
Yeah, mira.

752
01:36:14,245 --> 01:36:17,180
Hello, fairy cake. Huh?

753
01:36:18,383 --> 01:36:22,444
Yeah, you never forget
your first one baby.

754
01:37:02,745 --> 01:37:04,345
Puta, you like it.

755
01:37:04,846 --> 01:37:07,246
You want me help you, don't you ?

756
01:37:10,447 --> 01:37:12,247
Sure ?

757
01:37:16,048 --> 01:37:17,648
Fuck you !

758
01:37:17,649 --> 01:37:18,649
I'm not a fucking fagget !

759
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,150
You're mine, maggot.

760
01:37:28,151 --> 01:37:29,151
Fully mine.

761
01:37:40,052 --> 01:37:41,552
Look at that

762
01:37:42,753 --> 01:37:43,653
She made a mate

763
01:37:43,754 --> 01:37:44,754
All over the stuff.

764
01:37:47,793 --> 01:37:50,762
You love it, hun? Hairy bitch.

765
01:37:51,964 --> 01:37:56,264
It's the sports, you see,
school ya all wrong...

766
01:37:58,771 --> 01:38:00,466
Teaches you to accept defeat.

767
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,771
I mean, look at you.

768
01:38:04,576 --> 01:38:06,237
Nobody accepts it better than you.

769
01:39:12,638 --> 01:39:15,138
Hey, you got water ?

770
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,539
I'm getting thirsty.

771
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:34,540
Everything's ok now, right ?

772
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:42,541
It's ok.

773
01:40:14,676 --> 01:40:20,642
I need to get over it.
I know it, and I will.

774
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,001
