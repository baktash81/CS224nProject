1
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,832
Without disturbing the light.

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,400
And attention... camera.

3
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,296
Running, alister.

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,863
- Alright, can we go?
- Yes.  - Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

5
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,343
Thank you for joining us.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,369
First you can tell me, what's your name?

7
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,285
= Pardeep Singh nagra.

8
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,748
Based on the true story
of pardeep Singh nagra.

9
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,976
And conditions are still good
here at title stadium.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,120
The weather was ominous
earlier, but it seems

11
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,814
that will continue good.

12
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,257
Yohansen, Finlay...
Finlay carries the ball.

13
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,059


14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,728
Johanson is doing
a great game.

15
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,988
Although these young people
share a dressing room

16
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,491
and expect to use the national
colors together in the future,

17
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,661
they are playing an
aggressive football match.

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,518
It's an exciting game of football.

19
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,922
With the Olympics
right there on the corner,

20
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,693
the call for this
national team could not

21
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,176
be more fierce.

22
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,804
Today is the last chance
for many of these young people

23
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,973
play by selection.

24
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,814
Pardeep nagra comes menacing...

25
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,882
passes through Wilson, for Mitchell,
but not for grodnik,

26
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,819
that enters from cart
and it takes the ball to him.

27
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,820
Come on, grodnik!

28
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,114
Normal Cart. Nagra complains with the judge,

29
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,098
but no luck, the game
moves on.

30
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,816
You bastard...

31
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,536
This is not good, that's bad and bad for the game.

32
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,931
These players expect to represent
their country, and nagra...

33
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,416
Well, nagra is out.
Red card.

34
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,044
Nagra has a long walk to the locker room.

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,439
This is the end of the tournament
for him, and I think

36
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,423
of selection chances as well.

37
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,427
Well, I hope his family can forgive him because,

38
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,863
with one less,

39
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,647
Your teammates,
sure, will not.

40
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,679
Then? Did you join the team?

41
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,473
Is this the Olympic hero of the family?

42
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,767
Do not leave us in suspense!

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,570
Ah, well, next time.

44
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,797
I'm going to make some tea.

45
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,157
- No, I do not want tea, chachi.
- Dont be silly.

46
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,744
Not surprising, I suppose.

47
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,763
- Did you watch the game?
- Clear.

48
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,789
Your temper is so uncontrollable...

49
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,183
It was unfair.

50
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,042
Oh, come on, "fair";
What is fair?

51
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,979
He almost took the
turban from my head,

52
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:13,896
What should I do?

53
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,256
He pushed you and cursed you.
And?

54
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,317
- Who are you, pardeep?
- I am american.

55
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,970
But you say you want to live the
Sikh lifestyle, right?

56
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,598
Like your father. He'd be embarrassed.

57
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,269
It's done! What do you guys want me to say?

58
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,908
It's... "The world is not against you, pardeep."

59
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,213
Damn!

60
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,893
Hi. My car just died.

61
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,146
- Hi.
- What?

62
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,899
I... I'm sorry, I did not know
that you were on the phone.

63
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,652
No, not you, I
I need a second.

64
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,074
Can I help?

65
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,243
I was about to
ask the same thing.

66
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,664
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thanks. "My husband is coming.

67
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,590
Alright, alright. Good luck.

68
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,721
Hey, sorry. Yes...

69
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,602
Wakefield Boxing Club.

70
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,987
Do not do this while I'm looking at the mirror.

71
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,323
This is not a place to play.
You understand me?

72
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,534
Are you listening? So pay attention to where you are.

73
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,917
What?

74
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,669
Or what?

75
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,130
"Or what?" Or I'll leave that fat lip.

76
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,715
Do you really?

77
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,470
Yes. You better get out.

78
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,348
Just take your dirty back
from here!

79
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,244
Hey, enough. What is going on?

80
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,996
This guy comes in here and
starts to fuck.

81
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,164
Get it out of here.

82
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,248
Hey!

83
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,333
Bye!

84
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,334
Hey, you, what's your problem?

85
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,734
Take your hand off me.

86
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,003
Bye!

87
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,798
You, shut up! "You, go away!"

88
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,740
Yes, I'm coming!
Do not worry!

89
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,411
Get back to work!

90
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,222
Hey!

91
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,975
- Hey! What's yours, Abdul?
- "Abdul!"

92
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,911
Hey, relax, man.

93
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,146
Now you want me to relax?

94
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,733
Why are you nervous?

95
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,119
Yeah, he's Durão, right?

96
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,764
Hey, stay there, easy.

97
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,832
You! You come with me.

98
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,852
- Doyle.
- It was not enough?

99
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,979
Doyle? Get out of here.

100
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,147
Come on, come on.

101
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,006
What are you doing, man?

102
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,842
Walking, ladies!

103
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,970
Do you think it's Durão? "Let's see if it is, right?"

104
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,547
Let's see what you can show.

105
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,368
Do you think you know how to punch?
Soca the bag.

106
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,552
I do not have time for this.

107
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,883
Let's see what you do, man.

108
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,647
Come on, tiger. Come on, let's see what he's capable of!

109
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,733
Let's see what you get!
Let's go!

110
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,044
Let's see what you know!

111
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,003
Do you want me to hit that bag?

112
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,504
Want to punch someone?

113
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,340
So let's go! Let's see what he's capable of.

114
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,300
I want to see what you have! "Show me what you're capable of.

115
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,384
I will not hit that bag!

116
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,785
Drop the left!

117
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,995
With the left, let's go there with both hands.

118
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,516
Release the anger. Let go of the anger, come on.

119
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,268
Beat. Knock, come on.

120
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,437
Is that all you have?

121
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,088
Give me some more. Come on.

122
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,941
It's okay. Here.

123
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,509
Release the left... come on.

124
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,944
Come on!

125
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,654
That's it, continue.

126
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,114
Come on, punch! That.

127
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,657
Get out of my way.

128
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:00,642
Get out of my way.

129
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,400
Go home. Already
I have seen enough.

130
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,951
- Come back tomorrow?
- For what?

131
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,373
Tell me you... tiger.

132
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,752
Since when do you watch boxing?

133
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,089
There's nothing cool on TV.

134
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,717
What are you still doing standing up?

135
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,218
I can not sleep.

136
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,181
You know... chachi and I
we love you very much.

137
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,769
When we say things, it's only out of love.

138
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,103
I know.

139
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,291
We feel responsible
for you now that

140
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,108
His family returned to India.

141
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,069
Uncle... I understand.

142
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,738
Good.

143
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,788
I'm sorry you did not
have entered the team.

144
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,083
Maybe it was not his destiny.

145
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,882
Maybe.

146
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,354
Can you tell me a little
about your past,

147
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,094
Before you start in boxing?

148
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,617
Sikh home... I lived with my parents...

149
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,618
Are your parents...?

150
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,882
They went back to India
when I started college,

151
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,165
And now I live with my aunt and uncle.

152
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:16,152
I studied here, and played a lot of soccer while growing up.

153
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:20,239
I think you did not give it to me because of the mistakes I made,

154
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,869
and you have to deal with
your own mistakes,

155
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,557
and I'm doing it,
so I did not succeed

156
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,209
in football because of me,
because of my temperament.

157
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,441
Hey, Frank taking another underdog?

158
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,836
What are you doing here?

159
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,672
Look, man, I'm not here to cause anything, right?

160
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,006
The man from yesterday told me to come back here.

161
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,031
What man?

162
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,097
I do not know, I think
that he is the owner?

163
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,034
When?

164
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,871
Last night when he dragged me here.

165
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,297
It's okay.

166
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,775
Hey, what time does he usually...

167
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,985
Look, listen, I'll be direct,

168
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,689
but I'm not here to make new friends.

169
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,264
Then sit there until your
man appears. Beauty?

170
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,967
Hey.

171
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,802
What are you doing here?

172
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,513
Wait, you told me to come.

173
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,685
Go change, boy.

174
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,398
It's okay.

175
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,577
Right, what now?

176
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,205
Exercise to warm up.

177
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,757
- Bandage your hands. "I do not know how."

178
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,343
Just bandage your hands.

179
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,937
And between each finger, like that.

180
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,777
Stay closer to the center, come on.

181
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,281
Left. Drop to your left.

182
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,035
And throw one foot after the other
forward, so do it.

183
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,871
It's like this, now a combination.

184
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,892
Two with the left.

185
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,810
Left again.

186
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,795
Release the left, come on,
left, release, go.

187
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,923
Beat, strip, and hit,
short and fast.

188
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,652
Beat, strip and hit, hit,
strip and hit, come on.

189
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,678
Wait, look. You can not wear your feet that way.

190
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,683
You have to use your heels,
you stay on the tip of your feet,

191
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,435
you need to be
able to jump,

192
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,729
You have to wear your
shoulder for defense.

193
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,649
Alright, you go with the
left, hit and turn,

194
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,360
Just relax, feel the
blow flow, right?

195
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:48,364
Move away, rock your body,
back and let it flow, okay?

196
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,617
Downstairs, okay?
Downstairs, upstairs,

197
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,453
Then hit here and then here.

198
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,956
Bum, go, head...
Head, body, head.

199
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,334
And if you protect yourself, if you dodge, do you understand?

200
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,652
It does so. Knock and
back, hit and back,

201
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,196
Take the guy here, and here, mark the step, and hit and turn,

202
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,681
Lean, leave the side, leave
that side to the guy, like this.

203
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,476
Easy, one, two, three, let's go.

204
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,787
That knocks and comes back.

205
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,515
Left twice, hits,
back, hits and returns.

206
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,400
Hit and back. Left, that.

207
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,924
Nagra, enters the ring.

208
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,950
- Barry, get out.
- Doyle is tired. I fight.

209
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,619
No, I'm fine! I am fine.

210
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,620
I want to have some fun.

211
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,354
- Take out the protection.
- Are you sure?

212
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,806
Absolutely sure, let's do this.

213
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,820
Maybe it will fit if you take that towel off your head.

214
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,911
It's a turban, idiot.

215
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,832
I go without, alright.

216
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,166
The funeral is yours.

217
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,877
Okay. You're not going to hit me at all.

218
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,923
Ready for this?

219
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,177
Let's see what you have?

220
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,389
Until it does. "Thank you, come back again!"

221
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,480
Give straight punches, hit and turn.

222
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,275
Below.

223
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,906
Come, hit me, go, hit!

224
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,993
Seriousness.

225
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,593
Is everything alright? Let's go!

226
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,597
Let's see what you have!

227
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,771
Brave now, right? Comes.

228
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,000
Control the rhythm, tiger.

229
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:10,959
Come.

230
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:11,983
Come on... left.

231
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,496
That's the way it is.

232
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,322
Get off of me! Get out of me.

233
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,585
To.

234
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,837
Hey, everyone! For!

235
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,882
Hey, what kind of shit are you doing?

236
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,306
Are you still bleeding?

237
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,434
Well, we learned two things.

238
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,604
You have no attack, no defense, and you are a bleeder.

239
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,731
Without this, I won, did not I?

240
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,794
Call whatever you want.

241
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,070
He called my cloth turp, what should I do?

242
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,824
I would not take it personally,
he does not have much brain.

243
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,536
So, ready to go?

244
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,665
What are you talking about? "For a fight?"

245
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,993
Are you ready to fight?

246
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,268
Yes... of course I'm ready.

247
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,353
How ready are you?

248
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,521
I am one hundred percent ready.

249
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,797
One hundred percent ready?
You want to fight?

250
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,757
Yes.

251
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,343
Do you want to be good?

252
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,178
I want to be the best!

253
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,626
Understanding Parkinson's disease.

254
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,218
Dopamine agonists are used

255
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,262
at all stages
of Parkinson's.

256
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,102
How do you feel?

257
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,854
Nervous...

258
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,023
I want you to stay focused.

259
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,500
Fight your fight, right?

260
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,627
You play the left,
make a combination,

261
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,987
I want you to finish
with the left. Do not back off.

262
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,198
Walk sideways, okay?

263
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,286
Any last minute advice?

264
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,580
Beat him more than he does in you.

265
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,417
Just breathe...

266
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,003
Come on.

267
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,604
Up and down.

268
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,026
Singing! Score! Corner!

269
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,074
Ready? Right. Fight!

270
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,055
Down, up. Knock

271
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,581
Up, down, come on.

272
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,609
You're good, you're better than this guy, you're better.

273
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,135
He is tall, he has a high
guard, keep hitting the body!

274
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,947
Take a deep breath. Hold on.

275
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:27,906
I can not.

276
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,850
Take a deep breath,
relax, breathe again!

277
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,912
Beat in body, in body, when
it bend, hit it in the nose!

278
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,188
Well, do not fight his fight, fight your fight.

279
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,291
Leave this guy angry,
he's a bleeder,

280
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,626
he is a bleeder,
you have the power!

281
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,943
Breathe!

282
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,620
Beat in the body! On body!

283
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,513
Hold on, tiger! "You'll get over it!"

284
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,606
No! Breathe, tiger!

285
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,608
The guard is open!

286
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,879
- Are you okay?
- I am.

287
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,947
Is everything alright? Can you go? Right.

288
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,327
Winner by unanimous decision,
Jonathan "revolver" blazer!

289
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,793
I'm sorry, coach.

290
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,480
What did you expect?

291
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,131
You have the left hand,
have to use.

292
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,278
You fight with anger, it's
what will happen,

293
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,072
You will lose. I feel
that I am repeating myself,

294
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,158
it's like standing around
pissing in the wind,

295
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,742
Better get someone else to work on your fucking Corner.

296
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,857
Be in the ring, fight...

297
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,194
It's something you can not
describe to people.

298
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,196
It's something I've always loved.

299
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,281
I mean, I didn \ 't know I loved it until

300
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,825
Really get into the
ring for the first time.

301
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,038
When I test my limits...
I challenge myself.

302
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,541
That makes me a better person
inside the ring and out of the ring.

303
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:23,813
And clause 7.1.3 states that

304
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,358
"boxers with the following
conditions are not allowed

305
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,860
to enter any event
approved by abc".

306
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,644
Ian, I am the chief commissioner.
I know the book,

307
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,905
No need to quote the rule.

308
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,240
"Whiskers or beards
are forbidden.

309
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,492
= Any length of
by facial should be..."

310
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,494
I understood. But I do not know what's yours.

311
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,995
Your face has won, has not it?

312
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,954
He crushed it.

313
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,647
So what's your reasoning?

314
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,692
Rules are rules, Carl. "I did not write them.

315
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,153
Right. Look, I'm going to investigate this.

316
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,742
Was the Sikh boy really good?

317
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,828
It could be.

318
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,603
- Hello! "I'm Frank."

319
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:08,298
Of course. Simran. Please come in. Pardeep!

320
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,888
Sit down. I'll make a cup of tea.

321
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,642
All right, I'm not much tea drinker.

322
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,728
Do not be silly!

323
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,747
Hey, Coach, what's happening?

324
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,709
- This is my uncle, kulwant.
- Hello! Welcome.

325
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,793
Frank.

326
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,795
So you're the man responsible for it?

327
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,698
- How did the other guy stay?
- Worse.

328
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,494
He told me, but
I did not believe it.

329
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,580
Very well, pardeep.

330
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,167
We have some problems that we need to discuss.

331
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,377
What is it?

332
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,629
Tea.

333
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,340
A abc, they do not want you to fight.

334
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,135
Why?

335
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,220
What is abc?

336
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,974
It's American boxing
commission...

337
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,060
What does it say?

338
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,189
They want me to
shave my beard.

339
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,401
- Why?
- Concerns about health.

340
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:10,902
Can they do this?

341
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,865
Well, how can they expect me to do it?

342
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:19,453
I have a good girl, and she
will do the best I can.

343
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,099
Who will pay for it?

344
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,625
It's okay, we're taking care of it.

345
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,628
Give me a second.

346
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,674
I do not know what you're doing, but...

347
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:37,763
pardeep's attitude improved.
Thank you.

348
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,559
Right, come on. Lets do this.

349
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,330
Community Legal Advice

350
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,123
and after a few
comings and goings,

351
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,833
the committee agreed
with a hearing.

352
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,257
You will expose your case, Mr.
Nagra.

353
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,360
Pardeep.

354
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,029
So, in your opinion, what are our chances?

355
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,549
Well, I do not like
to make predictions, but

356
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,677
If you pressed me,
I would say 50/50.

357
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,120
Ultimately, the decision
depends on the commission.

358
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,724
How good a speaker are you, pardeep?

359
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,375
Do I know you from somewhere?

360
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,504
I do not think so.

361
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,339
You look very familiar.

362
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,859
Maybe I look like someone you know.

363
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,177
- Have you ever played football?
- No.

364
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,931
"Look, kid, I do not think so," then stop freaking her out.

365
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,102
We do not have all day here, so
Charlotte, please continue.

366
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,398
It's okay. You know there's a way to fix it.

367
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,693
- And what is it?
- Do what they ask.

368
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,655
- I can not.
- Because?

369
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,716
It's tradition.

370
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,635
But abc will argue
what is their tradition

371
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,899
The fighters should shave.

372
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,663
I am a Sikh, this is our tradition.

373
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,975
Not all Sikhs follow the tradition.

374
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,168
Well, look, this is about me, who I am. This is my right!

375
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,548
Of course it is. Any question?

376
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,050
I think we're fine for now.

377
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,153
Okay, well, send me an email
tonight and I'll tell you

378
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,138
what to prepare.

379
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,051
And, as I said before...

380
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,137
And, as I said
before, this advice

381
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,639
applied the rules and
regulations of our committee

382
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,512
to the highest international standards,

383
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:29,934
and we are proud of it.

384
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,078
We hear your argument,

385
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,170
The enclosure now belongs to Mr.
Nagra.

386
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,058
Hello.

387
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,288
First, I would like to thank the esteemed commission

388
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,105
for taking the time to listen to this case.

389
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,901
Now, it is not my intention
to rewrite the rules and regulations

390
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,737
by any means, but
try to adapt them

391
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,948
to modern times.

392
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:05,327
Now, having said that, I would like to ask the commission

393
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,513
Grant me an exception,
in the light of my visions

394
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,707
and religious beliefs. Thank you.

395
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,583
Mr. Nagra.

396
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,316
ABC is dedicated to
guarantee security

397
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,591
of the fighters in the ring.

398
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,595
Rules have nothing
to do with the times,

399
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,098
but with the safety of the fighters.

400
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,809
The safety of fighters? "In what sense, sir?"

401
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,622
Your beard can hide cuts,
wounds and deep lacerations,

402
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,731
They would need the attention of the medical staff.

403
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,293
Now, if they can not
find these wounds,

404
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:41,071
this can be a problem. You have the
blood loss, maybe even...

405
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,216
What about the professional boxers?

406
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,409
I mean, they wear beards and it's okay.

407
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,886
Not as thick as yours, Mr.
Nagra.

408
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,056
So, what about the eyebrows,

409
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,266
would they not have the same risk?

410
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,558
Let's try to be serious here.

411
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,685
I'm serious!

412
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,853
Look, I have in this
desk pages and pages

413
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,897
of the last boxing matches in North America.

414
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,024
Never in a fight,
amateur or professional,

415
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,610
the beard was the cause of
any kind of injury!

416
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,029
There are two hundred years of history
that prove this, two hundred!

417
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,698
- It is practically impossible.
- Pardeep.

418
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,241
Wait, let me finish!

419
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,625
Let's open our eyes and see the whole picture in front of us!

420
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,996
Obviously, there are other
reasons at stake, and not

421
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,039
the imposition of useless regulations...

422
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,082
Thank you, Mr. Nagra...

423
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,417
You are not a
jury of my race!

424
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,085
- This is outrageous...
- No, this is scandalous!

425
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,278
This is not a trial!

426
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,532
This meeting is postponed.

427
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,178
If you talk again
outside of what we rehearse,

428
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,097
You can find another
lawyer, understood?

429
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,040
- Look, I was trying...
- Understood?

430
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,226
Look, I admire this fire.

431
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,970
But just punching wildly
will not get us anywhere.

432
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,571
And I'm very hopeful
that we will win this.

433
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,114
I have great support from my family,

434
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,265
support from my lawyers.

435
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,577
At the end of the day I am
only an American Sikh

436
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,537
proud you want to shine a
light on my culture,

437
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,189
but also remains a
patriot of the world's largest country.

438
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,393
I do not think these two
things are incompatible.

439
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,818
Thank you.

440
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,214
Was this the last one?

441
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,300
Yes, it was. You did well.

442
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,077
Thank you. I'll be right back, okay?

443
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,707
You did very well.

444
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,159
Do you need anything?

445
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,911
Can we talk, please?

446
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,420
- Not now.
- When?

447
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,047
I'm working, Brian.

448
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,299
I know, but...

449
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,110
Hello?

450
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,096
- How was it?
- Not good.

451
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,116
Pardeep has passion, but he does not know when to stop.

452
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,642
It's really his style.

453
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,104
And Brian is here,
to make things worse.

454
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,525
Let me talk to him.

455
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,155
Yes?

456
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,480
What are you doing, Brian?

457
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,339
I came to support my
teammate.

458
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,703
You want to go to the
olympics, right?

459
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,140
Yes.

460
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,850
So why do not you
bring your back back

461
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,060
To the gym, start working on your hook,

462
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,084
body, head, body?

463
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,097
Brian is such an idiot.

464
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,724
It does not matter. But what is Roland?

465
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,186
It's a long and tiring story.

466
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,625
I've been fighting boxing already
for quite a while now,

467
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,776
and I am very hopeful
of what we will win.

468
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,195
- What is happening?
- Not much.

469
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,966
I have the support of my family, my lawyers.

470
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,301
Look, in the end I am
only a proud American Sikh

471
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,096
who wants to shine a light on
my culture, but also

472
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,914
continues to be a patriot
of the largest country in the world.

473
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,101
Is this the reason why none of you are training?

474
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,228
These two things are not
incompatible. Thank you.

475
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,981
Pardeep nagra has confirmed that,
if they appeal to abc,

476
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,149
they will...

477
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,316
Hey, what are you doing?

478
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,484
What am I doing?

479
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,819
This has been creeping
a week ago,

480
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,720
It's the same shit every day. "Get real!"

481
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,312
Maybe they want to support a teammate.

482
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,684
Oh, so now are we all a team?

483
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,853
Yes, that's funny.

484
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,123
Because in the last two
months, the only guy that you

485
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,982
They were supporting is the nagra.

486
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,463
That's all we're doing, huh?

487
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,363
And is not it? They're all saying.

488
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,907
Right.

489
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Is not it?

490
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,627
Okay, what are you going to do?

491
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,453
Yes, well, I think
this proves it

492
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:27,032
How much of a team do we really are.

493
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,695
Listen, if you want to
talk about it,

494
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:30,234
Why do not we get into my office?

495
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,402
No.  Let's talk here, right here.

496
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,696
I do not do anything but
work hard in this gym,

497
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,073
and for what, huh? For a trainer - idiot tell me how to act?

498
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,868
How is it?

499
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:39,785
As long as the only reason for
he is doing it

500
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,912
is for a minute of fame.

501
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:41,829
Listen, you brat, choose your
words wisely, okay?

502
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,624
Oh, yes, but what?

503
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,066
"Or I'm going to bust your fucking ass."

504
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,085
Break my ass? "You're tough, are not you?"

505
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,837


506
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,922
And you are what?

507
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,798
I am the only reason why
this academy is still here.

508
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,823
It's a pigsty.

509
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,992
Oh, go to hell!

510
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,470
Just like the owner.

511
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,787
Hit the fucking door.

512
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,664
I am commanding myself.

513
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,517
Staying here will not help me in anything!

514
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,476
I'm fucking.

515
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,686
Who stays here has no future.

516
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,772
I'll see your
boy in the ring.

517
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,796
Is it?

518
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,051
Anyone else?

519
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,527
You're in, big one.

520
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,756
Tell me about Frank Donovan,

521
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,758
Because you trained with him
for a while, did not you?

522
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,717
Yes?

523
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,636
And you do not... you're not with him anymore...

524
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,370
No, I'm not with her anymore, no.

525
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,289
He does not measure up to my standards.

526
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,684
But what interests me
is that pardeep nagra

527
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:48,086
came to your gym shortly before
of you decide to leave Wakefield.

528
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,339
- Is there a connection?
- Of course not.

529
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,026
Absolutely not,
there is no connection.

530
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,170
He is not tied to me. "I'm not tied to him.

531
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,722
Are we done here?

532
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,523
What is happening?
You did it?

533
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,651
We need all the help we can get.

534
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,737
No comments...

535
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,947
We will talk to you after the hearing.
Thanks.

536
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:19,659
Mr. Nagra, you presented
a convincing case

537
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,680
and caught our attention
for a regulation that is

538
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,391
an obstacle to your aspirations as a fighter,

539
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,000
and thanks for that.

540
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,796
The laws and regulations of abc

541
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,859
they form the very structure of who and what we are.

542
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:39,780
Removing any law, on a whim,
could have consequences

543
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,348
terrible in this
structure as a whole.

544
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:45,226
So yesterday, the commission
reached a verdict:

545
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,523
Twelve out of a total of fifteen
voters voted to hold

546
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,069
unchanged the applicable regulations
, denying your request.

547
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,698
This ends this hearing.
Thank you.

548
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,289
This is not over.

549
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,531
Thank you for your attention during this case.

550
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,241
A human rights complaint
against abc's verdict

551
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,065
will be filed within one hour.
Thanks.

552
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,372
Why?

553
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,165
Because you do not belong here!

554
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,710
Get out of here! Go away...

555
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,628
Shit! What are they doing?

556
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,424
Being arrested will not take
pardeep to the regional stage.

557
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,010
- Did you register the complaint?
- Clear.

558
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,681
Where is the tiger?

559
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,142
He's at the club, he said he had something to do.

560
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,395
The boy has potential. "He could be good."

561
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,440
I love seeing you like this.

562
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,235
- In jail?
- Passional.

563
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,088
He does it to you, does not he?

564
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,673
- It looks familiar...
- what?

565
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,857
No, I just want to say that - he's a real fighter.

566
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,802
Yes, well, the last fighter - with whom he had a case

567
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,370
You could have kicked his *** from him a lot earlier, you know?

568
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,348
It took me a while
to realize that Brian

569
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,498
He was a complete idiot.

570
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,292
Listen, Charlotte...

571
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,090
Goodbye, bhatije.

572
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:40,484
Hi.

573
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,051
Hey, it's me. How are you?

574
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,180
Yeah, I'm fine, just counting the hours, you know? Waiting.

575
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,474
Look, the court will give a decision soon enough.

576
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,119
Keep training, we'll - take you to the regional ones.

577
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,143
Thanks, Charlotte.

578
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,897
Hey boy, go back to training.

579
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,527
It was already for her to be here.

580
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,758
You waited a week, you can wait another few minutes.

581
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,969
Hey, how many times have I told you not to read this thing?

582
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,787
Look, I'm
destroying the sport.

583
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,163
Rip this off.

584
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,793
Right, tell me.

585
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:19,464
- Good news or bad news?
- Good news.

586
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,567
The good news is that Frank
needs you both to stay

587
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,277
late tonight and
help to tow the walls.

588
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,278
Damn.

589
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,637
Right, bad news.

590
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,740
The bad news is that you
have to get in shape

591
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,225
because we have won the
human rights claim.

592
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,203
- I do not believe it.
- We won!

593
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,662
Will fight in the regional!

594
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,789
Are you kidding?

595
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,666
There are six fights in 48 hours!
Are you ready for this?

596
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,400
I'm ready, man.
I'm ready!

597
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,611
You will do well.

598
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,488
Thank you.

599
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,449

hits and back,
left twice.

606
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,086
Go boy. On top of him.

607
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,028
Get out of the hug. Let's go.

608
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,492
Come on!

609
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,264
Are you okay? Fight.

610
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,467
After winning six consecutive fights, the winner,

611
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:14,579
by unanimous decision, the
new regional champion,

612
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:19,792
pardeep "the tiger" nagra!

613
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,873
Come home, terrorist!

614
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,207
You are in America now!

615
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,942
Get out of here, towel head!

616
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,765
What the hell was that?

617
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,149
First the asshole tries to
cut my beard, now this?

618
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,460
I was born in this country, I do not understand!

619
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,899
I do not want to be that guy who
spoils the sport he loves,

620
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,163
or spoil for you or the other
fighters in Wakefield!

621
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,427
I do not want to assume
this responsibility!

622
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,919
And if you think I should give up,
tell me to give up!

623
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,521
Come on! "Tell me to give up, coach!"

624
00:41:17,547 --> 00:41:18,668
Tell me to give up!

625
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:23,106
Do you want to get away?
Do you want to give up?

626
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,775
Be a quitter.
Go home.

627
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,422
No, it is not fair.

628
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,740
Look, kid, nobody
said it was fair.

629
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:36,619
You will not change them. What a fucking mess of people!

630
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,683
You just showed them to
, they proved it to them,

631
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,291
proved to himself.

632
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,003
It's your time to do
the hard work,

633
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,296
It's your goddamn time, right?

634
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,424
That's all you need to do.

635
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,967
But it's your life.

636
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,221
You've fought quite a fight,
congratulations on the good fight.

637
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:03,646
I do not think many people
understood where I came from...

638
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,876
And they did not understand
the Sikh religion,

639
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,254
did not understand what it is.

640
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,864
But if you take my dream for
cause of a turban and beard,

641
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,633
then you simply...

642
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,325
That, I think it's totally wrong,

643
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,872
and that's what I wanted to convey to everyone.

644
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:51,110
Coach... Coach!

645
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,613
It's like an addiction, you know?

646
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,408


647
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,079


648
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,914


649
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,000


650
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,962


651
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:13,341


652
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,218


653
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,279


654
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,514


655
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,307


656
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,435


657
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,354
Then there is this burning fire

658
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,831
And there are people in your
Corner that push you.

659
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,626
It feels good because
you know you sweat

660
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,778
And did the right thing,
and it was a good night.

661
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,614
If I could have had
more of those nights,

662
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,366
If I could...

663
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,910
Could have just listened
and heard what someone

664
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:45,039
Was telling me, because
I have nothing now.

665
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,834
I had... what the fuck!

666
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:56,551
I threw it all away, you know, I had a family.

667
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,390
I had a wife...

668
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,562
Now I can not remember
if I rode a bicycle,

669
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,314
Picked up a bus or drove a car to work.

670
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,627
I fought a few years to
more than I should,

671
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,963
But, man, I had a reason for that.

672
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,615
Everyone has to have a reason to fight, so...

673
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,076
Why did you come back?

674
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,705
I want to box.

675
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:30,126
Everyone wants to box, but
why do you want to fight?

676
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,504
Because I love.

677
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,299
Yes, it feels good when
you love something like that, yes...

678
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,320
Well, you have to do something for me, okay?

679
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,573
You have to do something
that I could not do.

680
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:45,284
There is only one way you are

681
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,684
something there.

682
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:54,358
You have to... you have to Love yourself.

683
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:59,047
Got it? You have to love yourself,

684
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,966
You can not do what
it takes to get there.

685
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,801
You have to have discipline.

686
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,994
You have to listen to what someone is saying.

687
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,513
You have to train hard,

688
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,789
You have to give yourself more than the rest.

689
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:14,754
And to do this... You
need to Love yourself.

690
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,715
Can you do that?

691
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:22,345
I will do this... I will.

692
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,227
"The Sikh winner".
I love it.

693
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,665
The first of the thirty covers
that did not detonate to me.

694
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,542
Regardless, your story is being told,

695
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,984
then this is good.

696
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,924
- You look so serious!
- I know. Do not look...

697
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:42,948
Right.

698
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,954
So... what do you need me to do?

699
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,457
I just need
some signatures

700
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,418
before you go to the
national combat, then...

701
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,087
I could have gone to the office.

702
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,006
Well, I was in the area...

703
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,217
There, there and there.

704
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,513
Use my back.

705
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,769
And what are these signatures for?

706
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,039
Well, if the court appeals and
we need an injunction,

707
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,898
your documentation is ready.

708
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,486
Here it is.

709
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:22,947
Great, thank you.

710
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,368
- Do you have everything you need?
- Yes I have.

711
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,245
That should solve.

712
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,726
Right then, I have to go...

713
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,812
Yes, thank you.

714
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,796
I'll see you when I get back.
- Yes.  Are you going where?

715
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,427
My temple.

716
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,429
Can I go?

717
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,140
Yes.

718
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,146
We take our shoes off to show respect.

719
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,696
So we wash our
hands before entering.

720
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,333
It's kind of a way to show cleanliness.

721
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,336


722
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,308
When I was a child, I wanted to be like everyone else.

723
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:18,104
But being a Sikh,
this is impossible.

724
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:23,025
I became competitive
and used to fight a lot.

725
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,045
What now?

726
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,362
Now I fight a lot.

727
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,741
But being a Sikh,

728
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,577
Should not you solve problems without causing damage?

729
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,372
You did your homework.

730
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:40,084
I filed a human rights complaint.

731
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,586
Yes, it is true.

732
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:48,134
Look, I'm not saying that
I'm the best Sikh in the world,

733
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,720
but I try, I
really try.

734
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,222
I know.

735
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,743
I do not know, maybe it is
being very passionate,

736
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,602
thinking too much.

737
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,145
You are passionate.

738
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,189
Some people say
that I feel just anger.

739
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,903
You do not remember, do you?

740
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,157
Remembering what?

741
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,327
That night, when
your car did not pick up

742
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:16,954
I went to help you.

743
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,765
It was at the door of the boxing academy.

744
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,457
And you were very scared!

745
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,542
Was it you?

746
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:25,296
Yes, I... I told you that
I have a good memory.

747
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,048
Oh, my God, this is bizarre.

748
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,595
If you were not there that night...

749
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,723
I would never have
entered the gym.

750
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,477
You really made this
journey happen to me.

751
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,623
Good luck on the nationals, tiger.

752
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,828
- And there, man? "Brian?"

753
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,145
Yes, Brian...

754
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,875
Stay away from my girl.
- Shit!

755
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,793
You do not enter my
academy, my home,

756
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,444
And slowly gets me out of the move!

757
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,132
What are you talking about?

758
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,675
You love all this, do not you?

759
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,386
Your face in the newspaper, your
hashtags on Twitter?

760
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,888
You're the big man now, huh?

761
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,598
Do you think I'm fighting for fame?

762
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,475
I do not give a shit about this shit, man!

763
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,751
Find a new lawyer.

764
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,836
Look at me, find a new lawyer.

765
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,565
Or you'd better pray for whom you pray

766
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,050
So I will not be your first fight tomorrow.

767
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,448
- Name?
- Pardeep Singh nagra.

768
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,346
It looks like I can not
find you on the list.

769
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,841
It has to be there.

770
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:35,926
Is there a problem?

771
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,847
Ah, Mr. Nagra, you created
a great commotion.

772
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,516
Look, I just want to fight.

773
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:47,271
Yes... well, we're just waiting for the final paperwork.

774
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,401
The final paperwork?

775
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,546
Everything is in order,
for what I know...

776
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,506
Why do not you just sit with the others even grief.

777
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,531
Are you okay?

778
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,340
So they let you fight?

779
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,051
There is no reason to stop me.

780
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,987
No one likes change.

781
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,072
For me, it does not really matter
the appearance of a fighter,

782
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,556
A beard will not knock me over.

783
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,353
Brian Doyle.

784
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,891
Now he's the one to hit
in his weight category.

785
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,192
Do you know him?

786
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,404
Old friend.

787
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,622
O'brien. They what?

788
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,334
On national day?
They can not...

789
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:54,880
Thank you. Motherfucker.

790
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,478
Attention, please.

791
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,775
This is to remind everyone that
no facial hair is allowed.

792
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,194
Anyone with facial hair
will need to remove them

793
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,255
before entering.

794
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:22,491
Shaving blades or
scissors will be provided

795
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:26,370
for use in the next locker room.
Thank you.

796
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,247
I'm sorry, brother.

797
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:35,921
Excuse me? Really? "That sucks."

798
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,317
abc appealed the decision of the
human rights court.

799
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,219
On national day, so I do not have time to fight, right?

800
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,555
Dude, I misjudged you.

801
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,099
You are even more
spiteful than I thought!

802
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,228
Until a resolution is taken,
you will have to shave.

803
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,441
Rules are rules.

804
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,071
What do you expect me to do with it?

805
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:03,615
Build a bridge with it.

806
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,577
Yes, build this.

807
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,750
I'd be wary if
were you, boy!

808
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,689
Pardeep.

809
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,774
- They disqualified me!
- What?

810
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,509
- abc appealed.
- Yes, I also heard this, I just...

811
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,070
They can not disqualify you.

812
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,513
I'm going to court
now with the injunction signed.

813
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,182
How long will this take?

814
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,129
With luck, it will not take too long.

815
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,228
Look, it'll be all
well, go to the hotel,

816
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:35,355
Rest and concentrate
on your breath.

817
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:41,296
Okay, can I ask you something?

818
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,363
Yes, ask. Taxi!

819
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,450
- Are you seeing anyone? "I'm sorry, what did you say?"

820
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,136
No, it's okay, just...

821
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,120
- Let me know what to do, right? "Yes, I warn you."

822
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,246
Yes?

823
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,619
We got it! It's signed.

824
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,767
What?

825
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,417
Go weigh, they can not
stop it.

826
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:39,711
Wait, are you sure?
I can go?

827
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,797
We won, pardeep! We won.

828
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,800
I have twenty-two
minutes to weigh!

829
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:46,903
Call security...

830
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,971
Call the abc, the court
signed the injunction.

831
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,682
It's what we'll see.

832
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:04,889
Can I have your attention, please?

833
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:11,469
After a long discussion
and deliberation, abc

834
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,913
decided to cancel the entire class
of average weight this year.

835
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,832
Are you serious?

836
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:21,044
We are all shocked and disappointed.

837
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,566
I am very sorry for the unfortunate
events that led

838
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,258
to this decision.

839
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,136
Many of you know the strenuous circumstances.

840
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,180
Our hands were tied.

841
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,852
You are cowards! You're all cowards!

842
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,937
And you? Especially you...

843
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,817
You are... take your... Doyle!

844
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:48,506
Nobody wants to see a
guy as I fight!

845
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,799
That's what's happening, right?

846
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,075
When there are more people in front of you...

847
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,204
- I have the right to fight.
- U.S. too!

848
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,998
Take it away!

849
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,003
What are you going to do? I'm sick of you, man!

850
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:04,421
Doyle! For! Calm down! Enough!

851
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,248
Come on!

852
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,421
Cut! Go!

853
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,427
Cut your beard, you fucking piece of shit!
Cut!

854
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,891
You are a great shit. "Great shit!"

855
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:04,815
Cut a beard! Courage!
Cut off that beard!

856
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,662
Hey.

857
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,542
I thought I had said
that we won the injunction.

858
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,545
Hi to you too...

859
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:35,178
- Did we win the cause?
- Yes.  So how could I cancel
my entire weight class?

860
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,515
They can do whatever they want.

861
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,894
Look, calm down, it's good for us,
this takes your case forward.

862
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,790
Do you think this is good for us?

863
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:47,482


864
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:50,193
I am the sole responsible
for all boxers

865
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,762
who lost a
chance in the selection.

866
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,030
You are not.

867
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,906
Do you know what happened?

868
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,660
Well, I know you
assaulted a member of abc.

869
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,081
You're lucky not to
have complained!

870
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,423
I'm sorry.

871
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:17,929
I do not want to cause any
problem between you and Doyle.

872
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:23,202
I do not know what Brian told you, but I finished.

873
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,811
He did not have to tell me anything.

874
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,856
Girls like you do not know
fall in love with guys like me.

875
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,006
You know, I came here tonight
because I wanted to tell my father

876
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,533
How much I respected you. And my feelings for you.

877
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,622
Your father...

878
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,499
Hey, Tiger, they screwed you up.

879
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,796
- I was going to tell you... - When?

880
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:57,844
So, what's happening here?

881
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:04,059
Your daughter was saying
abc can do whatever you want!

882
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,106
Oh, yes, this is my daughter,
I forgot to introduce you.

883
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,902
Did Parkinson give you memory loss too?

884
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,113
What?

885
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,119
Father...

886
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,955
What do you know?

887
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,585
What do you know?

888
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,464
- Nothing. "That's right, nothing.

889
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,903
- I'm fine. "Dad, I'm sorry.

890
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,638
Hey, I'm fine, okay?

891
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,390
We can go.

892
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,481
I'm sorry, I thought...

893
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,483
you knew.

894
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,837
- Hello.
- Hey, chacha.

895
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:16,173
- What are you doing?
- Reading.

896
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,361
Oh, very good...
Mainu baith sakada?

897
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,928
Yes, of course.

898
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,903
Have you been drinking?

899
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,616
Chacha can not be proud of his nephew?

900
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,326
For what?

901
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,957
Your story is everywhere.

902
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,378
Today, Chachi received a call from his mother.

903
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,632
They are all
cheering for you.

904
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,096
Did Mom and Dad hear about it in India?

905
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,725
Your face is everywhere.

906
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:11,978
They call you
_ punjab tiger.

907
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,939
You are like a hero.

908
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,191
Yeah, well, I do not feel like a hero to me.

909
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:21,529
Well, you are a hero. The whole world knows you.

910
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:24,491
"Punjab Tiger!"

911
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,789
What I call the
imposing nickname, huh?

912
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:41,174
You know, pardeep, you have the strength

913
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,804
that I was not your age.

914
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:54,598
I could not remain faithful to
myself or our tradition.

915
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:59,734
With chachi coming from
India, I felt...

916
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:06,283
I felt I had to adapt

917
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,327
to the environment of this world.

918
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,707
To integrate.

919
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,634
Feeding the family.

920
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,513
But you...

921
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:35,979
My warrior, you
chose to fight!

922
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:40,984
Fighting for the rights
of all Sikhs!

923
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:46,114
I've never been more proud of you in my entire life

924
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,658
than in recent months.

925
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,211
You are my hero.

926
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:11,973
Come here!

927
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:19,689
I made tea.

928
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:32,720
Charlotte.

929
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,037
God, you're late!

930
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,915
I know, I was not sure
if it was going to show up today.

931
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,250
Well, that would not be good.

932
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:43,630
Listen, listen.

933
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,967
I'm sorry.

934
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,929
I am ashamed of myself.

935
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,493
Why are you so sad at yourself?

936
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:56,786
Because we are so different...

937
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,371
Yes, so what?

938
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,939
I've never met anyone
as fearless as you!

939
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,667
It's just boxing.

940
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,568
I'm not talking about it.

941
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,671
I'm talking about
this, here...

942
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,197
Look what you're doing!

943
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,366
You are changing the world.

944
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,787
There is much to admire in you.

945
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,248
But you can not even
see for yourself.

946
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,002
I just want to fight.

947
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:28,425
Me too. Let's go.

948
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:35,807
This is not a discussion about
race, religion or prejudice.

949
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:39,829
This is a discussion about the right
of an organization

950
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:42,915
venerable to enforce
the rules, regulations

951
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,442
and traditions of the sport
that it governs.

952
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:49,380
ABC considers facial hair
is a potential danger

953
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:52,031
to the health of a
Amateur boxer.

954
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:56,411
Maintain health and safety
of your registered boxers

955
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:59,414
is the main concern of abc.

956
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:02,726
Including Mr.
Nagra's health and safety.

957
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:06,397
In fact, it is your duty to take care
and responsibility to do so.

958
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:10,383
So there should be no confusion here, it's simple.

959
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,679
Are facials allowed?
No, they're not.

960
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:21,180
Does Mr. Nagra have facial hair?
Yes, he has.

961
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:25,315
Is he, therefore, out of the rules?
Yes he is.

962
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:29,545
Your Honor, the abc rules
should remain

963
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,922
unless otherwise agreed

964
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,948
with the appropriate statutes.

965
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:39,263
Otherwise, what prevents
that someone with a complaint

966
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:43,500
change the rules to meet
your personal aspirations?

967
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,020
Thank you.

968
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,964
Thank you, Mr. Thomas.
MS. O'brien?

969
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:55,929
Thanks.

970
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,283
Merciful, my honored colleague understood the complaint

971
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:00,307
the wrong way.

972
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,769
Mr. Nagra is a Sikh.

973
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,499
One of the fundamental foundations
of your faith is to avoid

974
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:07,857
the cutting of your hair.

975
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,504
This case and your right
to practice your faith are

976
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,112
inexorably united!

977
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:17,051
It is not harmful to apply
a "clean face" rule

978
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:19,345
When all evidence
shows that fighters

979
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,305
with beards do not suffer
more deleterious effects

980
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:22,997
about health than
those who do not have?

981
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,935
It is not harmful to cancel
one whole weight class

982
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:29,420
just so that Mr. Nagra can be eliminated from the competition?

983
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:32,983
The legitimacy of abc illustrates
a systematic fanaticism, the...

984
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,592
- objection!
- Sustained.

985
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,719
Delete this last line.

986
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:39,180
You are exaggerating, Miss.
O'brien.

987
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,495
The battles for human rights
have always been divergences

988
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,981
on seemingly intractable traditions.

989
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,484
But if these traditions had never been answered,

990
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:56,257
then today women still
would not vote, slavery

991
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:59,742
and segregation would be abundant
and those considered "different"

992
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,829
would be ostracized
institutional.

993
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:09,127
Is the "clean face" rule harmful? Yes.  Simply, the
abc regulation is unconstitutional.

994
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:13,590
Violates religious rights Ñ de nagra and human rights

995
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:17,903
of all practitioners of the fifth-largest religion in the world.

996
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,139
Must be changed. Thanks.

997
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:25,435
We heard arguments from both lawyers.

998
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,981
If there are no more statements,
this court is postponed.

999
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:33,651
Postponed.

1000
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,070


1001
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,310
Who is the handsome guy
in all the photos?

1002
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,480
Well, we did not do well.

1003
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:19,906
That first fight
in which you put me.

1004
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,801
You knew I was going to lose, did not you?

1005
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,329
This was no secret. It worked.

1006
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:31,834
God... I owe you everything.

1007
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,920
Listen, son, you do not owe me anything.

1008
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,966
I remember the first day
that you entered here.

1009
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,969
Angry and angry. You were so angry.  that you could not see
your own shadow.

1010
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,597
You reminded me of me a long time ago.

1011
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,974


1012
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,894
I've been at it for a long time.

1013
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,649
I do not think I'll be around
close forever, son,

1014
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,902
but I'm proud of some
things, proud of...

1015
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,172
Proud of Charlotte...

1016
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,239
Coach...

1017
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,743
I am very proud of you.

1018
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:12,184
You know who you are now, right?

1019
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,251
Yes.

1020
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:15,794
Yes.

1021
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,762
Hey, it's the towel head
of the television! The Muslim!

1022
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,641
I am a Sikh.

1023
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,103
Hey, where are you going, bully?

1024
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:36,816
Where are you going? Too good to
talk to us, bully?

1025
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:40,838
Look, man, I do not want any problems.

1026
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:45,742
Do not want? Well, who asked you? "Get him, Vince.

1027
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,725
Beat him, Vince!

1028
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,667
Take the idiot! Hit him, man.

1029
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,502
Hit him!

1030
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,178
Right, spokesman,
now it's your turn.

1031
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,448
Vince, man, get up!

1032
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:08,514
Shut the fuck up, Norbert.

1033
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,236
Hey guy...

1034
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:35,124
My name is pardeep nagra!
Punjab tiger.

1035
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,055
Tradition is a complicated thing.

1036
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:53,118
Our laws are nothing more than a series of traditions

1037
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,828
transmitted by
our ancestors

1038
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:58,022
and codified in the legal structure
that guides our society.

1039
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,819
Tradition can be a foundation of our own existence.

1040
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:06,799
And, however, when one
tradition infringes the other,

1041
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:10,677
When it threatens life, Liberty
or the pursuit of Happiness,

1042
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,246
We can rewrite this tradition.

1043
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:19,168
The question is: What tradition here
infringes the right of the other?

1044
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:25,633
Does the abc tradition exceed the
of Mr. Nagra's faith?

1045
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,764
It is the opinion of this
court that does not.

1046
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:35,810
That's what I wanted to hear.

1047
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:40,457
The commission is ordered to invite
the main national athlete

1048
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:44,002
rival to a fight with Mr. Ñ Nagra without violating the principles

1049
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,988
of their religion.
Trial closed.

1050
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,329
Tiger!

1051
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,671
He won!

1052
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,757
The tiger won!

1053
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,428
The tiger won!

1054
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:17,685
The tiger won! Thank you!
He won!

1055
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:23,190
Fuel injection technology.
The new i8-7...

1056
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:29,572
Come, it will pass!
Call pardeep!

1057
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:31,657
Pardeep!

1058
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,913
Behind the gloves pardeep nagra

1059
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,416
a challenging prospect

1060
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,126
Why do I do this?

1061
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:46,273
Because I wake up in the morning with
a smile on my face knowing

1062
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:47,757
I do what I love to do.

1063
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,142
Pardeep nagra was not
all smiles in the past.

1064
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,662
He fought against a
mountain of Barriers

1065
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,122
to get where you are today.

1066
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,917
Discriminated by
abc regulation

1067
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,669
that fighters should be well shaved,

1068
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:11,798
He fought in the courts until
finally win his case.

1069
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,134
If you will stop me for
cause of a turban and beard,

1070
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:15,928
This is totally wrong.

1071
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:19,246
Now I see this change and I see
that people are seeing me

1072
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,351
As I am. And, at the end of the accounts, I'm American.

1073
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,103
Now, he's where he always wanted to be.

1074
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,127
I just want to fight.

1075
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:33,445
What motivates me? To win

1076
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,513
It's about winning, that's what motivates me.

1077
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,308
Brian Doyle learned to
boxing still young,

1078
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,019
Making way for the top.

1079
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:45,356
Who made it harder than me?
Nobody.

1080
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:48,359
No matter the boxers, no
there are athletes who gave the hardest

1081
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,403
than me. No athlete.

1082
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:51,463
Because I am a champion.

1083
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,756
And, after I defeat nagra,

1084
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,383
I go after the gold
to my country.

1085
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:57,427
You can not deny that
Brian is a champion.

1086
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,203
And I'm the best,
you understand me?

1087
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,891
No one was close to what I got in this championship.

1088
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:03,892
So why deny it?

1089
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,269
I mean, it's an honor
to get in the ring with him.

1090
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,313
It is obvious that these two
fighters come with this desire

1091
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,923
a chance to join the
ring together for some time,

1092
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,569
and tomorrow, both wishes will be granted.

1093
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,762
I'm excited. And very anxious.

1094
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,991
I go there and I will show
to him who he is

1095
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,183
Brian "the bear" Doyle. "I'm going to defeat him."

1096
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,185
I'll do my best.

1097
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,644
The time has come.

1098
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,816
Ladies and gentlemen!

1099
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:21,739
In this Corner, fighting for
boxing club Wakefield,

1100
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:26,076
weighing 74.5 kg,

1101
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:32,208
pardeep "punjab tiger" nagra!

1102
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:42,718
And in this Corner, fighting for the
heavy fist fighting club,

1103
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:48,724
weighing 73.9 kg, the undisputed
champion,

1104
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:54,438
Brian "the bear" Doyle!

1105
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,946
And now both boxers are
found in the middle of the ring.

1106
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,907
For those of you who are joining us at home,

1107
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,260
Welcome, the arena is
crowded and turbulent.

1108
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:09,870
ABC had to change that
fight for this arena

1109
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,957
because of the high demand
of ticket sales,

1110
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,433
and I'm sure they liked it.

1111
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:17,062
Again I want to warn,
any blow below this point

1112
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,755
will be considered low blow.
Any question?

1113
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:22,776
Okay, obey my commands,
protect yourself at all times.

1114
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,927
Touch the gloves,
gentlemen, let's go to the fight.

1115
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:30,227
You can feel the tension
in the arena tonight.

1116
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:45,548
Fight!

1117
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:47,452
Well, here's the bell, people,
the battle will begin.

1118
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,031
Release the left!

1119
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,543
Get off the rope.

1120
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:45,674
Likewise.

1121
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,093
So do you want to ask me something?

1122
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,697
I want to fight clean! Clean fight!

1123
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:53,390
Get separated! Let's go! Fight!

1124
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,404
For the Song. Pro Your Song.

1125
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,953
Get up, pardeep, come on!

1126
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,731
Come on, pardeep, you
can defeat him!

1127
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:28,801
- Take a deep breath.
- He is fast!

1128
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:30,552
You are faster.

1129
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:33,698
You know what to do.

1130
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,140
Hitting him more than he hits me.

1131
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:47,903
Stay away from the ropes.

1132
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,576
Go, react, go, hit, go.

1133
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,171
Up and down...

1134
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:17,266
Five... six... seven...

1135
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:18,851
- can you continue?
- I am fine.

1136
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:20,727
Fight.

1137
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:34,592
Stop joking, Brian.

1138
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,845
You have to end it already! "Right, did you hear me?"

1139
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,346
He is strong.

1140
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,746
Alright, I want
to use your jab,

1141
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:40,932
but keep circulating
left, right?

1142
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:41,850
Yes...

1143
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:42,715
do it right. Hit the body, okay?

1144
01:22:42,741 --> 01:22:43,493
He is strong.

1145
01:22:43,517 --> 01:22:45,544
You wanted this fight,
so it's your chance!

1146
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,108
You do not hit him with the right hand, right?

1147
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:51,067
Right...

1148
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:52,342
relax.
Keep the guard.

1149
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,546
And that's exactly what I mean.

1150
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,961
Whatever pardeep is offering, Brian Doyle

1151
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,196
is assimilating and
quickly retaliating.

1152
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,663
- My goodness!
- He is hurt?

1153
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:23,790
No, you can sit down,
he's fine.

1154
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,604
This blow struck nagra underneath and he's on his knees.

1155
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,087
The judge had to intervene.

1156
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:31,441
Pro Canto.

1157
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:33,300
Hey, low blow, Judge.

1158
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,779
Five... six... seven...

1159
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,443
I do not believe the judge is counting...

1160
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:43,435
Eight... nine...

1161
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,730
Are you okay? Keep going?

1162
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:48,082
Fight.

1163
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,650
It seems that the official
have not seen,

1164
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,777
but I think all
world in the arena saw.

1165
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:55,089
Did you see what he did? Did you see what he did?

1166
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,758
Come on, breathe. Let's go there, I do not want to see

1167
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,885
You doing all this shit
of wild man, right?

1168
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,470
Recover.

1169
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:04,081
Not controlling the rhythm, tiger. "That's not how we fight.

1170
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,167
Take it easy, take it easy.

1171
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:09,646
Breathe.

1172
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,150
I want you to
continue to relax.

1173
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,484
I want you to hit more
with the left, go down, go up,

1174
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:15,944
Keep up the pace, right?

1175
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,219
Come on, you know who you are.

1176
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,471
I am the punjab tiger!

1177
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:26,603
Fight.

1178
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:49,126
Singing!

1179
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,380
Five... six...

1180
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,386
Seven...

1181
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:09,205
Tiger!

1182
01:25:09,305 --> 01:25:13,418
Tiger!

1183
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:16,778
- Tiger! "Eight!"

1184
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:22,909
Tiger!

1185
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:35,756
Nine!

1186
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:17,982
Hit him!

1187
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:22,094
Now! Hit him!

1188
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:32,270
Fight!

1189
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:53,458
Six... seven...

1190
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:01,717
Go, man. Let's go!

1191
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:05,053
Show them what you have!

1192
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:10,600
Show everyone what you have, man!
Let's go!

1193
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:14,604
Let's do this!

1194
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:01,985
Ladies and gentlemen!

1195
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,739
We have a split decision!

1196
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:11,953
The first card has 39 x 37,

1197
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:14,206
nagra!

1198
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:20,796
The second card has 39 x 36,

1199
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:23,882
Doyle!

1200
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:29,971
And the third card has...

1201
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:33,600
38 x 37...

1202
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:39,689
And still the undisputed champion,

1203
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:44,694
Brian "the bear" Doyle!

1204
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,379
You nearly beat me. "You're hard, my friend!"

1205
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:04,148
You almost got me.

1206
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:05,465
Keep your head up.

1207
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:07,467
You did well, look what we did.

1208
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:08,885
Good luck, Brian.

1209
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:13,306
For you too, you went well...

1210
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:18,913
Tiger!

1211
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:20,480
I'm sorry, coach.

1212
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:23,793
For what? Listen to this, man.

1213
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,652
Does this sound like you've lost?

1214
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:32,075
Tiger!

1215
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,745
Tiger!

1216
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:38,975
Tiger!

1217
01:29:39,075 --> 01:29:42,836
Tiger!

1218
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:04,232
Prem Singh and Pardeep Nagra 2015.

1219
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:22,125
In memory of Joe Pugliese
1937 - 2016.
