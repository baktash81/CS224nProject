1
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,049
We have a midcourse deviation.

2
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:53,302
Target heading 036, 126 miles.

3
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,305
Bearing 062,
Havana, VOR.

4
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,062
MAN 1: He's landing at Cray Cay.

5
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,772
Advise Key West Drug Enforcement.

6
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,442
MAN 2: Roger, sir.
AWACS to Key West.

7
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,527
Key West Drug Enforcement,
please come in.

8
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,822
MAN 1: If they hurry, they just
might be able to grab the bastard.

9
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,000
Now, you're sure you've got the ring?

10
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,502
Relax, Felix.

11
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,094
SHARKEY: Friends of yours?

12
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,846
My partners at the DEA.

13
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,278
What the hell is going on?

14
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,197
Sanchez is in the Bahamas.

15
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,573
Have you cleared it with Nassau?

16
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,741
We've got the green light.

17
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,910
- Let's go!
- Hey, Felix, Felix!

18
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,453
Haven't you forgotten something?

19
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,456
Oh, James, explain
to Della, will you?

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,500
No way.
I'm coming with you.

21
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,461
Okay, but strictly as an observer.

22
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,339
- Sorry, Sharkey.
- Hey, why me?

23
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,800
Hey, you guys,
you can't do this to me!

24
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,052
What will I tell Della?

25
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,284
What did he promise you?
His heart?

26
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,622
Give her his heart.

27
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,499
No.

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,252
No, Franz.
I didn't mean any harm.

29
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,589
It's all right, baby.

30
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,008
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

31
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,761
We all make mistakes.

32
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,933
Your escapades are getting more creative.

33
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,561
Not a word.

34
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,581
He's still not here.

35
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,374
Can you go around the block again?

36
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,458
What about the guests?

37
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,878
I told you this was a mistake!

38
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,050
James, just in case.

39
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,282
Okay.

40
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,632
I want Sanchez alive!
Stay here, James.

41
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,734
No Sanchez.
Damn.

42
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,197
FELIX: Watch out!

43
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,575
FELIX: Hey, observer!

44
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,953
You're trying to get yourself killed?

45
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,248
If I don't get you back for
the wedding, I'm a dead man for sure!

46
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,676
- You need help?
- No. Take your hands off me.

47
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,428
Just go away.

48
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,182
Sanchez!

49
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,308
DEA AGENT: Let's go!

50
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,625
Come on! Come on!

51
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,094
FELIX: He'll be in Cuban
airspace in 20 minutes.

52
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,929
He hasn't got away yet.

53
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,931
What the hell are you doing?

54
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,808
Let's go fishing!

55
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,679
Forward.
Forward.

56
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,474
Easy.
Hold it.

57
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,601
Back up. Back up.

58
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,566
Forward now.

59
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,402
Hold it!

60
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,871
Bring him in.
Take the load.

61
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,092
DELLA: No, please go home.
I'm very. . .

62
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,510
WOMAN: There he is!

63
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,185
Let's go, James!

64
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,671
FELIX: We made it!

65
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,266
- Come along.
- James!

66
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,310
- Your hat.
- Thank you.

67
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,614
MAN 1: On the double!

68
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,992
MAN 2:
Get away from the door!

69
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,288
You're facing 139
felony counts, Sanchez.

70
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,626
Why, that's 936 years.

71
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,799
Even one of your famous million-dollar
bribes can't get you out of this one.

72
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,092
Two.

73
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,301
What?

74
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,846
$2 million, U .S.

75
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,308
A standing offer for
anyone who springs me.

76
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,685
God damn it!

77
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,397
You think you're in
some banana republic?

78
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,483
All that scumbag money
won't do you a bit of good here.

79
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,859
Very good.

80
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,486
But I think I'm gonna be
home soon, huh?

81
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,071
Why you. . .

82
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,198
Get a hold of yourself!

83
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,912
We got a nice private cell
waiting for your ass at Quantico,

84
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,540
and I'm going to personally
see you get there.

85
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,503
I'm terribly sorry!

86
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,967
That's a custom. You see, the bride
always gets to kiss her best man.

87
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,596
I thought it was the other way around.

88
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,307
Oh, James, would you mind?

89
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,769
Felix is still in the study,
and we've got to cut this cake.

90
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,938
I'll do anything for
a woman with a knife.

91
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,441
Thank you. Yes,
could you help me here?

92
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,786
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Come in. We're finished.

93
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,037
Pam, meet James.

94
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,456
Goodbye, Felix.

95
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,253
Strictly business, my friend.

96
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,754
Switch that thing off, Felix.

97
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,673
You know you have a house
full of guests waiting.

98
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,967
Just let me save this.
Take a seat.

99
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,554
The department wants
a full report, yesterday.

100
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,389
We really hit it lucky today.

101
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,975
Sanchez hasn't been out
of his home base for years.

102
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,059
Well, couldn't you extradite him?

103
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,144
Not a chance.

104
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,812
He's killed, intimidated or bribed

105
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,398
half the government officials
from here to Chile.

106
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,610
There's only one
law down there, Sanchez's law.

107
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,653
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

108
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,113
Lead or silver.

109
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,574
Ed.

110
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,618
Double congratulations, old buddy.

111
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,788
You take your time on the
honeymoon. Everything's okay.

112
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,459
You must be Bond, the guy
who came along for the ride.

113
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,960
Ed Killifer.

114
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,756
We're taking Sanchez to
Quantico this afternoon.

115
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,508
Hey, stay and have a drink with us.

116
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,634
Can't. Got to get back.

117
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,094
I just came by to kiss the bride.

118
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,681
Felix, it's time to cut the cake.

119
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,892
Hand me the picture of Della.
Quick.

120
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,106
She must be ready to kill me.

121
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,657
I tied them myself.

122
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,534
- What are these?
- Lures!

123
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,536
These'll keep you busy
for the next few days.

124
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,622
I'm not going fishing on my honeymoon!

125
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,918
REPORTER 1: How many others
are being held in there?

126
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,545
REPORTER 2: Where are you
taking him, Mr. Killifer?

127
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,171
REPORTER 3: Now, why did you
go to the Bahamas?

128
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,175
REPORTER 4: Mr. Sanchez, will you
look this way for a picture, please?

129
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,678
Come on, get him inside!

130
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,263
Get that lady out of there.

131
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,847
REPORTER 2:
Are you really a Colombian?

132
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,391
Have you been fairly treated?

133
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,059
REPORTER 4:
One more picture, please!

134
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,395
REPORTER 2: Are you connected with
any laboratories in South America?

135
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,646
Why did you go to the Bahamas?

136
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,981
OFFICER: No more questions.

137
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,400
REPORTER 3: Do you expect
to be vindicated, Mr. Sanchez?

138
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,985
Wait a minute!

139
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,072
ED: Okay, let's go.

140
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,490
Yeah, we're moving out.

141
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,596
Will you excuse me, Liala?
Just a minute.

142
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,222
- I have a surprise for you.
- Oh, really.

143
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,017
Yes, I do.
It's right over here.

144
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,103
What's that?

145
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,238
James.
Love always, Della and Felix.

146
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,740
We love you.

147
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,992
Thanks.

148
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,820
Come on!

149
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,724
MAN 1: Did you get him?

150
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:58,850
Hang on.

151
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,018
MAN 2: I can't see him.

152
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,269
MAN 3: How deep is it there?

153
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,063
How many were inside?

154
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,643
Oh, James!

155
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,062
I wanted you to have something.

156
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,939
You know the tradition?

157
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,443
The next one who catches
this is the next one who. . .

158
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,944
No.

159
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,697
Thanks, Della.

160
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,490
It's time I left.

161
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,409
Oh, James.

162
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,377
Did I say something wrong?

163
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,839
He was married once,
but it was a long time ago.

164
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,224
Felix, you're no good to me
with a wrecked back.

165
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,737
Let her go.
I'm the one you want.

166
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,919
Hey!
Ready to go?

167
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,962
We got the batteries
recharged on the sub.

168
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,297
It'll take you to the 12-mile limit.

169
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,342
Fast boat to Cuba,
you'll be there for breakfast.

170
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,093
Relax. We'll wait for Dario.

171
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,929
Look, are you crazy?

172
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,181
You got everybody looking for you.

173
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,724
What about Killifer?

174
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,935
Having a cop here is nuts!

175
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,938
I want to deep-six him.

176
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,317
I made a deal with this guy,
and I'm going to keep my word.

177
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,277
I don't like it.
He can finger me.

178
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,905
I spent a fortune on this cover.

179
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,661
Something you'd
better understand, amigo,

180
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,998
loyalty is more important
to me than money.

181
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,793
Now, get the cop.

182
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,755
Killifer.

183
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,638
There's $2 million, all in twenties.

184
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,015
It's very heavy,
but difficult to trace.

185
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,141
Smart.

186
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,560
Be ready for tomorrow.

187
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,103
I have someone to pick you up.

188
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,647
- Where's Lupe?
- On the boat.

189
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,358
Keep her there until I send for her.

190
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,610
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

191
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,864
Hey, no fooling around with my girl.

192
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,574
You kidding?

193
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,784
After what you did to
that guy on the islands?

194
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,036
You liked my little valentine, huh?

195
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,358
Where's my wife?

196
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:39,946
Don't worry.
We gave her a nice honeymoon.

197
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,666
I want you to know
this is nothing personal.

198
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,335
It's purely

199
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,211
business.

200
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,947
Killifer!

201
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,909
Sorry, old buddy, but two mil
is a hell of a chunk of dough.

202
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,751
Killing me won't
stop anything, Sanchez!

203
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,796
There are worse things
than dying, hombre.

204
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,013
See you in hell!

205
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,140
No.

206
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,352
Today's the first day
of the rest of your life.

207
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,981
No!

208
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,850
WOMAN: Thank you.

209
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,729
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

210
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,898
Thank you.

211
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,859
Your passport, please?

212
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,155
What's going on?

213
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,866
Some big drug dealer just escaped.

214
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,203
Now, will that be smoking
or non-smoking, Mr. . .

215
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,329
Your ticket!

216
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,484
Felix?

217
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:37,999
Della!

218
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,812
Della?

219
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,063
Felix.

220
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,149
You'll be all right.
Hang on.

221
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,487
MAN: Hey, Leiter.
Where you been?

222
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,532
It's Bond.
Get an ambulance here, quick!

223
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,293
Hi, Sharkey.

224
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,003
You stick around.

225
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,797
I might have some more
questions for you, okay?

226
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:09,299
How is he?

227
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,343
His left leg's gone below the knee.

228
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,345
They might be able to save his arm.

229
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,222
You can bet it was a chain saw.

230
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,683
Colombians love to
use them on informers.

231
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,187
Hell, they sell more here
than in the state of Oregon.

232
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,772
I wish I could be more hopeful,

233
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,816
but we'll have to wait and see.

234
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,653
Chain saw, my ass!

235
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,947
I know a shark bite when I see one.

236
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,248
Sanchez has vanished.

237
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,875
He's got all of Leiter's files.

238
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,376
God only knows what's in them.

239
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,836
Well, find him.

240
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,504
He's out of our jurisdiction.

241
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,174
I mean, there's plenty of countries
that will protect him.

242
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,800
We can't even get an extradition.

243
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,886
There are other ways.

244
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,888
Let it go, Commander.

245
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,014
You're going to do nothing?

246
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,182
You're just going to
forget all about it?

247
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,392
No, I'm not gonna forget about it!

248
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,147
Looks like Sanchez's law operates
north of the border, too.

249
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,650
Let's go shark hunting.

250
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,742
This is the last place in the Keys.

251
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,119
We'll have to try Miami next.

252
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,663
Stay here.

253
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,345
You stay out of sight.
I'll handle this.

254
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,146
We're closed.
Ain't nobody here.

255
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:50,400
Look, I've come all the way
from London to see you.

256
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,609
Universal Exports.

257
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,361
We've been retained
by the Regent's Park Zoo

258
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,322
to arrange shipment of
a Carcharodon carcharias.

259
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:57,448
A what?

260
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,491
Great white shark.

261
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,452
KREST: It's all right, Bill.
Let him in.

262
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,956
Unfortunately, we sold
all our sharks years ago.

263
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,625
As you can see,
we do purely research now.

264
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,669
It's a project to feed the third world.

265
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,505
We feed maggots to our special breed

266
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,716
of genetically engineered fish,

267
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,428
use hormones to make them all male,
gain weight faster.

268
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,936
From your shark-hunting days?

269
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:29,355
Yeah.
Actually, it's for sale.

270
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,650
Look, I'm kind of busy.
Maybe some other time.

271
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,116
Thank you. I look forward
to seeing you again.

272
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,076
Goodbye, Mr. . .

273
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,411
Goodbye.

274
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,196
Mr. Krest said to be ready.

275
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,740
He'll send the sub back in
three hours to pick you up.

276
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,367
Can't wait.

277
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,702
This dump gives me the creeps.

278
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,757
James.

279
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,925
Hold it, right there.

280
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,314
Do you mind if I get
my hands out of here?

281
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,274
Yeah. Do it slowly.

282
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,742
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

283
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,980
ED: Freeze!

284
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,316
Over by the trapdoor, old buddy.

285
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,743
Is this where you put
your old buddy Felix?

286
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,161
Not me.

287
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,373
Chalk that one up
to Sanchez and Krest.

288
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,180
ED: Whoa!

289
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,984
There's $2 million in that suitcase.

290
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,195
I'll split it with you.

291
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,246
You earned it.

292
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,374
You keep it, old buddy.

293
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,350
SHARKEY: God,
what a terrible waste.

294
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,227
Of money.

295
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,234
BOND: Hey, Sharkey!

296
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,488
Any news on the Wavekrest?

297
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:14,575
Yeah. She's a big marine research
vessel owned by a Milton Krest.

298
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,871
They're collecting specimens
off the Cay Sal Bank.

299
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,998
How long will it
take us to get there?

300
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,084
Maybe about six hours.

301
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,961
I have a few things to pick up.
Be ready in an hour.

302
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,505
Yeah, okay.

303
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,762
Hey, Commander, you got a minute?

304
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,849
Local cops got a tip about
a warehouse last night.

305
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,978
Turned up 500 keys of Colombian pure,
a couple of stiffs,

306
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,232
and a little bitty piece
of what used to be Killifer.

307
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,193
Good. At least
someone's on the case.

308
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,905
You may be a pal of Leiter's,
but I can only cover up so much.

309
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,408
The D.A. is screaming
to know what happened.

310
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,411
You know, we got laws
in this country, too.

311
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:02,832
Do you have a law against
what they did to Leiter?

312
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,338
Look, you're in over your head.

313
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,465
This is where it ends, Commander.

314
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,255
You were supposed to
be in Istanbul last night.

315
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,258
I'm afraid this
unfortunate Leiter business

316
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,718
has clouded your judgment.

317
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,052
You have a job to do.

318
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,472
I expect you on a plane this afternoon.

319
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,890
I haven't finished here, sir.

320
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,641
Leave it to the Americans.

321
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,477
It's their mess.
Let them clear it up.

322
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,937
Sir, they're not
going to do anything.

323
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,523
Look, I owe it to Leiter.

324
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,026
He's put his life on
the line for me many times.

325
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,612
Spare me this sentimental rubbish.

326
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,697
He knew the risks.

327
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,991
And his wife?

328
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,286
This private vendetta of yours
could easily compromise

329
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,205
Her Majesty's government.

330
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,583
You have an assignment,
and I expect you to carry it out

331
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,044
objectively and professionally.

332
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,256
Then you have my resignation, sir.

333
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,009
We're not a country club, 007.

334
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,765
Effective immediately,

335
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,184
your license to kill is revoked,

336
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,312
and I require you to
hand over your weapon.

337
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,648
Now.

338
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,655
I need hardly remind you that you're
still bound by the Official Secrets Act.

339
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,909
Well, then I guess it's

340
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,912
a farewell to arms.

341
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,798
Don't! Too many people.

342
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,931
God help you, Commander.

343
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,035
Something in sector C.

344
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,426
You caused us all
a lot of trouble, young lady.

345
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,845
You're borracho.
Go to bed.

346
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,347
When Sanchez heard you ran away,

347
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,767
he went nuts.

348
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,061
It's none of your business.

349
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,355
It's my business when
your stupid little tricks

350
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,482
get Sanchez arrested,

351
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:20,070
and I gotta put my organization
at risk to get him out.

352
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,740
The DEA just raided Key West.

353
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,910
You cost me a lot of dough.

354
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,536
He'll give you the money.

355
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,749
He doesn't work that way.

356
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,001
You better watch yourself, girlie.

357
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,086
I've known him a long time.

358
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,632
I've seen a lot of girls
like you come and go.

359
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,800
You're drunk. Get out.

360
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,471
And stop peeking through my windows.

361
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,891
Hey, come on, come on,
what are you so stuck-up for?

362
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,144
He fixed that phony
beauty contest you won.

363
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,021
- Hey.
- Mr. Krest?

364
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,149
Yeah, what?

365
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,860
The Sentinel's picking up something
large on the monitor, sir.

366
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,363
I think you'd better take a look.

367
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,407
I don't believe this.

368
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,709
What the hell is it now?

369
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,424
It's just a manta ray.
Get the probe back in.

370
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,301
We'll start loading now.

371
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,386
Yes, sir.

372
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,996
He said you're okay.

373
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,619
Take care of him.

374
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,849
Make a sound and you're dead.

375
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,645
You.

376
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,647
What are you doing in here?

377
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,524
Krest gave me his cabin.

378
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,318
He's next door.
Where's Sanchez?

379
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,987
He's not onboard.

380
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,655
I don't know where he is.

381
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,157
You're his girlfriend.

382
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,825
He doesn't tell me anything.

383
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,330
KREST: Open it.
I need to talk to you.

384
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,250
Answer it.

385
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,711
Just a moment.

386
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,757
- What do you want?
- Somebody slipped aboard.

387
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,385
Did you see anybody?

388
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,430
No, I was sleeping. Go away.

389
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,515
Mr. Krest. They're back.

390
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,018
Bolt your door.

391
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,857
Who whipped you?
Sanchez?

392
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,153
It was my fault.

393
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,530
I did something wrong,
made him angry.

394
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,209
Nice work, Clive.

395
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:29,379
Thanks, Mr. Krest.
Guess what? His name was Sharkey.

396
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,176
KREST: Get rid of the boat.
We've got work to do.

397
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,513
You'd better find
yourself a new lover.

398
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,807
Don't you men know any other way?

399
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,852
It's Sanchez's way.
You seem to like it.

400
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,812
You know nothing.

401
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:46,939
Please go.

402
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,107
If they find you here,
we'll both be killed.

403
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,778
Stay here.

404
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,659
We got everything useful out of her.

405
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,786
That's it. Take her out
and sink her.

406
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,955
Okay, Clive.
Cast off!

407
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,335
Compliments of Sharkey.

408
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,091
MAN 1: Man overboard!

409
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,853
Get him!
Don't let him get away!

410
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:29,523
What's wrong?

411
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,400
Get back in your
cabin and stay there.

412
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,443
The guy must have
drowned, Mr. Krest.

413
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,154
Don't be so sure. Find him!

414
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,202
Come on!

415
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,124
Launch Sentinel!

416
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,375
MAN 1: Yes, sir!

417
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,685
MAN 2: Stand by to
dive when I tell you.

418
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,365
Numbers one and two, dive!

419
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,343
MAN 3: I can see something
reflecting over there!

420
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,477
There's too much turbulence to be sure.

421
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,368
MAN ON RADIO:
Wavekrest! Wavekrest!

422
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,786
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

423
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,037
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

424
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,497
Loading completed, Mr. Krest.

425
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:09,790
Bring Sentinel back in.

426
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,124
Yes, sir.

427
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,294
Mr. Krest!

428
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,554
Bring Sentinel up!

429
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:10,225
There he is! There!
Right there! Get him!

430
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,518
There!

431
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:17,274
Dive, damn it! Dive!

432
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,775
Right there!

433
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,683
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

434
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,702
There! Pick him up!

435
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,502
MAN 1: All boats
return to Wavekrest!

436
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,212
Aye, aye, sir.

437
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,395
Here.
Put her stern-in.

438
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,036
Hey, do you know
someone called Bouvier?

439
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,122
Over there.

440
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,461
Well, this is an unexpected pleasure.

441
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:30,795
Where's Leiter?

442
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,464
Hospital, intensive care.

443
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:35,383
Where you'll be if you
don't get out of here fast.

444
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,260
Sanchez has Leiter's files.

445
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,053
Your name's all over them.

446
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,891
Hell, I knew something was wrong.

447
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,101
Those two have been
at the bar for hours.

448
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,395
Probably waiting to see
who showed up to meet me.

449
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,063
Would you like anything to drink?

450
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:50,857
- Bud with a lime.
- Yeah, same.

451
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,650
Sure thing, hon.

452
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:59,073
Shit! It's Dario.
He's bad news.

453
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,660
He used to be with the Contras
before they kicked him out.

454
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:05,538
Just the kind of guy
Sanchez would send.

455
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,500
You carrying?

456
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:16,216
If they start shooting,
you just hit the deck and stay there.

457
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:30,021
La senorita Bouvier.

458
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,274
Don't I know you from somewhere?

459
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,361
- No.
- Oh, yes, I do.

460
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:40,031
You used to fly charter planes
for some friends of mine.

461
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,909
I got a job for you.

462
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,661
Why don't we go outside,
and we talk in private.

463
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,455
Take your hands off her.
She's with me.

464
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,374
Nobody's asking you, gringo.

465
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,418
He's with me.
Keep your hands on the table.

466
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,173
Here we go.

467
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,927
Two beers.
That'll be $3.50.

468
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,346
Do your friends want something?

469
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,098
Let me get it!

470
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,521
He's had enough.
Run a tab.

471
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,022
Okay.

472
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,482
- How did you get here?
- By boat.

473
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:17,193
- Where is it?
- Back behind this wall.

474
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:26,953
Thanks.

475
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,663
Touche.

476
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,805
Get it started.

477
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,281
Come on!

478
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,644
Don't move.

479
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,855
Relax.
It's a bulletproof vest.

480
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,316
This Kevlar's great.

481
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,735
You're bloody lucky to be alive!

482
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,030
It's not luck.
It's experience.

483
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:28,324
A few inches higher,
it'd have been your head.

484
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,326
Look, I just saved
your life back there.

485
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,577
If it wasn't for me,

486
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,371
your ass would've
been nailed to the wall.

487
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,664
You saved my life?

488
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,207
Yes.

489
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,668
It's a tough business
you've picked, Miss Bouvier.

490
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,086
Leave it to the professionals.

491
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,505
Look, pal, I was an army pilot.

492
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,341
I have flown to the toughest
hellholes in South America,

493
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:49,095
and I will not have you lecture
me about professionalism.

494
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,522
BOUVIER: Out of gas.

495
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,400
I haven't heard that one in a long time.

496
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,820
Well, they must
have hit the fuel line.

497
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,322
Look, I'm gonna need your help.

498
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,617
I want a complete rundown
on Sanchez's operation,

499
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:15,204
and I'll need a flight
to Isthmus City, private.

500
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,956
No one must know I've left.

501
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,584
What do you want to go there for?

502
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,544
I'll pay you very well.

503
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,380
You're going after
Sanchez, aren't you?

504
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,133
Will you help me?

505
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,760
How many men have you got?

506
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,140
Just you and me.

507
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:36,934
Are you crazy?

508
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,145
Sanchez has an entire army
protecting him down there.

509
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,856
Just fly me in and leave.
$50,000.

510
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,357
It's not that easy.

511
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,485
False flight plans,
payoffs at Isthmus City Airport.

512
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,403
I can't do a job like
that for less than 100.

513
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:48,738
Sixty.

514
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,909
- Ninety.
- Seventy.

515
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,995
- Eighty.
- Seventy-five.

516
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,207
You pay the fuel?

517
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,833
You get the plane.

518
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,797
Deal.

519
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:18,935
Now, why don't you wait
until you're asked?

520
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,229
Well, why don't you ask me?

521
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,807
There are five typing errors
on the first page alone.

522
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,142
What's got into you?

523
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,476
Sorry, sir.

524
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,440
"U .S. Immigration
has no reports of 007

525
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:10,361
"leaving the United States as
of 1500 hours today."

526
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,447
Who authorized this?

527
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:14,740
I did, sir.

528
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,535
I thought you'd be worried about James.
He's gone missing.

529
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:21,164
You know him better than that.
He'll go after Sanchez.

530
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,833
He's got to be stopped.

531
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,711
I've already alerted our man in Isthmus.

532
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,337
I want that out by this afternoon.

533
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,173
Yes, sir.

534
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:33,968
Q Branch, please.

535
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,410
This is the master bedroom.

536
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,329
I hope everything is
satisfactory, senor.

537
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,039
It's adequate.

538
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:06,000
I'd like a case of champagne,
Bollinger R. D.

539
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,335
Certainly, senor.

540
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,378
If I could ask you to sign
the registration cards?

541
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:13,549
No, my executive secretary,
Miss Kennedy, will take care of that.

542
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,218
Miss Kennedy. . .

543
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,095
Right here, please.

544
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,732
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

545
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:32,944
Fresh flowers every day.

546
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,737
Thank you very much.

547
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,323
Your key.
Enjoy your stay.

548
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,578
It's Ms. Kennedy,

549
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,164
and why can't you be
my executive secretary?

550
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:50,044
We're south of the border.
It's a man's world.

551
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,465
Thanks for everything.
Your job's finished.

552
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,051
- I want to stay.
- Too dangerous.

553
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,427
Enough people have been killed already.

554
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,388
Don't talk to me about danger.

555
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,890
I won't be safe until Sanchez is dead.

556
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:05,351
Besides, you could use my help.

557
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,773
Well, if you're going to stay and
be my executive secretary,

558
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,900
you'd better look the part.

559
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:15,778
Here. Buy yourself
some decent clothes.

560
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,450
What bank does Sanchez use?
I need to make a deposit.

561
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:24,328
The biggest one in town,
Banco de Isthmus.

562
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,871
He owns it.

563
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,420
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

564
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,681
Senor Bond.

565
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,853
I've come to make a small deposit.

566
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:52,690
Well, I'm sure my people downstairs
are quite capable of. . .

567
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,568
Please sit down.

568
01:00:56,236 --> 01:01:00,448
We operate the world's largest
private investment fund.

569
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:03,993
Our biggest problem is what
to do with all the money.

570
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:08,456
We have a cash surplus
of $10 million a day,

571
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,416
which we ship, through our bank,

572
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,918
to the U .S. Federal Reserve,

573
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,879
thus establishing credits

574
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,798
which can be used for
any legitimate investment.

575
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:21,510
SANCHEZ: See, someone has to help
the gringos with their trade deficit.

576
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:27,558
Make out a deposit receipt for
$4,900,000 for senor Bond.

577
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,437
And of course there will be additional
monthly deposits in the same amount.

578
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,647
Of course. Be assured,
we at Banco de Isthmus

579
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,691
are experienced in handling
accounts of this nature.

580
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,318
BOUVIER: Let me pass, please.

581
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,199
- Senor Montelongo.
- Yes?

582
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,658
I'm Ms. Kennedy,

583
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,161
Mr. Bond's executive secretary.

584
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:49,580
I'd also appreciate it
if you could establish

585
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,832
a line of credit for me at the casino.

586
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,417
Shall we say $2 million?

587
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:54,543
No problem.

588
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,045
You have excellent collateral,

589
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,464
and our chairman also owns the casino.

590
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,383
Oh, a very convenient arrangement.

591
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,219
We have always thought so, senorita.

592
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:09,725
Thank you. Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen, and welcome.

593
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,769
This is a very special night for us.

594
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:15,106
We want you to know that only through
your very generous donations

595
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,442
can the work here at the OMI
continue to progress.

596
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:22,655
We've learned so much, but we've
only just scratched the surface.

597
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,739
We need your help.

598
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:27,368
We need you to go to your
phones right now and make a pledge.

599
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,161
This is not for me.

600
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:30,955
This is not for them.
It's for all of us.

601
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,415
You okay, reinita?

602
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:33,874
I'm fine.

603
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:35,960
Krest called me from the boat

604
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,046
with a story about somebody
ripping him off.

605
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,424
Did you see anything happen
when you were there?

606
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:44,885
No, Franz. I stayed in my
cabin most of the time.

607
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:47,555
PROFESSOR JOE:
We need your help.

608
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,473
What's the matter baby?

609
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:51,142
You know I can't stand that thing.

610
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,943
I'd like a private table.
Blackjack.

611
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,695
MAN: Certainly, senor Bond.

612
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,030
Would you come this way, please?

613
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:14,707
Quarter of a million dollars,

614
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:18,043
and I'd like to raise
the limit to $5,000 a box.

615
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,629
Put these wonderful
volunteers behind me to work.

616
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,966
Dario will take you shopping tomorrow.

617
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,010
You can spend a lot
of money, have fun.

618
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,304
Now, give me a little kiss.

619
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,515
Want one, too?

620
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,811
We can raise the price.

621
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,314
$22,000 per kilo this month.

622
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:39,815
I like that.

623
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,027
Yeah, this is Truman-Lodge.

624
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,403
$22,000.

625
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,031
Our goal today is to raise...

626
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:51,869
$22,000 from each of
our meditation chapters.

627
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,914
That's $22,000 each.

628
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,209
Go to your phones.
Please help us.

629
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,252
Bless your hearts.

630
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,969
Let me have half a million.

631
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:11,847
Listen to this.
Our wonderful Manhattan chapel

632
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,141
has just made a special $500 pledge.

633
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:18,479
Five hundred kilos.
I knew they'd go for it.

634
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,564
This guy cracks me up.

635
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,274
MAN ON PHONE:
Is senor Sanchez there?

636
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,235
Yes, he's right here.

637
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,656
Yeah?
I got a British sucker

638
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,282
who dropped a quarter of a million,

639
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,159
and he wants to play no-limit.

640
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:33,285
Which one?

641
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:36,622
Table two.
Plays like a real jerk-off.

642
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,668
That's the guy that flew in in the
private plane today,

643
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:43,045
opened that account at the bank.

644
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,548
$5 million in cash.

645
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,011
Let him play.

646
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,435
Double down.

647
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,689
Split.

648
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,797
PROFESSOR JOE:
Listen to this.

649
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:32,803
Our Chicago chapel has just
received a $1,000 double pledge.

650
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,722
They all accepted the new price.

651
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,518
MAN ON PHONE: Senor Sanchez.
- Yes, he's right here.

652
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,730
Bless your hearts.

653
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:46,275
The British guy is
a quarter-million ahead.

654
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,527
Shall I close the table?

655
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:51,947
No.

656
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,199
Send whatever you can send.

657
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,453
Tell Lupe to come in here.

658
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:58,621
Right.

659
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,294
You have good luck tonight.

660
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,921
You gonna share any of that money?

661
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,809
Miss Kennedy, would you get me
a medium-dry vodka martini?

662
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,437
- Well, why don't you ask. . .
- Shaken, not stirred.

663
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,565
Cut?

664
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,494
You're very professional.

665
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:40,204
Used to work here.

666
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:42,206
Am I going to win or lose?

667
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,750
Lose, but not much.

668
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,630
Vodka martini, que?

669
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:52,007
Shaken, not stirred.

670
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,467
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

671
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,220
Looks like your luck has changed.

672
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:58,514
Is that why he sent you?

673
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,933
And to find out more about you.

674
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,352
Perhaps I'd better quit for the night.

675
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:08,857
You should walk straight out of here,

676
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,235
go to the airport and never come back.

677
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:19,743
Where's Sanchez?

678
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:21,829
Upstairs in his office.

679
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:22,996
He's been there all day.

680
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:26,709
He's planning a big party
for some Orientals tomorrow night.

681
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:29,378
And what did you tell him
about the Wavekrest?

682
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,088
Nothing. Now go.

683
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,885
Take me to him.

684
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,012
You loco?
You'll get us both killed.

685
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,957
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

686
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,333
This way, please.

687
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:14,631
PROFESSOR JOE: Send us a dollar.
Send us 50 cents.

688
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,633
Send whatever you can send.

689
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:20,095
We've got a very special offer
for you guys out there

690
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,388
with your beer and your popcorn. . .

691
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:23,265
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

692
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,309
This is almost over.

693
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:30,522
This particular book has sold in excess
of a quarter of a million copies.

694
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:34,485
Anyone who sends in
a $100 pledge or more

695
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,613
will receive a personally
autographed copy of my book,

696
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,031
The Secrets of Cone Power Revealed.

697
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,365
Lovely view.

698
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:47,080
It's a $49.95 value, and
you get it absolutely free.

699
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,749
Bond, James Bond.

700
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,375
Sit, please.

701
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,045
We need your help.
Bless your hearts.

702
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,683
Well-traveled man.

703
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,020
You did all right
at the tables tonight.

704
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,816
I had the feeling my luck
was about to change.

705
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:18,028
Well, it's a wise gambler
who knows when his luck has run out.

706
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,238
Why this?

707
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:21,824
In my business, you prepare for
the unexpected.

708
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,868
And what business is that?

709
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:27,788
I help people with problems.

710
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,748
Problem solver?

711
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,750
More of a problem eliminator.

712
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:47,266
And now you're here on business?

713
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,226
No. Temporarily unemployed.

714
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,856
I thought I might find work here.

715
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,109
Well, it's very difficult to obtain
a work permit in Isthmus.

716
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,902
It's. . .

717
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:03,282
Well, one has to show a special
talent that people here don't have.

718
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:08,245
Well, that shouldn't be too difficult.

719
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,958
Senor Bond, you got big cojones.

720
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:19,756
You come here to my place,
without references, carrying a piece,

721
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,800
throwing around a lot of money.

722
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,886
But you should know something. . .

723
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:28,307
Nobody saw you come in,
so nobody has to see you go out.

724
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:36,982
Senor Sanchez, I could be very useful
to a man in your position.

725
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,734
And I understand you have a reputation

726
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,653
for rewarding loyalty very well.

727
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:48,911
I'll keep this for a few days.
We'll talk again.

728
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,914
And you won't need a gun in Isthmus.

729
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,415
It's a very safe city.

730
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:57,169
In the meantime, I welcome you to
the casino at all times.

731
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,097
Check him out.

732
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,143
So what did you find out?

733
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,520
He's sitting up there
behind two inches of armored glass.

734
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:18,023
I'd need a cannon to get to him.

735
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:37,709
Senor Bond, you'll be pleased to
know your uncle has arrived.

736
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,795
I put him in your suite.

737
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:44,007
- Thank you.
- Good night, senor.

738
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,846
Your uncle?

739
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:52,140
Let's make this a proper family reunion.

740
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,684
Give me a gun.

741
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,292
Stay here.

742
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:39,813
Really, 007.

743
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:43,275
Q! What the hell are you doing here?
I might have killed you!

744
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,068
Well, I'm on leave.

745
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:48,196
Thought I'd pop around and
see how you're getting on.

746
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,323
- You all right?
- Yes, of course I'm all right.

747
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:52,367
- How'd you find me?
- Well, Moneypenny, of course.

748
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,327
She's worried sick about you!

749
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:56,204
This is no place for you, Q.
Go home.

750
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,040
Don't be an idiot, 007.

751
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,791
I know exactly what you're up to.

752
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,960
And quite frankly,
you're gonna need my help.

753
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,087
Remember, if it hadn't
been for Q Branch,

754
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:06,214
you'd have been dead long ago.

755
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,800
Everything for a man on holiday.

756
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:11,261
Explosive alarm clock.

757
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:15,015
Guaranteed never to wake up
anybody who uses it.

758
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:19,144
Dentonite toothpaste,
to be used sparingly.

759
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,313
It's the latest in plastic explosive.

760
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:22,939
I could do with some plastic.

761
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:30,530
I thought there might be
a mess to clean up.

762
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:32,365
Pam, this is Q, my uncle.

763
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:35,243
Uncle, this is Miss Kennedy,
my cousin.

764
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,912
We must be related.

765
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,998
- How do you do?
- Now, pay attention, 007.

766
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:45,378
Now, this looks like
an ordinary camera, doesn't it?

767
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:47,047
What kind of film does it take, 120?

768
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,633
No, .220, high-velocity.

769
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:57,557
Now, this is a signature gun,
and that is an optical palm reader.

770
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:03,688
And if I plug this into the bottom
like that, once I've programmed it. . .

771
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,737
Now, nobody can use the gun but you.

772
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:12,197
Smile, boys.

773
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,448
Don't use the flash!

774
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,415
Stop fiddling about with things
you don't understand!

775
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,834
You might easily have killed him.

776
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,418
That's odd.

777
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,132
Look, let's all get
some rest, shall we?

778
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:34,136
We've got a long, hard day
ahead of us tomorrow.

779
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,637
BOND: Good night, Q.

780
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,556
Sweet dreams, Mr. Bond.

781
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,522
I hope you don't snore, Q.

782
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:53,947
You all know Truman-Lodge,

783
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:57,659
and this is my head of security,
Colonel Heller.

784
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,077
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

785
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,915
This is an historic moment.

786
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,168
East meets West.

787
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,670
Drug dealers of the world, unite.

788
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,927
Extra bonus.
Your job's done.

789
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,679
Take Q and fly out of here now.

790
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,015
I'll make my own way back.

791
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,641
I'd like to stay.

792
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,437
No. I work better alone.

793
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:51,922
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

794
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:46,810
In this business,
there's a lot of cash,

795
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:49,813
and with a lot of people
with their hands out.

796
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,773
In a word, bribery.

797
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:53,775
Exactly.

798
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,777
He took the words
right out of my pocket.

799
01:16:58,072 --> 01:16:59,739
SANCHEZ: So you pay.

800
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,200
Everyone and his brother
is on the payroll.

801
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:09,457
So you buy a mayor,
a chief of police, a general,

802
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,131
presidents.

803
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:19,301
One day you wake up,
you own the whole goddamn country.

804
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:20,969
Then you take what you want.

805
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:25,056
Bank, a gambling casino,
airline concession.

806
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,641
Why?

807
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:32,230
Simple. It's easier for the politicians
to take silver than lead.

808
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:36,735
We have an invisible empire
from Chile to Alaska.

809
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:43,616
What I want to do, amigos,
is to make you part of it.

810
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:47,203
I want the Pacific
to be our little puddle.

811
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:53,084
What you have before you, gentlemen,
is a demographic report,

812
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,421
breaking down each
of your territories

813
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,841
by age and socioeconomic group.

814
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:04,387
Now, as you can clearly see,
there is a huge potential demand,

815
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:07,849
given the implementation
of aggressive marketing.

816
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,851
As in the United States,

817
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:14,939
Senor Sanchez is prepared to offer
each of you exclusive franchises.

818
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:19,527
The price is $100
million per territory.

819
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:26,284
I believe you'll find that works out
to $20 million per metric ton, Mr. Tan.

820
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:49,682
We guarantee quality
and price for five years.

821
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,811
Senor Sanchez,

822
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,688
since arriving, we've eaten well,

823
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,774
heard many good stories,

824
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:01,820
but before I pay anything,
I want to see some hardware.

825
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:06,908
Mr. Kwang,
you don't pay for hardware.

826
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:10,662
You pay for my personal
guarantee and protection.

827
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,581
Surely, if you were
to invest $100 million,

828
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,834
you would want some reassurance.

829
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,797
You know, you're right.
Why not?

830
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:24,384
Tomorrow, I'll take you to our
main distribution center.

831
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:31,015
Here you are.

832
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,894
Goodbye, Q.
Thanks for all you've done.

833
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:36,146
What?

834
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,941
You're a hell of a field operative.

835
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:42,235
Now, go. I'll see you
back in London.

836
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:52,537
No more business.

837
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:57,041
Gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.

838
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,085
Hi, there!

839
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,336
Hi! How are you?

840
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,893
This Kwang, he seems like trouble.

841
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:17,562
Why show them the labs?

842
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:21,441
Don't worry.
He won't expose the operation.

843
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:48,343
His Excellency,
el Presidente Lopez.

844
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:49,761
Hector.

845
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,180
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

846
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,364
There's been a mistake with my check.

847
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:12,242
Look at it.
It's half the usual amount.

848
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:15,703
You were very quiet when I was arrested.

849
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:21,000
Remember, you're
only President for life.

850
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:50,405
BOND: Watch the birdie,
you bastard.

851
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,173
KWANG: Take his arm.

852
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:58,222
Who'd have a signature gun?

853
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,141
James Bond.

854
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:05,938
This is the property of
Her Majesty's government.

855
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,106
How did you get it?

856
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:08,191
Piss off.

857
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:09,651
Who ordered you to kill Sanchez?

858
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,778
No one.
He's a rogue agent.

859
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:15,073
I've got orders to take him back,
one way or the other.

860
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,825
We're Hong Kong Narcotics,
you bastard!

861
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,912
Sanchez is taking us
to the heart of his operations.

862
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:23,581
I've been setting it up for years!

863
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:27,502
I just hope that little stunt
of yours hasn't scared him off.

864
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,383
Get me out of these bloody things.

865
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:36,803
No, Commander.
You're a loose cannon on deck.

866
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:39,263
I'm shipping you
straight back to London.

867
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,105
- Leave him!
- No!

868
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:48,439
Come on!

869
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:12,296
Don't let them take you alive.

870
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,008
He's still alive.

871
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:02,180
Who was it?
Who sent you?

872
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,643
Cyanide.

873
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:13,065
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

874
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:20,675
Hey, amigo!

875
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,685
How do you feel?

876
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,895
I'll survive.

877
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,314
Lupe, please.

878
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:43,197
The Wavekrest is arriving tonight.
Krest is coming here.

879
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:45,408
SANCHEZ: No, no, no,
I'll call you back.

880
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:46,868
Pedro, bring us
some coffee, por favor.

881
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,119
Good.

882
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:53,666
Baby, please?

883
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:07,972
Well, we both had
close calls last night.

884
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,348
You were just in time.

885
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,309
Things were about to turn nasty.

886
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:13,060
Who were those guys?

887
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:14,103
Freelance hit team.

888
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,771
What did they want with you?

889
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,817
One of them must have
recognized me in the casino.

890
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,948
They were afraid I'd warn
you, spoil their plans.

891
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:29,285
So you knew them?

892
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,203
I used to work for
the British government.

893
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,998
We kept dossiers on such people.

894
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:35,499
British agent.

895
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:36,918
(WAITER SPEAKING SPANISH)

896
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:38,461
I knew it.

897
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,883
You have class.

898
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,345
Those men tried to kill me.

899
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:50,097
Who would do such a thing?

900
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,515
Someone close to you.

901
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,892
Cream? Sugar?

902
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,311
No.

903
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:57,271
Did they tell you this?

904
01:27:57,356 --> 01:28:01,108
They were well-briefed, obviously
by someone on the inside.

905
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:04,695
Did they mention a name?

906
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,863
No.

907
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,787
Only that they were expecting
to be paid a great deal of cash

908
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:15,581
by someone arriving in Isthmus tonight.

909
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:19,919
You suspect someone?

910
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:24,590
Everyone in my organization
is 100% loyal.

911
01:28:24,675 --> 01:28:25,967
Then you have nothing to worry about.

912
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:28,928
Yeah, well, I have
to go meet some people.

913
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:32,264
Why don't you rest here?

914
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:33,808
No. I have to go back to my hotel.

915
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:38,187
No. Don't go to the hotel.
Save your money. I insist.

916
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:41,273
Stay here.
Enjoy my hospitality.

917
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:43,901
Lupe, show him the
easy way up, please.

918
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,255
You are not gonna
believe who this guy is.

919
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,386
Former British agent.

920
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:11,929
How did you know that?

921
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:13,556
Because I know things.

922
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:18,519
I want to meet Krest's boat tonight.

923
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,312
We'll need a dozen reliable men.

924
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:23,024
Is there a problem with Krest?

925
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:26,485
We'll see. And bring Lupe.
She was there.

926
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,946
He's not gonna lie in front of her.

927
01:29:32,743 --> 01:29:34,243
What are you doing?

928
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,370
I've had my fill of
Sanchez's hospitality.

929
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:38,789
He told you to stay.
You're asking for big trouble.

930
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:41,042
Look, there's no need
for you to get involved.

931
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,044
Just give me five minutes,
then scream your head off.

932
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,712
James, please, listen to me.

933
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,255
There's guards all over the place.

934
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:47,548
You'll never make it.

935
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:18,996
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

936
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:22,416
I'm going shopping.
I won't be long.

937
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:24,126
Please don't. Not now.

938
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:25,711
Senor Sanchez said.

939
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:45,231
I haven't had one of
these in five years.

940
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:48,692
Don't worry.
007 always comes back.

941
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,156
James, hi.

942
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:55,324
I thought I told you to leave, Q.

943
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:58,244
We couldn't go without knowing
what had happened to you.

944
01:30:58,328 --> 01:30:59,578
Get your bags packed, Q.

945
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:01,580
What the hell is
the matter with you?

946
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:03,332
Just a couple of things.

947
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:05,584
Kwang and his team
of British agents are dead.

948
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:07,211
Sanchez is alive.

949
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,296
I saw you in Heller's office.

950
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:11,132
- You're working with them.
- No.

951
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,802
- I want the truth.
- I am telling the truth.

952
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:18,556
Sanchez has arranged to buy four
Stinger missiles from the Contras,

953
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,641
and he's threatened to
shoot down an American airliner

954
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:22,017
if the DEA doesn't lay off.

955
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,811
What's that got to
do with you and Heller?

956
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:26,230
Felix gave me a letter at his wedding
from the Attorney General

957
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:29,775
granting Heller immunity
if he gets the Stingers back.

958
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:33,571
Did he go for the deal?

959
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:35,948
Yes.

960
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,910
And then you missed Sanchez,

961
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:42,997
and Heller panicked and
he said the deal was off,

962
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:47,751
and that I was dead
if he ever saw me again.

963
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:51,046
There's more to this
than your personal vendetta.

964
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,137
It's a mess.

965
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:03,184
Sanchez has tripled his security.

966
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,563
You'll never get another shot at him.

967
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,112
We don't have to.

968
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:20,034
Meet me at the harbor master's
office in two hours.

969
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:22,578
Q, bring the Rolls round to
the front of the hotel.

970
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:24,288
Yes, sir.

971
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,042
Senor Bond.

972
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:30,920
Senor Montelongo,
I'm making a withdrawal.

973
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:51,857
Pilot coming aboard, sir.

974
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,905
Well?
Take me to the bridge.

975
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,413
Gracias, Captain.
I'll take over now.

976
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:09,124
You? You're the harbor pilot?

977
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:11,418
No, I'm his secretary!

978
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:13,712
All yours, sir. . .
Ma'am.

979
01:33:29,688 --> 01:33:32,022
Do you think you're
going in a bit too fast?

980
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:35,025
You wanna do the driving?
You take the wheel.

981
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:46,704
Full speed astern.

982
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,795
What the hell are you doing?

983
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,130
Check the forward component!

984
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:57,589
Harbor pilot went crazy.

985
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:34,335
I'd stick to flying if I were you.

986
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,086
I got the job done.

987
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,851
Franz, what a surprise!

988
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:52,686
I didn't think you'd be here.

989
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:54,855
Yeah. I like surprises.

990
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:02,863
You seem to be having
a lot of problems lately.

991
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:06,950
Well, we had this crazy harbor pilot.

992
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:09,703
Let's talk about the money you owe me.

993
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:12,956
Why don't we talk inside.

994
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:22,091
- Does he have a safe?
- Not up here. Maybe below.

995
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,761
Have a look around.

996
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:39,858
Do I have this right?

997
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:42,694
He water-skied
behind the plane, jumps on it. . .

998
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:46,323
No, no. He was. . .

999
01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:47,574
Well, yeah.

1000
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:49,660
He threw the pilots out and flew away.

1001
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:53,038
Like a little bird.

1002
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:04,842
The knife.

1003
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,777
Pedro.

1004
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:42,504
Would I make up a story like that?
You must have seen something.

1005
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:57,352
- Where's 007?
- He's coming.

1006
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:13,994
That's not my money.
I swear.

1007
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:17,247
That's right, amigo.
It's mine.

1008
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:24,338
You think I'm stupid, huh?

1009
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:28,592
You rip me off, then use my own money
to pay someone to kill me?

1010
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:31,637
You want it so bad?
Then take it!

1011
01:37:34,724 --> 01:37:36,391
What are you doing?

1012
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:41,104
Wait. Let me talk.
It's not my money!

1013
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:48,445
No! What the. . .

1014
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:50,697
That hurts. Please!

1015
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:58,705
What are you doing?

1016
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,290
Sanchez.

1017
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:11,760
Please, Franz. No!

1018
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,486
What about the money, patron?

1019
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:33,073
Launder it.

1020
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,675
This is where you leave.

1021
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,927
Take the plane. I'll
see you both in Miami.

1022
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:55,429
Aren't you coming?

1023
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:59,099
No. They'll be after me.
It'll be safer on my own.

1024
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:13,572
Come on, my dear.

1025
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:24,541
See you later.

1026
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:30,339
What's that?

1027
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:31,882
- Bond's clothes.
- They're clean.

1028
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:52,361
Sorry to wake you, hermano.

1029
01:39:57,533 --> 01:40:01,328
I thought you'd like to know
the information you gave me paid off.

1030
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:03,747
I got the guy who set me up.

1031
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,208
Only one guy?

1032
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:07,834
What do you mean?

1033
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:10,212
I just thought that

1034
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:14,925
no one would be stupid enough
to try to take you on on their own.

1035
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:27,604
Listen, I want you to
come with me tomorrow.

1036
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:30,399
Where are we going?

1037
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,276
It's a surprise.
You're gonna like it.

1038
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:50,627
James, what are you doing back here?

1039
01:40:50,712 --> 01:40:52,879
I don't think your being
here's a good idea, Lupe.

1040
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:57,008
It's all right. Franz
is having dinner with the Chinese.

1041
01:40:58,219 --> 01:40:59,761
Do you know where
he's taking me tomorrow?

1042
01:40:59,846 --> 01:41:01,596
He's showing them a special place.

1043
01:41:01,723 --> 01:41:03,473
I don't know where.

1044
01:41:03,558 --> 01:41:07,519
James, don't go. I'm scared.
What's gonna happen to us?

1045
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:08,812
Don't worry.

1046
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:11,148
When this is all over,
I'll make sure you get back home.

1047
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:14,067
Home? It took me 15 years
to get away from there.

1048
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:16,987
I don't wanna go back.

1049
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,573
Can't we leave together?

1050
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:21,158
I'll be safe with you.

1051
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:30,000
No, Lupe. I don't think
that would work out.

1052
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,335
How can we tell unless we try?

1053
01:41:39,886 --> 01:41:42,554
I think it's gonna work out very well.

1054
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:51,688
All right.
I'll answer it.

1055
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,695
Miss Kennedy, I saw you
at the casino with James.

1056
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:01,198
We need to speak in private.

1057
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:02,574
It's all right.
He's with me.

1058
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:05,327
James is in danger.
Sanchez is no fool.

1059
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:10,040
He's checking up on him. You know,
if they find anything suspicious. . .

1060
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:12,626
Listen, it's all right.
He's safely out of the country by now.

1061
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:13,919
You don't understand.

1062
01:42:14,003 --> 01:42:15,587
Last night, he stayed with me.

1063
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:21,176
At Sanchez's house?

1064
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,136
Si. Franz is taking him on a trip.

1065
01:42:23,221 --> 01:42:25,305
They leave in an hour.
You must help him.

1066
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:28,016
If anything happens to him,
I don't know what I'll do.

1067
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,976
You know, I love James so much.

1068
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:32,312
Look, you must go before you're missed.

1069
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:36,316
Now, don't worry.
We'll think of something.

1070
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:41,196
"I love James so much."
I'll be damned if I'll help him.

1071
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:44,491
Look, don't judge him
too harshly, my dear.

1072
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:47,744
Field operatives must often use
every means at their disposal

1073
01:42:47,829 --> 01:42:50,455
to achieve their objectives.

1074
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,832
Bullshit.

1075
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:08,515
Bond's just left in convoy.
Two cars and a Jeep,

1076
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,433
turning north onto the main highway.

1077
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:12,727
I copy that, Q.
Over and out.

1078
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:24,656
What are you doing to my plane?

1079
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:27,951
Overhaul.
Senor Sanchez order it.

1080
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:33,582
I must have a plane.
Where can I rent one?

1081
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:36,585
No planes.

1082
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:48,763
SANCHEZ: You brought the
Stingers, manito.

1083
01:43:48,848 --> 01:43:51,141
From now on, I want them close to me.

1084
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:22,839
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

1085
01:44:22,924 --> 01:44:25,133
We started this place
strictly as a cover,

1086
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:29,012
but Professor Joe manages
to turn a tidy profit.

1087
01:44:52,662 --> 01:44:54,871
MAN: Welcome.
This way, please.

1088
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:59,167
I'm going to have to ask that
each of you put on one of these.

1089
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:04,089
It's for your own safety,
so I'm sure you'll understand.

1090
01:45:04,173 --> 01:45:09,135
We can't have our best customers
developing a drug habit.

1091
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:12,138
This way, gentlemen.

1092
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:54,514
Our product dissolves completely
in ordinary gasoline,

1093
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:57,475
making it absolutely undetectable.

1094
01:46:02,314 --> 01:46:03,565
How do you get it back?

1095
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:09,779
Hey, you want us to tell you
all our secrets before we're partners?

1096
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,364
Take them to the lab.

1097
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:13,074
This way, gentlemen.

1098
01:46:24,086 --> 01:46:25,462
Who's the new guy?

1099
01:46:25,546 --> 01:46:27,964
Somebody I thought could be useful.

1100
01:46:35,848 --> 01:46:37,140
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1101
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:41,811
Can I help you?

1102
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:44,022
I have a special surprise
for Professor Joe.

1103
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:45,565
Sorry. No visitors this week.

1104
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,984
I came all the way from Wichita Falls.

1105
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:50,236
I'm sorry. The folks back home
took up a collection.

1106
01:46:50,321 --> 01:46:53,031
They'd be so disappointed if
Professor Joe didn't accept it personally.

1107
01:46:55,451 --> 01:46:59,537
You may remove your masks now, gentlemen.

1108
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:01,956
So, do we have a deal?

1109
01:47:05,294 --> 01:47:07,087
TRUMAN-LODGE:
The terms, gentlemen,

1110
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:10,924
were $100 million in negotiable bearer
bonds from each of you.

1111
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:13,676
Welcome.

1112
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:25,313
Professor Joe.
It's really you!

1113
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,068
It's magnificent.

1114
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:34,781
Rebuilt stone for stone and
restored to all of its original glory.

1115
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:35,907
Is this for me?

1116
01:47:35,991 --> 01:47:38,618
Yes, I almost forgot.
I got so flustered. . .

1117
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:44,207
Tell me, child, have you ever
thought of studying here?

1118
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:45,792
Would that be possible?

1119
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:48,419
Come along. Let's see if you
have the aptitude.

1120
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:51,965
To a long association.

1121
01:47:52,049 --> 01:47:53,091
What's the process?

1122
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:54,300
SANCHEZ: It's very simple.

1123
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:57,262
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1124
01:47:57,346 --> 01:48:02,559
An 18% mixture of cocaine
and ordinary gasoline.

1125
01:48:02,643 --> 01:48:04,269
Just keep quiet.

1126
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:31,880
We already have your first shipment
being loaded into the four tanker trucks.

1127
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,215
Welcome, my dear.

1128
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:37,886
Please join me.

1129
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:41,222
Wow.

1130
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:47,061
This is my humble sanctuary away
from the cares of the world.

1131
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:50,481
Your own private meditation chamber.

1132
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:53,860
Built from the sacred rocks
of the original temple.

1133
01:48:57,448 --> 01:49:02,410
I did have it soundproofed,
so nothing will disturb our meditation.

1134
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:08,958
I brought you another surprise.

1135
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:10,960
I love surprises.
Where is it?

1136
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:24,474
Look, this really isn't necessary.

1137
01:49:27,144 --> 01:49:28,811
Give me the keys.

1138
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:43,952
Bless your heart.

1139
01:49:44,453 --> 01:49:47,705
Your monthly delivery will be
by ocean-going tanker.

1140
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:53,127
We'll send our chief chemist along
to supervise the reconversion process.

1141
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:57,548
You'll keep the gas as a bonus.

1142
01:49:57,633 --> 01:50:01,386
And if there's a problem
with customs, no evidence.

1143
01:50:14,984 --> 01:50:16,526
Come on, hurry!

1144
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:25,827
I know him.
He's an informer.

1145
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:30,415
You disappoint me.

1146
01:50:30,499 --> 01:50:34,669
Who are you working for, huh?
Tell me.

1147
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:41,175
You don't wanna talk?

1148
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:59,652
I can get the trucks out,
but I don't think I can control the fire.

1149
01:50:59,737 --> 01:51:01,612
Forget the fire.
Get some cars.

1150
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:03,448
We're gonna take the tankers with us.

1151
01:51:03,532 --> 01:51:06,492
Wait a minute. This setup cost
us $32 million.

1152
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:07,952
We have to try and save it.

1153
01:51:08,037 --> 01:51:09,787
I don't give a shit about the setup.

1154
01:51:09,872 --> 01:51:11,998
We've got $500 million
in the case and

1155
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:14,375
20 tons of Colombian
pure in the tankers.

1156
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,585
Now go help Heller.

1157
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:18,755
But we have a deal with the Orientals.
We've got their money.

1158
01:51:18,839 --> 01:51:20,506
I said go help Heller.

1159
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:30,516
Now, do you wanna
make this hard or easy?

1160
01:51:35,898 --> 01:51:37,857
Put him in the conveyor.

1161
01:51:49,453 --> 01:51:50,828
When you're up to your ankles,

1162
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:52,872
you're gonna beg to tell me everything.

1163
01:51:52,956 --> 01:51:56,793
When you're up to your knees,
you'll kiss my ass to kill you.

1164
01:52:01,799 --> 01:52:03,591
I'm the least of
your problems, Sanchez.

1165
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:06,803
If you couldn't trust Krest,
who can you trust?

1166
01:52:10,265 --> 01:52:12,350
Who's got your $500 million?

1167
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:13,976
Truman-Lodge?

1168
01:52:17,356 --> 01:52:19,357
What about the Stingers?

1169
01:52:23,278 --> 01:52:24,946
What do you know about Stingers?

1170
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:31,077
We gotta go, patron.
This place'll blow up any second.

1171
01:52:31,161 --> 01:52:32,120
Where's Heller?

1172
01:52:32,204 --> 01:52:33,246
I don't know.

1173
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:36,833
That's the last you'll see
of Heller and your Stingers.

1174
01:52:41,338 --> 01:52:43,214
Thanks for the advice.

1175
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:59,313
Have my car meet me up at the top.
Braun, come with me.

1176
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:39,228
You're dead.

1177
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:42,064
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

1178
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:54,619
DARIO: Sanchez!

1179
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,754
Are you all right?

1180
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:06,756
Switch the bloody machine off.

1181
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:24,398
Hey. I was making
sure these were secure.

1182
01:54:24,483 --> 01:54:28,194
It's a good idea.
Take them up to my car.

1183
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:29,820
Of course.

1184
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:16,367
Oh God, it's Heller.

1185
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:18,369
Yeah. Looks like he
came to a dead end.

1186
01:55:18,453 --> 01:55:19,704
Come on.

1187
01:55:34,469 --> 01:55:35,970
Come on! Come on! Follow me!

1188
01:55:44,563 --> 01:55:46,272
You. Come with me.

1189
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:06,459
Come on.

1190
01:56:22,017 --> 01:56:23,434
Surprise!

1191
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,188
Bless your heart!

1192
01:58:01,283 --> 01:58:03,868
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1193
01:58:14,963 --> 01:58:15,963
Perez.

1194
01:58:17,007 --> 01:58:18,424
Bond has escaped.

1195
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:19,884
Meet me at Paso del Diablo.

1196
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:27,683
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1197
01:59:10,644 --> 01:59:13,270
SANCHEZ: Don't worry.
It's only money.

1198
01:59:38,255 --> 01:59:40,464
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1199
01:59:40,549 --> 01:59:41,924
Okay, que pase.

1200
02:01:35,413 --> 02:01:37,373
TRUMAN-LODGE: Oh, no.

1201
02:01:39,668 --> 02:01:41,043
Shit!

1202
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:56,100
Brilliant.

1203
02:01:56,184 --> 02:01:57,977
Well done, Franz.

1204
02:01:58,061 --> 02:02:01,981
Another $80 million write-off.

1205
02:02:02,065 --> 02:02:04,358
I guess it's time to
start cutting overhead.

1206
02:04:09,234 --> 02:04:11,485
Dame el Stinger!

1207
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:58,323
(EXCLAIMS IN SPANISH)

1208
02:05:12,839 --> 02:05:14,047
James!

1209
02:07:10,456 --> 02:07:11,915
You could have had everything.

1210
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,959
Don't you want to know why?

1211
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:16,188
What are you waiting for?
Get in.

1212
02:08:17,774 --> 02:08:19,066
Yes, sir.

1213
02:08:31,913 --> 02:08:33,872
BOND: I'll be up to see you next week.
We'll do some fishing.

1214
02:08:33,956 --> 02:08:36,458
Good. I'll be out by then. M called.

1215
02:08:36,542 --> 02:08:40,045
He tried to reach you.
I think he may have a job for you.

1216
02:08:40,129 --> 02:08:43,256
Look, Felix, I have to go.
My hostess has just arrived.

1217
02:08:43,341 --> 02:08:44,341
Take care, James.

1218
02:08:44,425 --> 02:08:46,093
You, too. Goodbye.

1219
02:08:49,013 --> 02:08:50,263
I thought you hated that thing.

1220
02:08:50,348 --> 02:08:53,850
Don't you know, iguanas
are a girl's best friend.

1221
02:09:01,317 --> 02:09:03,485
Well, here's to you, my dear.

1222
02:09:03,569 --> 02:09:05,028
Cheers.

1223
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:08,907
Thank you for everything, James.

1224
02:09:12,161 --> 02:09:13,662
Thank you.

1225
02:09:26,134 --> 02:09:28,385
You could stay here with me.

1226
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:30,762
