1
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:47,669
<i>This yacht is bringing a revolutionary</i>
<i>scientific invention to Gotham City.</i>

2
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,756
<i>On a peaceful motor ride,</i>
<i>millionaire Bruce Wayne...</i>

3
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:56,888
<i>... and his ward, Dick Grayson,</i>
<i>have been summoned to Wayne Manor...</i>

4
00:02:57,136 --> 00:03:01,057
<i>... by an urgent but anonymous</i>
<i>call for help.</i>

5
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:06,229
<i>The invention and its custodian</i>
<i>are reported in grave danger...</i>

6
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,273
<i>... aboard the yacht.</i>

7
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:11,192
<i>Never ones</i>
<i>to shirk responsibility...</i>

8
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:16,072
<i>... Bruce and Dick, with</i>
<i>characteristic speed and resolve...</i>

9
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,284
<i>... descend promptly to the Batcave.</i>

10
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:23,454
<i>And then, as they have done</i>
<i>many times before...</i>

11
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:28,835
<i>... as Batman and Robin,</i>
<i>courageous warriors against crime...</i>

12
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:33,131
<i>... they are off, once again,</i>
<i>to the rescue.</i>

13
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,302
Batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.

14
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:39,929
Roger. Ready to move out.

15
00:03:56,487 --> 00:04:00,950
Batmobile to airport, red alert.
Prepare Batcopter for takeoff.

16
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,763
Batmobile approaching.

17
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:27,352
<i>Red Alert! Gotham Tower to all</i>
<i>aircraft in the control zone.</i>

18
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:32,982
<i>Enter your holding pattern.</i>
<i>Batcopter cleared for takeoff.</i>

19
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,779
It's good to know
they're up there doing their job.

20
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,095
Batdrift angle: 03 to starboard.

21
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,931
Roger. Correcting to port.

22
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:56,941
Altitude: 317. Sink rate: 0.49.

23
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:06,618
- Drop Bat ladder.
- Bat ladder away.

24
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:31,017
Lock computer on afterdeck.
Set automatic Bathold.

25
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,901
Watch out. This could be tricky.

26
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:46,616
Have no fear. I'll keep all my wits
about me. So long, for a minute.

27
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,943
Batman to Robin,
ease off on the power!

28
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,201
Increase sink rate!

29
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,289
Roger! Wilco!

30
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,851
Take her up!

31
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,027
Holy sardine!

32
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,922
Hand me down
the shark-repellent Bat spray!

33
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,824
- Enough pictures.
- This press conference must be brief.

34
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:37,996
- You're lucky they'll talk to you.
- Mr. Merrick of <i>The Gotham City Times.</i>

35
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:42,709
A yacht approaching the city
is said to have disappeared.

36
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:47,005
- Nonsense. How can a yacht disappear?
- It isn't true?

37
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:50,842
I stand on my answer.
Mr. Stanley of <i>The Globe.</i>

38
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:55,221
This yacht belonged
to the famous Big Ben Distilleries.

39
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,266
Isn't the proprietor,
Commodore Schmidlapp...

40
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:02,103
...bringing a new invention
from Big Ben's lab?

41
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:06,357
- No more questions about that ship.
- What about that shark?

42
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:10,987
An unfortunate animal who chanced
to swallow a floating mine.

43
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:14,574
I wouldn't worry about that.
You there, Miss...

44
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:19,204
Comrade Kitanya Irenya Tatanya
Karenska Alisoff.

45
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:20,997
From <i>The Moscow Bugle.</i>

46
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,126
You grace us with your presence.
May I be of service?

47
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:29,130
Please, take off the mask
to give the better picture.

48
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:33,301
- Batman take off his mask?
- The woman must be mad.

49
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:35,720
Please, Chief O'Hara, all of you.

50
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:40,934
This young lady is a stranger.
Her request is not unnatural...

51
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:44,729
...however, impossible to grant.

52
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,940
- Impossible?
- Indeed.

53
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:53,488
If we were to remove our masks,
our true identities would be revealed.

54
00:10:53,988 --> 00:11:00,078
- Ruining their value as crime fighters.
- Not even we know who they are.

55
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,957
In fact, our own relatives don't know.

56
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:07,335
But your so curious costumes...

57
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:11,965
Don't be put off by them.
Under this we're ordinary Americans.

58
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:15,677
You're like the masked vigilantes
in the Westerns?

59
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:19,764
Batman and Robin are
deputized agents of the law!

60
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:24,060
- "Support your police" is our message.
- Well said, Robin.

61
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,146
And no better way to end
this conference.

62
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:30,692
- Thank you and good day.
- Batman...

63
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:35,530
Never mind, everybody out.
Come on, we're all busy here.

64
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:38,867
A fine job. You allayed their fears.

65
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:42,370
If I'd told the truth,
panic would grip the city.

66
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:45,373
The truth. And what is the truth?

67
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,626
A decoy. An anonymous warning...

68
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:52,547
...that Schmidlapp's in danger,
to lure me into a trap.

69
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,340
An attempt on his life.

70
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:57,927
While they were luring you
to a watery grave...

71
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,346
...the yacht was being hijacked?

72
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,474
- Precisely!
- And who behind it?

73
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:07,187
What known super criminals
are at large now?

74
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:09,480
I'll check at once, Batman.

75
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:14,736
Let's have the latest status report
on criminals at large. Thank you.

76
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:18,114
Coming up on
the closed-circuit TV screen.

77
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:28,291
<i>Status report. Known super criminals</i>
<i>not currently imprisoned.</i>

78
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,584
The Penguin.

79
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:33,963
That pompous waddling
master of foul play.

80
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:38,801
- The Joker!
- Devilish clown prince of crime!

81
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,347
If I had a nickel
for every time he baffled us!

82
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:45,683
The Riddler loose too?

83
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:50,563
So it seems.
To plague us with his conundrums.

84
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:55,193
- Gosh, and the Catwoman!
<i>- End of status report.</i>

85
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:59,739
Could be any one of them,
but which one?

86
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:02,075
Which ones?

87
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:06,246
Pretty fishy what happened to me
on that ladder.

88
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:11,251
- Where there's a fish, there's Penguin.
- Wait! It happened at sea.

89
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:14,087
See? "C" for Catwoman!

90
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:19,551
Yet, that exploding shark
was pulling my leg.

91
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,347
- The Joker!
- It all adds up to a sinister riddle.

92
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,101
Riddle-er. Riddler?

93
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:31,396
A thought strikes me.

94
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:35,859
So dreadful I scarcely dare
give it utterance.

95
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:40,280
The four of them.
Their forces combined.

96
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:43,950
- Holy nightmare!
- Batman, could it be?

97
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,244
I don't know.

98
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,874
But I think I know
where to find a clue.

99
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:56,254
Robin, to the Batcave!
We haven't one moment to lose!

100
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,464
Ahoy, Catwoman.

101
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:44,636
How many times have I told you?
Never use my real name in public!

102
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:55,230
You and your trained exploding shark!

103
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:58,858
How should I know they'd have a can...

104
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:03,571
...of shark-repellent Bat spray?
You sniveling sardine!

105
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,282
You pompous puffed-up penguin!

106
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:11,538
Friends, make peace.
Have a shake on me.

107
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:15,291
A joke a day keeps the gloom away!

108
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,962
Sic them, Hecate,
scratch out their eyes.

109
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:25,009
- Take away that ravenous panther!
- I'll feed him to the birds.

110
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,054
I'll incapacitate it
with my trick confetti!

111
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:32,433
"United Underworld."
We're about as united...

112
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:36,187
...as the members
of the United World headquarters.

113
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,524
- What's the matter with you all?
- She's right.

114
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:44,696
If we don't manage to swallow
our super-criminal pride...

115
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:47,699
Right, Mr. Riddler, quite right!

116
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,536
We must hang together,
or we shall hang separately.

117
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:57,667
What a pity that would be on the eve
of the greatest criminal coup ever!

118
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:03,381
- How did it go, Catwoman?
- Purr-fectly. Purr-fectly.

119
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:09,470
In my disguise as Kitka,
I penetrated their press conference.

120
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:13,099
- The fools are completely baffled.
- But undrowned.

121
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:16,186
Yes, unfortunately.

122
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:19,939
Batman's boots didn't even look damp!

123
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,068
Our prisoner still doesn't know
he's kidnapped?

124
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:29,741
He hasn't the foggiest.
He just keeps ringing for his tea.

125
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:34,412
- There he goes again.
- Take it to him, man.

126
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,590
Come in.

127
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,927
Your tea, commodore.

128
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:53,264
Thank you, steward.
Good service aboard this yacht.

129
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:56,851
We strive to give satisfaction, sir.

130
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,188
Your face has the most ghastly pallor.

131
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:02,857
Are you getting enough sea air?

132
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:06,069
My duties keep me mostly undercover.

133
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:07,946
Too bad, too bad.

134
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:12,367
How much longer will this yacht
be fogbound off the Grand Banks?

135
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,786
I couldn't say, sir.

136
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,998
Well, gives me a chance
to catch up on my Dickens.

137
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,126
Still, I'd like to get to Gotham City.

138
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:27,131
I've a clever invention
with me, stored in the hold.

139
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:31,052
Should be worth
millions of dollars, pip-pip!

140
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:37,100
Well, pip-pip to you, sir! If you
wish anything further, just ring!

141
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:56,077
Schmidlapp's invention in our hands...

142
00:17:56,327 --> 00:18:01,040
...the whole world almost literally
in our grasp!

143
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:06,087
And Batman and Robin
still alive to block us.

144
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,508
Everything pip-pip with the prisoner!
He hasn't a clue.

145
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:12,969
- I bet the Dynamic Duo has.
- What?

146
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,889
A clue on how we made
that ship disappear.

147
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:19,893
- And when they solve it...
- They'll be out to investigate.

148
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:24,022
But we'll be there first.
If we hurry, that is.

149
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,108
Catwoman, you tend
to this headquarters.

150
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:31,112
- Attention, you unfathomable finks!
- Yo-ho!

151
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:34,741
Call down to
our secret river-bottom dock.

152
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:37,535
- Prepare our submarine for sea.
- Yo-ho!

153
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:40,079
- Yo-ho what?
- Sir!

154
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:48,838
Holy Merlin magician!
Get set for a shock.

155
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:53,259
The Batcamera was aimed at the yacht.

156
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:56,971
- My strange hunch was right.
- I don't get it...

157
00:18:57,222 --> 00:19:00,350
Think! As you remarked,
no one can make...

158
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,478
...a seagoing vessel
simply disappear.

159
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:08,191
Provided it was ever
really there at all.

160
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:10,568
- You mean...?
- Precisely!

161
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:14,822
The yacht we thought we saw
was a mere illusion.

162
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:19,536
A tricky projection akin
to the common desert mirage.

163
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:22,247
It deceived our naked eyes...

164
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:25,625
...but was blocked
by the Batcamera's Batfilter!

165
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,336
I know where
that projection came from.

166
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:33,007
- Observe that bell buoy.
- What about it?

167
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:38,012
The coordinates of our position
were 10.3 by 69-B.

168
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:42,642
Feed those figures into
the navigational aid computer.

169
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:54,404
No legal bell buoy at that position.

170
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:58,950
As I surmised, an illegal projection
buoy cleverly camouflaged.

171
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:01,452
Maybe the crooks left fingerprints!

172
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:06,207
Good thinking, let's find out.
To the Batboat, fast!

173
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,140
One thing I don't dig, Batman.

174
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:08,102
If that ship was a mirage,
where's the real one?

175
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:13,608
Taken to some secret island hideaway
with every soul aboard, save one.

176
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:16,110
- Commodore Schmidlapp?
- Precisely.

177
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:19,822
For some reason
the hijackers needed him...

178
00:21:20,031 --> 00:21:24,202
...or his invention
as part of their criminal scheme.

179
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:31,417
Keep an eye on the scope.
Watch for suspicious vessels.

180
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,881
It looks like we've got
the whole ocean to ourselves.

181
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:53,773
Diving planes, Mr. Bluebeard,
three degrees.

182
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:55,525
Hoist three degrees.

183
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,987
I hope you know
what you're doing, Penguin.

184
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:04,033
Mr. Riddler, I ignore
your insipid insinuation, sir!

185
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,663
Mr. Joker, you're leaning
on the control!

186
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:11,916
Don't sound so bossy, if you please!

187
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,877
As the poet says:

188
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:19,048
"On land, you may command.
At sea, it is me!"

189
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,100
Now hear this. This is your captain
speaking, my fine pinioned pirates.

190
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,564
We're approaching the buoy.
There may be skullduggery ahead!

191
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,949
- Yo-ho!
- What? What?

192
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,496
Unidentified small craft, bearing 113.

193
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:54,083
Mr. Bluebeard, hold her steady!
Up periscope!

194
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:25,198
Great quivering icebergs!
Just as I hoped.

195
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:28,827
Watch your step.

196
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,083
An underwater shark cage.
The source of that fish.

197
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:39,170
What cruelty!
Stuffing a poor shark with deadly TNT!

198
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,382
Nothing's sacred to those devils.

199
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,176
Torpedoes! What are we waiting for?

200
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:49,180
Chain of command, Mr. Riddler.
The Penguin runs the ship.

201
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:53,309
Now hear this, Mr. Joker.
Load the torpedo tubes!

202
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,022
Load torpedo tubes!

203
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:04,529
Salt and corrosion.

204
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:09,534
The infamous old enemies of
the crime fighter. No prints here.

205
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:11,870
Look here, Batman.

206
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:23,006
That tricky mirage projector
must be behind this plate.

207
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:32,515
Wow! What a set of superpower lenses!
No wonder we were fooled.

208
00:24:35,894 --> 00:24:37,604
Look, Robin.

209
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:42,817
Holy Long John Silver!
A pirate periscope!

210
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:46,529
He spotted us! Set torpedoes
to automatic homing.

211
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:49,657
Set torpedoes to automatic homing!

212
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:55,455
You crazy bird.
Fire them off, quickly!

213
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:02,337
Activate the remote control
Penguin magnet inside that buoy.

214
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,967
Holy glue pot! What's going on?

215
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:13,223
The fiends! They've converted
this buoy into a gigantic magnet!

216
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:17,852
It's got us by the metallic objects
in our utility belts.

217
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:21,439
Torpedo tubes armed!

218
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:26,152
Batman! We're helpless
in this monstrous, invisible grip!

219
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:31,199
- Steady, Robin. I see one hope.
- What, Batman?

220
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:37,497
If I could just pry loose
my utility belt transmitter!

221
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:43,378
- Mr. Joker, are you ready to fire?
- Yo-ho, ready to fire!

222
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:49,300
Five, four, three, two.

223
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,678
- Fire 1!
- Fire 1!

224
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,311
Torpedoes!

225
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:10,029
If I can just reverse the polarity,
send out waves of super energy.

226
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,585
- What happened?
- Mr. Joker, fire 2!

227
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:25,420
Fire 2!

228
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:33,094
Here comes another one!

229
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:46,107
You and your reconditioned
surplus torpedoes!

230
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:52,113
He must be using a super energy
reverse polarizer! Mr. Joker, fire 3!

231
00:26:52,614 --> 00:26:54,574
Fire 3!

232
00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:05,585
Here comes a third one!

233
00:27:13,092 --> 00:27:17,347
Confound it, the batteries are dead!

234
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:24,812
This one's getting through!

235
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:27,690
It is. It's getting through.

236
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:37,951
Surface, Mr. Bluebeard!

237
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,914
Let us feast our eyes
on the watery remains!

238
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:02,475
Gosh, the nobility
of the almost-human porpoise.

239
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:06,563
True, Robin.
It was noble of that animal...

240
00:28:06,813 --> 00:28:10,817
...to hurl himself into
the path of that torpedo.

241
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:13,027
He gave his life for ours.

242
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:24,581
Operator, give me the Pentagon,
Navy department.

243
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,210
Too bad.

244
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:33,798
Admiral Fangschliester's office.

245
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,676
Hello, Batman speaking.

246
00:28:38,428 --> 00:28:39,971
- Who is it?
- Batman.

247
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,682
Oh, Batman.

248
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:45,977
Hello, Batman. Ahoy!
What can I do for you?

249
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:48,438
Hello, admiral.
A routine question.

250
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:52,775
Have you recently sold surplus
submarines? If so, to whom?

251
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:56,946
Just a moment,
I'll have to look that up.

252
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:03,411
Keep practicing.

253
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:11,336
Answer: Affirmative. We disposed
of a surplus submarine on Friday.

254
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:15,882
A pre-atomic model.
To some chap named P.N. Gwynne.

255
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:19,385
- P.N. Gwynne?
- The Penguin!

256
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:23,431
Did this P.N. Gwynne leave an address?

257
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:27,185
Just a post office box number.
Would you like it?

258
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:31,022
No, thank you, admiral.
You've been very helpful.

259
00:29:31,523 --> 00:29:36,110
Your tone sounds grim.
We haven't done anything foolish?

260
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:42,158
Disposing of submarines to persons
who don't even leave their addresses?

261
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:46,871
<i>- Good day, admiral.</i>
- Gosh!

262
00:29:47,747 --> 00:29:50,917
The Penguin in command
of a pre-atomic submarine!

263
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:56,798
- Grave situation, Robin.
- If only we knew what he was up to!

264
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:00,343
Holy Polaris!

265
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:05,974
From that submarine, no doubt.

266
00:30:20,947 --> 00:30:24,742
That missile, it's written something.

267
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:32,417
A riddle, in the form of a joke!

268
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:38,631
Let's race back to headquarters.
You know what this means, don't you?

269
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:54,522
Our fear is confirmed. Penguin,
Joker, Riddler, their forces combined.

270
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:59,402
- Heaven only knows the objective!
- It may be worse.

271
00:30:59,611 --> 00:31:04,407
- Saints alive, how can that be?
- Look at this pair of riddles.

272
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:08,995
"What does a turkey do
when he flies upside down?"

273
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:13,166
- He gobbles up.
- And number two.

274
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:16,711
"What weighs 6 ounces,
sits in a tree and is dangerous?"

275
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:20,215
- A sparrow with a machine gun.
- Of course.

276
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:23,593
Now, combine both answers.

277
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:29,182
What kind of creature would
gobble up a bird in a tree?

278
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,893
Heaven protect us, a cat!

279
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:35,855
Yes, the criminal catalyst
in this entire affair...

280
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:40,652
...our old archenemy, Catwoman.

281
00:31:41,444 --> 00:31:45,824
Penguin, Joker, Riddler
and Catwoman too!

282
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:50,537
The sum of the angles
of that rectangle is monstrous.

283
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:54,624
We've been given warning.
They work to take over...

284
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:58,545
- Gotham City?
- Any two of them might try that!

285
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:03,216
- The whole country?
- If it were three, I'd say yes.

286
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:08,596
But four?
Their minimum objective must be...

287
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:11,057
...the entire world.

288
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:16,437
The United World building,
dear comrades in crime.

289
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:20,692
Our objective, the Security Council.

290
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:25,905
Sitting like fat birds in a tree
just waiting to be snatched.

291
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:30,076
And you bungled it!
The Dynamic Duo escaped our trap!

292
00:32:30,326 --> 00:32:34,038
Passing porpoises
which intercept torpedoes!

293
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:36,916
There ought to be
a piscatorial statute!

294
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:42,422
Time is short! We've got
to get Batman before he gets us.

295
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:46,384
I could lure him into
a giant exploding octopus...

296
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:51,514
After one of your fishy explosions,
they're still in one piece.

297
00:32:51,723 --> 00:32:55,727
I suppose they'll be broken up
by your moldy jokes!

298
00:32:55,935 --> 00:33:01,107
Shut up, all of you!
I see the way to do it.

299
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:05,528
We'll play each of our treacherous
trumps in one hand.

300
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:08,781
And we'll do it right here!

301
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:11,784
- How?
- How?

302
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:14,704
The end.

303
00:33:14,996 --> 00:33:19,083
The end of...

304
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:25,882
We shall spring them from
the Joker's jack-in-the-box...

305
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:29,802
...through that window,
out over the sea...

306
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:36,601
...and into the waiting arms
of the Penguin's exploding octopus!

307
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,522
The trigger? One of my riddles.

308
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,526
And the bait? You, Catwoman.

309
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:48,279
You're mad.
The minute Batman spots her...

310
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,990
...he'll bop her with a Batarang.

311
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:54,911
You don't understand.
She will be disguised as Kitka.

312
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,792
And as Kitka, she shall lure
some millionaire into a kidnap trap.

313
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:04,712
Of course!
With a clever clue pointing here.

314
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:09,133
- Batman will race to the rescue.
- Capital!

315
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:12,679
But who are we going to kidnap?

316
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:15,598
I know the perfect victim.

317
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:19,394
I know the perfect victim! I know!

318
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:22,230
Bruce Wayne, the millionaire head...

319
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,277
...of that disgusting do-gooding
Wayne Foundation.

320
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:33,867
Delicious! Just the sort of square
citizen Batman will dash to rescue.

321
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:37,203
- Then snap!
- Into the combination trap.

322
00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:42,458
Purr-fect, Riddler, purr-fect.

323
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:50,300
Comrade Wayne? My name is Kitanya
Irenya Tatanya Karenska Alisoff.

324
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,262
I'm from <i>The Moscow Bugle.</i>
My friends call me Kitka.

325
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:59,601
Kitka. Kitka, a charming acronym.

326
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:01,936
Thank you, Comrade Wayne.

327
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:06,941
The Wayne Foundation is known
from Leningrad to Kamchatka.

328
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:09,652
It works for peace and understanding.

329
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:15,658
Your picture has appeared
countless times in <i>The Moscow Bugle.</i>

330
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:19,829
I'm most grateful,
I wasn't aware of that.

331
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:28,004
You found these riddles on Wayne
Foundation stationery under your door?

332
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:32,300
Yes, Comrade Wayne.
That's why I brought them to you.

333
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:36,513
I thought it was some foolishness,
then I remembered:

334
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:39,516
Is there not
a bourgeois criminal cad...

335
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:42,727
...the Riddler,
who preys upon the workers?

336
00:35:42,936 --> 00:35:45,396
Your jargon is quaint, Miss Kitka.

337
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:48,942
But there is such a creature.

338
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:53,988
What do we do now? Report
these riddles to your police...

339
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,200
...or perhaps
to that Cossack Batman?

340
00:35:57,408 --> 00:36:00,245
That's hardly necessary at the moment.

341
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:04,457
Doubtless it's the work
of some harmless crank.

342
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:11,923
Nevertheless, shall we give
this matter further consideration...

343
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:14,676
...over dinner tonight?

344
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:20,098
What a purr-fectly lovely idea.

345
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:24,561
I'll telephone to cancel
a previous engagement.

346
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:28,022
Alfred will see you to the door.

347
00:36:33,486 --> 00:36:34,904
<i>Do vechera.</i>

348
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,956
<i>Do vechera,</i> Comrade Wayne.

349
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:51,004
Alfred, see Miss Kitka out, please.
Meet me in the Batcave. Emergency.

350
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:52,922
Very good, sir.

351
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:14,819
Listen to these riddles.
Tell me if you interpret them as I do.

352
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:19,324
- "What has yellow skin and writes?"
- A ballpoint banana.

353
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:24,329
Right. "What people are
always in a hurry?"

354
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:27,165
Rushing people? Russians!

355
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:31,377
Right again.
What would you say they mean?

356
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:33,963
Banana, Russian...

357
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:38,134
A Russian will slip on a banana peel
and break their neck!

358
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:41,763
Precisely, the only possible meaning.

359
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:45,266
- A clear threat to Miss Kitka's life.
- Who?

360
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:50,563
Miss Kitka, the charming Russian
journalist for <i>The Moscow Bugle.</i>

361
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:56,110
In some way she must have unwittingly
stumbled on the criminals' plot!

362
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,448
What is the scheme?

363
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:05,245
Tonight Bruce Wayne will go out
on the town with Miss Kitka.

364
00:38:05,495 --> 00:38:07,747
- A not displeasing chore.
- Indeed.

365
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:09,749
I've rarely met a girl...

366
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:14,212
...who's a potent argument
in favor of international relations.

367
00:38:14,462 --> 00:38:17,215
You will dog our footsteps
in the Batmobile.

368
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:20,760
You'll keep watch via the Batscanner.

369
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,390
- If the Riddler tries to make good...
- I'll bash him brutally.

370
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:28,184
Then we close in with the police.

371
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:31,312
- Got your driver's license?
- In my wallet.

372
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:37,652
Good man. Drive carefully. Good luck!
This may be a memorable night.

373
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:22,173
This curtain which separates
our countries is so foolish.

374
00:40:22,382 --> 00:40:25,301
If we could just contrive...

375
00:40:25,552 --> 00:40:30,265
...some way of getting more
deeply involved with each other.

376
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:36,604
<i>Da,</i> we must search for such a method.

377
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:55,415
It's wrong to listen to this.

378
00:40:55,665 --> 00:40:59,586
Some things have to be private,
even for a crime fighter.

379
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:05,008
Your discretion is admirable,
Master Robin, yes.

380
00:41:05,258 --> 00:41:08,887
- Time for another check-in.
- Roger.

381
00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:12,891
- Commissioner.
- Yes?

382
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:18,855
- Yes, Boy Wonder.
- Batmobile position:

383
00:41:19,063 --> 00:41:22,317
Gotham Park,
proceeding south on West Drive.

384
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:25,153
About to pass
Benedict Arnold monument.

385
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:31,159
Still in the park? It's been
almost an hour. What are they doing?

386
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:38,416
No comment, commissioner. Let's just
say, no sign of criminal activity.

387
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:42,086
Yes, I understand.

388
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:46,216
I've just thought of a clever ruse.

389
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:49,511
Have Chief O'Hara
flash the Batsignal.

390
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:52,305
If you say so, but why?

391
00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:56,518
The crooks will think
we're racing to headquarters.

392
00:41:56,768 --> 00:42:01,523
Thinking we're out of the way,
they might strike at Miss Kitka!

393
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:03,858
Devilishly clever!

394
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:09,113
- Thank you. Batmobile over and out.
- Right.

395
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:14,786
- Chief O'Hara, flash the Batsignal.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:24,838
Shades of Smolensk, what is that?

397
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:27,340
Incredible, I don't...

398
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:33,555
- Of course! How clever.
- Clever, Comrade Wayne?

399
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:37,350
I mean, clever device, Miss Kitka.

400
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,688
It's the Batsignal,
from the roof of police headquarters.

401
00:42:41,938 --> 00:42:44,899
Batman must be racing
there in response.

402
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:50,738
Then you did get the police
to call them in for my protection.

403
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:53,408
Yes, yes.

404
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:59,038
How purr-fectly wonderful of you!

405
00:43:00,165 --> 00:43:04,919
I close my eyes and I dream
of those savage Cossacks...

406
00:43:05,128 --> 00:43:08,840
...racing over the steps
on their mission.

407
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,845
How strange.

408
00:43:14,554 --> 00:43:19,058
I close my eyes,
and I dream of something...

409
00:43:19,267 --> 00:43:23,646
...quite astonishingly different.

410
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:32,822
Keep your eyes closed.
Continue with this dream.

411
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:41,581
The dream continues.

412
00:43:51,674 --> 00:43:54,093
It approaches a climax.

413
00:43:54,344 --> 00:43:58,681
Not so fast. Be more slow.

414
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:04,062
Miss Kitka?

415
00:44:05,313 --> 00:44:09,943
May I see you home
to that penthouse apartment?

416
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:21,454
- He swallowed the Catbait!
- And now to make him Batbait.

417
00:44:21,704 --> 00:44:26,626
Finks, Morgan, Bluebeard, Quetch,
the jetpack umbrellas!

418
00:44:48,106 --> 00:44:51,484
I'll slip into something
more comfortable...

419
00:44:51,734 --> 00:44:54,988
...while your cocoa is warming.

420
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:18,887
Is that prudent?
Our instructions were to keep watch.

421
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:24,601
I don't know about prudent.
But it's the only decent thing to do.

422
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:30,231
Perhaps. Yes, yes.

423
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:54,255
There it is, 73rd Street
and Concord Avenue.

424
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:57,509
Follow me down to the terrace.

425
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:21,574
<i>And all my days are trances</i>
<i>And all my nightly dreams</i>

426
00:46:21,825 --> 00:46:24,494
<i>Are where thy dark eye glances</i>

427
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:28,998
<i>And where thy footstep gleams</i>

428
00:46:33,044 --> 00:46:36,548
Edgar Allan Poe, Miss Kitka.

429
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:40,927
"To One in Paradise," first stanza.

430
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:45,473
About that dream you had...

431
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:49,060
- Do we dare?
- Why not?

432
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:51,271
Yes, of course. Why not?

433
00:46:51,479 --> 00:46:56,609
Of what use is a dream if not
a blueprint for courageous action?

434
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,530
Into action, comrade.

435
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:05,368
Miss Kitka,
I have the strangest feeling...

436
00:47:05,577 --> 00:47:11,166
...that I am about to be utterly
and madly carried away.

437
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,673
- This is a kidnapping!
- Our joke's on you!

438
00:47:20,008 --> 00:47:23,887
You filthy criminals!

439
00:48:07,764 --> 00:48:11,059
- Much as one deplores indiscretion...
- Right.

440
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:14,270
I'll just take one tiny, tiny peek.

441
00:48:17,315 --> 00:48:19,400
- Holy demolition!
- Bless my dustpan!

442
00:48:19,651 --> 00:48:23,530
Cover the exits.
I'll race up with my Batrope!

443
00:48:24,113 --> 00:48:25,990
Holy Halloween!

444
00:48:52,392 --> 00:48:55,687
Strange, Batman should've
been here hours ago.

445
00:48:55,937 --> 00:48:58,565
Maybe you didn't leave
a clear enough clue.

446
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:04,237
I did! I can't understand why
Batman hasn't dashed into our trap.

447
00:49:04,487 --> 00:49:08,533
He puts his foot here,
my secret jack-in-the-box fires...

448
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:11,411
...shooting him over the sea...

449
00:49:11,661 --> 00:49:15,582
...into the waiting arms
of Penguin's exploding octopus.

450
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,418
What a deliciously
humorous trajectory!

451
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:22,547
And nothing
to link us with the crime.

452
00:49:28,428 --> 00:49:33,391
You abominable outlaws!
What have you done with Miss Kitka?

453
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:36,102
She's quite well, Mr. Wayne.

454
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:41,065
I swear by heaven,
if you've harmed that girl...

455
00:49:41,274 --> 00:49:43,860
...I'll kill you all.

456
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:48,198
I'll rend you limb from limb!

457
00:49:51,993 --> 00:49:55,371
Mr. Wayne, must you be so impulsive?

458
00:50:03,004 --> 00:50:05,715
Where is she?
Show me Miss Kitka...

459
00:50:05,924 --> 00:50:09,636
...or I'll wreck this place
with my dying breath!

460
00:50:09,844 --> 00:50:12,013
Blindfold the captive.

461
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:17,185
Lead him down the labyrinthine path
to chamber 17.

462
00:50:32,325 --> 00:50:34,911
Two minutes, no more.

463
00:50:38,665 --> 00:50:41,960
- Turn on the secret microphone.
- Quiet, quiet!

464
00:50:43,461 --> 00:50:45,755
- Miss Kitka.
- Comrade Wayne.

465
00:50:45,964 --> 00:50:48,049
Are you all right?

466
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:52,846
I'll curse myself forever.

467
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:57,016
This nasty soup we're in
is of my brewing.

468
00:51:01,396 --> 00:51:05,400
If I hadn't let your beauty
lull me off guard...

469
00:51:05,608 --> 00:51:07,819
Off guard, comrade?

470
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:11,406
There are some things
I cannot disclose.

471
00:51:11,614 --> 00:51:14,951
But we're in the hands
of the most vicious foursome.

472
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:20,456
<i>I fear we have nothing</i>
<i>to look forward to but death.</i>

473
00:51:26,754 --> 00:51:29,716
It may not be that black,
Comrade Wayne.

474
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:33,136
Batman and Robin are
probably hot on our trail.

475
00:51:33,344 --> 00:51:36,055
From something
I happened to overhear...

476
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:39,601
<i>... I think we are merely</i>
<i>bait for Batman.</i>

477
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:42,645
<i>Once he's in their trap,</i>
<i>we'll be released.</i>

478
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:48,860
A slender hope, Miss Kitka.
More slender than you can know.

479
00:51:49,068 --> 00:51:52,697
You do not think
Batman will get here?

480
00:51:53,364 --> 00:51:55,450
That I cannot say.

481
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,369
Did you overhear any mention...

482
00:51:58,578 --> 00:52:02,040
...of any other prisoner
of this rotten gang?

483
00:52:02,248 --> 00:52:04,042
No, I did not.

484
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:07,712
<i>Who on earth could you mean?</i>

485
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:12,634
Commodore Schmidlapp
ringing for his tea.

486
00:52:12,884 --> 00:52:17,764
Just a thought, it doesn't matter.
Speedy escape is our only hope.

487
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:20,350
A moment, while I think...

488
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:23,812
<i>Why didn 't I think of it sooner?</i>

489
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,688
Of what?

490
00:52:25,939 --> 00:52:30,860
Up my sleeve I have a radio
transmitter strapped above my elbow.

491
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:34,656
- What a curious device to carry.
- Not at all.

492
00:52:34,864 --> 00:52:39,369
Capitalists who carry a lot of money
have safety contrivances.

493
00:52:39,577 --> 00:52:42,956
If I can just get at it...

494
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:46,209
Wiggle around back-to-back.

495
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:50,046
Maybe you can reach it
with your fingers.

496
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:57,345
Let's get him.

497
00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:00,932
There we are.

498
00:53:01,182 --> 00:53:04,394
You think you're pretty clever,
don't you?

499
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:08,481
- Clever enough to outwit you.
- We'll see about that.

500
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:14,154
Dear colleagues, let's see
what's strapped above his left elbow.

501
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:20,326
Cretinous creatures!
I knew you'd been listening in!

502
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:24,164
I told you that fish story
about a radio...

503
00:53:36,968 --> 00:53:38,261
Get him!

504
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:12,587
Miss Kitka! Where are you?

505
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,536
- Great day!
- Hello, commissioner.

506
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:48,540
Dick, we're late for
that demonstration. Excuse us.

507
00:54:48,748 --> 00:54:52,001
But you can't dash off now.
How did you escape?

508
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:56,256
- With the aid of Batman.
- Thank goodness for the Caped Crusader.

509
00:54:56,506 --> 00:55:01,427
Return to police headquarters.
He may wish to call you.

510
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:44,637
My fine finkish friends, you have
heard my astounding proposal.

511
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:49,559
What do you say?
What do you say?!

512
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:52,312
Our strike cannot be postponed.

513
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,483
We're at the mercy
of the Gotham River tide.

514
00:55:56,691 --> 00:56:00,153
It's now or never
to get through the channel.

515
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:06,201
Batman will never come here now.
But the police will, any instant.

516
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:11,748
So, to the Penguin's princely plan.
Is it yes or no?

517
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:18,755
It's crazy, but let's try it.
We have to get Batman out of the way.

518
00:56:18,963 --> 00:56:21,090
Oh, go ahead, Penguin.

519
00:56:21,341 --> 00:56:27,597
Would you drop one of your dream pills
into Commodore Schmidlapp's tea?

520
00:56:27,805 --> 00:56:32,143
- Presto!
- Then carry him to the submarine!

521
00:56:33,061 --> 00:56:35,897
Mr. Riddler,
will you tell Mr. Quetch...

522
00:56:36,105 --> 00:56:40,693
...to fetch the five guinea pigs?

523
00:56:43,196 --> 00:56:46,115
Fetch the guinea pigs.

524
00:57:02,298 --> 00:57:03,758
Yo-ho-ho, sir!

525
00:57:04,008 --> 00:57:06,719
Now, my fine fishy finks...

526
00:57:06,928 --> 00:57:10,765
...you see the commodore's
pièce de "no-résistance"...

527
00:57:11,015 --> 00:57:13,810
...an instant whiskey maker.

528
00:57:14,018 --> 00:57:18,857
Waiting for us to put it
to more universal use.

529
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:23,653
Don't be afraid.
You'll feel nothing.

530
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,699
I am merely going
to temporarily extract...

531
00:57:27,907 --> 00:57:31,452
...every bit of moisture
from your bodies!

532
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:33,830
It's a painless operation.

533
00:58:06,571 --> 00:58:09,073
- Delightful!
- Dehydrated!

534
00:58:09,282 --> 00:58:12,660
Catwoman, will you get a dustpan...

535
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:18,374
...and put every one of them
very carefully into separate vials?

536
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:24,547
Mr. Riddler, would you prepare
the submarine to get underway...

537
00:58:24,756 --> 00:58:30,303
...while I prepare a terrifying
demolition charge for the police?

538
00:58:30,553 --> 00:58:34,265
- Where do we meet?
- United World building.

539
00:58:34,474 --> 00:58:37,352
Gotham River.
39th floor. The elevator.

540
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,646
- One hour?
- One hour.

541
00:58:42,524 --> 00:58:46,236
What criminal genius, Catwoman!

542
00:58:46,444 --> 00:58:50,573
Who but a genius could conceive
such an audacious plot?

543
00:58:51,074 --> 00:58:56,579
To trick Batman and Robin into
inviting me to their Batcave...

544
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:03,002
...with five dehydrated
death-dealing pirates at my command.

545
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,259
Careful, careful.
Every one of them has a mother.

546
00:59:35,243 --> 00:59:38,872
Out, Batarang and Batrope.
Stand clear.

547
00:59:52,844 --> 00:59:58,308
With people in weird outfits
like the supercrooks around here...

548
00:59:58,558 --> 01:00:02,270
...it's amazing no one reports
this place to the police!

549
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:06,816
It's a low neighborhood,
full of rum pots.

550
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:10,570
They attribute curious sights
to alcoholic delusions.

551
01:00:10,778 --> 01:00:12,780
Drink is a filthy thing.

552
01:00:12,989 --> 01:00:16,618
I'd rather be dead than unable
to trust my own eyes.

553
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:26,628
Yes, honey. There was someone
walking up the wall.

554
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,728
Ready with super-blinding Batpellets.

555
01:00:46,314 --> 01:00:48,483
- Away, Robin. Away!
- But...

556
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:55,865
Come on, Batman.

557
01:00:56,115 --> 01:00:57,492
Batman!

558
01:01:02,497 --> 01:01:04,374
Miss Kitka!

559
01:01:31,943 --> 01:01:37,532
Quick, everyone!
Flee for your lives! Into the street!

560
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:11,167
Some days you just can't
get rid of a bomb.

561
01:03:36,484 --> 01:03:39,737
- It's all right.
- Holy heart failure!

562
01:03:39,988 --> 01:03:43,825
I was able to dispose
of that bomb just in time...

563
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:47,537
...and shield myself
behind these iron pipes.

564
01:03:47,745 --> 01:03:51,541
You risked your life to save
that riffraff in the bar?

565
01:03:51,749 --> 01:03:55,962
They may be drinkers,
but they're also human beings...

566
01:03:56,171 --> 01:03:58,548
...and may be salvaged.

567
01:03:58,756 --> 01:04:00,633
I had to do it!

568
01:04:00,884 --> 01:04:05,930
But we lost the trail of Miss Kitka.
Stranded without a clue!

569
01:04:06,264 --> 01:04:10,185
Ahoy there! Could you chaps
direct me to a policeman?

570
01:04:10,435 --> 01:04:16,441
Commodore Schmidlapp's the name.
Big Ben Distilleries, you know.

571
01:04:17,317 --> 01:04:20,570
- Holy costume party. The Penguin!
- Obviously.

572
01:04:20,778 --> 01:04:22,197
What's his game?

573
01:04:23,114 --> 01:04:26,659
- What's your game, Penguin?
- Penguin?

574
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,497
No, my name's Schmidlapp,
old boy, Schmidlapp.

575
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:33,958
Your fingerprints will
settle that hash.

576
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:39,380
We'll check them against our mobile
anti-crime file in our Batmobile.

577
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:42,300
Let's see your hands.

578
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:46,721
Looks like plastic-coated fingertips!

579
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:50,183
Yes, I scorched myself
pressing a waistcoat.

580
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:56,064
I do believe the attending
surgeon did use plastic, yes.

581
01:04:57,524 --> 01:05:01,611
It looks bad.
This brassy bird has us buffaloed.

582
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:03,988
Not quite.

583
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:07,992
There's one method of identification
no one can evade.

584
01:05:08,243 --> 01:05:11,079
Retinal eye patterns?

585
01:05:11,704 --> 01:05:14,874
He's right. The pattern
of blood vessels...

586
01:05:15,124 --> 01:05:18,795
...in the retina,
as individual as a fingerprint.

587
01:05:19,295 --> 01:05:23,508
Don't you have an anti-criminal,
eye-pattern master file...

588
01:05:23,716 --> 01:05:27,387
...in your Batcave?
Why don't you take me there?

589
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:33,309
- You'll submit yourself to a test?
- It might be an amusing experience.

590
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:38,273
Stand by to catch him, Robin.
I'll give him the Batgas.

591
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,483
What? Batgas?

592
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,904
An anesthetic, necessary
to prevent you from seeing...

593
01:05:45,113 --> 01:05:47,157
...the entrance to the Batcave.

594
01:05:47,365 --> 01:05:51,911
If anyone knew that, they could
pierce the secret of our identities.

595
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,621
Ready, commodore?

596
01:05:53,872 --> 01:05:59,127
Oh, I say, what deucedly strange
customs you colonials have!

597
01:05:59,335 --> 01:06:01,337
Well, I'm ready.

598
01:06:08,595 --> 01:06:11,806
To the Batmobile.
This could be our break.

599
01:06:24,068 --> 01:06:27,572
- I wonder why he let us take him?
- We'll soon know.

600
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:31,201
- I've got the eye checker.
- Stay on the alert.

601
01:06:31,618 --> 01:06:36,998
After I give him the Batwake,
we must be ready for anything.

602
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:48,510
Oh, it's you.
We're here, eh? I see.

603
01:06:49,093 --> 01:06:54,015
Oh, what's this? Oh, say!

604
01:06:54,224 --> 01:07:00,146
This is extraordinary!
It's absolutely extraordinary!

605
01:07:00,355 --> 01:07:03,983
I must say that your laboratory
exceeds the limits...

606
01:07:04,192 --> 01:07:07,654
...of man's wildest imagination.

607
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:10,824
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

608
01:07:11,032 --> 01:07:15,286
Your Batgas has left me
with a parched sensation.

609
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:18,706
The water dispenser is clearly marked.

610
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:22,961
All right, thank you.
Thank you, sir.

611
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:29,259
Help yourself, commodore.
Slake your thirst.

612
01:07:29,467 --> 01:07:33,930
You'll have worse than a parched
sensation when we're through.

613
01:07:35,723 --> 01:07:41,020
Perhaps, perhaps. But I am
appalled by your attitude, sir.

614
01:07:41,229 --> 01:07:47,360
Condemning me before the facts have
been authoritatively established!

615
01:07:48,361 --> 01:07:53,783
You are abrogating
my constitutional rights, sir.

616
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:55,702
All set, Batman.

617
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:59,956
Come on, Penguin.
Time to rip off your false feathers.

618
01:08:03,001 --> 01:08:07,255
Coming, Batman.
I'm coming at once.

619
01:08:13,428 --> 01:08:15,180
Holy hallucination!

620
01:08:15,388 --> 01:08:19,726
I wish it were, but it's five
dehydrated pirates, rehydrated!

621
01:08:20,018 --> 01:08:25,023
At them, me hearties!
Shiver them from stem to stern!

622
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:38,786
Attack them, you faltering fink!

623
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:47,045
They're gone! Popped like balloons.
How did it happen?

624
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:50,298
Whoever dehydrated those pirates...

625
01:08:50,548 --> 01:08:55,512
...couldn't have foreseen their
rehydration with the heavy water...

626
01:08:55,762 --> 01:08:58,097
...we use to recharge
the atomic pile!

627
01:08:58,306 --> 01:09:01,309
It left them in an unstable condition!

628
01:09:01,518 --> 01:09:06,689
You saw it yourself. The slightest
impact was sufficient...

629
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:10,693
...to instantly reduce them
to antimatter.

630
01:09:11,194 --> 01:09:15,907
Antimatter?
You mean, they won't be coming back?

631
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:22,205
No, Robin. Not in this universe.

632
01:09:26,626 --> 01:09:29,712
Let that be a lesson in the dangers...

633
01:09:29,921 --> 01:09:34,008
...of tampering with the laws
of Mother Nature.

634
01:09:34,217 --> 01:09:40,181
My apologies, commodore.
I've done you a cruel injustice.

635
01:09:41,182 --> 01:09:44,853
- You have?
- You were duped. Brainwashed.

636
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:49,732
The criminals planted
those dehydrated thugs on you.

637
01:09:49,941 --> 01:09:52,527
You were obviously
under the influence...

638
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:57,240
...of post-hypnotic suggestion
when you rehydrated them.

639
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:00,577
Come on down, commodore.

640
01:10:00,785 --> 01:10:05,707
Another sniff of Batgas,
and we'll all return to the city.

641
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,511
Are you sure you didn't
hurt your head?

642
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,849
Perfectly. Swallow this pill.

643
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:28,688
Now, give our friend here
a whiff of Batwake.

644
01:10:31,232 --> 01:10:33,067
Good morning.

645
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:35,028
What's wrong?

646
01:10:35,236 --> 01:10:39,949
Manifold pressure's dropping.
We'd better stop and check it.

647
01:10:46,831 --> 01:10:51,836
- Sorry about that. Won't take long.
- Yes, you will!

648
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:03,306
And away we go in my Birdmobile!
One side kick for a sailor.

649
01:11:13,733 --> 01:11:17,320
- You okay?
- Thanks to that anti-Penguin gas pill!

650
01:11:17,529 --> 01:11:22,450
He's played right into our hands.
Via Batcycle to the Batcopter!

651
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:25,829
We'll track him
to the gang's new hideout.

652
01:11:56,943 --> 01:11:59,195
Disengage go-cart.

653
01:12:13,251 --> 01:12:16,004
Batscanner tracking
the stolen Batmobile.

654
01:12:16,588 --> 01:12:19,257
Port two degrees,
then steady as she goes!

655
01:12:19,465 --> 01:12:21,926
Yo-ho, port two degrees!

656
01:12:22,135 --> 01:12:24,429
We're almost there!

657
01:12:25,555 --> 01:12:29,726
- Where are you going?
- To fire off more riddling clues.

658
01:12:29,934 --> 01:12:34,147
Riddler! You're mad!
Penguin's finished Batman by now.

659
01:12:34,355 --> 01:12:37,817
That miserable, waddling
mountebank of a bird!

660
01:12:38,026 --> 01:12:42,155
He couldn't finish a bag of popcorn!

661
01:12:42,947 --> 01:12:47,827
Say Penguin failed. All the more
reason not to hand them clues.

662
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:52,207
But I must! Outwitting Batman
is my sole delight...

663
01:12:52,457 --> 01:12:57,587
...my joy, my heaven on earth,
my very paradise.

664
01:12:58,463 --> 01:13:00,173
Riddler, come back!

665
01:13:03,885 --> 01:13:07,764
Stolen Batmobile turning,
heading up Gotham River Drive.

666
01:13:19,067 --> 01:13:22,070
Polaris-type missile
coming right for us!

667
01:13:22,695 --> 01:13:24,739
Hold on! This may be tricky.

668
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:33,164
- Damage?
- The tail rotor's disengaged.

669
01:13:33,915 --> 01:13:38,002
Brace yourself, Robin,
we're going down.

670
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:40,088
This could be the end.

671
01:13:47,887 --> 01:13:52,225
Now, to find my riddling
Polaris skywriter!

672
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:04,946
Look! Look, the Dynamic Duo!

673
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:11,202
I got them. I got them.

674
01:14:24,924 --> 01:14:26,426
Holy horseshoe!

675
01:14:35,643 --> 01:14:38,771
Some luck, landing
on top of foam rubber!

676
01:14:39,022 --> 01:14:44,360
The odds against it would make even
the most reckless gambler cringe.

677
01:14:44,569 --> 01:14:49,991
True, I did think I'd spotted it
out of the corner of my eye, but...

678
01:14:51,326 --> 01:14:54,245
That crazy missile wrote
two more riddles.

679
01:14:54,454 --> 01:14:58,625
"What goes up white and comes down
yellow and white?"

680
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:00,627
An egg!

681
01:15:01,544 --> 01:15:07,884
"How do you divide 17 apples
among 16 people?"

682
01:15:08,301 --> 01:15:09,552
Make applesauce.

683
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:14,140
Apples into applesauce.
A unification into one smooth mixture.

684
01:15:14,349 --> 01:15:19,646
An egg, nature's perfect container.
The container of our future hopes.

685
01:15:19,896 --> 01:15:24,359
A unification in a container of hope?
United World Organization!

686
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:28,947
Precisely!
And the Security Council meets today.

687
01:15:29,155 --> 01:15:33,201
- If what I fear is true...
- Let's commandeer a taxi.

688
01:15:33,409 --> 01:15:38,373
No, not at this time of day.
Luckily we're in tip-top condition.

689
01:15:38,581 --> 01:15:41,543
It'll be faster if we run. Let's go!

690
01:15:54,097 --> 01:15:56,766
We are now passing
through the grotto.

691
01:15:56,975 --> 01:16:01,271
- Depth, a half-fathom.
- Engines, dead slow astern.

692
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:04,149
Dead slow astern.

693
01:16:52,697 --> 01:16:56,618
As the blueprint said,
an abandoned construction elevator.

694
01:16:56,868 --> 01:16:59,871
Hecate, sniff out the weak spot.

695
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:07,003
- I hope Penguin made it.
- Who needs him?

696
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,506
Stand back.

697
01:17:25,939 --> 01:17:27,857
Hey! Can't you read?

698
01:17:28,066 --> 01:17:30,777
A fine day for penguins.

699
01:18:10,775 --> 01:18:13,570
My co-conspirators,
we meet as planned.

700
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:17,866
No thanks to you, the Dynamic Duo
has been silenced forever.

701
01:18:18,074 --> 01:18:21,119
Blasted out of the sky
by a coincidence!

702
01:18:21,327 --> 01:18:26,082
The delicious irony of it!
Downed by Riddler's Polaris skywriter.

703
01:18:26,332 --> 01:18:30,795
Happy happenstance! Hold your
breath till we cross the hall.

704
01:18:31,004 --> 01:18:36,468
There are still lingering traces
of my finely filtered Penguin gas.

705
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,183
Holy marathon! I'm getting a stitch!

706
01:18:43,433 --> 01:18:46,936
Let's hope it's a stitch in time
that saves nine.

707
01:18:47,145 --> 01:18:50,732
The nine members
of the Security Council.

708
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:08,416
It is the opinion of Her Majesty
that we pursue peace at all costs.

709
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:21,721
Our poor united world in microcosm.

710
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:25,725
I'm afraid they'll find our humor
very, very dry.

711
01:19:27,185 --> 01:19:30,480
We understand your position,
but for peace...

712
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:05,974
It has always been our policy...

713
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:27,829
Quickly now!
Each one in a separate vial.

714
01:20:28,037 --> 01:20:32,625
And, boys, don't anybody sneeze.

715
01:20:43,761 --> 01:20:47,307
- Seal the building!
- Turn off the ventilating system!

716
01:20:47,515 --> 01:20:50,852
The Security Council
may have been dehydrated!

717
01:20:51,478 --> 01:20:54,272
Emergency, operator.
Get me security.

718
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:56,649
Emergency, operator, emergency!

719
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,694
Up, up, up, up!

720
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:14,584
- Surrender! You criminals!
- The United Underworld is through!

721
01:21:15,043 --> 01:21:17,712
What's this, an apparition?

722
01:21:18,379 --> 01:21:23,092
One false move, and you'll find out.
We'll hurl our Batarangs!

723
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:26,346
- To the elevator!
- Catwoman! Stop, I said!

724
01:21:26,554 --> 01:21:28,932
I don't think you mean that.

725
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:34,771
Miss Kitka dies
if you take one more step! Go!

726
01:21:38,566 --> 01:21:40,610
This way, Robin!

727
01:21:43,738 --> 01:21:46,324
The Security Council, gone!

728
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:49,994
What a fiendishly clever way
to abduct nine men...

729
01:21:50,245 --> 01:21:53,122
...from a heavily guarded building!

730
01:21:54,249 --> 01:21:56,334
Where does that elevator go?

731
01:21:56,543 --> 01:22:01,089
Downstairs, to an abandoned
submarine dock on the river.

732
01:22:01,297 --> 01:22:06,427
Holy Captain Nemo! They'll head
for sea by way of Short Island Sound.

733
01:22:06,636 --> 01:22:10,390
We have just one trump card left.

734
01:22:10,598 --> 01:22:13,560
Heaven help the world if we fail.

735
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:15,645
Come on!

736
01:22:29,075 --> 01:22:30,869
Down periscope.

737
01:22:31,077 --> 01:22:35,748
We're over the last bar.
Mr. Bluebeard, all engines full ahead.

738
01:22:35,957 --> 01:22:39,210
Yo-ho, all engines full ahead!

739
01:22:41,004 --> 01:22:43,548
What a delightful haul!

740
01:22:43,756 --> 01:22:49,012
Mr. Riddler, will you prepare
those nine radio ransom messages?

741
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:53,141
And no stupid riddles.
Make those messages plain.

742
01:22:53,558 --> 01:22:57,812
One billion dollars cash,
from each country.

743
01:22:58,021 --> 01:23:02,233
Precisely! To be delivered
to our secret island...

744
01:23:02,442 --> 01:23:06,988
...by the horde of trained carrier
pigeons which I shall provide.

745
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:12,577
No whimsical embellishments.
Make those messages clear!

746
01:23:13,244 --> 01:23:16,122
Make those messages clear!

747
01:23:20,168 --> 01:23:23,171
It's like a dream, Pengy-sweet.

748
01:23:23,379 --> 01:23:26,800
Nothing can stop us now.

749
01:23:31,805 --> 01:23:36,267
Sonar contact.
Range 8000. Bearing 181.

750
01:23:43,149 --> 01:23:47,904
Yo-ho, sonar contact.
Small craft at 7500, bearing 01.

751
01:23:48,112 --> 01:23:49,739
Small craft?

752
01:23:49,948 --> 01:23:52,826
It's moving fast.
Range is down to 7000.

753
01:23:53,034 --> 01:23:56,246
- The Batboat!
- Drat that cockleshell!

754
01:23:56,454 --> 01:24:00,500
Mr. Bluebeard,
steady on the diving planes.

755
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:03,002
I'll man the torpedo tubes.

756
01:24:03,211 --> 01:24:09,008
Would you fire a surface-to-surface
underwater homing missile?

757
01:24:24,232 --> 01:24:26,651
Missile ahoy!

758
01:24:32,532 --> 01:24:36,995
It has a homing device in
its nose cone. Take evasive action.

759
01:25:00,435 --> 01:25:02,645
No use. It's tracking us!

760
01:25:03,521 --> 01:25:07,108
Take my Batradio.
I looked it up this morning.

761
01:25:07,692 --> 01:25:12,697
That class of missile receives
on a wavelength of 164. 1.

762
01:25:13,656 --> 01:25:18,036
- 164. 1.
- Quickly! Send a jamming signal.

763
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,005
It's starting down.

764
01:25:35,178 --> 01:25:38,056
Farewell, Batman!

765
01:25:38,515 --> 01:25:41,351
Farewell, Dynamic Duo!

766
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:44,103
Holy bikini, that was close!

767
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:51,110
Yo-ho, small craft still closing.
Range 4000. Bearing 88.

768
01:25:51,319 --> 01:25:56,866
They know how to jam our missiles.
Up to periscope depth!

769
01:25:57,075 --> 01:25:59,953
Yo-ho, up to periscope depth.

770
01:26:04,999 --> 01:26:08,753
- Range 3500.
- Get the Batcharge launcher.

771
01:26:09,587 --> 01:26:11,005
Roger!

772
01:26:11,381 --> 01:26:17,053
They hold nine of the world's most
eminent men in dehydrated condition.

773
01:26:17,262 --> 01:26:22,392
Our task is not to sink that sub,
merely to drive it to the surface.

774
01:26:33,403 --> 01:26:36,531
Forward torpedo tubes,
prepare to fire.

775
01:26:36,739 --> 01:26:40,577
Yo-ho! Forward torpedo tubes,
prepare to fire.

776
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:46,541
Five, four, three, two...

777
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:50,545
...torpedoes, fire!

778
01:26:51,129 --> 01:26:53,381
Torpedoes, fire!

779
01:26:59,179 --> 01:27:01,681
Torpedoes away!

780
01:27:02,682 --> 01:27:05,685
- Dive, Mr. Bluebeard, dive!
- Yo-ho, dive.

781
01:27:05,935 --> 01:27:09,147
Down periscope.

782
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,818
Torpedo off the port bow!

783
01:27:14,027 --> 01:27:17,530
Prepare to fire Batcharges
in front of torpedoes.

784
01:27:27,624 --> 01:27:31,753
That's too soon!
It must be Batcharges!

785
01:27:32,003 --> 01:27:36,841
And that means there'll be more
of the dread things meant for us!

786
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:39,761
You dismal bird!
You and your submarine!

787
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:42,388
Shut up, you feline floozy!

788
01:27:42,597 --> 01:27:46,351
Mr. Bluebeard, down 30 fathoms.

789
01:27:46,601 --> 01:27:50,063
Run silent, run deep.

790
01:27:56,611 --> 01:27:58,822
They're diving, silent engines.

791
01:27:59,113 --> 01:28:04,285
I'll circle them at full-thrust speed,
diminishing radius of curvature.

792
01:28:04,494 --> 01:28:05,537
Roger.

793
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:11,376
What's their bearing?

794
01:28:11,584 --> 01:28:14,629
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?

795
01:28:14,838 --> 01:28:18,800
It's changing every second.
They must be circling us.

796
01:28:21,845 --> 01:28:23,304
Fire when ready.

797
01:28:26,432 --> 01:28:28,810
I'll maintain curvature.

798
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:42,509
Yo-ho! Compartments A, B and C
taking in water, sir!

799
01:29:42,717 --> 01:29:45,637
Penguin, you know I can't take water!

800
01:29:45,887 --> 01:29:51,226
You cowardly kitten,
you want to live forever?

801
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:57,065
- This bird has flown around the bend!
- To cuckooland!

802
01:29:57,273 --> 01:30:03,947
Riddler, Joker, do something!
We weren't meant for a watery grave!

803
01:30:08,993 --> 01:30:11,454
Now hear this! Now hear this!

804
01:30:11,704 --> 01:30:17,001
Blow all tanks! Surface! Surface!

805
01:30:19,254 --> 01:30:23,466
Cut the Batcharges.
They've had enough, I imagine.

806
01:30:26,553 --> 01:30:28,763
They're surfacing fast.

807
01:30:29,013 --> 01:30:32,392
- Estimated surfacing position?
- 200 yards.

808
01:30:35,937 --> 01:30:37,939
Here they come.

809
01:30:41,276 --> 01:30:44,445
Diminishing speed. Ready to board.

810
01:30:44,696 --> 01:30:46,281
Roger.

811
01:31:12,807 --> 01:31:14,851
Pirates! To arms!

812
01:31:15,059 --> 01:31:19,063
Prepare to repel boarders!

813
01:31:20,565 --> 01:31:22,025
Strike your colors!

814
01:31:22,442 --> 01:31:27,155
We have not yet begun to fight!
Attack!

815
01:33:04,294 --> 01:33:06,504
Bon voyage, pussy.

816
01:34:34,217 --> 01:34:36,845
Holy heartbreak! Miss Kitka!

817
01:35:06,332 --> 01:35:08,001
Batman, I...

818
01:35:08,251 --> 01:35:11,921
Say no more, Robin.
It could be compromising.

819
01:35:12,589 --> 01:35:14,674
Of course.

820
01:35:15,508 --> 01:35:21,389
It's just one of those things
in the life of every crime fighter.

821
01:35:21,598 --> 01:35:24,476
It means nothing.
Snap on the Batcuffs.

822
01:35:31,816 --> 01:35:34,527
Batman to coast guard.

823
01:35:34,777 --> 01:35:38,490
There's a submarine
two miles east of Sandy Nose.

824
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:43,453
It's filled with human jetsam.
Come, take it in tow.

825
01:35:52,796 --> 01:35:55,757
Robin. Over here, look.

826
01:35:58,009 --> 01:36:01,221
The hope of the world,
tottering on the brink!

827
01:36:01,429 --> 01:36:03,097
Holy almost!

828
01:36:03,348 --> 01:36:08,061
To think, it might have been shattered
before our very eyes.

829
01:36:08,937 --> 01:36:13,274
- Up, Catwoman.
- The service here has gone to pot.

830
01:36:13,525 --> 01:36:17,153
What the devil is this?
The captain's costume party?

831
01:36:25,411 --> 01:36:30,166
Holy jumble!
Where's the hope of the world now?

832
01:36:36,256 --> 01:36:38,967
Batcentrifuge at 32,000 rpm.

833
01:36:39,175 --> 01:36:42,095
Increase angstrom force in vector X.

834
01:36:42,345 --> 01:36:44,973
Vector X up one notch.

835
01:36:51,312 --> 01:36:54,816
- Yes, commissioner?
- What progress? Is there hope?

836
01:36:56,109 --> 01:36:58,153
There's always hope.

837
01:36:58,611 --> 01:37:03,324
But do you think you and Robin
can separate that mingled dust...

838
01:37:03,533 --> 01:37:06,161
...back into its constituent members?

839
01:37:06,661 --> 01:37:09,789
With all modesty, commissioner...

840
01:37:10,039 --> 01:37:13,460
...if we can't, heaven knows who can.

841
01:37:13,668 --> 01:37:17,297
Truer words were never spoken.

842
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:22,218
<i>Howdy, you all.</i>
<i>How are those boys doing up there?</i>

843
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:27,056
Batman says there's hope,
Mr. President. What more can one ask?

844
01:37:27,599 --> 01:37:33,563
The free world is waiting. Tell Batman
I salute him and wish him luck.

845
01:37:38,234 --> 01:37:42,280
<i>I needn 't tell you</i>
<i>with whom I have just spoken.</i>

846
01:37:49,037 --> 01:37:50,705
Ready for separation.

847
01:37:50,914 --> 01:37:54,793
All right.
I'll activate the computer link.

848
01:37:55,001 --> 01:37:57,837
Input the ethnic and national factors.

849
01:37:58,421 --> 01:38:01,424
- Batman, wait a minute!
- What?

850
01:38:02,091 --> 01:38:05,178
Well, with the way
the world is and all...

851
01:38:05,428 --> 01:38:09,265
...maybe we ought to try
to improve those factors?

852
01:38:09,516 --> 01:38:11,768
- Reshuffle them a little.
- No.

853
01:38:11,976 --> 01:38:16,356
It's not for us to tamper
with the laws of nature.

854
01:38:16,606 --> 01:38:20,610
In this very Batcave,
you saw a ghastly example...

855
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:24,030
...of what happens
when one tries to do that.

856
01:38:24,656 --> 01:38:27,492
Gosh, yes.
When you put it that way...

857
01:38:28,243 --> 01:38:29,869
Here we go.

858
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:20,962
Separation accomplished.
Ready to rehydrate.

859
01:39:25,133 --> 01:39:26,968
Separation accomplished.

860
01:39:27,469 --> 01:39:30,346
<i>They are ready to rehydrate.</i>

861
01:39:30,597 --> 01:39:32,640
We are ready to rehydrate.

862
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:45,153
<i>They are ready to rehydrate.</i>

863
01:40:52,387 --> 01:40:55,849
A solemn moment, gentlemen.

864
01:40:58,434 --> 01:41:02,063
One of dedication
and humble supplication.

865
01:41:06,901 --> 01:41:12,115
Robin, prepare to rehydrate.

866
01:41:17,996 --> 01:41:20,248
Ready to rehydrate.

867
01:41:21,291 --> 01:41:24,002
Turn on the water faucet.

868
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:15,261
Success! Success!

869
01:42:16,137 --> 01:42:18,556
<i>They've done it!</i>
<i>They've done it!</i>

870
01:42:18,807 --> 01:42:22,477
Success, success!
We've done it, we've done it!

871
01:42:30,151 --> 01:42:33,029
<i>Success! Success!</i>

872
01:42:44,874 --> 01:42:46,459
What the...?

873
01:42:46,668 --> 01:42:50,088
In the interest of peace,
you must hear me out!

874
01:43:07,939 --> 01:43:13,153
Gentlemen, it is imperative that
we limit our conversation to peace.

875
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:21,536
Who knows, Robin?

876
01:43:21,786 --> 01:43:27,041
This strange mixing of minds...

877
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:32,255
...may be the greatest single service
ever performed for humanity.

878
01:43:33,673 --> 01:43:38,303
Let's go, but inconspicuously.

879
01:43:38,678 --> 01:43:42,682
Through the window.
We'll use our Batropes.

880
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:47,687
Our job is finished.
