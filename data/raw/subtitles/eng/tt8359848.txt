1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The film you are about to see
was born under the sound of the stars.

2
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:56,660
To our makers
Who are no longer with us

3
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:02,583
You have seen a film based on real events
that happened in France in winter 1996

4
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,009
Existence is a fleeting illusion

5
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:56,554
What does dance mean to you?

6
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:57,888
Everything.

7
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:01,559
Dance is everything.

8
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:03,936
It's all I have.

9
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,907
If you couldn't dance,
what would you do?

10
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:11,810
Suicide.

11
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,781
When you're on stage dancing...

12
00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:18,534
you feel free, no barriers,

13
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,618
no judgement.

14
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:22,037
Just us, our body and sensations.

15
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:26,584
I find marijuana is a great muscle relaxant.

16
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:30,462
So when you dance
the sensations are a bit different,

17
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:32,339
you're more sensitive...

18
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:37,845
with certain muscles, or sensations.

19
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,806
When I dance, I can be someone

20
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,475
I can't be anywhere else.

21
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:45,728
OK.

22
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,438
Is your family supportive?

23
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:49,314
Yes.

24
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,525
Mum, dad, everyone...

25
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,193
They know what you dance?

26
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:53,819
Yes.

27
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:55,403
Do they come to watch?

28
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:56,572
No.

29
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:57,656
I prefer not.

30
00:03:58,365 --> 00:03:59,908
What would they say?

31
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,702
They'd be a bit shocked.

32
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:05,789
Would you do anything to make it?

33
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:08,333
Meaning?

34
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:15,841
You're in a profession where...

35
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:17,968
you need to bring enjoyment...

36
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,805
I'm ready for anything.

37
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,098
What's anything?

38
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:24,725
Everything.

39
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,394
I don't know what you'll ask me to do

40
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,771
but I'm primed

41
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:31,774
and honestly, it's a chance in a million

42
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,652
to work with a choreographer like you.

43
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:39,615
It could really help me evolve,

44
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,824
so I'm ready for anything.

45
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,785
I can ask you anything?

46
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,827
Anything.

47
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,371
My worst nightmare?

48
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:49,958
To find myself alone.

49
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,210
With nothing and no one around.

50
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:52,961
Alone.

51
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,006
Do you have a life motto?

52
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,718
"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."

53
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:01,929
Do you believe in paradise?

54
00:05:02,054 --> 00:05:02,888
Yes.

55
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:05,098
Why?

56
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:07,726
Because I want to.

57
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,812
What's in paradise?

58
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:11,980
Everything good.

59
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:13,941
Meaning?

60
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:17,528
Only good things, no problems.

61
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:19,362
There's no chaos there.

62
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,395
I am from Berlin,

63
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:25,523
but I'm happy to leave.

64
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,194
It became too much.
The art scene there is too much

65
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:34,323
I really want to do what I love,

66
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,742
without... being fucked up.

67
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,705
There's a lot of drugs in Berlin.
It's too much.

68
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:47,000
My ex-roommate,
I don't talk to him anymore...

69
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,379
Before I moved out,
he started to take acid in his eyes.

70
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,088
Like actual drops.

71
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,511
So I decided to get away
from all that, because...

72
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:03,014
I don't want to
end up like Christiane F.

73
00:06:03,073 --> 00:06:05,200
I like to let off steam...

74
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:11,624
I have my secret garden that I...

75
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:16,754
I like to go to when I party.

76
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,090
I tried a line of coke once.

77
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,052
You asked me to be open so...

78
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,515
Yeah, I snorted a line with a girlfriend.

79
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,182
My worst nightmare?

80
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:34,688
My worst nightmare?

81
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:36,439
I'm real scared of darkness.

82
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:38,483
Really scared.

83
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:41,654
You know, when you do your own thing,

84
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:43,196
it's make or break.

85
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:49,578
And in my experience, it's mostly break.

86
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,540
I wade right in.

87
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:57,210
If there's a problem,
I deal with it then move on.

88
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:00,548
What's the worst
you've done to a guy in a fight?

89
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:03,216
I smashed a head once.

90
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:07,220
Knocked two of his teeth out.

91
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:09,848
He had a big gash in his forehead.

92
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:11,642
He passed out.

93
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,185
Two days in a coma.

94
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:14,645
Do you regret it?

95
00:07:15,563 --> 00:07:17,064
Not really. That's life.

96
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:18,106
Do you do drugs?

97
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:19,942
No, never.

98
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,946
No drugs. I'm more into girls.

99
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:26,699
What do you think of the other dancers?

100
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:27,825
Some look good.

101
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:29,952
It all seems good.

102
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:31,995
Meaning?

103
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,915
Some of the girls are hot.

104
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,792
Your cousin's your partner in crime?

105
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,711
Yeah, we pick up girls together.

106
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,128
And guys?

107
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,964
Guys, well...

108
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:47,720
Guys... it depends.

109
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:52,850
Straight up, I've never worked with gays before.

110
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:55,143
I'm a little nervous, but...

111
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:56,937
it's no big deal...

112
00:07:57,605 --> 00:07:59,898
I'm just waiting for the first connection.

113
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:03,736
I've heard things but want to see for myself.

114
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:08,240
For sure, I'm a bit nervous about it.

115
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:10,784
But I like that, feeling the fear.

116
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:14,121
Being brother and sister, we're close of course,

117
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:17,708
but with dance we share an activity that...

118
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:21,879
keeps us close.

119
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,964
We'll be touring France and the States.

120
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,173
What do you think?

121
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:28,010
I've been to New York so...

122
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,846
Wow, that's awesome!

123
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,181
We've never been to the US together.

124
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,892
Yes, I've been to New York.

125
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:35,768
Oh?

126
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:36,894
With who?

127
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,147
The US is the place to go.

128
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:43,609
And for black culture too, it's great.

129
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:45,152
America?

130
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,780
America...

131
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:49,740
it's heaven on earth.

132
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,159
You've been there?

133
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:53,243
Never.

134
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:55,328
I come from hell.

135
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:57,998
Where is hell?

136
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:03,962
We're lucky in France to really shine in dance.

137
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:05,463
It's incredible.

138
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:09,176
It would be interesting
to take that to other countries,

139
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,054
like America or places where...

140
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:14,097
the level's not so high.

141
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:17,059
France is a country that really has our back,

142
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:19,812
helping us, with its culture,

143
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:21,772
and music,

144
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:24,817
which really lets us...

145
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:26,819
flourish and...

146
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:28,862
work with a level of excellence.

147
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:30,989
It's the French trademark.

148
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:20,873
PRESENT A FRENCH FILM AND PROUD OF IT

149
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,503
God is with us!

150
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:23,967
Now let's party!

151
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:32,475
I love your kid!

152
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,310
My Tito.

153
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:34,227
Great dancer!

154
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:35,270
Can I dance with him?

155
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:37,981
Go ahead. I made some sangria.

156
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:39,399
Later.

157
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,236
What did you think?

158
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,237
Awesome!

159
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:46,489
Maybe just
the two girls in the middle...

160
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:47,825
Totally get it.

161
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,326
We'll rehearse it later.

162
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:51,244
Everyone's tired,
they wanna have fun.

163
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:52,996
Sure, it's tough.

164
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,833
For just 3 days' work, it was fabulous.

165
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:56,834
What are you discussing?

166
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,543
You! Come talk with me.

167
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:07,385
Yo, David!

168
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:09,944
You do this every time!

169
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:25,362
Sangria?

170
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:26,238
I don't drink.

171
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:27,280
Oh sure.

172
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:28,406
You know it.

173
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:30,242
Cool.

174
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:34,412
Drink?

175
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:35,122
No, thanks.

176
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:36,164
Sure?

177
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:37,332
I don't feel good.

178
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:45,048
Here.

179
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:47,050
Thanks.

180
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:56,143
What do you want?

181
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,395
I told you to stop.

182
00:16:58,521 --> 00:16:59,938
I told you yesterday, please.

183
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:01,439
No one's looking, OK?

184
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,276
Happy now?

185
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:06,403
I wanna be with you.

186
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,154
When?

187
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,405
I'm here now.

188
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:09,698
Go dance!

189
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,336
You! You!

190
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:23,047
That solo, every single time, it's so good!

191
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:24,215
Thank you.

192
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,425
- You're so good.
- You liked it?

193
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:31,054
I couldn't be happier.
Thank you guys, you're amazing.

194
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,217
You...

195
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,680
Sorry!

196
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:33,556
Don't worry.

197
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:35,140
I love your attitude.

198
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:35,724
Thanks.

199
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:38,143
You and Omar have something going...

200
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:39,144
Say what?

201
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:42,272
Great rehearsal, huh?

202
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:42,981
Yeah.

203
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:45,108
I got my eye on you, watch out.

204
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:55,744
Hey Daddy, great track!

205
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:57,412
Up for a drink?

206
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:58,539
No.

207
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:00,373
She'd like one.

208
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:01,208
Thanks.

209
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:05,087
Why so glum?

210
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:06,296
I'm not, I'm just tired.

211
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,506
Stop sulking!

212
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:09,299
I'm tired!

213
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,134
You're always tired!

214
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:14,137
Help me down?

215
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:15,180
No sweat.

216
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,689
It's sangria I made for the dancers.

217
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:25,941
It's alcohol, it's not good for you.

218
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,275
It's not juice.

219
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,026
Alcohol.

220
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:29,695
Give the kid a break!

221
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,739
Come dance with me, Tito!

222
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:37,703
Dance with me!

223
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:02,269
Pump it up, Daddy!

224
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:03,395
How was it?

225
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:05,648
Great!

226
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,274
As usual.

227
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:19,244
What's up?

228
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:22,623
Remember our dance?

229
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:31,114
This way, then like this...

230
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,283
Then like that.

231
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:35,844
Can I have a hug?

232
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:39,222
And another?

233
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:41,642
One more?

234
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:47,856
How hard can you laugh?

235
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,090
Where's your mom?

236
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,275
I'm gonna get changed.

237
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:47,165
What was the deal earlier?

238
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,125
What?

239
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,209
With your bro.

240
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:50,669
You know your pal Taylor...

241
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:52,462
He's afraid I'll get pregnant.

242
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:53,296
Chill.

243
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:24,161
Down the hatch.

244
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:24,912
No.

245
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:30,333
It stinks, why drink it?

246
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:35,964
David!

247
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:40,678
Selva...

248
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,980
I'm worried about the boy.

249
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,232
Why?

250
00:21:54,357 --> 00:21:55,776
He's gone to bed, he's fine.

251
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:56,777
Something wrong?

252
00:21:58,445 --> 00:21:59,655
Nothing at all.

253
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,505
This is not a good place for a kid.

254
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:19,883
Leave it out.

255
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:21,635
He's fine.

256
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,597
He's happy, good mannered.

257
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:26,014
No.

258
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:28,517
Yes, she's raised him well.

259
00:22:28,642 --> 00:22:30,352
She was right to not abort him.

260
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:35,524
Wicked sangria!

261
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:36,859
Wicked!

262
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,404
Have you ever had an abortion?

263
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:48,621
It's good to have the choice.

264
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:51,957
Don't you think?

265
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:56,587
BIRTH IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY

266
00:22:56,712 --> 00:22:58,380
You know mummy was a dancer.

267
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:00,841
When I see you,

268
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:03,093
I see myself as a little girl.

269
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:06,388
I hope you'll be a dancer, like mummy.

270
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:07,598
Yes.

271
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:09,391
Have you spent 3 nice days here?

272
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,894
We don't see each other much, do we?

273
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,604
Today I made an effort.

274
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:14,813
I'm a good mummy?

275
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:15,564
Yes.

276
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:16,732
Give me a kiss.

277
00:23:20,152 --> 00:23:22,404
Close your eyes, go to sleep.

278
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:26,033
Sleep now.

279
00:23:26,158 --> 00:23:28,285
I'll be back later, because I love you.

280
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:30,996
I love you, Tito.

281
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:33,415
That flag over there...

282
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:35,208
It freaks me out.

283
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,251
I don't like it.

284
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:37,711
I like all flags.

285
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,880
The colours and all, it's cool.

286
00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:43,008
But this one... I've seen it too much.

287
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,095
Change of scenery, please!

288
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,056
Those crosses are creepy, man.

289
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:50,891
Chill, it's not contagious.

290
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:54,102
Don't be a prick.

291
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:57,355
God is great.

292
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,066
"God is with us."

293
00:23:59,191 --> 00:24:01,234
Since when have God
and dance gone together?

294
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,444
That's not it.

295
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:04,487
I'm not OK with it.

296
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:06,323
And you?

297
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:08,826
Still the same.

298
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:10,410
Your dad?

299
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:12,705
Still in a coma.

300
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,039
So we wait.

301
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:15,248
How long now?

302
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,461
Almost 6 months.

303
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,088
Long time.

304
00:24:21,213 --> 00:24:21,922
Yep.

305
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,341
If you're down it's complicated,

306
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:25,968
if you ask me...

307
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,222
to take drugs... just...

308
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:32,808
in a safe place.

309
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:35,853
And with my boyfriend I thought...

310
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:37,688
it was safe.

311
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:38,396
Sorry?

312
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:40,190
I thought it was safe

313
00:24:40,858 --> 00:24:41,609
to take it,

314
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:43,318
but you never know
where it comes from.

315
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:45,112
See that babe...

316
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:46,530
I fucked her yesterday.

317
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:49,157
Yesterday, bro.

318
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:50,367
Oh yeah...!

319
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,245
And she's crap.

320
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:57,332
So I wanna fuck two blondes.

321
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:00,685
Stop acting like I don't exist.

322
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:13,529
You're so fuckin' fake.

323
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,365
I'm not fake, you're boring.

324
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:18,186
Dyke stuff never works.

325
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:20,188
They need cock.

326
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:21,148
For sure.

327
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:26,028
Both of them together, fuck it!

328
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:34,327
You asked about me marrying.
Do you want kids?

329
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:36,747
No, fuck that, I never think about it.

330
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:39,124
People ask these dumb questions.

331
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:41,209
"Watch out, he's like this or that,"

332
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:43,003
I don't give a shit.

333
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:44,421
There's a connection,

334
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:46,423
I take it, I live it, period!

335
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:47,299
I move on.

336
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:56,725
What a coke fiend!

337
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,144
Always snorting.

338
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:02,439
It stinks. Stinks.

339
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:05,483
You said you want to get married?

340
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:06,109
Yes.

341
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:06,985
I heard right?

342
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,945
Yes.

343
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,071
How many times?

344
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:10,363
Once!

345
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:12,032
Just once.

346
00:26:12,157 --> 00:26:13,867
I'd like to marry 4 times.

347
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,328
Best to do it often.

348
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:19,873
Change the game, the person, everything...

349
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:22,417
How does she do it, at her age?

350
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:25,170
Honestly...

351
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:27,590
he must totally manipulate her.

352
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:30,383
He's hungry.

353
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:31,844
He's tried to screw us all.

354
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:34,137
A climber. Why's he with the boss lady?

355
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:35,180
To go places.

356
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:37,516
He's with everyone.

357
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:41,269
With her he's just looking for work.

358
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:44,189
We hit lucky here...

359
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:47,109
Bro! Omar!

360
00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:48,318
Wake up!

361
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:49,862
Get out of your trip!

362
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:52,114
You don't drink, you do nothing.

363
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:54,074
I've boned them all here.

364
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:54,617
All of them.

365
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:58,245
David? He's a ticket to an STD.

366
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,080
That's mean.

367
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:01,373
He's my buddy!

368
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,084
He's nice, but...

369
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:06,504
He should...

370
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:08,547
I bet he has herpes.

371
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,673
He's dirty.

372
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:12,134
Just the way he looks at you...

373
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:13,844
Cut it out!

374
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,303
It can be a turn-on.

375
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,890
Ok, he's a sonofabitch!

376
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:20,392
He has his charms.

377
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:22,477
Is he a good lay at least?

378
00:27:22,603 --> 00:27:23,521
A top shooter!

379
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:25,564
Sometimes they make out like...

380
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:26,899
No, really!

381
00:27:27,024 --> 00:27:28,108
Have you two screwed?

382
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:31,361
No, but he's banged
someone next to me.

383
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:32,445
A young chick...

384
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:33,864
You gang bang?

385
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,490
He fucked her brains out.

386
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:37,993
Tell me about Gazelle.

387
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:39,537
Just a little.

388
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:40,579
I'm curious.

389
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:42,414
Please?

390
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,543
Just a little, no details if she's ass or pussy.

391
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:49,421
Just... how nuts she goes.

392
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:51,464
You live your life, I live mine.

393
00:27:52,215 --> 00:27:54,259
Your life is mine as well.

394
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:55,302
Get off my case.

395
00:27:56,554 --> 00:27:58,556
I don't get it, I'm reacting...

396
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,599
No, I don't see why you react like that.

397
00:28:00,724 --> 00:28:03,226
What makes Omar special?

398
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:04,186
Everything.

399
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:05,395
Oh yeah?

400
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:06,479
He's got everything!

401
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:08,148
Know what?

402
00:28:08,273 --> 00:28:09,274
I wanna bone her.

403
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,110
I'm not surprised.

404
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:14,613
Honestly, I wanna bone her.

405
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:16,323
You're a lucky man.

406
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:17,991
You're not as tough as me.

407
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:22,871
So, let's ask her.

408
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:24,582
Maybe we can do a threesome?

409
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,668
You say: "It's the last night,

410
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:31,505
"everything sucks,

411
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,507
"the sex...

412
00:28:33,632 --> 00:28:35,300
"it's not like before...

413
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:38,887
"Nowadays, group sex is the thing, all that stuff."

414
00:28:39,012 --> 00:28:40,263
And we do it.

415
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:41,181
What bugs you?

416
00:28:41,306 --> 00:28:42,182
Seeing you together.

417
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:43,183
I don't like him.

418
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:45,185
We may seem buddies but we're not.

419
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,269
So what?

420
00:28:47,563 --> 00:28:48,981
I'm your big brother.

421
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:51,525
I'm 20, not a baby anymore.

422
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:52,651
So?

423
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,320
You disrespect me.

424
00:28:55,988 --> 00:28:58,490
He seems totally uptight.

425
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:00,909
Only with you!

426
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,077
Say what?

427
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:03,704
What it says.

428
00:29:04,204 --> 00:29:05,623
You're not my mum or dad.

429
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:06,582
Just my big brother.

430
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:07,165
So?

431
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,876
You're 25. I'm 20, an adult.

432
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,460
But you're...

433
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:12,630
still too young for that.

434
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,881
For what?

435
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:15,549
What you do with Omar.

436
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:17,134
You know what we do?

437
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,344
I see enough.

438
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:21,054
No need for details.

439
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,056
You've had your dick sucked already.

440
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:23,891
So?

441
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:26,769
That doesn't mean you can suck his...

442
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,353
any time you like!

443
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:30,523
That's not how it goes.

444
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:34,109
It's normal when
you've been together 9 months, no?

445
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:35,694
9 months, you two?

446
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:36,904
He didn't tell you?

447
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:37,655
No.

448
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,489
Think it's funny?

449
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:41,784
This place has seen some weird shit.

450
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:44,662
I can feel it,

451
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,415
sacrifices... strange shit, for sure.

452
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,376
You mean like a sect?

453
00:29:51,502 --> 00:29:52,628
All that stuff.

454
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:55,422
How can you walk in a room
and see a flag like that?

455
00:29:55,548 --> 00:29:56,339
No way.

456
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:58,425
No way!

457
00:29:58,551 --> 00:30:00,678
I don't dig the vibe in this group.

458
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:02,680
They're weird.

459
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:04,723
And this school...

460
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,600
intensifies it.

461
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:09,562
It magnifies the sense of weirdness.

462
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:11,730
Weird or not...

463
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,106
I'll fuck them all!

464
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:16,569
Straight up!

465
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:19,572
Weird or not, I fuck them.

466
00:30:19,697 --> 00:30:20,488
True...

467
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:23,116
Even if the ghost turns up.

468
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:24,326
On the flag!

469
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:26,244
We'll fuck him on the flag!

470
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,831
Ghost or no, he'll get some!

471
00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:31,291
I'm sick of all the
fathers and brothers

472
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,752
on our case all the time,
telling us what to do.

473
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:36,379
Who you can or can't see. Enough already.

474
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:38,632
There's more to life than men.

475
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:39,675
Too right.

476
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:41,719
There are girls...

477
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:43,596
nice ones too, huh?

478
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:45,514
Like who?

479
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:48,350
Some cute ones in the group.

480
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:50,644
Don't you think?

481
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:51,604
Like me?

482
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:54,356
You know already, I told you.

483
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,483
So why bring it up?

484
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:59,737
I'm not, it just came up...

485
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,532
You're up for some filthy shit, man.

486
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:06,451
Hell, yeah.

487
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,747
I'm gonna beat those two up tonight.

488
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:13,041
They deserve it.

489
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,459
Too true.

490
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:16,211
I'm getting a real good vibe now...

491
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,921
Real good!

492
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:20,674
I'm ready for some crazy shit!

493
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,594
You're too unstable, that's your trouble.

494
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:26,639
Learn to keep it in your pants.

495
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:28,431
You only live once, bro.

496
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:30,809
When it's long like mine...

497
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:32,185
you gotta use it.

498
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,395
It's a gift!

499
00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:36,607
I gotta share it.

500
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:47,242
I bet they do it with strap-ons.

501
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:50,788
I don't dig that shit.

502
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:54,249
I'd fuck Psyche good.

503
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:55,626
So good.

504
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:58,253
When she does her wacko
workout thing, I love it!

505
00:31:58,378 --> 00:31:59,421
On the floor.

506
00:31:59,547 --> 00:32:01,256
On the floor! Straight in!

507
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:02,257
Bare knees!

508
00:32:02,382 --> 00:32:03,383
Bare knees!

509
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:04,552
No lube.

510
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:07,304
Wet or not, I keep at it!

511
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:08,764
I keep at it anyway!

512
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,141
You keep at it. You slap her!

513
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:12,392
No other way.

514
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:15,052
<i>It's party time!</i>

515
00:32:15,478 --> 00:32:17,147
A babe like that?

516
00:32:17,272 --> 00:32:20,526
When I stick my cock in,
it goes all the way up to her throat.

517
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:23,403
I don't stop till she weeps.

518
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:24,404
Till she weeps!

519
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,488
Gotta make her weep!

520
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:27,199
I love her.

521
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:32,705
Despite her flaws, her mistakes...

522
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:34,247
I love her.

523
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:38,502
So you'll get back with her?

524
00:32:39,712 --> 00:32:41,880
I'd like to.

525
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:45,217
Too bad she's pregnant.

526
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:46,677
It's someone else's.

527
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:50,472
Her "sweet butterfly," she says.

528
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:52,182
She's pregnant?

529
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:52,975
Yes.

530
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:54,518
By another guy?

531
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:55,393
Yes.

532
00:32:58,313 --> 00:32:59,523
Imagine...

533
00:33:00,816 --> 00:33:02,693
your dream man...

534
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:05,863
in love with someone else.

535
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:07,280
Lou, she's hot.

536
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:08,866
Think she takes it up the ass?

537
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:10,909
Hell yeah, all the way!

538
00:33:11,744 --> 00:33:12,953
Deep inside.

539
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:15,873
Dry or with lube?

540
00:33:15,998 --> 00:33:17,666
Dry, man!

541
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,296
You grab her,

542
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:25,674
spread her arms...

543
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:30,513
Badass!

544
00:33:31,597 --> 00:33:32,556
That's how it goes!

545
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:33,348
Dry.

546
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:34,141
Dry!

547
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:34,933
No jelly.

548
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,770
I hate that stuff.

549
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:39,647
I prefer shea butter.

550
00:33:39,772 --> 00:33:41,189
It's the real deal.

551
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:42,608
Slides right in.

552
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:45,903
You have to pull her hair, for sure.

553
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:46,654
The basics.

554
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:47,738
I bang her.

555
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:48,697
I fuck her.

556
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:50,741
I'm telling you...

557
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:52,034
that girl...

558
00:33:53,368 --> 00:33:54,745
She's a big deal.

559
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,871
Give it to her good!

560
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:56,997
Nice sweet ass.

561
00:33:57,748 --> 00:33:59,041
Fuck her real good.

562
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:03,546
Then again... no sweat.

563
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:04,713
Sure.

564
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:05,881
Selva's my pick.

565
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:09,927
When she walks that way I wanna bang her.

566
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:11,887
When she talks or looks at you...

567
00:34:12,012 --> 00:34:12,846
Showing off.

568
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:14,264
It's too much.

569
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,390
I get it.

570
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:17,309
You gotta show her who's...

571
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:18,977
Gonna show her what I got...

572
00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:20,353
An anaconda!

573
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:21,522
That chick...

574
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:24,066
One day, after rehearsal...

575
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:26,985
you follow her upstairs...

576
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,403
you follow her.

577
00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:29,738
You show her.

578
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:31,323
Just show her!

579
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:34,367
Show it to her!

580
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,579
My willy?

581
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:37,830
You know what.

582
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:39,247
She'll freak out.

583
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:40,248
That's life, man!

584
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:42,543
I stick it straight in her ass.

585
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:43,627
No waiting.

586
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:44,503
Straight in.

587
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:45,671
In the ass.

588
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:48,674
I'm not annoyed, but you don't listen.

589
00:34:50,092 --> 00:34:51,343
It gets a little...

590
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:53,721
I'm sick and tired of it.

591
00:34:54,513 --> 00:34:55,305
What?

592
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,599
Waiting!

593
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:58,391
After a while, you know...

594
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:00,603
It's best to wait.

595
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:03,021
You're young. You're rich.

596
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:05,983
You'll get plenty of cock.

597
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:07,317
Sicko!

598
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:10,028
No need to do it all right now.

599
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:12,531
Take your time, be different.

600
00:35:12,656 --> 00:35:14,575
I bet David will take two days.

601
00:35:16,118 --> 00:35:17,745
David will never go with you.

602
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,871
You'll see...

603
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:21,582
Selva won't let him.

604
00:35:21,707 --> 00:35:23,000
Screw Selva.

605
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,043
I don't know if you get it, but...

606
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:26,712
who gives a fuck about Selva?

607
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:29,006
Who is she, anyway?

608
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:32,926
Get me David and wham bam it's done.

609
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,678
Do as you like.

610
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:36,429
You always do.

611
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:38,056
That's what I said I'd do!

612
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:40,183
Yep! That's why you're still a virgin.

613
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:43,020
Not for long!

614
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:44,730
With David, for sure!

615
00:35:45,814 --> 00:35:46,899
He's clearly a virgin.

616
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,026
It's gotta happen.

617
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:50,944
He gotta get his butthole split.

618
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:52,696
Nice and wide.

619
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:54,698
With a baton.

620
00:35:57,868 --> 00:35:58,744
A big one.

621
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:02,414
You know the score: first they squeal,

622
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,332
then they're happy and want more.

623
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:05,793
I won't touch no butthole, man.

624
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:07,545
Butthole's not my thing.

625
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,629
Smells of shit.

626
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:10,756
Oh, come on!

627
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,801
No butts.

628
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:15,010
Know what you do?

629
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:16,178
You lick it.

630
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,345
What?

631
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,471
The butthole!

632
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:22,810
Crazy!

633
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:23,727
Lick it good.

634
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,604
Stick your tongue in.

635
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:26,814
Even when it stinks?

636
00:36:26,939 --> 00:36:28,691
Don't worry, man.

637
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:30,901
It's nature!

638
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:31,735
You kidding?

639
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,403
Occupational hazard, bro.

640
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:35,698
You've had a babe poop on you?

641
00:36:35,823 --> 00:36:37,449
No, but hey...

642
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:38,909
Shit happens!

643
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:41,078
Occupational hazard!

644
00:36:42,037 --> 00:36:44,456
It's a risk, you go down there,

645
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:46,667
you know what you'll find.

646
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:49,044
If you find it, don't act surprised.

647
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:50,713
No way, man...

648
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:53,924
It's double or quits.
In, out, in, out...

649
00:36:57,595 --> 00:36:59,930
I've put Tito to bed, I'm worn out.

650
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:01,682
Gimme a smoke.

651
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:02,933
He's a cute kid.

652
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:06,895
You start dancing young,
you're hot to trot.

653
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,146
And then...

654
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:12,693
You get screwed in some corner,

655
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:14,528
then you get pregnant.

656
00:37:14,653 --> 00:37:16,488
So what do you do?

657
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:18,699
You have to make your big mistakes

658
00:37:18,824 --> 00:37:20,242
a success.

659
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:23,579
I don't even know
what time the van's coming tomorrow.

660
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:25,956
And everyone's dancing happily.

661
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:28,876
The only thing I've ever done right
is this sangria.

662
00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:31,003
It's real good.

663
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:35,841
That's it.

664
00:45:57,801 --> 00:46:00,012
This is for France, guys!

665
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,556
Let's slaughter those yanks!

666
00:46:02,681 --> 00:46:05,100
Slaughter them!

667
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:08,270
This is War!

668
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,055
Brought you:

669
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:36,949
Dancing to music by:

670
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,757
Filmed by:

671
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:28,450
It's hot in here!

672
00:47:29,284 --> 00:47:31,120
Booty parade!

673
00:47:32,912 --> 00:47:35,456
- Lou, do you want my glass?
- No thanks.

674
00:47:36,374 --> 00:47:38,792
You know what?
The sangria is halal.

675
00:47:39,335 --> 00:47:40,503
Oh shit.

676
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:51,803
I feel weird.

677
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:53,889
Go drink some water.

678
00:48:09,892 --> 00:48:10,893
Selva.

679
00:48:11,894 --> 00:48:13,311
Gimme some coke.

680
00:48:13,436 --> 00:48:14,062
Huh?

681
00:48:14,187 --> 00:48:15,147
Some coke.

682
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:17,525
None left.

683
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,192
Ask the druggy.

684
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:30,120
Gimme some coke, babe.

685
00:48:30,245 --> 00:48:31,371
I'm all out.

686
00:48:31,496 --> 00:48:32,372
I heard you had some.

687
00:48:32,497 --> 00:48:33,498
It's all gone.

688
00:48:35,584 --> 00:48:36,835
All cool?

689
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,754
I'm cool. Gimme a light.

690
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:42,132
Daddy, look!

691
00:48:42,257 --> 00:48:43,759
Look...!

692
00:48:43,884 --> 00:48:44,718
Over there.

693
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:01,401
What are you doing?

694
00:49:01,527 --> 00:49:02,319
Gazelle!

695
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:03,571
I'm burning!

696
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:05,698
Something's kicking in.

697
00:49:09,702 --> 00:49:10,536
Gazelle!

698
00:49:11,203 --> 00:49:11,995
I'm off.

699
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:47,364
Bravo!

700
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:50,659
Way to party!

701
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:03,672
What's going on?

702
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:06,049
We're partying, chill.

703
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:09,261
Go dance and have fun, you earned it.

704
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,012
Dance, baby!

705
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:41,043
What have you done?

706
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:43,420
What do you mean?

707
00:50:44,713 --> 00:50:46,006
I haven't done anything.

708
00:50:58,811 --> 00:50:59,436
Selva!

709
00:51:00,062 --> 00:51:01,354
I've done nothing.

710
00:51:03,524 --> 00:51:04,441
What's wrong?

711
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:05,483
I don't know.

712
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:07,778
She's feeling sick?

713
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,779
I don't know.

714
00:51:10,906 --> 00:51:11,657
Selva?

715
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:14,326
You OK?

716
00:51:16,411 --> 00:51:18,581
You're all too drunk,
I'm going to bed.

717
00:51:49,862 --> 00:51:51,697
What's up? Feel sick?

718
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:00,455
Selva?

719
00:52:07,755 --> 00:52:08,964
Don't you guys feel weird?

720
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:10,633
What've you done?

721
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:13,511
What did you put in the sangria?
I don't feel good.

722
00:52:13,636 --> 00:52:14,553
What are you talking about?

723
00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:17,347
What? I haven't done anything.

724
00:52:17,472 --> 00:52:18,431
What've you done?

725
00:52:18,557 --> 00:52:19,975
What's wrong with you all?

726
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,893
Daddy!

727
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:23,729
That bitch spiked our drinks!

728
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:29,401
The sangria's spiked, it's not me,
I drank it too.

729
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:31,361
So that's why I feel bad.

730
00:52:31,486 --> 00:52:32,445
It's not me.

731
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:34,031
What did you put in it?

732
00:52:34,156 --> 00:52:35,908
Here's the bitter slut.

733
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:37,743
I drank it too!

734
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:40,495
Stop!

735
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:42,831
Hear her out!

736
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:44,875
It must be someone who didn't drink it.

737
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,836
I know who it is.
It's Omar, the sonofabitch!

738
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,005
It's not him!

739
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,507
Why haven't you drunk it?

740
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:52,508
You spiked it with LSD?

741
00:52:52,633 --> 00:52:53,676
It's not him!

742
00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:55,010
Why did you do it?

743
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,639
He drugged us!

744
00:52:58,764 --> 00:52:59,515
It's him!

745
00:53:01,517 --> 00:53:02,434
Stop, stop!

746
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,476
Get out!!

747
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:04,477
Stop!

748
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:17,741
Asshole!

749
00:53:19,577 --> 00:53:20,619
Open up!

750
00:53:21,787 --> 00:53:22,788
Let me go!

751
00:53:33,674 --> 00:53:34,758
Is LSD acid?

752
00:53:34,883 --> 00:53:35,593
I don't know!

753
00:53:35,718 --> 00:53:36,802
What's the remedy?

754
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:37,595
Coke.

755
00:53:38,053 --> 00:53:38,762
Coke.

756
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:43,809
Hand it over, we need it.

757
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:45,477
I'm out, fuck off!

758
00:53:46,895 --> 00:53:47,855
It's not you?

759
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,647
No.

760
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:49,397
Are you sure?

761
00:53:49,523 --> 00:53:51,859
We're all fucking high.

762
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:53,986
We're all fucking high,
can't you see?

763
00:53:57,698 --> 00:53:58,574
You OK?

764
00:53:58,699 --> 00:53:59,742
No, can't you see?

765
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:00,868
Did you see your son?

766
00:54:00,993 --> 00:54:01,827
Fuck!

767
00:54:05,831 --> 00:54:06,665
Don't drink that!

768
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:08,959
You mustn't.

769
00:54:09,084 --> 00:54:09,752
Come on!

770
00:54:09,877 --> 00:54:10,961
No, mummy!

771
00:54:11,086 --> 00:54:12,004
They're all crazy in here!

772
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:15,382
Mummy, no!

773
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:16,509
Calm down!

774
00:54:18,552 --> 00:54:19,595
Stop tugging!

775
00:54:23,223 --> 00:54:24,933
Come on, stop that!

776
00:54:28,854 --> 00:54:30,105
Mummy...

777
00:54:31,524 --> 00:54:32,525
No...

778
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:36,737
No, mummy, you're mean!

779
00:54:36,862 --> 00:54:38,071
I love you!

780
00:54:38,196 --> 00:54:39,823
I'm doing it to protect you.

781
00:54:41,033 --> 00:54:42,034
You're mean!

782
00:54:46,038 --> 00:54:47,956
Listen, listen to me.

783
00:54:48,081 --> 00:54:49,249
Don't touch that!

784
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,001
Don't touch it!

785
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:53,128
It'll kill you if you touch it.

786
00:54:53,253 --> 00:54:54,254
No, mummy!

787
00:54:56,632 --> 00:54:58,050
Don't leave me alone!

788
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:01,303
Open the door!

789
00:55:02,638 --> 00:55:03,722
I can't!

790
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:05,766
I'll be back, I'll sort it out.

791
00:55:05,891 --> 00:55:07,643
I'll be back, don't worry.

792
00:55:08,226 --> 00:55:09,687
I'll be back.

793
00:55:09,812 --> 00:55:11,939
I love you. Calm down, please.

794
00:55:12,064 --> 00:55:13,065
What are you doing?

795
00:55:15,734 --> 00:55:17,027
Protecting him from you!

796
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:17,945
From who?

797
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,071
All of you!

798
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:44,805
Go fuck yourself!

799
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,098
Dumb bitch!

800
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:47,850
Useless cunt!

801
00:56:01,238 --> 00:56:02,072
Selva?

802
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:03,907
Selva!

803
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:08,724
I'm talking to you.

804
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,353
Do you hear me?

805
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:15,939
I need you.

806
00:56:33,245 --> 00:56:34,705
I'm sorry.

807
00:56:41,236 --> 00:56:41,945
What's wrong?

808
00:56:44,907 --> 00:56:46,199
I don't feel good.

809
00:56:46,324 --> 00:56:48,035
You drank too?

810
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,952
No, I didn't.

811
00:56:52,998 --> 00:56:54,792
So why do you feel sick?

812
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,425
Are you ok?

813
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,096
The sangria's been spiked by Emmanuelle.

814
00:57:08,221 --> 00:57:09,139
I don't know...

815
00:57:09,264 --> 00:57:10,891
What's wrong with you all?

816
00:57:12,225 --> 00:57:13,852
What's wrong with you all?

817
00:57:15,813 --> 00:57:17,022
Why do you feel sick?

818
00:57:21,443 --> 00:57:23,278
Can you keep a secret?

819
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:24,780
Yes.

820
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:26,281
Always.

821
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:28,708
Selva.

822
00:57:30,035 --> 00:57:31,787
Can you keep one for me?

823
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:34,790
Please?

824
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,377
Of course.

825
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:40,879
I have...

826
00:57:44,717 --> 00:57:48,220
I have something growing in my tummy.

827
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:54,893
Like what?

828
00:57:56,269 --> 00:57:57,896
I'm pregnant, Selva!

829
00:58:01,483 --> 00:58:02,234
Shit.

830
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:05,779
Yep.

831
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:08,281
Shit.

832
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:11,744
What'll you do?

833
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:13,203
I don't know.

834
00:58:16,164 --> 00:58:17,249
Who's the dad?

835
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:20,085
No idea.

836
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:23,213
I don't know.

837
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:26,509
I'm wasted...

838
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:28,552
You gals too?

839
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:30,303
I'm fine.

840
00:58:30,428 --> 00:58:31,514
You're alright?

841
00:58:34,517 --> 00:58:36,143
Could you leave us?

842
00:58:36,268 --> 00:58:37,728
Why?

843
00:58:37,853 --> 00:58:39,271
She's weird.

844
00:58:41,273 --> 00:58:42,482
You didn't drink...

845
00:58:43,942 --> 00:58:45,152
No, she didn't...

846
00:58:46,278 --> 00:58:47,362
She feels sick.

847
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,240
Me too.

848
00:58:50,365 --> 00:58:51,742
Could you please just...

849
00:58:51,867 --> 00:58:53,243
Strange, why didn't you drink?

850
00:58:53,368 --> 00:58:55,120
I feel sick, it happens!

851
00:58:57,455 --> 00:58:58,957
You drugged us, huh?

852
00:58:59,082 --> 00:58:59,917
No!

853
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:01,209
She didn't.

854
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:04,462
Dom, please!

855
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:05,839
You drugged us.

856
00:59:05,964 --> 00:59:06,799
Not true!

857
00:59:06,924 --> 00:59:07,883
You're talking shit!

858
00:59:09,301 --> 00:59:10,427
Are you nuts?

859
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:11,344
You drugged us.

860
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:13,847
Go dance with the crew.

861
00:59:13,972 --> 00:59:15,599
I threw Omar out for nothing...

862
00:59:17,893 --> 00:59:18,852
Because of you.

863
00:59:20,103 --> 00:59:20,896
Why didn't you drink?

864
00:59:21,021 --> 00:59:21,772
She's pregnant!

865
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:23,398
Wait a sec, please!

866
00:59:23,524 --> 00:59:24,441
You're pregnant?

867
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:26,276
Pregnant, you lying bitch?

868
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:33,283
Lying cunt!

869
00:59:34,577 --> 00:59:35,536
Bitch!

870
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,413
Whore.

871
00:59:49,216 --> 00:59:50,926
Call an ambulance!

872
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:55,639
Will somebody help me?

873
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,191
Lou?

874
01:00:08,902 --> 01:00:10,237
What's wrong, Lou?

875
01:00:12,072 --> 01:00:12,948
What happened?

876
01:00:35,596 --> 01:00:36,764
Oh God...

877
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:38,348
You're such a bitch!

878
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:40,392
You had some all along.

879
01:00:41,393 --> 01:00:42,645
So gimme some.

880
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:43,646
Get off me.

881
01:01:03,165 --> 01:01:03,957
Lou!

882
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,334
Wait!

883
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:07,503
Go away!

884
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:09,254
Go away!

885
01:01:13,008 --> 01:01:14,176
Dom!

886
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:15,468
I'll kill you!

887
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:17,638
I'll kill you!

888
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:23,101
Mummy!

889
01:01:23,226 --> 01:01:24,436
There are cockroaches!

890
01:01:33,612 --> 01:01:34,738
It's a nightmare!

891
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,532
A nightmare.

892
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,913
What's going on?

893
01:01:43,038 --> 01:01:44,289
What's going on in here?

894
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,043
Dom!

895
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:49,628
Someone...

896
01:02:00,313 --> 01:02:02,440
Do you want to see my anaconda?

897
01:02:05,818 --> 01:02:08,028
Where is Dom?
Where is Dom?

898
01:02:15,112 --> 01:02:15,738
Hey Taylor!

899
01:02:16,321 --> 01:02:17,322
Check out your sister.

900
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:19,617
Check her out!

901
01:02:27,374 --> 01:02:28,250
What are you doing?

902
01:02:36,091 --> 01:02:37,342
Why did you do that?

903
01:02:40,095 --> 01:02:41,054
She hit me!

904
01:02:41,179 --> 01:02:42,139
Look!

905
01:02:42,723 --> 01:02:44,307
We kicked the wrong guy out.

906
01:02:44,432 --> 01:02:45,643
It wasn't Omar, it's her!

907
01:02:45,768 --> 01:02:47,310
She poisoned us.

908
01:02:48,562 --> 01:02:49,437
You drugged us?

909
01:02:49,563 --> 01:02:50,438
Yes she did.

910
01:02:50,564 --> 01:02:51,690
What do you mean?

911
01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:52,983
Know what?

912
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:54,527
She claims she's pregnant.

913
01:02:54,652 --> 01:02:55,736
Who's the dad?

914
01:02:56,444 --> 01:02:57,404
Who is it?

915
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:58,906
Who wants you?

916
01:02:59,031 --> 01:02:59,532
You're a liar!

917
01:02:59,657 --> 01:03:01,074
Who fucked you?

918
01:03:02,743 --> 01:03:04,327
You're pregnant so you didn't drink?!

919
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:05,328
You did it!

920
01:03:05,453 --> 01:03:06,454
No!

921
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,373
Shut the fuck up!

922
01:03:09,082 --> 01:03:10,626
What the fuck are you saying?

923
01:03:11,209 --> 01:03:12,545
What are you talking about?

924
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:14,505
It's the son of David!

925
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:16,173
Get off me!

926
01:03:20,553 --> 01:03:21,637
Go for her!

927
01:03:23,556 --> 01:03:24,640
You're threatening me?

928
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,725
What are you gonna do?

929
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:29,477
Want to hit me again?

930
01:03:29,603 --> 01:03:30,646
She hit me!

931
01:03:35,818 --> 01:03:37,360
Shut up!

932
01:03:37,485 --> 01:03:37,861
Fuck off!

933
01:03:39,362 --> 01:03:40,072
Do it!

934
01:03:40,197 --> 01:03:41,699
I'll make you abort!

935
01:03:41,824 --> 01:03:42,783
Gazelle!

936
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:46,119
Go on, do it!

937
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,308
Do it!

938
01:04:09,101 --> 01:04:11,228
Go on, kill yourself!

939
01:04:11,895 --> 01:04:13,271
Go on!

940
01:04:14,565 --> 01:04:15,482
Do it!

941
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:16,650
Do it!

942
01:04:31,874 --> 01:04:33,333
Stop!

943
01:04:34,668 --> 01:04:36,294
Stop, please.

944
01:04:37,671 --> 01:04:39,214
Gazelle!

945
01:04:43,677 --> 01:04:44,344
Lou!

946
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:46,346
Stop it!

947
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:47,765
Stop it!

948
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:48,807
Get off me!

949
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:50,518
It's not your fault.

950
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:53,353
Leave her!

951
01:04:53,478 --> 01:04:54,813
Leave her, Eva!

952
01:05:05,407 --> 01:05:07,576
You don't get it, I don't want to!

953
01:05:16,669 --> 01:05:18,504
Let's get outta here.

954
01:05:24,593 --> 01:05:25,803
Come on Selva, we're leaving.

955
01:05:34,728 --> 01:05:35,521
Mummy!

956
01:05:37,272 --> 01:05:38,231
Mummy!

957
01:05:45,363 --> 01:05:46,198
Come on.

958
01:05:46,323 --> 01:05:47,449
We're leaving.

959
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:50,493
It's out of control.

960
01:09:41,725 --> 01:09:43,977
Stop crying, please.

961
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,149
We'll leave together.

962
01:09:49,775 --> 01:09:51,068
I'll find the key.

963
01:09:51,193 --> 01:09:53,153
I'll find it, don't worry.

964
01:09:53,654 --> 01:09:54,738
Open the door.

965
01:09:55,614 --> 01:09:57,533
I lost the key.

966
01:09:59,201 --> 01:10:00,118
Go find it.

967
01:10:00,243 --> 01:10:01,286
I lost it.

968
01:10:01,411 --> 01:10:02,788
Go find it!

969
01:10:02,913 --> 01:10:04,206
I'm scared!

970
01:10:05,165 --> 01:10:07,793
Open the door, I'm scared.

971
01:10:11,463 --> 01:10:12,881
Open the door.

972
01:10:13,006 --> 01:10:13,799
Please!

973
01:10:13,924 --> 01:10:14,883
Everything's fine.

974
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:20,472
Something's moving here!

975
01:10:23,058 --> 01:10:24,476
It's a party...

976
01:10:26,895 --> 01:10:29,481
There's balloons and surprises...

977
01:10:59,261 --> 01:11:00,888
Mummy!

978
01:11:03,932 --> 01:11:05,601
Mummy!

979
01:12:18,924 --> 01:12:20,634
The keys must be here...

980
01:12:34,857 --> 01:12:35,774
Come here!

981
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:36,692
Motherfucker!

982
01:12:36,817 --> 01:12:37,693
Shithead!

983
01:12:38,902 --> 01:12:39,987
Bring him here.

984
01:12:42,114 --> 01:12:43,031
Fuck him up!

985
01:12:43,156 --> 01:12:43,991
Harder!

986
01:12:44,116 --> 01:12:44,783
Harder!

987
01:12:57,129 --> 01:12:58,171
Slimy shit!

988
01:12:59,339 --> 01:13:00,591
Gimme a knife!

989
01:13:00,716 --> 01:13:01,717
I'll circumcise him!

990
01:13:03,426 --> 01:13:04,678
Get off him.

991
01:13:22,738 --> 01:13:23,656
You're sick.

992
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:27,826
Take that.

993
01:13:29,327 --> 01:13:30,412
Don't wanna play with me?

994
01:13:43,133 --> 01:13:44,301
What are you doing?

995
01:13:44,426 --> 01:13:45,886
Gimme that!

996
01:13:46,011 --> 01:13:46,679
What?

997
01:13:46,804 --> 01:13:47,721
The lipstick!

998
01:13:47,846 --> 01:13:48,681
That hurts!

999
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:49,431
Let go!

1000
01:13:49,557 --> 01:13:50,307
That hurts!

1001
01:13:51,183 --> 01:13:52,475
Let go, dammit.

1002
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,856
Come here, fucker!

1003
01:13:57,981 --> 01:13:58,899
Thought you were badass?

1004
01:13:59,024 --> 01:14:00,067
Huh, asshole?

1005
01:14:07,282 --> 01:14:08,450
Piece of white shit!

1006
01:14:08,576 --> 01:14:09,451
Motherfucker!

1007
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:12,287
Get off!

1008
01:14:28,053 --> 01:14:30,222
Help me, please...

1009
01:14:31,765 --> 01:14:33,016
Please...

1010
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:39,231
Please!

1011
01:14:40,733 --> 01:14:41,775
Please...

1012
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:21,533
Selva, come with me.

1013
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,487
Shit! Tito's fried!

1014
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:16,119
Oh God, I've killed him!

1015
01:16:16,244 --> 01:16:17,079
I've killed him!

1016
01:16:17,204 --> 01:16:18,163
Fried!

1017
01:16:19,122 --> 01:16:20,207
Tito!

1018
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:22,250
Stop screaming!

1019
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,836
Music!

1020
01:16:25,629 --> 01:16:26,463
Music!

1021
01:16:26,589 --> 01:16:28,591
It's OK.
I got my ghetto blaster!

1022
01:16:32,344 --> 01:16:33,846
I'll put it on, don't worry.

1023
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:58,370
Open the door, Tito!

1024
01:16:59,329 --> 01:17:00,372
Open up!

1025
01:18:05,688 --> 01:18:06,689
What are you doing?

1026
01:18:06,814 --> 01:18:08,023
The blood!

1027
01:18:08,148 --> 01:18:10,108
The blood... the blood...

1028
01:19:57,883 --> 01:19:58,967
Selva.

1029
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:02,729
Get out! Get out!

1030
01:20:17,784 --> 01:20:20,286
What do you want?
Why...

1031
01:20:20,823 --> 01:20:21,824
What do you want?

1032
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,202
Get out.

1033
01:20:26,078 --> 01:20:28,121
I don't want to see you any more.

1034
01:20:28,581 --> 01:20:30,332
I don't want to see you!

1035
01:20:46,682 --> 01:20:48,266
Leave the girls be.

1036
01:21:19,882 --> 01:21:21,884
Baby, don't cry!

1037
01:21:23,385 --> 01:21:24,887
My little baby.

1038
01:21:29,767 --> 01:21:30,893
Everything will be fine.

1039
01:21:32,645 --> 01:21:33,771
We're home.

1040
01:21:33,896 --> 01:21:34,897
Daddy, I'm scared.

1041
01:21:38,441 --> 01:21:39,527
What's happening?

1042
01:21:39,652 --> 01:21:40,653
We're home.

1043
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:42,571
Riley?

1044
01:21:44,948 --> 01:21:46,408
Leave me alone!

1045
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:47,785
Get out!

1046
01:21:48,368 --> 01:21:49,286
Just get out!

1047
01:21:51,705 --> 01:21:52,831
Get out!

1048
01:22:10,974 --> 01:22:11,892
What's going on?

1049
01:22:12,392 --> 01:22:13,268
Get off!

1050
01:22:15,521 --> 01:22:16,647
Get the fuck out of here!

1051
01:22:16,772 --> 01:22:17,606
Gazelle!

1052
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:22,485
Gazelle!

1053
01:22:23,612 --> 01:22:24,487
Wait!

1054
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:32,454
Wait!

1055
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,543
It's too dangerous!

1056
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:43,131
Wait up.

1057
01:22:44,091 --> 01:22:44,967
It's far too dangerous!

1058
01:22:45,092 --> 01:22:46,134
I'm gonna kill myself!

1059
01:22:47,135 --> 01:22:48,428
I just want to protect you.

1060
01:22:49,179 --> 01:22:50,514
I'm coming, Tito!

1061
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:56,228
Gazelle!

1062
01:23:02,234 --> 01:23:03,235
Gazelle!

1063
01:23:04,528 --> 01:23:05,654
Hold me close.

1064
01:23:06,113 --> 01:23:07,405
You know we can't do it.

1065
01:23:07,531 --> 01:23:08,406
Let go.

1066
01:23:49,782 --> 01:23:50,574
I'm sorry, Gazelle.

1067
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:51,449
Let me go.

1068
01:23:51,825 --> 01:23:52,785
Let's go somewhere.

1069
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:54,494
Look what you did to Omar.

1070
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:55,829
Look what you did!

1071
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:58,541
Say you love me.

1072
01:23:58,916 --> 01:23:59,875
Let me go!

1073
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:01,752
Mummy!

1074
01:24:02,169 --> 01:24:03,170
What are you doing?

1075
01:24:03,295 --> 01:24:04,296
I love you Gazelle.

1076
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:06,256
I'll tell mum and dad. Let me go!

1077
01:24:06,882 --> 01:24:08,717
I just want to go, please.

1078
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:10,343
I love you.

1079
01:24:10,468 --> 01:24:11,469
No!

1080
01:24:12,387 --> 01:24:12,888
Gazelle!

1081
01:24:14,264 --> 01:24:15,473
Let go!

1082
01:24:18,644 --> 01:24:19,562
Help!

1083
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:20,688
I'm here, don't scream.

1084
01:24:20,813 --> 01:24:21,814
Help!

1085
01:24:22,189 --> 01:24:23,023
Let go.

1086
01:24:23,524 --> 01:24:24,567
You're a liar.

1087
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,484
I'm not, Gazelle. I love you.

1088
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:27,736
You're vile!

1089
01:24:27,861 --> 01:24:28,946
We'll go where you want.

1090
01:24:29,237 --> 01:24:30,072
Let me be.

1091
01:24:30,197 --> 01:24:31,114
Wanna go to New York?

1092
01:24:31,239 --> 01:24:32,240
Let go.

1093
01:24:33,491 --> 01:24:34,660
Only I can make you happy.

1094
01:24:34,785 --> 01:24:36,537
Everyone's watching.

1095
01:24:36,662 --> 01:24:37,746
Not here!

1096
01:24:39,414 --> 01:24:40,248
Not here!

1097
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:46,314
What's wrong?

1098
01:25:52,988 --> 01:25:54,281
Hold me.

1099
01:25:55,323 --> 01:25:56,449
You're my world.

1100
01:25:59,703 --> 01:26:00,788
Let's go to the room.

1101
01:26:05,543 --> 01:26:06,627
To the room.

1102
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:08,671
The room.

1103
01:26:12,883 --> 01:26:14,009
You're everything to me.

1104
01:26:14,718 --> 01:26:15,511
Everything.

1105
01:27:35,966 --> 01:27:37,009
Please...

1106
01:27:37,134 --> 01:27:38,426
Please!

1107
01:30:04,907 --> 01:30:05,699
Do it!

1108
01:30:08,201 --> 01:30:08,994
Do it!

1109
01:30:10,579 --> 01:30:11,079
Do it!

1110
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:18,211
Life is a collective impossibility

1111
01:32:37,142 --> 01:32:37,976
Look here.

1112
01:32:45,483 --> 01:32:46,359
Lady?

1113
01:32:48,571 --> 01:32:49,404
Lady?

1114
01:32:57,204 --> 01:32:58,288
She's gone.

1115
01:33:35,158 --> 01:33:41,957
Death is an extraordinary experience

1116
01:34:12,029 --> 01:34:13,071
Nothing happened...

1117
01:34:14,447 --> 01:34:15,282
What?

1118
01:34:15,407 --> 01:34:16,324
Nothing happened.

1119
01:34:17,492 --> 01:34:18,451
What do you mean?

1120
01:34:21,955 --> 01:34:22,873
Don't tell dad.

1121
01:34:24,124 --> 01:34:25,083
Don't tell dad.
