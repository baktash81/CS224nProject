1
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:19,316
The results are incredible.

2
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:22,422
We need to protect them though.

3
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:24,821
I suspect someone at our branch.

4
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:25,635
<i>Damn it!</i>

5
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:27,713
We are all in danger.

6
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:33,579
Your friend has already checked in
and paid for the room.

7
00:55:36,347 --> 00:55:39,558
It's room 210. Enjoy your stay!

8
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:48,085
Today, we think about the families

9
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:50,507
of the dead policemen

10
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:54,841
who, in a suspected terrorist attack,

11
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,034
lost their lives.

12
00:56:57,285 --> 00:57:00,021
Our prayers go out to their families...

13
00:57:06,113 --> 00:57:08,278
Good morning.
Is there a message for me?

14
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:09,685
No, nothing I'm afraid.

15
00:58:00,156 --> 00:58:01,278
I would like to buy a phone.

16
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,750
- Which one do you want?
- That one.

17
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:04,498
Also a SIM card.

18
01:09:00,497 --> 01:09:04,896
Get ready, sweetie. We're having
lunch with one of your dad's friends.

19
01:09:46,366 --> 01:09:47,624
Wait for me, please.
