00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:17,682
Sir, you could fall.

176
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:20,848
(MOCKINGLY)
I won't fall.

177
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,852
I'm very coordinated.

178
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:29,524
Trying to re-route
a phone line to get
Internet access.

179
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:31,832
I can get an IT guy in here
to do that for you, sir.

180
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,103
My Lord, you are as dumb as
a bag of hammers, aren't you?

181
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:46,012
Yes, let's bring in
an IT guy,

182
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:49,247
making $35,000 a year,

183
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,421
and give him access
to hard drives

184
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:55,385
that a foreign agent
would pay millions for.

185
00:16:56,096 --> 00:17:00,261
We're supposed to be
protecting the Bureau
from electronic infiltration.

186
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:09,332
So, what kind of
sites do you like?

187
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:13,011
On the Internet.
Are there sites...
Why?

188
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:14,070
I don't know, just...

189
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,448
I've never seen anyone
stand on top of their desk
to get online before.

190
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,350
Do you pray the rosary
every day?

191
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,183
Hmm?

192
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,357
Your file says
you prepped at Gonzaga,
with the Jesuits.

193
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:30,789
That's right. I did.

194
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:35,200
So, do you pray
the rosary every day?

195
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:37,768
Not every day, no.

196
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,672
You should.

197
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:44,169
You still want
my list, sir?

198
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:46,437
The five things?

199
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,878
These are the greatest
pens in the world.

200
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:55,523
I would never write
with anything else.

201
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,091
Sure.

202
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:06,099
I won Boy Scout merit
badges in every category
except riflery.

203
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,203
I haven't been to confession
since high school.

204
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:11,331
There are several words
I constantly misspell.

205
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:13,939
My favorite drink
is a vodka tonic.

206
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,702
And I'm the only male
in the last four
generations of my family

207
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,680
who hasn't served
in the military.

208
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,947
What is your drink then?

209
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:23,775
Gin?

210
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,947
Scotch.

211
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:31,488
It's against Bureau policy
for an agent to consume
alcohol, even off-duty.

212
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:33,760
Did you know that?
Yes, I did.

213
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:37,665
Because an FBI agent
is never off-duty.

214
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:41,865
That comes from
Director Freeh.

215
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:43,937
We attend the same church.

217
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,735
My wife.

218
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:49,707
She likes to know she can
get a hold of me 24l7.

219
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:51,704
Mmm.

220
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,151
She a Catholic girl?

221
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:58,651
No. Sort of a lapsed
Protestant, actually.

222
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:01,348
She's East German.

223
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:03,585
Big fan of Christmas
plays, though.

224
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:17,836
Have to do something
about that, won't we?

Huh?

230

Last I looked, she hadn't
been read into the case.
Can she hear this?

00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:58,507
No.

Agent Burroughs, I don't know
what I'm supposed to be
looking for with this guy.

236

It's not like he's gonna
bring a train of hookers
through the office.

237
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,128
Just get me my pages.

There are a couple of people
like that at work.

They think I'm a

get a copy of...
It was ignored, I'm sure.

Yes, it was.

260
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:38,779
That's because
you don't shoot.

261
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,452
The FBI is a gun culture.

262
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:44,047
You can't advance here
unless you're part of it.

263
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:48,118
Every director in the history
of the Bureau has come from
the law enforcement side.

The guys who shoot,
the guys who make arrests.

265

There's never
been a director
from the Intel side.

So why did you stay?
Huh?

All those years, why didn't
you transfer into something
with a higher profile?

271
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,815
Because I never cared
about making headlines.

272
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:09,814
I wanted to make history.
Sorry.

273
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:15,079
The people Intel tracks
are the ones who want to
wipe America off the map.

a little more to me
than being promoted.

we got a call from Photo,
about a portrait sitting.

You're going up on the

God expects you
to live your faith, Eric,

of women in pantsuits.

You do?

293
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,808
Men wear pants.

The world doesn't need
any more Hillary Clintons.

I wrote a program
last night using nothing
but ones and zeroes

if I could do it.

00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:07,936
Okay, help us.
What do we do?

300
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:18,816
First, we drop ACS,
which is a relic.

301
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:20,877
There's not nearly
enough bandwidth.

302
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:22,717
That's why
you've got agents

303
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,725
who still keep
sensitive information
in cardboard boxes.

304
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:31,055
You need to move
to an ATM system
instead of the WAN.

throughout the building.

Dynamic IP addresses
to hide the system using
the Invicta prototype.

310
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:53,951
Would it be easier
if I sent this in a memo?

311
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:56,991
Yes, it would.
Fine. On your desk
in the morning.

312
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:59,485
You're gonna set up
meetings for me

00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:04,225
with the appropriate
systems managers
at the CIA, DIA, NSA,

314
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,633
and the intel agencies
of each armed service.

315
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:07,864
Yes, sir.

316
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:11,168
They're all
ahead of us on IT.
We have to study them.

317

Would you mind if we
book those appointments
through me, Bob?

318
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:17,177
What for?

319
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,872
Just protocol.

320
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:20,276
Of course.

321
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:23,019
And then we switch
offices, right?

322
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,076
Sure.

323
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:28,420
Perfect.
We're fighting crime
with 19th-century technology,

324
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,483
and he's worried
about protocol.

325
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,961
Set up those meetings.
Leave it up to him,
they'll never happen.

326
00:26:34,031 --> 00:26:35,089
Sir?

327
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:37,463
That was turf protection
you were just watching
in there.

328
00:26:37,535 --> 00:26:40,504
Didn't you spot it?
Organizational arrogance.

329
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:43,233
"No, we don't want to learn
anything from the CIA.

330
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:44,832
"We want the CIA
answering to us."

331
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:49,109
You know what's going on
behind that door?

332
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:50,408
No, sir.

333
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:54,646
Analysts looking
for a spy inside the
intelligence community.

334
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:56,285
Highest clearance.

335
00:26:56,354 --> 00:26:59,551
But there aren't any
CIA officers in there.
You know why?

336
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,821
Because it's a CIA officer
we're trying to build
a case against.

337
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:06,853
Now, could the mole be
someone from the Bureau
and not the CIA?

338
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:07,957
Of course.

339
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:09,796
Are we actively pursuing
that possibility?

340
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:11,028
Of course not.

341
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:13,731
'Cause we're the Bureau,
and the Bureau knows all.

342
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,849
Cooperation is
counter-operational.
And that's the mentality.

343
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:29,219
Of course, the enemies
of this country
aren't so picky.

344
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:32,488
They'll work with anyone
who shares their hatred of us.

345
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,655
Bureau hasn't learned
that lesson yet.

346
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:48,635
He keeps some paintings

347
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,177
I want you to get
one of them for me.

348
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,613
Sir?
It's two men on a boat.
I want it.

349
00:27:55,816 --> 00:27:58,842
What? You mean Agent Garces?
These are his paintings.

350
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,717
Stop thinking
like a clerk.

351
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:02,510
They're sitting
in storage.

352
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,449

BURROUGHS: Okay.
Where was Hanssen
on March 7, 1991?

354
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:14,865
The file has him
making a drop at Ellis
at 6:30 p.m.

355
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:22,774
He badged in at 8:27 a.m.
Badged out at 12:45.

356
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:25,643
Badged back in at 1:45,

357
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:28,306
and badged out again at 5:36.

358
00:28:28,384 --> 00:28:32,047
Okay. Let's take a look
at August 12, 1993.

359
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:41,986
You know why the Soviet
Empire collapsed?

00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,563
I made a career
studying them.

362
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:50,828
They were smarter
than us.

363
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:54,539
More devious,
more determined.

364
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:57,243
So why did they fail?

365
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:02,209
Godlessness.

366
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:04,851
Atheism.

367
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:10,683
I'm on my way
to morning Mass.

368
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,558
You do remember
what Mass is, yes?

369
00:29:13,097 --> 00:29:16,224
The Jesuits at Gonzaga
taught you that much,
didn't they?

370
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,131
Sir, my grandfather
was a deacon.

371
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:23,098
Well, congratulations.

372
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:26,974
Now it's time
to join the varsity.

373
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:35,075
I saw a woman from
Planned Parenthood
on television this morning.

374
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:39,186
A lesbian, naturally.
Defending gay marriage.

375
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,290
I almost ripped the cable
out of the wall.

376
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:46,458
Bet she was
wearing pants, huh?

377
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:56,199
Will your children
be Jesuit-taught,
as you were?

378
00:29:57,442 --> 00:30:01,277
I don't know yet.
That conversation's
still a few years away.

379
00:30:01,814 --> 00:30:02,973
It shouldn't be.

380
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:04,380
Sir, I'm GS-11.

381

We need a second salary
before we can start having...

382
00:30:06,552 --> 00:30:09,077

384
00:30:11,424 --> 00:30:13,915
My wife was the one...
Good to see you, Bob.

385
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:18,824
It was my wife
who first brought me here.

386
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:19,920
Bonnie.

387
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,632
I was a Lutheran when we met,
and not much of one.

388
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:27,463

518
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:32,733
It's bullshit.

519
00:40:32,804 --> 00:40:34,771
The whole thing,
it's Kenneth Starr
all over again,

520
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:38,206
except I'm running around
looking for the blue dress.

521
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:42,808
You've come to
admire him, I see.

522
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:45,109
Yes.

523
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,774
Respect him?

524
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:48,274
Yes.

525
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:51,783
Well, that was
inevitable.

526
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:55,216
For our purposes,
it was sort of necessary.

527
00:40:57,263 --> 00:40:58,753
But he's a traitor, Eric.

528
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:03,866
He started spying
for the Russians,
we think, in 1985.

529
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:11,069
He's given them
military secrets,
intelligence secrets.

530
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:14,444
He gave them our
Continuity of Government
Program,

531
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,243
which told them
where the President
would be taken

532
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:18,408
during a nuclear
or terrorist attack.

533
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:22,513
And the Vice President.
And the Congress.
And the Cabinet.

534
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:27,322
The damage he's done
to the U.S. Government
is in the billions.

535
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:29,363
But that's just
the money part.

536
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:31,488
He's also
given up lives.

is also true.

551
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:25,850
Irrelevant, but true.

552
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:28,517

they're about his wife.

555

He's a big fan
of strippers, too.
Has been for years.

556
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:47,069
But his grandchildren
do love him.

557
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:50,270
That part I can't argue.

558
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:54,073
There's no such thing as
the "Information Assurance

559
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,345
No.

560
00:42:55,953 --> 00:42:58,421
We created that

from State.

566
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:19,207
Unusual steps
were required.

stopped at his dry cleaners,

574

any leave time coming?

576

00:44:01,788 --> 00:44:03,050

579
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:06,023
Director's running the case.
He sees your pages every day.

580
00:44:06,093 --> 00:44:07,151
No.

581
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:08,216
Yes.

582
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:10,721
Keep them coming,
by the way.

583
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:14,028
Our audio's missing about 90%
of what Hanssen says in there.

584
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:15,433
He mumbles.

585
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,960
He does a lot of things,
this guy.

586
00:44:18,705 --> 00:44:22,368
Why don't we just
arrest him?
Can't do that.

587
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:25,776
He knows the names
and locations of every source
we've ever turned.

588
00:44:26,214 --> 00:44:28,944
If we can't get him to talk,
their lives are all at risk.

Dean Plesac.

in charge.
Sir.

591
00:44:34,222 --> 00:44:36,883
Director wants him
caught in the act
of making a drop.

592
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,820
That would give you
the death penalty.

593
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,554
Don't you think
he's earned it?

594
00:44:40,628 --> 00:44:43,529
See you, Dean.
Thanks for coming in, Rich.

595
00:44:44,465 --> 00:44:46,627

take nothing personally.

597
00:44:52,074 --> 00:44:54,804
He's got an appointment
at the DIA tomorrow
at 2:00, right?

598
00:44:54,877 --> 00:44:56,537
Yeah.
You're driving him?

599
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,006
Yeah.
Good.

600
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,379
We need him out of the office
for at least three hours.

00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,781
That's when we'll be
sweeping his car.
Okay.

00:45:03,152 --> 00:45:06,611
How long will it take you
to download the data card
off his Palm Pilot?

603
00:45:06,689 --> 00:45:09,681
Twenty, 30 minutes,
depending on the level
of encryption.

604
00:45:10,126 --> 00:45:12,616
But you can't.
He never lets it
out of his sight.

605
00:45:14,632 --> 00:45:17,622
Assuming we can separate him
from it, 20 to 30 minutes.

606
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,962
Okay.

607
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:27,970
What's this?

608
00:45:28,177 --> 00:45:29,771
You want to be
read in, right?

609
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:34,814
Wait.

610
00:45:36,053 --> 00:45:38,044
What if he's smarter
than I am?

611
00:45:41,624 --> 00:45:44,458
I've never misread anybody
this badly before.

612
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:48,228
Except maybe you.

613
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,132
A couple of years ago,

614
00:45:55,372 --> 00:45:58,467
the Bureau put together
a task force.

615
00:46:01,312 --> 00:46:03,440
Lots of assets
had been disappearing.

616
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:08,648
Sources like Motorin,
Martynov. Dozens of them,
vanishing.

617
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,555
So this task force was
formed to find the mole
who was giving them up.

618
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:17,559
Our best analysts poring
over data for years
looking for the guy,

619
00:46:17,629 --> 00:46:20,622
and they could never
quite find him.

620
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,234
Guess who we put in charge
of the task force?

621
00:46:31,676 --> 00:46:33,507
He was smarter
than all of us.

622
00:46:37,517 --> 00:46:40,042
Actually,
I can live with that part.

623
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:44,115
It's the idea
that my entire career
has been a waste of time,

624
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,624
that's the part I hate.

625
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:48,487
Everything I've done
since I got to this office,

626
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:51,792
everything we've
all been paid to do,
he was undoing it.

627
00:46:52,466 --> 00:46:54,457

stayed home.

can't eat Chinese
every night, Eric.

it would be okay, Eric.

bumping her head?

Maybe you want me
to be someone else, too.

704

Maybe you want me to be
Bonnie or something.

705

No, that'd be easier
for you, wouldn't it?

every day and wanted to spend
my life being pregnant...

Your parents would
probably love that.

711
00:51:52,044 --> 00:51:54,103
Enough.
Then you wouldn't have
to worry anymore

712

you been out here?

quit anything?
Yeah.

your father say?

00:53:08,824 --> 00:53:11,258
Nothing.
He just shrugged.

That's what he said to me
the first time I shipped out.

He knew I was scared,
so he just kept it simple.

Maybe I should have
gone to Annapolis.

1197
01:29:14,488 --> 01:29:16,979
She's trying to reach me
because I told her
I'd be home by now,

1198
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,422
and because we're
in another fight,

1199

caused by you,
as usual.

1200
01:29:22,228 --> 01:29:25,197

unannounced and lecturing her
about Opus Dei.

1201
01:29:25,264 --> 01:29:26,561
That was real helpful.

1202

Oh, and thanks for staring
at her in church

1203

1206

she asked me this morning
why you're like this.
