1
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,933
Shh!

2
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,830
Look, I don't wanna take up
a ton of your time...

3
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,733
But I'm gonna kill myself.

4
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,239
I just thought that someone should know.
I don't know how this works.

5
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:23,942
I'm probably gonna jump off an
overpass in front of a semi, so...

6
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,112
Or a u-haul. Not a bus. I'm not gonna
be a dick and make people watch.

7
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,616
But it has to be big. It's
gotta be so big that it just...

8
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,684
Done. Kills me. Lights out.

9
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:36,188
'Cause if it just maims me and I'm
like... well, how's that good for anyone?

10
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,292
Then I gotta find a nurse to smother me. How
am I gonna get across "smothering" if I'm...

11
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:44,196
We don't need to get caught up in the minutia. I
just thought that an adult... you should know.

12
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:52,838
Wow. This is, uh,
a lot to take in, Nadine.

13
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,707
I... I wish I knew
what to say.

14
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,513
Well, I was actually just drafting
my own suicide note just now.

15
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,182
"Dear everybody."

16
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,517
As some of you know,

17
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,123
I have 32 fleeting minutes of happiness
per school day during lunch,

18
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,493
which has been eaten up
again and again

19
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,995
by the same...

20
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,898
Especially
badly dressed student,

21
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,135
and I finally thought,
you know what?

22
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:28,707
I would rather have
the dark, empty nothingness.

23
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,412
I really would.
It sounds... relaxing.

24
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,082
"Have a nice life
without me, fuckers."

25
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,551
You are so gonna get fired
when I actually do it.

26
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,787
Well, not for sure,
but I can dream.

27
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,726
<i>Let me start from the beginning.</i>

28
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,929
<i>Around second grade
I had a realization.</i>

29
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,900
<i>There are two types
of people in this world.</i>

30
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,103
<i>The people who radiate confidence
and naturally excel at life...</i>

31
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,205
Yes! Yes!

32
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,442
<i>And the people who hope all those
people die in a big explosion.</i>

33
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,245
All right,
knock 'em dead, kiddo.

34
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,948
<i>My brother Darian was a winner from
day one and had about a million fans.</i>

35
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,216
Bye.

36
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,785
<i>His biggest one... my mother.</i>

37
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,356
- Bye, sweetheart.

38
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,258
Oh, check it out.

39
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,127
Okay, boss lady,
see you tonight.

40
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,771
Nadine, we're not
doing this again.

41
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,173
You promised.
Now get out of the car.

42
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,811
Well, that's it.

43
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,759
<i>You could say my mother and I
weren't exactly peas in a pod.</i>

44
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:57,062
Oh. No.

45
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:00,365
<i>And the only one who could
handle either of us... was dad.</i>

46
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey. <i>Dad had
a nearly impossible task...</i>

47
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,542
<i>Having to manage us both.</i>

48
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,316
All right now,

49
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,685
I know kids can be mean.

50
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,925
But if you get a chance,
fart into their backpacks.

51
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,831
I wish you were small.

52
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,536
<i>Then I'd at least have
one person to have lunch with.</i>

53
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,174
<i>Instead, the most attention I got
at school was from these three.</i>

54
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:48,313
Nobody likes you. You suck
and you're gonna get aids.

55
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,185
Over here! Run!

56
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,788
<i>My childhood had become
a raging dumpster fire,</i>

57
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,792
<i>and I couldn't take one more second of this
intolerable, unlivable nightmare of a...</i>

58
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,860
Excuse me.

59
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,632
<i>And then, out of the clear blue,
an angel appeared.</i>

60
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:08,894
Can you move, please?

61
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,605
<i>She was dressed like
a small, elderly gentleman.</i>

62
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,309
<i>And her breath smelled
of sweetarts.</i>

63
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,913
You want to hold him?

64
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,317
But don't squash him.

65
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,393
Hi, guy.

66
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,295
If you want, you can be
his other mom with me.

67
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,931
Really?

68
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,936
I gonna be your other mom
and take such good care of you.

69
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,140
<i>I accidentally suffocated him two
hours later in my pencil box.</i>

70
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,479
<i>But I had finally made
my first friend.</i>

71
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,551
<i>We told each other things we
never thought we'd say out loud.</i>

72
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:03,622
Once, my grandpa's pajama flap
accidentally came open

73
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,625
and I saw his wiener
and got real sad.

74
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:11,196
My mom has to take medicine or she'll
get upset and buy too much at the mall.

75
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,898
It's true.

76
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:22,441
<i>It turned out krista's life
wasn't perfect either.</i>

77
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,911
I'm walking away, okay? What am I, your
mother? Am I supposed to babysit...

78
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,313
<i>But we got each other through.</i>

79
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,981
Play with this.

80
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,651
We could play with
Mrs. penguin. Hee hee.

81
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,886
<i>For the next few years,</i>

82
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:41,159
<i>and then, some extremely
fucked-up shit happened.</i>

83
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,830
Oh, my god.

84
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,398
I knew it.

85
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,137
It's really just the hair.

86
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,006
It's not that bad.
You can just grow it out.

87
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,808
Are you even up there?

88
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,978
Hey, move.
I got to pee.

89
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,848
<i>Darian, meanwhile,
just got better-looking,</i>

90
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,883
<i>and that asshole knew it.</i>

91
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,987
<i>That night I picked up
some cheeseburgers with my dad.</i>

92
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,990
What do I have that's any good? Tell me.
What have I ever had?

93
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,993
You have a lot. You have love.
You have my love.

94
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,095
Very soon you're gonna
have cheeseburgers.

95
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,363
Oh, look.

96
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,467
Did I not tell you?
Cheeseburgers.

97
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,703
Mmm!

98
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,939
- Do you want a fry?
- Oh, yeah.

99
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,678
Oh, hey.
That was Billy Joel.

100
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,548
You don't turn past Billy Joel.

101
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,539
Dad?

102
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,907
I...

103
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,675
- dad, are you okay?

104
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,210
Dad!

105
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,212
Dad!

106
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,130
<i>I'm not gonna depress you
with the details.</i>

107
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:03,234
<i>So... let's just say the next
few years were complete shit.</i>

108
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,140
Oh, god.

109
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,278
<i>Well, except for one part.</i>

110
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,046
<i>I had krista.</i>

111
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,815
<i>This was last Friday.</i>

112
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,583
<i>Look at me.
I was in a good mood.</i>

113
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,986
- I love spoilers.
- No.

114
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,488
Yes, I do. That means
i don't have to watch it.

115
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,057
Then I can just know
and move on with my life.

116
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,126
I'll give you a hint.

117
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,697
I knew it. I knew it.
They get married, yes.

118
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,137
Ohh.

119
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,306
God, juvie made him so hot.

120
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,942
Oh, god. I forgot to
tell you something.

121
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,377
He works at petland now.

122
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,749
I should go in there
and be like,

123
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,585
"excuse me, where are the beta fish? Also,
could you put your penis inside me?"

124
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,687
Oh!
Not you.

125
00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:00,692
God. What if you actually did that? What
if you lost your virginity in a petland?

126
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,661
I think it'd be kind of nice.

127
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,223
All the little tropical fish watching.
It'd be kind of spiritual.

128
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,542
Oh, my god. Would you please look at
that stupid shirt my brother's wearing?

129
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,711
Oh, you can see his nipples.

130
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,681
How does he not realize
that all that does is scream,

131
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,683
"i have a body complex
worse than a girl."

132
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,651
How much does he
even work out now?

133
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,220
It's ocd.

134
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,857
You should have seen him. He had a conniption
'cause my mom won't by him creatine anymore

135
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,527
since it fucks up your kidneys.

136
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,495
I was like,
"i know, Darian. I know.

137
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,398
What does mom expect, you to win
people over with your personality?"

138
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,179
Hey, so, uh,
just a heads-up,

139
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,582
but yesterday when you were giving
your lecture, you were like,

140
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,585
"oh, blah, blah, blah and then the
north seceded from the union."

141
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:04,856
You meant to say the south seceded. You
accidentally said the exact opposite.

142
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:08,326
I didn't want to raise my hand and be all,
"excuse me, these kids are pretty confusable."

143
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,994
Just thought maybe
you'd want to know.

144
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,996
Oh.

145
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,932
Hey.

146
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,570
- Great catch.
- Yeah.

147
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:23,074
Now, I know that it was a long lecture
and you probably don't recall,

148
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:27,011
but, uh, was there any point during
it when you thought to yourself,

149
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:33,017
"gosh, I wonder what it's like
to actually have a life?"

150
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,056
No.

151
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,259
No, I was too concentrated on how
you were effing the whole thing up.

152
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,430
Well, I understand that. But just know
that I haven't given up hope. Not yet.

153
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,831
Okay.

154
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,804
Hey.

155
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,039
Hey.

156
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,876
I like your sweatshirt today.

157
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,044
It's nice.
Thank you.

158
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,716
Where'd you get it?

159
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,786
The little sweater...
The-the sweatshirt.

160
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:13,858
I... i... I don't know.
I don't... I don't remember.

161
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,328
Coolio.

162
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,732
Yep.
Yeah.

163
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,500
I don't know where
that came from, but...

164
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,969
- What's his name?
- Erwin Kim.

165
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:29,140
I don't know him. You'd freaking love him.
He's adorable.

166
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,575
So are you gonna
hook up with him?

167
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:33,011
No, not like that.
Like pathetic adorable.

168
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,580
Like I wanna carry him around
in a babybjörn.

169
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:43,121
Oh! Oh, good, good, good, good.
I caught you. I'm so glad.

170
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,657
Oh! Do you like this dress?

171
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,760
Does it look bad? I think
it looks kind of bad.

172
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,595
It's kind of poofy and...

173
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,064
I don't know.
Do my arms look bad?

174
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,201
No.

175
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:59,003
Yeah, you don't sound very believable,
and you're making me nervous, Nadine.

176
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,972
Your upper arms
are breathtaking.

177
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:04,342
- Where are you going?
- Well, it's last minute,

178
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,679
but Brent called me,
the-the dentist one,

179
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,481
and he asked if I wanted to go
to manzanita for the weekend,

180
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,317
and I thought, you know what?

181
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,153
I deserve to be a little
selfish once in a while, so...

182
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,723
Is that one of the, um, match.
Com guys? Yeah.

183
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,059
You should go for
as long as you want.

184
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,128
Very funny.
I'm gonna be back on Sunday.

185
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,464
Okay.

186
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,568
Just in time to surprise you. I tried to call
Darian, but he must be in his ap study group.

187
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,570
Uh, I can...
I'll tell him.

188
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,138
Be good.

189
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,711
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,845
What?

191
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,247
Dibs.
<i>Huh?</i>

192
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,582
- Dibs, dibs, dibs.
- What are you even saying?

193
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,685
Mom's fucking a dentist in manzanita for
two days, so I called dibs on the house.

194
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,320
Ew.
<i>Bye.</i>

195
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,689
You are so sick for
saying it like that.

196
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,893
Mom's boobs are jangling around a
dentist's face. See it, Darian.

197
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,896
See mom's titties all up
in that dentist's face.

198
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,025
He'll love that you have all
of your teeth in your mouth.

199
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,294
- Ooh, that should work.
- Yeah!

200
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,231
No way.

201
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,536
Where are you going?

202
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,438
Darian!

203
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,142
Yeah! Come on!
Darian!

204
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,950
You need to get all these
people out of the pool.

205
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,954
Excuse me. All of you
need to leave! Bye-bye!

206
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,889
Hey, no one's listening to you.

207
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:02,093
You said you weren't gonna drink until
after soccer. You failed, failure!

208
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:05,163
Dude, I'm not drinking. It's orange
juice, genius. How drunk is she?

209
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:10,468
I've had one drink, okay? Now you
get your friends out of the pool.

210
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,669
Uh, no.

211
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,604
Okay, then I'm
gonna call the cops.

212
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,441
Okay. Yep, you're cut off.
We're going upstairs.

213
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,609
Excuse me. I'm calling the cops.
Hey, you're retarded.

214
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:22,313
No, let's... beep, beep. Beep. Beep.
Beep. Beep, beep, beep.

215
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,349
I'm still dialing.
Hello. Operator?

216
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,919
Yeah, um, can you
please help me?

217
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,823
My brother is hurting me
in my no no hole.

218
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,896
Oh!

219
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,367
Why am I so grotesque?

220
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:47,138
- Shh. -How do you even like me?
What's wrong with you?

221
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,639
Stop.

222
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,274
I don't even like me.

223
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,346
I heard my voice on a voice mail
yesterday, and it was like,

224
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,782
"how can anyone stand
listening to you?"

225
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,318
Oh, you're just drunk
right now, okay?

226
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,821
I hate the way I look when
I talk or when I chew gum.

227
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,024
Don't ever
let me chew gum, okay?

228
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,393
Don't let me chew gum.

229
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,098
And then, I had
the worst thought.

230
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,039
I got to spend the rest
of my life with myself.

231
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,573
Shh.

232
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,549
Let's go to your room. Don't you want to
wake up in your bed tomorrow morning?

233
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,584
Hmm?
Don't you want to do that?

234
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,787
You don't want to sleep here.
Come on, Nadine.

235
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,240
Hey, is there any more
aspirin anywhere?

236
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,609
Maybe. Try... try that
thing over there.

237
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,333
- Hey, no, you don't have to. -Oh, it's...
it's cool. It'll just go faster, so...

238
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,203
All right.

239
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,704
So, what happened?

240
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:31,309
Uh, somebody let Baxter in
and he pissed.

241
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,517
Do me another quick favor? Can
you grab me those paper towels?

242
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,588
Cool. And just clean up
all this dog urine.

243
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,822
Yeah, right.

244
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:33,037
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
What the fuck?

245
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,574
Hey, just get out... get out of my room!
Stop looking, man! Just get out!

246
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,123
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't...

247
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,525
I swear I don't even
know what happened.

248
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,295
I don't even know
how it happened.

249
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:02,400
It was... I don't know. I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

250
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,439
Are you okay?

251
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,581
I'm just...
Just thinking.

252
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,186
Okay, I'll see you later.

253
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:25,756
Nadine, you can't just leave
without saying anything. Nadine.

254
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:29,060
You're my best friend and I love you.
It wasn't your fault.

255
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,833
You disgust me.

256
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,235
That's nice.

257
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,404
Go grow yourself a wispy
mustache, you pervert,

258
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,573
and stay away
from my friends, okay?

259
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,942
Did you just say
"friends" plural?

260
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,582
Your head is
too big for your body.

261
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,984
It makes you look ridiculous.
You'll never be able to fix it.

262
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,210
Mr. bruner.

263
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,883
I didn't have a chance to do the
homework last night because...

264
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:29,153
Well, I don't know if you know
this, but my dad passed away.

265
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,891
It's just been really hard
to do anything.

266
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,130
Date of passing?

267
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,298
Sorry?

268
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,566
When, uh...
When did he die?

269
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,969
Um, 2011.

270
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,338
Ooh.

271
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,476
Mm. Yeah, I have a one-year expiration
date on freebies for the dead and dying.

272
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,680
Are you serious? There will
be other opportunities.

273
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:59,250
Your grandparents can't
stick around forever.

274
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,119
Have a seat.

275
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:05,556
Okay, class,
<i>the young Mr. Lincoln.</i>

276
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,592
Uh-huh.

277
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,697
Enjoy.

278
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,176
How was your weekend?

279
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,280
Mm.

280
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,719
It was... below average.

281
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,722
Yeah.

282
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,757
Okay.

283
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,993
How was your weekend?

284
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:46,197
Oh, I, uh... I golfed.

285
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,067
Well, like mini.
Like mini... mini golf.

286
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,169
Like...
I don't why I did that.

287
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:55,039
I'll pick that up.
Um, but yeah.

288
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,041
- Tim's fun park?
- Yeah.

289
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,409
I love that place.

290
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,479
We should go sometime.

291
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:04,515
Yeah, we should. But with
like... like a group of people.

292
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:08,052
Like... like with
like several... people.

293
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,088
That's right... no, it's...
Or just... just us.

294
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,758
Like just-just-just us?
Uh, yeah. You know.

295
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,493
Oh, yeah. Or a group.

296
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,328
Yeah.
Yeah, a group.

297
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,564
I think that'd be... i think that'd
be great. It'd be so much more fun.

298
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,032
Yeah.

299
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,174
Hey, I'm-I'm gonna catch up with you guys.
All right, man.

300
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,242
See you later.

301
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,280
Hey.
Hi.

302
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,452
Look, i-i just...
I want to say that, um,

303
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:44,855
you're my sister's friend, and what
happened the other night, you know...

304
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,290
Yes. Thank you.
It was so weird.

305
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,758
Yeah, it was just...

306
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,894
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

307
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,162
It was all me.
It was...

308
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,631
Uh, ooh...
It's, uh...

309
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,035
Anyways...
Yeah.

310
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,038
Cool. I'll see you...

311
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,073
At the house or...
Around. Around.

312
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,809
Cool.

313
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,310
Hey, um...

314
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,613
I had a really good time
with you.

315
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,582
Me too.

316
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

317
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,495
I'm sorry.

318
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,837
I'm sorry.

319
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,310
It's cool.

320
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,616
Continue.

321
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,485
Okay, that was...
That was weird.

322
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,020
That was, uh... that was
a weird thing to do.

323
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,024
Um...
Ahh.

324
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,198
What do you want me
to do, Nadine?

325
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,535
I want you to think about
how shitty this is for me.

326
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,172
I know.

327
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,341
What if I did this to you?

328
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,678
What if...

329
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,549
What if...
What if I liked your dad?

330
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,653
What if I gave
your dad a hand job?

331
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,390
Oh, Louis, wow, you look so hot
with that belt-phone of yours.

332
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,459
Wow. Oh, krista, you're home early.
Okay.

333
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,964
Why... mmm. Why? Why?
Why do you even like him?

334
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,366
I don't know.

335
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,968
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

336
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,505
Is it a girl thing. You hooked up with
him so now you're emotionally attached?

337
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,241
- No. -Are you unconsciously
mad at me, maybe,

338
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,076
and this like
some kind of revenge?

339
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,878
Nadine... are you unconsciously
mad at yourself

340
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,747
and this is some
kind of self-punishment.

341
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,750
'Cause if that's what it is...
will you... will you stop talking?

342
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,085
Because you're
driving me insane.

343
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,589
Please.

344
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,927
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

345
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,410
He invited me
to a party on Friday,

346
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,313
and I want you to come with us.

347
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,789
Like, you're gonna go with him and
I'm gonna tag along. Yes. Will you?

348
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,129
I'm gonna have to see
if I'm around.

349
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,230
Yeah.

350
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,498
Okay.

351
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,761
Thank you for coming. What? No, no.
I'm having a great time.

352
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:14,298
Oh, hey. Look, maybe you guys
can fuck on the lawn later.

353
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,066
Please rise above
yourself, Nadine.

354
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,901
Please suck
several dicks, Darian.

355
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,356
Here's a Miller.

356
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,893
Oh, hey, I want you
to meet some people.

357
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,699
What's up? This is krista. Hi.

358
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,602
Hi. I'm Shannon. You were in my
chem class last year, right?

359
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:54,471
Yes, yes. Um, nice
to officially meet you.

360
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,874
Oh, my god. I love your outfit.
It's so cute.

361
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,642
Thank you very much.

362
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,477
I love your laces.
Thank you.

363
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,447
Hey, do you wanna play,
uh, beer pong?

364
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:06,216
Yes, I would love
to play beer pong.

365
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:09,319
I really don't know
a lot of people here, but...

366
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,990
Like, you'll meet people.
It'll be a great icebreaker.

367
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,825
Okay?
Hi.

368
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,326
I think I'm gonna go play
beer pong with them.

369
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,495
Okay, come on.

370
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:20,497
Yeah, new player!

371
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:24,234
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.

372
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,236
Drink, drink, drink, drink. Oh!

373
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,207
All right,
just don't be so weird.

374
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,242
God, why are you so awkward?

375
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,180
God, just have a good time.
Just relax.

376
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:40,084
Just relax. Have a good time.
Go talk to people.

377
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:42,853
Okay? All right, great.
Yeah, perfect. I'll do that.

378
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,112
That's two cups!

379
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,247
You made it! Oh, it's in!
That's two cups!

380
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,321
It's cool to sit here?

381
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,456
Yeah.

382
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,699
You-you having fun?

383
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:32,703
- Feelin' pretty good.
- I respect that.

384
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:37,941
Hey, aren't you
Darian Franklin's sister?

385
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,476
Yep.

386
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,812
Do you watch tbs ever?

387
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,481
Sometimes.

388
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,984
There's this old movie
that always playing on there.

389
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:51,221
It's got Arnold Schwarzenegger and the
little bald guy from<i> it's always sunny?</i>

390
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:55,425
Yeah, they played twin brothers,
only Arnold's all tall and buff.

391
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,461
And the other guy's like
little and funny-looking?

392
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,596
- Yes.
- God. Um,<i> twins.</i>

393
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,298
- Yes.
- I love that movie.

394
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,566
It's so good.
Love that movie.

395
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,735
You and your brother
kind of remind me of that.

396
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,578
<i>Hi.
</i> I need you to come pick me up.

397
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,528
How was it?

398
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,430
Uh, it was...

399
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,934
Probably one of
the worst nights of my life.

400
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,869
You wouldn't believe
the night I had. Oh!

401
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,005
I'm sorry.
I look like hell.

402
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,277
What happened?

403
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,781
Oh. So the dentist?

404
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:56,720
I was home tonight having
a relaxing glass of wine,

405
00:30:56,722 --> 00:31:01,792
and I got an e-mail...
From his wife.

406
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,797
I was about to call Dr. hill
hysterical, but then I thought,

407
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,832
"no, Mona,"

408
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:12,135
you're gonna
do this on your own.

409
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:15,537
"You've done everything on your own since
2011. You're gonna do this on your own too."

410
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,010
God, I feel like such a loser.

411
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,678
You're not a loser.

412
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,815
- I feel like one.
- You're not a loser, mom.

413
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:28,886
You're-you're attractive.
You're good at decorating.

414
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,221
You're very diligent
with your eyebrows.

415
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,357
Even if it did work out.

416
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,060
"Hey, did you floss today? Gum
disease is a silent killer, Mona."

417
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,734
Oh.

418
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,705
You know what I'm
gonna to do tonight?

419
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,774
What?
I want to go home,

420
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,443
fix my hair,

421
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,847
put on a beautiful face of makeup
and the best dress I own...

422
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,085
Then take it all off
and go to sleep.

423
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,456
Fun.

424
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,788
Hey, Nick, I sent you
a friend request a while ago.

425
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,257
Maybe you just skipped over it

426
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:43,460
or sometimes there's a glitch and
Facebook doesn't send the e-mail,

427
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,197
so I just thought that I'd...

428
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,833
I'd, uh...

429
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,036
Inform you.

430
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,175
Oh, my god.

431
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,479
You are truly pathetic.

432
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,928
Hello?

433
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,430
<i>Hey, uh, it's Nadine
from history.</i>

434
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,332
<i>Um, what are you... what
are you doing right now?</i>

435
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,268
Oh, uh, hi. I'm, uh...

436
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,637
<i>Hi.</i>
I'm just, uh... hey.

437
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,639
<i>Hi.</i>
Hey, you all right?

438
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,441
<i>Yeah.</i> 'Cause I'm good.
I mean, you good?

439
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,010
You all right? Cool. <i>Great.</i>

440
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,478
You all right? What's up? <i>Yeah.</i>

441
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,947
Sorry. I keep talk...
That's true. I don't...

442
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:39,383
H-how are you? Are you good.
Are you all right?

443
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:42,619
<i>Tim's theme park's open late tonight.
You want to meet there?</i>

444
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,388
Whoo!

445
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,025
So how come they
canceled the party?

446
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:51,328
Oh, uh, by "canceled"
i more meant I left.

447
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,530
Ah. Gotcha.

448
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,465
Thanks for driving, by the way.

449
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,835
I don't have a license 'cause I'm like,
"why not just have people drive you?"

450
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:01,972
People make such a big deal about being
able to do things for themselves.

451
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,643
That was a joke. I failed the test.
Oh. Oh! Ha, ha.

452
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:09,813
Hello.

453
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,481
Uh, you can get that.

454
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,250
Uh, no, it's cool.

455
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,788
Um, hey, look, there's no
line at the Ferris wheel. Oh.

456
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,935
So, tell me something i don't
know about you, erwin.

457
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,571
- I, uh... -what are
your hopes and dreams?

458
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,107
Take me on a tour of your psyche.
I don't know.

459
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:41,745
I guess I'm just your average
guy, I guess. Right.

460
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:46,183
But if you had to expand for the two
minutes that we're on the ride.

461
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,418
- Right. Um...
- What are your parents like?

462
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,021
- Oh, well, my... -wait, wait.
Let's see if I can guess.

463
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,756
I want to see if I'm psychic.
Sure. Okay.

464
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,625
Your mom gets on you about your grades
and practicing your instrument.

465
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,728
She makes a great egg sandwich after years
of owning a small restaurant downtown.

466
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,732
Your dad... quiet, gruff,
never really says "i love you."

467
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:06,503
Um, but with his stoic presence,
you-you... i mean, you know he cares.

468
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,908
I'm really hoping none of that was racist,
but now I'm thinking all of it was.

469
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,311
No. No, not racist at all.
No, you're good.

470
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,479
Yeah.

471
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,417
- Whoa! What are you... oh, my god!
- I'm sorry.

472
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:22,119
Was that...
Was that bad timing?

473
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,988
I thought it was good timing.
You're on a Ferris wheel and upset.

474
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,491
Just trying to comfort you. That was weird?
We should probably get off.

475
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,493
We should get off.
Yeah. That was...

476
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,928
Hey, excuse me. Can we be let off?
Erwin. Erwin.

477
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,931
Can we please... can we
stop the fucking ride?

478
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,067
Can we just stop it?

479
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:45,175
I'm sorry for... I didn't mean to
raise my voice. Oh, my god, erwin.

480
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,679
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

481
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,982
Oh! What?
Okay.

482
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,585
You got it. That was all... that was
all you. We got it. We got it.

483
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,354
Holy crap.

484
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,456
Nobody saw that.
We're good.

485
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,057
We're out of here.

486
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,629
This has been
a really fun night.

487
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,999
I'm sorry if I flipped out on you on
the Ferris wheel earlier. Oh, no.

488
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,968
My... my timing was just bizarre.

489
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,705
I'm goin' through a lot of shit right now.
It's a long story.

490
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,374
I'm sorry you're
going through stuff.

491
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,178
You're a really
great guy, erwin.

492
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,281
Ah.
No, I'm serious.

493
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,683
I look at you and
just see this really,

494
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,218
really...

495
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,054
Really old man.

496
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,824
- Old?
- I'm complimenting you.

497
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:40,197
I just... I see this very kind,
very gentle, very wise old man

498
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:43,200
in a convalescent home,

499
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,135
in a wheelchair.

500
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:47,370
Mm.
Hmm.

501
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,440
Thank you.

502
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,426
Hi.

503
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,095
Hi.

504
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:22,739
I... I know you're mad at me because you think
that I ditched you to play beer pong, and...

505
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,975
I never...
I never said I was mad.

506
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,280
Okay.
Well, I know that you are,

507
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:32,916
and... Nadine.

508
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:36,519
Would you like to know an observation
that I made this weekend?

509
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,089
Sure.

510
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:43,293
"- Oh, my god, Shannon, your outfit,
it's so cute! - I love it."

511
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,297
Yeah. Okay.

512
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:50,967
And you toss me aside? The person who's
had your back since second grade,

513
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,602
who's been with you
through everything?

514
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,039
You know what? Fine, because
chances are that those pricks,

515
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,441
they're not gonna give a shit about you when
Darian drops your ass for someone hotter.

516
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,648
You don't know anything, Nadine.

517
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:09,286
It's really shitty to hear.
I'm sorry, it's gonna happen.

518
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:11,154
No, I'm sorry.
It's not gonna happen,

519
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:14,658
because your brother just asked me to
be his girlfriend and to prom in may.

520
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,366
No. Yeah, he did. He-he
just asked me that.

521
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:30,173
You can't. Y-you can't have both.
It's me or him. Pick.

522
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,610
No, I'm...
No, I'm not gonna pick.

523
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:36,513
It's me or him. Do you want him
or do you want me? Nadine.

524
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,181
Why can't you just say me?
No, i...

525
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,183
Him or me now?
No, I'm not gonna pick.

526
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,851
You know what?
Then we're done.

527
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,821
We're done.

528
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,727
Fine.

529
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,204
Oh, my god.

530
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,398
Nadine.

531
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,634
Nadine.
Hmm? Hmm?

532
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,236
Hey, wake up.

533
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,672
You had a brain operation.
It worked.

534
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,741
They made you pleasant
and agreeable.

535
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,612
Ah, just wishful daydreaming.

536
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,683
The bell rang.
Leave. Please.

537
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:51,388
Mm-hmm. Yeah. You know what? Just ignore
her. She's... I'll call you later.

538
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,089
Bye.

539
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,966
I don't want to hear about it.
Work it out between yourselves.

540
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,927
In a couple weeks,
dad will be dead four years.

541
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,300
When I was on my way home today,
this memory came back to me.

542
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,508
It was that night...

543
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,012
After everything happened.

544
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:58,154
I got up to go to the bathroom
and I saw you... crying so hard.

545
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,827
I mean, so hard
your pillow was just soaked.

546
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,032
It made me so sad.

547
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:16,272
I got up and I went in my room
and I got my... my pillow.

548
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,408
Took the wet one for myself.

549
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,649
I wish you loved me that much.

550
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,187
Asshole.

551
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,025
No. No.

552
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:39,996
Hey, you're so messed up for bringing
up that story. You're so messed up!

553
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,699
Do you even realize how sick in the
head you are for bringing that up?

554
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:45,869
I'm sorry you feel guilty for never
caring about anyone but yourself.

555
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:49,439
- Yeah. No, that's exactly it. -Face it.
You're obsessed with yourself.

556
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:52,609
- Oh, my god. -Your report card on
the refrigerator like you're five!

557
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:56,179
"Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody, look.
I pooped in the big potty!"

558
00:41:56,181 --> 00:42:00,483
God. Do you even know what it feels
like to love another human being?

559
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:03,052
Oh, man. You are so dramatic.

560
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:06,689
Okay? Hey, life isn't fair sometimes,
Nadine, okay? Get over it!

561
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,792
I swear to god. I swear to
god I'm gonna clock you!

562
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,161
- Hey!
- Calm down already, man!

563
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,696
- Everybody knows that!
- Stop it!

564
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,668
What is the matter with you? I...

565
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,004
I know what this is about.
No, you don't.

566
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:24,274
Yes, I do. Krista and
Darian are a thing.

567
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,645
You guys think I don't know
things, but I know things.

568
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:31,681
- I'm leaving. -No, you're not.
Where are you going?

569
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:34,751
- I'm taking a therapeutic walk.
- Get back here!

570
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,321
Oh, god. Darian.

571
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:40,356
Just don't worry about it.

572
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:43,126
Can I just ask you a question?

573
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,597
Is it worth turning the
house into a war zone?

574
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,432
What am I supposed
to say to that?

575
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,836
I'm just... I'm just
asking you the question.

576
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,908
I'm not turning it into a war zone, mom.
She is. Why don't you talk to her?

577
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,643
Because she doesn't
listen to me. You do.

578
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,615
You'll do the right thing.
I know you will.

579
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,786
I mean, look at that
drink you're making.

580
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,889
You want one?

581
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:18,194
Oh. What did I do to make
such a perfect kid, huh?

582
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:50,219
Could you point me in the
direction of the cat litter?

583
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,622
Uh...

584
00:44:52,624 --> 00:44:54,557
Eight, I think.

585
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,729
You go to lakewood, right?

586
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:01,898
Sometimes.

587
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,737
I've-I've seen you around. We've
just never really... T-talked.

588
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,073
Freshman.

589
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,108
Junior.

590
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:19,549
I-i don't... I don't really need
the cat litter. I just, um...

591
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:23,252
I don't even know why I said that.
I don't even have a cat.

592
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,614
I just know that they shit a
bunch, so... i like your shoes.

593
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,793
I gotta go.

594
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,130
Uh... okay.

595
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,774
Look on the bright side,
you know.

596
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:50,546
I mean, maybe they'll get married and then
my best friend will be a part of my family.

597
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:52,248
Helpful. Thank you.

598
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,051
It really bothers me she's not
giving you rides anymore though.

599
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:58,020
I'm gonna have to talk to her about that.
No, you're not!

600
00:45:58,022 --> 00:46:02,425
I can't drive you every morning. It puts me
on the freeway late and adds 40 minutes.

601
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:06,329
If you do that, i will do something
equally terrible to you.

602
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,968
I will tell everyone on Facebook that
you pluck your nipples. How about that?

603
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:15,905
Oh.

604
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,578
Look, just tell me what you
want to hear and I'll say it.

605
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,447
Mom... i want to make
you feel better.

606
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,283
What can I say to do that?
I don't know.

607
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,155
Here's what I do
when I'm feeling down.

608
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:38,728
I get very quiet and very still.

609
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,798
And I say to myself...

610
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:47,336
Everyone in the world is as
miserable and empty as I am.

611
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,674
There's just better pretending.

612
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,014
Try it sometime.

613
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,016
Might bring you some peace.

614
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:42,859
Hey, uh, do you guys
know where erwin Kim is?

615
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:44,560
I guess he hangs out
around here sometimes.

616
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:47,296
Yeah, he's working on
his project for sff.

617
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,899
Sf-what?
The student film festival?

618
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,870
Right.
Yeah.

619
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:55,104
Sff.

620
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,401
Hey, um, I gotta talk to you
about some homework.

621
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,947
I didn't need to talk to you
about homework. I lied.

622
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,721
Are you enjoying my company?

623
00:48:45,723 --> 00:48:47,857
You're a barrel of monkeys.

624
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,629
You never told me
if you have a wife.

625
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,368
You should date my mother.

626
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,804
Her last boyfriend turned out
to be an Internet perv.

627
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,739
She's very, very fragile,
very, um...

628
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,708
"oh, save me."

629
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:09,078
Men like that, right, though? 'Cause
at the end of the day they all wanna...

630
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,713
All wanna be a hero.

631
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:13,149
Everyone just wants to feel
important in life.

632
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,718
Thing is, no matter
how important they are,

633
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,954
there's always gonna be
someone more important.

634
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,790
People get so uptight about that.
Oh, no, they're better than me.

635
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:23,059
It's like, god,
they don't realize

636
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:24,894
important doesn't matter.

637
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:26,829
It's confidence. When confidence
breaks into the room...

638
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,497
It wins every single time.

639
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:31,334
Doesn't matter if it's real or pulling
it straight out of their ass.

640
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:33,216
People are dumb.
They don't know the difference.

641
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,514
You know what?
I'm gonna go ahead

642
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:48,316
and I'm gonna tell you the real reason
I'm having lunch with you today.

643
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:55,825
You see, I don't, uh... i don't really
have any friends at the moment.

644
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,828
And to be completely honest
with you, I'm not interested.

645
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:02,698
At all. My entire generation
is a bunch of mouth-breathers.

646
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,501
They literally have a seizure if you
take their phone away for a second.

647
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,436
They can't communicate
without emojis.

648
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:10,840
They actually think that the world wants
to know that they are "eating a taco!"

649
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:14,043
Exclamation point. Smiley face, smiley
face, smile... like we give a fuck.

650
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,980
I am an old soul.

651
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:23,652
I like old music and old movies
and even old people.

652
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:27,390
Bottom line is i have nothing in
common with the people out there,

653
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:29,291
and they have nothing
in common with me.

654
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,462
Nadine.

655
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,064
Max.

656
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,801
Maybe...

657
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:40,536
Nobody likes you.

658
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,309
You're a dick.

659
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:49,645
Maybe nobody likes you, huh?

660
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:53,582
You're always... you're always in a shit
mood. You're a really shitty teacher.

661
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:55,818
You put zero effort
into everything you do.

662
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,521
And there's no way you're proud of that.
Look at you. Look at...

663
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:01,357
Like, you do nothing. Look at your hair.
You don't even...

664
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,727
You don't do your hair 'cause you
don't have any hair. You're bald.

665
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,029
You know what? You know
why you're not married?

666
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:11,434
Because bald men are gross and disgusting, and
especially the ones that make $45,000 a year.

667
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,957
What?

668
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:44,900
I've been doing this 23 years
and...

669
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:48,170
You're the first person to
ever underestimate my salary.

670
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,376
That made me feel good.
I mean, that... that part.

671
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,524
What are you doing?

672
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,661
I'm giving you half my cookie.

673
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,331
Why?

674
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,335
Make you feel better.
Jesus.

675
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,741
Guess what.

676
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:30,079
You're my favorite student.

677
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:32,181
Does that help?

678
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,560
Am I really
your favorite student?

679
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,864
It felt like
the right thing to say.

680
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:59,808
I didn't mean, like,
completely bald, by the way.

681
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,544
It's smart
what you do there too.

682
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:04,547
You kind of...
You kind of, you know...

683
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:07,349
I don't know.
Do you poof it up a little bit?

684
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,218
Give it a little zhuzh?

685
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,354
I'm glad you circled back
around and cleaned that up.

686
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,456
It certainly made me
feel better.

687
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:18,894
<i>The dog's good,</i>

688
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:20,896
<i>but our real competition
is the hypno-toad.</i>

689
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:31,407
- No, no.
- Yeah, I'm serious.

690
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,776
I practice those steps
all the time.

691
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

692
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:33,202
I heard you were looking
for me at lunch.

693
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:36,372
Yeah, I can't talk right now.
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

694
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:38,173
I just got... okay.

695
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,891
<i>Hello?</i>
Sorry.

696
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:58,327
Um, I just took some medicine.

697
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:00,496
<i>I'll call after it kicks in.</i>
Wait. What's wrong?

698
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:03,432
Are you... are you sick?
<i>No, I'm fine. I'm not. No.</i>

699
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:07,169
Medicine. Like... like
an antidepressant, whatever.

700
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:09,238
They gave them to me
when my dad died.

701
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,573
I was only on them
for a month though.

702
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,876
People take them all the time.
It's totally normal.

703
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,012
<i>Oh.</i>

704
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:19,014
Does that make you think
I'm pathetic all of a sudden?

705
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,183
<i>Oh, no. No, I think...</i>

706
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:25,154
I think you're
perfectly fine. Seriously.

707
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,632
Hey, do you have...
Do you have a swimming pool?

708
00:55:36,634 --> 00:55:38,133
Yeah.

709
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:40,536
Can I come swim in it?

710
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:44,173
- I know I can swim in mine. I
just know I wouldn't relax. -Yes.

711
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:47,443
<i>I got towels. We're good to go.
We're green. We're good.</i>

712
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:50,112
Okay. Cool.
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>

713
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:53,215
- Yeah, I'll see you in a
little bit then. -Okay.

714
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,392
Y-y-y-y-yes!

715
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,141
- Hey. -Geez, erwin. I
would've been nicer to you.

716
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:22,144
Ah.

717
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:29,551
Hey, I wish my bathtub
got this hot.

718
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,587
Why didn't you tell me
you were rich?

719
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:34,590
- I thought I did. I always
try to tell everyone. -What?

720
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,396
You didn't tell me you were
in a film festival either.

721
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:42,564
You didn't tell me
anything, erwin.

722
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:47,603
Maybe it's because
i can't get a word in.

723
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:50,739
Do I really talk that much?
Oh, yeah.

724
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,275
I'm gonna drown
myself now. Good-bye.

725
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:54,343
Bye.

726
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,258
Hey. Thanks for
letting me come over.

727
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,493
Um, I'm glad you did.

728
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,006
Do you want to have sex
right now?

729
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,377
- Okay.

730
00:57:28,379 --> 00:57:30,145
I'm just kidding.
I was just...

731
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:34,082
You know that I was just... i was
just playing out the movie scene.

732
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,318
You ever feel like you have to do that?
There's a waterfall.

733
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,422
It's all romantic.
Sure. Yeah. Right.

734
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:43,292
I'm sorry. I just...

735
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:45,060
Whatever.

736
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,629
What are you, mad now?

737
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,932
You can't be mad. You were gonna
have sex with me two seconds ago.

738
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:53,168
- You don't say that stuff to a man.
- Oh, a man, huh?

739
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,308
Erwin, come ba...
What are you doing?

740
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:02,177
You're gonna press a button that
sucks me into the drain, aren't you?

741
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,947
So, what's your film
about anyway?

742
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:41,683
I'm still figuring it out.

743
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:46,321
Uh, my drawing teacher asked a few
of us to enter an animation project.

744
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:50,058
Oh, that's cool. I didn't know you draw.
What kind of stuff?

745
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,831
Look at these. Wow.

746
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,866
Damn, erwin.

747
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:01,503
Yeah, this is, uh, mostly unfinished.
Uh, this doodling mostly.

748
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:03,672
Um, but not quite where i...

749
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:07,643
Oh. I... I think
I've found my favorite.

750
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,912
Yeah, my, uh...
My parents love that one too.

751
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:12,247
- Do they?
- No, they don't.

752
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:14,716
No, they're very conservative.
No, they don't.

753
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,352
Wow.
They're both you, right?

754
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:20,455
Yeah. I'm multifaceted.

755
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,926
Rad self-portrait.

756
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:29,031
Man. Wow.

757
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:33,335
Uh... man, erwin,
you're really good.

758
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:36,572
Do you, um, you know,
wanna come on Saturday?

759
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:39,007
To see the film.

760
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:42,077
It's early in the morning,
super inconvenient, so...

761
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,947
I hope you say yes. You can
take time to think about it.

762
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:48,250
I don't expect an answer, like, right
now, 'cause that would be rude.

763
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:53,422
That's a lot of pressure. So...
just laying it out there.

764
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:54,790
Yeah, I'd love to come.

765
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,559
Oh. Okay.

766
00:59:57,561 --> 01:00:00,796
Are your parents going?
I can just sit with them.

767
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:05,567
My parents are in Korea
for three months.

768
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:07,603
They won't make it.
Are you serious?

769
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:11,073
You've had this whole place
to yourself for three months?

770
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:12,774
Yay.

771
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:19,715
No, I get it. It's a big house.
You're bored.

772
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,117
You know what you need?

773
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:25,053
You need someone to rob you
so you can reenact<i> home alone.</i>

774
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:26,989
That is...

775
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:30,492
That is exactly
what I need. Thank you.

776
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,017
I can't get out.

777
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:59,121
Can you just go
around the block once?

778
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:00,956
I'm not going around
the block. We're here.

779
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,858
It's an inappropriate time.
Just go.

780
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,894
I have to be at work
at 8:30, Nadine.

781
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,334
Oh, my god.

782
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:14,703
Are we really back
to this again?

783
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,707
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

784
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:23,845
Thank you. You can just
loop around up here.

785
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,947
No, no, no.

786
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:28,483
I'm going to work,
and you're coming with me.

787
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:30,819
My boss isn't going
to be happy about it,

788
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:33,055
and you're the one that gets
to explain it to him.

789
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,527
Don't you have something to do?

790
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,862
Schoolwork or something.

791
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,233
Hmm?

792
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,253
Can I have this hole punch?
Give that to me.

793
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:07,723
I want you to just sit there
for the next eight hours

794
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,685
and don't touch anything
and don't make any noise.

795
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,096
Can I mime?

796
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,610
You're not funny.

797
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:31,613
If my husband had any idea what I
was gonna have to deal with...

798
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:37,619
I love how you refer to him
as your husband.

799
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:39,621
He<i> is</i> my husband.

800
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:41,757
You can run off
and get a new husband.

801
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:43,625
What he is is my dad.

802
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:45,727
Can you just say that
occasionally?

803
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:47,596
Fine.

804
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:50,766
We're not talking about him right
now, 'cause it's just too upsetting.

805
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:53,401
"And too hard and too sad and it
gives me a cluster headache."

806
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:55,637
I know.

807
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:59,875
Oh, my god.
You have no compassion.

808
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:02,644
Actually, I'm just bored,

809
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:05,781
because I know everything you're
going to do before you do it.

810
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,649
- Sure you do.
- Oh, you don't believe me?

811
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:09,451
No, I don't.

812
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:12,654
I'm gonna write down the next
thing you're gonna say to me.

813
01:03:12,656 --> 01:03:15,056
- I'm not gonna play...
Your little games, Nadine.

814
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,160
Congratulations.

815
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,327
Hmm.

816
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,932
All right, you know what?

817
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:27,602
- Here's something you're
not gonna guess. -Hmm.

818
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:31,206
Your dad would be so disappointed
in the way you're turning out.

819
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,849
Did you just take my keys?

820
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:46,721
Nadine.

821
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:59,968
You take that car,
i will call the police!

822
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,536
I will call the police!

823
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:44,312
Nick. I'm just gonna say it.

824
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:47,215
I like you.
I've liked you for months.

825
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:50,385
I think about you every second. I
don't know. Maybe I even love you.

826
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,421
You're so complicated
but simple.

827
01:04:53,423 --> 01:04:55,857
And I just feel
this connection between us.

828
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:59,761
I feel like I already know you.
And I just wanna be with you.

829
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:01,863
I wanna give you head.

830
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:04,699
I want you to put
your mouth on my tits.

831
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:07,168
I wanna feel you inside me.

832
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,437
We can do it
in the petland stockroom.

833
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:11,106
Nadine.

834
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,442
Oh, my god.

835
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,780
Oh, my god.

836
01:05:18,782 --> 01:05:22,284
You sound like
a fucking psychopath.

837
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:27,188
You can't send this.

838
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:29,858
What? No.

839
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,660
Je... oh, my god.

840
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:36,731
Oh, my god. No way.
No, no. No way. No. Fuck!

841
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,633
Oh, my god.

842
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,303
Shit.

843
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:58,086
Look, I don't wanna take up
a ton of your time...

844
01:05:58,088 --> 01:06:00,322
But I'm gonna kill myself.

845
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:08,630
"You're complicated and simple."

846
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:12,067
And I just feel
this connection between us.

847
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:14,469
"I feel like i already know
you." This is kind of sweet.

848
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,105
I think you're overreacting.
"I just wanna be with you."

849
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:20,108
I wanna give you... head.

850
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:23,778
I want you to put your...

851
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,448
Mouth on my... tits.

852
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:31,686
I wanna feel you inside me.

853
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:36,191
"We can do it
in the petland stockroom."

854
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:44,432
Say something. Oh, my god,
say something, please.

855
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:45,700
Help me.

856
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:48,703
You need to watch out
for run-on sentences.

857
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:51,606
But can't you just do something? Can't
you... can't you just do something?

858
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:54,509
You gotta be able to do something.
Y-y-y-y... come on.

859
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:58,346
I don't know.
Maybe confiscate his phone?

860
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,783
Um... uh, his computer.
His computer.

861
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:04,486
You can maybe,
um, get his address.

862
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:06,721
If you get his address and you
confiscate his phone, great.

863
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:09,057
Get his address. You give it to me.
I'm gonna go there.

864
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:12,293
And I'm gonna, um...
Nadine. Nadine.

865
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:15,163
Just... take fifth
period off, all right?

866
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:16,798
Try to relax.

867
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,735
Listen to some music,
have a yogurt.

868
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:25,173
Uh, maybe just... just take it easy.
Can you do that?

869
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:28,543
And, uh, if you have any,

870
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:31,279
you know, complications...

871
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:33,915
Let me know.

872
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:39,554
Okay?
Okay.

873
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,256
Don't worry.
Thank you.

874
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:43,558
It's gonna be okay.

875
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,926
Thank you.

876
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,329
Can I have some money
for the yogurt?

877
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,969
I want change.

878
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:29,070
<i>I just want you to know I've never been
more humiliated in my entire life.</i>

879
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:31,406
<i>I absolutely cannot...</i>

880
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:35,777
<i>Okay, Nadine, so now I need
you to pick up the phone...</i>

881
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:39,447
<i>I just... I just don't
understand you, Nadine. I...</i>

882
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,383
<i>If you think you're keeping
that phone, you are dreaming.</i>

883
01:08:42,385 --> 01:08:44,719
<i>The second you come home,
that phone is going.</i>

884
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:47,956
<i>I am done. I am done
trying to understand you...</i>

885
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,534
Please.

886
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,508
Please, god, help me.

887
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:17,085
Why do I even bother?

888
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,523
Why do I even...

889
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:24,559
You've never given me one thing.

890
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,430
Any time I ask you
for anything, you're like,

891
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:32,267
"oh, you need help with something?
Let me help you.

892
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:35,036
I'm just playing. I'm gonna
butt-fuck you some more."

893
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,363
Who is this?

894
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,740
Oh, my god.

895
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,411
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

896
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,383
What?

897
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,753
Holy shit.

898
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:28,590
Holy shit. Oh, my god.
Okay. Calm down.

899
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:30,391
Just relax.

900
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,060
Um...

901
01:10:32,062 --> 01:10:36,164
Sounds...

902
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:37,699
Cool.

903
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:38,933
Sounds cool.

904
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,740
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

905
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,117
Oh, geez!

906
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,154
Oh!

907
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:45,667
Oh.

908
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:54,842
Ooh.

909
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:00,515
Better than this assholes. Please
hurry the hell up and graduate.

910
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,322
Hey, one sec.

911
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:09,557
Oh, tell krista
about the time when...

912
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:15,897
What? Wait. Slo... slow down.
What do you mean?

913
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:24,339
Okay. Ma, you... calm down.

914
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:26,841
I do my best to pick you up.

915
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:30,678
I'm just saying we could
have won every game.

916
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,548
I, uh... I'm gonna catch up
with you guys later.

917
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,950
Are you kidding, man?
It's a long story.

918
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:39,020
See you.
See you, man.

919
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:41,456
Hey. Hey, what happened?
No, it's fine.

920
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:43,324
It's not fine.

921
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,827
No, you're having fun. You should stay.
I'll come with you.

922
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:47,428
Thanks.
Yeah.

923
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:03,778
Hey.

924
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,836
You look cute.

925
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:30,438
Thank you.

926
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,645
So... so do you. Yeah.

927
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:44,685
Mom?

928
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,722
Hey, mom.

929
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:49,257
No.

930
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,359
Oh.

931
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,963
- What are you doing?
- It's going to goodwill.

932
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:57,432
All of it.

933
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:59,801
Everything
that's on the floor, gone.

934
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:03,271
- Mom, why don't you just calm down, okay?
- I'm done putting up with it.

935
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:06,974
All of this.

936
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,943
All right, hey, hey, hey.
Can you believe it?

937
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,978
It's okay.
What is this?

938
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,114
What is all this crap?
Please stop for a second.

939
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:15,416
She left her flat iron on.

940
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:17,485
She wants to burn the goddamn house down!
Please stop for a second.

941
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:19,587
This is going.

942
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:21,956
Okay, all right.
Stop. Just give it to me.

943
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,791
Hey!
Just give me the bag.

944
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,326
I am the adult here, not you!

945
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:28,196
Then why do you always call me?

946
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,000
Oh, my god.

947
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,672
Oh, my god. You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

948
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:46,080
I just don't have anybody else.
You're the only one.

949
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,021
What are you doing?

950
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:55,990
I'm handling it.

951
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,510
Wow. Look at this view.
It's amazing.

952
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:44,338
<i>Look, you know what to do.</i>

953
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,641
<i>I'm not gonna be
an asshole and tell you.</i>

954
01:15:49,012 --> 01:15:50,478
<i>Look, you know what to do.</i>

955
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,150
I love this song.

956
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,294
I can't believe
this is happening.

957
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:46,400
There's so much that I've
wanted to tell you and ask you,

958
01:16:46,402 --> 01:16:48,269
and I just can't believe this...

959
01:16:51,374 --> 01:16:53,174
Um...
Bzzzz.

960
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,279
Oh, wow. It just keeps
going back, doesn't it?

961
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,240
- I'll move this stuff.
- Oh, good.

962
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:28,075
Yeah.

963
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:29,477
I don't know if...

964
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:30,845
Yeah.

965
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,684
Oh, I'll get it.

966
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:38,953
I don't know if I should... no.
Get off!

967
01:17:38,955 --> 01:17:40,254
- Get off! Off!
- Okay.

968
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:42,256
Get off.
Okay.

969
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:46,527
- What the hell?

970
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,520
I, um... I really liked
that song earlier.

971
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:16,724
- What was the name of it again?
- I don't remember.

972
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,862
I can...
I can just Google it.

973
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:34,975
Anyway, do you maybe wanna go
for a walk or something?

974
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:43,217
We could maybe...
Catch a movie.

975
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:50,424
Or we could sit here silently in
your Mercury Marquis all night.

976
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:56,363
Are you serious?
What?

977
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,399
Now you're making fun of my car?

978
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:00,768
What? No. I-i-i was
just being specific.

979
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:02,436
I wasn't saying that
because it's shitty.

980
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:04,105
All right.
No, god, no.

981
01:19:04,107 --> 01:19:06,440
Look, I love your car.
I don't even have a car.

982
01:19:06,442 --> 01:19:09,076
I'm just acting weird,
and this is just all a lot.

983
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,779
- And please stop.
Please don't leave.

984
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,873
- Fuck!
- What?

985
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:41,308
I don't understand you.
What do you... what?

986
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:43,043
What do you want?
What do you mean?

987
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:45,946
What do you want? To talk,
to get to know you,

988
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,215
not just do it
in the first five seconds.

989
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:52,987
You wrote me a novel about how you were
dying to blow me in petland, you psycho.

990
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:54,822
I'm not here to get to know you.

991
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:58,659
This is so stupid.

992
01:19:58,661 --> 01:20:00,961
So stupid.

993
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:03,164
Why didn't I listen
to my friends?

994
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,635
Come on.

995
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:10,237
Come on.

996
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,674
Now you're gonna try to make me the bad
guy? You're the one who messaged me.

997
01:20:13,676 --> 01:20:15,509
I hope you hit a tree
in this piece of shit!

998
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:18,479
I hope you get
fucking paralyzed!

999
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,257
Let's go, lady.

1000
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:40,294
Did you get a doughnut
from these people?

1001
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:42,429
No.

1002
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:15,562
What the...

1003
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:17,898
Why is that baby in your house?

1004
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,535
Oh, shit. How the hell
did that thing get in here?

1005
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:22,636
Hello.

1006
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:28,776
This is Toby, and this is greer.

1007
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:30,611
- Hi.
- How are you?

1008
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:32,780
Good. How are you doing? Good.

1009
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:35,282
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1010
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:38,319
Now, your mother's number.

1011
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:42,222
And who's got the stinky feet?

1012
01:22:42,224 --> 01:22:45,492
Who's got the stinky feet?
Let me smell. Hold on.

1013
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:48,429
Oh. Oh. Oh!

1014
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:52,266
Toby's got the stinky feet.

1015
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:54,668
Don't stare.
Makes him self-conscious.

1016
01:22:57,072 --> 01:23:00,240
Can I get you something else? Any ice cream
or anything before I put the baby down?

1017
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:01,909
I'm good.
Thank you.

1018
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:05,813
No, no. I can feed and water
her from here. All right.

1019
01:23:05,815 --> 01:23:08,349
All right, come on, tiny man.
It's you and me, buddy.

1020
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:10,284
Big boy.

1021
01:23:10,286 --> 01:23:12,953
There you go.
Yeah.

1022
01:23:12,955 --> 01:23:17,992
Look, I just want to say, i don't know the
whole story, but whatever it is, it'll pass.

1023
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:20,427
I went through a rough time
not too long ago too.

1024
01:23:20,429 --> 01:23:24,198
- But look where it led me.
- This is the face of hope.

1025
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,399
Ah.

1026
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,370
All right.
Good night.

1027
01:23:29,372 --> 01:23:31,338
I'll be in in a minute.
All right.

1028
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,706
Good night.
Good night.

1029
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:34,141
- Say night-night.
- Good night.

1030
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:36,677
Night-night, daddy.
Night-night.

1031
01:23:38,948 --> 01:23:40,581
Oh, I think that's for you.

1032
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,952
Come on.

1033
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:54,795
No, that's... that's not my mother.
Don't open the door.

1034
01:23:54,797 --> 01:23:57,531
Hello there!

1035
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,978
- What are you doing here?
- Get in the car. Let's go.

1036
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:13,247
- No, mom's picking me up.
- No, she's not.

1037
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:14,581
Get in the car.

1038
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:19,453
Well, I don't feel like getting
in the car with you and her.

1039
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,458
Do you know what I've
been doing all night?

1040
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,361
I'll find another ride.

1041
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:29,696
Hey. Hey.
Get in the car.

1042
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:31,832
- Stop! -No, you think
this is fun for me, huh?

1043
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:34,068
- Let go of me.
- You think I like this?

1044
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:37,905
Where were you? You can't
pick up your phone even once?

1045
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:40,741
You don't need to pretend you give a shit
about me just because people are watching.

1046
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:43,243
- Oh, give me a break.
- Oh, face it.

1047
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:47,681
You can't wait to take me home so you can be
mom's little hero. You live for that shit.

1048
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:04,965
Just let it go.

1049
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:07,034
Darian.

1050
01:25:07,036 --> 01:25:08,969
Darian! Darian!

1051
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,475
I just want you to know you're
right, Nadine. Darian, we don't...

1052
01:25:14,477 --> 01:25:16,043
You're right about everything.

1053
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:22,883
I don't give a shit about you.

1054
01:25:22,885 --> 01:25:27,154
I'm only here for me, and my
life is fucking incredible.

1055
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,156
I love it.

1056
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:34,661
No, I love spending another night
talking mom off the ledge.

1057
01:25:34,663 --> 01:25:36,563
I love only applying
to schools nearby

1058
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:38,999
because who knows what'll happen in
that house if I'm not around to fix it.

1059
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:41,735
And I love...

1060
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:44,838
That the one person who makes me feel
like i can take a fucking breath...

1061
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,346
I can't have without
completely destroying you.

1062
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,816
So you're right.

1063
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:59,319
You're right. It's a blast.

1064
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:00,854
I win.

1065
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:10,531
Can you give her
a ride home, please?

1066
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:12,766
Thanks.

1067
01:26:55,977 --> 01:27:00,147
Look, I'm not very good
at this kind of thing. Uh...

1068
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:03,750
But I think we both know
what needs to be said right now,

1069
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:07,588
so I'm just gonna come
right out and say it.

1070
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,459
Get out of the car.

1071
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:23,103
Bye.

1072
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:24,605
See you Monday.

1073
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,029
Hey.

1074
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:32,572
Um...

1075
01:28:32,574 --> 01:28:36,009
Look, I just... i just
wanted to say, um, that...

1076
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,915
I'm sorry for being
a bitch tonight.

1077
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:47,587
And for the past
couple of weeks.

1078
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,159
And the past 17 years
before that.

1079
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:59,599
I know this isn't any easier for you.
I know that.

1080
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:02,703
I think some deranged part
of me likes thinking

1081
01:29:02,705 --> 01:29:05,839
I'm the only one
with real problems.

1082
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,842
Like that makes me special.

1083
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:16,149
You know,
ever since we were little,

1084
01:29:16,151 --> 01:29:18,852
I would get this feeling like...

1085
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:24,758
Like I'm floating outside of my
body, looking down at myself...

1086
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,895
And I hate what I see...

1087
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:34,401
How I'm acting, the way I sound.

1088
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,639
And I don't know
how to change it.

1089
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:44,244
And I'm so scared...

1090
01:29:44,246 --> 01:29:47,414
That the feeling
is never gonna go away.

1091
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:56,256
I'm sorry.

1092
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:59,259
Really.

1093
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:02,763
Good night.

1094
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:06,767
Hey, Nadine.

1095
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:17,944
Uh...

1096
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:48,975
Ah.

1097
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:53,480
Good night.
Good night.

1098
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,738
Hey.

1099
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:20,574
Hey.

1100
01:31:20,576 --> 01:31:22,843
You're up early.

1101
01:31:22,845 --> 01:31:26,580
Uh, yeah. I, um...
I got a thing to go to.

1102
01:31:26,582 --> 01:31:28,582
Yeah.

1103
01:31:28,584 --> 01:31:30,083
Well, have a good day.

1104
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:38,492
You as well. Have a...

1105
01:31:38,494 --> 01:31:40,861
Have a good day, both of you.

1106
01:31:40,863 --> 01:31:42,462
A great day.

1107
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,197
Thank you.

1108
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:46,132
Um...

1109
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:49,669
Can I call you later?

1110
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:52,038
Okay.

1111
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:57,177
That was good.
Mm-hmm.

1112
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:59,479
Right?
That was so good.

1113
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:01,548
I miss her.

1114
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,610
Nadine?

1115
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:41,955
Sit back, relax and get
ready to enjoy the films.

1116
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:55,335
Oh. Turn off
your cell phone, please.

1117
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,009
Excuse me. Thanks.

1118
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:05,779
Sorry. Sorry.

1119
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:07,140
Really something, wasn't it?
Let's keep things going.

1120
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:10,243
Our next entry, ladies and
gentlemen, comes from erwin Kim...

1121
01:34:10,245 --> 01:34:12,245
Whoo!

1122
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:14,681
Thank you.
Of lakewood high.

1123
01:34:14,683 --> 01:34:17,851
Mr. Kim, would you like to come out
and say a few words about your film?

1124
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:23,890
Come on.

1125
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,962
Hello.
Thank you for coming.

1126
01:34:28,964 --> 01:34:33,933
Uh, hope you enjoy this, uh...

1127
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:36,670
My, uh...

1128
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:39,172
Uh...

1129
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:42,709
Uh...

1130
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:46,980
You can just take this.
Thank you.

1131
01:34:46,982 --> 01:34:48,715
Whoo.
Whoo.

1132
01:34:49,483 --> 01:34:51,618
Uh, okay.

1133
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:54,454
Um, well, here it is.

1134
01:34:54,456 --> 01:34:56,222
Mr. Kim's film.

1135
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:07,600
<i>Once upon a time
on a planet called not saturn...</i>

1136
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:12,639
<i>At alien planet high school...</i>

1137
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:20,747
<i>There was an alien adolescent
who was struck by love.</i>

1138
01:35:23,919 --> 01:35:24,919
<i>Hmm?</i>

1139
01:35:26,187 --> 01:35:28,588
Mm-mmm.
Mm.

1140
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:31,424
Mm-hmm?
Mm-mmm.

1141
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,428
Mm-hmm.
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm, mm.

1142
01:35:53,949 --> 01:35:56,282
Mm.

1143
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,867
Aw!

1144
01:36:15,036 --> 01:36:17,937
Huh?

1145
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:20,273
Hmm.

1146
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,475
- Oh.
- Aw.

1147
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,813
Uh-oh.

1148
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:33,119
Oh.

1149
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:35,588
Too late.

1150
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:37,056
Pool party.

1151
01:36:50,338 --> 01:36:52,505
Whoo!

1152
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:07,220
Erwin.

1153
01:37:08,355 --> 01:37:10,824
That...

1154
01:37:10,826 --> 01:37:12,592
Wow.

1155
01:37:12,594 --> 01:37:14,861
Well, I mean,
i wouldn't go that far.

1156
01:37:14,863 --> 01:37:17,230
No. It was amazing. Really.
It was all right.

1157
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:20,767
Oh, thanks.

1158
01:37:20,769 --> 01:37:23,203
And, uh...

1159
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:26,539
I got the message.

1160
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:30,276
All right?
I know... I know she's me.

1161
01:37:30,278 --> 01:37:33,313
But I already figured out
how great you are.

1162
01:37:33,315 --> 01:37:36,149
You're so fucking great.

1163
01:37:36,151 --> 01:37:38,351
You're, like,
the best person I know.

1164
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:44,123
What? Are... what's wrong?

1165
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:47,393
Um, the film wasn't about you.

1166
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:50,063
Oh, god.

1167
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,065
Shoot.

1168
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:57,070
I just thought maybe because the hair
and, like, the cool shoes that...

1169
01:37:57,072 --> 01:37:58,872
Oh.

1170
01:37:58,874 --> 01:38:01,307
Wow. I'm one of those people that
thinks everything's about them.

1171
01:38:01,309 --> 01:38:02,575
Hmm.

1172
01:38:02,577 --> 01:38:04,244
I'm just messing with you.

1173
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:09,215
Yeah, I'm just messing with you.
I set that up.

1174
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:11,217
You shithead.
Yes!

1175
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:13,086
That felt pretty good.
You being nervous for once,

1176
01:38:13,088 --> 01:38:15,722
and I'm just over here
just sniffing my flowers.

1177
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:19,192
I hate you so much.

1178
01:38:19,194 --> 01:38:20,760
You free to hang?

1179
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:24,097
Yeah, I am.

1180
01:38:24,099 --> 01:38:27,233
