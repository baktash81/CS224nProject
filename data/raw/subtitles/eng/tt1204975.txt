00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,429
Look, just throw some things in a bag.
The flight leaves in a couple of hours.

337
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,116
Come on!
We're not leaving without you.

338
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,932
Either you come with us,
or we move in.

339
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,893
Hold on, hold on.
You show up out of nowhere,

340
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,780
you say we're going to Vegas.
You know what?

341
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:08,106
- This smells of Billy Gherson.
- Oh, Paddy, Billy Gher...?

342
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,691
This... This has nothing to...

343
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,985
Billy, we want him to come,
of course.

344
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,672
But then he...
You know, he's got a big

345
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,614
- important thing he has to do.
- Of course.

346
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,142
He always has something important.

347
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,993
That's the problem.
It's always about him, him, him.

348
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,204
- What's that about?
SAM: - That's just Billy!

349
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,121
- Put it behind you!
PADDY: - That's right,

350
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,582
he's got more important
things to do.

351
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,550
I have more important
things to do right here.

352
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,878
What's with the pictures of Sophie?
They're everywhere.

353
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:32,089
Everywhere I turn,
that's all I see: Sophie!

354
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,056
It's getting a little morbid,
don't you think?

355
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,717
- Don't... Don't touch those.
- Oh.

356
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,636
PADDY: Jesus.
SAM: Okay, sorry.

357
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,554
- I like looking at her.
- Okay.

358
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,390
That stays there,
this stays here.

359
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,726
Okay.
But you come with me to Vegas.

360
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,689
Paddy, you have got to come
with us to Las Vegas.

361
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,816
If you think
I'm leaving this apartment,

362
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,192
you're dumber than that hat.

363
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,028
Say what you want to me,
but leave my hat out of this, okay?

364
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,738
My hat has never done
a thing to you.

365
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,658
- I'm not going to Vegas!
- Paddy!

366
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,743
(WHEEZING)

367
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,414
What, are you...? Are you nuts?

368
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,374
You're gonna give yourself
another stroke!

369
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,542
Archie, you okay?

370
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,001
(WHEEZING)

371
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,796
- Is he...?
- The stairs. Paddy.

372
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,715
You got to come.

373
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,591
You got to come
to Vegas with us.

374
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,386
- Please, Paddy.
- Okay. Okay.

375
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,138
Okay! All right, I'll go!

376
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,515
I'll go! I'm going!
I'm going, okay?

377
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,600
- Great.
- I got to pack.

378
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,853
- Prick.
- Asshole.

379
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,362
That was well done.

380
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,199
PADDY: So Billy was so busy,

381
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,411
he couldn't spend the weekend with
his three oldest friends in the world.

382
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,662
Typical.

383
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,165
Once a selfish bastard,
always a selfish bastard.

384
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,667
Never changes.
Never, never changes.

385
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,274
You know, that's the thing
about him, he's just the way he is.

386
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,881
What was so important that
he couldn't spend it with us?

387
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,090
So important?

388
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,301
I agree with everything
you've said, Paddy.

389
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,886
For the last four hours.

390
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,679
PADDY: Him, him, him.

391
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,431
He didn't even call.

392
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,350
You know, he... A disappointment.
He didn't...

393
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,853
He didn't even call.
All I can say is, if I ever,

394
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,380
ever run into that son of a bitch
again, that prick, I'll...

395
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,857
Forget it.

396
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,776
- He'll regret the day...
- Hey!

397
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,527
Ha, ha! Well!

398
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,737
- Surprise!
SAM: - Hey!

399
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,530
Hey, Archie, how you doing? Sam.

00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,158
Hey! Yay, fun. Fun!

401
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,076
Hey, hey,
what's that hair color?

402
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,643
- Hazelnut?
- Have you got more hair

403
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:27,829
than you used to have?

404
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,207
- Oh, stop it, will you?
- You've got more hair than...

405
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,125
Where'd you get the extra hair?

406
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,252
His ass.

407
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,020
Hey, look, don't be upset
with them, Pat.

408
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,881
- It wasn't their fault.
- I'm going home.

409
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,050
Paddy, look,
I'm getting married, okay?

410
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,177
This is a bachelor party,
I needed you here.

411
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,804
- I'm going home.
- How many times

412
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,210
do I got to tell you I'm sorry?

413
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,707
You can't say it enough, my friend.
You can't say it enough.

Every time I see you,
we go through this shit.

One more word, I'm gonna knock
your block off like I did in fifth grade.

All right, all right, all right.
Hey, hey, hey! Knock this shit off!

The hell's the matter with you?

418
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,904
Now we're here together,
the four of us.

419
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,407
We're here to celebrate
Billy marrying an infant.

420
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,159
- She's not an infant.
- Shut up, Billy!

421
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,079
Archie, blood pressure?

422
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,373
I need this.

423
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,458
Sam needs this.

424
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,546
And believe it or not, you two
jerk-offs need it most of all.

425
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:20,298
Now, either you'll manage
to be civil with each other,

426
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:23,468
or so help me, I'm gonna rain
holy hell down on both of you.

You understand?

428
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,222
- Huh?
- Yeah.

429
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,141
I'm gonna go find some damn water
and take all my damn pills.

430
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,270
Then we gonna get
this damn party started.

431
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,730
Yeah.

432
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,566
It's gonna be fun.

they've just renovated it.

PADDY: - He won't shut up about it.

BILLY: You sound like 6 year olds.

SAM: Billy, now that you've got
ass-hair on your head,

440
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:55,804
do you wash your hair,
or do you just wipe?

come up when you made
the reservation?

453
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:54,309
No, because you insisted
on making the reservations.

a nice weekend together.

When we were kids,

we were in love with the same girl.

it was just two best friends

1383
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:56,050
but as we got older,
it got a little more complicated.

1384
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:59,261
One day, Paddy told Sophie

1385
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:03,098
that she had to make a choice
between the two of us.

1386

She was young.

1388

she belonged with Paddy.

01:27:39,297 --> 01:27:41,257
You can't tell a woman who to love.

1682
01:27:41,424 --> 01:27:44,343
Especially Sophie. You can't do it.

1683
01:27:45,219 --> 01:27:47,346
I know what I had with my wife, Billy.

1684
01:27:47,513 --> 01:27:48,848
Thanks to you.

1685
01:27:49,015 --> 01:27:52,727
So I'm gonna ask you one more time,
you miserable prick.

1686
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:54,020
One more time.

1687
01:27:54,187 --> 01:27:57,356
Do you love this woman
you are about to marry?

1688
01:27:57,523 --> 01:27:59,150

01:28:01,778 --> 01:28:05,114
All right, here's the deal:
You end it, or I will.

1691
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:08,868
Hey, hey, you stay out of this, all right?
It has nothing to do with you.

1692
01:28:12,747 --> 01:28:14,207
Hey, babe!

1693
01:28:14,624 --> 01:28:17,543
- I owe you this one.
- Aah!

1694
01:28:22,507 --> 01:28:25,843
Lisa, my name's Patrick Connors.
Although that imbecile in the pool there

1695
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:28,211
started calling me Paddy
when we were kids and it stuck.

1696
01:28:28,346 --> 01:28:30,386
Oh, right. Paddy!
It's so great to finally meet you.

1697
01:28:30,515 --> 01:28:32,555
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Billy's told me so much.

1698
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:34,044
Why did you throw him in the pool?

1699
01:28:34,185 --> 01:28:36,145
Ah, that's just an old game
from the neighborhood.

1700
01:28:36,312 --> 01:28:38,189
Listen, dear.
Can I tell you something?

1701
01:28:38,356 --> 01:28:40,316
- Yeah.
- Fifty years ago,

1702
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:42,568
Billy did something for me

1703
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:45,613
that allowed me to marry
the only woman I ever loved.

1704
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:47,698
And now it's my chance
to return the favor.

1705
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:52,161
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- He's not in love with you.

1706
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:55,164
He likes you.
I know he likes you a whole lot,

1707
01:28:55,331 --> 01:28:58,167
but he doesn't love you
like the way that he should.

1708
01:28:58,793 --> 01:29:00,169
I can't let him marry you.

1709
01:29:00,336 --> 01:29:02,839
He's my best friend.
I can't let him marry you.

1711
01:29:08,678 --> 01:29:11,138

1713
01:29:14,684 --> 01:29:17,854
That she's young,
got her whole life ahead of her.

1714
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21,065

to let her down easy.

1725
01:30:16,537 --> 01:30:17,747
Yeah?

1726
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:20,625
I couldn't let you marry her.

1727
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:25,838
No, you did it right. You, uh...
Congratulations, a good job.

- You mad?
- No. No, you were right.

Because, you know,
if you're mad that's okay.

1730
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,516
No, Paddy. I... I'm old.

to say goodbye.
