There's my mom and dad

128

when they were
on their honeymoon.

129
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,219
And aunt Zelda,
she lives on a farm.

130
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,155
And that there's Laney,
my best girl.

131
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,290
And that's me,

132
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,724
handsome bloke
if I do say so myself.

133
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,993
No, not that one.

134
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,295
That's Eric, Laney's brother.

135
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,530
Over here...

136
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,201
Yep, mates, it's me, aussie.

137
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,270
Now, I admit I do look different
from the rest of the family.

138
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,873
I walk on all fours,
and I lift my leg up to wee,

139
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,741
but they don't care about that.

140
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,511
They love me and talk to me
like I was one of them.

141
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,581
Laney's my best friend.

142
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,050
She really loves me.

143
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,886
But the day this box arrived,
I got worried.

144
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:07,753
I had a feeling
that Laney would love

145
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,690
what's inside the box.

146
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,660
I knew it from the first time
I saw it.

147
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,132
If I would have known
what was inside that store,

148
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,202
maybe I would have kept walking,
but something called out to me.

149
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,104
My doggie senses were curious.

150
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,639

00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,243

Wow, this store brings back
so many memories.

163
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,885
There's something strange
about this place,

164
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,689
good strange,
not bad strange.

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,673
- Honey,
you know you love him.

359
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,242
- Of course I do.

360
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,577
I would love him more
if he wore a diaper, though.

361
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,614
- Hello.

362
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,315
- Hi, Michael.

363
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:10,983
It's aunt Zelda.

364
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,751
- Oh, well, hi, aunt Zelda.

365
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:13,952
It's so good to talk to you

366
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,221
and so bright and early
in the day.

367
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,291
- Well, you know me:
Up with the roosters.

368
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,792
Got to get up
at the crack of dawn,

369
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,693
lots of stuff to do here
on the farm.

370
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,363
- I don't doubt that.

371
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,831
- So, uh, get this:

372
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,232
I'm leaving in a couple of weeks

373
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,867
for the vacation
of a lifetime, right,

374
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,570
a dream cruise around the world,

375
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,238
everything
I've always dreamed of,

376
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,708
but yesterday, my farm sitter
up and decides to quit,

377
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,510
so I've got nobody
to look after the animals.

378
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,311
- Oh, no.

379
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,879
What are you gonna do?

380
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,516
- Well, i--
I thought I'd ask you city folk.

381
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,618
Do you know anyone
who might want to come up here?

382
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,454
I mean, i'd--I'd ask you guys,
but I know Amelia.

383
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,026
- I can't wait
till winter break.

384
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,895
I hate alarm clocks.

385
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,464
- I will ask around
and see what I can find out.

386
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,433
- I'm willing to pay
five grand a month

387
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,001
for the two months I'm gone

388
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,271
plus all the fresh eggs
you can eat.

389
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,640
- Well, that should definitely
open up some possibilities.

390
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,609
I will ask around,
and then I'll get back to you.

391
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,777
- Oh, got to go.

392
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,611
The goats ripped up
my rhubarb again.

393
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,846
- Your what?

394
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,848
- Rhubarb, rhubarb,
right next to the pepper patch.

395
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,917
We'll talk later.

396
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:32,030
- Aussie, have you seen my bear?

397
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,765
- Oh, no, don't ask me.

398
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,968
Bear...what bear?

399
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,971
- I want to put
the syrup on myself.

400
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,772
- Okay, don't drown them.

401
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,841
Laney.

402
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:47,512
- Hey,
why can't we be farm sitters?

403
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,081
- You know,
that's not a half-bad idea.

404
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,682
- Are you nuts?

405
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,416
- Well, think about it, honey.

406
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,318
We have to be out of here soon.

407
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,486
The kids are gonna be
on winter break.

408
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,788
We save on rent.

409
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,624
We make a few bucks,
and at least we'll have a minute

410
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,958
to sort of make a plan.

411
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,961
- I know nothing
about running a farm,

412
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,463
except that there
are lots of animals,

413
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,399
and it smells bad.

414
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,934
Laney, you're going to be late.

415
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,740
- That went well.

416
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,542
Ugh.

417
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,884
- Laney.

418
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,386
Honey, what are you doing?

419
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,453
- I can't find Ted.

420
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,355
- Your bear?
You lost him already?

421
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,490
- I didn't lose him.

422
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,858
He slept right next to me
last night.

423
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,992
Then this morning,
he was gone.

424
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,495
- Well, did you check
under the bed?

425
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,929
- I checked everywhere.

426
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,598
Why would he go away?

427
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,533
He was in such a good mood
last night.

428
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,101
- What do you mean,
"he was in a good mood"?

429
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,503
- He was glowing.

430
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,037
I could hear his thoughts.

431
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,071
He was really happy.

432
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:50,676
- He was glowing,
and you could hear his thoughts?

433
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,910
Are you feeling all right,
honey?

434
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,145
- I want Ted.

435
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,713
- All right, well,
I'll look for him today

436
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,714
while you're at school.

437
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:56,782
Now, come on, let's go.

438
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,784
You're gonna be late.

439
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,058
- Poor Laney.

440
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,428
I'm starting to feel
a little guilty about all this.

441
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,730
Oh, well, she'll get over it.

442
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,615
- Oh, no, not that noise.

443
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,719
I hate
that vacuum cleaner noise.

444
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,522
The vacuum cleaner...
Oh, no.

445
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,863
Oh.

446
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:49,434
Hmm.

447
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,169
Hmm.

448
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,073
Oh, too late.

449
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,908
Great hiding place, aussie.

450
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,915
- Do you really glow, bear?

451
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,952
Bear...glow...

452
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,155
Glowing bear...Bear...

453
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,758
Bear, glow...

454
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,659
Glowing...

455
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,228
Bear, glow, glowing bear,

456
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,830
bear, glowing,

457
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,666
he-yaaa, glowing, glow...

458
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,934
Glow...

459
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:27,839
Hi.

460
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,681
- All right, mom's leaving,
finally.

461
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:40,919
Now's my chance to take care
of this once and for all, right.

462
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:56,468
Love at first sight?

463
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,938
I'll show you
love at first bite.

464
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,808
They won't find you this time.

465
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,018
I'm a genius.

466
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,787
Nobody will ever find him here.

467
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,538
- Look at that.

468
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,674
You're making her miserable.

469
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,275
You're her best friend.

470
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,977
- She used to be
your best friend.

471
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,812
She turned her back on you,
aussie.

472
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,714
- I do feel a little guilty.

473
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,049
- Guilty?

474
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:47,252
You should change your email
to doofus@lame.Com.

475
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,254
- You feel guilty,
because you love her.

476
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,790
Go get the bear,
and bring it to Laney.

477
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,924
- I agree.

478
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,192
- For real?

479
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,895
- Yeah, feeling guilty
is a waste of time.

480
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:01,166
- Laney, baby,
brushy, brushy, brushy.

481
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,736
Come on, sweetie.

482
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,238
What's that matter, sweetheart?

483
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,607
- I miss Ted.

484
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,043
- I know, but you've got

485
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,046
at least 30 more stuffed animals
in your closet,

486
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,182
and a few of those
are Teddy bears too.

487
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,717
- They're not the same.

488
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,652
I could see his glow
and hear his thoughts.

489
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,555
He was really special.

490
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,692
- Well, don't give up so easily,
all right?

491
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,895
We might still find him, okay?

492
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,267
In the meantime,

493
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,936
you still have to
brush your teeth, okay?

494

I'd made my best friend.

the Teddy bear in his mouth.

he went this way.

I saw him run down this street,

1121

where he went after that.

Aussie, is it true
that you were the one

1125
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:54,690
that took that bear
from your human?

1126
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:58,661
- Rufus told you that,
didn't he?

1127
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:00,162
Yeah, I reckon it's true.

1128
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,465
- How could you?

1129
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:04,400
- Wait, let me explain.

1130

I was just...So jealous.

1131
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,371
My human loves that bear.

1132
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,473
I thought maybe she loved him
more than me,

1133
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:13,209
so yeah,
I hid him in the yard,

1134
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,744
but then I felt bad about it.

1135
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:17,313
I don't want my human
to be sad.

1136
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,081
- We are dogs, aussie.

1137
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,650
We should always be proud
of the fact

1138
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:23,119
that we love
our humans unconditionally.

1139
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:24,620
- Unconditionally?

1140
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:28,090
- It means we love them
no matter what.

1141
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,293
I'm disappointed in you, aussie.

1142
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:33,195
- I'm disappointed in me too.

1143
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,465
Hey, what's going on?

1144
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:39,702
Sirens?

1145
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,446

you're gonna have to move back.

1146

It's not safe here.

1148
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:13,636
I can feel you, Ted.

1149
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,471
You're in there, aren't you?

1150
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,775
- Okay, are we ready?

1151
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,243
- All right, we're speeded.
- Great.

1152
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,812
- And...go.

1153
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:26,082
- Thankfully,
nobody lives in this house.

1154
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:28,451
Neighbors say
it's been vacant for years.

1155
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,533
- Are you crazy?

1156
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,268
Don't even think about it.

1157
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,504
- I'm ready to do
what's right, aussie.

1158
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:50,172
- Out of my way, bubble brains.

1159
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,208
I got to get in there.

1160
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:55,244
- That's a dog there.

1161
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:57,413
- Did you see that dog run in?

1162
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,415
- Get a move, buddy.

1163
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:00,483
All: Whoa.

1164
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,800
- Hey, the dog's coming out,
look, look.

1165
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,368
- Oh, here comes the dog.

1166
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:22,471
- Hey, the dog.

1167
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:25,341
- Whoa, did you see that dog?

1168
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,843
Are you getting this?

1169
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,712
We're here at the scene
of a local house fire

1170
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:30,880
that broke out earlier today.

1171
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:34,250
Now, as we were reporting
on the fire,

1172
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,619
we caught these images
of a dog running into...

1173
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,888
- That's the dog
who visited our store.

1174
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:44,226
- Not just any dog,
a very special dog.

1175
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,329
They are taking care
of each other now,

1176
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,731
and hopefully,

1177
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:52,334
they will find their way
to the farm,

1178
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,804
and they will reunite
with the family.

1179
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:57,473
- Mei Mei?

1180
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,342
- It feels so good

1181
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:03,712
to reunite with the family.

1182
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:12,822
- Oh, Mei Mei.

1183
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,526
- Ted, look,
we're finally home.

1184
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:23,332
Oh, no.

1185
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:24,533
What's happened?

1186
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,435
They're gone.

1187
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:30,172
I smell Laney.

1188
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,807
There's a picture.

1189
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,410
It looks like animals,
'but I'm not sure what kind.

1190
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:38,848
Now what am I gonna do?

1191
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:41,417
- She misses us.

1192
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,284
Don't you feel that?

1193
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,353
- All I feel is sad.

1194
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,255
Everybody's gone.

1195
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,858
I don't have a family anymore.

1196
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,193
You'd better stay here, Ted.

1197
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:53,329
I'm sure someone will find you
and give you a home.

1198
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:54,263
- Don't leave me here, aussie.

1199
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,565
I'm home with you.

1200
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,834
- I don't have a home now.

1201
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:02,505
- Then take me to the place
where I came from: To Mei Mei.

1202
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:05,407
- You mean that weird store
with all the statues and stuff?

1203
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:06,876
I know where that is.

1204
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,944

Oh, no, it's Rufus.

So what?

1213
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:46,482
- I saw you jump into that fire
to save the bear.

1214
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:50,753
That was brave of you,
stupid but brave.

1215

So where's the bear?

1216

- Not here, not with me.

1217

- Let's see.

1218
01:09:56,759 --> 01:10:00,763
What is this I smell?

1219
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:01,797

Trust me.

1221

Save your own tail.

1222
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,835
- It's awfully familiar.

1223
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,504
- No, think fast.

1224
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,705
There must be a solution.

1225
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:10,673
- Any ideas?

1226
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,441
I need one urgent.

1227
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:13,275
- What could it be?

1228
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:15,477
- I've got it.

1229
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,479
Remember that time you ate
that leftover chili,

1230
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,782
and then the whole family
left the room screaming?

1231
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:21,450
- Yeah, so?

1232
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:22,451
- Do what you did then.

1233
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,686
It might work.

1234
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,588
- Oh, well, why not?

1235
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:27,289
I have nothing to lose.

1236
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:33,495
- Okay, here I go.

1237
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,498
- Oh, pew.

1238
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,767
What did they feed you, man?
Garbage?

1239
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:39,969
Gross.

1240
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,871
Yuck, yuck, yuck,
yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

1241
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:12,434
- Oh, I remember you,
the dog and the bear.

1242
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,570
Hello, there.

1243
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,405
- Hi, do you know
where Mei Mei is?

1244
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,841
- Oh, Mei Mei's
not here anymore.

1245
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:20,109
She fell asleep,

1246
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,911
the kind where she
will never wake up again.

1247
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:23,712
- Oh, no.

1248
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:26,015
You mean...She died?

1249
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:29,084
That's so sad.

1250
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,120
- She wouldn't want us
to be sad.

1251
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,655
She is at peace now.

1252
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:36,692
- Before she fell asleep,
Mei Mei talked about you.

1253
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,827
She said that you will find
your way back to the farm,

1254
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:39,862
and then you will be home.

1255
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,630
- Farm?

1256
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,766
The only farm I know is the one
that belongs to aunt Zelda,

1257
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,634
but I don't know
how to get there.

1258
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:48,037
It's really far away.

1259
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,471
- When you love somebody,

1260
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,573
there is no such thing
as distance.

1261
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:53,375
Let's go home, aussie.

1262
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:54,543
- All right, then.

1263
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,478
Let's go home.

1264
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,614
Thanks,
and sorry about Mei Mei.

1265
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:02,518
- Good luck.

1266
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,386
- We drove around
for over two hours,

1267
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,521
and I talked
to all the neighbors.

1268
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:06,822
Nobody's seen him.

1269
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:08,857
- And we put up
some more signs too, mom.

1270
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,893
- Well, I still feel like
we're going to find them, guys.

1271
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:12,094
- Me too.

1272
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,662
- Me three.

1273
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:14,763
- Me four.

1274
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:15,898
- Bye, mommy.
I love you.

1275
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:17,499
- Bye-bye,
- bye, love you.

1276
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,539
- I can't find anything in here.

1277
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:26,108
- And there's rain
in the forecast.

1278
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,676
These and other stories...

1279
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:28,310
- It sure does feel different
in this house

1280
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,780
without aunt Zelda around.

1281
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,183
- Hey, dad,
can I be in charge of the goats?

1282
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:36,518
- I want to be in charge
of the goats.

1283
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,120
- You can both be in charge
of the goats.

1284
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,922
- Works for me.

1285
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,990
- Rescuer who braved the flames
to bring out a loved one...

1286
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,192
- Honey, honey, come here.

1287
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,194
Quick, take look at this.

1288
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,730
- Henry, we're here at the scene
of a local house fire

1289
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,498
that broke out earlier today.

1290
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,366
Now, as we were reporting
on that fire,

1291
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,535
we caught these images
of a dog running

1292
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,204
into the burning building.

1293
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,638
He came out a minute later

1294
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,941
carrying a Teddy bear
in his mouth.

1295
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:00,175
Apparently,
this brave little dog

1296
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,911
really loves his bear.

1297
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:05,080
At this hour,
the identity of the dog

1298
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:06,915
remains a mystery.

1299
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,484
- In other news,

1300
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:09,551

Ain't a fit night out

Reckon we better find someplace
to tuck in for the night.

01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:27,469
Oh, look at that poor man.

1307
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:30,005
He seems like he needs a friend.

1308
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:37,179
- We could use a friend too,
couldn't we, mate?

1309
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:40,883
- Well, what have we got here?

1310
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:46,121
Oh, good dog.

01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:50,659
Mmm.

- Hey, Ted,
you think he lives here?

1313
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:57,666
- I'm afraid so, aussie.

1314
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:02,504
- Mm-hmm, yeah, okay,
I understand.

1315
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:03,872
Hey, thank you very much
for taking my call.

Okay, bye-bye.

1317
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,546
- Well, the fire station
has no idea where aussie is.

1318
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:12,114
They say he just ran off,
but he didn't seem hurt.

1319
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,949
He was just fine, okay?

1320
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:15,117
And Ted seemed like he
was just fine too, sweetheart.

1321
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,753
- He rescued Ted.

1322
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,188
Pretty smart thing
for him to do, huh, Eric?

1323
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:22,257
Aussie's a genius.

1324
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,727
- Whatever.
I told you it wasn't my fault.

1325
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,696
- Well, all we can do is hope
that somebody recognizes him.

1326
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:29,164
- Wait,
or maybe the bear will send

1327
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:31,200
a telepathic message to Laney.

1328
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,001

that right now,

Somebody over there
read my novel.

They love it; They want me to do

- Ewww.

1390
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,370
- Oh, that's nasty.

1391
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:00,442
- I smell horses.

1392
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,378
This way.

1393
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,330
- That's right, Henry,
a couple of days ago,

1394
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,167
we aired a story about
an adorable little dog

1395
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,936
who saved a Teddy bear
from a burning house.

1396
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:30,372
Well, we did
some investigative reporting

1397
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,307
and tracked down the owners
of that dog.

1398
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,776
They told us his name is aussie

1399
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:35,777
and that's he's been missing
for several days.

1400
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:40,482
Channel one is now offering
a $5,000 reward

1401
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:43,552
for any information leading
to the safe return of aussie.

1402
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:46,254
- Maybe that horse
will know something.

1403
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:49,891
G'day, mate.

1404
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,359
Lovely day, isn't it?

1405
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,561
- Hmph.

1406
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,430
- So I'm looking
for my human family.

1407
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,866
I think they're visiting
a farm around here somewhere.

1408
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:01,136
I have a mom and a dad
and a sister and a brother.

1409
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,971
- Mm, I heard
those pigeons over there

1410
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:05,140
talking about
a new human family.

1411
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:07,976
- They just moved to a farm
across the old wooden bridge.

1412
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:10,479
- Word out in the field is,
the mother's a bit cuckoo.

1413
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:14,416
- Likes to swim in the mud
with the pigs.

1414
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:16,985
- Hm, can't be my family.

1415
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,987
My mom doesn't like mud or pigs,

1416
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,956
and I seriously doubt
she can swim.

1417
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:21,990
Thanks, anyway.

1418
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,291
- Mm-hmm.

1419
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,293
- Yep, yep, yep.

Gary, you know that dog
they're looking for on TV,

the one with the reward?

1426
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,482
- I don't think he wants
to help us, Ted.

1427
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:50,352
- Trust your heart, aussie,
and fast.
