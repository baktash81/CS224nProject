00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:04,429
<i>Building of the Old Summer
Palace started in 1709.</i>

2
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,648
<i>Took more than 150 years to complete.</i>

3
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:09,061
<i>Its magnificence awed the world.</i>

4
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:11,558
<i>Envoys called it The Garden of Gardens.</i>

5
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:15,642
<i>Haiyan Hall was its
largest Western mansion,</i>

6
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:19,142
<i>where the 12 Chinese Zodiac statues stood,</i>

7
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:21,982
<i>each majestically spouting water at noon!</i>

8
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:27,021
<i>Foreign armies breached
Fort Dagu in July 1860,</i>

9
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,888
<i>shattered the Empire's feeble defense.</i>

10
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:32,847
<i>On 6th October 1860,</i>

11
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:35,314
<i>the invaders stormed Old Summer Palace.</i>

12
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:39,355
<i>Imperial treasures including
the 12 bronze statues</i>

13
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:42,725
<i>were pillaged or burned.</i>

14
00:01:42,857 --> 00:01:46,054
<i>The fire lasted for three nights and days.</i>

15
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,728
<i>This 150-year-old architectural masterpiece</i>

16
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:50,939
<i>was razed to the ground.</i>

17
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,979
<i>One, two, three!</i>

18
00:01:57,357 --> 00:02:00,725
Going once, going twice,

19
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:01,722
Sold!

20
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:02,938
Next item.

21
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:18,139
A case of 24 bottles of
Chinese Maotai perfectly preserved,

22
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:21,471
forgotten in a farm
cellar for over 55 years.

23
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,019
Maotai's starting bid: 2 million euros,

24
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:26,561
bids in increments of 100,000.

25
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,682
Ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,308
there are only four in the world.

27
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,314
The Chinese ambassador.

28
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:45,727
A pleasure to meet you.

29
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:47,939
Please forgive my lateness, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,979
We should be the ones to
ask your forgiveness.

31
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:52,268
Take a look at the edges.

32
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:55,437
All those years ago, because of the war,

33
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:59,355
my ancestors brought back things
that did not belong to them.

34
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:02,315
And every time I look at that bronze,

35
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,640
I feel guilty.

36
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:08,270
It's part of the common
heritage of mankind.

37
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:11,687
It shouldn't belong to
one or two individuals.

38
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,980
That's why I chose
to donate it to a Chinese museum.

39
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:17,597
Sir it's my humble opinion,

40
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:19,564
that if everybody thinks like you,

41
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:22,149
the world would be a
better place to live in.

42
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:24,598
I wish you every success

43
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:28,396
in tracking down the rest
of the bronze heads.

44
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:30,310
8.8,

45
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:31,806
and sold!

46
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:33,938
7 million!

47
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,147
Sold!

48
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:36,395
Congratulations, Mr. Morgan.

49
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,814
MP Corporation is now the proud owner
of the world's four rarest stamps

50
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:40,682
You're wrong. Not four.

51
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:42,272
Now,

52
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:46,517
there is only one in the world!

53
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,891
Hey! Check it out!
MP Corporation is all over the news today.

54
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,014
The boss is back.

55
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,311
It's the only one of its kind left.

56
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:58,433
Its values go triple overnight.

57
00:03:58,566 --> 00:03:59,522
Father's idea.

58
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:00,514
Genius!

59
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:03,266
You want a priceless antique?
I'll make it for you.

60
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,230
Next!

61
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:07,145
Percy's called, questioning our painting
Morning Light.

62
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:08,139
Questioning?

63
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:09,994
Well then, they don't even know to do that.

64
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:13,600
Buy it back, like we always do,
for an elevated price.

65
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:16,269
Because fake things tend
to become more real

66
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,811
once they've been bought
and sold a few times

67
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:19,726
Next!

68
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:22,770
The 5th bronze head did very well.
It was a surprise to us.

69
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:26,346
Recent buyers this auction season
were all businessmen

70
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,644
who just love their country.

71
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:32,221
That's because they'll do anything
for their own relics.

72
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,974
Their patriotism equals our profit.

73
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,063
Genius!

74
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,556
These bronzes,

75
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:40,558
each one higher than the last.

76
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:43,149
How am I going to get my hands
on those bad boys?

77
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:45,265
Names, give me names. Throw out names.

78
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,639
Let's get the Vulture.

79
00:04:46,774 --> 00:04:48,811
Feels like it should be
someone closer to home.

80
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:50,397
What about JC?

81
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,561
He hasn't even found the
Roses painting yet.

82
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,433
Roses? Don't worry about the Roses.

83
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,148
You tell JC,

84
00:04:57,274 --> 00:04:59,561
if he can get me all the remaining heads,

85
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:01,728
there's a massive bonus in it for him.

86
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:03,689
As long as the money's right,

87
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,727
JC will get you anything.

88
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:09,975
You tell him it's one million euros each.

89
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:12,064
If he gets us the dragon as well,

90
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:13,431
I'll add another zero.

91
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:14,556
Genius!

92
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,481
Your car cannot pass!

93
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:28,514
I want to pee.

94
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:29,889
She's gorgeous!

95
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:31,059
Please.

96
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,063
Come this way.

97
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:34,431
Thank you.

98
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:39,731
Dad, that's brilliant.

99
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,393
You know, it's the Year of the Dragon.

100
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:44,124
- We're going to make a fortune.
- Go fool around with your girls!

101
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:18,931
You go find JC, then

102
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,227
No problem, I'll find him.

103
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:22,018
Right, where is he now?

104
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,106
He's probably on vacation.

105
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:26,439
What's going on?

106
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,977
I don't get this.

107
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,347
What happened?

108
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:32,224
There's a breach. Be alert!

109
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:42,810
What is it?

110
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:44,643
Someone has broken in!

111
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:45,855
What's going on?

112
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:47,268
Stop him!

113
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:59,314
Stop or we will shoot!

114
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:00,897
Get him!

115
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,142
There's a breach, don't let him get away!

116
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:06,264
Where are the keys?

117
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:11,598
Get him!

118
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,688
This way!

119
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:20,064
He's under the car, get him!

120
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,181
He's here!

121
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:28,268
He's here!

122
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,306
Get him!

123
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:41,556
Shoot!

124
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:46,767
Hurry!

125
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:31,898
I can't see him. Can he out-race us?

126
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,641
I can see our cars but nothing else.

127
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,690
Where is he? I thought you'd cut him off.

128
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:48,392
What is this?

129
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:50,389
Get him!

130
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,268
What's that?

131
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:18,809
He is there!

132
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:57,980
Oh my poor backside!

133
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:27,147
Shoot!

134
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,140
JC, okay?

135
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:55,063
Go!

136
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:57,435
Let's go.

137
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:01,268
Hello?

138
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,390
JC, it's Jonathan.

139
00:11:03,982 --> 00:11:05,393
Did you find the Roses?

140
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:06,685
I am on vacation.

141
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,932
I have a new assignment. Interested?

142
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,306
How much do you pay?

143
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,978
You know the 12 bronze heads
from Old Summer Palace?

144
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,347
Chinese Zodiac?

145
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:19,605
Chinese Zodiac

146
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:25,772
<i>Professor Guan.</i>

147
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,765
<i>Martin is from National Geographic Channel.</i>

148
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:28,820
<i>This is Professor Guan.</i>

149
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,435
<i>How are you, sir? How do you do?</i>

150
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:34,013
National Geographic Channel
is very respectable.

151
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:37,517
We need plenty of support for our work.

152
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:38,764
Especially

153
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,891
support from credible media like yours.

154
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:45,016
We're doing a feature
on the 12 bronze heads.

155
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,389
You are an expert on them.

156
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:48,390
So we're here to learn from you.

157
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,014
The pyramids of Egypt,

158
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,356
the Parthenon of Greece,

159
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:54,143
and Cambodia's Angkor Wat,

160
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:56,766
are just like China's Old Summer Palace,

161
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:58,856
where numerous treasures and relics

162
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:01,940
were pillaged, destroyed, and stolen.

163
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:04,023
How are you, sir? Good day, all.

164
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,311
These students are from all over the world.

165
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:08,933
<i>They've been working here for years,</i>

166
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:11,854
<i>repatriating relics to their own countries.</i>

167
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,565
<i>We need everyone to work hard.</i>

168
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,854
<i>It takes centuries to create a miracle,</i>

169
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:21,350
<i>but a bomb or fire can
destroy it in an instant.</i>

170
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:23,849
<i>After much detailed research,</i>

171
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:28,020
we came up with almost exact replicas.

172
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:32,059
You are the first reporter to see them.

173
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:34,097
No pictures!

174
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,389
Sorry.

175
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:37,889
Five of them have been auctioned.

176
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,389
What about the rest?

177
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:42,721
There are rumors of their whereabouts.

178
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:44,723
One of my students in Paris,

179
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:47,474
she's an expert in antiquity,

180
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:51,475
has recently examined two auctioned heads.

181
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:52,972
Which two?

182
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,472
Rabbit-head,

183
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,189
and this Rat-head.

184
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:59,311
Can I get in touch with her?

185
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:01,640
I'll contact her for you now.

186
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:03,230
Thanks.

187
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:05,563
Can I touch them?

188
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:06,806
Certainly.

189
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:08,397
Thanks.

190
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,056
No need to be so serious!

191
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,807
I must, I must

192
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:27,847
It's coming.

193
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,727
The Rat-head is finished.

194
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:12,972
Is it very valuable?

195
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,848
Depends on what you think is valuable.

196
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:17,144
For 1O euros, you can have them both.

197
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,313
This is your document.

198
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,522
Welcome to Paris!

199
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:21,980
Thank you.

200
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:42,564
We are here for peace.

201
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:43,897
Peace! Peace in your heart!

202
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,014
Peace!

203
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,355
Everybody! Okay?

204
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:48,519
We will voice our concerns peacefully.

205
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:50,267
You sure it is here?

206
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,855
According to the GPS

207
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,602
Then wait here.

208
00:14:56,524 --> 00:14:57,935
Paris!

209
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,306
What?

210
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,772
Are you kidding?

211
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:01,809
It's your size! It's not your size!

212
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:03,932
If it's not,
it was the seller who made a mistake.

213
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,602
Get lost!

214
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,848
It's over between us!

215
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:10,564
No! It's not over! I love you, Coco!

216
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:11,396
I love you.

217
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:12,605
Love

218
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:14,018
Love my ass!

219
00:15:14,774 --> 00:15:15,980
Okay! Okay!

220
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,973
If that's how it is, give me back my keys!

221
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:20,601
Who are you?

222
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:22,230
Who are you?

223
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:23,347
Professor Guan sent me.

224
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:24,563
Just wait!

225
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,557
Who's this fellow? Your new boyfriend?

226
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:28,647
Yes!

227
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:30,685
Thank you for catching.

228
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:32,256
You're welcome. You don't have keys?

229
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,481
She says it's over between us.
I just want my set of keys back

230
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:36,348
so I can give it to another girlfriend.

231
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:40,228
Sorry. I missed

232
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,935
You missed...

233
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:48,064
Let's go. Hurry up.

234
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:50,813
You are Shangguan Ma-ding?

235
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,556
Yes.

236
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:53,977
But my research told me...

237
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:56,644
Shangguan Ma-ding has passed away.

238
00:15:56,774 --> 00:15:59,266
That was my cousin. I am Martin Shangguan.

239
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,389
Oh, really?

240
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:02,722
Follow me, then.

241
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,355
Boys and girls,

242
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:08,144
Martin is from National Geographic Channel.

243
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:12,222
He is here to do a feature
on the bronze heads.

244
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:14,806
We need all the help we can get

245
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,898
from mainstream media like
National Geographic Channel.

246
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:18,560
I'll do my best.

247
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:21,183
A common goal among us young people

248
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:23,808
is to retrieve lost relics
for various countries.

249
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,649
Of course, they include
the 12 bronze heads.

250
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,937
These are the two in France?

251
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:31,680
Yes.

252
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:33,773
They belong to Count Marceau.

253
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:34,980
I examined them.

254
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:36,689
Professor Guan verified their data.

255
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:37,772
They're authentic.

256
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,139
He lives in that chateau?

257
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,514
Sorry!

258
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,477
Occupational habit.

259
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:44,188
Guys!

260
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:45,056
Over here.

261
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:46,556
What's going on?

262
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:47,852
What's wrong, guys'?

263
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:50,189
I was walking with Wu Qing,
we were keeping surveillance on a cargo

264
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,356
No battery no memory card.

265
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:52,563
Which we suspect of being stolen antiques.

266
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:55,308
Suddenly,
all these guys started beating us up!

267
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:57,682
They only stopped
when I tried to call the police.

268
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:58,726
It's too risky.

269
00:16:58,857 --> 00:17:00,518
I've told you many times,
we only protest in peace.

270
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:01,609
Why didn't you stop him?

271
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:02,852
No, listen...

272
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:04,518
No, guys. Listen to me.

273
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:08,313
I'd like to remind all of you about
the principles of our organization.

274
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,773
One, we don't give the police any trouble.

275
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:13,436
Two, we don't interfere
in the lives of the people.

276
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,888
And three, we don't disturb social order.

277
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:18,310
Absolutely!

278
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:19,476
You have my support.

279
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,689
Producer from National Geographic Channel.

280
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:23,726
- Reporter?
- Yes.

281
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:24,767
- Chinese?
- Yes.

282
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:26,264
You must help us to expose MP's crime,

283
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:27,434
make them look bad!

284
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:29,898
No. As media, we can only report the facts.

285
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:32,857
We cannot exaggerate and make things up.

286
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:34,017
I have taken photos.

287
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:35,639
You sit down!

288
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:36,980
Be careful.

289
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:39,018
I'm sorry this happened
on your first visit.

290
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:41,436
We've got nothing else for you, goodbye.

291
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,230
Can I have a word with you?

292
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:44,347
Sure.

293
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,514
Over here

294
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:49,480
What's the matter?

295
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:52,144
These people, these big corporations

296
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:54,481
You and your students must...

297
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,564
Okay, thanks, stay in touch!

298
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:57,647
What on earth?

299
00:17:58,107 --> 00:17:59,028
He'll crack their code.

300
00:17:59,107 --> 00:17:59,391
Sure.

301
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:01,106
When the time comes, I might be there.

302
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:02,722
You're responsible for my getaway.

303
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:04,894
The Chateau's landscape is flat.

304
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,345
There is only one low-lying area.

305
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:08,307
You meet me at the low-lying area.

306
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:14,730
Follow me.

307
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:42,849
Monsieur Pierre, during
our phone conversation,

308
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:45,599
you said you wanted more information
about our bronze heads.

309
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:47,222
We've brought you this portfolio.

310
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,473
I'm sure you'll find everything inside.

311
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:52,679
Madam, I beg you to pick up the phone!

312
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:55,932
Are you sure of their authenticity?

313
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:57,397
Yes, of course.

314
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,811
Indeed, there are many replicas
on the market now.

315
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:02,524
Even experienced collectors
have been fooled.

316
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:04,765
If you have doubts,
you're free to test them.

317
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,060
Okay, let me keep the book.

318
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:07,022
I will contact you soon.

319
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,560
Call me back.

320
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:14,228
He used his hands to
flip through the album.

321
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:17,682
I think he's heading to the vault.

322
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:20,353
Their surveillance systems
are installed outside,

323
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:22,314
for fear of damaging the relics.

324
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:23,601
It seems that we are spot on,

325
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:25,932
the owner is obsessed with tidiness!

326
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,522
Just like you: A mysophobic!

327
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,014
Now we can only wait.

328
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:30,605
Let's wait, then.

329
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,064
They're all seeing their boss off.

330
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,431
I am watching.

331
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:42,682
Tell me when you are ready.

332
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:45,480
We are ready!

333
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,181
In five seconds

334
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:37,014
I can see the fingerprints.

335
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:41,604
Hurry up.

336
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:43,348
They're coming back.

337
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:50,564
Found it! It's behind the bookshelf.

338
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:15,477
Same old trick.

339
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:23,017
Damn it!

340
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:23,889
What's wrong?

341
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:27,437
Three sets of combination
of 46 letters each!

342
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,648
It'll take eight computers two days
to crack it.

343
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:56,522
Weird!

344
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,356
What has the boss been up to?

345
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:08,688
Why would one obsessed

346
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:11,103
with tidiness misplace his books?

347
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,561
Should be put..

348
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,431
Here.

349
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:27,648
Here.

350
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:33,898
That's how he reminds himself
of the combinations!

351
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:35,731
Marion.

352
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:36,642
Yes, sir?

353
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:38,060
Some coffee, please.

354
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,932
Very good, sir.

355
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,932
- Let's go.
- Okay.

356
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:51,764
I know how to open it.

357
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:16,056
It's opened.

358
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:29,347
Found the bronze heads yet?

359
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:33,352
Give me a minute.

360
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:43,642
The Rat-head,

361
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:47,976
the Rabbit-head.

362
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:49,814
Do they look like our replicas?

363
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:52,973
To me... they're all the same.

364
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:56,557
Is there anything else worth taking?

365
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:05,097
They're all junk!

366
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:09,017
You know what I've just seen?

367
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:10,355
What?

368
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,894
The Pharaoh's scepter and
the Czarina's staff,

369
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:14,310
the Golden Eagle Box,

370
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:15,852
and the Star of Arabia!

371
00:24:15,982 --> 00:24:17,973
They're all lost national relics!

372
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:20,644
Now, they belong to us.

373
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,230
Guess what else I've found?

374
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,392
What?

375
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:49,516
A painting that we dreamt of stealing.

376
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:51,855
The Roses?

377
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:53,393
Bingo!

378
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:03,648
I've been looking all over for you,

379
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:05,731
Now you show up by yourself.

380
00:25:06,524 --> 00:25:08,231
Lucky me.

381
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:12,974
Just look at this photo.

382
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:16,557
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

383
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:18,398
Who are you?

384
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:19,764
What are you doing?

385
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:21,981
Guards!

386
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:23,313
<i>Hey! Stop!</i>

387
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,602
<i>We've a situation!</i>

388
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,231
<i>He's upstairs! Go get him!</i>

389
00:25:27,357 --> 00:25:28,813
They saw me!

390
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:33,480
What's going on?

391
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:38,417
I am still inside, being chased by dogs.

392
00:25:38,524 --> 00:25:39,810
Give me directions!

393
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:48,014
There he is!

394
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:06,273
Look! He is on the roof!

395
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,685
Go get him!

396
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,306
Go that way.

397
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:30,806
Catch me if you can!

398
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:32,438
More of the same?

399
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,102
I'm southeast of the chateau,

400
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,722
tell me where to go!

401
00:26:54,732 --> 00:26:55,517
There's a maze ahead of you,

402
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:56,980
stay out of it!

403
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:01,522
I think I'm already in it!

404
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:02,730
Can you take the high road?

405
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,018
No room for a take-off!

406
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:05,514
I've to give it a try.

407
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:10,774
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

408
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,352
I'm coming your way!

409
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,227
<i>It's no time for nursery rhymes!</i>

410
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:19,894
Cut the crap and find me an exit!

411
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:22,436
<i>We can't see you unless you're airborne!</i>

412
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:47,688
They stopped?

413
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,727
Maybe they are short-sighted

414
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,481
There he is! He's airborne!

415
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:17,605
He's gone down again!

416
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:18,847
The runway is too short!

417
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:26,810
It's a dead end!

418
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:41,764
What's that noise?

419
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:43,060
I am mimicking a dog!

420
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:04,310
Want a bite?

421
00:29:05,316 --> 00:29:06,806
Lie down!

422
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:07,976
Nice!

423
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:09,931
Nice dog.

424
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:11,682
Stay put!

425
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,056
Good doggie.

426
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:13,805
Beat it!

427
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:17,978
Speaking Chinese to a French dog?

428
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,936
I'm surprised he could understand.

429
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:39,438
We'll call you later.

430
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:40,397
Okay.

431
00:29:40,524 --> 00:29:42,140
Guards

432
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:43,730
<i>Go check it out right now!</i>

433
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:50,730
I am out, finally!

434
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:53,307
Call Simon and tell him to handle the rest.

435
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:55,978
You do it. We're not on speaking terms.

436
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:09,230
Martin?

437
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:15,847
Martin!

438
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:17,813
What are you doing?

439
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,022
Do I know you?

440
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:20,765
Was that you in the chateau?

441
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:23,140
Coco, it was someone else.

442
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:24,105
Someone else?

443
00:30:24,232 --> 00:30:25,563
You can address me by name!

444
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,226
It was you!

445
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,768
Watch out!

446
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,264
It was you!

447
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,015
Let go me!

448
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:38,139
How could you steal?

449
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:39,856
I don't know what you're talking about.

450
00:30:39,982 --> 00:30:41,462
We've been had! They knew each other!

451
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:42,472
Good Lord!

452
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,563
Go!

453
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:44,647
Let go of me,

454
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:45,605
and drive carefully!

455
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:46,847
Are you still in denial?

456
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:47,892
Okay, it was me.

457
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:49,560
Why did you do that?

458
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:51,602
This is not the time to explain.

459
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,431
Watch out!

460
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:09,889
You alright?

461
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:11,480
I'll meet you at the boat house.

462
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:24,474
Simon, I'm at your 6 o'clock,
9 o'clock above!

463
00:31:47,941 --> 00:31:48,851
Perfect!

464
00:31:51,024 --> 00:31:51,513
Where is the other head?

465
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:52,935
Coco's got it.

466
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,935
You're no reporter. Who are you really?

467
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:00,771
Me?

468
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,515
I have double identities.

469
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:05,391
I am president of the non-profit making

470
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,014
International Foundation of Relics...

471
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:09,060
Metals, Porcelain and Paintings

472
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:09,805
What?

473
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,102
I've never heard of this organization.

474
00:32:11,232 --> 00:32:13,143
You know every one by heart?

475
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:14,810
What should we do with this head?

476
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:16,852
Return it to the Chinese government.

477
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:18,017
Good idea!

478
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,268
<i>Be careful, guys. Let's go!</i>

479
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,764
<i>It's here! Let's go!</i>

480
00:32:25,024 --> 00:32:27,061
<i>Go, go! Let's go!</i>

481
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:33,806
Hello.

482
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:42,814
Oh, no. Not this.

483
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:44,898
Hello, is this the police?

484
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:07,847
What's going on?

485
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:09,268
Don't come out!

486
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:12,772
My power cable!

487
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:26,893
Police! Don't move!

488
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:29,768
Police! Police! Don't move!

489
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:36,348
I swear that they are accomplices!

490
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:37,688
It's not true!

491
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,352
The Marceau family's
reputation is impeccable.

492
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:41,598
Impeccable reputation?

493
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:44,394
We've watched these tapes,

494
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:45,730
and we saw nothing.

495
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,189
There are customs documents,

496
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:51,513
and a witness who saw
nothing at the chateau.

497
00:33:51,857 --> 00:33:54,474
She was estranged
after her uncle rejected a loan request.

498
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:56,393
No, I was three when I last visited him.

499
00:33:56,524 --> 00:33:57,845
Do you really think I'd remember?

500
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:59,890
- I swear to God that..
- Shut up!

501
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:03,770
We will keep the statue for two weeks.

502
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:05,435
If no one claims it,

503
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:06,806
you can have it back.

504
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:08,397
If they bother you again,

505
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:09,685
let us know.

506
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:11,727
Now, you are free to go.

507
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:12,437
Thank you.

508
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:14,432
- But that's not true!
- Shut up!

509
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:15,522
I swear they stole the heads!

510
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:17,686
You've other things to worry about!

511
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:19,022
How did it go?

512
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:20,856
Everything went as expected.

513
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:25,063
I still want to thank

514
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:27,228
this honest and beautiful
citizen of France.

515
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,598
You're welcome. All I
did was tell the truth.

516
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:31,268
My name is Catherine.

517
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:33,766
You seem interested in those bronze heads.

518
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:37,187
I have something at my house
you might be interested in.

519
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:38,681
Well, think about it.

520
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:39,931
Drive on, Bruno.

521
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:41,227
Chateau Sichel.

522
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:43,723
We've always wanted to visit this chateau.

523
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:46,397
Welcome! I'm sorry.

524
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:48,561
There are some routine
security measures here.

525
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:51,103
The bank has taken
possession of everything.

526
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:53,564
Nothing of value is
permitted to be taken out.

527
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,647
It's okay.

528
00:34:54,774 --> 00:34:55,684
Beautiful castle!

529
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:57,272
Please, follow me.

530
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:04,892
Follow them.

531
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:08,937
Our family went bankrupt
in the financial crisis.

532
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,683
Still nice to be able to live here.

533
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:13,147
Thank you.

534
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:16,182
Your ancestors may have been

535
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:19,479
the last people to see
these beautiful creatures.

536
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:21,769
Yes, I know what you mean.

537
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:25,563
Thing are only treasured
after they've disappeared.

538
00:35:25,982 --> 00:35:28,098
Yeah, you are right!

539
00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:33,222
Rooster?

540
00:35:33,357 --> 00:35:35,268
It's the reason I invited you here.

541
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,764
Is that real?

542
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:38,936
It's been here since I was born.

543
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:42,148
This is stolen property, right?

544
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:43,639
What did she say?

545
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:46,936
She said beautiful staircase.

546
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,477
Thank you.

547
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,563
Let's go.

548
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:54,641
This is my great-great-grandfather,

549
00:35:54,774 --> 00:35:56,185
her grandfather.

550
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,773
Years ago he came back from overseas.

551
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:02,437
He always wanted to set sail again
to find his second command

552
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:05,274
but never had the funds to do so.

553
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:08,312
Later his son, my grandma's father,

554
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:09,681
put together an expedition

555
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:12,478
and went to sea in search
of the Indestructible.

556
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:13,688
But he never returned.

557
00:36:13,816 --> 00:36:15,853
He just disappeared mysteriously.

558
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:18,440
I heard you have the animals' heads.

559
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:22,605
Maybe you would have clues
about my great-grandfather?

560
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,183
I don't give a damn!

561
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:30,274
Bronze heads, scepter, diamond

562
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,140
they can never be made public.

563
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,313
The one I really want back is the painting.

564
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,853
The value of what they've stolen
is over a billion dollars!

565
00:36:36,982 --> 00:36:40,100
If you'd installed an infrared security
system, things would have been

566
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:41,153
So it's my fault, then?

567
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:42,184
No, no, no...

568
00:36:42,316 --> 00:36:43,522
I'll make you a promise.

569
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:45,686
If you don't recover that painting,

570
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:47,682
I will strangle you myself!

571
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:57,607
It's a rocking horse I
had when I was a child.

572
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:04,473
My great-great grandfather painted this
after his return.

573
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:08,805
It's the view he saw after
his ship was damaged.

574
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:11,649
Why don't you have a look around?
I'll go get some tea.

575
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:12,935
Thank you.

576
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:16,767
Over there.

577
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:20,689
Sorry, we need to talk in private.

578
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,726
How can we steal the Rooster-head?

579
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:26,770
Best is to stay here for
2 days, steal and go.

580
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:27,513
<i>Not possible.</i>

581
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:29,265
<i>At least replace it with a replica.</i>

582
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,639
<i>But we need data to produce a replica.</i>

583
00:37:30,774 --> 00:37:32,139
Professor Guan has them.

584
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:33,480
Talk to Coco.

585
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:36,765
Never mention steal in front of her,

586
00:37:36,899 --> 00:37:38,185
otherwise she won't help.

587
00:37:38,316 --> 00:37:39,522
What should we do?

588
00:37:40,816 --> 00:37:42,056
Guys, look!

589
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:44,936
Castiglione's Emperor
Qianlong's Autumn Hunt!

590
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:45,726
Is it valuable?

591
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:46,767
All antiquities are valuable.

592
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:48,515
My granny's chamber pot
must be priceless, too!

593
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:50,014
So this painting does exist!

594
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:51,856
I thought it was destroyed in a fire.

595
00:37:52,857 --> 00:37:53,892
In 1860,

596
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:57,722
my great-great grandfather sailed to China

597
00:37:57,857 --> 00:38:00,975
on Indestructible and won a great victory.

598
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:03,849
This was one of the spoils of war
he brought back.

599
00:38:04,857 --> 00:38:08,304
You must mean
the ransacking of Old Summer Palace.

600
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:11,513
That was during the Second
Opium War, remember?

601
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:13,390
That depends on your point of view.

602
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:15,472
Yes, she is right.

603
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,894
The killing of British and French diplomats

604
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:21,562
by the corrupt Qing Dynasty
was an excuse to start the war.

605
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:26,561
Is that a legitimate reason for two
industrialized nations to invade country?

606
00:38:26,691 --> 00:38:28,451
In the eyes of those
industrialized nations,

607
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:30,265
China was a superpower.

608
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:34,097
True, we even called
ourselves Celestial Kingdom

609
00:38:34,232 --> 00:38:35,438
Whose side are you on?

610
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,560
Yours, of course.

611
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:38,681
Then?

612
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,102
Sorry?

613
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:41,688
What's next?

614
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:44,148
On the way back, they met a storm,

615
00:38:44,274 --> 00:38:45,810
and the ship was damaged.

616
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:48,399
I bet it was overladen with loot.

617
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:50,185
Served them right.

618
00:38:50,316 --> 00:38:51,021
What did she say?

619
00:38:51,149 --> 00:38:52,935
Could you speak in English?

620
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:55,023
I don't speak English.

621
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:57,640
She said that's unfortunate

622
00:38:57,774 --> 00:38:59,981
I didn't say it was unfortunate.

623
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:01,973
I said it served him right!

624
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:03,597
Served him right?

625
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,769
What a cruel thing to say!

626
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:09,062
He went to China on orders of his country.

627
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:11,728
It was his duty as a soldier.

628
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:15,225
Fortunately, he was picked up
by a passing Chinese ship.

629
00:39:15,357 --> 00:39:17,974
The God of Justice must be blind!

630
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,268
What did you say?

631
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,640
She said thank goodness he came back.

632
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:23,390
That's obviously not what she said.

633
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:26,141
But, thank you all the same.

634
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:28,481
You're welcome.

635
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:30,563
What are you doing?

636
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:32,648
I'm taking it back to China!

637
00:39:32,774 --> 00:39:33,764
This is my home,

638
00:39:33,899 --> 00:39:35,731
you can't just take anything you want!

639
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:37,768
Just like over a hundred years ago,

640
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:41,142
your ancestors didn't ask for permission
before taking this

641
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:42,726
Coco

642
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,222
Coco

643
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:50,348
These things happened so long ago.

644
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:53,395
Back then, if a woman
wore too little clothes,

645
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,731
someone might throw a stone at you,

646
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:58,144
no, at her.

647
00:39:58,691 --> 00:39:59,931
Oh, sorry.

648
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:01,147
Sorry for what?

649
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,560
Don't be a bleeding heart.

650
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,648
She should be the one apologizing.

651
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:06,060
What did she say?

652
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:07,727
Did she say something?

653
00:40:08,316 --> 00:40:10,148
I don't need you to translate.

654
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,398
Did you all forget?

655
00:40:12,524 --> 00:40:14,731
They came to our country a century ago,

656
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:17,724
burned, raped, murdered and pillaged.

657
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:20,440
Over a century ago,

658
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:23,479
you came to our country to rape,

659
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:25,644
pillage and murder.

660
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:27,105
Even a hundred years later,

661
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:30,224
these memories still hurt the Chinese!

662
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:34,480
It's true.

663
00:40:35,024 --> 00:40:38,892
I studied history. Whatever the excuses

664
00:40:39,024 --> 00:40:40,435
I studied history.

665
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,807
Whatever the excuses used,

666
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,182
these things did indeed happen.

667
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:50,310
Sometimes we can only explain
such things with invalid reasons, such as

668
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:54,058
That was an era in which might makes right.

669
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:56,182
We cannot use today's civilized standards

670
00:40:56,316 --> 00:40:58,353
to judge the mistakes of the past.

671
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:00,940
Even now, it's the strong
who comes up on top.

672
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:04,388
You must have power
before others will reason with you.

673
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:07,141
Never mind. I'm beginning
to understand her point of view.

674
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:10,018
Sorry.

675
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:13,690
Anyway, all of this now
belongs to the bank.

676
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:15,102
They're worthless to me.

677
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:16,973
I'd give them to you if I could.

678
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,018
Didn't you want to visit this castle?

679
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:20,230
Now that we are here,

680
00:41:20,357 --> 00:41:21,939
let's stay for a couple of days.

681
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:23,602
Come on, have some tea.

682
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,938
Since you're so fond of each other,

683
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,648
have fun yourselves!

684
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:29,810
She is going to the bathroom.

685
00:41:38,982 --> 00:41:39,482
What is it?

686
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:40,768
Come take a look.

687
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:47,890
- Catherine!
- Yes?

688
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:50,561
Your great grandfather, the ship...

689
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,773
did it sink, or was it grounded?

690
00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:54,481
Who knows?

691
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:57,770
You know what? We're interested

692
00:41:57,899 --> 00:42:00,687
about recovering your great grandfather.

693
00:42:00,816 --> 00:42:02,602
If we stay another couple of days,

694
00:42:02,732 --> 00:42:04,814
start an investigation, more information,

695
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:05,726
we might be able to help.

696
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,313
Thank you so much! It's wonderful.

697
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,602
We have plenty of rooms here.

698
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:10,053
You can stay as long as you wish.

699
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:11,184
I'm going to make the preparation.

700
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:12,852
But he may not be alive.

701
00:42:12,982 --> 00:42:14,347
It's okay.

702
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:16,556
Coco.

703
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:19,518
Thank you. I will call you later.

704
00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:20,764
Thanks for your help.

705
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:22,014
Thank you.

706
00:42:22,149 --> 00:42:24,231
Let's stay and steal the Rooster-head.

707
00:42:24,357 --> 00:42:25,392
No stealing!

708
00:42:25,524 --> 00:42:27,481
As guests here, we mustn't steal.

709
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:29,393
Who says we can't?

710
00:42:29,524 --> 00:42:31,106
They stole from us.

711
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:34,520
We're just retrieving, not stealing.

712
00:42:34,649 --> 00:42:35,309
Good point!

713
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:37,273
We need a replica to do the switch.

714
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:39,731
But we don't have data to make one.

715
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,064
Professor Guan has them.

716
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:42,896
I'll ask him.

717
00:42:43,024 --> 00:42:44,264
Great! Hurry up!

718
00:43:02,816 --> 00:43:03,396
<i>Here!</i>

719
00:43:03,524 --> 00:43:04,514
<i>Data?</i>

720
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:11,601
<i>Hello.</i>

721
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:19,432
<i>Wee wee This way, Madam.</i>

722
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:20,772
<i>Thank you!</i>

723
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,101
<i>Thank you!</i>

724
00:43:40,857 --> 00:43:42,063
<i>Bye!</i>

725
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:50,272
<i>Genius!</i>

726
00:44:19,982 --> 00:44:21,939
<i>What are these fools doing here?</i>

727
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:23,181
<i>Launch picnic?</i>

728
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:26,307
<i>They're now our lunch!</i>

729
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:50,208
<i>Mom and dad, when can we go on holiday?</i>

730
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:52,056
Look!

731
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,890
<i>This is the data captured
by our mini-plane.</i>

732
00:45:04,107 --> 00:45:05,313
How is it?

733
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:23,023
No wonder it's not on the map!

734
00:45:23,816 --> 00:45:25,227
Bingo!

735
00:45:25,357 --> 00:45:27,098
He was here when he drew this.

736
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:28,722
You guys are amazing!

737
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:30,268
No, technology is.

738
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:31,935
What shall we do next?

739
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:33,431
We'll camp here.

740
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:36,231
Voice mail? Oh, forget it

741
00:45:36,899 --> 00:45:37,855
Martin.

742
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:39,848
News said three heads were auctioned.

743
00:45:40,691 --> 00:45:41,476
Impossible!

744
00:45:41,607 --> 00:45:43,644
Why not? I'll show you.

745
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:44,935
No signal.

746
00:45:45,066 --> 00:45:46,101
They must be fakes!

747
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:48,815
We've got the real ones. Right?

748
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:51,182
If fakes could fetch a fortune,

749
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:52,601
how much will the real ones worth?

750
00:45:52,732 --> 00:45:54,188
They must be priceless!

751
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:55,477
And now a word of advice.

752
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:57,518
Don't change with the lights on.

753
00:45:57,649 --> 00:45:58,480
Why not?

754
00:45:58,607 --> 00:45:59,722
Look.

755
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:00,597
Just now I was

756
00:46:00,732 --> 00:46:02,063
I didn't see anything.

757
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:03,935
Honest!

758
00:46:04,691 --> 00:46:06,147
We saw nothing.

759
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:07,764
Don't turn on the satellite receiver.

760
00:46:12,732 --> 00:46:14,143
What? Lizard!

761
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:16,347
It's just a lizard.

762
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,438
Where are you going?

763
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,306
I'm going up.

764
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:19,897
But JC

765
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:22,682
But JC told us not to move.

766
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:23,726
Do as you like.

767
00:46:23,857 --> 00:46:24,847
Wait for me!

768
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:25,482
How long?

769
00:46:25,524 --> 00:46:26,605
NOW!

770
00:46:27,357 --> 00:46:28,347
Look at you.

771
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:30,348
What? It's just my make-up bag!

772
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:31,847
Whatever.

773
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:36,563
What's wrong with you two?

774
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:37,601
Still in a stand-off.

775
00:46:37,732 --> 00:46:41,145
If it is not for my child,
I'd have left him long ago.

776
00:46:41,274 --> 00:46:42,184
What about you?

777
00:46:42,316 --> 00:46:43,716
She is still not answering my call.

778
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:46,057
I was only three days
late for her birthday.

779
00:46:46,191 --> 00:46:47,852
Why so mad about it?

780
00:46:48,941 --> 00:46:50,431
Where are you going?

781
00:46:50,566 --> 00:46:51,852
This way.

782
00:46:51,982 --> 00:46:53,017
How do you know?

783
00:46:53,149 --> 00:46:54,765
Instinct!

784
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:56,685
Whatever.

785
00:46:56,816 --> 00:46:57,396
Oh my god!

786
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:58,355
The trees on this island,

787
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,395
must be kept secret from those lumberjacks.

788
00:47:01,524 --> 00:47:02,645
If not, none will be spared.

789
00:47:02,774 --> 00:47:04,185
Now you're very happy.

790
00:47:04,316 --> 00:47:05,647
Know how hard I've been trying?

791
00:47:05,774 --> 00:47:08,607
Have you considered other options?

792
00:47:08,732 --> 00:47:10,723
No one could tolerate her tantrum!

793
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:12,268
See who leaves first.

794
00:47:13,066 --> 00:47:15,558
What's with Valentine's Day and the rest?

795
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:16,396
Where did they come from?

796
00:47:16,524 --> 00:47:18,356
Does it matter whose idea they were?

797
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:19,313
It's important

798
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:20,977
you're there when she needs you.

799
00:47:21,107 --> 00:47:22,723
Then who brings home the bread?

800
00:47:22,857 --> 00:47:24,598
You men just don't understand women!

801
00:47:26,482 --> 00:47:27,688
Over there!

802
00:47:29,274 --> 00:47:30,560
It's Coco!

803
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:32,602
<i>I told them not to run around.</i>

804
00:47:32,732 --> 00:47:34,097
<i>Catherine!</i>

805
00:47:34,232 --> 00:47:35,814
<i>Coming! We're coming!</i>

806
00:47:35,941 --> 00:47:37,397
<i>Help us!</i>

807
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,355
<i>Hold on!</i>

808
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:39,722
Look at yourself! Help me!

809
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,939
Didn't I tell you to stay put?

810
00:47:43,357 --> 00:47:45,769
Hold on!

811
00:48:01,274 --> 00:48:02,355
Trouble!

812
00:48:04,191 --> 00:48:04,896
What happened?

813
00:48:05,024 --> 00:48:06,389
They fell down a chasm!

814
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:09,648
I told you to stay put!

815
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:11,389
It's her fault!

816
00:48:11,524 --> 00:48:13,982
Say something I understand in English!

817
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:15,688
Purple

818
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:17,972
Panty!

819
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:22,605
Hold tight!

820
00:48:27,899 --> 00:48:31,346
Purple is my favorite color!

821
00:48:31,482 --> 00:48:33,473
You came dressed for a picnic?

822
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:35,063
Don't tell me how to dress!

823
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:36,101
What happened to your instinct?

824
00:48:36,232 --> 00:48:39,020
Girls, we haven't landed yet!

825
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:42,107
JC, where's your hand?

826
00:48:43,066 --> 00:48:45,182
Under your purple.

827
00:48:45,316 --> 00:48:45,896
Let go!

828
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:47,310
You'll fall!

829
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:48,647
Let go! I can hold on myself.

830
00:48:48,774 --> 00:48:49,684
You sure?

831
00:48:49,816 --> 00:48:51,181
I'm sure!

832
00:48:51,316 --> 00:48:52,477
Okay.

833
00:49:13,107 --> 00:49:14,973
Madam, you've landed.

834
00:49:16,232 --> 00:49:17,688
We're fine.

835
00:49:17,816 --> 00:49:19,352
But Coco is missing!

836
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:22,228
JC is okay, but we've lost Coco.

837
00:49:23,524 --> 00:49:24,764
Give us the coordinates.

838
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:29,939
- This way.
- Okay.

839
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:42,272
Coco!

840
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:44,722
Coco!

841
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,931
I am over here...

842
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:48,682
I found Coco!

843
00:49:48,816 --> 00:49:50,773
Ask captain to bring the first aid kit.

844
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:52,355
Understood!

845
00:49:53,399 --> 00:49:54,514
Are you alright?

846
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:55,434
My foot...

847
00:49:55,566 --> 00:49:56,681
Which foot?

848
00:49:58,774 --> 00:50:00,139
Don't move!

849
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:08,722
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

850
00:50:08,732 --> 00:50:10,097
Your foot!

851
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,102
Nothing, nothing.

852
00:50:19,524 --> 00:50:20,434
Snake!

853
00:50:21,524 --> 00:50:22,639
Where?

854
00:50:22,774 --> 00:50:23,639
Done!

855
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:24,935
My foot...

856
00:50:25,066 --> 00:50:27,273
You dislocated your ankle. It's okay now.

857
00:50:29,149 --> 00:50:30,355
Over here.

858
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:35,018
Simon.

859
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:36,688
Look at these trees!

860
00:50:37,774 --> 00:50:39,264
Hacked by men.

861
00:50:43,149 --> 00:50:45,015
<i>I just saw cannons and cannonballs!</i>

862
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:48,520
<i>This vessel looks like it's from that era!</i>

863
00:50:49,232 --> 00:50:52,020
<i>Could this be the Indestructible
we've been looking for?</i>

864
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:53,890
<i>Very likely.</i>

865
00:50:55,274 --> 00:50:56,810
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

866
00:50:56,941 --> 00:50:58,397
<i>This chain rode...</i>

867
00:50:58,524 --> 00:51:00,106
<i>What is it doing here?</i>

868
00:51:02,316 --> 00:51:04,227
<i>It goes all the way into that tree!</i>

869
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:08,390
<i>The Indestructible!</i>

870
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:09,434
You've found it!

871
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,682
No, we fell on it.

872
00:51:11,816 --> 00:51:13,181
How lucky.

873
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:15,806
No way!

874
00:51:15,941 --> 00:51:17,431
It's for real!

875
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:22,938
It's okay.

876
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:24,727
<i>Just a tarantula.</i>

877
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:35,389
JC, I found my great grandfather!

878
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:36,685
What?

879
00:51:36,816 --> 00:51:38,602
You can tell from the bones?

880
00:51:38,732 --> 00:51:39,722
No, no. This ring.

881
00:51:39,857 --> 00:51:42,394
It has my family crest. I found it here.

882
00:51:43,524 --> 00:51:44,138
There are two!

883
00:51:44,274 --> 00:51:45,059
Which one?

884
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:46,272
Instinct!

885
00:51:46,399 --> 00:51:47,810
- Quick.
- This one!

886
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:49,351
Good!

887
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:50,222
Are you sure?

888
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,097
Sure.

889
00:51:51,232 --> 00:51:53,152
<i>I'll stuff your great grandfather
in my backpack.</i>

890
00:51:53,232 --> 00:51:53,892
<i>His arm.</i>

891
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:56,015
<i>Oops Sorry!</i>

892
00:52:17,857 --> 00:52:18,767
JC

893
00:52:19,691 --> 00:52:21,773
We've found the Indestructible!

894
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:27,891
<i>Who could've imagined,
at a place like this!</i>

895
00:52:28,024 --> 00:52:29,230
<i>How did you find it?</i>

896
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:30,188
<i>Brilliant!</i>

897
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:31,806
<i>We stumbled upon it.</i>

898
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,397
<i>Almost broke our legs.</i>

899
00:52:34,232 --> 00:52:35,097
Found the bronze heads yet?

900
00:52:35,232 --> 00:52:36,438
We found one.

901
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:42,228
Bonnie, I have the medical kit!

902
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:44,769
<i>Go around! There is an old path!</i>

903
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:46,230
<i>Just follow the marks we left!</i>

904
00:52:46,357 --> 00:52:47,893
Okay, I'm on my way!

905
00:52:48,024 --> 00:52:49,310
Thank you!

906
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:51,273
This is the Indestructible?

907
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:51,934
Yes.

908
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:53,932
How did it end up here?

909
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:54,680
Typhoon?

910
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:56,147
Typhoon that powerful?

911
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:56,854
Tsunami?

912
00:52:56,982 --> 00:52:57,813
Everything was possible.

913
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,227
On our way here,

914
00:52:59,357 --> 00:53:01,143
we saw graves and skeletons.

915
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:05,142
Those outside the cave
must belong to the crew.

916
00:53:05,274 --> 00:53:07,857
Judging on the decomposition
of those inside,

917
00:53:07,982 --> 00:53:10,223
they're different from the others.

918
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,689
Some were stabbed, too.

919
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:14,898
They must have fought before they died.

920
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:17,732
Probably men brought by
her great grandfather.

921
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:20,224
They didn't die from natural causes.

922
00:53:20,357 --> 00:53:23,065
They killed each another.

923
00:53:23,899 --> 00:53:26,937
Didn't her great-great
grandfather return home?

924
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:28,773
Then what was his son looking for?

925
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,769
Whatever the reason,
it doesn't matter anymore.

926
00:53:33,899 --> 00:53:34,809
You are right.

927
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:38,104
It happened 150 years ago. Right?

928
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:39,889
She understands Chinese?

929
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:41,810
I told her the same thing just now.

930
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:43,181
They killed each other?

931
00:53:43,316 --> 00:53:45,523
So his son came back to look for

932
00:53:45,649 --> 00:53:47,606
the spoils his father left behind?

933
00:53:47,732 --> 00:53:48,767
Right?

934
00:53:49,649 --> 00:53:51,139
- Right?
- Right.

935
00:53:51,274 --> 00:53:52,195
We need to take a leak!

936
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:53,602
Right.

937
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:55,472
Where are you going?

938
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,312
Bathroom!

939
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:56,941
All of you?

940
00:53:56,982 --> 00:53:58,564
Yeah! Wee wee

941
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:02,274
My grandmother's going to be very happy.

942
00:54:02,399 --> 00:54:03,639
How is your foot?

943
00:54:07,524 --> 00:54:08,855
It goes downhill,

944
00:54:09,357 --> 00:54:11,018
with logs lined up all the way.

945
00:54:11,149 --> 00:54:12,981
No wonder so many trees had fallen.

946
00:54:13,899 --> 00:54:15,060
Don't do that!

947
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:16,602
There is more.

948
00:54:16,732 --> 00:54:18,063
<i>Look over there!</i>

949
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:19,556
<i>An enormous anchor!</i>

950
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:22,763
<i>But why is it being hung on a tree?</i>

951
00:54:22,899 --> 00:54:25,732
It's a very clever lever device.

952
00:54:27,524 --> 00:54:29,891
<i>When the anchor descends,</i>

953
00:54:30,024 --> 00:54:31,264
the chain rode will ascend,

954
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:34,312
and sends the trunk
downhill via the pulley.

955
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:38,224
No wonder there isn't a single pulley
on the ship!

956
00:54:38,357 --> 00:54:42,225
How we benefit from our ancestors' wisdom!

957
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:44,890
You don't seem excited.

958
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:45,684
I am wrecking my brain

959
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,978
on how to take this trunk back with us?

960
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:50,723
If this trunk...

961
00:54:50,857 --> 00:54:52,973
There are no ifs.

962
00:54:55,607 --> 00:54:57,644
Money! Money! Money!

963
00:54:57,774 --> 00:54:59,890
JC, the medical kit

964
00:55:00,482 --> 00:55:01,813
and your friend is here.

965
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,438
Hey. JC!

966
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,103
I'm very happy to see you again.

967
00:55:07,316 --> 00:55:10,513
My friend, it's a big surprise.

968
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:17,230
Pierre?

969
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:18,889
Catherine!

970
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,890
Address me as miss! You're ridiculous!

971
00:55:21,024 --> 00:55:21,764
Shut up!

972
00:55:21,899 --> 00:55:23,515
You're not in your castle anymore.

973
00:55:24,607 --> 00:55:26,939
I knew you were working together.

974
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:29,683
I've been following you
since you met Catherine.

975
00:55:29,816 --> 00:55:32,729
Give me the painting
and the other things you stole.

976
00:55:32,857 --> 00:55:35,315
You think I'd bring everything
to this island?

977
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:37,689
It's a great place!

978
00:55:38,232 --> 00:55:41,520
There's no one else. Just us!

979
00:55:42,024 --> 00:55:45,096
I could kill you now,
and nobody would know.

980
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:47,472
Ready!

981
00:55:47,607 --> 00:55:48,972
Pierre!

982
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:54,518
Are you alright?

983
00:55:54,649 --> 00:55:57,391
Idiots! These guns are not loaded!

984
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:58,264
It wasn't us! We didn't do anything!

985
00:55:58,399 --> 00:56:01,232
It's okay! No bullets!

986
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,392
So who fired?

987
00:56:02,524 --> 00:56:04,125
- You guys are impossible.
- Don't move!

988
00:56:04,232 --> 00:56:06,143
Or I'll blow your heads off

989
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:08,181
Pirates?

990
00:56:08,316 --> 00:56:09,477
Yep! Bingo!

991
00:56:10,107 --> 00:56:12,394
<i>If you don't do what I say,</i>

992
00:56:12,524 --> 00:56:13,810
<i>I'll kill you all!</i>

993
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:18,603
If we work together, we can beat them.

994
00:56:21,899 --> 00:56:25,062
We've been here for a long time.

995
00:56:25,191 --> 00:56:28,263
Only now do we know this place.

996
00:56:28,982 --> 00:56:31,144
Welcome to my island, my friends!

997
00:56:31,274 --> 00:56:32,935
We're reasonable men.

998
00:56:33,066 --> 00:56:35,228
All we want is your money.

999
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:38,524
Squat! Hurry up! Understand?

1000
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:40,936
Don't do anything stupid and no one

1001
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:43,103
gets hurt!

1002
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:47,224
<i>The ransom is $500,000 each.</i>

1003
00:56:47,357 --> 00:56:49,815
<i>Do what you need to do.</i>

1004
00:56:49,941 --> 00:56:51,272
<i>Bravo!</i>

1005
00:56:51,399 --> 00:56:53,231
<i>Or we can feed you to the sharks!</i>

1006
00:56:53,357 --> 00:56:54,688
<i>Bravo!</i>

1007
00:56:54,816 --> 00:56:57,604
<i>I don't mind keeping the women, though.</i>

1008
00:56:57,732 --> 00:56:59,598
<i>Bravo!</i>

1009
00:56:59,732 --> 00:57:01,063
Let me tell you something.

1010
00:57:01,191 --> 00:57:03,057
We are not with them.

1011
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:06,058
My boss would be happy to get you
any money you want.

1012
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:07,272
He's very rich.

1013
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:10,107
Those guys want to fight you but I said no!

1014
00:57:12,232 --> 00:57:13,518
Take them away!

1015
00:57:13,649 --> 00:57:15,014
Thank you!

1016
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:17,640
So what are you doing on my island?

1017
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:20,681
It's my hat!

1018
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:24,932
Tell me. What are you doing here?

1019
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,101
Don't understand.

1020
00:57:26,232 --> 00:57:27,393
Mandarin?

1021
00:57:29,774 --> 00:57:31,890
Boss asked what were you doing here?

1022
00:57:34,857 --> 00:57:36,268
Barbecue.

1023
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:38,230
What did you say?

1024
00:57:38,357 --> 00:57:40,143
This is a metal detector.

1025
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:42,514
Barbecue? With this?

1026
00:57:42,649 --> 00:57:44,265
What were you doing with this?

1027
00:57:44,399 --> 00:57:45,981
Mini microwave.

1028
00:57:47,691 --> 00:57:49,807
Do you think I'm stupid?!

1029
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:52,524
This is a metal detector.

1030
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:54,105
What are you looking for?

1031
00:57:55,982 --> 00:57:58,519
You don't want to tell me?

1032
00:57:58,649 --> 00:58:00,435
I'll find out.

1033
00:58:00,566 --> 00:58:01,601
Take the girls.

1034
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:02,813
Hands off!

1035
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:05,727
Lie down!

1036
00:58:29,024 --> 00:58:30,139
What the

1037
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:31,314
I didn't pull the trigger!

1038
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:32,313
Take care of those at one o'clock!

1039
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:33,431
Okay!

1040
00:58:37,857 --> 00:58:39,518
Boss! Are you okay?

1041
00:58:40,816 --> 00:58:42,056
Don't move!

1042
00:58:53,607 --> 00:58:55,473
I forget to tell you. No bullets.

1043
00:58:56,607 --> 00:58:58,598
If we stay calm, nothing will happen to us.

1044
00:58:58,732 --> 00:58:59,346
Yes!

1045
00:59:03,649 --> 00:59:04,605
Stop him from getting the gun!

1046
00:59:04,732 --> 00:59:05,597
Okay!

1047
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:24,392
Captain!

1048
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:25,309
Hurry! This way!

1049
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:27,014
Come on!

1050
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:28,851
Twelve o'clock

1051
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:41,184
What should we do now, boss?

1052
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:42,397
Let's get out of here!

1053
00:59:44,482 --> 00:59:47,019
Mother of Mercy, I'm scared!

1054
01:00:02,024 --> 01:00:03,014
Snake-head?

1055
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:28,851
Catch it!

1056
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:38,014
My foot!

1057
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:44,976
My great grandfather!

1058
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:45,812
No, no, no!

1059
01:00:47,149 --> 01:00:48,480
My great grandfather!

1060
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:50,389
No, no, no!

1061
01:00:50,524 --> 01:00:53,186
No! My great grandfather!

1062
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,853
No, no, no!

1063
01:01:07,024 --> 01:01:07,980
Sorry!

1064
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:09,063
It's okay.

1065
01:01:09,191 --> 01:01:11,398
My great grandfather! Thank you.

1066
01:01:11,524 --> 01:01:13,060
Girls, let's go!

1067
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:15,102
My foot! My shoe!

1068
01:01:15,232 --> 01:01:16,722
My great grandfather!

1069
01:01:20,982 --> 01:01:22,143
Go! Come on!

1070
01:01:28,357 --> 01:01:29,142
Hurry!

1071
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:30,309
Run!

1072
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:31,772
- What's up?
- It's okay.

1073
01:01:32,649 --> 01:01:34,231
It's okay. What are you doing?

1074
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,147
Over here.

1075
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:38,891
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

1076
01:01:40,274 --> 01:01:41,764
My foot...

1077
01:01:41,899 --> 01:01:42,399
Run!

1078
01:01:42,524 --> 01:01:43,364
- You first.
- Okay.

1079
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:43,646
Go!

1080
01:01:43,774 --> 01:01:44,684
I've lost my shoe!

1081
01:01:44,816 --> 01:01:46,181
Go!

1082
01:01:48,232 --> 01:01:49,272
- Let me help.
- My foot!

1083
01:01:49,274 --> 01:01:50,685
Come on. Put this on!

1084
01:01:51,232 --> 01:01:53,644
Catch it!

1085
01:01:54,732 --> 01:01:56,188
It's the Snake-head!

1086
01:01:56,316 --> 01:01:57,237
You go with them first!

1087
01:01:57,357 --> 01:01:57,957
What about you?

1088
01:01:58,024 --> 01:01:59,389
- Meet you by the trunk!
- OK!

1089
01:02:00,982 --> 01:02:02,222
There's something in the shoe.

1090
01:02:06,649 --> 01:02:07,639
Take it!

1091
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:16,681
Catch it!

1092
01:02:17,941 --> 01:02:19,022
Any more?

1093
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:20,897
Don't move!

1094
01:02:21,024 --> 01:02:23,015
This gun has bullets.

1095
01:02:24,357 --> 01:02:25,097
Quick!

1096
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,312
Help me!

1097
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:30,101
Come on!

1098
01:02:30,232 --> 01:02:31,142
I count to three!

1099
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:34,389
One!

1100
01:02:34,524 --> 01:02:35,184
Two!

1101
01:02:44,232 --> 01:02:44,972
You've only found one?

1102
01:02:45,107 --> 01:02:46,393
I've only lived once!

1103
01:03:10,982 --> 01:03:11,892
Are they all dead?

1104
01:03:12,024 --> 01:03:12,980
Run!

1105
01:03:20,107 --> 01:03:21,848
Don't move! Hands up!

1106
01:03:26,774 --> 01:03:28,230
Don't give it to me!

1107
01:03:28,357 --> 01:03:29,597
My hat

1108
01:03:32,149 --> 01:03:34,356
I'm done with being reasonable!

1109
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:37,515
Barbecue this, smart guy!

1110
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:14,227
Don't move!

1111
01:04:28,649 --> 01:04:30,289
- Are you okay?
- None of your business.

1112
01:04:31,482 --> 01:04:32,313
Go!

1113
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:33,522
This way!

1114
01:04:35,024 --> 01:04:35,809
Hurry Up!

1115
01:04:35,941 --> 01:04:36,806
Go!

1116
01:04:36,941 --> 01:04:37,976
Are you alright?

1117
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,522
Hold this!

1118
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:42,519
Sheep head? JC

1119
01:04:45,607 --> 01:04:46,722
Come on!

1120
01:04:54,274 --> 01:04:55,560
We are so lucky!

1121
01:04:58,399 --> 01:05:00,060
My foot...

1122
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:01,101
it really hurts!

1123
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,310
A bone

1124
01:05:06,941 --> 01:05:08,227
Coco! Are you okay?

1125
01:05:08,357 --> 01:05:09,097
Gold!

1126
01:05:09,232 --> 01:05:10,063
How do you know about the gold?

1127
01:05:10,191 --> 01:05:10,896
It fell out.

1128
01:05:11,024 --> 01:05:12,544
You knew about the gold in this trunk?

1129
01:05:12,649 --> 01:05:13,730
I didn't say trunk!

1130
01:05:13,857 --> 01:05:15,393
Let me see. It's from my boot.

1131
01:05:15,524 --> 01:05:17,106
Is there gold in this trunk?

1132
01:05:18,149 --> 01:05:20,516
Say something in English! /
I've found it!

1133
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:22,851
Pack it!

1134
01:05:22,982 --> 01:05:23,596
It's changed!

1135
01:05:23,732 --> 01:05:24,722
Where is the Snake-head?

1136
01:05:28,649 --> 01:05:30,105
The Dragon-head must be in there!

1137
01:05:30,524 --> 01:05:31,685
You go!

1138
01:05:31,816 --> 01:05:32,476
Forget it!

1139
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:34,143
English!

1140
01:05:34,274 --> 01:05:36,766
How can we get out of here?

1141
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:37,980
One Way!

1142
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:41,764
Sit tight! What are you doing?

1143
01:05:43,399 --> 01:05:44,605
Don't move!

1144
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:47,682
Watch out for my hand. I am super accurate!

1145
01:05:48,399 --> 01:05:49,389
Accurate what!

1146
01:05:49,524 --> 01:05:50,605
I'll do it!

1147
01:05:51,316 --> 01:05:52,556
Watch out for my hand.

1148
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:54,728
Captain! Go southeast!

1149
01:05:56,024 --> 01:05:57,810
The road ends here.

1150
01:05:59,107 --> 01:06:00,097
This way!

1151
01:06:03,066 --> 01:06:04,101
It's almost done.

1152
01:06:04,232 --> 01:06:05,097
Get ready!

1153
01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:06,688
One, two, three

1154
01:06:15,024 --> 01:06:16,105
It's stuck!

1155
01:06:17,524 --> 01:06:18,059
What is going on?

1156
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:19,306
No time to explain!

1157
01:06:24,566 --> 01:06:25,681
Here they come!

1158
01:06:37,316 --> 01:06:38,556
You've got nowhere to go!

1159
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:40,181
Come on, don't shoot!

1160
01:06:40,316 --> 01:06:40,976
Come on!

1161
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:42,180
Scarf!

1162
01:06:42,316 --> 01:06:43,397
Scarf! Hurry!

1163
01:06:45,649 --> 01:06:47,014
Put them on! Put it!

1164
01:06:47,524 --> 01:06:48,559
Wear them well!

1165
01:06:48,691 --> 01:06:49,556
Simon!

1166
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:51,435
Put this on!

1167
01:06:53,774 --> 01:06:55,560
Treat them honey!

1168
01:06:57,357 --> 01:06:59,143
I told you!

1169
01:07:06,441 --> 01:07:08,307
Fire in the hole!

1170
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,181
Can you manage?

1171
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:11,523
You do it!

1172
01:07:11,649 --> 01:07:12,980
I'll do it!

1173
01:07:25,232 --> 01:07:26,518
The bees are homing in!

1174
01:07:28,149 --> 01:07:29,890
Smoke bombs!

1175
01:07:44,232 --> 01:07:45,347
Quick! Get on quickly!

1176
01:08:16,482 --> 01:08:18,143
Stop! You stupid!

1177
01:08:18,274 --> 01:08:20,311
It doesn't matter! Let 'em go!

1178
01:08:24,024 --> 01:08:27,062
We still have five.

1179
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,105
The bees are not so friendly.

1180
01:08:33,232 --> 01:08:33,767
Why You guys are okay?

1181
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:34,980
No! No! No!

1182
01:08:35,107 --> 01:08:35,707
Call your boss!

1183
01:08:35,732 --> 01:08:37,348
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1184
01:09:05,982 --> 01:09:08,314
- Everybody okay?
- Okay!

1185
01:09:08,441 --> 01:09:10,057
Money!

1186
01:09:29,607 --> 01:09:30,563
Everybody okay?

1187
01:09:30,691 --> 01:09:31,897
Okay!

1188
01:09:32,024 --> 01:09:33,310
Everybody okay?

1189
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:34,397
Okay.

1190
01:09:34,524 --> 01:09:36,231
You lost your great grandfather

1191
01:09:36,357 --> 01:09:36,857
It's okay!

1192
01:09:36,982 --> 01:09:38,643
It's okay. He loved the sea.

1193
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:45,687
Here! Here

1194
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:57,057
Hey guys! Here!

1195
01:09:59,357 --> 01:10:01,189
<i>The trunk is 1.3m in diameter and 7m long.</i>

1196
01:10:01,316 --> 01:10:03,796
<i>Its cylindrical volume is
about 9.28 million cubic centimeters.</i>

1197
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,060
<i>Based on its relative weight,</i>

1198
01:10:05,191 --> 01:10:07,591
<i>and the fact that it still floats,
about 1/22 should be gold.</i>

1199
01:10:07,607 --> 01:10:08,972
<i>Divide that by the size of each gold bar,</i>

1200
01:10:09,107 --> 01:10:09,596
<i>inside this trunk... My butt hurts!</i>

1201
01:10:09,732 --> 01:10:11,143
<i>There are 2,900 pieces of gold.</i>

1202
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:13,311
<i>Multiply that by the density of gold,</i>

1203
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:15,478
There are eight tons!

1204
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:16,771
So much?

1205
01:10:16,899 --> 01:10:17,659
A ton of gold each!

1206
01:10:17,774 --> 01:10:18,855
What about the two excess tons?

1207
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:20,347
Divide them into eight parts.

1208
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:21,563
What about the two excess parts?

1209
01:10:21,691 --> 01:10:22,522
They are yours.

1210
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:23,184
Why him?

1211
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:24,272
I just feel like it.

1212
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:26,640
This is why they
slaughtered one another.

1213
01:10:26,774 --> 01:10:28,606
No way, we don't even quarrel!

1214
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:29,688
What's the result?

1215
01:10:29,816 --> 01:10:31,181
Eight tons! Maybe more!

1216
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:33,893
Let's celebrate! Let's go outside!

1217
01:10:34,024 --> 01:10:36,607
One word for this journey: Romantic!

1218
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,893
Thrilling!

1219
01:10:38,024 --> 01:10:39,355
Rewarding!

1220
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:41,355
Intriguing!

1221
01:10:41,482 --> 01:10:42,972
Satisfying!

1222
01:11:12,441 --> 01:11:14,398
<i>Leave your message after the tone.</i>

1223
01:11:14,524 --> 01:11:16,936
I know you are there.

1224
01:11:17,066 --> 01:11:18,352
Stop sulking on your own.

1225
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,564
Pick up the phone and bawl me out.

1226
01:11:21,941 --> 01:11:22,305
Got to go.

1227
01:11:22,441 --> 01:11:24,728
Can't you ever have a proper conversation?

1228
01:11:24,857 --> 01:11:26,973
We start off nice and calm every time,

1229
01:11:27,107 --> 01:11:28,723
but always end up having a row.

1230
01:11:28,857 --> 01:11:30,018
- Morning!
- Morning!

1231
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:31,514
Thanks for your help last night!

1232
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:32,559
Don't mention it.

1233
01:11:32,691 --> 01:11:34,398
Your medicine

1234
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:37,107
Don't you guys have a confession to make?

1235
01:11:37,232 --> 01:11:38,017
Like what?

1236
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:39,560
Good morning, everybody!

1237
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:40,852
Stay here!

1238
01:11:40,982 --> 01:11:43,940
Last night I wrote a
poem to thank all of you

1239
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,556
for what you've done for me.

1240
01:11:45,691 --> 01:11:46,772
Coco, can you translate?

1241
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:48,060
Okay.

1242
01:11:48,816 --> 01:11:51,774
The oppressed rescued by brave knights

1243
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:54,732
A bunch of lying scoundrels in real life

1244
01:11:55,316 --> 01:11:56,272
What?

1245
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:59,721
They set sail for a hazardous journey

1246
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,313
Driven by greed

1247
01:12:01,441 --> 01:12:03,648
they embarked on a stealthy voyage

1248
01:12:03,774 --> 01:12:06,812
with hearts pure, righteous, fearless

1249
01:12:06,941 --> 01:12:08,852
and without self interest.

1250
01:12:08,982 --> 01:12:10,973
Heaven will be your judge.

1251
01:12:11,107 --> 01:12:14,554
Stealing national treasure is despicable.

1252
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:18,732
Their generosity will be rewarded.

1253
01:12:18,857 --> 01:12:20,518
You may evade the judgment of law,

1254
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:22,560
but never escape your own conscience.

1255
01:12:22,691 --> 01:12:23,681
God bless you.

1256
01:12:23,816 --> 01:12:25,398
Ask yourselves every new year's eve,

1257
01:12:25,524 --> 01:12:27,515
did I steal next year's zodiac animal head?

1258
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:29,560
Even all the riches in the world,

1259
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:31,853
won't buy you any peace of mind.

1260
01:12:31,982 --> 01:12:34,349
Chinese is so long!

1261
01:12:34,482 --> 01:12:35,813
That was God bless you?

1262
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:36,931
Yes.

1263
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:39,273
Are you sure the translation was correct?

1264
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:40,935
Was I right?

1265
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,730
We like it.

1266
01:12:43,857 --> 01:12:44,357
I like it.

1267
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:45,889
We like it.

1268
01:12:46,691 --> 01:12:48,147
What are you trying to say?

1269
01:12:48,274 --> 01:12:49,890
You always meant to look for gold.

1270
01:12:50,024 --> 01:12:52,061
You even brought metal detectors.

1271
01:12:52,482 --> 01:12:54,894
Gold or bronze, we need metal detectors.

1272
01:12:55,024 --> 01:12:55,980
Liars!

1273
01:12:57,524 --> 01:13:00,186
You're gunning for these gold from day one!

1274
01:13:02,482 --> 01:13:04,598
How could you rummage through my room?

1275
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:05,563
Stop being a jerk.

1276
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:08,809
I saw these
when I helped you back to your cabin.

1277
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:10,272
Oh, dolphins!

1278
01:13:11,191 --> 01:13:12,352
Whales, too!

1279
01:13:12,482 --> 01:13:13,938
Crocodiles!

1280
01:13:14,066 --> 01:13:15,682
- Crocodiles in open sea?
- Let's go.

1281
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:17,480
They swim, don't they?

1282
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:20,432
You really work well as a team!

1283
01:13:21,357 --> 01:13:23,974
Okay, then. Fire away

1284
01:13:24,107 --> 01:13:26,769
You're not even Martin Shangguan.

1285
01:13:27,191 --> 01:13:28,147
Correct.

1286
01:13:28,274 --> 01:13:30,060
You weren't looking
for Catherine's great grandfather.

1287
01:13:30,191 --> 01:13:32,398
You came for the gold and the bronze heads!

1288
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:34,060
You could say that.

1289
01:13:34,191 --> 01:13:37,309
You'll auction off each
recovered bronze head.

1290
01:13:37,441 --> 01:13:38,181
Right.

1291
01:13:38,316 --> 01:13:40,478
What do you plan to do with these?

1292
01:13:41,274 --> 01:13:42,890
Someone will pick them up
when we reach port.

1293
01:13:43,024 --> 01:13:45,231
I thought they're for the Chinese people!

1294
01:13:45,357 --> 01:13:47,018
You're just a mercenary!

1295
01:13:47,149 --> 01:13:48,605
There are relics all over the world.

1296
01:13:48,732 --> 01:13:50,598
Why can't we profit a little from them?

1297
01:13:50,732 --> 01:13:51,893
You feel no shame?

1298
01:13:52,024 --> 01:13:53,810
It's a matter of national dignity!

1299
01:13:53,941 --> 01:13:55,056
These battered heads...

1300
01:13:55,191 --> 01:13:56,681
have nothing to do with dignity

1301
01:13:56,816 --> 01:13:59,228
They represent centuries of
our cultural heritage!

1302
01:13:59,357 --> 01:14:00,893
What's the big deal?

1303
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:02,480
China is thousands of years old.

1304
01:14:02,607 --> 01:14:04,723
What we could achieve then,
we can do better now.

1305
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,143
What's going on?

1306
01:14:06,274 --> 01:14:08,356
Boy-girl problem. Come on.

1307
01:14:08,482 --> 01:14:10,598
If you like,
I can get someone to make you a dozen.

1308
01:14:10,732 --> 01:14:12,348
From every dynasty

1309
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:13,768
Scoundrel!

1310
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:15,014
What, me?

1311
01:14:15,149 --> 01:14:17,311
From your first day with Professor Guan,

1312
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:18,772
you have been using us!

1313
01:14:18,899 --> 01:14:19,639
Young lady

1314
01:14:19,774 --> 01:14:21,560
don't pretend you're holier than me.

1315
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:23,477
We didn't ask you to come along.

1316
01:14:23,607 --> 01:14:24,392
And

1317
01:14:24,524 --> 01:14:26,140
if a fish doesn't open its mouth,
it can't take a bite!

1318
01:14:26,274 --> 01:14:27,355
It's take the bait!

1319
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,689
Being a cheat is nothing to be proud of.

1320
01:14:32,816 --> 01:14:34,932
Your victims are those who trusted you.

1321
01:14:35,066 --> 01:14:36,682
We've been doing this
long before we met you.

1322
01:14:36,816 --> 01:14:37,816
I don't care what you do.

1323
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:40,103
But if you wrong your family
and fellow countrymen,

1324
01:14:40,232 --> 01:14:42,394
your children will forever live in shame.

1325
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:44,014
Stop the boat!

1326
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:47,556
What is it?

1327
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:49,435
The gold!

1328
01:14:58,899 --> 01:14:59,419
What's wrong?

1329
01:14:59,482 --> 01:14:59,982
Nothing!

1330
01:15:00,024 --> 01:15:01,230
Stabilize the boat!

1331
01:15:22,982 --> 01:15:24,063
How could this happen?

1332
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:25,773
It was alright just now.

1333
01:15:25,899 --> 01:15:26,889
The gold is too heavy,

1334
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:28,310
and the trunk has been
soaking for too long.

1335
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:29,055
They just fell off.

1336
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,681
I thought you had it all worked out!

1337
01:15:30,816 --> 01:15:32,102
You didn't do it right.

1338
01:15:32,232 --> 01:15:33,848
You tied the rope to the wrong end!

1339
01:15:33,982 --> 01:15:34,892
It's your fault!

1340
01:15:35,024 --> 01:15:35,809
Me?

1341
01:15:35,941 --> 01:15:37,557
Shut up! It's your responsibility!

1342
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:39,807
It isn't the fault of any one person.

1343
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:42,182
We could return and salvage it later.

1344
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:42,930
Right.

1345
01:15:43,066 --> 01:15:44,101
Salvage my ass!

1346
01:15:44,232 --> 01:15:46,724
Everything belongs to the
pirates around here!

1347
01:15:46,857 --> 01:15:49,269
Consider this travel fee...

1348
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:53,063
Pirates in this area are
from seven nations.

1349
01:15:53,191 --> 01:15:54,773
Enough! Knock it off!

1350
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:56,435
If this is any consolation,

1351
01:15:56,566 --> 01:15:57,897
I still have one here.

1352
01:15:58,024 --> 01:16:00,516
Whoever needs money can have it.

1353
01:16:02,774 --> 01:16:04,640
You are luckier than her great-grandfather.

1354
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:06,685
At least you won't go home empty-handed.

1355
01:16:07,524 --> 01:16:08,764
True.

1356
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:11,766
Someone did once try to take them home.

1357
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:14,391
Still these gold remain on Mother Earth.

1358
01:16:14,524 --> 01:16:16,561
Seven groups of pirates
now watch over them.

1359
01:16:16,691 --> 01:16:18,307
Safer than in a bank vault!

1360
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:21,274
Let's leave them here undisturbed.

1361
01:16:30,982 --> 01:16:32,848
Mark the coordinates. Hurry!

1362
01:16:33,982 --> 01:16:34,596
It's gone!

1363
01:16:34,732 --> 01:16:35,847
What? What?!

1364
01:16:35,982 --> 01:16:37,097
Where has it gone?

1365
01:16:37,232 --> 01:16:37,992
Get into the water?

1366
01:16:38,107 --> 01:16:39,393
You can't get into the water to get it?

1367
01:16:39,524 --> 01:16:40,810
You go get it.

1368
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:51,722
Professor Guan,

1369
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,058
Professor Guan, please come
and assist our investigation

1370
01:16:54,066 --> 01:16:55,352
on the theft of the bronze heads' data.

1371
01:16:55,482 --> 01:16:57,598
Just follow my instructions,

1372
01:17:00,441 --> 01:17:03,433
<i>Today, the sale of a bronze rams' head
and a bronze snake's head</i>

1373
01:17:03,566 --> 01:17:06,149
<i>has set a new record
at an art auction in London.</i>

1374
01:17:06,274 --> 01:17:09,471
<i>The last one, the dragon,
is expected to sell for even more.</i>

1375
01:17:09,607 --> 01:17:12,850
<i>The sale of the bronze heads
has provoked much controversy.</i>

1376
01:17:12,982 --> 01:17:17,601
<i>Calls for repatriation of relics
are intensifying.</i>

1377
01:17:18,107 --> 01:17:19,973
<i>We don't want our patriotic sentiment</i>

1378
01:17:20,107 --> 01:17:20,892
<i>to be hijacked by others.</i>

1379
01:17:21,024 --> 01:17:24,062
<i>We appreciate the young
for expressing their views.</i>

1380
01:17:24,191 --> 01:17:25,431
<i>The auctioning of historical relics
from illegal sources,</i>

1381
01:17:25,566 --> 01:17:27,773
<i>will only encourage more
criminal activities.</i>

1382
01:17:27,899 --> 01:17:31,392
<i>Those who plunder relics
are worse than thieves!</i>

1383
01:17:31,524 --> 01:17:33,060
Yes!

1384
01:17:36,274 --> 01:17:38,515
The golden mask of a pharaoh's concubine

1385
01:17:38,649 --> 01:17:42,222
and the secret smiling Buddha
were passed in an auction today,

1386
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:46,225
affected by the increasing
international uproar

1387
01:17:49,649 --> 01:17:50,730
Police.

1388
01:17:50,857 --> 01:17:52,598
Do you know these people?

1389
01:17:57,066 --> 01:17:59,683
<i>In breaking news, MP
Corporation has announced</i>

1390
01:17:59,816 --> 01:18:02,774
<i>it has won the right to
auction off the bronze</i>

1391
01:18:02,899 --> 01:18:05,561
<i>the piece will go to market
as soon as possible.</i>

1392
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:07,432
I've called you more than 7,000

1393
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:08,647
Just say the word.

1394
01:18:08,774 --> 01:18:10,811
From now on, in future, forever and ever...

1395
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:12,807
I won't call or bother you again.

1396
01:18:12,941 --> 01:18:14,272
We know where it is!

1397
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:16,097
Where is what?

1398
01:18:18,857 --> 01:18:20,097
The Dragon-head!

1399
01:18:20,232 --> 01:18:22,439
MP will put it up for auction next week!

1400
01:18:22,566 --> 01:18:24,648
They've had it all along!

1401
01:18:24,774 --> 01:18:27,641
We could never have gotten that bonus.

1402
01:18:27,774 --> 01:18:29,515
We've been fooled.

1403
01:18:29,649 --> 01:18:31,515
We behaved like amateurs!

1404
01:18:31,649 --> 01:18:33,185
Jonathan lied to us.

1405
01:18:33,316 --> 01:18:34,681
He has conspired with MP.

1406
01:18:34,816 --> 01:18:36,773
I figure they beat up those students, too.

1407
01:18:47,274 --> 01:18:49,481
Is it true that
two students from your organization

1408
01:18:49,607 --> 01:18:50,938
were badly beaten up?

1409
01:18:51,066 --> 01:18:52,522
Sorry, we cannot comment on this.

1410
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:53,389
Okay.

1411
01:18:53,524 --> 01:18:54,104
Thank you.

1412
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:55,393
Sir, care to comment? No comment.

1413
01:18:55,524 --> 01:18:56,104
Madam, please

1414
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,313
These reporters!

1415
01:18:57,441 --> 01:19:00,513
<i>To demonstrate their discontent
with the sale of these relics</i>

1416
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:02,811
The crown jewel was originally

1417
01:19:02,941 --> 01:19:05,273
an Indian national treasure of India.

1418
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:07,060
Why is it that our historical relics

1419
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:09,899
are on permanent display
in foreign museums?!

1420
01:19:10,191 --> 01:19:12,398
<i>In time for the Chinese Year of the Dragon,</i>

1421
01:19:12,524 --> 01:19:14,686
<i>I present the bronze Dragon-head.</i>

1422
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:17,558
<i>Starting price 60 million euros.</i>

1423
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:19,307
<i>National heritage, NOT FOR SALE!</i>

1424
01:19:19,441 --> 01:19:20,397
<i>Cultural relics from many countries</i>

1425
01:19:20,524 --> 01:19:22,686
<i>were pillaged and ended up abroad.</i>

1426
01:19:22,816 --> 01:19:24,853
<i>They include the star of today's auction,</i>

1427
01:19:24,982 --> 01:19:27,565
<i>the renowned bronze Dragon-head.</i>

1428
01:19:28,857 --> 01:19:30,097
Hello.

1429
01:19:30,774 --> 01:19:32,356
Are you sure?

1430
01:19:32,482 --> 01:19:33,938
I will come over right away.

1431
01:19:34,066 --> 01:19:35,932
Tell my sister I will be back soon.

1432
01:19:36,066 --> 01:19:37,272
What? I will be back soon.

1433
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:40,437
Ladies and gentlemen, are there any bids?

1434
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:42,522
Ten euro!

1435
01:19:47,066 --> 01:19:48,181
Pass!

1436
01:19:52,066 --> 01:19:54,273
<i>Any comment on the Dragon-head unsold?</i>

1437
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:56,060
<i>Will the Dragon-head re-auction again?</i>

1438
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:59,809
<i>Do you think the unsold affect
the reputation of MP Corporation?</i>

1439
01:20:03,107 --> 01:20:04,438
Take more at different angles!

1440
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:07,058
Michelle, send this to Coco. Quickly!

1441
01:20:08,816 --> 01:20:10,306
Take a few more with this.

1442
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:17,522
What interview?

1443
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:19,686
- I don't give interviews.
- An important call.

1444
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:20,521
Hello.

1445
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:21,354
Boss.

1446
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:23,018
We caught three students. What now?

1447
01:20:23,149 --> 01:20:23,889
What did they do?

1448
01:20:24,024 --> 01:20:25,230
Same as previous two.

1449
01:20:25,357 --> 01:20:26,347
They took photos again.

1450
01:20:26,482 --> 01:20:27,472
Lock them up first.

1451
01:20:27,607 --> 01:20:29,268
Is there really no other solution?

1452
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:30,935
I don't want it to drag on forever.

1453
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:33,560
I've been thinking about this all morning.

1454
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:34,977
Thanks!

1455
01:20:35,107 --> 01:20:36,142
Johnny, Tommy

1456
01:20:36,274 --> 01:20:38,185
Please give this letter to...

1457
01:20:39,566 --> 01:20:41,102
Take it easy with women.

1458
01:20:41,232 --> 01:20:42,688
Be cool, just like me!

1459
01:20:43,732 --> 01:20:45,268
Hello?

1460
01:20:46,607 --> 01:20:49,474
I know you! I recognize the voice.

1461
01:20:49,607 --> 01:20:50,813
Your calls finally returned!

1462
01:20:50,941 --> 01:20:53,023
No, I'm not busy.

1463
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:55,015
They're gone.

1464
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:56,514
Good.

1465
01:20:57,607 --> 01:20:59,644
Anything, whatever you say

1466
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,853
Chinese, Japanese, Italian or French

1467
01:21:05,982 --> 01:21:08,064
Fine. Love 'em all...

1468
01:21:08,191 --> 01:21:10,228
Sure.

1469
01:21:10,357 --> 01:21:12,064
Okay.

1470
01:21:12,191 --> 01:21:13,773
I agree.

1471
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:15,139
Good choice!

1472
01:21:15,274 --> 01:21:16,480
I agree.

1473
01:21:16,607 --> 01:21:19,019
Great! I'll wait for you,

1474
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:20,230
until the end of time!

1475
01:21:20,357 --> 01:21:22,314
Good. Yes, bye bye!

1476
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:28,515
Yes! Yes!

1477
01:21:29,774 --> 01:21:31,606
I knew you'd call me back!

1478
01:21:33,232 --> 01:21:36,304
As a man sows, so shall he reap.

1479
01:21:36,441 --> 01:21:39,058
God helps those who help themselves.

1480
01:21:39,191 --> 01:21:40,352
Coco is here.

1481
01:21:40,482 --> 01:21:41,017
Who?

1482
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:43,481
Coco. She's looking for you.

1483
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,764
What does she want?

1484
01:21:49,816 --> 01:21:50,897
A letter for me?

1485
01:21:57,732 --> 01:21:59,939
Are those students okay?

1486
01:22:00,066 --> 01:22:01,682
Three more are missing.

1487
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:03,056
What?

1488
01:22:03,191 --> 01:22:04,352
My brother,

1489
01:22:04,482 --> 01:22:05,597
<i>Lily'</i>

1490
01:22:05,732 --> 01:22:06,813
<i>and Michelle.</i>

1491
01:22:08,732 --> 01:22:11,724
I grew up with my kid brother.

1492
01:22:11,857 --> 01:22:14,064
Before my father passed away,

1493
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:18,517
he told me to look after him.

1494
01:22:19,232 --> 01:22:21,473
He's my only family now.

1495
01:22:22,899 --> 01:22:24,936
He is also our family's future.

1496
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:27,472
We're all passionate about

1497
01:22:27,607 --> 01:22:30,520
each making our own contributions
to our countries.

1498
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:31,605
But now,

1499
01:22:31,732 --> 01:22:33,393
two of us are lying in hospital beds,

1500
01:22:33,524 --> 01:22:35,140
and three of us are missing.

1501
01:22:35,274 --> 01:22:37,436
And we don't know if they are still alive.

1502
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:39,522
I beg you.

1503
01:22:40,066 --> 01:22:40,771
Pull yourself together.

1504
01:22:40,899 --> 01:22:42,355
Have you contacted the police?

1505
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:44,890
I've tried everything.

1506
01:22:45,024 --> 01:22:48,267
You are my very last resort.

1507
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:50,891
I'd love to help whenever I can.

1508
01:22:51,024 --> 01:22:53,436
But these people

1509
01:22:53,566 --> 01:22:56,024
I'm sorry for being a nuisance.

1510
01:22:59,566 --> 01:23:02,354
Professor Guan is detained by police

1511
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:04,473
for giving me those data.

1512
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,227
Why are you crying?

1513
01:23:42,028 --> 01:23:47,028
<i>Mom & Dad, do you really have ti do this?</i>

1514
01:23:50,816 --> 01:23:52,932
Coco said her brother disappeared

1515
01:23:53,066 --> 01:23:54,898
while spying on MP after
the aborted auction.

1516
01:23:55,024 --> 01:23:57,061
MP must have something to do with this.

1517
01:23:57,191 --> 01:23:58,397
There are only trees, nothing else.

1518
01:23:58,524 --> 01:23:59,104
Where's the proof?

1519
01:23:59,232 --> 01:23:59,846
Let's check it out!

1520
01:23:59,982 --> 01:24:01,343
Aren't you a compassionate person?

1521
01:24:01,357 --> 01:24:02,563
I feel more for you.

1522
01:24:02,691 --> 01:24:04,227
Is this what you really want?

1523
01:24:04,357 --> 01:24:06,143
He insist on it! It's over between us!

1524
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:07,810
We can't tolerate each other.

1525
01:24:07,941 --> 01:24:09,397
What does that mean?

1526
01:24:09,524 --> 01:24:11,731
You stink,
he disgrace himself in public, or what?

1527
01:24:11,857 --> 01:24:13,723
Don't give up until you've really tried.

1528
01:24:13,857 --> 01:24:15,643
Two grown-ups behaving worse than a child.

1529
01:24:15,774 --> 01:24:17,811
At least your daughter wrote.
What have you done?

1530
01:24:17,941 --> 01:24:19,227
We are destined to fail.

1531
01:24:19,357 --> 01:24:20,313
Failure?

1532
01:24:20,441 --> 01:24:21,721
Those who fail look for excuses.

1533
01:24:21,732 --> 01:24:23,018
Those who succeed look for ways.

1534
01:24:23,149 --> 01:24:24,981
Stop patronizing me! Lives are at stake!

1535
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:26,563
Or it will be too late!

1536
01:24:26,691 --> 01:24:29,479
It's easy to make rash promises. But how?

1537
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:30,928
Like you said, until you've tried

1538
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:32,059
you must not give up!

1539
01:24:32,191 --> 01:24:32,691
<i>Hey JC!</i>

1540
01:24:32,816 --> 01:24:34,181
Jonathan!

1541
01:24:34,316 --> 01:24:35,272
<i>What's up?</i>

1542
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:38,141
I've just found the Roses.

1543
01:24:38,274 --> 01:24:39,639
<i>Good! I'll come right over.</i>

1544
01:24:40,232 --> 01:24:41,472
That's my way!

1545
01:24:42,107 --> 01:24:42,972
Speak!

1546
01:24:43,107 --> 01:24:44,814
I didn't lie about MP's address.

1547
01:24:44,941 --> 01:24:45,396
Why would I lie about it?

1548
01:24:45,524 --> 01:24:46,389
Sure, I believe you.

1549
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:49,141
But you knew all along MP had dragon-head,
didn't you?

1550
01:24:49,274 --> 01:24:51,185
We'd never get that bonus, would we?

1551
01:24:51,316 --> 01:24:52,522
How would I know?

1552
01:24:52,649 --> 01:24:53,889
We're old partners, why would I lie to you?

1553
01:24:54,024 --> 01:24:54,855
You've never lied to me?

1554
01:24:54,982 --> 01:24:56,768
Of course not! Why would I?

1555
01:24:57,566 --> 01:24:59,432
What are you doing?

1556
01:24:59,566 --> 01:25:00,351
This

1557
01:25:00,482 --> 01:25:02,849
This is the world's most powerful acid.

1558
01:25:02,982 --> 01:25:04,063
I formulated it specially for you.

1559
01:25:04,191 --> 01:25:05,191
Have you ever lied to me?

1560
01:25:06,191 --> 01:25:06,771
Yes.

1561
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:08,560
I lied to you from day one.

1562
01:25:08,691 --> 01:25:09,647
From day one

1563
01:25:14,232 --> 01:25:15,267
I've told you everything.

1564
01:25:15,399 --> 01:25:16,639
Why did you do that for?

1565
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:21,731
Fruity Fruit salt?

1566
01:25:22,274 --> 01:25:23,480
Genius!

1567
01:25:29,316 --> 01:25:30,932
You came all the way to see me,

1568
01:25:31,066 --> 01:25:33,273
just to cut out the middlemen?

1569
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:34,810
They are all blood-suckers.

1570
01:25:34,941 --> 01:25:37,433
Jonathan lied about the Dragon-head.

1571
01:25:38,857 --> 01:25:40,018
Can't blame him entirely.

1572
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:42,060
We had the Dragon-head all along.

1573
01:25:42,191 --> 01:25:43,681
I just forgot about it.

1574
01:25:43,816 --> 01:25:45,727
Never mind. In our line of business,

1575
01:25:45,857 --> 01:25:48,224
we're used to conning each other

1576
01:25:49,232 --> 01:25:50,597
Where is the Roses?

1577
01:25:59,774 --> 01:26:02,015
We wouldn't have brought it
if it's a fake.

1578
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:04,014
I still have to examine it.

1579
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:06,060
It cannot leave our sight.

1580
01:26:06,191 --> 01:26:07,147
Sure.

1581
01:26:10,357 --> 01:26:11,237
We are ready to begin.

1582
01:26:11,274 --> 01:26:12,435
Just go ahead.

1583
01:26:13,607 --> 01:26:15,268
Check this out for me.

1584
01:26:16,191 --> 01:26:18,273
I can't clone one so quickly.

1585
01:26:20,691 --> 01:26:22,102
Verify this.

1586
01:26:22,607 --> 01:26:23,847
Wait here.

1587
01:26:24,649 --> 01:26:26,265
Mind if we look around?

1588
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:27,434
Be my guest.

1589
01:26:27,566 --> 01:26:30,149
An authentication center
underneath a vineyard?

1590
01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:32,015
A hub for counterfeiting, actually.

1591
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:33,355
Billions of dollars of turnover each year.

1592
01:26:33,482 --> 01:26:36,019
Everything is under their control.

1593
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:39,854
Wasn't that stolen
from an European museum earlier?

1594
01:26:39,982 --> 01:26:41,188
Almost an exact replica!

1595
01:26:41,316 --> 01:26:43,899
Artistes here are all masters
in their own right.

1596
01:26:44,024 --> 01:26:45,810
But they won't be famous in their lifetime.

1597
01:26:47,066 --> 01:26:48,773
Keep an eye on upstairs.

1598
01:26:51,816 --> 01:26:53,147
What are they doing?

1599
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:55,265
Sandblasting a porcelain vase,

1600
01:26:55,399 --> 01:26:58,596
which will then be treated chemically,

1601
01:26:58,732 --> 01:27:01,099
<i>and ends up like an age-old antique.</i>

1602
01:27:01,232 --> 01:27:04,190
<i>Layers of Chinese Xuan
paper can be separated.</i>

1603
01:27:04,316 --> 01:27:05,477
<i>This is an original.</i>

1604
01:27:05,607 --> 01:27:07,327
<i>Peel it apart and you'll get two originals!</i>

1605
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:08,981
<i>You can make 5 or 6 copies out of it!</i>

1606
01:27:09,107 --> 01:27:09,812
<i>But each copy would be too thin.</i>

1607
01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:10,931
<i>What about that?</i>

1608
01:27:11,066 --> 01:27:12,667
<i>That's silk, which cannot be peeled off.</i>

1609
01:27:12,732 --> 01:27:15,850
<i>So they slice it up into 8 parts for sale.</i>

1610
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,515
<i>How imaginative!</i>

1611
01:27:19,316 --> 01:27:20,898
Fragments of excavated relics,

1612
01:27:21,024 --> 01:27:22,264
<i>can be perfectly restored,</i>

1613
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:24,811
<i>by forging with a replica.</i>

1614
01:27:24,941 --> 01:27:26,932
<i>So it's partly real partly fake.</i>

1615
01:27:27,066 --> 01:27:28,556
When it is exposed to X-ray,

1616
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:31,729
a brand new vase can become 1,000-year-old.

1617
01:27:31,857 --> 01:27:33,518
They are so resourceful!

1618
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:35,481
Is there anything real on the market?

1619
01:27:35,607 --> 01:27:38,019
9 out of 1O are fakes.

1620
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:39,389
Pity the rich and famous!

1621
01:27:40,357 --> 01:27:41,813
This way.

1622
01:27:43,816 --> 01:27:44,977
JC

1623
01:27:45,566 --> 01:27:46,727
Who's that?

1624
01:27:47,982 --> 01:27:49,598
Probably one of Vulture's men.

1625
01:27:50,482 --> 01:27:51,392
<i>What is this?</i>

1626
01:27:51,524 --> 01:27:52,855
<i>This one</i>

1627
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:57,267
<i>A special furnace to
emulate carbon emissions.</i>

1628
01:27:57,399 --> 01:27:59,390
<i>Designed to fool antique experts.</i>

1629
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:02,061
<i>Its technology hasn't yet been perfected.</i>

1630
01:28:02,191 --> 01:28:05,764
<i>Fuel and catalyst can
only be added manually.</i>

1631
01:28:05,899 --> 01:28:07,230
<i>I can't believe they dare to go this far.</i>

1632
01:28:07,357 --> 01:28:09,849
<i>It looks crude. Is it dangerous?</i>

1633
01:28:10,566 --> 01:28:12,807
<i>Deception is always risky.</i>

1634
01:28:14,232 --> 01:28:15,973
Nice to see you, JC!

1635
01:28:21,566 --> 01:28:23,056
Did you lose your tongue?

1636
01:28:23,857 --> 01:28:24,972
I don't want to see you.

1637
01:28:25,107 --> 01:28:26,393
Come on, man.

1638
01:28:26,524 --> 01:28:27,559
Who's this guy?

1639
01:28:27,691 --> 01:28:29,682
This is JC.

1640
01:28:29,816 --> 01:28:31,932
A big name in the business.

1641
01:28:32,066 --> 01:28:34,353
Reputations can be deceiving.

1642
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:35,976
Competitor?

1643
01:28:36,107 --> 01:28:37,393
We're not the same.

1644
01:28:37,524 --> 01:28:38,980
We'd never do what he does.

1645
01:28:39,107 --> 01:28:39,938
What?

1646
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:42,265
Don't be so cocksure, alright?

1647
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:44,640
Whatever you do, I can do better.

1648
01:28:49,066 --> 01:28:53,481
Vulture, you stole a Buddha
from a Southeast Asian temple.

1649
01:28:53,607 --> 01:28:54,563
That's right.

1650
01:28:54,691 --> 01:28:58,480
They thought it was the work of a neighbor.

1651
01:28:59,274 --> 01:29:02,562
It sparked a border war,
killing thousands of people.

1652
01:29:02,691 --> 01:29:04,181
People die.

1653
01:29:06,191 --> 01:29:07,602
That's their business.

1654
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:10,683
You're the scumbag of our business.

1655
01:29:11,524 --> 01:29:13,731
You know the last person who called me that

1656
01:29:13,857 --> 01:29:15,268
is no longer breathing.

1657
01:29:15,399 --> 01:29:16,605
Yeah?

1658
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:23,519
S-C-U-M-B-A-G!

1659
01:29:24,274 --> 01:29:25,605
Scumbag.

1660
01:29:26,899 --> 01:29:30,017
I can kick your ass
without leaving this couch.

1661
01:29:34,149 --> 01:29:35,765
Show me.

1662
01:29:55,191 --> 01:29:56,602
You lose!

1663
01:29:56,732 --> 01:29:58,814
Still Touching.

1664
01:31:16,607 --> 01:31:17,597
Touching.

1665
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:20,602
<i>Stop!</i>

1666
01:31:22,566 --> 01:31:23,931
You can go now.

1667
01:31:24,066 --> 01:31:25,272
Have a good vacation.

1668
01:31:25,399 --> 01:31:26,730
Good night!

1669
01:31:31,607 --> 01:31:33,063
What are you guys doing?

1670
01:31:34,191 --> 01:31:35,852
Just checking the furniture.

1671
01:31:37,774 --> 01:31:39,390
Cheap imitation.

1672
01:31:39,524 --> 01:31:42,312
Hey boys, take it outside. Not here.

1673
01:31:42,441 --> 01:31:43,681
Okay?

1674
01:31:43,816 --> 01:31:44,977
It's the real thing. Be careful with it.

1675
01:31:45,107 --> 01:31:46,347
The Roses!

1676
01:31:46,482 --> 01:31:47,688
- Your eleven o'clock.
- Leave them here when you're done.

1677
01:31:47,816 --> 01:31:49,398
We'll clear them later.

1678
01:31:52,274 --> 01:31:53,981
You'll be paid tomorrow, as usual.

1679
01:31:55,274 --> 01:31:57,641
Your price is too high. Let's wait for Dad.

1680
01:31:57,774 --> 01:31:59,515
I can give you a discount.

1681
01:32:00,107 --> 01:32:01,563
But I want three people.

1682
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:02,931
What?

1683
01:32:03,607 --> 01:32:05,848
Those you locked up upstairs.

1684
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:10,685
I don't understand.

1685
01:32:11,149 --> 01:32:12,514
Let me show you.

1686
01:32:15,441 --> 01:32:17,227
That confirms my suspicion.

1687
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:21,231
Prove it if you can.

1688
01:32:27,274 --> 01:32:28,730
I will.

1689
01:32:30,024 --> 01:32:31,185
<i>Stop him!</i>

1690
01:32:33,191 --> 01:32:34,022
<i>I said stop!</i>

1691
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:34,980
<i>Don't move!</i>

1692
01:32:35,107 --> 01:32:36,313
<i>Don't let him get away</i>

1693
01:32:39,649 --> 01:32:40,855
<i>Stop!</i>

1694
01:32:41,649 --> 01:32:42,764
<i>Stop him!</i>

1695
01:33:16,732 --> 01:33:18,293
<i>There he is, let's go! He's down there!</i>

1696
01:33:41,316 --> 01:33:43,432
Open the door! Hurry!

1697
01:34:08,732 --> 01:34:11,645
JC, what have you proved?

1698
01:34:29,274 --> 01:34:31,015
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

1699
01:34:44,899 --> 01:34:47,607
I've been looking for a punchbag all day.

1700
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:49,605
You've just hit the jack-pot.

1701
01:34:55,691 --> 01:34:56,931
Vulture, do something.

1702
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:58,352
No, it's girl-on-girl time.

1703
01:34:58,482 --> 01:34:59,643
Oh, yeah!

1704
01:35:00,524 --> 01:35:01,935
Show me what you've got!

1705
01:35:43,399 --> 01:35:44,889
He's over there! Get him!

1706
01:35:47,774 --> 01:35:48,935
Is he still going?

1707
01:36:18,066 --> 01:36:19,852
Vulture, take him out!

1708
01:36:20,982 --> 01:36:22,438
That's not a real fight, man!

1709
01:36:22,566 --> 01:36:25,604
Only pretty little sissy
with no balls fight that way.

1710
01:36:25,732 --> 01:36:27,894
Now, that is a fair game.

1711
01:38:21,982 --> 01:38:23,393
So ugly!

1712
01:38:30,816 --> 01:38:31,816
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

1713
01:38:31,857 --> 01:38:32,972
Get him!

1714
01:38:40,274 --> 01:38:41,309
<i>It's gonna blow!</i>

1715
01:38:42,274 --> 01:38:45,517
<i>Get out of there, it's gonna blow!</i>

1716
01:38:45,649 --> 01:38:47,265
<i>Run! Quick!</i>

1717
01:39:20,566 --> 01:39:22,853
Wu, are you okay?

1718
01:39:24,774 --> 01:39:25,935
Martin!

1719
01:39:29,857 --> 01:39:31,018
Katie!

1720
01:39:32,732 --> 01:39:33,722
You alright?

1721
01:39:33,857 --> 01:39:35,188
I'm okay

1722
01:39:41,649 --> 01:39:43,014
Michael!

1723
01:39:44,107 --> 01:39:45,438
Dad!

1724
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:51,022
Bonnie!

1725
01:39:51,149 --> 01:39:52,685
Here, I'm fine.

1726
01:39:55,399 --> 01:39:56,810
Lawrence.

1727
01:39:56,941 --> 01:39:59,979
JC, finally we meet.

1728
01:40:01,274 --> 01:40:02,730
Daddy!

1729
01:40:02,857 --> 01:40:03,938
JC did it!

1730
01:40:04,066 --> 01:40:05,352
Shut up!

1731
01:40:05,482 --> 01:40:08,019
You idiot, I'd kill you!

1732
01:40:08,149 --> 01:40:09,810
What did I teach you?

1733
01:40:09,941 --> 01:40:12,273
We don't kidnap people!
We make fake things!

1734
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:15,437
Boss, I think we need to leave ASAP.

1735
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:17,889
Is that real?

1736
01:40:18,024 --> 01:40:19,480
It is real.

1737
01:40:19,607 --> 01:40:20,327
You had it tested?

1738
01:40:20,357 --> 01:40:21,893
Yes, I have tested it.

1739
01:40:26,274 --> 01:40:30,598
JC, I wish we could've met
under different circumstances.

1740
01:40:30,732 --> 01:40:32,564
I wish you'd make real things.

1741
01:40:32,691 --> 01:40:34,557
Well, you certainly took care of that.

1742
01:40:34,691 --> 01:40:37,558
And for your trouble,
I'm going to keep this free-of-charge.

1743
01:40:37,691 --> 01:40:39,978
Now, I certainly hope you'll escort

1744
01:40:40,107 --> 01:40:42,269
these nice, young people home, safely,

1745
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:44,481
and that you and I
can resume our relationship.

1746
01:40:44,607 --> 01:40:45,722
Is that a deal?

1747
01:40:47,774 --> 01:40:48,514
Deal.

1748
01:40:48,649 --> 01:40:50,060
Get 'em out of here.

1749
01:40:52,107 --> 01:40:54,189
Oh, Sorry about the dragon.

1750
01:40:54,316 --> 01:40:57,354
I guess it just disappeared. No extra zero.

1751
01:40:57,482 --> 01:40:59,143
Enjoy your Roses.

1752
01:41:00,941 --> 01:41:02,852
Dad, you're letting them off too easy.

1753
01:41:02,982 --> 01:41:04,393
Interpol's onto this place.

1754
01:41:04,524 --> 01:41:07,016
We have to destroy it anyway.
He just saved us the trouble.

1755
01:41:07,149 --> 01:41:09,811
Salvage anything that's worth anything,

1756
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:11,648
then get the hell outta here.

1757
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:13,685
Make sure Frankie takes the blame.

1758
01:41:13,816 --> 01:41:14,647
Okay, Dad.

1759
01:41:14,774 --> 01:41:15,614
I have a job for you!

1760
01:41:15,732 --> 01:41:16,722
Yes, sir!

1761
01:41:16,857 --> 01:41:18,894
The antique market has tanked

1762
01:41:19,024 --> 01:41:21,436
because of these whiny hippies
and their protests.

1763
01:41:21,566 --> 01:41:23,307
I want to teach the world a lesson,

1764
01:41:23,441 --> 01:41:24,852
starting with the Dragon-head.

1765
01:41:24,982 --> 01:41:25,938
How?

1766
01:41:26,066 --> 01:41:28,478
Time for the dragon to fly.

1767
01:41:30,524 --> 01:41:31,889
<i>Vulture!</i>

1768
01:41:33,149 --> 01:41:34,480
What a pity!

1769
01:41:36,482 --> 01:41:38,043
<i>Auction houses have come under pressure</i>

1770
01:41:38,066 --> 01:41:40,148
<i>after protests broke out around the world</i>

1771
01:41:40,274 --> 01:41:42,265
<i>calling for the return
of national treasures.</i>

1772
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:44,857
<i>MP announced that
if the sale of the Dragon-head</i>

1773
01:41:44,982 --> 01:41:48,304
<i>is affected by the protests,
they will be forced to act.</i>

1774
01:41:48,941 --> 01:41:50,773
<i>Let's begin our private auction!</i>

1775
01:41:50,899 --> 01:41:52,389
<i>For the precious Dragon-head,</i>

1776
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,306
Thank you so much!

1777
01:41:56,441 --> 01:41:57,806
Great news!

1778
01:41:57,941 --> 01:42:00,524
Chinese businesses worldwide donated $50M!

1779
01:42:00,649 --> 01:42:02,356
So what? The government won't accept

1780
01:42:02,482 --> 01:42:04,769
anything that is acquired from an auction.

1781
01:42:04,899 --> 01:42:07,299
Tell them we will buy it first
and keep it in trust for them.

1782
01:42:07,316 --> 01:42:09,648
No, whoever buys it will
become public enemy.

1783
01:42:09,774 --> 01:42:12,061
<i>The second and last time
it will be up for auction,</i>

1784
01:42:12,191 --> 01:42:14,023
<i>with no starting price.</i>

1785
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:16,140
<i>Do I have any opening bid?</i>

1786
01:42:16,691 --> 01:42:18,978
<i>With the international
press waiting for answer,</i>

1787
01:42:19,107 --> 01:42:22,645
<i>MP has threatened to dump
the head into a volcano</i>

1788
01:42:22,774 --> 01:42:25,106
<i>if no bids are received before noon today.</i>

1789
01:42:25,607 --> 01:42:26,813
<i>You can see the volcano behind me.</i>

1790
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:29,808
<i>The Dragon-head might be consumed by it.</i>

1791
01:42:29,941 --> 01:42:30,931
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>

1792
01:42:31,066 --> 01:42:33,353
<i>Our mid-day deadline is fast approaching.</i>

1793
01:42:33,482 --> 01:42:35,769
<i>I've yet to receive an opening bid.</i>

1794
01:42:35,899 --> 01:42:36,889
<i>If the auction is aborted again,</i>

1795
01:42:37,024 --> 01:42:38,435
<i>MP will dump the Dragon-head</i>

1796
01:42:38,566 --> 01:42:41,103
<i>into the live volcano in front of us.</i>

1797
01:42:43,607 --> 01:42:47,020
<i>At this stage,
I haven't received any opening bid.</i>

1798
01:42:47,149 --> 01:42:48,731
Fair warning.

1799
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:51,685
<i>Fair warning.</i>

1800
01:42:51,816 --> 01:42:53,432
Last chance.

1801
01:42:54,774 --> 01:42:56,765
This item is unsold.

1802
01:43:00,816 --> 01:43:03,979
Boss! The Dragon head's been
taken off the auction block.

1803
01:43:05,566 --> 01:43:07,227
Dump it!

1804
01:43:09,691 --> 01:43:11,932
Alright! Guys! Let's do this!

1805
01:43:20,107 --> 01:43:21,142
<i>It's really happening.</i>

1806
01:43:21,274 --> 01:43:22,730
<i>They've started their mission.</i>

1807
01:43:22,857 --> 01:43:24,347
<i>Looking at the three skydivers,</i>

1808
01:43:24,482 --> 01:43:27,440
<i>we can clearly see
one of them is holding the Dragon-head.</i>

1809
01:43:27,566 --> 01:43:29,307
They're dumping it!

1810
01:43:32,274 --> 01:43:32,934
<i>For the whole process,</i>

1811
01:43:33,066 --> 01:43:35,728
<i>MP Corporation has named this mission.</i>

1812
01:43:35,857 --> 01:43:37,689
<i>Let the Dragon Fly!</i>

1813
01:43:48,191 --> 01:43:50,558
What is this? A 4th diver has appeared

1814
01:43:51,066 --> 01:43:52,898
Check over there!

1815
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:04,977
<i>Wake up!</i>

1816
01:46:07,441 --> 01:46:08,602
<i>Wake up!</i>

1817
01:46:16,607 --> 01:46:18,063
<i>Save her!</i>

1818
01:46:18,191 --> 01:46:19,431
<i>Thank you!</i>

1819
01:46:34,232 --> 01:46:35,438
<i>He just let go of the Dragon-head!</i>

1820
01:46:35,566 --> 01:46:37,056
<i>It's falling towards the volcano!</i>

1821
01:47:10,066 --> 01:47:12,023
<i>They simply have to open their chutes now!</i>

1822
01:47:12,149 --> 01:47:13,605
<i>But they're still free-falling!</i>

1823
01:47:13,732 --> 01:47:15,643
<i>Very dangerous!</i>

1824
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:27,312
<i>A moment ago,
we captured a picture of this 4th jumper,</i>

1825
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:28,806
<i>but we still cannot identify him.</i>

1826
01:47:28,941 --> 01:47:30,102
It's Martin!

1827
01:47:30,232 --> 01:47:31,313
Martin!

1828
01:47:32,191 --> 01:47:33,932
How could it be him?

1829
01:47:39,524 --> 01:47:41,390
<i>You are a condor without wings,</i>

1830
01:47:45,857 --> 01:47:47,894
<i>don't even think you can beat me.</i>

1831
01:47:50,691 --> 01:47:52,898
<i>No! You're crazy!</i>

1832
01:47:54,857 --> 01:47:57,815
<i>The mysterious man has just lost his chute!</i>

1833
01:47:57,941 --> 01:48:01,935
<i>Not even the Dragon-head can save him!</i>

1834
01:49:55,316 --> 01:49:56,681
It's yours!

1835
01:49:58,857 --> 01:50:00,848
You're really something else, brother.

1836
01:50:33,191 --> 01:50:35,774
<i>In our special report,
MP Corporation chief,</i>

1837
01:50:35,899 --> 01:50:37,856
<i>Lawrence Morgan, and his son, Michael,</i>

1838
01:50:37,982 --> 01:50:42,351
<i>were arrested after the stolen Roses,</i>

1839
01:50:42,482 --> 01:50:44,189
<i>was found on MP property.</i>

1840
01:50:44,316 --> 01:50:44,976
Yes! Wonderful!

1841
01:50:45,107 --> 01:50:46,472
<i>And here's a special story.</i>

1842
01:50:46,607 --> 01:50:48,598
<i>Todya, four foreign consuls each received,</i>

1843
01:50:48,732 --> 01:50:52,054
<i>unmarked packages containing
lost national treasures.</i>

1844
01:50:52,191 --> 01:50:54,774
<i>They include
the Egyptian Pharaoh's Golden scepter,</i>

1845
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:57,140
<i>Czarina Catherine of Russia's staff,</i>

1846
01:50:57,274 --> 01:51:00,812
<i>an lncan jewelry box decorated
with a golden eagle.</i>

1847
01:51:00,941 --> 01:51:03,057
<i>And don't forget the Star of Arabia.</i>

1848
01:51:03,191 --> 01:51:06,354
<i>Now nobody knows who
this mystery sender is.</i>

1849
01:51:06,482 --> 01:51:08,018
<i>Quite amazing, isn't it?</i>

1850
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:10,356
<i>In similar news, Japan has just announced</i>

1851
01:51:10,482 --> 01:51:13,975
<i>it will return five ancient books to Korea.</i>

1852
01:51:15,399 --> 01:51:16,514
Yes!

1853
01:51:16,649 --> 01:51:18,481
Hi! My name is Anna

1854
01:51:18,607 --> 01:51:20,848
I'm be happy on behalf of
the Association of Cultural Preservation,

1855
01:51:20,982 --> 01:51:23,519
I give you this as
a token of our appreciation.

1856
01:51:23,649 --> 01:51:24,855
Thank you very much.

1857
01:51:24,982 --> 01:51:25,642
No need to thank him.

1858
01:51:25,774 --> 01:51:27,765
He has sold more than he donates.

1859
01:51:29,232 --> 01:51:31,064
Look, Professor Guan has been freed.

1860
01:51:31,191 --> 01:51:33,774
Mr. Liao, your wife has just given birth!

1861
01:51:33,899 --> 01:51:35,014
I am coming!

1862
01:51:35,149 --> 01:51:36,685
I've got to go! You run along.

1863
01:51:36,816 --> 01:51:37,396
I'll go and check it out.

1864
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:40,232
JC, you're the man!

1865
01:51:42,857 --> 01:51:44,143
<i>- You dated me!
- Said you'd show up for sure!</i>

1866
01:51:44,274 --> 01:51:45,395
It's loud! You listen to it.

1867
01:51:45,441 --> 01:51:47,023
<i>- I'm leaving!
- I've eaten every cuisine on offer here!</i>

1868
01:51:47,149 --> 01:51:48,731
<i>And still you're nowhere</i>

1869
01:51:49,941 --> 01:51:51,272
Coco!

1870
01:51:51,399 --> 01:51:52,230
BYE-bye!

1871
01:51:52,357 --> 01:51:53,688
Catherine!

1872
01:51:53,816 --> 01:51:55,432
I have something for you.

1873
01:51:56,649 --> 01:51:57,980
Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt?

1874
01:51:58,107 --> 01:51:59,973
I learned from you. I stole it!

1875
01:52:00,107 --> 01:52:02,474
Bankers won't know
how to appreciate it anyway.

1876
01:52:02,607 --> 01:52:02,937
You

1877
01:52:03,066 --> 01:52:06,479
Since we parted, I've
been learning Chinese.

1878
01:52:07,399 --> 01:52:08,184
It's wonderful!

1879
01:52:08,316 --> 01:52:09,772
A present from my sister.

1880
01:52:13,607 --> 01:52:15,063
Purple!

1881
01:52:15,607 --> 01:52:16,517
How is JC?

1882
01:52:16,649 --> 01:52:17,559
He's come around. You can see him.

1883
01:52:17,691 --> 01:52:18,931
I'll go to see him now.

1884
01:52:20,441 --> 01:52:21,681
Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt?

1885
01:52:21,732 --> 01:52:23,063
Check it out!

1886
01:52:25,149 --> 01:52:27,060
Try to settle your differences.

1887
01:52:28,774 --> 01:52:30,139
Mama!

1888
01:52:34,607 --> 01:52:36,723
<i>Only the efforts of two half-decent people</i>

1889
01:52:36,857 --> 01:52:39,315
<i>can give her a decent
environment to grow up.</i>

1890
01:52:43,441 --> 01:52:44,772
If you are willing,

1891
01:52:45,524 --> 01:52:47,356
we can start all over again.

1892
01:52:52,357 --> 01:52:53,142
It's a girl!

1893
01:52:53,274 --> 01:52:54,435
Come and see for yourself!

1894
01:52:55,274 --> 01:52:56,184
Congratulations!

1895
01:52:56,316 --> 01:52:57,181
What's her name? So lovely!

1896
01:52:57,316 --> 01:52:58,351
Pax! Pax?

1897
01:52:58,482 --> 01:52:59,768
It's Latin for peace.

1898
01:52:59,899 --> 01:53:01,856
JC gave me four names to choose

1899
01:53:02,649 --> 01:53:04,231
Sis? Sis?

1900
01:53:06,691 --> 01:53:07,522
Who is she?

1901
01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:08,514
The voice-mail lady!

1902
01:53:08,649 --> 01:53:09,409
Let's check it out!

1903
01:53:09,441 --> 01:53:10,897
I will be right back.

1904
01:53:15,399 --> 01:53:17,686
Come over here!

1905
01:53:18,107 --> 01:53:19,563
Who is she?

1906
01:53:19,691 --> 01:53:21,523
He's going to be fine.
In fact, he is healing quickly.

1907
01:53:21,649 --> 01:53:23,936
He could check out of here
within a week or two.

1908
01:53:24,066 --> 01:53:25,602
Thank you.

1909
01:53:29,524 --> 01:53:30,434
I was just thinking

1910
01:53:30,566 --> 01:53:31,601
It's okay.

1911
01:53:32,274 --> 01:53:33,935
That was an old message.

1912
01:53:34,066 --> 01:53:35,977
Now I know what you've been up to.

1913
01:53:36,566 --> 01:53:37,727
Get up!

1914
01:53:44,357 --> 01:53:45,392
<i>Action!</i>

1915
01:54:15,691 --> 01:54:16,726
<i>Stung my palms!</i>

1916
01:54:18,899 --> 01:54:20,560
<i>Get the dogs! Control them!</i>

1917
01:54:22,649 --> 01:54:24,310
<i>Good boy.</i>

1918
01:54:25,732 --> 01:54:26,597
<i>Not again!</i>

1919
01:54:26,732 --> 01:54:27,722
<i>Get the dog!</i>

1920
01:54:58,732 --> 01:55:01,929
<i>Don't stand too close to the edge.
It's dangerous!</i>

1921
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:08,849
<i>I'm here when it explodes!</i>

1922
01:55:42,649 --> 01:55:43,855
<i>You really slapped me!</i>

1923
01:55:57,066 --> 01:55:58,227
<i>Stop it, it's NG already!</i>

1924
01:56:09,149 --> 01:56:11,982
<i>I'm very scared whenever
I have a dangerous performance.</i>

1925
01:56:12,107 --> 01:56:13,438
<i>I think a lot.</i>

1926
01:56:13,566 --> 01:56:16,183
<i>It might be my last shoot,</i>

1927
01:56:16,316 --> 01:56:18,557
<i>and the last one in my life.</i>

1928
01:56:28,066 --> 01:56:28,851
<i>Was it okay?</i>

1929
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:30,188
<i>We are not the same</i>

1930
01:56:30,316 --> 01:56:31,602
<i>We are</i>

1931
01:56:31,732 --> 01:56:33,643
<i>We are not the same</i>

1932
01:56:33,774 --> 01:56:36,061
<i>We will never do what he does!</i>

1933
01:56:36,524 --> 01:56:37,730
<i>Stay clear</i>

1934
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:39,347
<i>Chubby, let's have some smoke!</i>

1935
01:56:40,024 --> 01:56:41,856
<i>Three, Two, One</i>

1936
01:56:51,274 --> 01:56:53,060
<i>Machine can understand me.</i>

1937
01:56:55,566 --> 01:56:56,897
<i>Hold tight!</i>
