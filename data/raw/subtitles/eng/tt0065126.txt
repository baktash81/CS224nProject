1
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,175
Little Frank.

2
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:52,595
- You take care of your ma.
- I will.

3
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:02,106
- You're not travelling very heavy, Tom.
- I got all I need.

4
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:11,740
You should be taking the train, Frank.
Fort Smith is too long a ride.

5
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,829
On Judy, 70 miles
will be a pleasant outing.

6
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:19,666
Yarnell, you'll take care
of the place for me.

7
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:24,003
You and my Mattie.
Where's Mattie?

8
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:26,923
I'm here, Papa!

9
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:35,391
Well, Little Bookkeeper,
got my wherewithal ready?

10
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,727
- Of course.
- How much are you allowing me?

11
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:41,730
There's... right around...

12
00:02:44,483 --> 00:02:47,236
...$150 cash money there.

13
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:50,823
Better hand me
my good luck gold pieces, too.

14
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:56,288
Buying Texas mustang ponies,
you'll need plenty of luck!

15
00:02:56,496 --> 00:03:01,710
You'll come around to my plan.
I intend to buy as many as I can swing.

16
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:07,883
- We'll breed them for deer-hunting.
- They're small and chicken-brained!

17
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:12,180
I'd say small and tough,
right for keeping up with dogs.

18
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,600
- You want my advice, Papa?
- I always do.

19
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,228
- Buy the ponies cheap.
- I expect to.

20
00:03:19,937 --> 00:03:24,275
This Colonel Stonehill has got
to get rid of them before winter.

21
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:28,321
Papa, that gun's old-fashioned.
Buy a new one at Fort Smith.

22
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:32,993
It served me well at Chickamauga,
and it's got a long way to go yet.

23
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:47,466
Goodbye, Papa!

24
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,770
Tom Chaney...
Now there's trash for you.

25
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:01,397
It's his job to look after the place.

26
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:05,443
Papa took him in when he was starving
and gave him a house.

27
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:09,031
Come, Mattie, it's only an old tool-shed.

28
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,660
You can still throw a cat
through the south wall!

29
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,079
It's got a good roof.

30
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,377
- This game's crooked!
- What?

31
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:24,463
You've been dealing me seconds!

32
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,052
Goddamn crooks!
You're stackin' the decks!

33
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:37,894
Come on, Tom. We want to make
an early start for home.

34
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:42,065
I'm going back in there.
I want to get my money back!

35
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:44,484
Not full of whisky and with a gun.
That's no way.

36
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:50,283
- A gun'll say a whole lot quick.
- I won't allow you to get into trouble.

37
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,952
- Gimme your gun.
- I'll give you one end of it!

38
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:55,997
Gimme the gun! Gimme your gun!

39
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:27,030
All aboard!

40
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:32,619
Where's the undertaker?

41
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:35,747
Round the corner
from the courthouse, ma'am.

42
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:37,290
Thank you.

43
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:45,800
I can't understand
all these people being here.

44
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:49,011
Everybody comes in from every place.

45
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:53,599
- I'd like to know why.
- They're hanging three men today.

46
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:57,019
We'd better go and see about Papa.

47
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,045
GESCHLOSSEN.
BIN BEl DER HINRICHTUNG.

48
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:25,341
Looks like he's out
rustling up business for himself.

49
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:31,222
Seems like we have some time
to waste before we see anybody.

50
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:34,142
I can tell you want to go to the hanging.

51
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:39,106
Afraid I can't.
Your mama said keep an eye on you.

52
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:42,276
Well, I'll go along.

53
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:45,696
Don't worry, I won't tell Mama.

54
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:54,329
<i>I was once lost</i>

55
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,877
<i>But now am found</i>

56
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:07,469
<i>Was blind but now I see</i>

57
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,098
<i>'Twas grace that taught</i>

58
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:16,854
<i>My heart to fear</i>

59
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:24,987
<i>And grace my fears relieved</i>

60
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:29,116
<i>How sweet the sound...</i>

61
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,161
That man up there on the porch...

62
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,920
That's Judge Parker.
He watches all the hangings.

63
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:45,592
- He says it's his sense of duty.
- Who knows what's in a man's heart?

64
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:52,390
<i>... Amen.</i>

65
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,067
The hangman's a Yankee.

66
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:06,280
They say he won't spring the trap
on a boy that wore the blue.

67
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:12,788
No, I'm here, I'll see it all.

68
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,633
My goodness!

69
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:39,441
That's not a faint-hearted judge.

70
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:42,902
Chaney'll get his due
before such a judge.

71
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:09,264
Is that the man?

72
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:13,643
That is my father.

73
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:19,941
If you would like to kiss him,
it would be all right.

74
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,821
No...

75
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,995
Put the lid on it.

76
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:27,054
I'm Mattie Ross
of Dardanelle in Yell County.

77
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:32,017
And this is my friend, Yarnell
Pointdexter, who works on our place.

78
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:35,020
Yes, ma'am. State your business.

79
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:39,400
My father was killed in Fort Smith
by a coward named Tom Chaney.

80
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:41,652
What are you doing
about the murder?

81
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:46,032
We do know this: His name's
Chambers, he's in Indian territory.

82
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:51,329
We think he robbed a mail hack
Tuesday down on the Poteau River.

83
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,332
He's medium height,
with a black mark on his cheek.

84
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,879
That's Tom Chaney.
There's no Chambers to it.

85
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:03,551
He got that black mark
when a man fired a pistol in his face.

86
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:11,100
- Why aren't you out looking for him?
- I've no authority in the Indian Nation.

87
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,312
He's now the business
of the US Marshal.

88
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,195
- Who's the best marshal they have?
- Bill Waters is the best tracker.

89
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:26,283
The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn,
double-tough, knows no fear.

90
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:30,454
L T Quinn is the straightest.
He brings them in alive.

91
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:35,667
- Where would I find this Rooster?
- At the Federal Court this afternoon.

92
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:38,129
He's bringing in prisoners
from the territory.

93
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:43,384
- Is Chaney one of them?
- I don't know. That's federal business.

94
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:49,516
Your father's gun...
you'll want to take it home, I expect.

95
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:53,853
His saddle is
at Colonel Stonehill's stock barn,

96
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:58,442
and the rest of his things are
at the Monarch boarding house.

97
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:03,155
I won't rest till Tom Chaney's
barking in hell!

98
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,247
Yarnell...

99
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,042
You stay with Papa.

100
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:19,589
When you get home, put him
in a better coffin with Mason's apron.

101
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,633
Your mama wants you home.

102
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:29,141
Mama knows I can take care of myself.
Tell her not to sign anything till I return.

103
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,852
People'll take it wrong
that I leave this to you,

104
00:12:32,102 --> 00:12:34,271
but I got Papa's business to see to.

105
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:37,442
Tell Mama I'm staying
at the Monarch boarding house.

106
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:41,654
I'm going to see
if Tom Chaney's been brought in.

107
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:44,740
And then I'll see this Rooster Cogburn.

108
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:59,465
All right, get outta the way!
Back up!

109
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:12,520
Stand up!

110
00:13:13,396 --> 00:13:14,939
Come on out!

111
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,695
Move along!

112
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,697
Are the prisoners
from the Indian Territory?

113
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:26,451
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is one of them Tom Chaney?

114
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:29,537
Cogburn ain't turned in his list yet.

115
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:34,210
- Which marshal is Rooster Cogburn?
- The big fella with the eye-patch.

116
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:40,466
Come on!

117
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:47,348
All right, take it away!

118
00:13:47,598 --> 00:13:51,978
- Mr Cogburn!
- Wait! Come back here!

119
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:53,897
Mr Cogburn!

120
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:55,982
Come back here!

121
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,154
All right, come on up.

122
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:05,200
If he thinks I'm put off by a locked door,
he doesn't know me!

123
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,122
- I'll be here when it opens.
- Then you'll be mighty hungry.

124
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:11,541
Best time to nail him is tomorrow.

125
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,502
He's testifying before Judge Parker.

126
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:27,432
Thank you very much.
I appreciate your kindness.

127
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:42,656
Have some more dumplings, dear?

128
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:47,954
At 25 cents per meal,
I might just as well.

129
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:52,792
I was hoping you were enjoying them.

130
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:58,173
They're all right. I can't see 25 cents
in a little flour and grease.

131
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:09,560
- You're late, Mr La Boof.
- The French is 'La Boeuf'.

132
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:12,354
I call it 'La Beef'.

133
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:21,405
Mr La Beef came in this evening.

134
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:24,075
Your spurs, please.

135
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:27,913
My poor chairs are scratched
enough already.

136
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:43,387
A right fancy rig, sir.

137
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:47,225
Watch out
for the chicken and dumplings.

138
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:50,394
- They'll hurt your eyes.
- How's that?

139
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:54,607
They'll hurt your eyes
looking for the chicken!

140
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:58,444
You squirrel-headed bastard!

141
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:03,283
Howdy. What's your name?

142
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,083
I'd like to go to bed now. But first
I'd like to see my father's traps.

143
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:25,306
I'll take a guess
and say your name is Mattie Ross.

144
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,944
- Mr La Beef is a handsome man.
- He needs a bath and a shave.

145
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:42,158
- He hails from Texas.
- Judge he's proud of his cowlick.

146
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:46,454
- How did he guess my name?
- He's a good guesser, I guess!

147
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:51,292
We're short of rooms
on account of the hanging.

148
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,752
You'll sleep in here
with Grandma Turner.

149
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:58,216
Don't worry about Grandma Turner,
she's used to doubling up.

150
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:01,511
I take it my rent will be half, then?

151
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,515
These are your father's traps.
The watch and the knife are inside.

152
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,351
Chaney stole his money and his horse.

153
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,786
What do you think
of Marshal Rooster Cogburn?

154
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:29,624
Rooster Cogburn! I've heard
some terrible things about him!

155
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:32,668
He loves to pull a cork, I know that!

156
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,537
His Honour, Judge Parker!
All rise!

157
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:52,253
I'll have a peppermint
to settle my stomach.

158
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:53,796
Yes, sir.

159
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:08,854
The United States Court
of the Western District,

160
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:13,567
having criminal jurisdiction in the Indian
Territory, is now in session.

161
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:16,820
Is that Judge Parker,
the hanging judge?

162
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:22,618
He's a tough customer. There's no
appeal except to the President himself!

163
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,749
Call Deputy Marshal Cogburn.

164
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:31,586
Mr Reuben J Cogburn
will take the stand.

165
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:42,972
You were sworn this morning,
you're still sworn.

166
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,601
Defence will cross-examine.

167
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:58,531
Mr Cogburn, you testified
for the prosecution this morning.

168
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,452
Allow me to summarise what you said.
According to your story...

169
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,666
...C C Wharton grabbed a shotgun
and killed Marshal Potter.

170
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,920
Then he turned the gun on you,
and you shot him.

171
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:16,883
Then the father swung his axe,
and you shot him, too.

172
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:21,638
The defendant tried to run,
you say, and you also shot him.

173
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:25,309
Just winged him,
or he wouldn't be here to pay up!

174
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,896
The old man and CC hit the ground dead.

175
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:33,609
How long have you been
a Deputy Marshal, Mr Cogburn?

176
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,696
Four years, come March.

177
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:39,532
How many men have you shot
in that time?

178
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:42,536
- The prosecution objects!
- Overruled!

179
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:49,376
How many men have you shot
since becoming a marshal?

180
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:55,090
- I never shot nobody I didn't have to!
- That's not the question. How many?

181
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:57,509
Shot or killed?

182
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,556
Let's restrict it to killed,
a more manageable figure!

183
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:06,352
Well, twelve to fifteen, stopping men
in flight and defending myself.

184
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:11,024
Twelve to fifteen? So many
you can't keep a specific count.

185
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,776
I have examined the records.

186
00:21:13,985 --> 00:21:18,114
A more accurate figure is available.
Come now, how many?

187
00:21:18,823 --> 00:21:22,203
Counting them two Whartons,
twenty-three.

188
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:25,206
I felt you'd come to it
with a little effort.

189
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:30,377
Twenty-three dead men in four years.
That makes about six men a year!

190
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:35,716
- It's a dangerous business.
- How much more for those you arrest!

191
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:40,305
Is it not true that
you sprang upon the Whartons

192
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:42,849
with a deadly six-shot revolver?

193
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:47,771
- I always try to be ready.
- Was this revolver loaded and cocked?

194
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:50,941
A gun that's unloaded
ain't good for nothing!

195
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,151
Just answer, if you please.

196
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,699
- The question don't make sense!
- Don't bandy words with counsel.

197
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,660
Yes, sir.

198
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:03,871
You testified you backed away
from old man Wharton.

199
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,833
- Yes, sir.
- Which direction?

200
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,378
Backward! I always go backward
when I'm backing away!

201
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:12,797
I appreciate the humour of that remark.

202
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:16,301
Aaron Wharton was standing by a pot
when you arrived?

203
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:20,889
More like squatting.
He was stirring the fire under the pot.

204
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,103
- How far did you back away?
- Six, eight steps.

205
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:30,774
Meaning Wharton advanced the same
distance? Six or eight steps?

206
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,819
- Sixteen feet?
- Something like that.

207
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:38,032
Then explain why the body was found
by the wash pot,

208
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:42,162
one arm in the flames,
the sleeve and hand smouldering.

209
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:47,292
Them hogs!
They may have moved the body.

210
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:50,628
Hogs, indeed!

211
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:54,341
Mr Goudy, do you have
any more questions?

212
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:58,220
None that I'll get a straight answer to.
I'm finished with him.

213
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,348
You're dismissed, Mr Cogburn.

214
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,601
Call the next witness!

215
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:09,773
Cecil Falling Leaf, take the stand!

216
00:23:15,447 --> 00:23:17,282
Raise your right hand...

217
00:23:24,122 --> 00:23:27,000
- Mr Rooster Cogburn?
- What is it?

218
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:32,131
I'd like to talk with you a minute.
They say you're a man with true grit.

219
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:35,635
What do you want? Speak up!

220
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:38,596
You've already wrinkled the paper...

221
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:42,600
It's pretty loose
because your makings are too dry.

222
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:47,980
I'm looking for Tom Chaney.

223
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:49,775
Well, who's he?

224
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:52,861
He shot and killed my father,
Frank Ross.

225
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,406
He's in the Indian Territory.
I need somebody to go after him.

226
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:58,617
- Who are you?
- Mattie Ross.

227
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:03,372
My family has 480 acres
of good bottomland in Yell County.

228
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,750
Mother's home looking after
my baby sister and brother.

229
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,421
Why don't you go home
and leave me alone?

230
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:13,675
They'll need help with the churning!

231
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:20,306
Mr Cogburn!

232
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:29,984
You can get a fugitive warrant
for Chaney and $2 for bringing him in,

233
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:34,655
plus 10 cents a mile for each of you,
and I'll give you $50 reward!

234
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:37,241
You've looked into this right smart.

235
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:39,451
Yes, I mean business.

236
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:42,705
What have you got in your poke?

237
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:48,336
By God, girl, that's a Colt's Dragoon!

238
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:52,674
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin.
What are you doing with this pistol?

239
00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:55,802
My father carried it bravely in the war.

240
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:59,598
I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it
if the law fails.

241
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:05,897
This'll sure get the job done,
if you can find a fence post to rest it on

242
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:08,149
while you take aim!

243
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,113
I'm afraid nothing'll be done
about Chaney unless I do it myself.

244
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:19,535
- I don't think you've got $50.
- After my horse-trading, I'll have it.

245
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:22,497
Do you know the robber
Lucky Ned Pepper?

246
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:25,542
I know him... well!

247
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:30,255
I shot him in the lip last August
over at Winding Stair Mountains.

248
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:34,051
He was lucky that day,
my shooting was off!

249
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:36,553
Well, I think Chaney's
tied up with him.

250
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:39,473
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

251
00:25:46,856 --> 00:25:49,984
- Ned Pepper, huh?
- Yeah...

252
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:55,490
Baby sister, I don't think
you can get $50.

253
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:58,076
But I'll take you home
and give you supper.

254
00:25:58,284 --> 00:26:02,122
We'll talk it over, make medicine.
How does that suit you?

255
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:03,999
Right down to the ground.

256
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,919
I'd like to meet your family.

257
00:26:25,647 --> 00:26:27,858
This is my father, Chen Lee.

258
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,485
And my nephew,
General Sterling Price.

259
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,629
You want more, Missy?

260
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:51,966
I've had enough,
and enough is as good as a feast.

261
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:56,637
I've never seen chopsticks work before.

262
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:58,682
Chopsticks save the fingers.

263
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:14,072
- Gimme your cup.
- I don't drink coffee, thank you.

264
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:18,995
- Well, what do you drink?
- I'm partial to cold buttermilk.

265
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:25,043
Well, we ain't got none of that.
We ain't got no lemonade either.

266
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,421
Let's get to the game.

267
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,190
- My deal?
- Yes, sir.

268
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,818
- What about my proposition?
- Thinking on it.

269
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:52,696
Sounds like a mighty easy way
to make $50 to me.

270
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,368
Don't crowd me, I'm figuring expenses.

271
00:27:57,577 --> 00:28:02,082
How you can play cards, drink whisky
and think detective at the same time?

272
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:08,755
Well, if I have to go up against
Ned Pepper, it'll cost $100, I figure.

273
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:10,924
And 50 in advance.

274
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:15,638
- You're trying to take advantage of me.
- They're my children's rates!

275
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:18,808
It isn't going to be easy
smoking old Ned out.

276
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:22,061
He'll be holed up
down that Indian Nation.

277
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:25,439
Well, I'm not going
to keep you in whisky!

278
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:30,153
I don't buy that, I confiscate it!

279
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:34,533
A touch of it wouldn't do you
any harm against the night air!

280
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:39,204
It's the real article,
genuine double-rectified bust-head!

281
00:28:39,454 --> 00:28:41,123
Aged in the keg.

282
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:44,668
I would not put a thief in my mouth
to steal my brains.

283
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:50,842
Well, sis, my price is $100.
There it is. Want to make medicine?

284
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,595
I will think about your proposition.

285
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:56,848
You better walk me
over to the boarding house.

286
00:28:57,891 --> 00:29:00,602
You are a lot of trouble.

287
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,813
Wait till I finish this hand.

288
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:13,157
You can't tell what's in a Chinaman's
mind. That's the way he bests you!

289
00:29:14,825 --> 00:29:16,118
I go.

290
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,085
Scat!

291
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:29,966
Mr Rat...

292
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:35,931
My writ here says you must stop
eating Chen Lee's cornmeal forthwith.

293
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:42,479
It's a rat writ, writ for a rat,
and this is lawful service of same.

294
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:46,609
See, he doesn't pay any attention to me.

295
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:50,863
Outside is the place for shooting!

296
00:29:51,113 --> 00:29:54,075
I'm serving some papers.

297
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:17,808
That was your job in the first place!

298
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:25,400
You can't serve papers
on a rat, baby sister.

299
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,237
You've got to kill him or let him be.

300
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:32,448
Are you going to drink all of that?

301
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:36,161
Judge Parker... Old Carpetbagger!

302
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:40,456
But he knows his rats.
We had a good court...

303
00:30:40,665 --> 00:30:43,586
...until those pettifogging lawyers
moved in.

304
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:47,047
The ratcatcher's too tough on the rats!

305
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:49,800
"Give them rats a fair show," they say.

306
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:53,304
What fair show
did they give old man Potter?

307
00:30:53,512 --> 00:30:56,515
Tell me that. Finer man never lived.

308
00:30:57,183 --> 00:30:59,185
You're useless in this condition.

309
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:01,688
I'll walk over there by myself.

310
00:31:01,938 --> 00:31:04,608
- You scared of the dark?
- Never!

311
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:09,237
If I had a big horse-pistol like that,
I wouldn't be scared of the booger man.

312
00:31:09,446 --> 00:31:12,908
I'm not scared of no booger man.

313
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,210
- Sugar?
- No thanks.

314
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,545
- Cream?
- Please.

315
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:26,797
Just a dab.

316
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:28,925
Miss Ross!

317
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:31,594
I'd like some private words with you.

318
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,474
And you I find a sweet distraction,
as most men do.

319
00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:39,770
- Will you excuse us?
- Of course, Mr La Beef.

320
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:49,738
What do you want of me?
Who are you?

321
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:52,783
I'm nobody yet,
but I expect to go high.

322
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:54,576
How?

323
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:57,664
To begin with, I expect to marry well.

324
00:31:57,914 --> 00:32:00,041
You have the haircomb for it.

325
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,629
- How did you know my name?
- I saw your mother yesterday.

326
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:08,216
What business did you have with her?

327
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:12,846
This. Can you identify
the man in this picture?

328
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:17,142
That's a likeness of Chaney,
with no black mark on his face.

329
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:18,853
But that's him.

330
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:23,566
I'm looking for him, and you are, too.
I know all about your father.

331
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:26,068
Why didn't you show me this
last night?

332
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,489
I only take one step at a time.
That's why I was given two feet.

333
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:35,912
His real name is Theron Chelmsford.
He killed a senator in Waco, Texas.

334
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,456
I've been on his trail
almost 4 months.

335
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:42,335
- You're some kind of law?
- I'm a sergeant in the Texas Rangers.

336
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,838
I'm working for the family
of the late senator.

337
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,967
Chelmsford, or Chaney,
shot the senator's bird dog.

338
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,972
The senator threatened to whip him,
and Chaney shot him.

339
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:57,393
Don't worry about Chaney any more.
I aim to have him hanged.

340
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:01,814
The sheriff told me you were looking
for a man to go after him.

341
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:05,276
I've already found one for the job,
Rooster Cogburn.

342
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:09,197
He's the toughest deputy marshal
they have.

343
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:12,201
Maybe I'll throw in with you
and the federal marshal.

344
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,954
- You'll have to talk to him.
- There's mutual advantage.

345
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,290
He knows the land, and I know Chaney.

346
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:21,043
It's at least a two-man job
to take him alive.

347
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:24,254
I must have him alive down to Texas.

348
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:28,884
We're not taking him back to Texas.
We'll take him to Fort Smith to hang.

349
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:31,888
- Is it important where he hangs?
- It is to me.

350
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:37,769
More so to me. There's a lady in Waco
who'd look favourably on me.

351
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:41,397
A hanging in Texas
would serve just as well.

352
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:46,736
No! I want Chaney to pay for killing
my father, not for some bird dog!

353
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:51,033
It won't be for the dog!
Lt'll be for the senator and your father.

354
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:52,785
He'll be just as dead.

355
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:59,333
If I couldn't find Chaney in 4 months,
I would not advise others how to do it!

356
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,545
Earlier I thought
of stealing a kiss from you,

357
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:06,674
although you are very young
and unattractive to boot!

358
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:10,136
But now I'd sooner give you
some licks with my belt!

359
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:13,974
One would be as unpleasant
as the other!

360
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:16,268
You Texans are ignorant of our ways.

361
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:19,813
We don't go easy on men
who abuse women and children.

362
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:23,984
Texan children show more respect
for their elders.

363
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:29,615
Texans gouge their horses with brutal
spurs and cultivate their hair like lettuce!

364
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:32,660
You'll push that saucy line too far.

365
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,745
I have no regard for you,

366
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:39,083
but I'm sure you have enough
for yourself to go around!

367
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,015
They are all for sale.

368
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:57,102
Except those four scrubby ones.

369
00:34:57,352 --> 00:35:02,232
- And... who do they belong to?
- The heirs of the late Frank Ross.

370
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:06,446
I'm Mattie Ross, and I'd like
to sell you back those ponies.

371
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:08,364
That's out of the question.

372
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:13,453
My father bought them for breeding,
but they're all geldings.

373
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:17,832
- You cannot breed geldings.
- That hardly concerns me.

374
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:21,920
He bought four ponies for $100,
and there's an end of it.

375
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:25,424
I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse,
stolen from your barn.

376
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:29,929
- Take that up with the man who stole it.
- He stole it while it was in your care.

377
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:33,015
You are responsible.

378
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:36,185
I admire your sand, but... l'm not liable.

379
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:40,272
- I will take it to the law.
- Do as you think best.

380
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:44,653
We'll see if a widow and three children
can get fair treatment in these courts.

381
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:50,158
- You have no case.
- Lawyer Daggett may think otherwise.

382
00:35:50,408 --> 00:35:53,578
- You are impudent.
- I do not wish to be, sir.

383
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:56,540
But I will not be pushed about.

384
00:35:57,332 --> 00:36:00,795
- I'll take it up with my attorney.
- And I with mine.

385
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:04,715
He and I will make money,
and your lawyer will make money.

386
00:36:04,924 --> 00:36:07,969
And you, Mr Auctioneer, will foot the bill!

387
00:36:08,177 --> 00:36:10,012
You're a damned nuisance!

388
00:36:10,221 --> 00:36:15,351
Who is this famous pleader, of whom
I was ignorant 10 minutes ago?

389
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:20,607
You've heard of the Great Arkansas
River Vicksburg and Gulf Company?

390
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:23,193
I have done business
with the GAV & G, yes.

391
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:26,697
My lawyer forced them
into receivership.

392
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:28,949
They tried to mess with him.

393
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:33,453
All right, come inside.

394
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:39,252
Sit down.

395
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:48,011
I will pay a total of $200
to your father's estate

396
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:52,974
when I have in my hand
a letter absolving me of all liability

397
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,101
from the beginning
of the world to date!

398
00:36:55,351 --> 00:37:01,150
I want $200 for the horse duty
plus another $100 for the ponies.

399
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,570
The ponies have no part in this.
I won't buy them back.

400
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,033
I'll keep the ponies, and the price
for Judy will be $300.

401
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:14,955
I wouldn't pay that for Pegasus!
Listen, as I will not bargain further.

402
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:20,879
I will take the ponies back,
keep your father's saddle for $200.

403
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:25,175
My lawyer would not wish me
to consider anything under $300.

404
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:27,594
That's for everything
except the saddle.

405
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:35,186
I would like to have that in writing,
for what it's worth.

406
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:40,608
When I have it in my hand,
I'll remit the extortion money.

407
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,861
This is your release.
You'll find it in order.

408
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,281
You had that already written out.

409
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,577
- I'll give you a cheque.
- I prefer cash.

410
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,547
One hundred, two hundred...

411
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:03,799
...three hundred.

412
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:14,561
You'll find a buyer
for those ponies very soon.

413
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:19,816
I have a tentative offer of $10 a head
from the soap works at Little Rock.

414
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:22,944
Such a shame to render
spirited horseflesh into soap.

415
00:38:23,194 --> 00:38:27,407
- I'm sure the deal will fall through.
- Expect me back for my saddle.

416
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:30,034
I'm sure I can!

417
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:35,124
Do you know
a Marshal Rooster Cogburn?

418
00:38:35,332 --> 00:38:40,754
Most people know Rooster Cogburn,
and some live to regret it.

419
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:46,343
I wouldn't be surprised to learn
he's a relative of yours!

420
00:38:55,187 --> 00:38:57,189
- Morning.
- Good morning.

421
00:38:59,107 --> 00:39:04,529
- Where's Mr Cogburn?
- Sleep late. Very drunk last night.

422
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:22,673
I've never seen anybody in bed
at 10 a.m. Who wasn't sick.

423
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:28,597
Coffee.

424
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:42,402
You ain't such an early bird yourself!

425
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:45,657
I almost gave up on you,
figured you'd gone home.

426
00:39:45,907 --> 00:39:51,246
- You need more slats in that bed.
- Ain't no slats in it at all.

427
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:57,335
Some kind of a Chinese rope bed
torture contraption, I'd burn...

428
00:39:58,169 --> 00:40:00,380
You got it! How much is there?

429
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:02,173
You still game?

430
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:06,178
I was born game,
and I intend to go out that way.

431
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:11,141
All right, one understanding:
We leave this afternoon to get him.

432
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:13,477
- You're not going!
- You misjudge me.

433
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:19,859
I can't go up against Pepper's gang,
looking after a baby at the same time!

434
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:24,447
- I'm not a baby.
- There's no hot grub or warm beds.

435
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:27,701
I've slept out at night before
while hunting coons.

436
00:40:27,951 --> 00:40:31,496
This ain't no coon-hunt.
It's no place for a kid.

437
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:35,667
- They said that about coon-hunting.
- You'll be calling for Mama!

438
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:37,669
I've left off crying.

439
00:40:37,878 --> 00:40:43,009
Make up your mind. If you're not
game, I'll find somebody who is.

440
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:46,304
I know you can drink whisky,
and I saw you kill a rat,

441
00:40:46,554 --> 00:40:51,017
but all the rest has been talk,
and I'm not paying for talk.

442
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:57,148
- I ought to paddle your rump!
- How do you propose to do that?

443
00:40:57,899 --> 00:41:01,069
If I smelled as bad as you,
I wouldn't live near people!

444
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,573
I've made up a short agreement
between us.

445
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:06,116
Sign it.

446
00:41:07,242 --> 00:41:08,702
Here's $25.

447
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,044
I'll give you another $25 when we
leave and $50 when the job is done.

448
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:21,758
We can get started at first light.

449
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:26,763
We'll cross the ferry and talk
to an informer in the Indian Nation.

450
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:29,015
He might know something.

451
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,809
I'll be more than ready.

452
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:37,273
Well, General...

453
00:41:38,275 --> 00:41:40,402
Look what we got.

454
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,472
There's an old saw that says:

455
00:42:07,722 --> 00:42:10,183
"One white foot, buy him,"

456
00:42:10,392 --> 00:42:12,769
"two white feet, try him,"

457
00:42:12,978 --> 00:42:15,481
"three white feet, be on the sly,"

458
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:18,442
"four white feet, pass him by."

459
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:22,697
But I don't hold with that.

460
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:50,976
I just heard that a young girl fell
head first into a fifty-foot well.

461
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:54,689
I thought perhaps it was you.

462
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,691
No, it was not I.

463
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,110
What do you hear
from the soap man?

464
00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:03,781
- Nothing.
- I'll take one of the ponies.

465
00:43:04,032 --> 00:43:08,036
The black one with the white
stockings. I'll call him Little Blackie.

466
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:11,874
- What is your offer?
- The market price.

467
00:43:12,124 --> 00:43:14,501
The soap man offered you
$10 a head...

468
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,924
That is a lot price. I paid you
$25 a head only this morning.

469
00:43:20,132 --> 00:43:22,843
- That was the price then.
- Tell me this...

470
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:27,056
Do you entertain plans
of ever leaving this city?

471
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:30,685
Yes, I'm off early tomorrow morning
for the Indian Nation.

472
00:43:30,894 --> 00:43:34,481
Marshal Cogburn and I are going
after the murderer Tom Chaney.

473
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,566
Cogburn...

474
00:43:36,816 --> 00:43:40,612
How did you light
on that greasy vagabond?

475
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:43,573
They say he has grit.

476
00:43:43,823 --> 00:43:47,953
- I wanted a man with grit.
- I suppose he has that.

477
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:52,667
He's a notorious thumper. Not a man
I would care to share a bed with.

478
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:56,337
- Nor would I.
- I wouldn't trust him too much.

479
00:43:56,587 --> 00:44:00,758
I paid a token payment. The balance
is paid when the job's done.

480
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:04,512
It may prove to be
a long, hard journey.

481
00:44:04,762 --> 00:44:07,306
A Christian does not flinch
from these difficulties.

482
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:13,438
Neither does he rashly court them.
He is not wilful or presumptuous.

483
00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:18,694
- You think I'm wrong?
- I think you are wrong-headed.

484
00:44:19,945 --> 00:44:21,989
I'll pay $12 for that pony...

485
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:28,204
...if you shoe him for me.
I will not ride a barefoot pony.

486
00:44:34,544 --> 00:44:36,546
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

487
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,885
Howdy!

488
00:44:42,135 --> 00:44:45,639
- What are you doing here?
- Having a chat with the marshal.

489
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,309
Sit down, sis, have some taffy.

490
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:54,023
This jaybird says
he's on the track of the same man.

491
00:44:54,231 --> 00:44:58,194
I told him we're not interested.
He's gone behind my back.

492
00:44:58,986 --> 00:45:04,534
A fella that carries a big-bore carbine
might come in handy,

493
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:08,163
if we get jumped
by elephants or buffalo!

494
00:45:08,413 --> 00:45:10,498
We don't need him.

495
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,918
- Everything ready?
- All but the grub.

496
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,295
I must have the wrong man.

497
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:20,592
- You let little girls hooraw you?
- Mind repeating that, jaybird?

498
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,179
The marshal's working for me.

499
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,431
- How much is she paying you?
- Enough.

500
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,642
Is she paying you $500?

501
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,770
No.

502
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:35,191
That's what the Governor of Texas
is paying on conviction of Chaney.

503
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,487
$500? Very little for a man
who's killed a senator.

504
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,574
Bibbs was a little senator.

505
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,826
I guess I'll just stick with sis.

506
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:49,164
The Bibbs family's put up
another $1,500 for Chaney.

507
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:53,627
- What are the terms?
- Just deliver Chaney, alive or dead.

508
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:58,465
That's more to my liking.
How will you split up the money?

509
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:04,222
If we take him alive, I'll split
the $1,500 and keep the state's $500.

510
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:07,475
If we kill him, I'll give you $500
of the Bibbs' money.

511
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:10,520
I don't want Chaney
taken back to Texas.

512
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:15,066
- He wants him punished, so do you.
- I want him to hang for my father.

513
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:18,152
I don't care about senators in Texas.

514
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:24,243
You can tell him to his face.
You can make him eat sand.

515
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:28,956
You can shoot him in the foot,
but first we gotta catch him!

516
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:34,169
- You can't have it all your own way.
- I've paid for it so I'll have it my way.

517
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,797
I don't understand at all.

518
00:46:37,006 --> 00:46:41,052
She ain't going anyhow.
Go home to your mama.

519
00:46:41,261 --> 00:46:44,639
- I told her she could go.
- No. She'll make trouble.

520
00:46:44,848 --> 00:46:49,185
Maybe I'll catch this Chaney
by myself and take all the money.

521
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:53,440
You might deliver him,
but I'd see you didn't collect a thing.

522
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,653
- How'd you do that?
- I'd dispute your claim.

523
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:59,739
Do that, and I'll kill you.

524
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:03,910
Don't count on shading someone
you don't know, fella.

525
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:10,166
I ain't seen no one from Texas
I couldn't shade!

526
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:15,087
La Beef, you cross me and you'd think
a thousand bricks had fell on you.

527
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:17,758
You'll wish you was back
at the Alamo!

528
00:47:17,966 --> 00:47:22,512
Knock him down, Rooster!
That reward's just La Beef's talk.

529
00:47:22,721 --> 00:47:26,391
I've given you good cash.
He'll cheat you!

530
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:29,853
A fella's gotta think about himself
sometimes, sister.

531
00:47:30,062 --> 00:47:33,148
We'll get your man,
that's the main thing.

532
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:37,195
Give me my $25 back. Hand it over!

533
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:40,990
I spent it.

534
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:46,871
- You sorry piece of trash.
- I'll get it for you.

535
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,124
If you think you can cheat me,
you're mistaken.

536
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,753
You may well hear from my lawyer!

537
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,430
Lawyer? What lawyer?

538
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:06,725
Don't worry about him.
Worry about our business at hand.

539
00:48:52,316 --> 00:48:54,318
- Red.
- Morning.

540
00:48:54,568 --> 00:48:58,322
- River looks kind of high.
- It's been raining up-country.

541
00:48:58,572 --> 00:49:04,286
- Who are you looking for this time?
- If I told you, you might tell him.

542
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,089
Well... you're well enough armed.

543
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,634
I'd say, "Tom Chaney, look out!"

544
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:24,432
Can't you get anything through
your head? You're not going!

545
00:49:33,442 --> 00:49:37,696
Forget about the freight
and take us across.

546
00:49:39,531 --> 00:49:41,784
You're not getting on this ferry!

547
00:49:42,034 --> 00:49:45,372
This is open to the public.
I've paid my 10 cents.

548
00:49:45,622 --> 00:49:48,416
Take this girl to the sheriff.
She's a runaway.

549
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:51,419
- There's a $50 reward.
- That's a big story!

550
00:49:51,628 --> 00:49:55,090
- Ask the marshal.
- She's a runaway all right.

551
00:49:55,298 --> 00:49:59,386
- Bound to be paper on her.
- They're in this together.

552
00:49:59,636 --> 00:50:04,642
I've got business across the river.
If you stop me, I'll see you in court!

553
00:50:04,892 --> 00:50:07,311
I've got a good lawyer.

554
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:17,488
- That lawyer again.
- She draws him like a gun!

555
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:31,378
I will not walk up that hill!

556
00:50:31,587 --> 00:50:34,798
I'm not going to let $50 slide.
Get on that horse.

557
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:43,683
Wait a minute.

558
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:46,060
I ought to fix my hat.

559
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:55,466
By God!

560
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:58,136
She reminds me of me!

561
00:51:58,345 --> 00:52:01,473
Then we might just not get along.

562
00:52:50,316 --> 00:52:53,528
Well, you were a little slow
getting across.

563
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:58,158
- I said you weren't going. Go back!
- I'll do no such thing!

564
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:00,452
La Beef...

565
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,390
Those horses can't get away
from Little Blackie.

566
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,019
They're loaded down
with fat men and iron.

567
00:54:10,568 --> 00:54:13,821
Now we'll see what tune you sing!

568
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,790
- I'll raise welts on you like worms!
- See what good it does you.

569
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:27,752
You're not hurting me. I'm just mad!

570
00:54:28,003 --> 00:54:33,508
- Are you gonna let him do this?
- I don't believe I will. Drop the switch!

571
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,929
Put it down.
You're enjoying it too much.

572
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:40,932
I go ahead with what I start.

573
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:46,397
You do, and it'll be the biggest
mistake you ever made!

574
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,527
You've taken her part all along,
but you ain't doing her no kindness.

575
00:54:51,777 --> 00:54:53,946
Just leave her alone.

576
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:03,414
This has given me a plan.

577
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:08,295
When we locate Chaney, we can
jump him this way and knock him out.

578
00:55:08,545 --> 00:55:11,381
Then we can tie him up
and take him back alive.

579
00:55:11,632 --> 00:55:15,093
- What do you think?
- You don't want to know what I think.

580
00:55:15,302 --> 00:55:17,888
Get on your horse.

581
00:55:18,472 --> 00:55:19,973
It's not dinnertime?

582
00:55:20,224 --> 00:55:26,981
Dinnertime'll come and go without
notice on this trip. Get on your horse.

583
00:56:14,114 --> 00:56:16,825
Presbyterian, huh?
Southern or Cumberland?

584
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:19,787
- Southern.
- My folks are Cumberland.

585
00:56:20,705 --> 00:56:22,748
I was raised in the Episcopal Church.

586
00:56:22,957 --> 00:56:26,294
I figured you
for some kind of kneeler!

587
00:56:31,465 --> 00:56:33,259
What did you learn?

588
00:56:33,467 --> 00:56:38,056
Ned was sighted at McAlester's store
about three days ago.

589
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:42,561
He goes there from time to time
to see a lewd woman.

590
00:56:42,811 --> 00:56:47,774
A thief named Haze is with him and
a Mexican on a round-bellied pony.

591
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:54,197
Chaney wasn't seen, but he was in
on that mail hijacking job.

592
00:56:54,406 --> 00:56:55,741
Stew?

593
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:24,647
- This is worse than a pig trail!
- Shortest way to McAlester's.

594
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:28,442
- How far is it?
- Around 60 miles.

595
00:57:28,692 --> 00:57:32,321
We'll make 15 today
and get an early start tomorrow.

596
00:57:33,364 --> 00:57:35,575
How do you like this coon-hunt?

597
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:40,330
Don't be looking around for me.
I'll be right here.

598
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:47,754
You look like a hog on ice!

599
00:57:47,963 --> 00:57:50,215
The bucket's heavy.

600
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:52,467
I'm stronger than I look.

601
00:57:53,886 --> 00:57:57,014
- What did you bring to eat?
- Salt.

602
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,558
Red pepper.

603
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,935
Taffy.

604
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:06,440
- Carry those in your pockets?
- Yeah. Along with...

605
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,151
...cartridges and skinning knife.

606
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:13,615
- What are those things?
- Corn dodgers.

607
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:19,997
- How many have you got in there?
- It must be 175.

608
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,999
I can scarcely credit that.

609
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:27,421
Chen Lee must've thought
it was for a wagonload of marshals.

610
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:32,969
That tastes like iron.

611
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:35,930
You're lucky to be
where water's so handy.

612
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:40,143
I've drunk out of a filthy hoofprint,
and I was glad to get it.

613
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:45,523
If ever I meet one of you Texans
who ain't drunk from a hoofprint,

614
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:51,739
I'll shake their hand or
buy them a Daniel Webster cigar!

615
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:56,994
How long you boys down there
been mounted on sheep?

616
00:58:57,202 --> 00:59:01,206
Have your little joke,
but I'll tell you one thing:

617
00:59:01,457 --> 00:59:06,337
That little fella'll still be running
when your big stud is collapsed.

618
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:07,881
Sheep!

619
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:16,806
That fire's a little big
if we're going to pass unnoticed.

620
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:19,517
Small fire is Ranger policy.

621
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:24,439
Listen, I have an idea.

622
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,777
I'll tell you the story
of the Midnight Caller.

623
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:30,905
One of you plays the caller,
I'll tell you what to say,

624
00:59:31,155 --> 00:59:33,157
and I'll play all the other parts.

625
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:36,160
Fine. Go ahead and tell it.

626
00:59:37,745 --> 00:59:41,624
- I'll tell it if you stop drinking.
- Let it go.

627
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:45,754
That, baby sister, is no trade.

628
01:00:16,452 --> 01:00:19,289
At least Little Blackie
likes the corn dodgers.

629
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:21,833
It's the salt in them.

630
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,802
We won't get to McAlester's by dark.

631
01:00:32,052 --> 01:00:35,764
We'd better head
for an empty dugout I know.

632
01:00:35,973 --> 01:00:40,102
- We can eat your turkey there.
- How? It's all ripped up.

633
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:42,772
Yeah, pretty chewed.

634
01:00:42,981 --> 01:00:45,400
Too much gun!

635
01:02:02,815 --> 01:02:05,859
I thought you said it would be empty.

636
01:02:26,673 --> 01:02:28,883
Who are you? What do you want?

637
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,262
We're looking for a place to sleep.

638
01:02:32,512 --> 01:02:34,765
There's no room for you here.

639
01:02:51,032 --> 01:02:53,744
Try that on the chimney.

640
01:03:51,513 --> 01:03:55,517
I'm a federal officer!
Speak up, who's in there?

641
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:58,520
<i>None of your damn business.
Keep riding!</i>

642
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:02,524
<i>- Is that Emmett Quincy?
- We don't know Emmett Quincy.</i>

643
01:04:02,774 --> 01:04:07,112
Emmett, this is Rooster!
I got five more marshals out here.

644
01:04:07,362 --> 01:04:10,449
<i>- We got a bucket of coal oil!
- Drink it!</i>

645
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,327
One more minute
and you're gonna drink it!

646
01:04:13,536 --> 01:04:18,291
Chuck your guns out and
follow them with your hands high!

647
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:23,212
If that coal oil goes down the chimney,
we'll kill everyone that comes out!

648
01:04:24,297 --> 01:04:26,299
<i>There's no five marshals out there.</i>

649
01:04:28,051 --> 01:04:31,138
Don't you bet your life on it!

650
01:04:31,388 --> 01:04:33,390
<i>Moon can't walk, he's hit.</i>

651
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,893
<i>- Drag him out.
- What papers you got on me?</i>

652
01:04:37,144 --> 01:04:39,980
I got no papers on you.
You better move!

653
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:44,526
<i>Tell those others to be careful
with their guns. We're coming out!</i>

654
01:04:49,741 --> 01:04:52,535
Hit the dirt! Belly down!

655
01:04:52,744 --> 01:04:54,078
Spreadeagle!

656
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,971
I forgot they were there.

657
01:05:11,347 --> 01:05:14,016
Get inside, both of you.

658
01:05:24,444 --> 01:05:26,821
Wrap that around your leg.

659
01:05:29,282 --> 01:05:31,868
Put the horses in the lean-to.

660
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:41,086
- Cuff them.
- Get up.

661
01:05:45,466 --> 01:05:48,094
Sit down. Get down there.

662
01:05:48,302 --> 01:05:50,596
You fellas are way too jumpy.

663
01:05:50,805 --> 01:05:53,724
What have you been up to,
besides stealing stock?

664
01:05:53,975 --> 01:05:58,896
- You ain't got no papers on us.
- No, but I got some John Does.

665
01:05:59,146 --> 01:06:02,025
Resisting a federal officer,
that's a year right there!

666
01:06:02,234 --> 01:06:05,779
- My leg hurts!
- I bet it does, sonny boy.

667
01:06:05,988 --> 01:06:09,825
You sit still
so it won't bleed so bad.

668
01:06:10,075 --> 01:06:14,204
- When did you last see Pepper?
- I don't remember any Pepper.

669
01:06:14,413 --> 01:06:17,958
Short, feisty fella, nervous,
with a messed-up lower lip.

670
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:20,712
That don't bring nobody to mind.
A funny lip?

671
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,673
It wasn't always like that.
I shot him in it.

672
01:06:23,923 --> 01:06:26,009
The lower lip?
What was you aiming at?

673
01:06:26,259 --> 01:06:27,677
His upper lip!

674
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:31,931
Ned's got a new boy with him,
a black mark on his face.

675
01:06:32,181 --> 01:06:35,101
That don't bring nobody
to mind either.

676
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:39,565
- You don't know anything, do you?
- If I did, I wouldn't blow.

677
01:06:39,773 --> 01:06:41,108
How about you?

678
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:44,778
I always help the law,
if it don't harm my friends.

679
01:06:45,446 --> 01:06:51,035
Pretty good idea,
otherwise I'll turn you in at Fort Smith.

680
01:06:51,285 --> 01:06:55,623
By that time your leg'll be swollen up
tighter than Dick's hatband!

681
01:06:55,873 --> 01:06:57,876
Mortified and they'll cut it off.

682
01:06:58,126 --> 01:07:02,589
If you live, I'll get you 3 or 4 years
in a penitentiary.

683
01:07:02,797 --> 01:07:08,803
- You're trying to get at me.
- If you talk, I'll take you to McAlester's.

684
01:07:09,054 --> 01:07:12,390
They'll get that ball out of your leg,
and I'll give you...

685
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:15,686
...2 or 3 days to get out
of the territory.

686
01:07:15,895 --> 01:07:18,189
Moon, I'll do the talking!

687
01:07:18,397 --> 01:07:22,526
Listen to him,
you'll lose your leg or your life.

688
01:07:22,735 --> 01:07:27,782
- Quincy ain't hurting.
- He ain't got nothing on us.

689
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:35,624
- Been looking around. Six horses.
- What kind of horses?

690
01:07:35,832 --> 01:07:38,210
Right good mounts. All shod.

691
01:07:38,418 --> 01:07:41,713
- They're waiting for somebody.
- You don't say!

692
01:07:41,922 --> 01:07:47,386
If you won't talk, you can keep busy.
Cut that up for frying.

693
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:03,569
What are you looking at?
Who are you?

694
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:07,282
I'm Mattie Ross of Yell County.

695
01:08:07,532 --> 01:08:09,409
What's she doing here?

696
01:08:09,617 --> 01:08:11,745
She's after the man
that killed her father.

697
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:17,001
His name is Chaney, a whisky drinker
like you. It led to killing in the end.

698
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:21,714
Answer the marshal's questions,
he'll help you. My lawyer'll help, too.

699
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,717
Don't jaw with these people, Moon.

700
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:28,846
- I don't like the way you look.
- Talking to me, runt?

701
01:08:29,054 --> 01:08:32,225
And I don't like the way
you're cutting up that turkey.

702
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:37,814
- He's making a mess of that turkey!
- Do it right, or you'll eat the feathers.

703
01:08:38,064 --> 01:08:40,650
I hope you go to jail.

704
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,903
Shame a kid like Moon losing his leg.

705
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:47,365
Too young to be hopping around
on a willow peg.

706
01:08:47,574 --> 01:08:50,870
Loves to dance too much
and sports.

707
01:08:51,078 --> 01:08:54,457
- You're trying to get at me again.
- With the truth!

708
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:58,461
- We saw Ned two days ago...
- You go on, I'll kill you!

709
01:08:58,669 --> 01:09:02,798
Quincy, I got to have a doctor.
I'll tell what I know.

710
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:13,185
Lord, I'm gonna die! Help me.

711
01:09:13,435 --> 01:09:15,896
I can't do a thing for you.

712
01:09:16,104 --> 01:09:19,942
Your partner's killed you,
and I've done for him.

713
01:09:20,192 --> 01:09:24,529
- Don't let the wolves get me!
- I'll see you get buried.

714
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,492
Where's Ned Pepper?

715
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:33,623
They're gonna rob the Katy Flyer.
They're coming here for remounts.

716
01:09:33,873 --> 01:09:36,668
See a fella with a powder burn
on his face?

717
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:39,462
No. My brother...

718
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:44,968
...George Garrett, Methodist
circuit rider out of Austin, Texas.

719
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:47,221
When's Pepper due here?

720
01:09:49,223 --> 01:09:53,727
Sell my traps and send
the money to my brother.

721
01:09:53,978 --> 01:09:56,188
Shall we tell your brother
what happened?

722
01:09:56,397 --> 01:09:59,566
It doesn't matter. He knows.

723
01:10:00,484 --> 01:10:04,155
I'll meet him later,
walking the streets of glory.

724
01:10:04,406 --> 01:10:06,700
Don't expect to see Quincy there.

725
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:08,243
Quincy?

726
01:10:09,744 --> 01:10:13,248
He never played me false
until he killed me.

727
01:10:14,499 --> 01:10:17,585
Let me have a cool drink of water.

728
01:10:28,514 --> 01:10:32,602
It felt as though I still
had fingers there.

729
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,335
Let me have that.

730
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,630
- It's one of Papa's gold pieces.
- You sure?

731
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,010
It was minted in California.
It's worth over $36.

732
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,596
Grandpa gave Papa two
when he married.

733
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:12,018
- Looks like we're on Chaney's trail.
- At least we're on Ned's.

734
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:16,522
Gimme the key to these cuffs.
Now go saddle the horses.

735
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:20,653
Moon said they were coming here.
You aim to run?

736
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:25,908
I aim to do what I came here to do.
Saddle the horses.

737
01:11:29,578 --> 01:11:32,039
Straighten up the place.

738
01:12:07,785 --> 01:12:10,997
Take your horse
and find a position over there.

739
01:12:11,247 --> 01:12:14,041
I'll be on this side.
Don't shoot unless I do.

740
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:16,545
We want them in that dugout.

741
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:20,048
I'll shoot the last man in the door
and we'll have them.

742
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:26,054
- You'll shoot him without a call?
- Then he'll know we're serious.

743
01:12:26,305 --> 01:12:31,059
I'll holler down after I shoot,
see if anyone wants to be taken alive.

744
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,645
But when they won't, we'll shoot them!

745
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:36,774
- I want Chaney alive.
- So does the Governor of Texas.

746
01:12:36,983 --> 01:12:40,570
All I know is there's a lot of them
and only two of us.

747
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:43,615
Why don't I nick Chaney
before he gets inside?

748
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:47,076
Any shooting before they get inside,
and they'll break.

749
01:12:47,327 --> 01:12:49,787
We're apt to come up
with an empty sack.

750
01:12:49,996 --> 01:12:52,833
All right, but if they break,
I'll nick Chaney.

751
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:56,128
If you hit Chaney with your rifle,
you'll kill him!

752
01:12:56,337 --> 01:12:58,839
- Remember the turkey!
- Yeah.

753
01:12:59,089 --> 01:13:02,760
You go after Ned,
I'll take care of Chaney.

754
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:07,514
- What does Ned look like?
- Short, feisty, doing all the talking.

755
01:13:07,765 --> 01:13:11,811
- Where does she go?
- I go where Rooster goes.

756
01:14:13,418 --> 01:14:16,170
Stay here and keep the horses quiet.

757
01:14:16,379 --> 01:14:21,217
- I can't see anything from over there.
- You've seen enough killing today.

758
01:14:21,426 --> 01:14:24,804
I'm not staying by myself.
Wait, I'll get my revolver.

759
01:14:25,013 --> 01:14:26,473
What for?

760
01:14:26,682 --> 01:14:29,727
So you can shoot your own foot off?

761
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:06,057
Why do you keep
that one chamber empty?

762
01:15:06,307 --> 01:15:09,143
So I won't shoot my foot off!

763
01:15:11,228 --> 01:15:16,692
- Corn dodger?
- Light a match and let me see it first.

764
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:19,987
- What for?
- Some have got blood on them.

765
01:15:20,821 --> 01:15:22,824
We ain't lighting no matches.

766
01:15:23,825 --> 01:15:25,869
I don't want any.

767
01:15:30,415 --> 01:15:32,918
What did you do before this?

768
01:15:33,168 --> 01:15:36,546
Just about everything...
except keep school.

769
01:15:36,755 --> 01:15:41,051
- How did you lose your eye?
- It was in the war.

770
01:15:41,302 --> 01:15:44,555
The Lone Jack,
a scrap outside Kansas City.

771
01:15:44,764 --> 01:15:46,849
What did you do after the war?

772
01:15:47,934 --> 01:15:53,523
I robbed a paymaster, went to Illinois
and bought an eating place,

773
01:15:53,773 --> 01:15:56,276
married a grass widow.

774
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:59,320
The place had a billiard table.

775
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:03,742
- You never told me you had a wife.
- I didn't have her long.

776
01:16:03,951 --> 01:16:06,495
My friends were a pack of river rats,

777
01:16:06,704 --> 01:16:09,915
and she didn't crave their society.

778
01:16:10,124 --> 01:16:16,588
She upped and left me and went back
to her first husband in Paducah.

779
01:16:18,048 --> 01:16:23,221
"Goodbye, Reuben," she says,
"the love of decency ain't in you."

780
01:16:23,471 --> 01:16:28,351
That's a divorced woman
talking for you about decency.

781
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,856
I told her, "Goodbye, Nola."

782
01:16:33,064 --> 01:16:37,319
"I hope that bastard
makes you happy this time."

783
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:42,408
Did you have any children?

784
01:16:42,658 --> 01:16:46,245
There was a boy,
Nola took him with her.

785
01:16:47,913 --> 01:16:50,291
He never liked me anyway.

786
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,004
A clumsier child
you'll never see than Horace.

787
01:16:55,254 --> 01:16:57,257
I bet he broke forty cups!

788
01:16:58,759 --> 01:17:02,262
Never did get you
for stealing that money?

789
01:17:02,512 --> 01:17:05,641
- I didn't consider it stealing.
- It didn't belong to you.

790
01:17:05,849 --> 01:17:10,646
I needed a road stake.
Like that bank in New Mexico.

791
01:17:10,854 --> 01:17:12,939
I needed a road stake,
and there it was.

792
01:17:13,148 --> 01:17:16,611
I never robbed no citizen
or took a man's watch!

793
01:17:16,819 --> 01:17:18,237
It's all stealing.

794
01:17:19,113 --> 01:17:21,407
That's the position
those New Mexicans took.

795
01:17:21,616 --> 01:17:24,035
I had to flee for my life!

796
01:17:24,285 --> 01:17:29,415
Bo was a young colt then, no horse
could run him into the ground.

797
01:17:29,624 --> 01:17:32,210
When that posse thinned out,

798
01:17:32,418 --> 01:17:37,216
I turned Bo around and,
taking the reins in my teeth,

799
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:41,971
charged them boys
firing two Navy Sixes.

800
01:17:42,221 --> 01:17:45,849
They must have been married men
who loved their families,

801
01:17:46,058 --> 01:17:49,478
'cause they scattered
and ran for home!

802
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,818
You don't have any family, do you?
Except Chen Lee and that lazy cat.

803
01:17:55,068 --> 01:18:00,240
General Price don't belong to me.
Cats don't belong to nobody!

804
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:04,953
He just rooms with me.
Course I depend on him...

805
01:18:05,829 --> 01:18:07,622
Well...

806
01:18:07,872 --> 01:18:11,794
Baby sister, you better try
and get some sleep.

807
01:18:12,044 --> 01:18:15,464
I'll wake you up when they get here.

808
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,415
Shh!

809
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:53,004
Looks like Moon was telling the truth.

810
01:19:40,011 --> 01:19:44,015
- What are they doing?
- Smelling around.

811
01:19:44,265 --> 01:19:46,435
You see Chaney?

812
01:19:49,105 --> 01:19:51,482
I can't make out their faces.

813
01:19:51,691 --> 01:19:54,485
That's Ned Pepper, all right.

814
01:20:25,643 --> 01:20:29,022
Quincy! Moon!

815
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,607
That's him hollering.

816
01:20:31,816 --> 01:20:36,487
That's the original
Mexican Bob with him.

817
01:20:36,738 --> 01:20:39,782
- There's more than one?
- There's a younger one.

818
01:20:39,991 --> 01:20:42,369
But he ain't a patch to this one.

819
01:20:42,578 --> 01:20:43,912
Moon!

820
01:20:45,414 --> 01:20:46,749
Quincy!

821
01:20:55,174 --> 01:20:57,176
Now he's done it!

822
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,886
Over here, Ned!

823
01:21:41,473 --> 01:21:43,517
I'm hit.

824
01:21:56,781 --> 01:21:59,575
They don't call him
Lucky Ned Pepper for nothing.

825
01:21:59,826 --> 01:22:02,912
That man gave his life for him.
He didn't even look back.

826
01:22:03,162 --> 01:22:06,708
Looking back is a bad habit.

827
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:09,585
Well...

828
01:22:20,931 --> 01:22:22,391
What's your story?

829
01:22:22,599 --> 01:22:26,979
I was on the move to a better place,
and I heard the first shot.

830
01:22:27,187 --> 01:22:29,481
More likely asleep!

831
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:36,114
- You know who they are?
- The one on the sand spit's Haze.

832
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:46,124
The boy? I don't know.

833
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,544
He's not much older than I am.

834
01:22:54,383 --> 01:22:57,053
That's nothing but a little scratch.

835
01:22:59,055 --> 01:23:03,476
That's nothing to do with you.
Go make us some coffee!

836
01:23:03,726 --> 01:23:07,855
- It won't take long.
- Let it go and go on inside!

837
01:23:08,064 --> 01:23:11,610
Why are you being so foolish?

838
01:23:19,701 --> 01:23:24,331
- You're quite a horse-shooter.
- I was trying for Ned Pepper.

839
01:23:24,581 --> 01:23:27,417
Next time try for the horse
and maybe you'll hit Pepper!

840
01:23:27,668 --> 01:23:29,836
What are we waiting for?
Let's ride after them.

841
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:33,299
I say no. I know
where they're going to earth.

842
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,886
You can't take men
by watching them run away.

843
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:40,014
I know this country,
and I know these men.

844
01:23:40,264 --> 01:23:43,351
We'll take the horses
and the dead into McAlester,

845
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:47,897
and I'll put in a claim for any reward
the railroad may offer.

846
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:52,569
- You backed up?
- Some... for now.

847
01:24:12,549 --> 01:24:17,595
- Damn a man that whistles!
- He's keeping his mind off his hand.

848
01:24:17,804 --> 01:24:20,056
You don't think
very much of me, do you?

849
01:24:20,307 --> 01:24:23,768
I don't think about you at all,
if you keep quiet.

850
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:29,859
I was told that you rode
with Quantrell and that border trash.

851
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:34,322
I heard Quantrell and his men weren't
soldiers but murdering thieves.

852
01:24:34,572 --> 01:24:36,866
I heard the same thing.

853
01:24:37,074 --> 01:24:39,660
I heard they murdered
women and children.

854
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:42,455
I heard that, too,
and it's a damn lie.

855
01:24:43,122 --> 01:24:45,375
What outfit were you with
during the war?

856
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:50,297
- Shreveport, with Kirby Smith.
- I mean what side were you on?

857
01:24:50,505 --> 01:24:53,175
I served with General Kirby Smith.

858
01:24:53,425 --> 01:24:55,886
I don't have to hang my head
when I say it.

859
01:24:56,094 --> 01:24:59,681
Go ahead, make me look
foolish in her eyes.

860
01:24:59,931 --> 01:25:02,476
You don't need me for that.

861
01:25:02,684 --> 01:25:05,313
I don't like the way
you make conversation.

862
01:25:05,521 --> 01:25:08,441
I don't like your conversation
about Captain Quantrell.

863
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:12,779
Captain? Captain of what?
A bunch of thieves?

864
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:17,659
Young fella, if you're looking
for trouble, I'll accommodate you.

865
01:25:17,867 --> 01:25:20,495
Otherwise... leave it alone.

866
01:25:20,703 --> 01:25:22,706
I've been thinking about Pepper.

867
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:26,543
Maybe he'd have murdered those two
so they wouldn't inform on him.

868
01:25:26,794 --> 01:25:29,254
- Ned wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

869
01:25:29,463 --> 01:25:32,841
He doesn't kill people for no reason.

870
01:25:33,092 --> 01:25:35,719
Had he a reason, he'd kill them.

871
01:25:47,732 --> 01:25:51,903
Looks like we might joggle
some of our passengers off.

872
01:25:52,153 --> 01:25:54,698
Well, they're past hurting.

873
01:26:15,511 --> 01:26:20,434
- We'll tie up here, if you don't mind?
- Sure, marshal, you've quite a load.

874
01:26:20,684 --> 01:26:24,938
Yeah... about half the load
I was looking for.

875
01:26:25,188 --> 01:26:28,525
Go in and meet Mrs McAlester,
she'll fix some dinner.

876
01:26:28,775 --> 01:26:31,653
- I want a word with the peace officer.
- I'll go, too.

877
01:26:31,862 --> 01:26:36,199
I'll tell the wife
to fix something for all of you.

878
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:41,914
You go inside, maybe Mrs McAlester
can fix that poor little hand of yours!

879
01:26:42,123 --> 01:26:45,168
My poor little hand can keep.

880
01:27:06,815 --> 01:27:09,234
Rooster! What are you doing here?

881
01:27:09,485 --> 01:27:11,028
Boots! Gaspargo!

882
01:27:11,236 --> 01:27:13,989
You're letting that Indian
behind you with a blade?

883
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:19,162
- 'Cause I'm an Indian.
- Plenty of scalps on Indian belts!

884
01:27:19,829 --> 01:27:22,791
If you're after Ned Pepper,
you're on a cold trail here.

885
01:27:22,999 --> 01:27:27,796
We're looking for another man, too.
Black mark on his face.

886
01:27:28,004 --> 01:27:32,842
- We think he's running with Ned.
- That's a Texan peace officer!

887
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:35,137
Ned passed through
a couple of days ago.

888
01:27:35,346 --> 01:27:38,683
Him, Haze, Mexican Bob.
Only those three were seen.

889
01:27:38,933 --> 01:27:43,980
- I know where Ned's holed up.
- You'll need 100 marshals to get him!

890
01:27:44,188 --> 01:27:46,774
My name is Mattie Ross
from Yell County.

891
01:27:47,024 --> 01:27:51,278
That man with the black mark
killed my father. He's called Chaney.

892
01:27:51,529 --> 01:27:55,826
I got Haze and some youngster
outside with Moon and Quincy.

893
01:27:56,034 --> 01:27:58,620
I want you to bury 'em for me.
I'm in a hurry.

894
01:27:58,870 --> 01:28:00,747
They're dead?

895
01:28:00,956 --> 01:28:05,293
I wouldn't want you to bury them
if they weren't!

896
01:28:05,544 --> 01:28:10,257
- What about La Beef's hand?
- Gaspargo's a good doctor, too.

897
01:28:10,465 --> 01:28:12,760
- Take care of it.
- It can wait.

898
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:18,182
- You're no good use if handicapped.
- And small use if he ain't!

899
01:28:20,476 --> 01:28:22,228
- Wash first.
- Why?

900
01:28:22,478 --> 01:28:25,898
- Don't you wash before you eat?
- Ain't gonna eat his hand.

901
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:28,901
- Don't you know about germs?
- No...

902
01:28:29,152 --> 01:28:32,781
Go wash, Gaspargo.
You lost!

903
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:46,587
That's Moon.

904
01:28:52,302 --> 01:28:54,304
Quincy.

905
01:28:57,349 --> 01:29:01,061
Haze! First time he ever stayed shot!

906
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:10,029
I know this boy. Billy Walsh.
Comes from a good family.

907
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:14,659
Hold good Billy for his folks
and bury the rest of them.

908
01:29:14,867 --> 01:29:18,496
I'll post their names. If anyone
wants them, they can dig them up.

909
01:29:18,704 --> 01:29:24,627
Sell their horses, coats, guns
and saddles, and I'll split it with you.

910
01:29:24,877 --> 01:29:28,006
You told Moon
you'd send money to his brother.

911
01:29:28,256 --> 01:29:33,845
- I forget where to send it.
- The Methodist church, Austin.

912
01:29:34,054 --> 01:29:37,140
Are you sure it was Austin
and not Dallas?

913
01:29:37,391 --> 01:29:39,851
You know it was Austin!

914
01:29:40,394 --> 01:29:42,270
Write it out for the captain.

915
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,901
Boots, send this man $10
and tell him he's buried here.

916
01:29:47,151 --> 01:29:50,780
I'll do that. So this man shot
Ned Pepper's horse?

917
01:29:50,989 --> 01:29:55,451
Yeah, this is the famous
horse-killer from El Paso!

918
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:59,998
He believes in putting everybody
afoot. Less mischief that way.

919
01:30:00,248 --> 01:30:02,208
Fewer horses, fewer horse-thieves!

920
01:30:02,417 --> 01:30:04,420
How's your hand?

921
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,880
Both rifle and hand
are ready to shoot again.

922
01:30:07,089 --> 01:30:09,550
Straighter than before, I hope!

923
01:30:09,758 --> 01:30:11,510
Well, sister!

924
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,471
The time has come
for me to ride hard and fast.

925
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,851
You stay here with the McAlesters,
and I'll be back soon with Chaney.

926
01:30:19,101 --> 01:30:21,979
- You can't get shed of me.
- She's come this far.

927
01:30:22,187 --> 01:30:25,358
- It's far enough.
- I won't quit when we're so close.

928
01:30:25,608 --> 01:30:29,821
There's something in what
she's saying. She's won her spurs.

929
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:32,115
Let it go. I've said my piece.

930
01:30:32,365 --> 01:30:36,828
- No more talk of "winning spurs"!
- I'm going.

931
01:30:37,078 --> 01:30:40,123
Not because you say I can or can't.

932
01:30:40,373 --> 01:30:43,669
I paid good money to be here,
and I'm on my own business.

933
01:30:43,878 --> 01:30:47,548
We'll have no more talk about it!

934
01:30:47,798 --> 01:30:50,176
Let's eat!

935
01:31:31,511 --> 01:31:33,513
What are you doing?

936
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:36,974
Looking for a sign.

937
01:31:37,183 --> 01:31:39,228
You couldn't see it if you saw it!

938
01:31:41,021 --> 01:31:43,023
We'll walk a ways.

939
01:32:19,729 --> 01:32:22,648
You looking for a sign again?

940
01:32:23,566 --> 01:32:25,735
It was Bo.

941
01:32:25,985 --> 01:32:28,154
He put his foot wrong.

942
01:32:28,404 --> 01:32:30,406
He's tired.

943
01:32:32,908 --> 01:32:35,704
This is no grade.

944
01:32:35,912 --> 01:32:41,209
I've freighted iron stoves up
harder grades than this.

945
01:32:49,843 --> 01:32:51,678
We'll camp here.

946
01:32:59,854 --> 01:33:01,898
Here...

947
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:15,704
I was a pretty fair hand with a jerk-line
when I was freighting in Colorado.

948
01:33:17,456 --> 01:33:23,212
I worked for a fella that was
always down with something.

949
01:33:26,548 --> 01:33:32,347
He was carrying a 21-foot tapeworm
with his business responsibilities.

950
01:33:32,555 --> 01:33:37,936
That aged him!
His wife commenced running things.

951
01:33:38,144 --> 01:33:43,066
I wasn't about to work for her,
so I told her so.

952
01:33:44,818 --> 01:33:47,821
Women have no generosity.

953
01:33:48,071 --> 01:33:52,076
Lord God, how they hate to pay up!

954
01:33:54,245 --> 01:33:59,166
A man will never work for a woman
unless he's got clabber for brains!

955
01:33:59,417 --> 01:34:01,544
What about the $25 I paid you?

956
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,798
What $25?

957
01:34:06,007 --> 01:34:09,594
I will not bandy words with a drunkard!

958
01:34:09,845 --> 01:34:13,765
That's real smart. You've done
nothing when you've bested a fool.

959
01:34:16,685 --> 01:34:21,273
We have come nearly 50 miles
from McAlester's.

960
01:34:21,523 --> 01:34:24,359
We're close to Ned Pepper's camp.

961
01:34:24,609 --> 01:34:27,530
Tomorrow we'll take him.

962
01:35:05,653 --> 01:35:09,616
If we're as close as you say,
I don't think you should make a fire.

963
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,661
Nobody asked you.

964
01:35:12,911 --> 01:35:14,412
Where are you going
with that canteen?

965
01:35:14,663 --> 01:35:16,748
Wash the sleep off me.

966
01:35:16,998 --> 01:35:20,418
We got no water to spare for that.
Just take a drink!

967
01:35:21,586 --> 01:35:24,298
I'd say there's a stream down below.

968
01:35:28,678 --> 01:35:31,347
You wash and you'll get no breakfast!

969
01:35:31,514 --> 01:35:34,225
We'll waste no more time.

970
01:35:34,433 --> 01:35:36,477
Shouldn't one of us go down with her?

971
01:35:36,686 --> 01:35:38,729
It might not be safe.

972
01:35:38,938 --> 01:35:42,025
It's safer for her
than whatever she meets...

973
01:35:42,275 --> 01:35:44,236
...man or beast!

974
01:36:48,595 --> 01:36:52,015
I know you. Little Mattie.

975
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:55,393
And I know you, Tom Chaney.

976
01:36:55,602 --> 01:36:59,899
What are you doing? There's
no money for you to squeeze here.

977
01:37:00,983 --> 01:37:04,570
- I came to fetch water.
- That was not my meaning.

978
01:37:10,951 --> 01:37:13,954
I'm here to take you back
to Fort Smith and hang you.

979
01:37:14,205 --> 01:37:17,167
I won't go.
How do you like that?

980
01:37:18,377 --> 01:37:21,963
There's a posse of officers
up the hill that'll force you to go.

981
01:37:22,214 --> 01:37:27,260
- How many officers?
- I'd say 50, and they mean business.

982
01:37:27,511 --> 01:37:30,389
So you just walk
right in front of me up that hill.

983
01:37:31,098 --> 01:37:35,228
I think I'll oblige
those officers to come after me.

984
01:37:35,436 --> 01:37:38,231
If you refuse, I'll have to shoot you.

985
01:37:38,731 --> 01:37:40,858
Is that so?

986
01:37:41,067 --> 01:37:43,111
You'd better cock your piece.

987
01:37:45,988 --> 01:37:48,783
All the way back until it locks.

988
01:37:50,284 --> 01:37:52,329
I know how to do it.

989
01:37:53,038 --> 01:37:56,375
You're saying you won't go
with me of your own free will?

990
01:37:57,668 --> 01:38:02,006
You just got it the other way around.
Now you follow me!

991
01:38:11,516 --> 01:38:15,186
- I didn't think you'd do it.
- Sis!

992
01:38:15,395 --> 01:38:19,649
- Where are you?
- I'm down here. I got Chaney!

993
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:23,778
I just didn't think you'd do it!

994
01:38:24,612 --> 01:38:26,740
One of my short ribs is broken!

995
01:38:26,948 --> 01:38:30,619
You killed my father,
when he was trying to help you.

996
01:38:30,828 --> 01:38:32,872
You're just a piece of trash.

997
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:37,543
You also killed a senator in Texas,
when he was sitting on a porch swing.

998
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:41,630
Everything happens to me.
And now I'm shot by a child!

999
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:44,592
I'll shoot you again if you don't get up!

1000
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,137
My father took you in
when you were hungry.

1001
01:39:02,027 --> 01:39:05,697
Little busybody! I'll teach you
a lesson you'll never forget.

1002
01:39:05,947 --> 01:39:07,992
Sis! Sis!

1003
01:39:08,576 --> 01:39:10,411
Hurry up! Down here!

1004
01:39:17,085 --> 01:39:19,128
Take her and go!

1005
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,983
Up the hill with the horses
and don't stop!

1006
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,195
Who holds out there?

1007
01:39:43,404 --> 01:39:47,158
Marshal Rooster Cogburn
and fifty other armed officers.

1008
01:39:47,367 --> 01:39:50,787
Tell me another lie
and I'll stove in your head!

1009
01:39:53,665 --> 01:39:56,292
The truth! Who's out there?

1010
01:39:56,501 --> 01:40:00,255
Marshal Rooster Cogburn
and a Texas Ranger.

1011
01:40:05,386 --> 01:40:06,846
<i>Rooster!</i>

1012
01:40:07,054 --> 01:40:09,015
<i>Rooster, can you hear me?</i>

1013
01:40:09,265 --> 01:40:14,061
You better answer or I'll kill this girl!
You know I'll do it!

1014
01:40:14,311 --> 01:40:16,355
<i>You want me to kill her?</i>

1015
01:40:17,648 --> 01:40:20,109
Do what you think is best, Ned!

1016
01:40:20,359 --> 01:40:21,694
Why, you...

1017
01:40:25,323 --> 01:40:28,744
She's nothing to me!
Nothing but a runaway!

1018
01:40:28,994 --> 01:40:31,788
You and that ranger
get moving double fast!

1019
01:40:31,997 --> 01:40:36,334
If I see you riding over
that north ridge, I'll spare the girl.

1020
01:40:36,543 --> 01:40:38,170
You got five minutes!

1021
01:40:39,046 --> 01:40:43,301
- We'll need more than five minutes.
- I won't give you any more.

1022
01:40:45,094 --> 01:40:49,140
There'll be a party of marshals
coming soon.

1023
01:40:49,349 --> 01:40:54,645
You give me Tom Chaney,
and I'll mislead them for six hours.

1024
01:40:54,854 --> 01:40:57,732
Throw in that spitfire of a girl, too.

1025
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,985
Too thin, Rooster, too thin!

1026
01:41:00,527 --> 01:41:02,654
I won't trust you.

1027
01:41:02,863 --> 01:41:05,616
Your five minutes are running.
You better move!

1028
01:41:06,617 --> 01:41:11,246
All right, we're moving,
but we need more than five minutes.

1029
01:41:15,167 --> 01:41:20,924
I never busted a cap on a woman
or nobody under sixteen. But I'll do it.

1030
01:41:21,674 --> 01:41:23,885
I'm Mattie Ross of Yell County.

1031
01:41:24,094 --> 01:41:27,931
My family has property.
Why am I being treated like this?

1032
01:41:28,139 --> 01:41:33,353
Well, it's enough that you know
I'll do what I have to do.

1033
01:41:37,733 --> 01:41:41,237
I saw you shot.
Where are your wounds?

1034
01:41:41,445 --> 01:41:45,116
My wounds heal by themselves
from inside.

1035
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:51,580
You and Harold stay here,
keep a watch out below.

1036
01:41:51,831 --> 01:41:56,878
Keep this turkeycock quiet
or we'll have him for supper.

1037
01:41:57,129 --> 01:41:59,756
Why don't you shut up?!

1038
01:42:04,302 --> 01:42:05,929
Is he simple-minded?

1039
01:42:06,138 --> 01:42:08,849
They're all touched,
but Harold's the worst.

1040
01:42:09,057 --> 01:42:13,520
No, their ma's the worst, then
his brother. But they're all good shots.

1041
01:42:38,047 --> 01:42:39,381
Get down!

1042
01:42:40,257 --> 01:42:42,301
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1043
01:42:42,551 --> 01:42:45,888
No, you won't.
Go and get those horses saddled!

1044
01:42:46,138 --> 01:42:49,808
Lend him a hand.
You sit there and be still.

1045
01:43:02,113 --> 01:43:04,157
Your five minutes is up,
they better show.

1046
01:43:04,366 --> 01:43:08,995
- What are you doing here?
- Chaney shot my father to death.

1047
01:43:09,204 --> 01:43:11,415
I was told Rooster Cogburn has grit.

1048
01:43:11,624 --> 01:43:14,960
I hired him to go after the murderer.
I shot him myself.

1049
01:43:15,169 --> 01:43:19,382
If I'd killed him, I wouldn't be in this fix.
My gun misfired.

1050
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:21,550
Well, they will do it.

1051
01:43:21,759 --> 01:43:24,762
Most girls like to play pretties,
but you like guns.

1052
01:43:25,554 --> 01:43:28,808
If I did, I'd have one that worked.

1053
01:43:29,016 --> 01:43:32,104
I'll give them a little more time.

1054
01:43:32,354 --> 01:43:35,857
- Did Rooster waylay us last night?
- Yes.

1055
01:43:36,316 --> 01:43:40,529
- Did he take Quincy and Moon?
- They're both dead.

1056
01:43:40,737 --> 01:43:44,491
It was terrible to see.
Do you need a good lawyer?

1057
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:47,160
I need a good judge.

1058
01:43:47,411 --> 01:43:51,791
That man called Haze, he's dead, too.
And the boy that saved your life.

1059
01:43:51,999 --> 01:43:56,963
I'm happy he did what he did, but
he should've looked out for himself.

1060
01:43:57,213 --> 01:44:00,174
That goes for your good friend,
Rooster.

1061
01:44:00,383 --> 01:44:02,593
<i>Hey, Ned!</i>

1062
01:44:44,262 --> 01:44:47,058
Rooster Cogburn
is no good friend of mine.

1063
01:44:47,266 --> 01:44:49,477
He's a drunken, gabbing fool.

1064
01:44:49,727 --> 01:44:54,690
He led us right into your hands
and left me with a gang of cut-throats.

1065
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:57,318
They call that grit in Fort Smith?

1066
01:44:57,568 --> 01:45:01,322
We call it something else
in Yell County.

1067
01:45:07,579 --> 01:45:10,707
I was shot from ambush
by one of those officers.

1068
01:45:10,916 --> 01:45:13,668
How can you tell a big story like that?

1069
01:45:13,877 --> 01:45:18,090
We're five men and four horses.
Chaney stays. You lost the horse.

1070
01:45:18,298 --> 01:45:21,051
I'll send someone to get you
with a fresh mount.

1071
01:45:21,259 --> 01:45:23,638
I'm not staying with Chaney.

1072
01:45:23,888 --> 01:45:26,099
He won't harm you. Understand?

1073
01:45:26,307 --> 01:45:30,853
Rooster gave us six hours
if we keep her safe. If you don't...

1074
01:45:31,062 --> 01:45:33,106
...you don't get paid!

1075
01:45:33,356 --> 01:45:35,650
- Let me ride with you, Farrell.
- No!

1076
01:45:35,858 --> 01:45:37,985
- How about you, Bob?
- No!

1077
01:45:38,236 --> 01:45:40,446
- Harold?
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!

1078
01:45:40,655 --> 01:45:45,786
- Do it again, Harold! Do a goat!
- Baa! Baa!

1079
01:45:50,582 --> 01:45:53,919
We'll see you tonight at Maw's.

1080
01:46:12,814 --> 01:46:16,651
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting water to wash my hands.

1081
01:46:16,901 --> 01:46:19,113
A little smut won't hurt you.

1082
01:46:19,363 --> 01:46:22,783
True. Or else you lot
would surely be dead!

1083
01:46:23,034 --> 01:46:24,994
Don't provoke me.

1084
01:46:25,244 --> 01:46:30,374
There's rattlesnakes in that pit,
and I'll throw you in it!

1085
01:47:00,823 --> 01:47:06,746
Ned Pepper said if you molest me,
he'll not pay you. He's your boss.

1086
01:47:06,954 --> 01:47:11,417
He's no idea of paying me.
He left me knowing I'd be caught.

1087
01:47:11,667 --> 01:47:16,382
If you let me go now,
I'll keep silent about you for two days.

1088
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:19,843
I can do better.
I can shut you up forever!

1089
01:47:30,312 --> 01:47:32,773
All right, Chaney. That's enough.

1090
01:47:34,067 --> 01:47:36,111
Get your hands up.

1091
01:47:46,162 --> 01:47:48,873
- Get over there.
- Everything's against me.

1092
01:47:49,082 --> 01:47:51,918
- You hurt, Mattie?
- I'm the one that's hurt!

1093
01:47:52,127 --> 01:47:56,507
- Where's Rooster?
- Below, in a place we can watch.

1094
01:47:56,716 --> 01:48:00,469
- Where's Little Blackie?
- Rooster's got him.

1095
01:48:00,678 --> 01:48:03,889
Get over there and stay over there.

1096
01:48:07,393 --> 01:48:11,690
Watch out, he said
there are snakes in that hole.

1097
01:48:50,689 --> 01:48:52,316
Where's the girl?

1098
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:56,987
In wonderful health the last I saw her.
I don't know now.

1099
01:48:57,237 --> 01:48:59,948
Answer for her now. Where is she?

1100
01:49:00,157 --> 01:49:02,868
Rooster! Make a run for it!

1101
01:49:03,077 --> 01:49:05,954
I got Mattie. Chaney, too!

1102
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:11,544
Will you give us the road?
I have business elsewhere.

1103
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:16,716
Farrell, you and your brother
stand clear.

1104
01:49:16,966 --> 01:49:21,054
I got no interest in you today.
Stand clear, you won't get hurt.

1105
01:49:21,262 --> 01:49:24,599
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

1106
01:49:24,849 --> 01:49:28,604
You think one on four's a dogfall?

1107
01:49:30,648 --> 01:49:33,359
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.

1108
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:39,323
Or see you hanged at Judge Parker's
convenience. Which will it be?

1109
01:49:39,532 --> 01:49:44,871
I call that bold talk
for a one-eyed fat man!

1110
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:48,166
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!

1111
01:49:55,799 --> 01:49:58,719
- Shoot them!
- Too far, moving too fast.

1112
01:50:03,891 --> 01:50:07,311
No grit? Rooster Cogburn? Not much!

1113
01:51:09,168 --> 01:51:11,212
Well, Rooster...

1114
01:51:12,296 --> 01:51:14,006
I'm shot to pieces.

1115
01:51:22,015 --> 01:51:25,435
Hurray for the man from Texas!
Some bully shot!

1116
01:51:37,532 --> 01:51:39,659
Damn you, Bo.

1117
01:51:39,867 --> 01:51:44,497
First time you ever give me
reason to... cuss you!

1118
01:52:40,306 --> 01:52:42,516
Help me!

1119
01:52:45,895 --> 01:52:49,315
Help me, I'm in the pit!

1120
01:52:51,567 --> 01:52:53,945
There's a snake down here
and a skeleton.

1121
01:52:54,196 --> 01:53:00,035
There'll be another one before long.
A little spindly one.

1122
01:53:00,285 --> 01:53:01,870
How do you like it?

1123
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:03,872
Help me. Help me.

1124
01:53:06,875 --> 01:53:09,252
Please help me!

1125
01:53:09,461 --> 01:53:12,215
Are you saying you don't like it?

1126
01:53:21,974 --> 01:53:23,851
Baby sister!

1127
01:53:35,864 --> 01:53:40,244
- Are you down there, sis?
- Yes, hurry! I'm in a bad way!

1128
01:53:40,452 --> 01:53:43,080
All right, hold on.

1129
01:53:49,838 --> 01:53:55,343
I'm gonna pitch you a rope.
Slip it under your arms and tie a knot.

1130
01:53:55,552 --> 01:53:59,055
I can't! I'm caught
and my arm is broken.

1131
01:53:59,305 --> 01:54:02,100
There are snakes down here.

1132
01:54:20,494 --> 01:54:22,204
It's in here now!

1133
01:54:46,939 --> 01:54:48,983
Hang on right here.

1134
01:54:59,243 --> 01:55:01,621
When you need a damn Texan,
he's dead!

1135
01:55:01,871 --> 01:55:06,251
I ain't dead yet, you bushwacker!
Hang on!

1136
01:55:15,177 --> 01:55:17,221
I want Papa's gun.

1137
01:55:23,770 --> 01:55:28,149
- I want the other gold piece, too.
- You sure you don't want the snake?

1138
01:55:28,358 --> 01:55:31,444
- No. But I want the gold piece.
- Forget it.

1139
01:55:31,653 --> 01:55:33,863
But it's mine and I want it!

1140
01:56:33,009 --> 01:56:37,806
That Texican... saved my neck twice.

1141
01:56:38,015 --> 01:56:40,559
Once after he was dead.

1142
01:56:42,394 --> 01:56:47,691
We'll have to do something
about this snakebite in a hurry.

1143
01:57:42,332 --> 01:57:44,876
Hold this arm up, little sister.

1144
01:58:03,646 --> 01:58:07,817
- We can't leave him like this.
- I'm the one that's leaving him.

1145
01:58:08,025 --> 01:58:12,156
If I don't get you a doctor,
you'll be deader than he is.

1146
01:58:13,699 --> 01:58:18,662
- Little Blackie can't carry us both.
- He'll have to. He's all I could catch.

1147
01:58:52,323 --> 01:58:53,824
Stop it!

1148
01:58:54,033 --> 01:58:56,327
We must stop, he's played out!

1149
01:59:01,874 --> 01:59:04,001
Stop it! You're killing him!

1150
02:00:16,953 --> 02:00:18,538
Hold it!

1151
02:00:18,747 --> 02:00:21,916
Fling them guns into that creek!

1152
02:00:23,335 --> 02:00:26,213
I'm borrowing this wagon off you.

1153
02:01:15,932 --> 02:01:17,975
Boots! Finch!

1154
02:01:30,322 --> 02:01:31,657
Boots!

1155
02:01:32,699 --> 02:01:34,034
Boots!

1156
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:17,330
Am I addressing
Marshal Reuben J Cogburn?

1157
02:02:17,539 --> 02:02:22,252
You're addressing him, Chen Lee
and General Sterling Price.

1158
02:02:22,502 --> 02:02:26,089
Well... l'll not ask which is which.

1159
02:02:26,339 --> 02:02:28,467
But I'll identify myself.

1160
02:02:29,342 --> 02:02:31,887
I am lawyer, J Noble Daggett.

1161
02:02:33,514 --> 02:02:36,267
- I'll be damned!
- What?

1162
02:02:36,476 --> 02:02:41,105
Well, you're not...
exactly what we expected.

1163
02:02:41,355 --> 02:02:43,566
You're a little... You're shrunk!

1164
02:02:44,066 --> 02:02:45,693
I'll tell you frankly.

1165
02:02:45,902 --> 02:02:50,073
I fully intended to have you jailed,
and I'm just the man who could do it.

1166
02:02:50,281 --> 02:02:54,119
But when Mattie told me the straight
of the matter, I had second thoughts.

1167
02:02:54,369 --> 02:02:57,539
I still think you showed
poor judgement in this affair,

1168
02:02:57,748 --> 02:03:00,542
but you're not the scoundrel
I took you for.

1169
02:03:00,751 --> 02:03:05,255
You have my thanks and,
with certain reservations, my respect.

1170
02:03:05,464 --> 02:03:08,675
How nice! How is sis?

1171
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:12,055
Gravely ill, I'm afraid.

1172
02:03:12,263 --> 02:03:15,767
But still able to direct her affairs.

1173
02:03:16,017 --> 02:03:21,773
She commissioned me
to pay you the balance of the $75 due.

1174
02:03:23,691 --> 02:03:28,571
- She didn't ask for a receipt, did she?
- As a matter of fact, she did.

1175
02:03:30,408 --> 02:03:34,787
You will find that it also covers
an additional $200...

1176
02:03:35,037 --> 02:03:36,997
...for saving her life.

1177
02:03:37,206 --> 02:03:39,750
<i>Well, I will be damned!</i>

1178
02:03:39,959 --> 02:03:44,922
She says that when she goes home,
she wants you to take her there.

1179
02:03:45,131 --> 02:03:49,553
Poor child does not know
how ill she really is.

1180
02:03:49,761 --> 02:03:53,890
Lawyer, J Noble Daggett,
are you a betting man?

1181
02:03:54,099 --> 02:03:55,892
On occasion.

1182
02:03:56,143 --> 02:04:02,566
All of this and General Price,
that she makes it back to Yell County.

1183
02:04:05,944 --> 02:04:07,738
Oh, no!

1184
02:04:07,989 --> 02:04:10,032
No, sir, no, sir!

1185
02:04:22,795 --> 02:04:26,300
Why didn't you look up
La Beef's girl in Waco?

1186
02:04:26,550 --> 02:04:29,261
I did the best I could.

1187
02:04:29,470 --> 02:04:32,181
I took the boy home
to be buried in his ranger's suit.

1188
02:04:32,389 --> 02:04:36,143
No girl showed up.
I don't believe there was one.

1189
02:04:36,351 --> 02:04:38,896
You were too busy
collecting the reward.

1190
02:04:39,146 --> 02:04:44,819
I was just a little busy. They forgot
how much the reward was.

1191
02:04:45,028 --> 02:04:49,908
- I had to help them remember.
- I can imagine how you did that!

1192
02:04:52,786 --> 02:04:55,955
This is what I wanted you to see.

1193
02:04:56,206 --> 02:04:59,292
Papa's marker was
not what was ordered.

1194
02:04:59,501 --> 02:05:03,714
I had to make
that fool of a stoneman change it.

1195
02:05:06,926 --> 02:05:10,429
Some day, Mama will be here.

1196
02:05:10,679 --> 02:05:13,808
And my brother
and his family over there.

1197
02:05:14,016 --> 02:05:17,436
And that is for my sister
and her family.

1198
02:05:18,729 --> 02:05:23,068
And I will be here,
on the other side of Papa.

1199
02:05:23,276 --> 02:05:26,947
It's comforting to know
where we'll meet eternity.

1200
02:05:30,117 --> 02:05:33,453
I would like you
to rest beside me, Rooster.

1201
02:05:35,247 --> 02:05:40,293
Now, sis, that place
should be for your family,

1202
02:05:40,544 --> 02:05:43,506
your husband, kids...

1203
02:05:50,304 --> 02:05:54,517
You have no kin.
I don't count Chen Lee and the cat.

1204
02:05:54,725 --> 02:05:57,979
Where would you end up?
A neglected patch of weeds?

1205
02:05:58,813 --> 02:06:01,859
I might just take you up
on that offer, sis.

1206
02:06:02,067 --> 02:06:05,237
Excuse me
if I don't try to move in too soon.

1207
02:06:07,030 --> 02:06:09,908
I think it's only right
that you have Papa's gun.

1208
02:06:10,117 --> 02:06:14,288
- It might keep you alive.
- I'm not so sure about that.

1209
02:06:14,496 --> 02:06:17,249
Almost got you killed
when it misfired once!

1210
02:06:17,458 --> 02:06:20,003
Because you loaded it wrong
in a state of drunkenness.

1211
02:06:20,253 --> 02:06:23,590
- I ought to get you to show me how.
- I will.

1212
02:06:28,970 --> 02:06:33,516
- Trust you to buy another tall horse.
- Yeah...

1213
02:06:33,725 --> 02:06:39,356
He's not as game as Bo, but Stonehill
says he can jump a four-rail fence!

1214
02:06:39,565 --> 02:06:44,111
You're too old and too fat
to be jumping horses!

1215
02:06:46,322 --> 02:06:50,534
Well, come to see
a fat old man some time.
