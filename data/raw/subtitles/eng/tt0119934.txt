1
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:11,808
Bobby, let's take a pan left now.

2
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:12,845
Left!

3
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,174
Your other left.

4
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,681
Hello.

5
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:17,515
Close that door.

6
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,579
Stand by to cue the suits.
We're coming to 6 next.

7
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,282
Get the VTls ready.

8
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:25,024
Thank you.

9
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:28,255
All right. lrvo, you're on 228.

10
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:29,691
Philly, you're on 904.

11
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,664
Johnny, you're on 274.
And Vic, on 61.

12
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:34,668
Ready to cue Jones.

13
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,374
Cue Jones! Take 6!

14
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,643
<i>Hello, and welcome to</i>
<i>the Olympic Stadium.</i>

15
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:45,713
<i>This is Charlie Jones,</i>
<i>along with Fred Long...</i>

16
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,543
<i>... for the men's 5000 meters.</i>

17
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,616
<i>An absolutely gorgeous day.</i>

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,150
<i>This race has the potential to be...</i>

19
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:55,450
<i>... the most competitive</i>
<i>of the men's track competition.</i>

20
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:56,956
<i>Is Viren the favorite?</i>

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,062
<i>He has to be. He's been running</i>
<i>the best of anyone for 6 weeks.</i>

22
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:04,062
<i>And he is the current</i>
<i>10,000 meter champion.</i>

23
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,962
<i>He has the psychological edge.</i>

24
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:10,265
<i>Here he is, winning in</i>
<i>world-record time just a few days ago.</i>

25
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:14,135
<i>I have no specific tactic.</i>
<i>I'm just ready when the race starts.</i>

26
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,606
Take 1! Wipe it in.

27
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:19,578
<i>This is the greatest 5000 meter</i>
<i>field in Olympic history.</i>

28
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:23,412
<i>10 of these men have set</i>
<i>world records or won championships.</i>

29
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,450
Bring it in!

30
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:29,654
<i>There's a reason it was the longest</i>
<i>distance in the ancient Olympics.</i>

31
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,627
<i>Run the 5000, and you share something</i>
<i>with those who've run it before.</i>

32
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:36,458
<i>- What is that?</i>
<i>- Pain.</i>

33
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,931
<i>13 minutes of pain that only they know.</i>

34
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:43,470
<i>So it'll be a Finnish policeman,</i>
<i>a Belgian gardener, a Tunisian soldier...</i>

35
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:46,643
<i>... and ironically, here in Munich,</i>
<i>from Coos Bay, Oregon...</i>

36
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:50,472
<i>... a millworker's son raised</i>
<i>in a German-speaking household.</i>

37
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:53,047
<i>When I talked to Stewart</i>
<i>and Prefontaine...</i>

38
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,276
<i>... I asked them how they thought</i>
<i>the race might unfold.</i>

39
00:02:56,486 --> 00:03:00,786
<i>It'll probably be down to Viren</i>
<i>and myself, with Prefontaine...</i>

40
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:02,618
...trying to chase us down.

41
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:05,021
<i>I'd like to</i>
<i>work it out so that...</i>

42
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:08,595
<i>... in the end, it comes down to</i>
<i>a pure guts race.</i>

43
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,491
Stand by, 4!

44
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:12,635
<i>If it is,</i>
<i>I'm the one who'll win.</i>

45
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,239
<i>14 qualifiers,</i>
<i>13 on the starting line.</i>

46
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,704
<i>Mariano Haro of Spain has withdrawn.</i>

47
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:20,035
<i>5000 meters.</i>

48
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:22,837
<i>12 and a half laps for the gold medal.</i>

49
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:24,613
<i>The gun is up.</i>

50
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,942
<i>In the fair start,</i>
<i>the thirteen finalists...</i>

51
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:30,208
<i>"Citius...</i>

52
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:31,910
<i>... Altius...</i>

53
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:33,878
<i>... Fortius. "</i>

54
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,424
<i>It means: Faster...</i>

55
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:37,456
<i>... Higher...</i>

56
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,650
<i>... Stronger.</i>

57
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:42,231
<i>It's been the motto</i>
<i>for the Olympics for 2500 years.</i>

58
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,132
<i>But it doesn't mean</i>
<i>faster, higher and stronger...</i>

59
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:48,964
<i>... than those you compete against.</i>

60
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:50,901
<i>Just "Faster...</i>

61
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,508
<i>... Higher...</i>

62
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,006
...Stronger."

63
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:58,010
<i>One runner brought this home to me.</i>

64
00:03:58,415 --> 00:03:59,814
<i>From the beginning...</i>

65
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:01,745
<i>... I tried to change him.</i>

66
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,809
<i>And from the beginning...</i>

67
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,011
<i>... he tried not to change.</i>

68
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:07,954
<i>That was our relationship.</i>

69
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,420
<i>And even that never changed.</i>

70
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:14,263
<i>He couldn't stand a crowd.</i>

71
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,694
<i>Always wanted to race out front.</i>

72
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,892
<i>Like he was trying to</i>
<i>get away from something.</i>

73
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:23,405
<i>Where and when this compulsion</i>
<i>came from...</i>

74
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:25,700
<i>... no one can say for sure.</i>

75
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:28,337
<i>Like Plato and his tale...</i>

76
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:31,639
<i>... of the world's creation,</i>
<i>I won't say absolutely...</i>

77
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:33,076
<i>... this is the truth.</i>

78
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:34,580
<i>But I will say...</i>

79
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,848
<i>... it is a likely story.</i>

80
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:39,578
We're going to get you!
You better run, boy!

81
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:41,756
- Run!
- Little German boy!

82
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,983
You're surrounded, you little Kraut!

83
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:45,718
Your mama's not here now!

84
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:49,160
There's no way of getting out!
You're surrounded!

85
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:56,128
Get back here, you Heinz!

86
00:04:57,107 --> 00:05:00,167
Where are you going now?
You're going to get tired!

87
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:03,210
Your mama ain't here now!
We're right on your heels!

88
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,469
You get him.

89
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:07,776
Get him, get him, get him!

90
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:10,978
There he is.
l got him, l got him!

91
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:15,047
<i>This is being left to</i>
<i>the fastest miler.</i>

92
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,419
<i>Prefontaine believes it's him.</i>

93
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,027
<i>So the American is now committed.</i>

94
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:24,259
<i>The American in front,</i>
<i>almost a cult in the U.S.</i>

95
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:28,460
<i>A sort of athletic Beatle.</i>
<i>There are T-shirts saying, "Go Pre."</i>

96
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,843
<i>There goes Pre.</i>
<i>Maybe this is it.</i>

97
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:35,170
<i>You can't catch me.</i>

98
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:37,972
<i>You'll never catch me.</i>
<i>You don't have the guts.</i>

99
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:54,125
l haven't seen Prefontaine.

100
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:57,300
How am l supposed to pick him
out of 200 runners?

101
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,489
You'll see him.

102
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:15,916
Holy shit!

103
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:38,736
lf Bowerman doesn't believe
in recruiting, why are we here?

104
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:41,809
Because Bowerman doesn't
believe in recruiting.

105
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,502
So he has us do it.

106
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:46,712
This is it.

107
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,257
Well, today you can
leave your shoes in the car.

108
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:03,529
They're here.

109
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,571
K enny Moore. Sixteenth in
the marathon in Mexico City.

110
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:16,569
Fourteenth, actually.

111
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,509
And Roscoe Devine.

112
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,514
A 3:57 mile...

113
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:23,352
...when Jim Ryan ran a 3:56:5.

114
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:27,545
God, is there anything worse
than being second best?

115
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,918
Thanks for coming to see me.

116
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:33,618
Mr. Dellinger.

117
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:36,761
How about an easy 10?

118
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:41,731
We left our running shoes in the car.

119
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:43,769
Want me to get them for you?

120
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:50,908
My mom's inside,
if you want something to eat.

121
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:52,374
Great, thanks.

122
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:57,181
Boy, it sure lets you know
Bowerman's a legend.

123
00:07:57,387 --> 00:08:00,049
Steve's room is like a shrine to Bill.

124
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:03,114
Oregon is the land of the Bill coaches.

125
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:05,351
Bill Hayward, Bill Dellinger...

126
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:06,856
...Bill Bowerman.

127
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:10,993
You want my boy to go
to the University?

128
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,928
Very much so.
Steve's a very special kid.

129
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:16,697
- This pace too fast for you?
- No, it's fine.

130
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:19,466
l realize l should've
started my kick sooner...

131
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:23,806
...but l still finished with an 8:41:5,
which set a national record.

132
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:25,748
Oh, man!

133
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:28,444
Actually, you might be surprised...

134
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:30,744
...but that's kind of why we're here.

135
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:35,251
- Word of talent gets around.
- Talent has nothing to do with it.

136
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:43,357
Sorry, guys.

137
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,031
l should've let you know
l was turning.

138
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:47,935
Hey, no sweat.

139
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:53,773
l'm going to get this kid.

140
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:07,415
Steve, what about coming to Oregon?

141
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:09,057
Does Bowerman want me?

142
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,557
- Absolutely.
- Oregon's the place for you.

143
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:13,661
But not enough to ask me himself?

144
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:17,924
He considers the most valuable thing
the University offers is education.

145
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:20,602
Anything else is almost immoral.

146
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:29,677
We're no big deal.

147
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:33,875
My Ray works as a carpenter,
Steve at a gas station.

148
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:38,049
After school, he can become
an insurance adjuster...

149
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:39,744
...right here in Coos Bay.

150
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:43,119
We have no time for
dreams we can't afford.

151
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:44,850
There's no cost involved.

152
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:47,291
Except dreams
that won't come true.

153
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:49,522
That's a price he's not going to pay.

154
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,723
Mrs. Prefontaine...

155
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:54,636
...your boy is Olympic stuff.

156
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:56,032
Mr. Dellinger...

157
00:09:57,307 --> 00:10:01,403
...she's not going to be convinced
about me running anywhere.

158
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:03,601
Not at...

159
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,178
...Stanford...

160
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:07,843
...or Pennsylvania or lowa...

161
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:09,575
...Villanova, Brown...

162
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,344
...Nebraska.

163
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:14,715
But she doesn't have to be convinced.

164
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:15,788
l do.

165
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:19,923
Only one guy at Oregon can do that,
and he hasn't bothered to try.

166
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,722
His recruiting philosophy...

167
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,367
Mr. Dellinger, l've got 3 weeks
to sign my letter of intent...

168
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:28,935
...before l lose my slot
at any worthwhile college.

169
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:31,404
So here's my philosophy:

170
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:35,269
l don't go near Eugene unless
Bowerman personally tells me...

171
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:36,911
...he wants me.

172
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:51,751
l know. l understand that,
Bill, please, but...

173
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:55,462
Bill, please listen to me,
for God's sake.

174
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,057
Everybody in the country...

175
00:10:58,268 --> 00:10:59,963
...is offering him the moon.

176
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,331
All he wants from you
is one word...

177
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:04,564
...to know you want to coach him.

178
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,833
That's it.
He just wants to know.

179
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:35,828
Shit!

180
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:07,567
Just get an education.

181
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,362
That would be nice too.

182
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,244
<i>If you do us the honor of attending</i>
<i>the University of Oregon...</i>

183
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:20,448
<i>... there is no doubt...</i>

184
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,983
<i>... that you can be the nation's</i>
<i>finest distance runner.</i>

185
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:25,882
<i>Perhaps the world's.</i>

186
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,216
<i>Sincerely, William J. Bowerman.</i>

187
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:34,594
Yes, sir!

188
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:45,832
lt's good that way. You'll have
3 classes in a row, then a break.

189
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,873
Excuse me! l'm sorry!

190
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:50,170
Where is McArthur Court?
Do you know?

191
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:02,722
Right.

192
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,354
Thank you!

193
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:05,693
You're welcome.

194
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:07,659
Numb nuts!

195
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:26,874
Hey, Roscoe.

196
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:29,412
Here l am. l made it.

197
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,780
So is everybody here
to see Bowerman?

198
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,717
ls that where he is?

199
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:37,184
Right behind there.

200
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:39,293
Does everybody here run distance?

201
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:43,625
Maybe you could give me
a couple of tips about Bowerman.

202
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,362
He's a little touchy.

203
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,468
- About what?
- Working out too hard.

204
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,932
Or not hard enough.

205
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:50,696
lt all depends on who.

206
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:54,399
He caught Bob sweeping his church.
Kicked him off a week.

207
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,478
Just praying would be all right.
Sweeping's too much like work.

208
00:13:58,915 --> 00:13:59,779
Seriously.

209
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:04,646
He was in ltaly, World War ll,
10th Mountain Division.

210
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:09,182
He negotiated the surrender
of the 8th German army.

211
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:10,859
All 8,000 of them.

212
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:12,827
When he commands...

213
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,658
...you obey.

214
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,602
l'm not them, and l'm
not here to surrender.

215
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:22,793
Yes, sir.

216
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:26,770
Over here.

217
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,441
Take off your shoe.

218
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:34,816
Your right one.

219
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,246
Put it down.

220
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:41,251
Put your foot on here.

221
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:46,985
You make everybody's shoes?

222
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:48,322
Everybody that runs.

223
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,799
Why? Cost?

224
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,989
Weight.

225
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:54,834
What's a good miler's stride?

226
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:56,026
Two yards.

227
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:58,870
That's 880 steps.

228
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,574
Take an ounce off a shoe...

229
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,941
...that's 880 ounces.

230
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:11,847
ln a mile, that's 55 pounds
of weight you don't have to carry.

231
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:14,714
What a good idea.

232
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:17,753
That's 110 pounds,
if you count both feet.

233
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:21,560
l already counted both feet.
Lift your foot, damn it.

234
00:15:21,764 --> 00:15:22,890
Sorry, coach.

235
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:27,893
You don't call me coach.

236
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:30,331
The meanest son of a bitch l ever met...

237
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,371
...insisted on being called that.

238
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:34,133
As we all know, l'm a...

239
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:36,678
...kind and forbearing man.

240
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:40,673
Welcome to the University of Oregon.
l'm Bill Bowerman.

241
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:42,043
l know.

242
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,385
l'm Steve Prefontaine.

243
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:46,281
l know.

244
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:49,848
Take off your other shoe, Steve.

245
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:53,586
<i>The University of Oregon's</i>
<i>physical education building...</i>

246
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:57,823
<i>... was set on fire.</i>
<i>It's believed to be in protest of...</i>

247
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:02,061
<i>... the Vietnam War, since</i>
<i>RO TC uniforms were stored there.</i>

248
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:19,220
Bob, what time is it?

249
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:20,514
7:24.

250
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:22,917
Genesis?

251
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,285
Exodus.

252
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,290
Why does Bowerman
call a team meeting for 7:27?

253
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,161
What's wrong with 7:30?

254
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:35,300
Hold on. l'll tell him why, gentlemen.

255
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:38,003
7:27 promotes the question:

256
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,469
"Why 7:27?"

257
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:43,133
And everybody gets here
at 7:27 to find out why.

258
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:48,276
When students burn a campus building...

259
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:52,215
...we must disassociate
ourselves from that behavior.

260
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:55,982
l'm not suggesting that
you support the Vietnam War...

261
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:59,650
...any more than l'm suggesting
that this university should.

262
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:02,660
l'm saying your appearance
cannot be construed...

263
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:04,423
...to support a form of protest...

264
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:07,868
...that burns down the buildings...

265
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:12,097
...of the institution that feeds,
houses and sustains us all.

266
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:17,571
So we have a little
cosmetic work ahead of us.

267
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:19,346
Haircuts.

268
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:23,546
The question before us...

269
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:25,550
...is how much to cut.

270
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:28,082
Well, Bill...

271
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,123
...this isn't going to be fair.

272
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:33,884
Why not?

273
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:39,833
What's the standard for how long
hair gets before it's offensive?

274
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:43,694
lt's a completely arbitrary length.

275
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:44,895
Right.

276
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,204
So is the length of a meter.

277
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,038
Does that make a 100 meter race unfair?

278
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:54,080
Of course not. Not when everyone
agrees on what the length is.

279
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:55,873
Then, let's all agree.

280
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:59,350
Nobody on the team will have
hair longer than his dick...

281
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:02,683
...which means everybody
gets a haircut, except Bob.

282
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:08,923
Why except Bob?

283
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:13,063
God's will, Steve.

284
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:14,667
God's will?

285
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,907
lt's just below his kneecap.

286
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:22,735
Way to go, Bob!

287
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,247
Men of Oregon...

288
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:33,144
...l invite you to become
students of your events.

289
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:35,488
Running, one might say...

290
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:37,955
...is basically an absurd pastime...

291
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,958
...upon which
to be exhausting ourselves.

292
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:44,028
But if you can find meaning...

293
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,400
...in the kind of running...

294
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:49,332
...you have to do
to stay on this team...

295
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:55,009
...chances are you can find
meaning in another absurd pastime:

296
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:57,472
Life.

297
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:14,129
Does this guy
ever have anything to say?

298
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:16,360
What guy? About what?

299
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:19,966
Bowerman. About running.
You know, like coaching.

300
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:24,895
When he's got something to say,
he usually says it.

301
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:26,368
Prefontaine!

302
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,707
Come here a minute!

303
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:36,044
Do you usually run with your butt
sticking out like that?

304
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,545
Stand up straight.

305
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:41,548
You want a plumb line to run
from your ear to your feet.

306
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:46,719
Let your hips relax.

307
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:49,494
That's how you were running.

308
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:51,431
Lift your knee.

309
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:57,068
Now cock your hips up under you.

310
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,900
Under you.

311
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:04,104
Like at the moment
of deepest penetration.

312
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:10,478
Now lift your knee.

313
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:15,047
lt's easier when you
tuck your pelvis under you.

314
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:19,384
You don't fight your body's mechanics.
Makes you more efficient.

315
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:23,123
You can put your knee down now.

316
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:27,864
<i>Gentlemen, cardinal rule:</i>

317
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,130
<i>No racing in workouts.</i>
<i>We'll do a mile at 3/4 effort.</i>

318
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,468
<i>That's 4:40, max.</i>
<i>Everyone's able to stay together.</i>

319
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,784
That's not staying together.

320
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:53,457
That's 4:30, Steve.
You're 10 seconds fast.

321
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,771
Your pulse is north of 190.

322
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:06,602
Just a rough guess...

323
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:12,109
...but l'd say you were exceeding
the agreed-upon speed limit, rube.

324
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,823
Bill, l lost a spike.

325
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:26,660
One?

326
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:32,424
- Not the ripple soles again.
- What's wrong with them?

327
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:34,967
Digging dog shit out of them,
for one thing.

328
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:37,867
l don't want to be a guinea pig.
Give them to Moore.

329
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,605
Let him try them.

330
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:42,539
l'm working on something new, Roscoe.

331
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:45,942
Urethane spikes from a special mold.

332
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,913
Light as a feather.

333
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:53,054
Looks like you got it off a waffle iron.

334
00:21:53,255 --> 00:21:55,223
lt's a very promising configuration.

335
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:58,393
l expect all my runners will try it.

336
00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:02,728
<i>Prefontaine, shown here smashing</i>
<i>the high school 2-mile record...</i>

337
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:06,732
<i>... by an amazing 7 seconds, 8:41:6...</i>

338
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:07,800
Damn it!

339
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,001
Not again!

340
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:14,169
l promised the kids waffles
for Sunday brunch.

341
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:16,175
Barbara...

342
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:19,313
...the kids are over 25, as l recollect.

343
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:21,415
Maybe they won't be traumatized...

344
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,983
...if you serve them pancakes.

345
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:26,654
Those chemicals are simply overwhelming.

346
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:28,653
They can't be good for you.

347
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,086
What are you watching?

348
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,156
The kid from Coos Bay...

349
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:34,989
...that Dellinger recruited.

350
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:37,599
Pretty impressive, isn't he?

351
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,463
He's a front-runner. He may
get away with it in high school...

352
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,162
...but at the international level
of competition it's a disaster.

353
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:50,201
Tell him not to do it.
lsn't that what coaching is for?

354
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,108
Yes, dear.

355
00:22:52,314 --> 00:22:55,750
<i>Last spring, Prefontaine smashed</i>
<i>the high school 2-mile record...</i>

356
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:57,475
<i>... by an amazing 7 seconds.</i>

357
00:22:58,654 --> 00:23:02,055
Grant me those Stanford
3-milers are no slouches...

358
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,692
...especially that fellow Kardong.

359
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:07,590
Don Kardong? He's not bad.

360
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:15,863
Front-runners cut the wind for
everybody then die in the stretch.

361
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:18,539
ln a close race
a front-runner never wins.

362
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:20,641
He's not that good, either.

363
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:22,640
Put it against the window.

364
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:24,813
What are you trying to do?
Help him?

365
00:23:25,014 --> 00:23:28,074
No. l hate those people
back there sucking on me.

366
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,079
Then why do you let them?

367
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,718
When you set the pace,
you control the race.

368
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:37,149
And the hare controls the hound.

369
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:42,391
lndulge me here...

370
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:43,929
...will you?

371
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:45,932
Saturday...

372
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:50,629
...start off easy for once in your life.

373
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:54,073
69s for the first mile.

374
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:57,109
Then drop to 67 s for the second.

375
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:00,075
Then depending on where you are
and how you feel...

376
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:04,082
l won't know that till l get there
and l'll figure it out then.

377
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:07,847
While you're doing that,
why don't you also figure out...

378
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:11,857
...what university you expect
to be running for next week.

379
00:24:15,397 --> 00:24:20,027
Has it ever occurred to you there's
such a thing as over-coaching?

380
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:21,202
Yeah.

381
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:23,337
l'm against it.

382
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,342
Shut up, Mac.

383
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:32,607
ls there a plan? Steve going out fast,
burning Kardong early?

384
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:35,841
Steve's going out in 69, no faster.

385
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:38,451
Runners, gather in here
for instructions.

386
00:24:43,258 --> 00:24:44,885
Stand behind the line.

387
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:48,058
l'll say, "Runners to your marks"
and "Set."

388
00:24:48,764 --> 00:24:50,459
Then l'll shoot the gun.

389
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,258
Good luck to you all.

390
00:25:01,844 --> 00:25:03,903
<i>The 3-mile is underway.</i>

391
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:19,089
<i>High jump bar's been raised to 6'7".</i>

392
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:20,261
<i>Next up...</i>

393
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:22,589
<i>... Kip Leonard of Stanford.</i>

394
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:37,571
<i>Prefontaine moves to the</i>
<i>early lead in the 3-mile.</i>

395
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:39,742
Look at that.

396
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:43,117
That freshman's Steve Prefontaine.

397
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:47,144
<i>First call for the mile relay.</i>
<i>First call.</i>

398
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:48,823
- Go, Ducks!
- Go, Steve!

399
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:50,316
Come on, Ducks!

400
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:52,426
You're not running the relay?

401
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:54,596
No, we're way up on them.

402
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,367
Where's everybody else?

403
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,969
Holy shit!

404
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:09,503
This is not a 69.

405
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,672
<i>Prefontaine's first lap:</i>

406
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:14,212
<i>64 seconds.</i>

407
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:17,613
Let's go check this out.

408
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,344
<i>That's world-record pace.</i>

409
00:26:25,027 --> 00:26:28,224
Oregon's Bob Wobell
is on the long jump runway.

410
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:30,565
Runway!

411
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,898
Jesus! l'm trying to jump!

412
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:38,898
ln the 3-mile, it's Prefontaine leading,
with Don Kardong second.

413
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:44,302
4: 18!

414
00:26:44,613 --> 00:26:45,545
4: 18!

415
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:48,181
<i>Steve Prefontaine's time at the mile:</i>

416
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:49,782
<i>4:18.</i>

417
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,476
<i>Two more and he'll be close...</i>

418
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:54,417
<i>... to the American 3-mile record.</i>

419
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:57,285
Two more like that
and he'll be in the hospital.

420
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:07,934
8:45, Steve!

421
00:27:08,237 --> 00:27:09,534
8:45!

422
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:17,739
8:45. He's never been here before.

423
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,540
Not with another mile to go, no.

424
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:23,149
<i>Now at the discus ring,</i>
<i>leader Mac Wilkins.</i>

425
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,898
Are they saying the rube's name?

426
00:27:41,103 --> 00:27:42,593
Could be.

427
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:46,335
<i>Mac Wilkins' last throw: 197.6.</i>

428
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:49,075
<i>A collegiate best this year.</i>

429
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,805
The crowd shouldn't be encouraging
the little showboater.

430
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:56,143
We could always try
telling them to stop!

431
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:44,056
<i>Prefontaine timed at 13:12:8.</i>

432
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:47,029
<i>That's the fastest 3-mile</i>
<i>in the world this year.</i>

433
00:28:47,236 --> 00:28:48,999
You all right, Bill?

434
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:52,265
What are you trying to tell me?

435
00:28:52,474 --> 00:28:55,841
Take your victory lap before
they tear the stadium down!

436
00:28:56,044 --> 00:28:57,375
Go on!

437
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:49,223
Little rube's a performer.

438
00:29:49,564 --> 00:29:51,088
Little rube's a star.

439
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:53,229
So much for coaching.

440
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:56,730
For Saturday's goal-setting session...

441
00:29:56,938 --> 00:29:58,428
...make Pre my last appointment.

442
00:30:13,755 --> 00:30:14,585
Come in.

443
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:22,019
l'm sorry. l'm...

444
00:30:23,632 --> 00:30:24,462
...lost.

445
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:29,031
At least you found your way
to McArthur Court.

446
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:31,538
You remember that?

447
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:37,202
l'm Steve...

448
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:38,879
Steve Prefontaine.

449
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:41,481
Mary Marckx. Nice to meet you.

450
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:44,646
l have been looking for you for months.

451
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:46,286
You have?

452
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:50,048
What are you doing here today?
You're obviously in the wrong room.

453
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,590
There was an assignment that...

454
00:30:57,699 --> 00:30:58,631
l'll do it later.

455
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:00,802
Want to grab a cup of coffee?

456
00:31:01,002 --> 00:31:02,594
- Wait a minute.
- What?

457
00:31:02,804 --> 00:31:04,169
l don't even know you.

458
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:05,733
You just said you did.

459
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:07,568
l know l just did...

460
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,743
...but l'm...

461
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,105
l'm not even dressed.

462
00:31:12,714 --> 00:31:13,806
Sure you are.

463
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:15,448
Come on. Come on.

464
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,311
Why are you in such a hurry?

465
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,282
l just love coffee.

466
00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:21,513
l don't even have shoes on.

467
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:37,997
How does this one feel?

468
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,332
Fine. Good.

469
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:43,102
- Don't say it if it doesn't fit.
- lt fits, it fits.

470
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:48,641
Would you mind getting off your knees?

471
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:03,289
Better?

472
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,793
A little.

473
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:09,834
l can't allow you to buy me these shoes.
l don't even know you.

474
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:11,505
But l get them for free.

475
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:13,037
That's not my point.

476
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:17,368
So what were you doing
at the dorm, anyway?

477
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:21,212
Go on.

478
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:25,645
l told you. l had to pick up
an assignment before...

479
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:32,257
l think l'm crazy about you, Mary.

480
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:34,258
Why?

481
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,860
Why is anybody crazy about anybody?

482
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:40,432
l asked why you're crazy about me.

483
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:45,235
There's just something
about you that l recognize.

484
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:49,436
Like "Haven't we met somewhere before?"

485
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:53,880
That we haven't met before,
but l feel we have.

486
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,083
Like you're a stranger,
but you're familiar.

487
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,626
Hey, Steve, great race.
Looking good.

488
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:09,023
Thanks.

489
00:33:17,672 --> 00:33:19,003
What do you think about me?

490
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:27,013
l don't really think you're my type.

491
00:33:51,172 --> 00:33:52,503
Pre.

492
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,364
There you are.

493
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:56,806
Why didn't you speak up?

494
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:58,979
l didn't want to disturb you.

495
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:02,782
l thought you liked disturbing me.

496
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:04,975
You do it so well.

497
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:07,788
Sit down.

498
00:34:11,993 --> 00:34:13,483
Sit down, Pre.

499
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:35,274
You know, Pre...

500
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:37,878
...it's spring...

501
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,151
...and l sense this is your week
to chase the ladies.

502
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:45,086
Do you object to that?

503
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:46,988
No. lf you catch them quick.

504
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:49,425
Chasing them wears the body out.

505
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:52,591
13: 12 for the 3 mile.

506
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,325
You satisfied?

507
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,498
l'm satisfied l did the best
l could on Saturday.

508
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:01,437
l think you could've gone
6 seconds better.

509
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,200
The first quarter cost you.

510
00:35:05,113 --> 00:35:06,205
How do you figure?

511
00:35:06,948 --> 00:35:09,075
4: 18 was too quick for the first mile.

512
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:11,775
So you dropped to 4:27 s
for the last two.

513
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:15,320
lf you'd gone out slower,
say a 4:24...

514
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:18,754
...you could've repeated the 4:24
and come home in 4: 18.

515
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,326
Made your last lap your fastest.

516
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,860
That would've added up to 13:06,
compared with the 13: 12 you ran.

517
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:29,002
Your need to take the lead
from the start...

518
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:31,570
...cost you a good 6 seconds.

519
00:35:43,652 --> 00:35:46,212
The Olympics are in 2 years.

520
00:35:46,421 --> 00:35:48,286
Blink of an eyelash.

521
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,822
You'll face the best middle-distance
runners in any games l can recall.

522
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:55,923
- lan Stewart...
- Kip Kano, Gammoudi...

523
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:58,088
They all have strong kicks.

524
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:01,462
Any of them would've had you
dead to rights on Saturday.

525
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,103
Maybe on Saturday,
but not two years from now.

526
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:09,602
Can l ask you a question,
off the record?

527
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:11,903
Were we on the record?

528
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:16,148
- Where does this compulsion come from?
- What compulsion?

529
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:17,579
Front-running.

530
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:18,946
Look, Bill...

531
00:36:19,454 --> 00:36:22,981
...running any other way
is just plain chicken shit.

532
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:24,385
Chicken shit?

533
00:36:24,592 --> 00:36:27,755
What else do you call
laying back for 21/2 miles...

534
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:30,453
...then stealing a race
in the last 200 yards?

535
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:32,189
Winning!

536
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:34,433
l don't want to do that.

537
00:36:34,636 --> 00:36:35,967
You don't want to win?

538
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:40,005
Not unless l've done my best.
The only way l know to do that...

539
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:43,666
...is to run out front and flat out
till l have nothing left!

540
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:47,177
Winning any other way is chicken shit!

541
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:01,885
What do you think a track coach does?

542
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,300
He teaches you how to run.

543
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:08,492
Run what? A factory?
A bowling alley?

544
00:37:08,703 --> 00:37:11,001
- A race.
- ln order to...?

545
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,773
Win it.

546
00:37:16,678 --> 00:37:19,340
That's pretty much what l thought too.

547
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:24,948
l don't understand you.

548
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,648
lf it's any help,
l don't understand you either.

549
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,190
<i>Testing, testing, testing.</i>

550
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:45,629
<i>Drake University and Des Moines</i>
<i>welcome you...</i>

551
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,070
<i>... to the Track and Field Championships.</i>

552
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:51,871
<i>A record 741 athletes from 110</i>
<i>universities have qualified...</i>

553
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,445
What will you throw tomorrow?

554
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:56,349
The farther the better, right?

555
00:38:07,629 --> 00:38:09,062
Gentlemen!

556
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:10,993
To the gym!

557
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:18,402
Not much of a workout.

558
00:38:18,606 --> 00:38:21,166
Hay's in the barn.
Any work you do today...

559
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:23,310
...takes away from the race tomorrow.

560
00:38:27,448 --> 00:38:30,576
Gentlemen, the race for
team title's going to be tight.

561
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:35,552
The team that scratches and claws
for every unexpected point will win.

562
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:38,089
So we're going to enter the 440 relay.

563
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:42,855
Something wrong?

564
00:38:51,773 --> 00:38:53,536
l just felt a little dizzy.

565
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:57,969
l keep telling you this heat can
fool you. You must stay hydrated.

566
00:38:58,179 --> 00:38:59,441
Go get a drink.

567
00:38:59,647 --> 00:39:01,410
Sure thing.

568
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,009
Anybody else need a drink?

569
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:24,501
That is some rug burn, cutie.

570
00:39:24,706 --> 00:39:26,697
You got them on both knees?

571
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:31,002
- l guess so.
- We've got to protect those babies.

572
00:39:32,814 --> 00:39:35,305
We could try using the bed.

573
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,414
l got a better idea.

574
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:52,325
Get over here.

575
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,433
Show me what you got.

576
00:39:57,372 --> 00:40:00,637
"For he that walketh in darkness..."

577
00:40:09,651 --> 00:40:13,610
"For he that walketh in darkness
knoweth not whither he goeth.

578
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:18,084
We have the light."

579
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,731
- Who's that?
- Shut the door.

580
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:34,067
Excuse me.

581
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:38,574
- Really sorry!
- Shut the door!

582
00:40:43,051 --> 00:40:44,643
lt's okay, sweetie.

583
00:40:44,852 --> 00:40:47,980
You're just better on
your knees than on your hands.

584
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,025
Bowerman's going to kill me.

585
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:54,216
Who?

586
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,461
How did this happen?

587
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:59,326
l got up to go to the john...

588
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:01,968
...tripped on the couch
and hit that heater.

589
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,432
How many stitches?

590
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,104
Just six.

591
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:07,733
Twelve.
Where were you, Bob?

592
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:10,673
l was at the...

593
00:41:10,878 --> 00:41:13,938
Bob went to take a walk.
Right?

594
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:16,609
l was at the...

595
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:22,821
Any word on how many
entries are in the 3-mile?

596
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:24,319
16. So what?

597
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:26,182
So there's no heats.

598
00:41:26,394 --> 00:41:29,659
l don't have to run until
the final, 3 days away.

599
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:32,495
You're not serious.

600
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:34,094
Since when?

601
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:35,495
Run?

602
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:36,897
You can't even walk.

603
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:39,471
What kind of painkillers
they give you?

604
00:41:39,674 --> 00:41:41,665
Gentlemen, clear out of here.

605
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,041
You too, Bob.

606
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:49,409
Kiss the Nationals goodbye.

607
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:53,143
There goes the team title
right down the toilet.

608
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:54,321
Shut the door!

609
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:56,717
Why don't you run the 3-mile, Russ?

610
00:41:59,761 --> 00:42:01,285
We need my 10 points...

611
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,393
...to win the Nationals.

612
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:13,498
3 miles of pounding
on a hard asphalt track...

613
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,369
...can tear your foot in two.

614
00:42:16,277 --> 00:42:17,539
lt won't.

615
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:21,476
You're in my care.

616
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,076
You don't know what it'll do
to my foot if l do run...

617
00:42:25,286 --> 00:42:27,618
...but you know what it'll do to me...

618
00:42:27,855 --> 00:42:29,379
...if l don't.

619
00:42:33,494 --> 00:42:35,860
You've got to let me try, Bill.

620
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:31,146
<i>Steve Prefontaine has clinched</i>
<i>the 1970 NCAA Championship...</i>

621
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:33,183
<i>... for Bowerman's Oregon Ducks.</i>

622
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,059
l did what l said l'd do.

623
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:41,986
At least l made you work for it.

624
00:43:43,531 --> 00:43:44,862
Jesus Christ!

625
00:43:45,633 --> 00:43:46,964
You ran like that?

626
00:43:49,871 --> 00:43:51,270
Steve, you are crazy.

627
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:58,235
You don't need to look.
Your time was a meet record.

628
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,137
Get a stretcher.

629
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:11,488
<i>That's 17 straight races...</i>

630
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,853
<i>... that Steve Prefontaine has won.</i>

631
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:23,465
We got tickets to Three Dog Night
next week. Want to come?

632
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:26,606
l'm going to Finland for a week.
Sorry.

633
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:29,099
l'll call you when l get back.

634
00:44:33,814 --> 00:44:36,282
Still in the shoe business, l see.

635
00:44:36,784 --> 00:44:39,480
l'm willing to give it up
whenever you say.

636
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,186
l told you, Steve, you're not my type.

637
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:47,359
Type? Type!
What is it with the girl?!

638
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,597
Heads up!

639
00:44:50,798 --> 00:44:54,199
Fellas, watch it!
Don't make me come back for you.

640
00:45:01,776 --> 00:45:02,765
Why not?

641
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:05,075
Why not?

642
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:06,974
l'll tell you why not.

643
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:09,943
You left my roommate
hung out to dry, for one.

644
00:45:10,151 --> 00:45:12,483
You never told me
your date was with her.

645
00:45:15,223 --> 00:45:17,623
lt wasn't a nice
thing to do and l'm sorry.

646
00:45:17,825 --> 00:45:19,816
Apologize to her, not to me.

647
00:45:20,061 --> 00:45:22,222
l will.
Then will you go out with me?

648
00:45:22,597 --> 00:45:24,690
Are you looking for rejection?

649
00:45:30,338 --> 00:45:32,238
How'd you get here so quick?

650
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,806
lmpressive, huh?
l took a shortcut.

651
00:45:35,009 --> 00:45:36,567
l do workouts...

652
00:45:37,878 --> 00:45:38,742
...through here.

653
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,840
l know everything there is
to know about this place.

654
00:45:43,317 --> 00:45:45,751
You're sitting
on a Civil War monument.

655
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:47,147
Yeah, right!

656
00:45:47,388 --> 00:45:48,719
Take a look.

657
00:45:57,431 --> 00:45:59,365
You really do work out here.

658
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:01,198
Of course.

659
00:46:02,503 --> 00:46:03,936
l wouldn't lie to you.

660
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:09,803
lt's okay.

661
00:46:10,044 --> 00:46:11,102
Just looking.

662
00:46:17,585 --> 00:46:18,916
That's pretty.

663
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:20,647
Thank you.

664
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,621
You want to walk, don't you?

665
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:31,357
Sure.

666
00:46:37,138 --> 00:46:38,696
Are you Catholic?

667
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,399
Lots of people are.

668
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,737
People say so,
but l bet you really are.

669
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:47,911
l'm not sure l understand
what you mean.

670
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:49,912
Am l being flattered or insulted?

671
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:53,018
No, it's the hardest thing
in the world...

672
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,778
...to believe in something.

673
00:46:55,222 --> 00:46:57,190
lf you do, it's a miracle.

674
00:47:22,016 --> 00:47:23,381
"Modern Behavior."

675
00:47:23,584 --> 00:47:25,677
We can drop those by the dorm.

676
00:47:26,354 --> 00:47:30,347
Someone's always trying to
talk you out of what you believe in.

677
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:36,325
Anybody. Everybody.

678
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,027
Your own mother.

679
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:43,995
Why is that, do you think?

680
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:53,210
All l know...

681
00:47:54,682 --> 00:47:59,517
...is that if you do believe in
something, you make people nervous.

682
00:48:06,427 --> 00:48:07,792
Do you believe in God?

683
00:48:07,995 --> 00:48:09,724
l believe in myself.

684
00:48:35,923 --> 00:48:38,289
l mean it.
You're not my type.

685
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:06,009
<i>This ends the KBAL broadcast day.</i>

686
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,050
<i>This is KBAL, Eugene, Oregon.</i>

687
00:49:16,464 --> 00:49:17,658
What's wrong?

688
00:49:21,902 --> 00:49:23,426
Can you say something?

689
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:25,031
Please.

690
00:49:25,706 --> 00:49:26,866
Anything?

691
00:49:35,316 --> 00:49:36,874
Can you talk now?

692
00:49:37,718 --> 00:49:39,982
Can l get you something?
Water? Coffee?

693
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:41,176
No.

694
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:47,618
l can tell you l certainly
didn't mean to upset you like this.

695
00:49:47,895 --> 00:49:50,022
- lt's okay.
- No, it's not.

696
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:53,029
Yes, it is.
lt wasn't you, it's me.

697
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:54,725
What do you mean?

698
00:49:56,337 --> 00:49:59,795
You made me feel too much,
and l can't handle it.

699
00:50:03,177 --> 00:50:05,407
Please, please, please...

700
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:18,256
Are you okay?

701
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:20,092
How do you mean?

702
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,731
Guys get sick from stopping
like that, don't they?

703
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:32,833
They do.

704
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:34,769
They can.

705
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:42,348
l don't think we should
see each other again.

706
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:45,783
l believe in waiting.

707
00:50:45,986 --> 00:50:49,547
l'm not going to sleep with you,
and l'm not going to change.

708
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:53,625
We'll just keep doing this
to each other over and over.

709
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,090
l know it's stupid,
and it isn't fair...

710
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:01,898
...for either one of us.

711
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:11,471
- You should go out with other girls.
- l do that already.

712
00:51:12,313 --> 00:51:13,405
So keep doing it.

713
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:17,840
l'd rather go out with you.

714
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:27,289
Anyway, we can do it.

715
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:30,196
No, l just don't think we should.

716
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:40,368
l'm going to Finland.

717
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:43,570
Will you see me when l get back?

718
00:51:46,347 --> 00:51:47,905
When are you leaving?

719
00:51:48,215 --> 00:51:49,477
Tomorrow...

720
00:51:49,683 --> 00:51:51,241
...after the workout.

721
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:57,783
Think of it this way.
Maybe l'll change.

722
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:00,617
Are you always so positive
about everything?

723
00:52:02,029 --> 00:52:03,621
Consider the alternative.

724
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:05,128
l do.

725
00:52:06,433 --> 00:52:09,664
ln other words, you
plan on being disappointed.

726
00:52:15,709 --> 00:52:17,904
l'm not going to disappoint you.

727
00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:35,655
Come on.

728
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:38,394
l'll get you back to your dorm.

729
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:55,079
<i>Dear Mary: Every blond</i>
<i>in Finland reminds me of you.</i>

730
00:52:55,282 --> 00:52:57,910
<i>So I pretty much</i>
<i>think of you constantly.</i>

731
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:01,412
<i>Except when I'm</i>
<i>pissed off about this tour.</i>

732
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:03,790
<i>It's run by the AAU...</i>

733
00:53:03,991 --> 00:53:07,654
<i>... the Amateur Athletic Union,</i>
<i>our national governing body.</i>

734
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:10,591
<i>Its head, Colin Ponder,</i>
<i>keeps us amateur...</i>

735
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:13,926
<i>... and uncomfortable,</i>
<i>while he hits on stewardesses...</i>

736
00:53:14,134 --> 00:53:16,762
<i>... and goes first-class all the way.</i>

737
00:53:17,304 --> 00:53:20,671
<i>Any American caught accepting</i>
<i>more than a redeye ticket...</i>

738
00:53:20,874 --> 00:53:24,674
<i>... a bad hotel and $3 a day,</i>
<i>and Colin will sanction us.</i>

739
00:53:24,878 --> 00:53:27,005
<i>He'll call us professionals...</i>

740
00:53:27,214 --> 00:53:29,705
<i>... and kill our Olympic eligibility.</i>

741
00:53:29,917 --> 00:53:34,616
<i>Amateurism is the most hypocriticaK/i>
<i>crock of horseshit in American sports.</i>

742
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:38,014
<i>We're much worse about it</i>
<i>than other countries.</i>

743
00:53:38,225 --> 00:53:42,161
<i>And nobody in America is</i>
<i>worse about it than Colin Ponder.</i>

744
00:53:42,362 --> 00:53:46,298
<i>Our new legal eagle, Frank Shorter,</i>
<i>showed Kenny and me...</i>

745
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,958
<i>... a directive where Colin</i>
<i>ordered us to switch meets...</i>

746
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,638
<i>... when the reason for this trip was...</i>

747
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,240
<i>... to beat the Finns with</i>
<i>the best times.</i>

748
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:58,570
We signed on to race
Viren and Vaatinen in Oulu...

749
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:01,213
...not a bunch of pussies
in Helsinki.

750
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:24,434
There's the asshole.

751
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:25,730
What asshole is that?

752
00:54:26,273 --> 00:54:29,709
Colin Ponder, the one who
ordered us not to run this race.

753
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:32,777
- He say anything about us being here?
- Not a word.

754
00:54:40,087 --> 00:54:41,486
You have no Finnish?

755
00:54:42,923 --> 00:54:44,413
Speak Finnish?

756
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:53,361
"Shorter, Moore and Prefontaine...

757
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:56,001
...are required to run in Helsinki."

758
00:55:01,408 --> 00:55:04,434
We're going to run here,
today, in Oulu...

759
00:55:04,645 --> 00:55:06,738
...against Vaatinen and Viren.

760
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:08,671
No, no, Helsinki.

761
00:55:08,882 --> 00:55:09,780
Oulu.

762
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,415
Helsinki.

763
00:55:16,824 --> 00:55:20,021
They're about to start our race,
so listen to me!

764
00:55:20,227 --> 00:55:24,994
We came all the way from Eugene, Oregon
to run against those two guys.

765
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:28,168
Not a bunch of pussies in Helsinki!

766
00:55:41,715 --> 00:55:42,545
Ponder what?

767
00:55:42,749 --> 00:55:44,842
Sanctioned us and contaminated them.

768
00:55:45,052 --> 00:55:48,852
Anyone who runs against us
loses international eligibility.

769
00:55:52,259 --> 00:55:54,420
- Wonderful.
- You're not God!

770
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:56,159
He's crazy.

771
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,430
This is not even your country!

772
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:03,762
- You don't pay taxes here!
- What are you talking about?

773
00:56:03,971 --> 00:56:05,962
You make me ashamed to be American!

774
00:56:06,173 --> 00:56:07,800
You don't have the right to...

775
00:56:08,008 --> 00:56:10,568
...run their races
and run our lives!

776
00:56:12,512 --> 00:56:13,501
You're not God...

777
00:56:13,714 --> 00:56:15,705
...you overbearing asshole!

778
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:17,843
Get off me!

779
00:56:18,051 --> 00:56:19,416
Pre, calm down!

780
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:33,964
What the hell are you trying to do?

781
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:36,563
Sweat.

782
00:56:38,538 --> 00:56:41,473
lt wasn't hot enough
for him in Finland.

783
00:56:42,843 --> 00:56:44,970
World's latest press conference.

784
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:48,204
World here says he's
ashamed of being American.

785
00:56:48,649 --> 00:56:51,140
You believe
everything you read there?

786
00:56:53,854 --> 00:56:54,878
What did you say?

787
00:56:55,088 --> 00:56:58,546
l said that the AAU
should've been shitcanned in 1920.

788
00:56:58,892 --> 00:57:01,383
And we don't need them.
They need us.

789
00:57:01,595 --> 00:57:03,324
They don't need us.
They got us.

790
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,725
The AAU's our governing body.

791
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:08,595
Organize against them,
and goodbye Olympics.

792
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:12,033
Shorter found out why
they shifted us to Helsinki.

793
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:15,298
Colin Ponder
extracted a little fee...

794
00:57:15,509 --> 00:57:19,343
...from the Helsinki promoter
to guarantee our appearance.

795
00:57:19,546 --> 00:57:20,410
How much?

796
00:57:22,282 --> 00:57:23,249
Tell them.

797
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:26,044
Between me, Pre and K enny, $ 10,000.

798
00:57:29,256 --> 00:57:31,281
And they give us $3 a day...

799
00:57:31,525 --> 00:57:32,958
...for everything!

800
00:57:33,593 --> 00:57:37,029
But better competition
means bigger gate receipts.

801
00:57:37,431 --> 00:57:41,060
So we point out to foreign
meet promoters that the AAU...

802
00:57:41,268 --> 00:57:44,237
...is not only shitty
for our competition...

803
00:57:44,438 --> 00:57:48,397
...it's shitty for their box office.
And money talks!

804
00:57:48,608 --> 00:57:52,066
Louder than the AAU guys,
and in any language.

805
00:57:53,046 --> 00:57:55,241
Contentious little rube,
isn't he?

806
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:02,319
You fuck!

807
00:58:03,957 --> 00:58:05,891
l can't believe you'd sit there...

808
00:58:06,093 --> 00:58:09,392
...not say anything and
then be dismissive about this.

809
00:58:09,596 --> 00:58:13,259
l've battled those freeloaders
all your life and then some.

810
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:14,900
And guess what?

811
00:58:16,136 --> 00:58:19,105
You and the AAU have a lot in common.

812
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:22,197
Bullshit! ln what way?!

813
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:24,570
Resistance to change.

814
00:58:25,445 --> 00:58:28,903
They don't want to stop
shitting on you any more than...

815
00:58:29,116 --> 00:58:32,574
...you want to change
the way you run. Because it hurts.

816
00:58:33,053 --> 00:58:34,987
- Doesn't it?
- l wouldn't know.

817
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,691
Doesn't it hurt to change?

818
00:59:05,786 --> 00:59:08,084
<i>What are Viren's chances against me?</i>

819
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:12,554
Yes, my long-term goal
is still the '72 Olympics.

820
00:59:13,293 --> 00:59:14,624
What's your name?

821
00:59:15,629 --> 00:59:16,960
l like your shirt.

822
00:59:17,864 --> 00:59:19,024
Go, Pre!

823
00:59:19,966 --> 00:59:24,130
<i>He's really finding out about</i>
<i>his strengths and weaknesses now.</i>

824
00:59:24,337 --> 00:59:26,396
<i>And he's run the rest into oblivion.</i>

825
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:41,644
You really believe
you can do anything?

826
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:43,015
Absolutely.

827
00:59:43,256 --> 00:59:44,621
Fly a plane?

828
00:59:44,825 --> 00:59:46,816
Sure, if l wanted.

829
00:59:47,127 --> 00:59:49,823
You read the manual,
get the best teacher...

830
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,463
...and take off!

831
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,602
Not everything can be learned.
Some things take talent.

832
01:00:00,941 --> 01:00:02,602
Let me tell you something.

833
01:00:03,477 --> 01:00:05,741
Talent is a myth.

834
01:00:06,513 --> 01:00:10,313
A dozen guys on the team have
more talent in their little finger.

835
01:00:10,784 --> 01:00:12,877
Then how come you can beat them?

836
01:00:14,454 --> 01:00:16,581
A little secret l learned
a long time ago...

837
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,451
...in Coos Bay.

838
01:00:18,859 --> 01:00:20,224
ln the woods.

839
01:00:22,863 --> 01:00:25,093
So what's your little secret?

840
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:27,528
What? The one you learned
a long time ago.

841
01:00:33,373 --> 01:00:36,706
l can endure more pain
than anyone you've ever met.

842
01:00:39,312 --> 01:00:40,836
That's why...

843
01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:43,578
...l can beat anyone l've ever met.

844
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:50,618
You don't believe me?

845
01:00:53,793 --> 01:00:55,124
l do.

846
01:01:01,935 --> 01:01:04,802
What happens if you don't win in Munich?

847
01:01:07,174 --> 01:01:09,369
That's just not possible.

848
01:01:24,124 --> 01:01:25,819
Where the hell did you come from?

849
01:01:26,026 --> 01:01:30,087
That's a terrible way to greet someone,
especially Mr. Bowerman.

850
01:01:30,297 --> 01:01:31,264
Not bad, rube.

851
01:01:31,464 --> 01:01:33,989
- Steak on food stamps?
- Barbecued catfish.

852
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:35,759
Would you like to stay?

853
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:41,170
No, thanks, Mary.
l'd just like a word with your friend.

854
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:42,838
Go on.

855
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,868
Go on.

856
01:01:51,084 --> 01:01:52,483
What's going on?

857
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:54,119
George Young is in town.

858
01:01:56,189 --> 01:01:57,315
So?

859
01:01:57,924 --> 01:02:01,121
He holds the world record at 2 miles.

860
01:02:01,328 --> 01:02:03,922
l think we're running
the 5000 at the trials.

861
01:02:06,366 --> 01:02:08,527
You don't think
l can beat George Young?

862
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:11,236
He has a hell of a finishing kick.

863
01:02:11,438 --> 01:02:12,928
You won't run away from him.

864
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:15,607
Not by running out in front, flat out.

865
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:17,001
Shit!

866
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,474
We're back to front-running again?

867
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:23,240
Nothing would please
George Young more, or the crowd.

868
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:27,181
You'd give them the performance
they want and him the one he expects.

869
01:02:27,387 --> 01:02:31,585
You can call a race what you want,
but l wouldn't call it a performance.

870
01:02:32,058 --> 01:02:33,889
What would you call it?

871
01:02:34,628 --> 01:02:36,459
A work of art.

872
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,791
lf you can't beat George Young...

873
01:02:43,003 --> 01:02:45,096
...you can't win at Munich.

874
01:02:46,573 --> 01:02:50,065
Beating George Young is going to
take some kind of time.

875
01:02:50,644 --> 01:02:51,906
What kind of time?

876
01:03:00,587 --> 01:03:01,849
13:23.

877
01:03:04,024 --> 01:03:05,685
13:23?

878
01:03:09,496 --> 01:03:13,227
That's 7 seconds faster than the
American record. My American record.

879
01:03:13,466 --> 01:03:15,263
Your American record.

880
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:18,032
How do l do that?

881
01:03:22,275 --> 01:03:24,140
<i>You wear him out.</i>

882
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:26,802
<i>Descending series.</i>

883
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,047
<i>Negative splits.</i>

884
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,253
<i>Prefontaine's lap time: 65 seconds.</i>

885
01:03:41,628 --> 01:03:45,689
<i>Gradually go a little faster</i>
<i>than he thinks he's going.</i>

886
01:03:45,965 --> 01:03:49,162
<i>By the time he realizes</i>
<i>what's happening...</i>

887
01:03:49,369 --> 01:03:52,065
<i>... he won't have enough left</i>
<i>to hurt you.</i>

888
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:09,414
<i>Prefontaine's time for that lap:</i>
<i>64 seconds.</i>

889
01:04:29,342 --> 01:04:30,969
<i>Prefontaine's lap time:</i>

890
01:04:31,444 --> 01:04:33,002
<i>63 seconds.</i>

891
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:40,019
<i>Steve Prefontaine and George Young</i>
<i>have broken away from the field.</i>

892
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:44,156
<i>That means that Prefontaine will make</i>
<i>his first Olympic team...</i>

893
01:04:44,357 --> 01:04:46,689
<i>... and George Young</i>
<i>will make his 4th...</i>

894
01:04:46,893 --> 01:04:49,726
<i>... as the top 3 finishers</i>
<i>will be going to Munich.</i>

895
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:52,557
<i>It's not enough for Prefontaine</i>
<i>to simply qualify.</i>

896
01:04:52,766 --> 01:04:55,234
<i>He's been gradually</i>
<i>increasing the pace...</i>

897
01:04:55,435 --> 01:04:57,096
<i>... trying to run away from Young.</i>

898
01:04:57,604 --> 01:04:59,504
<i>Now, less than 2 laps to go...</i>

899
01:04:59,706 --> 01:05:01,173
<i>... it is Prefontaine...</i>

900
01:05:01,374 --> 01:05:03,501
<i>... a stride out in front of Young.</i>

901
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:05,871
<i>They've broken away from the pack.</i>

902
01:05:07,247 --> 01:05:08,771
<i>Pre's lap time:</i>

903
01:05:08,982 --> 01:05:10,176
<i>59 seconds.</i>

904
01:05:10,383 --> 01:05:13,580
<i>Now he's building a</i>
<i>lead and the strategy is working.</i>

905
01:05:13,787 --> 01:05:15,948
<i>Prefontaine has broken Young.</i>

906
01:05:16,156 --> 01:05:19,751
<i>In front of this sell-out crowd</i>
<i>at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon.</i>

907
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:23,224
<i>They're on their feet,</i>
<i>cheering the hometown favorite.</i>

908
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,921
<i>And he is running away</i>
<i>from George Young.</i>

909
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:30,026
<i>Steve Prefontaine wins</i>
<i>the Olympic trials...</i>

910
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:34,036
<i>... and qualifies for</i>
<i>his first Olympic Games.</i>

911
01:05:41,548 --> 01:05:42,515
Way to go!

912
01:05:42,749 --> 01:05:47,243
<i>Steve Prefontaine sets</i>
<i>a new American record...</i>

913
01:05:47,454 --> 01:05:49,217
<i>... of 13:22:8.</i>

914
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:53,584
<i>Steve Prefontaine's time of 13:22:8...</i>

915
01:05:54,794 --> 01:05:58,560
<i>... is a new American record</i>
<i>by 8 seconds.</i>

916
01:06:54,454 --> 01:06:56,945
Down the hall and up the stairs!

917
01:07:14,007 --> 01:07:16,703
What happened to security
on these elevators?

918
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:18,901
We removed them. Not necessary.

919
01:07:19,112 --> 01:07:20,044
Really?

920
01:07:20,246 --> 01:07:21,804
Yes. Finished.

921
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:24,874
Not necessary.

922
01:07:28,855 --> 01:07:30,982
Call the embassy
and get Marine guards...

923
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:34,387
...on these elevators around
the clock, no matter what.

924
01:07:34,594 --> 01:07:38,553
That might offend the Germans
and piss off the Olympic Committee.

925
01:07:38,765 --> 01:07:40,494
Let them be offended.

926
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:44,136
lt's easier to beg forgiveness
than ask permission.

927
01:08:07,393 --> 01:08:08,917
What's going on?

928
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:11,892
- We don't know.
- l can't even get the TV to work.

929
01:08:12,098 --> 01:08:13,326
Gentlemen.

930
01:08:14,901 --> 01:08:17,995
Arab gunmen have taken over
the lsraeli compound.

931
01:08:18,204 --> 01:08:21,605
We're waiting for more information.
Our quarters are sealed off.

932
01:08:21,808 --> 01:08:26,472
So clear off the balcony and
stay put until further notice.

933
01:09:01,781 --> 01:09:05,740
Golda Meir just requested that
the games be suspended.

934
01:09:10,123 --> 01:09:12,421
What's the point
in competing now, anyway?

935
01:09:17,897 --> 01:09:19,524
Wait a minute.

936
01:09:25,805 --> 01:09:27,773
He said the hostages will be...

937
01:09:27,974 --> 01:09:30,670
...released in exchange for a plane
for the terrorists.

938
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:37,415
lt's over. That's it.

939
01:09:37,617 --> 01:09:38,641
Thank God!

940
01:09:38,851 --> 01:09:40,751
l'm hitting the sack.

941
01:09:44,657 --> 01:09:46,181
Get some sleep.

942
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,205
l'm sorry.

943
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:06,072
l had to clean up the place.
lt was a mess.

944
01:10:09,682 --> 01:10:11,547
l'll go to bed now.

945
01:10:11,918 --> 01:10:14,216
The police tried an ambush
at the airport.

946
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:17,184
All the lsraelis have been killed.

947
01:10:19,592 --> 01:10:21,219
l'm sorry.

948
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:34,770
<i>This killing of Israeli athletes...</i>

949
01:10:34,974 --> 01:10:36,839
...is an act of war.

950
01:10:37,376 --> 01:10:39,810
And if there's one place...

951
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,939
...that war doesn't belong...

952
01:10:43,216 --> 01:10:44,376
...it's here.

953
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:48,378
For 1200 years.

954
01:10:48,721 --> 01:10:50,621
From 776 B. C...

955
01:10:50,823 --> 01:10:53,348
...to 393 A. D...

956
01:10:53,559 --> 01:10:56,619
...your fellow Olympians
laid down their arms...

957
01:10:56,829 --> 01:11:00,526
...to take part in these games.
They understood there was more honor...

958
01:11:00,867 --> 01:11:03,267
...in out-running a man...

959
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:06,466
...than in killing him.

960
01:11:10,276 --> 01:11:11,106
l hope...

961
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:15,003
...the competition will resume.

962
01:11:16,616 --> 01:11:18,174
And if it does...

963
01:11:19,852 --> 01:11:22,082
...you must not think that running...

964
01:11:22,455 --> 01:11:23,945
...or throwing...

965
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:25,689
...or jumping...

966
01:11:26,392 --> 01:11:28,189
...is frivolous.

967
01:11:29,262 --> 01:11:31,093
The Games...

968
01:11:31,497 --> 01:11:35,297
...were once your fellow Olympians'
answer to war.

969
01:11:36,102 --> 01:11:37,660
Competition...

970
01:11:38,437 --> 01:11:40,428
...not conquest.

971
01:11:41,741 --> 01:11:42,969
Now...

972
01:11:45,044 --> 01:11:46,875
...they must be your answer.

973
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:54,585
<i>David Bedford.</i>

974
01:11:55,121 --> 01:11:57,021
<i>Ian Stewart.</i>

975
01:11:57,323 --> 01:11:59,120
<i>Juha Vaatinen.</i>

976
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:02,022
<i>Mohammed Gammoudi.</i>

977
01:12:03,196 --> 01:12:04,925
<i>Lasse Viren.</i>

01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:06,453
<i>Emiel Puttemans.</i>

979
01:12:08,301 --> 01:12:10,462
<i>Harold Norpoth.</i>

980
01:12:11,304 --> 01:12:13,431
<i>Steve Prefontaine.</i>

981
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:16,130
<i>13 runners at this Olympic pre-finals.</i>

982
01:12:16,342 --> 01:12:17,809
The same plan as the trials?

983
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:20,444
Conserve the first 2 miles.

984
01:12:20,646 --> 01:12:23,513
Go hard the last one.
Watch out for Gammoudi.

985
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:25,513
Why? What's Gammoudi do?

986
01:12:25,718 --> 01:12:27,208
Elbows.

987
01:12:28,054 --> 01:12:30,454
<i>That's Alvaris Selgado.</i>
<i>Halle of Norway next.</i>

988
01:12:30,656 --> 01:12:34,057
<i>Viren of Finland, the 10,000-meter</i>
<i>champion. A world-record holder.</i>

989
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,524
<i>When I talked to Stewart</i>
<i>and Prefontaine...</i>

990
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:39,721
<i>... I asked them how they thought</i>
<i>the race might unfold.</i>

991
01:12:39,932 --> 01:12:42,492
<i>I'd like to work it out...</i>

992
01:12:42,702 --> 01:12:44,226
<i>... so that in the end...</i>

993
01:12:44,537 --> 01:12:47,028
<i>... it comes down to a pure guts race.</i>

994
01:12:47,874 --> 01:12:50,206
<i>If it is,</i>
<i>I'm the only one who can win it.</i>

995
01:13:06,726 --> 01:13:08,785
<i>121/2 laps of the track.</i>

996
01:13:09,462 --> 01:13:11,191
<i>McCafferty comes from the outside.</i>

997
01:13:11,397 --> 01:13:14,594
<i>Norpoth on the inside.</i>
<i>Ian Stewart, there for Great Britain.</i>

998
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,930
<i>Lasse Viren, one of the favorites,</i>
<i>just tucks himself into last place.</i>

999
01:13:19,138 --> 01:13:22,972
<i>And Steve Prefontaine is running</i>
<i>in the middle of the pack.</i>

1000
01:13:23,175 --> 01:13:26,804
<i>But everyone's bunched together</i>
<i>because the pace is pedestrian.</i>

1001
01:13:27,046 --> 01:13:29,537
<i>This is slow.</i>
<i>They've jogged half a lap.</i>

1002
01:13:29,749 --> 01:13:31,808
<i>McCafferty leads for Great Britain.</i>

1003
01:13:33,419 --> 01:13:34,909
<i>But no one can afford...</i>

1004
01:13:35,154 --> 01:13:38,646
<i>... to allow this to go on</i>
<i>until the later stages of the race.</i>

1005
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:41,553
<i>Everyone fears the finish</i>
<i>of the European champion...</i>

1006
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:44,924
<i>... number 225, Vaatinen,</i>
<i>the blond Finn.</i>

1007
01:13:52,505 --> 01:13:54,769
<i>McCafferty and Norpoth together.</i>

1008
01:13:55,274 --> 01:13:56,764
<i>Stewart on the outside.</i>

1009
01:13:56,976 --> 01:13:59,774
<i>Eisenberg and Prefontaine together,</i>
<i>4th and 5th.</i>

1010
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:01,146
<i>First lap...</i>

1011
01:14:01,347 --> 01:14:02,541
...very, very slow.

1012
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:07,715
<i>Still, the race has barely started.</i>

1013
01:14:09,789 --> 01:14:13,088
<i>Tripping over themselves</i>
<i>in their anxiety to find a position.</i>

1014
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:16,125
<i>No athletes study each other</i>
<i>like distance runners.</i>

1015
01:14:16,362 --> 01:14:19,354
<i>They'll try to be stoic,</i>
<i>all except Prefontaine.</i>

1016
01:14:19,565 --> 01:14:23,194
<i>It's as if he takes the pain</i>
<i>personally and is offended by it.</i>

1017
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:26,666
<i>Vaatinen must be loving this.</i>

1018
01:14:26,872 --> 01:14:29,773
<i>The strain on these runners,</i>
<i>waiting and waiting...</i>

1019
01:14:29,976 --> 01:14:32,240
<i>... for somebody to break</i>
<i>must be appalling.</i>

1020
01:14:32,445 --> 01:14:35,608
<i>The cracking point wilK/i>
<i>surely come soon.</i>

1021
01:14:36,048 --> 01:14:38,778
<i>Vaatinen, with a blistering finish...</i>

1022
01:14:38,985 --> 01:14:42,148
<i>... is like the Duke of Plessitora,</i>
<i>leading from behind.</i>

1023
01:14:42,555 --> 01:14:44,523
Who's the Duke of Plessitora?

1024
01:14:44,724 --> 01:14:46,555
Jesus, Mac, who gives a shit?

1025
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,051
<i>And surely somewhere...</i>

1026
01:14:50,262 --> 01:14:51,661
<i>... someone must go.</i>

1027
01:14:52,398 --> 01:14:54,263
Pre's ready to, but he's trapped.

1028
01:14:54,834 --> 01:14:57,769
<i>The time at 3 kilometers is 8:20:2.</i>

1029
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:01,667
<i>They're 150 yards slower</i>
<i>than Ron Clarke...</i>

1030
01:15:01,907 --> 01:15:03,704
<i>... when he set his world record.</i>

1031
01:15:03,909 --> 01:15:05,934
<i>The suspense must be appalling</i>
<i>among those...</i>

1032
01:15:06,812 --> 01:15:10,077
<i>... who haven't total confidence</i>
<i>in their sprinting ability.</i>

1033
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,624
<i>Sviridov, the Russian, goes in front.</i>

1034
01:15:23,829 --> 01:15:26,764
<i>All that pushing as they</i>
<i>all try to cover.</i>

1035
01:15:34,774 --> 01:15:37,709
<i>And they start</i>
<i>a significant change of pace.</i>

1036
01:15:37,943 --> 01:15:39,911
But it's given Pre his opening!

1037
01:15:40,146 --> 01:15:42,114
<i>Prefontaine coming through.</i>

1038
01:15:43,616 --> 01:15:45,982
<i>So the American now committed.</i>

1039
01:15:47,386 --> 01:15:49,752
<i>Really burly for a</i>
<i>middle-distance runner.</i>

1040
01:15:49,955 --> 01:15:52,185
<i>Cocky American who believes in himself.</i>

1041
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:54,450
<i>Here goes Pre.</i>
<i>Maybe this is the race.</i>

1042
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,220
<i>Prefontaine has taken the lead.</i>

1043
01:15:57,463 --> 01:16:01,263
<i>Ian Stewart comes right behind him,</i>
<i>and then it is Bedford.</i>

1044
01:16:03,736 --> 01:16:07,263
<i>Prefontaine, another athlete</i>
<i>who can't leave it late.</i>

1045
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:11,872
<i>A long-distance joiner, really,</i>
<i>who's got to go for home.</i>

1046
01:16:12,078 --> 01:16:14,205
<i>And this is surely being left...</i>

1047
01:16:14,413 --> 01:16:18,110
<i>... to the fastest miler.</i>
<i>Prefontaine believes it's him.</i>

1048
01:16:19,752 --> 01:16:21,276
Now we'll see.

1049
01:16:21,487 --> 01:16:24,547
<i>Prefontaine didn't exactly</i>
<i>keep his pre-race plans secret.</i>

1050
01:16:24,757 --> 01:16:26,384
<i>He's begun a mile-long drive...</i>

1051
01:16:26,592 --> 01:16:29,060
<i>... to break the best runners</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

1052
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:31,957
<i>The American, almost a cult</i>
<i>in the U. S...</i>

1053
01:16:32,164 --> 01:16:33,791
<i>... sort of an athletic Beatle.</i>

1054
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:35,990
<i>There are T-shirts around, "Go Pre."</i>

1055
01:16:36,235 --> 01:16:38,294
<i>Can anyone hold the lead that long?</i>

1056
01:16:38,504 --> 01:16:41,564
<i>I don't know. It's the</i>
<i>toughest way to win there is.</i>

1057
01:16:41,774 --> 01:16:44,299
<i>He's burning more energy</i>
<i>than anyone else.</i>

1058
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:46,637
<i>The race for the gold medal starts here.</i>

1059
01:16:46,879 --> 01:16:50,940
<i>Prefontaine leads. The Europeans</i>
<i>say he hasn't been in a war yet.</i>

1060
01:16:51,183 --> 01:16:52,810
<i>But he's got belief in himself.</i>

1061
01:16:53,586 --> 01:16:55,486
<i>And he's inexperienced enough...</i>

1062
01:16:55,688 --> 01:16:57,849
<i>... not to know how good</i>
<i>the others are.</i>

1063
01:16:58,057 --> 01:17:02,926
<i>As they come up with 2 to go,</i>
<i>Viren states his intention now.</i>

1064
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:06,163
lt's fine.

1065
01:17:06,398 --> 01:17:09,959
Pre can draft on Viren
and recharge for one last move.

1066
01:17:12,571 --> 01:17:15,369
<i>They have left this one</i>
<i>for the fastest finisher.</i>

1067
01:17:15,574 --> 01:17:19,032
<i>But Viren, the world-record holder</i>
<i>at 10,000 meters...</i>

1068
01:17:19,245 --> 01:17:20,712
<i>... already leads.</i>

1069
01:17:20,913 --> 01:17:24,542
<i>Viren, there's been a certainty</i>
<i>about his running in the past 6 weeks.</i>

1070
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,014
<i>It's almost made winning</i>
<i>seem inevitable.</i>

1071
01:17:27,219 --> 01:17:29,119
<i>2 laps to go.</i>
<i>Viren takes the lead.</i>

1072
01:17:29,321 --> 01:17:32,313
<i>Coaches will tell you</i>
<i>you have one chance at the lead.</i>

1073
01:17:32,525 --> 01:17:36,928
<i>Prefontaine has to beat the odds.</i>
<i>He has to stay with Viren.</i>

1074
01:18:23,008 --> 01:18:25,943
<i>He's got the turn and the lead.</i>
<i>Prefontaine is in front...</i>

1075
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:28,204
<i>... for the second time.</i>

1076
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:31,580
<i>The chunky American driving for home.</i>

1077
01:18:31,784 --> 01:18:33,115
<i>Viren following.</i>

1078
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:34,718
<i>Halle and Stewart...</i>

1079
01:18:34,987 --> 01:18:38,286
<i>... not covering Gammoudi. Gammoudi</i>
<i>goes 3rd and here comes Stewart.</i>

1080
01:18:38,657 --> 01:18:43,026
<i>The 3 medals are between these 5 men.</i>
<i>What price has he paid?</i>

1081
01:18:43,229 --> 01:18:45,663
<i>A tremendous price, Charlie.</i>

1082
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:47,297
<i>But his strategy's obvious.</i>

1083
01:18:47,499 --> 01:18:51,162
<i>He wants to be the last man</i>
<i>on his feet at the end.</i>

1084
01:18:51,503 --> 01:18:54,631
<i>Pre has said before:</i>
<i>"There may be men who can beat me...</i>

1085
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,775
<i>... but they're going to have</i>
<i>to bleed to do it. "</i>

1086
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:59,407
<i>This time, the bell.</i>

1087
01:18:59,612 --> 01:19:03,309
<i>Lasse Viren now moves up</i>
<i>and challenges Prefontaine.</i>

1088
01:19:03,515 --> 01:19:07,144
<i>He's going by him.</i>
<i>One lap to go, instincts take over.</i>

1089
01:19:07,353 --> 01:19:09,787
Viren's gone too soon.
Pre can hang and wait.

1090
01:19:09,989 --> 01:19:11,980
<i>Around the bend</i>
<i>into the back straight.</i>

1091
01:19:12,191 --> 01:19:15,991
<i>A long straight they're facing</i>
<i>for the last time on the final lap.</i>

1092
01:19:16,195 --> 01:19:19,596
<i>There's little strategy in this lap.</i>
<i>It's just going to be more of...</i>

1093
01:19:19,798 --> 01:19:21,425
<i>... who can survive...</i>

1094
01:19:21,634 --> 01:19:25,536
<i>... this 4-lap-from-the-finish run</i>
<i>by Steve Prefontaine?</i>

1095
01:19:25,738 --> 01:19:27,171
<i>Gammoudi's going for the win.</i>

1096
01:19:27,373 --> 01:19:30,865
<i>Prefontaine goes by.</i>
<i>He has to get by before the turn.</i>

1097
01:19:31,076 --> 01:19:35,035
<i>And the American attacks on the</i>
<i>outside, but Gammoudi responds.</i>

1098
01:19:35,281 --> 01:19:36,873
<i>Viren there.</i>
<i>And these 3 now...</i>

1099
01:19:37,082 --> 01:19:39,141
<i>... 7-8 meters clear of Ian Stewart.</i>

1100
01:19:39,385 --> 01:19:41,216
<i>These are the medal men.</i>

1101
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:44,218
<i>200 meters left.</i>
<i>The champion, Gammoudi, leads.</i>

1102
01:19:44,423 --> 01:19:47,256
<i>Viren moves up inside Prefontaine.</i>

1103
01:19:47,993 --> 01:19:51,588
<i>The Finn and the American gathering</i>
<i>for the final attack.</i>

1104
01:19:59,805 --> 01:20:01,397
<i>Can't do it!</i>

1105
01:20:01,874 --> 01:20:05,867
<i>Viren's challenging Prefontaine inside.</i>
<i>As they come off the turn...</i>

1106
01:20:06,078 --> 01:20:09,343
<i>... Gammoudi has the lead.</i>
<i>And here comes Viren!</i>

1107
01:20:14,386 --> 01:20:18,379
<i>They're all running at top end.</i>
<i>There are no more gears.</i>

1108
01:20:18,724 --> 01:20:20,555
<i>It's as fast as these men can go.</i>

1109
01:20:23,595 --> 01:20:24,823
<i>Top of the final turn.</i>

1110
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:28,056
<i>100 meters to go.</i>
<i>Lasse Viren has taken the lead.</i>

1111
01:20:28,267 --> 01:20:32,795
<i>As they go for home, Gammoudi</i>
<i>is bankrupt! So is Prefontaine!</i>

1112
01:20:33,605 --> 01:20:37,507
<i>The Finn pulls in now</i>
<i>for his second gold medal.</i>

1113
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,735
<i>And Stewart with a late run!</i>

1114
01:20:39,978 --> 01:20:43,072
<i>The Finn wins, Gammoudi second,</i>
<i>Stewart takes the bronze.</i>

1115
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:46,945
<i>Prefontaine dies in the final stride.</i>
<i>Puttemans fifth, Norpoth sixth...</i>

1116
01:20:47,386 --> 01:20:49,115
<i>... Per of Norway seventh...</i>

1117
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:54,420
He ran his last mile in 4:04.

1118
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,457
What more could he have done?

1119
01:20:57,029 --> 01:21:00,795
<i>Prefontaine endured a slow early pace</i>
<i>and made all those moves.</i>

1120
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:02,227
<i>With a mile to go...</i>

1121
01:21:02,434 --> 01:21:04,527
<i>... with 600, with 300.</i>

1122
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:08,036
<i>And Viren took everything</i>
<i>he threw at him and still won.</i>

1123
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,936
<i>Two outstanding efforts.</i>

1124
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:13,770
<i>One man made the race</i>
<i>and another man won it.</i>

1125
01:21:13,979 --> 01:21:16,345
<i>Fred, it was really a great race.</i>

1126
01:21:16,548 --> 01:21:19,847
When you see Steve,
congratulate him for me, will you?

1127
01:21:20,052 --> 01:21:22,543
He ran one of the
greatest races l've ever seen.

1128
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:35,888
<i>The Finn pulls in now</i>
<i>for his second gold medal.</i>

1129
01:22:36,094 --> 01:22:37,857
<i>And Stewart with a late run!</i>

1130
01:22:38,096 --> 01:22:41,065
<i>The Finn wins, Gammoudi second,</i>
<i>Stewart takes the bronze.</i>

1131
01:22:41,266 --> 01:22:45,202
<i>Prefontaine, dying in the</i>
<i>final strides, fourth...</i>

1132
01:23:03,555 --> 01:23:05,785
Lobo, how about a quick...

1133
01:23:11,797 --> 01:23:13,424
This is Lobo.

1134
01:23:14,132 --> 01:23:16,498
You don't answer your phone anymore.

1135
01:23:18,136 --> 01:23:20,866
You want some food?
Come on, right here.

1136
01:23:26,578 --> 01:23:28,205
Care to come in?

1137
01:23:29,314 --> 01:23:31,214
l got to get ready for work.

1138
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,752
Where are you working?

1139
01:23:44,997 --> 01:23:46,487
The Pad.

1140
01:23:48,767 --> 01:23:50,894
Why? What's wrong with that?

1141
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:53,135
Nothing.

1142
01:23:53,338 --> 01:23:55,636
That didn't look like nothing.

1143
01:23:58,443 --> 01:24:00,138
l'm not here to fight, so...

1144
01:24:00,345 --> 01:24:01,505
Sorry.

1145
01:24:01,847 --> 01:24:03,542
Why are you here?

1146
01:24:12,524 --> 01:24:16,324
Your pictures and awards,
there's nothing here anymore.

1147
01:24:26,204 --> 01:24:28,502
Honey, you were great in Munich.

1148
01:24:30,142 --> 01:24:32,235
Viren was great. l was fourth.

1149
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:34,042
You can beat Viren.

1150
01:24:35,714 --> 01:24:37,682
Really? Who told you that?

1151
01:24:40,686 --> 01:24:41,812
You did.

1152
01:24:44,856 --> 01:24:47,256
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

1153
01:24:54,499 --> 01:24:55,830
Come on.

1154
01:24:58,203 --> 01:24:59,227
l'll walk you out.

1155
01:25:02,174 --> 01:25:03,698
Sure, why not?

1156
01:25:32,204 --> 01:25:35,901
Everyone is standing around!
Nobody's drinking. Two Buds!

1157
01:25:40,045 --> 01:25:41,478
Two! Two!

1158
01:25:41,713 --> 01:25:43,578
Who else needs something?

1159
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,744
Jesus!

1160
01:25:47,386 --> 01:25:50,651
- Bill, what brings you by?
- Same as everybody else.

1161
01:25:51,923 --> 01:25:54,585
l heard Steve Prefontaine
was working here.

1162
01:25:54,793 --> 01:25:58,058
l'm told he prefers it
to living on food stamps.

1163
01:25:58,263 --> 01:26:00,629
Did you have to put your picture up?

1164
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,862
Shit!

1165
01:26:03,468 --> 01:26:06,699
Cover for me!
You want to meet me out back?

1166
01:26:20,986 --> 01:26:22,749
What? l got to make a living!

1167
01:26:22,954 --> 01:26:26,651
Nobody in Oregon can
influence kids more than you can.

1168
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:28,788
So get yourself another job.

1169
01:26:28,994 --> 01:26:31,758
One that pays the rent
and lets me compete...

1170
01:26:31,963 --> 01:26:34,431
...with athletes
who don't have to work?

1171
01:26:36,501 --> 01:26:39,334
l haven't noticed you
working out that much.

1172
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:44,600
You know the greatest race
l ever saw you run?

1173
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:46,099
Munich.

1174
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:49,439
l was never prouder
than of your effort that day.

1175
01:26:49,648 --> 01:26:52,208
You couldn't have
done more than you did.

1176
01:26:55,921 --> 01:26:57,616
You won the trials in 13:22.

1177
01:26:57,823 --> 01:26:59,950
5 seconds faster than Viren.

1178
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:02,718
lt would've beaten him by 30 yards.

1179
01:27:03,295 --> 01:27:06,560
lt's hard to believe
you've never thought about it.

1180
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,530
So if l'd gone out faster,
l might've...

1181
01:27:11,737 --> 01:27:13,432
And you blame me.

1182
01:27:14,339 --> 01:27:16,204
Do you blame yourself?

1183
01:27:17,309 --> 01:27:19,300
That's a constant, Pre.

1184
01:27:20,846 --> 01:27:23,508
At your level of competition,
anyone can win...

1185
01:27:23,715 --> 01:27:26,980
...on any given day,
and not necessarily the best man.

1186
01:27:27,185 --> 01:27:29,517
Losing a race isn't your problem.

1187
01:27:29,721 --> 01:27:31,621
Front-running isn't your problem!

1188
01:27:31,823 --> 01:27:33,017
What's my problem?

1189
01:27:33,225 --> 01:27:34,658
Vanity!

1190
01:27:35,193 --> 01:27:38,219
lnsisting you have no talent
is the ultimate vanity!

1191
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:42,059
No talent, no limits.
lt's all an act of will, right?

1192
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:44,497
l couldn't do it.
Leave it at that!

1193
01:27:44,703 --> 01:27:46,193
l got news for you!

1194
01:27:46,404 --> 01:27:48,895
All the will
in the world won't get...

1195
01:27:49,107 --> 01:27:53,100
...a person in a million to run
a 3:54 mile! That takes talent!

1196
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:57,213
And talent in a runner is tied
to specific physical attributes!

1197
01:27:57,582 --> 01:28:01,780
Your heart probably pumps more blood
than anyone else's on the planet.

1198
01:28:01,987 --> 01:28:03,887
That's the fuel for your talent.

1199
01:28:04,089 --> 01:28:06,523
lt'd take a hammer to hurt your bones!

1200
01:28:06,725 --> 01:28:08,920
lt's the foundation of your talent.

1201
01:28:09,127 --> 01:28:11,994
Your talent is not some
disembodied act of will.

1202
01:28:12,197 --> 01:28:14,791
lt's literally in your bones.
lt has limits.

1203
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,558
Be thankful for your limits.

1204
01:28:16,768 --> 01:28:19,703
They're as limitless
as they get in this life.

1205
01:28:19,905 --> 01:28:21,236
Good night.

1206
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,439
Just a minute.

1207
01:28:24,009 --> 01:28:26,204
Bill, just a fucking minute.

1208
01:28:26,745 --> 01:28:30,476
Do you really believe
you know everything about me?

1209
01:28:31,616 --> 01:28:34,949
Did it ever occur to you
that l might know...

1210
01:28:35,153 --> 01:28:38,145
...something about myself
that you don't?

1211
01:28:40,058 --> 01:28:41,184
You vain...

1212
01:28:42,093 --> 01:28:44,493
...inflexible son of a bitch.

1213
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:51,233
You don't know me
any better than yourself.

1214
01:28:51,436 --> 01:28:54,337
And you're never
going to change you, Bill.

1215
01:29:33,278 --> 01:29:34,609
Men of Oregon...

1216
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,243
...l invite you to become...

1217
01:29:37,449 --> 01:29:39,974
...students of your events.

1218
01:29:40,919 --> 01:29:41,783
Running...

1219
01:29:42,087 --> 01:29:43,850
...one might say...

1220
01:29:44,256 --> 01:29:46,224
...is basically an absurd pastime...

1221
01:29:46,424 --> 01:29:50,121
...upon which to be exhausting
ourselves. Gentlemen...

1222
01:29:50,328 --> 01:29:51,818
...if l'm boring you...

1223
01:29:54,499 --> 01:29:58,026
l'm sorry, Bill.
l didn't mean to interrupt.

1224
01:29:59,304 --> 01:30:02,068
l was just wondering if...

1225
01:30:03,742 --> 01:30:06,836
Would you mind if
l worked out with the team?

1226
01:30:16,421 --> 01:30:18,787
You're always welcome here, Pre.

1227
01:30:25,597 --> 01:30:26,825
Gentlemen...

1228
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:31,463
...if you can find meaning
in the kind of running...

1229
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:34,662
...you have to do to stay
on this team...

1230
01:30:35,173 --> 01:30:38,301
...chances are
you can find meaning...

1231
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:41,502
...in that other absurd pastime:

1232
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,279
Life.

1233
01:30:44,749 --> 01:30:48,241
<i>For the time being,</i>
<i>don't work out with the team.</i>

1234
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,549
<i>You'll be facing Viren</i>
<i>again at the Montreal Olympics.</i>

1235
01:30:52,757 --> 01:30:54,918
<i>I don't want you racing anyone now.</i>

1236
01:30:55,193 --> 01:30:56,922
<i>I just want you running.</i>

1237
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:15,739
<i>Explore the limits of the one</i>
<i>competitor above everyone else...</i>

1238
01:31:15,947 --> 01:31:17,881
<i>... you've always loved to face:</i>

1239
01:31:18,283 --> 01:31:20,046
<i>Steve Prefontaine.</i>

1240
01:31:22,053 --> 01:31:23,384
<i>Dear Mary...</i>

1241
01:31:24,055 --> 01:31:26,250
<i>... it's the first day of spring.</i>

1242
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:30,622
<i>Munich seems more than 6 months ago.</i>
<i>You're on my mind a lot.</i>

1243
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,071
<i>Sometimes...</i>

1244
01:31:47,512 --> 01:31:49,707
<i>... I choke on things I want to say.</i>

1245
01:31:49,914 --> 01:31:52,940
<i>I nearly did talk to you yesterday,</i>
<i>but you looked busy.</i>

1246
01:31:53,418 --> 01:31:56,717
<i>The trouble is, since Munich,</i>
<i>I've hated myself too much...</i>

1247
01:31:56,921 --> 01:32:00,118
<i>... to feel I can say anything</i>
<i>to someone I love.</i>

1248
01:32:00,492 --> 01:32:02,790
<i>I'm running against</i>
<i>Shorter in the Restoration...</i>

1249
01:32:02,994 --> 01:32:04,484
<i>... the race at Hayward Field...</i>

1250
01:32:04,696 --> 01:32:07,256
<i>... to raise money to keep it</i>
<i>from falling apart.</i>

1251
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:10,824
<i>It is, after all, my second home.</i>

1252
01:32:11,936 --> 01:32:13,164
<i>Steve.</i>

1253
01:32:29,354 --> 01:32:30,946
l'd like to ask you something.

1254
01:32:33,558 --> 01:32:34,650
lt's personal.

1255
01:32:36,694 --> 01:32:37,854
Sit down.

1256
01:32:39,798 --> 01:32:41,857
How do you and Barbara...

1257
01:32:43,201 --> 01:32:45,669
How do you and Barbara...?
l mean...

1258
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:48,498
Do you pretty much
believe in the same things?

1259
01:32:49,808 --> 01:32:52,538
God, Pre, l have no idea.

1260
01:32:53,044 --> 01:32:56,104
The woman's a complete mystery to me.

1261
01:32:56,381 --> 01:32:58,576
How do you get along so well?

1262
01:32:59,384 --> 01:33:02,217
l don't have to know what
she believes in. l believe in her.

1263
01:33:08,993 --> 01:33:11,518
You're easily pleased, l must say.

1264
01:33:11,729 --> 01:33:13,492
l liked what you said about...

1265
01:33:13,698 --> 01:33:16,326
...using foreign promoters
to combat the AAU.

1266
01:33:16,534 --> 01:33:18,331
That's not a bad idea.

1267
01:33:20,505 --> 01:33:21,870
You all set for tomorrow?

1268
01:33:22,507 --> 01:33:23,872
Yeah, sure.

1269
01:33:24,843 --> 01:33:26,333
No sweat.

1270
01:33:30,582 --> 01:33:32,846
<i>And representing Oregon International...</i>

1271
01:33:33,351 --> 01:33:36,184

<i>... Don Kardong.</i>

1275
01:34:04,215 --> 01:34:06,376
l've been kidding myself, K enny.

1276
01:34:07,785 --> 01:34:09,275
What are you talking about?

1277
01:34:11,389 --> 01:34:13,880
l can't run with these guys anymore.

1278
01:34:15,126 --> 01:34:17,526
Shorter, Lindgren, Kardong.

1279
01:34:17,729 --> 01:34:19,856
They're going to hand me my head.

1280
01:34:20,465 --> 01:34:21,796
<i>A graduate of Yale...</i>

1284
01:34:36,814 --> 01:34:38,577
<i>Ladies and gentlemen:</i>

<i>Pre.</i>

1286
01:35:03,675 --> 01:35:05,267
l think that's you.

1287
01:35:54,726 --> 01:35:58,685
<i>Pre now moving to the front again.</i>
<i>The leaders battling the wind.</i>

1290
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:14,070
Teamwork?

1291
01:36:15,013 --> 01:36:17,106
lt's so windy,
Frank agreed to swap...

1292
01:36:17,315 --> 01:36:19,545
...the lead with Steve
every other lap.

1293
01:36:19,751 --> 01:36:21,150
Share the work...

1294
01:36:21,352 --> 01:36:23,183
...draft off each other.

1295
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:32,195
<i>Pre moves into the lead</i>
<i>ahead of Frank Shorter.</i>

1296
01:36:39,704 --> 01:36:41,638
<i>Shorter again takes the lead...</i>

1297
01:36:42,273 --> 01:36:43,604
He's doing it.

1298
01:36:49,213 --> 01:36:51,773
<i>Once again, Pre takes the lead.</i>

1299
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:55,949
Frank's going to
take the lead right here...

1300
01:36:56,387 --> 01:36:58,787
...then the last lap'll
be every man for himself.

1301
01:37:03,428 --> 01:37:04,452
<i>Kardong, third.</i>

1302
01:37:04,896 --> 01:37:05,760

Run!

1304
01:37:07,231 --> 01:37:10,257
Frank should've taken the lead.
He's not doing it.

1305
01:37:10,468 --> 01:37:13,767
There's no way Steve can fight
the wind for another 2 laps.

1306
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:16,098
<i>In the 3-mile, Pre continues to lead.</i>

1307
01:37:17,275 --> 01:37:19,743
<i>Frank Shorter, second, Kardong, third.</i>

1308

1310
01:37:34,692 --> 01:37:35,681
Great.

1311
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,689
Munich all over again.

1312
01:38:12,296 --> 01:38:13,786
<i>Prefontaine, the winner...</i>

1313
01:38:13,998 --> 01:38:15,795

<i>A new American record.</i>

<i>The third fastest 3-mile ever run.</i>

01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:38,310
<i>Finishing third...</i>

1318
01:38:38,523 --> 01:38:43,051
<i>... Don Kardong has run under</i>
<i>13 minutes for the first time ever.</i>

1319
01:38:43,361 --> 01:38:44,726
Under 13.

1320
01:38:44,996 --> 01:38:46,793
lsn't that a P.R.?

1321
01:38:47,231 --> 01:38:48,698
Congratulations!

1322
01:39:24,702 --> 01:39:26,033
Hey, rube.

1323
01:39:26,604 --> 01:39:28,595
Want some lemonade?

1324
01:39:30,775 --> 01:39:31,867
No.

1325
01:39:33,878 --> 01:39:35,106
They've offered me...

1326
01:39:35,313 --> 01:39:37,941
...$ 200,000 to turn pro.

1327
01:39:43,454 --> 01:39:45,081
What do you think should l do?

1328
01:39:49,293 --> 01:39:51,761
l'm not going to tell you
to turn it down.

1329
01:39:51,963 --> 01:39:54,397
l know what that money
could do for you...

1330
01:39:54,632 --> 01:39:56,224
...and your family.

1331
01:39:58,903 --> 01:40:00,200
No Montreal...

1332
01:40:00,571 --> 01:40:02,038
...obviously.

1333
01:40:02,573 --> 01:40:04,507
No Olympics, period.

1334
01:40:10,648 --> 01:40:13,173
Where the hell did these come from?

1335
01:40:13,384 --> 01:40:14,316
They're yours.

1336
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:17,144
The rubber spikes.

1337
01:40:25,196 --> 01:40:27,027
The seam's gone.

1338
01:40:27,265 --> 01:40:28,994
Took that out for you.

1339
01:40:36,974 --> 01:40:38,908
They're made from your last...

1340
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:40,771
...so try them on.

1341
01:41:05,903 --> 01:41:07,700
Stand up on it.

1342
01:41:14,078 --> 01:41:15,773
They fit all right.

1343
01:41:17,982 --> 01:41:19,609
How do they feel?

1344
01:41:33,097 --> 01:41:34,928
Excuse me a minute, Bill.

1345
01:42:06,464 --> 01:42:08,762
l'm sorry.
l ran up to the quarry.

1346
01:42:08,966 --> 01:42:10,957
l forgot about the time.

1347
01:42:38,996 --> 01:42:40,520
How'd you like them?

1348
01:42:41,499 --> 01:42:44,366
You know me.
l've always been an Adidas freak.

1349
01:42:44,669 --> 01:42:45,658
But...

1350
01:42:45,903 --> 01:42:47,200
...they're not bad.

1351
01:42:49,407 --> 01:42:50,635
Not bad.

1352
01:42:53,844 --> 01:42:55,368
Can you make me a couple pair?

1353
01:42:55,613 --> 01:42:57,376
What the hell for?

1354
01:42:59,083 --> 01:43:00,015
Montreal.

1355
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:09,525
l think l could probably manage a couple.

1356
01:43:14,098 --> 01:43:16,658
l'll never understand you, Pre.

1357
01:43:18,436 --> 01:43:20,404
Who the hell says you have to?

1358
01:43:23,374 --> 01:43:25,205
What are all these cutouts for?

1359
01:43:25,443 --> 01:43:27,934
That's kind of my trademark.

1360
01:43:29,213 --> 01:43:31,340
Stands for Nike,
the Goddess of Victory.

1361
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:33,644
Nike?

1362
01:43:33,884 --> 01:43:35,078
Yeah, Greek.

1363
01:43:36,387 --> 01:43:37,581
l like it.

1364
01:43:50,735 --> 01:43:52,362
Get me out of here early.

1365
01:43:52,570 --> 01:43:54,504
l'm dying.
My jaw is throbbing.

1366
01:43:54,739 --> 01:43:55,728
Why?

1367
01:43:55,973 --> 01:43:58,407
My wisdom teeth
were extracted 5 days...

1368
01:43:58,642 --> 01:44:01,577
You can't stay here!
You exploded out there today.

1369
01:44:01,812 --> 01:44:03,973
Thanks a million.
l appreciate that.

1370
01:44:10,087 --> 01:44:11,384
l need to talk to you.

1371
01:44:11,622 --> 01:44:12,850
l'm right here.

1372
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:14,887
Well, wait for me.

1373
01:44:18,596 --> 01:44:20,427
So, Pre, l'm ready if you are.

1374
01:44:20,664 --> 01:44:22,256
l feel for you. l'm sorry.

1375
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,365
l want a ride, not your sympathy.

1376
01:44:24,602 --> 01:44:26,069
Okay, one second.

1377
01:44:26,604 --> 01:44:29,971
l've been looking for you everywhere.
Can you wait a second?

1378
01:44:30,207 --> 01:44:33,108
- We got to go.
- l'll be right back, okay?

1379
01:44:33,344 --> 01:44:35,278
Please don't leave without me.

1380
01:45:00,304 --> 01:45:01,669
Jesus, Frank!

1381
01:45:01,906 --> 01:45:03,100
A little privacy, please.

1382
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,272
l'm dying.

1383
01:45:04,508 --> 01:45:06,237
You got to take me home.

1384
01:45:08,813 --> 01:45:11,008
You can always come back, you know.

1385
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:15,178
l will be right back.

1386
01:45:17,321 --> 01:45:19,380
l'm not going to let you go.

1387
01:45:27,898 --> 01:45:28,956
Let's go.

1388
01:45:29,733 --> 01:45:31,360
See you, Mary.

1389
01:45:39,343 --> 01:45:41,208
l've made a decision.

1390
01:45:42,913 --> 01:45:44,175
ln the next 3 weeks...

1391
01:45:44,415 --> 01:45:47,748
...l'll break the world record
in the 3-mile by 12 seconds.

1392
01:45:47,952 --> 01:45:49,214
No kidding?

1393
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:51,047
You want to guess how?

1394
01:45:51,422 --> 01:45:52,354
l can't.

1395
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:53,887
Sure you can.

1396
01:45:54,525 --> 01:45:55,958
No, l have no idea.

1397
01:45:56,193 --> 01:45:58,286
Give it the old college try.

1398
01:45:58,529 --> 01:46:00,827
Honest to God, l can't guess.

1399
01:46:01,265 --> 01:46:02,630
l'll tell you.

1400
01:46:02,867 --> 01:46:04,801
Twelve 63-second quarters.

1401
01:46:05,002 --> 01:46:06,333
That's 12:36.

1402
01:46:06,704 --> 01:46:09,332
12 seconds faster than 12:48.

1403
01:46:10,875 --> 01:46:12,001
How about that?

1404
01:46:26,123 --> 01:46:27,681
All right, thanks, Pre.

1405
01:46:36,901 --> 01:46:38,596
So what time tomorrow?

1406
01:46:38,802 --> 01:46:41,236
Remember, we're going
to run an easy 10?

1407
01:46:43,474 --> 01:46:44,463
We'll see.

1408
01:46:44,742 --> 01:46:45,902
10 o'clock?

1409
01:46:46,577 --> 01:46:48,442
l said, we'll see.

1410
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:05,524
63 seconds per quarter
for 12 quarters...

1411
01:47:05,763 --> 01:47:06,752
...is 12:36.

1412
01:47:06,997 --> 01:47:09,227
12:36, Steve Prefontaine...

1413
01:47:09,433 --> 01:47:10,798
...world record!

1414
01:47:12,503 --> 01:47:15,301
63 seconds, boom!
First quarter.

1415
01:47:15,773 --> 01:47:19,573
2:06, boom! Second quarter.
3:09, boom! Third quarter.

1416
01:47:21,178 --> 01:47:22,907
8:24 for two miles.

1417
01:47:23,781 --> 01:47:24,941
Boom! Right there.

1418
01:47:25,182 --> 01:47:26,740
9:27 for nine.

1419
01:47:28,185 --> 01:47:29,652
10:30 for ten.

1420
01:47:29,887 --> 01:47:31,149
Always holding on.

1421
01:47:31,522 --> 01:47:33,456
11:33, one lap to go.

1422
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:36,453
He's holding on.
He sees it in front of him.

1423
01:47:37,194 --> 01:47:40,630
11:33. He's got one lap to go!
He's got one lap to go!

1424
01:47:40,864 --> 01:47:43,059
He's on world-record pace.

1425
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:45,461
200 meters to go, Steve Prefontaine...

1426
01:48:28,746 --> 01:48:31,943
<i>One of America's best hopes</i>
<i>for the 1976 Olympics...</i>

1427
01:48:32,182 --> 01:48:34,673
<i>... runner Steve Prefontaine,</i>
<i>is dead.</i>

1428
01:48:34,918 --> 01:48:38,354
<i>America's leading</i>
<i>long-distance runner...</i>

1429
01:48:38,589 --> 01:48:41,683
<i>... was killed last night</i>
<i>in a car accident.</i>

1430
01:48:42,026 --> 01:48:45,621
<i>Just hours before his death,</i>
<i>the 1972 Olympic runner...</i>

1431
01:48:45,863 --> 01:48:48,855
<i>... took part in a meet</i>
<i>at the University of Oregon.</i>

1432
01:48:49,099 --> 01:48:53,365
<i>During his career, he set records</i>
<i>in almost every long-distance event.</i>

1433
01:48:53,604 --> 01:48:57,870
<i>According to police,</i>
<i>he was driving alone in a convertible.</i>

1434
01:48:58,108 --> 01:48:59,735
<i>He was 24.</i>

1435
01:49:02,179 --> 01:49:04,807
<i>Pre did everything on a track...</i>

1436
01:49:05,015 --> 01:49:05,947
<i>... just about...</i>

1437
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:08,710
...everything on a track
that a runner can do.

1438
01:49:09,186 --> 01:49:11,347
One thing Pre cherished most...

1439
01:49:11,555 --> 01:49:14,854
...that he never got was the
world record at 3 miles.

1440
01:49:15,059 --> 01:49:17,027
The last thing Pre said to me...

1441
01:49:17,261 --> 01:49:18,990
...was that the next time
he'd run three miles...

1442
01:49:19,196 --> 01:49:21,323
...he'd do it in
12 minutes and 36 seconds...

1443
01:49:21,532 --> 01:49:24,729
...beating the world record
by 12 seconds.

1444
01:49:27,004 --> 01:49:28,528
We're timing the eulogy.

1445
01:49:31,508 --> 01:49:34,739
We'll deliver it
in 12 minutes, 36 seconds...

1446
01:49:34,945 --> 01:49:36,640
...then we'll stop the clock...

1447
01:49:36,847 --> 01:49:40,214
...and as far as we're concerned,
Pre will have his record.

1448
01:49:40,984 --> 01:49:42,645
All of my life...

1449
01:49:42,853 --> 01:49:44,684
...man and boy...

1450
01:49:44,888 --> 01:49:46,753
...l've operated
under the assumption...

1451
01:49:46,957 --> 01:49:51,326
...that the main idea in running
was to win the damn race.

1452
01:49:52,963 --> 01:49:54,555
When l became a coach...

1453
01:49:54,765 --> 01:49:57,893
...l tried to teach people
how to do that.

1454
01:49:58,102 --> 01:50:00,093
l tried to teach Pre how to do that.

1455
01:50:01,572 --> 01:50:04,598
l tried like hell
to teach Pre to do that.

1456
01:50:05,042 --> 01:50:07,203
And Pre taught me...

1457
01:50:07,811 --> 01:50:11,076
...taught me l was wrong.

1458
01:50:11,748 --> 01:50:14,615
Pre, you see,
was troubled by knowing...

1459
01:50:14,818 --> 01:50:18,219
...a mediocre effort
can win a race.

1460
01:50:18,422 --> 01:50:21,755
And a magnificent effort
can lose one.

1461
01:50:21,959 --> 01:50:24,860
Winning a race wouldn't
necessarily demand...

1462
01:50:25,062 --> 01:50:29,260
...that he give it everything
he had from start to finish.

1463
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:32,568
He never ran any other way.

1464
01:50:32,769 --> 01:50:35,237
l tried to get him to.

1465
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:38,203
God knows, l tried.

1466
01:50:38,408 --> 01:50:40,672
But Pre was stubborn.

1467
01:50:40,878 --> 01:50:42,869
He insisted on holding himself...

1468
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:46,015
...to a higher standard than victory.

1469
01:50:46,683 --> 01:50:47,775
A race...

1470
01:50:47,985 --> 01:50:50,215
...is a work of art.

1471
01:50:50,654 --> 01:50:52,144
That's what he said.

1472
01:50:52,856 --> 01:50:54,687
That's what he believed.

1473
01:50:54,892 --> 01:50:57,417
And he was out to make it one...

1474
01:50:57,628 --> 01:51:00,028
...every step of the way.

1475
01:51:01,331 --> 01:51:03,526
Of course, he wanted to win.

1476
01:51:03,734 --> 01:51:08,000
Those who saw him compete and
those who competed against him...

1477
01:51:08,205 --> 01:51:12,039
...were never in any doubt about
how much he wanted to win.

1478
01:51:12,743 --> 01:51:15,337
But how he won...

1479
01:51:15,546 --> 01:51:17,741
...mattered to him more.

1480
01:51:19,116 --> 01:51:21,744
Pre thought l was a hard case.

1481
01:51:23,587 --> 01:51:26,351
But he finally
got it through my head...

1482
01:51:26,557 --> 01:51:29,219
...that the real purpose of running...

1483
01:51:29,426 --> 01:51:31,587
...isn't to win a race.

1484
01:51:33,096 --> 01:51:35,530
lt's to test the limits...

1485
01:51:35,732 --> 01:51:37,666
...of the human heart.

1486
01:51:39,703 --> 01:51:41,466
And that he did.

1487
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:45,406
Nobody did it more often.

1488
01:51:48,278 --> 01:51:51,076
Nobody did it better.

1489
01:53:12,229 --> 01:53:16,529
<i>And we stopped the clock at</i>
<i>12 minutes and 36 seconds.</i>

1490
01:53:16,733 --> 01:53:18,462
<i>A world-record time...</i>

1491
01:53:18,669 --> 01:53:21,263
<i>... with which Steve Prefontaine...</i>

1492
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:23,905
<i>... would have been well satisfied.</i>
