Shush!

7
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:25,297
I'm stuck!

8
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,335
Get back.

9
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:45,572
Hmm!

10
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,251
- Mr. Tweedy.
- Eh?

11
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:24,964
What is that chicken
doing outside the fence?

12
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:28,001
Oh! I don't know, love. L...

13
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:31,003
Just deal with it. Now!

14
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:41,440
I'll teach you to make a fool out of me.

15
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:49,058
Now let that be a
lesson to the lot of ya!

16
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:52,279
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!

17
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:31,496
Oh!

18
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:06,317
Morning, Ginger. Back from holiday?

19
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:08,334
I wasn't on holiday, Babs.

20
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:10,282
I was in solitary confinement.

21
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:13,275
Oh, it's nice to get a bit
of time to yourself, isn't it?

22
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:20,235
Roll call!

23
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,239
Come along now. You'll
be late for parade.

24
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:25,558
Pip, pip. Quick march.
Left, right, left, right!

25
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:28,952
- Come on. Smarten up.
- Ooh!

26
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:30,837
Discipline! Order!

27
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:34,632
Back in my R.A.F. Days when the
senior officer called for a scramble,

28
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,890
You'd hop in the old crate and tallyho.

29
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,115
Chocks away!

30
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,949
Give over, you old fool.
They just want to count us.

31
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,154
Oh, how dare you talk back
to a senior ranking officer.

32
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,988
- Why, back in my R.A.F. Days...
- Fowler, they're coming. Back in line.

33
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:51,472
- Oh, right, right.
- Oh!

34
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:55,267
There will be a stern reprimand
for you, lad. You're grounded.

35
00:07:56,427 --> 00:08:00,185
Attention!

36
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:07,063
Welcome back, hen. Is there a new plan?

37
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,540
I thought we tried goin' under.

38
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:29,300
Ah! Over. Right.

39
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,701
How's the egg count?

40
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:43,636
I've laid five eggs this morning. Five!

41
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:46,536
- Well-Chuffed with that, I was...
- Shush!

42
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:56,934
Oh, no. Edwina.

43
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,898
Bunty, why didn't you
give her some of yours?

44
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:04,732
I would have. She didn't tell
me. She didn't tell anyone.

45
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,688
Oh, is Edwina off on holiday?

46
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:15,436
We've got to get out of here.

47
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:18,433
Ginger! Are we still on?

48
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:21,360
Oh, we're on, all right.

49
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:25,155
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in hut 17.

50
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:48,990
Oh!

51
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,353
You called? Nick and...

52
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:56,188
- Fetcher.
- At your service.

53
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:03,905
Over here.

54
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,666
We need some more things.

55
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:08,250
Right you are, miss.

56
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:10,414
How about this quality
handcrafted tea set?

57
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:10,844
Uh, no.

58
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,870
- Or this lovely necklace and pendant?
- It's love...

59
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,404
Or this beautiful little number,

60
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:17,304
All the rage in the fashionable
chicken coops of Paris.

61
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:19,868
Simply pop it on like so,

62
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:22,022
And as the French hens say, "Voila!"

63
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,227
That's French.

64
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:27,021
That's two hats in one, miss.
For parties, for weddings.

65
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:31,581
Oh, but madame, this makes you
look like a vision, like a dream.

66
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,064
- Like a duck.
- No, thank you.

67
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:38,058
We're making this. We need
these things. Can you get them?

68
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:41,742
Oh, oh, oh, this is a big job, miss.

69
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:44,218
Oh, bigger than the others.
No, no. This is gonna cost.

70
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:47,062
Same as always. One bag of seed.

71
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:49,376
- You call this pay?
- It's chicken feed.

72
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,656
- What else could we give you?
- Eggs.

73
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,540
- Eggs?
- Eggs.

74
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,475
We can't give you our
eggs. They're too valuable.

75
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,375
And so are we.

76
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:02,934
After you, Fetcher.

77
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,970
After I what?

78
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:06,973
- Move!
- Ooh!

79
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:16,295
Hmm.

80
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,456
Twenty-Two and nine.

81
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:21,490
Fourteen shillings and threepence.

82
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:24,489
Seven and sixpence times three.

83
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,454
Two and nine.

84
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:29,653
Fourpence halfpenny.

85
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:33,093
D
- Oh! Stupid, worthless creatures!

86
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,927
I'm sick and tired of
making minuscule profits.

87
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:51,244
Hmm.

88
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:57,502
Hmm!

89
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:59,846
Oh, yes.

90
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:02,082
Those chickens are up to something.

91
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:04,658
Quiet. I'm onto something.

92
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:07,164
They're organized. I know it.

93
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,519
- I said, quiet.
- That ginger one.

94
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:11,438
I reckon she's their leader.

95
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:13,524
- Mr. Tweedy!

96
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,198
I may finally have found a way to
make us some real money around here,

97
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,122
And what are you on about?

98
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,042
Ridiculous notions of escaping chickens.

99
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:24,876
- But... But...
- It's all in your head, Mr. Tweedy. Say it!

100
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:28,436
It's all in me head.
It's all in me head.

101
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,559
Now, you keep telling yourself that,

102
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:34,315
Because I don't want to
hear another word about it.

103
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,871
- Is that clear?
- Yes, love.

104
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:39,569
But you know that ginger one...

105
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:42,197
They're chickens, you dolt!

106
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:45,932
Apart from you, they're the most
stupid creatures on this planet.

107
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:49,631
They don't plot, they don't
scheme, and they are not organized!

108
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:54,795
- Order! Order!

109
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,629
- Quiet, everyone. Settle down.

110
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:02,828
I would like to call to order...
Please, if you could just settle...

111
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:06,108
Let's have some discipline
in the ranks! What, what!

112
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:08,272
- Thank you, Fowler.
- In my R.A.F. Days,

113
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,146
We were never allowed to waste
time with unnecessary chitchat.

114
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:13,465
Yes, thank you, Fowler.

115
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,226
I...

116
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:21,144
Right!

117
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:25,867
Carry on.

118
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:29,703
Now, I know our last escape
attempt was a bit of a fiasco,

119
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,927
But Mac and I have come
up with a brand-New plan.

120
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:32,662
- Show 'em, Mac.
- Right.

121
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:34,361
We tried going under the
wire and that didn't work.

122
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,899
So, the plan is, we go over it.

123
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,840
- This is us, right?

124
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,265
We get in like this.

125
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,057
Wind her up and... let her go!

126
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:58,056
Good grief! The turnip's bought it!

127
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:03,576
Farmer's coming!

128
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:10,893
Operation Cover-Up!

129
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:14,233
Whee!

130
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:17,293
Ouch!

131
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:24,330
Hmm.

132
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:30,330
Huh?

133
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:38,133
- Mr. Tweedy!
- Ooh. Ouch.

134
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:41,968
- Where are you?
- Ooh. It's all in your head.

135
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:45,846
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

136
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,725
Think, everyone, think.
What haven't we tried yet?

137
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,609
Uh...

138
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:55,084
We haven't tried not trying to escape.

139
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,321
Hmm. That might work.

140
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,488
What about Edwina?

141
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:03,247
How many more empty nests will it take?

142
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:07,082
Perhaps it wouldn't be empty if she'd spent
more time layin' and less time escapin'.

143
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,166
So laying eggs all your life...

144
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,681
And then getting plucked, stuffed
and roasted is good enough for you?

145
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:14,764
It's a livin'.

146
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,525
You know what the problem is?

147
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,359
The fences aren't just round the
farm. They're up here in your heads.

148
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,879
There's a better place out
there somewhere beyond that hill,

149
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:29,917
And it has wide open
spaces and lots of trees...

150
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,881
And grass.

151
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:36,716
Can you imagine that? Cool, green grass.

152
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:40,800
- Who feeds us?
- We feed ourselves.

153
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,039
- Well, where's the farm?
- There is no farm.

154
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:46,673
- Then where does the farmer live?
- There is no farmer, Babs.

155
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,272
- Is he on holiday?
- He isn't anywhere. Don't you get it?

156
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:54,191
There's no morning head count, no
farmers, no dogs and coops and keys...

157
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:57,117
And no fences.

158
00:16:57,152 --> 00:17:00,951
In all my life I've never
heard such a fantastic...

159
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,153
Load of tripe!

160
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,234
Oh, face the facts, ducks.

161
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:11,068
The chances of us gettin' out
of here are a million to one.

162
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:15,146
Then there's still a chance.

163
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:38,227
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. What am I doing?

164
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:42,061
Who are you trying to fool?
You can't lead this bunch of...

165
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:46,501
Oh, heaven help us.

166
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:59,538
Freedom!

167
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:02,977
Huh?

168
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:16,619
Whoa!

169
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:20,453
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You've been a wonderful audience.

170
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:25,013
- Ouch!
- Oh, yes.

171
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,493
That's it.

172
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:41,929
Get him inside quickly.

173
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,726
This is our way out of here.

174
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,491
We'll make posters?

175
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:56,325
No. What's on the poster, Babs.
What's on the poster. We'll fly out!

176
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:01,366
He must be very important to have his
picture taken. What do you suppose he does?

177
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:04,264
Isn't it obvious? He's a
professional flying rooster.

178
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:07,003
He flies from farm to
farm, giving demonstrations.

179
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:09,608
- Do you suppose?
- Oh, absolutely.

180
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:11,842
Not in the dark, no.
No, not in there. No.

181
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:14,441
Get out. Good. Gotta get...

182
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:22,119
Who are you? Where
am I? What's goin' on?

183
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:24,237
Ouch! What happened to my wing?

184
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:26,284
You took a rather nasty fall.

185
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,799
And sprained the anterior tendon
connecting your radius to your humerus.

186
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,683
I gave it a wee bit of a tweak,
Jimmy, and wrapped her up.

187
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:32,278
Was that English?

188
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,837
She said you sprained
your wing. She fixed it.

189
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,597
- I made the bandage.
- I-I carried you in.

190
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:40,361
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Whoa.

191
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:44,156
Let's back up and start
from the top. Where am I?

192
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,395
You're right. How rude of
us. We're just very excit...

193
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,391
This is a chicken farm.

194
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:51,319
And we're the chickens.

195
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:54,038
Yeah, with you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens...

196
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:57,672
I don't like the look of this one.
His eyes are too close together.

197
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:00,237
- Father, please.
- And he's a Yank!

198
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:02,832
Easy, Pops. Cockfighting's
illegal where I come from.

199
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,755
And where is that exactly?

200
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,710
Just a little place I call the land
of the free and the home of the brave.

201
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:10,710
- Scotland!
- No! America.

202
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:13,233
Oh! America.

203
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:17,068
Poppycock. Pushy Americans. Always
showing up late for every war.

204
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:22,227
Overpaid, oversexed and over here!

205
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:24,671
What's eatin' Grandpa?

206
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:27,031
Oh, don't mind him, Mister... Mister?

207
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:30,666
The name's Rocky. Rocky the Rhode
Island Red. Rhodes for short.

208
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:34,305
- Rocky Rhodes?
- Catchy, ain't it?

209
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,184
Um, Mr. Rhodes, is this you?

210
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:40,909
Uh, who wants to know?

211
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:42,988
A group of rather desperate chickens.

212
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:46,823
You see, if it is you, then you just
might be the answer to our prayers.

213
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:53,860
Well, then, call me a miracle,
doll face, 'cause that's me.

214
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,384
And what brings you
to England, Mr. Rhodes?

215
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,780
Why, all the beautiful
English chicks, of course.

216
00:21:01,815 --> 00:21:04,743
Give over!

217
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:07,023
You see, I'm a traveler by nature.

218
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,857
I did that whole barnyard thing for a
while, but I couldn't really get into it.

219
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:14,182
Hi. How are you? Nope.

220
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:16,180
The open road. That's more my style.

221
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:19,975
Yep, just give me a pack on my back
and point me where the wind blows.

222
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:23,734
In fact, you know what
they call me back home?

223
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:27,133
You're gonna love this.
The Lone Free Ranger.

224
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,898
- Ooh!
- Isn't that great?

225
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:32,532
- I knew it was possible.
- Oh, it's possible, all right.

226
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,377
- I knew the answer would come.
- Amen!

227
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:38,211
We're all going to fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes is going to show us how, right?

228
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,930
That's... What? Did you say "fly"?

229
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,470
- You can teach us.
- No, I can't.

230
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:49,374
Listen. Shh...
You hear that?

231
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:53,209
That's the open road calling my name,
and I was born to answer that call. Bye.

232
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:57,052
He must have very good hearing.

233
00:21:57,087 --> 00:22:00,887
Okay, okay, where's
the exit? Ah, this way.

234
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:05,086
Mr. Rhodes, um, perhaps I didn't
explain our situation properly.

235
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:07,570
We lay eggs day in and day out,

236
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:10,089
And when we can't lay
any more, they kill us.

237
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:13,924
It's a cruel world, doll face.
You might as well get used to it.

238
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:17,602
Which part of "they kill
us" do you not understand?

239
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,608
I got my own set of
problems to worry about.

240
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:21,801
Besides, this birdcage can't
be that hard to bust out of.

241
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:24,247
In fact, watch me.

242
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:28,081
It's not so hard to get one
chicken out of here or even two,

243
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:31,125
But this is about all of us.

244
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,879
- All of you?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.

245
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:36,764
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.

246
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,238
You want to get every chicken in this
place out of here at the same time?

247
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:43,602
- Of course.
- You're certifiable.

248
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,996
You can't pull off a stunt
like that. That's suicide.

249
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,522
Where there's a will, there's a way.

250
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:49,436
Couldn't agree more. I
will be leaving that way.

251
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:51,316
But...

252
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:53,039
- Mr. Rhodes, please...
- I'm the type of guy

253
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:56,873
That likes to roam
around I'm never in one...

254
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:18,149
So that's it. You're from the circus.

255
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:20,033
Shh!

256
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:21,988
You're on the run, aren't you?

257
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:23,953
You wanna keep it down?

258
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:26,768
I'm trying to lay low here.

259
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:29,512
I should turn you in right now.

260
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:33,266
- You wouldn't. Would you?
- Give me one reason why I shouldn't.

261
00:23:33,301 --> 00:23:36,586
Because I'm... cute?

262
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:41,949
Hey, hey, hey! What kind
of crazy chick are you?

263
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:45,064
- Do you know what'll happen if he finds me?
- It's a cruel world.

264
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,989
I just decided. I don't like you.

265
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:49,744
I just decided. I don't
care. Now, show us how to fly.

266
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:52,422
- With this wing?
- Teach us then.

267
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:53,707
No!

268
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:56,601
He's valuable, you say?

269
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:59,425
- Sure.
- Get the torch.

270
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,661
Now you listen here, sister.
I'm not going back to that life.

271
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:05,380
I'm a Lone Free Ranger.
Emphasis on free!

272
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:08,179
And that's what we want. Freedom!

273
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:13,578
Fancy that.
They're coming this way.

274
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:15,837
Oh, oh, no. No. Oh,
no. They're on to me.

275
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,377
Teach us to fly and we'll hide you.

276
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:20,242
And if I don't?

277
00:24:20,277 --> 00:24:23,616
Was your father by any chance a vulture?

278
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:27,414
Do we have a deal?

279
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:46,131
Time to make good on that deal, doll...

280
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,971
The name is Ginger.

281
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:07,372
- Comfortable?
- Not really.

282
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:11,206
- Maybe this will help.
- Nice hideout.

283
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:14,409
Ouch. I had more room in my egg.

284
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:17,965
We've held up our end of the
deal. Tomorrow you hold up yours.

285
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,889
- What deal?
- The flying!

286
00:25:19,924 --> 00:25:21,923
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right,
right, right. Don't worry.

287
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,843
I'll teach you everything I know.

288
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:26,843
Now, which bunk is mine?

289
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:32,925
Absolutely outrageous!

290
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,841
Asking a senior officer
to share his quarters...

291
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:38,397
And with a noncommissioned
Yank, no less.

292
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:41,415
- Why, back in my day, I'd never...
- Hey!

293
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,364
You weren't exactly
my first choice either.

294
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:46,602
And scoot over. Your wing's
on my side of the bunk.

295
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:50,437
Your side of the bunk? The whole
bunk is my side of the bunk!

296
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:54,876
Just... What's that
smell? Is that your breath?

297
00:25:55,477 --> 00:25:59,275
It's absolutely outrageous.

298
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:07,120
So you wanna fly, huh?

299
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:10,953
Well, it ain't gonna be easy, and it
ain't gonna happen overnight either.

300
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,913
You see, flying takes three things.

301
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:16,712
Hard work, perseverance and...

302
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:20,036
- Hard work.
- You said hard work twice!

303
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:23,830
That's because it takes twice
as much work as perseverance.

304
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,549
Codswallop!

305
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:33,428
Now, the most important thing
is we have to work as a team,

306
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:38,467
Which means... you do
everything I tell you.

307
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:44,306
Right! Let's rock and roll.

308
00:26:51,064 --> 00:26:54,024
- Oh. Oh, oh.
- Oh. Oh, oh.

309
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:24,697
Mrs. Tweedy! The chickens are...

310
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:28,221
Pecking?

311
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:32,056
And left, two, three.
And right, two, three.

312
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:36,775
And... stop right there. Oh, yeah, down.

313
00:27:37,015 --> 00:27:40,575
Down. Yeah, yeah, make little
circles. That's it. Faster.

314
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,374
Faster. Oh, yes. Perfect.

315
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:49,291
Oh, that's the spot.

316
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,969
I thought you were going
to teach us how to fly.

317
00:28:01,004 --> 00:28:03,494
That's what I'm doing.

318
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:06,527
Isn't there usually
some flapping involved?

319
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:09,727
Hey, do I tell you how to lay eggs?

320
00:28:09,762 --> 00:28:12,172
Relax. We're making progress.

321
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:16,006
Really? I can't help feeling
we're going around in circles.

322
00:28:17,326 --> 00:28:21,125
What the... Hey! Cut it
out! You're making me dizzy.

323
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:23,889
I think they're ready to fly now.

324
00:28:23,924 --> 00:28:27,724
Good, because they
certainly can't walk anymore.

325
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:32,602
Up and at 'em, gals. Let's flap.

326
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:40,000
Watch, Fetcher. Let's see if old
Attila the Hen has come to her senses.

327
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,879
It's raining hen!

328
00:28:53,957 --> 00:28:56,557
- What's this caper, love?
- We're flying.

329
00:28:56,592 --> 00:28:58,442
Obviously.

330
00:28:58,477 --> 00:29:02,277
- Flippin' hell. Look at this, Fetch.
- They're gonna kill themselves.

331
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:07,275
- Wanna watch?
- Yeah, all right.

332
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:13,833
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

333
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:16,157
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

334
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:19,992
Hey! Careful of those eggs!

335
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:28,110
Sunny-Side up.

336
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:32,871
Now they're over easy!

337
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,669
Definitely scrambled.

338
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:38,553
Go! Go! Go!

339
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:41,308
Go, go, go, go! Go!

340
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:44,027
Poultry in motion!

341
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,704
Birds of a feather flop together.

342
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:07,187
Great work, ladies. Great work!

343
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,821
The pain you're feeling
is a good thing. It's good.

344
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:12,386
Pain is your friend, okay?
It's a positive thing.

345
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:16,021
Just keep the faith there, uh... What
was your name? Agnes! You'll get there.

346
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:17,905
Ducky, I think you flew four feet today.

347
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,700
Right, four feet! From
the roof to the ground.

348
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:24,459
It's all part of the process,
ladies. Nothing to worry about.

349
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:26,658
Ya cheese-Eating little...

350
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,502
Whoa!

351
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:32,262
That doesn't sound good. Ha, ha, ha.

352
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,977
Okay, the ground's
shaking. Are we worried?

353
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:38,735
Are we worried?

354
00:30:43,254 --> 00:30:46,535
The circus. Quick. Hide me.

355
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,539
- Hide me.
- Come on.

356
00:30:48,574 --> 00:30:52,333
One isn't awarded a medal like this
for flapping about like a lunatic, what.

357
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:56,616
Now, see here! This is
an officer's quarters.

358
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:59,091
- Quick. In here.
- Get out of here immediately, sir!

359
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:01,256
Give it a rest, Pops.

360
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:05,090
Out of here! I shall have you
on a charge within the week.

361
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,681
Cheers, mate.

362
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:52,280
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

363
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:56,399
It's all in your head.

364
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,603
Ooh!

365
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:04,157
What... What... What's all this then?

366
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:06,322
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy.

367
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:10,157
No more wasting time with petty egg
collection and minuscule profits.

368
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:14,236
No more eggs? But we've
always been egg farmers.

369
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:17,594
Me father and his father and all
their fathers. They was always...

370
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:20,371
Poor! Worthless. Nothings.

371
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:23,078
But all that's about to change.

372
00:32:23,113 --> 00:32:26,552
This will take Tweedy's
farm out of the dark ages...

373
00:32:26,587 --> 00:32:30,309
And into full-Scale
automated production.

374
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:34,032
- Melisha Tweedy will
be poor no longer.

375
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:37,516
Ooh!

376
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:41,350
I'll put it together then, shall I?

377
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:48,274
This isn't good, Mac.

378
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,108
Whatever's in those boxes is for us,
and I don't think it's softer hay.

379
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:54,631
Aye, hen. And I hate
to be the voice of doom,

380
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:58,426
But I've been calculating my figures, and
I just don't think we're built for flyin'.

381
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:02,705
But I saw him. He flew
in over that fence.

382
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,590
Aye, aye, I believe you,

383
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:08,424
But if we could just see it for
ourselves, that may answer some questions.

384
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:10,989
You're right. I'm sorry.

385
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:13,427
We've been at this all week,
and we're getting nowhere.

386
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:17,261
If his wing were better, he could...
Oh! I'll have a word with him.

387
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:26,024
Where is he?

388
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:29,898
They didn't give me this
medal for being a Yank nanny.

389
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:32,139
A simple "I don't know" would suffice.

390
00:33:32,174 --> 00:33:35,295
Beware of that one, young Ginger.

391
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,382
That Yank is not to be trusted.

392
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:42,216
That Yank is our ticket out of here.

393
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:46,335
And the pig says to the horse,
"Hey, fella, why the long face?"

394
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:51,134
Oh, oh, look, look.

395
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:54,111
Oh. Cocktail!

396
00:33:54,146 --> 00:33:57,053
Give over!

397
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:03,693
So, um, anyway...

398
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:08,531
Remember those flying tips
tomorrow. They're very important.

399
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:11,450
Keep thinking those flighty thoughts.

400
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:13,735
Oh, yeah.

401
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,654
They're swell chicks. They really are.

402
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:19,489
Look at what Babs made me. A beak
warmer. Isn't that the cutest?

403
00:34:20,528 --> 00:34:24,047
And that Bunty. She
really packs a punch.

404
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:26,492
Is there a problem here?

405
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:28,571
- Have we flown over that fence?
- Not quite.

406
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:30,286
Then there's a problem.

407
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:31,966
Good things come to
those who wait, doll face.

408
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:35,764
Ginger!

409
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:43,103
Okay, how long did it take you?

410
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:44,404
To do what?

411
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:46,289
To learn how to fly.

412
00:34:46,324 --> 00:34:49,203
Apples and oranges, baby
doll. I'm gifted. They're not.

413
00:34:49,238 --> 00:34:51,606
You can't compare the two, okay?

414
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:53,721
The point is, these things take time.

415
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:55,766
Which we are rapidly running out of.

416
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:56,823
We haven't even lifted
off the ground. Why?

417
00:34:56,824 --> 00:34:57,846
Thrust.

418
00:34:57,881 --> 00:35:01,680
I went over my calculations, and I figured
the key element we're missing is thrust.

419
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,443
L
- I didn't get a word of that.

420
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:09,358
Thrust! Other birds
like ducks and geese,

421
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,237
When they take off, what
do they have? Thrust.

422
00:35:11,717 --> 00:35:14,481
I swear she ain't usin' real words.

423
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:17,361
- She said we need more thrust.
- Oh, thrust.

424
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:19,295
Well, of course, we need thrust.
Thrust and flying are like this.

425
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:21,196
That's flying and that's thrust.

426
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:25,655
- Would you excuse us?
- Aye.

427
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,599
Ah, the wing, the wing, the wing.

428
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:31,873
If we don't see some results by tomorrow,
the deal is off, and you're on your own.

429
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:35,113
No more hiding. The farmers will find
you, and it's back to the circus, flyboy.

430
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:39,591
You're the first chick I ever
met with the shell still on.

431
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:44,830
Sleep tight, angel face.
The Rock's on the case.

432
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,070
Ginger!

433
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,274
Whew!

434
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:56,108
Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!
What, what.

435
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:02,031
- Oh, it was a beaut, guv'nor.
- Hmm?

436
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:05,350
A fine piece of work,
if I do say so meself.

437
00:36:05,385 --> 00:36:08,085
- I say so meself too.
- I wish I could have seen it.

438
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,785
We slipped into the farmer's
room, all quiet like.

439
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,201
- Like a fish.
- Yeah, and we...

440
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:17,583
"Like a fish"? You stupid Norbert.

441
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:20,229
Anyway, guv, here it is.

442
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:23,067
- El merchandiso.
- That's Spanish.

443
00:36:23,102 --> 00:36:26,902
- What are these two crooks doing here?
- So, you know each other.

444
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:29,146
She don't think we're valuable.

445
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:31,786
Guys, you are without
a doubt the sneakiest,

446
00:36:31,821 --> 00:36:34,980
Most light-Fingered thieving
parasites I've ever met.

447
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:38,140
- Oh, don't, don't. Stop it.
- I've gone bright red.

448
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,462
So, uh, how about them eggs?

449
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:42,458
- Eggs? Don't tell me you promised them...
- Yep!

450
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:45,834
Promised them every
egg I lay this month.

451
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:48,341
And when can we expect
the first installment?

452
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:52,175
I'm brewing one up as we speak,
guys. I'll keep you posted.

453
00:36:53,095 --> 00:36:55,696
Pleasure doing business with you, sir.

454
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:59,260
Sucker.

455
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:01,459
- What?
- You've lied to them.

456
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:05,294
I didn't lie, doll face. I
just... omitted certain truths.

457
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:07,378
I'll give them exactly what I promised.

458
00:37:07,412 --> 00:37:10,053
- Which is nothing.
- Which is what I'll give them.

459
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:13,092
And what will you give us?

460
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:16,890
Thrust!

461
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:20,810
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good.

462
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,694
Now this is just a little helper.

463
00:37:23,729 --> 00:37:26,528
Something to get you going.
It's a thrust exercise.

464
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:29,327
- The tension's killing me.
- It's gonna kill her!

465
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:33,087
- Release!
- Whoa!

466
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:39,725
Come on! Flap!

467
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:44,845
You can do it. Flap, flap, flap!

468
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:51,443
Yes, yes, yes!

469
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:55,443
Is that your first offense?

470
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,040
Oops.

471
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:13,398
Roll call! I haven't laid any eggs.

472
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:16,004
- Hide me.
- Three days and not one.

473
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,218
Oh, no!

474
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:18,398
- Why didn't you tell us, Babs?
- Hide me!

475
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:20,438
We've been so busy with the flying...

476
00:38:20,473 --> 00:38:22,236
- They're coming!
- Hide me!

477
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:24,716
Hide yourself!

478
00:38:32,075 --> 00:38:35,874
Oh!

479
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:26,303
Double their food rations, Mr. Tweedy.

480
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:29,182
I want them all as fat as this one.

481
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:32,986
Oh!

482
00:39:33,021 --> 00:39:36,821
All of me life flashed before me eyes!

483
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:40,825
It was really borin'.

484
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,659
Chicken feed. My favorite!

485
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:46,739
Wait. Wait.

486
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:53,103
Ooh!

487
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:56,897
No. Wait!

488
00:39:57,976 --> 00:40:01,776
Babs, please! Bunty! Stop it! Wait!

489
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:05,774
Stop!

490
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:12,218
Stop it!

491
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:16,052
Something is wrong
here. Can't you see that?

492
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:18,737
Strange boxes arrive in the barn.

493
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:20,972
Babs stops laying, but they
don't take her to the chop,

494
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:23,215
And now they're giving us extra food.

495
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,690
Don't you see what's happening?
They're fattening us up.

496
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:30,290
- They're going to kill us all.

497
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:34,089
Whoa, whoa! Heavy alert.

498
00:40:34,368 --> 00:40:36,689
- She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind?

499
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:38,773
Keep eating. Save some for me.

500
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:42,091
What are you doing? How
dare you! Let go of me!

501
00:40:42,126 --> 00:40:45,887
Listen. I've met some hard-Boiled eggs in
my day, but I'd say you're about 20 minutes.

502
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:50,125
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you got to lighten up.

503
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,050
Over in America, we have this rule.

504
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:55,384
If you want to motivate
someone, don't mention death.

505
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,411
Funny. Over here, the rule
is: Always tell the truth.

506
00:40:58,446 --> 00:41:01,369
That's been working like
a real charm, hasn't it?

507
00:41:01,404 --> 00:41:04,882
Here's some free advice. You want them to
perform? Tell them what they wanna hear.

508
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:07,326
You mean lie.

509
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:10,961
Here we go again. You
know what your problem is?

510
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:12,965
You're... difficult.

511
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,760
Why? Because I'm honest? I
care about what happens to them,

512
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,399
Something I wouldn't expect a lone
free ranger to know anything about.

513
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,918
If this is the way you show it,
I hope you never care about me.

514
00:41:22,953 --> 00:41:26,717
- I can assure you, I
never will. - Good! - Fine!

515
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:14,792
What's all this?

516
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:18,627
Well, here she is. Ask
and you shall receive.

517
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:22,586
- That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship is what it is.

518
00:42:22,621 --> 00:42:25,402
- Solid as a rock.
- Ooh!

519
00:42:25,437 --> 00:42:28,149
- It's supposed to do that.

520
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:31,983
- It's perfect, guys.
- And how's that egg coming?

521
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:35,743
This is a double yolker.

522
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,901
I don't see what
this has to do with...

523
00:42:45,936 --> 00:42:48,145
You will.

524
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,184
We've been workin' too hard.

525
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,819
Time to kick back a bit,
shake those tail feathers.

526
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:56,458
Look at him. Nellypodging
around like a...

527
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,702
Oh, good heavens. What's happenin'?

528
00:42:58,737 --> 00:43:02,537
That's called a beat, sister.
Feel it pulsing through your body?

529
00:43:03,177 --> 00:43:06,356
Oh, yes. Pulsing. Fancy that.

530
00:43:06,391 --> 00:43:09,863
Hey, well, then go with it, baby.

531
00:43:09,898 --> 00:43:13,335
Oh, my. Look! I'm going with it!

532
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:16,778
Bunty, what's got into you?

533
00:43:16,813 --> 00:43:18,893
Same thing that's got
into you apparently.

534
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:21,419
Flip, flop, fly

535
00:43:21,454 --> 00:43:23,652
- I don't care if I die
- Just go with the flow, gal!

536
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,933
- Flip, flop, fly
- Let it go!

537
00:43:25,968 --> 00:43:28,456
I don't care if I die

538
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:31,536
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-Bye

539
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:34,809
Now, see here. I don't
recall authorizing a hop.

540
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:36,811
Oh, shut up and dance.

541
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:40,569
Oh! Oh!

542
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:46,007
What are you sobbing about,
you nancy?

543
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:50,806
Little moments like this, mate. It's
what makes the job all worthwhile.

544
00:43:55,645 --> 00:43:59,405
Wanna dance?

545
00:43:59,526 --> 00:44:01,410
Yeah, all right.

546
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:04,844
Now, give me one more kiss
Hold it a long, long time

547
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:06,488
Huh?

548
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:10,282
Give me one more kiss
Hold it a long, long time

549
00:44:11,603 --> 00:44:13,962
Love me, baby, till the
feelin' hits my head like wine

550
00:44:13,997 --> 00:44:16,002
So fine So glad you're mine

551
00:44:16,037 --> 00:44:18,166
Flip, flop, fly

552
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:20,885
I don't care if I die

553
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,719
Flip, flop, fly I don't care if I die

554
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:28,798
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-Bye

555
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:33,243
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-Bye

556
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:37,077
Yeah, don't ever leave
me Don't ever say good-Bye

557
00:44:37,356 --> 00:44:40,157
- Yeah
- Ooh!

558
00:44:42,915 --> 00:44:46,715
Did ya see that? I flew!

559
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:49,879
Attagirl, Babsy. Attagirl.

560
00:44:49,914 --> 00:44:53,433
- Oh! Your wing. It's better.
- Well...

561
00:44:53,468 --> 00:44:55,930
- How about that?
- Fantastic.

562
00:44:55,965 --> 00:44:58,939
You can fly for us tomorrow.

563
00:44:58,974 --> 00:45:01,912
Uh, uh, yeah, so it seems.

564
00:45:01,947 --> 00:45:03,476
I flew! I flew!

565
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:07,195
Looks like I owe you an apology.

566
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,670
I didn't think you cared
about us, but after all this...

567
00:45:10,705 --> 00:45:13,346
Well, it seems I was wrong.

568
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,953
Hey, easy, Miss Hard-Boiled.

569
00:45:15,988 --> 00:45:18,348
I might think you're turning soft.

570
00:45:22,628 --> 00:45:26,427
Uh, listen, there's
something I got to tell ya.

571
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:29,146
I...

572
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,864
No. You'd better wait here.

573
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:02,979
Ooh, that's champion,
that is. What is it?

574
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:06,058
It's a pie machine, you idiot.

575
00:46:06,092 --> 00:46:08,777
Chickens go in, pies come out.

576
00:46:08,812 --> 00:46:11,133
Ooh! What kind of pies?

577
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,421
- Apple.
- My favorite!

578
00:46:13,456 --> 00:46:17,256
Chicken pies, you great
lummox! Imagine it.

579
00:46:18,535 --> 00:46:21,495
In less than a fortnight,
every grocers' in the county...

580
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,451
Will be stocked with box upon box...

581
00:46:24,486 --> 00:46:27,373
Of Mrs. Tweedy's Homemade Chicken Pies.

582
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:28,979
Just Missus?

583
00:46:29,014 --> 00:46:32,012
Woman's touch. Makes the
public feel more comfortable.

584
00:46:32,047 --> 00:46:35,297
Oh, right. How does it work?

585
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:39,090
Get me a chicken and I'll show you.

586
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:41,890
I know just the one.

587
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:48,649
I've got a score to settle with you.

588
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:52,569
Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!

589
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,487
We mustn't panic.
We mustn't panic!

590
00:46:59,926 --> 00:47:01,810
Quiet there!

591
00:47:01,845 --> 00:47:05,645
Quiet, I say! Let's have
some discipline, what, what.

592
00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:09,484
The enemy has taken a prisoner.
This calls for retaliation!

593
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:12,728
- Retaliation!
- What's going on? What's happening?

594
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:16,562
They got Ginger, Mr. Rhodes.
They're taking her to the chop!

595
00:47:16,802 --> 00:47:20,602
Well, what are you waiting for,
laddie? Fly over there. Save her!

596
00:47:20,961 --> 00:47:24,760
Of course... No, no! No,
that's just what they'd expect.

597
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:27,441
But I say we give them the
old element of surprise.

598
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:30,097
And catch Jerry with his trousers down.

599
00:47:30,132 --> 00:47:32,719
I like the sound of
that. What's the plan?

600
00:47:32,754 --> 00:47:34,916
The plan... The plan.

601
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:37,042
The plan... Uh, Babs!

602
00:47:37,077 --> 00:47:40,877
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.

603
00:47:51,356 --> 00:47:53,240
Whoa.

604
00:47:53,275 --> 00:47:55,715
Look at the size of that thing.

605
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:02,158
Oh, no!

606
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:05,252
Chickens go in,

607
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:08,312
Pies come out.

608
00:48:09,711 --> 00:48:11,556
Chicken pies.

609
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:13,471
Not... Not apple pies.

610
00:48:13,506 --> 00:48:17,269
Chicken!

611
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,288
Oh, great. Brilliant!

612
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:26,794
- Yo, baby doll!
- Rocky!

613
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:29,232
- I'm coming!
- Hurry!

614
00:48:29,267 --> 00:48:31,832
- I'm still coming!
- Come on!

615
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,666
- Stop this thing!
- I'm gettin' there!

616
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:39,625
Oh, shoot!

617
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,670
Rocky!

618
00:48:41,705 --> 00:48:44,544
I'll be down before you can say...

619
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:46,183
Mixed vegetables!

620
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:48,662
Aaaah!

621
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:53,062
Aaah! Ohh!

622
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:59,140
Whoa-Ohh-Ohh-Ohh!

623
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,679
Whoa-Ohh-Ohh!

624
00:49:06,714 --> 00:49:08,504
D
- Oh! Get it?

625
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:11,118
- Dough!
- I'm stuck!

626
00:49:11,153 --> 00:49:13,697
Nothing to it. Oops.

627
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:25,655
Ohh! Oh!

628
00:49:28,454 --> 00:49:32,254
Hang on!

629
00:49:34,414 --> 00:49:38,253
Look out!

630
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:44,172
Whoa!

631
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,409
Hey! Aha!

632
00:49:58,408 --> 00:50:02,167
Yes!

633
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:09,286
Oh, it's like an oven in here.

634
00:50:18,004 --> 00:50:19,730
Come on!

635
00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:23,124
Wait up! I'm com...

636
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:25,780
Don't leave...

637
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,402
Get over to the...

638
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,879
The door! Come on!

639
00:51:01,915 --> 00:51:04,994
She's gonna blow! Run!

640
00:51:06,632 --> 00:51:09,358
Huh?

641
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:11,752
What did you do, you great pudding?

642
00:51:11,787 --> 00:51:15,551
I didn't do 'owt!

643
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:25,630
- Turn it off!
- It won't turn off!

644
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:50,944
- Ouch!
- We've got to show the others. Come on.

645
00:51:59,262 --> 00:52:01,501
Look! I fixed it!

646
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:03,261
Huh?

647
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,827
- Chicken pies?
- Ohh! - Oh, no!

648
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:11,741
- Yes, but...
- I don't want to be a pie.

649
00:52:11,776 --> 00:52:14,824
I don't like gravy.

650
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:18,138
Ladies, please. Let's
not lose our heads.

651
00:52:18,173 --> 00:52:21,937
Lose our heads?

652
00:52:27,657 --> 00:52:31,496
What I meant to say was, Rocky sabotaged
the machine and bought us more time.

653
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:33,380
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

654
00:52:33,415 --> 00:52:36,494
And better still, he's
going to fly for us tomorrow.

655
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:39,574
And once we've seen
how's it done, we'll get it.

656
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:41,458
So don't worry,

657
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:45,252
Because tomorrow everything's
going to go much, much smoother.

658
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:57,290
All right, Pops, what did I do now?

659
00:52:57,325 --> 00:53:00,489
A very brave and honorable deed, sir.

660
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,494
In the light of your
action this evening, I...

661
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:08,327
I dutifully admit that I
have misjudged your character.

662
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:13,486
So I present you with
this medal for bravery.

663
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:15,771
And...

664
00:53:15,806 --> 00:53:19,565
I salute you.

665
00:53:20,204 --> 00:53:21,890
In honor of the occasion,

666
00:53:21,925 --> 00:53:25,364
I surrender the bunk entirely.

667
00:53:25,399 --> 00:53:28,803
I shall sleep under the stars.

668
00:53:30,044 --> 00:53:33,803
Oh, uh, I await tomorrow's
flying demonstration...

669
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:37,761
With great anticipation.

670
00:53:38,921 --> 00:53:42,721
You and me both, Pops.

671
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:51,723
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Were you...

672
00:53:51,758 --> 00:53:54,203
- Is this your... I'll get down.
- No, no, it's just...

673
00:53:54,238 --> 00:53:56,317
- Since you're here...
- No, I'm glad you're here, because...

674
00:53:56,352 --> 00:53:58,237
- I'm sorry. You go first.
- You go ahead. I'll...

675
00:54:00,077 --> 00:54:02,601
Um, I just wanted to say...

676
00:54:02,636 --> 00:54:05,476
I may have been a bit harsh at first.

677
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:08,715
Well, what I really mean is,

678
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,600
Thank you...

679
00:54:10,635 --> 00:54:13,194
For saving my life.

680
00:54:13,229 --> 00:54:15,753
For saving our lives.

681
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:17,917
You know,

682
00:54:17,952 --> 00:54:19,837
I come up here every night...

683
00:54:19,872 --> 00:54:23,672
And look out to that hill and just imagine
what it must be like on the other side.

684
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:26,196
It's funny, I've...

685
00:54:26,231 --> 00:54:29,710
I've never actually felt
grass beneath my feet.

686
00:54:29,745 --> 00:54:31,595
I'm sorry.

687
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,829
Here I am rambling on about hills and
grass, and you had something to say.

688
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:36,674
Uh,
y-Y-Yeah.

689
00:54:36,709 --> 00:54:40,509
Um, it's just that, y
- You know,

690
00:54:40,669 --> 00:54:44,468
Life as I've experienced
it, you know, out there,

691
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:47,566
Lone free rangin' and stuff, it's, uh,

692
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:50,151
It's full of disappointments and, uh...

693
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,986
What, you mean grass isn't
all it's cracked up to be?

694
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:54,870
Grass! Exactly. Grass.

695
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:57,749
It's always greener on the other side.

696
00:54:57,784 --> 00:55:01,583
And then you get there
and it's brown and prickly.

697
00:55:02,303 --> 00:55:06,103
You see what I'm tryin' to say?

698
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:11,062
What I'm trying to say is,

699
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,781
You're welcome.

700
00:55:15,816 --> 00:55:17,705
You know,

701
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,499
That hill is looking closer
tonight than it ever has before.

702
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,063
Oh!

703
00:55:26,098 --> 00:55:29,898
Well, good night... Rocky.

704
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:35,337
Good night... Ginger.

705
00:55:56,972 --> 00:56:00,611
Company, attention!

706
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:08,089
Well, today's the day,
girls. We're going to fly!

707
00:56:08,124 --> 00:56:10,614
I can feel it!

708
00:56:10,649 --> 00:56:13,969
Finally, we get to see a
real professional in action.

709
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:16,848
Better start warming
up. I'll go and get him.

710
00:56:16,883 --> 00:56:19,132
- Rocky. Knock
-Knock.

711
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,967
Everyone's waiting, so I told them to...

712
00:56:26,606 --> 00:56:30,404
R
- Rocky?

713
00:58:07,504 --> 00:58:10,029
Oh, a cannon.

714
00:58:10,064 --> 00:58:12,083
Aye, that would give you thrust.

715
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:14,067
I knew he was fake all along.

716
00:58:14,102 --> 00:58:17,901
In fact, I'm not even
certain he was American.

717
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,780
So, what's the next plan, hen?

718
00:58:20,815 --> 00:58:22,665
Let's face it.

719
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,579
The only way out of here
is wrapped in pastry.

720
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,424
Perhaps he just went on holiday.

721
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:32,618
Perhaps he just went to get
away from your infernal knitting!

722
00:58:32,653 --> 00:58:35,463
Ohh! Ohh!

723
00:58:35,498 --> 00:58:38,858
You were the one that was always
hitting him. See how you like it.

724
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:41,656
Don't push me, four-Eyes!

725
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:44,633
Quiet there!

726
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:46,541
Quiet, I say!

727
00:58:46,576 --> 00:58:50,215
Dissension in the ranks. Precisely
what Jerry would have wanted.

728
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,738
The old divide and conquer.

729
00:58:51,773 --> 00:58:55,574
A proper squadron work together,
like we did in my R.A.F. Days.

730
00:58:55,973 --> 00:58:58,593
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map...

731
00:58:58,628 --> 00:59:01,177
And old Whizzbang at
the tail-End Charlie.

732
00:59:01,212 --> 00:59:04,332
WingCo would give the call, hop
in the old crate, chocks away!

733
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:07,616
Wizard show it was.
That's how you get medals.

734
00:59:07,651 --> 00:59:11,450
Will you shut up about
your stupid blooming medals!

735
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,449
Ooh!

736
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:18,335
Ohh!

737
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:20,374
How dare you!

738
00:59:20,409 --> 00:59:22,772
Madam, forgive me.

739
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:24,808
A-As an officer, I offer my most...

740
00:59:40,524 --> 00:59:43,483
Fowler?

741
00:59:45,403 --> 00:59:47,843
Everyone, shut up!

742
00:59:49,163 --> 00:59:52,962
Eh?

743
00:59:56,161 --> 00:59:58,606
Fowler.

744
00:59:58,641 --> 01:00:00,980
What exactly is the R.A.F.?

745
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,387
What do you mean, what is it?

746
01:00:03,422 --> 01:00:06,490
The Royal Air Force is what.

747
01:00:06,525 --> 01:00:09,558
Then what's the "old crate"?

748
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:14,636
Ahh! There she is.

749
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,081
Gorgeous, isn't she?

750
01:00:17,116 --> 01:00:19,961
You mean, you flew in one of these?

751
01:00:19,996 --> 01:00:23,475
Beautifully built. In fact, there's
a bit of a story to that as well.

752
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,359
We were out on a "recce," you see.

753
01:00:25,394 --> 01:00:28,234
Ops had given the go-Ahead,
but the weather duffed up.

754
01:00:28,269 --> 01:00:30,999
Yes. Of course.

755
01:00:31,034 --> 01:00:33,917
We might actually be
able to pull this off.

756
01:00:33,952 --> 01:00:37,192
- We're still going to fly out of here.
- What, what?

757
01:00:37,227 --> 01:00:39,072
Fowler's provided the answer.

758
01:00:39,107 --> 01:00:40,956
I have?

759
01:00:40,991 --> 01:00:43,831
Uh, yes, yes, yes. Of course I have.

760
01:00:43,866 --> 01:00:45,767
Uh, how have I?

761
01:00:45,802 --> 01:00:47,670
We'll make...

762
01:00:47,705 --> 01:00:49,554
A crate.

763
01:00:49,589 --> 01:00:53,308
Mac, you'll handle the engineering.

764
01:00:53,343 --> 01:00:55,074
Babs, manufacturing.

765
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,228
Fowler will be chief aviation advisor.

766
01:00:57,263 --> 01:00:58,845
Bunty, eggs.

767
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,391
- Eggs?
- Eggs.

768
01:01:00,426 --> 01:01:03,627
Right, just like the ones
that rooster was gonna lay.

769
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:06,471
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they?

770
01:01:06,506 --> 01:01:09,385
- Don't they?
- No, it's a lady thing, apparently.

771
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,270
Ask your mum.

772
01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:14,544
One egg for every item on the
list. First payment in advance.

773
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,623
Right! When do we start?

774
01:01:16,658 --> 01:01:19,040
Come on!

775
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:22,148
Hey.

776
01:01:22,183 --> 01:01:25,221
Oh!

777
01:01:26,942 --> 01:01:29,546
Huh?

778
01:01:29,581 --> 01:01:33,080
What the dickens?

779
01:01:33,115 --> 01:01:36,579
Oh, gnomes now.

780
01:01:39,978 --> 01:01:43,037
Voila!

781
01:01:43,072 --> 01:01:46,097
Give me.

782
01:01:55,455 --> 01:01:58,574
Hmm?

783
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:01,695
Aah!

784
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:16,491
- Ohh!
- All right, here.

785
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:28,048
Eggs from heaven!

786
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:31,008
No! From her bum!

787
01:02:56,403 --> 01:03:00,047
Mmm?

788
01:03:00,082 --> 01:03:03,521
- Idiot!
- That was close.

789
01:03:03,556 --> 01:03:05,485
Too close.

790
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,321
We can't stop now. Come
on, everyone! Go for it!

791
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:12,120
Really go for it! Go, go, go, go!

792
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:15,919
- Mac, we need those
calculations quickly. - Uh-Huh.

793
01:03:15,954 --> 01:03:18,935
Agnes, that has to be really secure.

794
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,917
- Careful up there, Fowler!
- Roger!

795
01:03:21,952 --> 01:03:23,802
Bunty, give him a hand.

796
01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:25,676
Well done, Babs. Keep it up.

797
01:03:25,711 --> 01:03:29,474
No problem, doll face.

798
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,631
Oh, I'm the type of guy

799
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:46,849
That likes to roam around

800
01:03:46,884 --> 01:03:49,317
I'm never in one place

801
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:51,715
I roam from town to town

802
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,270
And when I found myself
fallin' for some girl

803
01:03:55,305 --> 01:03:57,206
I'd hop right in that car...

804
01:03:57,241 --> 01:03:59,109
And travel 'round the world

805
01:03:59,144 --> 01:04:01,348
'Cause I'm a wanderer

806
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:03,193
Yeah A wanderer

807
01:04:03,228 --> 01:04:05,708
I roam around and
'round Around and 'round

808
01:04:07,627 --> 01:04:08,987
'Cause I'm a wanderer

809
01:04:09,022 --> 01:04:10,587
Yeah, a wanderer

810
01:04:10,622 --> 01:04:11,911
Oh, boy.

811
01:04:11,946 --> 01:04:17,825
I roam around and 'round
Around and 'round, around

812
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,624
Come on.

813
01:04:21,985 --> 01:04:23,904
Please.

814
01:04:27,023 --> 01:04:30,782
Oh, no. He's fixed it.

815
01:04:34,701 --> 01:04:38,301
Get the chickens.

816
01:04:38,336 --> 01:04:41,438
Which ones?

817
01:04:41,473 --> 01:04:44,540
All of them.

818
01:04:49,098 --> 01:04:51,783
Me tools!

819
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:54,617
Why, you thieving little buggers!

820
01:04:54,652 --> 01:04:58,376
What's the plan?

821
01:05:00,176 --> 01:05:01,975
- Attack!
- Huh?

822
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:07,074
Nice plan.

823
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:10,374
Mrs. Tweedy!

824
01:05:11,134 --> 01:05:14,137
Aaaah! Mrs. Tweedy!

825
01:05:14,172 --> 01:05:16,972
The chickens are revolting!

826
01:05:17,007 --> 01:05:19,772
Finally, something we agree on.

827
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:21,571
Help! Mrs...

828
01:05:24,411 --> 01:05:26,150
Mmm... Mmm?

829
01:05:26,185 --> 01:05:28,918
Under the hut.

830
01:05:28,953 --> 01:05:31,650
Come on!

831
01:05:35,408 --> 01:05:38,168
- What have we done?
- This is it, everyone.

832
01:05:38,203 --> 01:05:40,053
We're escaping.

833
01:05:40,088 --> 01:05:42,332
- What, now?
- Now!

834
01:05:42,367 --> 01:05:45,446
- But, Ginger, she's not ready.
- Listen.

835
01:05:45,481 --> 01:05:48,526
We'll either die free
chickens or die trying.

836
01:05:50,605 --> 01:05:53,604
Are those the only choices?

837
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:56,605
- Let's do it.
- Scramble!

838
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:11,841
This way!

839
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:45,753
Mrs. Tweedy!

840
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:48,758
The exits are located here and here.

841
01:06:48,793 --> 01:06:51,173
In the quite likely
event of an emergency,

842
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:53,552
Put your head between your knees and...

843
01:06:53,587 --> 01:06:55,555
Kiss your bum good-Bye.

844
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,711
All right, Fowler, ready for takeoff.

845
01:06:57,746 --> 01:07:01,509
Behind you all the way.

846
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,269
But you're supposed to be up there.

847
01:07:04,304 --> 01:07:05,915
You're the pilot.

848
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:09,748
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I can't fly this contraption.

849
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:13,108
Back in your day...
the Royal Air Force...

850
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:15,907
6-4-4 Squadron,
poultry division.

851
01:07:15,942 --> 01:07:17,792
We were the mascots.

852
01:07:17,827 --> 01:07:20,465
You mean you never
actually flew the plane?

853
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,602
Good heavens, no.

854
01:07:22,437 --> 01:07:24,670
I'm a chicken.

855
01:07:24,705 --> 01:07:28,503
The Royal Air Force doesn't let chickens
behind the controls of a complex aircraft.

856
01:07:30,024 --> 01:07:32,108
We're all gonna die!

857
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:34,029
Fowler, you have to fly it.

858
01:07:34,064 --> 01:07:37,822
You're always talking about back in
your day. Well, today is your day.

859
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:43,381
You can do it, you old sausage.

860
01:07:44,381 --> 01:07:46,540
Wing Commander T.I. Fowler...

861
01:07:46,575 --> 01:07:48,461
Reporting for duty.

862
01:07:50,779 --> 01:07:53,584
Well, come on. What are you waiting for?

863
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:57,378
We haven't got all day. Let's
get this crate off the ground.

864
01:07:57,413 --> 01:07:59,294
Fowler! Now!

865
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:01,177
Roger! Contact!

866
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:16,455
Cleared for takeoff!

867
01:08:21,052 --> 01:08:25,012
Chocks away!

868
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:28,813
Whoa!

869
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:35,810
- Full throttle!
- Full throttle!

870
01:08:55,846 --> 01:08:58,210
We need more power!

871
01:08:58,245 --> 01:09:02,044
I cannot work miracles, Cap'n!
We're givin' her all she's got!

872
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:14,842
- Gotcha!
- Hard right!

873
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,562
Oh, mother!

874
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,280
Turn her around. I'll get the ramp.

875
01:09:33,718 --> 01:09:37,518
Aaah!

876
01:09:38,457 --> 01:09:41,956
Put the ramp down.

877
01:09:43,795 --> 01:09:46,075
You are going to be a pie!

878
01:09:49,555 --> 01:09:53,353
Ginger!

879
01:09:53,754 --> 01:09:57,552
Rocky!

880
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:07,150
Heads up!

881
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:19,713
Look out!

882
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:23,507
- Aah!
- Clear the runway!

883
01:10:41,424 --> 01:10:45,222
Ginger! Let's go!

884
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:51,661
We're flying!

885
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:04,459
- Aah!
- That's for leaving.

886
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:05,903
Eew.

887
01:11:05,938 --> 01:11:09,737
And this is for coming back.

888
01:11:10,537 --> 01:11:12,422
- Whoa!
- Uhh!

889
01:11:12,457 --> 01:11:15,461
Great Scot! What was that?

890
01:11:15,496 --> 01:11:19,295
A cling-On, Cap'n! And
the engines can't take it!

891
01:11:23,414 --> 01:11:26,093
Oh, goodness.

892
01:11:26,128 --> 01:11:28,772
Babs! Scissors!

893
01:11:28,807 --> 01:11:30,097
Bingo.

894
01:11:30,132 --> 01:11:31,778
Lower me down.

895
01:11:31,813 --> 01:11:33,492
- But, Ginger, I...
- Just do it.

896
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:35,777
Increase velocity!

897
01:11:35,812 --> 01:11:39,571
- What does that mean?
- It means pedal your flippin' giblets out!

898
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:55,608
- Lower!
- I'm trying!

899
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:01,126
- Aah!
- Aaah!

900
01:12:01,161 --> 01:12:04,205
- Fowler, look out!

901
01:12:10,205 --> 01:12:13,964
- Whoa!
- Oh! Ginger!

902
01:12:21,882 --> 01:12:25,680
Fire! Fire!

903
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:29,840
Me eggs.

904
01:12:30,161 --> 01:12:32,565
No!

905
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:36,358
Blea-Aah!

906
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,763
More ammo! Hurry!

907
01:12:38,798 --> 01:12:40,957
- We got no more eggs!
- Ginger!

908
01:12:40,992 --> 01:12:43,597
Look out!

909
01:12:50,476 --> 01:12:54,276
No!

910
01:13:04,873 --> 01:13:07,692
- Huh? -
Bye-Bye.

911
01:13:07,727 --> 01:13:10,511
- Aaah!
- Bombs away!

912
01:13:10,546 --> 01:13:13,276
Mr. Tweedy!

913
01:13:13,311 --> 01:13:17,071
Oh, that was good. That was good!

914
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:20,969
The old bird bought it!

915
01:13:21,004 --> 01:13:23,948
Mrs. Tweedy! Mrs. Twee...

916
01:13:41,224 --> 01:13:45,025
Whoa!

917
01:13:54,782 --> 01:13:58,581
I told you they was organized.

918
01:14:08,419 --> 01:14:10,338
We did it, everyone!

919
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:26,256
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

920
01:14:29,054 --> 01:14:30,954
Aww!

921
01:14:30,989 --> 01:14:32,818
Whoa!

922
01:14:32,853 --> 01:14:36,613
Keep peddling! We're not there yet!

923
01:14:39,173 --> 01:14:42,972
You can't see paradise
if you don't pedal!

924
01:14:44,931 --> 01:14:51,135
Put your drumsticks into it!

925
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,494
That's what I told him, what, what.

926
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:57,208
We were losing altitude, you see,
and heading for a fearful prang.

927
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,444
This is a lovely holiday.

928
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:01,612
I'll be sad to go back.

929
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:04,486
Safety at all times is imperative.

930
01:15:04,521 --> 01:15:06,423
Now, wind 'er up and...

931
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,325
- Whee!
- Let 'er go!

932
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,292
So...

933
01:15:10,327 --> 01:15:12,246
Is it as good as you imagined?

934
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:14,291
No.

935
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:17,369
It's better.

936
01:15:18,104 --> 01:15:21,203
Come on. I'll show
you how to play cricket.

937
01:15:24,323 --> 01:15:26,448
'Ey, 'ey, here's a thought.

938
01:15:26,483 --> 01:15:29,642
Why don't we get an egg and
start our own chicken farm?

939
01:15:29,677 --> 01:15:32,521
That way we'll have all
the eggs we could eat.

940
01:15:32,556 --> 01:15:35,040
Right. We'll need a chicken then.

941
01:15:35,075 --> 01:15:36,846
No. No, we'll need an egg.

942
01:15:36,881 --> 01:15:40,124
You have the egg first. That's
where you get the chicken from.

943
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,079
No, that's cobblers. If you don't have
a chicken, where you gonna get an egg?

944
01:15:43,114 --> 01:15:45,924
From the chicken that
comes from the egg.

945
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:48,803
Yeah, but you have to have
an egg to have a chicken.

946
01:15:48,838 --> 01:15:50,717
Yeah, but you gotta get the
chicken first to get the egg,

947
01:15:50,752 --> 01:15:54,556
And then the egg...
you get the chicken out.

948
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:58,355
Hang on. Let's go over this again.

949
01:16:05,673 --> 01:16:08,474
<i># All right. #</i>

950
01:16:08,509 --> 01:16:10,519

954

955
01:16:29,129 --> 01:16:33,169

956

01:16:36,728 --> 01:16:38,048

964
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:35,961

965
01:17:36,201 --> 01:17:40,040

966
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:44,640

967
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,479

968
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:51,919

969
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:53,599

970
01:17:53,839 --> 01:17:57,278
<i># Don't ever leave me,
don't ever say goodbye #</i>

971
01:17:57,518 --> 01:18:01,078
<i># Yeah! Bye-bye #</i>

972
01:19:16,554 --> 01:19:18,478
The egg, obviously.

973
01:19:18,513 --> 01:19:20,398
Rollin' along, happy as Larry.

974
01:19:20,433 --> 01:19:23,332
Then, crack! Hatches
into the first chicken.

975
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:25,918
Yeah, but where'd the
egg come from, then?

976
01:19:25,953 --> 01:19:27,472
What do you mean, where'd it come from?

977
01:19:27,507 --> 01:19:29,858
Egg comes rollin' along, happy as Larry.

978
01:19:29,893 --> 01:19:33,074
It's wonderin'
where'd it come from?

979
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:36,169
Without a chicken, you get
no egg to come rollin' along.

980
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:38,993
Well, conversely, without an
egg to hatch into the chicken,

981
01:19:39,028 --> 01:19:41,907
Then there will be no chicken to lay the
other egg that hatches into the chicken...

982
01:19:41,942 --> 01:19:43,653
That lays the egg I
mentioned in the first place.

983
01:19:43,687 --> 01:19:44,927
So we got two eggs now?

984
01:19:44,928 --> 01:19:47,567
No, we're still talking
about the very first egg.

985
01:19:47,602 --> 01:19:49,423
What happened about
the very first chicken?

986
01:19:49,224 --> 01:19:51,146
It's in the very first egg!

987
01:19:50,381 --> 01:19:54,025
- Don't you listenin'?
- Uh, guys, guys?

988
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:56,221
Tryin' to enjoy paradise over here.

989
01:19:56,656 --> 01:19:58,384
- Oh, sorry, guv.
- Beg your pardon.

990
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:01,424
- Won't happen again.
- Thanks.

991
01:20:01,859 --> 01:20:03,747
- Gitface.
- Pillock.

992
01:20:03,982 --> 01:20:07,062
Thinks he's such a big shot 'cause
he's got his name on a poster.

993
01:20:07,297 --> 01:20:09,467
These show biz folk are all the same.

994
01:20:09,002 --> 01:20:12,346
- Yeah, the rats are the stars, actually.
- Yeah, of course they are.

995
01:20:12,581 --> 01:20:14,021
- We do all the work,
- But he does get all the birds.

996
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:14,822
He gets all the credit.

997
01:20:15,296 --> 01:20:17,300
- He gets everything.
- Yes, he does. Everything.

998
01:20:17,335 --> 01:20:21,099
- You said it, mate.
- I know.
