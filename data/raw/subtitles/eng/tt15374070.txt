1
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,646
Why?

2
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:41,023
We did everything.

3
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,085
Okay, check it out.

4
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:10,381
Dune and Waterworld are, like,
the best movies in the last 30 years.

5
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:12,383
Did you see Kevin Costner?

6
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,010
He's a fucking merman.

7
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:17,013
Did you see the things behind his ears?
That's where the gills were.

8
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:19,890
-Right? He was like half fish.
-What about Dune?

9
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:21,308
Dune is '80s.

10
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,602
Waterworld's all water, and no Dune.

11
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:28,441
And also no Sting in the thong.
It was like a space thong.

12
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:30,860
Space thong? You talking about Sting?

13
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:33,863
You know what Sting does?
Are you aware of this?

14
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:35,072
He delivers albums.

15
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:39,035
Where's my fucking record, Grohl?

16
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:40,578
It's all up here.

17
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:42,580
-Is it?
-Yeah, it's all up here.

18
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:43,581
And in there,

19
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:44,749
and in there,

20
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:46,083
and in there,

21
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,668
and in there.

22
00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:49,795
Not so much here.

23
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,464
But I got it, man. It's all in here.

24
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:56,260
I think, personally, that
doesn't amount to a bucket of frozen shit.

25
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,846
-Okay.
-I don't know where you'd get one.

26
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:00,556
But that's what it's about.

27
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,019
When you tell me you've got a record,
all I got is a bucket of frozen shit.

28
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:07,188
I'm up to my eyeballs in debt.

29
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:09,648
And I gotta pay some crazy,

30
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:11,734
piece-of-shit motherfuckers,

31
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:13,569
who I owe so much money to.

32
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:16,155
And I just found out they may be the ones

33
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:20,076
who fucking sliced up
that journalist in Turkey.

34
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,828
I just wanna give you
the album that you want,

35
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:27,249
so you can pay off those people before
they turn your nutsack into a coin purse.

36
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,169
-Relax.
-Did you just say relax?

37
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:33,297
Yeah, so here's the thing.

38
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:35,091
We were thinking...

39
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:39,595
It's our tenth album, okay?
We can't do the same old shit.

40
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,639
We gotta break the mold on this one.

41
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:43,349
Yeah, Shill, this record,

42
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:47,436
it's gotta blow your fucking dick
right into your fucking mouth.

43
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,647
Blow your own dick into your mouth?

44
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,108
Yeah, right back up into your mouth, man.

45
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:54,151
Right back up into your mouth?

46
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:56,487
-Yeah.
-Like it's been there before?

47
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,614
What kind of goal is that?

48
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:02,159
I don't want that album
unless it makes me a lot of money.

49
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:04,704
Lot of money? Blow all the dicks you want.

50
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:09,083
Look, I can get you a studio
anywhere you want in town tomorrow.

51
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,795
We've used all those studios.
They all sound exactly the same.

52
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:16,298
Let's think outside the box,
go somewhere we've never been.

53
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:20,052
Let's go to a cool-- Like Zeppelin.
When Zeppelin went to the castle.

54
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:23,222
And there was the devil,
and wizards, and dragons, and shit.

55
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:26,142
You want me to find you
some wizards and dragons?

56
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:28,686
Yes, that's what we should be doing.

57
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:37,570
You want that? You want that?

58
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,157
Watch as I make this happen.

59
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,243
Holy shit.
You fuckers are not gonna believe it.

60
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,371
I got it.
You gotta trust me, let me do this.

61
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,003
Chilly Shills.
What can I do for you, sunshine?

62
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:58,424
Hey, Barb, I'm here
in my office with the Foo Fighters.

63
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:02,511
And they're looking
for a place to record a new album.

64
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:04,388
You thinking what I'm thinking?

65
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:07,141
Oh, I do know what you're thinking,

66
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:09,977
and I have the perfect place.

67
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:14,690
Foo Fighters, oh,
I thought this time would never come.

68
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:17,485
I gotta jump.
I'll shoot you the address in the a.m.

69
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:19,987
This place is to die for.

70
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:22,365
Pearl Jam high five. Up top.

71
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,202
Jeremy has fucking spoken.

72
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:53,729
Hi, Dave Grohl. I'm Barb Weems.

73
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:56,107
-I'm such a fan.
-Hi, Barb. How are you?

74
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,609
-Thank you.
-I'd love a selfie later, if that's okay.

75
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,111
-Okay.
-Hello, Foos.

76
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:02,780
How are you?
So nice to meet you. Barb Weems.

77
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:06,534
This is the house. It is incredible.
I can't wait to show you.

78
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:11,205
This place-- I know what you're thinking.
It needs a little sprucey goosey.

79
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,541
And I agree. But here's the thing.

80
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,377
This place has
serious rock 'n' roll pedigree.

81
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,546
I mean, it rolls deep.

82
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:27,555
A huge music manager
owned this place in the '70s and '80s

83
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,849
and threw some wild parties.

84
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,809
Come, come.

85
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:35,688
How sexy is this stone-finish pool?

86
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:38,357
I can already see
the girls in their bikinis.

87
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:41,402
It'll be fun.
You can invite me to your parties.

88
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:44,697
Look at this state-of-the-art kitchen.

89
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,033
Do we have any chefs in the group?

90
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,827
I'm pretty handy on the grill.

91
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:51,162
Yeah. Right, guys?

92
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:54,123
Yeah,
if you like your meat charred and dry.

93
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:55,791
Am I right?

94
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:58,461
Take a look at the other room.

95
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:00,212
Fuck you.

96
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:04,633
This is my favorite room in the house.
These are original Babette Fosters.

97
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:06,635
They stopped production
on those in the '80s.

98
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,721
I do love a good sconce.

99
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:12,683
But I don't know.
It definitely has a weird energy.

100
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:14,268
Do you guys feel that?

101
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:20,316
Do you guys get this overwhelming sense
of death and doom, or is that just me?

102
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,610
Yeah, like someone's
gonna jump through the window

103
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:24,945
and start stabbing us in the eyes.

104
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:28,074
I'm gonna be straight with you guys.

105
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,619
There was another band,
and they lived here in the '90s.

106
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:34,830
They thought the sound was incredible.

107
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,208
But they never finished their album.

108
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,253
Creative differences.

109
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:42,505
I don't know.

110
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:46,258
Doesn't really seem like the right fit.

111
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,180
Whoa, do you hear that?

112
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:57,978
That's fucking rad.

113
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:09,657
You hear that?

114
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,877
Okay, so if we put the drums right here,

115
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:23,295
facing this way...

116
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:26,215
We could put the guitar stuff here.

117
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:29,260
And we can do keyboards, like, over there.

118
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:32,013
We put the mixing desk
in the bedroom up there.

119
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:34,682
You know.

120
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:37,852
We'll take it.

121
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:42,523
Well, that is music to my ears, baby.
I'll go draw up the paperwork right now.

122
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:44,483
Yay, I knew you would love it.

123
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,903
Okay, guys, check it out.

124
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:52,575
The sound of this house
is the sound of album 10.

125
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:54,493
No songs yet.

126
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:57,371
But we've got the sound.

127
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:08,090
All right, you know the drill.
All gear in the house.

128
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:10,051
Amps, living room.

129
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:13,012
Snare drum-- Shitty job. --living room.

130
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:13,929
Expensive shit.

131
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:16,640
Guitars by the amp line
in the living room.

132
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:18,517
Just fucking hate this shit.

133
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:30,738
Just like a quarter of an inch that way.

134
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:31,781
Just a little...

135
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,538
Like a hair more. Just like a tiny...

136
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:47,505
No, it's too far. Gotta bring it back.

137
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:54,220
Did you hear that?

138
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:55,638
-I did.
-Sweet, huh?

139
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,765
Whatever, Dave.

140
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,649
Who cares about a creepy death vibe,
drum sounds this good?

141
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,421
All right, here's the deal.

142
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,007
Shill's a dick.

143
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,342
We know this, right?

144
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:36,220
But this is our tenth record.
It's gotta be good.

145
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:38,097
But we gotta make it fast.

146
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,392
We gotta eat, sleep,
and drink this motherfucker.

147
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:44,103
So I'm thinking...

148
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,481
we move in to record.

149
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,734
-What?
-No, no, no. Hear me out.

150
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,277
Hear me out. Hear me out.

151
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,320
Two weeks, tops.

152
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:54,864
Maybe a month.

153
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:56,449
A month in this shithole?

154
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:58,576
Then we go on with our normal lives.

155
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:00,578
Tell my wife. I'm not telling her.

156
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:03,039
I'll tell your wife if you tell my wife.

157
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:05,499
I'll tell my wife,
but someone's gotta talk to my kids.

158
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,626
What am I gonna tell my grandma?

159
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,545
Oh, I can call your grandma.

160
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:14,175
She loves me.
You remember the Hanukkah party.

161
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:17,428
Oh, yeah. Come here, Grandma.

162
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,513
Sit down.

163
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:25,895
Come on, Bubbe, just touch it.
Touch it. Yeah, Rami's not gonna know.

164
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:30,107
Stay away from my bubbe.

165
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:34,779
Well, I guess that's settled.

166
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:37,907
I got master bedroom.

167
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,784
-I get the guest house.
-Upstairs bedroom.

168
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:21,534
No.

169
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:23,577
No, no, no.

170
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:24,912
Excuse me.

171
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:27,373
Excuse me.

172
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:29,333
Hello.

173
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:32,420
Hi. Excuse me.

174
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:34,547
Hey, hey, hey.

175
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,590
Yo, excuse me.

176
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,266
That's weird.

177
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:00,406
How we looking, man? We all good?

178
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:01,824
Yeah, we're all good on our end.

179
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:04,035
Just need some juice.
Then we can mic up the room.

180
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:07,038
Goddamn it.

181
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:11,584
Dude, who wired this house,
a bunch of fucking mental patients?

182
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,377
Fuck. Jesus Christ.

183
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:26,932
No, no. Don't touch him. He's still hot.

184
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,650
-Oh, what the fuck?
-Holy shit.

185
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:40,237
He's totally fried.

186
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,411
He's fucking dead.

187
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:50,915
Oh, man.

188
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:55,711
Krug.

189
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:58,089
Krug, Jägermeister. Krug.

190
00:15:58,214 --> 00:15:59,298
Krug.

191
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:07,848
Guess we should pack up.

192
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:10,726
That was a short-lived experiment.

193
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,146
-Get out of here.
-All right, Rami...

194
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:19,860
You know, it's funny.
Hold up, guys. One second. Check it out.

195
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:23,781
Krug was really into this place,
the way the drums sounded.

196
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:27,868
Dave, seriously, the guy just
got turned into a fucking bratwurst.

197
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:32,623
Exactly why we should stay here
and make the record, okay?

198
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:35,084
It'll give his life meaning.

199
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,754
You know? We could dedicate it to Krug.

200
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:41,590
I don't know.

201
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,511
Guess we can do
a couple drum tracks here in his honor.

202
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:48,264
Exactly.
That's what I'm talking about right there.

203
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:51,225
We'll have some fun with it.

204
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:53,269
You know? For Krug.

205
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,193
People think
I look a lot like Willie Nelson.

206
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:05,322
I forgot to tell you.

207
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:07,783
Earlier today, before Krug got zapped,

208
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:10,828
there was this weird dude
in the yard creeping around.

209
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,329
What kind of dude?

210
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:16,542
Some weird guy.
He was trimming the hedges and stuff.

211
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:21,756
-The killer gardener of Encino.
-Wouldn't be surprised in this house.

212
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,342
-Dave.
-Oh, my God.

213
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,760
-What the...?
-Shit.

214
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:27,511
-Dude.
-You all right, Dave?

215
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:31,015
The meat.

216
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,310
It's Krug.

217
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,695
Usually I have a clear idea
of what we're gonna do,

218
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,783
but ever since we moved
into this house, my mind is flooded.

219
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:53,079
It's like sometimes it's like Prince,
and then it's like Slayer.

220
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:55,623
And then it's like fucking Lawrence Welk.

221
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,669
What is it?

222
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:02,755
You guys hear that?

223
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:06,509
Probably raccoons.
I heard them eating the trash last night.

224
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:07,802
Probably that creeper dude.

225
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,554
He better not be filming this.

226
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:55,641
Hey, neighbor.

227
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:00,771
-God.
-You should've seen your face.

228
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:02,481
Or should I say, "feces"?

229
00:19:03,065 --> 00:19:05,484
-It looked like you crapped your pants.
-Yeah.

230
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:07,236
I'm Samantha. I live right next door.

231
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,282
I just wanted to introduce myself,
in case you boys needed anything.

232
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:14,035
A cup of sugar, back-up singer.

233
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:20,374
I got another confession to make

234
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,419
I'm your fool

235
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:27,256
Were you born to resist

236
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,966
Or be abused

237
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:30,343
Help me.

238
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:33,429
Is someone getting the best

239
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:39,643
The best, the best, the best of you?

240
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,649
Oh, thank you.

241
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:49,653
-We'll let you know about that one.
-Okay. I'm around.

242
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:54,241
Let me apologize in advance
for all the rock we're about to make.

243
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:57,828
Oh, I can't hear anything
over my Portuguese singing bowls.

244
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:02,249
Oh, those vibrations
elevate the frequency of the psyche.

245
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,878
Play your cards right,
maybe you will get a sound bath later.

246
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:10,049
Okay, Rami-o. Let's keep it moving.

247
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,426
Bye.

248
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:14,011
Namaste.

249
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:17,598
Hey, is there some sort of gardener dude
that takes care of the property,

250
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:19,392
trimming hedges and stuff?

251
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:21,811
No, Dave. Nobody lives here.

252
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:25,106
This house has been empty for years.

253
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:36,283
Got a couple new riff ideas
I've been working on.

254
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:40,329
I'm gonna lay them on you.
Riff number one. Sounds like this.

255
00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:50,923
So "All My Life"?

256
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:54,010
Shit.

257
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:57,471
Okay, hold on. I got one more.

258
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:06,564
Dude, wait, wait, wait.
That's a great fucking song.

259
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:09,275
It's called "Everlong."
You wrote it 20 years ago.

260
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:13,904
Fuck, the well's run dry.

261
00:21:16,282 --> 00:21:18,117
I've written all my songs already.

262
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:21,287
All I have are these random snippets

263
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,041
of fossilized MTV bullshit in my head.

264
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:26,709
Dude, dude.

265
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:28,169
Look here.

266
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:31,589
Have you ever tried meditating?

267
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:40,348
Fuck meditating in the ass, Rami.

268
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:42,975
I'm gonna step out for a minute, guys.

269
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:45,603
Why don't we give Dave
a little space here?

270
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:00,576
Something will come.

271
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:25,351
Son of a fucking bitch.

272
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:47,707
Been alone with you inside my mind

273
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,923
In my dreams I've kissed your lips
A thousand times

274
00:22:56,674 --> 00:23:02,263
I sometimes see you
Pass outside my door

275
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:04,724
Hello--

276
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:06,642
Hello, Dave.

277
00:23:06,726 --> 00:23:07,893
Lionel.

278
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:10,271
We all have writer's block, you know?

279
00:23:12,732 --> 00:23:15,067
But that's my fucking song.

280
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:18,112
That's my fucking song.
You understand what I'm saying?

281
00:23:18,988 --> 00:23:22,533
I like that song.
No, no, no. I love that song.

282
00:23:22,658 --> 00:23:25,411
That's one of my favorite songs.
I love singing that song.

283
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,413
Love that song.

284
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:32,293
Get your own song, nerd.

285
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:56,567
Taylor, sleep in your own bed.

286
00:23:58,986 --> 00:23:59,820
Taylor?

287
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,577
You...

288
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:08,746
are not...

289
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,248
the first.

290
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,417
Krug. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

291
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:17,171
They are watching.

292
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:20,383
No, Krug.

293
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:45,282
What the fuck?

294
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:52,581
What the fuck?

295
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,667
Oh, my God.

296
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:31,412
Fuck this. I'm starving.

297
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:40,171
I got, like,
three or four chicken parms here.

298
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:18,125
You're Dave Grohl. What?

299
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,130
Yeah, I get that all the time.

300
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:27,843
Right. Yeah. I heard about this.
You're, like, incognito, right?

301
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:30,471
No, see, I'm not Dave Grohl.

302
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:33,182
Dave Grohl can actually write music.

303
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:36,060
I'm seriously a huge fan.

304
00:26:36,143 --> 00:26:38,938
You're my second-favorite band,
after Coldplay.

305
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,529
You know, I asked for extra ranch.

306
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:50,366
Oh, yeah,
and I'll go run back, get some for you.

307
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:52,743
Yeah, it'll only take a few minutes.

308
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:54,704
You know, I'm in a band. Yeah.

309
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,831
I'll run back and get some ranch,

310
00:26:56,914 --> 00:27:00,167
and drop it off with my demo,
if that's cool.

311
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,294
I'll just use the marinara.

312
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:07,967
Hey, what's up?
This is Bob from PlayThisRiff.com.

313
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:12,471
And you've come here today
because you have songwriting constipation.

314
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:15,391
So when I have songwriting constipation,

315
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:18,310
and I want a violent,
greasy dose of the hits,

316
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:21,522
I turn to classic riff structure.
Like this. Check it out.

317
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:22,398
Part A.

318
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:24,817
Part B.

319
00:27:26,694 --> 00:27:27,820
Part A again.

320
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:30,072
Part C.

321
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:39,248
Am I the only one
who cares about the drought around here?

322
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:46,185
What the fuck?

323
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:53,651
Who kills a fucking raccoon?

324
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:07,373
Oh, my God.

325
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,751
He's real.

326
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,385
Dave.

327
00:32:26,702 --> 00:32:28,496
"Dream Widow." No way.

328
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:11,872
This is fucking incredible.

329
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:18,587
Fuck, yeah.

330
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,162
This is the sound, man.
This is the fucking sound.

331
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:53,039
Yes.

332
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:54,457
Fuck, yes.

333
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,792
Fuck.

334
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:58,294
It's fucking incredible.

335
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,886
No, no, no.

336
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:08,429
No, no, no. Don't stop.

337
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,805
There's gotta be more.

338
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:14,435
Fuck, there's gotta be more. Please, God.

339
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,689
Please, please, please. No.

340
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:20,733
No.

341
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:22,485
Fuck.

342
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:24,362
No.

343
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,239
Shit. Goddamn it.

344
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:30,576
God, it was perfect.

345
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,186
You pitiful, miserable, disposable...

346
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,373
Finish it, and it begins.

347
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,503
Finish it, and it begins.

348
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:31,053
Fuck.

349
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,140
Finish it.

350
00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:08,090
What are you doing?

351
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:10,676
There's a dead raccoon in there.

352
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:20,061
Dick.

353
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:25,167
Wow, fuck.

354
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:26,961
-Awesome, man.
-Yeah, man.

355
00:37:28,671 --> 00:37:31,507
Fuck,
it's like you were musically constipated

356
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,385
and you just took
the biggest musical shit on us.

357
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:37,388
-Fucking awesome.
-Right? I'm still working on it.

358
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:40,725
There's like a hundred ideas in my head,
just fighting to get out.

359
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,018
Could be a double,

360
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:43,853
maybe a triple album.

361
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:45,771
-I don't know.
-Let's get to work.

362
00:37:45,855 --> 00:37:48,107
Fuck you, Nate. Don't tell me what to do.

363
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:50,401
Told you it'd come, man.

364
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:55,948
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

365
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,207
What key is this in?

366
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,297
L-sharp.

367
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,382
You found a new musical note?

368
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:15,301
Hell motherfucking yes, I did.

369
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:19,847
Came to me last night.
Just dropped in my head, like boom.

370
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:22,141
You're welcome, music.

371
00:38:22,224 --> 00:38:23,601
So the L-sharp,

372
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:26,562
that's basically an E-flat,
but like an octave up?

373
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:28,689
It's not an E.

374
00:38:28,814 --> 00:38:30,316
It's an L.

375
00:38:35,654 --> 00:38:38,866
If you guys could just
open up your hearts and minds,

376
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,785
maybe you'd be able to hear it.

377
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:45,706
So, what happened to H, I, J, K?

378
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:51,003
G, H, I don't give a fuck

379
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:55,466
It's L-sharp, okay, you guys?
That's the root note of the song.

380
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:00,971
Yes, yes. You're getting warmer. Yes.

381
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,556
Pat, you're cold.

382
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,350
Like North Pole, Antarctica.

383
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:05,726
Not even close.

384
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,479
I think I'm feeling something.

385
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,318
Oh, God, who the fuck?

386
00:39:17,196 --> 00:39:18,489
Hello?

387
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:23,953
Any hungry rock stars in there
want some num-nummy treats?

388
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:26,247
Oh, God, I detest that woman.

389
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:31,836
Lemon bar?

390
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:33,254
Go away.

391
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,548
Dude, lighten up. She's hot.

392
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:38,926
-Hello, beautiful. What's up?
-Hey.

393
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,888
Some fresh-baked lemon bars
for my favorite band.

394
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:46,183
It's my grandma's recipe,
but I added my own little twist to it.

395
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,269
Is that cocaine?

396
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:51,981
Not a good time right now,
because we're working on music.

397
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:54,775
How you feeling?

398
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:56,569
Everything okay?

399
00:39:57,445 --> 00:39:58,529
Never better.

400
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:03,701
I'll get rid of her.

401
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:05,411
Get her the fuck out of here.

402
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:09,999
Hey, sorry, he gets really intense
when we're recording.

403
00:40:10,082 --> 00:40:11,751
I need to talk to you, alone.

404
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,711
I'd like to get you alone too--

405
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:17,465
No, it's about this house.
There's something evil...

406
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:21,010
I should go.

407
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,095
Dave seems stressed.

408
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,474
Hey, how about that sound bath later?

409
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:32,563
-What the fuck, cock-blocker?
-Fuck you, Rami.

410
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,338
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

411
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:03,511
Taylor, take it from the... part.

412
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,304
There's 8000 "boom-paps."

413
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:06,806
-Which one?
-You know which one.

414
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:09,725
-We're at 23 minutes and counting.
-So what?

415
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:13,312
So maybe we have a song that has no end.

416
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:15,940
So we're not close.

417
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:19,110
To me it just feels like
there's something missing.

418
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:24,323
Let's just run through what we've got.
I'm sure you'll get it.

419
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:27,576
Thanks, Chris, you fucking asshole.

420
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:29,912
Go.

421
00:41:31,747 --> 00:41:33,582
One, two, three, four.

422
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,205
-Nate.
-What?

423
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:16,000
I got an idea, okay?
Downstairs. Now. Let's go.

424
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,501
-Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
-Fuck, yeah.

425
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:18,419
Taylor.

426
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,462
Yo, what up, D?

427
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:21,380
I got an idea. Come downstairs.

428
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:24,508
Oh, fuck.

429
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,519
-Are those mine?
-Oh, yeah. I borrowed them.

430
00:42:37,563 --> 00:42:38,939
Have you seen Pat?

431
00:42:39,065 --> 00:42:39,857
No idea.

432
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,777
Hey, Pat.

433
00:42:44,653 --> 00:42:45,821
In here.

434
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:54,038
What are you doing in here?

435
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:59,919
This is the most comfortable place
I could find.

436
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:01,629
And there's snacks.

437
00:43:09,345 --> 00:43:10,346
Voilà.

438
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,306
You made this?

439
00:43:12,431 --> 00:43:15,768
Yeah. It's the only thing
that'll get this song out of my head.

440
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:18,020
And that's the song?

441
00:43:18,104 --> 00:43:19,146
Exactly.

442
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,275
So each one
of these little nails is one of us.

443
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,446
The yarn represents
the vibrations of sound

444
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,573
that our music makes,

445
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:32,493
connecting all of us in an unending form.

446
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:36,122
It's like the universe.
There's no beginning, there's no end.

447
00:43:37,707 --> 00:43:39,917
Great, Dave.
Can we pick this up in the morning?

448
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:41,293
I had these new ideas.

449
00:43:41,377 --> 00:43:44,088
I was hoping we'd put them down tonight,
so I don't forget them.

450
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,133
No, man, I gotta go to sleep.

451
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:48,217
I'm tired.

452
00:43:51,053 --> 00:43:52,013
What did you just say?

453
00:43:52,555 --> 00:43:55,641
Come on, I don't even have a bedroom.

454
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:58,144
I never get any sleep.

455
00:43:58,978 --> 00:44:00,438
Let's do this tomorrow.

456
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:01,814
Before that.

457
00:44:01,897 --> 00:44:02,732
Small word.

458
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:05,818
Begins with an N, ends with an O.

459
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,278
Nothing in between.

460
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,284
"No."

461
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:15,453
I said, no.

462
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,623
No?

463
00:44:22,585 --> 00:44:26,589
Did you just say no to Dave Grohl?

464
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:37,183
I'm a fucking rock star.

465
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:40,102
Okay? I get whatever I want,
whenever I want.

466
00:44:40,186 --> 00:44:43,272
The best parking
wherever I go for eternity.

467
00:44:43,356 --> 00:44:44,899
Them's the rules.

468
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:49,278
Come on, come on.

469
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:52,656
Talk to Jimmy Page if you don't like it.

470
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,409
Dude, what the fuck?

471
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:59,622
I'll do it
if you stop being such a fucking dick.

472
00:44:59,705 --> 00:45:02,083
Thank you. Can we just do this, please?

473
00:45:05,086 --> 00:45:06,170
One, two, three--

474
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:07,588
No, no. Hey, hey, hey.

475
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:12,051
Is there any way you could
count it like, "Five, six, seven, eight"?

476
00:45:12,134 --> 00:45:16,555
Like a fucking dancer counting in a dance?

477
00:45:19,475 --> 00:45:20,768
That's fine. Cool.

478
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,229
Five, six, seven, eight.

479
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:26,273
Dude has gone fucking crazy.

480
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:31,487
Like, ass-flapping, dick-slapping,
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest crazy.

481
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,448
Listen, come on, guys,
let's just buckle down,

482
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,202
give him what he wants,
and we can get the fuck out of here.

483
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:39,286
What does he want?

484
00:45:39,412 --> 00:45:40,204
Hey, guys.

485
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:41,956
-Ix-nay on the Ave-day.
-Shit.

486
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,374
-Hey.
-What's up, bro?

487
00:45:43,457 --> 00:45:45,042
-Hey.
-What's happening?

488
00:45:45,126 --> 00:45:46,585
-What's up?
-Hey.

489
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,879
I just wanted to say...

490
00:45:50,006 --> 00:45:50,798
I'm sorry.

491
00:45:51,924 --> 00:45:54,301
I'm sorry for being such a giant, red,

492
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:56,804
puckered orangutan's asshole last night.

493
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,433
This album means the world to me, okay?

494
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:02,852
And I think I just let it take over.

495
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:05,187
And I treated you like shit,

496
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:07,023
and I'm really sorry.

497
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:11,527
Which one of you gave Dave a hummer?

498
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,862
Rami.

499
00:46:13,654 --> 00:46:14,655
Rami.

500
00:46:16,032 --> 00:46:18,075
Listen, we're so close, okay?

501
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,413
If we could just finish this song tonight,
we'll be out by Sunday.

502
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:23,330
Promise.

503
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:26,500
Stick with me. We can do this.

504
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:30,212
-Song is pretty epic.
-Right?

505
00:46:30,296 --> 00:46:32,048
I do think it should have an ending.

506
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:33,007
Thank God.

507
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,133
Okay.

508
00:46:34,675 --> 00:46:37,136
So I have this idea, right?

509
00:46:37,887 --> 00:46:39,096
Starts with Nate.

510
00:46:39,638 --> 00:46:40,723
The root,

511
00:46:40,806 --> 00:46:41,974
the foundation,

512
00:46:42,058 --> 00:46:42,850
the bass.

513
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:44,477
Nate goes:

514
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:53,652
Chris, Rami, you come in like warships,
banging off each other.

515
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,283
Then, Rami, you're all:

516
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:07,917
Pat, Taylor, you come in
like riders of the Apocalypse:

517
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,520
Like that.

518
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:29,772
-Know what I'm saying?
-Okay.

519
00:47:29,855 --> 00:47:31,023
We got this.

520
00:47:31,107 --> 00:47:31,899
-Right?
-Cool.

521
00:47:32,024 --> 00:47:32,900
-Yeah.
-We can do that.

522
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:34,276
Pearl Jam high five.

523
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,863
Pearl Jam high five.

524
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,156
Break. We're still alive.

525
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,700
-Let's go.
-Come on, let's go.

526
00:50:06,262 --> 00:50:08,055
You sure you want us to leave?

527
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,724
I think we're all good.

528
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:12,143
Well, if you track anything this weekend,

529
00:50:12,268 --> 00:50:15,479
just pop it onto a drive
and we'll mix it on Monday.

530
00:50:16,564 --> 00:50:17,982
Let's get out of here.

531
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,937
How's it going, bro? How's it sounding?

532
00:50:58,105 --> 00:51:00,900
It's good.
I'm just cleaning up some tracks.

533
00:51:00,983 --> 00:51:02,902
Cool.
I haven't seen you eat anything all day.

534
00:51:02,985 --> 00:51:05,571
You hungry?
How about some grill action, dude?

535
00:51:07,406 --> 00:51:08,240
No.

536
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:11,869
I ordered a shit-ton of steaks earlier.
Guy should be here any minute.

537
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:14,538
Cool, man.
I'll let you know when he's here.

538
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:36,227
All right.

539
00:51:42,525 --> 00:51:45,236
Oh, Dave, I forgot you were staying here.

540
00:51:46,112 --> 00:51:47,738
Well, here's your food.

541
00:51:47,822 --> 00:51:51,367
And, yeah,
I brought you that CD I was talking about.

542
00:51:52,618 --> 00:51:54,078
He's not gonna buy that.

543
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:55,705
Come on.

544
00:51:57,623 --> 00:51:59,291
You are a worthy and talented musician.

545
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:02,545
You are a worthy and talented musician.

546
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,530
Hey, Dave. Brought you a bunch
of extra ranch this time, yeah.

547
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:33,117
Oh, this?
It's my demo that I told you about. Yeah.

548
00:52:39,999 --> 00:52:41,083
Dave?

549
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,466
Hello?

550
00:52:49,091 --> 00:52:49,884
Dave?

551
00:52:53,095 --> 00:52:54,722
Hey, sorry it took so long.

552
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:57,183
I wanted
to make sure they got your order right.

553
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:00,519
It's all back here. I got...

554
00:53:03,022 --> 00:53:03,856
Dave.

555
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,320
What the hell?

556
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:57,660
Hey, did that delivery guy ever show up?

557
00:53:59,078 --> 00:54:01,288
Yeah, I don't know. I'll take a look.

558
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,796
Looks like
he just dropped the bags and left.

559
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,424
I think I kind of freaked him out.

560
00:54:11,507 --> 00:54:13,592
He wanted to drop a demo on me.

561
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,970
I wasn't really in the mood.

562
00:54:22,143 --> 00:54:24,395
What is it? Think he's still out there?

563
00:54:38,701 --> 00:54:40,911
You can never have enough ranch.

564
00:54:47,543 --> 00:54:48,919
Okay, so, what's left?

565
00:54:50,713 --> 00:54:51,547
So...

566
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:55,426
drum tracks tomorrow.

567
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,389
Then we just gotta figure out
how to end this thing.

568
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:03,601
We're not actually making
a 38-minute-long song, right?

569
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:04,977
No.

570
00:55:05,061 --> 00:55:06,187
-Okay, cool.
-Of course not.

571
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,439
-Thank God.
-It's gonna be fucking longer than that.

572
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,149
-What?
-What?

573
00:55:10,232 --> 00:55:11,609
Gonna be epic, man.

574
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:16,322
It's gonna be like 2112 times 2112.

575
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:28,125
What?

576
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:31,379
Why don't you let me
take the grill tomorrow night?

577
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:34,340
Seems like you got a lot on your mind.

578
00:55:36,008 --> 00:55:36,801
Okay.

579
00:55:38,094 --> 00:55:39,720
Should leave mine raw, dude.

580
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:43,891
It's so fucking juicy.

581
00:55:49,397 --> 00:55:51,524
Hey, guys, it's Barb.

582
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:55,861
I'm just checking in
to see how everything is going.

583
00:55:56,737 --> 00:55:59,323
Oh, my God. They are barbarians.

584
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,668
Oh, my goodness, it's on the ceiling.

585
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,628
Okay, how do they even do that?

586
00:56:24,724 --> 00:56:26,392
Oh, my God.

587
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:30,104
What did you do?

588
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:34,942
Hey, Barb.

589
00:56:35,026 --> 00:56:36,569
Pat.

590
00:56:36,652 --> 00:56:38,320
I thought you were dead.

591
00:56:42,324 --> 00:56:43,784
How is everything going?

592
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:47,204
Is Dave done with his big concept album?

593
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:49,790
-He told you about that?
-Oh, yeah.

594
00:56:49,915 --> 00:56:52,626
I guess he's been talking to Shill.
They seem pretty excited.

595
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,462
Where is everyone?

596
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:56,630
Upstairs, sleeping.

597
00:56:57,757 --> 00:57:00,968
I usually sleep here,
but not with all this crap on it.

598
00:57:02,178 --> 00:57:03,512
Lemon bar?

599
00:57:03,596 --> 00:57:05,931
No, thank you.
I don't eat sugar or gluten.

600
00:57:06,015 --> 00:57:08,476
Or any citrus fruits, or dairy, or corn.

601
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,227
It's terrible for your gut.

602
00:57:12,188 --> 00:57:15,066
They look homemade.
Is there a baker in the band?

603
00:57:16,442 --> 00:57:17,860
Lady next door.

604
00:57:18,819 --> 00:57:20,112
Samantha?

605
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:22,698
That woman is a train wreck.
I've known her for years.

606
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:28,287
"Sacrifice"?

607
00:57:29,538 --> 00:57:30,539
What did you say?

608
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:33,501
I did-- Me--

609
00:57:34,877 --> 00:57:36,337
I don't know. Nothing.

610
00:57:40,383 --> 00:57:41,509
Hey, Barb.

611
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:43,219
What's up? You made it.

612
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:45,596
David, how goes it?
Is the album almost done?

613
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,556
Yeah, it's so good.

614
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,558
Yeah, it's killer.

615
00:57:49,642 --> 00:57:51,811
We're actually wrapping up tonight.

616
00:57:51,894 --> 00:57:54,730
Great,
so I should make arrangements accordingly.

617
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:56,107
I'm gonna go freshen up.

618
00:57:58,109 --> 00:57:59,735
Interesting guy.

619
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:01,946
He's the best.

620
00:58:32,768 --> 00:58:33,728
All right, wait.

621
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,396
Stop, stop, stop. Hold on.

622
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:38,232
Something's not right.

623
00:58:40,443 --> 00:58:43,904
It's the ending.
You know, there has to be more.

624
00:58:46,115 --> 00:58:47,074
You know,

625
00:58:47,158 --> 00:58:49,035
if we just stopped recording,

626
00:58:49,785 --> 00:58:51,287
it would be over.

627
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:54,790
Yup, a tight 44 fucking minutes.

628
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:57,918
Yeah, dude,
how about a nice slow fade, '70s style?

629
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:00,421
Because I have blisters
on my fucking blisters.

630
00:59:00,504 --> 00:59:02,340
My hands are killing me, dude.

631
00:59:02,423 --> 00:59:05,926
We've been looking
for this mythical fucking ending all day.

632
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,305
You know what? I'm fucking out of here.

633
00:59:14,143 --> 00:59:16,312
Frigging dick sandwich.

634
00:59:16,395 --> 00:59:18,064
Fuck you, Shifty.

635
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,907
What the fuck? Forty-minute fucking song.

636
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:31,494
"Look at me.
I'm Dave Grohl, the big fucking genius.

637
00:59:31,577 --> 00:59:33,829
I don't have any fucking rules.

638
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:36,457
I write songs with no fucking endings.

639
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,459
Forty minutes long."

640
00:59:40,503 --> 00:59:43,839
Fucking can't even
cook a piece of meat to save his life.

641
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:57,853
Hey, Shifty, need a beer or anything?

642
00:59:57,937 --> 01:00:00,564
Yeah, to shove up Dave's fucking ass.

643
01:00:58,748 --> 01:00:59,707
Fucking blisters.

644
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,127
I should start wearing
those stupid fucking gloves.

645
01:01:03,252 --> 01:01:04,670
Fuck this. I'm out of here.

646
01:01:05,546 --> 01:01:08,174
Just hang out.
Chris just had to blow off some steam.

647
01:01:08,257 --> 01:01:11,093
We should get Dave
one of those magnet bracelets.

648
01:01:11,177 --> 01:01:13,012
His energy's way off.

649
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,814
What the fuck is that?

650
01:01:23,898 --> 01:01:25,191
No, no, no.

651
01:01:25,274 --> 01:01:27,902
See? Fucking horrific, isn't it?

652
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:30,404
Who the fuck is that?
Where the fuck is his head?

653
01:01:30,488 --> 01:01:33,115
It's the delivery guy.
Look at all this ranch.

654
01:01:38,245 --> 01:01:39,121
Holy shit.

655
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:42,249
Holy shit.

656
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:45,836
That's the guy
that delivered all the food earlier.

657
01:01:50,633 --> 01:01:53,761
-Don't touch that. No, no, no.
-Dave, Dave, don't...

658
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:00,601
"Bone Structure."

659
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:03,646
He wanted me to hear this.

660
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:06,982
How long has this guy been here?

661
01:02:12,113 --> 01:02:14,615
I'm picking up some energy beacons.

662
01:02:15,991 --> 01:02:18,869
He transitioned around 28 hours ago.

663
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,249
-Where the fuck did you learn that?
-Pasadena.

664
01:02:23,332 --> 01:02:25,459
First Krug gets electrocuted,
and now this?

665
01:02:25,543 --> 01:02:28,004
Fuck this shit. I'm calling the cops.

666
01:02:28,087 --> 01:02:29,839
No, no, no. No cops.

667
01:02:29,922 --> 01:02:30,923
Fuck this shit.

668
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:32,091
No fucking cops.

669
01:02:34,135 --> 01:02:35,136
What the fuck?

670
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:39,974
Maybe Dave's right. We should call Shill.
If this gets out, it'll be bad.

671
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:43,352
Listen, no cops, no Shill.

672
01:02:43,436 --> 01:02:45,896
We cannot afford that intrusion right now.

673
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:48,941
Guy looks like a fucking salami sandwich.
What the fuck?

674
01:02:49,025 --> 01:02:49,859
I understand.

675
01:02:50,568 --> 01:02:51,736
This is bad.

676
01:02:51,819 --> 01:02:53,404
And this is sad.

677
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:57,241
But if we call the cops,
they'll turn this place into a crime scene

678
01:02:57,324 --> 01:03:00,828
and you can kiss
that awesome drum sound goodbye forever.

679
01:03:01,996 --> 01:03:03,914
So we just keep on going?

680
01:03:03,998 --> 01:03:06,751
Yes, one more day.
We finish this thing out.

681
01:03:06,834 --> 01:03:09,086
Okay, and then we can call everybody.

682
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:12,631
We can call the FBI, CSI, NCIS.

683
01:03:12,715 --> 01:03:13,966
We'll call them all.

684
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,343
And then we'll give...

685
01:03:16,218 --> 01:03:20,264
Darren Sandelbaum,
from Bone Structure, a proper burial.

686
01:03:20,348 --> 01:03:22,308
Caskets, flowers, the whole nine.

687
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:27,188
We could even tweet a link
to the Bone Structure on our Insta-thing.

688
01:03:27,855 --> 01:03:29,106
You know what I mean?

689
01:03:30,733 --> 01:03:32,818
This is what Darren would've wanted.

690
01:03:32,902 --> 01:03:35,571
He might've wanted
to keep his fucking head.

691
01:03:35,654 --> 01:03:37,865
He didn't want to fuck up our record.

692
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:39,992
He loved this band.

693
01:03:40,117 --> 01:03:42,119
He died for our band.

694
01:03:42,995 --> 01:03:45,581
Let's do this, you guys, okay?

695
01:03:45,664 --> 01:03:47,917
Do it for Darren Sandelbaum.

696
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:50,753
You guys in?

697
01:03:50,836 --> 01:03:52,046
No.

698
01:03:53,422 --> 01:03:54,548
You in?

699
01:03:55,508 --> 01:03:56,884
-No.
-Are you guys in?

700
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:01,055
Come on, let's get to work.

701
01:04:05,393 --> 01:04:09,772
By the way, I'm gonna need everybody's
cell phones and the keys to the van.

702
01:04:09,897 --> 01:04:12,316
No one's going anywhere
until we finish this song.

703
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:18,989
Thank you.

704
01:04:20,616 --> 01:04:21,826
-Thank you.
-The keys.

705
01:04:21,909 --> 01:04:22,910
Thank you.

706
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:23,911
Thank you.

707
01:04:24,745 --> 01:04:26,831
-I don't have a phone anymore.
-Thank you.

708
01:05:00,531 --> 01:05:02,491
It all comes back to the L-sharp.

709
01:05:02,575 --> 01:05:03,451
Got it?

710
01:05:04,618 --> 01:05:06,746
Yeah, we got it. Totally got it.

711
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:10,041
Let's just track the song
so we can go home.

712
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:12,209
I'm tired. Kids think I'm dead.

713
01:05:13,002 --> 01:05:14,795
And where's Shifty?

714
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:16,255
He should be here.

715
01:05:16,339 --> 01:05:17,882
He was out by the grill.

716
01:05:18,424 --> 01:05:19,467
He's gone.

717
01:05:20,509 --> 01:05:23,554
Okay, let's just do this one more time.
Count us in.

718
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,765
Five, six, seven, eight--

719
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:27,683
Actually, no. You know what? This time...

720
01:05:28,893 --> 01:05:30,853
Odd numbers only in this section.

721
01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:34,148
One, three, five, seven. Hit it.

722
01:05:37,276 --> 01:05:38,402
Okay.

723
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:41,739
One, three, five, seven.

724
01:06:09,642 --> 01:06:11,352
He's still eating. Let's go.

725
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:16,899
He came out of here.

726
01:06:18,067 --> 01:06:20,695
-I was back here eating chips.
-Big surprise.

727
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:22,363
Then I found this.

728
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:25,658
The neighbor lady
that left the lemon bars left this.

729
01:06:27,952 --> 01:06:30,413
It's a code. She's been trying to warn us.

730
01:06:30,496 --> 01:06:33,708
-You just want to bang her.
-Yes, I want to bang her.

731
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:36,293
But I also want to not get decapitated.

732
01:06:36,794 --> 01:06:39,839
Let's ask her.
She's always by the fence. Let's go.

733
01:06:42,591 --> 01:06:43,592
That's you?

734
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:47,471
I thought
we had an infestation of yellow warblers.

735
01:06:47,555 --> 01:06:49,306
That was the wood thrush, genius.

736
01:06:49,432 --> 01:06:53,060
Not here, little thrush.
Come to the pool. We don't have much time.

737
01:06:58,649 --> 01:06:59,692
Guys, hey.

738
01:07:01,402 --> 01:07:02,361
Come here.

739
01:07:02,445 --> 01:07:03,279
Now.

740
01:07:03,362 --> 01:07:05,531
-How'd you get over there so fast?
-Now.

741
01:07:06,907 --> 01:07:11,078
I need you boys
to open your minds for a moment,

742
01:07:11,162 --> 01:07:12,371
and fucking listen.

743
01:07:13,456 --> 01:07:14,582
This house...

744
01:07:15,124 --> 01:07:18,961
This is
not just a creepy rock 'n' roll house.

745
01:07:19,587 --> 01:07:22,048
We are standing on a nexus

746
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:25,926
that allows spiritual entities
to cross into our world.

747
01:07:27,011 --> 01:07:28,220
Can it, drummer boy.

748
01:07:28,888 --> 01:07:30,306
You ever hear of Dream Widow?

749
01:07:30,389 --> 01:07:33,976
Of course. They were supposed
to be the next Jane's Addiction.

750
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,103
Greg Null was a fucking genius.

751
01:07:36,187 --> 01:07:40,733
Yeah, till he went batshit crazy,
and killed his whole fucking band.

752
01:07:40,816 --> 01:07:43,652
Right here in this house.

753
01:07:46,322 --> 01:07:48,407
That's just rock 'n' roll folklore.

754
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:49,617
I was there.

755
01:07:50,242 --> 01:07:51,911
Greg Null and I were close.

756
01:07:52,495 --> 01:07:53,621
Very close.

757
01:07:53,704 --> 01:07:56,916
I was his number one groupie and muse.

758
01:07:56,999 --> 01:07:59,210
Now we're taking advice from groupies?

759
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:02,004
Hey, watch the labels.
Groupies are people too.

760
01:08:03,214 --> 01:08:05,466
You gotta understand,
this was the roaring '90s.

761
01:08:05,591 --> 01:08:07,343
No one gave a fuck about shit.

762
01:08:07,426 --> 01:08:08,469
But Greg...

763
01:08:09,095 --> 01:08:13,182
He was a visionary, an artist of the dark.

764
01:08:13,265 --> 01:08:16,477
We were all into
some experimental life choices back then.

765
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:21,399
The occult sex,
energy transfers, and spectrophilia.

766
01:08:21,482 --> 01:08:24,860
He possessed this living book,

767
01:08:24,944 --> 01:08:27,154
made from human flesh.

768
01:08:28,698 --> 01:08:32,576
The book was rumored
to hold the secret incantations

769
01:08:32,702 --> 01:08:34,870
of Aleister Crowley.

770
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:40,376
As time went on,

771
01:08:40,459 --> 01:08:43,963
something truly sinister
took ahold of Greg.

772
01:08:44,046 --> 01:08:47,425
He was obsessed
with this song from the book...

773
01:08:48,175 --> 01:08:50,469
"Lacrimis de Ebrius."

774
01:08:51,178 --> 01:08:53,264
"The Tears of God."

775
01:08:53,347 --> 01:08:57,435
Every day he made his band
try to complete this song.

776
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:03,149
He believed that
perfecting it would open an eternal portal

777
01:09:03,858 --> 01:09:08,904
and the spirit inside him
would become a demonic passage

778
01:09:08,988 --> 01:09:10,448
into our world.

779
01:09:15,453 --> 01:09:16,954
You guys were ghost fuckers?

780
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:22,084
Somehow the good won out in Greg,

781
01:09:22,168 --> 01:09:23,377
and he stopped it,

782
01:09:24,253 --> 01:09:26,380
the only way he could.

783
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:32,511
Greg killed himself
to stop the completion of the song.

784
01:09:33,888 --> 01:09:40,019
But now the spirit that possessed him
has found a new instrument.

785
01:09:45,149 --> 01:09:47,902
-Fuck. Go, go, go. Faster.
-You guys...

786
01:09:47,985 --> 01:09:50,071
Shut up. Go. Hurry.

787
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:53,407
Go, go. Shit, shit, shit.

788
01:09:53,491 --> 01:09:54,950
Oh, shit.

789
01:09:55,076 --> 01:09:57,370
-Fucker.
-Fucking dolls.

790
01:09:57,453 --> 01:09:59,538
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

791
01:09:59,622 --> 01:10:03,501
Goddamn it, I haven't spent the last
20 years teaching Pilates in Encino

792
01:10:03,584 --> 01:10:05,127
so that thing can have its way.

793
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:06,712
You moved next door on purpose?

794
01:10:06,796 --> 01:10:08,172
Someone had to guard the portal.

795
01:10:08,255 --> 01:10:11,467
He's already been possessed.
What are we gonna do now?

796
01:10:13,302 --> 01:10:15,179
Okay, bring him down here.

797
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:18,224
Maybe I can
just suck it out the old-fashioned way.

798
01:10:18,307 --> 01:10:19,558
Hell, no. Bad idea.

799
01:10:19,642 --> 01:10:21,143
Oh, sorry. Old habits.

800
01:10:21,227 --> 01:10:23,104
There's got to be a better way.

801
01:10:24,605 --> 01:10:25,690
Just call the cops.

802
01:10:25,773 --> 01:10:27,692
God, that's such a good idea.

803
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:31,779
"Hi. Dave Grohl's been possessed
by the spirit of Greg Null.

804
01:10:32,321 --> 01:10:34,490
Now he's on a murderous rampage."

805
01:10:34,573 --> 01:10:37,827
Best idea I've heard since,
"Hey, let's move into this house."

806
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:40,371
-Okay. What the fuck should we do?
-Come on.

807
01:10:42,331 --> 01:10:43,165
The book.

808
01:10:43,874 --> 01:10:45,626
It uses blood to stay alive.

809
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,129
He uses raccoons.

810
01:10:48,713 --> 01:10:49,672
The basement.

811
01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:52,550
He said something about raccoons
when he came up from the basement.

812
01:10:52,633 --> 01:10:53,426
Okay.

813
01:10:53,968 --> 01:10:54,927
Find the book.

814
01:10:55,511 --> 01:10:58,639
Turn to a passage called
"Van Houten's Protocol."

815
01:10:58,723 --> 01:11:02,685
That will close the portal
and send this fucking spirit back to hell.

816
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,311
What about you?

817
01:11:04,395 --> 01:11:07,356
You're gonna be in danger
now that you've told us all this.

818
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,695
You wanna stay back
and make sure I'm safe?

819
01:11:13,696 --> 01:11:15,031
She's right.

820
01:11:15,114 --> 01:11:17,450
Nate, Pat, you guys go find the book.

821
01:11:17,575 --> 01:11:19,785
Taylor, go keep Dave occupied.

822
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:21,162
Drum tracks.

823
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:23,164
You haven't done your drum track yet.

824
01:11:23,247 --> 01:11:25,875
I ain't going near that psycho. Fuck that.

825
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:28,753
Go up there and fuck up the drums,
so he can't finish the song.

826
01:11:28,878 --> 01:11:30,421
Shouldn't be too hard for you.

827
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:33,466
Eat a bag of dicks, Smear.

828
01:11:33,549 --> 01:11:34,425
Be careful.

829
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:37,386
This is far from a simple possession.

830
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:40,723
That caretaker
is more than just Greg Null.

831
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:44,101
There is an evil spirit inside him.

832
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:50,524
-Let's go.
-No, I said, I'm not doing it.

833
01:11:50,608 --> 01:11:53,444
-I'm not going near that motherfucker.
-Come on.

834
01:11:53,569 --> 01:11:54,862
-Fuck you.
-Come on.

835
01:11:54,987 --> 01:11:56,947
Fuck you, motherfuckers.

836
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,301
Yes.

837
01:12:18,928 --> 01:12:21,722
-He took the fucking SIM card.
-Quick, Pat.

838
01:12:29,355 --> 01:12:32,149
-I'll keep you so fucking safe.
-I bet you will.

839
01:12:34,652 --> 01:12:36,320
Take this off. Take this off.

840
01:12:37,488 --> 01:12:38,489
Can't get it off.

841
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:46,580
Wait, wait.
Put some music on so Dave doesn't hear us.

842
01:12:47,331 --> 01:12:48,374
Good idea.

843
01:13:05,516 --> 01:13:06,809
Okay, let's go.

844
01:13:07,393 --> 01:13:10,229
Maybe I should wait up here, be a lookout?

845
01:13:10,312 --> 01:13:11,230
No fucking way, dude.

846
01:13:11,313 --> 01:13:12,148
Come on.

847
01:13:22,533 --> 01:13:24,368
I'm a lumberjack baby

848
01:13:25,995 --> 01:13:29,123
And I'm gonna cut you down to size

849
01:13:29,206 --> 01:13:31,375
My latest guilty pleasure.

850
01:13:33,336 --> 01:13:34,920
This is my shit.

851
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:47,933
And when you hear my motor running

852
01:13:48,976 --> 01:13:52,980
You know I surely
I surely be coppin' a rise

853
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:56,650
So I'm gonna crank it up
And cut it down

854
01:13:58,694 --> 01:14:01,655
This is my favorite part.
This is my favorite part.

855
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,949
You're nasty. I like that.

856
01:14:23,135 --> 01:14:26,389
I ain't jacked my lumber baby

857
01:14:44,407 --> 01:14:45,282
Jesus.

858
01:14:45,783 --> 01:14:47,326
Somebody lived down here.

859
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,245
Greg Null.

860
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,622
Or whatever he is now.

861
01:15:10,516 --> 01:15:12,226
Fuck, dude. Look.

862
01:15:16,397 --> 01:15:18,691
"The sacrifice feeds the book."

863
01:15:26,615 --> 01:15:27,867
Poor little guy.

864
01:15:50,848 --> 01:15:53,559
Pat, find me something
to pry this open with.

865
01:17:08,134 --> 01:17:09,677
Oh, fuck!

866
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,303
Come on. Go, go.

867
01:17:25,526 --> 01:17:26,318
Come on.

868
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,502
Hey, buddy. How you doing, man?

869
01:17:45,963 --> 01:17:46,881
The ending.

870
01:17:48,966 --> 01:17:50,009
I can hear it.

871
01:17:52,053 --> 01:17:54,513
All we need to do is lay down the drums.

872
01:17:55,848 --> 01:17:59,185
The drums? Why don't you
and Shifty do some more guitars?

873
01:18:02,813 --> 01:18:04,648
Shifty's done.

874
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:23,167
Warm up.

875
01:18:26,587 --> 01:18:27,588
You're next.

876
01:18:33,636 --> 01:18:37,014
-Fucking hell. Fuck, fuck.
-Were they fucking demons?

877
01:18:37,098 --> 01:18:39,308
Those were real fucking demons, Nate.

878
01:18:39,975 --> 01:18:41,644
Okay, man, look at this.

879
01:18:43,145 --> 01:18:44,313
Demonic incantations.

880
01:18:47,316 --> 01:18:48,818
Here we go, exorcisms.

881
01:19:03,374 --> 01:19:06,627
No, no, no. That's not it. That's not it.

882
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:07,920
You're doing this on purpose.

883
01:19:08,045 --> 01:19:10,172
I'm trying to get this ending right.

884
01:19:10,256 --> 01:19:12,049
Okay, it's fucking simple.

885
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:12,925
It just goes:

886
01:19:15,845 --> 01:19:17,763
I'm pretty sure that's what I was doing.

887
01:19:17,847 --> 01:19:19,598
Pretty sure it's not.

888
01:19:20,307 --> 01:19:22,309
Why don't we wait
for Nate and Pat to get here?

889
01:19:22,393 --> 01:19:23,602
Nate and Pat?

890
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,398
Fuck them.
What do they know about fucking drums?

891
01:19:27,523 --> 01:19:29,775
You and me, right? We're drummers.

892
01:19:29,859 --> 01:19:33,446
We speak the same language.
Let's finish the fucking track.

893
01:19:33,529 --> 01:19:34,905
Can't we just wait?

894
01:19:35,948 --> 01:19:38,784
Let's just finish the fucking track,
and get out of here.

895
01:19:39,368 --> 01:19:41,579
It's not Dave. You're not Dave.

896
01:19:41,662 --> 01:19:42,997
What did you just say?

897
01:19:44,373 --> 01:19:45,583
I didn't say anything.

898
01:19:47,084 --> 01:19:49,795
Just play the fucking drums.

899
01:20:15,946 --> 01:20:18,157
Yeah. That's it.

900
01:20:22,078 --> 01:20:22,912
Yeah.

901
01:20:26,123 --> 01:20:27,416
That's it.

902
01:20:58,989 --> 01:21:01,867
There you go, man.
I finished the fucking song.

903
01:21:03,411 --> 01:21:04,537
You did.

904
01:21:08,332 --> 01:21:09,583
Thank you.

905
01:21:23,639 --> 01:21:25,766
"The Van Houten Protocol
for Demonic Cleansing.

906
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:29,020
It's imperative to confirm
the possessing entity is of demonic origin

907
01:21:29,145 --> 01:21:30,646
before employing these techniques.

908
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:34,066
Look for these signs.
One, digestive system shutdown."

909
01:21:38,988 --> 01:21:41,490
No more oatmeal beer bongs for Davey.

910
01:21:42,616 --> 01:21:44,702
"Ability to levitate objects,
or defy gravity."

911
01:21:44,785 --> 01:21:46,829
Just play nice with this L-sharp bullshit.

912
01:21:46,912 --> 01:21:48,748
Play E-flat and get through it.

913
01:21:48,831 --> 01:21:50,041
It's an L.

914
01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:52,043
L.

915
01:21:53,878 --> 01:21:55,588
"Incessant masturbation."

916
01:21:56,255 --> 01:21:58,591
Dave, what are you doing in there?

917
01:21:58,716 --> 01:22:02,011
Sounds like you're playing patty-cake
with a soft chicken dumpling.

918
01:22:02,094 --> 01:22:04,388
-Didn't he do that already?
-Does that disqualify him?

919
01:22:04,972 --> 01:22:06,891
This demonic shit is complicated.

920
01:22:07,516 --> 01:22:11,520
"Insatiable hunger for raw meat,
human flesh in particular."

921
01:22:11,604 --> 01:22:13,731
Fuck, I think he ate Chris.

922
01:22:13,814 --> 01:22:16,067
Fuck, he's definitely possessed.

923
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,569
Okay. So, what do we do?

924
01:22:19,445 --> 01:22:21,072
We go save his ass.

925
01:22:27,078 --> 01:22:28,079
That's not good.

926
01:22:34,335 --> 01:22:35,336
What's he doing?

927
01:23:00,403 --> 01:23:02,196
-Oh, my God.
-Shit.

928
01:23:02,321 --> 01:23:03,823
I think we're too late.

929
01:23:03,906 --> 01:23:05,533
That's Taylor. Look.

930
01:23:10,913 --> 01:23:13,124
Read the book. We gotta stop this.

931
01:23:18,129 --> 01:23:19,088
Here we go.

932
01:23:19,171 --> 01:23:21,257
-"To begin the Van Houten Protocol--"
-Quiet.

933
01:24:11,307 --> 01:24:12,558
Shit. Fuck.

934
01:24:16,103 --> 01:24:18,272
What the fuck?

935
01:24:19,357 --> 01:24:21,359
Jesus. Jesus. Fuck.

936
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:32,370
Close the door.

937
01:24:33,412 --> 01:24:35,748
Shit. Fuck. Okay.

938
01:24:35,831 --> 01:24:39,919
All right. "The vessel must be purified
to release the infecting spirit.

939
01:24:40,002 --> 01:24:41,921
Copious amounts of Holy Water--"

940
01:24:42,004 --> 01:24:42,880
The pool.

941
01:24:50,846 --> 01:24:53,265
"Under the designations
of these sacred passages,

942
01:24:53,349 --> 01:24:55,559
I anoint this body of water
as a conduit of purity."

943
01:25:04,902 --> 01:25:06,195
That won't work.

944
01:25:06,904 --> 01:25:08,906
You don't know what you're doing.

945
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:34,724
Hurry up and read.

946
01:25:35,725 --> 01:25:37,685
"Heavenly Father, Holy Spirit,

947
01:25:37,768 --> 01:25:40,521

that we may wash Dave clean
from this foul demon."

949
01:25:49,989 --> 01:25:51,073
Something's happening.

950
01:25:53,117 --> 01:25:54,452
Yes.

951
01:25:54,952 --> 01:25:57,705
Your death is being delayed.

952
01:25:58,372 --> 01:26:00,124
The fucking demons.

953
01:26:00,207 --> 01:26:03,919
Give me that fucking book,
or I'll rip it out of your dead hands.

954
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:07,715
"Hear us, Lord,
cleanse the soul of this infernal beast

955
01:26:07,798 --> 01:26:10,926
that hath taken Dave and turned him
into a satanic vessel from hell."

956
01:26:11,052 --> 01:26:13,763
Stop reading that fucking book.

957
01:26:13,846 --> 01:26:16,015
Fuck you. We want Dave back.

958
01:26:16,974 --> 01:26:17,975
Dave?

959
01:26:18,559 --> 01:26:21,103
Dave's been gone for decades.

960
01:26:21,187 --> 01:26:23,689
He's a slave to music.

961
01:26:24,273 --> 01:26:25,775
What about our band?

962
01:26:25,858 --> 01:26:26,859
The band?

963
01:26:28,569 --> 01:26:29,987
What about them?

964
01:26:30,071 --> 01:26:31,739
Rami got what he wanted.

965
01:26:31,864 --> 01:26:33,783
Taylor finished the song.

966
01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:35,493
And Chris...

967
01:26:36,118 --> 01:26:37,244
Chris was right.

968
01:26:37,912 --> 01:26:40,373
He does make a killer barbecue.

969
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:44,752
"Demon of the 12th Realm,
defiler of souls,

970
01:26:44,835 --> 01:26:46,462
sitting at the left hand of Lucifer--"

971
01:26:46,545 --> 01:26:47,922
You're weak.

972
01:26:48,005 --> 01:26:49,340
You're nothing.

973
01:26:49,465 --> 01:26:51,967
I'll crush your pathetic souls.

974
01:26:52,051 --> 01:26:54,011
"I command you,
be gone from this human vessel.

975
01:26:54,095 --> 01:26:55,930
Take leave of this innocent body.

976
01:26:56,013 --> 01:26:58,557
Return to your kingdom
of blasphemy and filth."

977
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:03,938
Come on, demon.

978
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:06,399
Let Dave fucking go.

979
01:27:17,576 --> 01:27:20,287
Do you see him? Where'd he go?

980
01:27:21,747 --> 01:27:22,957
Where is he?

981
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:23,833
I don't know.

982
01:27:32,717 --> 01:27:34,051
Oh, my God.

983
01:27:36,512 --> 01:27:37,471
You guys.

984
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:50,568
Oh, God.

985
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:53,904
Last thing I remember is...

986
01:27:54,739 --> 01:27:56,240
that fucking raccoon, man,

987
01:27:56,365 --> 01:27:57,950
and then poof.

988
01:27:58,576 --> 01:28:01,412
Dude, we got some bad news.

989
01:28:01,579 --> 01:28:04,707
Oh, my God, the song.
We cannot finish the song, okay?

990
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,834
Whatever's in that basement,
we can't let it out.

991
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:08,586
No, it's about the guys.

992
01:28:08,669 --> 01:28:10,504
I think I swallowed some pool water.

993
01:28:13,632 --> 01:28:15,468
I fucking love you guys, man.

994
01:28:16,469 --> 01:28:17,803
I fucking love you.

995
01:28:20,222 --> 01:28:22,475
You totally saved my--

996
01:28:40,034 --> 01:28:41,410
Oh, gross.

997
01:28:41,952 --> 01:28:43,621
Is that Shifty?

998
01:28:52,672 --> 01:28:54,423
That tastes like shit.

999
01:28:55,549 --> 01:28:58,469
-It's all right, buddy. You're okay now.
-Oh, God.

1000
01:29:20,991 --> 01:29:22,034
No.

1001
01:29:24,161 --> 01:29:26,580
No, no.

1002
01:29:38,968 --> 01:29:41,095
Now I'll kill you,

1003
01:29:41,637 --> 01:29:45,099
like the rest
of your pathetic little band.

1004
01:30:09,457 --> 01:30:10,916
Fuck you.

1005
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,126
Fuck you.

1006
01:30:12,209 --> 01:30:14,211
Fuck you.

1007
01:30:14,295 --> 01:30:15,546
Fuck...

1008
01:30:15,671 --> 01:30:16,922
you.

1009
01:30:34,357 --> 01:30:35,566
Killed us.

1010
01:30:36,567 --> 01:30:39,236
Crushed our dreams.

1011
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,781
You were weak.

1012
01:30:42,365 --> 01:30:45,326
Your curse is lifted.

1013
01:30:46,494 --> 01:30:48,120
Now you will suffer.

1014
01:30:48,204 --> 01:30:51,207
Suffer. Suffer. Suffer...

1015
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:22,381
The sacrifice feeds the book.

1016
01:32:27,553 --> 01:32:28,512
Thank you.

1017
01:32:53,412 --> 01:32:55,414
Okay.

1018
01:32:57,958 --> 01:32:59,919
Get me the fuck out of here, man.

1019
01:33:32,451 --> 01:33:34,161
Get the fucking van.

1020
01:33:34,954 --> 01:33:37,373
-We'll go grab the van. Wait here.
-Okay.

1021
01:34:03,691 --> 01:34:04,650
Fuck.

1022
01:34:04,734 --> 01:34:06,569
We gave shitty Dave the keys.

1023
01:34:07,903 --> 01:34:08,904
Just get in.

1024
01:34:10,573 --> 01:34:11,532
What are you doing?

1025
01:34:11,615 --> 01:34:13,784
I'll do it the old-fashioned way.

1026
01:34:21,584 --> 01:34:23,627
Hit the gas when the wire makes contact.

1027
01:34:23,711 --> 01:34:24,712
What?

1028
01:34:24,795 --> 01:34:27,798
You need to hit the gas when I spark it.

1029
01:34:45,566 --> 01:34:46,984
What are you doing here?

1030
01:34:47,902 --> 01:34:49,737
See if there's any others left.

1031
01:34:55,076 --> 01:34:57,286
Oh, my God. Shill, thank God you're here.

1032
01:34:57,370 --> 01:35:00,873
This house is a fucking shit show, man.

1033
01:35:00,956 --> 01:35:02,875
You have no idea
what we just went through.

1034
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,504
The devil rules all of rock 'n' roll.

1035
01:35:06,587 --> 01:35:08,756
What? No, no, no. Listen.

1036
01:35:08,839 --> 01:35:12,218
This place is a disaster, okay?

1037
01:35:12,301 --> 01:35:15,596
It's been a nightmare recording here.
Why did you send us to this house?

1038
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:19,975
Don't give me your sob story, Dave.
I know exactly what's going on.

1039
01:35:20,059 --> 01:35:21,060
You do?

1040
01:35:21,143 --> 01:35:22,353
Oh, yeah.

1041
01:35:22,436 --> 01:35:24,146
You know, rock 'n' roll...

1042
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:27,692
it hasn't been relevant for a long time.

1043
01:35:27,817 --> 01:35:30,403
It needs an infusion.

1044
01:35:31,028 --> 01:35:34,281
Okay, I don't know
what kind of weird shit you're into--

1045
01:35:34,365 --> 01:35:38,953
The devil will make
rock 'n' roll relevant again.

1046
01:35:39,704 --> 01:35:43,207
The devil will make it dangerous.

1047
01:35:45,376 --> 01:35:47,795
You finished the song, didn't you, Dave?

1048
01:35:49,922 --> 01:35:51,132
No, not yet.

1049
01:35:51,799 --> 01:35:52,758
It's complicated.

1050
01:35:52,883 --> 01:35:53,676
We're close.

1051
01:35:53,759 --> 01:35:56,804
It's just the arrangement
and the composition is--

1052
01:35:56,887 --> 01:36:01,475
I've been waiting 20 years
to finish that song.

1053
01:36:01,559 --> 01:36:03,144
I just needed the right vehicle.

1054
01:36:03,269 --> 01:36:06,147
Someone who could handle all that evil.

1055
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:07,064
I needed you.

1056
01:36:09,525 --> 01:36:11,944
First of all, Obi-Wan Kenobi,

1057
01:36:12,028 --> 01:36:13,279
nice fucking cape.

1058
01:36:13,362 --> 01:36:17,241
Second of all, you're so fucking lame.
Who do you think you are?

1059
01:36:17,324 --> 01:36:19,410
Sending us
to this shithole to make a record?

1060
01:36:19,493 --> 01:36:20,619
You're just a manager.

1061
01:36:20,703 --> 01:36:23,372
You don't know
the first thing about music.

1062
01:36:23,456 --> 01:36:25,291
You just wanna make your money.

1063
01:36:29,462 --> 01:36:32,089
I made you.

1064
01:36:44,602 --> 01:36:46,937
Pat, there's something back there.
Come on.

1065
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,397
Oh, shit.

1066
01:37:02,078 --> 01:37:03,829
Pat, move, move, move.

1067
01:37:03,913 --> 01:37:05,956
What do you think I'm doing?
Hold on a minute.

1068
01:37:07,124 --> 01:37:08,584
Oh, mother...

1069
01:37:16,467 --> 01:37:18,761
Dude, time is fucking nigh. Start the car.

1070
01:37:18,844 --> 01:37:20,971
Give me a minute. I almost got it.

1071
01:37:21,639 --> 01:37:23,724
Come on, move. It's getting closer.

1072
01:37:24,225 --> 01:37:26,686
It's almost here.
What are you doing down there?

1073
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:39,532
Shit. Pat, now, now, now.

1074
01:37:39,615 --> 01:37:41,826
Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Hold on.

1075
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:44,203
Hi, guys.

1076
01:37:45,246 --> 01:37:46,664
Stop fighting me, Dave.

1077
01:37:47,415 --> 01:37:48,499
Stop fighting me.

1078
01:37:48,624 --> 01:37:50,292
I'm trying to help you.

1079
01:37:51,419 --> 01:37:52,962
The real you.

1080
01:38:08,269 --> 01:38:09,854
Here it comes. Spark it.

1081
01:38:28,122 --> 01:38:29,165
Oh, fuck.

1082
01:38:29,749 --> 01:38:31,751
Pat. Fuck.

1083
01:38:31,834 --> 01:38:35,129
Pat. Sorry, Pat. I'm sorry.

1084
01:38:53,022 --> 01:38:53,856
Barb?

1085
01:39:25,554 --> 01:39:28,933
Help?
I killed my band because of your help.

1086
01:39:29,016 --> 01:39:30,184
Die, you cocksucker.

1087
01:39:30,267 --> 01:39:31,268
Die.

1088
01:39:34,647 --> 01:39:36,273
You finished it.

1089
01:39:36,357 --> 01:39:39,318
You finished the song, didn't you?

1090
01:39:40,277 --> 01:39:41,612
You finished it.

1091
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,254
You finished it.

1092
01:39:58,337 --> 01:39:59,588
You did.

1093
01:39:59,672 --> 01:40:00,798
Didn't you?

1094
01:40:04,552 --> 01:40:06,470
Look at the rage in your eyes.

1095
01:40:08,514 --> 01:40:10,391
You're not Dave Grohl.

1096
01:40:13,352 --> 01:40:16,564
It's time for your solo career.

1097
01:40:35,833 --> 01:40:39,170
We're ready for you, brother.
That is a full house out there.

1098
01:40:41,255 --> 01:40:42,423
You all good, Dave?

1099
01:40:43,883 --> 01:40:44,967
Never better.

1100
01:40:45,926 --> 01:40:46,927
Okay.

1101
01:41:57,873 --> 01:41:59,750
Love dies young

1102
01:42:00,835 --> 01:42:03,796
And there's no resuscitation

1103
01:42:04,755 --> 01:42:06,590
Once it's done

1104
01:42:08,259 --> 01:42:10,636
No regeneration

1105
01:42:11,887 --> 01:42:15,266
It's a losing game
That'll make you play

1106
01:42:15,349 --> 01:42:18,394
Your hand against your chest

1107
01:42:18,477 --> 01:42:20,146
Love dies young

1108
01:42:25,401 --> 01:42:27,319
Love dies young

1109
01:42:28,404 --> 01:42:31,282
And there's no reanimation

1110
01:42:32,283 --> 01:42:35,661
Once it's gone

1111
01:42:35,745 --> 01:42:38,039
No regeneration

1112
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:42,793
It's a bitter kiss
That'll make you wish

1113
01:42:42,877 --> 01:42:46,005
You never had a taste

1114
01:42:46,088 --> 01:42:52,803
Love dies young, oh

1115
01:42:52,887 --> 01:42:59,643
Love dies young, oh

1116
01:42:59,727 --> 01:43:03,064
Please don't take my breath

1117
01:43:03,147 --> 01:43:08,444
Don't take my breath away

1118
01:43:10,029 --> 01:43:11,989
Love dies young

1119
01:43:16,827 --> 01:43:18,788
Love's so dumb

1120
01:43:19,997 --> 01:43:22,917
So, what's the fascination?

1121
01:43:23,793 --> 01:43:26,712
Leaves you numb

1122
01:43:26,796 --> 01:43:29,590
With a nasty reputation

1123
01:43:30,841 --> 01:43:34,512
When you lose your head
And lights go out

1124
01:43:34,595 --> 01:43:37,348
You'll never be the same

1125
01:43:37,431 --> 01:43:44,313
Love dies young, oh

1126
01:43:44,397 --> 01:43:51,070
Love dies young, oh

1127
01:43:51,153 --> 01:43:54,615
Please don't take my breath

1128
01:43:54,699 --> 01:43:59,870
Don't take my breath away

1129
01:44:01,455 --> 01:44:03,290
Love dies young

1130
01:44:09,005 --> 01:44:12,341
Never-ending cemeteries

1131
01:44:12,425 --> 01:44:15,219
Funeral parades

1132
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:21,225
All your dreams
Are buried in their place

1133
01:44:22,143 --> 01:44:28,774
Love dies young, oh

1134
01:44:28,858 --> 01:44:32,319
Please don't take my breath

1135
01:44:32,403 --> 01:44:37,450
Don't take my breath away

1136
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:41,078
Love dies young

1137
01:44:59,805 --> 01:45:06,645
Love dies young, oh

1138
01:45:06,729 --> 01:45:13,444
Love dies young, oh

1139
01:45:13,569 --> 01:45:16,989
Please don't take my breath

1140
01:45:17,073 --> 01:45:22,328
Don't take my breath away

1141
01:45:25,581 --> 01:45:27,416
Love dies young

1142
01:45:32,421 --> 01:45:34,965
Love dies young

1143
01:45:39,303 --> 01:45:41,305
Love dies young

1144
01:45:46,143 --> 01:45:48,229
Love dies young

1145
01:45:52,942 --> 01:45:56,404
Love dies young

1146
01:45:56,487 --> 01:45:59,782
Love dies young

1147
01:45:59,865 --> 01:46:03,202
Love dies young

1148
01:46:03,285 --> 01:46:06,664
Love dies young

1149
01:46:06,747 --> 01:46:08,708
Love dies young
