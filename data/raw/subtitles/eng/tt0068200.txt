00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,400
FISHMONGER: Lovely fresh fish!

2
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,433
lovely bit
of fresh fish, sir.

3
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:44,433
Nice and fresh.

4
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,167
You'll love it.

5
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:47,300
Here you are, governor.

6
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Lovely fish.

7
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,233
Lovely mackerel, caught
fresh this morning.

8
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,867
Lovely fish, all fresh.

9
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:57,400
Fresh mackerel

10
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:40,167
(SINGING) Wall flower, wall
flower, climbing up so high.

11
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:44,067
All the little children,
they are born to die,

12
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,600
except our Mary Campbell.

13
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,633
She can dance.

14
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,633
She can sing.

15
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:54,633
She can wear a wedding ring.

16
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:00,400
(SINGING) Wall flower, wall
flower, climbing up so high.

17
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,567
All the little children,
they are born to die,

18
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,933
except our Mary Campbell--

19
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,467
Yes?

20
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes, can I help you?

21
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,933
Mrs. Allen?

22
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:27,767
Mrs. Richard Allen?

23
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,067
Yes, that's right.

24
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,133
I represent a firm
of solicitors, madam.

25
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:34,367
The firm of Blunden,
Blunden, Claverton and, uh--

26
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,433
- I suppose it's about the rent.
- Oh, no.

27
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,833
Indeed no, madam.

28
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:41,667
I am no debt collector, I am a
partner in the firm of Blunden,

29
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:45,200
Blunden, Claverton, and--

30
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,567
What on earth is that
young man's name?

31
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,167
Well, no matter now.

32
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,933
The important thing is that the
news I bring will, I am sure,

33
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,500
prove entirely welcome to you.

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,933
At least, I trust it will prove
entirely welcome to you, Mrs.--

35
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,333
Allen?

36
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,500
Well, you'd better come
in, then, out of the cold.

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,400
Oh, thank you.

38
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Stand up, children.
We have a visitor.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,433
Do continue, my dears.

40
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:21,067
Is it is I who must apologize
for disturbing your meal.

41
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,167
Do sit down.

42
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,267
Perhaps you'd like a cup of tea?

43
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:31,800
Oh, the chair I accept
with gratitude, madam,

44
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,633
but the tea, I'm
afraid, I must decline.

45
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,600
But I'll come straight to
the purpose of my visit.

46
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,733
Mrs. Allen, I trust
you'll not be offended,

47
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,400
but I'm in a
position to offer you

48
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,733
a job, or rather, a reasonable
salaried occupation.

49
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,300
Why should I be offended?

50
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,167
My firm is seeking a reliable
person to act as a caretaker

51
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:53,000
to a property which
is in our charge,

52
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,633
and so far, we have been--

53
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,200
well, we've had some
difficulty in finding anyone

54
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,800
willing to take the post.

55
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,733
Difficulty?

56
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,833
Why difficulty?

57
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:07,000
It's remoteness,
you understand?

58
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,800
It's a fine house,
pleasantly situated,

59
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,133
but it stands alone in some
way from the nearest village.

60
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,567
A little woman comes out to
do what cleaning is necessary.

61
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,000
There's a rent free caretaker's
cottage attached to the house,

62
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,500
and your duties
will be very light.

63
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,633
For the children's'
sake, what do you say?

64
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,933
It is awful, isn't it?

65
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:35,600
But it's the best
that I could find.

66
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,100
So little money, so many debts.

67
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,800
A widow's pension
is all that I have.

68
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,267
Well?

69
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:43,967
Shh.

70
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,667
Excuse me.
He's had a cold.

71
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:46,633
I think he must have earache.

72
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:49,900
I-- I'll get some warm oil.

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,233
Don't cry.

74
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,367
Shh.

75
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:54,833
- Shall I help, mother?
- No, it's all right.

76
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:55,800
Thank you, dear.

77
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,833
Just look after our guest.

78
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Are you--

79
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,767
Are you sure you wouldn't
like a cup of tea?

80
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:24,833
No, thank you, Lucy.

81
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:33,967
But now that we are
alone, I wonder--

82
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,667
I wonder if I might ask
you both a question.

83
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:39,300
I hesitate because it's
rather an unusual question,

84
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
and I want you to
consider it seriously.

85
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,767
Of course, sir.

86
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,567
Fire away.

87
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,167
Yes, fire away.

88
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you think you be
afraid if you saw a ghost?

89
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,200
I-- I think, quite
honestly, sir, I

90
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,200
should be a little bit scared.

91
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,100
I think it would depend on
what sort of ghost it was, sir.

92
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
I mean, if it's just wandering
around in a white sheet

93
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,267
moaning a bit, well, it would
be all right, wouldn't it?

94
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,733
But if it was one
of these skeletons

95
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,267
with no head and a nasty
grin, well, that's different,

96
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,433
isn't it?

97
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,833
You can't grin if you've
got no head, stupid.

98
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,133
Exactly.

99
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,533
Anyway, I have very
good reason to believe

100
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,633
there are no such visions.

101
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:29,167
No, these ghosts would
appear to you, well,

102
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:32,800
very much like ordinary people.

103
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,400
Children, perhaps.

104
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,700
Children of your own age, or
even an old man such as myself.

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,433
We wouldn't be afraid of
a ghost like that, would we,

106
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,800
Lucy?

107
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,967
I mean, well, you wouldn't know
they were ghosts, would you?

108
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,900
Unless, of course, you
could see through them.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,367
I mean, right through them.

110
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,867
And even that wouldn't be
very scary if their heads

111
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,400
were in the right place.

112
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,933
Sometimes ghosts are people
who come back seeking help.

113
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,933
We would help if we could.

114
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,633
Wouldn't we, Jamie?

115
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,233
I believe you
understand, little lady.

116
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,633
Children do sometimes.

117
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:20,567
But as they grow older,
they lose their power

118
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,167
to believe in the unlikely.

119
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:29,367
When you come to
the house, you'll

120
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,700
hear all sorts of strange tales
from the people who live in it.

121
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,100
They'll tell you it's haunted.

122
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,933
But you mustn't be afraid,
because when the time comes,

123
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,000
you'll know what to do.

124
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,800
We shan't be afraid.

125
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,500
We'll do what we can.

126
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,633
Thank you, Lucy.

127
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,100
James, thank you.

128
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,500
Well, I must not stay.

129
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,767
I've been here too long.

130
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,533
- Shall I fetch mother?
- No.

131
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,667
No time, no time.

132
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,833
But ask her to call at
my chambers tomorrow.

133
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:01,733
The chambers.

134
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,567
Where is it?

135
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,767
What a sensible lad.

136
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,133
Will it be there?

137
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,467
I mean, do you know it?

138
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,400
Is this right?

139
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,267
Will it be there?

140
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,767
This address, it
looks a bit old.

141
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:16,767
It will be there.

142
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,233
CHILD: Happy Christmas!

143
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,367
What?

144
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:20,300
Oh, yes!

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,633
A happy Christmas!
Tomorrow, then.

146
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:23,900
Tell them I sent you.

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,033
Claverton will be
there, or young, uh--

148
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,267
oh, what is his blasted name?

149
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,167
A happy-- a very
happy Christmas!

150
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,767
(TOGETHER) Happy Christmas!

151
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Who was he, anyway?

152
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,667
He didn't say, did he?

153
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,567
Yes, ma'am?

154
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,100
Can I be of service?

155
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
I've come about the job.

156
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,700
A caretaker, I was told.

157
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,167
You've come about a job?

158
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,200
I understand you're looking
for a caretaker for a rather

159
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,000
remote country house.

160
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,800
The job has not yet
been advertised madam.

161
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
How did you come
to hear about it?

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,967
An old gentleman
came to see me.

163
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:25,300
Jamie, do you have the card?

164
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,300
I Expect it was Mr.
Blunden, that being

165
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,200
the first name on the card.

166
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,667
He informed me of the vacancy
and advised me to call on you.

167
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,800
I see.

168
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,100
You must forgive me, madam.

169
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,333
Mr. Blunden has not been
at the office recently,

170
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,833
and I did not realize he had
taken a hand in the matter.

171
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,733
If you will please
let me have your name,

172
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,533
I will, um, inform Mr.
Claverton that you are here.

173
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,600
Yes.
Oh!

174
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,033
Allen, Mrs. Allen.

175
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,733
And, uh, my children.

176
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,767
This is Lucy.

177
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:56,667
Lucy.

178
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:58,067
James.

179
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,567
Oh, and this is Benjamin.

180
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,267
Thank you, Mrs. Allen.

181
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,167
Excuse me.

182
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,933
Excuse me, Mr. Claverton--

183
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,800
Well, that's odd.

184
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,733
That's very odd.

185
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,267
Very odd, indeed.

186
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:18,867
Please, Mrs. Allen.

187
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,833
Mr. Claverton will see you now.

188
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:21,767
Thank you.

189
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,033
Good morning.

190
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,767
You may sit down if you wish.

191
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,400
Jamie, look.

192
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,833
It's Mr. Blunden.

193
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:13,767
So it is.

194
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,033
You are looking at Mr.
Blunden's portrait?

195
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,067
Yes, he's the one
who came to see us.

196
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:23,233
I'm afraid I've got
you out there, sonny Jim.

197
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,967
The portrait is, in fact, of Mr.
Blunden's great grandfather who

198
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,933
died about 100 years ago,
and I doubt if our Mr.

199
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,900
Blunden came to see you.

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,700
He's bedridden.

201
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,733
Should be in a home, he should.

202
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,333
Oh, dear lady, I
must say how delighted

203
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:45,333
I am to have a responsible
person like yourself in charge.

204
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,767
I shall write and
confirm our arrangements.

205
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,700
Arnold?

206
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,633
And I feel quite
certain that you'll

207
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,867
have no trouble from that, uh,
little matter we talked about.

208
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,833
A mere country
superstition, nothing more.

209
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:02,900
Are you Smith?

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,833
I beg your pardon.

211
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,233
Are you Smith?

212
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,267
You know, on the card.

213
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:07,800
Blunden, Claverton, and Smith.

214
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,400
No, sonny Jim, I
am Mr. Clutterbuck.

215
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,133
- You should be glad.
- Why?

216
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:13,633
No one could forget
a name like that.

217
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,933
It is a silly name.

218
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,900
I'm sorry, sir.

219
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,033
Cheerio then, Herbert.

220
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,367
Cheerio, Dick.

221
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,733
Any more want to get on, then?

222
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,167
Just us now, Herbert.

223
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:39,567
The big house, please.

224
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,567
Langley Park.

225
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,033
Langley Park?

226
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,567
Langley Park.

227
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,733
Your key, madam.

228
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:15,433
LUCY: Please let
us be happy here.

229
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:20,200
Bless mommy and Jamie,
Benji and darling daddy.

230
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,900
Amen.

231
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,533
And don't let there
be any ghosts.

232
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,533
JAMIE: Oh, shut up, Luce.

233
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,900
Poor .

234
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,933
How sad.

235
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,367
BOY'S VOICE: Sara?

236
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,700
BOY'S VOICE: Sara?

237
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,700
Sara?

238
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,600
Sara?

239
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,367
Sara?

240
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,667
GIRL'S VOICE: I know
where you are, Georgie.

241
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,067
I'll find you.

242
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,233
Wait for me, Georgie!

243
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,033
Wait!

244
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,600
Oh, Georgie, please wait.

245
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,733
BOY'S VOICE: It's Bella.

246
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,667
Hide!

247
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:20,000
Hide, Sara!

248
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,167
Sara, hide!

249
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,600
But I did hear voices.

250
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,300
Honestly, I did.

251
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,233
My dear girl, all big
houses have voices if they're

252
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,667
alone for a long while.

253
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,400
Everyone knows that.

254
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,867
You're just
trying to be clever.

255
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,333
Good night, James.

256
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:41,900
James!

257
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,833
James!

258
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:43,800
Come here!

259
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,733
Look!

260
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,800
Just-- James!

261
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,833
what's the matter?

262
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:52,400
Well, I think I've seen--
what is-- oh, James, you know!

263
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,400
Ghosts?

264
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,767
James, two!

265
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:57,767
Two!

266
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:58,767
Blooming .

267
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,667
LUCY: Jamie--

268
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:10,667
Lucy--

269
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,633
Lucy--

270
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,100
At last.

271
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
We have someone with
a little good sense.

272
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,067
I-- I beg your pardon.

273
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,100
You didn't run away screaming.

274
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,467
You didn't run away.

275
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:31,400
Well, I did.

276
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,067
At first I did.

277
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:37,400
I'm sorry, but in the mist
I thought you were ghosts.

278
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,867
They do say the house
is haunted, you know.

279
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,433
Yes we did know.

280
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,267
I suppose if we say that we
are ghosts, you will run away.

281
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:51,767
Mr. Blunden said
children of our own age.

282
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:53,400
You are ghosts.

283
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:17,567
SARA: Georgie, I do
believe we have found help.

284
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,867
JAMIE: Tell us.

285
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,800
Tell us how we can help.

286
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,967
I mean, who are you?

287
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,867
LUCY: Yes, tell us from
the very beginning.

288
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,200
JAMIE: Start with
"once upon a time."

289
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,267
All the best stories
start with that.

290
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,000
James!

291
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,633
SARA: All right.

292
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:39,033
Once upon a time, we
lived very happily here.

293
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:42,500
But in the spring
of the year 1818,

294
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,133
our mother and father
were tragically

295
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,800
killed when their
carriage overturned coming

296
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,733
back from London one night.

297
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,900
I am the resurrection
and the life.

298
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,133
He that believeth in me, though
he be dead, yet shall he live--

299
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:01,033
SARA (VOICEOVER): Uncle Bertie,
who was our father's half

300
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,467
brother, became our
guardian, and Mr.

301
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:06,933
Blunden, the family solicitor,
became our other guardian.

302
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,000
Do stop sniveling in
front of the servants.

303
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,867
It'll do no good.

304
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:30,133
SARA (VOICEOVER):
After the funeral,

305
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,500
Uncle Burt lived in London.

306
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,700
He took an unusual
interest in the ballet

307
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,600
and fell in love
with a ballerina.

308
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,600
(SINGING) I'm a naughty girl.

309
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,400
And I'm a naughty boy.

310
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,367
It takes a naughty girl
to make a naughty boy.

311
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:56,933
put them all
together and

312
00:22:57,033 --> 00:23:01,933
a naughty .

313
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,000
SARA (VOICEOVER):
Her name is Arabella,

314
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,700
and she's very pretty.

315
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,567
Uncle Bertie thinks so, too, but
in her mind she's only a child.

316
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:37,067
SARA (VOICEOVER): He often
returned home to Langley Park

317
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,333
to supplement his income
from a private source.

318
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:08,100
SARA (VOICEOVER):
And so Arabella

319
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,567
and Uncle Bertie were engaged.

320
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,967
That evening, they went
to ask Bella's parents

321
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:17,267
for their consent to marry.

322
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,833
SARA (VOICEOVER): Mr. and Mrs.
Wickens were the proprietors

323
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:32,867
of a select hotel.

324
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,100
Mama!

325
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,833
This is Bertie what
I told you about.

326
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:37,733
We're engaged!

327
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,767
Look!

328
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:41,767
Oh!

329
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:44,367
Wickens!

330
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:46,233
Come and meet this here tough!

331
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:50,700
It's our little
Bella's intended!

332
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,033
Wickens!

333
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:01,167
SARA (VOICEOVER): Uncle
Bertie and Bella were married.

334
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,067
Now where's she going
for her honeymoon?

335
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:07,600
Like she says, Paris, Rome?

336
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,300
I mean, even if it's only the
Isle of Wight, for God's sake,

337
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,800
put her out of her misery!

338
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,567
It may well be the Isle of
Wight, dear mother-in-law.

339
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,667
The Isle of Wight!

340
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:18,667
God's truth!

341
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:19,600
Steady, dearest.

342
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:26,500
The truth is that financially
I am hopelessly embarrassed.

343
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,900
Hopelessly.

344
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,333
I haven't said so as I had no
wish to spoil our wedding day.

345
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:34,867
Well, you're having a
darn good try, Albert.

346
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:36,867
You mean you're-- you're
short of the ready?

347
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:38,800
Is that it?

348
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,733
Well, blow me!

349
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,200
What an empty bottle
of gin you are!

350
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,833
Who's got it all, then?

351
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,167
Who's got it?

352
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:49,667
Master Georgie
is the only member

353
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,633
of the family with money.

354
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:55,667
30,000 pounds, to be exact, left
to him by his father, William.

355
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:59,633
Would have been mine, of course,
but being only a half brother,

356
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:01,467
Georgie gets it.

357
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:03,067
30,000 nicker?

358
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:07,100
Left to him in trust,
mother-in-law, until he's 21.

359
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,867
Can't be touched.

360
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:10,767
It's Georgie's and his alone.

361
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:14,000
Unless he dies, of course,
but heaven forbid the thought.

362
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,233
But he's only 10.

363
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,200
He's got years to go.

364
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,700
My Bells will have gone
to seed in 11 years.

365
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,333
I'm not going to have her living
in this dirty, great mansion in

366
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:30,467
poverty, slowly going to seed.

367
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,467
Dear mother-in-law,
I will find a way.

368
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:34,500
I assure you.

369
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,133
My Bella will not
suffer, I promise.

370
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:38,867
Oh, she will not.

371
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:42,667
You are quite correct
there, Albert.

372
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:49,133
My little rose, my nightingale.

373
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,067
That Georgie's got
a lot to answer for,

374
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:54,033
being only 10 and all
that money going to waste.

375
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:56,500
He's got a lot to answer for.

376
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,967
I shall commence my
economies by sacking as many

377
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:03,333
of the surplus staff
in this house as I can.

378
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:07,733
We shall have our
honeymoon, my dearest Bella.

379
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,433
Oh, make it soon,
Bertie dearest.

380
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:11,400
Make it soon.

381
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,533
Did it, there.

382
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:17,467
Now you.

383
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,500
SARA (VOICEOVER) : Most
of the stuff were sacked,

384
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,467
and Mrs. Wickens took
over the housekeeping.

385
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:31,100
And good riddance
to the lot of you!

386
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:35,267
Sara!

387
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:36,667
Georgie!

388
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:39,467
Are you trying to get me in the
hot with your uncle, are you?

389
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,700
Get in here before you
catch your death of cold!

390
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,933
Well, don't dawdle.

391
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:46,067
Run!

392
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:58,700
Catch their death of cold.

393
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:16,100
Meakin!

394
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,933
You served the master
and mistress, have you?

395
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:18,833
(FRIGHTENED) Yes.

396
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:19,833
"Yes, Mrs. Wickens!"

397
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,200
Yes, Mrs. Wickens.

398
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,033
Now you take those
scraps to the children

399
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,767
and make sure they're in bed.

400
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:26,367
Yes, Mrs. Wickens.

401
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:28,700
Shall I leave the windows
open like you said?

402
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,567
Only it is very
cold tonight.

403
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:31,667
Leave 'em open.

404
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,067
It's good for them!

405
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,933
Too much comfort's
bad for children.

406
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:37,200
Too many blankets
is bad for them.

407
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,533
Now, you make sure they
haven't put no extra blankets.

408
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:40,600
It's bad for them!

409
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,500
Yes.

410
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,500
"Yes, Mrs. Wickens!"

411
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,000
Yes, Mrs. Wickens!

412
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,600
You skinny slut!

413
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,333
Now, my love.

414
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,067
How's that consomme
coming along?

415
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,933
There, Miss Sarah.
That will keep you warm.

416
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:15,933
It's a pair of
warming newspapers.

417
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,533
- Quick, Tom!

418
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:18,467
It's Meakin!

419
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,000
Right, then.

420
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,167
Good night, miss.

421
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,600
Good night, Master Georgie.

422
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,500
Good night, Tom.

423
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,800
That's a wonder,
you being in bed.

424
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,700
Here's your supper.

425
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,300
Good night.

426
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,767
And leave that window open.

427
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:46,700
Mrs. Wickens' orders.

428
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,467
Good night, then.

429
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:58,467
SARA: Good night, Tom.

430
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,200
SARA (VOICEOVER) : For a long
time, we endured hard beds,

431
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,367
scraps, and bread and water.

432
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:13,500
We did not truly think
ourselves in danger.

433
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,733
Then one night.

434
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:20,333
MRS. WICKENS: Time's
a wasting away!

435
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:26,300
It's taking too
long, Mr. Wickens.

436
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,067
They're getting
fatter, not thinner.

437
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:31,967
Fatter, Wickens!

438
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:34,333
Do you hear me, you ugly lump?

439
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,667
Because I'm talking to you.

440
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:37,600
Wickens!

441
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,833
Do you hear me?

442
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:39,767
Uh.

443
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:40,767
Good!

444
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:43,967
Because I'm talking to you.

445
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:46,367
They didn't get no colds.

446
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,400
Why?

447
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,567
Why!

448
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,667
There was a bloomin'
hurricane blowing

449
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,200
through here the other night.

450
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,000
They should be wasting away
with a cold in their bones.

451
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,933
Aren't you interested
in cash, you great lump?

452
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:04,033
Cash!

453
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:09,533
30,000 pounds if he snuffs it.

454
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:14,233
It'll be all our
darlin' little Bella's

455
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,133
if that Georgie snuffs it.

456
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:22,733
Her as well, that stuck up Sara.

457
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,133
Here as well.

458
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:26,100
They mean us, Georgie.

459
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,767
What's "snuff it," Sara?

460
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:29,933
Do they mean to kill us, Sara?

461
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,800
MRS. WICKENS: An accident
must befall them.

462
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,767
Can't wait forever.

463
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:36,467
An accident.

464
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:42,400
A quick accident , my love,
and you are gonna help me.

465
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:46,167
Are you listening?

466
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:47,000
Uh.

467
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,967
Uncle Bertie.

468
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,267
We must tell him at once!

469
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,267
Come on!

470
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:56,067
BERTIE:

471
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,667
Lovely, my little
precious buttercup.

472
00:32:58,767 --> 00:32:59,667
Uncle Bertie!

473
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,000
Oh, please, Uncle Bertie!

474
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,333
BERTIE: Get out of here.

475
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:03,800
What do you think you're doing?
- Uncle Bertie!

476
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,233
Get out of here, both of you!
You should be in bed.

477
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,833
Wandering about at
this time of night!

478
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:08,133
Are we to have no privacy?

479
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,600
But we're to be murdered!

480
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,633
You certainly are.

481
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:11,867
By me, unless you go at once.

482
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:13,433
Shall I take a strap to you?

483
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,167
But we are!

484
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:15,333
Oh, please listen.

485
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:16,733
Mrs. Wickens says
that we are too

486
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,333
fat, that we should be
cold, and that an accident

487
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:19,033
should snuff us.

488
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:20,033
Bed, Sara.

489
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,467
It's true, it's true!

490
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:22,400
It is!

491
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,000
Bed, both of you.

492
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,600
I'm not in the mood
for drama tonight.

493
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,433
Your Auntie Bella has
been entertaining me

494
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,833
with classical
moments from history,

495
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:34,800
and you bring me low drama.

496
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,033
Be off with you at once.

497
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,500
Bella, send them out, my love.

498
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,033
Yes, Bertie, my love.

499
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:44,767
How dare you talk like
that about my ma and pa!

500
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:46,533
Bed!

501
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:47,867
Please, Uncle.

502
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:50,733
For the last time, Sara.

503
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:51,933
Murders, indeed.

504
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:55,233
Imaginations,
overactive imaginations.

505
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:59,033
Say your prayers, and
ask God to forgive you.

506
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,200
Sara?

507
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,967
Yes?

508
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:24,533
Perhaps we did imagine.

509
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:25,867
We didn't, Georgie.

510
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm very much afraid we didn't.

511
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:34,867
Langley Park.

512
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:35,800
Buckinghamshire.

513
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Yes, I've put that.

514
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,967
April
the 16th, 1818.

515
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:42,833
"Dear Mr. Blunden, you
are our only chance.

516
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:44,700
The Wickens are bent
on destroying us.

517
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,067
Please, please help.

518
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,367
Uncle Bertie won't listen.

519
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:49,167
He says it's all
imagination, but it's not.

520
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,200
We shall run away
if you don't help.

521
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,800
The danger is very
great for us."

522
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,733
Yours--

523
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:00,967
--Sara.

524
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,167
And me.

525
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,467
Come along, come
along, come along.

526
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:09,033
"Stupid and
childish complaints."

527
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:11,067
"About your harsh treatment."

528
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:16,600
"And threaten to run away."

529
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,033
"They must not run
away, Mrs. Wickens.

530
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:25,333
Lock them up."

531
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:00,467
Sara.

532
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,800
library?

533
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,700
What does it mean, Georgie?

534
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,100
What on earth is it?

535
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,633
GEORGIE: Come on.

536
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,233
Come on where?

537
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:47,100
The library, of course, silly.

538
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,567
Meakin
didn't lock the door.

539
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,967
Come on.

540
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,933
Where, Georgie?

541
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:44,467
I mean, what are we looking for?

542
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:45,833
Don't ask me.

543
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,400
Just look, as it said.

544
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,500
GEORGIE: Why has the
library changed, Sara?

545
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,467
Has it been magic, Sara?

546
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:09,533
SARA: Shh, Georgie.

547
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:10,467
Shh.

548
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:44,500
A charm to move
the wheel of time.

549
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,867
A charm.

550
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:34,900
It's pleased, Georgie.

551
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,300
The library is pleased.

552
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:07,033
Bring and brew the
following herbs together.

553
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,633
Balm, hyssop, bloodwort--

554
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:10,767
Yech.

555
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,933
SARA (VOICEOVER)
: Musk, toadflax.

556
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:13,933
GEORGIE (VOICEOVER): Toadflax?

557
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,533
SARA: Yes.

558
00:40:15,633 --> 00:40:19,700
pennywhistle,
,, and drink

559
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,900
the liquid.

560
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,133
It will separate
your minds completely

561
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:23,900
from the time you are in.

562
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,633
Do you understand that, Georgie?

563
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:27,800
A bit.

564
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,933
Perhaps this is
our chance, Georgie.

565
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:31,233
Look.

566
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:34,900
To make the mind still,
to escape from time.

567
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,833
There, Georgie!

568
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,133
To escape.

569
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:38,900
Someone is trying to
tell us how to escape.

570
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,767
Not to another place,
but to another time.

571
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:44,767
Oh, Georgie!

572
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,933
It might be poisonous, Georgie.

573
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,433
I thought of that.

574
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,500
I'll put it in Mrs. Wickens'
drink to see if she'll die

575
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,200
or not.

576
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,967
Suppose she does die.

577
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,867
Good if she does.

578
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,400
That'll be murder.

579
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,067
I'm not giving it her
because I think it is poison.

580
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:21,433
I'm only making sure it isn't.

581
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:25,700
Why are you pulling
a funny face?

582
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:29,200
It's either Mrs.
Wickens or her cat,

583
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,567
and that cat never
did anyone any harm.

584
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:39,367
Breakfast, you brats!

585
00:42:39,467 --> 00:42:41,300
Oh!

586
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:45,233
Sara?

587
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:46,000
Yes?

588
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,967
It wasn't poison.

589
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:52,833
Go with you?

590
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:54,733
You mean back to your time?

591
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:55,767
Well, how can we?

592
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:57,233
I'll help you find the herbs.

593
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:59,333
You can brew the
potion as we did.

594
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:01,700
After that, it depends
upon whether your will

595
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,833
is great enough to help.

596
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:04,100
Well, it is.

597
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,133
You don't we'd just
stand around and let

598
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:06,600
that awful old woman do you in?

599
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,667
Snuff us.

600
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:08,933
- Snuff you.
- Sara?

601
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:10,367
We'll help you, Sara.

602
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:11,067
Sara?

603
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:14,967
I don't feel well.

604
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:16,033
Sara?

605
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:17,233
Don't be afraid, darling.

606
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,900
When you get back,
I shall be there.

607
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,867
Sara.

608
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,867
Sara.

609
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:24,767
Sara.

610
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,700
It's because he's so young.

611
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,033
He often returns before me.

612
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:33,367
It's all right.

613
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:35,100
We always arrive back together.
We must hurry.

614
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,167
Georgie is a warning to us
that I may soon follow him.

615
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,133
Now please don't forget, put
five leaves of each into a bowl

616
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:46,333
and pour on hot water.

617
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:51,433
Keep it warm for now, and strain
it off through a muslin cloth.

618
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:56,300
Bring the potion, and meet
me here at sunset tomorrow.

619
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,267
Promise you'll not
fail us, Jamie!

620
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:02,233
Promise!

621
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,000
Promise!

622
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,967
Please promise!

623
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:21,033
I promise!

624
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:22,100
I promise, Sara!

625
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,767
Lucy, I just had
a brilliant idea.

626
00:44:25,867 --> 00:44:27,100
What?

627
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,400
All we have to do is
hunt in the churchyard.

628
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,500
Why?

629
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,800
Well, Lucy, sometimes
you really are dim.

630
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,933
If none of the gravestones has
Sara and Georgie's names on,

631
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:36,067
then we shall know
they didn't die.

632
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:37,400
Don't you see?

633
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,667
We shall know in advance
that we've saved them.

634
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:39,867
Oh, I see.

635
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,367
We can go off into
the past knowing

636
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:42,867
everything will be all right.

637
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:44,567
Yes, I told you it
was a brilliant idea.

638
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:45,533
MAN: Shh!

639
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:47,000
Quiet, you children.

640
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:54,833
LUCY: I don't like it, Jamie.

641
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:57,167
Not one bit.

642
00:44:57,267 --> 00:44:59,533
It's just not nice.

643
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:00,967
I'm not going to look.

644
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:02,233
JAMIE: Don't, then.

645
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:07,533
William-- no.

646
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,433
Sara Catherine Latimer.

647
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:31,767
Lucy!

648
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:32,700
Lucy, come here!

649
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:46,633
Sara Catherine Latimer.

650
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:49,000
George Richard Latimer.

651
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,867
Died April the 21st, 1818.

652
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,867
That's tomorrow, Lucy.

653
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:58,033
Tomorrow, only 100 years ago.

654
00:46:01,067 --> 00:46:02,467
Make sure that top's
on tight, Lucy.

655
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:04,367
We don't want to go through
making it all again.

656
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:05,700
We haven't got time, anyway.

657
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,700
We're late as it is.

658
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,633
Come on.

659
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:15,567
JAMIE: Sara!
LUCY: Sara!

660
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:22,033
SARA : I thought you'd
changed your minds.

661
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,067
Where's Georgie?

662
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:28,700
He had a slight disagreement
with Mrs. Wickens.

663
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,400
She's locked him in the cellar.

664
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,700
Tom is guarding him
for me while I'm away.

665
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,033
We can't be long as I only
drank a little of the potion.

666
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:40,367
Sara before anything else,
we must tell you that--

667
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,533
James!

668
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:42,467
Tell me, James.

669
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,367
Whatever it is, tell me.

670
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:47,933
Well, it was in the graveyard.

671
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:49,667
I know about the grave.

672
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:51,533
I've never told Georgie.

673
00:46:51,633 --> 00:46:52,600
But I know.

674
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,600
But the date, Sara.

675
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,567
It was 100 years ago tomorrow.

676
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:58,400
BLUNDEN: That's true.

677
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,800
Blunden, remember?

678
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,400
Camden Town?
- Hello!

679
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,333
Oh, yes!

680
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,933
We haven't much
time, my dears.

681
00:47:11,033 --> 00:47:13,933
Excuse me, sir, but
you were dead, too.

682
00:47:14,033 --> 00:47:15,000
Part of me, Jame, my boy.

683
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,100
A part only.

684
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,467
I am the dead part of Blunden.

685
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:20,133
The other part of
me was that Blunden

686
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:22,767
who wouldn't listen to the
pleas of Sara and Georgie,

687
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:24,800
the Blunden who failed them.

688
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,933
I have suffered for 100 years,
tormented by my own conscience.

689
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:32,900
Seems more like 1,000 years.

690
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,433
But now I've been
given the chance

691
00:47:34,533 --> 00:47:37,100
to put right the wrong, the
terrible wrong, I have done

692
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,233
and to bring my
punishment to an end.

693
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,833
But first I have to find
someone to trust me,

694
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:48,300
to trust me once again, to
trust me even with his life.

695
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,233
Lastly, I must go back to
undo the harm I've caused.

696
00:47:55,533 --> 00:47:59,333
Mr. Blunden, sir, I'm the one
who has to trust you, aren't I?

697
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:02,200
I mean, that's why you brought
us here to Langley Park,

698
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,667
why you came to Camden Town.

699
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:06,333
Yes.

700
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:09,933
It's not an easy thing,
I know, James, but all

701
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:12,500
will be revealed, my dears.

702
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,767
Tell me what to do.

703
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:16,467
That is not yet clear, my boy.

704
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:18,700
But whatever it may be,
nothing shall harm you.

705
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,133
I promise that I shall
guard you from all dangers

706
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:24,267
however they may come.

707
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:29,200
I know I'm not worthy,
but it's our only hope.

708
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,900
Sara's, George's, and mine.

709
00:48:41,967 --> 00:48:43,067
Thank you.

710
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,467
Lucy, you must trust him, too.

711
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:52,633
I'll try.

712
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:55,033
I really will.

713
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,200
Thank you.

714
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:04,100
It's time to go.

715
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,667
Go on.

716
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:22,700
Jamie--

717
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,600
Go on.

718
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:28,400
A bit more.

719
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:05,433
LUCY (VOICEOVER): James.

720
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:07,433
Jamie.

721
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:09,867
Jamie.

722
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:11,100
Jamie.

723
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,967
JAMIE (VOICEOVER):
Lucy, it's working.

724
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:16,100
It's working.

725
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,633
SARA (VOICEOVER):
It's time to go.

726
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:19,133
BLUNDEN (VOICEOVER)
: Whatever it may be,

727
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:20,333
nothing shall harm you.

728
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:22,167
JAMIE (VOICEOVER):
There's Georgie.

729
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:23,633
The sexton said it was a fire.

730
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:26,567
SARA (VOICEOVER): Promise
you'll not fail us, Jamie!

731
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:28,000
Promise!

732
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,833
GEORGIE (VOICEOVER): Go
with you back to your time.

733
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:32,733
TOM: I see by the
way you're dressed--

734
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:36,300
I see by the way
you're dressed--

735
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,767
I see by the way
you're dressed that you

736
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:39,600
don't come from hereabouts.

737
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,000
I suppose you wouldn't have come
from the new world, would you?

738
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,100
- New world?
- Aye, America.

739
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,067
It's the new world.

740
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:47,200
Yes, I suppose
you could say we

741
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,367
have come from the new world.

742
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:51,267
They say it's a
wonderful place.

743
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,800
Uh, yes, it is.

744
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,033
Course, it is a
terrible long journey,

745
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,167
but it is one I plan to make
meself one of these days

746
00:50:58,267 --> 00:50:59,633
when I'm older like.

747
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:02,233
Oh, Miss Sara's been teaching
me to read and write.

748
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,667
I mean to go there
and try my fortune.

749
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:07,167
They say there's a fine future
in America for a young man

750
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:08,833
that can read and
write, and ain't

751
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,433
afraid of a bit of hard work.

752
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:11,700
Yes, Tom, yes.

753
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,033
Now, how is my brother?

754
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:14,200
Oh, yes.

755
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,300
He's safe, but he's
growing hungry.

756
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,033
He told me.

757
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:17,467
MRS. WICKENS: Sara!

758
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:19,633
Sara!

759
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:22,333
Sara?

760
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:23,667
Sara!

761
00:51:23,767 --> 00:51:24,633
Sara?

762
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:29,067
Where are you, you hussy?

763
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:33,433
Kissing and cuddling with
that garden boy, no doubt.

764
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:35,067
I know your game.

765
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:37,633
Oh, let me stay here
and fight here, please!

766
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:38,833
I'm not afraid of her!

767
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:40,833
You know I'd die
for you, Miss Sara.

768
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:42,567
Yes, Tom, I know.

769
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:43,600
Now go quickly for my sake.

770
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,500
Please!

771
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,500
All right.

772
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:53,367
We don't go with him?

773
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:54,700
We don't want her
to know we're here.

774
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,700
No, stay in the shadows.

775
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,367
Sara!

776
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:00,267
Sara!

777
00:52:55,867 --> 00:52:57,767
So there you are.

778
00:52:57,867 --> 00:52:59,467
And all alone, I see.

779
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,833
Who was here with
you a moment ago?

780
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:04,100
One of them vulgar
servants, I'll be bound.

781
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,867
Not only have you
got no sense, miss.

782
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,333
You got no taste, neither.

783
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:09,933
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Wickens.

784
00:53:10,033 --> 00:53:12,500
I only came out to speak a word
to poor Georgie in the cellar.

785
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,667
You came out to speak
to him the cellar?

786
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:18,400
Where is the cellar, miss?

787
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,400
Where is it?

788
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,900
It's under the
kitchen, Mrs. Wickens.

789
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,200
"Oh, it's under the
kitchen, Mrs. Wickens."

790
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,000
Then what you doing
in the stable?

791
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,000
The cellar ain't under
the stable, now, is it?

792
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:29,900
No, Mrs. Wickens.

793
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,233
"No, Mrs. Wickens."

794
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,867
I was going to talk to
him through the grating.

795
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:35,167
Oh, was you?

796
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:38,433
Well, it'll be boarded
up in the morning.

797
00:53:38,533 --> 00:53:39,867
Oh, please let him
out, Mrs. Wickens!

798
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,067
He's only a little boy.

799
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:42,867
It's so dark in there for him.

800
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:45,433
Don't talk to me
about that brat!

801
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:48,267
After what he said to
me, he'll be lucky to be

802
00:53:48,367 --> 00:53:50,033
out 'afore Christmas!
Next year!

803
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:52,433
- Oh, please!
- Shove off!

804
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:54,400
Me arm's gone mad!

805
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,233
Get-- get back!

806
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,567
Back!

807
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:03,533
What's that?

808
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,600
It was me, and I'll do
it again if you touch Sara!

809
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,533
You got persons aiding
and abetting you, have you?

810
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:12,333
I tell you, it was me!

811
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:14,600
James!

812
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,800
I got to walk off
that red ..

813
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,700
Last month it was Chinamen
coming out the ,,

814
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,267
and now it's invisible beings
trying to grab my body.

815
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:23,700
Are we ghosts?
Did it work?

816
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,500
- Yes!
- But Tom could see us.

817
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,267
Why can't she?

818
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:28,233
Too old, too insensitive.

819
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,067
Who is?

820
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:32,467
Who's too bloomin' old?

821
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,133
miss!

822
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:36,000
Come on !

823
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,067
But Georgie!

824
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:39,633
He stays where he is.

825
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:40,633
James.

826
00:54:40,733 --> 00:54:41,533
What?

827
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:43,567
She didn't see us.

828
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:46,433
Mrs. Wickens didn't see us.

829
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,433
We're ghosts.

830
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:50,667
We really are.

831
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:53,933
Bloomin' .

832
00:54:54,033 --> 00:54:55,867
SARA: Please let
go, Mrs. Wickens!

833
00:54:55,967 --> 00:54:56,900
You're hurting me!

834
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,100
MRS. WICKENS: I will hurt you!

835
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,700
I'll hurt you if I have my way!

836
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,500
Children

837
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,033
Meakin?

838
00:55:05,133 --> 00:55:06,500
Meakin!
- Yes?

839
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,667
Yes, Mrs. Wickens!

840
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,067
Yes, Mrs. Wickens.

841
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:11,467
Take Miss Sara up to her
bedroom and lock her in.

842
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:12,433
MEAKIN: Yes.

843
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:13,200
Yes, Mrs. Wickens!

844
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,733
Yes, Mrs. Wickens!

845
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,300
BELLA: Mama!

846
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,267
Mama!

847
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:19,233
Mama!

848
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:23,000
See my new, pink silk.

849
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,200
Oh, Bella!

850
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,400
You look a picture.

851
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,267
Do us a turn around,
my thrush, my linnet,

852
00:55:33,367 --> 00:55:37,200
and let your old ma see you.

853
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,467
Oh, Bella, you look a picture.

854
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:43,267
Just you wait till
that Bertie casts

855
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:45,800
his eyes on you .

856
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,833
Ain't it pretty, Sarah Sue?

857
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:52,933
(SINGING) Ain't it
pretty, Sarah Sue?

858
00:55:53,033 --> 00:55:57,500
Would it look the same on you?

859
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,733
Ain't it pretty?

860
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,700
Very pretty, Bella.

861
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,767
Yes, it is.

862
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:05,100
Thank you.

863
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,600
JAMIE: I think she looks
like a stuffed pink pig.

864
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,533
Bella!

865
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:14,300
She can't see us, can she?

866
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,500
She's only got
the mind of a child.

867
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,333
I think perhaps she can.

868
00:56:18,433 --> 00:56:23,467
BELLA:

869
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,333
Oh, momma!

870
00:56:25,433 --> 00:56:26,533
Ghosts!

871
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,000
I swear, momma dear, I
can see right through 'em!

872
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,333
Right through 'em!

873
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:31,867
MRS. WICKENS: Hush now, Bella.

874
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:34,267
There ain't nobody there.
Here.

875
00:56:34,367 --> 00:56:36,267
Let me smell your breath.

876
00:56:36,367 --> 00:56:37,800
You haven't been in
my gin, have you?

877
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,233
They're there.

878
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:40,067
There.

879
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:42,333
(SCARY VOICE) Fear me, Bella.

880
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:45,067
I shall haunt you
until you release

881
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:48,967
little Georgie from the cellar.

882
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:50,933
Let Georgie out
of the cellar, ma.

883
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:54,467
And then perhaps
they'll leave me alone.

884
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:56,067
Leave you alone, love?

885
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:58,667
There's nobody there.

886
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:00,300
There is, ma!

887
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,067
(SCARY VOICE) Let Georgie go.

888
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,900
Don't overdo it.

889
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,133
What on earth is going on?

890
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:09,067
What is occurring?

891
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:10,400
I heard screaming!

892
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,300
Bella!

893
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:16,067
Bella?

894
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:17,667
Oh, Bertie!

895
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,600
Bella.

896
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,233
I was that scared.

897
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:22,833
Tell ma to let him
out of the cellar

898
00:57:22,933 --> 00:57:25,467
or they'll be after me again.

899
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,833
Let who out?

900
00:57:26,933 --> 00:57:28,667
Who is after you?

901
00:57:28,767 --> 00:57:30,467
What on earth is going on here?

902
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:31,467
Mrs. Wickens!

903
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:35,433
Master Georgie
was very rude, sir.

904
00:57:35,533 --> 00:57:36,967
Bertie, dear.

905
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:38,500
Very rude.

906
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,367
I-- I put him in the cellar
to cool his blood off, sir.

907
00:57:42,467 --> 00:57:43,133
Bertie, dear.

908
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:44,967
Release him at once.

909
00:57:45,067 --> 00:57:48,100
I will not have
Bella distressed.

910
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,800
Meakin, fetch some
smelling salts.

911
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,500
Yes, sir.

912
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,133
Why are you waiting?

913
00:57:55,233 --> 00:58:00,533
Son-in-law, my dear, how
can I leave my baby like this?

914
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:05,700
My wife, mother-in-law, is
perfectly all right with me.

915
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,300
I demand that you do as I say.

916
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,333
Oh!

917
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:10,633
If you shout, I'll
have a heart attack.

918
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:11,567
I will!

919
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:13,233
I'll have heart failure!

920
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:14,367
Oh!

921
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:15,100
Oh!

922
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,533
I think I'm having it!

923
00:58:16,633 --> 00:58:17,467
I'm off!

924
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:18,267
Oh!

925
00:58:18,367 --> 00:58:19,800
You are off, Mrs. Wickens.

926
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,200
Get up.

927
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,600
Your performance this
evening is not convincing.

928
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:29,033
Get up, I say, and
release Georgie instantly.

929
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:30,133
Go with her, Sara.

930
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:35,433
Now, my little sausage.

931
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:36,867
Who is after you?

932
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:38,033
We are.

933
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:43,267
Oh, my God.

934
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,533
What is all the
noise downstairs?

935
00:58:50,633 --> 00:58:53,900
They're having dinner.

936
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,433
Why don't we eavesdrop?

937
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:57,567
We might find out
what they're up to.

938
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,733
Georgie, if you're
going to come with us,

939
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,300
you'll have to be quiet.

940
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,033
Promise?

941
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:07,933
Promise.

942
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:08,900
Good.

943
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,533
And the vicar

944
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:12,500
JAMIE: They're finishing.

945
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,267
There's Mr. Blunden.

946
00:59:13,367 --> 00:59:15,800
It's all falling into shape.

947
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,100
Time is running out.

948
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,967
I can't bear to think of it.

949
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:22,867
nightingale ..

950
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:24,133
No.

951
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:25,800
It'll only be for a
day or two, my pet,

952
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,333
and Mr. Blunden
thinks it advisable

953
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:29,600
that I go with him to London.

954
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,500
I'm sorry, Mistress Arabella.

955
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,600
Mr. Blunden doesn't know
how sorry he's going to be.

956
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,567
Now, Georgie, what
should we do ??

957
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:41,100
--and it'll save a
great deal of time.

958
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,000
And I must get some
money, my sausage,

959
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,000
or there'll be no more
silk dresses for you.

960
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,200
Mr. Blunden!
Oh, sir!

961
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,333
You must listen to us!

962
00:59:47,433 --> 00:59:48,467
What do you
think you're doing?

963
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:49,933
SARA: Uncle Bertie
won't heed us!

964
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:50,800
GEORGIE: He doesn't
care if we snuff it.

965
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,833
Listen to her.

966
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:53,167
How dare you!

967
00:59:53,267 --> 00:59:54,633
You are two
mischievous children.

968
00:59:54,733 --> 00:59:56,900
Your uncle is a very kind
and considerate guardian,

969
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,600
and you should be more careful.

970
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,000
SARA: But Mrs. Wickens, she
means to harm us, Mr. Blunden.

971
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,233
She does!
I know she does!

972
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:03,967
Don't leave us here
along with her.

973
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,900
(WHISPERING)
Please listen to her.

974
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,667
Bertie dear,
surely they cannot

975
01:00:07,767 --> 01:00:08,833
mean to accuse dear mama?

976
01:00:08,933 --> 01:00:10,233
No, of course not, my dearest.

977
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:12,733
Your mother is a
splendid woman, kind

978
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,533
and considerate at all times.

979
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:15,667
Quite unique.

980
01:00:15,767 --> 01:00:18,167
Your mother is a
drunken old witch, Bella!

981
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:24,067
I can't bear it, Jamie.

982
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:25,067
I just can't bear it.

983
01:00:32,367 --> 01:00:33,367
I'll go.

984
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:35,233
If Mr. Blunden sees
me, he might remember

985
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:36,700
what's going to happen.

986
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,333
LUCY: It hasn't happened,
so how can he remember it?

987
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:39,967
He must remember something.

988
01:00:40,067 --> 01:00:41,667
He brought us here.

989
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:48,300
There are two of you.

990
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,433
Two Mr. Blundens.

991
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:53,667
Yes, James, my boy.

992
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:57,567
There are two of us, though
we're both the same man.

993
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:59,000
But he wouldn't know.

994
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,433
It Was I who brought you here.

995
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,233
What if I told him?

996
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:09,333
He wouldn't see or hear you.

997
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:13,200
He's a shallow, insensitive man.

998
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,600
It's very difficult,
Mr. Blunden.

999
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,933
We came to help you, but
there's so little we can do.

1000
01:01:19,033 --> 01:01:21,267
It's not yet the time.

1001
01:01:21,367 --> 01:01:22,800
Everything must go on as before.

1002
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,867
For a while, anyway,
just as before.

1003
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:31,967
Now you must just
wait and be patient.

1004
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:34,333
Wait and be patient.

1005
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,700
Wait and be patient.

1006
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,033
BERTIE: I will return
as soon as I've raised

1007
01:01:53,133 --> 01:01:55,367
enough money to keep us happy.

1008
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:58,900
my dearest sausage.

1009
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,567
Shall we go, Blunden?

1010
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:05,367
Au revior, my daughter
of a unique mother.

1011
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,667
Now, Luce!

1012
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:48,700
Sara!

1013
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,767
Sara!

1014
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,767
Sara!

1015
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:53,933
Georgie!

1016
01:02:54,033 --> 01:02:55,533
We must find them.

1017
01:02:55,633 --> 01:02:57,400
I'm sure the time is now.

1018
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,967
Blunden leaving and
Sara outside the house.

1019
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,833
It'll be soon, Lucy.

1020
01:03:01,933 --> 01:03:03,900
I know it.

1021
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,767
Perhaps Mrs. Wickens
changed her mind,

1022
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:07,800
didn't put them in the cellar.

1023
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,200
Perhaps they're in the nursery.

1024
01:03:27,667 --> 01:03:28,833
Quick, we'd better
get out of sight.

1025
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:29,733
She can't see us.

1026
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:30,733
Bella can.

1027
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:41,633
(SINGING) I'm a naughty girl,
and you're a naughty boy--

1028
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:55,333
BELLA: Now I'm doing this
secretly out of the kindness

1029
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:56,467
of me heart.

1030
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:58,133
Hurry up and drink it
or ma will catch you.

1031
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:00,467
SARA: That's very
kind of you, Bella.

1032
01:04:03,967 --> 01:04:05,467
LUCY: Get the key.

1033
01:04:05,567 --> 01:04:07,600
No. if we take it now, she'll
tell her mother it's missing.

1034
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,633
We'll have to get to
without anyone noticing.

1035
01:04:09,733 --> 01:04:13,700
Follow her when she comes out
and see that she does with it.

1036
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,067
Good night.

1037
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,967
(SINGING) I'm a naughty
girl, and you're a naughty boy.

1038
01:04:25,067 --> 01:04:30,100
It takes a naughty girl
to make a naughty boy--

1039
01:04:33,367 --> 01:04:37,833
--put them all together and
they make a naughty day.

1040
01:04:37,933 --> 01:04:38,867
Did they drink it all?

1041
01:04:38,967 --> 01:04:40,100
Yes, ma.

1042
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,700
You didn't say as
I sent it, did you?

1043
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,867
ma!

1044
01:04:42,967 --> 01:04:44,500
Yes, I told them like you said.

1045
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,100
Which was?

1046
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,700
I was doing it out
of the kindness of me

1047
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,633
heart, and that I wanted them
to get a good night's sleep.

1048
01:04:51,733 --> 01:04:53,700
Oh, they'll sleep, all right.

1049
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,733
There's my good little girl.

1050
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:59,667
Don't want them to think as
I'm getting soft, now, do I?

1051
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:02,933
Now I want you to take
this tray to the kitchen

1052
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:06,000
and wash their mugs
where very hard.

1053
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,667
Very hard.

1054
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:10,933
Don't want no sediment.

1055
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,000
Wash 'em in boiling water.

1056
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,200
Yes, mum.

1057
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,100
Do something, quick!

1058
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:40,233
Outside.

1059
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,767
I'll get into a room.

1060
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:42,967
We've got to get that key!

1061
01:06:43,067 --> 01:06:44,167
Come on!

1062
01:06:52,867 --> 01:06:54,133
MRS. WICKENS: Oh, God!

1063
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:56,267
What a .

1064
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:01,133
JAMIE: No!
Mr. Wickens!

1065
01:07:04,433 --> 01:07:05,733
Bundles of wood,
bundles of wood.

1066
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:06,633
Lucy, the fire!

1067
01:07:06,733 --> 01:07:07,700
He started it!

1068
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,600
LUCY: Oh, no!

1069
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:09,533
Come on!

1070
01:07:33,533 --> 01:07:35,033
Listen, we'll
have to separate.

1071
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:36,267
I'll get and axe and break
down the nursery door,

1072
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:38,067
but you must stay
here and warn Tom.

1073
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:40,600
His life depends on it, Luce!

1074
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,567
All right.

1075
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:54,467
LUCY: Sara!

1076
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:56,233
Georgie!

1077
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,700
- Miss Sara!
- Sara!

1078
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,833
Is she all right, missus?

1079
01:07:58,933 --> 01:07:59,867
Is she safe then?

1080
01:07:59,967 --> 01:08:01,100
They're still in the nursery.

1081
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,167
James is trying to
break down the door.

1082
01:08:03,267 --> 01:08:04,767
Tom, you mustn't!

1083
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:05,733
You'll fall!

1084
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:07,100
Tom, it isn't safe.

1085
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,800
Really, it isn't.
You're going to be killed.

1086
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,133
I know you will.

1087
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:11,167
I will be
killed, but

1088
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:12,400
a person I will gladly die for.

1089
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,600
You'll
make things worse!

1090
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,533
MR. WICKENS: Ohh!

1091
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:18,100
LUCY:

1092
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:47,700
GEORGIE: Sara!

1093
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,300
Sara, are you all right?

1094
01:09:15,867 --> 01:09:16,667
Sara?

1095
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:18,667
Sara?

1096
01:09:26,633 --> 01:09:28,933
Please, don't be dead.

1097
01:09:29,033 --> 01:09:30,233
Sara, wake up!

1098
01:09:39,567 --> 01:09:42,767
Doctor, open the
window, for pity's sake!

1099
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:43,733
Sara!

1100
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:44,667
Sara!

1101
01:09:47,967 --> 01:09:48,767
Open the window!

1102
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,400
LUCY:

1103
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,333
No!

1104
01:10:08,433 --> 01:10:09,267
Don't!

1105
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:15,033
I'm with them, Lucy!

1106
01:10:15,133 --> 01:10:17,667
I'm here!

1107
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:18,600
Where's Sara?

1108
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,900
Is she all right?

1109
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,500
They're alive but I
can't wake them up, Tom.

1110
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,400
They've been drugged.

1111
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:33,000
Come on, Sara.

1112
01:10:36,033 --> 01:10:38,500
MR. WICKENS: Uhhh!

1113
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,200
Uhhh!

1114
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,767
I'm going to kill you!

1115
01:10:41,867 --> 01:10:42,767
I will!

1116
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:46,333
Uhh!

1117
01:10:46,433 --> 01:10:47,733
I mean it!

1118
01:10:53,467 --> 01:10:54,300
Uhhh!

1119
01:11:17,033 --> 01:11:18,967
BELLA: (SINGING)
I'm a naughty girl--

1120
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:20,633
Missus, this is
no time for singing.

1121
01:11:20,733 --> 01:11:22,633
MRS. WICKENS: Wickens!

1122
01:11:22,733 --> 01:11:25,200
You've gone too far!

1123
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,467
Oh, Miss Arabella, please!

1124
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:38,267
(SINGING)

1125
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:40,067
Wickens!

1126
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:41,033
Oh, James!

1127
01:11:41,133 --> 01:11:42,600
I thought you'd never come!

1128
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,000
I've got to go back!

1129
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,567
Look after Sara!

1130
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:49,567
Come on.

1131
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:50,500
Sara?

1132
01:11:58,867 --> 01:11:59,900
Is he all right?

1133
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,900
- He's alive.
- Where's Georgie?

1134
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,500
Is he still up there?

1135
01:12:13,967 --> 01:12:15,467
Tom?

1136
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:16,467
Lucy--

1137
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:44,767
I would, by god.

1138
01:12:50,267 --> 01:12:51,333
I would, Georgie!

1139
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,267
I would.

1140
01:12:53,933 --> 01:12:54,733
James.

1141
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,167
We will go together.

1142
01:13:03,267 --> 01:13:04,767
The file will not touch you.

1143
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,333
Now is the time.

1144
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:19,533
Look straight ahead
and don't be afraid.

1145
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,900
I can't feel a thing.

1146
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,500
Nothing.

1147
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,100
Look straight ahead.

1148
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,967
Tom, where's Georgie?

1149
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:43,067
Sara?

1150
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:50,867
Sara?

1151
01:14:15,933 --> 01:14:18,833
MR. BLUNDEN
(VOICEOVER): At last.

1152
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:21,833
At last.

1153
01:14:21,933 --> 01:14:25,667
Thank you, my dears.

1154
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:29,567
Jamie!

1155
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:30,767
Georgie!

1156
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,733
Mr. Blunden, you
promised to guard them!

1157
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:34,300
You promised!

1158
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,667
Jamie!

1159
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:39,733
Lucy!

1160
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:40,633
Georgie!

1161
01:14:40,733 --> 01:14:42,033
Georgie!

1162
01:14:42,133 --> 01:14:43,233
Oh, Georgie!

1163
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,933
Georgie, oh!

1164
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:51,933
Jamie!

1165
01:14:52,033 --> 01:14:53,900
Jamie!

1166
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,500
Jamie!

1167
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,900
Jamie!

1168
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,467
Jamie!

1169
01:14:59,567 --> 01:15:00,833
Jamie?

1170
01:15:00,933 --> 01:15:03,233
You're too late, Mr. Blunden!

1171
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:06,033
You're always too late!

1172
01:15:06,133 --> 01:15:07,900
I won't go back without Jamie!

1173
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,800
I will not go without Jamie!

1174
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,367
I won't go without him!

1175
01:15:14,467 --> 01:15:17,267
I won't go without
him, do you hear?

1176
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:20,433
I won't go without Jamie!

1177
01:15:20,533 --> 01:15:22,233
Jamie!

1178
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:24,800
I won't go without Jamie!

1179
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,400
I won't go!

1180
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,167
Jamie!

1181
01:15:31,267 --> 01:15:34,367
I won't go without Jamie!

1182
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:38,800
--back without Jamie.

1183
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,733
Jamie--

1184
01:15:44,567 --> 01:15:47,400
Jamie?

1185
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,800
Jamie!

1186
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:49,733
Jamie!

1187
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,233
Jamie!

1188
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,667
Jamie!

1189
01:15:58,767 --> 01:15:59,600
Jamie?

1190
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,533
Jamie!

1191
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:06,567
Jamie!

1192
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:07,500
Jamie?

1193
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,200
Jamie?

1194
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,467
Jamie!

1195
01:16:12,567 --> 01:16:14,467
Jamie!

1196
01:16:14,567 --> 01:16:15,933
Jamie?

1197
01:16:16,033 --> 01:16:17,033
Jamie!

1198
01:16:34,733 --> 01:16:37,567
LUCY (VOICEOVER): Supposing
Sara's and Georgie's graves

1199
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:39,067
have gone.

1200
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:42,033
I can't be as silly as that.

1201
01:16:42,133 --> 01:16:44,600
I can't really go
wandering around expecting

1202
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,967
to find a yawning hole
surrounded by a crowd

1203
01:16:48,067 --> 01:16:50,767
of astonished villagers.

1204
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:53,833
(TOGETHER) Ohhh!

1205
01:16:53,933 --> 01:16:55,033
LUCY (VOICEOVER):
And yet if it is all

1206
01:16:55,133 --> 01:16:59,600
the same, what does it mean?

1207
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,100
Did we dream it?

1208
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,733
Where is James, then?

1209
01:17:31,533 --> 01:17:36,867
"The good shepherd giveth
his life for his sheep."

1210
01:17:40,267 --> 01:17:48,767
"Frederick Percival Blunden
gave his life to save

1211
01:17:48,867 --> 01:17:53,133
the children in his care."

1212
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:58,033
April the 21st, 1818.

1213
01:17:58,133 --> 01:18:00,600
Yesterday.

1214
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,367
A hundred years ago.

1215
01:18:05,467 --> 01:18:08,333
We did it.

1216
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:09,733
Jamie did it.

1217
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:17,733
Lucy!

1218
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:19,100
He's awake!

1219
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,100
Jamie's awake!

1220
01:18:38,267 --> 01:18:40,333
And then he suddenly woke
up, and of all things,

1221
01:18:40,433 --> 01:18:41,733
he wanted something to eat.

1222
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,533
But I think he was a bit
confused because he said,

1223
01:18:43,633 --> 01:18:46,067
sorry, I got held up, as if he'd
been on a journey or something.

1224
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:47,200
Can I go up and see him?

1225
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,967
Yes, of course
you can, darling.

1226
01:18:50,067 --> 01:18:51,300
Mommy, I do love you.

1227
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,667
Are you all right?

1228
01:18:58,767 --> 01:18:59,767
Well, of course.

1229
01:18:59,867 --> 01:19:00,700
Are you?

1230
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,767
Where have you been, then?

1231
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:07,400
Been?

1232
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,133
Yes, been, James.

1233
01:19:08,233 --> 01:19:10,633
Where have you been?

1234
01:19:10,733 --> 01:19:12,567
You know very well.

1235
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:15,600
Where have we been?

1236
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,733
You remember, then?

1237
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:20,433
Well, do you?

1238
01:19:20,533 --> 01:19:21,533
Lucy, did we?

1239
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:22,533
Did we?

1240
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:23,800
Yes, Jamie.

1241
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:25,567
I went to the churchyard,
and the children's graves

1242
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:26,767
have gone.

1243
01:19:26,867 --> 01:19:27,767
We did it, Jamie!

1244
01:19:27,867 --> 01:19:29,567
You did it!

1245
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:30,967
You helped.

1246
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:31,967
A bit.

1247
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:53,833
JAMIE: Clutterbuck.

1248
01:19:53,933 --> 01:19:54,800
Trouble.

1249
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,300
Camden Town, here we come.

1250
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,500
It's all right, darlings.

1251
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,133
I've had a letter,
and it's private.

1252
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,433
Cheerio, swans.

1253
01:20:09,267 --> 01:20:10,867
Where have you been hiding?

1254
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:12,500
Has he finished yet?

1255
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,500
In the attic.

1256
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,567
No, I don't think so.

1257
01:20:17,667 --> 01:20:19,267
You know that blue vase?

1258
01:20:19,367 --> 01:20:20,600
Yes.

1259
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,667
Remember I nearly smashed
it when you were trying to get

1260
01:20:22,767 --> 01:20:23,900
the keys from Mrs. Wickns?

1261
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,600
Only I couldn't do it.

1262
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:31,433
Strange to think of it
being here all this time.

1263
01:20:31,533 --> 01:20:34,267
Probably here before
Sara and Georgie.

1264
01:20:34,367 --> 01:20:38,000
It'll probably be here
long after we've left.

1265
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,533
Probably.

1266
01:20:39,633 --> 01:20:40,767
Doesn't really seem fair.

1267
01:20:40,867 --> 01:20:42,633
MRS. ALLEN: James!

1268
01:20:42,733 --> 01:20:43,600
Lucy!

1269
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,900
Come on.

1270
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,467
What does he want?

1271
01:20:51,567 --> 01:20:52,400
I don't know.

1272
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,300
He looks pretty
nervous, as usual.

1273
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,367
Mr. Clutterbuck, you
know James and Lucy.

1274
01:20:58,467 --> 01:20:59,267
Hello, again.

1275
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:04,600
Well?
When do we go?

1276
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,633
Go?

1277
01:21:05,733 --> 01:21:06,833
Yes, go.

1278
01:21:06,933 --> 01:21:07,933
Back to Camden Town.

1279
01:21:08,033 --> 01:21:08,933
When?

1280
01:21:09,033 --> 01:21:10,333
We don't have to go, Jamie.

1281
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:13,300
Briefly, our Mr. Blunden,
for some unknown reason,

1282
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,967
raised himself from his
bed of mental misery,

1283
01:21:16,067 --> 01:21:18,567
hurled himself as best
he could last Thursday--

1284
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:20,800
4:30, it was-- into
the office and said,

1285
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:24,900
"Get them papers on the marriage
of Miss Sara and Master Tom."

1286
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,667
So I did as I was
told, him being

1287
01:21:27,767 --> 01:21:32,200
the governor, balmy or
not, and here they are.

1288
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,533
It seems that we're
related to these people.

1289
01:21:34,633 --> 01:21:37,600
They were great
grandparents of daddy's.

1290
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,867
Just over 100 years
ago, they lived here,

1291
01:21:39,967 --> 01:21:41,900
and then they went to America.

1292
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,900
Not over 100 years ago.

1293
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,933
Exactly 100 years
ago, Mrs. Allen.

1294
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:50,967
New York, America, 1825.

1295
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:53,300
Sara Latimer of Langley
Park married a Thomas

1296
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,033
Mortimer, a gardener by trade.

1297
01:21:56,133 --> 01:21:59,767
Out of
his class he was.

1298
01:21:59,867 --> 01:22:01,200
Mr. Clutterbuck
has come to tell us

1299
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,667
that we are the legal owners
not only of the cottage,

1300
01:22:03,767 --> 01:22:05,300
but of the house itself.

1301
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,700
We can stay.

1302
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,733
Plus an allowance of 500 pounds
a year to keep us in comfort.

1303
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:11,400
In perpetuity.

1304
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,767
In what?

1305
01:22:12,867 --> 01:22:15,167
For your lifetime, sonny Jim.

1306
01:22:15,267 --> 01:22:17,200
I won't go into all
the legal logistics.

1307
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,167
You wouldn't understand.

1308
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,967
Step this way if you please.

1309
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:23,767
All will be revealed.

1310
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:30,567
Sara.

1311
01:22:30,667 --> 01:22:31,500
Tom.

1312
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,800
I know.

1313
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:37,000
Great grandma Sara.

1314
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,567
Great grandpa Tom.

1315
01:22:49,867 --> 01:22:52,333
LUCY: Mr. Blunden.

1316
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:53,800
Mr. Blunden.

1317
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,867
Mr. Blunden.

1318
01:22:55,967 --> 01:22:57,667
Which one?

1319
01:22:57,767 --> 01:22:58,600
Which one?

1320
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,867
(TOGETHER) It's ours!

1321
01:23:06,967 --> 01:23:07,867
It's ours, Benji.

1322
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:09,400
It's really ours.

1323
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,633
JAMIE: It's ours!

1324
01:23:12,733 --> 01:23:13,533
LUCY: It's ours!

1325
01:23:13,633 --> 01:23:14,700
JAMIE: It's ours!
