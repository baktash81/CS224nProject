00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,368
They travel a lot though, huh?

350
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,702
Mostly, Europe.

351
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:21,663
For like fun?

352
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,415
Work.

353
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,042
Do they send people
to spy on you

354
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:29,337
or they trust you just to not
throw a bunch of ragers.

355
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:36,177
I mean, they know I'm not
like a rager person, so.

356
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,055
Who do you hang out
with at school?

357
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,140
Like...

358
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,561
Like different people.

359
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:47,438
Like a bunch
of different people, so.

360
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,067
I'm gone a lot with dance.

361
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,236
How often do you dance?

362
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:55,738
Every day.

363
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,073
Like classes?

364
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:58,324
Mmm-hmm.

365
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,579
But I haven't gone

366
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,415
since the thing.

367
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,090
Are your parents chill?

368
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,304
My dad more than my mom,
for sure.

369
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,724
- My mom's like very white and anxious.
- [chuckles]

370
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:26,603
I don't really tell 'em
anything though, 'cause like

371
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,354
they worry.

372
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,068
I feel kinda bad for it.
They're actually really good parents.

373
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,908
[Joe] <i>I see you're packing</i>
<i>for a trip.</i>

374
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,243
<i>What's your favorite
country to visit?</i>

375
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,536
<i>Paris.</i>

376
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,330
[Joe] What's the last country
you visited?

377
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,748
<i>Europe.</i>

378
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,333
[Joe] <i>What country</i>
<i>do you wish to visit?</i>

379
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,542
[John] <i>Persia.</i>

380
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:53,838
[Joe] <i>What's the weirdest word</i>
<i>in the English language?</i>

381
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,215
[John] <i>Moist. Yuck.</i>

382
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,675
[Joe] <i>When was</i>
<i>the last time you cried?</i>

383
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:02,680
Can you stay?

384
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,976
It's late.

385
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:09,604
Just till I fall asleep.

386
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,109
Okay.

387
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,195
Thanks.

388
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,327
[Joe] <i>What's your</i>
<i>favorite movie?</i>

389
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,370
[John] <i>Mmm, Pizza.</i>

390
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,288
[Joe] <i>Favorite TV show?</i>

391
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,499
[John] <i>Um, I would have to
say my pilot with Kate Berlant</i>

392
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,459
<i>that was passed on by every major
network and streaming platform.</i>

393
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,628
<i>Meanwhile, rapists everywhere
continue to freely make up 10.</i>

394
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,962
[Nick] <i>What up, bitch?</i>

395
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,215
Dude, I'm so sorry I missed
the march.

396
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,468
I mean, it's fine.
I was just, like, legit worried about you.

397
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,345
<i>It was cool, though.
They let me speak.</i>

398
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:45,223
I wish you'd been there,
but it's fine, I'll send you a link.

399
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,850
I know, I'm sorry.
I just...

400
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,561
It's a long story,
but I ended up goin' to Mia's house and...

401
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,522
Wait, lol, Mia Reed?

402
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,524
What?

403
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,942
[Vada] <i>Yeah.</i>

404
00:28:56,025 --> 00:29:00,321
She... She's just been alone
and I feel bad.

405
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,367
- So I just...
- No, no, no, I mean, it's fine. It's just like random.

406
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,618
Is she okay?

407
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,161
[Vada] <i>I mean, she will be.</i>

408
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,373
Are you okay?

409
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:11,416
Yeah.

410
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,459
Just tired.

411
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,173
[Nick on video] <i>We wanna know
how a 16-year-old can have access</i>

412
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,593
<i>to a military assault rifle
and that's considered okay?</i>

413
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,595
- <i>It's not okay!</i>
- [people cheering on video]

414
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,472
<i>We want change.</i>

415
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,642
<i>We deserve to feel safe going
to our own school every day...</i>

416
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,241
[gasps]

417
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:47,452
[panting]

418
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,127
It feels like so soon.
It's been like two weeks.

419
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,545
[Nick] <i>No, I hear you.</i>

420
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,255
<i>It's... It's intense,
but I just...</i>

421
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:02,008
<i>I don't want us to be ruled
by fear, you know?</i>

422
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,926
<i>I feel like it'll be less scary
if we were together.</i>

423
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,178
I gotta go.

424
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,262
[Nick]
Okay, love you. Call me later.

425
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:07,805
Hey! Honey, can I come in?

426
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,099
You don't have to ask
to come in, Mom.

427
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,643
Okay.

428
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,731
So it sounds like Nick's going
back today, huh?

429
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:19,984
Yup. He is.

430
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:21,986
Well...

431
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:23,946
Well, as long
as you wanna stay home,

432
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,326
you know,
your dad and I support that.

433
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,368
Thank you.

434
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,000
There's just one thing.

435
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:44,467
[Anna] Were you tired a lot
before the incident?

436
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,261
[chuckles]

437
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,846
LOL.

438
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,600
You called it "the incident".

439
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,936
Um...

440
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,647
No, I guess I'm just
always tired.

441
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,899
I mean, I guess, that's what
caffeine is for.

442
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,192
Right?

443
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,196
What do you do
when you get tired?

444
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,740
Sleep for like
14 hours straight.

445
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,117
Ooh, I really like watching
early seasons

446
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,244
of the <i>Kardashians.</i>

447
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,079
The OG Hidden Hills shit.

448
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,207
That is my vibe!

449
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,551
What's this, you're just
gonna fax that to my mom or...

450
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,970
- Fax?
- [Vada] Yes. Fax.

451
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,514
What are you, a time traveler
from the '80s?

452
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:33,099
[laughs]

453
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:36,644
I mean, I had my suspicions
when I saw those sneakers,

454
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:39,230
but now I'm pretty convinced.

455
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:41,107
Touche.

456
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,150
Touche.

457
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,821
Look, I know this whole
therapy thing is weird

458
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,322
and can be uncomfortable.

459
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,449
But everything that you say
in here is confidential.

460
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,452
And, side note, I actually do
really like your shoes.

461
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,371
They're very cool.

462
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:58,040
No, I know. Thank you.

463
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,627
Are there things that you don't
feel comfortable talking

464
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,381
to your parents about that
maybe you wanna share with me?

465
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:12,430
Yeah.

466
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,434
My porn addiction.

467
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,352
Okay.

468
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,898
I'm so sorry. I'm...

469
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,482
[laughs] When I get nervous,

470
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,776
I make really inappropriate
jokes, so, my bad.

471
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,904
You don't have to be sorry.

472
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,655
And you don't
have to be nervous.

473
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,660
Well, I know that my parents
are worried about me

474
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,996
and they think I need help.

475
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,874
But I get it,
and that's fine,

476
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,460
but I personally am fine.

477
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:46,172
Like I feel like I'm really
good at managing my emotions.

478
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,298
It's...

479
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,092
What do you mean by that?

480
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,971
I'm just very chill.

481
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,140
Like a very low-key person.

482
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:59,894
So when it comes to emotional
stuff or drama I'm like

483
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:03,272
"Okay, is this
really productive?"

484
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,859
Yeah. I get it.

485
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,070
But you know, just because...

486
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,573
It doesn't necessarily mean
that someone's being dramatic

487
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,992
because they're emotional.

488
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,452
You know, for a lot of people,

489
00:33:16,535 --> 00:33:18,037
they need to fully experience
their emotions,

490
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,373
in order to process
what they've been through,

491
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,667
so that they can begin to heal.

492
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,419
It's actually really healthy
to show your emotion.

493
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,012
I know most people
come in here crying

494
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,681
about their cheating husbands.

495
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,724
Vada, I wanna talk about you.

496
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:42,353
I wanna know how that
shooting at your school

497
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:43,813
has made you feel.

498
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,986
I feel...

499
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,115
[sighs]

500
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,035
It's okay.

501
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,453
I mean, it makes sense.

502
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,334
I want you to track
how you're feeling

503
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,628
using this worksheet.

504
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,547
So there's questions on there
that'll guide you.

505
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,048
You don't have to overthink it,

506
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,925
it's just basically there to
hold space for you to...

507
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,470
To understand whatever
emotions may come up.

508
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,765
All you have to do
is try and feel.

509
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,975
That's it.

510
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:23,102
No matter what
those feelings are.

511
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:26,439
Then you can bring it back next
session and we'll go through it.

512
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,315
Or you know,
you can fax it to me!

513
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,567
If that's easier for you.

514
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,825
[Patricia] She said you were incredibly
bright, and smart, and funny.

515
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:40,202
[Veda] Wait,
is she in love with me?

516
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,079
Oh, what's the point of
goin' to therapy,

517
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,248
if they're just gonna tell their
parents everything they said after?

518
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,958
Honey, she didn't
tell me anything.

519
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,252
She gave me a general assessment
of how the session went.

520
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,296
- That's all.
- [Amelia] She thought you were doing really well,

521
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,756
considering what you

01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:13,336
Let's say this.
Let's say you die tomorrow.

1037
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,296
Okay?

1038
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:18,674
And what if you die sad, 'cause you
regret not saying what you wanted to say?

1039
01:01:21,093 --> 01:01:22,345
Then what?

1040
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:33,314
I can't say it.

1041
01:01:33,397 --> 01:01:34,857
Why?

1042
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:11,268
Is this okay?

1043
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:23,280
[somber music playing]

1044
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:14,165
[coughing]

1045
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:36,979
[Carlos] Where have you been?

1046
01:03:37,062 --> 01:03:38,939
We've been freaking out!

1047
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,483
I was at Nick's.

1048
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,527
Nick's been calling all morning
wondering where you are.

1049
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,157
Vada, your phone was dead.

1050
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,575
We didn't know if something
terrible had happened to you or...

1051
01:03:49,658 --> 01:03:53,204
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

1052
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,539
The perfect child
tells a fat one.

1053
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,500
She better lose screen time
for that one, Dad.

1054
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,251
[Carlos] Vada, come back here!

1055
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,420
Vada!

1056
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,965
I told you,
you don't have to know!

1057
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,759
- Vada
- Vada, don't be rude.

1058
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:09,011
Vada, what were you doing
last night?

1059
01:04:09,094 --> 01:04:11,472
Nothing, Jesus!

1060
01:04:11,555 --> 01:04:13,182
Are you...
Are you seeing someone?

1061
01:04:13,265 --> 01:04:15,643
LOL, seeing someone. No!

1062
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,853
Uh, I'll do it...
I'll do it.

1063
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,943
If you're gonna be
spending the night

1064
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,152
at someone's house, Vada...

1065
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,322
[squeals] I'm not
having sex, Mom!

1066
01:04:28,405 --> 01:04:30,574
- Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1067
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,117
What are you doing?

1068
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,709
Last night, I slept over
at my friend Mia's house

1069
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,920
- and I got drunk.
- You got drunk?

1070
01:04:43,003 --> 01:04:45,589
Yeah, Mom, I got drunk.

1071
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,509
I am 16 years old
and I drink alcohol,

1072
01:04:48,592 --> 01:04:50,928
and here's the thing,
I don't even like drinking.

1073
01:04:51,011 --> 01:04:53,222
I was just tryin' to live
in the moment,

1074
01:04:53,305 --> 01:04:56,517
and feel shit, and YOLO
or something, okay?

1075
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:08,112
[burps] Now if you excuse me,
I am hungover as shit

1076
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,072
and I'm gonna go barf
in the shower.

1077
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,660
Who's Mia?

1078
01:05:14,743 --> 01:05:16,203
Who's Mia?

1079
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,385
I'm not even tryin' to be rude,
I'm just...

1080
01:05:31,468 --> 01:05:33,387
I'm super busy
and I don't have the time.

1081
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:34,847
So.

1082
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,182
Okay.

1083
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,605
I'm sorry
I never called you back,

1084
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,316
but you didn't have
to get me in trouble, dude.

1085
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:47,318
Vada, I was just
worried about you.

1086
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,569
When I didn't hear back
from you,

1087
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:49,987
I felt like I had to call
your mom,

1088
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,405
'cause the last time
I had seen you,

1089
01:05:51,488 --> 01:05:53,866
you had literally done drugs
at school.

1090
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,409
So I was like, "Okay, cool.

1091
01:05:55,492 --> 01:05:58,454
Maybe she's like having
a serotonin drop from hell

1092
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:02,708
and she's like suicidal
on a bridge somewhere and...

1093
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,960
Then to hear like how freaked
your family was all night,

1094
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,420
I just...

1095
01:06:06,503 --> 01:06:08,297
I don't know, I hoped that

1096
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:10,466
whatever you went and did was worth
everything you put them through.

1097
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,301
But, you know what?

1098
01:06:12,384 --> 01:06:14,136
I'm guessing uh, it's more likely
you were with Mia Reed somewhere,

1099
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:16,138
acting like nothing happened.

1100
01:06:16,221 --> 01:06:19,141
Why're you being like this?

1101
01:06:19,224 --> 01:06:21,769
Because I've
waited for you, Vada.

1102
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:26,690
For a month,
I've given you space and love to heal.

1103
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,651
But I've been dealing with this
my own way!

1104
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,820
You haven't dealt with
anything, that's the problem!

1105
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,073
All I wanna do is try
my hardest to stop this

1106
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,491
from ever happening again.

1107
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:39,703
Like why is that so hard
for you to understand?

1108
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,997
That's not fucking fair, Nick.

1109
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,333
None of this is fair, Vada.

1110
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,714
Yeah, yeah.
Mmm-hmm, go be with Mia.

1111
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,133
She's gonna save the world
with her hot ass.

1112
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,510
Fuck you, Nick.

1113
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:55,511
Wow.

1114
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,347
Nice.

1115
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,520
He's just hurtin',
I think we all are.

1116
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:08,816
He was so cruel about it!

1117
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:11,694
Yeah, but you know,
he's under a lot of pressure.

1118
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,153
He has to be the face of this,

1119
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:17,700
just act brave, but, well,
he's scared, too.

1120
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,535
You know,
fear makes people act crazy.

1121
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,831
Okay, I...

1122
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,791
Like I'm sorry for like

1123
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:28,252
calling you and dumping
all of this on you,

1124
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:32,297
especially, because it's
been the hardest on you.

1125
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,924
It's hard on everyone.

1126
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:40,639
I think for me, you know,
when it hurts too much,

1127
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:44,810
I think about
how this can't be for nothing.

1128
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:46,937
Like, oh, we won't even let
this be for not... Like, it...

1129
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,647
It can't be for nothing,
you know?

1130
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,941
Fuck. Yeah.

1131
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,532
Tell me about your brother.

1132
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,247
I just wanna know
more about him.

1133
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:13,130
He was, uh, real quiet

1134
01:08:13,213 --> 01:08:14,548
when you first met him.

1135
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:18,635
He watched everything now,
you know.

1136
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,095
Like, he'd be like,

1137
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,764
"Oh, that girl is gonna go home
with that guy

1138
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,891
and that guy is gonna go home
with that girl and..."

1139
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,977
Like, he was always right.

1140
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,063
He was funny.

1141
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:31,899
Like always making me laugh.

1142
01:08:36,528 --> 01:08:37,821
He, uh...

1143
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:41,575
He sounds dope.

1144
01:08:47,664 --> 01:08:49,958
I feel him.

1145
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:53,962
Now I know this sounds crazy
to say like...

1146
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:57,382
I just...
I know he's still with me.

1147
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,468
He's not gonna let me
go back and be sad,

1148
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:02,805
he's not gonna let me go
forward and freak out.

1149
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,724
He keeps me here.

1150
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,726
He keeps me calm.

1151
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:12,898
I think he's definitely
still here.

1152
01:09:14,691 --> 01:09:16,860
Lot of people
don't ask me about him.

1153
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:21,031
They think I'mma like
cry or somethin'.

1154
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:24,493
Um, well, thank you.

1155
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:32,292
You can always talk
about him around me.

1156
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:40,634
[somber music playing]

1157
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:51,687
Wait, wait.
I'm sorry, I...

1158
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,022
What's wrong?

1159
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:57,276
I'm just going through a lot
right now, it's just...

1160
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,028
I just don't know if I'm in
the right headspace right now.

1161
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,575
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

1162
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,618
- I am so sorry!
- No, you're okay.

1163
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,412
I'm... No, of course, you are.
I'm so sorry.

1164
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,289
You're perfect, I like you,
it's just...

1165
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,623
- I'm so sorry.
- V, I swear, you didn't do anything wrong.

1166
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,125
I am so sorry, okay?

1167
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,877
No, don't be sorry, it's...
It's not like that.

1168
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,170
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

1169
01:10:19,756 --> 01:10:20,841
[sobbing]

1170
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:50,454
I can't sleep.

1171
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:05,052
You know, I can always see
where you are on Find A Friend

1172
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:07,054
when your phone isn't dead.

1173
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:09,473
You better delete me
off of that.

1174
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:10,849
Like tomorrow,

1175
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,768
so I don't tell Mom
about your Finsta.

1176
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,061
Fine!

1177
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,439
Why do you care where I am?

1178
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,690
I don't.

1179
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:24,488
You're always at a house
in North Bay.

1180
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:25,656
Why?

1181
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:27,908
It's where my friend Mia lives.

1182
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:29,159
Hmm.

1183
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:40,963
V, I'm scared.

1184
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,589
Of what?

1185
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,928
What if...

1186
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:56,728
What if a shooter comes
to my school next?

1187
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:00,148
It won't happen.

1188
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,733
How do you know?

1189
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:14,037
Sorry, I almost got you
killed in a shooting.

1190
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,212
What're you talking about?

1191
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,631
If I hadn't texted you
about my stupid period,

1192
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,925
you wouldn't have
left the classroom.

1193
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,553
You would've been safe.

1194
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,055
- You could've died.
- That's not true.

1195
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,473
Yes, it is!

1196
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:34,725
Quinton's brother died,
'cause he was walking

1197
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,476
in the same hallway.

1198
01:12:40,063 --> 01:12:42,524
It wasn't safe anywhere

1199
01:12:42,607 --> 01:12:44,359
Definitely wasn't your fault.

1200
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:48,780
Then why have you been
so mad at me?

1201
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,450
I haven't been mad at you.

1202
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,118
Why do you keep thinking that?

1203
01:12:53,201 --> 01:12:55,037
Because...

1204
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:58,749
You're never home anymore.

1205
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:00,667
You never talk to me.

1206

Can I tell you something that
I've not told anybody before?

really thought
I was gonna die.

1214
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,294
And it was
the scariest moment of my life.

And the only person
I could think of was you.

Do you remember when I sent you
that "I love you, too"?

1217
01:13:56,681 --> 01:13:58,642
