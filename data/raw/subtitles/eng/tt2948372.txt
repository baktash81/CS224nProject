1
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:37,826
All right, let's try somethin' else.

2
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:45,209
From the top.
Ready. One, two, three.

3
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:57,179
One, two, three, four.

4
00:00:57,263 --> 00:00:59,807
Stay on the beat.

5
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:01,892
Two, three, four.

6
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,232
That's C-sharp, horns.

7
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:12,069
Two, three...
I see you, Caleb.

8
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:14,822
Rachel, now you.

9
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,283
Forgot my sax, Mr. G.

10
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:21,829
Okay, she forgot her sax.
And now, all you, Connie.

11
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:23,080
Go for it!

12
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:40,764
Way to go!

13
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:47,688
Hang on, hang on.
What are y'all laughing at?

14
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:49,607
So Connie got a little lost in it.

15
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,233
That's a good thing.

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,902
Look, I remember one time

17
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:54,862
my dad took me to this jazz club,

18
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,572
and that's the last place I wanted to be.

19
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:57,865
But then I see this guy,

20
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:01,619
and he's playing these chords
with fourths on it,

21
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:03,204
and then with the minor...

22
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:04,788
Whoo.

23
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:07,583
Then he adds the inner voices,
and it's like he's...

24
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,918
It's like he's singing.

25
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:12,713
And I swear, the next thing I know...

26
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:16,050
...it's like he floats off the stage.

27
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:18,886
That guy was lost in the music.

28
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,348
He was in it, and he took
the rest of us with him.

29
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,397
And I wanted to learn...

30
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:33,192
...how to talk like that.

31
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:35,611
That's when I knew...

32
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:40,866
I was born to play.

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,454
Connie knows what I mean.
Right, Connie?

34
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:46,956
I'm 12.

35
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:52,086
I'll be right back.
Practice your scales.

36
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:54,129
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Gardner.

37
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:56,507
You're doing my ears a favor.

38
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:59,009
-Hey!
-Not you, though, you're good.

39
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:00,344
He's not.

40
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:02,012
What can I do for you, Principal Arroyo?

41
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:04,974
I wanted to deliver
the good news personally.

42
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,226
No more part-time for you.

43
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:10,354
You're now our full-time band teacher.

44
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:11,605
Job security.

45
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,607
Medical insurance. Pension.

46
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,985
Wow. That's, great.

47
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:20,739
Welcome to the M.S. 70 family, Joe.
Permanently.

48
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:22,741
Thanks.

49
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:39,717
After all these years,
my prayers have been answered.

50
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:41,927
A full-time job.

51
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,387
Working man, coming through.

52
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,471
Yeah, Mom, but I...

53
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:46,390
You're going to tell them yes, right?

54
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:47,641
Don't worry, Mom, I got a plan.

55
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:49,059
You always got a plan.

56
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:51,061
Maybe you need to have a backup plan, too,

57
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:52,938
for when your plan falls through.

58
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:54,481
A backup plan never hurts.

59
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:57,151
Joey, we didn't struggle
giving you an education

60
00:03:57,318 --> 00:03:58,903
so you could be a middle-aged man

61
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:00,571
washing your underwear in my shop.

62
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:02,531
Walking around with a hole in his pants.

63
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:04,450
-Yeah, but...
-With this job, you'll be able

64
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:06,619
to put that dead-end gigging behind you.

65
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:09,413
And Lord knows we need
more teachers in this world.

66
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,581
And just think,

67
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:14,835
playing music will finally
be your real career.

68
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,963
So you're going to tell them yes, right?

69
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,381
Please say yes.

70
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:21,091
Yeah, definitely.

71
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:22,259
Good.

72
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:29,099
Hello?

73
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:30,184
How you been, Mr. G?

74
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,895
It's Curley. Lamont.
Lamont Baker.

75
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:36,065
Hey, Curley!
Hey, good to hear your voice, man.

76
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:38,526
Listen.
You can call me Joe now, Curley.

77
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:39,610
I'm not your teacher anymore.

78
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:40,945
Okay, Mr. Gardner.

79
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:44,031
Hey, look, I'm the new drummer
in the Dorothea Williams Quartet,

80
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:47,117
and we're kickin' off our tour
with a show at The Half Note tonight.

81
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:48,619
Dorothea Williams!
Are you kidding me?

82
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:51,205
Are you kidding me?
Congratulations, man. Wow!

83
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,666
I would die a happy man

84
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:56,252
if I could perform with Dorothea Williams.

85
00:04:56,335 --> 00:04:58,796
Well,
this could be your lucky day.

86
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,360
- There he is.
- Hey, Curley.

87
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:23,529
Leon skipping town
really put us in a bind, man.

88
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:25,281
- Yeah. I'll bet.
- I'm glad you made it.

89
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:28,617
My boy, Bishop, said he sat in with you
on a set last year in Brooklyn.

90
00:05:28,784 --> 00:05:29,827
Said you were great.

91
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,288
Well, you know,
for a coffee shop.

92
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:00,232
Hey, Dorothea.

93
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,860
This is the cat I was telling you about.

94
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:05,321
My old middle school band teacher,
Mr. Gardner.

95
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:06,822
Call me Joe, Dorothea.

96
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:08,866
I mean, Miss Williams.

97
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,493
It's a pleasure. Wow.
This is amazing.

98
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:15,122
Joe is Ray Gardner's son.

99
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,127
So, we're down to
middle school band teachers now.

100
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:25,925
Get on up here, Teach,
we ain't got all day.

101
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,766
What... What are we playin'?

102
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,666
Sorry.

103
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,211
I zoned out a little back there.

104
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:29,131
Joe Gardner, where have you been?

105
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:32,092
I've been, teaching,
middle school band.

106
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:33,427
But on the weekends, I...

107
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:35,012
You got a suit?

108
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,389
Get a suit, Teach.
A good suit.

109
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:39,558
Back here tonight.
First show's at 9:00.

110
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:40,726
Soundcheck's at 7:00.

111
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:42,478
We'll see how you do.

112
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:47,816
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

113
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:50,986
You see that, Dad?
That's what I'm talking about!

114
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:52,154
Hey, look up, look up.

115
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:54,490
You know what that's gonna say?
Joe Gardner!

116
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:57,493
You're never gonna believe
what just happened.

117
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:59,912
I did it. I got the gig. Yes!

118
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:00,996
I... I know.

119
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,790
Dorothea Williams!
Can you believe it?

120
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:04,625
Hey, pal, you're gonna get hurt!

121
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,378
Just don't tell my mom about this. Okay?

122
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,130
Forget class. I'm in a different class.

123
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:12,132
I'm in a Dorothea Williams class, buddy.

124
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:13,384
You know what I'm saying? I'm...

125
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:14,844
Whoa! Sorry!

126
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:33,904
What the...

127
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:43,163
Hello?

128
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:46,417
Hello?

129
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,555
What the...

130
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,478
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hello!

131
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,356
Hello.

132
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,317
What's your name, honey?

133
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,902
I'm Joe. Joe Gardner.

134
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:15,237
Look, I'm not supposed to be here.

135
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:18,240
Must have been sudden for you.

136
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:21,452
You see, Joe, I'm 106 years old.

137
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:24,246
Been waiting a long time for this.

138
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:27,583
-For what?
-The Great Beyond.

139
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,587
The Great Beyond?

140
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:34,590
-As in, as in beyond life?
-Yeah.

141
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:36,175
That's death right there?

142
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:39,887
Exciting, isn't it?

143
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:41,305
No, no, no, listen.

144
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:42,973
I have a gig tonight.
I can't die now.

145
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:44,642
Well, I really don't think

146
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:46,101
you have a lot to say about this.

147
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,728
Yes. Yes, I do.

148
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:50,940
I'm not dying the very day
I got my shot. I'm due.

149
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:52,399
Heck, I'm overdue.

150
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:53,609
I'm outta here.

151
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:57,029
I don't think you're supposed
to go that way.

152
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:58,781
This can't happen.
I'm not dyin' today.

153
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:00,908
Not when my life just started.

154
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:10,793
What was that?

155
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:13,379
Wait. I'm not finished.
I gotta get back.

156
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:14,713
I don't wanna die!

157
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,966
I'm not done.
I'm not done. Run!

158
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:18,968
-Why aren't you running?
-I don't know.

159
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:20,761
- What's wrong with you people?
- I don't know.

160
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,434
I'm not done.

161
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:36,318
My goodness.
My goodness.

162
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:38,153
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

163
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:42,950
Help! I'm not done.
I gotta get back.

164
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,746
My... My goodness.

165
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,080
What?

166
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,711
Now, now, everyone,

167
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:19,296
let's give the mentor some room.

168
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:22,132
Sorry, new souls.
37, that's enough.

169
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,178
- Hey, everyone, look here.
- Quiet coyote.

170
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:28,556
Shh. Quiet coyote.

171
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,391
Who... Who are you?

172
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:31,851
I am the coming together

173
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:34,395
of all quantized fields of the universe.

174
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,731
Appearing in a form
your feeble human brain can comprehend.

175
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:39,441
-What?
-You can call me Jerry.

176
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:41,318
Jerry, okay.

177
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:43,737
Hey, is this heaven?

178
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:45,614
No.

179
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:49,243
Is it H-E-double hockey sticks?

180
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,872
- Hell.
- Hell, hell, hell.

181
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:54,999
- Shh. Quiet coyote.
- Hell.

182
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:56,792
It's easy to get turned around.

183
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,253
This isn't the Great Beyond.
It's the Great Before.

184
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:01,505
The Great Before?

185
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:05,009
We call it the You Seminar now.
Rebranding.

186
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:08,804
Hell.

187
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:09,889
No, no. You're here!

188
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:17,980
Does this mean I'm dead?

189
00:14:18,063 --> 00:14:19,106
Not yet.

190
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,066
Your body's in a holding pattern.

191
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,234
It's complicated.

192
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:23,819
I'll get you back to your group.

193
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:33,454
Come on, little souls, get on up here.

194
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:38,626
Welcome to the You Seminar.

195
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:42,671
You are in for a treat.

196
00:14:54,808 --> 00:14:56,852
- That's weird.
- What is it?

197
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:58,854
-The count's off.
-Excuse me?

198
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:03,400
There's a soul missing.
The count's off.

199
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:09,990
Okay, first stop
is the Excitable Pavilion.

200
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:11,825
You four. In you go.

201
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:24,505
You five, you'll be aloof.
And you two, why not?

202
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:29,969
Wait a minute.

203
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:31,720
This is where personalities come from?

204
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,598
Of course. Do you think people
are just born with them?

205
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,522
So, how do they get to Earth, then?

206
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,691
Well, they use the Earth portal.

207
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:52,032
Once they get a complete personality,
of course.

208
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,451
Hello? Hello?

209
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:06,714
Goodbye.

210
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:14,013
Whee!

211
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:16,807
Whoo-hoo!

212
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,020
Wait, wait, wait.

213
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,962
You sure get lost a lot.

214
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,298
All righty, mentors.

215
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:50,841
-Just find your name here...
-Hello, Jerry...

216
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:51,926
...and join us inside.

217
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,010
...got a lost mentor for you.

218
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:54,220
Thanks, Jerry.

219
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:56,847
Look, I'm not sure
I'm supposed to be here.

220
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:58,182
I understand.

221
00:16:58,265 --> 00:16:59,683
Mentoring isn't for everyone.

222
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,101
You're more than welcome to opt out.

223
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:03,479
Actually, on second thought,

224
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:06,732
you know, the mentoring sounds like fun.

225
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:09,109
I'm glad to hear it.
Jerry will take it from here.

226
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:11,904
Thanks, Jerry.
Head right on over there to Jerry.

227
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:13,072
Thank you, Jerry.

228
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:14,323
Is everyone here named Jerry?

229
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:15,449
Good luck!

230
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,368
Jerry, we've got a problem.

231
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:18,827
Hello, there, Terry.

232
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,538
The count's off.

233
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:22,456
I seriously doubt that.

234
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,208
The count hasn't been off in centuries.

235
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,795
151,000 souls go into
the Great Beyond every day.

236
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:30,798
That's 105.2 souls per minute, Jerry.

237
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:33,259
1.75 souls per second.

238
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,386
And I count every single one of 'em.

239
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:36,554
Yep. I'm aware.

240
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:39,390
It's my job to keep track
of this stuff, Jerry.

241
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:40,766
I'm the accountant.

242
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,893
And we all think
you're doing a wonderful job,

243
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,395
-don't we, everyone?
-Absolutely.

244
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:45,479
Looks good from where this guy's standing.

245
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:46,564
I'd say no.

246
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,316
I'm always counting.
I'm counting right now.

247
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:52,278
You blinked five times
since I started talking. Six.

248
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:54,446
Right. Since accounting is your job,

249
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,532
why don't you figure out the problem?

250
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,534
-Maybe I will.
-Wonderful.

251
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:06,542
Hello again, Terry.

252
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,835
Don't play dumb with me.

253
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,089
Okay, here we go.

254
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,759
"A."

255
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:32,818
Hello, there, mentors.

256
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:35,988
I'm Jerry, a counselor here
at the You Seminar.

257
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:39,283
Now you don't remember it,
but you've been here before.

258
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,286
But don't worry,
forgetting the trauma of childbirth

259
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,747
is one of the great gifts of the universe.

260
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:46,790
Here at the You Seminar,

261
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:51,003
all new souls are given unique
and individual personalities.

262
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:54,507
I'm an agreeable skeptic
who's cautious yet flamboyant.

263
00:18:54,673 --> 00:18:58,594
I'm an irritable wallflower
who's dangerously curious.

264
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:03,516
I'm a manipulative megalomaniac
who's intensely opportunistic.

265
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,935
Ho, this one might be a handful.

266
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:07,561
But that's Earth's problem.

267
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:10,981
You'll notice these souls
are all missing something.

268
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:13,067
What goes in this spot?

269
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,653
Well, these souls need their "spark."

270
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:17,905
And that's where you come in.

271
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,241
Maybe you will find their spark

272
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:21,992
in the Hall of Everything,

273
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:26,413
where literally anything
on Earth could inspire.

274
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:29,583
Or perhaps you'll prefer the Hall of You,

275
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,547
featuring a selection of moments
from your own inspiring life.

276
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:36,215
And just what is this spark?

277
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:50,271
I know you're all excited to get to work,

278
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:52,815
so good luck finding the spark.

279
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:54,817
Find the spark.

280
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,444
Wow, that was informative.

281
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:00,865
Now, it's time for my favorite
part of the program,

282
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:04,326
matching you mentors with your soul mates.

283
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:07,288
Our first mentor is Maria Martinez.

284
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:09,707
Maria, come on down.

285
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,876
Maria was a rare disease specialist

286
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,878
from the University of Mexico.

287
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,047
I'm cured. I'm cured.

288
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:19,008
She'll be matched
with one of my favorites,

289
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:23,929
soul number 108,210,121,415.

290
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,891
Congratulations! Off you go.

291
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:30,269
Our next mentor is Bjorn T. Börgensson.

292
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:36,108
Dr. Börgensson
is a world-renowned child psychologist

293
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,986
who was recently awarded a Nobel Prize.

294
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,114
I see pain, death, destruction.

295
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,950
-How about now?
-A pretty butterfly.

296
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,206
Dr. Börgensson will be matched
with soul number 22.

297
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:54,084
We're gonna get into this now.
Excuse me.

298
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:58,088
22, you come out of
this dimension right now.

299
00:20:58,172 --> 00:20:59,548
How many times
do I have to tell you?

300
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:00,758
I don't wanna go to Earth.

301
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:02,384
- Stop fighting this, 22.
- I don't wanna.

302
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:03,511
You will go to Earth

303
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:04,595
- and have a life.
- Make me!

304
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,598
22 has been at the You Seminar
for quite some time

305
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:10,226
and has had such
notable mentors as Gandhi,

306
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:12,353
Abraham Lincoln, and Mother Teresa.

307
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:14,104
I made her cry.

308
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:15,356
Ignore that.

309
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,440
Put me down.

310
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:18,359
We're truly glad to have you here,
Dr. Börgensson.

311
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,031
It is an honor having you
prepare 22 for Earth.

312
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:26,325
I'm gonna make you wish you never died.

313
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:28,619
Most people wish that, 22.

314
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:31,580
Off you go. Bye!

315
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:37,878
Where are we?

316
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:39,547
That's great progress.

317
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,258
You should be very proud.
Step by step.

318
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:44,593
In celebration of
Dr. Börgensson's body of work,

319
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:46,595
we are pleased to present him
this honorary...

320
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,264
These past few weeks,
I have seen such growth.

321
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:49,723
So many people I'd like to thank,
of course.

322
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,809
Okay, look,
I'm sure your life was amazing

323
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:53,269
and you did amazing things,

324
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:54,395
but here's what we're gonna do.

325
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:56,021
We're gonna stand here
in silence for a little bit,

326
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:57,731
then we go back out, you say you tried,

327
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:00,359
I go back to not living my non-life
and you go to the Great Beyond.

328
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:01,902
-No, look.
-Talk all you want, Bjorn.

329
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:03,404
It's not gonna work, anyway.

330
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:05,823
I've had thousands of mentors
who failed and now hate me.

331
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,991
Mother Teresa...

332
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:10,077
I have compassion for every soul.

333
00:22:10,244 --> 00:22:11,745
Except you. I don't like you.

334
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:12,913
Copernicus...

335
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:15,416
The world doesn't revolve around you, 22.

336
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,584
Muhammad Ali...

337
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,086
You are the greatest pain in the butt.

338
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:20,296
Marie Antoinette...

339
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:22,339
Nobody can help you! Nobody!

340
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:23,591
Thanks, but no thanks, Doc.

341
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:25,509
I already know everything about Earth,

342
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:26,677
and it's not worth the trouble.

343
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:28,804
Come on, don't you want
to fill out your pass?

344
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:30,931
You know, I'm comfortable up here.

345
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,099
I have my routine.

346
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,059
I float in mist, I do my Sudoku puzzles,

347
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:35,311
and then, like, once a week,

348
00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:37,104
they make me come
to one of these You Seminars.

349
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:38,606
It's not great, but I know what to expect.

350
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:41,108
Look, kid, I'm not...
Can I just be honest with you?

351
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,360
I'm not Bjorn Borgenstein

352
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:44,987
or whatever his name is.
I'm not even a mentor.

353
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:46,572
Not a mentor?

354
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:51,619
Reverse psychology.

355
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:54,371
You really are a good shrink, Doctor.

356
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:55,789
Carl Jung already tried that.

357
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:58,626
Stop talking!
My unconscious mind hates you!

358
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:00,377
Is there any way

359
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:02,046
to show a different life in this place?

360
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:16,977
Wait. You're really not Bjorn Börgensson?

361
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:19,563
It's my life.

362
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:21,899
Um, excuse me, what's going on here?

363
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,318
Binaca breath spray?
Cheap cologne?

364
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:28,030
Man, who curated this exhibit?

365
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:29,532
You did.

366
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:34,620
My goodness.
It's Cedric's rap group. No!

367
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:39,583
No, don't look at that stuff.
Let's look over here.

368
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:42,169
Dad, I don't wanna go.

369
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,462
I don't like jazz.

370
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:45,422
Black improvisational music.

371
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:47,842
It's one of our great contributions
to American culture.

372
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,844
At least give it a chance, Joey.

373
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:54,473
This is where it all started.

374
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,643
This is the moment where
I fell in love with jazz.

375
00:23:59,228 --> 00:24:00,271
Listen to that.

376
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:02,773
See, the tune is just an excuse
to bring out the you.

377
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,943
And that's why I became a jazz musician.

378
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:09,446
It's not what we're looking for.

379
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:12,324
Wait a minute, that's not how
I remember it going down.

380
00:24:12,491 --> 00:24:14,577
Come back when you have something.

381
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:17,037
-Sorry, Joe.
-Sorry, Joe.

382
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:18,581
We're looking
for something different.

383
00:24:18,747 --> 00:24:20,583
Two, three, four.

384
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:43,230
My life was meaningless.

385
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,449
No, no, no.

386
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:54,783
No, I will not accept this.

387
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,078
Kid, give me that badge.
I'm goin' back to my body.

388
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:00,623
Yeah, sure. Here.

389
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:12,426
Unless it becomes an Earth Pass,
I'm stuck with it.

390
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:17,264
Well, what if I help you
turn it into an Earth Pass?

391
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:18,432
Will you give it to me then?

392
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:21,435
Wait...

393
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:25,439
I've never thought of that.
I'd get to skip life.

394
00:25:25,606 --> 00:25:27,066
So, yes!

395
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,401
But we gotta get
this thing to change first,

396
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:31,445
and I've never been able
to get it to change.

397
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:33,656
Come on.
I know all about sparks.

398
00:25:33,822 --> 00:25:35,616
Because mine is piano.

399
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,797
Really? Nothin' at all?

400
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:54,134
No, not jazz, just music.
I don't like music sounds.

401
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,095
It feels like a little too much.

402
00:25:58,013 --> 00:25:59,515
Well, I'm not going out like this.

403
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:02,351
Where's that, Hall of Everything?

404
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:06,605
I'll be right back.

405
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:07,898
Don't get ahead of yourself, pal.

406
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:10,234
By the way, why do you sound
like a middle-aged white lady?

407
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:11,318
I don't.

408
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:12,528
This is all an illusion.

409
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:13,988
This whole place is a hypothetical.

410
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:16,198
I could sound
like this if I wanted to.

411
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:17,825
Or sound like this instead.

412
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:19,159
I could even sound like you.

413
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:20,452
Life is so unfair.

414
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:23,873
I don't wanna die.
Somebody call the wambulance. Wah!

415
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:26,792
I just use this voice
because it annoys people.

416
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,043
It's very effective.

417
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:34,466
Don't worry, they're fine.

418
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:37,595
You can't crush a soul here.

419
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,138
That's what life on Earth is for.

420
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,723
Very witty.

421
00:26:43,475 --> 00:26:44,894
Okay. Here we are.

422
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,229
This is the Hall of Everything.

423
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:48,772
Whoa!

424
00:26:58,282 --> 00:26:59,283
Yes!

425
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:06,624
-Whoa.
-Congratulations!

426
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:07,708
So, where do you want to start?

427
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:08,834
Come on.

428
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,047
Croissants, cakes.
Baking could be your spark.

429
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,466
Yeah! But, um, I don't get it.

430
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,510
-Just smell it.
-Can't, and neither can you.

431
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:18,719
What?

432
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:20,721
You're right. I can't smell.

433
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:22,848
We can't...
We can't taste, either?

434
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:24,725
All that stuff is in your body.

435
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:29,063
-No smell, no taste.
-Or touch. See?

436
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:35,027
Okay, I get it. Moving on.

437
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:36,820
Isn't this exciting?

438
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,739
The fire is so pretty.

439
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:40,324
I kinda wanna let it spread.

440
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:41,408
Nope.

441
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,494
Hands are hard.

442
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,120
How about a librarian?
They're cool.

443
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:46,497
Yes, amazing.

444
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,040
Who wouldn't like working
at a thankless job

445
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:50,459
you're always in danger of
losing due to budget cuts?

446
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,419
Though I do like the idea
of randomly shushing people.

447
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:53,712
-Look, obviously this...
-Shh!

448
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:54,964
Yeah, that's good.

449
00:27:55,714 --> 00:27:56,715
Meh.

450
00:27:57,716 --> 00:27:58,717
Meh.

451
00:27:59,426 --> 00:28:00,427
Meh.

452
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:05,224
Meh.

453
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,687
Well, I think that's everything.

454
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,730
- Sorry.
- You told me you'd try.

455
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:13,983
I did. I'm telling the truth.

456
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:15,860
If there's one thing I'm not, it's a liar.

457
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:17,361
Unlike Abraham Lincoln.

458
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,530
You're really okay being on a penny?

459
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,407
Well, of course. It's an honor.

460
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,868
Okay, but they put
Andrew Jackson on the 20.

461
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:25,035
Jackson!

462
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,079
What can I say, Joe?
Earth is boring.

463
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:28,247
Well, what else can we do, then?

464
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,415
Because we're running out of time.

465
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:31,292
Yeah, you know,
time's not really a thing here.

466
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,960
Time's up!

467
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:35,171
Nice try, Bjorn, but no need to feel bad.

468
00:28:35,254 --> 00:28:36,839
22 here can be a bit of a challenge.

469
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,549
Even though I can't feel it,
please don't touch me.

470
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,384
So, let's get you to the Great Beyond.

471
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:46,098
Um, wait.
We forgot to try breakdancer.

472
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,058
Yeah! I think that's gonna be my thing.

473
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,269
Poppin' and lockin'. Windmills.

474
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,188
Settling my disputes with dance.

475
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:54,607
Can we have one more minute
to go back and try breakdancer?

476
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,858
Please, Jerry?

477
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:57,067
You look really good today, Jerry.

478
00:28:57,234 --> 00:29:00,446
Okay.
I've never seen 22 this enthused.

479
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:02,823
Good for you, Dr. Börgensson.

480
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,035
Run.

481
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:09,330
In here.

482
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:19,798
Here it is.

483
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:21,800
Where does it lead?

484
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:23,010
Hey, you ask too many questions.

485
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:24,303
How about you zip it for a minute, m'kay?

486
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:26,430
-And we're going there why?
-'Cause I know a guy there.

487
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:27,973
A guy who can help.
A guy like you.

488
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,309
Like me? As in, alive?

489
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:33,479
Wait, are you actually helping me?

490
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,564
Joe, I have been here
for who knows how long,

491
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,150
and I've never seen anything
that's made me want to live.

492
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:42,112
And then, you come along.
Your life is sad and pathetic.

493
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,782
And you're working so hard
to get back to it.

494
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:47,159
Why? I mean, this I gotta see.

495
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:48,702
Okay, let's go.

496
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,921
What is this place?

497
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:01,131
You know how when you humans
are really into something

498
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:03,467
and it feels like you're in another place?

499
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,678
Feels like you're in the zone, right?

500
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,555
- Yeah.
- Well, this is the zone.

501
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,807
It's the space between
the physical and spiritual.

502
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,269
Wait a minute. I was here.
Today, doing my audition.

503
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:16,397
This must be where musicians come
when they get into a flow.

504
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,816
Not just musicians. Watch this.

505
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,486
O, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou...

506
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:23,904
Line!

507
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,700
Oops.

508
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:28,784
Check this out.

509
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,203
I have been messing
with this team for decades.

510
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:34,832
And the Knicks
lose another one.

511
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,376
All right. All right.
Where's this guy you know?

512
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:38,460
I gotta get back to my gig.

513
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:40,588
-Okay. I mean, he's usually down here.
-What the...

514
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:41,964
Make a trade.

515
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:44,300
Make a trade. Make a trade.

516
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,467
-What is that?
-Shh!

517
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:48,012
Make a trade. Make a trade.

518
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:49,096
Run!

519
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,764
Make a trade,
make a trade, make a trade!

520
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:12,203
Ahoy there, fellow astral travelers.

521
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,038
Good to see you again, 22.

522
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,123
Moonwind, how are ya?

523
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,875
On the brink of madness,
thanks for asking.

524
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,126
Hey, got a request for you.

525
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,629
Yeah.
I'm trying to get back to my body.

526
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:22,838
Can you help me?

527
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,423
That's what we do.

528
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,342
We are the mystics without borders.

529
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,386
Devoted to helping
the lost souls of Earth find their way.

530
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:31,305
I'm Moonwind Stardancer at your service.

531
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,641
That's Windstar Dreamermoon,
Dancerstar Windmoon,

532
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:35,142
and that's Dreamerwind Dreamerdreamer.

533
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,435
These weirdos are going
to help me get back?

534
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,520
Just wait.

535
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,272
Let's get this lost soul back home.

536
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:42,900
Make a trade.

537
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:44,902
Make a trade. Make a trade.

538
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:45,986
Poor fellow.

539
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:49,365
Some people just can't let go
of their own anxieties and obsessions,

540
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:51,575
leaving them lost
and disconnected from life.

541
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,410
And this is the result.

542
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:55,371
Make a trade. Make a trade.

543
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:57,206
Make a trade. Make a trade.

544
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,916
Make a trade?

545
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,918
Looks like another hedge fund manager.

546
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,797
Now, to reconnect to your earthly body.

547
00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:11,011
Whoa. That's me.

548
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,429
Thank you.

549
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,270
What am I doing with my life?

550
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:24,567
I'm alive! I'm alive! Free yourselves!

551
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,569
It's beautiful!

552
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,071
Whoa. He got back just like that?

553
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:31,740
So this is all I had to do
to get back to my body?

554
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:36,203
Egads, man!

555
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,372
Joe, are you dead?

556
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,541
No, no. Well, not yet.

557
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:41,917
Can you help me get back?

558
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:45,713
We've never connected an untethered soul
back to its body before.

559
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:49,383
But perhaps if we travel to a thin spot...

560
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,634
Yes! All aboard!

561
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,761
Anchors away!

562
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:04,815
So if your souls are here,
where are your bodies?

563
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,483
Well, on Earth, of course.

564
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,402
My body is in a trance in Palawan.

565
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:10,821
I'm playing the Saraswati veena in Tibet.

566
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,365
I'm a shamanic healer
meditating in Berkeley, California.

567
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,243
And let me guess,
you're drumming, chanting, and meditating?

568
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,870
Yes. Something like that.

569
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,959
I'm in New York City,
on the corner of 14th and 7th.

570
00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:25,878
Yeah, that's right up
from Tony Tony Tonios.

571
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,379
Yes, precisely.

572
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:29,757
And what about you?
I thought you hated Earth.

573
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,133
Yeah, I'm not stuck with a body.

574
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,801
So I can go wherever I want.

575
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:34,428
I'm a nobody, get it?

576
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,140
We mystics meet in this glorious landscape
every Tuesday.

577
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:46,273
So many of them. Sad.

578
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,943
You know,
lost souls are not that different

579
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,277
from those in the zone.

580
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:52,530
-What?
-The zone is enjoyable,

581
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:56,784
but when that joy becomes an obsession,
one becomes disconnected from life.

582
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:57,868
Gotta find it.

583
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,870
Gotta find it. Gotta find it.

584
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,415
For a time, I was a lost soul myself.

585
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:05,417
-Really?
-Tetris.

586
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,007
There you are.

587
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,134
We'll have you back in no time.

588
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,182
Now, since you don't have
a connection to your body,

589
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:24,436
you will have to tune back
into your physical surroundings.

590
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,524
Close your eyes.

591
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:31,610
Breathe into your crown chakra.

592
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,532
Do we really need all this?

593
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,534
Yes!

594
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,871
Do you have a piano on board?
I could focus with that.

595
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,290
No pianos, Joe. You must focus.

596
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,458
Imagine silence.

597
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,002
Shh.

598
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:53,090
Now, concentrate on where your body is.

599
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,217
Listen for cues.

600
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,148
That's it. You're doing it.

601
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,861
No peeking.
Maintain your meditative state

602
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:14,987
or you'll break the connection.

603
00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:20,492
Now, see if you can smell
and feel where your body is.

604
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:24,455
I hear a heart monitor.

605
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,752
I can smell hand sanitizer.

606
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,463
Yes. Yes! Good.

607
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:34,757
I think I can feel my feet.

608
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:37,134
I feel fur.

609
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:39,220
Did you find a next of kin?

610
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,514
I feel fur.

611
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,640
Did you hear that?

612
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,808
The therapy cat is working.

613
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,603
Am I close?
When can I jump in?

614
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,146
Look! There I am.

615
00:35:49,688 --> 00:35:50,814
There I am.

616
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,900
His heart rate is increasing.

617
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:53,984
I'll get the doctor.

618
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,277
Mr. Mittens, you stay right there.

619
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,612
-What are we waiting for?
-No, Joe, don't rush this.

620
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:58,572
- It's not the right time.
- No, it's my time.

621
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,823
Wait, not me!

622
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:20,010
I did it.
I did it! I'm back.

623
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,763
What the...

624
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,391
No.

625
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,978
No. No. No.

626
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:30,479
I'm in the cat?

627
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,356
Wait a minute.
If I'm in here, then who...

628
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,483
- What?
- You're in my body!

629
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,694
- You're in the cat?
- Wait, wait, that's my body.

630
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,530
- I'm in a body! No!
- Why are you in my body?

631
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:41,365
I don't wanna be a cat.
I hate cats!

632
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,616
It's disgusting.

633
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,368
That Moonwind guy, he messed this up.

634
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:47,580
Doc, you gotta help me.
That's my body, but I'm trapped...

635
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,626
No, they can't understand me.

636
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,461
They think you're me.
You gotta try.

637
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,964
Miss Doctor, we have a problem.

638
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,508
I'm an unborn soul
and I wanna stay at the You Seminar.

639
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,427
Yes, well, that drug doesn't
seem to be working at all.

640
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,678
No, no, no, you don't understand.

641
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:03,762
- I'm not Mr. Gardner.
- Shh!

642
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,972
They're gonna think you're nuts.

643
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,140
I mean, that I'm nuts.

644
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,308
How did this happen?

645
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,685
I fell into your body because
it doesn't have a soul.

646
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:11,395
Then why am I in a cat?

647
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:12,938
I don't know!

648
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:17,651
Is there anyone we can call, Mr. Gardner?

649
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,278
A next of kin or friend?

650
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,363
- Tell her no.
- No.

651
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,698
Can you tell me what day it is?

652
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,116
It's the worst day of my life.

653
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,659
I don't wanna be here. I hate Earth.

654
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,578
Tell you what.
We're going to keep you here

655
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:29,371
for observation. Just for a bit.

656
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,624
Perhaps our therapy cat can go
to his next appointment.

657
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,958
Okay. Okay.

658
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,044
- You gotta talk to her.
- Okay.

659
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,546
Miss Doctor,
this body's soul is in this cat.

660
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,631
Stop talking.

661
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,007
So naturally, he wants to stay close.

662
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,301
Keep the cat.
Just get some rest.

663
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:43,552
A lot of it. Okay?

664
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,763
I'll come get Mr. Mittens in ten minutes.

665
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,556
Ten minutes?
We gotta get outta here.

666
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,518
No way! I am not moving!

667
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:53,938
I can't believe I'm in a body
on this hellish planet.

668
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:55,981
I have bendy meat sticks.

669
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,901
I can feel myself feeling myself.

670
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,111
Hey! Focus! Listen to me.

671
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,863
We gotta get out of here
before they take me away.

672
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,990
Take you away?
You're gonna leave me?

673
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,742
No way! That's my body you're in.

674
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:08,118
Okay, do you think you can walk?

675
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,411
I don't know!

676
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,997
I failed Body Test Drive, like, 436 times.

677
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,666
But will you try?

678
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,463
Okay. Gotta find Moonwind,
he can fix this.

679
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,383
I'm a cat. I can make this.

680
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,349
Okay, come on, you're doing great.

681
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:32,726
Keep going. Keep going.

682
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,645
I'm just gonna rest here for a minute.

683
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:37,481
No, no, no, no.
They'll be back any minute. Come on.

684
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,316
Okay!

685
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:52,538
In here!

686
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,212
Whoa.

687
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,756
Okay, good.

688
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,135
Now push the down button.

689
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,388
Move your... Nope. Careful.

690
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:10,639
Those fingers are my livelihood.

691
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,770
Now get in.

692
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,366
Okay, what did Moonwind say?

693
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,410
He said on the corner of 14th and 7th.

694
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:33,537
Yeah, that's Chelsea.
Near Jackson Square Park.

695
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,289
Exactly. Wait.
How do you know all that?

696
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:36,790
It's all in this stupid brain of yours.

697
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,375
Hey, hey, hey, stay outta there.

698
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,211
Relax. There's not much here.

699
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:41,837
Jazz, jazz, more jazz.

700
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,547
And someone named Lisa.
Who's that?

701
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,673
Never mind.

702
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,061
I, um...

703
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,354
It's all happening too fast, you know.

704
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,688
Let's just take a minute and, um...

705
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,899
Come on, let's go.
They could be here any second.

706
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,162
Don't worry, it's okay.
Just keep walking.

707
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,460
Aah!

708
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,586
No, don't stop.
What are you doing?

709
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,671
This is New York City.

710
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,257
You don't stop in the middle
of the street. Go, go, go.

711
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,764
No. 22. 22!

712
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,519
22. No.
No. 22. 22.

713
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,396
22! 22!

714
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,654
22, I didn't know I had claws, okay?

715
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,823
Look, I'm sorry.
But come on, let's go.

716
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:51,907
No way.

717
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,869
I am staying right here
until your stupid body dies.

718
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,955
Which will happen any minute now
because your stomach is earthquaking.

719
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,554
Yeah, this place is worse than I thought.

720
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,973
It's loud, and bright, and...

721
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,142
What is that in my nose?

722
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,894
That's smell.

723
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,063
And if you think that's good,
just imagine what it tastes like.

724
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,609
Go on.

725
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,411
It's so good!

726
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,498
It's, It's not horrible.

727
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,751
Good. You can eat on the way.
Let's go.

728
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,339
Or you just take a few minutes. Sure.

729
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,344
Strange,
I don't feel so angry anymore.

730
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,096
That's great.
Ready to find Moonwind?

731
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,973
Maybe.

732
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,643
I'm telling you, Joe,
it's pronounced yee-row.

733
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,187
Yeah, but in New York,
we call them gyros. It's Greek.

734
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,855
No, I got in a fight
with Archimedes about this.

735
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,483
He said it's... -Yee-row.
-Yo-yo.

736
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,776
-Yee-row.
-YOLO.

737
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,860
-Yee-row.
-Sergio?

738
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:10,945
Yee-row!

739
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,738
I miss that guy.

740
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,532
This is 14th and 7th.

741
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,618
That's gotta be him.

742
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,289
Moonwind, you gotta help me.

743
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,961
Joe! You made it into your body.

744
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,212
No, he didn't.

745
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,005
That is my body.

746
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,757
You're in a cat?

747
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,092
That's marvelous!

748
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,385
Hey, Moonwimp!

749
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,554
That sign won't spin by itself, hear me?

750
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,807
But, Marge, look!
I put this man's soul in a cat.

751
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,308
Who cares? And you!

752
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,353
We only have room for
one weirdo here, so, scram!

753
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,688
Get back to work!

754
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,273
No one understands my art.

755
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,357
Moonwind, listen,

756
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,026
I gotta get out of here and back in there.

757
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,194
Well, we'll have to perform

758
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,154
an old-fashioned astral
transmigration displacement.

759
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,447
-A what?
-It's simply a way

760
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,949
to get your souls back where they belong.

761
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,576
And it's a glorious ritual, indeed,

762
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,412
full of chanting, dancing,
and best of all, bongos.

763
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,748
I need to be at The Half Note by 7:00,
so this needs to happen right now.

764
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast.

765
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,794
You must wait for another thin spot

766
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,754
to open between Earth
and the astral plane.

767
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,089
And that won't occur

768
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,633
until Orcus moves
into the house of Gemini.

769
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,801
When is that?

770
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,553
Well, the government calls it 6:30.

771
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,721
Look, I'll meet you at The Half Note.

772
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,805
6:30? You serious?

773
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,182
I'll gather all
the necessary provisions...

774
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,851
I said, get out of here! Go!

775
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,269
See you
at The Half Note at 6:30!

776
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,520
I'll take care of everything!

777
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,480
And stay away!

778
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,490
Sure are a lot of Garcias in here.

779
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,662
You're out there somewhere, little soul,

780
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,915
and I'm gonna find ya.

781
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,334
All right, this is the last snack.

782
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,419
I can barely fit into my pants as it is.

783
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,379
6:30 is cutting it close. Too close.

784
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,257
We gotta get back to my place
and get you cleaned up and...

785
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,012
We gotta hail a cab.
Hold your hand out.

786
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,555
Hold it up and out.

787
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,975
Man, this would be hard
even if I wasn't wearing a hospital gown.

788
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,480
Go, go, go!
Just run to that one.

789
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,780
Is that Teach?

790
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,490
Pepperoni.

791
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,089
Aah, Dorothea Williams saw me.

792
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,216
What am I gonna do?
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

793
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,551
Maybe you should call her up

794
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,344
and tell her that we're not crazy.

795
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,722
I've only been a person for an hour,
and even I know that's a bad idea.

796
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:47,434
I just gotta get back in my body
and really bring it tonight.

797
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,229
How come this part is stinky
but this part smells fine?

798
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,773
Never mind.
Just put those pants on.

799
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,149
Sheesh, I can't believe I've been

800
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,484
walking around in this city
with no pants on.

801
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,069
I don't even wanna be here, remember?

802
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,612
I don't want you here either. I just...

803
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,906
I just wanna get back to my body,

804
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:04,201
then get back to the club.

805
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,828
What's the matter with you?

806
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,873
I don't know.
It's the sun. It's just so...

807
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,542
My phone!

808
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,169
Um... Okay, your clothes
are rumbling again.

809
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,714
Curley! No, no.

810
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:22,928
Oops.

811
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,269
Hey, Mr. G, it's Curley.
Um...

812
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,562
I hope you're doin' okay.

813
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,441
Dorothea freaked out when she saw you,
and she called this other guy, Robert.

814
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,026
He's got the gig now. I'm sorry.

815
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,611
No, no, no.

816
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,695
Look, honestly,

817
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,489
your class was the only reason
I went to school at all.

818
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,241
Like, I owe you a lot.

819
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,451
So, here's the plan.

820
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,077
Clean yourself up, put on a killer suit,

821
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,787
and get to the club early.

822
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,831
I'm gonna try and talk to her.

823
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,918
Just make sure you show up
looking like a million bucks, all right?

824
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,337
I hope I see you, man.
All right. Peace.

825
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,297
I can get the gig back, 22.

826
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,673
I need your help. I have a suit.

827
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,133
I'm gonna need you to try it on.

828
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,218
No, no, no.

829
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,886
And then I can line
my hair up a little bit,

830
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,180
- and I can...
- Nope. No way, no how.

831
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,473
22!

832
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,603
Mr. Gardner?

833
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,146
It's Connie.
She's here for her lesson.

834
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,940
- What do I do?
- I can hear you!

835
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,608
Just tell her that you can't do it today.

836
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:19,360
Hi, Connie.

837
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,528
Sorry, but Joe can't do it today.

838
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,737
- You're Joe!
- I mean, me.

839
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,988
Me can't do it today.

840
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,698
Good. Now let's go
check out that suit.

841
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,867
I came to tell you that I quit.

842
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,035
Quit?

843
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,079
We don't have time for this.
The suit is in the closet.

844
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,957
Band is a stupid waste of time.

845
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,250
This kid is talking sense.

846
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,417
What are you doing?

847
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,506
Here, I quit.
I think jazz is pointless.

848
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,716
Yeah, jazz is definitely pointless.

849
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,801
Hey!

850
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,928
In fact, all of school is a waste of time.

851
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,391
Of course. Like my mentor,
George Orwell, used to say,

852
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,725
"State sponsored education

853
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,353
"is like the rattling of a stick
inside a swill bucket."

854
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,563
Yeah!

855
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,815
The ruling class's core
curriculum stifles dissent.

856
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,233
It's the oldest trick in the book.

857
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,317
What are you talkin' about?

858
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,443
She doesn't care about any of that.

859
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,445
I've been saying that
since the third grade.

860
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,447
You know, you seem really smart.

861
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,491
What is your position on pizza?

862
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,119
- I like it?
- Me, too!

863
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,162
What are you doing?

864
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,789
I'd rather hang with Connie.

865
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,000
What? Come back here!
You open this...

866
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,754
Um, I think your cat wants to get out.

867
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,131
He thinks he knows everything.

868
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,091
22! Don't you walk away from me.

869
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,176
Come here right now.

870
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,136
I'm gonna go in
and I'mma scratch up the sofa.

871
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,554
Wait a minute, that's my sofa.

872
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,264
You really got things figured out, Connie.

873
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,434
I'd better give this back.
It belongs to the school.

874
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,560
Sure.

875
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,061
You know, I really am glad
there's someone else

876
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,688
who sees how ridiculous this place is.

877
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,356
You're right to quit.
I learned about quitting...

878
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,566
You know what, Mr. G?

879
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,276
I was practicing this one thing yesterday

880
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,946
and maybe you can listen to it
and tell me to quit after, okay?

881
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,993
Okay.

882
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,652
Wow. You really love this.

883
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:26,695
Yeah.

884
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,324
So, maybe I'd better stick with it?

885
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,909
Yeah.

886
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,494
Bye, Mr. G.

887
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,995
See you next week!

888
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,539
22!

889
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,042
So, Connie came here to quit,

890
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,126
but then she didn't.

891
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,628
22, forget about that. Listen.

892
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,713
I need to know this, Joe.
Why didn't she quit?

893
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,965
Because she loves to play.

894
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:49,552
She might say she hates everything,
but trombone is her thing.

895
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,886
She's good at it.

896
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,305
Maybe trombone is her spark, I don't know.

897
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,017
Please. If I'm gonna get this gig back,
I need your help.

898
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,686
Okay.

899
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,062
Really?

900
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:03,190
I'll help you,
but I wanna try a few things.

901
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,400
'Cause I don't know,

902
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:07,736
some of it's not as boring
as it is at the You Seminar,

903
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,822
and if Connie can find
something she loves here,

904
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,240
maybe I can, too.

905
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,826
-Great!
-So, what do we do first?

906
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,789
- This water hurts!
- It's okay.

907
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,499
You just have to turn the other knob.

908
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,667
Okay, that's better.

909
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,918
And I wouldn't be mad

910
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,087
if you put a little lotion
on me when you're done.

911
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,677
I washed your butt for you.

912
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,805
Spicy! Spicy!

913
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,980
You five will be insecure.

914
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,774
And you 12 will be self-absorbed.

915
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,444
We really should stop sending
so many through that pavilion.

916
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,612
Found him!

917
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,696
See that, everybody?

918
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,114
Who figured out why the count's off?

919
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,199
That's right, Terry did.

920
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,325
It's Terrytime.

921
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,744
-Wow. Nice work.
-Well, who is it?

922
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,329
Right.

923
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,207
Joe Gardner is his name.

924
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,292
Looks like he's back down on Earth.

925
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,376
That's not good.

926
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,961
That... That's the mentor
we set up with 22.

927
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,422
All right, all right.
Easy on the hysterics.

928
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,383
Terry's got this under control.
I'll handle it.

929
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:12,468
How?

930
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,552
I'll go down there and get him.

931
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,970
Set the count right, lickety-split.

932
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,014
Okay, whoa.
Are you sure that's a good idea?

933
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,350
Look, you all are the ones who beefed it.

934
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,976
I'm trying to un-beef it.

935
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:22,978
But you cannot be seen.

936
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,355
By anyone.

937
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,525
Don't worry. I'll make sure
no one else sees me.

938
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,653
I'll move among the shadows, like a ninja.

939
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,155
Please, just do it quickly and quietly.

940
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:36,242
And also quickly.
And quietly as well.

941
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,831
This won't be a disaster, that's for sure.

942
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:47,378
Trusty old brown suit.
Still a perfect fit.

943
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,547
It's a little tight in the back-here part.

944
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,507
It'll loosen. Sit down.

945
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:53,926
I'm a cat.

946
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,262
I'll do it.

947
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,471
You couldn't call an elevator, remember?

948
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,766
No way. I just need to line me up.
Now be still.

949
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,855
It's like a little tiny chainsaw.

950
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,190
-Don't move.
-I'm not moving. You're moving.

951
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,158
No!

952
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,368
Don't worry, I'm okay.

953
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,329
No, no, no! My hair!
My hair is not okay!

954
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,747
This is a disaster!

955
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,916
We gotta fix this. Right now.

956
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,335
-Okay. How?
-We gotta go see Dez.

957
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,421
Great. Who's Dez?

958
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,922
Yo, Ian, man, how you get

959
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,465
that big peanut head?
What happened to you?

960
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,510
Man, shut up, man.
You know I'm sensitive about that.

961
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,053
Dez is the guy in the back.

962
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,180
He can fix this.

963
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,681
Talk about havin' a spark.

964
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,308
This guy was born to be a barber.

965
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,102
But I can't pass for you
in front of all your friends.

966
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,812
Dez is the only one that I talk to.

967
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,314
We usually talk about jazz,

968
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,275
but this time, just sit there,
get the cut, and get out.

969
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,822
Hey, Joe. What are you
doing here on a weekday?

970
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:59,033
You didn't call for an appointment, man.
It's gonna be a while.

971
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:01,952
I was afraid of this.
Go ahead and sit down.

972
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,996
My Lord.

973
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,414
You gotta wait, son.
This is an emergency.

974
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:06,874
What? That ain't cool, Dez.

975
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,334
You could always let Harold cut your hair.

976
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,793
His chair's wide open.

977
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,879
Nah. I can wait.

978
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,215
Joe, get your butt in this chair now.

979
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,552
Should I even ask you how this happened?

980
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,471
-The cat did it.
-Stop sounding insane.

981
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,598
I mean, um, I was distracted

982
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,433
getting ready to play with
Dorothea Williams tonight.

983
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,061
Dorothea Williams?
That's big time, Joe.

984
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,021
Congratulations!

985
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,023
Joe ain't getting no gig, Dez.

986
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,317
You know he Mr. Close-But-No-Cigar.

987
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,610
This guy.

988
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,570
Joe, ignore him.
Now let's fix you up.

989
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,155
You keeping that cat on your lap?

990
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,532
Is it okay that I do that?

991
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,784
Suit yourself. You're the boss.

992
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,661
-I am?
-When you're in this chair,

993
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:44,828
yeah, you are.

994
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,872
So can I have one of those?

995
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,667
Sure, Joe.

996
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,671
Cool.

997
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,842
I like being in the chair.

998
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,301
Hey, get your head in the game.

999
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,469
Little chainsaw.

1000
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,054
You need to settle down.
If you keep this...

1001
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,141
Look, I can deal with some freaky stuff,

1002
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,726
but if this cat don't chill,

1003
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,186
we're gonna have to put it outside.

1004
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,313
Well, what's it gonna be, kitty?

1005
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:13,065
Meow.

1006
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,859
Sometimes, change is good.

1007
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,111
You have been rocking
that same style for a while.

1008
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:20,364
Well, Dez, for hundreds of years,
I've had no style at all.

1009
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,908
You can say that again.

1010
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,369
But then my life changed.

1011
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,579
Yeah? What happened?

1012
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,789
I was existing as a theoretical construct

1013
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:30,249
in a hypothetical way station

1014
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,458
between life and death.

1015
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,626
I heard that.

1016
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,921
And by the time
I got to mentor number 266,

1017
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:39,091
I was seriously asking, like,
what is all the fuss about?

1018
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:42,344
Like, is all this living
really worth dying for?

1019
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,054
You know what I mean?

1020
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,559
I never knew you had
such an interesting education, Joe.

1021
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,561
I just thought you went to music school.

1022
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,522
And another thing,
they say you're born to do something,

1023
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,232
but how do you figure out
what that thing is?

1024
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,318
I mean, what if you pick up
the wrong thing?

1025
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:58,736
Or somebody else's thing, you know?

1026
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,613
-Then you're stuck.
-Been there before.

1027
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,156
I'll take one of those.

1028
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,824
I wouldn't call myself stuck,

1029
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,868
but I never planned on
cuttin' heads for a livin'.

1030
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,787
Wait, but you were born to be a barber,
weren't you?

1031
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,289
I wanted to be a veterinarian.

1032
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,875
So, why didn't you do that?

1033
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,169
I was plannin' to
when I got out of the Navy.

1034
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,171
Then my daughter got sick,

1035
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,714
and barber school
is a lot cheaper

1036
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:19,798
than veterinarian school.

1037
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:20,925
Well, that's too bad.

1038
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,843
You're stuck as a barber
and now you're unhappy.

1039
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,720
Whoa, whoa, slow your roll there, Joe.

1040
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,138
I'm happy as a clam, my man.

1041
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:29,266
Not everyone can be Charles Drew
inventing blood transfusions.

1042
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,560
Or me, playing piano
with Dorothea Williams.

1043
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:32,645
I know.

1044
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,271
You are not all that.

1045
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:35,940
Anyone could play in a band
if they wanted to.

1046
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,316
Don't pay Paul any mind.

1047
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,443
People like him just bring
other people down

1048
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,320
so they can make themselves feel better.

1049
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,988
I get it.

1050
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:46,075
He's just criticizing me to cover up
the pain of his own failed dreams.

1051
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,828
You cut deep, Joe.

1052
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:53,165
I wonder why sitting in this chair
makes me want to tell you things, Dez.

1053
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,544
That's the magic of the chair.
That's why I love this job.

1054
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,963
I get to meet interesting folks like you,

1055
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,174
make them happy, and make them handsome.

1056
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,760
Wow! Am I crazy or do I look younger?

1057
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,012
I may not have invented
blood transfusions,

1058
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:10,599
but I am most definitely savin' lives.

1059
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,894
I don't know about
this crazy cat guy thing, man,

1060
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:17,982
but it is nice to finally talk to you
about something other than jazz, Joe.

1061
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:21,151
How come we, um, never
talked about your life before?

1062
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,695
You never asked.

1063
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,238
But I'm glad you did this time.

1064
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,407
- Looking good, brother.
- Have a great show.

1065
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,201
I grabbed
a couple of road lollies.

1066
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,625
Dr. Charma, call 3-1-6-2.

1067
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:04,486
Julia Child didn't succeed
till she was 49.

1068
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,572
Hey, Paul. Here, have a lollipop.

1069
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:08,657
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks, man.

1070
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,159
There you are.

1071
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,912
No hard feelings, right? All right.

1072
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:13,996
Just friends.

1073
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,289
Just friends goofing on each other.
All right.

1074
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:17,291
Okay. Goodbye, Paul.

1075
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,126
Come to Terry.

1076
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:21,795
Gotcha!

1077
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,423
Thought you could cheat the universe?

1078
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:25,508
Well, you thought wrong.

1079
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,885
I'm the accountant,
and I'm here to bring you in...

1080
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,554
Whoa...
You're not Joe Gardner.

1081
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,890
My mistake.

1082
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:36,018
We'll just get you back into
your meat suit.

1083
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:38,812
There you go.

1084
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,397
No harm, no foul.

1085
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,359
Boy. Look, fella,

1086
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:44,818
I'm thinking there's no reason

1087
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,987
we can't keep this little
incident between us?

1088
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,657
Mistakes happen.
And, it's not your time.

1089
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,158
Unless you keep eating

1090
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:53,786
those processed foods,
am I right?

1091
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,917
But seriously, stay away
from those processed foods.

1092
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,131
You know what,
you did all right back there.

1093
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:07,466
How did you know how to deal with Paul?

1094
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,260
I didn't. I just let out the me.

1095
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,638
Hey, like you said about jazz.
I was jazzing.

1096
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,849
First of all,
"jazzing" is not a word.

1097
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:18,310
And second, music and life
operate by very different rules.

1098
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:19,603
It says take one.

1099
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,147
Don't... Or do. Okay. Fine.

1100
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,649
"Man with a van."

1101
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,401
I got a few in case we need a lot of vans.

1102
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,486
Now, let's get back to the plan.

1103
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,114
We go to The Half Note
and wait there for Moonwind.

1104
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,615
It's around 4:00 p.m. now...

1105
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,451
You know what?

1106
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:35,786
You are really getting good
at using those legs.

1107
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,788
Why don't you try runnin'?

1108
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:40,457
Hey! I made a song.
I'm jazzing.

1109
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,710
Okay, enough of the jazzing
and everything like that.

1110
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,253
We need to get somewhere.
Now, I...

1111
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,755
- That tickles.
- What are you doing?

1112
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,389
Whoops. I got it.

1113
00:57:58,726 --> 00:57:59,810
Would you hurry up?

1114
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,145
Okay.

1115
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:04,899
You were right.
These pants are loosening.

1116
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,734
No, no, no.

1117
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,068
Don't let people see your butt!

1118
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,279
- It's your butt.
- It doesn't matter whose butt...

1119
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,072
Take off the jacket.
Tie it around your waist.

1120
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,991
Quick! Cover the butt!

1121
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,492
What are we gonna do?

1122
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,369
I can't find a tailor this late...

1123
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:20,122
No. We're gonna have to go to Mom's.

1124
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:21,207
Okay.

1125
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,374
No, no, no, you don't understand.

1126
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:23,501
Mom doesn't know about this gig.

1127
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,585
And she's not gonna like it.

1128
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:25,669
Okay.

1129
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:26,795
We don't have any other choice.

1130
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:27,880
Okay.

1131
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,548
She's the only one that can fix this.

1132
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,217
-Okay.
-Stop saying "okay"!

1133
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,385
We gotta catch the subway across town.
Come on.

1134
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,513
Okay... Got it.

1135
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:39,183
My mom doesn't know
anything about the gig,

1136
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,601
and I wanna keep it that way, okay?

1137
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,144
Right, because she thinks
you're a failure.

1138
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:43,521
-What?
-I didn't say that.

1139
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:44,855
You did. Up here.

1140
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,358
Look, my mom has her own
definition of what success is,

1141
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,777
and being a professional musician
isn't it.

1142
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:54,949
So, let me see, I need the suit fixed
for a, school band recital.

1143
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:58,577
I'm not looking forward to this,
but there's no reason she needs to know...

1144
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,013
I don't know.
All the times I've been

1145
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:20,766
so close to getting to my dreams,

1146
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,810
something always gets in the way.

1147
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,019
You know what I mean?

1148
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:31,527
He's good.

1149
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:35,447
And I've heard music before,
but I've never felt like this inside.

1150
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:38,158
Of course, you love music now,
because you're me. Let's go.

1151
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:42,997
Let's go.

1152
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,100
Whoa!

1153
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,020
Hey, take it easy?

1154
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,688
I'm sorry.

1155
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,398
Don't worry about it.

1156
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:11,066
It's the subway.
It does that to some people.

1157
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:12,776
-Does what?
-It wears you down.

1158
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,237
It stinks. It's hot. It's crowded.

1159
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:18,657
Every day the same thing,
day in and day out.

1160
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,493
But once I get on the stage tonight,

1161
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:23,454
all my troubles are going to be fixed.

1162
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:26,123
You're gonna see a brand-new Joe Gardner.

1163
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,252
Where'd you get that?

1164
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:31,879
Under the seat.
Can you believe it?

1165
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,048
It's still half-full.

1166
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,468
All right, remember,

1167
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,596
I need the suit fixed for a band recital.
Got it?

1168
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:47,061
- Joey! Baby boy...
- Joey!

1169
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,230
- I'm so proud of you.
- ...we heard the news.

1170
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:52,608
Crap. She knows.

1171
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:54,318
Your momma's in the back.

1172
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,111
-You gotta go in there.
-No, I don't want to.

1173
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,614
You have to.
We need the suit fixed.

1174
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,826
You forgetting something, Joey?

1175
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,036
-What?
-Kiss her.

1176
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:06,372
I always kiss Melba when I see her.

1177
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,125
Just do it.

1178
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,756
No, no, no. Not on the lips.

1179
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,883
Joey!
What has gotten into you, boy?

1180
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:19,009
Let him finish.

1181
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:20,177
Cougar. I knew it.

1182
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:23,264
I'll take another kiss
when you get back, Joey.

1183
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:30,813
So much for being done
chasing after gigs?

1184
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:34,567
I hope that cat isn't supposed to be
some kind of peace offering.

1185
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,943
Come. Come on.

1186
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,194
Just say you rescued it.

1187
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:39,655
Um, no. It's mine. I rescued it.

1188
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:42,032
Too bad you can't rescue your career.

1189
01:01:43,284 --> 01:01:46,412
Just ask her nicely
if she can fix my suit.

1190
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:50,249
So, Mom, is there any way
you can fix this?

1191
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,792
Whoa! I don't need to see that.

1192
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:54,003
I know. Embarrassing, right?

1193
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:55,671
So, you'll fix it?

1194
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:56,964
- No.
- What?

1195
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,341
How long are you going
to keep doing this, Joey?

1196
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:01,635
You tell me you're going
to accept the full-time position...

1197
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:02,720
Here it comes.

1198
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,096
...and instead,
I hear you've taken another gig.

1199
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,306
Tell her that this one is different.

1200
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:06,390
This one's different!

1201
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,726
Does this gig have a pension?
Health insurance?

1202
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:11,770
No? Then it's the same as the other ones.

1203
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:13,856
It's like you can't even
be truthful with me anymore.

1204
01:02:14,023 --> 01:02:15,983
Fine, we'll get the suit
off the rack somewhere.

1205
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,028
My mom has never understood
what I'm trying to do with my life.

1206
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:20,738
Fine, we'll get the suit
off the rack somewhere.

1207
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:22,489
My mom has never understood

1208
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:23,657
what I'm trying to do with my life.

1209
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:25,659
-22!
-What did you just say?

1210
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:27,995
Oof. Can I run away now,
like you usually do?

1211
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:33,459
No. Not this time.
Repeat after me.

1212
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:36,378
Mom, I know we've had some rough times,

1213
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:38,380
but you're right,

1214
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:41,133
I can't be truthful with you.

1215
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,136
Because it seems like
no matter what I do, you disapprove.

1216
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:46,347
Look, I know you love playing.

1217
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:49,517
Then how come except for church,
you're the happiest when I don't?

1218
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,895
I finally land the gig of my life
and you're upset.

1219
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:55,856
You didn't see how tough
being a musician was on your father.

1220
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:57,858
I don't want to see
you struggle like that.

1221
01:02:58,025 --> 01:03:00,110
So Dad could pursue his dreams,
and I can't?

1222
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,154
Your father had me.

1223
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:05,157
Most times,
this shop is what paid the bills.

1224
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:07,868
So when I'm gone, who's gonna pay yours?

1225
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:09,495
Music is all I think about.

1226
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:11,747
From the moment I wake up in the morning

1227
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,874
to the moment I fall asleep at night.

1228
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,293
You can't eat dreams for breakfast, Joey.

1229
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,837
Then I don't want to eat.

1230
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:20,840
This isn't about my career, Mom.

1231
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:23,175
It's my reason for living.

1232
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:25,094
And I know Dad felt the same way.

1233
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:29,306
I'm just afraid
that if I died today,

1234
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:32,893
that my life would've amounted to nothing.

1235
01:03:35,104 --> 01:03:36,313
Joey.

1236
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,706
Let's make this work instead.

1237
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,170
That's my dad's suit.

1238
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,546
Lulu. Melba.

1239
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:03,174
Bring your good scissors in here.
We got work to do.

1240
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,264
Wow. This feels really nice.

1241
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:12,725
-You look marvelous.
-It fits perfectly.

1242
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:13,809
You see how I did that?

1243
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:17,104
That is one fine wool suit,
if I do say so myself.

1244
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:18,480
-Can I try on that?
-Of course you can.

1245
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:20,608
Just handsome.

1246
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:23,360
Thank you, Mom.

1247
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:26,155
Ray would have been so proud of you, baby.

1248
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:28,699
Like I've always been.

1249
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:31,535
You heard me, right?

1250
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:33,871
The suit is wool, not polyester.

1251
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:36,207
So, don't go putting that cat
on your shoulders again.

1252
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:37,291
Yes, ma'am!

1253
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,667
there's a nice little taper there.

1254
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:40,044
Thanks, Mom.

1255
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,048
That was amazin'.

1256
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:45,966
You know what that felt like?
It felt like jazz.

1257
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:47,551
Yeah, you were jazzing.

1258
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,470
Ha-ha. Okay, jazzing.

1259
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:52,306
I'm telling you, Joe.

1260
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,933
You really should call Lisa again.

1261
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,810
I don't really have time
for a relationship right now, 22.

1262
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,354
Busy right now?

1263
01:04:58,437 --> 01:04:59,772
Wanna wait till you die a second time?

1264
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:01,106
Cool, cool, cool.

1265
01:05:01,273 --> 01:05:02,900
I can't believe
I'm getting romantic advice

1266
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:04,068
from an unborn soul.

1267
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:05,778
I can think of worse.

1268
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:07,154
There it is.

1269
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:13,035
We made it!
This is going to work.

1270
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,329
Whoa! I can't believe how good I look.

1271
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:18,332
The suit, the cut.
Just look at me.

1272
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:26,340
- Ooh, just turn a little bit right there.
- Like this?

1273
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,509
- Angle the shoulders, and...
- Hey, who's that?

1274
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:29,635
- And from this side.
- That's it.

1275
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:30,761
What? Who's back here?

1276
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:32,429
- Still me. 
- That's a winner.

1277
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:34,723
Right?

1278
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:37,726
This can't be happenin'.
Now, I'm not gonna believe this.

1279
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:39,520
The Half Note.

1280
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:46,193
He made you pay for dinner?

1281
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:47,319
Yeah...

1282
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:10,676
So, you ready?

1283
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:11,969
To go home.

1284
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,471
I bet you're ready to get off
of this stinky rock?

1285
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,515
What do you think of Earth, anyway?

1286
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:23,397
I always said it was dumb. But...

1287
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,025
I mean...

1288
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:28,444
Just look at what I found.

1289
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,364
Your mom sewed your suit
from this cute spool.

1290
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:35,451
When I was nervous, Dez gave me this.

1291
01:06:35,618 --> 01:06:38,829
A guy on the subway yelled at me.
It was scary.

1292
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:42,333
But I kind of liked that, too.

1293
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:47,671
Truth is, I've always worried

1294
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,466
that maybe there's something
wrong with me. You know?

1295
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,677
Maybe I'm not good enough for living.

1296
01:06:54,678 --> 01:07:00,935
But then you showed me
about purpose and passion,

1297
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:03,187
and maybe sky-watching can be my spark.

1298
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,356
Or walking.
I'm really good at walking.

1299
01:07:05,523 --> 01:07:07,233
Those really aren't purposes, 22.

1300
01:07:07,316 --> 01:07:08,609
That's just regular old living.

1301
01:07:08,776 --> 01:07:10,778
But, hey, when you get back
to the You Seminar,

1302
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:12,321
you can give it an honest try.

1303
01:07:12,488 --> 01:07:15,074
No, but I've been at the You Seminar
for thousands of years

1304
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:17,326
and I have never felt this close.

1305
01:07:17,493 --> 01:07:20,454
Joe! Who's ready to go home?

1306
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:21,622
Moonwind.

1307
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:22,748
The stars are almost in alignment.

1308
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:23,832
All right.

1309
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,125
I'll have you back
in your bodies in no time.

1310
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:28,796
No. I've gotta find it here, on Earth.

1311
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,923
This is my only chance to find my spark.

1312
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:34,635
22, you're only loving this stuff
because you're in my body.

1313
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:38,097
You can find your own thing to love
when you get back to the You Seminar.

1314
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:40,516
Now, come on,
I need my body back. Now!

1315
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:44,186
No.

1316
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,773
I'm in the chair.

1317
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,610
- 22!
- Leave me alone!

1318
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:53,821
I'm trying to find my purpose!

1319
01:07:53,988 --> 01:07:55,656
22, you come back here!

1320
01:07:58,033 --> 01:07:59,368
22!

1321
01:08:06,876 --> 01:08:07,960
Mr. Mittens.

1322
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:17,052
There they are.

1323
01:08:23,684 --> 01:08:24,977
You come back here right now!

1324
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:28,689
You stole my body!

1325
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:58,052
It's your time to go, Joe Gardner.

1326
01:09:04,934 --> 01:09:05,935
No, you don't.

1327
01:09:08,687 --> 01:09:09,688
Gotcha!

1328
01:09:11,357 --> 01:09:12,900
No, no, no.

1329
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:25,162
No, no!

1330
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:28,749
I was gonna play with Dorothea Williams!

1331
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:30,668
And I was about to find my spark!

1332
01:09:30,835 --> 01:09:32,169
Find your spark?
My life was finally going to change!

1333
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:33,587
You promised, but you wouldn't
even give me five minutes!

1334
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:34,880
I lost everything because of you!

1335
01:09:34,964 --> 01:09:35,965
Joe!

1336
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:38,801
You cheated.

1337
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:45,558
Found him.

1338
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:46,976
-Joe Gardner.
-You're back!

1339
01:09:47,059 --> 01:09:48,102
Terry, you found them.

1340
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,186
No need to thank me.

1341
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:51,856
It's so nice to have
everything back in order, and...

1342
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,942
22 got her pass?

1343
01:09:57,236 --> 01:09:58,821
- My goodness.
- 22! You got an Earth Pass!

1344
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,364
This is amazing!

1345
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:01,824
I knew you could do it.

1346
01:10:01,907 --> 01:10:02,950
This is cray cray.

1347
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:05,870
But what...
What filled in the last box?

1348
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:08,414
I'll tell you what filled it in. I did!

1349
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:10,332
It was my spark that changed that badge.

1350
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:14,003
She only got that because
she was living my life in my body.

1351
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,380
- I was...
- Come on, Mr. Gardner.

1352
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:19,133
Joe, it's time for you

1353
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,968
to accompany 22 to the Earth portal.

1354
01:10:21,135 --> 01:10:22,636
Give you a chance to say goodbye.

1355
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:24,430
Of course.
It's standard procedure.

1356
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:27,349
Just hold on a minute.
I get to set the count right.

1357
01:10:27,516 --> 01:10:30,102
Terry, you have done a super job.

1358
01:10:30,186 --> 01:10:31,228
We'll take it from here.

1359
01:10:31,312 --> 01:10:32,313
You're amazing.

1360
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:34,356
Well, thank you.

1361
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:37,026
Terrytime.

1362
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:39,361
Go ahead, you two.

1363
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:50,414
You don't know.

1364
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:54,126
You can't be sure why my pass changed.

1365
01:10:54,502 --> 01:10:56,295
Come on, 22.
Think about it.

1366
01:10:56,462 --> 01:10:59,340
You hated music until you were in my body.

1367
01:10:59,507 --> 01:11:03,010
You hated everything until you were me.

1368
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,515
I hope you enjoy it.

1369
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,120
I have to ask,
how the Dickens did you do it?

1370
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:31,789
Get that Earth Pass to change?

1371
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:34,500
You know what, I...
I just let her walk

1372
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,252
a mile in my shoes, you could say.

1373
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,711
Well, it worked.

1374
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:39,421
Yeah.

1375
01:11:39,588 --> 01:11:42,341
Well, you should probably
get going to the Great Beyond.

1376
01:11:42,508 --> 01:11:45,177
Hey, um, we never found out
what 22's purpose was.

1377
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:47,805
- Excuse me?
- You know, her, spark.

1378
01:11:47,972 --> 01:11:51,642
Her purpose. Was it music?
Biology? Walking?

1379
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:54,144
We don't assign purposes.
Where did you get that idea?

1380
01:11:54,854 --> 01:11:55,855
Because I have piano.

1381
01:11:55,938 --> 01:11:57,982
It's what I was born to do.
That's my spark.

1382
01:11:58,148 --> 01:12:00,401
A spark isn't a soul's purpose.

1383
01:12:01,068 --> 01:12:03,112
You mentors and your passions.

1384
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:07,700
Your purposes. Your meanings of life.
So basic.

1385
01:12:07,783 --> 01:12:09,910
No, no, it...

1386
01:12:13,706 --> 01:12:14,915
Wow.

1387
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:18,169
It is music.
My spark is music. I...

1388
01:12:18,878 --> 01:12:20,296
I know it is.

1389
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:27,261
I'm no good.

1390
01:12:28,095 --> 01:12:29,805
I got no purpose.

1391
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:32,349
No purpose.

1392
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:35,060
No purpose.

1393
01:13:03,923 --> 01:13:06,091
Mr. G?

1394
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:07,760
Curley, I made it.
I'm ready to go.

1395
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:09,094
You're too late, man.

1396
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:10,304
Let me talk to Dorothea.

1397
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:12,598
No, no, no, man.
She don't play that.

1398
01:13:12,806 --> 01:13:16,060
These rappers act like...
Who let this lunatic in here?

1399
01:13:16,227 --> 01:13:18,145
Listen, you gotta give me another chance.

1400
01:13:18,354 --> 01:13:21,357
This is my band.
I decide who plays.

1401
01:13:21,524 --> 01:13:23,234
And if you don't go with me,

1402
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:25,694
you'll be making the biggest
mistake of your career.

1403
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:28,781
Yeah? Why's that?

1404
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,243
My only purpose on this planet is to play.

1405
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:35,663
It's what I was meant to do.
And nothing's gonna stop me.

1406
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,628
Well, aren't you an arrogant one?

1407
01:13:42,795 --> 01:13:45,714
I guess you really are a jazz player.

1408
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:48,926
Tell Robert he's out. For now.

1409
01:13:50,094 --> 01:13:51,387
Nice suit.

1410
01:14:01,272 --> 01:14:05,109
Get ready, Joe Gardner,
your life is about to start.

1411
01:15:22,186 --> 01:15:24,313
Welcome to the quartet, Teach.

1412
01:15:28,651 --> 01:15:30,528
That's my Joey!

1413
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:37,326
-What a show!
-That last solo was brilliant.

1414
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:38,494
That was amazing!

1415
01:15:38,661 --> 01:15:39,995
I'm not gonna cover
that bridge for you again.

1416
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:41,747
-Whoo! Later, Mr. G.
-Congratulations.

1417
01:15:41,914 --> 01:15:43,624
You did great. We love you.

1418
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:44,708
I'm so proud of you, Joey.

1419
01:15:44,834 --> 01:15:47,211
Gotta get to bed. We old.

1420
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:52,341
You play 100 shows,
and one of them is killer.

1421
01:15:52,508 --> 01:15:54,385
You don't get many like tonight.

1422
01:15:54,552 --> 01:15:55,845
Yeah.

1423
01:15:56,887 --> 01:15:59,223
So, what happens next?

1424
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:02,643
We come back tomorrow night
and do it all again.

1425
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,438
What's wrong, Teach?

1426
01:16:07,523 --> 01:16:12,820
It's just I've been waiting
on this day for my entire life.

1427
01:16:15,406 --> 01:16:17,283
I thought I'd feel different.

1428
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:22,580
I heard this story about a fish.

1429
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:25,541
He swims up to this older fish and says,

1430
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:28,502
"I'm trying to find this thing
they call the ocean."

1431
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:30,754
"The ocean?" says the older fish.

1432
01:16:30,838 --> 01:16:32,298
"That's what you're in right now."

1433
01:16:32,464 --> 01:16:35,676
"This?" says the young fish.
"This is water.

1434
01:16:35,843 --> 01:16:38,762
"What I want is the ocean."

1435
01:16:41,682 --> 01:16:43,392
See you tomorrow.

1436
01:16:56,322 --> 01:16:58,240
-Hey, man.
-Sorry.

1437
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:31,078
Maybe sky-watching can be my spark.

1438
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:33,497
Or walking.
I'm really good at walking.

1439
01:20:33,664 --> 01:20:35,416
Those really aren't purposes, 22.

1440
01:20:35,499 --> 01:20:37,251
That's just regular old living.

1441
01:21:23,964 --> 01:21:25,508
Joe?

1442
01:21:26,342 --> 01:21:27,426
Joe!

1443
01:21:27,593 --> 01:21:30,054
Good heavens, man.
What are you doing in the zone?

1444
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:33,682
Moonwind. I messed up.
I need to find 22.

1445
01:21:33,849 --> 01:21:37,144
I'm afraid she's become a lost soul.

1446
01:21:37,311 --> 01:21:38,854
-What?
-I'll explain on the way.

1447
01:21:41,815 --> 01:21:43,317
When neither of you returned
to The Half Note,

1448
01:21:43,484 --> 01:21:44,944
I suspected something had gone wrong.

1449
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:49,073
I came back here,
and that's when I spotted her.

1450
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:55,621
Lost souls are obsessed by something
that disconnects them from life.

1451
01:21:55,788 --> 01:21:59,041
And now that 22 has technically lived,
she's become one of them.

1452
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:00,668
-There!
-Good show.

1453
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:08,592
22!

1454
01:22:11,637 --> 01:22:13,430
-Ready the net.
-I'm on it.

1455
01:22:25,734 --> 01:22:26,861
She's got us!

1456
01:22:30,281 --> 01:22:31,282
Moonwind!

1457
01:22:31,365 --> 01:22:32,992
A captain always
goes down with the ship.

1458
01:22:33,158 --> 01:22:34,326
It has been a...

1459
01:22:40,249 --> 01:22:41,250
22!

1460
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,837
Come back, 22. It's me, Joe.

1461
01:22:47,131 --> 01:22:48,340
Easy, 22, easy.

1462
01:22:48,507 --> 01:22:51,635
I just came back to give you this.

1463
01:22:54,013 --> 01:22:55,014
Easy.

1464
01:22:56,682 --> 01:22:58,684
22, listen. Come back!

1465
01:23:02,313 --> 01:23:04,982
And for correcting
our absent-minded mistakes

1466
01:23:05,065 --> 01:23:06,150
and setting the count right,

1467
01:23:06,317 --> 01:23:10,446
we are awarding you, Terry, this trophy.
As you requested.

1468
01:23:11,906 --> 01:23:15,284
I am happy to accept this
very special award I requested,

1469
01:23:15,451 --> 01:23:18,078
but that I absolutely deserve.

1470
01:23:21,123 --> 01:23:22,166
Joe Gardner?

1471
01:23:22,249 --> 01:23:23,250
And I'll just take that back.

1472
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:24,418
Hey.

1473
01:23:26,045 --> 01:23:29,340
Oi, noob!
You're not where you belong.

1474
01:23:35,846 --> 01:23:37,640
22, stop.
I have something to tell you.

1475
01:23:39,517 --> 01:23:42,144
Stop that. No.

1476
01:23:44,772 --> 01:23:46,148
22!

1477
01:23:47,149 --> 01:23:48,526
Whoa, watch out!

1478
01:23:48,692 --> 01:23:49,860
Take it easy.

1479
01:23:49,944 --> 01:23:50,986
-There, there.
-There's no need to be afraid.

1480
01:23:51,195 --> 01:23:53,322
Don't worry. Calm down.

1481
01:23:53,489 --> 01:23:55,407
You have to stop running. Please.

1482
01:23:55,574 --> 01:23:56,909
22, stop.

1483
01:23:57,159 --> 01:23:58,410
22, I was wrong.

1484
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:03,415
Please, will you listen?
You are ready to live, 22.

1485
01:24:16,428 --> 01:24:18,389
I'm not good enough. Nope. No.

1486
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:19,974
Nothing. I just need to
fill out that last box.

1487
01:24:20,057 --> 01:24:21,058
22!

1488
01:24:22,142 --> 01:24:23,269
You're dishonest.

1489
01:24:23,352 --> 01:24:24,770
All you make are bad decisions.

1490
01:24:24,937 --> 01:24:26,856
You are unwise and you won't
make it in the world.

1491
01:24:26,939 --> 01:24:27,982
You're so selfish.

1492
01:24:28,065 --> 01:24:29,108
No one would ever want to be around you.

1493
01:24:29,191 --> 01:24:30,317
Loser.

1494
01:24:30,484 --> 01:24:32,653
The world needs remarkable people

1495
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:35,739
and you are the least
remarkable soul I've ever met.

1496
01:24:36,031 --> 01:24:37,867
You'll never find your spark.

1497
01:24:38,033 --> 01:24:39,034
Imbecile.

1498
01:24:39,201 --> 01:24:40,744
I cannot help you.

1499
01:24:40,828 --> 01:24:41,871
22!

1500
01:24:42,037 --> 01:24:43,622
I just need to fill out that last box.

1501
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:44,915
I'm not good enough at all.

1502
01:24:45,207 --> 01:24:46,959
You will never find your spark.

1503
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:48,419
There's no point.

1504
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,046
Those aren't purposes,
you idiot.

1505
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:52,715
That's just regular old living.

1506
01:24:52,882 --> 01:24:54,341
This is a waste of time.

1507
01:24:54,508 --> 01:24:56,927
You only got that badge
because you were in my body.

1508
01:24:57,094 --> 01:24:58,929
That's why you ruin everything.

1509
01:24:59,096 --> 01:25:01,765
Because you have no purpose.

1510
01:25:07,271 --> 01:25:09,523
No, no, no.

1511
01:25:18,949 --> 01:25:20,409
There's no point.

1512
01:25:20,576 --> 01:25:22,286
You'll never find your spark.

1513
01:25:22,995 --> 01:25:26,582
Because you have no purpose!

1514
01:25:33,923 --> 01:25:36,342
I'm not good. Nope.

1515
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:39,762
Nothing. I just need to fill
out that last box. I give up.

1516
01:25:51,398 --> 01:25:52,441
You ready?

1517
01:25:54,026 --> 01:25:55,319
To come live.

1518
01:25:57,863 --> 01:25:59,114
I'm scared, Joe.

1519
01:26:00,366 --> 01:26:01,659
I'm not good enough.

1520
01:26:02,743 --> 01:26:05,412
Anyway, I never got my spark.

1521
01:26:05,788 --> 01:26:07,081
Yes, you did.

1522
01:26:13,629 --> 01:26:16,090
Your spark isn't your purpose.

1523
01:26:16,257 --> 01:26:19,927
That last box fills in
when you're ready to come live.

1524
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:22,888
And, the thing is

1525
01:26:23,973 --> 01:26:26,350
you're pretty great at jazzing.

1526
01:26:55,963 --> 01:26:56,964
But, Joe,

1527
01:26:57,673 --> 01:26:59,049
this means you won't get to...

1528
01:26:59,216 --> 01:27:02,094
It's okay. I already did.

1529
01:27:02,261 --> 01:27:04,013
Now it's your turn.

1530
01:27:10,269 --> 01:27:11,395
I'll go with you.

1531
01:27:11,896 --> 01:27:13,272
You know you can't do that.

1532
01:27:13,772 --> 01:27:16,692
I know.
But I'll go as far as I can.

1533
01:27:31,498 --> 01:27:33,501
Hey! Take a look!

1534
01:27:42,176 --> 01:27:43,427
Wow!

1535
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:57,334
Mr. Gardner?

1536
01:28:58,878 --> 01:28:59,879
Yes?

1537
01:28:59,962 --> 01:29:01,172
Do you have a moment?

1538
01:29:02,339 --> 01:29:05,843
I think I'm speaking for all the Jerrys
when I say thank you.

1539
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,261
For what?

1540
01:29:07,428 --> 01:29:09,221
We're in the business of inspiration, Joe,

1541
01:29:09,305 --> 01:29:12,016
but it's not often
we find ourselves inspired.

1542
01:29:12,474 --> 01:29:13,976
Really?

1543
01:29:14,143 --> 01:29:17,688
So, we all decided to give you
another chance.

1544
01:29:22,401 --> 01:29:25,321
Hopefully, you will watch
where you walk from now on.

1545
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:27,990
But what about Terry?

1546
01:29:28,157 --> 01:29:29,658
We worked it out with Terry.

1547
01:29:32,411 --> 01:29:33,579
That's weird.

1548
01:29:33,662 --> 01:29:34,788
Hey, Terry, what's that over there?

1549
01:29:34,872 --> 01:29:35,915
Look immediately.

1550
01:29:35,998 --> 01:29:36,999
What? What are you talking about?

1551
01:29:37,082 --> 01:29:39,043
Nothing. You were saying?

1552
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:40,961
Were you even talking?
I can't remember.

1553
01:29:41,128 --> 01:29:42,254
Never mind.

1554
01:29:43,839 --> 01:29:44,840
Well?

1555
01:29:51,347 --> 01:29:52,556
Thanks.

1556
01:29:52,681 --> 01:29:54,808
So what do you think you'll do?

1557
01:29:55,017 --> 01:29:56,560
How are you gonna spend your life?

1558
01:29:57,186 --> 01:29:58,771
I'm not sure.

1559
01:30:02,024 --> 01:30:03,567
But I do know...

1560
01:30:07,905 --> 01:30:10,699
I'm going to live every minute of it.

1561
01:40:29,068 --> 01:40:31,028
Hey! Movie's over.

1562
01:40:31,195 --> 01:40:32,571
Go home!
