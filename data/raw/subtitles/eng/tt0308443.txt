1
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,318
Another spectacular performance
by George Patrick Owens.

2
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,722
The Scottish Rocket,
pushing the ball off the field....

3
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,559
He shoots, he's deflected, he shoots!

4
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,567
Enough with George already!

5
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,762
Score!

6
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,965
Boys!

7
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,805
-Play dead.
-Are you okay?

8
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,281
Now, needing no introduction,
on the floor in front of me...

9
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,476
weighing a total of 92 pounds...

10
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,111
the wrecking balls of peace and quiet...

11
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,350
the twin tornados of home destruction--

12
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,548
I need help here.

13
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,556
-Dylan, Cole, just get up.
-Anybody hurt?

14
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:47,196
You drive me crazy
when you pull these crazy stunts.

15
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,359
You could have split your head open,
and just look at Grandma's table.

16
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,735
Mom, get a grip.

17
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,604
It's your cute, adorable twins.

18
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,913
Look at these innocent
little puppy-dog faces.

19
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,439
It looks like you got your first shiner.
You'll need some ice on that.

20
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,043
I'll get it. You take care of the table.

21
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,018
I see you guys
liked watching the game again...

22
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,719
for the 200,000th time.

23
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,025
George Patrick Owens
is only the greatest soccer player...

24
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,894
that ever played the game.

25
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,957
The last score he took....

26
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:27,035
He was 10 feet off the ground.
Nobody human can do that.

27
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,974
He might not be human.
But unlike Bigfoot, we got him on tape.

28
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,641
Incredible. Thanks again, Dad.

29
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,447
-We're back.
-And we bad.

30
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,111
Wait a minute, Termiteinators.

31
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,849
Just 'cause you don't have concussions...

32
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,255
doesn't mean
you don't have to clean this mess.

33
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,387
I mean, that table there
is a family heirloom belonging to....

34
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,793
-Grandma.
-Grandma, of course.

35
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,925
So it's very important to your mom.
And to me.

36
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,493
And also to you, if you don't destroy it.

37
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,598
I want you to pick up every kernel
of popcorn. I'll get some paper towels.

38
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,607
-One, or both of us, could have been killed.
-Knock it off.

39
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,576
Or at least be bloody and have amnesia.

40
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,781
Just get out of here.

41
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,891
Can't you control them?
They are chips off of that block of yours.

42
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,200
I had to show them
who's boss around the house.

43
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,294
Get real.

44
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,636
We tripped and took a header
on the hair loon and wasted the thing.

45
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,039
By the way, what is a hair loon?

46
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,443
Some of Grandma's old leftover furniture
that we end up thrashing...

47
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,812
so Dad has to keep gluing it back
to keep Mom off his butt.

48
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,024
Hey, Mikey, want to play some soccer?

49
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,693
Can't. Football season's next week.

50
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,940
Dad's got me running laps. See you.

51
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,601
Too bad he's not on the team.
He would kick some butt.

52
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,240
His dad wouldn't even let him.
He says soccer's for wimps.

53
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,579
You know, besides being a cop,
he was a bigtime football star.

54
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,686
But he blew out his knee,
and he's been mad at the world ever since.

55
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,849
Copy that.

56
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,416
So, what are you candy-pants
doing in our park?

57
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,978
-We're practicing.
-What for? The Nutcracker?

58
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:01,220
We're practicing 'cause we're gonna
kick everybody's butts this year.

59
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,227
Especially your team.

60
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,323
Coach says you run so slow, you couldn't
catch a baby with a load in his pants.

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,858
Oh, yeah? I guarantee
I could even kick your coach's butt.

62
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,202
You know what? You got pretty big mouths
for such little people.

63
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,504
You eat with those mouths,
or use them to get your butts kicked?

64
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:21,069
-And who might you be?
-This is my cousin Jason, from Charlotte.

65
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,378
He taught me to play.
He plays for the Yellow Jackets.

66
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,352
We've been state champs forever.
Nobody's ever beaten us.

67
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,851
I can't even remember
the last time somebody scored on us.

68
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,654
Never heard of no Yellow Jackasses.

69
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:39,556
They're the ones who broke that kid's leg
in that game over in Chestnut...

70
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,497
and the doctors had to--

71
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,500
I bet we can take it all,
and even beat you fart-face Yellow Jackets.

72
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,298
I bet you.

73
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,910
Yeah? What's the bet?
I'll call my bookie in Vegas.

74
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,478
If you dorks don't win the championship--

75
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:59,109
If we don't take it all,
I'll moon everybody in homeroom.

76
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,953
-I mean, we will.
-What?

77
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,421
Better yet, there are three teams here.

78
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,220
The team that wins the championship
is clean.

79
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:12,064
The other teams
have to moon the bleachers after the game.

80
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,831
Hold up, half-a-man.

81
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,028
If either of us wins the championship,
you have to moon the crowd.

82
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,571
If you win, then both our teams will do it.

83
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,006
That way, we can see the two of you
wear your mama's sexy underwear.

84
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,305
Better than the skidmark undies you wear.

85
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,370
Shut up, butt faces.
You won't even make it to the semifinals.

86
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,316
You might as well sit your mama's butt
on the side of a bus. It's on?

87
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,813
Did I stutter?

88
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,720
Okay. You got yourself a bet.
And we got ourselves a ball.

89
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,224
You really did it this time, Dyl.

90
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,587
Give the ball back.

91
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,095
-What did you say?
-I said, give it back.

92
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,462
-It's okay. It's just a ball.
-It's not just a ball.

93
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,498
Our dad got it for us in Europe.

94
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,901
It's a game ball from the World Cup match.

95
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:56,567
George Patrick Owens kicked this ball
right before he disappeared.

96
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,907
Gee, little buddy,
it's probably worth something then.

97
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,038
We should probably return it.

98
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,347
-Hey, Mikey. What's up?
-Hey, Russ.

99
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,313
And remember, you've got to drop them.

100
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,450
-Only a coward welshes on a bet, right?
-Right.

101
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,123
Good thing you showed up, Mikey.

102
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,029
Those guys were really starting
to piss us off.

103
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,090
But even if they kicked our butts...

104
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,331
I guarantee
we would've done some serious damage.

105
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,505
And we wouldn't want that to happen now,
would we?

106
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,871
-Michael, what did we agree to do today?
-To run my laps.

107
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,438
That's right, son, run laps!
That does not mean stopping and talking.

108
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,781
Talking does not score touchdowns.

109
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,787
I want to see some hustle out there,
young man.

110
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,753
Move it! Hustle!

111
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,244
My shirt. That creepy guy greased me.

112
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,118
Man, think of the germs!

113
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,651
That's an old shirt.
When did you start worrying about germs?

114
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,493
I know. I saw you eat
that doughnut off the ground the other day.

115
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,033
-The five-second rule.
-What?

116
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,194
If you pick it up within five seconds,
it's good to go.

117
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,068
Okay, that's totally disgusting.

118
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,101
Suit yourself, honey.

119
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,708
I'll get it.

120
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,282
Guys, I have some bad news.

121
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,889
Dad has to go out of town for a few days.

122
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,853
Listen. Remember, you work for me, okay?

123
00:09:56,295 --> 00:10:00,322
You were still decorating your diapers
when I won my first Purple Heart.

124
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,799
I know you love that story, but it's true.

125
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,167
Listen, I feel bad
because I have to leave the kids.

126
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm sure they will be proud of me.

127
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,200
It doesn't matter right now. How soon?

128
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,878
You got to be kidding me.

129
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,950
He feels really bad, but he'll miss
your first couple of soccer practices.

130
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,816
-No way!
-Not now!

131
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,412
Right, I understand. I'll see you soon.

132
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,424
-So, what's the deal, Presscott?
-I've got to go to D.C. It's an emergency.

133
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:33,261
Yeah, but what about the team?
You're our coach, man.

134
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,357
What are we supposed to do?

135
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,665
I'm sorry,
but somebody needs my help really bad.

136
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,433
But we had a deal.

137
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,839
This is the last time it's ever gonna happen.
I'm up for reassignment.

138
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,742
But you can't go! You're our coach...

139
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,411
and practice starts on Monday.

140
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,677
-lt sucks like a tornado.
-Don't talk like that.

141
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,882
Listen, guys, it's only for a few days.

142
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,059
Boy, that was quick. That's my cue.
I've got to go.

143
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,062
I love you guys,
and I promise to make it up to you.

144
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,898
Listen, Mom has a roster with the names
and numbers of all the guys...

145
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,001
that can help coach while I'm gone.
It's gonna be okay.

146
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,172
-I love you guys, and I'll be back soon.
-Bye, honey.

147
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,152
-Come on, guys, give me a hug.
-Get in there.

148
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,447
I love you, boys.

149
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,661
He has no idea....

150
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,963
How important this is to us.

151
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,069
Guys, when life--

152
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,474
If you try that line about life,
lemons and lemonade...

153
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,737
I'll lose it.

154
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:59,178
All right. How about I just promise
that we'll do the best that we can?

155
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,481
We'll make it work, all right?

156
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,050
What an ugly ending to a beautiful day!

157
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,950
Corner kick.

158
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,157
Boys, we have to hurry.

159
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,836
Are you sure you called everyone
on the list?

160
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,105
Did you forget anybody?

161
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,873
Let's see.

162
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,545
Dexter's dad had to work.

163
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,510
Mr. Hunsucker had a furniture convention.

164
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,743
Mr. Pope hurt his back again.

165
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,249
Mr. Wickham has a big law case.

166
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:39,449
Mr. and Mrs. Foldes have to
look at real estate. And Mr. Whaley's fishing.

167
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,389
Everybody else said no.

168
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,088
Look, it's only for a few days.

169
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,458
And I have something for you.
It's from New York.

170
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,066
"Dear loved ones...

171
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,629
"l need a break from the Big Apple,
and will be coming to visit.

172
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,143
"l need the family love,
and I miss my little monkeys.

173
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,878
-"Much love, Aunt Louise."
-Aunt Louise is coming back?

174
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,875
-But it doesn't say when.
-She never says when.

175
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,985
That's probably why Dad calls her a flake.

176
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,985
All right, guys, let's go. We're gonna be late.

177
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,685
-We're gonna ride our bikes.
-See you there.

178
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,529
Wait a minute.

179
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,768
I left the lights on again. God.

180
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,258
Showtime.

181
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,833
Louise!

182
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,898
Sis, I'm so glad to see you.
Hop in, we have to go.

183
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,467
-Where we going?
-You won't believe it.

184
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,204
Did you drive here
all the way from New York?

185
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,181
-Yes.
-God, I missed you.

186
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,752
I'm so glad you're here. It's nuts.

187
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,383
So now I'm the coach
until Presscott gets home.

188
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,792
Any cute single dads?

189
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,036
I'm scared to death,
but the kids need me to take over.

190
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,771
My babies are riding their bicycles
to their first practice...

191
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,536
because their goofy mom's
been forced into coaching...

192
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,545
and they're too embarrassed
to arrive in the same van as me.

193
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,871
Can I have your attention?

194
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,017
May I have your attention, please?
Thank you.

195
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,990
I'm your coach, Mandy Martin.

196
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,325
I thought our coach was a Mr. Martin.

197
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,664
You're not a mister.

198
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,036
Yeah, misters don't have boobs.

199
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,608
My husband is your coach.

200
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,167
But he had to go away on business
for a few days.

201
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,713
So I'm going to fill in until he returns.

202
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,784
-And who is she?
-She's my little sister.

203
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,711
Nothing little about her.

204
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,717
If she's little, I'm a T-Rex.

205
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,787
You best mind your manners, young man.

206
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,628
-What does she do?
-Let's just say she's my assistant.

207
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,634
We can't have a bunch of women
telling us what to do.

208
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,068
We'll be laughed off the field.

209
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,163
For your information...

210
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:46,544
I just flew from overseas,
where I was training Olympic athletes...

211
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,840
in motion and dance technique.

212
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:53,816
I thought I'd teach you a few training tricks,
but everyone has such a snotty attitude.

213
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,853
I'll just take my big-hearted talents
somewhere where I'm more appreciated.

214
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,359
But before I leave,
I just wanted to say hi to my nephews...

215
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,954
Dylan and Cole.

216
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,688
Okay, guys.

217
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,616
That's it for today. Any questions?

218
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,092
I'll assume that's a rhetorical question...

219
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,432
and if anybody speaks flatulence,
and would like to translate--

220
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,097
When are we gonna get to play soccer?

221
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,302
A question I can answer.

222
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,539
Please pick up your game schedule
from Louise as you leave.

223
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,008
Don't forget to memorize
the A.Y.S.O.'s six pillars of character.

224
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,116
Trustworthiness. Respect.

225
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,846
Responsibility.

226
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,752
Caring.

227
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,955
Fairness.

228
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,061
Citizenship.

229
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,595
Don't forget, do your homework...

230
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:25,534
eat your vegetables, get plenty of sleep,
brush your teeth.

231
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,763
And please make sure your parents
read the Kid Zone guidelines...

232
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,505
on the back of the schedule,
before they tape it to the refrigerator.

233
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,046
And remember...

234
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:39,807
when you are out there playing soccer,
that field is yours.

235
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,812
It's your time, okay?

236
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,687
See you next time. Pick up a schedule.

237
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,061
-Excuse me.
-Give me one.

238
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,299
I just wish Presscott hadn't left.

239
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:01,166
Yeah, on-the-job training blows.

240
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,031
Jeez, Louise!

241
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,534
I'm trying to not let the boys talk like that.

242
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,739
Okay, sorry, Grandma.

243
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,944
Should I go wash my mouth out with soap?

244
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,782
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,451
I guess I'm just an overprotective mother
who wants to keep an eye on her boys.

246
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,116
I'm not a coach.

247
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,386
I'm a case study.

248
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,022
Who the heck is that?

249
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,125
I don't know.
He helped me start the van this morning.

250
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,602
I'm gonna ask Presscott about him.

251
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,300
Creepy.

252
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,869
I'll get it. It's probably Dad.

253
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,000
-Hey, Mikey.
-Hey, Miss Louise. You're back.

254
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:49,076
-Hey, Mrs. Martin.
-Hey, Mikey. Where have you been hiding?

255
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,277
Football season.
They're working me pretty hard this year.

256
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,022
I thought that was my dad.
I better get home.

257
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:03,355
-His dad drives him way too hard.
-Yeah, his dad is a jerk.

258
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,056
No, he's just not a very happy guy.

259
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,860
It was Dad all right.

260
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,868
He's not gonna make it
before our first game.

261
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,932
Yeah, he skunked us.

262
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,941
Okay, guys, you've worked your butts off
these last two weeks.

263
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,041
Today's payback time.

264
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,313
How about a round of applause for Louise,
for helping whip this team into shape.

265
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:32,588
All right! Let's show them what we got.
Come on, go!

266
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,959
No, the other way! Our goal is down there.

267
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,395
Kick it!

268
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,855
Go, kick it.

269
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:15,357
The other way. Our goal is on this end. Go!

270
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,564
He tripped him! No. Help him up.

271
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:23,204
-What time is it?
-Why?

272
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,470
I want to go home to watch TV.

273
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,278
Get out there and play ball!

274
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,840
Hey, ref, how much time is left in this game?

275
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,848
Just one minute, cutie. I mean, Coach.

276
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,530
See you here on Monday.
We play the Roosters.

277
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,501
-I hear they're pushovers.
-Cut the crap, Coach.

278
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,061
They beat the Pirates by 10 points,
and the Dynamos by 12.

279
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,299
We've had it.

280
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,400
Thanks for that inspiring pep talk, Sal.

281
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,607
See you here Monday.

282
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,076
I'm the worst thing
that ever happened to soccer.

283
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,985
It's the world's fastest-growing youth sport,
and I've set it all back 25 years.

284
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,390
Don't be mad at yourself, Mom.

285
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,620
It's not really you. The whole team stinks.

286
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,855
You never claimed to be a soccer coach.

287
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,524
-We need Dad.
-I know.

288
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,428
Don't be mad at him, please.

289
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,405
I'm sure he's trying to finish up his work
and get home to you.

290
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,169
Look, messages. Maybe one of them's him.

291
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,037
Hey, I know nobody's there, but listen...

292
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,740
I had to leave the country for a while
on business.

293
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,613
I know I broke my promise,
but I won't do it again.

294
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,676
I know soccer's going great,
and you guys are kicking butt.

295
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,212
I love you all, and I'll be there soon.
I'm very sorry.

296
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,992
You're always being told
not to trust strangers...

297
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,589
and we can't even trust our own dad.

298
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,367
-We're gonna clean out the van.
-Stay here. I'll handle this one.

299
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,106
Mrs. Martin, this is Sterling's mother.

300
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,809
I wanted to let you know that Sterling
won't be playing on the team anymore.

301
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,214
Thank you.

302
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,951
I don't know what kind of team
you're running...

303
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,319
but you don't sound like
the real thing to me.

304
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,450
Sal ain't playing for no team
run by some den mothers.

305
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,585
If I want him to get his butt whooped...

306
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,756
I'd send him off to join the Marines,
like I did.

307
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,528
Hello, this is Eduardo from the team.

308
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,230
I was talking
to some of the other guys tonight.

309
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,903
I don't think I want to play anymore.

310
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,872
Thanks. Bye.

311
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,910
And my dad says that
when you get a real coach, to call us back.

312
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,756
It'll be okay. I used my Aunt Louise magic.

313
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,724
Then go and use your magic,
and tell them that half the team just quit.

314
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,858
I don't blame them.
I wouldn't want to play for me, either.

315
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,733
Oh, please.
I'll talk to them when they come in.

316
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:09,467
You go take a hot bath,
and I'll bring you some tea.

317
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,706
Thank you.

318
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,723
No way!

319
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,769
They ran right in front of me.

320
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,270
-That man, he saved us!
-Who?

321
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,484
Okay, let's get you guys inside.

322
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,077
They're fine.
I think they're just a little shaken.

323
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,554
-All right.
-Thank you.

324
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:03,458
-We got to find this guy tomorrow.
-Man, we're gonna find him.

325
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,728
Is he over there?

326
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,836
What if he's on the left side?

327
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,181
He's on the right side. Bet you.

328
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,969
Did you see that?

329
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,108
-Hello under there.
-Leave me alone.

330
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,705
-Can we help you with anything?
-No. Go away.

331
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:35,309
-Thanks for saving our butts.
-Yeah, we would have been road pizzas.

332
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,821
You thanked me. Now go away.

333
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,052
I just want to talk about
those incredible moves.

334
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,451
They were awesome.
I've never seen anybody kick like that.

335
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,964
-You didn't see no kicks.
-Yes, we did.

336
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,627
-You did not.
-Did, too.

337
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,259
No kicks.

338
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:57,106
We didn't see any kicks,
but whatever you did was really cool.

339
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,206
I tripped and fell down. It was an accident.

340
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,375
-I wish I could have accidents like that.
-We told all our friends.

341
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,517
-Why did you tell everybody?
-Because we love soccer.

342
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,128
We didn't start off loving soccer at first.
We wanted to play basketball.

343
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,195
We're just too short. And baseball....

344
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,664
See these glasses? I'm blind as a bat.

345
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,532
Once I swung at a hotdog wrapper
that blew away.

346
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,766
But the truth of the matter is
we stunk at it all.

347
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,365
-Hitting, catching--
-And football.

348
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,839
We weigh about 50 pounds each.

349
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,645
We could hang-glide in a tortilla chip.

350
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,775
But since we were kids,
we wanted to be like Dad.

351
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,217
He played everything
in high school and college.

352
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,914
And was good at it all.

353
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,923
He even used to fly jet planes for the Navy.

354
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,753
We would never get too close to a Navy jet,
but soccer....

355
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,356
We did make the soccer team.

356
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,832
We're gonna fill up our shelves
with trophies, just like Dad.

357
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,065
What do you expect me to do about it?

358
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,073
Coming!

359
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,978
Hi, guys. I'm sorry about the team. We tried.

360
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:21,025
That's life, Mrs. Martin.
Are the terrible two at home?

361
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,584
No. I thought they were off with you.
They didn't show at the arcade?

362
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:28,393
Mrs. Martin, are they all right in the head?

363
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,536
I know they were really upset
about the team.

364
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,129
Why? Do you think something's wrong?

365
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:40,069
I think they've completely lost it.
All they talked about in school today...

366
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:43,079
was this soccer dude
who materialized out of nowhere...

367
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:46,208
kicked a million balls into the van,
saved their lives...

368
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,047
and then disappeared.

369
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,986
What's that expression
that your mother uses?

370
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,453
Esta loca.

371
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,862
So that's how my mom got sucked in.

372
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,093
If my dad were here, he'd have a solution.

373
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,160
-But he went out of the country.
-Out of the country?

374
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,365
And to top it off,
we got phone messages from the guys.

375
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,534
Everybody bailed.
Now we don't even have a team.

376
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,739
-No team?
-That's it.

377
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,338
So we had to forfeit
to the Roosters this week.

378
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,815
'Cause we didn't have enough players.

379
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,409
-By the way, I'm Dylan.
-And I'm Cole.

380
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,980
-Dylan.
-And Cole Martin.

381
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,824
Hi, I'm Rudy.

382
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,695
Since we need a coach--

383
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,289
And since you're gonna be here for a while--

384
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,267
-No.
-Why not?

385
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,338
Y'all don't understand.

386
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:46,810
We understand. You're just too busy
being Mr. Greaseball Adult Guy...

387
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,575
to come spend some time out
with these poor little kids...

388
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,083
-who have a mother for a coach.
-We wouldn't want anybody...

389
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,985
who can do a bicycle kick
four feet off the ground.

390
00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:01,082
We're just happy with Mom,
whose main concern is wiping our noses.

391
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,886
-Thanks a lot, mister--
-Wait.

392
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,692
All right.

393
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:16,640
-What's the one thing you want to learn?
-I want to learn how to fake people out.

394
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,472
I can't head the ball.

395
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,479
All right. Let's go, little partners.

396
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:28,275
All right, little fella, I want you over here.

397
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,878
Sonny boy, get over there.

398
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:35,017
All right, bend your knees.
On the balls of your feet.

399
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,960
Move your head like this,
like you're a chicken.

400
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,396
You're a chicken.
You're a funky chicken. You ready?

401
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,897
This ain't volleyball. It's soccer.
Let's try you, all right?

402
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,199
That's right, you're a chicken.

403
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,806
There you go. Imitate your brother.

404
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,866
You ready? That's right.

405
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,043
We'll work on passing now.

406
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,950
Where are they? It's getting late.

407
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,387
-I talked to Mikey's dad, the cop.
-Not in that outfit, I hope.

408
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:11,355
He hasn't seen them, and said
you should keep a better eye on them.

409
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:12,818
Spare me.

410
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,333
We know how sensitive
and compassionate he can be.

411
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,026
Sorry we're late, Mom.

412
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,766
Dylan and Cole Martin,
you can't just disappear like that.

413
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,205
Where have you been?

414
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,641
We found the best soccer player
in the world...

415
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,680
and he's only four doors down,
living in Dr. Peter's garage.

416
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:33,046
-You should see him!
-Dr. Peter's garage?

417
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,780
What I want to see right now
is the two of you in the bathtub.

418
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,414
-No, not that!
-Please.

419
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,883
And after you're cleaned up,
I want to see you buried in your homework.

420
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,294
You know how much we love homework.

421
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,059
Then could we clean our room?

422
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,293
And then we can iron the sheets, too.

423
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,064
-And then wash the car.
-And then paint the walls.

424
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,935
-And then dust the floors.
-How about shining the silver?

425
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,534
-And then scrub the tables.
-And then alphabetize the books.

426
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,936
Now, you know what to do.

427
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,275
We take this basket
over to Mrs. Hubbard's house...

428
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:10,112
even though she calls us
out-of-control little hoodlums.

429
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,520
We tell her not to get up, and she wouldn't...

430
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,889
because she's a hypochondriac
and a sourpuss anyway.

431
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,727
You didn't hear that in this house.

432
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:23,199
We shove the meatloaf into the refrigerator,
although it's already full.

433
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,398
We put the other dish into the oven,
but we don't turn it on.

434
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,702
We leave the brownies on the counter...

435
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,438
and be sure to ask her
about her swollen ankles...

436
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,544
her blood pressure, and her burglar alarm.

437
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,647
I am so proud of you boys.

438
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,618
-We're ready to rock and roll!
-What?

439
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,589
-You must be getting old.
-Yeah, Rudy.

440
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,559
You're losing your memory. That's sad.

441
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:01,028
-Why do you like to bug people so much?
-Because we're good at it.

442
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,542
Yes, you are.

443
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:15,685
That was better. A whole lot better.

444
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,421
Really? No bull?

445
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:23,120
No, but it's getting late.

446
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,259
You stay out too long,
it's gonna worry your mama.

447
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,092
She doesn't care.

448
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,364
Actually, she's very thankful.

449
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,206
She sent you some of her home cooking
as a thank-you present.

450
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,544
It's been a while
since I've had home cooking.

451
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,682
Nothing like a home-cooked meal.

452
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,249
So, you really knew George Patrick Owens?

453
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,892
The real Scottish Rocket?

454
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,488
-No way, José!
-Way.

455
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,463
He's the best soccer player ever.

456
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,296
I always thought he was a bit overrated
and kind of strange.

457
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,705
Good-looking guy, though.

458
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,531
The ladies loved him.

459
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,976
If I tell you something,
you promise not to tell anybody?

460
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,773
We promise.

461
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,043
You mustn't tell anybody.

462
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,253
He's in danger, and was forced to disappear.

463
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,324
Why was he forced to disappear?

464
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,388
Some criminals tried to make him play bad...

465
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,731
-so Scotland would lose the cup to ltaly.
-Why?

466
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,705
Sometimes people make big-money bets
on games.

467
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,698
Heck.

468
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,646
George Patrick,
he played the best game of his life.

469
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,941
Beat the tar out of them ltalians.

470
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,382
Some bigtime criminals got pretty upset.

471
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,251
So mad that they tried to kill him.

472
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,349
But Rocket, he could run.

473
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,057
So he hid.

474
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,789
How long does he have to hide?

475
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,661
One day, when the coast is clear...

476
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,558
George Patrick will come back.

477
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,660
But that can take forever.

478
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:17,140
We got his last game on tape.
Our dad got it for us.

479
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,077
That last play he made....

480
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,570
That was the best play he ever made.

481
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,246
Yo, twin pimples,
we missed stomping you guys at the game.

482
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,155
You were so scared, you had to forfeit.

483
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,089
We're looking forward
to the Thanksgiving game. Aren't you?

484
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:41,461
I could just see
your wimpy little moons rising now.

485
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,870
We're gonna make a comeback.
We have a secret weapon.

486
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,537
Wait till you see him in action, dude.

487
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,009
You'll pee in your jeans, turkey!

488
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,539
Haven't you got us into enough trouble?

489
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,845
Yeah, nobody wants to hear
about your stupid phantom soccer player.

490
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,886
But, you guys, I swear he's the best.

491
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,748
I just promised not to talk about him.

492
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,620
But I know you guys
can keep a secret, right?

493
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,124
He knows George Patrick Owens.

494
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,997
What? You don't believe me?

495
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,872
Dylan, remember the time
you guys kept seeing the black bear...

496
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,998
over by the woods, in the golf course?

497
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,340
-lt looked like a bear.
-lt was a St. Bernard.

498
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,469
It was big and hairy, and--

499
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,984
Come with me after school,
and we'll take you to his house.

500
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,881
No way, he'll freak.

501
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,321
I'll believe anything
that would allow me to think...

502
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,722
that I wouldn't have to moon the crowd.

503
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:45,489
-Come on, you guys, it'll be great.
-Dylan, don't do this.

504
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,396
You heard what he said. Man, count me out.

505
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,064
You guys wait here.

506
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,646
Let's go.

507
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,949
No, come on, you guys, let's hang out.
I know he'll be back here any minute.

508
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,188
You hang out. I'm out of here.

509
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,828
Yeah, the soccer phantom
ought to be here any century now.

510
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,365
-What did you tell them?
-Nothing.

511
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,868
Well, just a little of it.

512
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,037
You promised me.

513
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,173
Now you can't be trusted. Leave me alone.

514
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:44,349
But they wouldn't believe us.
I only wanted to help.

515
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,819
-Come on, please.
-Go away. Now, get!

516
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,616
Get out!

517
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,567
Boys?

518
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,847
Dylan, I can't believe you did that.
He was like our savior.

519
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,312
If you say so, Colester.

520
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,643
What are we gonna do?

521
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,417
No team. No coach. No skill.

522
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,292
And pretty soon, no pants.

523
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,360
So you gentlemen want to learn soccer?

524
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,129
I don't get it. This is the soccer player?

525
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:37,665
-The phantom?
-Yeah. This is Rudy.

526
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,575
Rudy, these are our pals, Eduardo and Sal.

527
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,248
How you doing?

528
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,258
Anybody home?

529
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,317
Hello?

530
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,801
Anybody home?

531
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,350
I'll teach you real good.

532
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,420
That over yonder is a goal.

533
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,854
I want you to dribble and pass the ball.

534
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,291
Wait a minute. That's not a goal.

535
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,154
That's just a couple of trash cans.

536
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,502
Looks like a goal to me.

537
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,104
Now go to it.

538
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,863
Let's play.

539
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,966
Over here! Come on!

540
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,010
What are they doing?

541
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,917
That hurt.

542
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,491
-You play?
-I play football.

543
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,693
Kick it.

544
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,835
Why do you call it "football"?

545
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,997
That game, you don't ever
hardly even use your feet.

546
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,707
-Over here. Come on, pass.
-Oh, man.

547
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,406
I'll show you football.

548
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,746
No, daggummit. Give me the ball.

549
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,517
-Look at that.
-This here, this is real football.

550
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,057
-He's good.
-Juggling...

551
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,824
trapping, dribbling.

552
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,499
All right, you guys got that?
Who wants the ball?

553
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,000
Me!

554
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,602
Okay. Good catch. All right.
How you doing?

555
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:54,004
-I don't know if I could ever do that.
-Then you play goalie.

556
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,407
Pass the ball. Good pass. Pass it again.

557
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,551
Go, Eduardo.

558
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,491
To the goal.

559
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:12,061
-All right. Good save.
-Come on. Pass.

560
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,359
Right on center. Good pass.

561
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,992
Wait. You turn around,
you're gonna lift the ball.

562
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,764
Keep going, you got one more shot. Shoot.

563
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,771
Good save again. All right, here you go.

564
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,569
All right, y'all whippersnappers,
you done good.

565
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,446
I gots to be going.

566
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,753
-See you, guys.
-Bye!

567
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,916
See you, Eduardo.

568
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,523
What y'all following me for?

569
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,399
I ain't the Pied Piper.

570
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,637
What the hell is going on here?
Greaseball, I'm talking to you.

571
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,178
What the hell's going on?

572
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,943
-I'm teaching them to play football.
-Football?

573
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,810
-He means soccer.
-Soccer.

574
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,716
That figures. Mikey, in the car.

575
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:17,553
You better watch your step, weirdo.
I'm gonna be keeping my eye on you.

576
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:20,755
Boys.

577
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,828
Don't mind that jerk, Rudy.

578
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:30,169
He's just the local blowhard,
hiding behind a badge.

579
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,133
I know the type.

580
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:42,179
We're supposed to be
at the Purple Daisy at 6:00.

581
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,743
Where are those boys? I'm starving.

582
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,158
Where have you two been?

583
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,421
I was starting to think you were MlA again.

584
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,031
All right, you. Let go of them. Now.

585
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,433
Louise, it's okay, honey. Really.

586
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,067
Calm down, Aunt Louise.

587
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,902
The biggest crime in this town...

588
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,375
is when the paperboy throws the paper
in the birdbath.

589
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:08,741
This is Rudy...

590
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,145
the mysterious soccer player
we've been telling you about.

591
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,950
Sorry, Rudy. Reflex action.

592
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:21,456
Mom, Rudy. Rudy, Mom. I mean, Mandy.

593
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,187
It's nice to meet you, Rudy.

594
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:30,056
Boys, what was my empty food basket
doing at Rudy's house?

595
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,102
We got sidetracked, okay?

596
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,895
It's a male-bonding type thing.

597
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:41,703
Ma'am, I've been seeing the happy looks
on their faces all day today...

598
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,479
and I was wondering
if I could help coach the team.

599
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:50,152
Really? That's good news, isn't it, Louise?

600
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,449
Yeah.

601
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:58,159
Okay, the babysitter's gonna be here
in five minutes, boys.

602
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,753
Go get cleaned up. She's bringing pizza.

603
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,169
That was a fantastic meal.

604
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,539
Yeah, thanks for encouraging me
to have that hot-fudge cake.

605
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,376
God, I should just glue two big slices
on either butt cheek.

606
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:21,047
Did the boys tell you
how Rudy ended up living here?

607
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:26,516
You know what? If all he ever wears
are those awful coveralls...

608
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,088
he must have left in a big hurry...

609
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,185
or, unlike me,
he's learned to pack really light.

610
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,162
You'd make a great detective.

611
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,796
I'm just so curious.

612
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:41,728
I mean, Presscott says not to worry,
and that we can trust him...

613
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,603
but I don't know, I just can't help it.

614
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:48,202
Something just doesn't seem right
about the whole thing.

615
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:49,742
I know what you mean.

616
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,577
It looks like he should be holding up
a sign that says:

617
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,277
"Will kick soccer balls for food."

618
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,983
I don't know. He seems nice enough.

619
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,547
And he is incredible with the kids.

620
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,662
What's that all about?

621
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:10,556
Just spending
a little quality time together, I guess.

622
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:15,768
Please. You call punting
a million footballs at 9:00 p.m. quality time?

623
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,938
Come on, Mikey. Come on, go!

624
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,941
Poor Mikey.

625
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:25,009
What are you gonna do
when they're rushing you?

626
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,146
Come on now, I want that ball going
all the way down the field. Let's go.

627
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,813
Kick it. Kick it harder!

628
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,380
What are you doing?
Wasting my time out here?

629
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,052
Look where that ball went. Would you?

630
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,153
Now, come on. Kick! That's it!

631
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,803
I see all the quitters and the deserters
decided to come back.

632
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,408
Should have heard me on the phone
with the parents.

633
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,603
I should run for public office.

634
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:59,445
I see the new coach
has yet another change of dirty clothes.

635
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:04,818
Someone still needs
to take that man shopping.

636
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:14,052
Tomorrow. Same time, same place.

637
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:20,489
Wait.

638
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:27,064
The boys ain't too good on their feet,
the way you are.

639
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,773
I thought maybe
you could teach them some movement.

640
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,334
They might not like it...

641
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:38,437
but I always thought
that you'd make a good teacher.

642
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,030
This isn't working.

643
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,793
I can't do it like this.

644
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,569
I'll be right back.

645
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,656
Now that you've all learned to dance...

646
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,995
I want you to imagine you can fly.

647
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,928
You have wings on your feet.

648
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,396
So fly like a bird!

649
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,776
-Fly!
-Man, I hope no one saw us.

650
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:51,280
-We look like the world's biggest geeks.
-You got that right, fart blossom.

651
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:53,946
Hey, wait a minute. That's my title.

652
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:58,681
You all better recognize,
I'm gonna get this if it takes all night.

653
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:01,815
My brothers Daman and Dejaun always say...

654
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,055
you learn to dance,
and the honeys will be jockeying.

655
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,307
All right, yeah!

656
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,916
Nice going, man.

657
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,937
I saw some really good stuff
out there today, guys.

658
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,671
Real nice going, Dyl.

659
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,175
I know you're disappointed that we lost...

660
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:31,408
but if you're happy with how much
we improved, give me a big cheer!

661
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,210
And how about
a big round of applause for Rudy?

662
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:43,755
He's mad that we lost.
I bet he quit. We're never gonna win.

663
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:48,063
Come on, now.
Save the drama for your mama.

664
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:52,393
Rudy obviously had to rush off.

665
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,402
He'll see you at practice tomorrow.

666
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,838
Other teams don't have to practice
the day after a game.

667
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,742
How bad do you guys want to win?

668
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:06,142
All right, then. We'll see you here tomorrow.
Get outta here.

669
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:11,542
Dylan, you can
stop blaming yourself any minute.

670
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,784
I never get it right!

671
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:19,420
I always use my hands.
It's because of these stupid glasses.

672
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,126
I'm gonna go cut my arms off.

673
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:24,859
Wait.

674
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,959
After you do your homework.

675
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,537
Think about it. You can talk...

676
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,501
but you can't coach.

677
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:37,208
He can coach, but he can't talk. It's perfect.

678
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:42,517
I guess it's okay until Presscott gets home.

679
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,546
You know, if he was here,
we wouldn't have to have anybody else.

680
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,486
Don't let me hear another word
about that "if Presscott were here" speech.

681
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,222
It's been going on
since the beginning of time.

682
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:01,800
It's not about Presscott. It's about the twins.

683
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,773
I mean, thank God Rudy came along.

684
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,067
He's like the world's weirdest
guardian angel.

685
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,175
Where are those little termites?

686
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,324
Rudy, look what we got you.

687
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:15,166
"And the much-improved Cole Martin...

688
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:18,109
"kicked the ball into the net...

689
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,446
"as the game clock ticked to a close...

690
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:25,454
"giving the Terriers yet another victory.

691
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:31,856
"The Terriers are heating up
as we get down to crunch time.

692
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,958
"A dark horse on the rise?

693
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,696
"We shall see."

694
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:41,562
We're stars. Check to see
if they're lining up for our autographs.

695
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:45,574
Tell them no pictures, Aunt Louise.
Hold back the crowds.

696
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,166
That'll be easy.

697
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:49,541
When I sign my first soccer contract...

698
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,547
I'm gonna get both of you new cars.

699
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:56,812
And for us,
a matching pair of cherry-red Porsches.

700
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:59,218
We'll be babe magnets.

701
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:04,524
But until then, your mommy
will still have to drop you off at the mall.

702
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,289
-Louise!
-Whatever.

703
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,798
Would you please tell the monkey boys
breakfast is ready?

704
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,383
Hey, Mikey, come on in.

705
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:35,085
Just in time for breakfast.
You want a bowl of cereal?

706
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:38,059
Thanks anyway, Mrs. Martin,
but I'm not hungry.

707
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,556
Would it be all right if I hung out a while?

708
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,098
Sure. Are you okay?

709
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:46,431
We lost last night,
and Dad's on the warpath again.

710
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,068
I'll go home once he calms down.

711
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,802
Why don't you come
and see the team play this morning?

712
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:56,710
Big game today.
It would mean so much to them.

713
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:01,107
-You know how they look up to you.
-Okay, I'm there.

714
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:26,770
Reading about yourself in the newspaper,
it's a nice habit.

715
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,709
-Come on, Mom.
-Yeah, read it out loud.

716
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,972
All right.

717
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:36,212
"Terriers fight to a big comeback.
Must hang on for one more battle...

718
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,380
"with the top-seeded Roosters
to win junior soccer title.

719
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,515
"New coach, key to success."

720
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:46,019
-Look, there we are!
-We're on the sports page.

721
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,121
So, Eduardo,
what do you want on your gravestone?

722
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,863
"Here lies Eduardo,
eaten whole by a pack of wild animals...

723
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:57,532
"his flesh ripped off his skeleton,
and his blood splattered all over the--"

724
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:00,872
Knock it off, Eduardo.
You've seen too many horror films.

725
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,936
You know, we've got a chance to win,
just like they do.

726
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:07,744
-We're gonna win.
-When bats fly out of my nose.

727
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,844
-Ready, men?
-We can do this.

728
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,753
Let's kick some butts and take some names.

729
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,847
Pass it!

730
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:45,882
Go!

731
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,773
Pass the ball.

732
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,250
Hey, hold it there. Unnecessary.

733
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:21,456
-Come on, Rusty.
-Hey, you all right?

734
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,436
Hey, guys, give me a shot.

735
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,440
Ice cream!

736
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,420
Come on! Ice cream!

737
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,166
Hey. I know you. The big mouths.

738
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,628
What are you doing here?

739
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,641
I just came from Greenville.
We slaughtered the Phantoms.

740
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,906
Thirteen to zero. I scored five points myself.

741
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:19,311
So, the word is, you losers got lucky
and beat the Roosters.

742
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:23,611
We didn't want them to look too bad,
so we took it easy on them.

743
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:26,985
It's bad enough that Rusty's
gonna have to show off his dumper.

744
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:30,253
So you remembered our bet.
If I remember correctly...

745
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:33,784
if either us or the Roosters win,
you guys have to drop them.

746
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,559
You can't possibly think
you have a chance against us.

747
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,932
Can't wait to see the lint balls
on your pale butts.

748
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,197
This is Bobby, our goalie.

749
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:47,435
He eats kids like you for breakfast.

750
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,877
Bobby, I'm gonna give these boneheads
something to remember.

751
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:58,881
See you on the field, fools.
That is, if you make it to the finals.

752
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,216
Enjoy the shake.

753
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,726
Greetings, fashion plates.

754
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,199
Guess what I've got? Our new schedule.

755
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:18,173
We play the Mudcats in Newburn
at 2:00 p.m.

756
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,304
I got a package here
for Dylan and Cole Martian.

757
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,816
Hey, I guess our fan mail's here.

758
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:32,344
It's probably our soccer contracts.
And it's Martin, sir.

759
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,016
Well, don't you wanna see
what's in the box?

760
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,121
Sign here, please.

761
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:43,963
Thank you.

762
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,430
Wait. Don't we know you from somewhere?

763
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,272
You look like
that soccer guy from the team--

764
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,673
You know, I get that all the time.

765
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:57,144
Hey, guys, let's open the package.

766
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,149
Cool. Terrier sweatshirts!

767
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:35,912
It's nice to have been able to serve you.

768
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:39,852
Let's see.

769
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:43,492
"l wish I could have delivered them myself.
Wear with pride.

770
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,153
"l love you all. Good luck, Presscott."

771
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,129
All right, guys. Let's go.

772
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:04,975
Wake up, Rudy. It's game time.

773
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,357
Shoot.

774
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,937
Go!

775
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,518
Handball! No hands, son.

776
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,373
-Say "cheese"!
-We lost the game.

777
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,710
Stupid soccer!

778
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,309
Man, I hate my life. I'm so dumb.

779
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,952
I hate all of this. And my dad.

780
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,757
I feel so dumb!

781
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,389
Stupid!

782
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,093
No!

783
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,907
Dylan, honey, it's all right to be upset.

784
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,511
You don't know how hard it is to be a geek.

785
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:46,973
Dylan, enough. We'll be fine.

786
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,784
You're wrong. We're already fine.

787
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,044
No more lemonade stories.

788
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:58,754
Let's just chalk this up
as an okay ending to a pretty ugly day.

789
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,294
Come in.

790
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:10,067
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey, feeling any better?

791
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,974
Here's a very nice article
about the Terrier heroics.

792
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,575
It's a great way to close out the season.

793
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:22,515
Hey, you guys, come on.
You've been in here for over 24 hours.

794
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,210
Let's go with Aunt Louise
and see a movie or something.

795
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,153
Sure, Mom.

796
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:32,726
Thanks, Mom.

797
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,829
Check it out. Look.

798
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:44,439
-No way.
-Yeah, way.

799
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,249
-Where's the fire?
-You're him!

800
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:58,219
-What are you talking about?
-I was looking at the paper...

801
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,085
and I was looking at the poster,
and, Rudy, you're him!

802
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,318
You're George Patrick Owens!

803
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,320
This ain't....

804
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,960
This is not good.

805
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,963
If you know, then other people know.

806
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,167
I'm telling you.
When we see him, we're gonna waste him.

807
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:23,507
He's got to be in this town.
We saw him in the paper. He's around.

808
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,840
I was stupid for going out in public.

809
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:32,249
-We're sorry, George Patrick.
-Not George Patrick. You can't call me that.

810
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,817
Sorry.

811
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,819
Rudy, all right?

812
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,793
Rudy, don't forget.

813
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,792
No George Patrick.

814
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,930
Look, guys,
there'll be some dangerous men here soon.

815
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,403
We can go get Mikey's dad. He's a cop.

816
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,633
No, guys, you can't tell anyone.

817
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:55,540
Look, I came here to hide.
A friend told me about this place.

818
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:59,047
It would have been perfectly safe,
but I got lost in this fantasy.

819
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:02,676
Then with you wee snappers and the team,
I started to play again.

820
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:05,687
I shouldn't have gotten careless.
Now I'm in danger.

821
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,217
We can help.

822
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,315
You can help me only if you promise
not to tell anyone.

823
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,020
Not like last time, Dylan.

824
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:15,188
-Nobody, no one. Do you promise?
-I promise.

825
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:18,495
Stab me with a freshly sharpened pencil,
right in the eye.

826
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:21,661
Dip me in boiling oil, I won't breathe a word.

827
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,702
I'm counting on you.

828
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:27,598
Now go home.

829
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:31,245
-But, Rudy--
-Look, guys...

830
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:37,317
one day George Patrick Owens,
not Rudy, will come back.

831
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,647
And then I'll teach you
to perfect everything I know.

832
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,248
Now go. I want you to be safe. Go!

833
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,325
That's the man, all right. Chief.

834
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:58,363
Book me on the next flight to the States.
I'm going to handle this one myself.

835
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:10,047
-Hey, guys. How was your day?
-Fine.

836
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:13,048
What did I do with that piece of paper?

837
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:17,617
You know, I don't know
if it's the e-mail or the printer...

838
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:21,424
but I can't make heads or tails of this.
Can you read this?

839
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,866
It's not hard to read, Mom.

840
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,370
It says that the Mudcats are
disqualified from competition...

841
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,428
due to a rule violation.

842
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:34,439
"The Terriers are now slated
to take their place...

843
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,604
"in the first round
of the State Championships..."

844
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,446
Oh, my gosh!

845
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,949
"...against the Yellow Jackets of Charlotte."

846
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,851
-We're dead men.
-We're real goners.

847
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,388
We need Rudy.

848
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,586
Boys, what's wrong?

849
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:51,985
Guys!

850
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,065
I bet those are the bad guys.

851
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,770
We'd better get out of here.

852
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,383
Is it okay to break a solemn oath
if someone's life is in danger?

853
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,746
What are you talking about?

854
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:22,954
Are you guys in trouble?

855
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,755
No, worse. Rudy.

856
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:30,021
Work with us here. We got a plan.

857
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,458
Come on.

858
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:06,999
Hide in here. When my mom falls asleep,
I'll come back to get you.

859
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,367
But no late-night trips to the fridge.

860
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,565
Why? Do I look fat in this dress?

861
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,807
Short notice or not,
the boys were so excited.

862
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:20,513
I guess they've been off with Rudy.
Should be home any minute.

863
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:25,118
What, the Yellow Jackets?
They're just boys. They can't be all that bad.

864
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:27,485
Listen, I have a few more parents to call...

865
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,753
so have him there at 7:45,
and we leave at 8:00 sharp.

866
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:32,624
See you then. Bye-bye.

867
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,630
Hey, guys. Ready to tear them up tomorrow?

868
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,030
Yeah, sure, Mom.

869
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,897
You guys don't seem very excited.

870
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:43,405
You know, it's a big honor
to be in the state finals.

871
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:47,235
Rudy's sick. He has laryngitis.

872
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:50,603
Who's that? Oh, you mean "laryngitis"?

873
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,680
It's a flu in the throat...

874
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:56,377
and he's throwing up big chunks
all over the floor.

875
01:10:56,685 --> 01:11:01,315
-Poor guy. Should I get him something?
-Mom, this is serious.

876
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:08,152
Oh, no, not his appendix.

877
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,558
Poor Dexter.

878
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,601
Of course he can't play.

879
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,770
Okay, give him our best.

880
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:26,214
What are you doing here?

881
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,915
I kicked a bad punt at the game, and we lost.

882
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,712
-My dad's really upset.
-You have to go home.

883
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,782
You really should be there
when your dad wakes up.

884
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,657
Go home before it gets worse.

885
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:59,972
Okay, boys. Let's go.
We have to meet the rest of the team.

886
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,110
Where's he going?

887
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:11,249
No goalie. And there goes Rudy.

888
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,820
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey, what are you staring at?

889
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:18,064
Did someone run over a cat or something?

890
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,101
No, it's nothing.

891
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:24,861
By the way, when you were
in the shower this morning...

892
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:28,239
-Rudy said he'd meet us at the game.
-I drew him a map.

893
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:32,007
What? You can't even find your way
to the bathroom at night.

894
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:35,141
Mom, have faith.
I've never peed in the kitchen sink.

895
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:37,117
I know what I'm doing.

896
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:41,312
All right, then. Let's make like horse poop,
and hit the road.

897
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,381
Where's Louise?

898
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:47,418
I meant to tell you
that she'll be meeting us there, too.

899
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,574
You idiot. You let him get away.
The boss is gonna kill us.

900
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:44,914
I mean, you.

901
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,714
-Louise, you saved my life.
-What happened to your accent?

902
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,849
You fell for that caveman act?

903
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:24,017
George Patrick Owens.
Pleasure to meet you.

904
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:29,355
-So this is the bigtime?
-All I got is bigtime butterflies.

905
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,829
You smell something?

906
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:38,035
Look, guys, it's the smalltime heroes,
come to get their cans crushed.

907
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,506
Yeah, where's your dirtbag coach?

908
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:44,011
He's probably in the trash,
digging for their lunch.

909
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:48,209
-Rudy will be here any minute.
-Sure enough. Any minute.

910
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:54,515
We have been driving around forever.
Where is this place?

911
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:57,650
-I'm gonna get directions.
-No directions.

912
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:01,492
We don't need no stinking directions.
Cole drew me a wee map.

913
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:05,829
I can't read it. Keep driving around.
We're close. I can feel it.

914
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:09,565
Okay, guys, when you get out there,
I want you to pass.

915
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,606
And help each other.

916
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,437
We're gonna kick butt and stuff.

917
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,968
We're gonna go for it today.
I want you to get fired up, okay?

918
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:21,140
We're gonna just do everything
that Rudy taught you.

919
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:24,208
Rudy should be here any minute.
He must have car trouble.

920
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,777
Believe me, guys. You can do this.
We're a team.

921
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:36,294
I know we lost him.
You try keeping up with his muscle car.

922
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,424
We'll get him, I'm telling you.

923
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,728
Excuse me. Where are the kids
that usually play soccer here?

924
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:46,205
-Maybe that way.
-Memorial Park?

925
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,106
-That way.
-Sure, thanks.

926
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,940
And do all the stuff
that you've been doing lately.

927
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,247
You know, everything that Rudy taught you.

928
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,321
Let's do it.

929
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:06,257
Okay, so I want you to go out there
and think of everything Rudy taught you.

930
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:09,297
Two minutes to game time. Two minutes.

931
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:20,940
All right, men. I wanna win. You got that?

932
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,907
Now first, intimidate the crap out of them.

933
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:29,743
Use your bodies. Slam them hard.

934
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,484
Especially the goalie.

935
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:37,782
Take him out, and then all we've got to do is
run in and score whenever we want to.

936
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:41,194
Now, crush the little cretins.

937
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:46,000
Claw the little buggers.
Go! Get out there and punch them.

938
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:59,870
What's the big deal? So I took a bath.

939
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:09,988
-Hey, big mouth, who's your dentist?
-Dr. Price, why?

940
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:12,026
Better make an appointment with him...

941
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,927
because you're gonna be spitting up
all your teeth.

942
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:19,434
You need him more than I do, unless that's
the crap sandwich you ate I smell.

943
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,196
You're dead.

944
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:25,338
You better send your soul to heaven,
'cause your butt is mine.

945
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,617
Come on, pass the ball!

946
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,120
That's right, you're doing it!

947
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:54,363
He's so bad.

948
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,216
Pass the ball. Run!

949
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,036
Great first half, laddies.

950
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,405
All right, will everyone sit, please?

951
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,040
On your behoochies.

952
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,635
We have a very important half
of the game to play.

953
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,547
And I owe all of you a large explanation.

954
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:44,251
-Coach, are you really--
-Aye.

955
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,586
And I was tired of not being me.

956
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:50,817
I felt like a wilting plant
in need of sunshine.

957
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:57,723
I started off just like you wee lads,
playing football...

958
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:00,332
or as you say, "soccer."

959
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,064
And as I grew, my love for the game grew.

960
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:06,505
Before I knew what happened,
all my dreams had come true...

961
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:10,409
and I was on the Scottish National Team,
playing for the World Cup.

962
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:15,482
Then, about a year ago,
I realized my passion in life, football...

963
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,609
was not a game anymore, but a business.

964
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:20,553
Certain men demanded that I lose a game
to make them money.

965
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:23,989
They threatened me.
I refused and agreed to testify against them.

966
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,549
After I did...

967
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:28,960
a friend convinced the authorities
to help me hide in this country...

968
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,294
till these hooligans
could be brought to justice.

969
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:34,563
I learned I couldn't trust anyone,
except for my friend.

970
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,903
So I came to your town.

971
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,071
You guys....

972
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:43,304
You brought back my love for the game.

973
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,108
I had to be with you today,
even if it meant putting myself in danger.

974
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,810
Now, you can win.

975
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:53,221
I've watched the other team.
They don't pass when they should.

976
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:57,054
They're just a bunch of ramgunschohs,
skivers, and blethering idiots.

977
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:01,087
But we are a team, and we'll play as a team.

978
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:06,093
Now, sprint out on the field,
pass the ball, help your teammates.

979
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:10,070
Pass. We will run this team into the ground.

980
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:14,774
I believe in you guys. I really do.

981
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,470
Now let's do it!

982
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:47,798
-That must have hurt.
-Oh, beautiful.

983
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:51,903
Sterling, are you okay? God, you're heavy.

984
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:58,043
What are we going to do?
We don't have anybody else to play goalie.

985
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:01,350
-I can be goalie.
-Mikey, what are you doing here?

986
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:05,621
We hid him in the back of the van.
We accept full responsibility.

987
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:09,196
All right.
Let's get our new goalie in the game.

988
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:13,030
No, wait. It's illegal. He's not on the roster.

989
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:16,862
I took care of that months ago,
before registration.

990
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:21,669
-Then, let's do it.
-All right, go, Mikey.

991
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:24,735
Remember, you're an animal!

992
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,887
Pick it up. Come on.

993
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,898
-Do what?
-Look at Cole. He's open.

994
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,894
Look at your teammates.

995
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,570
-He's a freaking hooligan.
-Did you see that?

996
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,476
Come on, now.

997
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,181
Pass. Pass the ball.

998
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,218
Get the net.

999
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,367
Go! Get down the field.

1000
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,533
All right!

1001
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:02,073
Hustle up.

1002
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,650
Over there.

1003
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:15,185
Go!

1004
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,820
That's my boy. Go get them!

1005
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,784
Go, Mikey!

1006
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:57,390
Go, yes!

1007
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:02,102
Come on.
We got to get one more goal on this guy.

1008
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:17,945
That's my boy out there!

1009
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,118
Yeah, Mikey!

1010
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:22,554
Direct kick. You're up, son.

1011
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:24,381
Come on, Mikey.

1012
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,395
That's it!

1013
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:33,798
Put your leg into it!

1014
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:40,173
Look at that thing go.

1015
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,107
Don't use your hands, Dylan!

1016
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:54,953
You have to jump, Dylan!

1017
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:57,548
Fly like a bird, Dylan!

1018
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:05,596
Wait, don't be a mom. Be a coach.

1019
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:17,511
-Right in your face, you little twerp.
-That's what you get, stinkweed.

1020
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,688
-Second effort.
-Cole, the ball!

1021
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,555
-Come on, follow up on that.
-Second effort!

1022
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,939
-Stay down.
-Now that's using your head!

1023
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:58,706
Get your hands off me!

1024
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,804
Dad!

1025
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,873
-Did you see the game?
-I saw the good part.

1026
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:06,817
-Presscott, what are you doing here?
-I came to see my family.

1027
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,083
And George Patrick Owens in action.

1028
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:11,990
This is the man I was talking about,
the man that saved me.

1029
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,584
No way!

1030
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,020
Way.

1031
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:18,029
I see you've met our Louise.

1032
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,239
Not so fast, dweebs.
We had a bet, remember?

1033
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:39,380
-No way!
-You said a bet's a bet.

1034
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:41,615
Only a coward welshes on a bet.

1035
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:44,749
-Are you a coward, Rusty?
-No way!

1036
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:47,161
Then drop them!

1037
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:49,755
Dylan, maybe we should let them slide.

1038
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:54,768
Aside from Eduardo's underpants,
I can't imagine anything I'd wanna see less.

1039
01:27:56,337 --> 01:28:00,569
Cole, this is the only time
it ever paid for me to speak up.

1040
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:02,109
Now drop them.

1041
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:10,848
Hey, look!

1042
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:21,959
-Another ugly ending to a beautiful day.
-Copy that.
