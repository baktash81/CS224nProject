1
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,916
Our last rainy season.

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,041
Just think, pastuzo.

3
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,833
This time next month,
we'll be in London.

4
00:00:55,917 --> 00:01:00,417
Where the rivers run with marmalade
and the streets are paved with bread.

5
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,833
Did you read the book about London?

6
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:06,917
- I skimmed it.
- Oh, pastuzo!

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,916
Well, reading makes me sleepy.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,041
But any city
that can come up with this...

9
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,500
...is all right by me.

10
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:18,750
Ooh. Pastuzo, look!

11
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,166
It's... it's a cub!

12
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,917
Lucy!

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,958
Lower me down.

14
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,916
Be careful.

15
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,208
Lower, pastuzo. Lower!

16
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,541
Lucy.

17
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,083
Lucy!

18
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:07,083
I'm afraid we're not going to London
after all.

19
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,041
Why not?

20
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,208
We've got a cub to raise.

21
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:13,750
What's he like?

22
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,208
Rather small.

23
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,916
And rather sneezy.

24
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,917
But he likes his marmalade.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,291
That's a good sign.

26
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:26,292
Oh, yes, pastuzo.

27
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:30,917
If we look after this bear,
i have a feeling he'll go far.

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,958
Dear <i>aunt Lucy,</i>

29
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,542
<i>I hope all is well
in the home for retired bears.</i>

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,583
<i>Life in London has been
better than ever this summer.</i>

31
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,333
<i>I've really got to grips
with how things work.</i>

32
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,125
Aaah!

33
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,541
<i>And it seems there's something new
to do every day.</i>

34
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,625
Hm.

35
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,374
Guess what, Paddington.
The steam fair's coming to town.

36
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,833
I'm going along tonight
to write about it in my newspaper.

37
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,583
Who's going to want to read about that?

38
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,500
Everyone. They travel the world
in an old steam train.

39
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,708
I thought you'd love it.

40
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,875
I do. Don't tell anyone, ok? Not cool.

41
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,624
- Why don't we all go?
- Good idea.

42
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,749
Your father's a dab hand
at the coconut shy.

43
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,208
- Bullseye brown they used to call him.
- Not any more.

44
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,916
Coconuts are a young man's game.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,166
Well, I think you're in great shape
for a man your age, mr brown.

46
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,250
Ah, thank you, Paddington.
Hang on, how old do you think I am?

47
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,458
Oh, er, about 80.

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,250
- Eighty?
- At least.

49
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,958
- Just a minute, young bear.
- Hm?

50
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,625
Thought I told you
to wash behind your ears.

51
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,916
Oh, but I did, mrs bird. I...

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,125
I wonder how that got in there.

53
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,333
<i>L really feel at home
in windsor gardens.</i>

54
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:00,792
<i>- Bonjour, mademoiselle!
- Good morning, Paddington.</i>

55
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,208
- I brought you breakfast.
- Thank you.

56
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,499
Your sandwiches
always put me in a good mood.

57
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,541
Morning, dr jafri.
Haven't forgotten your keys, have you?

58
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,083
Keys? Keys! Oh, oh!

59
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,542
- Well caught.
- Thank you, Paddington.

60
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,958
You're welcome. Glorious day, colonel.

61
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,042
Is it? How absolutely thrilling.

62
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,625
How was your date, miss Kitts?

63
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, he wasn't the one,
but you know what they say.

64
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,624
- Plenty more fish in the sea.
- Exactly.

65
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,708
Thank you!

66
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,666
- Morning, Paddington.
- Morning, mr Barnes.

67
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,000
- Bye, <i>Paddington.
- Au revoir, mademoiselle.</i>

68
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,791
Right, test me.

69
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,458
What's the quickest way
from Baker street to big Ben?

70
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:41,542
Ah, an easy one.

71
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,124
Turn right onto Portman square. Left...

72
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,333
<i>Everyone has been so kind
and welcoming,</i>

73
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,042
<i>even though they're very busy.</i>

74
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:51,625
<i>Mrs brown is planning to swim to France.</i>

75
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,291
<i>It seems an awful lot of hard work</i>

76
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:58,750
<i>when you can go by boat or plane
or even train. But that's not the point.</i>

77
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,541
<i>She's been cooped up all summer</i>

78
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,458
<i>illustrating a series
of adventure stories</i>

79
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,875
<i>and has decided
she wants one of her own.</i>

80
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,791
Whoo-hoo!

81
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,791
<i>Judy has been suffering
from a broken heart.</i>

82
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,333
I'm dumped? I think you'll find
you're dumped, Tony.

83
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,749
<i>Her first reaction was to become a nun.</i>

84
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:22,249
<i>But she soon got over that
and has thrown herself into a new hobby.</i>

85
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:26,374
<i>She found an old printing press
at school and is starting a newspaper,</i>

86
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,499
<i>with no boys.</i>

87
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,708
Now all we need is some news.

88
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,374
<i>Jonathan is joining her
at big school this year.</i>

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,125
<i>- <i>- He spent the holidays</i>

90
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,500
<i>-building</i> a <i>fully working steam engine.
- Whoo!</i>

91
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,541
<i>But I'm not supposed to talk about that
as it's "not cool".</i>

92
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,041
<i>-- He's got</i> a <i>whole new look</i>

93
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,375
<i>and if anyone asks,
he's now called j-dog</i>

94
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,583
<i>and he's definitely not
into steam trains.</i>

95
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,125
<i>- </i> Those <i>times...
- But mr brown has been busiest of all.</i>

96
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,250
<i>He recently had a surprise at work.</i>

97
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:58,833
I am delighted to announce
our new head of risk analysis will be...

98
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,666
Mr Steve visby.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,500
<i>And this has prompted what mrs bird
calls "a full-blown midlife crisis".</i>

100
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,792
<i>It involves blending his food,</i>

101
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,958
<i>painting his hair,</i>

102
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,916
<i>and engaging in a process
called chakrabatics.</i>

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,125
Open your mind
and your legs will follow.

104
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,500
- Thank you, Paddington.
- Keep up the good work.

105
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,583
<i>Oh, aunt Lucy,
you sent me to London to find a home,</i>

106
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,292
<i>and it's worked out better
than I ever imagined.</i>

107
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,791
<i>I have a wonderful family.</i>

108
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:36,125
<i>And have made friends
in all sorts of places.</i>

109
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,250
Here, boy.

110
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,916
There you go, Wolfie.

111
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,500
<i>I do hope if you could see me,
you'd be pleased.</i>

112
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,958
<i>- Lots of love, from Paddington.</i>

113
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:50,750
- Mr gruber?
- Ah, mr brown, come in.

114
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:55,083
I just had a visit from madame kozlova
who runs the fair.

115
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,458
- Oh, yes?
- They were having a clear-out

116
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,916
and found all these old crates
stuffed full with "memory-bilia"

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,041
they thought had been lost forever.

118
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:07,083
She asked me if I would sell it
for them while they're in town.

119
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,166
And it struck me
there might be something in here

120
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,916
for your auntie's birthday.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,416
Oh, good idea.

122
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,750
Ah, look at this!

123
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:23,542
-It's very nice, mr gruber, but...
- I know, I know, it has to be perfect.

124
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,208
Well, since uncle pastuzo died,
I'm the only relative she's got left.

125
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,417
And it isn't every day
a bear turns a hundred.

126
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,291
Quite so. Ah!

127
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,749
How about these rolling shoes?

128
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,708
Please, mr gruber, be serious.

129
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:39,833
Perhaps your auntie's rolling days
are behind her.

130
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,000
I think you might be right.

131
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,333
- Oh, what's this?
- Ah!

132
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:48,667
That must be the popping book.
Very interesting.

133
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,750
Really?

134
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,749
You see,
madame kozlova's great-grandmother,

135
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,416
who started the fair,
was also a brilliant artist.

136
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,208
And every time they visited a new city,
she made a popping book

137
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:02,500
-to remember it by.
- Ohh.

138
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,750
And this is London.

139
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:14,166
Oh, mr gruber, it's wonderful.

140
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,667
Aunt Lucy always dreamed
of coming to London and...

141
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,916
Never had the chance.
But if she saw this...

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,541
It would be like she were finally here.

143
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,667
Oh!

144
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,333
Aunt Lucy! Aunt Lucy!

145
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,792
Paddington!

146
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:37,958
Oop.

147
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,791
Come with me, aunt Lucy.

148
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:52,375
Oh, yes, please.
I want to see everything.

149
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,042
It's just down here.

150
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,250
Get all your racing news
right here.

151
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,791
- Well, what do you think?
- It's wonderful.

152
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,916
Right here, ladies and gents...

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,416
All aboard!

154
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,416
One and a half bears, please.

155
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,625
- Mind your step, madam.
- Oh. What a polite young man.

156
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:15,708
What a polite young pigeon.

157
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:19,292
It's so echoey. Echoes around.

158
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,374
Sides turning!

159
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,250
Oh, Paddington,
you've made an old bear so very happy.

160
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,624
This is perfect.

161
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,291
- Ahh.
- Ahh?

162
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,916
- We have a snag.
- Do we?

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,666
You see, this popping book
is the only one of its kind.

164
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,416
And they want
rather a lot of money for it.

165
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,166
Oh, well, mrs bird found this coin
in my ear at breakfast.

166
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,458
Perhaps there's more.

167
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,583
It would take
more than an earful, mr brown.

168
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,999
I'm afraid you would need
a thousand of those coins.

169
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,458
Oh.

170
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:03,375
Let's take another look at the monkey.
I think he's super-duper.

171
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,500
- Oh!
- I can fix that.

172
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,000
That's very kind, mr gruber, but...

173
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,749
Aunt Lucy did so much for me
when I was a cub

174
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,708
and this could be my way
of saying thank you.

175
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,666
I'm going to get a job
and buy that book.

176
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,708
Back in a few minutes,
Paddington. Ciao ciao.

177
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,958
Ciao ciao, mr giuseppe.

178
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,500
Good afternoon.
Welcome to giuseppe's grooming salon.

179
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,958
What can I do for you today, sir?
A shave? A light pomade?

180
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,208
Or is it just a brush?

181
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,250
Quick trim, barber.

182
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,291
Oh, I'm not the barber. I just tidy up.

183
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,958
Yeah, well, that's all I want. Tidy up
the back and sides. Nothing off the top.

184
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,083
- Yes, but...
- No "buts". Come on, man, chop chop.

185
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,208
If you say so, sir.

186
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:51,792
Oh...

187
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,250
Hmm... ah!

188
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,125
Hmm...

189
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,249
On. Whoa!

190
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,125
G-g-giuse-e-e-eppe's?

191
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,249
W-w-would you mi-i-ind
if I call you ba-ack?

192
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:33,124
I think I ma-ay be about to sha-ave
a customer.

193
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,750
Oop. Oh, thanks goodness.

194
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:42,875
Just putting you on hold!

195
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:48,208
- But I don't want to.
- It's only a haircut, Nelson.

196
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,917
There's nothing to be afraid of.

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,583
Come in. Take a seat.

198
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,625
We'll go somewhere else.

199
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,874
Ooh, that's not good.

200
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,625
Ooh. Um...

201
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,833
Um...

202
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,708
No. Um...

203
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,875
Ah!

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,375
Well...

205
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,750
Just giving you some product, sir.

206
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,124
Ah, jolly good. Carry on.

207
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,166
All done.

208
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,791
I must say, it's turned out
a lot better than I expected.

209
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,167
What... what the devil's that?

210
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,375
It's, er, marmalade.

211
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,291
Marmalade?

212
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:50,458
- Hairy marmalade.
- Well, get it off!

213
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

214
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:55,750
Oh, yuck! What is the matter with you?

215
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,416
- Paddington!
- Mr giuseppe. I can explain...

216
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,000
Lt's really not as bad as it looks.

217
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,791
Have you ever been fired, mr brown?

218
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:11,375
Well, no, but are you quite sure you're
ready for the workplace, Paddington?

219
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,083
It's a tough,
competitive world out there

220
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:17,792
and I worry a good-natured little bear
might get trampled underfoot.

221
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,000
He's right, you know.
You can't trust anyone.

222
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,083
That's why
I'm doing my newspaper alone.

223
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,167
Darling, is this about Tony?

224
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,375
- No!
- Everything's about Tony.

225
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,249
The reason no one's helping
with your paper is because it's so lame.

226
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,624
Well, at least I'm not pretending
to be someone I'm not.

227
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,458
Nor am I. G-man!

228
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,708
- J-dog.
- Spud bounce.

229
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,875
But aunt Lucy said, "lf we're kind
and polite, the world will be right."

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,041
- At least someone's making sense.
- Oh, sorry.

231
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,917
And you're kind, mr brown,
and you made it to the top.

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,666
I'm nowhere near the top.
I peaked in the middle.

233
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,666
Now my hair's gone grey, my belly's
popped out, and I've started to creak.

234
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,250
Oh!

235
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,708
Doesn't that man live in the big house
on the corner?

236
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,542
- It's Phoenix Buchanan.
- Dad's celebrity client.

237
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,583
He's one of our platinum club members.

238
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,667
And a very famous actor.

239
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,625
Or used to be.

240
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,541
- Now he just does dog-food commercials.
- Hm.

241
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,333
Mrs bird doesn't like him
because he can never remember her name.

242
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:12,000
Now then, simmer down, simmer...
All right, little bit more.

243
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,291
That's enough!
I'm sorry, I'm at my worst tonight.

244
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,500
I really am. I am...

245
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:22,458
Tickled the deepest shade of shrimp

246
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,875
to have been asked here tonight
to open this wonderful old steam fair.

247
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,416
But you know, when madame kozlova
created this thing all those years ago,

248
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,958
she most certainly was not thinking
of people like me, whatever I am.

249
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:39,083
Vip, celebrity. I hate all that stuff.
No, no...

250
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,583
West end legend, that's another one.

251
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:46,167
No, no, she was thinking of you guys,
huh? The ordinary people.

252
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:51,042
So, I'm going to ask one of you
to come up here and open the fair.

253
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,708
Volunteers? Anyone.

254
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:53,875
Ooh!

255
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,249
Eeny, meeny, miney...

256
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:58,917
."Beah

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,833
let's have the young bear. Why not?

258
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,875
- Come, come, young ursine.
- Thank you.

259
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,208
Up here, my furry friend.
Very good, very good.

260
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:10,000
- Now, your name is?
- Paddington brown.

261
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,791
Oh, well, of course it is.
You are my new neighbour.

262
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,500
You live with...

263
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:19,083
Henry and Mary
and the great Mrs...

264
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,708
Now then, I suppose you know who I am.

265
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,917
Oh, yes. You're a very famous actor.

266
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,166
- Oh, pooh.
- Or used to be.

267
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,041
Now you do dog-food commercials.

268
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,333
- Well, a man has to eat.
- What, dog food?

269
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,166
Oh, very, very funny.

270
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,708
Anyway, they do say

271
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,500
that at madame kozlova's,
all your dreams come true.

272
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,958
So, if you had one wish tonight,
what would it be?

273
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:51,583
Oh, that's easy. I'd like to get
my aunt Lucy a birthday present.

274
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,624
- Aww.
- Darling.

275
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,958
I've got my eye
on an old pop-up book of London.

276
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,292
Made by madame kozlova, as it happens.

277
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,458
The only problem is
it's rather expensive.

278
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,417
So I need to get my paws
on an awful lot of money.

279
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,666
Well, I'm not sure
that we can offer you that.

280
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,791
But we can of course offer you

281
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,666
0-0-0-odles of fun.
So, if you would like to lend me a paw,

282
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,125
we now declare k0zl0va's steam fair...

283
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,208
...open!

284
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,666
Thank you, thank you very much.

285
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,541
Wonderful! Thank you. Ooh!

286
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,416
Ooh, wonderful.

287
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,666
Mrs brown?

288
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,625
Just one moment.
A word in your ear.

289
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,624
- Hm?
- This, er, this pop-up book.

290
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,666
- Do you know it?
- I know of it.

291
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,333
But I was led to believe it was lost.
Where on earth did you find it?

292
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,208
Oh, at mr gruber's antique shop.

293
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:43,042
He's keeping it to one side for me
but I really need a job.

294
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,416
I don't suppose you have any advice,
do you?

295
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,666
No.No.No.

296
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,750
I imagine you just have to
start at the bottom of the ladder

297
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,125
-and work your way up.
- Do you know what, mr Buchanan?

298
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,291
Hm?

299
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,625
You've just given me
the most brilliant idea.

300
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,041
- Havel?
-L'm going to be a window cleaner.

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,583
Hmm.

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Ah!

303
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:39,875
Oh!

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Hmm.

305
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,833
Ah!

306
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,333
Ah.

307
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,874
Hm. Huh?

308
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,124
Oh, dear.

309
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:04,500
Oh. Um...

310
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,375
Hmm...

311
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,041
Ow.

312
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,958
Hello? Anyone?

313
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,333
Wha...

314
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,333
Hm?

315
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,917
Hello? Window cleaner.

316
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,375
No, thank you.

317
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,333
Are you sure, colonel?
They're awfully dirty.

318
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,708
I don't care and I'm not paying.

319
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,125
Perhaps I'll do them anyway.

320
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,166
Whoo!

321
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,458
Good afternoon, colonel. Are you aware

322
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,083
-there's a bear on your roof?
- Yes.

323
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,708
He seems to be cleaning my windows.

324
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:02,167
Shall I do
your gutters while I'm up here?

325
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,125
Er, yes. Thank you!

326
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, of... of course,
it's not for me to say, colonel,

327
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,249
but I wouldn't care
to have an undesirable

328
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,208
crawling all over my premises.

329
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,625
And as commander
of your community defence force...

330
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,999
Ls that an official position, mr curry?

331
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,708
Or have you just bought yourself
a yellow coat?

332
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,666
Got my eye on you, bear!

333
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,583
Ooh! Sorry.

334
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,875
One more day, aunt Lucy.

335
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,500
Huh?

336
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,916
Mr gruber?

337
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,416
Eh?

338
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:42,833
You're not mr gruber!

339
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,958
- Clear off!
- Oh, no, you don't.

340
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,500
{Alarm rings]
- Huh?

341
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,292
Stop! Thief!

342
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,874
Come back with that book!

343
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,416
Robbery in progress
at gruber's antiques.

344
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,583
Suspect is a small bear
wearing a red hat and blue cluffle coat.

345
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,708
Stop!

346
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,249
Come back!

347
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,750
No!

348
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,250
Oop!

349
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,458
Come on, Wolfie.

350
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,458
Oi!

351
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:43,749
Oi, get off it! Go on!

352
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,249
Give that back!

353
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,000
No!

354
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,666
Nice try, bear.

355
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,292
Whoa, Wolfie.

356
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:54,917
Toodle-oo!

357
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,208
Oh! Um...

358
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:02,958
Ya!

359
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,167
Ow.

360
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,542
Come on, boy. Hup!

361
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:11,500
Hup! Hup!

362
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,124
- Ow!
"Eh?

363
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,999
Excuse me. Coming through.

364
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,541
Who are you? Ooh!

365
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,208
Ooh, dear!

366
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:23,333
Strike a light!

367
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,458
Ah.

368
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,624
That book is reserved for aunt Lucy!

369
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,333
Hello there.

370
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,791
Ooh. Ow. Not the snout.

371
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:35,417
Wolfie!

372
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,458
He-e-e-elp!

373
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,083
Oh, thank you, Wolfie.
Now, come on.

374
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,625
Attaboy.

375
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,208
All right, all right.

376
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,917
- You got me.
- Hand over that book.

377
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,166
'Fraid I can't do that. Cheerio.

378
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,666
But...

379
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:01,292
- ",
where did he g f; O.

380
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:04,000
- Hold it right there.
- Oh.

381
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,499
- Thank goodness you're here, officer.
- Put your... paws in the air.

382
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,916
But... but I'm not the thief.

383
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,208
I was chasing the thief.
And then he... he...

384
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:15,125
Disappeared in a puff of smoke?

385
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,625
Well, yes.

386
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,083
- Paddington!
- Oh, no!

387
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,375
- What's going on?
- Hold it there. Hang on.

388
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,041
- We're taking him into custody.
- There must be some mistake.

389
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,708
- No mistake, sir.
- What's happened?

390
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,375
- Caught red-handed.
- What?

391
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:49,416
- Robbing gruber's antiques.
- Well, well, well.

392
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,250
The truth is out.

393
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,458
We opened our hearts to that bear.

394
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,708
We opened our doors.

395
00:24:56,292 --> 00:25:00,250
Well, you did. I kept mine triple locked
in accordance with the guidelines.

396
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:04,291
And all along...
He was robbing you blind.

397
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:06,833
Paddington!

398
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh, no!

399
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:12,125
- Paddington!
- Oh, dear!

400
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,916
A nice little haul, and no mistake.

401
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,041
Turned out to be quite a stroke of luck,

402
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,542
that bear turning up when he did.

403
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:28,458
Coppers think he done it.
We're in the clear.

404
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:33,292
Indeed, magwitch.

405
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,500
And we gave quite a performance,
you and I.

406
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:40,083
Just like the old days, hm?

407
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,666
Why the lemon face, Hamlet?

408
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,375
If you have something to say,
i beg you share it with us all.

409
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:50,499
"It is not nor it cannot come to good."
Oh, really.

410
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,958
You and your dreary conscience.
Tell me this.

411
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,875
Which would you rather?
That you stand here gathering dust

412
00:25:55,958 --> 00:26:00,458
while I humiliate myself
in a spaniel's costume on television,

413
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,917
or that we all return in glory

414
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,791
in the greatest one-man show
the west end has ever seen?

415
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,666
Bravo!

416
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:12,458
Oh, thank you, my darlings.
Thank you. Thank you!

417
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:14,583
Blessings upon you all.

418
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:17,583
Deepest of bows. Thank you.

419
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,374
I know what you're thinking, scrooge.
It'll cost a fortune.

420
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:24,958
But if I'm right, that is exactly
what this book will provide.

421
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,292
This is no dusty antique.

422
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:32,875
Hidden on every page,
a little lady pointing to a clue.

423
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:37,708
Find all the clues... we're rich again.

424
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,500
And our dog-food days are done.

425
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,916
<i>Dinner is served, master.</i>

426
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,583
<i>Thank you, simkins.</i>

427
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:50,958
<i>If, like me, your doggie
likes to maintain standards,</i>

428
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,958
<i>can I recommend
Harley's gourmet dindins?</i>

429
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:57,125
<i>More taste, more goodness, more...</i>

430
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,458
<i>Dare one say... class?</i>

431
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:03,125
<i>- Mmm.</i>
<i>- Harley's gourmet dog food.</i>

432
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,916
<i>-- Not to be consumed by humans.</i>

433
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,125
Court will rise.

434
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:12,333
Deep breath, Paddington.
Remember what mr brown said.

435
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:16,000
"You're young. You've done
nothing wrong. You'll be fine."

436
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,499
"So long as you get
a fair-minded judge."

437
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,125
Order! Order...

438
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,541
- Oh, dear.
- You'll now hear the case

439
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:31,750
of the crown
versus Paddington, er... brown.

440
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:37,458
Oh, yes, he loved the book.
His heart was set on top of it.

441
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:41,000
So you discussed how expensive it was?

442
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,874
Yes, but he was earning the money.

443
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:48,458
I refuse to believe that young mr brown
would ever burglarise my shop.

444
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,374
- Exactly.
{Indistinct chatter]

445
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,000
Paw prints

446
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:55,875
were found here, here and here.

447
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:58,583
And a substance
later identified as marmalade

448
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:00,958
was found here.

449
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:04,125
And is this the same marmalade?

450
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,542
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, no.

451
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:15,000
Phoenix Buchanan,
do you swear to tell the truth,

452
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,083
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

453
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,708
May my entrails be plucked forth

454
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:24,250
and wound about my neck
should I deceive. I do.

455
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,666
Prison is no laughing matter.

456
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,666
And I should know,
i spent three years in les miserables.

457
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:36,291
Mr Buchanan. You live on the same street
as the defendant.

458
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,791
- I do.
- And you were an eye witness

459
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:42,291
-to the events that night.
- Indeed I was.

460
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:46,583
I was up late, when I became aware
of a hullabaloo in the street below.

461
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:50,666
I went to my awards room
which is a... large room

462
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,500
overlooking the newspaper kiosk.

463
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:57,125
And I saw young Paddington riding
a rather disreputable-looking hound.

464
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:00,208
Mary brown drew this

465
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:04,125
based on the bear's description
of the man he claims he was chasing.

466
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,208
- Hm.
- Did you see him

467
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:10,374
-on the street that night?
- Oh, a handsome devil, isn't he? Hmm?

468
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,000
- Dazzling eyes.
- Yes, but did you see him?

469
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:17,916
Your answer will tell us
whether the bear is guilty.

470
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,375
- Did you see this man?

471
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,541
Alas...

472
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,916
I did not.

473
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But perhaps he'd already vanished.

474
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,124
I beg you, have mercy on him.
He is but a cub!

475
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,791
Paddington brown.

476
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:38,792
Ten years for grand theft...

477
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:40,167
Oh, but...

478
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:44,000
...and grievous "barberly" harm.

479
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:48,750
Follow me.

480
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:15,333
Oh, um...

481
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:18,958
Mrs brown usually reads me
a story before bed. I don't suppose...?

482
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:22,042
Sorry, son. No bedtime stories in here.

483
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:23,667
Oh.

484
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:46,667
<i>Dear aunt Lucy, a great deal
has happened since I last wrote.</i>

485
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:50,833
<i>There's been a bit of a mix-up
with your present</i>

486
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:54,375
<i>and the upshot is I've had to leave
windsor gardens and move...</i>

487
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,124
<i>Somewhere else.</i>

488
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,792
<i>It isn't quite as charming
as the browns' house,</i>

489
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,458
<i>but it's not all bad.</i>

490
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:05,041
<i>It's a period property. In fact,</i>

491
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,916
<i>it's one of the most substantial
victorian buildings in London.</i>

492
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,208
<i>And the security arrangements
are second to none.</i>

493
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:15,625
<i>I'm only allowed to see the browns
once a month.</i>

494
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,041
<i>I wonder what they're doing now.</i>

495
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,667
<i>I do hope they don't forget me.</i>

496
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:52,333
Of course they won't, Paddington.
This is the browns you're talking about.

497
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,917
<i>They'll sort everything out,</i>

498
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,916
<i>and I'll be able to go home
and get your present,</i>

499
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,208
<i>-and everything will be right as rain.

E)-

502
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,041
the hunt begins.

Three-two-five.

Here goes, Paddington. Manners.

507
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,125
Fall in.

508
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:10,083
Good morning. How would you like
to start a gardening club?

509
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:13,917
How would you like to be buried
in a very deep hole?

510
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,625
After you.

511
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:18,083
Spooner, r. Workshop.

512
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:22,083
Brown, p. Laundry duty.

513
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,833
Right, laundry.

514
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:27,083
Laundry, laundry... ah!

515
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,333
Laundry!

516
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,291
Hmm...

517
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh!

518
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,125
Ugh!

519
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,333
Oh!

520
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:01,667
Hmm!

521
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,666
Oh, it's only one red sock.

522
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,041
What's the worst that can happen?

523
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,624
Afternoon, chaps.

524
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:31,624
If you ask me, the... the pink
really brightens the place up a bit.

525
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:35,708
If you ask me, you should pipe down
and enjoy your dinner,

526
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:37,792
cos it might be your last.

527
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,041
Ok.

528
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,833
Ugh!

529
00:34:57,917 --> 00:35:00,625
Ah, don't worry.
I used to be a restaurant critic.

530
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:04,624
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- Oh.

531
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,499
-It's worse.

532
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:09,624
- What is this?
- Nobody knows.

533
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:13,374
But we've been eating it
three times a day for the past ten year.

534
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,416
Why doesn't someone have a word
with the chef?

535
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:20,458
With knuckles?

536
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:23,333
Two things to remember
if you want to survive in here.

537
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,208
Keep your head down.

538
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,249
And never talk to knuckles.

539
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,291
- Thank you.
- Well, I think it's a great idea.

540
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:33,667
Tell you what, son,
you get knuckles to change the menu

541
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:38,250
and we might forget about you making us
look like a bunch of pink flamingos.

542
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,708
- All right then. I will.
- Oh, you don't wanna do that.

543
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:45,208
Aunt Lucy said, "lf you look for
the good in people, you'll find it."

544
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:48,208
She obviously never met knuckles.

545
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:57,458
Um, excuse me. Mr knuckles?

546
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,374
Yes?

547
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,166
L just wondered if I could have
a quick word about the food.

548
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,666
Send a medic to the canteen.

549
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,166
You want to...

550
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,042
Complain?

551
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,375
- Oh, no, I... I wouldn't say complain.
- Oh, that's a shame.

552
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:17,374
Because I just love it
when people complain.

553
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,541
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

554
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:24,166
Oh. Well, in that case,
it's very gritty.

555
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,208
And lum dy.

556
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,458
And as for the bread...

557
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:30,250
Need I say more?

558
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:33,208
I think we need to completely
overhaul the menu. Now...

559
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:36,917
I know we're working to a tight budget,
but we could at least add some sauce.

560
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,333
Oh, sorry about that. I'll just, er...

561
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:44,000
Hmm. No, that's just rubbing it in.

562
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,958
Don't worry.
I know what gets ketchup stains out.

563
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,917
Hang on. Was it mustard?

564
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,666
Hmm... no.

565
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,166
That's just made it worse!

566
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,708
Does anyone know what works on ketchup?

567
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,333
Chaps?

568
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:07,917
Forget the medic. Better send a priest.

569
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,791
- You listen to me, you little maggot.
- Listening.

570
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:14,041
- Nobody criticises my food.
- Right.

571
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:17,625
Nobody squirts condiments on my apron.

572
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,249
- Got it.
- And nobody

573
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:22,124
bonks me on the head
with a baguette.

574
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:24,583
- No bonking.
- I'll overhaul the menu all right.

575
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,083
- Really?
- Dish of the day.

576
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,667
'Yes?
Bear die!

577
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,791
I don't like it!

578
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:50,458
- What is this?
-Lt's a marmalade sandwich.

579
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,708
Marmalade?

580
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:55,333
My aunt Lucy taught me to make them.

581
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:57,292
You mean, you can make this?

582
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,416
- Well, yes.
- Stand aside.

583
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:06,167
Get up off the floor,
you bunch of yellow-bellies!

584
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:10,583
Listen to me.
This bear is now under my protection.

585
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:14,042
- Oh?
- Anyone who touches a hair on his back

586
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,000
will answer to knuckles mcginty.

587
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,708
That's knuckles with a capital n.

588
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,917
- Thank you, mr mcginty.
- Don't thank me yet.

589
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:29,292
I don't do nothin' for no one
for nothin'.

590
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:30,875
B99 your pardon?

591
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:36,417
You get my protection, so long as
you make that marmalade. Deal?

592
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,083
Deal.

593
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:51,333
Somebody's got to recognise him
sooner or later.

594
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:53,083
Hmm.

595
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,708
You all right, mr gruber?

596
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,291
There's something
about this whole business

597
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:00,250
-that has been tickling my brainbox.
- What is it?

598
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:03,958
On the night of the robbery,
when young mr brown called out,

599
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:07,125
the thief took to his heels
and ran down the stairs.

600
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,000
Came straight through the shop
and out the front door,

601
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,999
setting off the alarm.

602
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,541
Ah, but that's the thing.
He didn't go straight through the shop.

603
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,333
- No?
- He came all the way over here

604
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,458
to get the popping book.

605
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:22,042
Why not some jewellery or a vase?

606
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,208
They're much closer. Far more valuable.

607
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,500
He can't know much about antiques.

608
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:29,708
No. Unless...

609
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:33,042
He knows something about that book
that we don't.

610
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,416
You may find this hard
to believe, madame kozlova,

611
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,166
but Paddington is innocent.

612
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,208
And we think that the real thief
may have broken into mr gruber's

613
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:46,041
just to steal
your great-grandmother's pop-up book.

614
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,791
- The pop-up book?
- I know it sounds far-fetched.

615
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:51,500
But is there anything
you could tell us about that book?

616
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,499
Anything at all could be helpful.

617
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:57,833
- That's quite a story.
- Oh, really?

618
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,250
Come with me.

619
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,541
I'll show you where it all happened.

620
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:08,208
<i>You see, my great-grandmother,
who started this fair,</i>

621
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:11,583
<i>was the finest show woman
of her generation.</i>

622
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:15,500
<i>She could tame lions,
breathe fire, swallow swords.</i>

623
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:19,166
<i>But she was most famous...
For the trapeze.</i>

624
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,875
<i>- They called her the flying swan.
- Bravo!</i>

625
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:27,291
<i>Wherever she went,
she was showered with gifts,</i>

626
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,583
<i>and made a fortune.</i>

627
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:34,167
<i>But where there is a fortune,
there is also jealousy.</i>

628
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:37,291
<i>The magician wanted it for himself.</i>

629
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,833
<i>- And the flying swan...</i>

630
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:45,458
<i>...became the dying swan.</i>

631
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:51,208
<i>He went to her caravan
and opened her strongbox.</i>

632
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,708
<i>But instead of her treasure,</i>

633
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:57,917
<i>all he found was one
of her pop-up books.</i>

634
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,041
<i>- "Twelve landmarks of London. "</i>

635
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:05,667
<i>They had him cornered,
but he vanished.</i>

636
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:10,333
<i>And neither he nor the treasure
were ever heard of again.</i>

637
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,458
I knew there was something special
about that pop-up book.

638
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:15,542
Hmm?

639
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,875
Why else would she have kept it
in her strongbox?

640
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,374
You're not telling me
you believed all that guff, are you?

641
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,333
Madame kozlova drew
12 London landmarks in that book.

642
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,458
Yes?

643
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:27,917
Well, what if they're not
just landmarks? What if they're...

644
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,458
- I don't know, clues?
- Clues?

645
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:34,250
- To where she hid her fortune.
- You mean a treasure map?

646
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:35,749
- Exactly!
- Oh ...

647
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,999
And that's why the thief
took it from mr gruber's.

648
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:41,291
First thing tomorrow, we need to go
to every landmark in that book.

649
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,833
See if we can sniff out
anything suspicious.

650
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:46,667
- Too many adventure stories, Mary.
- What?

651
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,208
She's a fortune teller.

652
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:50,208
She spun you a yarn. It's what they do.

653
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:52,875
Honestly, Henry,
you're so closed-minded these days.

654
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:56,458
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What happened to the man I married?

655
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:58,917
- He'd have believed me.
- Oh, him.

656
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,708
- He's gone.
- What?

657
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:03,333
I'm afraid your husband's
just a creaky old man.

658
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,833
- He's not bullseye brown.
- Oh, lord.

659
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:20,791
Bullseye.

660
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,500
Oh, Henry.

661
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,458
Henry? Henry!

662
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:29,000
Anyway, the point is,
we're not going to help Paddington

663
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,708
by going on a wild-goose chase.

664
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:34,167
We're looking for this scruffy chancer,
not some swashbuckling pirate

665
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,916
hunting for buried treasure.

666
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:40,042
I think there's more to him
than meets the eye.

667
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:43,750
I think he somehow knew the story
of the koslova fortune

668
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,458
<i>and is out there right now
trying to find it.</i>

669
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,208
Well, grandfather,

670
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:53,458
tonight we go in search
of clue number two.

671
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,874
The setting,

672
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:57,874
<i>st Paul's cathedral.</i>

673
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:01,000
<i>But how to slip in unobserved.</i>

674
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:04,583
<i>Enter sister Isabella.</i>

675
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,666
- Wakey-wakey.

676
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,916
Marmalade time.

677
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:24,916
There you go, lads. Good luck.

678
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,833
- Um, mr mcginty?
- What do you want?

679
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:30,333
Well, the thing is,
I'm actually innocent.

680
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:32,750
And I wondered if you had any advice

681
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,958
on how to clear my name,
now that we're friends.

682
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,917
Friends?
I'm your boss, not your buddy.

683
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,875
Oh. Well, after you.

684
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,666
Why? So you can stab me in the back?

685
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,583
No. Because it's polite.

686
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,792
Aunt Lucy said, "lf we're kind
and polite, the world will be right."

687
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,333
You were ahead of me
and now you're behind.

688
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:54,167
That makes you a sap.

689
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,791
Lngredients are over there.

690
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:59,291
Um, aren't you going to help?

691
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,708
Nope. Now get on with it.

692
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:04,292
But there's 500 hungry prisoners
coming for breakfast.

693
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,333
So we'll need a thousand juicy oranges.

694
00:44:06,417 --> 00:44:09,625
Oh, and rule number one: No talking.

695
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:18,000
- Rule number two.
- Hmm?

696
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:19,666
No humming.

697
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,916
- But...
- Or singing.

698
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,916
- L...
- Or any other expression of bonhomie.

699
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,208
Oh, dear.

700
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:45,124
Ooh, that's heavy.

701
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:49,833
Come on,
put your back into it.

702
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:51,000
Oh!

703
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:54,375
- Help!

704
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:57,208
These sacks are awfully heavy.

705
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,667
- Well, take them one at a time, then.
- Right.

706
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:00,791
One at a...

707
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:01,875
...time.

708
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,000
One juicy orange.

709
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,250
Two juicy oranges.

710
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:23,249
Three juicy oranges.

711
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:26,167
- Four juicy...
- Now what are you doing?

712
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,875
Taking them one at a time.

713
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,208
One sack at a time!

714
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:33,333
I'm sorry. I'm finding this
a very stressful working environment.

715
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:35,333
- Aunt Lucy said...
- Aunt Lucy!

716
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:38,000
-L've had it up to here with aunt Lucy!
- Oh!

717
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,916
She sounds like a proper old bag to me.

718
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:44,625
I beg your pardon'?

719
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:47,333
I said...

720
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:51,542
Your aunt Lucy sounds like
one of the most naive,

721
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:54,916
gullible, mushy-brained...

722
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:57,249
What's going on?

723
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:01,125
Why are you looking at me like that?

724
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:06,958
It's awful hot in here.
Are you hot? I'm hot.

725
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:08,375
Did I leave the oven on?

726
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:11,249
It's called a hard stare.

727
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:15,041
Aunt Lucy taught me to do them
when people had forgotten their manners.

728
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,083
You don't have to tell me
about hard stares.

729
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,667
I practically invented them.

730
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,041
Pretty good for a bear though,
I'll give you that.

731
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,458
Now, mr mcginty,

732
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:27,125
I may look like a hardened criminal
to you, but I really am innocent.

733
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:29,208
And if you're not going to help me
clear my name,

734
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:31,500
you could at least
help me make this marmalade.

735
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,249
All right, I'll help.

736
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,749
- Thank you.
- Not gonna be much use to you though.

737
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:39,583
These weren't exactly made for cooking.

738
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:41,250
I don't know.

739
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:44,541
Looks to me like you've got yourself
a fine pair of orange squeezers.

740
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:46,874
Orange squeezers?

741
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,291
Good.

742
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,041
No. Better.

743
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,250
Tomato. Lovely.

744
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:59,541
Yes. Spot on.

745
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:01,833
Now, we have to be very careful
with knives.

746
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:04,917
Aunt Lucy said that sensible bears...

747
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:07,917
Where on earth did you learn
to use a knife like that?

748
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,500
You don't wanna know.

749
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,166
Well, it's jolly good.

750
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,791
'-Now?

751
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,125
Now.

752
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:21,375
- Right, it's time for the sugar.
- Ok.

753
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:23,708
That's what turns the juice
into marmalade.

754
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:26,000
- How much?
- Ooh, a lot.

755
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,291
Same again.

756
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:31,458
Ah.

757
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,708
A squeeze of lemon. A pinch of cinnamon.

758
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,416
And just a bit more sugar.

759
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,666
Well, is it good?

760
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,250
Ooh, it's too soon to tell.
We'll only really know once it's set.

761
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:49,583
Designed by sir Christopher wren,

762
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:53,042
st Paul's cathedral is one
of London's most famous landmarks.

763
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:56,083
Sadly the great dome
is closed to visitors today

764
00:47:56,167 --> 00:48:00,167
as one of its statues was destroyed
in a bizarre accident last night.

765
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,250
- But if you follow me this way...
- Excuse me, what happened here?

766
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,208
- A nun went berserk.
- Really?

767
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:07,625
It happens.

768
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,708
The police have rounded them all up
for questioning.

769
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:12,250
Hold it there, sister!

770
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,833
You're going nowhere
till the detective says so.

771
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:16,708
Spin it around!

772
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:23,167
Mind you, if you ask me,
the real culprit slipped the net.

773
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:25,583
What makes you say that?

774
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:28,375
Cos I saw her, that's what.

775
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:32,958
<i>I was on patrol in the upper dome,
watching the nuns parade far below,</i>

776
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,916
<i>- when something caught my eye.</i>

777
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,875
<i>One of them broke free from the herd.</i>

778
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,833
<i>And made her way
to the whispering gallery.</i>

779
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:48,333
<i>Only the good lord knows
what she was doing up there.</i>

780
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:49,708
C.

781
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:53,291
<i>But she was never
gonna get away with it.</i>

782
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:55,708
<i>Not while I'm vice deputy head
of security.</i>

783
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:57,250
Oi!

784
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,667
Attention all units,
an unusually attractive nun

785
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,333
is causing mayhem in the cathedral dome.
Activate emergency protocol.

786
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,417
Stop that stunning sister!

787
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,666
<i>- I set off at lightning speed.</i>

788
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:20,458
<i>But by the time we'd locked the place
down, she'd vanished into the night.</i>

789
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:23,458
- Good evening, my son.
- Oh, er, good evening, your grace.

790
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:24,667
Good evening.

791
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,499
Most beautiful woman I've seen

792
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:31,499
in a lo-o-o-ong time.

793
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:34,666
Do you think you might be able
to describe her?

794
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,208
It would be my pleasure.

795
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:44,249
Gentlemen, for breakfast this morning,

796
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:47,166
chef mcginty would like to propose
an orange marmalade...

797
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,541
...served on a bed

798
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,833
of warm crustless bread

799
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:55,416
topped with another piece
of warm... crustless bread.

800
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:57,542
<i>Bon appétit!</i>

801
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,833
Two choices: Take it or leave it!

802
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:08,125
Are you all right, knuckles?

803
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,208
Yes!

804
00:50:09,792 --> 00:50:11,750
Why don't you come and join the others?

805
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:12,833
Don't want to.

806
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:16,374
- Are you scared what they might think?
- No!

807
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:18,999
What do they think? Did they like it?
Did they say anything?

808
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,458
- What did they say?
- Well...

809
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:22,500
They hated it! I knew it!

810
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:25,874
My father always said
I'd amount to nothing and he was right!

811
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,166
Knuckles. Knuckles!

812
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,875
- What?
- Come and look.

813
00:50:51,792 --> 00:50:52,792
Come on.

814
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:12,791
- Paddington.
- Hm?

815
00:51:12,917 --> 00:51:15,708
I've a strange, warm tingle
in my tum-tum.

816
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:18,083
I think that's called pride, knuckles.

817
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:20,333
Well, I don't like it.

818
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:26,458
Urn, have...
Have you got anything else?

819
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:30,291
- What?
- You know, for, um... pudding?

820
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:32,041
- No!
- Fair enough.

821
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:34,125
I'm afraid we only know
how to make marmalade.

822
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,291
- Hmm.
- But if you have any recipes...

823
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:38,833
This lot? You're wasting
your time there, Paddington.

824
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:42,333
They wouldn't know
their pectin from their paprika.

825
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,374
Well, my grandmother
used to do a lovely chocolate roulade.

826
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,917
I think I can remember the recipe.

827
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,125
Ooh.

828
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,166
Charley rumble
makes a mean apple crumble.

829
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:58,875
And I can make
a strawberry panna cotta...

830
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,333
...with a pomegranate glaze.

831
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:04,667
Oh, I like the sound of that.
Don't you, knuckles?

832
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,916
- Yeah!
- Come on, then.

833
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,750
Let's get cooking.

834
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:25,666
- There you go, Paddington.
- Ooh, knuckles.

835
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:27,667
I want those petit fours now!

836
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:40,916
Er, excuse me, professor.

837
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,916
- What would aunt Lucy say?
-"Always use a cake fork."

838
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,541
Well, then.

839
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:53,458
- Care for a taste, warden?
- Thank you, Paddington.

840
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:57,125
Mmm, butterscotch!

841
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,916
<i>And it turns out the monster</i>

842
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,125
<i>wasn't such a monster after all.</i>

843
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:31,166
And they all became the best of friends.

844
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,583
- The end.
<i>- Aww!</i>

845
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,917
Uh! Time for bed, you lot.

846
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,541
--<i>You need your beauty sleep.</i>

847
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:41,333
<i>It's visiting day tomorrow.</i>

848
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:42,875
Visiting day?

849
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I do hope you have good news.

850
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:54,874
In the past month,
these three shadowy individuals

851
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:57,749
have all been seen
snooping around three London landmarks.

852
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,416
- Oh.
- We think the thief you saw

853
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,583
-is part of a criminal gang.
- Using the pop-up book

854
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:03,583
-as a treasure map.
- Well, it's a theory.

855
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:06,167
- Have you found out who they are?
- Not yet, dearie.

856
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:09,291
Maybe I should take a look.

857
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,916
I'm sorry,
this is a private conversation.

858
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,500
Oh, it's all right, mr brown,
this is my friend, knuckles.

859
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:15,833
- How are you?
- This is phibs.

860
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:16,917
<i>- G' day.
Spoon.</i>

861
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,125
- Hello.
- Jimmy the snitch.

862
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:19,249
- All right'?
- T-bone.

863
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:21,166
- Wotcher.
- The professor. Squeaky Pete.

864
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,375
- Double bass Bob.
- Hello.

865
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:23,416
- Farmer Jack.
- How do?

866
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,500
- Mad dog.
- Woof!

867
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:25,999
- Johnny cashpoint.
- Kerching!

868
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:28,291
- Sir Geoffrey willcot.
- I hope I can rely on your vote.

869
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:30,916
And Charley rumble.

870
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,333
Oh, it's so wonderful to meet you all.

871
00:54:33,417 --> 00:54:35,833
I must say, it's a great relief

872
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:39,458
to know that Paddington's already made
such sweet friends.

873
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,125
Would you excuse us a moment?

874
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:46,208
- What are you doing?
- Talking to the nice men.

875
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:49,792
Nice men?
Mary, we can't trust these people.

876
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:54,083
I mean, look at them.
Talk about a rogues' gallery. Hideous!

877
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:57,125
As for that bearded baboon in the
middle, he's hardly got two brain cells

878
00:54:57,208 --> 00:55:00,208
-to rub together.
- We can still hear you, mr brown.

879
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:04,458
That was the light you turned off.

880
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:09,042
The microphone is on the other side.
It's got "microphone" written on it.

881
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:16,208
Gentlemen,
if I have offended you in any way...

882
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:19,125
Don't worry about it.
We're fond of the little fella.

883
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:23,124
And let's face it, if anyone
can recognise a criminal gang, it's us.

884
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,791
We'd be grateful for any help.

885
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:28,791
- Please.
- Well? Knuckles?

886
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:31,875
I'm afraid I don't recognise
any of them. Lads?

887
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:35,625
I'm afraid I couldn't possibly comment.

888
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,124
Sorry to say it, kid,

889
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,499
but your friends
are barking up the wrong tree.

890
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,208
A nun, a beefeater and a king?

891
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:45,958
Sounds more like a fancy dress party
than a criminal gang.

892
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,083
Then...

893
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:49,749
What are we going to do now?

894
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:00,333
Oh!

895
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:02,375
- Watch where you're going.
- So sorry. Sorry.

896
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:05,083
Sorry, I get grumpy
when I haven't had breakfast.

897
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,875
Keys... keys. Keys!

898
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:11,958
Bottoms!

899
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:15,542
- Turn left...
- You can't park here!

900
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:18,042
L'm not parked, I'm doing the bins.

901
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,416
You're not doing the bins, sunshine.

902
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,375
You're studying on council time.

903
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:26,416
L'm gonna report you. And your hat.

904
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,250
- Morning, miss Kitts, colonel.
- Oh, morning, mrs brown.

905
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:31,249
Judy asked me to drop these off to you.

906
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,999
Propaganda!

907
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:36,083
You are wasting your time
trying to peddle that rubbish.

908
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:39,666
Everyone round here
knows it was your bear that done it.

909
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,791
And this street
is a far, far better place without him.

910
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:45,083
W hat?

911
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:48,792
Oi, it's that mangy dog!
You are going to the pound, my son.

912
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,708
Barking without a licence
in a built-up area.

913
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:52,625
- Give 'em here.
- I'll ticket you!

914
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:55,083
I have to sell them under the counter
for obvious reasons,

915
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:56,500
but people are buying 'em.

916
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,916
- Really?
-Lt's a bloomin' good read. Hm.

917
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,750
Made a few people round here think twice
about your young bear.

918
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:04,083
You just need to find that thief.

919
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:05,917
Oh, we're trying.

920
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,875
Don't suppose you know where he is,
do you, feathers?

921
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,749
He's behind you.

922
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,958
- Sorry, what?
- Coo-eel

923
00:57:14,542 --> 00:57:16,708
- Mary?
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.

924
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:17,833
Why don't you come on in?

925
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:21,000
I want to hear all about
the investigation. Yeah?

926
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:24,667
Mysterious things
have been happening all over town.

927
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,750
Ch, yes?

928
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,958
Strange characters turning up
at every landmark in that book.

929
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:31,833
- Are they?
- I don't know.

930
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,125
Perhaps it's just a coincidence.

931
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:37,249
Henry says I let my imagination
get the better of me.

932
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:39,416
Well, you're an artist, Mary, like me.

933
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,000
Our imaginations run free
like bison upon the plain.

934
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:46,916
But can I just say,
in this particular case,

935
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,416
I think dear old Henry
might have a point.

936
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:51,958
- Do you?
- But, I do have

937
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:55,250
a little bit of good news
that might turn your frown upside down.

938
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:56,667
- Oh, yes?
- Hlooksu.

939
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,291
Fingers, fingers, fingers,

940
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,041
as though the funding may be
coming through for my one-man show.

941
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:04,291
- Oh. Right.
-Lt's an evening of monologue and song,

942
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:06,291
featuring some of
my better known characters.

943
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:08,166
Would you like a little preview?

944
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,416
Um...

945
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,791
Picture this scene.
Darkness, then suddenly, spotlight.

946
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,416
Me... ping!

947
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:25,374
Oh, Mary, you look sad.
You don't like musicals?

948
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:28,708
No. No, no, no.
I suppose it just seems so unfair.

949
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:31,042
Paddington's in prison and yet...

950
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:34,791
-Life carries on.
- Oh, I know.

951
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:38,458
It must be so hard to accept
that he won,

952
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:41,333
that man with the dazzling blue eyes.

953
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,125
I beg your pardon?

954
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:46,874
The man in the poster.
Your wonderful drawing.

955
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:50,417
Yes, but...
How do you know he had blue eyes?

956
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:54,208
- Hm?
-Lt's just a pencil sketch.

957
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Ooh.

958
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,875
Well, I must have coloured him in.

959
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,541
<i>- Yeah.
- Phoenix Buchanan?</i>

960
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,625
He's a master of disguise.

961
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:10,833
- She's gone mad.
- Think about it, Henry.

962
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:13,333
Someone out there knows
about the kozlova fortune, right?

963
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:14,667
Alleged fortune.

964
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,958
Knuckles said we weren't looking
for a criminal gang.

965
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:18,833
- Knuckles?
- Because there was no gang.

966
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:22,125
- It was one man.
- Feathers knew all along...

967
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:24,583
- Feathers? Who's feathers?
- Hm?

968
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:28,583
- The parrot at the news-stand?
- No...

969
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:31,125
Can we just return to planet earth
for a moment?

970
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:35,333
Phoenix Buchanan is a highly respected,
award-winning actor

971
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:37,417
and a member of our platinum club.

972
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:40,375
- He is not a petty thief.
- Hang on a minute, Henry...

973
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,291
But let's just assume I'm wrong,
shall we?

974
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:44,583
- Ok.
- And that the fortune teller,

975
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:47,833
-career criminal and parrot are right.
- Mm.

976
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,958
May I remind you
that you don't actually have any proof?

977
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:53,542
- Er...
- Now, if anyone wants me,

978
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:55,333
I shall be putting up posters.

979
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:58,041
He's right.

980
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:00,250
Well, I believe you, Mary.

981
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:05,542
Actors are some of the most evil,
devious people on the planet.

982
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:10,124
- Are they?
- They lie for a living.

983
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:11,208
Crikey.

984
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:13,292
- If we're gonna catch one...
- Yes?

985
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:15,416
...we're gonna need a foolproof plan.

986
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:18,042
Oh.

987
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:25,375
{Bamfing on pipe]

988
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:29,167
- Paddington?
- Oh.

989
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:34,167
Paddington?

990
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:37,500
Knuckles?

991
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,708
Got a proposition for you, kid.

992
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:43,667
Me and the boys have been talking
and seems to us,

993
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,791
if you're gonna clear your name,
you're gonna need our help.

994
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:48,666
The browns may mean well but...

995
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:52,791
- It takes a thief to catch a thief.
- Ohh.

996
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:56,916
Now, if we could figure a way
out of here and hit the streets,

997
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,875
we'd find this guy soon enough.

998
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:01,916
But that would mean... escape.

999
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,333
It certainly would. And we got a plan.

1000
01:01:04,417 --> 01:01:07,042
But it's a four-man job
so we need your help.

1001
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,666
What do you say, kid?

1002
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:11,167
It's very kind of you, knuckles, but...

1003
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,625
I don't think aunt Lucy
would like the idea of us...

1004
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,666
Breaking out of prison.

1005
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:19,625
The browns will find the real thief.
I just need to be patient.

1006
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:21,875
You may not wanna hear this, kid,

1007
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:26,458
but sooner or later, the browns, well...

1008
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:29,458
They'll forget you.

1009
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:31,000
They always do.

1010
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:33,458
They'll miss one visit.

1011
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:34,917
Then two.

1012
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,249
Before you know it,

1013
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:39,999
you won't have a home to go back to.

1014
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:44,042
You're wrong, knuckles.
You're all wrong.

1015
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:46,208
The browns aren't like that.

1016
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:49,167
They'll come tomorrow
and they'll have good news.

1017
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,458
You'll see.

1018
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:57,791
Hello?

1019
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,750
<i>It's</i> Judy <i>brown
from the portobello express.</i>

1020
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:00,833
<i>Come in.</i>

1021
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:02,958
So what's this for, darlings?

1022
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:04,667
- School newspaper?
- Yes.

1023
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,958
We thought the agent of the Phoenix
Buchanan would be really interesting.

1024
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:09,333
And you'd be right.

1025
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:12,041
But I've got two minutes,
so we better make it snappy.

1026
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:15,125
And I've only given you that
because you've brought breakfast.

1027
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:17,416
Nice buns, by the way.

1028
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:21,000
Here he comes.

1029
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:24,124
Hello, Joe. What a surprise!

1030
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:25,708
What are you doing here?

1031
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:27,833
Posting letters. How's Paddington?

1032
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:31,667
- Oh, he's a tough wee bear.
- Yeah, he is. Well, send him my best.

1033
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,708
- I will. Thank you, Joe.
- Bye.

1034
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:34,792
Bye-bye-

1035
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:47,166
mr Buchanan.

1036
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,000
So, when can we expect to see
mr Buchanan back on stage?

1037
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:53,666
Phoenix? Oh,
i wouldn't hold your breath, darling.

1038
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:57,708
No, no, no, don't get me wrong.
He's a terrific actor.

1039
01:02:57,792 --> 01:03:00,917
- But there is a teensy little problem.
- Really?

1040
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,500
He won't work with other people.
Thinks they "dilute his talent".

1041
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:07,666
Miss fanshaw.

1042
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,333
Oh, I must scoot.

1043
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,999
We're having lunch
with a big Broadway producer.

1044
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:15,291
- Oh, where are you going?
- The ritz, darling!

1045
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,166
Really nice buns.

1046
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,333
Well, good heavens!
Come. Come.

1047
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:31,750
<i><i>The package

1048
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:34,833
Repeat. The package has been delivered.

1049
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:37,250
Barkridge's, no less.

1050
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:40,166
Lucky, lucky Phoenix. Whoo!

1051
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:44,541
{Phone rings]

1052
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,916
- Hello?
- Phoenix.

1053
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,250
Felicity! What a lovely surprise.

1054
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:52,499
I was beginning to think
you'd lost my number.

1055
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:54,124

1057
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,291

1060
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:05,041
Well, wonderful news. Yes, yes!
Where does one go?

1061
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,208
<i>-- The ritz, darling!</i>

1062
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,208
I am on my way.

1063
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:10,999
<i>- Nice buns, by the way.</i>

1064
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:13,833
I beg your pardon'?

1065
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:18,166
<i>Really nice buns.</i>

1066
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:20,999
Thank you, darling.

1067
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:25,750
I've never had any complaints
about mr and mrs Betty-cheek.

1068
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:27,583
Yes!

1069
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:29,999
Gloves. Keys.

1070
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:32,916
And exit.

1071
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:45,749
Mary?

1072
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:49,958
Where all your dreams come true?

1073
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,500
Open the window.

1074
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,416
- Hello, darling.
- Have you gone insane?

1075
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,666
I know it's Phoenix
and I'm going to prove it.

1076
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,208
This is breaking and entering!

1077
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:13,625
We haven't broken anything.

1078
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,708
Why would Phoenix want to steal
a pop-up book? He's a millionaire!

1079
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:21,500
That's where you're wrong.
He owes money all over town. Look.

1080
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:23,874
So he's got a few bills.
I mean, everyone...

1081
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:26,041
Good grief,
the man spends a lot on face cream.

1082
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:28,375
He hasn't got a penny to his name.
Now come on.

1083
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,833
Let's find that book
and get out of here.

1084
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:37,583
Cravat.

1085
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,000
- Well?
- Nothing.

1086
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:45,624
We must be missing something.

1087
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,458
Unless there's nothing to find.
Now can we please go?

1088
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,166
- Look, Henry.
- What?

1089
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:52,333
The carpet.

1090
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:54,375
Yes, it's lovely.
I'll order a swatch.

1091
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:55,958
- Give me a leg-up.
- Oh...

1092
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:58,333
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

1093
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:03,375
'Wary] Yes!

1094
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:09,374
A secret room.

1095
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:11,916
-It's an attic.
- A secret attic.

1096
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,750
It's an ordinary attic.

1097
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:16,333
Every house in the street has one.
I mean, look,

1098
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:19,874
it's just a perfectly normal...
Oh, my god, he's a weirdo.

1099
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:23,874
Look, Henry.
The nun. The thief. The king.

1100
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:25,875
We were right!

1101
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,499
Sorry. We?

1102
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,749
Well, well, I mean, I, I never...

1103
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:34,083
- Quick!
- Get down, get down.

1104
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,791
Quite frankly, ravishing!

1105
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:49,958
Hello?

1106
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Who goes there?

1107
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:57,374
Reveal yourself.

1108
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:04,416
Henry?

1109
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:08,292
Hello, Phoenix.

1110
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:11,499
What on earth are you doing here?

1111
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:14,708
I might ask you the same thing.

1112
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:17,958
Well, I live here. It's my house.

1113
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:21,916
And I... insure it.

1114
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:26,374
And for our platinum club members,
we perform

1115
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:30,666
an annual free home inspection
to verify your security arrangements.

1116
01:07:30,792 --> 01:07:32,708
"1 vow pyjamas?

1117
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:34,667
Hm-hmm.

1118
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,125
With your wife?

1119
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,875
So that all seems pretty secure.

1120
01:07:39,542 --> 01:07:41,708
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.
- Mary.

1121
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:45,000
- Didn't hear you come in.
- She helps out when we're busy.

1122
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:47,125
Oh, well, that sounds entirely...

1123
01:07:48,042 --> 01:07:50,167
-Plausible.
- Does it? Great!

1124
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:53,166
Well, I'm delighted to say
that everything seems tickety-boo.

1125
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:54,625
Wonderful.

1126
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:58,458
So, I'll nip back to the office
and get the boys to type that up asap.

1127
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,667
- And we'll hope to see you soon.
Jndeed.

1128
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,916
Perhaps next time not in your pyjamas.

1129
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:08,917
- He's such a silly one.
- Ciao, now.

1130
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:14,875
Oh, thank Larry it's there.

1131
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:18,666
Thank Larry, Johnny
and all the ghosts of the Avenue.

1132
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:21,250
Yeah, well, that was close,
weren't it? Eh?

1133
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:24,333
- Too close, if you ask me.
- Hold your nerve, MacBeth.

1134
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:27,666
Screw your courage to the
sticking place. We are so nearly there.

1135
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,625
I have followed this lady
through the whole of London

1136
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:34,708
and collected every one
of her clever little clues.

1137
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:36,958
Aye. But what do they mean?

1138
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:39,500
It's just a jumble of letters, ain't it?

1139
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,999
<i>Au</i> contraire, mon <i>ami.</i>
Uh-uh. They are not letters at all.

1140
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:47,124
- They are... musical notes.
- Indeed, poirot.

1141
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:52,208
And I believe I know
just where to play them.

1142
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:57,208
Hold it!

1143
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:00,042
That is an amazing story.

1144
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,500
But all you can actually prove

1145
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:05,166
is that Phoenix Buchanan
keeps his old costumes.

1146
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,916
Bring me some hard evidence.

1147
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,916
Bring me the book with his fingerprints
on and then you've got a case.

1148
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,208
But until then,
there's nothing I can do.

1149
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:14,333
-L'm sorry.
- What?

1150
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:17,375
Where she's... where's she going?

1151
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:20,916
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

1152
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,500
Well, at least we can tell Paddington
we know who did it.

1153
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:26,791
- Oh, no.
- What?

1154
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,208
- Oh, we've missed visiting.
- Oh.

1155
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,999
Paddington...

1156
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,542
Paddington!

1157
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,458
Aunt Lucy.

1158
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:12,458
- Aunt Lucy!
- Paddington.

1159
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:17,500
What are you doing here?

1160
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,999
I thought you'd be at home.

1161
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:23,208
I'm afraid I don't have one any more.

1162
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:26,624
You see, I'm in prison.

1163
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,500
And even the browns have forgotten me.

1164
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,833
Paddington.

1165
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:44,750
Knuckles?

1166
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,958
Tonight's the night.
We leave at midnight.

1167
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:52,375
You wanna clear your name,
it's now or never.

1168
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:54,541
You in?

1169
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:56,416
'Um in.

1170
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,375
Right.
Time to call it a night.

1171
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:02,749
Not much going on here anyway.

1172
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:05,666
They've been good as gold recently.

1173
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,999
Lights out.

1174
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:25,874
Ooh!

1175
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:33,291
- Ah!
{Keys jingle]

1176
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:45,541
Ooh, sandwiches.

1177
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:48,958
- Paddington!
- Coming.

1178
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:37,708
Good luck, little bear.

1179
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:50,749
This is the life, lads.

1180
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,791
Freedom!

1181
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:09,041
Bring her down, spoon.

1182
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,625
There she is, boys.
Our ticket out of here.

1183
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:34,374
What do you mean?
Where are we going?

1184
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:39,666
- Might as well tell him, knucks.
- Tell me what?

1185
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:44,250
- Aren't we going to clear my name?
- Sorry, kid. Change of plan.

1186
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:46,792
What?

1187
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,708
- We're leaving the country.
- And you're coming with us.

1188
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:53,125
But... you lied to me

1189
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:57,708
oh, hey, now, it wasn't like that.
We were doing you a favour.

1190
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:00,249
If we told you the truth,

1191
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:02,916
you'd never have come along,
and it's better this way.

1192
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,500
We are gonna make marmalade together.

1193
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:10,583
But I don't want to, knuckles.

1194
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:13,292
I want to clear my name and go home.

1195
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,416
And you said you'd help.

1196
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,083
You promised.

1197
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:22,874
Sorry, kid.

1198
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:26,042
No can do.

1199
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:29,249
Paddingtgn!

1200
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:31,916
Let him go.

1201
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:35,375
If he wants to get himself arrested,

1202
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:37,333
that's his choice.

1203
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:21,000
- Hello.
- Hello, Jonathan.

1204
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,916
<i>Hum
you've reached the brown residence.</i>

1205
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,583
- We're not here <i>now.</i>
- But leave a message.

1206
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:30,167
Hello, it's me... Paddington.

1207
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:33,042
<i>I hope you don't mind my calling.</i>

1208
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:37,625
<i>I just wanted to let you know
I've broken out of prison, and, well...</i>

1209
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,208
<i>I suppose I'm on the run.</i>

1210
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:43,500
<i>I didn't really mean to but...</i>

1211
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:46,708
<i>Knuckles said that if we broke out,
he'd help clear my name</i>

1212
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
<i>and then I could come home.</i>

1213
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:54,250
But he's gone now and I'm on my own.

1214
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,583
I don't really know why I'm calling.

1215
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:01,667
I suppose I just wanted to say...

1216
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:04,750
...gooddye.

1217
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:24,291
{Phone rings]

1218
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:34,041
- Oh! Hello?
- Paddington?

1219
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:36,416
Yes. Yes, it's Paddington!

1220
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:39,875
<i>I'm so sorry I escaped, mrs brown,
but I thought you'd forgotten me.</i>

1221
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:42,249
Oh, we'd never forget you, Paddington.

1222
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:44,083
- Paddington?
- You're family!

1223
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:45,667
We know who the thief was.

1224
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:47,625
- It's Phoenix Buchanan.
- Mr Buchanan?

1225
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:49,583
<i><i>But he's disappeared into thin air.</i>

1226
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:52,041
We've been looking for him
at every landmark in that book.

1227
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:53,958
<i>Every last page.</i>

1228
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,958
"Where all your dreams come true."

1229
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,166
Why do you say that?

1230
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,625
Oh, it was written on the last page
of the pop-up book.

1231
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:04,124
<i>- Always made me think of aunt Lucy.
- That's very bizarre.</i>

1232
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:05,208
Ls <i>it?</i>

1233
01:19:05,292 --> 01:19:09,333
I found that exact same phrase on
a scrap of paper in Phoenix's house.

1234
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:12,292
- <i>Really?</i>
- L'm sure I've seen that before.

1235
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:13,833
Look.

1236
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:16,542
- "Where all your dreams come true."
- The organ?

1237
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:18,833
That must be where
madame kozlova hid her fortune.

1238
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:21,542
- Let's get to the fair.
-Lt's too late. They're leaving today.

1239
01:19:21,625 --> 01:19:24,541
- From Paddington station.
- At 6:35.

1240
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,541
- There's still time.
- Paddington, head for the station.

1241
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:29,666
<i>If we can find Phoenix
and get hold of that book,</i>

1242
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:31,500
<i>his fingerprints will prove everything.</i>

1243
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,833
But that's miles away, mr brown. I...

1244
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:38,916
I'll see you there.

1245
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,916
Clear the road!

1246
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,458
This is a refuse emergency!

1247
01:19:43,542 --> 01:19:44,875
Sorry!

1248
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:48,958
<i>Fellow citizens,
I've just received intelligence.</i>

1249
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:52,625
<i>The bear has escaped
and may be heading this way.</i>

1250
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:56,916
<i>I have raised the neighbourhood
panic level to "wild hysteria".</i>

1251
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,666
Get out of the way, mr curry!

1252
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,833
Paddington's not coming this way!

1253
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:02,292
He's gonna clear his name.

1254
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:05,583
- And we're gonna bring him home!
- We don't want <i>him here.</i>

1255
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:08,375
No, of course you don't. You never have.

1256
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:12,416
As soon as you set eyes on that bear,
you made up your mind about him.

1257
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,666
Well, Paddington's not like that.

1258
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:18,583
He looks for the good in all of us
and somehow, he finds it.

1259
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,666
It's why he makes friends
wherever he goes.

1260
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,833
And it's why windsor gardens
is a happier place whenever he's around.

1261
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:29,292
He wouldn't hesitate
if any of us needed help.

1262
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:33,458
So stand aside, mr curry,
cos we're coming through!

1263
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,083
<i>Nice try, brown.</i>

1264
01:20:44,167 --> 01:20:46,333
<i>Your plan seems to have stalled.</i>

1265
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:47,708
<i>Like your vehicle.</i>

1266
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:51,167
<i>Try the choke. Go on, try the choke.
You're flooding it.</i>

1267
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,916
- Clutch down, second gear, mr brown.
- What?

1268
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,500
<i>- What you doing?
After three.</i>

1269
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:56,624
<i>- What's going on?
- Three.</i>

1270
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:59,249
<i>You're illegally perambulating
on a public highway.</i>

1271
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:00,999
Put your backs into it.

1272
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,999
<i>- Do not push that vehicle!</i>

1273
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:04,583
Bring Paddington home.

1274
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:07,083
- Thank you.
- Go, go, go! Oh!

1275
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:22,458
Right, Paddington, stay low
and remember, you're a bin.

1276
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:31,042
You're a bin. You're a bin.
Just an ordinary bin going for a walk.

1277
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:38,875
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1278
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:42,541
Nothing to see here,
officer. Just a bin.

1279
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:44,000
Hm.

1280
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:46,167
Quite good being a bin.

1281
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:02,875
Gentlemen.

1282
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:05,999
Hmm.

1283
01:22:24,292 --> 01:22:25,708
Paddington!

1284
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:27,125
Mr brown!

1285
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,249
Quickly, he's on board!

1286
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:33,416
Don't worry, I'll handle it myself!

1287
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,708
We've gotta catch up with that train.

1288
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:38,125
But how?

1289
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:42,042
I've got an idea.

1290
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:45,874
Good morning, madam, sir.
Welcome on board.

1291
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:48,333
- Fine. Thank you.
- May I offer you a glass of champagne?

1292
01:22:48,417 --> 01:22:51,625
- Oh! Thank you. Very civilised, yes.
- Thank you so much. Very kind.

1293
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:56,124
Nice to have a break after all I've been
through with that beastly bear.

1294
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:59,458
Boiler pressure, two-two-five.
Water, half a glass.

1295
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:01,958
- Air brake, off.
- Nice work, j-dog.

1296
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:06,083
My name's not j-dog.
It's Jonathan brown.

1297
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:08,000
And I like steam trains.

1298
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,916
Oh! Oh, for goodness' sake.

1299
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,666
-L'm so sorry.
- Get off!

1300
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:13,416
- Ssh,ssh.
- Stop it, stop it!

1301
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,916
Don't shush me, gertrude.

1302
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,541
I have just been spilled upon
by a chilled liquid.

1303
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:21,208
Gerald. I want you to shush.

1304
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:24,917
Yes, gertrude.

1305
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,041
<i>--...news from the BBC.</i>

from portobello prison last night.</i>

Poor little fella.

1312
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:51,166
Must be somewhere down there right now.

1313
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,083
Shouldn't we help him, knuckles?

1314
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:57,167
How? We go back down there,
they won't just lock us up,

1315
01:23:57,250 --> 01:24:01,333
-they'll throw away the key!
- I know, but... he's our friend.

1316
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,458
Stick to the plan.

1317
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:08,041
I don't do nothin' for no one
for nothin'.

1318
01:24:31,042 --> 01:24:32,333
Well, grandfather.

Ah!

01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,708
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1326
01:25:02,292 --> 01:25:04,708
- Paddington!
- He can't hear us.

1327
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:08,166
- Can this thing go any faster?
- I can try but I need more coal.

01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:11,000
-L'm on it.
- Pull alongside. I'm going across.

Where do you think you're going, bear?

It's a train. It comes to an end,

Exit bear, pursued by an actor...

Phoenix Buchanan.

Mrs bird?

1356
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:07,292
Oh, so now you remember me?

1357
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:10,041
Well, I never.

1358
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:11,542
The cavalry.

1359
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:15,166
An old crone, a little girl
and an insurance man.

What am I going to do?

1361
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,125
I'll tell you exactly
what I'm going to do.

Hm?

1363

I'm going to bloomin' well
biff you on the nose.

1364
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,791
Not a very good idea.

1365
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:28,833
Stage combat, level four.

Well, where I come from, laddie,

they teach you never
to bring a knife to a gunfight.

that fires plastic darts.

So it does.

1370
01:28:43,792 --> 01:28:46,500
Whereas this sword looks very sharp.

1371
01:28:47,167 --> 01:28:49,792
Back you go. All of you, back.

1372
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:02,666
And for you, sir, the jumbo pavlova.

1373
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:03,750
Enjoy.

1374
01:29:06,417 --> 01:29:10,375
Oh, hello, your honour.
The hair is looking lovely.

1375
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,208
Paddington!

1376
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:19,583
Mrs brown! Um...

1377
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:22,208
Ah. I've got an idea!

1378
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:27,000
Good. Good. Excellent.
Now for your furry friend.

1379
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:39,791
Slow down, Jonathan.

1380
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:47,166
Coo-ee!

1381
01:29:47,292 --> 01:29:49,542
What a clever little plan.

1382
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,458
Don't worry. I know a wee trick

1383
01:29:58,542 --> 01:30:00,958
Harry Houdini used to do.

1384
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,916
Jump, Paddington! I'll catch you.

1385
01:30:20,042 --> 01:30:21,833
“No!

1386
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:25,999
- Ah!
- No!

1387
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:36,458
Bye-bye, bear.

1388
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:54,958
Bull's-eye!

1389
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,958
Stop the train, Jonathan!

1390
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,750
Let's go, lads.

1391
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:22,833
Ah!

1392
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:31,583
Knuckles, you came back.

1393
01:33:31,667 --> 01:33:35,292
- Can't make marmalade on my own, can I?
- Thank you, everyone.

1394
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:37,291
Paddington?

1395
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:41,000
- He's burning up.
- Better get the little fella to bed.

1396
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:43,792
- Mum!
- Paddington!

1397
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:44,916
He's not well.

1398
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,333
Don't worry, he's gonna
be fine. Aren't you, little buddy?

1399
01:34:12,667 --> 01:34:15,333
- Paddington!
- Where am I?

1400
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:16,999
Take it easy now.

1401
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:21,333
You gave us a wee scare,
but you're home now.

1402
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:23,833
- Home?
- That's right. Look.

1403
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:26,125
The police realised
they made a terrible mistake.

1404
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:29,916
Phoenix Buchanan has been arrested,
and I might add,

1405
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,458
is no longer a member
of our platinum club.

1406
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:35,167
- Then".
- You're a free bear.

1407
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:38,583
- How long have I been asleep?
- Three days.

1408
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:41,124
Three days? But that means...

1409
01:34:41,292 --> 01:34:45,000
-Lt's aunt Lucy's birthday.
- And I never sent her anything.

1410
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:48,666
-It's all right, Paddington.
- But it isn't all right, mrs brown.

1411
01:34:48,792 --> 01:34:53,250
You see, aunt Lucy did so much for me
when I was a cub.

1412
01:34:53,333 --> 01:34:55,999
Without her,
I'd never have come to London.

1413
01:34:56,083 --> 01:35:00,499
And, I suppose all I ever really wanted
was to make her proud.

1414
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:04,458
But now she's going to wake up
on her birthday with no present

1415
01:35:04,542 --> 01:35:06,958
and think I've let her down completely.

1416
01:35:07,042 --> 01:35:11,542
Oh, you great goose!
She won't think that at all.

1417
01:35:11,667 --> 01:35:12,833
Won't she?

1418
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,333
Come with us.

1419
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:19,791
Here he is!

1420
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:28,666
What are you all doing here?

1421
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:31,250
- We wanted to say thank you.
- Thank you?

1422
01:35:31,333 --> 01:35:33,999
- For everything you've done for us.
- Yes.

1423
01:35:34,083 --> 01:35:35,958
If it wasn't for you,
we'd never have met.

1424
01:35:36,042 --> 01:35:37,792
You helped me pass my exam.

1425
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:39,916
I would be permanently
locked out of my house.

1426
01:35:41,292 --> 01:35:44,375
I'd say you've rather a lot
to be proud of.

1427
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,500
Oh.

1428
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:48,666
When we heard the police
wanted the popping book for evidence,

1429
01:35:48,792 --> 01:35:52,292
we thought we'd find aunt Lucy
another present.

1430
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:54,000
So we all clubbed together.

1431
01:35:54,167 --> 01:35:56,958
I pulled in a few favours
from my old air force chums.

1432
01:35:57,042 --> 01:35:59,417
And we think she's going to love it.

1433
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,416
But... what is it?

1434
01:36:02,417 --> 01:36:05,583
You wanted to get that book so
aunt Lucy could see London, didn't you?

1435
01:36:05,667 --> 01:36:07,583
It was always her dream.

1436
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:11,917
Well, we thought,
why look at London in a book

1437
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,833
when she could see the real thing?

1438
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:19,500
Why don't you go and answer that?

1439
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:38,291
Oh.

1440
01:36:38,417 --> 01:36:40,875
Oh.

1441
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,666
Paddington.

1442
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:47,208
Happy birthday, aunt Lucy.

1443
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:07,166
Phoenix Buchanan.

1444
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:10,375
You have proved yourself
to be a heinous criminal...

1445
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:15,624
...and a disgrace
to the noble profession of acting.

1446
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:19,208
I sentence you to ten years

1447
01:38:19,292 --> 01:38:23,792
and I suggest that you use
your time behind bars wisely.

1448
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,166
I shall.

1449
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,166
Thank you. Thank you.

1450
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:50,750
Well, it seems I didn't need
the west end after all. Just...

1451
01:39:53,708 --> 01:39:55,291
A captive audience.

1452
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:58,458
What am I like? Guards, lock me up!

1453
01:39:58,542 --> 01:40:00,375
Oh, wait, you have.

1454
01:40:03,542 --> 01:40:06,542
Sapex scripts
