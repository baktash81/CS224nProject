-Local Democratic headquarters.

-Anything else?

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
Break-in, car crash.
That's not bad for a Saturday.

72
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,920
Okay, let me know what happens.
Hello, Carl.

73
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,240
Got anything on that couple?

74
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,600
Harry, I know somebody on the staff
over at Watergate.

75
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,920
Bernstein, why don't you finish one story
before trying to get on another?

76
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
I finished it.

77
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,560
-The Virginia Legislature story?
-I finished it.

78
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,240
All right, give it to me.

79
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,080
I'm just polishing it. I'll work the phones.

80
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,440
Polishing it? Yeah, you work the phones.

81
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,480
Excuse me, I'm sorry, who are the lawyers
for the five men arrested at Watergate?

82
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,600
Do you know?

83
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,000
-Well, these two were assigned to it.
-I'm sorry?

84
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,320
These two were appointed to the case.

85
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,440
But only now it turns out
the burglars have their own counsel.

86
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,640
-The burglars have their own counsel?
-That's right.

87
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,680
That's kind of unusual, wouldn't you say?

88
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,360
For burglars it's unusual.

89
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,000
-You know the name of the counsel?
-I don't know. Some country-club type.

I think $300 would be acceptable....

95
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,520
Excuse me, what is your name?

96
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,240
I'm Bob Woodward
of the <i>Washington Post.</i>

97
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,000
-Markham.
-Markham.

98
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,760
Mr. Markham, are you here in connection
with the Watergate burglary?

99
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm not here.

100
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,200
Okay.

101
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,600
Well, clearly, I am here...

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,040
but only as an individual,
not as the attorney of record.

103
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,280
Who is?

104
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,360
Mr. Starkey.

105
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
-Do you have any--
-Whatever you want...

106
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,160
you'll have to get it from him.
I have nothing more to say.

107
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,520
Starkey. S-T-....

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,560
Mr. Starkey was very helpful.

109
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,880
Four Cuban Americans
and another man, James W. McCord.

110
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,640
Look, I told you inside,
I have nothing more to say.

111
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
I understand that.

112
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,720
What I don't understand is
how you got here.

113
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,360
I assure you there's nothing
very mysterious involved.

114
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,200
Well, a little while ago, I was talking
to a couple of the lawyers...

115
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,000
assigned to represent the burglars.

116
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,120
So?

117
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,680
They never would have been assigned
to represent the burglars...

118
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
had anyone known the burglars
had arranged for their own counsel.

119
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,120
Only, the burglars couldn't have arranged
for their own counsel...

120
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,520
since they never even made a phone call.

121
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,840
So, if no one asked you to be here,
why are you here?

122
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,520
I don't want you
to take this personally, Mr....

123
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,040
-Woodward.
-Woodward.

124
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,280
It'd be a mistake to do that.

125
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,040
I just don't have anything to say.

126
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,280
Did one of the other men
involved in the break-in call you?

127
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,600
What reason do you have to assume
that there were other people involved?

128
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,520
Well, one of your clients
was arrested with a walkie-talkie.

129
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
They're not my clients.

130
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
Now, I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

131
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
You're a lawyer and you're here.

132
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,840
One of the defendants, Mr. Barker,
and I met at a social occasion once.

133
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,960
-Where?
-I have nothing else to say.

134
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,080
A Miami social occasion?

135
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,680
Mr. Starkey says
the Cubans were from Miami.

136
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,360
L-62, James McCord.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,160

00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,040
L-65, Eugenio Martinez.

140
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,600
L-66, Frank Sturgis.

141
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
Please step forward, Attorney Starkey.

142
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,200
All charged with Burglary 2.

143
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,640
-Mr. Starkey, will you represent all five?
-Yes, Your Honor.

144
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,800
And are all five gentlemen charged
with burglary, second degree?

145
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,920
Yes, Your Honor.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,520
JUDGE: Your names, please,
and state your professions.

147
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,640
Bernard Barker, anti-communist.

148
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,000
Anti-communist?
That, sir, is not your average profession.

149
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,520
James McCord, security consultant.

150
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,760
JUDGE: Where?

151
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,680
Government. Recently retired.

152
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
-Where in the government?
-[Whispering] Central Intelligence Agency.

153
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,280
Where?

154
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,760
The CIA.

155
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,360
Sturgis, Frank A., salvage operator.

156
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,200
Holy shit!

157
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,000
Eugenio Martinez, known as Gene Valdez.

158
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,280
James W. McCord, alias Edward Martin.

159
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,160
Frank Sturgis, alias Frank Fiorini.

160
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,040
All five of them had at least one alias.

161
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,040
Is there any proof they were trying to bug
the National Democratic Chairman?

162
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,800
It's obvious
they were trying to bug O'Brien.

163
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,800
They wouldn't go to all that trouble
to bug secretaries.

164
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
-There's no proof.
-Wait a minute.

165
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,400
I called a lawyer in Miami I know.

166
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,040
He said four of the guys
who were arrested were from Miami...

167
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,400
Gonzales, Martinez, Sturgis, and Barker.

168
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,080
Yeah, Barker. And all four of them
were involved in CIA activities....

169
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,680
-No, they weren't.
-Yeah.

170
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,840
No, only one of them was admitted CIA,
and the CIA won't confirm that.

171
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,760
In fact, they deny even knowing McCord.

172
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,960
Yeah, but I just think it's obvious that
with all that money and equipment...

173
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,560
they weren't out to work by themselves.
Somebody hired them.

174
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,360
I'm not interested
in what you think is obvious.

175
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm interested in what you know.

176
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,240
What we don't know is why they wanted
to bug Democratic Headquarters.

177
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,800
Whether they were working
for themselves...

178
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,480
or other individuals or other organizations.

179
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,440
Could be a story,
or could just be crazy Cubans.

180
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,560
Bachinski, when you get there tonight,
take it easy.

181
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,200

183
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,560

Hang on. Okay, go ahead.

189
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,240
<i>There's a strange entry</i>
<i>in two of the burglars'address books.</i>

190
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,600
-Yeah.
<i>-One says, "H.H. at W.H. "</i>

191

<i>The other says, "Howard Hunt, W. House."</i>

192
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,280

can't you?

193
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,440
SECRETARY: Yeah.

194
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,280

Sit down.

212
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,640
You know, I'm glad
you asked me that question.

213
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,640
The reason I'm glad you asked me
is because...

214
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,000
if you had asked Simons or Bradlee,
they would've said:

215
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,800
"You know we're going to have to fire this
schmuck at once because he's so dumb! "

216
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,680
Who is Charles Colson?

217
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,520
The most powerful man
in the United States is President Nixon.

218
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,960
You've heard of him?

219
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,800
Charles Colson is
Special Counsel to the President.

220
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,040
There's a cartoon on his wall.

<i>Yes, what is it?</i>

228
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,520
I was just kind of wondering
why your name and phone number...

229
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,320
were in the address books of
two of the men arrested at Watergate?

231
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,640

This is Bob Woodward

235
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,600
I was told that you had worked
with a Mr. Howard Hunt.

236
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,880
<i>Why would anyone say that?</i>

237
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,600
You do know Mr. Hunt?

238
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,200
<i>No, I don't believe so, and I can't imagine</i>
<i>why anyone would say that.</i>

00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,160
<i>Listen, I'm really sorry,</i>
<i>but I was on my way out. Goodbye.</i>

240

PUBLISHER: <i>Did you say</i>
<i>the</i> Washington Post?

242
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,480
Yes, that's right, the <i>Post.</i>

243
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Your publishing firm was listed in some
papers in connection with a Howard Hunt.

244
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,720
<i>Yeah, he's one of our authors.</i>

245
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,760
<i>He wrote spy novels, I think.</i>

246
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,560
What type of spy novels were they?
Were they modern, or were they period--

247
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,120
You say, "wrote"? You mean
he's no longer with you anymore?

248
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,360
<i>No, not at this time.</i>

249
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
How long has it been
since you've heard from him?

250
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,000
<i>A couple of years, I think.</i>

251
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,000
Could you tell me some of the names
of the novels that he has written?

Sorry to bother you at home.

267
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
I was wondering
if you could confirm some information...

268
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,200
on one of your employees,
Mr. Howard Hunt?

269
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,440
<i>What kind of information?</i>

270
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,040
It's just profile information mostly.

271
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,440
We know, for example,
that he works for Mullen & Company...

272
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,280
or did work for Mullen & Company
as a writer. He's also a novelist.

273
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
We know that he works in the office of
Mr. Charles Colson at the White House.

274
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,680
<i>And the CIA.</i>

275
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,000
And the CIA.

276
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,360
<i>If you're conducting</i>
<i>that kind of investigation...</i>

277
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,360
<i>then certainly it comes as no surprise</i>
<i>to you that Howard was with the CIA.</i>

278
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
No, no surprise at all.

279
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,920
Hunt worked for the CIA till 1970.

280
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,320
From '49 to '70.
Now, this is on deep background...

281
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,760
but the FBI thinks
he's involved with the break-in.

282
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,920
What else you got?

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,440
According to White House personnel...

284
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,680
Hunt definitely worked there
as a consultant for Colson.

285
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
That's Charles Colson,
the President's Special Counsel.

286
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,760
Did you call the White House Press Office?

287
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,160
I went over there. I talked to them.

288
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,680
They said Hunt hadn't worked there
for three months.

289
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,320
Then a PR guy said this weird thing to me.

290
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,280
He said, "I'm convinced
that neither Mr. Colson...

291
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,760
"nor anyone at the White House...

292
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,120

or participation in...

293
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,720

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,440
-Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
-Absolutely.

295
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,320
So?

296
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,640
I never asked about Watergate.

297
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,440
I simply asked what were Hunt's duties
at the White House.

298
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,200
They volunteered he was innocent
when nobody asked if he was guilty.

299
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,200
Be careful how you write it.

300
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,840
Looks like we've got a White House
consultant linked to the bugging.

301
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,200
Harry, this isn't a police story anymore.
This is national.

302
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,920
We need a top political writer on it.

303
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,600
Well, they don't want it.

304
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,920
They're all over the goddamned map
covering the Primaries.

305
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,720
Besides, this guy has busted his ass.

306
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,960
He's been on this paper
for only nine months.

307
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,160
-What's the matter with you?
-He's a humper!

308
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
What's he been writing about,
rat shit in restaurants?

309
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,920
-He's got no experience.
-He got a few of them closed, didn't he?

310
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,560
Minor incidents.
Small government agencies.

311
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,800
Have Mr. Moffitt come in here, please.
And see if Mr. Bradlee's free.

312
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,960
I want Ben to hear this.

313
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,120
Sure Moffitt'll want the story
for the National desk...

314
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,560
now that we've built it into something.

315
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,040
Even Bernstein's busting his ass!

316
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,160
I read that cockamamie memorandum
he wrote on the break-in.

317
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,480
All right, so some of it was bullshit.

318
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,080
What is the matter with you?

319
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,040
You told me yourself
you were going to fire him last month.

320
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,240
Look, he wants on the story bad.
They both do!

321
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,040
He knows a lot of people.

322
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,800
Howard, they're hungry!

323
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
You remember when you were hungry?

324
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,680
MAN: Hello. Can you get me Nigel....

325
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,120
Right away.

326
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,120
-How's it going?
-What are you doing?

327
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,560
-Polishing it a little.
-What?

328
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,280
-Polishing it.
-What's wrong with it?

329
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,960
Nothing. Nothing. It's good.

330
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,240
Then what are you doing with it?

331
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,880
I'm just helping. It's a little fuzzy.

332
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,320
May I have it?

333
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,960
I don't think you're saying what you mean.

334
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,400
I know exactly what I mean.

335
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,080
Not here, I can't tell from this whether...

336
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,880
Hunt works for Colson
or Colson works for Hunt.

337
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,800
-May I have it, please?
-Some of the conclusions--

338
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,720
-May I have it?
-Yes. I'm not looking for a fight.

339
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,080
I'm not looking for a fight, either.

340
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,320
I'm just aware of the fact that
you've only been here nine months.

341
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,920
What's that got to do with anything?

342
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,360
I've been in the business since I'm 16.

343
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,480
What are you saying?

344
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,160
I'm trying to tell you that
if you'd read mine and then read yours....

345
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
-May I read yours?
-Yeah.

346
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,760
I walked by, gave yours a glance,
it didn't look right...

347
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,360
so I just figured I'd refine it a little.

348
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,240
The first paragraph
has to have more clarity...

349
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,720
if the reader's going to understand it.

350
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,600
You don't mention Colson's name
till the third paragraph.

351
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,600
I think mine's better.
But you go ahead and read it.

352
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,760
If you think yours is better,
we'll give yours to the desk.

353
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,800
I've got Colson's name up front.

354
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,960
He's a White House consultant
and nobody knows it.

355
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,440
You're right.

356
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,600
Yours is better.

357
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,840
If you're going to do it, do it right.
Here are my notes.

358
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,880
If you're going to hype it,
hype it with the facts.

359
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,840
I don't mind what you did.
I mind the way you did it.

360
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,840
Woodward. Bernstein.

361
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,240
You're both on the story.
Now don't fuck it up.

362
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,600
CARL: Steuben, what's the name of
that girl that you bombed out with...

363
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,080
-that works in Colson's office?
-Sharon Lyle.

364
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
SHARON: Why are you looking at me
like that?

365
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,240
CARL: You're attractive.

366
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,440
You are very attractive.

367
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,320
You know, my girlfriend told me
to watch out for you.

368
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,520
-Who?
-I'm not giving any names.

369
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,920
Steuben said you worked for Colson.

370
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,200
Steuben's crazy.
I never worked for Colson.

371
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,520
That's what he said.

372
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,480
I worked for an assistant.
Colson was really big on secrets, anyway.

373
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,440
Even if I had worked for him,
I wouldn't know anything!

374
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,680
Did you know Howard Hunt?
Didn't he work in the office?

375
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah, I knew Howard.

376
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,280
-Nice?
-He's a nice person.

377
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,640
He's secretive, he is secretive,
but a decent man.

378
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,480
Do you have any idea what he did?

379
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,960
The White House said
he was doing some investigative work.

380
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,280
What do you say?

381
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
[Sharon chuckling]

382
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,560
-He was doing investigative work.
-On what?

383
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,880
-Different things.
-Like what?

384
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,920
She warned me.

385
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,560
I'm not going to take my book out.
I'm just asking you.

386
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,080
The scuttlebutt for a while was that
he was investigating Kennedy.

387
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,240
Go on.

388
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,240
The White House was real paranoid
about Teddy Kennedy.

389
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,080
I remember seeing a book about
Chappaquiddick on his desk.

390
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,960
And he was always getting material
out of the White House Library...

391
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,040
and the Library of Congress,
and anything he could find.

392
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,840
RECEPTIONIST: <i>White House Library.</i>

393
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,120
Hi, this is Carl Bernstein
of the <i>Washington Post...</i>

394
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,240
and I was just wondering
if you can remember...

395
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,120
any books that a Howard Hunt
checked out on Senator Kennedy?

396
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,840
<i>-Howard Hunt?</i>
-Yes, ma'am.

397
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,840
<i>Yes, I think I do remember.</i>

398
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,360
<i>He took out a whole lot of material.</i>

399
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,200
<i>-Why don't you hold on and I'll see?</i>
-I sure will. Thank you very much.

400
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,560
<i>-Mr. Bernstein?</i>
-Yes, ma'am?

401
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,160
<i>-I was wrong.</i>
-I beg your pardon?

402
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,600
<i>The truth is, I don't have a card</i>
<i>that says Mr. Hunt took any material.</i>

403
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,960
<i>I don't remember getting material for....</i>

404
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,960
<i>I do remember getting material</i>
<i>for somebody, but it wasn't for Mr. Hunt.</i>

405
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,280
All right.

406
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,640
<i>The truth is, I didn't have any requests</i>
<i>at all from Mr. Hunt.</i>

407
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,760
<i>The truth is, I don't know any Mr. Hunt.</i>

408
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,480
I was just wondering
if you have any books.... Hello?

409
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,040
BOB: Yes,
we're checking that information now.

410
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,920
We'd just like to find out
just what it was that Hunt did...

411
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,320
when he worked out as a White House
consultant on the Pentagon Papers.

412
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
Yes, I'd appreciate that, if you could.

413
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
Yes, sir. Thank you.

414
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,040
I just got off the phone
with the White House librarian.

415
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,280
You want to look at the notes on it?

416
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,400
This is some stuff from
the Eisenhower campaign in 1952...

417
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,640
that Hunt was connected with.

418
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Did you call the
White House Communications Office?

419
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,080
No, I just got off the phone
with the librarian.

420
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,320
-524-743.
-I know the number.

421
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,240
Between the first and second quote
there's a complete contradiction.

422
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,800
It's a space of about five seconds.

423
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,040
-My feeling is--
-Was this all....

424
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,200
SECRETARY: <i>Mr. Clawson's office.</i>

425
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,960
This is Bob Woodward
of the <i>Washington Post.</i>

426
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,480
-Could I talk to Mr. Clawson, please?
<i>-One moment, please.</i>

427
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,800
Thank you.

428
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,200
When she came back
she said she didn't even know--

429
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,640
<i>-Ken Clawson.</i>
-Mr. Clawson, this is Bob Woodward.

430
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,160
Carl Bernstein of the <i>Washington Post</i>
had a conversation...

431
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,680
with a White House librarian...

432
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,080
on some books a Mr. Howard Hunt
took out on Senator Edward Kennedy.

433
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,440
She first said that Howard Hunt
had taken out books on Senator Kennedy...

434
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,680
and then she denied even knowing
who he was.

435
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,480
I was wondering if you'd like to comment
on this confusion.

436
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,720
<i>Listen, let me call you back on this matter.</i>

437
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,560
<i>-I'm going to check on it for you.</i>
-All right, thank you. Bye.

438
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,880
-Call back?
-Yes.

439
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,920
-This was all one conversation?
-Yeah.

440
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,880
She says first of all,
"I think I got a bunch of books on Hunt."

441
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,920
She comes back five seconds later, she
says, "I don't even know a Mr. Hunt."

442
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,120
It's obvious someone got to her.

443
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,560
Not enough proof.
I mean, if there was just a piece of paper...

444
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,600
that said that Hunt was taking out books
on Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.

445
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,320
Like a.... I don't know, library slip.

446
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,320
Hunt also took out books
from the Library of Congress...

447
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,440
but what's more important is that
somebody got to her in that space of time.

448
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,000
-How do you know somebody got to her?
-Because she said that Hunt....

449
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,840
There was a lot of books
that Hunt checked out.

450
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,840
And then she comes back
and she don't even know him.

451
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,720
-Woodward.
<i>-Mr. Woodward, Ken Clawson calling back.</i>

452
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,560
<i>-I've just talked with the librarian.</i>
-Yes, sir.

453
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,720
<i>She denies that the conversation</i>
<i>with Mr. Bernstein ever took place.</i>

454
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,080
<i>She said she referred him</i>
<i>to the Press Office.</i>

455
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,080
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you say
she denies even knowing...

456
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,840
about the conversation taking place?

457
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,600
<i>That's right. She said someone</i>
<i>did call her asking about Mr. Hunt...</i>

458
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,360
<i>but all she did was refer him</i>
<i>to the Press Office...</i>

459
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,600
<i>and she denies that...</i>

460
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,960
<i>-any other conversation took place.</i>
-Total bullshit.

461
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,120
<i>-I hope that's been of some help to you.</i>
-Thank you.

462
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,000
-We've got to get something on paper.
-The Library of Congress.

463
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,920
BOB: Mona?

464
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,720
Excuse me, Mona, could you take
any calls for me, please?

465
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,400
-Sure.
-Here's my note.

466
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,040
If I get any calls....

467
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,560
-Will you be back later?
-I don't know when.

468
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,520
You want all the material
requested by the White House?

469
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,680
All White House transactions
are confidential.

470
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,680
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

471
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,840
-We need a sympathetic face.
-We're not going to find one here.

472
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
You want every request since when?

473
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,760
CARL: When did he start?
BOB: July of '71.

474
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,760
CARL: I imagine the whole last year.

475
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,560
I'm not sure you want them,
but I've got them.

476
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,560
Maybe they pulled the cards.

477
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,960
Maybe they changed the names.

478
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,960
There might have been a card there,
and we missed it.

479
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,680
Hey, wait a minute.

480
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,520
I met a White House aide once
at a social occasion.

481
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,880
-So?
-He might confirm.

482
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,560
BOB: Do we need W.H. in White House?
CARL: Not in the second paragraph.

483
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
-I don't think we do. Do we?
-White House will be enough.

484
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,640
-White House.
-Just use White House. Forget the W.H.

485
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,120
I want to know about Colson.
What was his job at the White House?

486
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,080
-Special consultant to the President.
-I gotta say it.

487
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,880
These notes on the White House librarian,
are they accurate?

488
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,320
The White House librarian,
the notes, are they accurate?

489
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,120
Yeah, but I wanna hear him say it.

490
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,960
-Okay, let's have it.
-Here you are, Ben.

491
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,760
It's a good, solid piece
of American journalism...

492
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,320
that the <i>New York Times</i> doesn't have.

493
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
You haven't got it.

494
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,600
A librarian and a secretary saying
Hunt looked at a book.

495
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,720
That's not good enough.

496
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,960
A White House aide told me
that Hunt was investigating Kennedy.

497

"Showed a special interest."

502
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,560
No, we said the White House
was investigating Kennedy.

503
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,280
"Showed a special interest in him."

504
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,760
Jesus, the story's stronger than that.

505
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,160
The White House librarian says
Hunt checked out a lot of books.

506
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,880
We got a secretary in Colson's office

for the Kennedys.

-Bullshit. We had it.

-No, we didn't.
-Why didn't you say something?

514
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,800
Do you think bitching about it is going
to get the story where we want it?

Hunt worked for Colson

Hunt was investigating Kennedy
at Chappaquiddick.

-You'll hear more.
-Will he talk?

547

I was at a party once, and...

Liddy put his hand over a candle,
and he kept it there.

549
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,160
He kept it right in the flame
until his flesh was burned.

550

And Liddy said, "The trick is not minding."

more time with his family.

Fifteen phone calls.

574
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,960
At least 15 phone calls and those phone
calls were made as early as March 15...

before the break-in.

819
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,600
Incidentally, that's a great parallel story...

820
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,320
if you're going to do that piece on détente.

821
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,920
Right, "Queen Elizabeth proclaims
a state of emergency...

822
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,080
"to deal with what we call a 'dock strike."'

823
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,440
Breaking it off...

824
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,680
[All laughing]

825
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,560
I'll give you a human interest.

826
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,560
"Thirty-one days of rain
in the Philippines...

827
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,000
"is being blamed on the theft
of a statue of Jesus."

828
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,840
We had one like that before.

829
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,920
-I'll put my best writer on that.
-What about the one in lndia?

830
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,040
Laugh, gentlemen,
it'll be the only story everyone reads.

831
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,240
Okay, National?

832
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,640
We have the Bremer diary.
"Wish to kill Nixon."

833
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,200
He took a car trip to New York,
Ottawa, and Washington to kill him.

834
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,800
We have the "Senate approving
the ABM Treaty."

835
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,200
ABM.

836
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,200
Of course, we have
"McGovern offering the VP spot..."

837
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,720
to everybody.

838
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,080
-Yeah, that's news.
-I have--

839
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,480
Because everybody's been offered it.

840
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,480
Now, I'll tell you what will be news.
When somebody accepts it. That's news.

841
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,600
Here is some great art.

842
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,160
McGovern and Humphrey at breakfast,
smiling their asses off.

843
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,800
Isn't that great?

844
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,600
-He says, "I am George's friend..."
-Why is that man smiling?

845
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,040
Sounds friendly. Very friendly.

846
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,880
"I'll be helping him in ways
he never dreamed possible."

847
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,680
Breakfast followed by lunch.

848
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,880
Okay. Metro?

849
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,320
Well, we got the schoolteachers
on Capitol Hill.

850
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,440
They want a 17% increase in pay
or this fall they go on strike.

851
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,520
Harry, I think we could mention
that this might be the time...

852
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,040
to go to the front page
on the district home rule.

853
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,920
-Oh, come on!
-Listen to him.

854
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,760
Ben, this time it could go all the way.

855
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,720
The House is going to vote next week
on a Senate resolution.

856
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,200
Okay then, well, when they pass it,
we'll run with it.

857
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,600
Okay, fellas,
let's go around again now. Foreign?

858
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,760
Taiwan emergency, Philippines.

859
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,160
Okay, fine. National?

860
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,760
I'll stand on the Eagleton follow-ups...

861
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,520
McGovern not being able
to get a replacement.

862
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,360
He's offered it to Humphrey, Kennedy,
and Ribicoff. All turned him down.

863
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,680
That's the Page 1 lead right there.

864
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,400
You're ignoring the importance
of the Dahlberg repercussions.

865
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,600
Nobody cares about
the Dahlberg repercussions.

866
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,200
Now look, it was our story
that got the General Accounting Office...

867
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,200
to start an audit with CREEP Finance.

868
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,640
We printed that didn't we? When the
frigging audit's done, we'll print that, too.

869
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,520
Let me tell you what happened today.

870
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,080
I was having lunch
at the Sans Souci, and...

871
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,600
this White House guy, a good one, a pro...

872
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,960
came up and asked me, "What is this
Watergate compulsion with you guys?"

873
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,160
Compulsion? This is a story.
This is not compulsion.

874
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,800
I said, "Well, we think it's important."
And he said:

875
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,560
"If it's so goddamn important, who in
the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?"

876
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,640
Now, what do you expect him to say
from the White House?

877
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,000
"You're doing a great job"?

878
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,480
Why don't you ask him
what he's really saying?

879
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,840
He wants to take the story away
from Woodstein and...

880
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,960
-give it to his National desk.
-At least I have...

881
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,480
some experienced guys sitting around
who know the politicians...

882
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,640
-who have the contacts.
-We're aware of that.

883
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,440
You said it. Sitting around.

884
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,840
Ben, it's a dangerous story for this paper.

885
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,680
-What if your boys get it wrong?
-Then it's our ass, isn't it?

886
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,120
We all have to go out
and work for a living.

887
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,840
National gets eight columns.

888
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,480
Nine for Foreign.

889
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,680
Metro, 15.

890
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,080
That's it, fellas.

891
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,320
Hey, Scott, I need to see you.

892
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,480
How dangerous?

893
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,360
Well, it's not just that we're using
unnamed sources that bothers me...

894
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,720
or that everything we print,
the White House denies...

895
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,240
or that almost no other papers
are reprinting our stuff.

896
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,600
What then?

897
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,400
Look, there are over 2,000 reporters
in this town...

898
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,520
are there five on Watergate?

899
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,760
Where did the <i>Washington Post</i>
suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom?

900
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,800
Why would the Republicans do it?

901
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,480
McGovern is self-destructing, just like
Humphrey, Muskie, the bunch of them.

902
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,320
I don't believe their story.

903
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,240
It doesn't make sense.

904
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,600
Yeah, Bernstein.

905
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,920
Now? All right.

906
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,760
Woodward, Bradlee will see us now.

907
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,240
Answer the phone for me, will you?

908
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,360
Are you trying to find the
lowest possible common denominator....

909
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,960
Ben, it's the hottest item.

910
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,600
-It's in over 500 papers.
-What is it?

911
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,640
Yesterday's weather report
for people who were drunk...

912
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,920
and slept all day.

913
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,040
Jesus! Send it out...

914
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,880
to the <i>San Francisco Chronicle.</i>
They need it.

915
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,280
-How about the crossword puzzle?
-No.

916
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,560
Anagrams?

917
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,160
-No space, Mickey.
-Goodbye.

918
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,840
The last thing you bought
from me was the obituaries.

919
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,720
-Make him buy something, will you?
-All right.

920
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,200
Hey, what do you guys want?

921
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,160
The GAO report's due out
the morning of Nixon's renomination.

922
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,520
Sit down.

923
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,080
Well, that's two weeks from now.

924
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,520
Since they're only responsible
to Congress...

925
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,400
there's no way the White House
can control the investigation.

926
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,720
There's a source over
at General Accounting that tells us...

927
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,120
there's a whole rat's nest
of illegal shit going on over at CREEP.

928
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,960
-Like what?
-Like a slush fund.

929
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,600
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
of unaccounted-for cash.

930
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,200
Hundreds of thousands of dollars?

931
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,480
Any comment from CREEP?

932
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,800
Yes. Unavailable for comment.
They're not talking.

933
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,200
But what else besides the money?
Where's the goddamn story?

934
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,920
The money's the key to whatever this is.

935
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,480
-Says who?
-Deep Throat.

936
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,680
-Who?
-Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak...

937
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,320
his source in the executive--

938
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,000
Garage freak? Jesus, what kind of a crazy,
fucking story is this?

939
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,960
Who did you say?

940
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,560
He's on deep background.
I call him "Deep Throat."

941
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,600
Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing...

942
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,520
Nixon's guaranteed the renomination...

943
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,560
and the <i>Post</i> is stuck
with a story no one else wants.

944
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,160
lt'll sink the goddamn paper.

945
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,600
Everyone says, "Get off it, Ben."
And I come on very sage...

946
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,400
and I say, "You'll see.
You wait till this bottoms out."

947
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,640
But the truth is,
I can't figure out what we've got.

948
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,760
What else are you working on?

949
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,720
We're after a list of CREEP employees.

950
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,920
-Where is it?
-It's classified.

951
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,120
-How are you gonna get it?
-We haven't had any luck, yet.

952
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,600
Get some.

953
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,040
Anything else?

954
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,640
You made a mistake in there.

955
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,160
What?

956
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,400
You said to Brad
that we haven't had any luck yet...

957
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,040
and that's the thing that he jumps on.
You can't talk about luck.

958
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,640
If you can't talk in specifics,
you shouldn't say anything.

959
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,480
Is there any place you don't smoke?

960
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,720
-What?
-Hold it.

961
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,160
-What're you doing?
-Kay Eddy.

962
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,160
BOB: Doesn't she go with a guy that
works for the Committee to Re-Elect?

963
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,000
KAY: The E.R.
MAN: <i>All right.</i>

964
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,240
-Eddy? Hey. Kay, can--
-Just a second.

965
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,520
<i>-757-6521.</i>
-Okay, I'll get back to you on this, thanks.

966
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,000
Don't you go with a guy that works
for the Committee to Re-Elect?

967
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,680
-Not anymore.
-You did go with him, though.

968
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,520
I think you were engaged to him,
weren't you?

969
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,600
-Yeah.
-You got out of it?

970
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,200
-So?
-You're looking better.

971
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Look, we need a list of the people
that work there.

972
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,720
Do you think that....

973
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,800
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

974
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,000
It's personal.

975
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,440
What do you mean? You said it was over.

976
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,480
You're asking me to use a guy
I care about.

977
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,040
CARL: No.
We're not asking you to use him...

978
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,160
Well, sure--

979
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,600
CARL: ...just to help us.
I mean, we'd do the same for you.

980
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,880
My only chance of getting that story
is if I see him.

981
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,720
I don't want to see him again.

982
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,040
-Do you have to see him?
-Sure, I have to see him.

983
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,400
No. Do you have to see him that way?

984
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,160
Can't you just call him up
on the telephone...

985
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,400
and say you want to have
a drink with him, just feel him out?

986
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,080
You say the relationship is over.
What the hell do you have to lose?

987
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,200
Forget it.

988
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,080
We don't want you to do anything
that would embarrass you...

989
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,560
or that you don't feel right about.

990
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,520
Forget it.

991
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,720
Don't let her just get off.
I think she was going to say something.

992
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,320
You just overdramatized it,
she was going to give us what we want.

993
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,440
It's over.

994
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,880
-What?
-It's over.

995
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,400
CARL: Is this the whole list?

996
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,000
BOB: Look what it says. "Personnel,
Committee to Re-Elect the President."

997
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,480
CARL: This is all in alphabetical order.
You can't tell who works for who.

998
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,480
BOB: Well, find out the department heads
like Mitchell, Magruder, Stans.

999
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,760
CARL: Here. John Mitchell.

1000
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,360
BOB: What's the number?
CARL: 301.

1001
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,880
BOB: All right. Find somebody
who has a number close to it.

1002
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,560
BOB: They probably work for him.
CARL: There's a 303.

1003
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,720
Okay.

1004
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,440
CARL: <i>We have to find out how the money</i>
<i>got from Maurice Stans to the burglars.</i>

1005
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,480
BOB: <i>Somebody who worked in Finance.</i>

1006
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,040
CARL: <i>All right. Here's the head of Finance.</i>
<i>Maurice Stans, 269.</i>

1007
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,920
BOB: <i>If we can just get somebody</i>
<i>who works under Stans.</i>

1008
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,640
CARL: <i>Sloan? You need him?</i>
BOB: <i>He's the treasurer.</i>

1009
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,680
BOB: <i>What's the number?</i>
CARL: <i>Hugh Sloan, 287.</i>

1010
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,480
BOB: <i>Is there a secretary?</i>

1011
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,120
BOB: <i>Wait a minute. Manley.</i>
<i>Here it is. lrene Manley?</i>

1012
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,280
<i>1406 Lee Jackson Memorial Highway.</i>

1013
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,800
-Hi, I'm Bob Woodward.
-I'm Carl Bernstein.

1014
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,960
We're from the <i>Washington Post.</i>

1015
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,240
We'd like to know if we could
speak to you for a few minutes.

1016
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,680
We understand your daughter works
for the Committee to Re-Elect.

1017
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,800
-Wouldn't be anything embarrassing.
-Would you object to just--

1018
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,920
-Yes?
-Hi.

1019
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,360
Miss Milland? Betty Milland?

1020
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,160
-I'm Bob Woodward.
-Carl Bernstein.

1021
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,520
We're from the <i>Washington Post.</i>

1022
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,240
I know you're trying to do your job.
I mean....

1023
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,840
You don't understand
the pressure that we're under.

1024
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,960
It'll just take a couple of seconds.
If we can just come in for a couple of--

1025
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,760
-No, I really don't--
-We don't want to come in.

1026
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,600
We understand that there was
some documents...

1027
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,440
that were shredded at the Committee.

1028
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,880
Well, there....

1029
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,480
There's often shredding. We do that a lot.

1030
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,760
-Were you there during the shredding?
-Yes, I was.

1031
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,360
I see.
Were there any department heads from...

1032
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,080
the Committee who were also present?

1033
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,600
Yes. Mr. Mitchell came in one night.

1034
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,960
John Mitchell? The Attorney General?

1035
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,240
He was carrying a raincoat over his head.

1036
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,520
I thought he was going to go....

1037
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,760
Did he supervise the shredding?

1038
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,320
Can I not answer any more questions?
I'd just soon not....

1039
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,360
Okay? Maybe I could call you?

1040
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,680
-Are you being told not to talk?
-Will you call us?

1041
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,640
I don't know.

1042
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,160
I'll try.

1043
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,640
What about all that shredding
that took place after the break-in?

1044
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,680
Need to know more about the papers
that were in shredding.

1045
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,320
I think you've some idea
what's in the papers...

1046
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,200
when the former Attorney General
comes to the office...

1047
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,920
when it's taking place
at the Committee to Re-Elect...

1048
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,880
and got a raincoat over his head.
Why's he in a raincoat?

1049
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,360
Could be raining
is what could've happened.

1050
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,560
Let me go through the story again.

1051
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,880
You got a woman who's frightened
at the door. Works for CREEP.

1052
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,960
She said there's shredding taking place.
We don't know what's in the papers.

1053
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,000
We know the former Attorney General
comes in with an overcoat over his head.

1054
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,720
It could be raining.
There's a lawyer present.

1055
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,960
We don't know what he asked them.
She wouldn't talk about it.

1056
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,760
Now, will you please tell me
where there's a story?

1057
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,960
There's a story in the fact that the
interview did not take place in her home...

1058
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,600
but in the office
of the Committee to Re-Elect.

1059
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,160
How's there a story in that?
It's not enough!

1060
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,160
There's a story
because there's a lawyer in the office.

1061
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,240
-I mean, you're more resistant than she is.
-That's right.

1062
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,200
-Why?
-Because there's not enough fact.

1063
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,160
CARL: <i>Let's just turn around and go back</i>
<i>and question her again.</i>

1064
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,800
-This won't take long at all. We just want--
-Please go away, okay?

1065
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,240
Will you please leave before they see you.

1066
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,360
-Who did you mean by--
-Who do you mean, "they"?

1067
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,320
Could you give us their names?

1068
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,760
We haven't revealed the sources
of people that have talked to us.

1069
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,720
You know, I really can't talk
about this because--

1070
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,080
Would "they" be members
of the Committee?

1071
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,520
CARL: <i>Someone got to that woman.</i>

1072
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,080
<i>It's the key to the whole cover-up.</i>

1073
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,760
<i>How can you write that</i>
<i>there's a cover-up?</i>

1074
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,240
<i>We don't know that there's a cover-up!</i>

1075
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,160
Well, then, I don't know
what the hell you need.

1076
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,360
So, you tell me what you need.

1077
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,640
I need more fact for a story
is what I need...

1078
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,280
and I think you should
need the same thing.

1079
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,080
Okay, if you get in the car...

1080
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,720
and there's music playing
in the car, hypothetically.

1081
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,720
There's music playing in the car
for 10 minutes...

1082
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,240
and there's no commercial.
What can you deduce from that?

1083
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,800
-Is it AM or FM?
-Come on, Bernstein!

1084
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,080
Is it AM or FM?

1085
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,760
A guy can come up to me on the street
and he can ask me an address.

1086
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,840
Now, is the man interrogating me,
or is he lost?

1087
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,240
What kind of a story do I write?

1088
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,160
What kind of a deduction
do I make from that?

1089
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,400
Because you don't have a gut feeling
that the woman is trying to help us?

1090
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,240
No, I don't have enough gut feeling
and I wish I did.

1091
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,840
We're from the <i>Washington Post....</i>

1093
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,480

1096
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,960
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-It's almost like there's a pattern...</i>

1097
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,080
<i>to the way they're not talking.</i>

1098
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,200
<i>The way they say "no"all the time.</i>
<i>I think it's odd.</i>

1099
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,320
-Mrs. Hambling?
-Yes.

1100
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,760
Hi, we're from the <i>Washington Post.</i>

1101
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,760
I'm Carl Bernstein, this is Bob Woodward.

1102
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,760
A friend of the Committee said
that we could contact you.

1103
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,800
-Who was it?
-We can't reveal that.

1104
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,160
You can talk to us.
We don't reveal our sources.

1105
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,760
You people....

1106
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,960
You think you can come into my home,
ask a few questions...

1107
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,840
have me destroy the reputations
of men that I work for and respect?

1108
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,400
Do you understand loyalty?

1109
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,720
Have you ever heard of loyalty?

1110
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,200
-Hi.
-Yes?

1111
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,440
I'm Bob Woodward.

1112
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,320
Carl Bernstein.
We're from the <i>Washington Post.</i>

1113
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,440
Yes.

1114
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,280
I've read what you've written.
I want to thank you.

1115
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,440
I've been a Republican all my life,
but this goes beyond party politics.

1116
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,960
Would you mind if we asked you
a few questions?

1117
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,520
No. Come in. Would you like coffee?

1118
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,600
Sure.

1119
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,680
What they've done
is a threat to the Constitution.

1120
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,000
It goes against everything we stand for.

1121
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,760
Could you be a little bit more specific
than that?

1122
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,520
I'm afraid your articles
have just scratched the surface.

1123
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,320
You don't mind if I just take a few notes,
do you?

1124
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,440
No.

1125
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,680
How long have you worked
at the Committee?

1126
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,120
Committee?

1127
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,000
Yes, the Committee
to Re-Elect the President.

1128
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,960
Oh, I don't work at the Committee
to Re-Elect the President.

1129
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,640
I work at Garfinkel's,
in the accounting department.

1130
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,280
-Miss Abbott?
-Yes.

1131
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,400
Judith Abbott?

1132
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,160
Carolyn Abbott.

1133
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,240
We're just doing something wrong.

1134
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,600
-Never been there.
-No.

1135
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,680
We're doing something wrong.

1136
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,240
It's just not good enough.

1137
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,720
How can you keep going at something
past the point when you believe it?

1138
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,840
We just have to start all over again.

well, it 's been postponed

They're going to bury the report

I just want to ask you
a couple of questions.

Well, you don't want me.
You want my sister.

It's for you. It's Carl Bernstein.

1196
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,000
Oh, my God. He's the guy from the <i>Post.</i>
Get rid of him.

1197
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,960
Could I just borrow one
of your cigarettes there?

1198
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,120
Sure.

1199
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,840
You've really got to go.

1200
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,000
Sure. Could I just get a match?

1201
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,680
I can understand your being afraid.

1202
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,760
There's a lot of people
at the Committee just like you...

1203
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,040
who wanted to tell the truth
but some people wouldn't listen.

1204
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,600
Certain people have gone back
to the prosecutors and the FBI...

1205
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,400
to give information
which they were never asked.

1206
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,640
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when
he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance...

1207
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,080
and we were just wondering if you were...

1208
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,000
promoted to work for Mr. Stans
immediately after Mr. Sloan quit...

1209
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,520
or whether there was some time lapse?

1210
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,640
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.

1211
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,000
Can I get you some coffee or something?

1212
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,960

1216

Sure, you can sit down,
but I'm not going to tell you anything.

1217
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,080
Okay.

1218
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,280
I was just curious why you lied just then.

1219
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,800
Have you been threatened
if you tell the truth?

1220
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,840
No.

1221
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,680
Never in so many words.

1222
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,600
-How do you like it?
-Just milk.

1223
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,400
-Thanks.
-Okay, I'll just get that.

1224
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,800
I saw in the wires
that Mrs. Stans was in the hospital.

1225
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,680
Is she feeling better?

1226
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,640
The GAO, the General Accounting
Report said that...

1227
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,920
there was $350,000 in the safe of
the Committee to Re-Elect the President.

1228
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,520
Were you aware that it was that kind
of funds from the very beginning?

1229
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,680
A lot of people are watching me.
They know I know a lot.

1230
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,920
Was it all in $100 bills?

1231
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,800
A lot of it was.

1232
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,680
I thought it was
an all-purpose, political fund...

1233
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,640
you know, for taking fat cats to dinner,
things like that.

1234
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,600
$350,000 for dinners?

1235
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,840
How was it paid out?

1236
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,840
Not in one big chunk.

1237
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,320
There was a list of 15 names
and the amount of money...

1238
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,640
given to each person next to the name.

1239
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,120
What happened to the list?

1240
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,840
It was destroyed. It was the only record.

1241
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,720
Don't pay attention to this.
This is for my memory.

1242
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,200
I have a very bad memory.

1243
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,080
You won't be quoted by name.

1244
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,200
In fact, we get confirmations
before we print anything.

1245
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,680
I can't be...

1246
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,880
positive that that money was used
for the break-in, you understand?

1247
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,240
Yes, I do.

1248
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,440
-But, people sure are worried.
-Which people?

1249
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,760
Think you could help me
with the disbursement of money...

1250
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,440
in terms of the number of people
that were involved? How many?

1251
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,680
A group of them. About five.
I don't know their names.

1252
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,200
Would Mr. Sloan know?

1253
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,880
-Would he--
-I don't want to say anymore, okay?

1254
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,600
I won't be much longer.

1255
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:16,200
I wondered if you could just
help me a little bit about...

1256
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,680
the money. We hear all kinds of figures.

1257
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,760
-There's so much of it.
-How much is "so much"?

1258
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,160
In one two-day period, $6 million came in.

1259
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,760
-Six!
-Six million, cash.

1260
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,960
We didn't know where to put it all.

1261
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:42,280
I thought it was all legal.
I mean, I guess I did until...

1262
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,440
after the break-in when I remembered
Gordon got so much of it.

1263
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,960
-This is Mr. Liddy?
-It's all so rotten.

1264
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,240
It's getting worse.

1265
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,640
And the only one I care about
is Hugh Sloan.

1266
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:59,240
His wife was going to leave him if he
didn't stand up and do what was right.

1267
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,960
So, he quit.

1268
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,920
I was wondering...

1269
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:10,040
if Hugh Sloan was being set up now
as a fall guy for John Mitchell.

1270
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,600
What do you think?

1271
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,800
If you guys could get John Mitchell,
that would be beautiful.

1272
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,000
Coffee's cold.

1273
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,080
Is there any evidence that...

1274
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,480
any of Mr. Mitchell's assistants...

1275
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,720
were part of this?

1276
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,960
I had all the evidence. It was destroyed.
I don't know who destroyed it.

1277
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,240
-I think Gordon did a lot of shredding.
-Hard evidence?

1278
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,240
Well, I can't say that it would positively
prove that they planned the break-in...

1279
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,280
but it would come pretty close.

1280
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,760
Can you tell me anything
about who got the money?

1281
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,760
We have...

1282
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,480
had some help on this
from a couple of sources...

1283
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,360
and this is a way of confirming it.

1284
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,760
I don't want you to feel
that you're in a position...

1285
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,800
where you have to disclose names.

1286
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,200
I can just ask you initials...

1287
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,760
and then that way you're not
divulging any information.

1288
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,320
We have some idea.
Would that be all right?

1289
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,520
Was there an "M"?

1290
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,440
Can you just nod either way?

1291
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,560
Did it go that high up?

1292
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,560
"L"?

1293
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,400
I don't want to say any more, okay?

1294
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,680
I'm sorry. You said "L"...

1295
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,920
or...I get confused.

1296
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,200
Could we just go back for a second?

1297
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,920
In one six-day period,
over $6 million came in.

1298
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,960
You wouldn't believe what
was going on inside that woman.

1299
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,360
The stuff was just ready to pour out.

1300
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,600
I'm pouring down cups of coffee
trying to get it out of her...

1301
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,880
before she throws me out of the house.

1302
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,680
-Give me your notes so--
-These are the notes.

1303
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,960
-These are the notes?
-I've got stuff on napkins, matchbooks--

1304
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,120
I'm writing in the bathroom
while she's getting coffee.

1305
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,920
-I'm a walking litter basket!
-You're crazy.

1306
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,440
You'd be crazy, too,
if you were operating on 20 cups of coffee.

1307
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,240
Could you give me something
I can get down?

1308
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,520
I got it. I got it all.

1309
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,000
Okay. Write.

1310
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,440
-Mitchell was in control.
-Wait a minute.

1311
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,080
-There were men working under Mitchell--
-How many?

1312
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,240
I don't know how many,
but the men working under Mitchell...

1313
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,920
received the money from the slush fund.

1314
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,440
Do we know how much money?

1315
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,600
We're talking about
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1316
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,320
And these men are the key
to what that money was used for.

1317
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,800
Boy, that woman was paranoid.

1318
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,600
At one point, I suddenly wondered
how high up this thing goes...

1319
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,160
and her paranoia finally got to me.

1320
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,520
I thought what we had was so hot,
that any minute CBS or NBC...

1321
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,440
would come in through the windows
and take the story away.

1322
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,560
You're both paranoid.

1323
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,960
She's afraid of John Mitchell,
you're afraid of Walter Cronkite.

1324
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,080
-Right.
-Can we go back to what she said?

1325
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,440
Here. "L," "P," and "M."

1326
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,480
-What do you mean?
-It's "L," "P," and "M".

1327
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,320
-She'd only give initials.
-lnitials?

1328
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,680
The initials are the name of the men that
worked under Mitchell. "L," "P," and "M."

1329
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,520
You couldn't get the names?

1330
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,840
If I could've gotten the names,
I would've gotten the names!

1331
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,480
I'm with the woman,
trying to get anything I can.

1332
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,640
She said "L," "P," and "M,"
that's all she would give me...

1333
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,400
are the people who worked under Mitchell.

1334
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,120
She said something about Mitchell.
She hates him.

1335
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,560
She said, "John Mitchell....

1336
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,920
"If you guys could get John Mitchell,
that would be beautiful."

1337
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,400
Wait a minute, what's this here?
What are you writing about Sloan?

1338
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,440
"Sloan was the treasurer
of the Committee to Re-Elect.

1339
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,040
"His wife is pregnant and she made
Sloan quit because apparently...

1340
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,640
"he no longer wanted to be a part of it."

1341
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,840
We've got to go see Sloan.

1342
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,280
Okay. Make a note of it.
So, what have we got?

1343
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,560
Where's that matchbook?

1344
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,800
-Here.
-"L," "P," and "M."

1345
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,080
Okay, "L," "P," and "M."

1346
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,840
-"L" could be La Rue. It could be Liddy.
-"L" is Liddy.

1347
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,760
-How do we know that?
-Because she said it.

1348
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,200
Right here.
She said, "At the time of the break-in...

1349
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,920
"there was so much money
floating around...

1350
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,360
"that I know Gordon got part of it."

1351
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,400
So I said, "You mean Gordon Liddy?"
She said, "Yes."

1352
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,680
So, "L" is Liddy.
Okay, that leaves "P" and "M."

1353
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,240
"P" could be...

1354
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,080
Parkinson. It could be Porter. It could be--

1355
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,080
Wait a minute! There was a guy once.
There was a guy we talked to last week.

1356
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,800
Didn't he say
that there was a Bart Porter...

1357
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,800
who at one time was
a member of the Committee to Re-Elect?

1358
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,760
Porter was called before
the Grand Jury investigation.

1359
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,360
So "P" is definitely Porter.

1360
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,640
"P" could be Porter.

1361
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,680
"P" is Porter, "L" is Liddy.
All that leaves is "M"!

1362
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,600
"M" could be McCord? That's out.

1363
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,960
It could be Mardian.

1364
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,880
It could be...

1365
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,160
-Magruder!
-I think it's Magruder.

1366
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,400
-I think it's Magruder, too.
-Why do you think it's Magruder?

1367
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,000
Because he was second in command
under Mitchell.

1368
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,120
Why do you think it's Magruder?

1369
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,520
Because at one time
he was a temporary head...

1370
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,560
of the Committee to Re-Elect,
before Mitchell.

1371
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,680
I don't want a cookie.

1372
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,800
We've got to get that bookkeeper
to say it was Magruder.

1373
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,200
Never get her to say anything about "M."

1374
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,800
We have got to go back there
and try to get her to say it.

1375
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,000
If we could make names of the initials...

1376
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,400
then we'll know the people at CREEP
who paid off the burglars.

1377
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,040
We'll at least know who got the money.

1378
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,440
The indictments that came down
from the Grand Jury today...

1379
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,640
stopped...

1380
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,760
with the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.

1381
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,280
Carl, we have got to go back there
and get that bookkeeper...

1382
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,160
to say who the names are and not initials.

1383
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,440
She ain't going to give it to you...

1384
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,920
because I was with the woman
for six hours.

1385
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,200
-We have to try.
-Then you'll have to trick her, threaten her.

1386
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,920
-She's not going to do it.
-Wait a minute.

1387
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,040
-You know what we could do?
-What?

1388
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,080
-Listen, we go back there...
-Yeah.

1389
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,840
-...and you ask her who "P" is.
-Yeah.

1390
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,560
And then I say, "No, don't worry about it...

1391
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,160
"we know 'P' is Porter." I just bury it.

1392
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,360
Okay. Now, wait a minute.
I say to her, "Who is 'P'?"

1393
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,280
-And then you say to me--
-I say, "No, we know 'P' is Porter."

1394
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,040
-You mean, you try to fake her out?
-Right.

1395
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,640
-And what if she denies it?
-We're screwed.

1396
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,640
-So?
-But if she doesn't, we know we got it.

1397
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,920
-We know "P" is Porter.
-Try it.

1398
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,000
Hi.

1399
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,640
They'll see you.

1400
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,560
Not if you let us in, they won't.

1401
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,160
And I'm Bob Woodward.

1402
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,400
-They'll see your car.
-We parked around the corner.

1403
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,720
You have answers
for everything, don't you?

1404
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,240
If we did, we wouldn't be here.

1405
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,560
You wrote what I told you.

1406
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,600
Oh, no. Not your name.
No one knows it was you.

1407
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,800
Could you tell us who got the money?

1408
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,840
And how much?

1409
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,880
You mean like, "What did you do
with the $25,000, lady?"

1410
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,280
What?

1411
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,000
Little jokes they're making
down at Finance these days.

1412
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,240
If people are to be convinced...

1413
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,360
that Stans and Sloan are innocent,
then our reporting must be precise...

1414
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,000
and you can help us.

1415
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,120
Who is "P"?

1416
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,920
"P" we know, is Porter.
You said, "$25,000."

1417
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,360
Is that how much Porter got?

1418
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,440
Was it more?

1419
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,240
Was it more than $50,000?

1420
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:49,480
Was Magruder the only "M"
to receive money?

1421
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,720
Who told you about Porter?

1422
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,440
TV INTERVIEWER: <i>I'd like to move on now...</i>

1423
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,800
<i>to the subject of the break-in</i>
<i>at the Watergate...</i>

1424
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,360
<i>and the controversies</i>
<i>that keep coming up out of that.</i>

1425
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,520
<i>It has recently,</i>
<i>very recently been reported now, that...</i>

1426
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,200
<i>some documents were torn up...</i>

1427
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,560
<i>at the Committee</i>
<i>to Re-Elect the President.</i>

1428
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,840
<i>Are you investigating the tearing up</i>
<i>of those documents--</i>

1429
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,520
ATTORNEY GENERAL: <i>I think that came out</i>
<i>in a story in the</i> Washington Post.

1430
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,480
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-I think the investigation...</i>

1431
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,280
<i>that has just concluded itself...</i>

1432
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,560
<i>has probably been</i>
<i>one of the most intensive...</i>

1433
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:30,240
<i>that the Department of Justice</i>
<i>and the FBI has ever been involved in.</i>

1434
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,360
<i>Some 1,500 persons were interviewed...</i>

1435
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,600
<i>1,800 leads were followed,</i>
<i>333 agents were involved...</i>

1436
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,320
<i>14,000 man-hours...</i>

1437
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,120
<i>fifty-one of the 59 FBI field officers</i>
<i>were involved.</i>

1438
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,840
<i>And that, I think...</i>

1439
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,320
<i>is a great credit to justice in this country.</i>

1440
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,480
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>that documents had been destroyed?</i>

1441
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,640
<i>No, I did not.</i>

1442
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,760
All these neat little houses
and all these nice little streets.

1443
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,440
It's hard to believe that something's
wrong in some of those little houses.

1444
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,280
No, it isn't.

1445
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,920
-Hello, I'm Carl Bernstein.
-Bob Woodward.

1446
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
We'd just like to talk to Mr. Sloan
for a couple of minutes.

1447
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,920
-He's resting right now.
-Are you Mrs. Sloan?

1448
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,280
-You're the two from the <i>Post,</i> aren't you?
-Yes.

1449
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,360
This is an honest house.

1450
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,120
That's why we'd like to see your husband.

1451
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,520
Faced with certain criminal charges
that might be brought...

1452
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,680
against some people that are innocent,
we just feel that--

1453
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,600
It's really for his benefit.

1454
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,080
No, it's not.

1455
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,640
No, it's not.

1456
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,480
SLOAN: Deborah, tell them to come in.

1457
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,840
Thanks.

1458
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,320
-Hi, Carl Bernstein.
-How do you do? Hugh Sloan.

1459
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,760
-Bob Woodward.
-How are you doing?

1460
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,280
I appreciate you giving us the time.

1461
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,200
You know, the reason
that we're here, basically...

1462
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,040
is that we've talked
to certain people who...

1463
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,160
have indicated that the reason
you left the Committee...

1464
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,600
was because you no longer
want to be part of it.

1465
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,640
Yeah, right. Maybe there's
a legitimate explanation...

1466
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,840
why the money was handed
to Liddy and Mitchell's aides.

1467
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,760
Try to understand this.

1468
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,200
-I'm a Republican.
-I am, too.

1469
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,520
Well, I believe in Richard Nixon.

1470
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,480
I worked in the White House
for four years and so did my wife.

1471
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,560
What happened on June 17, I don't
think the President knew anything about.

1472
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,200
Is it possible that some of his people
might have known?

1473
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,360
I'm not sure about that.

1474
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,400
Do you think the truth
will ever come out at the trial?

1475
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,280
-That's another thing I'm not sure about.
-Why?

1476
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,920
Well, obviously, because certain people
lied to the prosecutor.

1477
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,160
No.
We were never told flat out, "Don't talk! "

1478
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,000
But the message was clear, though.

1479
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,000
In other words, by their very silence,
there was a cover-up.

1480
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,760
Well, they didn't urge us
to come forward and tell the truth.

1481
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,800
"They," meaning the White House?

1482
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,000
Well, the Committee's not
an independent operation.

1483
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,000
Everything's cleared
with the White House.

1484
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:56,160
And I don't think the FBI or
the prosecutors understand that.

1485
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,120
That report on the cash...

1486
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,680
in the CREEP safe, that $350,000?

1487
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,120
-No, more.
-Was that a correct figure?

1488
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,440
No, it was closer to $1,000,000.

1489
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,400
And, as treasurer,
you could release those funds?

1490
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,000
When so ordered.

1491
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,640
We don't know the names of the people
who could order you.

1492
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,840
-We just know that there were four.
-No, there were five.

1493
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,640
Mitchell, Stans, Magruder,
they're obvious.

1494
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:24,680
-There had to be a White House overseer.
-Yeah, Colson.

1495
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,680
No, Colson's too smart to get involved
directly with anything like that.

1496
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,080
It's Haldeman.

1497
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,400
Right?

1498
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,560
I won't talk about the other two.

1499
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,440
They both worked at the White House?

1500
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,000
One of them did, the other one's not
in Washington. But that's all I'll say.

1501
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,200
-Kalmbach.
-Nixon's personal lawyer.

1502
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,440
-Right?
-Nixon's personal lawyer?

1503
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,760
I can't say anything. I'm sorry.

1504
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,560
-Well....
-When's the baby due?

1505
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,480
Soon. Next month.

1506
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,840
-Are you going to stay here?
-No, I don't think so.

1507
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,720
Decided where you're gonna go?

1508
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,240
I've been looking for a job
in the private sector, but it's....

1509
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,520
It's very hard.
My name's been in the papers too much.

1510
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:14,320
You know, one thing I'm just
still not completely clear about?

1511
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,600
When you handed out the money,
how did that work, exactly?

1512
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:19,840
Badly.

1513
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:27,320
I think what Bob means is, that
ordinarily, what was the procedure?

1514
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,840
Routine. I'd call John Mitchell
over at the Justice Department.

1515
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,480
He'd say, "Go ahead, give out the money."

1516
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,560
This was all done verbally?

1517
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,520
Yes.

1518
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,760
Okay, we know there were five men
who controlled the slush fund.

1519
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:40,960
Mitchell, Stans, and Magruder.

1520
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,880
Yeah, those three we've got. And all three
have been named by two sources.

1521
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,600
What about the other two?

1522
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,960
-Kalmbach.
-We're pretty sure of Kalmbach.

1523
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,960
Maybe we better wait
until we get all five, huh?

1524
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,160
Certain on Mitchell?

1525
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,400
We know that he approved payments
to Liddy while he was Attorney General.

1526
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,160
-You've got more than one source?
-Yes, Harry.

1527
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,280
-Who are they?
-Sloan.

1528
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,400
Sloan and who else?

1529
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,400
There's another guy at Justice
who so far won't confirm...

1530
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,760
the names of the others who
control the fund. We're working on it.

1531
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,800
-What about Deep Throat?
-He's not a source on this.

1532
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,160
-But do any of them have an axe?
-No.

1533
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,960
Personal, political, sexual.

1534
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,560
-Is there anything at all on Mitchell?
-No.

1535
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,000
-Then can we use their names?
-No.

1536
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:16,040
God damn it! When is somebody
gonna go on the record in this story?

1537
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,680
You guys are about to write a story
that says the former Attorney General...

1538
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,440
the highest ranking law enforcement
officer in this country is a crook!

1539
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,560
Just be sure you're right.

1540
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,200
OPERATOR: <i>Essex House, may I help you?</i>
CARL: John Mitchell.

1541
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,000
MITCHELL: <i>Yes?</i>

1542
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,160
Sir, this is Carl Bernstein
of the <i>Washington Post...</i>

1543
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,560
and I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour.

1544
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:54,280
Tomorrow we're running a story
in the paper...

1545
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,760
and we just think that you should
have a chance to comment on it.

1546
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,520
<i>What does it say?</i>

1547
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,520
"John M. Mitchell, while serving...

1548
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:06,600
"as United States Attorney General...

1549
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,040
"personally controlled a secret cash fund...

1550
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,480
"that was used to gather information
about the Democrats...

1551
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,760
-"according to"--
<i>-Jesus.</i>

1552
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,840
"...sources involved
in the Watergate investigation."

1553
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,800
<i>-Jesus.</i>
-"Beginning in the spring of 1971 ...

1554
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,960
"almost a year before he left
the Justice Department...

1555
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,400
"to become President Nixon's
campaign manager...

1556
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:26,560
"on March 1, Mitchell personally
approved withdrawals from the fund."

1557
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,080
<i>All that crap.</i>
<i>You're putting it in the paper?</i>

1558
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,240
-Well--
<i>-It's all been denied.</i>

1559
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,800
<i>You tell your publisher,</i>
<i>tell Katie Graham...</i>

1560
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:37,000
<i>she's going to get her tit caught in</i>
<i>the big ringer if that's published.</i>

1561
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,640
<i>Christ, that's the most</i>
<i>sickening thing I ever heard.</i>

1562
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,920
Sir, I was just wondering
if I could ask you some questions?

1563
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,320
<i>-What time is it?</i>
-It's 11:30, sir.

1564
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,720
<i>11:30? Is it morning or night?</i>

1565
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,680
It's 1 1 :30 at night, sir.

1566
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:55,440
Sir, the Committee to Re-Elect
has issued a statement to our story...

1567
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,120
but there are just a couple of questions--

1568
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,000
<i>Did the Committee tell you</i>
<i>to go ahead and publish the story?</i>

1569
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,520
<i>You fellows have got</i>
<i>a great ballgame going.</i>

1570
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,960
<i>As soon as you're done,</i>
<i>we're going to do a story on all of you.</i>

1571
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,800
Sir, there's just a couple of questions--

1572
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,960
<i>Call my law office in the morning.</i>

1573
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,120
There's no question
you properly identified yourself?

1574
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,320
He said it right off the top.

1575
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,040
Mitchell know
he was talking to a reporter?

1576
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,360
Yeah, but I think I woke him up.

1577
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,760
-Get good notes?
-Verbatim.

1578
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:29,000
He really said that about Mrs. Graham?

1579
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,360
Well, I'd cut the words "her tit"
and print it.

1580
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,480
Why?

1581
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,560
This is a family newspaper.

1582
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,200
You know, once when I was reporting...

1583
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,720
Lyndon Johnson's top guy
gave me the word.

1584
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,280
They were looking for a successor
for J. Edgar Hoover.

1585
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,960
I wrote it and the day it appeared,
Johnson held a press conference...

1586
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,920
and appointed Hoover
head of the FBI for life.

1587
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,040
When he was done,
he turned to his top guy...

1588
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:59,640
and the President said,
"Call Ben Bradlee and tell him, 'Fuck you."'

1589
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:02,440
Then everybody said,
"You did it, Ben. You screwed up.

1590
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,880
"You stuck us with Hoover forever."

1591
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,480
I screwed up, but I wasn't wrong.

1592
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:15,000
How much can you tell me
about Deep Throat?

1593
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,080
How much do you need to know?

1594
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:19,720
Do you trust him?

1595
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:22,360
Yeah.

1596
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:28,920
I can't do the reporting for my reporters
which means I have to trust them.

1597
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,560
And I hate trusting anybody.

1598
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,040
Run that, baby.

1599
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,960
TV ANNOUNCER: <i>The</i> Washington Post
<i>reported that...</i>

1600
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,040
<i>while still in office as Attorney General...</i>

1601
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:28,120
<i>John Mitchell had personally</i>
<i>controlled a secret Republican fund.</i>

1602
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:32,000
<i>Mitchell denied any such involvement</i>
<i>and called the story ludicrous.</i>

1603
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,560
<i>The new charge also brought a response</i>
<i>from Vice President Agnew...</i>

1604
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,960
<i>at his stop in Tampa.</i>

1605
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,720
<i>I have full confidence in Mr. Mitchell...</i>

1606
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,560
<i>and in the people</i>
<i>in the Republican organization.</i>

1607
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:47,400
<i>And I think that that kind</i>
<i>of unattributed report...</i>

1608
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:50,160
<i>at a time like this is counterproductive.</i>

1609
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,920
<i>We must bear in mind</i>
<i>that those who published it...</i>

1610
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,880
<i>have already shown</i>
<i>their sympathy for the other ticket.</i>

1611
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,520
TV ANNOUNCER: <i>A band</i>
<i>and some young cheerleaders....</i>

1612
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,000
All non-denial denials.

1613
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,720
They doubt our ancestry,
but they don't say the story isn't accurate.

1614
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,760
I mean, did you understand
one thing he was saying?

1615
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,920
What I can't figure out is,
what is a real denial?

1616
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,040
Well, if they start calling us goddamn liars,
we better start circling the wagons.

1617
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,920
When do you think they'll start doing that?

1618
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,480
When they get out of Tampa.

1619
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,320
CARL: Joe, come on.
What's going on with you guys at the FBI?

1620
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,960
I've been trying to get to you for weeks.

1621
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,320
Your secretary says you're not in.

1622
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,400
Last night I called,
you said you couldn't talk...

1623
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:28,040
and this morning, as soon as
our Mitchell story hits the stands...

1624
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,400
you call me and say you've got
to see me right away. Why?

1625
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,000
Look, you guys have been causing
big trouble at the Bureau.

1626
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,120
Why?

1627
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,800
Our reports are showing up
in your paper almost verbatim.

1628
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:41,440
I mean, you've really been on the mark,
except for Mitchell.

1629
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,560
Now, we didn't have that...

1630
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,440
-that he controlled the funds.
-Right.

1631
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,360
Our agents have been busting ass...

1632
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,720
but we're gonna go back now
and see if we've missed anything.

1633
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,520
What I don't understand is all the people...

1634
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,600
who might know details
of the bugging operation...

1635
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,240
the FBI hasn't even talked to.

1636
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,720
And why have you conducted your
interviews of CREEP personnel...

1637
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,920
at CREEP headquarters...

1638
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,920
instead of at their homes
where they might feel freer to talk?

1639
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,160
Joe, wait a minute.

1640
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:06,920
Why have the interviews at CREEP
always been conducted...

1641
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,520
within the presence of the lawyer
who works for CREEP?

1642
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,480
Look, you know I can't answer
for the whole Bureau.

1643
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,360
-Oh, come on, I'm just--
-I do what I'm told.

1644
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,680
I followed my orders. Period.

1645
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:25,960
What orders?

1646
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,880
CARL: Wait. Woodward!

1647
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,440
Wait!

1648
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:37,760
Bob!

1649
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,800
Out of the blue. Out of the blue.

1650
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:48,000
Okay, this morning I get a tip
to call a guy by the name of Alex Shipley...

1651
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,480
who is now the Assistant
Attorney General of Tennessee.

1652
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,000
Now, the guy told me, that called me,
that said....

1653
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,680
He said that Shipley was asked
in the summer of 1971 ...

1654
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,080
by an old army buddy, a Donald Segretti...

1655
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,960
to join a group of other lawyers...

1656
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,400
for Nixon's campaign to sabotage
the Democratic candidates.

1657
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,400
Listen, make a left when you can.
We'll go to my place.

1658
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,520
Sabotage Democratic candidates?

1659
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:08,000
That's right. Now, I was able to make
a couple of calls today...

1660
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,880
and I got Segretti's records for the year....

1661
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,800
His travel records for the years 1971-'72.

1662
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,400
Does the FBI know about....

1663
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,680
-Did you say left or right?
-Left!

1664
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,040
We're going to my place.
We gotta go over the records.

1665
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,800
-Does the FBI know about Segretti?
-The FBI interrogated Segretti...

1666
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,480
and found out he wasn't involved
in the break-in so they dropped it.

1667
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:24,600
They didn't follow through on it.

1668
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:25,760
-Where is he?
-He's in California.

1669
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,600
BOB: Jesus, look at this.
CARL: What?

1670
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:32,080
BOB: Segretti crisscrossed the country
at least a dozen times.

1671
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,320
He only stayed in cities
where there were Democratic primaries.

1672
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,680
CARL: If the break-in is just one incident
in a campaign of sabotage...

1673
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,320
that began a whole year
before Watergate....

1674
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,240
BOB: Then for the first time,
the break-in makes sense.

1675
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,480
CARL: This isn't so crazy.

1676
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,800
This thing didn't start
with the bugging at the headquarters.

1677
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,880
Segretti was doing this
a year before the bugging.

1678
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,680
And a year before,
Nixon wasn't slaughtering Muskie.

1679
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,320
He was running behind Muskie,
before Muskie self-destructed.

1680
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,480
If he self-destructed.

1681
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,920
-Hi. Donald Segretti?
-That's right.

1682
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,000
I'm Carl Bernstein
from the <i>Washington Post.</i>

1683
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,560
Hi.

1684
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,080
What can I do for you?

1685
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:11,480
Well, my paper just sent me out here
to try to persuade you to go on the record.

1686
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,760
Why me?

1687
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,880
I guess because you were
the head coordinator...

1688
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,320
of Nixon's sabotage campaign
against the Democrats.

1689
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,440
-Carl, you want some coffee?
-You read my mind.

1690
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,920
Carl, tell me something.

1691
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,280
What do you imagine
the head coordinator does?

1692
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:37,120
Well, I guess basically you're involved
in recruiting other people like yourself...

1693
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,240
other lawyers.

1694
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,880
-Lawyers?
-Like Alex Shipley.

1695
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:45,640
I made it clear that I would not do
anything violent or illegal.

1696
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,000
What do you mean by illegal?

1697
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,000
Watergate, I mean, that's....
The whole bugging. That's horrendous!

1698
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:54,600
And what kind of stuff
do you guys do then?

1699
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,480
Nickel-and-dime stuff.

1700
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,840
Stuff. Stuff with a little wit attached to it.

1701
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,040
You mean, when you sent out
on Muskie's stationery that...

1702
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:06,280
Senator Hubert Humphrey
was going out with call girls?

1703
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:09,320
Listen, if anything,
it helped the man's image.

1704
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,440
What was the one
on Muskie's stationery that you sent out...

1705
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,880
that said that Scoop Jackson
was having a bastard child?

1706
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,520
So, sometimes it got up to a quarter.
Off the record.

1707
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:23,800
I think one of the most interesting ones
was the Canuck letter.

1708
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,160
What about it?

1709
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:30,240
Come on. Where you claimed
that Muskie slurred the Canadians.

1710
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,280
No, I didn't write that.

1711
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,760
Do you know who did?

1712
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,000
Carl, when you guys print it in the papers,
then I'll know.

1713
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:38,680
Smart guy, Donald.

1714
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,920
You're no dummy.

1715
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,440
I'm a lawyer, Carl.

1716
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,400
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer...

1717
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,640
and I'll probably wind up
going to jail and being disbarred...

1718
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,400
and I don't know what I did
that was so goddamn awful.

1719
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:03,800
I'll tell you something.
None of this was my idea.

1720
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,680
I didn't go looking for the job.

1721
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,600
Well, that's important.

1722
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,400
Chapin came to you.

1723
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,000
You know what?

1724
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,920
It's funny, but I keep forgetting that
you guys knew each other in college.

1725
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,520
You were friends at SC, you and Chapin.
Who else was there?

1726
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,400
There was me...

1727
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,280
Dwight...

1728
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,960
Ziegler...

1729
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,640
all the USC mafia.

1730
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,640
And that's when you got involved
in meaningless student elections...

1731
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,640
when you start to try to get your man in
so you stuffed ballot boxes and....

1732
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:43,080
What's that term you guys use
for screwing up the opposition?

1733
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,600
-Rat-fucking.
-That's right.

1734
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,400
You were just doing
the same kind of stuff...

1735
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:50,120
when you were out campaigning
for President Nixon.

1736
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:53,840
Let me tell you something,
we did a lot of worse things in college.

1737
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,080
Look, let me ask you something, Carl.

1738
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,000
What would you have done
if you were just getting out of the army...

1739
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,120
been away from the real world
for four years...

1740
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,360
didn't know what kind of law
you wanted to practice...

1741
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,880
and one day you get a call
from an old friend...

1742
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,760
asking if you want to go to work
for the President of the United States?

1743
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,920
Chapin was the appointment
secretary for Nixon when he called.

1744
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,960
Yeah. Listen,
if those sinister things really happened...

1745
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,800
I don't think Dwight
knew anything about them.

1746
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,360
He just did what he was told.

1747
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,800
Told by who?

1748
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,680
What's the topic for tonight?

1749
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,000
Rat-fucking.

1750
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,080
In my day it was simply known
as the double-cross.

1751
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,880
In our present context...

1752
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,200
it means infiltration of the Democrats.

1753
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,360
Segretti won't go on the record...

1754
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,720
but if he would,
we know he would implicate Chapin.

1755
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:07,040
And that would put you
inside the White House.

1756
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:08,880
Who?

1757
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,480
Be specific.

1758
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,920
How high up?

1759
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,800
You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1760
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,120
I don't like newspapers.

1761
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,800
I don't care for inexactitude...

1762
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:31,240
and shallowness.

1763
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,640
The CREEP slush fund
that financed the rat-fucking...

1764
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,920
we've just about got that nailed down.
I don't know how--

1765
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,680
Did you change cabs?

1766
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,640
Yeah.

1767
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,560
Does the FBI know what we know?

1768
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,000
Does Justice?

1769
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,240
Why haven't they done anything?

1770
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,160
If it didn't deal directly with the break-in,
they didn't pursue.

1771
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,960
Who told them not to?

1772
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,880
Don't you understand what you're on to?

1773
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:19,200
-Mitchell knew?
-Of course Mitchell knew.

1774
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,720
Do you think something this size
just happens?

1775
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,560
Haldeman had to know, too.

1776
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:27,320
You'll get nothing from me
about Haldeman.

1777
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:32,600
Segretti said that--

1778
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,000
Don't concentrate on Segretti.
You'll miss the overall.

1779
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:41,520
The letter that destroyed
the Muskie candidacy...

1780
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,680
the Canuck letter,
did that come from inside the White--

1781
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,480
You're missing the overall.

1782
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:46,920
But what overall?

1783
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,160
They were frightened of Muskie,
and look who got destroyed.

1784
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:53,920
They wanted to run against McGovern.
Look who they're running against.

1785
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,960
They bugged, they followed people...

1786
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,680
false press leaks, fake letters.

1787
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,680
They canceled
Democratic campaign rallies.

They investigated
Democratic private lives.

1789
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:09,280
They planted spies, stole documents,
and on and on.

1790
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,600
Now, don't tell me you think this is
all the work of little Don Segretti.

1791
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,960

-Yeah.

Why don't you pick up
your messages more often?

-Right. You got a cigarette?
-Yeah.

I haven't the slightest idea, Carl.
I have this whole place to take care of.

-Carl?
-Yeah, one second.

Tell him to leave his phone number
next time, all right? Hi, Sally.

1800
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:00,440
Listen, do you guys know
about the Canuck letter?

1801
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:01,640
Yep. I'm sorry, I'm late.

1802
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:04,400
I just wanted to make sure
you knew who wrote it.

What? What!

1804
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:10,080
You mean the letter that sabotaged
the Muskie candidacy?

All right, come here.

01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,800
Gotta tell Bob.

-Woodward.
-What?

1810
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,640
One second. Very important.... Come here.

1811
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,000

Just exactly the way you said it to me,
say it to him.

1814
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,400
Ken Clawson told me
he wrote the Canuck letter.

1815
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,320
The letter that said Muskie
was slurring the Canadians.

1816
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,440
Clawson?

1817
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,400
The Deputy Director of White House
Communications wrote the Canuck letter.

1818
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,520
-When did he tell you this?
-When we were having drinks.

1819
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,400
-Where were you?
-My apartment.

1820
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,480
-When did you say he told you?
-Two weeks ago.

1821
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,000
What else did he say?
He didn't say anything?

1822
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:56,160
Come on, you're hedging.

1823
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:58,800
You think he said it to impress you
to get you to go to bed with him?

1824
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,720
-Jesus.
-No, I want to hear her say it.

1825
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,000
Do you think he said that to impress you,
try to get you to go to bed with him?

1826
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,360
Why did it take you two weeks
to tell us this, Sally?

1827
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:12,240
I guess I don't have the taste
for the jugular you guys have.

1828
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,000
You're claiming
it was all a misunderstanding?

that much wrong before, do you?

<i>What do you mean, where?</i>

1839
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:41,000
I mean, was it a restaurant,
or her apartment, or a bar?

1840
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,040
<i>Now, look.</i>
<i>I'd forgotten the entire incident...</i>

1841

<i>-I don't have time for this. I'm a busy man.</i>

01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:49,800
Did you get all that?

1844
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:51,800
What did he say about
meeting in a bar or restaurant?

1845
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:53,240
He said he forgot the entire incident.

1846
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:55,680
-That means he didn't deny it.
-That's a non-denial denial.

We've only got four out of the five
who controlled the fund.

It has to be Haldeman.

1896

I don't think we've got it.

1897
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,640
We know the fifth
is a top White House official.

1898
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,640
But no one has said it.
No one has named Haldeman.

1899
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:30,400
-No one's denied it.
-That still doesn't prove it was Haldeman.

1902
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,720
you can say it snowed during the night,
although you didn't see it.

1903
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,120
But if we can't prove the fifth man
is Haldeman, we're wiped out.

Everything in that campaign
is done with his approval.

1905

We know that everybody
who works under Haldeman...

does so with his knowledge.

1907

And everybody is under Haldeman,
except the President.

he named Haldeman to the Grand Jury....

-I'm not your source on that.

All we're asking is to confirm it.

I'm not your source on Haldeman.

Okay, look, when you were questioned
by the Grand Jury--

1930
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,040
You had to name names.

1931
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:06,560
-Of course, everything they asked, yes.
-If they asked you. All right if they....

1932
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,760
I don't know.... Say we wrote a story
that said that Haldeman...

1933
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,560
was the fifth name to control the fund.

-Would we be wrong?

01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,200
that the FBI, in its entire inquiry,
never talked to the....

1947
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:54,400
Or did any inquiries into the second
most-powerful man to the President.

1948
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,040
JOE: <i>You don't seem to understand.</i>

1949
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,560
<i>No, you get nothing about Haldeman</i>
<i>out of me.</i>

1950
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,640
But we don't need to know anything, Joe.

1951
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:02,800
Tomorrow we're going
with a story on the FBI.

1952
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:03,920
<i>Now, what does that mean?</i>

1953
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,880
And we're going to establish
in that story...

1954
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:08,240
that you guys just about blew
the whole investigation.

1955
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:10,080
<i>Oh, no, we didn't miss so much.</i>

1956
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:12,080
You didn't know Haldeman
had control of the slush fund?

1957
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:13,840
<i>Oh, yes, we did. It's all in our files.</i>

1958
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:16,160
-Not about Haldeman.
<i>-Yeah, Haldeman. John Haldeman.</i>

1959
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:19,680
<i>Look, now, look, I'm very busy.</i>
<i>I've got to go put the kids to bed.</i>

1960
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,880
That's the confirmation right there.

1961
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,360
Wait a minute, wait a sec.
Did he say John?

1962
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:29,920
-He said Haldeman.
-He said John Haldeman.

1963
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,400
What the hell difference does it make
if he said Isaiah or David?

1964
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,520
There's only one Haldeman.

1965
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:36,960
Yeah, well, Isaiah or David
aren't assistants to the President.

1966
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,240
I don't know, it still feels thin.

1967
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,280
Christ, I just wish we knew
if we could print this.

1968
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,400
Now wait a minute,
we didn't make them do these things...

1969
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:44,880
but once they did, they're fair game!

1970
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:47,160
Harry, let's go over your sources again.
I want to hear it.

1971
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:50,240
Sloan told the Grand Jury.
He answered everything they asked him.

1972
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,160
That means
there's gotta be a record somewhere.

1973
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:55,240
He told the Grand Jury, the FBI confirms.
What more do you need?

1974
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,440
I happen to love this country.

1975
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,600
You know, we're not a bunch of zanies
out to bring it down!

1976
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,320
Harry, weren't you arguing
the opposite way?

1977
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:01,880
No, not at all.

1978
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:03,080
All right, now hold it.

1979
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:05,240
One thing has nothing to do
with the other.

1980
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,760
We're about to accuse Haldeman
who only happens to be...

1981
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,680
the second-most-important man
in this country...

1982
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,440
of conducting a criminal conspiracy
from inside the White House.

1983
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,200
It would be nice if we were right.

1984
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:16,160
-Have you double-checked your sources?
-Jesus.

1985
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:18,920
-Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
-Absolutely!

1986
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,680
-Woodward?
-I'm sure.

1987
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:23,520
I'm not. It still seems thin.

1988
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,080
Get another source.

1989
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:28,160
How many fucking sources
do they think we've got?

1990
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:34,720
-Are you sure Deep Throat won't confirm?
-He won't confirm, I told you that.

1991
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:36,000
What about the guy in Justice?

1992
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:38,000
You can't call him.
He's right next to the Grand Jury.

1993
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,400
-We have no choice. It's trouble.
-It's 20 minutes to deadline.

1994
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,200
I don't even know
if I can get him on the phone.

1995
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,960
OPERATOR: <i>Dr. Kissinger's office.</i>
BOB: Deputy General's office, please.

1996
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,320
Do you know when you expect him back?

1997
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,320
<i>No, sir. I believe he's left for the evening.</i>

1998
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,760
<i>If you'd like to leave a message....</i>
<i>Oh, could you hold, please?</i>

1999
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,120
Hi, this is Carl.
I'm sorry to disturb you now...

2000
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,560
but we're going with the story
that Haldeman was the fifth man...

2001
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,560
in control of the fund
and they're hassling us here.

2002
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:21,200
We've got three confirmations.
If you could help us, I'd appreciate it.

2003
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,960
LAWYER: <i>I won't say anything</i>
<i>about Haldeman. Not ever.</i>

2004
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,560
I understand.
We wouldn't want you to do that.

2005
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,560
We know it's against the law
for you to say anything.

2006
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:29,560
If there's a way you could warn us
to hold on the story, we'd appreciate it.

2007
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:31,520
<i>I'd really like to help you, but I can't.</i>

2008
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:33,960
Look, I'm going to count to 10, all right?

2009
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,000
If there's any reason
we should hold on the story...

2010
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,600
hang up the phone before I get to 10.

2011
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:41,200
If the story's all right, you just be on
the phone after I get to 10, all right?

2012
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,080
<i>-Hang up, right?</i>
-That's right.

2013
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:44,440
-You got it?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

2014
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,200
We're straight. All right,
I'm going to start counting, okay?

2015
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,480
-We all right?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

2016
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,680
Okay, I'm counting.

2017
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,880
One, two...

2018
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,440
three, four, five...

2019
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:58,080
six, seven...

2020
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:03,040
eight, nine, ten.

2021
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:07,520
<i>You got it straight now? Everything okay?</i>

2022
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,800
Everything's fine.

2023
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:14,440
Woodward!

2024
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:20,600
We got it.

2025
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,080
-He confirmed.
-What happened?

2026
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:26,680
I said if I get up to 10
and you don't hang up, it's solid.

2027
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:27,920
-Did he confirm it?
-Absolutely.

2028
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,960
We've got to tell Bradlee!

2029
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:41,760
Bernstein got another source.
The guy at Justice confirmed.

2030
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,600
If there's any doubt,
we can run it tomorrow.

2031
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:45,680
You don't have to. The story's solid.
We're sure of it.

2032
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,640
I just got off the phone with him. It's gold.

2033
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,520
Okay, we go with it.

2034
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:05,440
Woodstein!

2035
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,400
-You know what it's about?
-No.

2036
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:25,120
TV ANNOUNCER: <i>Sloan, who resigned</i>
<i>as campaign treasurer...</i>

2037
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:26,840
<i>after the Watergate break-in...</i>

<i>in the common-cause suit on...</i>

<i>disclosure of campaign contributions,</i>
<i>and denied naming Haldeman.</i>

2040
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:36,080
<i>Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment</i>
<i>on testimony before the Grand Jury?</i>

2041
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:37,840
<i>I'd like my attorney</i>
<i>to answer that question.</i>

2042
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,000
<i>Gentlemen, the answer is</i>
<i>an unequivocal "no."</i>

2043
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:43,280
<i>Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman</i>
<i>in that testimony at all.</i>

2044
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,280
<i>It is in his testimony</i>
<i>that Mr. Sloan acknowledged...</i>

2045
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,200
<i>-that it was an espionage fund?</i>
<i>-No, not at all.</i>

2046
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,280
<i>Did he mention any use of funds</i>
<i>for espionage activity?</i>

2047
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,280
<i>None, whatsoever. Thank you, gentlemen.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

2048
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:54,440
TV ANNOUNCER: <i>He expanded his denial</i>
<i>to include his statements to the FBI...</i>

2049
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:57,480
<i>and to all federal authorities.</i>
<i>A short time later at the White House...</i>

2050
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:00,160
<i>News Secretary Ronald Ziegler</i>

01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:05,320
ZIEGLER: <i>Why is the</i> Post <i>trying to do it?</i>
<i>You have a man...</i>

2053
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:09,600
<i>who is the editor of the</i> Washington Post
<i>by the name of Ben Bradlee.</i>

2054
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:13,040
<i>I think anyone</i>
<i>who would want to honestly assess...</i>

2055
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:16,000
<i>what his political persuasions are, would...</i>

2056
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,520
<i>I think come to the conclusion,</i>
<i>quite quickly...</i>

2057
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:21,320
<i>that he is not a supporter</i>
<i>of President Nixon.</i>

2058
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:22,960
<i>I respect the free press.</i>

2059
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:25,880
<i>I don't respect the type of journalism...</i>

2060
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:30,160
<i>the shabby journalism that is</i>

2061

<i>All I know is that the story</i>

2062
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:36,240

<i>stated as being incorrect...</i>

2064
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:42,280

<i>whose Grand Jury,</i>
<i>secret Grand Jury testimony...</i>

2066

<i>they based their story on.</i>

2067
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:50,800
<i>And that individual has denied</i>
<i>that he ever so testified.</i>

TV ANNOUNCER: <i>No sooner had</i>

2069
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,400
<i>than the President's campaign manager...</i>

<i>and huge, scare headlines...</i>

2075

<i>the</i> Post <i>has maliciously</i>
<i>sought to give the appearance...</i>

<i>of a direct connection between</i>
<i>the White House and the Watergate.</i>

2077
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:13,440
<i>A charge which the</i> Post <i>knows...</i>

<i>The hallmark of the</i> Post <i>campaign</i>
<i>is hypocrisy...</i>

2080

<i>and its celebrated double standard</i>

2081
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,800
I'm not talking to you about
Haldeman or anybody else.

2082
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:29,000
-Then what went wrong?
-Nothing.

2083
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:30,200
Just tell us what went wrong?

2084
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:33,120
Didn't you say that the FBI had
the information on Haldeman in the files?

2085
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:34,600
-No.
-Because we have it in the notes...

2086
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:36,640
from the conversation
we had on the telephone right here.

2087
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,720
We have to go talk to your boss
if you don't talk to us.

2088
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,520
What the hell are you talking about?
I'll deny everything.

2089
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,200
We're not trying
to get anybody into trouble.

2090
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:45,240
We're just trying to find out
if we made some errors.

2091
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:47,240
If we made a mistake,
then we'll come off the story.

2092
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:51,040
Just tell us if we're wrong.
Tell us if we screwed up.

2093
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:52,800
I'm not talking about it.

2094
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,960
I am not talking to you
about Haldeman or anybody else.

2095
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:58,600
In fact, I can't even be seen talking
to either one of you bastards.

2096
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:01,920
-What are you afraid of? Who got to you?
-Are we being set up?

2097
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,640
-Are we, Joe? Tell us!
-Are we being set up?

2098
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:07,120
-Just tell us, we won't print it.
-Fuck you.

2099
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,760
And fuck you!

2100
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:16,400
Honest to God, I just don't know.

2101
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,440
-Oh, I see.
-It's in the notes!

2102
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:22,880
Yeah, we had another call on a long list
and I've got another call, I've gotta go.

2103
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:25,280
-Did you mean Bob Haldeman?
-Yeah, Bob Haldeman.

2104
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,920
Jesus, what was our mistake?

2105
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:32,280
Maybe there was no mistake.

2106
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:36,440
Then they're just setting us up.
Then the whole thing was a set-up?

2107
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:39,640
And they just hung us.

2108
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:43,080
More denunciations.
You'll have to make a statement, Ben.

2109
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:47,000
One senator just gave a speech
slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.

2110
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:50,360
I knew we had enemies,
but I didn't know we were this popular.

2111
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,520
Wow, look at this.

2112
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,600

2114

Okay. Foreign?

2115
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,800
All right, here's our headline.

2116
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:16,280
Radio Hanoi reports the
United States-North Vietnam agreement...

2117
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:18,440
for a settlement of the Vietnam War.

02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,840
You let Haldeman slip away.

2124
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:19,960
Yes.

2125
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,160
You've done worse
than let Haldeman slip away.

2126
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:25,920
You've got people feeling sorry for him.
I didn't think that was possible.

2127
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,800
In a conspiracy like this...

2128
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:31,200
you build from the outer edges
and you go step by step.

2129
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:34,960
If you shoot too high and miss,
everybody feels more secure.

2130
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:38,720
-You put the investigation back months.
-Yes, we know that.

2131

And if we're wrong, we're resigning.

2132
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,320
Were we wrong?

2133
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:48,400
You'll have to find that out, won't you?

2134
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:51,280
Listen, I'm tired
of your chicken-shit games!

2135
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,200
I don't want hints.

2136
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,800
I need to know what you know.

2137
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:14,080
It was a Haldeman operation.

2138
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:19,200
The whole business was run by Haldeman,
the money, everything.

2139
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:23,680
It won't be easy getting at him. He was
insulated. You'll have to find out how.

2140
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:30,400
Mitchell started doing covert stuff
before anyone else.

2141
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:33,280
The list is longer than anyone can imagine.

2142
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:39,200
It involves the entire

2145
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,040
The cover-up
had little to do with Watergate.

2146
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:54,360
It was mainly to protect
the covert operations.

Why the hell didn't you tell me
over the phone?

2153
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,680
-Woodward says phones aren't safe.
-Can't trust them.

2154
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,480
-Come on in.
-We can't come in, sir.

2155
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:40,480
Woodward says
there's electronic surveillance.

2156
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:58,560
-Surveillance? Who's doing it?
-It's being done.

2157
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:00,880
People's lives are in danger.
Maybe even ours.

2158
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,680
What happened to that
Justice source of yours?

2159
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:04,520
I guess I made the instructions
too complicated.

2160
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:06,880
Because he thought I said "hang up"
when I just said "hang on."

-Oh, Jesus!
-The story is right.

2162
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:10,880
Haldeman was the fifth name
to control that fund...

2163
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:13,920
-and Sloan would've told the Grand Jury.
-Sloan wanted to tell the Jury.

2164
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,360
-Why didn't he?
-Because nobody asked.

2165
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:16,840
Nobody asked him.

2166
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:18,680
The cover-up had little to do
with the break-in.

2167
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:21,200
It was to protect covert operations
and the covert activities...

2168
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,560
involving the entire
U.S. intelligence community.

2169

that people's lives are in danger?

Yes.

2171

-What else did he say?
-He said everyone is involved.

of the latest Gallup Poll?

you know, and you put us there.

First Amendment of the Constitution...
