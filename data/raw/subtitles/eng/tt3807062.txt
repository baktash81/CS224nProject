1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,200
Brazil, the largest
country in South America.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,679
Home to the world's greatest rainforest,

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,919
to the biggest river system,

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,920
famous for its sun, sea and samba.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,199
Today, it's one of the world's
fastest growing economies.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,759
But that development has led
to growing inequalities

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,559
in income and wealth.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,159
Despite many protests,

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,439
it is hosting both the World Cup
and, in 2016, the Olympics.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,799
Football is worshipped here,
like a national cult,

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,760
but Brazil has another much older religion.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,199
One that has been here since
its founding by the Portuguese

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,320
almost 500 years ago.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,799
Outside of the United States,
in terms of numbers,

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,519
Brazil is the world's
largest Christian country.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,439
While church attendance in Britain
has been plummeting for decades,

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,399
here in Brazil it's the opposite.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,199
I'm not a Brazilian,

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,479
but I'm fascinated by this
country's mixture of people,

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,119
its religious history,
its passion for music

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,399
and its celebration of life.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,720
And at the heart of that life is
a richly spiritual existence.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,200
So, are you practising
two religions or one?

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,639
Both are only one within the heart.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,439
That's something that you
can smell in religion here,

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,439
the mixture is everywhere.

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,439
I want to explore the incredible
spiritual diversity of Brazil

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,400
by travelling to seven wonders.

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,559
At each, I'll meet people to help me
understand Brazil's complex past,

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,319
what it means to be a part of this
vibrant and exciting country,

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,439
the key ingredients that
contribute to the unique nature

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,840
of Brazilian Christianity.

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,519
There are still a few weeks to go,

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,799
but the streets are already
full as Rio de Janeiro gears up

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,080
for its world-renowned Carnival.

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,079
My name is Robert Beckford.
I am a theologian

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,279
and come from a family with British,
West African and Jamaican ancestors.

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,959
Well, I'm immediately struck
at the incredible diversity

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,679
of the people here,

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,320
a bewildering fusion of race,
ethnicity and culture.

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,079
For years, I have studied
and followed the politics

42
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,439
and developments of countries
that have forged new identities

43
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,680
out of colonialism,
slavery and immigration.

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,639
Brazil was inhabited by numerous
indigenous tribes for centuries,

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,600
but it was the Portuguese who
first opened it up to the West...

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
...by accident.

47
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,079
On the 22nd of April 1500,

48
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,559
a small Portuguese fleet of
just 13 ships and 1,500 men

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,639
were on their way to India,
when by chance they sighted

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,960
the shores of what was later called Brazil.

51
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,759
The first Portuguese who arrived in Brazil

52
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,119
placed a cross on the shore
as a statement of claiming

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,560
this new-found land for
Catholic Christendom.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,959
Two years later, in January, 1502,

55
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,839
a few Portuguese ships exploring
the coast arrived in this bay.

56
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,879
Thinking it was a river delta,

57
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,119
they named it the January
River or Rio de Janeiro.

58
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,680
It's not actually a river delta,
but a large natural harbour.

59
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,319
Dominating it today is our first wonder -

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,320
the statue of Christ the Redeemer.

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,679
It's not just a wonder of Brazil,

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,240
but also now officially one of
the Seven Wonders of the World.

63
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,759
This extraordinary statue
towers above the Rio skyline

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,559
and has become an instantly
recognisable symbol

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,360
of Brazil across the world.

66
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,319
As you arrive at its feet,

67
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,639
you see not only what an
engineering marvel it is,

68
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,679
not only the amazing
view in every direction,

69
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,960
but the grand ambition
of its creators' vision.

70
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,999
When it was originally conceived,

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,919
just after the First World
War, Rio was Brazil's capital.

72
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,839
A group of wealthy Brazilians feared
an advancing tide of godlessness

73
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,119
and they wanted a big statue to help
reclaim Brazil for Christianity -

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,559
a symbol to signify the redemption
of mankind at Jesus' crucifixion

75
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,559
that could be seen all over the city.

76
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,120
So they decided to build
it on the biggest hill.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,719
It's an astonishing achievement

78
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,519
and you only fully appreciate
it when you're up close.

79
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,520
Despite its immense scale, the
subtle details are amazing.

80
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,999
You can actually see the marks
of the nails in his hands

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,879
and his heart is clearly marked out, too.

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,399
It took ten years to build and is 30m tall

83
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,799
and, until very recently,

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,240
was the largest Art Deco
statue in the world.

85
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,559
Under the towering figure,

86
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,840
I have arranged to meet Zeco de Mello.

87
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,639
He was a Catholic priest for 18 years,

88
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,719
becoming one of Brazil's pop-star preachers

89
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,959
before giving it all up to
be a professor of theology

90
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,880
at a local university.

91
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,639
I think that the symbolism
of the Christ the Redeemer

92
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,159
is mainly the protection
that he inspires in us,

93
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,359
and also the hospitality -

94
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,239
he's facing the great bay so
he's welcoming everybody.

95
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,519
What was the vision behind its creation?

96
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,559
Mainly to show how strong
the Catholic faith is,

97
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,879
definitely connected to the
supremacy of the Catholic Church.

98
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,599
Although it's meant to
represent Christ at the moment

99
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,839
of his agonising death,

100
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,199
its real power for me is
its open-armed gesture,

101
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,039
drawing you into Brazil,

102
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,559
a sense that anyone and
everyone is welcome here.

103
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,359
Something that is clearly not
lost on the five million tourists

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,159
who visit this site every year.

105
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,279
On the statue's 75th anniversary in 2006,

106
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,800
a special chapel was built into the base.

107
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,439
Weddings and baptisms can be performed here

108
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,079
and every Sunday there's a
service performed by Padre Omar.

109
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
Anyone can come.

110
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,319
We've come to realise that this space

111
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,759
brings a lot of symbolism.

112
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,559
We saw the need to reopen the chapel,
to become a place of prayer,

113
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,759
of meeting God, to really sense
the great meaning of Christ,

114
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,720
the redeemer of the universe.

115
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,039
Padre Omar is not only a
priest, he's also a singer.

116
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,719
And he wanted to explain to me that music,

117
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,199
especially Brazil's famous
samba, was a key ingredient

118
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,760
in understanding Brazilian Christianity.

119
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,279
I use music as an instrument
of evangelisation,

120
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,560
to make the message of Jesus
Christ accessible to people.

121
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,239
So, this integration
between music, the samba,

122
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,559
the Brazilian culture and the
faith is of great importance

123
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,440
to us and to our
communication with the city.

124
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,560
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Amen.

125
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,559
How do you reconcile bringing
African traditional music, samba,

126
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,039
to Catholicism and bring the two together?

127
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,039
The Bible shows us that
we should praise God

128
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,599
with our body and soul,

129
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,599
we should sing and dance
in the presence of God.

130
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,719
And, in the same way, we do that,

131
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,439
joining the musicality
of Brazil and our faith.

132
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
Like that, we created
this important movement.

133
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,759
Samba is a very African beat.

134
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,439
How it came to Brazil

135
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,159
and was integrated into the culture
is a key part of our story.

136
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,199
A clue to its origins lies
1,000 miles to the north

137
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,519
in the city of Salvador, the
first colonial capital.

138
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,839
In the centre of the city lies

139
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,119
one of Brazil's oldest colonial churches -

140
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,840
our next wonder, the Sao Francisco Church.

141
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,679
This is magnificent.

142
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,479
Just look at the gold everywhere
and the amazing, intricate work.

143
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,120
This is an interior that sets
out to impress, to overwhelm.

144
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,959
Built at the height of Portugal's
colonial empire in the 1700s,

145
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,839
it is a church designed to
show off the wealth and power

146
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,560
of the Catholic establishment and
the ruling elite of that time.

147
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,079
All the surfaces, walls,
columns, vaults, ceilings

148
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,400
are covered with golden
woodwork and paintings.

149
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Brazil at the time was a
major source of gold.

150
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,400
The church is a magnificent example
of the baroque style of the time.

151
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,919
Francisco, what would it have been like

152
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,040
to have worshipped here in the 1800s?

153
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,759
The altar is spectacular.

154
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,280
Francisco, tell me the story
behind the design of this altar.

155
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,440
So gold was definitely plentiful.

156
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,839
But this church hides a darker story.

157
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,919
When the Portuguese came to Brazil

158
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,239
they wanted to exploit this country
for its natural resources.

159
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,719
And for that they needed manpower.

160
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,439
Massive manpower... and cheap.

161
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,119
They decided to import Africans as slaves.

162
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,039
Outside Africa, Brazil had the
highest number of Africans,

163
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,160
all slaves, in the world.

164
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,999
The slaves, when they were first
brought into the country,

165
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,679
the minute they put their
feet on the ground

166
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,479
they had to be baptised.

167
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,679
They had to forget... try
to forget their religions

168
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,440
and become Catholics.

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,919
The slaves stood here.

170
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,479
They were not allowed to go any further.

171
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,240
And as a concession they were given
these two saints to pray to.

172
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,599
One of the worshippers at
the church is Vandete.

173
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,759
Her ancestors were slaves,

174
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,239
brought here from Africa in the 1700s.

175
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,559
She is a follower of a religion
that for over 400 years

176
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,279
has kept alive some of their
original beliefs and traditions.

177
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,999
Today, it's known as Candomble.

178
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,399
Candomble temples are
called casas, or houses,

179
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,280
and Vandete is taking me to one
of the largest in Salvador.

180
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,359
Candomble is a kind of adaptation

181
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,359
of certain aspects of popular Catholicism

182
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,519
to an African belief system

183
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,040
that the slaves maintained
when they came to Brazil.

184
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,239
Brazil was the last country in the world

185
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
to officially abolish slavery.

186
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,559
Until very recently.

187
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,200
Candomble followers could not openly
perform their rituals and practices.

188
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,719
'Candomble became the focus
of police repression.'

189
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,599
Candomble sects were very
often raided by the police.

190
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,519
That was at a period of time

191
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,599
when Brazilian governments wanted Brazil

192
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,839
to become a kind of "European" country.

193
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,799
The head priestess told me
that to avoid prosecution

194
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,599
they even had to conceal
their religious icons

195
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,919
behind statues of Christian saints.

196
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,959
Here's an altar.

197
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,439
But inside here it's hollow, it's empty.

198
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,519
So you'd have here, for
example, St Anthony.

199
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,880
But inside, underneath,
would be an African god.

200
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,119
So the African gods were hidden
behind the Christian saints?

201
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,119
Yes, because of the prohibition.

202
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,439
They said the ceremonies caused fear

203
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,479
because they didn't know the
symbolism of our religion.

204
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,919
They didn't respect it

205
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,719
because those were black people's things,

206
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,319
people of African origin.

207
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,199
Today, nearly two million Brazilians

208
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,679
claim to be followers of this religion.

209
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,359
It translates as "a dance to the gods".

210
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,079
They use the repetitive and
rhythmic music and dance

211
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,079
as a call to the spirits.

212
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,680
At its height, the dancers enter
into a trance-like state.

213
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,359
It should be made very clear

214
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,159
that we understand that religion for us

215
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,279
is an expression of spirituality.

216
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,639
Christianity, Candomble, Spiritism,

217
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,959
these are the same with different names.

218
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,240
But the great, great essence is religiosity.
It's the feeling.

219
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,399
What I've seen here

220
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,039
my ancestors would have practised
in Africa centuries ago

221
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,759
and it's still taking place here in Brazil,

222
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,560
nearly 400 years on!

223
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,639
Worshippers of Candomble
believe that every person

224
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,679
has their own individual Orisha, or god,

225
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,920
who controls their destiny
and acts as a protector.

226
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,560
Vandete invited me to the beach
to offer thanks to hers.

227
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,359
I came to the sea

228
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,599
to thank the mother goddess
for my daughter's health.

229
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,159
She went through a surgery

230
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,719
and I asked for her to come out unharmed,

231
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,679
healthy and strong.

232
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,079
Whenever I have a health problem
or difficulties in the family

233
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,599
I seek her help, who is the
mother of all Orishas.

234
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,159
The extraordinary thing

235
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,759
is that Vandete is also
a practising Catholic

236
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,159
and sees no problem in
combining the two traditions.

237
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,319
My grandmother used to take me to
the church to attend the services

238
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,279
and she'd also bring me to
the sea to offer thanks.

239
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,079
At the same time I went to pray in church,

240
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,159
I'd also come and pray in the sea.

241
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,399
So the sea and the church
are inside my heart.

242
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,399
Here I worship the goddess,
the mother of nature,

243
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,999
and there I pray to Mary,
the mother of Jesus.

244
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,319
- So are you practising two religions or one?
- No.

245
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,160
Both are only one within the heart.

246
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,279
Like Vandete's ancestors,
mine were slaves, too.

247
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,279
They were captured in Africa
and taken to the Caribbean.

248
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,679
And they also brought
their beliefs with them.

249
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,679
And despite the brutal and dark years

250
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,839
of persecution and oppression,

251
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,359
the memory of Africa could
not be completely erased

252
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,119
and lives on in that unique Brazilian
sense of music and rhythm,

253
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,799
that dance to the gods.

254
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,760
And in the samba music that came out of it.

255
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,279
What makes Brazil so unique today
is that despite its brutal past

256
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,319
it has managed to take something

257
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,999
from each of its different communities.

258
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,999
The Portuguese introduced Christianity.

259
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,039
The African slaves brought music and dance.

260
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,759
But there were also hundreds of
indigenous tribes already here.

261
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,679
So I wondered what contribution
they might have made.

262
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,159
For that I needed to
travel even further north,

263
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,760
into the heart of the Amazon
jungle for our next wonder.

264
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,559
Here in the most unlikely of places,

265
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,479
in the city of Manaus,

266
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,959
at the heart of the Amazon rainforest,

267
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,479
stands this grand building.

268
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,359
The Teatro Amazonas

269
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,120
or the Amazon Theatre and Opera House.

270
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,359
The end of the 19th century

271
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,119
was a boom time for the
Amazonian region of Brazil.

272
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,439
It was flush with money from exports
from its large rubber plantations.

273
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,799
Manaus quickly became one
of Brazil's richest cities.

274
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,559
And this opera house was to
be the jewel in the jungle,

275
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,800
a symbol of the triumph of
Christian civilisation.

276
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,799
The rubber barons were making
a lot of money, you know,

277
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,759
in that period - really,
really a lot of money.

278
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,439
They didn't know where to spend it.

279
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,399
The Amazon was really not a place

280
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,199
that people looked at in Brazil, at all.

281
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,839
It meant savagery, really.

282
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,399
It had this very negative
connotation in Brazil.

283
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,599
And these people were making
money and wanted to show,

284
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,520
"No, we are civilised as well."

285
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,679
At the time it was a major
engineering project,

286
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,879
as much of the building material
had to be transported from Europe

287
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,599
and then brought more than 1,000 miles

288
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,320
through the newly cleared rainforest.

289
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,319
Built in the 1890s by the
immensely rich rubber barons,

290
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,199
mostly European immigrants,

291
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,199
it was an attempt to reproduce
the grandeur of a bygone age.

292
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,080
A little bit of European splendour
in the middle of the Amazon.

293
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,519
♪ O Monumento... ♪

294
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,439
The walls, statues and the columns

295
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,479
are made with marble brought from Italy,

296
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,280
as were the chandeliers.

297
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,440
The ceiling tiles came from France.

298
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,639
For a building in the
middle of the rainforest

299
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,039
it's pretty impressive.

300
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,919
♪ Gloria di questa

301
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:50,600
♪ E delle eta future... ♪

302
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,999
In its heyday this was full of the
great and the good of the city.

303
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,920
It was the place to be seen,
to show off your wealth.

304
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,599
The main hall boasts four levels
with seating for 700 people

305
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,079
and a ceiling painted to look like
the underside of the Eiffel Tower.

306
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,719
And when opera was first performed here

307
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,400
it really put Manaus on
the international map.

308
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,599
But within 20 years of being built

309
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,159
artificial rubber was invented

310
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,959
and Brazil's rubber boom
evaporated almost overnight.

311
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,359
The wealthy barons moved on and
the opera house closed down.

312
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,360
For nearly 90 years there
were no performances.

313
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,039
15 years ago, the then Brazilian government

314
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,479
revived the building and
restored it to its former glory.

315
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,800
Today it's used for music shows,
dramas and even choral singing.

316
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,199
The opera house is now also used

317
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,879
to promote Brazil's indigenous cultures.

318
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,079
Fidalis is an indigenous Indian

319
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,040
and has also become a
famous Brazilian actor.

320
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,399
What does this venue mean to you?

321
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,319
Nowadays there's a tendency

322
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,279
to pay more attention to our local culture.

323
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,199
And that has brought more
indigenous people in here

324
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,479
and they feel this is theirs.

325
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,039
Although our ancestors laboured here,

326
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,919
today we feel the Amazon
Theatre is also ours

327
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,720
and has become a part of
the life of the people.

328
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,799
This place was built by Europeans

329
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,119
to explore their culture
and their religion.

330
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,959
What's your religious tradition?

331
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,359
I live between two worlds

332
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,919
that I understand as religion today.

333
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,919
I mean, the world that I
live here, the churches,

334
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,399
the choirs in the churches,

335
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,479
and the world of my own
childhood, where I was born,

336
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,040
which is the world of
my ancestral religion.

337
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,039
So it's basically that.
One foot in the city

338
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,720
and another foot in the tribe.

339
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,079
One day I am inside a church
watching a choir with the priests

340
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,159
and the next day with the shaman.

341
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,320
I mean, these two worlds are
what makes us Indians today.

342
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,999
It's this mix and merging of faiths

343
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,359
and very different cultural
traditions that make.

344
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,440
Brazilian Christianity one of the
most diverse in the Americas.

345
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,399
The early Portuguese missionaries
used Manaus as a starting point

346
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,519
in their attempts to convert the
many indigenous Indian tribes

347
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,040
living in the rainforest.

348
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,679
It was the Jesuit priests who
managed to stop the many massacres

349
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,200
that took place as the early
settlers opened up the forest.

350
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,719
Fidales wanted to take me
to see his home village

351
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,160
in the rainforest outside Manaus.

352
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,679
There are still more
than 800,000 Brazilians

353
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,479
who identify themselves as Indians,

354
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,239
divided into 200 different tribes,
many with distinct languages.

355
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,040
Most live along the rivers
of the Amazon rainforest.

356
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,959
Many practice a mixture of Catholicism

357
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,120
and their own ancient traditions.

358
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,840
Can you show me around? I am
looking forward to seeing more.

359
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,000
What are your spiritual beliefs?

360
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,799
Well, we Indians, we have
our natural beliefs,

361
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,719
which is that we have our
God of the universe,

362
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,399
who is the grandfather of the
universe, the God of the world.

363
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:47,079
So, it's the only god we believe to
be God, but we also believe that,

364
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,359
when we live in this world,
we came from another,

365
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,639
the first indigenous world.

366
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,199
We transformed ourselves into this
material world, and we will die here.

367
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,839
We believe we then go back
to the mythological world

368
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,199
from which we can transform ourselves
again into another species.

369
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,720
You can be an animal, or you can
be a woman in a different time.

370
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,559
So, that's what we believe.

371
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,639
But we believe in God.
We are also Catholics.

372
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,199
And so we believe that God exists,

373
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,640
but within our Indian mythology,
that is what we believe.

374
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,519
Indian beliefs in the souls
and investing nature

375
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,679
with symbolic importance

376
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,079
also mixes with Portuguese Catholicism

377
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,839
in those areas where there were
a large numbers of Indians

378
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,960
being bought into Portuguese
colonial society.

379
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,319
We talk and believe about

380
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,919
the souls in the purgatory in Catholicism

381
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,999
and so do the Indians.

382
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,919
And this connection between
the Indians and the souls

383
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,040
passed on to the Brazilian
Catholic tradition.

384
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,719
On Monday you go and light
candles to the souls.

385
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,440
All this comes from the
Brazilian indigenous world.

386
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,479
It's amazing to see two
such separate and different

387
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,119
belief systems work side by side.

388
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,679
The Indian chief had no difficulty
in equating his belief in

389
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,399
the everlasting nature of spirits

390
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,559
with Christianity's belief in the soul.

391
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,239
For me, it's this fusion
of religious beliefs,

392
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,519
this willingness to mix
the best of both worlds,

393
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,999
holding on to the integrity
of the Indian past

394
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,039
without denying the importance
of Christian belief,

395
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,440
that is another key ingredient in
Brazil's own brand of Christianity.

396
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,999
Catholicism in Brazil was strengthened in

397
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,199
the early 20th century with
another large-scale immigration

398
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,399
of people from Europe - mostly
working-class Germans and Italians.

399
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,319
And again, like the first
Portuguese and the African slaves,

400
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,879
they brought their beliefs and
traditions with them too -

401
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,879
a desire to recreate a little
bit of the old country

402
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,119
in their new Brazilian home.

403
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,519
Our next wonder of Brazil -

404
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,720
the Metropolitan Cathedral in Sao Paulo.

405
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,399
It is this building that to me

406
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,320
symbolises the magnificence
of Catholicism in Brazil.

407
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,839
It's the largest cathedral
in South America,

408
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,279
but its history highlights the fact
that by the early 20th century.

409
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,200
Catholicism in Brazil was
facing a crisis of identity.

410
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,599
At a time of massive social, political

411
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,559
and industrial change in Brazil,
this building was an attempt to

412
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,760
re-assert the power and magnificence
of the traditional Catholic Church.

413
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,679
This neo-Gothic cathedral
could be in almost any large

414
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,839
industrial city in Europe.

415
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,039
It was designed by German
and Italian architects.

416
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,919
Its dome is a copy of the one
in Florence and its marble

417
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,359
and organ were imported from Italy too.

418
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,599
So it seems there is a bit of a
sense of a crisis of identity

419
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,720
going on here. Is it really
Brazilian or European?

420
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,239
It was a choice. It was a choice
perhaps slightly misplaced

421
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,759
in time because this cathedral
was built in the 20th century.

422
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,239
It was decided that the
church would be monumental,

423
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,079
large, in a beautiful style
that would also say something

424
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,039
about the architectural tradition
of the church, of the history

425
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,760
of the church, and that is why a
neo-Gothic church was built here.

426
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,519
To be Brazilian is to
always try to be European.

427
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,559
It is part of the Brazilian dilemma.
To be civilised is to be European.

428
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,240
You just have to choose which part
of Europe you want to emulate.

429
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,599
The Sao Paulo Cathedral Choir is
one of Brazil's most well known.

430
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,199
And they still sing in Latin -

431
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,280
the language of the old
European Christian tradition.

432
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,839
Ronaldo Santurbano is the choirmaster.

433
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,479
That sounded really amazing. Can you
tell me, what were you practising?

434
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,399
Today we are here getting
ready for the Mass

435
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,479
that is going to be celebrated.
We have weekly rehearsals.

436
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,920
Everyone here is a volunteer -
they're the soul of our choir.

437
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,159
He is also the man in charge of

438
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,600
an elaborate bell-ringing
system in the cathedral.

439
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,359
I noticed in the practice
you were singing in Latin.

440
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,319
I just wondered, do you
always perform in Latin?

441
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,759
Or do you sometimes sing in Portuguese?

442
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,999
We are inside a cathedral
where we can't forget that

443
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,599
music in our own language
is very new for our church.

444
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,359
It's only 50 years since
the Second Vatican Council

445
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,519
allowed us to have music in Portuguese.

446
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,119
We can't forget the tradition
of the sacred music in Latin,

447
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,000
the Gregorian chant, the great
sacred music from the past.

448
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,839
For centuries the Catholic
Church had a complete monopoly

449
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,919
of power over Brazil's religious life,

450
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,999
but in the mid-19th century many
of the restrictions were lifted

451
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,799
and a new wave of Christian missionaries

452
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,679
started to arrive from abroad.
Many came from the United States,

453
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,600
and one group built their first
church here in Rio de Janeiro.

454
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,360
Our next wonder - the Igreja
Presbyterian Cathedral.

455
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,039
After the Roman Catholics,
the Protestant Church is

456
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,999
the largest Christian
denomination in Brazil.

457
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,199
But it was not always like this.

458
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,199
For hundreds of years during
the Portuguese colonial rule,

459
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,439
Protestant Churches were
severely persecuted.

460
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,959
Today they are the fastest growing
of all the Christian churches,

461
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,039
with nearly one-in-five of
Brazilians now claiming to

462
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,360
belong to some form of Protestantism.

463
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,479
Gone is all the gold and the silver
and other Baroque ornamentation

464
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,679
that we have seen in so many
of the Catholic churches.

465
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,799
The Protestant Reformation was
brought about by a desire

466
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,039
for a simpler, purer form of worship -

467
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,079
a rejection of the pomp and
pageantry of the Catholic Church.

468
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,239
And you can really see it here.

469
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,199
You know, this, one of the oldest
Protestant churches in Brazil,

470
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,559
is so different in its
simplicity and style,

471
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,120
in contrast to the Catholic churches here.

472
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,319
But what was so radical about this
cathedral was not what was in it

473
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,119
or how it was decorated,
but its very existence

474
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,839
as a public place of worship.
As until then,

475
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,160
only Catholics had been
allowed to build churches.

476
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,479
The official religion was Roman Catholic

477
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,439
and all the other religions, Jews
included, were not permitted

478
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,359
to build buildings in church style.
Only as a house.

479
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,719
When the Republic was
proclaimed in Brazil, of course

480
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,399
there was a separation
between State and Church,

481
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,959
and then we could build
a building as a church.

482
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,359
Is the Presbyterian tradition
in Brazil growing?

483
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,519
Our denomination, that has
over 4,000 churches in Brazil,

484
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,880
we were organising one new church per week.

485
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,439
Today Protestantism in Brazil
is divided into hundreds

486
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,679
of different denominations.

487
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,039
One of the most popular
are the Pentecostals,

488
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,240
and they are building hundreds of
new churches all over the country.

489
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,999
Pentecostalism is an
extraordinary phenomenon,

490
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,239
across the world, in terms
of how fast it is growing.

491
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,720
I have first-hand experience of this.
I was raised a Pentecostal.

492
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,759
The Pentecostals dispense with
many of the more traditional

493
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,559
forms of worship and emphasise a
more direct relationship with God.

494
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,639
They are now the fastest growing
denomination in the country,

495
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,839
doubling their numbers to
nearly 50 million believers

496
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,239
in the last 30 years.

497
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,919
Pastor Samuel Ferreira is
one of Brazil's most famous.

498
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,680
Pentecostal preachers
and leads this church.

499
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,559
What's the attraction of
Brazilian Pentecostalism?

500
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,719
The Pentecostal world, the
Pentecostal doctrine,

501
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,719
and the Pentecostal Church brought
God much closer, they made God real.

502
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,959
Nowadays you go to a Pentecostal
church because you want to feel God.

503
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,079
You want to worship God.

504
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,559
That's why you see people crying,
people raising their hands,

505
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,520
people of all ages.

506
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,319
For me, the passion and the
energy that I have just seen here

507
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,719
makes Pentecostalism unique,

508
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,639
as it manages to mix traditional
elements of Christian worship

509
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,079
with chanting and dancing and
trance-like euphoric outpourings,

510
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,679
drawing on Brazil's other
religious traditions.

511
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,719
Brazilians have taken an American import

512
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:41,120
and given it a distinctive
Brazilian identity.

513
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,599
I think Pentecostalism is doing well
in Brazil for different reasons.

514
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,959
Mainly I think the sense
of community is I think

515
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,879
something very important, they
work a lot in the poor areas

516
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,239
so they give them a sense of
belonging to a community.

517
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,159
Also the propaganda, the way they
work, they work very professionally.

518
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,799
So they have the targets to achieve.

519
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,959
And another thing, I think
that we love parties,

520
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,479
we love the festivals.

521
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,039
So the Pentecostal Church
and charismatic movements

522
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,479
is all about being happy,
singing a lot, clapping hands.

523
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,840
And we are very good at that. I
think that's a big part of it.

524
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,239
This is definitely not the sedate,
hallowed Christianity of the state,

525
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,320
it's the noisy, passionate
Christianity of the people.

526
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,639
And its growing popularity is a major worry

527
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,280
for the leaders of Brazil's Catholics.

528
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,279
It is a cultural phenomenon,

529
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,119
which takes place at a time
of very big cultural changes,

530
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,319
where people feel self-governing

531
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,519
and want to be self-governing
in their choices.

532
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,920
I certainly look at this
situation with some worry.

533
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,600
For centuries, Brazil struggled
with its own identity.

534
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,120
And this has been reflected in its
relationship with Christianity.

535
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,400
Was it a European, or an African,
or a South American nation?

536
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,440
How could it fuse all the
elements into a cohesive whole?

537
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,359
When it was decided that the capital
should be moved from Rio to

538
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,079
a more central location, a
unique opportunity arose to help

539
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:28,600
create a new identity for Brazil by
building a completely modern city.

540
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,399
There is Brazil and then there is Brasilia,

541
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,800
a city unlike any other in this country.

542
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,119
It was built to show the
ambition and aspiration

543
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,600
that this country could aim for.

544
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,919
The city was built in the 1950s
as a showpiece of the very latest

545
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,320
in building design and urban planning.

546
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,719
It has now been designated a
UNESCO World Heritage site

547
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,239
because of its modern architecture.

548
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,439
And at its heart is a
completely new cathedral...

549
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,959
Our next wonder of Brazil -

550
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,240
the Metropolitan Cathedral
of Our Lady Aparecida.

551
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,799
These four figures.
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John

552
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,519
mark the continuity of
a religious tradition,

553
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,359
but the building and the landscape don't.

554
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,720
The style suggests to me
that religion has moved on.

555
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,959
The cathedral was designed by one
of Brazil's - and the world's -

556
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,239
most famous architects, Oscar Niemeyer.

557
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,759
Stylistically it marks a complete
break with Brazil's colonial.

558
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,680
Portuguese, African and
indigenous Indian past.

559
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,479
Gone are any references to European
neo-Gothic and Baroque cathedrals.

560
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,079
Instead, it is a uniquely
South American building -

561
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,600
a symbol of a new Brazil.

562
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,199
On this journey, I have seen
some wonderful buildings,

563
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,439
places of worship, sights that
reflect the history of this country,

564
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,999
but this is so different,

565
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,560
this is of the Brazil of the
present and of the future.

566
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,519
What makes this building
distinctively Brazilian?

567
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,239
The free way and the inclusive way
in which it welcomes the visitor

568
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,119
and makes him feel part
of the universe in a way

569
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:03,439
that he connects himself directly to
the skies, to the natural elements.

570
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,359
So in some respects it was a symbol
of equality and inclusion by making

571
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,679
it circular and making the focus the
heavens rather than the priest.

572
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,399
The whole point was to bring a
sense of secularity to the place

573
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,920
through the direct contact of the
person who gets in with the heavens.

574
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,559
Here in this cathedral, the style
is more informal, more popular,

575
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,800
more focused towards a new
generation of believers.

576
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,559
In this space, with the light pouring in,

577
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,759
the colours, the angels up there,

578
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,279
I think this is what Catholicism
here is hoping for -

579
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,799
inclusion, progress, modernity -

580
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,280
but will it be able to hold on to
its historically dominant role?

581
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,999
Modern architecture always
points to the future.

582
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,319
It always has a desire for change in it.

583
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,519
It always empowers the person so
he can feel himself able to be

584
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,920
an agent of change.

585
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,199
And then in this way

586
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,920
it points to the future,
to a better future I hope.

587
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,439
I am back in Rio, where
last-minute preparations are now

588
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,000
under way for our final wonder.

589
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,919
This wonder is not an architectural marvel

590
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,719
but a celebration of what
it means to be a Brazilian.

591
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,599
For me, it combines all the ingredients

592
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,439
we have encountered in Brazil's
evolving relationship with.

593
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,280
Christianity - dance,
music, worship and passion.

594
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,439
Here at the office of the
mayor, they are celebrating

595
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,760
the inauguration of a new
symbolic leader of the city.

596
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,439
Every year, a figure known as King Momo

597
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,599
is selected from a number of hopefuls.

598
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:49,919
Traditionally a tall, fat man, a
figure of mockery, satire and fun.

599
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,879
He has been chosen to lead our final
wonder of Brazil - the Carnival.

600
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,679
The handing over of the keys to
King Momo symbolises his reign

601
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,080
over the city, the beginnings
of the festivities.

602
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,279
For the days of the Carnival,
he will - in theory - represent

603
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,759
the people of the streets, the
poor and the marginalised,

604
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,160
as they take over the city.

605
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,159
It's subversive. It's
very subversive somehow.

606
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,760
It's the one day that even the poor
people are going to be like kings.

607
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,799
We always want to celebrate, and
this kind of cathartic movement...

608
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,999
And it's very religious because of that.

609
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,279
The origin of Carnival, the
name "carne levare" is like to

610
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,199
say "goodbye to the meat" because
you are going to start Lent.

611
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,079
It's ancient and it's very
religious because of that,

612
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,480
so it's also very Christian.

613
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,239
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi, Robert. Pleased to meet you.

614
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,879
Nice to meet you.

615
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,319
What is the history of Carnival?

616
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,799
The origin of Carnival is religious.

617
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,799
It started as a response
to the period of Lent,

618
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,559
and it became well established
in the Middle Ages.

619
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,319
Lent is a time of denial and deprivation,

620
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,679
and so before this period begins

621
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,919
many people go into a frenzy of
festivities, parties, celebrations,

622
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,479
all this before the start of
Lent, which is on Ash Wednesday.

623
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:46,839
Carnival in itself is a religion,
particularly in Brazil.

624
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,439
It's a declaration of love that
the people have to Carnival,

625
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,999
which is almost a dedication.

626
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,399
The samba schools are like
sanctuaries, where you go

627
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:03,560
praise your gods, the gods of samba,
of Carnival, this kind of thing.

628
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,919
Every part of the city is
involved in the festivities.

629
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,159
Neighbourhoods organise street parties

630
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,279
and processions that often
have special themes.

631
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,560
This one pays homage to
ancient Egyptian gods.

632
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,279
I have come to one of the
largest samba schools. Estacio

633
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,239
as it makes its final preparations.

634
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,039
In a few days' time, it will compete
with its rivals from around

635
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,839
the city, with everyone hoping to be
judged the best samba parade in Rio.

636
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,079
Chuvisco is the chief percussionist,

637
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,719
and it's his job to work out the
moves and keep the music in synch.

638
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,239
Luana will lead the group,
hoping to be crowned.

639
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,320
Samba Queen at the end of the carnival.

640
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,839
At the heart of every Carnival
procession is of course that

641
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:34,840
unique Brazilian blend of
samba, music, and dance.

642
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,679
What does samba mean to Carnival?

643
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,519
Well, samba is like the
Brazilian soul of Carnival.

644
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,719
Carnival is not a Brazilian
celebration, it's European,

645
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,639
which was born in Middle Age Europe.

646
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,879
But here in Brazil and in Rio de Janeiro,

647
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,359
it has acquired this Brazilian soul.

648
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,640
Samba is what defines
Brazil during the Carnival.

649
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,479
You may find this hard to
believe, but this just a warm-up

650
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,639
to the grand finale that
takes place this evening.

651
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,319
During the course of the day,
over a million people will

652
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,080
parade along this street. It's incredible.

653
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,639
Originally, all the final parades
were held in the city centre.

654
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,279
But today they have a
purpose-build samba stadium

655
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,519
and everyone in the city
is now heading there.

656
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,639
The competition is fierce and every
samba school's parade will be

657
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,840
judged on aspects of their themes,
music, costumes and dance.

658
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,760
Despite the fun, it's serious
stuff for the competitors.

659
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,880
How are you feeling?

660
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:36,759
A bit tense about going into the
stadium, but that's normal.

661
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,439
Now, we must try and keep cool

662
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,079
so we can guide this
wonderful percussion band.

663
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,959
But I'm sure that we're going
to do a great performance.

664
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,639
Most people coming to the Carnival
or watching on television

665
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,879
just want to enjoy the world's
biggest street party,

666
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,319
but if you look you can see each of
the ingredients from our wonders

667
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,840
and how they combine to make
Brazilian Christianity so unique.

668
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,919
I think that religion is
very present in Carnival.

669
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,359
There is this kind of euphoria,
this kind of proclaiming that life

670
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,239
can be different somehow, even
for just four or five days.

671
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,359
That's a very religious
and powerful movement,

672
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,079
something that changes you,

673
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,279
you can feel the energy,
it's something transcendent.

674
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,879
Good to see you again. How do you feel?

675
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,199
It's a lot of emotion, my heart is racing.

676
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,639
We're very confident.

677
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,079
We've rehearsed a lot, our school
is coming to fight for the title

678
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,959
and we're sure to be champions.

679
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,279
All the best. Good luck.

680
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,759
Brazilians have taken all
the diversity, the mixture,

681
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,719
the amazing fusion of cultures that
makes this country so different

682
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,959
and used them to transform the Carnival

683
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,759
into a uniquely South American event.

684
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,239
Carnival today has become an
expression of Brazilian culture

685
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,360
and identity and it has
taken on a life of its own.

686
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,599
In the street parades and processions,

687
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,479
you can see the welcoming
of Christ the Redeemer

688
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,400
as he overlooks the city.

689
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,479
In the wild and colourful costumes,

690
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,679
you can see the glitz of
the decorations that adorn

691
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,160
the old Catholic churches,
like the one in Salvador.

692
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,479
With the incredible beat
and rhythm of the samba,

693
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,399
you can see the dance to the gods

694
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,880
that the African slaves brought with them.

695
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,479
And finally, with that desire
to create something unique,

696
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,519
to have the biggest, noisiest,
rowdiest street party

697
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,359
in the whole world, you can
also see the true Brazil

698
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,120
in this, our final and
most extraordinary wonder.
