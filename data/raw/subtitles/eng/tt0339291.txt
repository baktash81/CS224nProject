1
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,738
Bum buttery, flit fluttery
Dum diddly-ooh

2
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,242
Bum buttery, bluebird
Is singing a tune

3
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,787
Daffy-down-dillies awaken
And prune

4
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,874
Bursting in bloom
All the flowers assume

5
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,128
It's a loverly, loverly spring

6
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,972
Chit-chattery chipmunks
All singing along

7
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,267
Humming their
Join-in-a-spring-along song

8
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,270
Spring is the springiest time
For a song

9
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,773
It's a loverly, loverly spring

10
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:51,153
In the forest we play
With the rabbits all day--

11
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:55,407
I'm sorry to say that this is not
the movie you will be watching.

12
00:01:55,866 --> 00:02:00,245
The movie you are about to see
is extremely unpleasant.

13
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,998
If you wish to see a film
about a happy little elf,

14
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,502
I'm sure there is still plenty
of seating in theater number two.

15
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,379
However, if you like stories
about clever

16
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,840
and reasonably attractive orphans,

17
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,511
suspicious fires,
carnivorous leeches,

18
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,722
Italian food
and secret organizations,

19
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,474
then stay

20
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,851
as I retrace each and every one

21
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,063
of the Baudelaire children's
woeful steps.

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,733
My name is Lemony Snicket,

23
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:33,153
and it is my sad duty
to document this tale.

24
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,448
Violet Baudelaire, the eldest,

25
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,661
was one of the finest 14-year-old
inventors in the world.

26
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,872
Anyone who knew Violet well could
tell she was inventing something

27
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,084
when her long hair was tied up
in a ribbon.

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,755
In a world of abandoned items
and discarded materials,

29
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,008
Violet knew there
was always something.

30
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,553
Something she could fashion
into nearly any device

31
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,180
for nearly every occasion.

32
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,101
And no one was better
to test her inventions

33
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,061
than her brother.

34
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:12,317
Klaus Baudelaire, the middle child,
loved books.

35
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,237
Or, rather, the things he learned
from books.

36
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,032
The Baudelaire parents had
an enormous library in their mansion.

37
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,662
A room filled with thousands
of books on nearly every subject.

38
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,747
And nothing pleased Klaus more

39
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:30,669
than spending an afternoon filling up
his head with their contents.

40
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,589
And everything he read
he remembered.

41
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,267
Sunny, the youngest,
had a different interest.

42
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,479
She liked to bite things
and had four sharp teeth.

43
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,775
There was very little that Sunny
did not enjoy biting.

44
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,246
Sunny was at an age when one
mostly speaks

45
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,999
in a series of unintelligible shrieks.

46
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,709
For instance:

47
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,544
Which probably meant,

48
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,507
''Look at that mysterious figure
emerging from the fog. ''

49
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,842
Or perhaps,

50
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,220
''What is a banker like Mr. Poe doing

51
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,349
trudging thorough the sand
to find us at Briny Beach?''

52
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,646
Children,

53
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:35,734
I'm afraid I must inform you
of an extremely unfortunate event.

54
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,322
I'm very, very sorry to tell you this,
but your parents have perished in a fire

55
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,533
that's destroyed your entire home.

56
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,245
If you have ever lost someone
very important to you,

57
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,747
then you already know how it feels.

58
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,290
And if you haven't,

59
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,960
you cannot possibly imagine it.

60
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,722
No one knows the precise cause
of the Baudelaire fire.

61
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,642
My colleagues and I
have investigated the best we can.

62
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,602
But all we've discovered
is that the blaze

63
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,896
was started from a great distance

64
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,024
through the refraction
and convergence of light.

65
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:20,529
And within moments,
the entire mansion was in flames.

66
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,643
And as mysterious as the source
of the blaze,

67
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,772
other mysteries began to unfold
before the children's eyes.

68
00:05:56,273 --> 00:06:00,319
Every family has its secrets,
doors left unopened.

69
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,529
But as Klaus now realized,

70
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:06,783
the smallest discovery would send
his mind reeling with questions.

71
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,287
What was this spyglass hidden
in his father's desk?

72
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:14,499
Were there other secrets about their
parents' lives yet to be revealed?

73
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,586
Questions he now feared
might never be answered.

74
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,422
And just like that,

75
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,801
the Baudelaire children
became the Baudelaire orphans.

76
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,347
I tried to warn you.

77
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,817
This is an excellent opportunity
to walk out of the theater,

78
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,446
Iiving room or airplane
where this film is being shown.

79
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,159
It's not too late to see a film
about a happy little elf.

80
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,163
Yes. Come with me.

81
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,544
Now, as chief officer
of Mulctuary Management

82
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,462
and the executor of
your parents' estate,

83
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,132
it is my legal obligation to take care
of your money till you come of age

84
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,344
and to place you in the care
of your closest relative.

85
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,305
So I'm taking you to live
with your dear Count Olaf,

86
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,892
who resides right here in the city,
just 37 blocks away.

87
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,687
I don't think that's what ''closest''
is supposed to mean.

88
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,522
We don't know a Count Olaf.

89
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,023
Yes, yes, of course you do.

90
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,984
He's either your third cousin
four times removed

91
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,735
or your fourth cousin
three times removed.

92
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,991
And he's an actor by trade.
Isn't that exciting, children?

93
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,412
You should count yourselves
lucky, children.

94
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,999
This sort of generosity is rare
in a person of his profession.

95
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,256
Here we are, your new home.

96
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,217
Isn't it lovely, children?

97
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,554
Oh, hello.

98
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,973
You must be the Baudelaires.

99
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,433
Hi.

100
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,727
I was so sorry to hear
about the accident,

101
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,229
but so happy to hear
you were coming here.

102
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,690
Welcome. I'm Justice Strauss
of the city high court.

103
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,527
I'm Violet. And this is my brother,
Klaus, and my sister, Sunny.

104
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,863
Poe, Mulctuary Management.
How do you do?

105
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,072
Lovely.

106
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,408
Your house is so beautiful.

107
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,701
Thank you.

108
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,996
Please don't be strangers.
You come visit me anytime you like.

109
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,124
- Visit?
- You mean,

110
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,626
you don't live with Count Olaf?

111
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,629
Live with--? With Count Olaf? No.

112
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:27,633
No, no, no, no. He's--
He's my neighbor.

113
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,184
Entrood.

114
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,612
Haven't got all day. In you go.

115
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:39,705
Well, hello, hello, hello.

116
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:44,126
I am your beloved Count Olaf.

117
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:49,840
And welcome to my loverly home.

118
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:54,803
May you find solace within
the womblike warmth of its. . .

119
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,140
. . .downy plume.

120
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:02,936
Or as the Greeks
in the ancient times would say:

121
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,813
Orphanis. . .

122
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,149
. . .encribo. . .

123
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,984
. . .something, something, something.

124
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:14,823
Music builds to a crescendo
Ending on the right foot

125
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,867
And strike a Fosse.

126
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:23,290
Not exactly what I was going for,
but you get the idea.

127
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,469
My dear. . .

128
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,681
. . .Violet.

129
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,850
Enchanté.

130
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,022
How do you do?

131
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,192
And this must be Klaus.

132
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,487
Young Klaus.

133
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,907
Your left side is the good one.

134
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,619
And. . .

135
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,830
. . .what is this?

136
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,837
I'm sorry, I don't speak monkey.

137
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,421
Banana.

138
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,217
Sunny's our sister.

139
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:20,347
I must say, you're a gloomy-looking
bunch. Why so glum?

140
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,350
Our parents just died.

141
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,354
Oh, yes, of course.
How very, very awful.

142
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,065
Wait, let me do that one more time.

143
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,360
Give me the line again.
Quickly, while it's fresh in my mind.

144
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,988
Our parents just. . .

145
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,406
. . .died?

146
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,076
Oh, yes.

147
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,081
Mr. Poe. . .

148
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,502
. . .I will raise these orphans

149
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,214
as if they were actually wanted.

150
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:58,010
And though you would call it
a burden, a sacrifice,

151
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,220
you are mistaken, sir.

152
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,306
And should be ashamed of yourself.

153
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,016
The idea.

154
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,231
Anyway, where do I sign
for the fortu--? I mean. . .

155
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,025
. . .children.

156
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:18,572
You won't officially have guardianship
until the hearing on Thursday morning.

157
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,658
And what am I to do with them
until then?

158
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,035
Excuse me?

159
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,037
What I mean is. . .

160
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,665
Do you work out? You look good.
Healthy, I mean.

161
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,294
Well, I'd better get back to the bank.

162
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,672
Can't you stay for a brief imbibement?

163
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,383
A glass of port? Sanka?

164
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,511
- Well, I suppose I could--
- Another time, then.

165
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,471
Children, if you need anything,
do feel free--

166
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,264
Oh, no, we're fine. We're all fine.

167
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,891
Any questions be--

168
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,065
I realize that my humble abode

169
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,610
isn't as fancy
as the Baudelaire mansion,

170
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,072
but I'm coming into a great deal
of money soon,

171
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,115
and I think it'll be

172
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,202
quite charming when it's finished.

173
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,123
Shall we take a look?

174
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,211
This is the living room.

175
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,631
The kitchen.
I know what you're thinking:

176
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,217
''This place could use a little TLC.''

177
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,930
I trust you've had your tetanus shots.
Polio. Smallpox. Typhoid. Malaria.

178
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,349
This is the entertainment
or rumpus room.

179
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,060
I'm told the ceiling can be brought
up to code in no time.

180
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,271
You're not afraid of heights, are you?

181
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,941
Imagine that.
A monkey afraid of heights.

182
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,027
My theater.

183
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,946
This way.

184
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,700
What's that up there?

185
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,290
The tower. . .

186
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,544
. . .which you are never to enter. . .

187
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,716
. . .under any circumstances.

188
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,226
And this is where you'll sleep,
time permitting. Nighty-night.

189
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,146
- But the sun's still up.
- ''But the sun's still up.''

190
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,315
I don't know
if you've ever noticed this,

191
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:20,110
but first impressions
are often entirely wrong.

192
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:25,324
For instance, Klaus, when Sunny
was born, didn't like her at all.

193
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,828
But by the time she was six weeks old,
the two of them were thick as thieves.

194
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,375
A phrase which here means,
''fetching and biting for hours on end. ''

195
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,377
In the case of Count Olaf, however. . .

196
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,339
Orphans!

197
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,341
. . . they were correct.

198
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,053
Every morning, Count Olaf
would order the Baudelaires

199
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,056
to do a great number
of terrible chores.

200
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:53,185
After which he would stalk off
to his mysterious tower room.

201
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,279
And as unfortunate
as their situation seemed,

202
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,323
it was only about to get worse.

203
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,200
--tub full of ice in Baja,

204
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,036
and I realized that these clever girls
had stolen my kidney.

205
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,704
- No!
- No!

206
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,832
Imagine my surprise.

207
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:20,045
Orphans, this is my acting troupe.

208
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,297
Acting troupe, orphans.

209
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:23,924
They don't look rich.

210
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,761
Ugly little people.

211
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,435
Why aren't you children in the kitchen
preparing our dinner?

212
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,062
Dinner?

213
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,815
It's the French word
for the evening meal.

214
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,280
On the back. Flip it.

215
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,076
We'll take it in the dining room
at 8:00.

216
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,787
And we'll expect absolute silence
while we're rehearsing our play.

217
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,999
- But we've never made dinner before.
- It's already 7:30.

218
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,208
Eight o'clock!

219
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,812
Pasta it is.

220
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:22,733
Okay. Let's start casting this puppy.

221
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,320
Now,

222
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,156
who shall play

223
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:32,951
the most handsome count
in all the world?

224
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,167
Would you do it, sir?

225
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,377
Oh, all right.

226
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,215
''Pasta puttanesca.'' That's ltalian
for ''very few ingredients,'' you know.

227
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,716
That's great.

228
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,219
Sunny. Little help.

229
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,431
- Okay, we're gonna need a pot.
- No pot.

230
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,184
- And a strainer.
- No strainer.

231
00:16:58,644 --> 00:16:59,645
Thank you.

232
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:02,981
And a saucepan.

233
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:07,194
This is a little piece I like to call
''Electric Chair.''

234
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,744
I think you might have to turn it up.

235
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,330
Is anybody out there?!

236
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,794
Strainer. That's brilliant.

237
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,295
Sunny, how's that pot coming?

238
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:33,846
Sunny, that's not a pot.
It's a spittoon.

239
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,598
A spittoon? You mean, like. . .?

240
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,518
We'll wash it twice.

241
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:43,939
Well?

242
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,149
It's good. It's really good.

243
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,317
Time check.

244
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,612
Let's go back to prehistoric times,

245
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:54,116
when dinosaurs ruled the earth.

246
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,382
Baudelaire orphans
to the courtesy desk.

247
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,593
Baudelaire orphans
to the courtesy desk.

248
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,190
What do you want?

249
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,692
Dinner is served.

250
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,238
Puttanesca.

251
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:34,948
What did you call me?

252
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,619
It's pasta. Pasta puttanesca.

253
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,537
Where's the roast beef?

254
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,789
Roast beef?

255
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,958
Beef. Yes. Roast beef.

256
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,129
It's the Swedish term for beef
that is roasted.

257
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,342
But you didn't tell us
you wanted roast beef.

258
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:02,601
You know, there's a big world out there
filled with desperate orphans

259
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,354
who would gladly swim across
an ocean of thumbtacks

260
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:10,776
just to be eclipsed by the long shadow
that is cast by my accomplishments.

261
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,278
But I don't care about them.

262
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,573
I chose to open my heart

263
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,327
to you two loverly children

264
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,788
and your hideous primate.

265
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,416
All I ask in return is that you do each
and every thing that pops into my head

266
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,796
while I enjoy the enormous fortune
your parents left behind.

267
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,632
- No.
- Why, you litt--

268
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:53,235
It's time you children learned
a little respect.

269
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,570
You put her down!

270
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,907
You monster!

271
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,538
You all saw it. The boy slipped.

272
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,207
You won't get a cent
until Violet turns 18.

273
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,668
Oh, really?

274
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,170
Says who?

275
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,921
The law. Look it up.

276
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,549
We're going to call Mr. Poe
about this right now.

277
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,933
Are you?

278
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,397
I'm very disappointed
in you, children.

279
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,485
Where were we?

280
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,571
Are you okay?

281
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,239
No.

282
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,286
Klaus, what are you doing?

283
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,496
- I'm going.
- Going where?

284
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:47,956
Home.

285
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,584
This is our home now.

286
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,671
This is not home.

287
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,799
Home is where your parents
put you to bed at night.

288
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,510
Where they teach you to ride a bike.

289
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,930
Or where they get all choked up
on your first day of school.

290
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,474
This is not home.

291
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:11,063
How could they do this to us?

292
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,439
They're just bad people.

293
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,025
Not them. Mom and Dad.

294
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,818
- Klaus!
- What?

295
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:20,072
Violet, you're thinking it too.
How could they?

296
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,990
They had no plan for us at all?

297
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,326
Well, maybe they did have a plan.

298
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,120
Well, sure looks like it to me.

299
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:38,048
Do you remember
when Mom and Dad went to Europe?

300
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,261
And we thought they'd abandoned us
because they didn't even write.

301
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,179
Then we found out they'd written
a long letter.

302
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,681
It had just gotten lost in the mail.

303
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:49,351
Do you remember how guilty we felt
for thinking bad thoughts about them?

304
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,062
This is just like that.

305
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:54,690
No, it's not.

306
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:56,817
Why?

307
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:03,031
Because they're not in Europe.
They're not coming back.

308
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:14,376
Do you think anything
will ever feel like home again?

309
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,433
''Sanctuary''

310
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:35,063
is a word which here means, ''a small,
safe place in a troubling world. ''

311
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:41,236
Like an oasis in a vast desert
or an island in a stormy sea.

312
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,281
The Baudelaires enjoyed their evening
in the sanctuary they'd built together.

313
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,449
I see it. I see it.

314
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:50,078
But in their hearts they knew that
the troubling world lay just outside.

315
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:54,082
A world which, I'm sad to say,
can be described in two dismal words.

316
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,251
Custody granted.

317
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:02,716
Thank you, Your Honor.
Nice doing business with you.

318
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:14,228
Children, I've been contemplating
our situation,

319
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:19,608
and I realize that I've been
a bit standoffish, shall we say.

320
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:22,236
Which in this case is a big,
big word meaning--

321
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,779
Pure evil.

322
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,532
--tough, but fair.

323
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,785
But now that we're family,
I can make it up to you.

324
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:33,121
I can be the ultimate dad.

325
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,832
I know. Let's stop for a treat.

326
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:42,130
Soda. Soda. Banana.

327
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,759
Got it.

328
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:09,408
Violet, where'd the locks go?

329
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:20,711
Hello. I'm going on a perfectly
innocent ride in the country

330
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,213
with my kids, whom I love.

331
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,132
Is that clock correct?

332
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,848
What is it?

333
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,934
I think it's a schedule.

334
00:24:56,455 --> 00:25:01,043
Kiwi Watermelon Surprise. My favorite.

335
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,305
Go!

336
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,605
- He took the keys.
- Try everything.

337
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,534
Chit-chattery chipmunks all singing--

338
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,038
Count Olaf? Hello. Poe.

339
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:41,166
I'm calling you back about
that inheritance question you raised.

340
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,168
- Mr. Poe, thank goodness.
- Who is this?

341
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,337
It's Violet Baudelaire.
We're in Count Olaf's car.

342
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,339
Oh, hello, Violet.
Well, where's Count Olaf?

343
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,674
He's not here right now, but--

344
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,843
You're driving the car alone?

345
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:53,846
No. We're-- The car's on the train
tracks, and the train is coming.

346
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:58,559
I'm sorry, Violet, I can't hear a thing.
I'm driving next to a train!

347
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,978
We're going to be hit by a train.

348
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,690
Right. Yes. I can't hear
because of the train!

349
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:08,193
I'll call you back when I get
to the bank! Goodbye!

350
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:18,495
Klaus, you've read books on trains.
What do we do?

351
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,545
The track switcher.

352
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:28,005
There!

353
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:32,843
It's too far away.

354
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:36,013
No. There has to be something
we can use to pull it.

355
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:39,183
- There's nothing in here.
- There's always something.

356
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,020
Sunny, bite the head off that elf.

357
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:19,306
Quick, pull it back in.

358
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:27,814
- Violet.
- I got it.

359
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,733
I don't mean to rush you.

360
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,658
- Nice shot.
- Thank you. Pull.

361
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:43,849
Mr. Poe. Dear Mr. Poe. Can't we
discuss this like reasonable men?

362
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,434
I'm sorry, Count Olaf.

363
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,644
Allowing a child of Sunny's age
to drive a car

364
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:48,937
is simply not good parenting.

365
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,230
He tried to kill us.

366
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,734
Let us not exaggerate, Klaus.
The vehicle was not even in gear.

367
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:59,239
May I have a moment
alone with the children?

368
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,287
Goodbye, kids.

369
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,414
It's been fun.

370
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,458
I'm going to get you.
No matter where you go,

371
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,669
no matter what you do, I'll find you.

372
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,714
You are so deceased.

373
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,804
Take them, Mr. Poe. . .

374
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,475
. . .before I lose it, bigtime.

375
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,311
Trumping a talentless villain

376
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:32,731
might seem all in a day's work
for three ingenious orphans.

377
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,400
But the Baudelaires
savored their victory

378
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:38,237
as they sped
towards their new home.

379
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,697
What lay ahead for them
was unclear,

380
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:43,158
but they remained
cautiously optimistic

381
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,411
that their next guardian would be
better than the last.

382
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:50,332
Or at least wouldn't try
to flatten them with a train.

383
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,925
Do you know
what kind of scientist he is?

384
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,719
No, I don't. I was far too busy
making arrangements for you three.

385
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:04,137
I didn't have time for chitchat.

386
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:05,639
Hello!

387
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:10,185
Oh, my goodness.

388
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,272
Look at you. You must be Violet.

389
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,691
Do you remember me?
I don't suppose so.

390
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,943
You were just a little baby
at the time.

391
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:21,446
And, Klaus, we've never met.
How do you d--?

392
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:25,284
What a firm grip.
Like a Burmese python.

393
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:30,873
And Sunny. Little Sunny. You look
so much like your dear mother.

394
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:34,835
Thank you very much, Mr. Poe.
I'll take it from here.

395
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:37,379
Oh, perhaps I should come inside.

396
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:39,047
Oh, by all means.

397
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,675
You could help us pick out
the gut worms

398
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,677
from the bowel of the Viscid Boa.

399
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:47,389
Children, remember,
if you need me anytime,

400
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:51,018
you can reach me by phone or fax.

401
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:52,394
Good day.

402
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,400
Well, we got rid of him, didn't we?

403
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:01,862
Come in. Come in. There's not
much time, and we have to pack.

404
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,239
Pack?

405
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:07,743
Did you say ''pack''?

406
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:11,246
Oh, yes. We have to pack
all the equipment.

407
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:14,041
Then there's the essentials,
like clothing and such.

408
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:16,710
And we have to tag all of the snakes
who are coming with us.

409
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,045
Coming where?

410
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,380
Oh, did I mention we're going
to Peru?

411
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,925
- No.
- Yes, we're going to Peru.

412
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:26,386
Tomorrow morning.
Isn't that exciting?

413
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,096
This way to the Reptile Room.

414
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,769
Welcome to my humble abode.

415
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,772
You children know anything
about snakes?

416
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,107
Only what I've read in books.

417
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,276
No, not very much.

418
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:46,073
Well, we may have one or two things
here that aren't in books.

419
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:51,787
I'll just put the big fellow in his bed and
introduce you to a few of me friends.

420
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,122
Over here. . .

421
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:55,624
That's the two-headed cobra.

422
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,793
Well spotted.

423
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,461
Is that a he or a she?

424
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:02,256
I have no idea.
Didn't think it polite to ask.

425
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,426
And over here,
the Tibetan Third-Eye Toad.

426
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:10,013
We can't stop this fellow chanting.
Om. Ribbit.

427
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,268
And now, children, you have
to see my latest discovery.

428
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:19,273
Found him in Tanzania. One of a kind.
The lncredibly Deadly Viper.

429
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,528
My assistant, Gustav, and I may be
the only people ever to have seen him.

430
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:54,766
Oh, I'm sorry. My ribbon just jammed.

431
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,977
Let me just adjust it here.

432
00:32:58,729 --> 00:32:59,688
Right.

433
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:00,856
There we are.

434
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:02,316
Now,

435
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,151
where was I?

436
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,112
Oh, yes. The attack
of the Incredibly Deadly Viper.

437
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:11,533
Not to worry, little one.
You're all right.

438
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:14,411
It can't possibly harm you.
Here we go.

439
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:17,915
The lncredibly Deadly Viper
couldn't have possibly harmed her?

440
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:19,875
No. No, no, no, no.

441
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,420
It's a big softy.

442
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:26,215
One of the least harmful
and most friendly creatures

443
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:27,716
in the animal kingdom.

444
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:29,051
It's a misnomer.

445
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:32,638
I only called him that to play a prank
on those stuffed shirts

446
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,848
down at the Herpetological Society.

447
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:37,851
Uncle Monty,
why are we going to Peru?

448
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:40,062
Just this morning I was wondering,

449
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,564
''How are we all going to get
out of town together?''

450
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:46,235
And I thought, ''Peru.''
They have snakes in Peru, don't they?

451
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,946
But why are we getting out of town?

452
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:54,535
Violet, do you know snakes are more
afraid of you than you are of them?

453
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:57,454
Few people do.

454
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:00,749
When threatened,
a snake will retreat to a place

455
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:04,211
that is quiet, safe, remote.

456
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:10,342
A sanctuary.
Where it can feel out of danger.

457
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,929
That's why Peru.

458
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,727
Wait, that spyglass.
I saw one just like that in our dad's--

459
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,729
Plenty of time for chitchat later.

460
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,732
But right now, what I need
is an inventor,

461
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,276
a reader

462
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:29,111
and a biter.

463
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:30,445
Know any?

464
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:42,457
High upon Highlands
And low upon Tay

465
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:48,964
Bonnie George Campbell
Rode out on a day

466
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:54,970
Saddled and bridled
So gallant rode he

467
00:34:55,846 --> 00:35:00,809
Home came his good horse
But never came he

468
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:06,815
Petunia, what have I told you
about this?

469
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:09,318
She thinks I'm a tree, you know.

470
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:14,907
I think I know that song. I think-- I think
our parents used to play it for us.

471
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:18,243
They certainly did. As I did for mine.

472
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:20,954
- You had children?
- Oh, yes.

473
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,999
And a wife and a home.

474
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,835
Until the fire.

475
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:29,505
A fire?

476
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:34,009
I may know better than anyone
what you're going through.

477
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,137
But it's gonna be all right.

478
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,142
We'll be among people who
understand us. People who are like us.

479
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,853
People who appreciate
unique children

480
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:50,359
who can read and invent
and bite things.

481
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:55,864
Uncle Monty, why are you doing
all this for us?

482
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,701
Isn't that what family does?

483
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:03,997
''And so the Baudelaire children
went to Peru

484
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,916
and together had
wonderful adventures

485
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:09,503
with their loving
and wonderful new guardian.

486
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:12,172
The end. ''

487
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,718
These are the words
I desperately wish I could type.

488
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,306
Oh, I would give anything
to say that the story ends here.

489
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:24,226
But alas, my mission is
not to weave happy endings

490
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:27,729
where they do not occur
but to report the actual events

491
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:31,066
in the lives of the unfortunate
Baudelaire children.

492
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,902
And as much as it pains me,

493
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,906
I must confess that their troubles
had only just begun.

494
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:41,243
And it did so with two musical notes.

495
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:57,759
Hello.

496
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:02,598
I am looking
for Dr. Montgomery Montgomery.

497
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:07,895
I am Stephano. I am an ltalian man,

498
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:13,525
and I am here to assist him
in his research as best I can.

499
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:17,905
As well as to facilitate
and remain observatory.

500
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:19,573
You're Count Olaf.

501
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:28,207
Now, why would you say
something like that?

502
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:32,461
I have never met such a person
as a Count Olaf,

503
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:35,130
but if I had,

504
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:39,927
I'm sure he would look and sound
completely different.

505
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,471
You're Olaf,
and we're not letting you in.

506
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:53,148
Well, perhaps you should re-evaluate
your hypothesis.

507
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:57,819
Anyway, that's why you should
never run with one of these, kids.

508
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:00,614
Words of wisdom indeed,
Mr. Stephano.

509
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:03,408
Oops, you caught me being
a mentor.

510
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,620
And bless you for coming
at such short notice.

511
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,497
Not at all, not at all.

512
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:12,584
My chief assistant, Gustav, took sick
and phoned not one hour ago.

513
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:15,295
He'd give anything
to be here right now.

514
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:20,801
Thank goodness you were available.

515
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:25,931
Well, I am a fan, if I may gush.

516
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:29,434
Your work has profoundly influenced
my research

517
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:32,813
up at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. . .

518
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:35,816
. . .on the sea snake.

519
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,944
It's a very volatile animal.

520
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:44,533
- Perhaps we should--
- I've been bitten 43. . . 700 times.

521
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:46,535
Mostly on the face.

522
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:49,746
A lot of this has been reconstructed.

523
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,498
But I think they did one heck of a job,

524
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:55,043
even though my mustache
is a tad askew.

525
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:01,592
I wonder if I could get the kids
to help me in with my bags.

526
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:04,970
My left side is somewhat
neurologically challenged.

527
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,889
- But of course. Children--
- Uncle Monty--

528
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:11,268
Please. Let us not be rude
to our guest.

529
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:12,769
Now, go on.

530
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,480
What's he up to?

531
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:16,690
I don't know.

532
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,320
There is no good moment, of course,
for a notorious villain to arrive.

533
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,488
But the timing
of Olaf's reappearance,

534
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:27,201
just when Dr. Montgomery's secret
could be revealed to the children,

535
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:30,078
was almost more
than Klaus could bear.

536
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:31,580
Violet, listen to me.

537
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:35,334
Monty's spyglass. I saw
the exact same one in Dad's desk.

538
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:39,129
- Klaus, it's just a coincidence.
- Violet, no.

539
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:41,215
Everything happens for a reason.

540
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:44,718
Now, the children will be helping us
extensively with the research in Peru.

541
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,345
Do you have experience
with children?

542
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:49,848
Children are strange
and foreign to me.

543
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,226
I never really was one.

544
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,812
I know that they are
an important part of the ecosystem.

545
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,023
He's never gonna let us alone
with Monty.

546
00:39:58,232 --> 00:39:59,608
We've gotta get a message to him.

547
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:01,735
Leave that to me.

548
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:05,239
I was feeding the moray,

549
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:09,451
and of course, I got cocky.

550
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,455
And that's all it takes.
That's all it takes, is one time.

551
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,459
Just once.

552
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:20,462
I had the kipper in my mouth,
and I offered it.

553
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:24,174
And there was a team from
National Geographic that were there.

554
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,801
They were filming the whole thing.

555
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:29,471
And, well, a lot of people don't
know this about the moray,

556
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,474
but you think, you know, ''This can't be
a tremendously strong animal.''

557
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:34,977
I mean, sure, it has a certain amount
of strength,

558
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:38,480
but how does it pull a man's face
into a cave?

559
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,149
Anyway, long story short,

560
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,694
the bends,
a reconstructive surgery. . .

561
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:49,074
But yes, from my understanding,
Peru is a wonderful place.

562
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:51,201
The beaches. The people.

563
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:52,661
The relaxed guardianship laws.

564
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:55,998
Relaxed guardianship laws?

565
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,209
Did I say that?

566
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:02,129
Darn neurotoxins.

567
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:06,842
Oh, Stephano, you have
a wonderful gift for storytelling.

568
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:09,845
- Doesn't he, children?
- Oh, yeah.

569
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:13,140
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
milking Petunia for me.

570
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:18,645
Petunia. Well, the milking. . .
Now, see, what I was--

571
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:20,022
Could I just. . .?

572
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,150
Yeah, sure. I'll take a shot at that.

573
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:27,237
Now, they used to call me Old
MacDonald up at the milking lab there,

574
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:29,364
because I'd milk these things
all day long.

575
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:33,368
But the little udders
are hard to locate.

576
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:37,956
Anyway, why don't you take that

577
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,959
and go ahead and start the party
without me, and then. . .

578
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:46,256
I'm not sure I brought my milking gear.
I'll take a gander.

579
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,061
Is he still watching?

580
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:01,522
Yes.

581
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,941
Don't look at me.
Pretend you're talking to Klaus.

582
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,026
Okay.

583
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:09,530
I got your message.
Don't worry. I know.

584
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,698
- You do?
- Yes.

585
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,868
A moray eel would never eat kippers.
Far too salty.

586
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:17,579
And did you see the way he kept
glancing into my satchel,

587
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:19,915
where I keep
the exotic snake venoms?

588
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:24,127
You children were right.
Stephano is an imposter.

589
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,337
Yes.

590
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,256
He's a spy from
the Herpetological Society.

591
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,633
He's here to steal
the lncredibly Deadly Viper.

592
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:30,843
- No.
- No. Uncle Monty--

593
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:38,642
Darn. All finished. I was
so looking forward to the milking.

594
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,895
Isn't it about time you kids
went to bed?

595
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:46,066
Absolutely.
Early start tomorrow, children.

596
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,484
Off you go.

597
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:49,611
Good night.

598
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:58,662
Oh, and if you kids should get
restless during the night,

599
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:02,624
I'm right down the hall,
and I'm a very light sleeper.

600
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:07,296
In fact, I hardly sleep at all.

601
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,518
Do you have a hall pass?

602
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:27,024
I didn't think so.

603
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:31,653
Oh, Petunia, I'm going to miss you.

604
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:36,033
You're such a good girl, aren't you?

605
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,577
Such a pretty girl.

606
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:42,456
You are. Yes, you are.

607
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:47,085
Oh, yes, you are.

608
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:51,381
It is a curious thing,
the death of a loved one.

609
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,260
Uncle Monty?

610
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:58,388
It's like walking up the stairs
to your bedroom in the dark

611
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:01,892
and thinking that there's
one more stair than there is.

612
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:04,686
Your foot falls down through the air,

613
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:08,106
and there's a sickly moment
of dark surprise.

614
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:11,235
Uncle Monty?

615
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,493
The children's grief
was not only for their uncle

616
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:23,330
but for that tender hope that they
may have found home again.

617
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:26,708
A hope which, thanks to a villainous
actor, was now slowly tumbling away.

618
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:35,843
I do feel somewhat responsible
for this tragedy.

619
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:39,221
I should've taken it upon myself
to warn him

620
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,014
that the lncredibly Deadly Viper

621
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:44,226
is the most deadly snake
in the entire ecosystem.

622
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:47,437
I should know. I discovered it.

623
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:48,981
You what?

624
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:50,482
Detective?

625
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,362
Little girl, the big cage door is open,
no snake. Dead guy.

626
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:56,780
You know what I'm thinking?

627
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:59,867
I'm thinking, ''Who woke me up
at 9 in the morning for this?''

628
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:03,287
It's definitely a snake bite.
There's no question about it.

629
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:05,289
Snake bite, no question about it.
Thanks, doc.

630
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:08,417
You don't understand, the lncredibly
Deadly Viper couldn't have killed him,

631
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,086
because it's one of the least dangerous
and most friendly creatures

632
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,504
in the animal kingdom.

633
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:14,506
You mind if I skip the paperwork
on this?

634
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:19,094
I think that'd be best. These kids
have been through a major upheaval.

635
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,140
I wonder if it's a good idea, even,
to change their plans at this point.

636
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:26,101
We were headed for Peru tomorrow,

637
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,729
- and the tickets are nonrefundable.
- No.

638
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:29,897
Doc, what do you think?

639
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:32,733
Could be the only chance
for them to get closure.

640
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:35,444
Closure. Thank you, doc.

641
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:37,738
From interviews with witnesses
who were there that day,

642
00:45:37,946 --> 00:45:41,575
I have learned the following about
the youngest Baudelaire's plan:

643
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:43,577
Brave Sunny started here

644
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,537
and approached
the Incredibly Deadly Viper

645
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:47,831
with single-minded determination.

646
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:51,335
No, he's Count Olaf,
and that doctor is his accomplice.

647
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:52,961
He tried to kill us with a train.

648
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,173
- And where would this man get a train?
- Where am I gonna get a train?

649
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,091
Children, that's enough
of this foolishness.

650
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:01,136
Mr. Stephano bears absolutely
no resemblance to Count Olaf.

651
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:04,973
Who is this incredibly handsome
Count Olaf they keep speaking of?

652
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:08,936
Count Olaf is their old guardian,
who made an error in judgment.

653
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:13,649
What about the tattoo? Count Olaf
had a tattoo of an eye on his ankle.

654
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:16,318
Anything for the kids.

655
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:20,822
Voilà! Spick-and-span.

656
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:23,116
Well, he's an actor.
He covered it with makeup.

657
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,829
Doctor, I wonder if you
could help me escort

658
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:30,499
- these young children to the vehicle.
- No. Mr. Poe--

659
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:32,459
- No, Mr. Poe!
- I'll send you a postcard.

660
00:46:32,668 --> 00:46:34,837
About one thing,
all the witnesses agreed.

661
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:39,842
The sound they heard next
was so shocking, so surprising,

662
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,427
it still haunts them to this day.

663
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:56,525
Damn it. This was
such a good character.

664
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:21,675
Bum buttery, bluebird is singing a tune

665
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:26,221
Rest assured, children, the authorities
are in hot pursuit of Mr. Stephano,

666
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,933
from his eyebrowless forehead
to his untattooed ankle.

667
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,060
The ltalian fiend.

668
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:34,730
Though still in the clutches
of a clueless banker,

669
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:37,566
the Baudelaires celebrated
their unmasking of Count Olaf

670
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:41,612
as they skimmed their way across
the icy surface of Lake Lachrymose.

671
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:45,741
But Klaus wasn't the sort to think
on the surface of anything.

672
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:48,118
He knew there was something
beneath their journey,

673
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:51,038
even though all he had to go on
was a spyglass,

674
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:55,542
the knowledge of another terrible fire
and two words on a slip of paper.

675
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:57,711
Aunt Josephine?

676
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:00,047
Never heard of her.

677
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:05,385
Does it strike you as odd that none
of our relatives are related to us?

678
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,695
Aunt Josephine?

679
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:28,408
Baudelaires? Is that you?

680
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:29,785
Yes.

681
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:32,621
Oh, good.

682
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:33,914
Come in. Come in. Come in.

683
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:37,251
Hurricane Herman
is about to arrive at any time now.

684
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:42,422
Oh, Violet. Look at you.

685
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:43,924
Hello.

686
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:46,093
Come in, quickly. Quickly, children.

687
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:47,636
- What? What?
- What's the matter?

688
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,932
Not that quickly. You could trip
over the welcome mat

689
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:53,517
and decapitate yourselves.

690
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:59,481
So, quickly, but not too quickly,
all right?

691
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:16,707
I'm sorry it's so chilly in here.

692
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:20,878
Sometimes it gets so cold
I can hardly stand it.

693
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:23,797
Would you like me to turn the radiator
up for you, Aunt Josephine?

694
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:28,302
Oh, no. I never turn on the radiator.
I'm frightened that it might explode.

695
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:33,682
Children, I must ask you not to use
any of the doorknobs in the house.

696
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:39,104
Just push on the wood of the door,
and it'll open.

697
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:40,439
Why?

698
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:42,941
Well, I'm always afraid
that the doorknobs

699
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,860
will shatter into a million tiny pieces,

700
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:46,820
and one of them will hit my eye.

701
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:53,952
''Delmo'' is not a word.

702
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:58,123
I can see that I'm going to have to
teach her proper English.

703
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:07,716
Grammar is the greatest joy in life,
don't you find?

704
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,218
- Most definitely.
- I love grammar.

705
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:20,062
Perfect. Nice hot soup.

706
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:24,066
Actually, it's chilled cucumber soup.

707
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,692
I never cook anything hot.

708
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:28,779
I'm afraid that the stove
will burst into flames.

709
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,197
Where's your brother?

710
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:31,740
The kitchen.

711
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:33,450
Klaus?

712
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:35,953
What are you doing?

713
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:37,412
Napkins.

714
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:42,751
Napkins are here. Come away from
the fridge. If it falls, it'll crush you flat.

715
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:45,754
All right.

716
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:49,174
Everyone, would you like
to see some pictures?

717
00:50:53,011 --> 00:50:54,972
Careful. Don't get a paper cut.

718
00:50:58,475 --> 00:50:59,476
Is this lke?

719
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:02,938
Wasn't he handsome?

720
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:09,945
All the things you did,
Aunt Josephine.

721
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:11,947
You tamed lions?

722
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:17,953
Oh, I was quite adventurous
when lke was alive.

723
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:35,137
Uncle Monty?
You knew Uncle Monty?

724
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:37,973
No. That's not a good picture of me.

725
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:40,767
Wait, is. . .? Is that our parents?

726
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:42,811
Was this some sort of club?

727
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:45,480
Why do you all have
these spyglasses?

728
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:50,485
I don't like the way I look
in that picture.

729
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:56,700
Did lke die in a fire?

730
00:51:57,075 --> 00:52:00,204
No, no, no, no. Silly child, no.

731
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:03,123
He was eaten by leeches.

732
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:07,836
Come, I'll show you.

733
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:17,721
Watch the chandelier, children.
If it falls, it will impale you.

734
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:43,372
Ike and I explored every cove and inlet
of Lake Lachrymose,

735
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,041
from Horrid Harbor,

736
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:51,088
all the way over to Curdled Cave,
way over there.

737
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:54,758
And near that rock is
where the leeches attacked.

738
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,347
Lachrymose leeches have six rows

739
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:03,225
of very sharp teeth,
and one very sharp nose.

740
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:07,855
They are blind, but they can smell food
on a human from miles away.

741
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:12,150
And if they smell food,
they will swarm.

742
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:20,742
I told him, ''lke, you must wait one hour
before going into the water.''

743
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:22,411
But. . .

744
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:27,749
. . .he only waited 45 minutes,

745
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,126
and. . .

746
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:40,762
I apologize, children.

747
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:42,890
Klaus!

748
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:46,643
That area is private.
That was lke's room.

749
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:53,609
Oh, God, I hate it here.

750
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:58,906
Well, Aunt Josephine,
have you ever thought

751
00:53:59,114 --> 00:54:00,532
of maybe moving someplace else?

752
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:04,411
Maybe if you moved away from Lake
Lachrymose you might feel better.

753
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:07,539
I could never,

754
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:12,044
never, never, never sell this house.

755
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,714
I'm terrified of realtors.

756
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:18,467
There are two kinds of fears:

757
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:21,637
rational and irrational.

758
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:25,641
Being afraid of realtors
is an irrational fear.

759
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:27,267
Is this a bad time?
