2
00:00:25,177 --> 00:00:26,723
To the people of this country

3
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:29,200
The roar you hear is the sound of hope.

4
00:00:29,598 --> 00:00:31,497
The sound of Rhodes
Enterprises

5
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:33,044
Experimental aircraft 109

6
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:34,989
The sound of its crucial maiden flight.

7
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:38,552
A flight piloted by Fred Norwood, one
of our most capable test pilots.

8
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,428
A flight that could signal the beginning

9
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:43,309
Of a billion dollar air force contract.

10
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:46,092
In fact, the air force insignia is
already on the plane.

11
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:48,489
in confident anticipation
of air force approval.

12
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:50,833
Oh, ladies and gentlemen Mr. Rhodes.
Please a few questions.

13
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:51,925
I'm sorry, I'm late now.

14
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:53,036
Sorry, sir.

15
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:55,257
That was Victor Rhodes,
 ladies and gentlemen.

16
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:56,399
president of Rhodes Enterprises.

17
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:58,142
The man who spent $250 million

18
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,270
developing the X109.

19
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:07,477
Had a last minute call
from the Board of Directors.

20
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:08,520
How's Norwood doing?

21
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,933
Still to reach the initial
test of altitude.

22
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,174
Chase One, you with him?

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,760
Chase One. Roger, I see him.

24
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:23,713
Hey, something moving around
 to the north of here.

25
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,786
I saw it, too. Looked like
an aircraft to me.

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,900
could be some civilian off course.

27
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,290
Go have a look, Chase One.

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,184
Roger!

29
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:37,997
Norwich to Chase One.

30
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,301
Have you spotted anything?

31
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,606
Come in, Chase One.

32
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,519
Holy Moises!
What was that?

33
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,958
Flycom, Flycom, I got a bogey here.

34
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,224
Hey, here it comes again.

35
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,067
Unidentified craft buzzing 109.

36
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:08,546
Repeat, Unidentified craft buzzing 109.

37
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:21,669
You! What's he doing?

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,146
That's not on the flight plan.

39
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:28,119
Norwich, this is Tim.
Why aren't you communicating?

40
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:32,790
Look at those turns!

41
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,376
What's he doing?

42
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,227
Fred, what's got into you?

43
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:38,657
109, report!

44
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,393
Not answering, sir.

45
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:41,571
Well, keep after him.

46
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:43,572
109 this is earphone.

47
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:48,268
Got a bogey here.
Repeat, bogey.

48
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:50,891
Chasing me all over the sky.

49
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,145
Cannot identify it. Cannot chase it.

50
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,669
Look at that.
Mark 2 now!

51
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,872
Norwich, come in.

52
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:09,059
He's diving!

53
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:14,145
Fred, this is Rhodes.

54
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:16,098
Bring that plane in, do you hear me?

55
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,677
Throttle down and bring it in.
Over.

56
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,773
Where in the hell did it go?

57
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,500
He tested every ship I've designed.

58
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,069
Fred is a reliable pilot.

59
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,085
Look at the quotes here.
Blood pressure,

60
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:41,061
respiration, skin temperature

61
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,273
That's a profile of a man losing his head.

62
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:45,671
Vick, Vick, you approved him, remember?

63
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,874
For the same reason  I did, his records.

64
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,664
Records don't mean a thing,
Tim, when a man panics.

65
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,999
Blanchard.
Where's Norwood?

66
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:56,475
He's uh...he's coming, sir.

67
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:57,874
You were up there,
what happened?

68
00:05:57,963 --> 00:06:00,991
I'm afraid I can't help you, sir.
I was looking the other way.

69
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,858
What?

70
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,311
Well, I was checking out
 that flashing light we saw.

71
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,538
Oh, that you mean the aircraft off course.

72
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,523
No sir, it turned
out to be sunlight

73
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,182
letting off of cold
air layer, or...

74
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:12,327
temperature inversion

75
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:15,344
Just our luck you had
to be chasing a mirage.

76
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,495
Sir, it gave the impression
of a flying object.

77
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,061
yes, yes.

78
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,229
Mr. Norwood,

79
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:35,550
 what the devil were
you doing up there?

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,293
I was dodging that bogey.

81
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:38,426
Bogey?
What bogey?

82
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,230
The UFO, the flying saucer.

83
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,598
Flying saucer?

84
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,211
Well you heard me up there.

85
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,078
I had everything I could
do to avoid a collision

86
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:54,067
A collision?

87
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,638
You mean with another aircraft?

88
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:58,712
I suppose you could call it an aircraft.
It would fly.

89
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:03,293
Disk-like maybe 40 feet in diameter.

90
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,477
Shiny, metallic.

91
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:09,863
Well if it was metal as you say,
 it appeared on the radar.

92
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:11,575
Something that size would have to,
yes sir.

93
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:13,598
McDonald,
why haven't we heard about this?

94
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:16,438
Well, sir, all I saw was the 109.

95
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:17,801
And the chase plane.

96
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,063
Until I lost picture due to static.

97
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:22,259
Pete, it had to be there!

98
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,074
Norwood, I'm going to be honest with you.

99
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,290
Indications are you saw a mirage.

100
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:29,587
Sir, this was no mirage,
 it was real.

101
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:30,434
it w-

102
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,957
I don't know what else to call it.
 It was a flying saucer.

103
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,637
No mirage, real.

104
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,145
 It was solid metal.
The sun glinting off it.

105
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:40,556
The sun glinted off it!
Now just a minute.

106
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,387
Blanchard.

107
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,527
Tell us what you told
us a few minutes ago.

108
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,486
Fred, that thing I chased,

109
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:47,996
that flash of light,

110
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,996
Weather people confirmed this now.

111
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:53,285
it's due to an inversion layer.

112
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:55,338
Now Blanchard,
tell him what you told us.

113
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:57,432
The sun glinting off the cold air.

114
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:59,573
giving the impression of?

115
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,666
Oh, the impression of a flying object.

116
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:04,440
-Damn it, I can tell illusion from-

117
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:05,473
-Can you, Norwood?

118
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:07,184
Maybe down here you can.

119
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:10,051
But up there, in an
untried aircraft,

120
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,849
in a condition
verging on hysteria

121
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:12,887
That I doubt.

122
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:14,764
-On hysteria?
-Yes, hysteria.

123
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,520
Look for yourself.

124
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,348
Here it is.

125
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:22,426
Blood pressure soaring, pulse racing.

126
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:24,317
Evidence, Mr. Norwood.

127
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:29,347
And radar indicates that you
were there all...by...yourself.

128
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:31,722
Evidence, Mr. Norwood.

129
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:33,746
Suggesting that you
risked destroying

130
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,418
the 109 to avoid
collision with a mirage.

131
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:39,988
It may not be the first time
 it's happened to a pilot nor the last.

132
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,934
Bur Mr. Norwood,

133
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:45,238
it's the last time
for you in the 109.

134
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:51,260
Tim, we're expected in the board room.

135
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,457
I'll be there

136
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,121
Buddy,

137
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:16,660
See you around.

138
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:33,895
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes

139
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,344
Is one  of those for me?

140
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:36,383
Madam

141
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,000
How is he?

142
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,336
Here you are Freddy my boy

143
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:51,184
A Vetry special 9:1

144
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:53,661
Well, cheers everybody.

145
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,492
Done over the art arm
 first one today and all that.

146
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:00,685
Fred?

147
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,977
What?

148
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,625
The Martini, dear brother, what else?

149
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:09,817
Look, Fred, if it's just the job

150
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,334
No it isn't, Joe.

151
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:12,824
You understand.

152
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:14,246
It's pride.

153
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:18,101
I'm the hot test pilot who
panics and has hallucinations.

154
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:20,649
Nobody believes that.

155
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,895
Yes, they do.

156
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:24,118
You're my best friend, and...

157
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:27,415
you're my sister and I can see on
your faces you don't believe me.

158
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,080
Now, if you two don't believe  me,
who's gonna believe me?

159
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:33,027
Whether we believe you or not,
 we're still on your side.

160
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:34,676
I know that, Joe.

161
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:39,402
and I'm gonna take advantage of that.

162
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:41,231
So take advantage!

163
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:42,996
Of anything you say.

164
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:45,474
I saw that laser radar you have.

165
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,668
I'd like to have it.

166
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,324
Along with two operators.

167
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:51,512
 I'll pay 'em.
 I've got 18 thousand bucks at the bank.

168
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,513
Wait, wait wait, you just lost me.

169
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:58,344
Well, somehow that saucer...

170
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:02,007
blacks out normal radio
and radar communication

171
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:02,953
Something like...

172
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,961
 the ionosphere blackout our
astronauts go through.

173
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:07,969
You tell me that you think

174
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,740
this saucer has set up

175
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,978
an ionized cloud around itself?

176
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:13,414
That's what I figured.

177
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,188
But your laser radar ought to

178
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:17,008
penetrate it. Give
us a normal blip.

179
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,048
Now, there's a spot on
 that desert in Nevada.

180
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:22,143
That there's practically no air traffic.

181
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,891
now any blip that does show
up should be unusual.

182
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,643
I want to get myself
a fast job, like a B-51

183
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,352
I'm going to model
with cameras.

184
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,413
Anything that's moving upstairs

185
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:31,471
I'll go up and take a look.

186
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:33,718
Do you want to try and
photograph a flying saucer,

187
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,180
 is that it?

188
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,211
That's it.

189
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,214
Does the bed break?
That's Dorthy , Milfred.

190
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,825
How do you do?
-How do you do?

191
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,324
Very close in here, isn't it?

192
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
That's not too bad.

193
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,933
I've forgotten how crowded
these things were.

194
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:05,855
How was your flight?

195
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:08,339
Fine, wonderful.
-Good. Good.

196
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:09,550
Well?

197
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:12,121
What's it all about?

198
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:14,449
It's Norwood, Mr. Vetry.

199
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,285
He's so groggy
he's seeing things.

200
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,910
He tried to land on 70 feet
 of air the other day.

201
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:21,264
So we figured
we better call you.

202
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:23,641
The thing is, all of
us work in shifts.

203
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:24,558
Fred...

204
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,077
he ain't slept more than two,

205
00:12:26,102 --> 00:12:27,980
maybe three hours at a time,
the whole month.

206
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,699
He just keeps going up there,
checking everything on the scope.

207
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,371
And today, for instance.

208
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,316
A flight of geese,

209
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:36,129
Weather balloon,

210
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:38,214
A couple of false radar returns,

211
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:40,300
He's gone up, uh,...

212
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,766
six times so far and
it's only sundown.

213
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,285
You mean to tell me how good?

214
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:45,636
You can't tell the
difference between

215
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:47,113
a flight of geese
and an aircraft

216
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:47,800
On that scope?

217
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:50,535
Sure I can.
He goes up anyway.

218
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:52,822
"Wanna see for myself", he says.

219
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,535
And zoom!
He's off again.

220
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:12,903
Clumsy ox!

221
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,336
At least we know he is really asleep.

222
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:16,429
yeah.

223
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,898
Come in!

224
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,492
Mr. Vetry.

225
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:33,203
We have a blip on the scope.

226
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,562
Looks phony but I figured I ought
to tell you about it anyway.

227
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:36,452
You know?

228
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,507
yeah. Are you sure it's a bad return?

229
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,381
Well, we all looked over pretty careful.

230
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:41,836
I wouldn't look for it, but...

231
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,523
he'll raise a devil if he
found out he missed one.

232
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:46,124
Yeah.

233
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:47,937
Ok, Pete, thanks.

234
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:55,440
I'd uh...I'd better go
 up there take a look.

235
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:57,297
What?

236
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,250
Fly up there?

237
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,359
Why?

238
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,268
OK, I flew Mustangs all over Korea,
remember?

239
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,447
Is it really necessary?

240
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:13,175
Yeah. I'd better go.

241
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,273
it won't kill me, you know.

242
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:53,617
Why didn't you wake me?

243
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:55,181
Mr. Vetry didn't want us to.

244
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,593
We got something here, Fred.

245
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,226
See, first it's here, then way over here

246
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:00,609
and nothing flies like that.

247
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:04,676
Hey, remote.

248
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,617
I see it!

249
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,681
Light.
A flashing red light.

250
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:11,208
Hard to make out.

251
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:12,601
it's like a headlight of a

252
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:14,099
car coming at you at night.

253
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,349
But it's big!

254
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,642
Big and round!

255
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:18,408
I'm going after it.

256
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,923
Joe, we read you.

257
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:23,501
Come in, Over.

258
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,322
Look, I've got two blips.

259
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,267
Bogey closing in.

260
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:31,093
Ha! Tell ol' Freddy I got him a live one.

261
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:32,579
Tell him...

262
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:37,383
Something's jammed his radio.

263
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:39,109
Look, it's buzzing 'im

264
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,476
Like it did me.

265
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,742
Joe, dive!

266
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,297
Get away from it!

267
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,656
Joe, dive!

268
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,664
Dive!

269
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:57,179
Joe!

270
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:09,965
Are you Norwood?

271
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,332
I didn't expect you so soon.

272
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,216
I'm Tom Orvel for Federal aviation Agency.

273
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:16,934
My partner, Dick Carey.

274
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,981
We found this.
It has your name on it.

275
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:27,065
It's part of my helmet.

276
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:28,964
Joe was wearing it.

277
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:31,573
We haven't found the body yet. But...

278
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:34,628
 I'm beginning to think it just
disintegrated like the plane.

279
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:36,948
Disintegrated?

280
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:38,112
That's right.

281
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:40,449
I've been investigating
crashes for six years,

282
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:42,370
but I have never seen
anything like this.

283
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,964
Vetry's plane literally
 came apart in midair like...

284
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,340
disassembled piece by piece.

285
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,948
What was he doing up there, anyway?

286
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:54,348
He was chasing a UFO.

287
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:02,636
You mean this UFO is
responsible for Vetry's death?

288
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,323
I was responsible.

289
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:24,143
Well, Mr. Peterson's expecting
you, captain. Go right in.

290
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:33,229
The president's scientific advisory
board is handling that in.

291
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,565
Well, build a firearm.

292
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:38,328
I want action and I mean fast.

293
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:39,415
Get back to me.

294
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:46,245
Mr. Peters, Fred Norwood.

295
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:48,469
Please sit down.

296
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:54,183
Thank you, Captain.

297
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:56,347
And give my regards to your CO.

298
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:57,659
I'll Sir.

299
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,222
While flight testing the X-109,

300
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,104
You were buzzed by a UFO.

301
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:17,290
Or to be more accurate...

302
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:18,683
you claimed you were.

303
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:20,617
That's right.

304
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:22,360
Your flight control people

305
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,094
said it was a mirage, right?

306
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:27,602
You seem to have all the facts there.

307
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:32,663
Was it a, uh, mirage, Mr. Norwood?

308
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:34,688
No.

309
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:43,617
Would you take a look at this, please?

310
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:52,642
Did your UFO look anything like that?

311
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,067
Very much so, yes, sir.

312
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:58,757
Thank you.

313
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,106
Mary, see if we can get the
secretary on the scrambler

314
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,444
May I ask you who drew this?

315
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:12,949
A peasant.

316
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:16,163
Who lives in a remote border
 village of Red China.

317
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:24,872
Mrs, Secretary, Norwood just
authenticated our Chinese sketch.

318
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:27,304
Yes.

319
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:29,328
I think this doubles the urgency.

320
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,184
Yes Sir.

321
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:36,247
Give me Major Lee

322
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,594
Did you say

323
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:40,005
Red China?

324
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,793
yes,

325
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:44,311
The peasant claimed
 that that sketch...

326
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:47,200
is the
likeness of a "Thing".

327
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:50,388
Hidden in the ruined
church near his village.

328
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:51,887
How did it get there?

329
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,467
Presumably it landed there.

330
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,497
The ruin was roofless.

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,957
Landed?

332
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:59,200
By whom?

333
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,465
The bodies of two, uh...

334
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,687
creatures

335
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:06,286
Were found nearby.

336
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:08,755
Human like, and yet different.

337
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,223
The peasant's description
wasn't too intelligent.

338
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:13,941
But we assumed they died

339
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,699
because they lacked immunity
to earth's bacteria.

340
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:19,785
But they must have
been oxygen breathers.

341
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:22,004
Or they wouldn't have
 ventured from the ship.

342
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:24,426
That's purely conjecture, of course.

343
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:25,863
The remains?

344
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:27,577
The bodies decayed
very rapidly and

345
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:29,755
the peasants cremated
what was left.

346
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:40,655
Major Laiton, how are you doing with
the ordinance and survival gear?

347
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:44,590
Next week my foot!
We fly off tomorrow.

348
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,334
Well try the marine corp,
 they'll give you fast action.

349
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,584
You're sending in a team to investigate?

350
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:58,217
Investigate and destroy.

351
00:20:58,684 --> 00:20:59,840
Now Sam Archibald,

352
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:01,254
our agent in China,

353
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:03,019
They'd get all of the second half.

354
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,590
And it could be a hoax.

355
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,420
But if it is there,

356
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:09,340
that thing could be so
scientifically advanced,

357
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:11,589
that to make our technology obsolete.

358
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:14,426
And if the Red Chinese
get their hands on it

359
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:15,418
The free world!

360
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:16,613
is obsolete.

361
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:19,465
All this is top secret, isn't it?

362
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:20,854
Obviously.

363
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:23,246
And yet you told me much
more than I need to know.

364
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:24,535
Why?

365
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:26,543
Well, that's obvious, too.

366
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:28,918
You want me to go along?

367
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:33,261
You're not expecting me to fly?

368
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:35,981
No, no, no, but you'll build a career.

369
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,894
Orienting yourself to strange aircraft.

370
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:42,488
You might get some faint
notion as to how it operates.

371
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:46,051
Will you go?

372
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:55,472
Hurry up and wait.

373
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:57,809
They won't be much longer, do you think?

374
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,159
I don't know, Dave but
griping about it won't help.

375
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:01,426
Ah! You forget.

376
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:03,120
I'm an American Citizen now.

377
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,661
And griping is one of our most

378
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:07,075
cherished constitutional
privileges.

379
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:09,114
Yes, sir.

380
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,138
You may go in now.

381
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:26,527
Fred, I'd like to have you
meet my two favorite geniuses:

382
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:28,309
Jack Garson

383
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:29,832
Electronics wizard

384
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:32,928
And Dave Ethrom, master metallurgist.

385
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:35,531
Gentlemen, Fred Norwood.

386
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,672
The test pilot I told you about.

387
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:39,664
He's just agreed to go with us.

388
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,319
Almost on the target.

389
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:04,105
Sleepy, Jack?
Or just bored?

390
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,885
Trying to pop my ears.
-What?

391
00:23:07,282 --> 00:23:09,244
I'm just trying to pop my ears!

392
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:10,196
oh!

393
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:14,290
Hey, Dave?

394
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:16,314
You ever jump before?

395
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:17,954
Me neither.

396
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:20,798
I just hope I don't
freeze in the door.

397
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:23,109
Rest easy, old boy.

398
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,164
If that happens, the jump master

399
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:26,955
chap will give you a shot.

400
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,439
Thanks a lot, buddy.

401
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:33,928
Time to put the hook up!

402
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
I'm gonna remind
you men one again...

403
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,445
To bear your shoes and helmets...

404
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:41,500
thoroughly.

405
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:43,812
That means that there
is not one inch shown.

406
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:46,072
Group on me.

407
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:48,319
Don't leave any friends in the soft dirt.

408
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,002
There may be red Chinese

409
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:51,508
patrolling down there.

410
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:52,830
And remember...

411
00:23:52,854 --> 00:23:55,195
These 45s are the last resort.

412
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,109
One shot is going to
track a thousand commys.

413
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:00,125
Whatever you do...

414
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:02,167
Don't shoot our guys.

415
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:03,492
Any questions?

416
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:04,850
Yeah.

417
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:07,092
How the devil did
I get into this mess?

418
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:09,555
Because you're the
most expendable

419
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,630
electronics genius available, old boy.

420
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:13,395
Stand by!

421
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:21,433
Go!

422
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,678
Whoa

423
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:17,999
Easy does it.

424
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:20,335
You must be Norwood.

425
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:21,858
Yes, that's right.

426
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:23,749
I'm Sam Archibald.

427
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,913
Welcome to China.

428
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,514
You alright?

429
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:31,460
I think so.

430
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:32,657
Good.

431
00:25:42,147 --> 00:25:43,561
Got all the boxes?

432
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,655
The other two men are down safe.

433
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:46,889
Fill us in, Sam.

434
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:50,624
Well, our objective is
about 75 miles due west.

435
00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:52,788
They've got a Catholic church.

436
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:54,163
Guided by the Reds?

437
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:55,805
Yes, about 5 years ago

438
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,463
when they murdered the priest.

439
00:25:57,908 --> 00:25:59,908
The peasants hate the Commies for it.

440
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:02,586
So when they found a saucer in the church

441
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:04,681
The village leader got word to me.

442
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:06,633
And he drew the sketch from memory?

443
00:26:06,714 --> 00:26:07,547
Yes.

444
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,359
So you haven't seen the saucer?

445
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:13,338
But I believe the man.

446
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:14,500
Sam...

447
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:18,211
What is the strength of the Red
Chinese army in this district?

448
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:20,338
Four companies at Changsha

449
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:24,859
And the territory between here and
our objective is heavily patrolled.

450
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:27,119
Are they likely to find the saucer?

451
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,203
Normally, a commy shuns a Catholic church

452
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:33,305
Besides, they don't even
know the saucer exists.

453
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:41,187
Well, you two apparently
survived your maiden leap.

454
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:43,338
Oh, no sweat.
Piece of cake.

455
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:45,909
(Speaking in chinese)

456
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:53,957
Jack Dawson, Dave Ephrom

457
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:56,219
our man in China, Sam Archibald.

458
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:57,383
Oh.

459
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:27,832
Red soldiers.

460
00:27:28,926 --> 00:27:31,069
Maybe they saw
our parachutes last night.

461
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:34,318
I don't think their after us,
Brad, they got a prisoner.

462
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:39,499
Probably the peasants who
resist the Chinese regime.

463
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:42,622
Poor guy.
Blue team patrol.

464
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:43,755
yeah...

465
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,780
It's too close for comfort.

466
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:47,804
it's going to be a long, hard journey.

467
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:13,578
Alright!
Take a rest, everybody.

468
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,950
How much further, Sam?

469
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,551
Well...

470
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:35,431
We're about here.

471
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,502
The church is about 20 miles here.

472
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:48,041
There's a village in the middle.

473
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:50,234
that might quarter red soldiers

474
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:51,986
so we better bypass it.

475
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:07,210
What's going on?

476
00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:09,234
I want him to
fill the canteens.

477
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:10,851
but he sad he's
got a sore foot.

478
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,630
I'll get another man.
Don't bother.

479
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,349
Give them all a break.
I'll take them.

480
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:16,869
 Stream's right down that direction.

481
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,616
Hey! Wait a minute!

482
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,099
Please, I won't hurt you.

483
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:32,165
(Speaking Russian)

484
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:46,189
(Speaking Russian)

485
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:58,821
(Speaking Russian)

486
00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:27,903
Red soldiers?
-No, Russians

487
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,043
Russians! one of them said "niet".

488
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:33,590
Russians.

489
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:35,708
Of course.

490
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:54,691
I know one thing.

491
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:57,528
Any more shooting will
attract the Chinese soldiers.

492
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:58,629
If it hasn't already.

493
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,081
I tried to stop Ephrom, but

494
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:01,676
we can't stake him down here.

495
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,286
maybe we aught to pull out.

496
00:32:03,426 --> 00:32:04,349
It wouldn't help.

497
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:07,614
They'll run us down easily,
unless we abandon our equipment.

498
00:32:07,787 --> 00:32:10,733
Sam, go back and see if we
have any quarters left.

499
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:11,185
Ok.

500
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:21,906
Hey, What's that?

501
00:32:28,388 --> 00:32:30,000
Americans!

502
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:36,156
Americans!
Don't shoot!

503
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,472
We wish to parley with you.

504
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:12,906
Ok, lady.

505
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,515
Go ahead and parley.

506
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:21,680
Our leader tells me
 to inform you...

507
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:23,468
Tell your leader to
get out of here at 2,

508
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,320
or this parlay is
finished right now.

509
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:51,234
What are you Americans doing here?

510
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:02,760
If you are followed by
our friends and allies,

511
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:06,119
...the soldiers of
Chinese Socialist Republic,

512
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:07,539
You will be shot.

513
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,750
We urge you to go back
where you come from.

514
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:23,221
and we will not inform our

515
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:25,044
allies that you were here.

516
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,658
I uh

517
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:38,329
shall take your, shall
we say ultimatum

518
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:39,587
under advisory.

519
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:43,095
But I must confirm with my comrades.

520
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:45,814
Fred!

521
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:04,185
I recognize one of their guys
from the pictures in our files.

522
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:05,615
Zagorsky

523
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:07,779
Top metallurgist

524
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:20,056
Your gun!

525
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:25,259
I had to break the boarders up,

526
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,665
or they would have run away.

527
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:27,923
They're scared.

528
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,619
Maybe they're
trying to bluff us.

529
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:32,431
Let's find out, hum?

530
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:41,790
Uh, tell your boss...

531
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:48,431
Comrade

532
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,784
Tell your boss we know you're here
on the same mission that we are.

533
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:07,282
We know you entered the
country without permission.

534
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:10,548
And that you're just as afraid
of the Chinese Reds as we are.

535
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,306
If not,

536
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:28,548
Why are you
escorted by peasants

537
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:30,224
instead of Chinese soldiers?

538
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:43,216
You are very foolish!

539
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:50,479
The Chinese are our allies.

540
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:52,581
And they will exterminate you.

541
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:58,888
We give you last
chance to get away.

542
00:37:11,372 --> 00:37:14,051
You must go back
where you come from.

543
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:25,775
Otherwise, we must

544
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:28,098
notify our Chinese allies,

545
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:29,823
of your presence here.

546
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:36,247
Ask him why he doesn't
notify his Chinese allies

547
00:37:36,248 --> 00:37:37,826
right now?

548
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:15,165
Now then,

549
00:38:15,804 --> 00:38:18,968
shall we forget this
ultimatum nonsense?

550
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:21,607
As much as we both
like to shoot each other,

551
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:23,400
we can't afford the racket.

552
00:38:23,741 --> 00:38:24,694
So...

553
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,764
Where do we go from here?

554
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,619
This is a good place
for a breather.

555
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,667
Alright!

556
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,636
We stop here for a while.

557
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,019
I...uh...

558
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:51,722
I did some research at
Stanford, you know,

559
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:53,026
metallurgy, of course.

560
00:38:53,027 --> 00:38:53,869
Oh...

561
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,092
Was professor Wilhous
still teaching there?

562
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:57,417
Yes indeed he was.

563
00:38:57,428 --> 00:38:58,776
he was a great professor.

564
00:38:58,777 --> 00:38:59,886
Zagorsky?

565
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:04,261
(Speaking Russian)

566
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:07,823
What did he say?

567
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,604
Well...

568
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:12,203
he wants to

569
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,228
to discuss something with me.

570
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:16,526
Excuse me.

571
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Delightful, fella, really.

572
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:25,628
all charm.

573
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:38,862
I'd love to break up this
little shotgun union.

574
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:41,248
Hey!
There's a man with a good idea.

575
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:41,987
Yes,

576
00:39:41,995 --> 00:39:45,335
Dubovsky was going to take
a shot at us just now.

577
00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:47,529
Well, none of us can do that.

578
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:48,894
Well, uh,

579
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:51,707
how about we strangle each
other with our bear hands?

580
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,426
The important thing is
to get to the saucer.

581
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:58,011
Without drawing a thousand
Chinese reds around our necks.

582
00:39:58,386 --> 00:39:59,551
After that...

583
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:01,121
we play it by ear.

584
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:04,043
I wouldn't mind being
strangled by her.

585
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,752
She's a commy!

586
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,872
Where did you
learn that word?

587
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:03,669
From my father.

588
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,552
He was on the last war.

589
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:08,083
Well, it wasn't really the last.

590
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,928
it was in one
we fought together

591
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:12,755
he came with those
trucks we sent you.

592
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:14,976
Oh, oh!

593
00:41:16,396 --> 00:41:18,500
Without your American trucks,

594
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:20,990
We would never have fallen Stalingrad.

595
00:41:25,558 --> 00:41:26,896
Thank you.

596
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:35,458
I bet you have a great IQ.

597
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:38,185
IQ? What's that?

598
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,138
Brain.

599
00:41:39,452 --> 00:41:40,474
Intelligence.

600
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,812
Oh.

601
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:45,876
An unusual compliment.

602
00:41:46,475 --> 00:41:49,049
Well, I wouldn't dare
make a usual one.

603
00:41:50,353 --> 00:41:52,955
Though I must say what I saw
underneath the waterfall

604
00:41:52,956 --> 00:41:54,290
compares favorably with...

605
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:55,642
it'll be sufficient

606
00:41:56,355 --> 00:41:58,091
See? I told you I could
make a usual one.

607
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,228
What?

608
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:01,154
What are you doing when
you're not taking a shower?

609
00:42:08,714 --> 00:42:10,544
I am an electronics expert.

610
00:42:11,302 --> 00:42:14,754
My specialty is Superretrobeam
feedback determinations.

611
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:16,778
Good for you.

612
00:42:17,256 --> 00:42:20,073
Oh, I know that you Americans

613
00:42:20,074 --> 00:42:22,230
resent women being scientists.

614
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:24,802
In your bourgeois society

615
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:26,542
We're nothing but Haus Fraus

616
00:42:27,886 --> 00:42:30,593
There is true sexual
equality in the Soviet Union

617
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:33,733
Women are not
different from men.

618
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:36,007
Oh, my, that's too bad.

619
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:39,300
Soviet women may
even be soldiers.

620
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:42,808
Well, now you wouldn't
happen to be armed now

621
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:44,378
would you, Sargent Karachev?

622
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:51,574
Are you not going
to search me?

623
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:02,871
Say...

624
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,835
Are you sure Soviet women
are no different then men?

625
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:34,524
That building!

626
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:39,531
The peasants made that roof
to hide it from the air.

627
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,866
I'll stay here with the quarters.

628
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,008
They're afraid to go in.

629
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,061
Mr. Peters

630
00:45:55,091 --> 00:45:56,559
You are in command here

631
00:45:56,577 --> 00:45:57,357
That's right.

632
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,646
So let's not take any
more pictures, shall we?

633
00:46:00,264 --> 00:46:02,364
Comrade Dubovsky proposes

634
00:46:02,365 --> 00:46:04,023
that we agree to share

635
00:46:04,047 --> 00:46:05,217
this great discovery

636
00:46:05,218 --> 00:46:06,330
and work together as a

637
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:08,088
scientific team to exploit it.

638
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:10,064
You wanna work with us?

639
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:12,174
-As a team, huh?
-That's right.

640
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,132
Comrade Dubovsky says that

641
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,034
later we may announce our

642
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:27,060
discoveries to the world, together.

643
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:28,460
now, just a minute.

644
00:46:28,983 --> 00:46:31,272
You tell him I'm concerned about guns,

645
00:46:31,297 --> 00:46:32,546
not communicators.

646
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:44,803
We carry arms only to defend
ourselves against aggression.

647
00:46:44,828 --> 00:46:46,827
Of course.
We know that.

648
00:46:47,124 --> 00:46:50,788
But still, I don't like to see people
working with guns stuck to their hips.

649
00:46:50,952 --> 00:46:52,397
So you tell your boss...

650
00:46:52,558 --> 00:46:55,202
If he's willing for us
to inspect his arsenal,

651
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:57,303
he can inspect ours and
then we can come to

652
00:46:57,304 --> 00:46:58,401
some sort of understanding.

653
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,381
Not inspection.

654
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:08,928
Mr. Peters,

655
00:47:11,405 --> 00:47:13,960
It was I who proposed
we worked as a team.

656
00:47:14,771 --> 00:47:16,022
and I can assure you

657
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:18,936
I have no intention of
working with gun in a hip.

658
00:47:19,327 --> 00:47:21,078
Nor I, for that matter.

659
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,210
What use has come to scientists

660
00:47:29,301 --> 00:47:31,201
We will put our guns away.

661
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:33,279
You put your guns away.

662
00:47:34,342 --> 00:47:36,725
But only each team
leader be armed.

663
00:47:37,514 --> 00:47:39,264
Then we can work as team.

664
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,077
If only you'll trust us.

665
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:46,233
I trust you.

666
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:49,475
Hank

667
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:52,379
We ain't got much
choice in the matter...

668
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,405
Comrade Dubovsky is also
willing to trust you.

669
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:03,327
Well, I don't trust him.

670
00:48:04,596 --> 00:48:06,280
I want everybody to know this.

671
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:07,710
So

672
00:48:08,824 --> 00:48:10,280
let's get to work.

673
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:21,366
Morning, Sam
-Morning.

674
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:26,342
I have lookout at
strategic places.

675
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:30,511
We'll keep a night
and day watch.

676
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:40,435
Let me give you a hand, Fred.

677
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,928
I was there just talking to Sam

678
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:45,256
We've got guided
forces all around.

679
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:47,740
Should be alright.

680
00:48:48,006 --> 00:48:49,514
Now wait a minute

681
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,092
I will take a look
up there and see...

682
00:48:52,124 --> 00:48:53,060
It's heavy now.

683
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:54,211
I wanna take it up there...

684
00:48:54,342 --> 00:48:55,272
Hold it.

685
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:02,069
Pretty close.

686
00:49:11,636 --> 00:49:13,636
You think they got
inside this thing yet?

687
00:49:15,605 --> 00:49:18,575
Look, the entire exterior
surface is completely unbroken.

688
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:23,060
Not a sign of a door, a port, nothing.

689
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:25,725
How do they look out to
see where they're going?

690
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
There has to be a way
to get in this thing.

691
00:49:44,658 --> 00:49:47,252
Here! Maybe using this.

692
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,900
Here!
Feel this.

693
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:53,674
Here is warm.

694
00:49:54,049 --> 00:49:55,192
Here it's cool.

695
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:57,119
The same.
Let's trace it.

696
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,447
Did you find anything?

697
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,369
Could be, we don't know yet.

698
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,049
If this is door,

699
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:04,877
it's the most perfect
fit I have ever seen.

700
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:06,368
If there's a door,

701
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:07,502
how do you think it opens?

702
00:50:07,744 --> 00:50:08,767
Could be like one of those

703
00:50:08,768 --> 00:50:09,939
electric garage doors

704
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:11,814
on some sort of signal.

705
00:50:11,946 --> 00:50:13,337
Says Jack, where is he?

706
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:14,916
He's working on some equations.

707
00:50:15,102 --> 00:50:16,119
I'll go get him.

708
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,346
Jack, you're needed.

709
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:29,041
I heard noise, inside.

710
00:50:31,961 --> 00:50:34,948
No, that's not inside.

711
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:38,221
That's jack's electric razor.

712
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:40,383
No,no, she is right.

713
00:50:40,657 --> 00:50:41,385
Inside.

714
00:50:41,725 --> 00:50:43,323
I hear the noise now, too.

715
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:51,284
Well, fellas, what can I do for ya?

716
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:52,424
What the.....

717
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,548
Why did it stop?

718
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,123
Never mind what made it stop.

719
00:50:58,148 --> 00:50:59,631
Why don't we find what made it open?

720
00:50:59,655 --> 00:51:01,377
Jack, give me your razor.

721
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,569
-What for?
-Just give it to me.

722
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:18,037
This is crazy.

723
00:51:18,156 --> 00:51:18,709
No it isn't.

724
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,914
We just have to hit
the right frequency,

725
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:28,817
What can you see, Fred?

726
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:32,872
Not very much.
It's dark.

727
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:35,622
There's like a tube going up.

728
00:51:36,382 --> 00:51:37,790
and kind of a ladder.

729
00:51:44,966 --> 00:51:46,075
here.

730
00:51:46,794 --> 00:51:48,858
We can...we can climb up on this.

731
00:51:49,614 --> 00:51:50,458
Well,

732
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,645
Who wants to climb up inside?

733
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:00,716
(Speaking Russian)

734
00:52:10,524 --> 00:52:11,836
Comrade Dubovsky feel

735
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,820
there should be both a

736
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:14,648
Russian and an American

737
00:52:14,649 --> 00:52:15,859
to be forced to enter.

738
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:18,061
Now let's not start a
lot of damn protocol.

739
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:22,742
Comrade Dubovsky
insists that

740
00:52:22,743 --> 00:52:25,422
such procedures are part
of our agreement.

741
00:52:25,423 --> 00:52:26,414
All right, all right.

742
00:52:26,415 --> 00:52:27,884
You and Fred go in together, then.

743
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:51,887
You got the razor, Fred?

744
00:52:53,439 --> 00:52:54,668
Right.

745
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:04,160
Easy there.

746
00:53:20,591 --> 00:53:21,719
Hey!

747
00:53:25,052 --> 00:53:26,360
When did he close the door?

748
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:28,520
I didn't hear the razor.

749
00:53:30,098 --> 00:53:31,512
They didn't close it.

750
00:53:31,744 --> 00:53:33,152
But then what did?

751
00:53:35,237 --> 00:53:36,082
Who?

752
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:55,793
Looks like solid metal
from the outside.

753
00:53:57,096 --> 00:53:59,096
From in here,
it's transparent.

754
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:04,777
It must be some kind of plastic!

755
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,348
He can't see us,
but we can see him.

756
00:54:19,275 --> 00:54:20,887
Pretty good visibility.

757
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:22,926
All sides...

758
00:54:26,254 --> 00:54:27,807
Where are the
gravity couches?

759
00:54:28,527 --> 00:54:30,059
How would they strap in?

760
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:33,707
Obviously, they do not.

761
00:54:35,261 --> 00:54:37,879
There can be only
one explanation.

762
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:41,675
Because no amount of strapping down

763
00:54:41,676 --> 00:54:44,347
could come back
intense speed

764
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:45,761
and quick directional changes

765
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:46,856
you have described.

766
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:48,504
And the power!

767
00:54:48,505 --> 00:54:49,887
This craft must...

768
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:53,684
generate its own inner
gravitational field.

769
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,120
That contracts and equalizes

770
00:54:56,121 --> 00:54:57,293
all G-forces.

771
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:00,137
Like the turn on the air.

772
00:55:01,184 --> 00:55:02,449
it's like a draft.

773
00:55:02,668 --> 00:55:05,966
I think it is life support system.

774
00:55:06,363 --> 00:55:08,809
Not unlike those over at Cosmonauts.

775
00:55:09,211 --> 00:55:11,794
I noticed it began the moment we entered.

776
00:55:13,613 --> 00:55:16,769
it must be automatically activated by...

777
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:19,356
 the carbon dioxide we exhale.

778
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,168
Converting the CO2 into Ozone,

779
00:55:22,169 --> 00:55:24,996
 or some other oxygen based gas.

780
00:55:25,066 --> 00:55:26,246
You might be right.

781
00:55:26,629 --> 00:55:27,637
When I was in Washington,

782
00:55:27,645 --> 00:55:29,612
they said they probably
were oxygen breathers.

783
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:31,066
That's why they came on the ship.

784
00:55:31,691 --> 00:55:33,856
Shall we get the others?

785
00:55:34,144 --> 00:55:34,941
Right.

786
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,504
The door is closed.

787
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:44,106
I've to send
this back to the factory.

788
00:55:44,285 --> 00:55:45,707
Shut it off!

789
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:52,865
What?

790
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:57,379
How do you control
level of razor?

791
00:55:57,764 --> 00:56:00,551
We probably activated
gravitational field.

792
00:56:00,996 --> 00:56:03,816
If we cannot
adjust it properly,

793
00:56:03,848 --> 00:56:05,231
We will be squished.

794
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,762
Like bugs!

795
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:10,551
It's creating magnetic force.

796
00:56:10,863 --> 00:56:12,293
Does it look like a panel?

797
00:56:12,586 --> 00:56:14,559
That might control
the gravitational field?

798
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,238
I don't know! I don't know.

799
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,754
Don't say that,
we gotta take a chance.

800
00:56:18,866 --> 00:56:20,866
It had better be a calculated risk.

801
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:23,699
This could be a relay.

802
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:27,285
The kind that opens and
closes electric circuits.

803
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:29,874
I can hardly stand up!

804
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:31,898
What is that button?

805
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:33,922
Of that I am not sure.

806
00:56:33,946 --> 00:56:35,946
I'm only saying it looks a little like it.

807
00:56:36,324 --> 00:56:37,970
Come on, try.

808
00:56:45,062 --> 00:56:46,316
A shot in the dark.

809
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:48,715
We were lucky.

810
00:56:52,629 --> 00:56:54,343
We ought to find out

811
00:56:55,027 --> 00:56:56,368
What regulates

812
00:56:56,392 --> 00:56:57,770
the gravitational field

813
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:01,379
There must be...

814
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,973
There must be similar circuit

815
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:06,191
to open

816
00:57:06,361 --> 00:57:07,809
door and floor.

817
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,578
multiply

818
00:57:11,952 --> 00:57:13,547
would it not be

819
00:57:13,742 --> 00:57:16,391
located somewhere

820
00:57:16,587 --> 00:57:18,164
that you could reach here

821
00:57:18,165 --> 00:57:19,883
while standing near door.

822
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:24,484
What'd you know?

823
00:57:27,422 --> 00:57:29,016
it's a simple electric eye.

824
00:57:29,461 --> 00:57:31,118
How come we didn't see it before?

825
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:00,063
Are you alright?

826
00:58:31,186 --> 00:58:33,053
Got any antibiotics in vitro?

827
00:58:36,063 --> 00:58:38,593
Yeah, yeah,
in my first-aid kit, why?

828
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:40,969
A sick Chinese baby.

829
00:58:44,961 --> 00:58:47,523
None of us would know what to do.
We're not doctors...

830
00:58:47,748 --> 00:58:49,179
Karachev will do it.

831
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:13,874
There is infection in his throat.

832
00:59:13,906 --> 00:59:15,906
he's coughing.

833
00:59:25,406 --> 00:59:27,320
Don't you think you better
read the instructions?

834
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:29,515
I don't think that will be necessary.

835
00:59:35,078 --> 00:59:36,250
Lean over, please.

836
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,277
Look at him now!

837
01:00:09,058 --> 01:00:10,277
He's wonderful.

838
01:00:21,769 --> 01:00:22,433
Sam!

839
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,933
Tell her to bring
baby back immediately

840
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:26,543
if he seems worse.

841
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:50,921
Don't tell me along
will all your...

842
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:53,884
other talents you're a doctor, too?

843
01:00:53,908 --> 01:00:55,218
Oh, no. No.

844
01:00:57,203 --> 01:00:58,359
I wanted to study medicine.

845
01:01:01,198 --> 01:01:03,845
but the year I started school

846
01:01:04,805 --> 01:01:06,265
the quota was unfilled

847
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:08,328
for electronics majors

848
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,375
so

849
01:01:10,007 --> 01:01:11,718
the commissar of education

850
01:01:11,743 --> 01:01:12,940
decided otherwise.

851
01:01:13,773 --> 01:01:15,429
You just did what they told you?

852
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:16,530
of course.

853
01:01:18,635 --> 01:01:21,039
The State must decide these things.

854
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:23,906
Just like that, huh?

855
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:26,666
You got angry with me?

856
01:01:34,696 --> 01:01:36,090
You think he's going to shoot me?

857
01:01:36,886 --> 01:01:40,664
Comrade Dubovsky says there
will be no fraternization.

858
01:01:41,214 --> 01:01:42,394
Oh, yeah?

859
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,775
What do you say?

860
01:01:45,979 --> 01:01:49,472
Conrad Dubovsky is in charge of our nation.

861
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,859
Germany!
Sputnik!

862
01:02:23,714 --> 01:02:25,046
Have you figured it out yet?-huh?

863
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,211
Have you figured it all out?

864
01:02:27,226 --> 01:02:29,250
-Oh,oh, sure, it's very simple.

865
01:02:31,398 --> 01:02:33,312
One thing seems certain.

866
01:02:33,778 --> 01:02:35,778
This craft is repelled

867
01:02:35,802 --> 01:02:37,086
on concocted

868
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:40,419
by universal lines of magnetic force.

869
01:02:40,945 --> 01:02:42,336
That's simple, isn't it?

870
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,046
Oh, yes, it is very, very simple.

871
01:02:44,304 --> 01:02:45,789
The only problem is, so am I.

872
01:02:46,828 --> 01:02:49,523
Well, fred, what Anna
means is for example,

873
01:02:49,953 --> 01:02:51,132
If it wants to go up,

874
01:02:51,523 --> 01:02:53,750
It fastens on to the
magnetic attraction of...

875
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:54,867
say, the sun.

876
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,289
If the sun is at its Zenith or

877
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:57,539
any other star that is in

878
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,613
that position of the heavens

879
01:02:58,614 --> 01:02:59,598
at that time of the day.

880
01:02:59,751 --> 01:03:01,039
Now to go down it

881
01:03:01,098 --> 01:03:03,510
just utilizes the earth's magnetism.
That's all.

882
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,690
What about horizontal flight?

883
01:03:06,285 --> 01:03:08,814
Then it just beams on
the magnetic attraction of....

884
01:03:08,838 --> 01:03:10,575
any star or planet that's

885
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,088
on or near the horizon.

886
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,603
Believe me, there are billions

887
01:03:13,628 --> 01:03:15,262
of possible anti magnetism.

888
01:03:15,987 --> 01:03:17,281
Then why wouldn't it pull this

889
01:03:17,306 --> 01:03:18,441
ship from every
direction at once?

890
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:22,168
Oh, that is secret over circuitry.

891
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,176
These controls

892
01:03:24,394 --> 01:03:26,977
properly adjusted, block out

893
01:03:27,002 --> 01:03:28,862
all magnetic attractions

894
01:03:28,886 --> 01:03:32,107
except if one pilot wishes to utilize.

895
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,881
And this craft is aimed by magnetism

896
01:03:35,082 --> 01:03:36,271
and that's all.

897
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:37,139
All?

898
01:03:37,654 --> 01:03:40,084
If we could utilize this principle,

899
01:03:40,475 --> 01:03:42,365
we could exploit literally

900
01:03:42,366 --> 01:03:44,378
limitless fields of energy.

901
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:46,754
We could irrigate deserts.

902
01:03:47,037 --> 01:03:48,778
desalt oceans,

903
01:03:48,802 --> 01:03:50,678
increase production of food,

904
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:53,264
of everything, one-hundred fold

905
01:03:53,482 --> 01:03:54,887
We could also manufacture

906
01:03:54,912 --> 01:03:56,334
one hell of a super weapon.

907
01:03:56,857 --> 01:03:59,004
What would the world want with weapons

908
01:03:59,271 --> 01:04:01,668
if every country was rich and prosperous?

909
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:04,123
True, Dave.

910
01:04:04,443 --> 01:04:06,185
What do you say we
break for chow, huh?

911
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:07,928
-Chow?
-Chow.

912
01:04:08,827 --> 01:04:10,529
Chow is dog.

913
01:04:14,757 --> 01:04:16,490
May I proceed you, madam?

914
01:04:17,975 --> 01:04:19,267
If you want to eat a dog for

915
01:04:19,292 --> 01:04:20,234
lunch, then be my guest.

916
01:04:20,258 --> 01:04:22,258
Oh, that's funny.

917
01:04:32,226 --> 01:04:33,464
There we are.

918
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,336
What happened?

919
01:04:45,516 --> 01:04:48,211
Oh I tripped and Chet
tried to save me.

920
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,656
Oh, no. I just tripped
over my own feet.

921
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:55,217
It's broken.

922
01:04:55,241 --> 01:04:56,547
Christ.

923
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,232
Hey!

924
01:06:05,488 --> 01:06:06,653
Sounds like

925
01:06:08,082 --> 01:06:08,996
someone

926
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:13,106
Or something is trying to fly it.

927
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,651
What the devil's going on here?

928
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:33,854
What? What he say?

929
01:06:34,044 --> 01:06:35,854
That someone is trying to fly it.

930
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:37,125
I knew we should trust

931
01:06:37,149 --> 01:06:38,651
you! get out of there!

932
01:06:39,457 --> 01:06:40,573
Take it easy.

933
01:06:46,004 --> 01:06:47,581
What's the matter with you?

934
01:06:47,582 --> 01:06:50,011
His teeth hurt.
He has steel cups.

935
01:07:39,197 --> 01:07:40,166
Andre!

936
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:41,916
Andre!

937
01:08:10,552 --> 01:08:13,420
Come on. They don't want
us at a time like this.

938
01:08:14,096 --> 01:08:15,443
You go ahead, Dave.

939
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:17,467
I'll be along a little while.

940
01:09:10,616 --> 01:09:12,299
Will you pray for him with me?

941
01:09:43,928 --> 01:09:45,928
I'm not such a
perfect martyr.

942
01:10:04,918 --> 01:10:06,269
Why do you think he did it?

943
01:10:08,728 --> 01:10:10,167
I do not know.

944
01:10:13,783 --> 01:10:16,456
But I think he would
not have done it...

945
01:10:17,549 --> 01:10:20,050
unless Comrade Dubovsky ordered him.

946
01:10:28,496 --> 01:10:30,496
You have no pilot.

947
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:38,051
I've got a flight engineer
with a broken wrist.

948
01:10:40,707 --> 01:10:42,277
Why don't you and I work together?

949
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,032
I would have to ask permission.

950
01:10:53,665 --> 01:10:55,175
From Comrade Dubovsky.

951
01:11:13,925 --> 01:11:15,043
No.

952
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,761
You forget we're not here to
share knowledge with them.

953
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,620
Forgiving them or not

954
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,191
Impossible.

955
01:11:21,519 --> 01:11:24,683
A monopoly that would make our
military opposition invincible.

956
01:11:25,284 --> 01:11:27,496
Now why can't you attempt
to take off with Jack?

957
01:11:28,074 --> 01:11:29,531
Hank, believe me those controls are

958
01:11:29,548 --> 01:11:30,846
too much for a one-handed man

959
01:11:30,847 --> 01:11:32,066
I could kill us all.

960
01:11:32,082 --> 01:11:33,503
You saw what happened to Gadyakoff

961
01:11:33,504 --> 01:11:34,808
He's right.
I believe he

962
01:11:34,809 --> 01:11:35,761
had his hands so full

963
01:11:35,762 --> 01:11:36,628
That he couldn't monitor the

964
01:11:36,629 --> 01:11:37,995
inner gravitational field

965
01:11:37,996 --> 01:11:39,442
and it built up and crushed him.

966
01:11:39,443 --> 01:11:40,645
Dave could handle that.

967
01:11:40,646 --> 01:11:42,127
I'm the foggiest old boy.

968
01:11:42,128 --> 01:11:43,714
I'm a metallurgist, remember?

969
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:45,995
You have no choice.

970
01:11:45,996 --> 01:11:47,355
You've got to go with the girl.

971
01:11:50,948 --> 01:11:51,800
Mr. Peters.

972
01:11:52,043 --> 01:11:52,823
yes?

973
01:11:53,277 --> 01:11:55,206
Comrade Dubovsky
accepts proposal

974
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:57,374
made by Comrade
Norwood last night.

975
01:11:58,342 --> 01:11:59,455
That Anna and he

976
01:11:59,557 --> 01:12:00,941
been blipped off together.

977
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:03,786
Sure! Without a pilot
he's got no alternative.

978
01:12:05,777 --> 01:12:07,060
Neither do we.

979
01:12:07,653 --> 01:12:10,003
Hank, if they're willing,
why shouldn't we be?

980
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,565
Alright!

981
01:12:13,589 --> 01:12:14,605
Let's get on with it.

982
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:26,753
(Speaking in Russian)

983
01:12:32,339 --> 01:12:33,433
Good luck, Fred.

984
01:12:33,573 --> 01:12:35,753
And don't try any more
than just a short liftoff.

985
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:38,327
I wasn't planning any acrobatics.

986
01:13:43,739 --> 01:13:45,300
Wow! hey!

987
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:50,058
Oh, Fred...Fred.

988
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:56,230
Come on, take it easy.

989
01:14:27,397 --> 01:14:29,653
Now that we are united

990
01:14:29,654 --> 01:14:32,348
in this Russian-American project,

991
01:14:32,591 --> 01:14:33,918
Guns are not

992
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:35,980
longer necessary.

993
01:15:06,445 --> 01:15:07,461
Something wrong, Sam?

994
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,320
Red patrols in the area have
been very heavy this morning.

995
01:15:10,968 --> 01:15:12,125
More so than usual?

996
01:15:12,126 --> 01:15:13,030
Yes.

997
01:15:19,133 --> 01:15:20,822
They've become aware of a kind of

998
01:15:20,847 --> 01:15:22,515
suppressed excitement
in the village.

999
01:15:22,703 --> 01:15:24,398
Their suspicions are aroused.

1000
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:32,328
Could they have heard the
sound of the saucer?

1001
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:35,815
Well, my guards would
have heard it, too.

1002
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:40,226
We better get back out.

1003
01:17:16,578 --> 01:17:18,109
He's good, no?

1004
01:17:21,223 --> 01:17:25,070
(Speaking in Chinese)

1005
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:36,375
You specialists and your
high exorbitant prices.

1006
01:17:48,098 --> 01:17:50,227
This is beautiful place.

1007
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:52,860
You're a beautiful person.

1008
01:18:51,638 --> 01:18:53,602
Zagorsky has translated your

1009
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,478
trusted leader's intentions.

1010
01:18:56,701 --> 01:18:58,701
He says, Fred, that you and Anna...

1011
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:01,545
will fly the saucer to
Moscow or he'll kill us all.

1012
01:19:02,305 --> 01:19:03,701
Tell him he's crazy.

1013
01:19:05,047 --> 01:19:06,352
Antoine.

1014
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:11,859
Your scientific
comrade has explained

1015
01:19:11,885 --> 01:19:13,528
the unbearable
distress him greatly.

1016
01:19:20,711 --> 01:19:21,461
Anna!

1017
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:26,570
Go on over to him.

1018
01:19:27,757 --> 01:19:29,757
-He'll kill you.
-No he will not.

1019
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:00,297
I ought to shoot Petry's head off.

1020
01:20:03,844 --> 01:20:04,850
What's he saying?

1021
01:20:04,999 --> 01:20:06,881
That you tricked him
by hiding pistol.

1022
01:20:07,092 --> 01:20:08,362
Oh, my God, that's

1023
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,974
wonderful coming from you.

1024
01:20:10,107 --> 01:20:11,928
Tell him to protest
to the United Nations.

1025
01:20:11,995 --> 01:20:12,959
Now move.

1026
01:20:24,371 --> 01:20:26,497
He wants to know if you
are going to kill us.

1027
01:20:26,498 --> 01:20:28,691
You're not getting your
information back to Moscow,

1028
01:20:28,692 --> 01:20:29,746
that's for sure.

1029
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:30,902
How do you mean that, Hank?

1030
01:20:30,903 --> 01:20:32,441
We do what we have to do.

1031
01:20:32,442 --> 01:20:34,019
We take 'em out as prisoners.

1032
01:20:34,254 --> 01:20:35,459
Would  affect them practical?

1033
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,730
My god, hank, you're beginning
to sound like Dubovsky.

1034
01:20:37,855 --> 01:20:40,691
If you mean because he's loyal to
his side and I'm loyal to mine

1035
01:20:40,692 --> 01:20:42,582
I mean you keep wanting
to blow each other up.

1036
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,176
Fred, whose side are you on?

1037
01:20:44,177 --> 01:20:45,910
-On the side of survival.

1038
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Who's to gain if we exterminate each other?

1039
01:20:48,118 --> 01:20:50,118
-I'll tell you who's to gain.

1040
01:20:51,418 --> 01:20:52,957
The Red Chinese, that's who.

1041
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:56,207
Your little war has attracted a Red Patrol.

1042
01:20:56,957 --> 01:20:58,754
Keep an eye on that, wild man.

1043
01:21:28,552 --> 01:21:30,552
Looks like they're just reconnoitering.

1044
01:21:35,425 --> 01:21:38,187
I suspect he's radioing for reinforcement.

1045
01:21:39,015 --> 01:21:40,795
There's a whole company in the village.

1046
01:21:40,819 --> 01:21:42,445
How long will it take them to get here?

1047
01:21:42,446 --> 01:21:44,859
Not very long.
It's only a few miles.

1048
01:21:45,687 --> 01:21:48,117
-Keep an eye on them, Sam
-Ok.

1049
01:21:58,305 --> 01:21:59,636
How many?

1050
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:00,523
Only eight.

1051
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:02,781
But it looks like they're
radioing for reinforcements.

1052
01:22:10,253 --> 01:22:11,609
He said you destroy saucer

1053
01:22:11,615 --> 01:22:12,831
to keep from Chinese.

1054
01:22:13,148 --> 01:22:14,100
Tell him to shut up and

1055
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:15,316
stay in his own corner.

1056
01:22:16,203 --> 01:22:16,945
He's right.

1057
01:22:17,008 --> 01:22:19,781
-The problem in you two is...
-Dubovsky, just shut up.

1058
01:22:20,952 --> 01:22:22,989
He's one of the greatest
physicists of the world.

1059
01:22:23,015 --> 01:22:24,095
He just wants to help us.

1060
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:25,242
-We don't need him

1061
01:22:25,515 --> 01:22:26,934
-The hell we don't!

1062
01:22:27,164 --> 01:22:28,913
Hank, we all need each other.

1063
01:22:28,937 --> 01:22:30,343
You saw what just happened.

1064
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:32,374
But Zagorsky and Anna had no part of it.

1065
01:22:32,437 --> 01:22:33,765
It's what I was about to say

1066
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:35,460
problem

1067
01:22:35,461 --> 01:22:38,054
is that saucer is
practically indestructible.

1068
01:22:38,567 --> 01:22:39,835
I concur.

1069
01:22:39,836 --> 01:22:41,390
It would take extreme heat

1070
01:22:41,671 --> 01:22:44,070
something like a hydrogen explosion...

1071
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:45,906
for instance, to...to melt that metal.

1072
01:22:46,163 --> 01:22:47,968
But this is the worst of the gear.

1073
01:22:47,976 --> 01:22:49,929
We can't just leave it to the Chinese Reds.

1074
01:22:49,938 --> 01:22:52,023
We are in complete accord on that.

1075
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:54,170
Perhaps we do not have to leave it.

1076
01:22:57,576 --> 01:22:59,390
-What do you mean?
-Fly it.

1077
01:23:00,702 --> 01:23:01,671
Fly it...

1078
01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:04,101
Can you?

1079
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,500
We had it off the ground before.

1080
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:09,202
It's too intricate.

1081
01:23:09,436 --> 01:23:10,976
There are a thousand things in there.

1082
01:23:11,329 --> 01:23:13,468
I have this.

1083
01:23:14,054 --> 01:23:14,921
Chuck.

1084
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:17,179
Please check my figures.

1085
01:23:26,738 --> 01:23:28,519
This is an analysis of
the workings of the

1086
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,712
controls based on
mathematical probabilities.

1087
01:23:30,736 --> 01:23:32,620
Do you think my
calculations are correct?

1088
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,799
We can't tell without
testing them, Anna, but...

1089
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:35,987
Well then, get going.

1090
01:23:35,988 --> 01:23:36,927
The rest of us will see

1091
01:23:36,952 --> 01:23:38,308
you airborne and then
try to get out of here.

1092
01:23:38,309 --> 01:23:39,268
If we get airborne.

1093
01:23:39,269 --> 01:23:40,394
-Oh, now look it isn't
that simple.

1094
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:41,847
All of this has to be checked out.

1095
01:23:42,542 --> 01:23:44,422
I say it will take us about a
half hour to run through it.

1096
01:23:44,628 --> 01:23:46,011
Dave, give us a hand out there.

1097
01:23:46,243 --> 01:23:48,297
Anna, come on, I'll give
you all the help I can.

1098
01:23:56,562 --> 01:23:57,538
What's going on here?

1099
01:23:57,539 --> 01:23:58,812
He told her to fly to Moscow.

1100
01:23:58,813 --> 01:23:59,413
Fred,

1101
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:02,249
you're going to fly to the nearest
American airbase, Formosa.

1102
01:24:02,811 --> 01:24:04,769
They're coming,
a whole company of them.

1103
01:24:05,851 --> 01:24:07,218
We got to get out
there and stop them.

1104
01:24:07,732 --> 01:24:09,093
For at least
thirty minutes.

1105
01:24:26,143 --> 01:24:26,744
Hank!

1106
01:24:28,713 --> 01:24:30,986
Hank, Jack has to stay with the saucer.

1107
01:24:30,987 --> 01:24:32,549
-and so do you.
-that's my point.

1108
01:24:32,557 --> 01:24:34,337
You need Zagorsky and Dubovsky.

1109
01:24:34,338 --> 01:24:37,861
Eagle and inferno,
jointing  forces to destroy dragon.

1110
01:24:38,525 --> 01:24:40,764
Prediction made by friend stargazer

1111
01:24:40,788 --> 01:24:42,588
who live 400 years ago.

1112
01:24:42,589 --> 01:24:43,799
Nostradamus.

1113
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,809
They're against the Red Chinese

1114
01:24:45,834 --> 01:24:47,400
getting the saucer
as much as we are.

1115
01:25:28,684 --> 01:25:30,973
Keep down and don't fight
till I give the word.

1116
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:50,070
Damn it, Dubovsky! I said to wait.

1117
01:26:12,699 --> 01:26:14,066
Ready to get in range.

1118
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:16,910
Now!

1119
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:42,781
Oh, yes, you're good at shot.

1120
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:44,898
Ok, you're a bear cat on wheels.

1121
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:46,070
Stalingrad!

1122
01:26:46,171 --> 01:26:48,030
And bunker hill to you, buddy.

1123
01:26:48,187 --> 01:26:49,654
On the next time,
don't fight until

1124
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,108
you see the white
in their eyes.

1125
01:26:51,109 --> 01:26:52,195
Waterloo!

1126
01:26:52,635 --> 01:26:53,610
That's I hope!

1127
01:26:53,687 --> 01:26:56,461
Remarkable,
We got to stop them.

1128
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:57,453
Yeah.

1129
01:26:58,264 --> 01:27:00,288
Only now they know our
position and strength.

1130
01:27:00,672 --> 01:27:02,312
It won't be so
easy next time.

1131
01:27:02,773 --> 01:27:04,421
I've run out of grenades,

1132
01:27:04,422 --> 01:27:05,417
sir, can you spare any?

1133
01:27:07,523 --> 01:27:08,586
I've only got two.

1134
01:27:08,587 --> 01:27:10,038
But there more back at the church.

1135
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:11,116
Oh, I'll go back and get some.

1136
01:27:11,141 --> 01:27:11,578
No.

1137
01:27:12,054 --> 01:27:12,766
Let me...

1138
01:27:13,437 --> 01:27:16,094
I'm a police officer.
Alright, but keep down.

1139
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:24,766
He's hit!

1140
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:28,968
All set.

1141
01:27:29,773 --> 01:27:30,461
Eight.

1142
01:27:31,017 --> 01:27:31,930
Eight-Six

1143
01:27:34,195 --> 01:27:34,883
Four.

1144
01:27:46,993 --> 01:27:47,687
Zagorsky.

1145
01:27:48,286 --> 01:27:50,285
We stopped them, comrade.

1146
01:27:51,789 --> 01:27:53,383
Bomb. Grenades.

1147
01:27:54,704 --> 01:27:55,914
Grenades.

1148
01:28:32,637 --> 01:28:34,012
Damn it, Fred, what are you doing here?

1149
01:28:34,013 --> 01:28:36,412
You need these, don't you?
-The hell with those!

1150
01:28:36,413 --> 01:28:38,660
What good are they if they
don't apply that thing now?

1151
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:40,293
You're not expendable here.

1152
01:28:47,423 --> 01:28:50,473
Yeah, they're coming at us from
both the front and right flank.

1153
01:28:50,835 --> 01:28:52,426
it'll be hard stopping them, mister.

1154
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:53,247
Hank,

1155
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:55,277
we're set to
take off on your yell.

1156
01:28:55,278 --> 01:28:57,394
Then you fall back as fast
as you can and join us.

1157
01:28:57,672 --> 01:28:58,780
If we can.

1158
01:28:59,331 --> 01:29:00,262
Look that way.

1159
01:29:00,611 --> 01:29:02,290
Get going, but keep low.

1160
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:20,492
Hey.

1161
01:29:23,461 --> 01:29:25,437
You and Sam crawl out
on the right plank.

1162
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:27,516
If you can surprise them,

1163
01:29:27,517 --> 01:29:29,039
You might stop those guys.

1164
01:29:29,604 --> 01:29:30,961
We'll give it a go, old boy.

1165
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:34,516
You're a jolly optimist.

1166
01:29:36,177 --> 01:29:37,101
Luck!

1167
01:29:38,481 --> 01:29:39,320
Cheers.

1168
01:30:07,461 --> 01:30:09,461
How much longer?
-Not too long.

1169
01:30:10,093 --> 01:30:11,866
Right circuit's
eighty and twenty.

1170
01:31:20,911 --> 01:31:21,653
Listen.

1171
01:31:24,797 --> 01:31:26,256
Shooting stopped.

1172
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:30,770
You're right.

1173
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:57,344
Alright.
Lets get out of here.

1174
01:31:57,825 --> 01:31:58,516
Dave?

1175
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:00,664
Everybody.

1176
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:06,141
Come on.

1177
01:32:45,172 --> 01:32:46,688
Reset for horizontal flight.

1178
01:32:51,635 --> 01:32:53,696
-Ready Jack?
-Ready

1179
01:32:53,697 --> 01:32:54,836
Now!

1180
01:33:02,729 --> 01:33:04,487
We've taken off like a rocket.

1181
01:33:04,582 --> 01:33:05,856
and straight up.

1182
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:07,271
Level off, Fred.

1183
01:33:16,989 --> 01:33:18,082
Something we've done

1184
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:19,629
has put us on automatic pilot.

1185
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:21,621
The ship is running away with us.

1186
01:33:25,393 --> 01:33:26,746
Reset to hover.

1187
01:33:31,902 --> 01:33:34,038
-Ready?
-Ready.-Now.

1188
01:33:39,219 --> 01:33:40,289
Nothing.

1189
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:42,375
It does not respond as before.

1190
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:48,008
My God!

1191
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:00,795
Just these few moments
we've torn free of Earth’s

1192
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:02,570
gravity and traveled
thousands of miles.

1193
01:34:03,983 --> 01:34:04,930
Look!

1194
01:34:05,594 --> 01:34:06,828
The moon!

1195
01:34:07,407 --> 01:34:10,054
How could we have come so
far in such a short time?

1196
01:34:12,249 --> 01:34:13,390
The spaceship!

1197
01:34:14,009 --> 01:34:16,851
Is approaching speed of light!

1198
01:34:18,593 --> 01:34:20,773
Over 11,000,000 miles per minute.

1199
01:34:34,405 --> 01:34:35,515
The automatic pilot.

1200
01:34:35,758 --> 01:34:37,758
Still locked to a pre-set course.

1201
01:34:38,085 --> 01:34:39,853
Maybe drawn to some
magnetic attraction.

1202
01:34:39,868 --> 01:34:41,608
Mars, Jupiter, Uranus...

1203
01:34:41,617 --> 01:34:44,421
Maybe some distant star, many
light years beyond our solar system.

1204
01:34:45,022 --> 01:34:48,015
There is a whole bound of systems
here we know little about.

1205
01:34:48,268 --> 01:34:49,429
Thousands of them!

1206
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:51,827
An infinite variety of combinations.

1207
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:55,390
and only one should
reactivate manual control.

1208
01:34:56,022 --> 01:34:58,624
And of which all we can do is try
each one and that could take weeks.

1209
01:34:59,554 --> 01:35:01,321
if we are heading for stars

1210
01:35:02,249 --> 01:35:04,093
the nearest one, Alpha Centaur,

1211
01:35:04,094 --> 01:35:06,632
even on that speed, will take
us forty years to get there.

1212
01:35:07,758 --> 01:35:09,686
If we are heading for planet,

1213
01:35:09,687 --> 01:35:11,687
our solar system,

1214
01:35:11,937 --> 01:35:14,014
and it will crash into it very soon.

1215
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:16,890
If it is an outer planet,

1216
01:35:17,318 --> 01:35:20,209
Pluto, Uranus, we still have a few hours.

1217
01:35:21,373 --> 01:35:22,584
But if it's Mars,

1218
01:35:25,068 --> 01:35:26,264
Our time's already up.

1219
01:35:27,284 --> 01:35:28,490
It's not Mars.

1220
01:35:32,052 --> 01:35:33,566
The Red Planet!

1221
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:39,087
We'll bypass it by a million miles or so.

1222
01:35:45,358 --> 01:35:46,350
Anna.

1223
01:35:47,782 --> 01:35:48,850
I'm going to start
running through those

1224
01:35:48,851 --> 01:35:50,921
circuit combinations
by trial and error.

1225
01:35:50,952 --> 01:35:52,431
it would take too long!

1226
01:35:52,462 --> 01:35:53,854
Not if you can
eliminate some of

1227
01:35:53,872 --> 01:35:55,306
the permutations
mathematically.

1228
01:35:56,017 --> 01:35:57,795
if only we had computer.

1229
01:35:59,068 --> 01:36:00,408
-I will try
-Good.

1230
01:36:00,936 --> 01:36:01,529
In the meantime,

1231
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:03,592
I'll run as many
combinations as possible.

1232
01:36:28,769 --> 01:36:29,164
Jack

1233
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:32,238
Check the inner gravitational field.

1234
01:36:55,277 --> 01:36:56,469
Thank you.

1235
01:37:40,383 --> 01:37:41,187
Jack...

1236
01:37:49,189 --> 01:37:50,336
Saturn.

1237
01:37:52,298 --> 01:37:54,742
I've been observing it for
the past ten minutes.

1238
01:37:55,864 --> 01:37:57,864
We're in a dead collision course.

1239
01:37:58,316 --> 01:37:59,094
Not collision.

1240
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:02,054
The waves of Saturn's
atmosphere are so immense...

1241
01:38:02,078 --> 01:38:04,172
that long before we hit anything solid...

1242
01:38:04,742 --> 01:38:06,077
this ship will be crushed and

1243
01:38:06,078 --> 01:38:07,822
compressed to the
size of a baseball.

1244
01:38:08,778 --> 01:38:10,227
Afraid our time's run out.

1245
01:38:14,447 --> 01:38:15,172
Anna.

1246
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,164
It will collide?

1247
01:38:23,605 --> 01:38:24,687
Yes.

1248
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:30,156
I have reduced
problem to four circuits.

1249
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:32,766
Numbers 4, 16, 22 and 51

1250
01:38:32,767 --> 01:38:34,258
but they must be activated

1251
01:38:34,259 --> 01:38:34,945
in proper sequence

1252
01:38:34,969 --> 01:38:36,703
But I do not know which sequence.

1253
01:38:36,727 --> 01:38:38,492
There are 24 different possibilities.

1254
01:38:38,493 --> 01:38:39,952
Let's try all of them.

1255
01:38:40,054 --> 01:38:42,054
They must work systematically

1256
01:38:42,562 --> 01:38:44,258
Sequence one: open circuits

1257
01:38:44,282 --> 01:38:46,282
4, 16, 22, 51

1258
01:38:46,306 --> 01:38:47,563
In that order.

1259
01:38:47,587 --> 01:38:49,852
4...16...22...51

1260
01:38:57,422 --> 01:38:58,586
All circuits closed!

1261
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,250
4...16....51...22

1262
01:39:04,650 --> 01:39:06,453
4...51..22...16

1263
01:39:10,496 --> 01:39:11,644
We'll never make it.

1264
01:39:12,218 --> 01:39:13,215
Keep going!

1265
01:39:13,888 --> 01:39:15,888
16...22...4...51...

1266
01:39:22,677 --> 01:39:24,677
16...22..51...4...

1267
01:39:31,676 --> 01:39:32,957
We're back on manual.

1268
01:39:33,862 --> 01:39:35,160
My god, we've done it.

1269
01:40:04,797 --> 01:40:06,461
We'll be hinting the atmosphere
in just a few seconds.

1270
01:40:06,462 --> 01:40:09,246
I don't know how much heat
this craft will stand.

1271
01:40:11,687 --> 01:40:13,062
Better start decelerating.

1272
01:40:13,098 --> 01:40:13,995
On it.

1273
01:40:16,641 --> 01:40:17,422
Ready?

1274
01:40:17,731 --> 01:40:18,500
Ready.

1275
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:20,219
Now.

1276
01:40:23,947 --> 01:40:25,947
Something dropped. We're losing power.

1277
01:40:28,166 --> 01:40:30,166
We should lose power, shouldn't we?

1278
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:31,926
Not like this.

1279
01:40:32,214 --> 01:40:34,082
Recheck those circuits, quick!
-Right

1280
01:40:55,721 --> 01:40:56,911
We're burning up!

1281
01:40:56,935 --> 01:40:58,142
We have to decelerate.

1282
01:40:58,716 --> 01:40:59,963
hit the power

1283
01:41:54,962 --> 01:41:56,083
Feeling better?

1284
01:41:58,572 --> 01:41:59,524
Where are we?

1285
01:42:00,196 --> 01:42:01,485
In the Swiss Alps.

1286
01:42:07,396 --> 01:42:10,349
Fred and I were thinking We'd like
to try for landing in Geneva.

1287
01:42:10,713 --> 01:42:12,713
Both our countries
have embassies there...

1288
01:42:12,987 --> 01:42:14,755
and it can be put on record
that we did this together.

1289
01:42:14,918 --> 01:42:17,129
That is, if it's agreeable to you
-Yes, yes.

1290
01:42:21,254 --> 01:42:22,950
You know, when
the world sees this ship

1291
01:42:23,935 --> 01:42:25,485
Everybody is going to
have to realize there

1292
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:27,146
are other intelligent
beings in the universe.

1293
01:42:28,907 --> 01:42:31,067
And we'll have to meet
them face to face one day.

1294
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:35,143
All the nations of this earth

1295
01:42:35,168 --> 01:42:36,699
better be ready to
stand together.

1296
01:42:39,871 --> 01:42:40,802
Amen.

1297
