00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,985
Jordan is asleep

2
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:22,424
But I'm bored, so let's wake her up
and see what happens.

3
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,160
- Hey.
- Mmm

4
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,794
Jordan? Jordan?

5
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,833
Hey.

6
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,501
- What?
- Good morning

7
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,977
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

8
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,570
Hey.

9
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,546
- What?
- C'mere. Give Daddy a kiss

10
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,413
- Seriously?!
- Give Daddy--

11
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,884
What? Give Daddy a kiss

12
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,319
It's not even on.
Give Daddy a kiss

13
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,219
Then why is it in the bedroom?

14
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,451
Um, you know, it's just--

15
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,653
- Just to add effect?
- Yeah, exactly.

16
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,093
- Hmm-mm.
- Give me a kiss

17
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,462
- You in the mood?
- No, I'm not in the mood

18
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,062
Yeah, I'm really in the mood now,
now that you've woken me up.

19
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,971
Listen...

20
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138
Hey hey

21
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,548
- C'mon.
- Are you serious?

22
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,450
- Yeah.
- Are you for reals right now?

23
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,614
Yes.

24
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,657
The people need to know

25
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,057
C'mon.

26
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,992
- Give me a kiss
- I don't want to.

27
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,586
You'll want to in, like, a second

28
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,155
No, I won't!
You have bad breath.

29
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,495
And do I? I do

30
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,297
Last-- oh God

31
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,602
<i>Last chance</i>

32
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,234
- So your hand doesn't work?
- Oh wow.

33
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,279
That's-- okay, well

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,286
Tomorrow is another day

35
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,493
Okay

36
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,099
Um... ahem.

37
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,330
I've been thinking about this
a long time and...

38
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,842
I don't know.
I'm pretty sure that this is--

39
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,935
but I'm just--
I'm really nervous today

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,877
I think--

41
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,347
I think it's gonna go well

42
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,442
Um, this video's for you,
Mom, Dad.

43
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,188
Mark, Karen,
it's your daughter

44
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,854
Lovely lovely lady and I just--

45
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,025
This moment's going
to change my life, so..

46
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,396
Yeah, let's do it

47
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,828
- We did it
- Cool.

48
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,065
And-- I don't know--
I was really nervous,

49
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,403
- and I was really--
- I made a believer out of him

50
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,173
I don't know, I--

51
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,406
I can't wait

52
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,619
It might sound corny, whatever,

53
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,848
but it-- it's true
It's like...

54
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,750
it's a decision that
you make and it's one

55
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:53,355
that makes me really happy
So, Mom, Dad,

56
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,923
I didn't tell you guys about this,
I didn't tell anyone about this,

57
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,935
- and-- did you have any idea?
- No.

58
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,164
- Yeah, I didn't think--
- Surprise! Ba-bam.

59
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,865
But you know what?
We're young.

60
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,299
- We're in love
- In love.

61
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,508
And I don't see any reason not to,

62
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,243
so this is the woman I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

63
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,254
Show 'em the ring

64
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,820
One more time.

65
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,272
What the fuck?

66
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,978
Hello?

67
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,948
Hello?

68
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,824
Oh fuck

69
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,971
Ah-

70
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,568
Fucking Christ, dude

71
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,009
- Oh ohh.
- Oh, fuck

72
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,602
What up?
why are you laying down?

73
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,113
- Oh, fuck.
- What happened?

74
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,116
- What's happened to you, man?
- Jesus Christ.

75
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,981
You're a--
you're an asshole, dude

76
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,912
You're a fucking asshole

77
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,253
- Oh my God.
- You don't mean that

78
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,226
You don't mean that.
How are you feeling?

79
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,660
I-- I'm-- I'm shvitzing.

80
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,788
- I'm-- oh my God
- Want a beer?

81
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,094
- Yes.
- You probably want one

82
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,069
I probably want one.
You probably want one?

83
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,299
Here you go

84
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,738
- why, dude?
- Huh?

85
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,867
- Why?
- Because it's funny

86
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,412
You can't fucking knock
like a normal person?

87
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,709
How's, um, how's married
life treating you?

88
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,511
How's the married--
not married yet.

89
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,142
- Yeah well.
- The engaged life

90
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,312
Oh yeah. It's on the way

91
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,548
it's not bad, dude.
It's the same shit, other than--

92
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,852
you know. I guess there's a--

93
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,290
Win-ifs?
mmm

94
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,259
The no-- the no--
it's been kicking in

95
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,888
It's been three weeks now,
not even a nipple.

96
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,193
Nothing.

97
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,633
It's okay. I still remember--
I have the image in my head

98
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,194
- for days when we used to--
- For sure. Yeah well, that's good

99
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,433
- Well, cheers to memories
- Cheers to those days.

100
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,344
And here she is. Jordan!

101
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,440
Speak of the devil. Jordalini.

102
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,112
- Jordan!
- Oh hey, did Jordan and Steph

103
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,019
tell you what they were planning?
Anything?

104
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,080
No, she just told me that
they're fucking planning.

105
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,420
She didn't talk to you
about it either?

106
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,755
No, she didn't tell me shit

107
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,625
They told me
they're planning something

108
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,290
It's gonna be a huge huge surprise
when they walk in.

109
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,356
I keep thinking we should
have just downplayed it,

110
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,766
because I don't want to be let down
when it's the worst plan ever.

111
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,362
It's gonna be like a movie
It's gonna be a movie.

112
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,236
I'm gonna be like,
Really? It'll be a date?"

113
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,708
And go chocolate tasting.
And we were like, "What?"

114
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,540
- I don't know about that
- Yeah, so--

115
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,477
Jordan!

116
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,743
Okay, now she's fucking funny

117
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,250
She took a cue from you
Let me scare him a little

118
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,116
Jordan!

119
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,950
Hey, come here
for a second, seriously

120
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,617
We've gotta talk
about this surprise.

121
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,626
- That's it
- Jordan.

122
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,161
Where dis foo'?

123
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,495
Jordan?

124
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,399
You're really fucking funny

125
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,304
- Awwww
- Yes.

126
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,570
- That's right.
- Oh, you guys

127
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,134
- Hey!
- Okay, I see

128
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,804
- One-two combo.
- This is cool, this is funny

129
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,678
- This is funny.
- Hey, Aiden, where's Jordan?

130
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,717
I don't want to talk
to either of you right now

131
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,911
- I had a question
- That's a lie.

132
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,817
- I'm actually upset
- I think you're not.

133
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,753
- You're not upset.
- Look at me. That's my mad face

134
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,189
- Look at me
- I'm sorry.

135
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,318
Really? So you're gonna
have her pop out?

136
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,793
- Ohh!
- Hey.

137
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,989
What-- okay.
ls-- is she hiding?

138
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,363
- Is she about to pop out too or what?
- Are you hiding?

139
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,594
I don't know where she is
Is she at work?

140
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,634
- No

141
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:51,756
Party on

142
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,792
Party on

143
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,304
Woman versus machine--
woman prevails.

144
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,466
Hey, lookit.
This is like haunted Hollywood

145
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,532
- Okay. All righty
- Um...

146
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,670
basically it's really all the stories

147
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,906
that are haunted

148
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,949
the history behind them--
the haunting.

149
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,075
Screw the history.
We want to know the gore

150
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,516
- The gore?
- The gore.

151
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,281
Okay, what about this site that I found?
Look at this.

152
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,289
- It has all the addresses
- Look at it-- see, a map.

153
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,483
We can just go right there

Awesome. it's still--

158
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,964
I mean, that's really close to us

159
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,402
- That's really close.
- That's right in Beverly Hills

160
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,133
Right down the street, okay?

161
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,540
So that's one. Should I copy
the map onto our webpage?

162
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,942
- Yeah.

Oh my God.
January 15th, 1947, a passerby

166
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,188
spotted her nude body
in a vacant lot near Hollywood.

167
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,882
Her body, cut in half,
was bruised and beaten

168
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,051
Grass had been reportedly
been forced into her vagina

169
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,152
and she had reportedly been
sodomized after death."

170

of TV's Superman George Reeves

175
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,105
supposedly haunts
the Beverly Hills home

176
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,143
where he was found dead
of a gunshot wound."

177
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,610
1579 Benedict Canyon Drive

178
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,113
- Oooh.
- Copy that one

179
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,206
Was he a friendly ghost
or a not-so-friendly ghost?

180
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,114
- Is he like Casper?
- I don't know.

181
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,550
In a Superman suit?

182
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,814
We should go find out

183
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,321
All these are so crazy

184
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,720
isn't that--

185
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,759
what's his name?
--Charles Manson?

186
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,260
Isn't that actually-- that's what
The Strangers" is based off of,

187
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,489
- isn't it?
- Yeah, and then Marilyn Monroe--

188
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,032
- we can go to Roosevelt
- Type the address there.

189
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,535
I feel like the boys are gonna
try to get out of this,

190
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,901
- but they're not going to
- No, it's mandatory.

191
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,236
It's mandatory fun

192
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,207
They got a fucking-
they got a presentation?

193
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,745
Yes, they are going to present us
with a presentation.

194
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,178
- A little pitch?
- Yeah.

195
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,737
Dude, they worked hard
on that shit, dude.

196
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,478
All day, dude.
She didn't even answer her phone?

197
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,417
She was like, "Not now

198
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,887
- Oh, shut up, shut up
- Hey, we gotta-

199
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,787
- hey, chuckle a little bit
- Oh...

200
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,223
- Little bit
- Oh!

201
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,893
- There they are, okay
- Here we are.

202
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,726
All right

203
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,129
- So are you ready?
- I'm ready.

204
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,895
- I'm so ready.
- Let's hear the pitch

205
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,128
- You were born ready?
- Yep.

206
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,728
- No doubt
- The pitch.

207
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,295
- Okay.
- Here it goes?

208
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,204
Um, well, we are going to take you

209
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,641
on a Hollywood haunted tour

210
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,339
- Okay.
- Basically we want to encompass,

211
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,508
like, old Hollywood and what
inspired us to bring us out here

212
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,711
and look at it today

213
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:25,085
- Yeah.
- Like all of the haunted horror stories

214
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,385
- or-- yeah.
- The grittiness, the realness.

215
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,983
Just like all the stuff
that doesn't get talked about

216
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,359
The Black Dahlia,
the Manson cases--

217
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,058
like all those things happened
in our backyard, basically.

218
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,863
And like the old glamour
of Hollywood

219
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,994
and everything that
happened here before

220
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,335
And-- I mean, Marilyn Monroe,

221
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:46,274
and all of these people
and places and their stories?

222
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,310
WSW

223
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,004
Yeah, come on, Daddy, get on board

224
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,979
- I-- I mean--
- Daddy?

225
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,209
- What are--
- Interesting

226
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,377
Okay, we'll begin with number one?

227
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,114
The Black Dahlia

228
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,053
The Black Dahlia murder, of course?

229
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,523
Elizabeth Short was
murdered in a park--

230
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,618
well, not murdered in a park,
but her body was ditched in a park

231
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,061
- "Why so serious?
- Her mouth was slit from--

232
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,292
That's fucking gross

233
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,562
- --from ear to ear and she
- It's my birthday. Yeah.

234
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,968
Was found cut in half
bruised and beaten.

235
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,939
Grass had reportedly been
shoved in her vagina.

236
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,703
Oh, that's-- then we have to go

237
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,268
And then she was sodomized after death.

238
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,837
- Wow.
- And then there's Dorothy Stratten

239
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,783
which is crazy because she was our age
or a little younger even.

240
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,184
She was the 1980's
Playboy" Playmate of the Year--

241
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,153
- Okay
- Hey-

242
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,487
- And she was shot and killed by her.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about

243
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,823
- ...estranged husband.
- Are you guys even listening?

244
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:37,986
- No.
- Yes

245
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,654
You're just looking at her picture
Stop.

246
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,595
It's kind of gross
if you think about it.

247
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,861
It's more about like the stories
behind all the places.

248
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,403
No no, I'm honoring her.
That's why she was a Playmate

249
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,938
- I mean I'm honoring her life
- That was her job--

250
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,372
This is how she would have
wanted me to remember her

251
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,171
Ew. Not like that

252
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,111
Anyway we want to go
to these places 'cause--

253
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,614
- What other houses are there?
- Okay, this is...

254
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,277
- Name off some beats.
- 10881 West Clarkson Road

255
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,718
Los Angeles, California, 90064.

256
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,483
Oh, 99064.

257
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,750
- Beckett.
- Seriously?

258
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,655
- Sorry sorry.
- Okay okay.

259
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,057
Yes, I apologize

260
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:14,825
And she apparently, like,
haunts the "Playboy" offices,

261
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:19,029
like roses-- you can smell roses
when there are no flowers. You can--

262
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,661
- the fax machine will turn on and off
- Yeah.

263
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,967
And, I don't know.
There's all these stories behind them

264
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,564
Gimme something fucking gross

265
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,576
- Gross gruesome?
- Sharon Tate.

266
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,669
- Oh shit.
- Murdered by Charles Manson

267
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,647
- and his followers.
- Charles Manson is a fucking mass--

268
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,548
Before she was murdered,
she had a vision or an experience

269
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:38,145
where she spotted one ghost
who was Paul something-or-other

270
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,156
who was a theatrical agent
at the house.

271
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,159
And when she ran down the stairs
to flee from said ghost,

272
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,821
she encountered herself
at the bottom of the stairs

273
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,923
and she was bloodied and had
like a rope tied around her neck

274
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,060
And coincidentally that is the way
she was found murdered.

275
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,626
- Coincidentally?
- So you're saying

276
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,638
we're just going to go to this house--

277
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,367
I mean, do you even know
if it exists?

278
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:02,105
- They all exist.
- Marilyn's ghost haunts the Roosevelt

279
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,511
- Um, there's a cafe on the--
- It's real!

280
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,072
- We're in there
- There you go

281
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,084
--which is now
a production company that

282
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,553
Thelma Todd's, like, apparation--

283
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,489
- or what is it? --apparition is there
- Apparition.

284
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,220
- She's so cute.
- It's about the realness

285
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,264
It's about the greediness and
the realness and it's in our backyard

286
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,299
and we haven't been
taking advantage of it.

287
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,927
And now instead of going
and paying 70 bucks or 80 bucks a pop

288
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,334
- to go to Hollywood Horror Nights
- I agree.

289
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,134
- It's a good point
- Very good point

290
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:32,334
...so some moron dressed in a Freddy
Krueger outfit can push you around.

291
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,400
You are quite a pussy

292
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,173
Take the camera
It's our turn.

293
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,079
- It's our turn--
- This is clearly a cheap ploy

294
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,948
No, this is our turn
to ask the questions here

295
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,419
So you presumably--

296
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,979
so you have a list of--
this is a list

297
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,686
of houses you have here
and we're gonna drive

298
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,887
to these places-- George Reeves?!

299
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,430
- George Reeves?
- Exactly.

300
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,260
You guys saying you did this for us?

301
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,732
- Yeah.
- Well, yeah

302
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,894
- We did it as us for a group.
- You did spend all day on it

303
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,369
You can't lie.
We do have some--

304
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,702
You guys planned tomorrow,
so we can plan tonight.

305
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:06,436
You know what? We're going to need
a moment to compile all the evidence

306
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,409
And then hopefully we'll

307
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,347
reach a verdict that favors--
that's fucking gross.

308
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:17,012
I mean grass in the vagina, you know?
That's a big selling point.

309
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,883
The jury's come to a verdict

310
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,425
Really? Does the jury care
to spit it out?

311
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,724
Yeah, um, we've decided

312
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,355
upon reviewing all the evidence,

313
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,128
that we've--
we'd really like to go

314
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,660
- We would really like to go.
- Yeah, you guys did an excellent job

315
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,367
And you guys are adorable
and we can't turn that down

316
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,431
The amount of work that went into this--

317
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,909
She's got studs on her sweater

318
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,572
- How cute is that?
- Under one-- listen

319
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,615
- Listen.
- Ooooh

320
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,584
- Under one-- one condition
- One condition?

321
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,983
Uh-oh, they have one condition

322
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,784
If this is fucking lame,
if this sucks...

323
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,416
- It's not going to.
- ...In exchange we get

324
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,085
- Beer!
- ...sexual favors.

325
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,856
- Sexual favors.
- Sexual favors?!

326
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,362
Yes. Agree to it now,
otherwise we're not going

327
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,126
Agree now or we're not doing it
That's it.

328
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,791
I will throw this
right out the window

329
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,529
I will burn these
with the candles

330
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,161
- I will burn them.
- Actually that's probably better?

331
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,070
Because then it wouldn't pollute
You used a lot of paper?

332
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,403
- For this, by the way
- It would pollute.

333
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,204
- It would be air pollution
- Yes, I agree.

334
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,973
- It's not gonna suck, so--
- Ah, that's why I love you!

335
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,709
- Jordan, Jordan.
- I'm sorry, you must move?

336
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,377
Jordan, Jordan!

337
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,317
Do you agree, miss?

338
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,015
- Sorry, baby. Sorry, baby
- Okay okay, I agree.

339
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,183
- Hey, it's on camera
- Yeah, I know.

340
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,318
Oh, can you put it on camera
that Jordan and I

341
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,362
are the best convincers ever

342
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,989
- and you can't deny us?
- You guys are the best convincers ever

343
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,931
- So say it in the camera
- You can't deny us.

344
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,866
Jordan, say it in the camera

345
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,870
Steph, say it in the camera
"if this sucks--"

346
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,428
"if this sucks...
repeat after me

347
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,973
- If this sucks--
- You.

348
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,441
- If this sucks--
- will suck."

349
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,409
Say it.

350
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,174
I will suck

351
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,747
This is called the Wattles Mansion

352
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,343
- The Wattles Mansion
- What a name.

353
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,184
Are you guys ready
for the scare of a lifetime?

354
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,451
Take next right

355
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,653
- I think she is.
- At this next location

356
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,993
A bus stop once stood in front
of the Wattles Mansion,

357
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,694
but has since been relocated
because people had become spooked

358
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,829
at the unexplainable screaming
and mysterious noises

359
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,567
- that come out of the house
- Take next right.

360
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,610
"Some people have even reported
to hear the sounds of galloping horses

361
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,840
- that wisp throughout the night
- Aw, ponies.

362
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,907
At night the grounds become haunted
with the sight of a female apparition."

363
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,385
I sort of think
I'm gonna like this house

364
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,183
Galloping horses?

365
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,384
Unexplainable screaming
and mysterious noises

366
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,121
coming out of this empty
house supposedly.

367
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,595
Can we go stand where
the bus stop once stood

368
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,132
- and wait for the noises to appear?
- Arrive to destination

369
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,929
- in 700 feet.
- Wait. Whoa whoa whoa

370
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,129
- Are we almost there?
- 1324...

371
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,365
- No, we're-- was that 13 or 18?
- 13...

372
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,066
It says "Wattles" right here
It said.

373
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,336
- Really?
- Yeah.

374
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,138
Oh, okay, well then

375
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,907
- Let's go then.
- Wanna go check out Mr. Wattles?

376
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,462
It's so cool.

377
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,728
We probably aren't allowed in here

378
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,135
Well, the gate's open
so it's free game.

379
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,071
- Think the door's open?
- It's pretty-- oooh!

380
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,302
- Oh, okay.
- Do it. Go try it, go try it

381
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,709
Well, I'd try it, but--
let's just try it.

382
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,476
It's probably locked.

383
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,449
It's probably locked.

384
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,548
She's going up.

385
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,556
You want to open it with me?
Here we go. One sec.

386
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,058
Yeah. Wait one sec

387
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,925
- You ring the doorbell.
- I'm not gonna ring the doorbell

388
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,998
- It's locked
- It's locked

389
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,091
Locked out.
Does anybody have a flashlight?

390
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,430
Who has the flashlight?

391
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,936
Why is the flashlight in the trunk?

392
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,562
I don't have the flashlight

393
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,573
Okay.

394
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,877
- Okay, somebody open it.
- Whoever looks inside gets cursed

395
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,313
Oh my God,
they're gonna get arrested

396
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,146
Arrested

397
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,709
Oh my God!

398
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,648
Dude.Dude

399
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,454
What are you even doing?

400
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:20,190
- Oh my God, it's unlocked.
- Oh my God, are you shitting me?

401
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,729
Just open it.
Just open the top

402
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,268
Just do it really quick

403
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,133
Before somebody fucking realizes

404
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,194
Hey, is he gonna do it?
It has been an hour.

405
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,037
Yeah, just fucking do it.
Stop being a pansy-ass bitch

406
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,377
Don't--

407
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,940
I swear to God.
Did you see that?

408
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,212
You're so full of shit

409
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,276
- That--
- Oh my God

410
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,516
- You're so full of shit
- I'm not lying to you.

411
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,353
Oh, no, bullshit.
You would have just like--

412
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,620
- and it went on forever
- It was-- oh my God.

413
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,320
It was like a well or something

414
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,830
Fuck, that was crazy

415
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,888
I'm not--

416
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,663
I don't believe you.
I think you're full of shit

417
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,138
I swear to God, there was
some sort of like sacrificial cross

418
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,072
- or something.
- I couldn't believe it opened

419
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,229
Where--
what's the next house?

420
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,538
Where--
what's the next house?

421
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,909
Next up on our old Hollywood tour

422
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,005
is the Black Dahlia murder site.

423
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,107
- Oh shit, look at that
- Nice.

424
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,812
She was killed in a field, right?

425
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,718
Yeah. It says,
The murder of Elizabeth Short?

426
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,518
Was intrigued and mystified
even disgusted

427
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,526
the city of Los Angeles
for more than half a century

428
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,392
She was killed
on January 15th, 1947

429
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,428
Actually no, I lied.
She was discovered then

430
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,434
She was discovered
by a passerby--

431
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,766
"spotted her nude body
in a vacant lot near Hollywood.

432
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,930
Her body, cut in half,
was bruised and beaten

433
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,736
Grass had been reportedly
been forced into her vagina

434
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,334
and she had reportedly been
sodomized after death."

435
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,541
That's her body cut
in two pieces.

436
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,549
- Oh my God, is that her body?
- And he gave her--

437
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,380
- Let me see.
- He gave her a perma-smile too

438
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,511
He cut her from, like,
ear to ear so she's smiling

439
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,781
- Let's see
- Ugh.

440
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,220
"Even in death..."

441
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,282
"Some say she was named
the Black Dahlia before her murder

442
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,727
in January of 1947. Others say
the name was applied to journalists--

443
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,129
by journalists who
sensationalized the crime

444
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,224
Okay okay, chill chill chill

445
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,269
Let me figure out.
We should be like really close

446
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,032
- Arrived at destination
- Oh wow.

447
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,970
- Oh fuck!
- Seriously?

448
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,770
- Are you kidding me?
- It's one of these two on this side

449
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,539
'Cause that was 3801 .
So let me just pull over here

450
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,475
So it's just two houses down

451
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,210
- Guys, it's right over here
- Oh my God.

452
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,752
This is exact-- this is where
they fucking found her body

453
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,412
There it is

454
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,616
Dude, what the fuck?

455
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,061
- Okay, really?
- Wow, okay, yes

456
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,995
Okay.

457
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,329
Why don't any of them
have mailboxes?

458
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,801
- It's this house.
- Well yeah, it looks creepy too

459
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,065
- The desolate look
- Oh my God.

460
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,697
- This junk--
- I think this is where they found her

461
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:44,763
It was right here

462
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,674
- Yeah sure.
- No, I'm serious

463
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,735
You're so full of shit

464
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,008
- I think.
- It's not where they found her

465
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,949
Can you imagine just getting down?

466
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,644
- Oh my God
- Really?

467
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,814
- Oh, look at that
- Come on.

468
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,858
Two halves of a whole
This is just--

469
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,620
- that's just laughing at her now
- No.

470
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,719
Yeah, now you're just mocking
Is this real grass?

471
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,230
That's what I want to know
It's very close cut.

472
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,563
Where are we--
what is this next house?

473
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,626
Okay, the next one is

474
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:19,039
Dorothy Stratten and she
was a "Playboy" Playmate.

475
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,304
- Oh yeah.
- "...promising career was snuffed out

476
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,811
She was barely 20
when her life was taken

477
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,144
by her then-estranged husband
Paul Leslie Snider

478
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,911
- on August 14th, 1980
- That's our age.

479
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,250
"...In his West Los Angeles
apartment on Clarkson Road

480
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,583
a home they once shared

481
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,181
He got pissed because
he made her a Playmate,

482
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,387
and then afterwards
she started falling in love

483
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,227
with a director on one of her
sets called Peter Bogdanovich.

484
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,824
Oh, Peter Bogdanovich
I know this guy.

485
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,029
You know him?

486
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,335
"This enraged Snider,
who was obsessed with Dorothy

487
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,807
and the lifestyle he thought
was owed to him as her husband

488
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,502
Oh fuck!

489
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,842
- By summer 1980--
- Glass bottle.

490
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,108
- What was that?
- Glass bottle.

491
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,911
I think I ran over a glass bottle

492
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,541
Are you sure it was
just the bottle?

493
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,483
- Don't stop.
- It was the Black Dahlia

494
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,785
Maybe. Maybe it was
the second half of her torso

495
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,826
Oh wow, that was too soon
Too soon.

496
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,384
Prepare to turn slightly north

497
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,089
Okay anyway.
By summer 1980

498
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:17,497
the couple had separated. During this
time he carried on his relationship--

499
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,900
she carried on her relationship
with Bogdanovich,

500
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,495
even moving in with him
while Snider plotted his revenge

501
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,337
Snider purchased a shotgun,
talked Dorothy into coming over

502
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,934
to discuss a financial settlement
regarding the divorce.

503
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,411
Then restrained her
in a homemade bondage device,

504
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,075
sexually assaulting her,
and finally putting the gun

505
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,618
to her face and pulling
the trigger, killing her.

506
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:39,053
He sexually assaulted her corpse, then
turned the gun on himself and fired."

507
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,283
Jesus fucking Christ
She's 21 years old.

508
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,326
- It's like-- she's our age
- She's our age.

509
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,487
- Arrive to destination
- Oh my God.

510
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,464
- This is actually kinda creepy
- 1-0-what?

511
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,400
What?
At least the lights are on there

512
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,301
- Well, nobody--
- 1-0--

513
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,840
There's a pattern.
Nobody has numbers.

514
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,536
They don't have fucking numbers
on any of the houses.

515
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,637
I don't think that one was,
because it's too close to the--

516
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,308
All right, let's do this.

517
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,282
You guys.

518
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,388
This is so nuts

519
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,620
- Sure is, man
- Hey hey hey

520
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,026
I want to know what was
in the side yard

521
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,999
Why don't you just
hop in there and find out?

522
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,661
Well, because the light
turned on and then it turned off

523
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,204
so either somebody
turned it on and off or--?

524
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,432
Shh

525
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,805
See?

526
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,240
Shit, what is that?

527
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,005
It's turning itself on and off

528
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,808
It's gonna do it again
and you're totally gonna miss it

529
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,349
- What the fuck?
- Okay no, that's her activating

530
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,385
the thing 'cause you guys
are walking too close.

531
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,750
- But I just walked there.
- Yeah, but that one isn't activating

532
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,618
But I walked there too
and it didn't turn on.

533
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,522
- Towards that one?
- And what? It has a dimmer?

534
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:53,119
- Motion sensors.
- Yeah, but there's no motion sensoring

535
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,630
- at the side of the house.
- It could be a raccoon back there

536
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,429
I'm just being logical
I'm just being logical

537
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,663
You're being skeptical
Look at this bullshit.

538
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,069
- You guys are the ones.
- Mr. Granny-visited-Mom.

539
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,074
You guys are overreacting
It's a light.

540
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,337
- Whoo! No no no!
- Walk around the front

541
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,969
- Oh God.
- Oh Shit!

542
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,014
All right, I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

543
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,015
- Enough is enough.
- Big bugs, big bugs!

544
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,574
- That was enough.
- Should we see the front of the house?

545
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,950
Cockroach

546
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,046
Where are you fucking going?
I'm not-- no.

547
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,591
Oh Shit. Shit

548
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,990
Don't sweat

549
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,758
Oh Shit

550
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:32,165
Fucking bad shit.
Let's get the fuck out of here

551
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,930
- Okay, come on
- Okay.

552
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,733
That truck scared the shit outta me

553
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,705
All right, fuck.
I'm getting outta here

554
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,228
- We're fucking getting outta here
- My heart is beating so fast.

555
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,072
- We're fucking getting outta here
- My heart is beating so fast.

556
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,804
My heart is, like, seriously pounding

557
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,812
- Fuck, me too.
- How funny was the cockroach?

558
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,176
No, that's not even--

559
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,944
Um, okay,
this is the Houdini house

560
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:51,010
And... "On a dark night
around 1918,

561
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,682
a full moon was gazing down
upon the Hollywood Hills.

562
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,453
On a rugged hillside stood
a Gothic castle-like mansion

563
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,460
that had been built several years before

564
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,725
by the wealthy owner of one
of the city's largest furniture stores

565
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,563
And on one of the night--
er, on Halloween

566
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,934
they were having a party
And all of these people

567
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,166
were, like, costumed and going
And his son

568
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:14,005
decided to escape the party
so that he could go up to...

569
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,807
the back balcony so he could
hang out with his lover.

570
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,246
And it was a time when,
obviously, gay men couldn't

571
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,545
- Yeah.
- ...be known

572
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,416
And "They were having
a romantic moment

573
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,752
and then for some reason
an argument ensued.

574
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,757
The orchestra had just
taken an intermission

575
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,292
when a scream filled the air

576
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,794
The heir to the furniture fortune
had pushed his young lover

577
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,127
off the balcony and his body
now lay in a pool of blood?

578
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,598
30 feet below.
There was no question

579
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,159
as to who had killed the man,
but the father nevertheless

580
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,000
hired the best lawyer
that money could buy

581
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,666
In an effort to save his son,
he spent nearly every dime that he had

582
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,367
paying off policemen, prosecutors

583
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,810
and event-- and the event--

584
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,281
he paid off the trial judge himself

585
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,319
Finally it was ruled that
there was insufficient evidence

586
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,650
- to prosecute the furniture heir
- How convenient.

587
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,519
"...and the man
and the family name were saved

588
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,991
But unfortunately the house was
sacrificed to save the son's life.

589
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,496
And this was not the first tragedy-
or this was the first tragedy

590
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,624
to occur that could be connected
to the Gothic mansion,

591
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,293
but it would not be the last

592
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,564
In fact it has been said
that the place is cursed

593
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,765
and that all those who
have occupied the house

594
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,808
were plagued by bad luck
and disaster."

595
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,934
- Okay.
- "In addition to the murder,

596
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,343
other strange events have taken place
here over the years.

597
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,745
Many of those have involved
the man who purchased the house

598
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,283
from the furniture store owner

599
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,682
His name was Harry Houdini
and he lived in the mansion

600
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,915
during his short career with the
fledgling movie industry in the 1920s

601
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,424
That's so cool. "While he lived
in the house and became a frequent

602
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,927
host to séances,
strange experiments and more,

603
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,429
some say this cursed castle
may have finally cost

604
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,092
the famous mag-- magician his life

605
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,465
- That's the word.
- When you're holding séances

606
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,333
Not-- mm-hmm

607
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,930
Well, apparently
the young lovers cast a spell

608
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,703
I wonder if we can see
the balcony where he fell off

609
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,075
Is this the street?

610
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,977
Just let these people pass

611
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,016
Huh? No. That was the street
We passed it.

612
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,641
- Oh.
- I just-- I can't park on Laurel

613
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,447
That would be really stupid

614
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,249
- Okay.
- All right, let's go

615
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,291
- Leave the parking brake on.
- 2398, remember that number

616
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:11,384
What did I do with the--
did I get a light?

617
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,162
Oh Shit

618
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,668
Out of the road!

619
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,035
- Oh shit.
- Book it, book it, book it

620
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,334
Go go go go go.

621
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,341
Oh, dude, look at this.

622
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,745
Holy shit, dude

623
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,253
Wait, how do we get in?
This is-- it's got cameras. Look

624
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,916
Yeah, it definitely has cameras
and it's padlocked.

625
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,721
So it's not gonna happen?

626
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,228
Dude, yeah

627
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,493
'cause after the cameras
I needed the padlock to convince me

628
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,000
Look at the cat, dude.

629
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,536
I know I feel like
it keeps looking at me

630
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,833
- Jesus
- Wow.

631
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,577
Way up this drive,
look at this fucking huge house

632
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,135
This is so massive

633
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,045
I would classify this
as a mansion.

634
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:12,350
- It's freezing out here.
- It's got big fucking spiders on it

635
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,788
I just walked through
a spider web.

636
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,689
You should see what's on the cat

637
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,557
Private property

638
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,222
Right to pass by

639
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,596
permission and subject
to control by owner."

640
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,396
Let's buzz in!

641
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,666
I definitely couldn't live
in one of these houses after

642
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,901
- If it wasn't 11 :25, I'd buzz in.
- ...something happened here

643
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,205
Okay, let's--
what we're gonna do

644
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,473
Are we gonna take
the sidewalk now?

645
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,344
No, we'll cross on that side

646
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,008
so at least we can see
around there.

647
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,177
And then we run across the street
There's a sidewalk.

648
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,653
- But we gotta like be kinda--
- Stealth about it?

649
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,155
--Not-- no, not stealth

650
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,850
EH-ii,

651
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,484
- We don't have to be quiet and fast
- Not stealth, fast!

652
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,927
We can be loud and fast
We just gotta be--

653
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,158
Just wave your arms a lot.

654
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,395
I think, like, everybody should
start running right now.

655
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,595
Oh Shit

656
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,635
Jordan almost got hit
by a fucking car.

657
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,268
I didn't almost get hit by a car.
I wasn't going to run in front of it

658
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:08,398
Okay, George Reeves.
"Los Angeles police..."

659
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,539
Okay, George Reeves.
"Los Angeles police..."

660
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,048
- Who?
- "...arrive at the home

661
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,105
of 45-year-old--

662
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,152
Sorry, what's the address?
Sorry, I didn't mean to--

663
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,017
- 1579 Benedict.
- Okay, so we have to keep going. Sorry

664
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,318
Okay. "1959, Los Angeles police arrive

665
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,121
at the home of 45-year-old actor
George Reeves, famous for his role

666
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,889
- as TV s Superman..."
- Arrive to destination

667
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,260
"...and find him naked and dead
of a gunshot wound to the head.

668
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,925
Ruled as a suicide,
Reeves' death inspires

669
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,730
a series of conspiracy theories?

670
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,929
And the interpretive biopic
'Hollywoodland'

671
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,768
as well as a persistent urban legend

672
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,001
itself famously known
as 'The Superman Curse

673
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,839
The renters revealed that one night
while entertaining guests

674
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,607
in the living room
they heard noises.

675
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,172
The bedroom-- Reeves' bedroom--
previously neat and orderly was a mess

676
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,377
Linens torn off the bed
clothes strewn around

677
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,546
They straightened the room
and returned downstairs

678
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,214
to find that all the drinks
on the coffee tables

679
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,815
had been moved into the kitchen

680
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,156
Another time the couple's
German shepherd barked

681
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,025
- at the bedroom door furiously
- At least he's clean.

682
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,894
Then suddenly cowered and slunk away
as the tenants peeked inside

683
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,332
and discovered the bed
had been moved across the room

684
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,496
The last straw came
around 3:00 a.m. one summer morning

685
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,473
when the apparent ghost of Reeves,
dressed in his TV Superman costume,

686
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,706
appeared in the living room and within
the hour the tenants had moved out."

687
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,692
Is that it?
That's really pretty

688
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,832
- Is that his bedroom?
- Yeah, that's where he shot himself

689
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,029
Holy shit

690
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,868
Wait, there's something--

691
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,137
- Fuck.
- Yeah, well

692
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,975
this was--
this was everybody's idea

693
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,408
- Oh
- So.

694
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,749
- So...
- Are we gonna try to go inside?

695
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,516
That's George Reeves

696
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,784
Okay, we gotta, like,
make up our minds.

697
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,723
Like, are you gonna go or not?

698
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,385
Come on, Steph.
You know what?

699
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,521
Go go.
Because you're so brave

700
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,690
No, you're so brave and you
were calling me a bitch?

701
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,199
- So go. Go
- Oooh!

702
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,928
No, because when
I called you a bitch

703
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,335
- you still didn't do anything about it
- No, go go.

704
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,703
Go. You're calling me out? You're
calling me out on the camera, so go

705
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,003
Come on, tough--
come on, toughness. Let's go

706
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,805
- Let's see what you're made out of
- I got close.

707
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,868
You got close?
You got close?

708
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,041
- You gonna follow me with the camera?
- What, did you walk over here?

709
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,450
Did you walk over here?
Did you walk here?

710
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,681
- Did you walk here?
- Keep going, keep going

711
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,280
Shut up.
I don't feel like it

712
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,987
All right?
So shut your fucking face!

713
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,894
- Oh shit.
- You can call me tough boy

714
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,399
That's what Reeves said
right before he died.

715
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,059
He said, Shut your fucking face

716
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,831
- Yeah.
- And then he blew his head off

717
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,496
And then he blew his head off

718
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:49,659
I promise you
I'm not leaving the car on this

719
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,641
I promise you
I'm not leaving the car on this

720
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,835
I promise you

721
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,037
No, you have to leave the car

722
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,875
No, I don't have to do anything

723
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:01,508
- I'm a grown-ass man.
- Proceed to destination, 900 feet

724
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,212
900 feet-- don't lie

725
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,150
"Lights in the kitchen
go on and off by themselves,

726
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,955
while out in the living room
people see strange formless light

727
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:15,190
in an outline form floating
above, near the ceiling."

728
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,859
- It's a bumpy road.
- "In a corner of the living room

729
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,425
near the mailbox--
a small mailbox

730
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,630
she-- you know, you can hear?

731
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:25,139
Heavy heart-breaking
sobs of a woman."

732
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,231
Oh my God, look at this

733
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,004
Look at-- oh my gosh

734
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,636
Okay, I can't see anything now

735
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,611
Here, I can get out if you want me to

736
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,583
Whoa, that makes everything
look really fucking creepy.

737
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,450
You might want to roll down your window
though, that would be helpful.

738
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,816
And get out of the way

739
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,587
sorry

740
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,220
Um, all I can see is a gate too,

741
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,662
so it's not really exciting

742
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,460
Should we pull over for a sec?

743
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,501
- We are pulled over
- Should we drive--

744
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,332
just pull into the driveway

745
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,303
Here, do you want me
to hand the camera to you?

746
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,863
Okay.

747
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,309
I think it's relatively
focused for the distance

748
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,039
It's recording.

749
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,618
Well

750
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,713
- All right.
- So this is--

751
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,223
what's the name
of this house?

752
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,986
The Jean Harlow house,
is that right?

753
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,050
- Yep.
- Just--

754
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,166
This is the house she
moved to after the studio

755
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,998
told her to move to a nicer house

756
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,163
So this is the nice house?

757
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,630
Apparently. For the 1930s

758
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,938
Look at the mailbox. Yeah

759
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,910
Place doesn't look lived in

760
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,280
Yeah? What does that mean?

761
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,250
That means we should go in

762
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,287
It means we can probably get in.

763
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,516
- Go on, Beckett
- Ridiculous.

764
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,922
- Why aren't you parking?
- Parking where?

765
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,426
Just stop for a second

766
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,587
There's a car coming this way

767
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,222
So pull back in

768
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,927
Okay, why don't we get out?

769
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,996
Okay yeah, that's great.
I'm driving. That's great

770
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,736
You're sort of parked
at the moment.

771
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,937
I'm trying to figure out
what we're gonna do.

772
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,003
- Are we getting out then?
- Yeah.

773
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,174
And looking at this gate
outside just for the sake--

774
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,546
This is the one right here?

775
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,279
It's not the one
next door to this one?

776
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,480
- This is-- this is--
- I'm highly conf-- I'm like

777
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,421
- Yeah, this is it.
- ...reviewing our relationship and

778
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,119
- wondering if it's really what I want
- Because the one before--

779
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,925
Like I'm just wondering
now at this point.

780
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,431
Is this really what
I wanted with my life?

781
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,321
- Right now.
- Yes, okay.

782
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,824
- Right now.
- Yes, okay.

783
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,927
it's Henry and Emily Strawling

784
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,268
They were a loving couple
in their late 20s.

785
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,638
Henry was an established
cinematographer

786
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,371
and had photographed
many celebrities from the 1920s

787
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,106
natural eye for lighting
blah blah blah.

788
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,273
"His wife Emily also
worked behind the camera

789
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,339
as an up-and-coming
costume designer.

790
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,444
Together they were remembered
as a loving and devoted couple."

791
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,045
Et cetera, et ectera.

792
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,057
Um, "Shortly after
they moved into their new home

793
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,616
Henry began to become
easily aggravated

794
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,630
and short-tempered. Never having
a history of this behavior before,

795
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,427
Emily discarded it
and figured it was a result?

796
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,899
Of the increasing pressures
of his burgeoning career.

797
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,460
However things became worse
He became depressed

798
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,699
talking angrily
with himself and at times

799
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,365
had momentary
outbursts of rage

800
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,467
Still Emily kept
the matter private,

801
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,479
as she still held on
to the faith that underneath it all

802
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,914
the man she married and fell
in love with was there."

803
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,542
then take next right

804
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,052
Um...

805
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,918
Okay well, what did
he do that was creepy?

806
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,015
- He was a paranoid schizophrenic
- Oh shit.

807
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,616
- Okay.
- Et cetera. She was pregnant-

808
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,682
eight months pregnant

809
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,990
Who didn't know,
so he wasn't on medication

810
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:37,032
"On October 30th, 1931,

811
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,795
Emily, eight months pregnant,

812
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,427
Henry decided to take the life
of his unborn child.

813
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,631
When Emily returned home
that afternoon,

814
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,401
Henry is said to have
sedated his wife,

815
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,101
stuffed her mouth with a cloth

816
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,644
and proceeded to cut her stomach open
to remove the unborn child."

817
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,772
Why couldn't we just do,
like, a regular Hollywood tour?

818
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,716
- See some celebrity houses?
- See the Hollywood sign.

819
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,275
With the baby in his hands,

820
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,651
he took its life.
Emily eventually bled to death

821
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,587
When he came to,
he realized what he had done

822
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,183
- and took his own life
- Arrive to destination

823
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,286
Um, he thought that
the baby was the devil

824
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,560
- And it's said it's been--
- Is it on the right or the left?

825
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,430
No-- uh--

826
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,060
it's over here

827
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,127
Pull over right here, I guess

828
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,173
Right, 16

829
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,970
- 1666--
- Did we just pass it?

830
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,772
I mean it's a fucking
abandoned house over there

831
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,869
- It's a nice neighborhood
- Hold on, let me--

832
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,245
Beckett, we gotta do it.

833
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,924
Where are we going after this?

834
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,482
I think we've been to

835
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:40,757
- every place.
- We could go eat

836
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,661
Food!

837
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,132
Hey hey

838
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,066
Where's the number?

839
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,571
Do we see the number
on that house?

840
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,700
Well, this looks like--

841
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,677
this looks like
what it would look like

842
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,613
And it looks well-kept.
I don't think it's this one

843
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,946
Oh my God

844
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,483
- You look concerned
- Huh?

845
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,426
- I said you look concerned
- Shut up, dude.

846
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,326
- It's gotta be this one
- Ya think?

847
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,160
'Cause that one's
the house before it

848
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,097
Oh.

849
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,431
- She has spoken.
- I meant the number

850
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,301
Gosh, you guys are rough

851
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,841
I'm coming

852
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,035
Hopscotch. Oh my gosh

853
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,976
You all right?

854
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,247
- Hopscotch? Really?
- Really?

855
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,054
I think it's better
standing before that

856
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,561
- Yes.
- Yes?

857
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,426
- It actually is.
- Legal, illegal

858
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,523
- I'm on the sidewalk
- This is not--

859
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,465
- You're on the actual property
- Yeah.

860
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:56,061
- So...
- Well, somebody wants to sell it

861
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,937
it's-- nobody's in it!

862
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,442
- So they're trying to...
- Who's gonna call the cops?

863
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,910
Get us to view it.

864
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:06,471
Why are you so worried
about the cops?

865
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,278
Cause they're the law?
I don't know.

866
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,216
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you get raped in prison

867
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,049
In Steph's own words
Fuck the police.

868
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,713
You're not pretty enough

869
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,054
I'm-- I don't have to be.

870
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,489
Let's go, fuck it

871
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,356
Jordan, Jordan!

872
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,865
- Jordan--
- Jordan, please

873
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,231
- Really?
- It's just the backyard

874
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,769
What are you, five years old?

875
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,634
- Kind of, yeah
- That's mean.

876
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,499
I'm trying to maintain
my childlike innocence

877
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,012
- Oi. Yep.
- Are you gonna come up here?

878
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,605
- No.
- I didn't ask you

879
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,742
You know, we're not
the one who parked.

880
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,581
Anyway, it's like
this is a hunger strike

881
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,955
Hey, let's go, come on

882
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,120
I just want a breath of fresh air
since I haven't been let out of the car

883
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,424
Okay, so, Steph

884
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,431
you're awesome.
You're really brave

885
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,194
and I commend you for that

886
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,462
- I'm not trying to be brave.
- What are you doing though?

887
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:01,662
- I was trying to have fun
- What are you doing?

888
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,033
I don't understand

889
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,697
What is the fun?
Where is the fun?

890
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,571
Please, no, tell me

891
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,110
I really want to know.
Tell me-- where is the fun?

892
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,669
- Where is the fun?
- Yeah, where-- what is it now?

893
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,806
We're sitting at the porch.
So what do you want to do?

894
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,374
- There's-- I don't--
- No, really, tell me

895
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,512
I don't want to sit in the car right
now. I think these places are cool

896
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,717
- Okay, just hang on the porch
- Me and Beckett will go.

897
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,488
Then we'll just come back
and pick you guys up.

898
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,961
- No.
- You can hang out on the porch

899
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,656
Okay. Busted

900
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,495
I mean that's fine
if you're scared.

901
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:33,831
- Come on now.
- It's not about being scared

902
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,098
- You're a child.
- But it's an abandoned house

903
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,833
It's for sale.
You guys are sitting there

904
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,499
Exactly, it's abandoned--
no one's here.

905
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,600
Yeah, but if it's for sale,
there's obviously people--

906
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,373
you know what I mean?
It's like-- come on.

907
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,914
You're like playing these--

908
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,314
Jordan's trying to get into
the fucking backyard.

909
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:51,376
- Okay really?
- Steph, please!

910
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,479
KR-an

911
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,615
- Come
- No.

912
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,818
It's fine.
We'll touch the door and run

913
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:01,227
- Why?
- Because then we can say we did it.

914
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,765
Okay, touch the door and run

915
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,960
- We need a light.
- You have a light

916
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,594
- We need your light.
- It doesn't work, Steph?

917
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,973
- Nope.
- Oh, that's mature

918
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,168
That's great

919
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,378
Steph, please.
Come on, I'm asking you nicely

920
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,507
And so am I.
I'm asking you to touch a door

921
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,485
What is this, boys versus girls?
This is really juvenile.

922
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,022
- Let's just go up and touch the door--
- Smart versus dumb.

923
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,852
If we go up there,
we leave, okay?

924
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,415
- That's fine.
- We go up there

925
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,758
- Yeah, it's probably locked
- ...you-- we go up there,

926
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,694
you touch the doorknob
we leave.

927
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,029
- Okay.
- We go to the next house,

928
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,863
cause this is-- this is--

929
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,427
not an idea of a good time

930
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,066
Tomorrow night's
your night anyway, so--

931
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,502
All right, fuck it

932
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,912
Let's get out of here
All right, okay.

933
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,110
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

934
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,749
- It's just cool.
- It's just the doorknob

935
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,986
Oh, good thing
the flashlight works there

936
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,495
- I was getting scared.
- Nobody's been in here in forever

937
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:10,532
- Except for spiders.
- Okay, touch the doorknob

938
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,693
- Yay!
- Touch the queen

939
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,827
- No, don't--
- Oh my God, it's locked

940
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,565
Obviously it's fucking locked

941
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,334
- There. Are you happy?
- No.

942
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:21,069
- You got your--
- I asked Beckett to touch the door

943
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,941
Oh ho ho.

944
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,878
She asked Beckett
to touch the door.

945
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,813
- No.
- Come on, just touch the door

946
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,442
Please! And then we can go
See, car right there?

947
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,077
Shake his hand
Promise.

948
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,281
- Promise.
- Dude, I'm a grown--

949
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,347
I can just leave.
I don't understand what--

950
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,393
- Yeah, let's just leave.
- You're gonna leave all of us

951
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,861
Besides me, who you don't like, you're
gonna leave your two best friends?

952
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,398
No, I'm leaving you regardless, but--

953
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,456
It's not funny.
I don't want to be here

954
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,024
- I'm sorry.
- Beckett, Beckett

955
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,627
- What?
- I'm on your side on this one,

956
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,797
- but I'm just saying
- Touch the door.

957
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,398
All I'm saying is-- listen, shake her
hand first so you know that she's--

958
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,943
- Didn't they just shake hands?
- No.

959
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,979
Regardless, we're leaving
when I touch the door.

960
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,241
Okay, he touches the doorknob
and then we're fucking leaving.

961
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,976
Really? " It's locked"?

962
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,781
- Oops.
- It was

963
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,118
- Did you fuck with me? Are you serious?
- I didn't!

964
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,952
- I didn't open it.
- Okay, stop, Steph!

965
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,048
- I'm sorry
- All right,

966
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,218
let's get the fuck out of here

967
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,625
- We touched the doorknob, come on
- Please, come on, honestly.

968
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,561
- Steph.
- I'm leaving. Come on, I'm leaving

969
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,121
I'm getting the fuck--
I'm getting out of here

970
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,165
Steph, let's go now

971
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,633
- Come on
- Steph!

972
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,692
- What?!
- Come on, get the-- let's go!

973
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,238
- Jordan!
- We're not supposed to be here

974
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,567
It's illegal to be here.

975
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,437
Okay?
I don't care anymore

976
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,068
- We're just looking at the property
- Hey hey, honesty.

977
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,113
We just want to see how many
bedrooms and how many baths

978
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,442
Oh yeah yeah, that's fucking-

979
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,743
- that's exactly--
- Jordan!

980
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,875
- There's no one here
- That's why.

981
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,852
- Why do you want to go in?
- Haven't you ever been in your house

982
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,547
when the power's out?
It's fun.

983
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,887
Yeah, my house.
This is not my house

984
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,857
Beckett, let's just leave.
If we leave, they'll fucking-

985
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,258
- come on.
- You're gonna leave?

986
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,989
- You're gonna leave us?
- I'm leaving.

987
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,929
If you guys want to stay,
you can stay. I'm leaving

988
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,557
- Really?
- Jordan, stop

989
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:53,397
- Jordan! Are you fucking kidding me?
- Dude!

990
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,130
- Oh my God.
- Jordan, come on

991
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,399
- Steph, that's enough
- Stop pulling me!

992
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,068
- Can you hear it?
- What?

993
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,806
You're just being a big baby

994
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,508
Driving to every place, you're like,
"Oh yeah, that sounds really cool.

995
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:10,017
Let's go." And then we get here
and you don't want to do anything

996
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,076
No, actually,
I didn't say that once

997
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,519
- I'm pretty sure.
- Oh, your handshake,

998
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,579
you're like Yeah, let's go

999
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,525
- If this sucks, you suck, ha ha
- This does suck.

1000
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,654
Uh-oh.
You know what that means?

1001
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,860
It only sucks 'cause
you're not participating.

1002
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,766
- It's not a joke.
- You're not participating.

1003
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,429
- What?
- Hey, Jordan, let's go. Come on

1004
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,563
- What?
- Let's go!

1005
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,163
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?

1006
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,231
Look, you saw inside the house
Look at this.

1007
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,904
- You saw inside the house.
- We didn't really see inside the house

1008
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,969
- and you guys haven't joined us
- Okay, so what--

1009
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,947
You were threatening
to leave us behind.

1010
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,746
Because I want to leave and I'm pretty
sure-- Beckett, do you want to leave?

1011
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,617
- Okay, so--
- Of course Beckett wants to leave

1012
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,418
'cause he's no fun

1013
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,427
It's not so bad

1014
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,658
So, what? Everything has
to be on your terms?

1015
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,722
Nothing tonight is on my terms

1016
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,564
- Really?
- I'm pretty sure. So I'm cut

1017
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,161
- Beckett, tonight-- one night
- That came out of nowhere.

1018
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,537
Okay, we're gonna do this here

1019
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:11,842
Jordan, come on

1020
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,610
I'm not fucking going in there
Jordan, come on.

1021
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,983
What are you doing? Really?

1022
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,520
There's no fucking power, dude

1023
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,078
- What?
- I don't know

1024
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,125
If there's no power--
okay yeah, you're right.

1025
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,126
You're right, you're right
There's no power.

1026
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,287
It's for sale.
It's not our house. Let's go

1027
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,228
Steph, no!

1028
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,926
It's just an unscheduled viewing

1029
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,536
Jordan, come on

1030
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,031
Come on

1031
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,343
I'm scared

1032
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,177
Hey, punch her in the face,
knock her out

1033
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,981
and we'll just pick 'em up
and drag 'em out of here.

1034
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,784
You guys don't even
want to be here.

1035
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:02,296
You're just standing in the fucking
middle of the living room, come on

1036
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,998
Dude, crap. Aiden, grab Steph
pull them out and that's it.

1037
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,903
- What?
- Grab your girlfriend

1038
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:15,409
Let's get the fuck out of here
Let's get the fuck out of here

1039
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:18,776
- Come on, I'm serious. Let's just go
- Steph.

1040
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,373
- Come on.
- Don't touch me! Are you kidding me?

1041
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,617
Come on

1042
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,421
Oh my God

1043
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,718
Fuck.

1044
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,351
This is a damn shame

1045
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,453
- Who shut the door?
- Oh, babe.

1046
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,021
- No one shut the door
- It was just the wind.

1047
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,794
No, it's not the wind

1048
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,006
I mean, there's just obviously
another door in the house.

1049
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:50,238
Well, fuck. I don't wanna fucking
be in here anymore.

1050
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,317
What kind of fucking door
doesn't open?

1051
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,685
Why don't we try and get
out of these doors?

1052
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,280
If this way was open--

1053
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,053
We shouldn't fucking be here, man

1054
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,889
- Fuck.
- No no, fuck

1055
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,691
There has to be-- houses have more
than one fucking entrance.

1056
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,926
- That was super comforting
- It's ridiculous.

1057
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,026
Well, we're not going
to get anywhere standing here

1058
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,900
So what are--
what are we doing here?

1059
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,166
- We're trying to find a way out
- Listen, we're stuck.

1060
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,071
We shouldn't have fucking
come in here. It's fine.

1061
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,337
We're just gonna find the quickest
way out and get out of here.

1062
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,639
- Exactly. We'll just--
- Tomorrow because there's

1063
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,906
not supposed to be anyone in here

1064
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,970
- Wait wait, stop
- Stop what?

1065
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,039
There's gotta be a way out
Right? There's a way out.

1066
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,347
- We just got in. We're gonna get out
- No, she's right.

1067
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,479
- The door just shut on us
- It's just a house.

1068
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,454
She's right.
Listen listen, shh shh

1069
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,719
I feel like I'm going crazy
because you're all--

1070
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,988
Shh shh shh, now everyone
calm down, all right?

1071
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,257
Listen, she's right, okay?
There's a way in, there's a way out

1072
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,094
They had a backyard.
There's gonna be a back door

1073
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,565
- Okay? All right?
- Thank you.

1074
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:47,727
So let's just fucking
go out the back door

1075
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,532
- All right?
- Let's just look

1076
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,233
Let's just have a fucking great
time in this fucking house.

1077
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,435
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- No no no, I don't

1078
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,569
- Okay, let's go.
- Thank you, thank you!

1079
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,083
Oh, Shit.

1080
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,176
I can't see

1081
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,653
- It's just for show.
- Anything in there?

1082
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,815
- It's not real.
- It's boarded up

1083
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,552
Shit.

1084
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,025
Okay.

1085
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,021
Creepy

1086
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,684
What is this?

1087
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,214
It's just a house

1088
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,486
It's just a house

1089
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,755
where a man killed his wife and baby

1090
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,592
And we're stuck inside it

1091
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,962
- Close the door
- Stay close.

1092
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,932
Close it.

1093
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,833
Shit, Jordan

1094
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,201
Okay, I'm sorry.
You told me to close the door

1095
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,830
Yes, but just don't slam--
don't slam the door.

1096
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,340
I didn't slam the door

1097
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,934
- Don't pretend like you don't know
- Jesus Christ.

1098
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,536
- Next time you can shut the door
- Are you done?

1099
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,444
- Yes, we're done, we're done
- No, I'm not.

1100
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,414
- You're not gonna shut the door?
- Beckett, just be done.

1101
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,974
You want to open it instead?

1102
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,979
- Shh shh shh
- Oh my God.

1103
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,717
Okay, go in now! I don't want
to be out in this fucking hall.

1104
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:16,849
Okay okay

1105
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,552
Steph, just shine your light
in the doorway.

1106
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,255
Make sure no one-- oh shit

1107
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,629
it's an empty house.
There's probably animals or--

1108
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,565
- It's a fucking closet
- Okay, it's a clo--

1109
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,836
- Can we rip this off?
- Looks like we're gonna

1110
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,896
get arrested,
that's what I'm worried about

1111
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,101
Always yes

1112
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,644
So at least I can see it, okay?

1113
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,771
Do you want to be in charge of it?

1114
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,906
You can hold the light

1115
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,753
- You can check this door
- It's probably in here.

1116
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,382
- Here.
- Oh come on, man!

1117
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,654
What is-- okay, it's locked

1118
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:55,963
Oh Shit

1119
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:04,130
How are you so calm right now?

1120
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,196
I'm not calm, Beckett

1121
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,369
We're all just trying
to find the way out.

1122
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:16,442
- Shh. Beckett
- What?

1123
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,611
Who the fuck boards shit up
from the inside, dude?

1124
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,383
- Really.
- Honest. Yeah, that's exactly right

1125
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,948
Yeah, I know.
They don't want people inside

1126
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,961
- The drawers.
- I don't want to be out in the hall

1127
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,156
Check the drawers for what?

1128
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,994
There's no one
in the fucking house

1129
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,727
- Yeah.
- All right

1130
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,828
Okay.

1131
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,276
Okay, it's just a room

1132
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,871
- Check your pockets for shit
- I don't have anything.

1133
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,109
You have nothing on you?

1134
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,117
No, I don't have anything on me

1135
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,676
- Let's just call someone.
- Dude, I don't have any service

1136
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,154
I don't have service either

1137
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,522
Shit, I don't have
my phone on me either

1138
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,891
- Keys.
- Keys?

1139
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,827
- Keys, I have keys
- Wallet.

1140
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,125
I have a key. I have keys

1141
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,257
- Do you have a knife on you?
- A what?

1142
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,063
You have a knife on you?

1143
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,196
- Babe, can we--
- How boarded up do you think these are?

1144
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,365
Do you think both of you
could pull them off?

1145
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,431
I don't know
I mean--

1146
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:17,604
- Give it a try.
- Yeah, let's try it

1147
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,908
- These things are--
- Give the camera to Jordan

1148
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,449
- Help him out
- Really?

1149
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,143
- Yeah.
- I'm pretty sure I can hold it

1150
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:24,651
Dude, I want to get
the fuck out.

1151
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,483
We're already criminals, so..

1152
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,454
yeah now.

1153
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,991
I've gotten in the house

1154
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,286
- I wanna get out.
- Now you want to damage it?

1155
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,624
- Yes yes, I do! Yes, I do.
- Now you want to damage it

1156
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,754
- Let's fuck it up.
- Okay, let's fuck it up

1157
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,230
One, two, three

1158
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,495
Come on!

1159
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,472
Fuck!

1160
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,407
- Let's go again. Let's go again
- Shit.

1161
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,773
Give me a sec
Give me a sec

1162
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,278
men

1163
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,507
One, two, three!

1164
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,216
- Well yeah.
- Oh my God

1165
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,280
- Ready?
- We should try another fucking window

1166
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,325
Well, that's obviously what you do

1167
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,724
One, two, three

1168
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,665
- It's not going anywhere
- I'm dizzy.

1169
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,601
I'm fucking lightheaded anyway

1170
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,639
You think they're all like this?
Try 'em all?

1171
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,674
- Fuck.
- Can't hear us.

1172
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,474
One, two, three

1173
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,418
I'm fucking dizzy as shit

1174
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:33,079
I'm hyperventilating.

1175
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,016
Fuck!

1176
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,101
- Just gotta-
- Dig deep.

1177
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,898
Gonna try it one more time

1178
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,961
Just try it one more time

1179
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,836
I'm gonna break it down

1180
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,376
Okay.

1181
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,646
Is that a door?

1182
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,990
That's, you know, about it

1183
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,859
I mean, logically, there has
to be another way out of here

1184
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,625
Right? This is--

1185
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,030
it's fucking house.
There's a way in, there's a way out

1186
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,065
You guys can speak up. Ideas?

1187
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,771
Shh

1188
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,048
Oh Shit

1189
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,994
men

1190
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,604
There's nothing there

1191
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,048
I know

1192
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,950
We've got to get out of here, guys
Let's go.

1193
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,691
Help help!

1194
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,754
I anyone. please!

1195
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,267
- Aiden.
- We're stuck in the house, please!

1196
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,930
Please get us out of here,
anyone, please!

1197
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,200
Help help!

1198
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,401
Aiden, what the fuck, dude?

1199
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,945
- Help!
- Aiden, fuck this. Fucking help!

1200
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,245
I want out of this house now!

1201
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,979
I want out!

1202
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,918
Okay, try the door

1203
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,892
Fuck! I knew we shouldn't
have fucking come here!

1204
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,332
It's gonna be okay

1205
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,427
Why the fuck did
we let them do this?

1206
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,301
It's all your fucking fault
I swear to God.

1207
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,840
- Jordan, you okay?
- Yeah.

1208
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,000
I fucking-- I knew it
I fucking knew it!

1209
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:10,544
- Stop.
- Who's the fucking bitch now?

1210
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,511
Stop it! I didn't know this
was gonna happen!

1211
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,480
- Stop it.
- Shut the fuck up!

1212
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,074
- Shut up!
- Just relax for two seconds

1213
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,381
Just relax, okay?

1214
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,286
- We're gonna get out
- It's gonna be okay.

1215
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,882
This is shit, okay?
This shit doesn't fucking happen

1216
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,827
- Houses don't fucking lock.
- Dude, we heard a fucking baby cry

1217
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,056
There's nothing there!

1218
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,656
You just heard
a fucking baby cry!

1219
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,759
There's nothing there, okay?
Stay-- just just--

1220
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,733
- What?
- We're fucking losing it.

1221
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,865
You know, we're just tired
We're just tired.

1222
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,409
We're losing it because we fucking-
don't fucking touch me now!

1223
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,308
It's 2:00 in the morning, okay?
Just relax.

1224
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,505
I know we're in an abandoned house

1225
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,309
at 2:00 in the morning
and there's fucking babies

1226
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,249
- and we can't get out.
- Just think of where we can get out

1227
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,012
It's gonna be okay

1228
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,590
We've gotta do something

1229
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,194
Yeah, like what?

1230
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,967
Let's just stay here

1231
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,134
No.

1232
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:49,939
No, I'm not staying
here any longer.

1233
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,945
I want to get out
of this house right now

1234
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:56,744
I do too, but

1235
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:00,344
I'd like another
10 minutes or so to just stay

1236
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,787
No no, Steph

1237
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,382
Not another 10 minutes
because then it's another 10 minutes

1238
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:08,156
and another 10 minutes
and another 10 minutes for what?

1239
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,630
- We should just stay here
- Nobody's--

1240
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,167
We're all together.
Nothing's bothering us

1241
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,362
Nobody is coming, okay?

1242
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,398
And I don't want to stay here
any longer than I have to.

1243
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:22,306
I think we should do another loop
around the house.

1244
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,902
I don't want to stay here
any longer either, Aiden,

1245
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,641
but I'm fine right here

1246
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,774
And I have Beckett
and I have you guys

1247
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,148
- Beckett?
- Let's just stay

1248
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,380
- Beckett, I'm staying here
- We're safe here.

1249
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,855
Beckett, we gotta do another
loop around the house.

1250
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,722
What if we missed something?
It was dark and maybe we did.

1251
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,727
- We checked every door
- We were rushed,

1252
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,023
we were scared, all right?

1253
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:44,725
All I'm saying is maybe

1254
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,858
we missed something.

1255
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:52,101
- I'm not leaving
- Why?

1256
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,698
Because I'm safe here

1257
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,641
Nothing's bothering EH-3,

1258
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,646
How could you suggest we go
trudging through the house after--

1259
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,739
after that?

1260
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:04,341
You just want to sit here?

1261
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,409
Vane,

1262
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,082
How much longer do you
think the light's gonna last?

1263
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,091
Think about it

1264
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:13,320
We're safe. I'm safe here

1265
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,625
I'm safe here

1266
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,427
Aiden's right

1267
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:24,503
- You want to go out there?
- No, I don't want to.

1268
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,500
I don't want to stay here

1269
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,566
- What?
- I don't want to go anywhere

1270
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,004
We're fine

1271
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,140
Yeah. No, we're not fine here
I'm not fine here.

1272
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:40,119
Nobody's fine here, Steph.
Okay, we have to go check one more time

1273
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,452
We might have
missed something

1274
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,788
- It's gonna be fine
- I'm fine, just--

1275
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,656
let's not go around the house

1276
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:50,323
That's not the point.
Okay? We can't just sit here.

1277
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,161
I'm not fucking around anymore
I'm serious.

1278
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,132
- Let's get out right now
- We need to figure out

1279
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,828
- a way to get out of here
- Beckett.

1280
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,099
We gotta get out right now, man
I'm not sitting here any longer.

1281
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,300
- I know.
- It doesn't make sense

1282
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,205
- Come on
- Okay.

1283
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,418
Jordan, come on

1284
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,820
Stay close, okay?
We'll be okay.

1285
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,085
- Jordan.
- Come on, Jordan

1286
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:20,650
We're all sticking together

1287
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,111
Oh fuck

1288
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,309
I told you this was a bad idea

1289
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,650
We shouldn't do this

1290
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,768
Now what?

1291
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,403
- Okay.
- Jordan, take this

1292
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:13,606
Mm-hmm

1293
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,684
It's this part right here

1294
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,620
Come on

1295
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,723
Fuck.

1296
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,105
Are you okay?

1297
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:50,744
- Is it coming off?
- What?!

1298
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,878
- Hey hey, Aiden!
- Cut it out. Just stop it

1299
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,444
The fuck, dude? Hey

1300
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,148
What are you doing?

1301
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,087
Come on, let's get this off

1302
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,328
Fuck.

1303
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,133
Fuck.

1304
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:34,856
All right,
come on, come on

1305
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,582
Steph, come on

1306
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,919
Fuck.

1307
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,288
Fuck!

1308
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,832
Over here.

1309
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:30,683
- Fuck, man.
- Are you okay?

1310
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,276
Okay.

1311
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,357
Okay okay.

1312
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,020
Okay.

1313
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,231
- All right, all right.
- Come on. Come on!

1314
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,567
You okay?

1315
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,355
Guys guys guys guys!

1316
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:39,243
I got you.

1317
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:41,049
All right. Okay

1318
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,646
One, two, three

1319
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,692
Again

1320
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,991
Two, three

1321
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,264
Fuck, it's freezing!

1322
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,365
Whoo!

1323
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,107
Honey, what do you see?

1324
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,874
Oh.

1325
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,409
Guys, I think I'm--

1326
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:13,920
Help me, please! Help me!

1327
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:15,614
Jordan, turn on the fucking light

1328
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,385
I can't find it!
I can't find it!

1329
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,824
- Find the light. Beckett, hold on
- I can't find it.

1330
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,123
Fuck. Oh shit, oh shit

1331
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,164
Okay, I got it.
I fucking-- I found it

1332
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,461
I found it

1333
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:31,836
Oh, you're fucking
kidding me.

1334
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,169
Oh fuck

1335
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,677
I got it

1336
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:39,406
I got it, I got it

1337
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,709
I got it,
I got it.

1338
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,114
Okay okay.

1339
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,913
Come on

1340
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,510
Beckett!

1341
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,723
Men

1342
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,251
Beckett!

1343
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:54,852
- Aiden.
- You hear me?!

1344
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,425
Oh Shit

1345
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:01,934
All right, help me up there, all right?

1346
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,664
- I'm gonna go see if he's okay
- No, I want to go.

1347
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,763
- Just leave-- lift me up. I'm lighter
- What?

1348
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,705
I want to see if he's up there,
Aiden, please.

1349
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,299
- Okay.
- Please let me go

1350
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:10,810
All right.
I got you, I got you

1351
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,937
Okay okay, go.

1352
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,915
Okay. Almost there

1353
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,848
You guys, he isn't here.
I don't know where he is

1354
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,890
Beckett?

1355
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,925
- Do you see anything?
- No. No.

1356
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,188
- You don't see anything?
- There's nothing up here.

1357
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,729
Aiden, there's nothing up here
He's not here.

1358
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,492
Oh my God, oh my God

1359
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,227
There's his nail
there's his nail.

1360
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,428
Shit, okay, fuck.
Come back down then

1361
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:42,733
You're okay, you're okay

1362
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:46,143
I'm not okay, I'm not okay, Aiden
Beckett's gone.

1363
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,300
I miss my dad

1364
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,747
it's funny
if you think about--

1365
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,978
being a kid and how happy
we were and how, like,

1366
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,817
the smallest things would
make you happy for days.

1367
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,754
Like...

1368
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:32,952
a fucking ice cream cone
or a balloon or something?

1369
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,791
But I think that was
the favorite part of my childhood

1370
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,992
Just being with him
I don't know.

1371
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,203
I mean, he was there
to drive me to every practice

1372
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,866
and every--
every day to school

1373
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,812
it's like you get older
and it's funny 'cause it takes--

1374
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:57,614
it takes you like 20 years
to realize that shit.

1375
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:02,819
And then one day

1376
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,454
you wake up and you just hope
it's not too late.

1377
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,767
I just wish he was here,
you know?

1378
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,696
I'd tell him how much--

1379
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,640
how much I appreciate
everything he does.

1380
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:31,143
I wish Beckett was here.

1381
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,115
I remember the first time
we hung out.

1382
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:43,823
We hiked all the way up to Runyon Canyon
and we'd had a couple drinks,

1383
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:46,492
which I guess wasn't
the best thing to do.

1384
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,502
But we climbed the gate
and went all the way to the top

1385
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:52,300
And we just sat up there
for hours,

1386
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:56,468
talking and laughing. And it was
just like, we just found each other

1387
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,911
We had our dreams in front of us
We overlooked the city and--

1388
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:03,746
I'm here and--
I don't know.

1389
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,582
We were just
so full of hope and--

1390
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:10,112
I knew then that
I was so in love with him,

1391
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,388
but I couldn't tell him.
It would have been totally weird

1392
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,656
But, um--

1393
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,127
can you guys hear that?

1394
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:25,395
God, my ear really hurts.

1395
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,134
Ow.

1396
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,701
WEE?

1397
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,485
You're okay

1398
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,961
You're okay

1399
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:53,029
Can you hear that?

1400
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,931
It's okay, we're gonna
get out of here.

1401
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,095
- Can you hear that?
- Steph, Steph, Steph

1402
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,570
- Stay with me.
- Can you hear that?!

1403
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,504
Jordan, can you help me out
for a second maybe?

1404
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,372
Just calm her down.
You're freaking her out

1405
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:04,308
You're freaking me out
Can't you hear that?

1406
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,437
We're gonna get out of here

1407
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:08,379
Jordan, stop it!

1408
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:10,383
Mam

1409
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,612
am.

1410
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,622
I loved him

1411
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:21,987
steph!

1412
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,793
Open the door, come on
Jordan--

1413
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,265
Open the fucking door

1414
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:32,005
Steph, can you hear me?
I need the light.

1415
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,699
Jordan!

1416
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,871
Come over here
Jordan.

1417
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,815
She fucking took her cellphone
Shine the light on the door.

1418
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,078
Jordan

1419
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,245
Okay.

1420
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:50,755
Jordan

1421
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:55,021
Jordan?

1422
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,087
Go away

1423
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:00,258
You okay?

1424
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,029
- I don't know
- No?

1425
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,207
I'm sorry.

1426
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,766
Okay, you know,

1427
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,641
I didn't mean that,
okay, Jordan?

1428
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,873
You know it wasn't me
It's this fucking-

1429
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,917
it's the place.
It's the house. It's the fucking-

1430
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,681
I don't trust you

1431
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,882
Why don't you just
open the door, okay?

1432
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,618
No.

1433
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,825
I miss you

1434
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:30,193
And I know you're just
on the other side of the door,

1435
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,391
but I fucking miss you. Okay?

1436
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:36,102
So please open up

1437
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,343
Jordan?

1438
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,470
You remember--

1439
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:49,613
you remember
when you met me in that elevator?

1440
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:54,115
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

1441
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,087
Did you think I was cute?

1442
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,647
No.

1443
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:00,523
I thought you were cute

1444
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,153
I thought you were beautiful

1445
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,333
You didn't like me,
not even a little, huh?

1446
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,604
A little bit

1447
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,141
Maybe a little

1448
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,412
I'm still the same guy, Jordan
Okay?

1449
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,450
I love you.
Just open the door

1450
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,349
And then we're gonna get out of here
It's gonna be okay.

1451
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:27,819
I just need you to open the door first,

1452
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,856
'cause I'm not gonna
leave here without you

1453
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,961
- I love you.
- I love you too

1454
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:38,055
Just unlock it, all right?
I'm right here, on the other side

1455
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,599
I can't. It's locked

1456
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:45,366
- Fuck.
- It's locked, I can't--

1457
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,429
Jordan, just relax
Jordan! Relax!

1458
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:49,373
Just turn
the doorknob once, okay?

1459
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,001
Just unlock it

1460
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,051
Jordan!

1461
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,323
Fuck, Jordan,
open the fucking door!

1462
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,453
Come-- Jordan! Jordan!

1463
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,724
Fuck, come on!

1464
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,792
Give me the light

1465
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,548
- Is she there? Jordan?
- No.

1466
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,311
Jordan?

1467
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,763
Men

1468
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,060
All right, come on
Come on, let's go

1469
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,318
Steph

1470
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,985
Steph, come on, stop it.

1471
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:25,188
Steph, come on.
Cut it out, okay?

1472
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,758
Steph

1473
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,232
Steph, cut it out!

1474
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,948
Oh no. Hey, wake up

1475
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:53,282
Hey. Hey hey.
Come on, come on.

1476
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,349
Wake up. Steph

1477
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:58,015
Please, wake up, come on

1478
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,582
Oh Shit

1479
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,425
Come on.
Come on, Steph

1480
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:07,628
Oh God

1481
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:09,635
Come on. Wake up.

1482
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,329
Hey!

1483
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,339
Steph, come on, please wake up

1484
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,350
Hello?

1485
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,821
Hello!

1486
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:38,596
Yes, this-- this is an emergency
okay? Listen to me.

1487
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,567
We're in this house, okay
There was four of us.

1488
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,570
There-- there was four of us
and now they're dead.

1489
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:47,038
Okay, they're--
they're all fucking dead and--

1490
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:49,336
no, I-- I-- I don't--
I don't know where we are

1491
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:50,900
I don't--

1492
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:53,446
no, wait-- it's, uh--

1493
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,709
it's 1666-- it's--

1494
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,478
six--

1495
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,452
shit, I don't--
I don't know. Fuck!

1496
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,216
I-- hello?

1497
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,582
Hello?

1498
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:10,688
Oh no

1499
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:14,360
It's here

1500
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:18,634
Oh no, it's here

1501
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:22,833
Oh shit. No, it's here.

1502
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:25,003
It's here

1503
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,311
No.

1504
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:33,317
No! No no no!

1505
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,527
Everything you need

1506
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:56,042
Is everything I need to be

1507
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:03,578
I sit across the room

1508
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:07,415
Your breathing starts
to croon to me

1509
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:15,227
Very prone to be

1510
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:20,198
A pillar of things
you never will need

1511
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:27,506
So please don't let me go

1512
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:38,248
Down old paths and radios for long?

1513
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:48,084
And when the day comes

1514
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:54,032
The dreadful scene approaching

1515
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,330
Don't leave.

1516
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,497
With your hands covering

1517
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:02,235
Your face

1518
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:07,804
Well, my body is stone cold here

1519
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:11,214
well, don't go

1520
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:14,186
Don't leave

1521
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:19,555
Don't leave my place

1522
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:33,069
When everything goes dry

1523
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:37,235
Remember it's no big surprise

1524
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:44,383
When everything you love

1525
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:47,283
Starts messing with your head

1526
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:50,448
And phones drop

1527
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,762
Well, go ahead, blame me

1528
01:20:56,818 --> 01:21:01,358
And push me down the stairs
to the street

1529
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,468
I'm slowly getting up

1530
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:14,913
My body aches of sunlight inside

1531
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,511
And somewhere

1532
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,782
Far away?

1533
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:25,415
In my mind

1534
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,292
I'll dream

1535
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:33,527
And call out loud

1536
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:37,866
Without inviting you.

1537
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:45,738
I've gone too far away.

1538
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:51,716
In my mind I'm dreaming

1539
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:57,452
And I'll call out loud

1540
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:01,119
Without inviting you.

1541
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:59,783
Please won't you lead me back?

1542
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:06,458
Please won't you lead me back?
