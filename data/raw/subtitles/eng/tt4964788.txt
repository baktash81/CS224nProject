1
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,280
Look at me, that's beautiful.

2
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,210
How beautiful!

3
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,720
Hello dad.

4
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,840
Hello, my dear.
You arrived?

5
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,260
Almost. Tata Ana came
pick us up at the airport.

6
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,350
My dear, how are you?

7
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,400
- What time is it there?
- Midday.

8
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,650
Are you waking up?

9
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,220
The flight, was it?

10
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,110
We did not sleep.

11
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,940
- Hi, Alejandro.
- Ana, how's that?

12
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,070
Very good.

13
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,270
Too bad you did not come.
We will miss you.

14
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,160
Next time, sorry.

15
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,410
It will be only in three years.

16
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,620
I will invite them
for their honeymoon.

17
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,750
We will show them Argentina.

18
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,830
What a good idea!

19
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,040
Congratulations on my behalf ...
What is the name of the victim?

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,830
His name is Joan.
I will tell him.

21
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,260
Thank you.

22
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,140
Dad, Tutu slept with you?

23
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,560
I dunno. I'm looking for it.

24
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,440
I miss him?

25
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,900
Tutu, come talk to your master.

26
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,940
- And your brother?
- Here, talk to Dad.

27
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,220
Hello dad.

28
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,440
Hi, my dear,
how's it going?

29
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,150
Well. Hello, Tutu.

30
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,940
My love I miss you.

31
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,900
Give me a kiss.

32
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,710
Paco!

33
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,530
Do not mix these clusters
with the rest.

34
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,820
We must leave them apart.

35
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,120
- Very pretty.
- Ah yes?

36
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,890
- It's a bit tight.
- Show me.

37
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,930
You got a little bigger.

38
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,300
- Really?
- I prefer you like that.

39
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,550
- I am glad.
- To have fattened?

40
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,230
That you have me in the eye.

41
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,760
I help you?

42
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,810
It's blocked.

43
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,430
Like that?

44
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,070
You will break it.

45
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,330
And from inside ...

46
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,780
You are very beautiful.

47
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,590
Is it okay?

48
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,950
I want to do it!

49
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,210
Laura!

50
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,010
Roco!

51
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,970
Mom, your sister has arrived!

52
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,090
Say hello to your cousin.

53
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Diego!

54
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,480
Where are you going?

55
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,360
Say hello to your aunt.

56
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,440
Are we all going to this hotel?

57
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,940
We also rented a house,
if you prefer.

58
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,080
We are dead.
We will not take care of housing.

59
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,240
For two nights, we do not care.
Me, everything suits me.

60
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,950
Decide yourself.
I'll be right back.

61
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,460
How are you, my love?

62
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,960
Here is Joan.
My sister, Laura, Diego, Irene.

63
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,890
It is more beautiful than in photo.

64
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,060
Enchant.
Ana told me a lot about you.

65
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,980
Same thing for us.

66
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,900
- We have everything?
- Yes.

67
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,270
Let's go.

68
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,190
Not bad...
Nothing to do with the last one.

69
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,840
Dad?

70
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,080
- Where are we going?
- I prepared your rooms upstairs.

71
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,340
Where's he, Dad?

72
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,930
Go see in the yard.

73
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,150
My handsome dad.

74
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,190
You are so handsome.

75
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,910
My big sister!

76
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,670
I missed you

77
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,600
He took a shot of old, dad.

78
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,610
Since the time
that you have not seen it ...

79
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,110
It's old!

80
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,360
We all realize it,
except him.

81
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,270
The children ...

82
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,490
Change, grandpa is waiting for you.

83
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,940
Pass it to me.

84
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,560
Do not go so fast.

85
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,480
Do not be afraid.

86
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,540
Tie them.

87
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,210
Brakes!

88
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,520
Who are these morons?

89
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,260
It was not your nephew?

90
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,940
And who was driving?

91
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
I dunno.

92
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,860
My wife hobbled me for
I come to talk to you about wine.

93
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
has

94
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,070
it's the...

95
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,320
word.

96
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,410
The difference between  a

97
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,120
and  a ...

98
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,450
is made by ...

99
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,510
the weather.

100
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,250
It's all well and good,
but when are we drinking?

101
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,630
You want to drink?

102
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,550
If the teacher agrees ...

103
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,930
What next?
No way.

104
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,980
It's time
which gives character,

105
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,850
from personality to wine.
Okay?

106
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,980
I come again.

107
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,610
I brought it to you from my domain.

108
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,120
He is very good.

109
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,940
While the teacher's back is turned,
who wants to taste?

110
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,410
- Great.
- He's great, right?

111
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,490
It looks great.

112
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,410
- It's them three?
- Yes, Abel, Matias and Marco.

113
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,450
- Will you accompany them?
- Of course, you're worried.

114
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,420
I promised to marry
that you would do the job of pros.

115
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,260
We will do even better than that.

116
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,050
He said he would come.

117
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,390
He had an impediment at work.

118
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,310
He must have stayed.

119
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,970
The job, it can wait.

120
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,890
He does not work like us.

121
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,440
- It must be overflowed.
- You do not seem to be cool.

122
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,740
We have ups and downs.

123
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,320
We can barely get there
   repay the loan.

124
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,040
It's normal at the beginning.

125
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,570
It's been two years.

126
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,240
It's better than bickering
At home.

127
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,090
We are fighting here.

128
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,970
Dj?

129
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,140
You've finished?
What did I tell you?

130
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,680
Leave me alone.

131
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,930
What do I care for him?

132
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,670
Piti , do not start again.

133
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,430
What beauty.

134
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,820
She looks like you.

135
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,650
Open eyes,
she looks like her father.

136
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,480
How are you, Gabriel?

137
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,450
He went to Germany.

138
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,450
- To find a job.
- And you?

139
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,130
We are separating.

140
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,300
I did not know.

141
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,470
Why?

142
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,390
It did not work between us.

143
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,260
And my parents ...

144
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,350
I did not like it much.

145
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,880
And the little girl?

146
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,230
She stays with me.

147
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
My dear.

148
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,490
I am sorry.

149
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,080
Paco!

150
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,430
You come back every time
with a new one!

151
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,340
They are rather successful, right?

152
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,850
How are you?

153
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,610
Show this little cat, l ...

154
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,110
Do you kiss him?

155
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,230
She does not want.

156
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,690
I do not want.

157
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,600
Come here.

158
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,900
You kissed me!

159
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,280
A little kiss.

160
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,990
That you're cute, thank you.

161
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,360
She is beautiful like you.

162
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,860
No, she looks like her father.

163
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,630
Alejandro? You dream!

164
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,910
Who told you
that she was from Alejandro?

165
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,120
She's the daughter of Roc o and Gabriel!

166
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,960
Crap!

167
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,430
A bird poop!

168
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,840
Espoir of hell!

169
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,940
Irene!

170
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm going, right now.

171
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,650
It's your daughter?

172
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,040
What are you doing?

173
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,880
Can we know what you're doing?

174
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Felipe, you're brave
to go up behind this madwoman.

175
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,130
You speak! It is
wet chickens, guys.

176
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,420
Come see, my hen.

177
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,840
And your helmets?

178
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,090
We wet chickens?

179
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,510
Tell him
what I was doing at his age.

180
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
The 400 moves.

181
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,860
Do you see the roof of the church?

182
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,810
At your age,
Paco climbed upstairs.

183
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,360
It was so bad for storks
they are gone.

184
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,030
This is for  a
they're fucking me.

185
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,290
It's deugueu.

186
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,330
Stops!

187
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,880
She's beautiful, huh?

188
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,500
Beautiful and big.

189
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,040
You just have to
that she is wiser.

190
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,380
L  and l .

191
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,880
- Will it be ready tomorrow?
- You will not go naked to the wedding.

192
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,180
Hello.

193
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,270
Hi, son.

194
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,220
She already saw you on the bike, your mother?

195
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,730
Damn motorcycle.

196
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,320
All these people coming,

197
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,440
it is the guests of marriage?

198
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,030
A Catalan, an Argentinian ... Ana
found a good party, like Laura.

199
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,610
If they had stayed,

200
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,330
they would have ended up like Mariana,
with poor Fernando.

201
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,450
Paco saw your dress?

202
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,630
He flashed on it.

203
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,540
On the dress
or what goes in it?

204
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,070
It's enough like that.

205
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,110
- But your daughter ...
- Its good!

206
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,450
Come on, dad!

207
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,070
Just a little behind.

208
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,730
You marry your daughter.

209
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,020
Be in a better mood.

210
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,660
Did you ring your bell?

211
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
What not to hear ...

212
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
What a mule head.

213
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,050
Do not worry, asshole.

214
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,770
Already they sting
our job ...

215
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,600
Stops. I'll see you
to work in full dodger.

216
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,980
I was working on these lands

217
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,900
when you were a twink
busy   dredging.

218
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,520
Do not come and teach me.

219
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,040
Vicente ...

220
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,270
In the name of the Father, the Son,

221
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,770
and the Holy Spirit.

222
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,190
May the Lord be with you.

223
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,730
My dear brothers,
we are gathered

224
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,570
for God to confirm by his grace

225
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,200
your decision to unite,

226
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,150
in the presence
from the minister of the church

227
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,610
and the Christian community.

228
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,100
The view is great from here.

229
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,310
Stop, you're crazy!

230
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,040
What a coward.

231
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,670
You know who it is,  a?

232
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,300
- They must be dead.
- No.

233
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,170
How do you know?

234
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,130
I do not know, I guess.

235
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,350
I know them?

236
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,760
It's your mother.

237
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,190
And the P?

238
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,390
Paco.

239
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,640
Are you serious?

240
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,310
Everyone knows it.

241
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,660
What?

242
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,740
That they were in love.

243
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,040
- And your initial?
- I did not put it.

244
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,410
Do it!

245
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,300
I will do it for you.

246
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,790
No...

247
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,930
Stop, it's disgusting.

248
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,650
Come on, go ahead, write.

249
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,280
Go ahead.

250
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,390
But you will leave again.

251
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,520
Leave with me.

252
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,190
- In Argentina?
- Yes.

253
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,770
- My mother will not want to.
- Your mother?

254
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,870
Prepare your bag softly
and pull yourself.

255
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,150
Come on ...

256
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,440
You're crazy!

257
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,580
The bell tower and the clock of the church
fall into ruin.

258
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,440
But h las,

259
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,830
we need help
to repair them.

260
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,910
Too bad that Laura's husband
did not accompany him.

261
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,220
His help was precious
for the work of the facade.

262
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,000
The state of the bell tower would not have it
leave indifferent.

263
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,560
While the parishioners ...

264
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,190
He misses an opportunity to beg.

265
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,510
Take care of your church,

266
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,260
it belongs to you.

267
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,190
By the way, to launch

268
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,950
rice on the husbands,
wait to be in the square ...

269
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,140
Why not.

270
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,940
Take this one.

271
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,830
We drink.

272
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,190
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

273
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
The teeth.

274
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,660
Not tonight, please.

275
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,210
OK, wash your hands.

276
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,520
Come see, my dear.

277
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,990
Is it okay?

278
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,490
She had a discomfort while dancing.

279
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,940
You were good.
What's wrong?

280
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,030
I feel sleepy.

281
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,360
This is the time difference.
You are exhausted. In bed.

282
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,290
Put it up there for me.

283
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,720
- I help you?
- No need.

284
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,050
You drank too much.

285
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,550
Go away, leave me alone.

286
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,470
What character, this grandfather.

287
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,360
What a shitty thing ...

288
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,720
Is it better?

289
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,280
Mariana ...

290
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,150
It's me, dad.

291
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,400
I want to go down, call Mariana.

292
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,240
- I will help you.
- No.

293
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,370
What can you do to you?

294
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,670
Call her.

295
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,920
- You can not.
- Okay...

296
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,970
Mariana ...

297
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,550
Dad is waiting for you on the stairs.

298
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,730
When will it come back?

299
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,730
You have
an approximate idea of ​​the time?

300
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,070
It's general, everywhere.

301
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,700
If it rains?

302
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,030
No...

303
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,990
- Few drops.
- hardly a few drops.

304
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,950
They predicted a storm.

305
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,590
Try to arrange  a as soon as possible.

306
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,920
Be nice.

307
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,600
Thank you so much.

308
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,300
He said what?

309
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,560
It's raining.

310
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,760
Vicente!

311
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,770
- Open, it's Paco.
- I arrive.

312
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,770
crawling,
there is a world waiting for you.

313
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,990
- What is happening?
- You'll do me a favor.

314
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,780
I need two guys ...
Come on, it's not so late ...

315
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,830
We have to go to the domain
look for a generator.

316
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,870
- Now?
- Get away.

317
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,960
Thank you.

318
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,410
It's nothing at all,  a.

319
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,210
Irene?

320
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,430
Are you there?

321
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,230
Toin-toin!

322
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,980
Toin-toin!

323
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,780
Paco, come on!

324
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,440
It's the cry of the tanard ...

325
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,710
She's not here?

326
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,200
Where is she?

327
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,870
Why was it closed?

328
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,590
Irene!

329
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,270
What is it?

330
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,370
Stay with the little one, I'm coming.

331
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,560
Did you see Irene?

332
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,360
She went up to sleep.

333
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,200
Since then, no one has seen it?

334
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,460
My heart, I do not know where you are.

335
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,630
If it's a joke,
It hurt me a lot.

336
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,970
Call me back right away.

337
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,970
They must have fun.

338
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,480
Go see Laura and stay with her.

339
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,940
Paco ...

340
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,290
Felipe!

341
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,990
Come see!

342
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,700
Do you know where Irene is?

343
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,470
No. What is happening?

344
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,920
I only know
that she was not well.

345
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,960
You smoke?

346
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,100
- Tell me the truth.
- It is true.

347
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,220
Go take a ride,
try to find her.

348
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,770
Go get her, I tell you.

349
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,280
What's this?

350
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,240
It's a joke!

351
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,960
Laura received this message.

352
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,060
Irene would be able
to make a joke?

353
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,010
- When did it happen?
- At the moment.

354
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,260
- Did you call back the number?
- It's a masked number.

355
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,100
Where are you going?

356
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,730
If they removed it,
they are not far.

357
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,370
I'm coming with you.

358
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,370
What is happening?

359
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,050
I let him drive.

360
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,600
I drank too much.

361
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,720
Go for it.

362
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,220
Be careful.

363
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,530
What is happening?

364
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,770
A cable was cut,
we repair it. Move along.

365
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,150
Whore.

366
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,750
Where am I going?

367
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,300
We will not catch them.

368
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,760
Is the gendarmerie called?

369
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,770
Do something,
I beg you.

370
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,780
I do not want to scare you,
but newspapers on the bed

371
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,900
could mean

372
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,570
that it is
kidnappers of this girl.

373
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,200
Why did they kidnap him?

374
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,580
For money.

375
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,120
What did they do to him?

376
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,490
It may not be the same.

377
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,330
In fact, they had threatened ...

378
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,710
to kill the little
if the police were warned.

379
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,590
This is for  a
that you have to be very careful.

380
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,350
They killed him?

381
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,310
They killed him?

382
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,020
You will stay planted there
   do nothing?

383
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,000
Who saw it last?

384
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,080
We must ask Felipe.

385
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,080
He knows nothing.

386
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,670
Except she was tired

387
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,790
and that she went up to bed.

388
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,330
In fact, she was fine,

389
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,720
she had a drink

390
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,310
and all of a sudden ...

391
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,590
We would have put something
in his glass?

392
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,510
What?

393
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,980
Somnif re ...

394
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,610
They probably had an accomplice
   the party.

395
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,910
The current was cut
when she was upstairs.

396
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,820
We must call the gendarmerie.

397
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,360
Please.

398
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,040
No way. I do not want
to hurt him.

399
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,260
Rflchissons.

400
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,470
What else can be done?

401
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,000
Who has the video of the party?

402
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,640
- Who kept it?
- The video?

403
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,300
The young people of the center.

404
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,690
Who had the idea to invite
offenders?

405
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,600
Bea knows them.

406
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,780
Call them right away.

407
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,030
- 4:30 in the morning?
- It does not matter.

408
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,520
Bea had told you
that they would come to film?

409
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,730
She proposed, I accepted.

410
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,990
Why them?

411
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,650
They would not do that.

412
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,030
Paco.

413
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,000
What happened?

414
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,490
We know nothing.

415
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,130
Felipe ...

416
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,600
Did she tell you anything special?

417
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,680
Like what?

418
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,560
What she wanted us to do
a joke?

419
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,520
No.

420
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,280
You did not see anyone suspicious?

421
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,740
Not at all.

422
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,240
And the pickers?

423
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,940
Just something ...

424
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,860
We fell on the motorcycle, on the road.

425
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,540
We could not start again.

426
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,660
The pickers arrived
and helped us.

427
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,330
When was it?

428
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,000
Yesterday.

429
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,300
Anyway ...
it was not improvised.

430
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,560
They knew
that Laura and her children were coming

431
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,970
and they prepared everything.

432
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,690
Newspaper articles ...

433
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,370
the power failure.

434
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,160
Here, no one has seen them.
It's professionals.

435
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,200
Someone went up

436
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,120
put the newspapers on the bed.

437
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,590
A stranger must have entered here.

438
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,250
Not necessarily a stranger.

439
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,520
You have to rest, Laura.

440
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,200
Leave it alone.

441
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,910
Did you know this story?

442
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,790
It's been years.

443
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,290
It was in the corner?

444
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,470
Not far away.

445
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:08,960
Rest.

446
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,550
Let the parents decide
if they go to the police.

447
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,690
I am very scared for the little girl.

448
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,850
Less than his mother, anyway.

449
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,810
I should not help them?

450
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,900
You do not know if what you do
help or him night.

451
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,580
Let them do it.

452
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,650
And if it were your young people?

453
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,900
Why would it be them?

454
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,330
We come back. I'm falling asleep.

455
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,870
Remember your colleague.

456
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,920
His cell is off.

457
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,100
She will call me back.

458
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,890
We need this video.

459
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,670
The door is closed,
I can not do anything about it.

460
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:40,890
Open it, damn it!

461
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,150
I take care of it?

462
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,480
Sorry, we've awakened you.

463
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,240
It is not serious.
Is there a problem?

464
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,910
No nothing.

465
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,240
Looking for something?

466
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,190
I would like to know

467
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,530
if one of these three young

468
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,870
has a locker: Marcos, Abel ...

469
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,670
Small delights.

470
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,250
Resale of drugs, theft ...

471
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,260
Turn off the light and close the door,
please.

472
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,550
And do not say anything to young people.
Okay?

473
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,330
Do not let yourself go like that.

474
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,570
Return safe.

475
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,410
Everything will be alright.

476
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,540
We will take news.

477
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,500
Okay.

478
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,260
Come back soon.

479
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:04,390
Courage.

480
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,320
Did not you protect Alejandro?

481
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,730
You have to call him.

482
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,570
What will he do from there?

483
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:21,030
You have to decide
if we warn the police or not.

484
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,070
It's up to both of you to decide.

485
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,110
Ana ...

486
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,420
Hello, Laura.

487
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,530
Hello.

488
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,470
My family is leaving.

489
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,720
Irene ...

490
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,980
Irene, my treasure ...

491
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,360
Hello, my heart.

492
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,660
We're not going to breakfast?

493
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,380
Go with tata, I'm coming.

494
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,050
Hello.

495
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,050
Laura?

496
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,310
Call Alejandro,
let him come quickly.

497
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,520
Call him, please.

498
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,320
He can not stand it.

499
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,860
How to tell him?

500
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,120
You have to call him and talk to him,

501
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,670
including the threat

502
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,290
about the police.

503
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,380
Paco ...

504
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,670
Do not go.

505
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,440
I am here.

506
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,360
All?

507
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:09,780
Why do you say nothing?

508
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,030
Irene ...

509
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,750
Something happened to him
last night.

510
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,700
What happened to him?

511
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,830
My God, what's going on?
Where are you?

512
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,000
Do not Cry.
Tell me where you are.

513
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,480
There was plenty
of kids at the wedding,

514
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,700
why did they take my daughter?

515
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:55,670
It was the only one

516
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,830
whose father could pay
a ranon.

517
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,500
Where they come from
this stupid idea?

518
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,580
Why stupid?

519
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:06,430
Because it's wrong.

520
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,380
You always say
that you are doing well.

521
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,010
Given what he has paid
for the work of the church,

522
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,090
it's normal
that people think  a.

523
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,860
He has been unemployed for two years.

524
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,980
Mum...

525
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,060
What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

526
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,360
It's nothing, my dear.

527
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,870
Where is Irene?

528
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,110
Come on, we're going to breakfast.

529
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,280
He wants to talk to you.

530
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,010
Why did not you tell me before?

531
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,920
I could not believe it.
Even now ...

532
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,050
She has her medication?

533
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,100
Come quickly, please.

534
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,470
Come.

535
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:29,800
What?

536
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,840
Do you know them well, these guys?

537
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,050
Of course.

538
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,960
Why?

539
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,480
- What is happening?
- Look.

540
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,530
Whore.

541
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,840
When did it happen?

542
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,760
- When did it happen?
- Two minutes ago.

543
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,220
300,000 euros ...

544
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,750
Young people, do they have your number?

545
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,060
Everyone has it, in the center.

546
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,480
If it was them,
they would not have written to me.

547
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,600
- Why are you writing?
- I do not know.

548
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,070
You get too involved in everything  a.

549
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,060
What?

550
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,020
You are too involved ...

551
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,360
That's not the problem.

552
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,870
The problem is that I get it,
In the place of the mother.

553
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,110
The problem,

554
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,320
it's because you brought these guys.

555
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,740
That's the problem?

556
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,120
If you are so sure,
call the cops.

557
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,630
Did they give you the video?

558
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,050
Yes.

559
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,510
Laura, how's that?

560
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,940
costs ...

561
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,860
We received a message ...

562
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,480
Two minutes ago.

563
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,690
Oh?

564
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,280
What did he say?

565
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,660
Bea received the same.

566
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,030
Send it to me.

567
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,710
Okay.

568
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,800
I'm coming very soon.

569
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,870
She received the same?

570
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,300
Yes.

571
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,650
Forty years that you enjoy!

572
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,490
Strips of cons!

573
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,990
Go fuck yourself.

574
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,910
Above all, you are starving!

575
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,420
Call the police station.

576
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,490
Shut up, stupid.

577
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,330
CRVE-and-out!

578
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,120
You owe me all the money!

579
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:17,890
Dgage!

580
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,850
These lands are me!

581
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,880
All these lands are mine!

582
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,470
Should not play
your lands in poker!

583
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,510
Drunkard!

584
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,270
Be careful what you do!

585
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,240
What's the matter with you?

586
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,320
Crêve-la-faim band.

587
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:44,610
We come back.

588
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,410
Strip of thieves!

589
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,580
Dgage!

590
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,670
Licks me!

591
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:51,910
We come back.

592
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,990
Calm.

593
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:55,590
You will make me
all my lands.

594
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,040
What fly stung him?

595
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,000
I thought he was calm.

596
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,000
Why does he fall back on us?

597
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,510
He claims his lands
thirty years later!

598
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,190
Why do you let him drink?

599
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,520
Whether he drinks or not, he is the same.

600
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,640
One day, it's the cops
who will settle  a.

601
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,230
He says those bullshit
since always,   me, the first.

602
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,320
You are all disturbed, why?

603
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,240
For nothing. He drank.

604
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,240
That's all there is.

605
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:26,540
Nothing else.

606
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,410
You, I hold you back.

607
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:41,850
You have to drink
to the point of shame?

608
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,300
Do you care about our reputation?
Not me.

609
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,940
They owe me everything.
Where would they be without me?

610
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,310
Why are you going out now?

611
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,730
Because we need money
to save the little one.

612
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,820
Ah yes?

613
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,490
It's you who have all dilapidated!

614
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:00,490
It's enough!

615
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:01,690
It's not the moment.

616
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,190
For the sake of Irene,
we must avoid these scandals.

617
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,280
Are you going to dictate my conduct?

618
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:08,290
Its good.

619
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,460
Do not forget where you come from.

620
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,620
You're not at home.

621
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:17,420
You are walking here,
as if you were family.

622
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,960
Dtrompe up,
your parents were my servants.

623
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,830
Antonio, that's enough!

624
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,050
Let me talk.

625
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,480
If you do not like it,
shut your ears.

626
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,020
You owe me

627
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,390
even more than all the others.

628
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,980
You boast of your domain:
"My field"...

629
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,810
You owe it to me,
your domain.

630
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,820
You forced Laura ...

631
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,410
Let me talk.

632
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,490
You forced my daughter

633
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,570
To give you these lands.

634
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,620
Paco!

635
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,830
I forced you to sell your land?

636
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,840
- What?
- I forced you to sell?

637
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,300
Why are you talking about  a?

638
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,600
I bought them to help him.

639
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,510
Ah yes?

640
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,470
Yes.

641
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,970
At the price that suited you.

642
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,860
I was not bern'e.

643
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,160
Alejandro and me
We needed money.

644
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,740
Paco did not have enough.

645
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,420
I told him to give me
what he had. Including?

646
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,080
Do not take it badly. You know him.

647
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,790
Give  a   Laura. That she calls me.

648
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,460
I take you first
to see someone.

649
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,460
Who?

650
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:47,670
I'll tell you.

651
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,670
Can I keep the video?

652
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,050
No problem, I think.

653
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:27,180
No.

654
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,300
Show the messages.

655
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,560
Can we locate them?

656
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,430
In general, it's easy.

657
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,320
But they know how to hide.

658
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,910
They buy multiple SIM cards
with fake papers.

659
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,990
They send SMS

660
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,660
since old t l phones

661
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,920
that they destroy, with the map,
after each shipment.

662
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,870
But you still have to
show them to the police.

663
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,590
We have not decided yet
if we would prevent it.

664
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:16,140
As soon as the gendarmerie
will be informed of the disappearance,

665
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,630
she will intervene.

666
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:20,300
What should we do?

667
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,860
We must believe
What you are looking for

668
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,690
   to collect money.

669
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,030
How?

670
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,570
By soliciting your entourage.

671
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:33,330
Who could go out
such a sum?

672
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,000
We need to know
What you are looking for.

673
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,990
It will save you time.

674
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,460
How will they know?

675
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,080
They are watching you,

676
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,670
one way or another,
it's safe.

677
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,350
Do not talk about this meeting.

678
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,930
Not even to the father?

679
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,480
Can I see you alone?

680
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,680
Yes.

681
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,240
Fernando ...

682
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,830
he is reliable, what type?

683
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:16,830
Yes.

684
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:18,790
Why?

685
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,540
He will not talk?

686
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,670
No, he retired.

687
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,430
I made him swear.

688
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,640
They sent the second message
also   Bea.

689
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,100
Bea?

690
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,340
Paco's wife.

691
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,230
Since when do you know Paco?

692
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,070
We grew up in the same house.

693
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,350
Before I go,
we were together.

694
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:53,940
Together?

695
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:55,980
Yes, together.

696
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:57,910
Lover...

697
01:00:59,070 --> 01:00:59,860
And now?

698
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,790
Everyone lives his life.

699
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,380
It's over.

700
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,330
On good terms?

701
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,370
What can I do?

702
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:18,420
I try to understand
why his wife had the SMS.

703
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:19,210
Sorry...

704
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,880
Dad, I'm going there.

705
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:25,890
Okay.

706
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:27,440
Pay attention to yourself.

707
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,810
You too. I'll miss you.

708
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,110
You too.

709
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,940
- Call me when you arrive.
- Okay.

710
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,800
Do you always come without him?

711
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,800
No.

712
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,970
He could not come this time.

713
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,300
If I have something,
I call Fernando.

714
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,720
Thank you very much, Jorge.

715
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:05,900
Rest, I want to watch
the video together.

716
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,520
I'll bring you back.

717
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,150
Andrs!

718
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,810
There is someone?

719
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:15,690
Andrs!

720
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,650
Come, I'm in a hurry.

721
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,740
You'll stay a little,
after all this time.

722
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,750
- We'll taste it.
- No.

723
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,870
Do not you want to taste your wine?

724
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,490
What's the matter?

725
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:32,840
It does not seem to go.

726
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,160
I have a service to ask you.

727
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,170
I ask you, before refusing,

728
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,470
to think about it.

729
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:42,470
I always think
before talking.

730
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,260
I need money urgently.

731
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,060
For the vineyard?

732
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,690
No, it's personal.

733
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,980
Can you help me?

734
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,730
I thought.

735
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:03,730
It's no.

736
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:05,160
Okay.

737
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,170
I am ready to sell you my share.

738
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,290
Why, all of a sudden?

739
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,540
costs ...

740
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,870
This association, between us,

741
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,290
can not last.

742
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,220
We must find a good pear
who buys it all.

743
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,300
Yes, but I need liquid,
right now.

744
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,510
So, I sell you my part

745
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,890
   low price.

746
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:34,320
You did not even let buyers
visit the domain.

747
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,360
Eh yes.

748
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,700
Something happened?

749
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,910
Reflected on my proposal
and answer me as soon as possible.

750
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,830
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

751
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,780
Take a seat.

752
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,160
What is this money for?

753
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,080
Decides yourself. It's urgent.

754
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,300
Heard.

755
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,920
I'm going to think.

756
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,650
What's the matter?

757
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,490
What's wrong?

758
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,440
What's this?

759
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,990
When did you get it?

760
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:31,250
At the moment.

761
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:38,160
She does not have her medication on her.

762
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:47,260
Yes?

763
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,920
I'm with Laura.

764
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,220
You just received it?
Read it to me.

765
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,400
Hold on. Read it.

766
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,980
"Your daughter is bad.
She can not breathe anymore.

767
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,570
"Find the money
before she dies. "

768
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:05,870
She received the same.
I'll call you back.

769
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,380
I can not breathe.

770
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,340
- Is it okay?
- No.

771
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,130
Breathe.

772
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,960
Voil.

773
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,340
Do you want to go down?

774
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:28,560
J'touffe.

775
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,320
I told him:

776
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:49,990
"And my mother?"

777
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:53,450
She said:
"Prepare your bag softly

778
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,360
"and pull yourself."

779
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,170
That may be what she did.

780
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,740
Why would she do that?

781
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,450
I dunno.

782
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:06,760
Good evening.

783
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:07,790
Goodbye.

784
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,060
Whore...

785
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,680
Do you have something new?

786
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,550
We combed the videos,

787
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,230
nothing.

788
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:22,690
My friend says something
which makes sense to me.

789
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,060
What if we had not kidnapped him?

790
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,690
They had to come together, right?

791
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,450
Why Alejandro suddenly

792
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:32,940
changed your mind?

793
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,750
Laura said it was
for work.

794
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,420
He's been working for two years.

795
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:47,300
- What?
- He would have gone bankrupt.

796
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,010
Two years.

797
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:51,060
Whore...

798
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,550
Do not give up, Fernando.

799
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,220
How he would have climbed
from Argentina?

800
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,390
If the kid is wicked ...

801
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:06,030
He can send SMS from there.

802
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,190
If that was the case,

803
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,450
Laura would have suspected it
the first.

804
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,650
Laura, to doubt her husband?

805
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,870
I dunno...

806
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,590
You do not think it's weird
that they write to your wife?

807
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,840
It's weird.

808
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,200
I am very scared.

809
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,460
If something happens to him ...

810
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,730
Fernando is right.

811
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,270
We must call the gendarmerie.

812
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,980
If we do not do it,

813
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,810
what other choice do we have?

814
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,780
I would call the gendarmerie.

815
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,240
And the time they act,

816
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,790
how the little girl is going to survive
without his medication?

817
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:10,590
Do not worry.

818
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:13,910
God will help us.

819
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,380
Why did he make us?

820
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:19,390
Stop these nonsense.

821
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,920
You have to find the money.

822
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,190
How? They will steal it?

823
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,050
We have to wait.

824
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:32,900
Paco may be able to help us
for money.

825
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,410
A similar sum?

826
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,700
He spoke to his partner
to sell him his share.

827
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,250
Why would he do that?

828
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:59,340
He does not really do it.

829
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:03,220
He pretends
to make the noise run.

830
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:06,970
This is his idea?

831
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,720
We went to see
a friend of Fernando,

832
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,890
a cop at retirement,

833
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,860
to have his opinion.

834
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:19,650
He said we had to pretend
to collect money.

835
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:20,940
And after?

836
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:22,660
After ...

837
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,250
In two days or a week,

838
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,620
when they will know
that we do not have the money?

839
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,510
I dunno.

840
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,340
I do not know.

841
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,170
I can not think anymore.

842
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:17,790
Sorry to bring you here.
My friend prefers ...

843
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,830
Be careful.

844
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,960
- Where is he?
- In the car.

845
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,670
He's waiting for you. His name is Jorge.

846
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,720
Laura ... he wants to see him alone.

847
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,610
He's holding up.

848
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,060
He lets nothing appear.

849
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,370
He is suffering inwardly.

850
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,170
You have full confidence
in your husband?

851
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,050
What is that question?

852
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,430
He loves his children.

853
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,810
We run a risk
if we warn the police?

854
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,850
Even if the risk is minimal,

855
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,190
you have to stay very discreet.

856
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:32,240
They can investigate in secret,
without it being known?

857
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:38,700
Why you did not accompany
your family?

858
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:43,870
I had job interviews.

859
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,420
It went well?

860
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,850
Are you interested?

861
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,180
Everything interests me
to save your daughter.

862
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:59,230
- Did you find work?
- No.

863
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,270
Why?

864
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
Why...

865
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:05,700
Ask him
who did not take me.

866
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:07,160
Because of alcohol?

867
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:09,950
Who told you that?

868
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,000
It's been sixteen
I did not drink a drop.

869
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,090
According to your wife,
you are ruined.

870
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,870
So what?

871
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,930
The police will tell you that this act

872
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:29,760
was not committed by strangers.

873
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:31,350
Of course.

874
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,300
Since it's me.

875
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,350
It's his father.

876
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,110
Come on, let's go.

877
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:53,610
Who is it?

878
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:55,990
It's you?

879
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,410
You told all this con?

880
01:14:58,580 --> 01:14:59,540
Tell what?

881
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:02,170
Alcohol, unemployment,
Bankruptcy, everything!

882
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:04,250
It's not the moment, Alejandro.

883
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:14,140
It's my daughter!

884
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,640
Let me decide
what to do.

885
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,850
Tits of fuck!

886
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,270
Tits of fuck!

887
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,030
I spoke to him.

888
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:35,240
I thought that might help.

889
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:38,670
That would have helped her to know
I'm unemployed

890
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:39,670
and that I am ruined?

891
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:41,750
- What are you talking about?
- Answers!

892
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,240
Why would I suspect you?

893
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,840
- Did I say that?
- You insinuate it.

894
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,750
Why would I suspect you?

895
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,880
- Your whole family suspects me.
- What?

896
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,840
Did not you see their eyes this morning?

897
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,050
And these two!

898
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:56,020
They are all worried about your daughter
and you, you speak only of God.

899
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:58,020
It is normal that they suspect you!

900
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,330
Sleep a little.

901
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:26,000
How to sleep
without knowing where my daughter is

902
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,620
nor what can we do to him?

903
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:51,240
I hate myself
to do nothing.

904
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,280
We must prevent the police.

905
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:55,990
My love...

906
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,780
We can help him.

907
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,030
If you agree.

908
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:10,920
Paco could give us the money.

909
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,470
You said he was pretending.

910
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,640
He could do it.

911
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:24,730
Why would he do that?

912
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,230
Let me try.

913
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,270
Let me talk to him.

914
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,730
To tell him what?

915
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:42,290
I'm ready for anything
to find it.

916
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:45,080
No.

917
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:48,710
Think Irene.
We will lose our daughter.

918
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,700
He will not give it to you.

919
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,050
Maybe so.

920
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,920
If he refuses,

921
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,960
we will go to the gendarmerie.

922
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,680
He will not give you the money.

923
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,680
You'll tell him
and you will not get anything.

924
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,280
Please.

925
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,530
Please.

926
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:18,530
Please.

927
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:34,080
I asked
To hear the voice of my daughter.

928
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,550
They passed it to me.

929
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,560
She said
that she was not well.

930
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,190
Shortly after, they strangled her
and thrown into a well.

931
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:49,180
When the body has been found,

932
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,810
I could not recognize my daughter.

933
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,280
I said it was not her.

934
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,640
Paco ...

935
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,940
What are you doing here?

936
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,060
You're alone?

937
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,200
Yes.

938
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,320
He answered you?

939
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:42,660
Who?

940
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,280
Your partner.

941
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:48,330
No, no answer.
But the noise ran, that's good.

942
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,290
Yes, but...

943
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:58,680
you would be ready to sell really?

944
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:02,510
The domain?

945
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:03,710
Yes.

946
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:21,660
If everything happened to your child,

947
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,270
you would do nothing, either?

948
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,450
I do not know what to say.

949
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:36,370
This area has employees.
Families depend on it.

950
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,250
I know but...

951
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:56,980
You still have not forgiven me.

952
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:57,820
What?

953
01:20:58,150 --> 01:20:59,190
To have left you.

954
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:04,160
You never let me explain.

955
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,040
I do not want to talk about  a.

956
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:09,450
Not here.

957
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,860
Neither here nor anywhere.

958
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,790
I do not want to talk about it.

959
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:26,220
You remember my first return

960
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:28,590
after getting married in Argentina?

961
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,390
We had not seen each other
for three years.

962
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,400
I came alone.
You were not with Bea yet.

963
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:43,030
Do you remember?

964
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,270
Yes I remember.

965
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:47,280
From the last night too?

966
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,320
Yes too.

967
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,120
You took me to the airport.

968
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:01,040
We talked during the whole trip.

969
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:06,260
All of a sudden, you stopped.

970
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,100
You started crying in my arms.

971
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:14,760
You could not accept
for having lost me.

972
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:19,680
We went down.

973
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:22,730
You came near me.

974
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:24,950
You kissed me ...

975
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,540
If you seek revenge on me,

976
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,920
do not hurt the girl.

977
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,220
It's your daughter.

978
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:50,890
How?

979
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:02,720
No, do not make me.

980
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:07,660
It's your daughter.

981
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,470
Is it okay?

982
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,560
Yes.

983
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:02,090
What did she want, Laura?

984
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,050
Help.

985
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,380
You help them already.

986
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,790
Money.

987
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,670
- Why you?
- I dunno.

988
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:18,100
She thinks maybe
that she sold me the lands

989
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,600
too cheap.

990
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,100
After all this time?

991
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:58,100
Is it okay?

992
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,350
Come sit down.
Do you eat with us?

993
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,480
We had lunch.

994
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,890
- We come to the news.
- There is nothing, we wait.

995
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,670
Paco and I are very touched
by what you live.

996
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,180
We would like to help you
by all means.

997
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:39,880
But in fact,

998
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:42,130
we have the impression

999
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,730
to be considered
as indebted.

1000
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:49,230
As if it was our duty
to help you.

1001
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,270
It's not the moment.

1002
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,940
Everyone is there ...

1003
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,370
I want things
be clear.

1004
01:25:57,530 --> 01:25:58,700
Which things?

1005
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:01,150
What Bea means ...

1006
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,990
Let her talk.

1007
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,340
You have some suggestions
on these lands.

1008
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,380
Who, "you"?

1009
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,620
You all.

1010
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,500
We do not have any intentions.

1011
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,340
But we do not forget
how Paco bought them.

1012
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:19,930
It was worthless land.

1013
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:20,880
This is ...

1014
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:21,970
Yes.

1015
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,940
Paco and me,
we've had seven years,

1016
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,480
to get something out of it.

1017
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,180
- These lands are mine.
- They are   who works them.

1018
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:31,770
You will share them
with the pickers?

1019
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,200
- We did not come for  a.
- Me, yes.

1020
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,780
I hope that Irene ...

1021
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,440
will come back soon and we will
will end with these discussions.

1022
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:42,400
It's not because we say nothing
that everything's OK.

1023
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:46,320
I sold them at a low price

1024
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:49,330
to help a friend.

1025
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,380
But you needed money?

1026
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:52,580
It's enough.

1027
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:54,540
Sorry.

1028
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:04,140
I need it
somebody's money.

1029
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,090
Thank you.

1030
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,390
My daughter

1031
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:11,470
will come back.

1032
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:18,030
God will help us.

1033
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,370
Excuse me.

1034
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:45,210
- What did you tell him?
- All.

1035
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,930
We had sworn.

1036
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,310
Desolate, it's for the little girl.

1037
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:57,320
It is precisely for her
that we should not say anything.

1038
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:58,820
What did you do?

1039
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,610
It's for our daughter.

1040
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:04,330
You thought about his life?

1041
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:03,080
What's the matter?

1042
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,180
You did not have that before.

1043
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:10,170
Viewing.

1044
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:24,700
Have you seen what state you put yourself in?

1045
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,250
I will sell my share to Andr s.

1046
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,340
It was not a stratagem?

1047
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,920
I am terrorized for the little girl.

1048
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,430
Pay these people,
it's encouraging them to continue.

1049
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,380
You would not say that
if it was our daughter.

1050
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,260
Yes.

1051
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,270
If you were a mother,
you would be less sure of yourself.

1052
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,970
Luckily,
I never wanted to be a mother.

1053
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,270
It's my daughter.

1054
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:11,910
What did you say?

1055
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:13,650
It's my daughter.

1056
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,000
What are you saying?

1057
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:30,210
Have you gone mad?

1058
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,540
Do not touch me!

1059
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:58,570
- We'll talk.
- I do not want.

1060
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:00,340
Sit down, let's talk.

1061
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,710
I do not want.

1062
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:02,540
listen to me.

1063
01:31:02,710 --> 01:31:05,840
- I thought we were hiding nothing.
- I did not hide anything.

1064
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,380
Go away, I want to be alone.

1065
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:09,970
Laura told me yesterday.

1066
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:13,090
She tells you she's your daughter
and you believe it?

1067
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,300
We slept together
one last time ...

1068
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:18,970
And she fell pregnant!

1069
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,940
Do not you see they want money?

1070
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:25,320
It started with the domain

1071
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,310
you would not have paid enough.

1072
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,730
It did not work,
so they take out that lie.

1073
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:35,070
- Why a lie?
- And why not?

1074
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,820
They want no money.
Did not you hear it?

1075
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,090
What do you want him to say?

1076
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:44,630
He saves appearances.

1077
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:47,540
And his wife comes to tell you
that she is your daughter.

1078
01:31:49,090 --> 01:31:52,050
Why this marriage in the village,
you think?

1079
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:54,220
No one is getting married
   the countryside.

1080
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:57,480
They are all wicked!

1081
01:31:58,010 --> 01:32:00,720
You slept with her
one last time?

1082
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:04,180
And if the next day,
she slept with her husband?

1083
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,610
How do you know it's your daughter?

1084
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,480
Why is she telling you now?

1085
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:35,670
How can you be so naive?

1086
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,190
Laura is here?

1087
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,610
She's up there with Roc o,
Why?

1088
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,300
My little...

1089
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,460
The poor, where is she?

1090
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,440
Hello.

1091
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:27,770
Can you leave us alone?

1092
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,700
You lied to him?

1093
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:51,250
What subject?

1094
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,590
What you said   Paco ...

1095
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:01,230
I did not think he would tell you.

1096
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:11,230
If you try
to extract money from him

1097
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:13,520
with this lie,

1098
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:17,230
I'll have to tell your husband everything.

1099
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:21,860
It's not a lie.

1100
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:27,070
My husband knows.

1101
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:47,650
What is happening?

1102
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,180
Guys have heard in the village

1103
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:52,770
that you are going to sell the estate.

1104
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:54,990
Who will pay us?

1105
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:58,950
Do not listen to this bullshit.
I will pay you. Take the job again.

1106
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,090
Laura?

1107
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,300
Laura is here?

1108
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,170
She must be at the top, why?

1109
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,540
Someone wants to see her.

1110
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,560
Who?

1111
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,020
A friend of mine. Tell him to come down.

1112
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:32,530
Laura!

1113
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:33,570
New?

1114
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,310
Something is happening?

1115
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:43,120
It looks like you sold
the domain?

1116
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:46,620
Yes.

1117
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:53,080
It was closed.

1118
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:02,380
They did it for you to believe
that she was in

1119
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:05,670
and that you realize
later of the abduction.

1120
01:36:11,890 --> 01:36:13,810
- This is your son?
- Yes.

1121
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:17,990
He slept in the same room
that night?

1122
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:25,950
It's strange
that they did not take him away.

1123
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,120
It would have been less risky.

1124
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:31,870
A little sleeping is easier
   bring a teenager.

1125
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:37,170
So,
they had a reason to aim for it.

1126
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:38,080
Which?

1127
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:46,100
Fernando told me things
about your daughter.

1128
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:47,550
Which things?

1129
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:56,400
Someone knew
that it was not your daughter?

1130
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,320
Bea spoke to Fernando.

1131
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,670
I do not know.

1132
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:15,880
They are not professionals.

1133
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:20,220
But relatives
who hold this information.

1134
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:22,430
Nobody knew it until then.

1135
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:26,140
I'm not saying they did it
because she's Paco's daughter,

1136
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,590
for his money.

1137
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:30,810
But they wanted

1138
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,480
multiply their chances
to be paid.

1139
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,650
In other words,

1140
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:40,020
if you could not pay,
Paco would help you.

1141
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:47,080
When we decided

1142
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:49,620
to keep it,

1143
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:57,580
we promised ourselves
to not tell anyone.

1144
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:03,120
Be attentive to your surroundings.

1145
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:07,050
Try to find who knows.

1146
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:32,320
Take a seat.

1147
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,660
Is it true that he sold?

1148
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:45,430
Why?

1149
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:49,670
I dunno.

1150
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,050
People say what?

1151
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:53,100
What?

1152
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,180
Of the madness he commits.

1153
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:56,980
People are talking.

1154
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:00,310
Since they have nothing to do
in the village, they speak.

1155
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:06,150
What do they say?

1156
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,620
Do not do this
only for his child.

1157
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:18,660
And before?

1158
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:23,500
Fernando,

1159
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:26,540
please.

1160
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:33,010
At the beginning, there were suspicions.

1161
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:34,430
About my daughter?

1162
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,010
What suspects?

1163
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:41,180
Paco and Laura were together
long time.

1164
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,240
They say your daughter does things

1165
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:49,280
that make think Paco, small.

1166
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:50,810
One says?

1167
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:52,610
Who says it?

1168
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:55,540
- The family.
- But who?

1169
01:39:56,450 --> 01:39:57,530
Some...

1170
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,960
So, they know it.

1171
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,500
No one talked about it.

1172
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:12,850
But now
that Paco sold his estate ...

1173
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:14,010
Now...

1174
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:17,480
Everyone knows it.

1175
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:04,220
You still love her?

1176
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:09,140
It's for the little girl.

1177
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,440
It's not true.

1178
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:23,170
What if they did it themselves?

1179
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:28,380
I know what I'm doing.

1180
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:36,600
You do not know.

1181
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:18,380
- Who is this girl?
- The girlfriend of my son.

1182
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:23,230
They were there for one night.

1183
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:34,660
Alejandro ...

1184
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,580
I'm sure we'll find her.

1185
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:40,720
Whoever did  a
can not be far.

1186
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:59,860
I have money,
I received it today.

1187
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,160
All the money.

1188
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:06,990
Why are you doing this?

1189
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,960
Why am I doing this?

1190
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:14,840
If I did not do it
and something happened

1191
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:19,790
   Irene,

1192
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,850
I will never forgive myself.

1193
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:26,380
Why do not you forgive yourself?

1194
01:44:26,550 --> 01:44:28,300
You have no obligation
towards her.

1195
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:29,380
How?

1196
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:34,150
No obligation, you say?

1197
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,610
No, but it's my right.

1198
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,310
- Ah yes?
- Yes.

1199
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,070
Sixteen years have passed.
Sixteen years.

1200
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:50,240
And you tell me
when you need me?

1201
01:45:00,630 --> 01:45:03,010
Paco, I have to tell you something.

1202
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:13,060
The birth of Irene
saved my life.

1203
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,860
J'tais ...

1204
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:23,030
lost, drowned, destroyed by alcohol.

1205
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:27,950
I did not even go back
At home.

1206
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:34,840
A night of desperation,
I asked God:

1207
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:39,460
"Kill me or save me, my God."

1208
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:47,500
That night, I came back

1209
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:52,060
and Laura told me
that she was pregnant with you.

1210
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,530
I thought that was the end,

1211
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,020
that I had lost it,

1212
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:05,860
for good, really.

1213
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,860
But the opposite happened.

1214
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:15,820
God gave me a big shot
to make me react.

1215
01:46:16,330 --> 01:46:18,300
- God?
- Yes.

1216
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,680
Laura wanted to abort.

1217
01:46:26,170 --> 01:46:27,500
I did not know.

1218
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,880
I convinced her to keep it.

1219
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:36,220
God gave me this shot
to get me out of the shit.

1220
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:38,180
God?

1221
01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:40,320
My God.

1222
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:41,860
It's him

1223
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:44,350
who got me out of hell.

1224
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:49,020
I'm sure
that he will save her too.

1225
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:51,500
Your God will save Irene?

1226
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:55,860
Maybe he uses me
to save Irene.

1227
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,420
You saved it once,
this time it's me.

1228
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:12,630
I risk my daughter's life
for your pride of shit.

1229
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,470
What pride?
I have no more pride!

1230
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:18,400
You do not have any more pride?

1231
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:21,190
So, accept his help
for Save her.

1232
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:24,140
Your God would have done it already,
if he had wanted.

1233
01:48:55,450 --> 01:48:58,080
- What are you doing here?
- Tell him to come.

1234
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,160
- Did you follow?
- No, call him.

1235
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:07,380
You never had to come here.

1236
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:12,390
- How's my daughter?
- Well, but I can not continue.

1237
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:13,930
What's the matter?

1238
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:15,880
- We could follow her.
- Shut up.

1239
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:17,340
I want to hear it.

1240
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,560
We must stop.
My family is destroyed.

1241
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:20,880
What is happening?

1242
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:23,360
- Paco sold the estate.
- It's good.

1243
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,650
We must lick it.
They are suspecting the whole family.

1244
01:49:27,190 --> 01:49:28,280
And you?

1245
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:30,490
I do not know.
Tomorrow, they will discover everything.

1246
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:33,610
Tomorrow, it will be over.
Be quiet.

1247
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:35,160
I can not see them anymore.

1248
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:36,570
- Wait tomorrow.
- No!

1249
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:38,830
- Do not shit!
- Do not worry about it!

1250
01:49:40,030 --> 01:49:43,740
If we get caught,
we put you out of cause.

1251
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:45,240
Free it or I balance everything.

1252
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:47,620
- Wait until tomorrow morning.
- No.

1253
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:51,720
You can not say no
after all these galleys.

1254
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:53,640
- Where are you going?
- To prevent them.

1255
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,680
Hold on.

1256
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:55,720
- No.
- Hold on.

1257
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:58,090
I can not anymore.

1258
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,420
You promised to stay until the end.

1259
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,930
- I was wrong.
- It's too late.

1260
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:09,470
Let's separate for real,
instead of pretending.

1261
01:50:10,650 --> 01:50:12,820
Tomorrow it will be over, we will leave.

1262
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:14,230
We will be stopped.

1263
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:17,020
I want to touch this money,
cost.

1264
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,990
- Not me.
- We had an agreement.

1265
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,710
It was part of the agreement,
to write to Paco's wife?

1266
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,120
Did you do that?

1267
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:25,380
I did that.

1268
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:27,380
Send messages
without telling me about it?

1269
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:29,920
Write to one person only
It would have been fishy.

1270
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:32,960
- You're avenging my family.
- I hate them, these assholes.

1271
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:35,140
You will shut your mouth!

1272
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:37,720
Do not force me to say everything
   the girl.

1273
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,420
I beg you.

1274
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:42,670
Lchez it.

1275
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:45,100
I beg you.

1276
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:52,070
costs.

1277
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,730
- I'll release it.
- Right now.

1278
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:04,110
I can not in the middle of the night.

1279
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,570
- I'll do it at dawn.
- Promise it.

1280
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:07,420
Okay.

1281
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,590
On the life of our daughter.

1282
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:22,630
Swear it to me.

1283
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:29,640
I swear to you.

1284
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:49,960
I'll miss you.

1285
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:36,170
You put some, time.

1286
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:40,920
It was long.

1287
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:45,630
What did he tell you, the doctor?

1288
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:48,810
It's a virus.

1289
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:58,100
He gave you something?

1290
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,690
This is an interrogation?

1291
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,080
Why are your pants wet?

1292
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:26,840
Where were you?

1293
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:34,360
I had to stop on the road
to vomit.

1294
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:37,650
I washed my face
and I wet my pants.

1295
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:09,100
Save me.

1296
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:12,180
They will kill me today.

1297
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:13,970
You're welcome.

1298
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:17,520
Leave the money
   the place requested.

1299
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:19,310
I beg you.

1300
01:54:57,890 --> 01:55:01,680
You called the gendarmerie.
Your call can be recorded.

1301
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:40,870
There is someone?

1302
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:43,630
You hear me?

1303
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:50,340
The money is in the car,
but I want to see her first.

1304
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:52,510
I want to hear Irene.

1305
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:23,890
Is it okay?

1306
01:58:34,730 --> 01:58:36,980
I'm here, I'm with you.

1307
01:58:37,150 --> 01:58:38,230
How are you feeling?

1308
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,740
They did not do anything to you?

1309
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:01,560
I hurt you?

1310
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:22,660
My love!

1311
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:18,250
Speak to mom, please,
my heart.

1312
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:19,420
Thank you.

1313
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:25,470
Did you give them the money?

1314
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:33,930
Thank you.

1315
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,600
I will return it to you.

1316
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:42,490
Take her to see a doctor.
She looks weak.

1317
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,360
I love you, my beauty.

1318
02:00:49,370 --> 02:00:50,500
Look at me.

1319
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:13,810
Thank you.

1320
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:45,510
Mariana!

1321
02:01:51,850 --> 02:01:53,100
They found Irene!

1322
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:23,460
Bea?

1323
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:09,350
Laura?

1324
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:10,760
Irene?

1325
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:12,100
Right here!

1326
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:26,700
My love.

1327
02:04:57,830 --> 02:05:00,120
- I will help you.
- Thanks, Joan.

1328
02:05:00,290 --> 02:05:01,170
Given.

1329
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:04,040
- We have to hurry up.
- Why?

1330
02:05:04,210 --> 02:05:06,800
We must make the car
At the airport.

1331
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:15,250
My dear, do not go down alone.
Wait for me, okay?

1332
02:05:18,430 --> 02:05:20,770
His medicines, where are they?

1333
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:23,150
In my bag.

1334
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:25,260
Very good.

1335
02:06:04,270 --> 02:06:06,940
Tell me when you arrive.
I'll call you.

1336
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:23,280
Dad...

1337
02:06:24,290 --> 02:06:25,460
Yes, my heart?

1338
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:28,740
Why it's Paco
who came to get me?

1339
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:51,640
Goodbye.

1340
02:06:52,650 --> 02:06:54,410
Have a nice trip.

It's cold,
we go home.

1347
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:03,630
Fernando ...

1348
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:18,980
Take a seat.
