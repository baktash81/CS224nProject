AN ACCIDENT, O.K.?

193
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,811
IT WAS NOBODY'S FAULT.

THEY'RE GOING TO MARRY,

352
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,503
AND IT'S BUNK.

353
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,922
WHAT A FINE HAND
HE HAS.

354
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,426
DR. STONE?

355
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,137
DR. STONE.

356
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,848
DR. STONE.

357
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,965
AHH...AHH...

358
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,391
OHH...GOD.

359
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,776
OW. OW. SHIT.

360
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,002
[BELCHES]

361
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,420
OH, GOD.

362
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:09,861
HELLO.

363
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,240
UH...HI.

364
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,617
GOOD MORNING.

365
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,119
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

366
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,120
UH, NO.

367
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,496
NO, NO.

368
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,580
UM...

369
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,332
I'M A DOCTOR.

370
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,918
YEAH,
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

371
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,338
UH, HEY, I'M SORRY.

372
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,840
WOULD YOU--CAN--

373
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,341
DO YOU WANT THIS?

374
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,843
IF YOU'RE A DOCTOR,

375
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,929
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.

376
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,482
YOU CAN BLINK NOW.

377
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,364
THE BOYS FROM THE STATE
LEGISLATURE COME HERE,

378
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,866
DO THEIR RECREATING.

379
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,659
BOY, CAN THEY LITTER.

380
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,036
YUP, PRESIDENTS
COME HERE

381
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,537
DURING
THE FISHING SEASON.

382
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,247
ON PURPOSE?

383
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,750
LOOKING AT ALL THIS,
BEN, BOY,

384
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,084
I'M SURE
YOU'RE THINKING,

385
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,335
"I'VE COME TO GRADY

386
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,880
AT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
TIME OF THE YEAR."

387
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,548
BUT BOY, THESE
DOGWOODS, AZALEAS,

388
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,884
WHEN THEY BLOOMING,
THEY CAN'T HOLD A CANDLE

389
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,385
TO THE NUCLEAR
EXPLOSION OF COLOR

390
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,428
COME FALL.

391
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,888
LOOK, NICK,
YOU'RE THE MAYOR.

392
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,849
YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY
TO COMMUTE MY SENTENCE.

393
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,350
COULD YOU DO THAT?

394
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,352
I'LL MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE.

395
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,229
I GET BACK TO L.A.,
WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT.

396
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,690
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

397
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,525
HOW'M I GONNA CONVINCE
YOU TO STAY HERE

398
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,152
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE?

399
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,990
WE NEED A DOCTOR,
YOU NEED PATIENTS.

400
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,786
GET OFF THE INTERSTATE,
BEN STONE.

401
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:41,912
HMM?

402
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,246
RIGHT, HUH?

403
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,918
DON'T LET THE SIGNS
OF PROSPERITY

404
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:48,919
AND URBAN SPRAWL

405
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,128
HERE IN DOWNTOWN
SCARE YOU.

406
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,089
WE'RE STILL THE SLEEPY
LITTLE PARADISE

407
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,091
THAT MANY BIG-CITY
SHRINKS RECOMMEND

408
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,093
FOR THEIR PATIENTS
WITH NERVOUS DISORDERS.

409
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,427
IT'S THE CALMING EFFECT

410
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,929
OF GRADY'S
NATURAL OZONES.

411
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,388
THERE'S A WORLD-CLASS
MENTAL HOSPITAL

412
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,598
JUST UP THE ROAD.

413
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,766
Ben: THAT'S A
COMFORTING THOUGHT.

414
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,434
BEN STONE, DO
YOU LIKE COFFEE?

415
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,853
IF YOU LIKE COFFEE,
WE WON'T GO IN HERE.

416
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,481
IS THAT HIM?

417
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,482
THAT'S HIM.

418
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,067
HE'S YOUNG, HUH?

419
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,490
BOYS, THIS HERE
IS BEN STONE,

420
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,866
THE HOLLYWOOD PHYSICIAN

421
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,910
WHO'S GOING TO BE SPENDING
A FEW DAYS WITH US.

422
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,788
BEN, THIS HERE'S
MORTIMER, JOHN, AUBREY.

423
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,748
PROBABLY DON'T WANT
TO SHAKE HIS HAND.

424
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,083
SORTY
IN THE CORNER THERE

425
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,876
GOT A COW
THAT SINGS.

426
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,378
YOU REMEMBER COTTON,
MISS LILLIAN.

427
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,630
HOLLYWOOD...
LA-LA LAND.

428
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,132
BEVERLY HILLS,
ACTUALLY.

429
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,134
WHATEVER. WILLIAM'S
BEEN A MOVIE STAR.

430
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,636
AUBREY, IT WAS JUST
AN ARMY TRAINING FILM.

431
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,138
YOU WERE THE STAR.

432
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,514
YOU PLAYED
THE LEADING ROLE.

433
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,933
IT WAS ABOUT VD.
I WAS THE BACTERIA.

434
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,935
HAD A BIG SCENE
WITH PENICILLIN.

435
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,103
MMM, YES.

436
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,604
A DEATH SCENE.

437
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,106
TAKE A LOAD OFF,
DOCTOR.

438
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,607
THIS WILL STOP
YOUR WORRIES.

439
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,151
OR START THEM.

440
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,696
DOC, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF OUR TOWN?

441
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,698
I HAVEN'T
SEEN IT ALL YET.

442
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,575
OH, YEAH, YOU HAVE.

443
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,076
OPPORTUNITY
ABOUNDS HERE.

444
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,579
THE GROWTH RATE
WAS UP .3% LAST YEAR.

445
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,080
THERE'S NO CRIME.

446
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,623
WE ARE
THE COUNTY SEAT.

447
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,084
NO POINT IN BEATING
A DEAD HORSE TO DEATH.

448
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,502
THAT'S ALL
IN THE BROCHURE.

449
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,795
BEN STONE...

450
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,797

451
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,299

HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,985
LOOK, YOU PEOPLE
DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

461
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,486
I NOTICED RIGHT OFF

462
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,988
HE DOUBLE-KNOTS
HIS SHOELACES.

463
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:40,989
EXCELLENT
CREDENTIALS.

464
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,574
SHOWS HE'S CAREFUL.

465
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,118
ANYWAY, DON'T YOU
ALREADY HAVE A DOCTOR?

466
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,621
WE GOT HOGUE. THE
PROBLEM WITH HOGUE IS...

467
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,622
HE'S OLD.

468
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,165
OLD AND WHOLLY
UNPLEASANT.

469
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,209
HE WON'T
BE AROUND FOREVER.

470
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,752
35,000?

471
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,420
THAT TAKES
A UNANIMOUS VOTE

472
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,546
OF THE CITY COUNCIL.

473
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,881
ALL IN FAVOR
SAY AYE.

474
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,382
Men: AYE.

475
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,383
I ABSTAIN.

476
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,885
YOU ALWAYS ABSTAIN.

477
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,096
LOOK, I APPRECIATE
YOUR PROBLEM...

478
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,225
B-BUT I'M NOT THE ANSWER.

479
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,269
I GOT A BIG JOB INTERVIEW
ON THE WEST COAST.

480
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,772
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
I GET THERE SOON.

481
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,232
PLASTIC SURGERY,
YOU KNOW?

482
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,234
THE TRUTH IS,
THEY COULD PROBABLY PAY ME

483
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,194
ABOUT 20 TIMES
WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD.

484
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,695
THERE'S LOTS
OF SIMILARITIES

485
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,405
BETWEEN GRADY
AND LOS ANGELES.

486
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,907
THEY'RE
JUST BIGGER.

487
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,408
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

488
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,576
1 0 BUCKS.

489
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,120
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE
AND SOME TOAST?

490
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,330
GOTCHA.

491
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,624
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT
TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND

492
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,125
TILL AFTER
THE SQUASH FESTIVAL?

493
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,627

[TIME CLOCK RINGS]

505
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,284

HOW DO YOU PROPOSE

778
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,383
THEN I COULD TRADE HIM

779
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,219

00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,849
NO, SIR.
I APOLOGIZE.

783
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,310
HOW LONG WILL THIS GUY

WAIT A MINUTE.

813
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,370
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING

00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,038

THANK GOD.

YOU DON'T LIKE GRADY?

818
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,254

827
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,282
NO, BUT YOU

828
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,075

00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,536

00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,565

AND I PLAN
TO PRACTICE IN GRADY

847
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:16,781

PROGRAM.

864
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,197

OR ARE YOU
TOO CHICKEN?

868
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,374
DR. STONE,
I READ THAT DOCTORS

869
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,875
HAVE THE HIGHEST
SUICIDE RATE

870
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,877
IN ANY PROFESSION
EXCEPT FOR DENTISTRY.

871
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,337
NOW, IS THAT TRUE?

872
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:14,839
I WON'T UNDERWRITE
DENTISTS.

873
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,340
NEVER TRUST A MAN

874
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,759
WHO'LL PUT HIS HAND
IN YOUR MOUTH.

875
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,302
WELL,

00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,269
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

879
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,731
DO DOCTORS KNOW
MORE ABOUT...SEX

880
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,608
THAN NORMAL PEOPLE?

881
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,654

00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,681
YOU KNOW, I JUST
CAN'T PICTURE YOU

1061
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,182
IN THE BIG CITY.

1062
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,767
IN NEW YORK.

1063
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,311
GOD,
THAT'S LIKE ME...

1064
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,937
IN GRADY?

1065
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,606
YEAH.

1066
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,567
WELL, PEEL AN ONION,
THERE'S LOTS OF LAYERS.

1067
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,195
WHAT LAYER IS
HANK ON?

1068
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,033
HENRY GORDON'S
SWEET ON ME,

1069
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,993
AND HE'S PRETTY
DECENT AND SOLID

1070
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,620
ONCE YOU GET PAST

1071
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,664
THE "INSURANCE REBEL
WITHOUT A CLAUSE" ROUTINE.

1072
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,625
DECENT AND SOLID.

1073
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,961
VERY ROMANTIC.

1074
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,424
I CAN SEE YOU COMING

1075
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,926
FROM HALF A MILE
AWAY, DR. STONE,

1076
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,928
YOU AND YOUR
SLICK CITY WAYS.

1077
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,431
I SUSPECT YOUR
VERSION OF ROMANCE

1078
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,433
IS WHATEVER WILL
SEPARATE ME

1079
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:47,893
FROM MY PANTIES.

1080
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,896
HEY, HEY, LOOK.

1081
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,398
ALL I'M TALKING
ABOUT IS DINNER.

1082
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,401
YOU KNOW, IN PUBLIC.
WEAR A DRESS.

1083
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,944
PANTIES
ARE OPTIONAL.

1084
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,115
WELL, I NEVER HAVE
HAD DINNER

1085
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:04,284
AT THE MAYOR'S HOUSE.

1086
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,452
OH, BOY.

1087
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:06,953
AND AFTER ALL,

1088
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,456
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY
REFUSE THE MAN

1089
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:12,000
WHO SAVED JASMINE
FROM THE BUTCHER?

1090
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,962
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1091
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,214
TIDWELL'S PIG.

1092
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,342
HE WAS ABOUT TO SELL HER
FOR PORK CHOPS,

1093
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,260
YOU HADN'T FIXED HIS FOOT,
MADE HIM FEEL GUILTY.

1094
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,096
EMMA LOVES PIGS.

1095
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,765
YOU KEEPING HER
OVER AT YOUR HOUSE?

1096
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:27,849
[GLASS BREAKS]

1097
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,145
LANE.

1098
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,440
LANE! LANE,
WHERE'S MELVIN?

1099
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,441
WHERE'S MELVIN?

1100
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,443
I WANT MY PIG
BACK.

1101
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:41,446
[STATIC] MELVIN'S NOT HERE,
DOC. HE'S AT CHURCH.

1102
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,365
DID YOU SAY HE
WENT TO CHURCH?

1103
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,533
AT THIS HOUR?

1104
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,243
A BIG REVIVAL MEETING
IN TYLERVILLE.

1105
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,704
ARE YOU ALLOWED
TO COME OUT HERE?

1106
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:49,705
'CAUSE I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND

1107
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,498
WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE SAYING.

1108
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:52,958
MELVIN'S
GONE TO CHURCH.

1109
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,459
HE'S GONE TO TYLERVILLE.

1110
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,713
THE PIG? SHE GOT TOOK
TO THE BUTCHER.

1111
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,841
MELVIN TOOK MY PIG
TO THE BUTCHER?

1112
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,301
WHAT?

1113
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,811
AH, MR. CRAWFORD.
WHERE'S MY PIG?

1114
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,312
YOU KNOW,
JASMINE, MY PIG.

1115
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,814
IS SHE STILL ALIVE?

1116
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,816
OH, YES.
SHE'S IN BACK.

1117
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,318
THANK GOD.
I WANT HER BACK.

1118
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,820
WELL, DOC--

1119
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,322
I KNOW. FAIR ENOUGH.
TAKE PLASTIC?

1120
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,325
NOT UNLESS IT'S
WRAPPED AROUND SOME CASH.

1121
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,828
LET'S WORK IT OUT
IN TRADE.

1122
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,037
I DON'T KNOW.

1123
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:34,416
I AIN'T BEEN SICK
IN THREE YEARS, DOC.

1124
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,543
I GOT AN IDEA.

1125
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:46,511
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO CARVE LIKE THAT?

1126
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,597
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
WITH A KNIFE.

1127
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,019
YO!

1128
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,020
HEY, MADDIE.

1129
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,188
HI, DOC.

1130
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,523
SO YOU GUYS ARE
PIG-SITTING FOR ME?

1131
00:46:58,733 --> 00:46:59,524
UH-HUH.

1132
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,026
WHOA! WHO ARE YOU?

1133
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,194
DON'T TEASE ME.

1134
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:05,030
YOU LOOK LIKE LOU,
BUT MUCH PRETTIER.

1135
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,031
I'M WARNING YOU.

1136
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,033
I COULD WHUP YOU
IN A FIGHT.

1137
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,034
ALL RIGHT.

1138
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,535
BE A GOOD GIRL.

1139
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,536
O.K. BYE.

1140
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,039
WAIT.
BE A GOOD GIRL.

1141
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,500
NOT TOO MUCH TV
FOR HER, O.K.?

1142
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,168
SHE'S A REAL PIG
ABOUT THAT.

1143
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,673
HI! COME ON IN.

1144
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:24,674
WELCOME.

1145
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,676
OH, YOU LOOK
FANTASTIC!

1146
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,720
AND YOU LOOK
HANDSOME, TOO.

1147
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,305
DADDY'S
IN THE BACKYARD

1148
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,724
TENDING HIS FIRE STORM
IN THE BARBECUE.

1149
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,226
SO YOU'RE NICK'S
DAUGHTER.

1150
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,728
GOSH, I HOPE SO.
I'M IN HIS WILL.

1151
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,772
HEY, Y'ALL,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

1152
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,233
HELLO, LOU.

1153
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,400
HELLO, STONE.

1154
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,528
CHECK HOLLYWOOD
FOR KNIVES.

1155
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,988
I DON'T WANT HIM
OPERATING ON ME

1156
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,241
IN CASE I SNEEZE
OR SOMETHING.

1157
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,577
ISN'T THIS GOING
TO BE FUN?

1158
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,540
OH, NO, THANK YOU.
I'M A VEGETARIAN.

1159
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,042
I KNOW, DEAR,
BUT I'M STILL HOPEFUL.

1160
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:00,418
SO AM I.

1161
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,419
UH, VEGETARIAN.

1162
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:02,462
OH, SINCE WHEN?

1163
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,674
THEN HAVE SOME OF THIS SQUASH,
BEN STONE. DON'T BE SHY.

1164
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,926
I'M NOT SURE
I TRUST A MAN

1165
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,511
WHO DOESN'T
EAT MEAT.

1166
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,096
DON'T BE
SO PROVINCIAL.

1167
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,223
WHERE'S YOUR SENSE
OF ADVENTURE?

1168
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,933
PROBABLY GIVE
VEGETARIANS

1169
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,268
BETTER LIFE
INSURANCE RATES

1170
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:17,435
THAN A SMOKER,
THOUGH.

1171
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,105
ON ACCOUNT OF THAT
LOWER CHOLESTEROL.

1172
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,107
DADDY, PLEASE.
NEW SUBJECT.

1173
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,485
WE WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT
CALIFORNIA.

1174
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:27,612
I HEARD THAT
THE WOMEN OUT THERE

1175
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,281
HAVE THEIR CHESTS
ENLARGED,

1176
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,448
THEIR THIGHS
VACUUMED,

1177
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:31,741
AND BARF ON PURPOSE.

1178
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,743
NOT WHILE PEOPLE
ARE EATING.

1179
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,831
YEAH, TELL US ABOUT
REAL DOCTORING.

1180
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,875
YOU KNOW,
BIG-CITY MEDICINE.

1181
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,377
SO MUCH HAS CHANGED
IN THE 40 YEARS

1182
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,379
SINCE YOU WENT
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

1183
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,381
I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO START.

1184
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,675
SMART ASS.

1185
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,010
[HANK]
GOT YOU GOOD.

1186
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,511
MORE SQUASH, BEN?

1187
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:53,430
NO. I MEAN,
NO, THANK YOU.

1188
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,267
"OUT OF THE CRADLE...

1189
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,686

1193
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,529
IS THIS ONE
OF THE LONG ONES?

1194
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:10,614
NO.

1195
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,658
LONG ONES?

1196
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:17,996
DOC HOGUE DOES
THE COMPLETE WALT WHITMAN

1197
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,123
IF YOU DON'T
MONITOR HIS DRINKING.

1198
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,418
"DOWN FROM
THE SHOWERED HALO,

1199
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:27,714
UP FROM THE MYSTICAL
PLAY OF SHADOWS."

1200
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,093
MAN, I HAVEN'T
SEEN THIS MANY STARS

1201
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,762
IN A LONG TIME.

1202
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,598
I USED TO GET SO BORED
IN THIS TOWN,

1203
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,099
I'D TRY TO COUNT THEM.

1204
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,769
I COULD HAVE GONE
TO MED SCHOOL.

1205
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,103
JUST
THE SCIENCE PART

1206
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,564
I WOULD HAVE HAD
A PROBLEM WITH.

1207
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:45,941
I'D LIE ON MY BACK.

1208
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,734
SOMETIMES WAYNE
WOULD BE ON TOP OF ME

1209
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:49,110
DOING THE WILD THING.

1210
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,445
IT WAS HARD
NOT TO LOSE MY PLACE.

1211
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,822
GOD, THAT'S ROMANTIC.

1212
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,282
THEN WE MOVED
TO MANHATTAN.

1213
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,784
YOU COULD HARDLY
SEE STARS,

1214
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,160
LET ALONE
COUNT THEM.

1215
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:00,288
STARS I'D LIKE TO SEE
ARE THE TWO-LEGGED KIND.

1216
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,831
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE
IS SOMETHING

1217
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,792
I'M KEEN
TO TAKE A WHACK AT

1218
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,210
OUT THERE IN L.A.

1219
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,212
TALK ABOUT
YOUR NO-BRAINER.

1220
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,214
COLLECT PREMIUMS FOR
A GAZILLION YEARS,

1221
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,716
AND IF THE BIG ONE
EVER DOES HIT,

1222
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,636
DECLARE BANKRUPTCY
AND RETIRE.

1223
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,390
DECENT AND SOLID.

1224
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:19,891
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

1225
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,394
Mayor: HANK, YOU GOT
TO TAKE HOGUE HOME.

1226
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,562
HE'S ABOUT TO LAUNCH
INTO SONG OF MYSELF.

1227
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,940
MY LORD.

1228
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,943
Mayor: NEVER A DULL
MOMENT, EH, BEN STONE?

1229
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,444
I'LL CALL YOU LATER,

1230
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,989
MAKE SURE
YOU GOT HOME O.K.

1231
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,841
GOOD NIGHT.

1769
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:49,779
