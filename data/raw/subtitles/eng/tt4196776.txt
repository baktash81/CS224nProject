1
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,230
I remember.

2
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,360
I remember everything.

3
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,060
Captain Webb. Good morning.

4
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,990
Has everything been explained to you?

5
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,450
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,650
When we are finished with you, you will no longer be David Webb.

7
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

8
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,380
You knew exactly what it meant for you if you chose to stay.

9
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,630
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.

10
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,930
You made yourself into who you are.

11
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,590
Eventually you're gonna have to face the fact.

12
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,800
You volunteered.

13
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,850
Christian Dassault made a reservation.

14
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,280
Heather Lee.

15
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,380
Ma'am, we have a device issued to a stay-behind team

16
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,550
in Novosibirsk, Russia, in 1993.

17
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,250
Marked on our inventory as destroyed.

18
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,920
It's knocking on our front door.

19
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,290
What's the status?

20
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,510
Whoever it is, is just sitting there idle.

21
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,750
There's no outbound traffic, nothing.

22
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,380
Move.

23
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,170
They've found a back door.

24
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,920
We need the reverse shell. I'm gonna locate the source.

25
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,020
I'm working on it.

26
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,090
Okay, people, we have a major breach of our classified mainframe.

27
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,230
Drop everything you're doing, get on it right now!

28
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,580
Ma'am, I'm sending you the shell.

29
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,790
Got it.

30
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,420
- Need it right now?
- Yeah.

31
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,920
- Getting IP.
- Where's that traceroute?

32
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,650
Unknown user. Monitoring.

33
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,490
Reykjavik.

34
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,470
SecOps hacking camp.

35
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,760
Kill the power to the building.

36
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,390
Get into that power grid now.

37
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,540
Yes, sir.

38
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,250
- I've got the power to the building.
- Stand by.

39
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,010
- Ten seconds.
- Let's get on top of this.

40
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,060
- Shut it down.
- Copy that. Shutting it down.

41
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,550
Dewey.

42
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,930
We've just been hacked.

43
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,500
How badly?

44
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,230
Could be worse than Snowden.

45
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,440
Is there any attribution?

46
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,630
We're working on it.

47
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,880
Lee says it must be someone with a deep knowledge of our systems.

48
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,690
This could affect Deep Dream, and Iron Hand.

49
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,570
I want a briefing in my conference room in one hour.

50
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,130
Yes.

51
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,330
- Did you get confirmation?
- Yeah, there was a hack.

52
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,240
So are we exposed?

53
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,170
We don't know yet. We're checking.

54
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,830
I want you to call Dewey. Set up a meet in DC.

55
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,040
Aaron, we got a lot at stake here,

56
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,480
- maybe we shouldn't rock the boat.
- Just do it.

57
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,480
Hey, George. We ready for the launch?

58
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,070
Heather, you know the Director of National Intelligence?

59
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,040
Heather Lee, Cyber Ops, sir.

60
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,580
Have you got a name for us?

61
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,060
The hacker was a former Agency operative.

62
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,330
Believed to be working with Christian Dassault,

63
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,810
and previously linked to Jason Bourne.

64
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,570
Bourne?

65
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,150
- Jesus Christ.
- What did they get?

66
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,010
Black-ops files.

67
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,780
From Treadstone all the way to Iron Hand.

68
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,350
Iron Hand?

69
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,480
But that's not even operational yet, for Christ's sakes.

70
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,330
Where is Nicky Parsons right now?

71
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,980
On the move.

72
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,580
She left Reykjavik, traveling through Bucharest to Athens.

73
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,630
Feels like a meet to me.

74
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,760
Well, how are you going to handle it?

75
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,930
We cut the head off this thing.

76
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,690
Sir, I'd like to be point on this operation.

77
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,680
You're not indoctrinated for this material.

78
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,010
I'm already into it.

79
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,990
I embedded malware into Parsons' download.

80
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,370
When those files are opened, I can trace them.

81
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,790
Let me in.

82
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,690
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,

83
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,800
and, if he's out there, I'll give you Bourne, too.

84
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,970
Excuse me.

85
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,850
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

86
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,280
but do not push your personal agenda to the DNI again.

87
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,260
Understood.

88
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,820
All right. I think you can help me.

89
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,120
I'm going to give you full operational control on this,

90
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,270
and I will make sure you have access to

91
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,560
any relevant teams and resources.

92
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,250
And I want to know every move you make.

93
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,710
Yes, sir.

94
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,170
Thank you very much, sir.

95
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,860
Yeah?

96
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,660
I need your help, now.

97
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,750
I'm not finished here.

98
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,170
Jason Bourne is in play.

99
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,570
- Where?
- Athens.

100
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,010
Close your account in Rome.

101
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,160
Understood.

102
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,760
Lee got a hit from a CCTV feed.

103
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,480
Parsons boarded a bus a half-hour ago, headed west across Athens.

104
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,140
I got two local teams en route.

105
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,600
- Any sign of Bourne?
- Not so far.

106
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,420
He's involved in this somehow. I can feel it.

107
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,570
Upload all Athens data and feeds,

108
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,830
and activate real-time processing.

109
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Copy that.

110
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,300
Where are we?

111
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,890
Parsons' bus has just arrived at Syntagma Square.

112
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,290
There's a demonstration

113
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,000
in front of the Greek parliament building.

114
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,440
I think she'll use it as cover.

115
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,110
Deploy Alpha and Bravo to the square.

116
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,170
Recon for Parsons in the crowd outside parliament,

117
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,230
and any possible rendezvous points.

118
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,480
Copy that, sir.

119
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,570
Sir, the Asset has landed.

120
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,440
Alpha Team arriving now.

121
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Copy that.

122
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,950
I have the Alpha Team feeds.

123
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,190
Pull them up.

124
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,410
Athens police are reporting

125
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,280
tactical teams moving on the demonstrators.

126
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,950
Isolate all social-media posts from the square.

127
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,130
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,780
Rewind Alpha One's feed.

129
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,910
- Yes, ma'am.
- Twenty seconds.

130
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,130
All right, Bravo Two, Four, moving in.

131
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,720
What's wrong?

132
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,480
I hacked the Agency.

133
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,000
For Christian Dassault.

134
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,400
I got all the black-ops files.

135
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,110
We're putting them online.

136
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,320
We need to move.

137
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,610
Stop.

138
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,030
Two seconds forward.

139
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,520
Blonde hair.

140
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,990
Enhance.

141
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,420
Find her.

142
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,230
Nicky Parsons sighted in Syntagma Square.

143
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,530
Redirect south on Stadiou.

144
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,580
I told you, Christian Dassault is going to get you killed.

145
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,200
We don't have a choice, Jason.

146
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,630
It's started again. A new program.

147
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,460
Iron Hand. It's even worse than before.

148
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,170
What's that got to do with me?

149
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,290
Because it matters. It matters.

150
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,060
Not to me, it doesn't.

151
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,920
All that matters is staying alive.

152
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,380
You get off the grid, survive.

153
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,760
I don't believe that and neither do you.

154
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,830
Look at yourself.

155
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,760
Look at what you're doing.

156
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,410
You can't live like this for much longer.

157
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,860
Jason, I came here because I found something.

158
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,250
I found your father's name in the Treadstone files.

159
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,980
He was an analyst.

160
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,740
He wasn't in Operations. He wasn't near any of that stuff.

161
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,370
I'm telling you what I saw.

162
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,640
It looked like he was involved directly.

163
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,490
And there's more.

164
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,620
More about you.

165
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,730
What do you mean?

166
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,520
Before you joined the program, they were watching you.

167
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,550
Watching me?

168
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,400
You've tortured yourself for a long time now, Jason.

169
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,090
You torture yourself for what you've done.

170
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,930
But you don't know the truth about what they did to you.

171
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,330
You need to read those files.

172
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,420
Move. They tracked you.

173
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,820
Alpha One has eyes on two targets. One female, one male.

174
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,900
Identify the male.

175
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,110
Copy that, sir.

176
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,460
Alpha One, we need an ID on the male target.

177
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,170
We've got to get out of here

178
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,380
before the police cut off this part of the city.

179
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,810
Head north.

180
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,520
Meet me at the statue of Athena.

181
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,280
I'll take them with me.

182
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,330
That's him.

183
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,250
Now.

184
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,270
Stay with Bourne.

185
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,440
Clear to engage the target.

186
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,570
Copy.

187
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,930
Alpha Team, stay with the male. You are clear to engage.

188
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,370
Come on.

189
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,970
Sir, Alpha Team comms are down.

190
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,660
We've lost him, sir. He's taken them out.

191
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,140
Find Parsons. He'll come back to get her.

192
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,310
Sir, rioting is spreading.

193
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,460
The Greek government is declaring a state of emergency.

194
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,160
Bravo Team, we are retargeting Parsons.

195
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,890
We got her.

196
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,900
Split the team, put her in a box.

197
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,130
A suspect matching Bourne's description

198
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,950
has stolen a police motorcycle.

199
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,590
He's coming for Parsons.

200
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,760
Where the hell is the Asset?

201
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,940
Two minutes out, sir.

202
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,590
Parsons is at the statue of Athena.

203
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,690
Copy that.

204
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,420
Bravo Team is down.

205
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,370
Sir, the Asset is arriving on scene.

206
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,700
- Pull up the dash cam.
- Copy.

207
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,050
Give me the feed and direct comms to the Asset.

208
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,180
Engaging targets.

209
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,250
I'm accessing Athens police tactical data.

210
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,480
I need eyes overhead.

211
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,190
Bring up the satellite suite.

212
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,200
Sir, I'm showing a Misty and a KH-12 satellite available.

213
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,090
- Light up the 12.
- Yes, sir.

214
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,520
Satellite video feed is online.

215
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,730
Police have blocked the road to the north.

216
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,280
The target will be forced to turn left.

217
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,690
Another barricade in 200 meters.

218
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,720
Target turning left again.

219
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,890
Bourne's heading for the alley.

220
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,690
Left at the top of the hill.

221
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,580
Stairway.

222
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,390
Up the hill. Heading east.

223
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,000
Give me a strike point.

224
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,580
He's found a way out.

225
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,340
Two hundred meters to your left.

226
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,330
19 Solomou. Get to the roof.

227
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,380
Target should pass within your line of sight.

228
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,150
19 Solomou. Copy.

229
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,600
Focus the satellites on these coordinates.

230
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,570
And give me a lock on the motorcycle when it gets there.

231
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,750
Copy that.

232
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,660
I've got the targets. They're approaching Omonia from Fidiou.

233
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,260
Look west.

234
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,520
The long boulevard.

235
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,390
Coming at you in 55 seconds.

236
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,820
Copy that.

237
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,400
The Asset is online.

238
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,120
Target's with you in 15 seconds.

239
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,130
Five seconds.

240
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,080
Contact.

241
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,220
Stay low!

242
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,300
Find a shot.

243
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,730
Hold on!

244
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,790
Targets are down.

245
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,670
Where's Bourne?

246
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,710
Ma'am, a police helicopter

247
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,460
spotted three bodies on the roof near the Asset.

248
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,310
A tactical team's on its way.

249
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,410
Nicky?

250
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,300
Don't move!

251
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,960
Athens police have entered the building.

252
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,710
Asset, you need to get out of there.

253
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,060
Negative.

254
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,440
We don't even know if Bourne's alive.

255
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,410
You want to lose this guy?

256
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,850
This is Director Dewey.

257
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,620
You have 20 seconds.

258
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,380
Hold on, Nicky.

259
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,380
I'm going to get you to cover.

260
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,800
No.

261
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,390
No.

262
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,350
No, don't.

263
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,060
I'm coming.

264
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,370
- Get a location on Christian Dassault.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,560
If he was working with Nicky Parsons,

266
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,330
he will lead us to Jason Bourne.

267
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,000
And let me know if you get a hit on that malware.

268
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,170
Sir, can I clarify one thing?

269
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,970
Yeah.

270
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,690
Does the Asset know Bourne?

271
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,250
Why would you ask me that?

272
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,860
His behavior on the rooftop.

273
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,940
It suggested a connection.

274
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,110
The last time Bourne came back,

275
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,030
he exposed the Blackbriar program.

276
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,330
It compromised active operations.

277
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,540
The Asset was in Syria undercover.

278
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,540
He was captured, tortured,

279
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,380
and it took two damn years to get him out.

280
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,530
So you think that's why Bourne wants the files?

281
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,860
To go public again?

282
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,610
I have no idea why he came back.

283
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,610
But whatever he's doing, he wants to destroy us.

284
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,800
We can't let that happen.

285
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,100
So, you give me a call soon as you hear anything.

286
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,770
Yes, sir.

287
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,720
And now, the founder and chairman of Deep Dream,

288
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,190
Aaron Kalloor.

289
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,020
You all know why we're here.

290
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,900
We're gonna be unveiling a new platform.

291
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,230
We think it is a bold new step

292
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,550
to allow us to serve our community better.

293
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,210
We're a community right now

294
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,400
that is transcending national boundaries.

295
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,030
And I think we're 1.5 billion users.

296
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,630
In a nutshell, as you know, we have an ecosystem

297
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,510
of hundreds of thousands of apps at this point.

298
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,380
And what this new platform will do

299
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,930
will be to integrate users' data and preferences,

300
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,100
and use that information

301
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,140
to enrich and tailor-make each unique user experience

302
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,610
in a way that is, frankly, unprecedented.

303
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,520
Um, now, I can see some journalists' pens twitching,

304
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,940
- ready to ask about privacy.
- Yeah.

305
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,360
This is a concern to many people, and so it should be.

306
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,840
I mean, this is something that matters to us.

307
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,110
And let me just say, uh,

308
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,100
I understand nobody wants to feel like they're being watched.

309
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,500
So let me just tell you,

310
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,290
when you come to Deep Dream, when you use our service,

311
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,740
no one will be watching you.

312
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,750
- Mr. Kalloor.
- Right this way, sir.

313
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,740
Enjoy your meal.

314
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,970
Thank you.

315
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,580
Congratulations.

316
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,020
I hear your stockholders were very happy with that new platform.

317
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,510
And I heard you got hacked.

318
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,750
We're dealing with it.

319
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,980
This changes everything. There's too much risk.

320
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,610
I'm out.

321
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,980
Aaron,

322
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,410
you are an extraordinarily gifted and perceptive young man.

323
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,930
When you agreed to help us,

324
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,740
it was because you understood the very grave threats that...

325
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,940
Do you have any idea of the shit-storm I'll have on my hands

326
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,210
if this arrangement becomes public?

327
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,890
I already took a hit with Snowden,

328
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,760
and you want more?

329
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,720
Our enemies have become much more sophisticated.

330
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,290
Gathering metadata is no longer adequate.

331
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,920
We need a back door into your new platform,

332
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,750
and a way past the encryptions.

333
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,190
And when that's not enough, you'll want something new.

334
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,400
You don't get it, do you?

335
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,800
Privacy is freedom.

336
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,060
Maybe that's something you should think about defending.

337
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,700
You little prick,

338
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,390
you didn't believe in privacy or freedom

339
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,420
when we funded your startup,

340
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,060
turned you into a billionaire.

341
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,670
I paid you back many, many, many times over.

342
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,170
And I was never comfortable with any of this.

343
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,870
I'm out.

344
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,110
I'm done selling out our customers.

345
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,920
But you would sell out your country.

346
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,990
The truth is, we wouldn't be having this conversation

347
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,240
if you didn't feel personally at risk.

348
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,750
You talk about a free Internet,

349
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,660
you tell yourself you're saving the world,

350
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,600
but all you're doing is making it a much more dangerous place.

351
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,590
And you're sure as hell making

352
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,260
this country much more difficult to defend.

353
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,950
And you're sure as hell accountable for that, Aaron.

354
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,950
Accountable.

355
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,430
Bourne?

356
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,930
Everything on the table.

357
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,240
Open it.

358
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,940
Sure.

359
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,650
Bourne has surfaced. In Berlin.

360
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,240
Get the Berlin team up.

361
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,580
Where is she?

362
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,760
She's dead.

363
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,630
She knew the risks.

364
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,810
I warned her.

365
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,230
She made a choice.

366
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,810
You exploited her.

367
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:28,540
Berlin team is mobile.

368
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,400
What do we have on the location?

369
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,250
It's an address linked to Christian Dassault.

370
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,400
Anything on Bourne?

371
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,670
Nothing yet. I'm accessing CCTV now.

372
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,720
Sir, I've been thinking, maybe we've got this wrong.

373
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,890
What if he's not coming for us?

374
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,060
What if it's something else?

375
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,840
You don't have any idea who you're dealing with.

376
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,410
We should work together, Bourne.

377
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,830
You exposed the Blackbriar program.

378
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,310
We're both after the same thing, right?

379
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:13,760
We both want to take down

380
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,240
the corrupt institutions that control society.

381
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,460
I'm not on your side.

382
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,280
CCTV feed is online.

383
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,590
He's on a computer.

384
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,890
We have to stop this.

385
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,020
If he puts those files online, operations will be compromised

386
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,230
and people will die.

387
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:51,580
Yes, sir.

388
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,300
At least when you're done, leave me the files.

389
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,550
These programs have to be exposed.

390
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,510
People have a right to know.

391
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,820
We need that computer.

392
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,280
There's a phone in the room.

393
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,000
I can use it to delete the files.

394
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,280
- Got the phone.
- Where's that team?

395
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,690
Five minutes out, sir.

396
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,490
We're running out of time. Get there.

397
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,650
Listen to me, David.

398
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,410
I've done something.

399
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,490
Something...

400
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,120
...that came at a cost.

401
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,250
One day you'll understand why.

402
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,960
I gotta get back to Washington.

403
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,880
I love you, son.

404
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,560
They're fighting, sir.

405
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:13,660
One more firewall.

406
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,850
Files deleted, sir.

407
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,900
Call in.

408
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,140
Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.

409
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,400
I'm not in charge here.

410
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,720
I wasn't here when you went missing.

411
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,450
I can see you're going through the old Treadstone files.

412
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,740
Retracing your history.

413
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,700
I know you're looking for something.

414
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,750
Let me help you find it.

415
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,750
Give me that phone.

416
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,340
Yes, sir.

417
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,340
Jason, this is Robert Dewey. Do you remember me?

418
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,330
Jason, your dad was a patriot.

419
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:07,000
He could see the threats that America was facing,

420
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,420
and, like you, he chose to serve his country

421
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,030
out of a profound sense of duty.

422
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,860
He would not want to see you harm the Agency.

423
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,780
You have to stop this.

424
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,540
And you have to stop it now.

425
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,080
Sir, our ETA is...

426
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,570
He's on the move. Be ready.

427
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,230
Take point!

428
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,360
On me!

429
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,840
The elevator.

430
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,880
We lost him, sir.

431
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,760
Malcolm Smith, contract only, based out of London.

432
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,800
Ran all of Treadstone's surveillance in the late '90s,

433
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,980
when Bourne was recruited.

434
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,560
Is he still active?

435
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,930
He's private security now.

436
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,420
Contact the Asset and tell him

437
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,640
I want him on the ground in London in six hours.

438
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,530
I think that could be a mistake, sir.

439
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,480
A mistake? Why?

440
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,880
There is an argument for catching Bourne instead of killing him.

441
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,930
All right, let's hear it.

442
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,910
Bourne's been off the grid for a long time.

443
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,520
He's been hiding in the shadows, he's seen things.

444
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,960
He knows things that could help us.

445
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,020
Bringing him back in is the smart move.

446
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,630
And how are we going to do that?

447
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:59,830
Albert Hirsch wrote the psychal evaluation when Bourne left the program.

448
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,590
He concluded Bourne is still a patriot at heart,

449
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,070
and that leaving the program could come back to haunt him.

450
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,620
And what are you suggesting?

451
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,030
I watched Bourne with those files.

452
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,250
Desperately looking into his past.

453
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:18,530
And I think he's at a tipping point.

454
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,980
If I could get face-to-face with him,

455
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,010
I think I can bring him back in.

456
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,860
One attempt.

457
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,890
And if it fails,

458
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,520
you do what you have to.

459
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,770
Well, it makes sense to me. What do you think, Bob?

460
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,050
Let's give it a shot.

461
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,150
All right, do it.

462
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,600
Bring Bourne in, or tie it off.

463
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,800
But this ends now.

464
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,020
Thank you, sir.

465
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,120
Sir, I'm sorry...

466
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,670
No, don't worry about that.

467
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,010
Better get some sleep, kid.

468
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,060
You got a long 24 hours ahead of you.

469
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,190
Yes, sir.

470
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,510
It's taking too long.

471
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,470
It shouldn't still be buggy this close to launch.

472
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,560
Well, I don't think it's buggy.

473
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,630
I think we've changed some things

474
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,310
that's going to change the parameters.

475
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,640
We're going to have to go and...

476
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,930
Okay, we need to change them back.

477
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,400
Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle?

478
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,280
- Absolutely.
- Look, I think you're right,

479
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,840
- I just don't think we want to...
- I'm tired of waiting.

480
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,990
Mr. Kalloor.

481
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,200
What the hell is this?

482
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,120
Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Burroughs.

483
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,870
I'm from the Department of Justice.

484
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,000
I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint...

485
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,450
Really? We have to do this in public?

486
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,460
Issued by the US government

487
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,630
against Deep Dream Corporation for violation of the Sherman Act.

488
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:03,210
This complaint requires you to

489
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,840
preserve all personal and corporate financial records

490
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,220
pending antitrust motions to be filed in federal court.

491
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,530
Good day.

492
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,630
- This is Dewey.
- Aaron, it's a message.

493
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:26,780
And maybe we should think about

494
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,760
what we're doing before it gets any worse.

495
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,160
So, you think if we give him what he wants, it'll end there?

496
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,180
You know, I'm just saying that maybe we should listen.

497
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:37,590
I want you to pull up all the

498
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,640
records of all the meetings I've ever had with Dewey.

499
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,520
All the records? Even the off-the-books discussions?

500
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,770
Especially those.

501
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,110
We're going to Vegas. I need an insurance policy.

502
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,640
Are you in London?

503
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,950
Yes.

504
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,750
Why are you sending her?

505
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,120
She serves a purpose.

506
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,400
I work alone.

507
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,920
Not this time.

508
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,750
Don't make this personal.

509
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:33,280
Bourne betrayed us. It's always been personal.

510
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,470
You know who you're dealing with.

511
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,220
You better make sure you're ready.

512
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,300
There's something you should know about Deep Dream.

513
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,110
But I need an assurance

514
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,900
that I have your support.

515
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,330
You got it. What do you have?

516
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:05,040
Kalloor is planning something for Vegas.

517
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:51,670
Yes?

518
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:53,200
This is Jason Bourne.

519
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,290
I need to talk.

520
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,700
What about?

521
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,470
I don't work for the Agency anymore.

522
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:02,390
Paddington Plaza, 15 minutes.

523
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,960
Bourne just called Smith.

524
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,260
They're meeting at Paddington Plaza.

525
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,070
15 minutes.

526
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,760
We'll tail Smith the whole way.

527
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,950
As soon as we get eyes on Bourne, I'll approach him.

528
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,370
Whatever you do, stay contained.

529
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,500
I don't want the Brits crawling all over us, asking questions.

530
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,980
Understood.

531
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,690
Tracking device.

532
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,480
You'll hold on the south side of the bridge.

533
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,530
I'll contact you if I need you.

534
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,290
Sure.

535
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,580
You're the boss, right?

536
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:39,390
Subject is on the move. Heading toward the canal.

537
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,320
Alpha Team, take a parallel track.

538
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,930
Bravo Team, follow the subject from behind.

539
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,660
And keep your eyes open for Bourne.

540
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,080
Bravo Team tailing subject.

541
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,030
Let's go.

542
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,900
In 200 meters, make a right.

543
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,340
Copy that.

544
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,140
Comms check. Second channel. Do you copy?

545
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:13,330
I have you. Where are you now?

546
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:14,600
Heading towards Smith.

547
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,570
No sign of Bourne.

548
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:02,300
Subject has turned east, into an alley.

549
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,560
Alpha Team, that alley leads to a footbridge,

550
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,900
which will bring him to you.

551
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,360
Copy that.

552
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,340
Bravo Team is down.

553
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,590
Sending you updated route now.

554
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,220
You copy that, Smith?

555
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,630
Yes.

556
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,900
Bravo Team, why aren't you moving? What's going on?

557
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,460
Bravo Team, do you copy?

558
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,320
What's happening, Heather? Where's Bravo?

559
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,380
We're comms down on Bravo.

560
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,580
Alpha Team, do you have eyes on the subject?

561
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,970
We have eyes on.

562
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,440
Alpha Team, sit-rep.

563
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,210
Alpha Team, report.

564
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:24,810
What's happening, Heather?

565
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,630
Alpha Team isn't responding.

566
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:29,300
Bravo?

567
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,600
Still nothing.

568
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,910
You lost both teams? Get a grip on this operation, Heather.

569
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,030
That's Bourne.

570
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,900
Green-light the Asset.

571
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,230
Sir, I need more time.

572
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:39,540
We have no time.

573
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,020
Are you going to give that order or not?

574
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,480
Sir, please.

575
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,490
You are too naive to see the truth.

576
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,110
There's no bringing in Bourne.

577
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,420
He has to be put down,

578
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:52,050
and you obviously cannot do what has to be done.

579
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,350
I am taking operational control.

580
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,470
Asset, you have a green light.

581
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,460
Repeat, you have a green light on Bourne.

582
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,610
Copy that.

583
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,110
I'm on my way.

584
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,120
Asset, are you on the move?

585
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,900
Asset, your tracking device says you're stationary.

586
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,020
Are you moving?

587
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,920
Heather, stay off this channel. Let him do his job.

588
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:27,630
Left here.

589
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,470
- Get to Paddington Plaza, fast.
- Copy that.

590
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,510
In position.

591
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:25,650
Locked in.

592
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,750
What's going on?

593
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,090
What's that noise?

594
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:50,130
Multiple fire alarms.

595
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,710
That's Bourne.

596
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,850
What do I do?

597
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:00,060
You stay there. You do not move.

598
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,520
Leave the building by the nearest available exit.

599
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,280
I can't stay here.

600
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,010
You can't protect me.

601
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,910
I need you to stay where you are, Smith.

602
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,620
You still have line of sight?

603
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,120
I'm on him.

604
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,670
You're gonna shoot him in a crowd when he's right next to me?

605
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,410
Stay where you are, Smith.

606
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,440
You know why he's here.

607
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,700
He wants answers.

608
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,050
You've lost this thing.

609
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,040
I gotta get out of here.

610
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,840
Shit!

611
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,240
What the hell is going on?

612
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,150
Bourne's got Smith.

613
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,380
Go after them. I'll come around and cut them off.

614
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,500
Smith, we know you're with Bourne.

615
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,390
You have to find a way to let us know where you are.

616
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,520
Why are you taking me in here?

617
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:32,110
They've got to be near the Plaza.

618
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,200
Jesus, Bourne!

619
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,320
God damn it!

620
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,390
What are you doing? Take it easy.

621
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,640
Richard Webb.

622
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,520
Station Chief, Beirut.

623
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,270
He was my father. He started Treadstone.

624
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:52,650
He hired you to put me under surveillance. Why?

625
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,510
- Jesus!
- Why did he hire you?

626
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,010
Don't say anything, Smith.

627
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,670
No. No.

628
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:05,930
There's no sign of them.

629
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,550
What do you want us to do?

630
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,290
Work your way down the canal.

631
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,260
I'll circle around and meet you there.

632
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,800
You followed me to Beirut.

633
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,140
The last time I saw my father!

634
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,570
Why would he have you follow me?

635
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,990
It doesn't make any sense. Why?

636
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,290
Don't give him a goddamn thing.

637
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:27,960
Why?

638
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,580
Jesus Christ, Bourne! I'm falling!

639
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,490
Bourne, please!

640
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,410
I can hear them!

641
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:43,580
Beirut.

642
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,890
I went there to tell him that Treadstone had approached me.

643
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,310
But if it was his program, why didn't he say anything to me?

644
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,890
I've done something.

645
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,070
Something...

646
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,140
...that came at a cost.

647
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,190
That was the day he was killed.

648
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:06,910
They said he was killed by terrorists.

649
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,680
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?

650
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,330
Think about your family's safety,

651
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:12,830
Smith. You keep your mouth shut.

652
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,330
The next bullet's in your head!

653
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,590
Why was he killed?

654
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,500
Why?

655
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,930
He was killed because of you.

656
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,170
Your father, he wasn't in Operations.

657
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,770
He didn't know we'd chosen you. When he found out, he...

658
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,750
He threatened to expose the program.

659
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,430
He didn't want you turned into a killer.

660
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:46,620
Who killed him?

661
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,770
Who killed him?

662
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:58,200
Don't do it.

663
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,880
Where is he?

664
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,370
He's almost there.

665
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,680
We're gonna stop this now.

666
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,480
No, please.

667
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,040
Somebody help! Call an ambulance!

668
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,120
Someone help!

669
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,080
He went off the roof. Five floors.

670
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,830
He recognized me.

671
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,340
I'm going to make sure it's finished.

672
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,450
Help's coming now.

673
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,760
No, don't get up, mate.

674
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:55,850
Step aside, please. Step aside.

675
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,830
Everybody step back.

676
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:59,690
- Let us do our job.
- Please step back.

677
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,010
Did anybody see what happened?

678
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:04,090
He's gone.

679
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,090
- Oh, shit.
- I'm going after him.

680
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,810
I'll work my way down the canal.

681
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,810
No. You're done in London.

682
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,350
What are you talking about?

683
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,040
There's another play to be made.

684
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,190
Now that he knows what we did, he'll come for both of us,

685
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:21,130
and that could be the opportunity for something else.

686
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:22,940
This isn't about revenge.

687
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,210
Yes, it is.

688
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,050
And it won't be done until one of us is dead.

689
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,820
Get to the airport.

690
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,100
We have a problem with Iron Hand.

691
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,220
Copy that.

692
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:44,960
Give me a sit-rep.

693
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,590
We've got nothing.

694
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:47,980
Keep looking.

695
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,330
Drive.

696
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:02,980
It wasn't supposed to go like this.

697
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,150
I wanted to talk.

698
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,910
Where's Dewey going?

699
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,480
He's going to Vegas to speak

700
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,830
with Aaron Kalloor at a cyber convention.

701
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:16,660
The Agency recruits there every year.

702
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,090
What's Iron Hand?

703
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,060
Dewey's new black-ops program.

704
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,260
Full-spectrum surveillance.

705
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,920
Watching everyone all the time.

706
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,870
Dewey needs Kalloor's cooperation to bring it online.

707
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:34,570
Let me out.

708
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:37,960
I can help you get there.

709
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,630
Why would you do that?

710
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:47,380
You and I have different reasons, but we both want Dewey gone.

711
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,890
Here, take this.

712
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,990
I'll see you in Vegas.

713
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:35,600
Sir.

714
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,650
We're pinning Kalloor's hit

715
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:39,000
on a fictional jihadi shooter.

716
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,100
A 20-year-old Iraqi national.

717
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,430
We created bank accounts,

718
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,360
travel documents, e-mails, phone records.

719
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:46,500
He'll look like a lone wolf.

720
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,770
Any physical evidence?

721
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,070
The Asset leaves the gun. It'll have the Iraqi's prints on it.

722
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,900
Russell doesn't need to know about this.

723
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,030
I understand, sir.

724
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:01,700
Any news on Bourne?

725
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,080
Nothing.

726
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,200
He was always gonna come for me.

727
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,920
Well, if it happens, we'll deal with it.

728
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,700
What was the purpose of your visit to London, Mr. Michaels?

729
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,380
Business.

730
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:20,860
Welcome home, sir.

731
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:23,450
Thank you.

732
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,670
Parking lot clear. You're good to go.

733
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:46,890
Sir, we have a secure room for you, right upstairs.

734
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:49,540
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

735
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,500
Hi, welcome to the Aria.

736
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,800
- Heather Lee, checking in.
- Okay.

737
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:03,880
We have you in a lovely Sky Suite. Number 2016.

738
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,790
Enjoy your stay.

739
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:06,890
Thank you.

740
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:16,480
Aaron!

741
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,470
All right, Aaron!

742
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:21,740
Deep Dream!

743
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,480
Find Lee.

744
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,790
Tell her I want to see her before we go on stage.

745
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,240
Yes, sir.

746
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,650
I want agents posted backstage as well as the auditorium.

747
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,890
Yes, sir.

748
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,670
Coming through, make a hole.

749
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:56,900
Make a hole, make a hole.

750
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,300
Gonna make a quick stop here.

751
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,010
Hey, guys. Hi. How's it going? Aaron.

752
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:03,200
Good to meet you.

753
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:04,870
Can I get one?

754
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,780
Thanks very much for your hard work.

755
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,100
Thank you.

756
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,200
You're doing a great job.

757
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:47,490
Yeah.

758
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:49,120
You all set?

759
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,310
Checking the departure route now.

760
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:53,330
You won't have much time.

761
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:56,990
They won't know where it came from. I'll have enough time.

762
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,520
After you take care of Kalloor,

763
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,070
I'll be standing, left hand at my side.

764
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:02,210
You put a bullet in it.

765
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,380
It's better if I'm a target, too.

766
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:06,720
Copy that.

767
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:47,390
Lee.

768
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:52,060
The Director wants a word before you go on stage.

769
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:54,840
Of course.

770
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,580
ID?

771
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,160
Thanks.

772
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,520
Heather.

773
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:50,410
My protégé. Strongest supporter.

774
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,840
You know, after what happened in London,

775
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,350
I did not know what to do with you.

776
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:59,420
I suppose we'll just, um, write it off to your learning curve.

777
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,540
I'd appreciate that.

778
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:05,630
At least you can now see that you never had a chance.

779
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,030
When Bourne turns up again, I'll deal with him.

780
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:10,700
Do you understand?

781
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,370
Of course.

782
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,100
I agree completely.

783
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:18,520
When we get on stage,

784
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,110
I'll handle all the policy questions,

785
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:21,460
throw everything technical to you.

786
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,630
I'll be ready, sir.

787
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:24,320
Okay, let's do this.

788
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,160
Badges?

789
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,390
Aaron.

790
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,340
Robert.

791
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,810
You know Heather Lee.

792
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,900
Yeah, we went to Stanford together.

793
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,140
Wow. How are you enjoying life at the Agency?

794
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,990
Challenging. But fulfilling.

795
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:15,700
It's tough to stay true to your principles over there?

796
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,490
My principles are just fine, thanks.

797
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:22,190
Gentlemen, we're ready for you. Follow me, please.

798
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:23,290
I'm going to enjoy this.

799
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,160
So am I.

800
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,230
Thank you, sir.

801
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:05,170
Oh! Hi! How's everybody doing tonight?

802
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,200
Welcome.

803
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:11,090
Welcome.

804
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:16,220
Welcome to tonight's EXOCON Symposium.

805
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:20,470
We are so lucky to have four fantastic guests this evening.

806
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:24,390
The CIA Director, Robert Dewey, is here.

807
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,170
And a dear friend of mine, and an old friend of EXOCON,

808
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:35,290
the CEO of social-media giant Deep Dream, Aaron Kalloor is here.

809
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:12,020
Tonight, "Policing a free Internet,

810
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,820
"Personal rights versus public safety."

811
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:18,590
This is the great question of our time.

812
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:21,520
And the choices we make about this will determine our future.

813
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,830
So let's just dive right in, okay?

814
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,040
Come on out here, guys.

815
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,860
Sir, you've got an incoming message.

816
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,960
High priority.

817
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:34,780
All right, guys, I'm gonna have to take this.

818
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,990
I'll catch up with you later.

819
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,590
Go ahead.

820
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,850
Thanks for having me.

821
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:00,930
It appears Director Dewey is held up momentarily,

822
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:04,540
and I am being told that it shouldn't be too much longer.

823
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:06,220
But we have a ton of stuff to get into tonight,

824
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,570
so we can start anyway...

825
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:09,320
Brad? Brad, could I say a few words?

826
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:11,500
- Excuse me?
- Can I get the ball rolling?

827
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:15,740
Oh, sure, man, by all means. Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.

828
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:27,930
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

829
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,540
Thanks a lot to Brad and all the folks at EXOCON

830
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,190
for having us back, and to you guys for turning out.

831
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:38,800
Before the Director comes out to join us,

832
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,570
I just wanted to share a few words with you guys.

833
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:44,240
A long time ago, I had this idea.

834
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:47,220
- Copy that.
- A beautiful idea, to create a place, online...

835
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,730
Facial recognition got a hit.

836
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,850
Bourne was on a BA flight from Heathrow to Vegas.

837
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:52,450
It landed two hours ago.

838
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,610
How the hell did he get through immigration?

839
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:59,110
Someone issued him an Agency security clearance on his passport.

840
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:03,080
Well, it turned out to be a pretty popular idea.

841
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:06,500
People from around the world started using our service.

842
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:20,350
Well, first off, this has all

843
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,950
made me a lot more rich than is probably healthy.

844
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:27,120
When I come on stage, take care of Kalloor and the girl.

845
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,400
Copy.

846
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,020
But, what I mean to say is that, you know,

847
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,120
all this success has come at a cost.

848
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:37,090
There is a cancer at the heart of Deep Dream.

849
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,180
A guilty secret, and, um...

850
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,740
I have to share it with all of you guys.

851
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,240
Son of a bitch is about to take us down.

852
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:46,640
Take out Kalloor and the girl right now.

853
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,480
- Stay there.
- Okay.

854
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:57,980
When I was starting out, I, uh...

855
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:01,320
I took money to start my company.

856
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,900
Made a bargain with a guy in a dark suit...

857
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:11,400
...and now he's come back to take my soul.

858
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,400
I see the shooter!

859
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,570
We've got eyes on Jason Bourne.

860
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:25,180
He's still breathing. Call an ambulance!

861
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,340
Go, go!

862
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,500
- Let's go!
- Sir, we gotta go.

863
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,820
Head for the exit!

864
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,690
This is Vasquez. We're on Bourne.

865
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,020
Get the cars ready!

866
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,320
Get the cars ready right now!

867
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:53,770
No, take me to the suite.

868
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:56,100
Sir, we've got to get you out of here. Bourne is on the loose.

869
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,400
You heard me. Take me to the suite.

870
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,520
Yes, sir.

871
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:02,610
Take him to the suite. Take him upstairs.

872
01:31:02,710 --> 01:31:03,760
Get him upstairs.

873
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:04,880
Right now. Right now.

874
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:06,210
Up to the suite.

875
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,490
- Let's go, right now. Go, go, go!
- Yes, sir.

876
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:12,100
Come this way. This way. Don't worry. Come on.

877
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,560
Out of the way! Federal agent!

878
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,520
Vasquez, sit-rep.

879
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:30,270
Vasquez, come in!

880
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,850
Okay, we've got him. Sir, this is Collier.

881
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,000
- We've ID'd the sniper.
- Shit.

882
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,670
We're circulating his photo now.

883
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:00,130
What about Bourne?

884
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,190
Hang on.

885
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:03,570
Okay, Bourne is just leaving

886
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:05,780
the west service corridor, heading for the lobby.

887
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,610
Copy that. Stay on Bourne.

888
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,340
What?

889
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,690
We're still looking for Bourne. And they've ID'd the Asset.

890
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,030
Go back to the first floor and wait for further instructions.

891
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:35,710
- Yes, sir. Copy that.
- Copy that.

892
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:55,020
Everybody down! Right now!

893
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,620
Down, move, move, move!

894
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,160
Out of the way! Federal agents! Move!

895
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:26,010
Take a team to the northeast elevators. I'll meet you up there.

896
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:35,700
Bourne's on his way up to you.

897
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,210
You took a long time to get here, Jason.

898
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:30,920
I know about Beirut.

899
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,250
I know what you did.

900
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,430
It all ends tonight.

901
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:39,430
Be a lot easier to do it right away.

902
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:48,500
You didn't come here for revenge.

903
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,720
You came here because you know it's time to come in.

904
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,280
Your father created the program.

905
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:04,680
Didn't have what it takes to make it work.

906
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,040
And you did.

907
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:08,460
You always did.

908
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:12,440
That's why you volunteered.

909
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,540
I volunteered because I thought our enemies killed him.

910
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:18,620
I volunteered because of a lie.

911
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,530
No, you volunteered because of who you are.

912
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:23,870
You volunteered because you are Jason Bourne,

913
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:26,520
and not David Webb.

914
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,070
Thirty-two kills, Jason.

915
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,220
Every one of them made a difference.

916
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:44,620
People all across this country are safer because of what you did.

917
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,830
I'm trying to find another way.

918
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,300
And how's that working out for you?

919
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:14,020
You're never going to find any peace.

920
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:18,940
Not until you admit to yourself who you really are.

921
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:23,030
It's time to come in, Jason.

922
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:26,370
It's time to come in.

923
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,210
I can't.

924
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:40,550
Not for you.

925
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,830
You were never here.

926
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,890
You don't have to go after him.

927
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:31,880
This can stop now.

928
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,810
You have a choice.

929
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,120
- Let's go!
- Have your IDs ready.

930
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:02,050
Have your IDs ready, ladies and gentlemen.

931
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:05,890
Have your IDs ready! Come on, guys, let's go, let's go!

932
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:15,980
Stand in a line. Las Vegas Police, ladies and gentlemen!

933
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:01,090
BearCat SWAT truck and unmarked black Dodge Charger

934
01:39:01,190 --> 01:39:02,440
stolen from the front of the Aria.

935
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,890
Pursuit in progress. Air support requested.

936
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:13,120
What was that ID?

937
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,750
Stop him! Block that road!

938
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,080
Oh, my God!

939
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:34,290
Fire!

940
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:38,720
Move out!

941
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:24,840
Move!

942
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:30,250
Next two units involved, identify.

943
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:32,880
This is Air 1. Be advised, suspect vehicles

944
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:34,940
have crashed into the southeast entrance of the Riviera.

945
01:44:46,570 --> 01:44:47,660
We have an armed suspect

946
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:49,920
heading into the storm drain south of the Riviera.

947
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:42,440
You're a traitor. You've always been a traitor.

948
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:44,810
It's in your blood.

949
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,400
Mr. Kalloor!

950
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:14,470
Aaron! What were you going to tell everyone at the convention?

951
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:16,140
What are you hiding, Aaron?

952
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:19,940
Why did somebody try to assassinate you?

953
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,250
What's the cancer at the heart of Deep Dream?

954
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:23,080
I think it would be

955
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,860
inappropriate to pass any comment at this stage,

956
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,860
but I look forward to working with the authorities

957
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,530
to find out who was responsible.

958
01:48:28,630 --> 01:48:29,820
And to getting back to Deep Dream,

959
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,250
where we can continue our important work. Thank you.

960
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:34,920
Have you been lying to your users?

961
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:07,720
Sir.

962
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,470
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.

963
01:49:20,350 --> 01:49:21,980
About Vegas.

964
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:25,920
Director Dewey's tactics were unwise.

965
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:27,430
Unwise?

966
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:29,270
We're still trying to come

967
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:30,980
up with a narrative to explain what happened.

968
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:35,530
That son of a bitch put a spotlight on Iron Hand.

969
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:37,810
On all of us.

970
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:39,960
Kalloor hasn't gone public yet.

971
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:42,960
I know Aaron.

972
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,160
There are still moves we can make with him.

973
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:50,510
Tell me.

974
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:54,010
Dewey's problem was that he belonged in the past.

975
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,680
People like Kalloor are shaping the future.

976
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,060
These are my people.

977
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:03,590
I know how to deal with him.

978
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,440
And what do you want?

979
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,260
When you appoint a new Agency Director,

980
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,280
you're going to need someone working for your interests.

981
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:16,660
Someone

982
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:20,070
empowered by you.

983
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:24,700
What about Bourne?

984
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:28,500
You still think you can bring him in?

985
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:32,760
I have his trust.

986
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:34,880
After what we went through.

987
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:38,370
I'll bring him in.

988
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:40,220
I'm certain of it.

989
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,440
And if you can't?

990
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:49,650
Then he'll have to be put down.

991
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,570
It's an interesting proposal.

992
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,000
You can pull over here.

993
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:08,630
Of course, if you decide that

994
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:11,370
you don't need me, then that's not a problem.

995
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:15,170
There are many other agencies who would want what I know.

996
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:46,450
I brought you something.

997
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,250
It's a cast from your father's star,

998
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:56,180
on the Memorial Wall at Langley.

999
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:08,260
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

1000
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:12,550
How you were treated.

1001
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:15,260
But the people that did that are gone,

1002
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,890
and things are changing at the Agency.

1003
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:20,570
What is it you want?

1004
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:25,750
I know you've always been a patriot.

1005
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:30,330
That what happens to this country matters to you.

1006
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,790
We need you to help protect us.

1007
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:36,760
Come back in.

1008
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,710
And we'll work together.

1009
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,150
Let me think about it.

1010
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:52,810
How will I find you?

1011
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,450
You still think you can bring him in?

1012
01:53:41,570 --> 01:53:43,240
I have his trust.

1013
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:45,660
After what we went through.

1014
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:47,870
I'll bring him in.

1015
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,030
I'm certain of it.

1016
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:52,780
And if you can't?

1017
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:57,710
Then he'll have to be put down.
