1
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,448
Where's Manny?

2
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:28,856
Tell him the ice cream man is here.

3
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,542
Freeze. Hammer time.

4
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,413
Can we get down to business?

5
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:57,356
You got the money?

6
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:13,095
Tell him.

7
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,608
He said that
he's not gonna give you one red cent...

8
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,145
until you tell him
what flavor the ice cream is.

9
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:20,612
Vanilla. That's what you ordered.

10
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:26,044
-Tell him.
-Okay.

11
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:34,417
lt's all about the Benjamins, baby!

12
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:37,087
Bring in the stuff.

13
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,095
-Arnold Schwarzenegger, funny man!
-He's funny like that!

14
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,739
There is your ice cream.

15
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,139
Tell him. l see coming. He say....

16
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:59,913
l tell him, l say <i>Jesús.</i>

17
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,395
He coming, and he say....

18
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,001
-Tell him.
-He say...

19
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:21,741
FBl. You're under arrest.

20
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:23,606
-He's going to run.
-No, he ain't.

21
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,168
You owe me $1 .

22
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,981
Where are you going, big boy?

23
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:44,389
Goddamn. Now l'm going to bust your ass.

24
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:50,803
ls that all your big ass got?

25
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,978
-Enough.
-Kevin.

26
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:04,682
All right, you two over here. Right now.

27
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,879
l swear l'll shoot both of you.

28
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,027
Damn, Marcus, why you always
got to pick the biggest dude?

29
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,730
l don't know. l like a challenge.

30
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,373
See, what did l tell you?

31
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,371
We did it, right? Didn't l tell you?

32
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,243
-No help. No backup.
-You the man.

33
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,443
We'll get all the credit.
The biggest bust of our career.

34
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,313
400 keys of pure....

35
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:46,223
-Vanilla ice cream?
-What?

36
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:49,686
My man! Where's the drugs?

37
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,297
l know nothing about drugs.

38
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:56,496
l sell ice cream. Strawberry. Vanilla.

39
00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:59,171
Neapolitan, for example.

40
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:06,107
Tell Manny his ice cream delivery is here.

41
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,714
Never mind. Wrong store.

42
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,848
FBl. Freeze!

43
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,829
-Marcus?
-l'm good.

44
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,406
-They're moving.
-Let's go.

45
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,508
-Which one?
-l don't know.

46
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:50,289
-God.
-Damn.

47
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:54,517
l told you we should've called for backup.

48
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,764
You know the Chief's gonna kill us, right?

49
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:57,696
You know the Chief's gonna kill us, right?

50
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,467
Let me give you guys a little tip.

51
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:05,539
lf you're going to
operate outside the channels...

52
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:08,507
do the whole renegade cop thing...

53
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,074
you might want to make sure
that you get the right guy.

54
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,908
Chief, we almost had the guy.

55
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,244
Our intelligence was just a little off.

56
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:22,448
Wait a minute. lntelligence?

57
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:26,293
Look around you, Copeland.
There's nothing intelligent about this.

58
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,760
Now l'm tired of your escapades.
l want them to stop.

59
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,764
The last thing l need is
to be the laughingstock of the Bureau.

60
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:33,424
And furthermore, the--

61
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,766
Hold on. Hello? Baby, l can't talk.

62
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:40,170
The Chief is chewing my ass right now.
l got to call you back. Bye.

63
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:43,301
-Sorry, Chief.
-As l was saying--

64
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:50,916
Gordon here.

65
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,885
Yes, he is.

66
00:06:58,225 --> 00:06:59,988
-lt's for you.
-Thank you.

67
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:03,053
-Baby, l'm still with the Chief.
-No respect.

68
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,155
No, he's really not happy now.

69
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:09,066
Okay, l got to go. Bye. Thanks, Chief.

70
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:15,638
You guys are.... Get this place cleaned up.

71
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,104
l expect to have a full report
on my desk tomorrow.

72
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,147
-Yes, sir.
-And in the meantime...

73
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:24,378
l'm checking with the Bureau
to see if they got any openings...

74
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,443
in lraq.

75
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:34,558
The Dynamic Duo strikes again.
Way to go, Baskin and Robbin.

76
00:07:37,231 --> 00:07:40,394
Or is it Häag and Dazs?

77
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,835
Häag and Dazs. You wrote that?

78
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,839
That's good, l like that.

79
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:49,774
-Later, Häag.
<i>-Adiós,</i> Dazs.

80
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,443
-l hate those guys, dude.
-Oh, God.

81
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:58,147
All right.
Well, let's get this place cleaned up.

82
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:00,687
-All right.
-Okay, so, you do the floor.

83
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:03,781
Clean all the ice cream up
and l'll go warm the car up.

84
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:17,196
Okay. So much for a hot meal.

85
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,375
-Hey, baby.
-Don't ''hey, baby'' me.

86
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:27,881
l can't believe you have me
sitting here all night worried about you.

87
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:29,575
All night? Baby...

88
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,614
it's only 8:00.

89
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:36,653
Look, after work, me and Kevin went
down to the bar and had a couple of drinks.

90
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,421
l know. l called the bar.
They said you left at 7:45.

91
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:43,930
l checked MapQuest. lt only takes
six minutes to get there from here.

92
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:46,660
So, if you got somebody on the side,
you need to tell me.

93
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,134
Baby, listen to what you just say.

94
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:53,435
MapQuest said it takes six minutes
to get here. l got here in eight.

95
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,771
Which means there's two minutes
unaccounted for.

96
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:59,802
lf l was cheating on you, don't you think
l'd need more than two minutes?

97
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,580
You know what?
l ain't going to deal with this.

98
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:07,178
l'm tired, okay?
l had a long day at work. l got shot at.

99
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:10,087
See, that is exactly what l'm talking about.

100
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:11,818
We don't communicate.

101
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:15,692
-Okay, fine. You want to communicate?
-Yes.

102
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:19,656
Come on. Let's communicate. Okay?

103
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,727
Okay. Let's start with last week.

104
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:23,861
Last week.

105
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,430
You and l were supposed
to go shopping together. We get to the mall.

106
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,568
l buy this beautiful dress,
l get my hair done.

107
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:35,312
You don't say anything. l don't know,
maybe you just don't want to....

108
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:40,815
Did you hear me just now?

109
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:42,449
Tell me what l said.

110
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:44,388
l heard everything. You was communicating.

111
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,325
Don't play with me right now.
l am not in the mood.

112
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:50,124
l cannot believe you came home late
and then you start....

113
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:54,531
Marcus! You are falling asleep again.
l am talking to you.

114
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:57,696
l wasn't asleep, l was closing my eyes
and visualizing your words.

115
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,671
Oh, really? Visualizing?

116
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:02,867
Why don't you paint me a picture
of what l just said?

117
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:05,070
-Hold on.
-You know why?

118
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,581
Because you are
falling asleep again. Marcus!

119
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,116
Well, if it isn't Ben and Jerry.

120
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:18,520
Let me ask you guys a question.

121
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:22,392
When the Chief goes to the bathroom,
which one of you guys holds his balls...

122
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:23,794
and which one wipes?

123
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:28,130
-That's the ball holder there.
-Yep. You can tell by the cup in his hand.

124
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:32,901
See, that is exactly the attitude that's going
to keep you guys working the shit detail...

125
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:35,771
while we're working
the socialite kidnapping case.

126
00:10:37,044 --> 00:10:39,308
You guys got the socialite kidnapping case?

127
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,608
That's right.

128
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:44,242
What's that?
Oh, l think l hear the Chief flushing.

129
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:47,777
We'd better get going.
Whose turn is it to wipe? Yours?

130
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,619
l think it's your turn to wipe
and l'll hold the balls.

131
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,680
That's right.

132
00:10:55,596 --> 00:11:00,556
<i>We received this from Mr. Andrew Wilson,</i>
<i>CEO of Wilson Cruise Lines.</i>

133
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,639
<i>It was delivered to his home.</i>
<i>The girls in the photo are his daughters...</i>

134
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:08,773
<i>and heiresses to the Wilson fortune.</i>

135
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:12,371
<i>We believe</i>
<i>they are the kidnapper's next victims.</i>

136
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:16,748
<i>Mr. Wilson has given us permission</i>
<i>to shadow his daughters.</i>

137
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:19,047
<i>We're going to set up surveillance...</i>

138
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,677
<i>and if the kidnapper strikes...</i>

139
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:24,019
<i>this time we will be ready.</i>

140
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,925
Now, the Wilson sisters will be flying
into JFK this morning.

141
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,995
So who's going to pick them up?

142
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:38,030
Obviously, everyone has read
the profile on the girls.

143
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,174
Still, somebody's got to do it.

144
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,204
l don't think this is a good idea.

145
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:47,270
l don't care. We deserve to be on this case
just as much as Gomez and Harper.

146
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:50,181
l know, but we don't want
to interrupt the man in a briefing.

147
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,549
Well, somebody got to stand up to him.

148
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:55,621
-Chief.
-What?

149
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,554
-Marcus has something he want to tell you.
-What?

150
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,753
Chief, we just want to know
if we could get on the case.

151
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:02,921
You're on.

152
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:08,066
The boys over at lntel seem to think
that the kidnapper's a guy...

153
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:09,397
named Ted Burton.

154
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,563
lt says Burton was a partner of Wilson's...

155
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,665
and some other associates
in some business venture that failed.

156
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:18,337
Says he spent time in the Federal pen
and lost his fortune.

157
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:22,439
Guy's been MlA since his release and those
dates coincide with the first kidnappings.

158
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:25,508
-What do you think?
-l think this babysitting gig sucks.

159
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,917
Dude, relax.

160
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:29,478
Look, man.
All we got to do is pick these chicks up...

161
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:33,151
drop their ass off in the Hamptons,
then we back in the Chief's good graces.

162
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:35,195
l didn't join the FBl to become a nanny.

163
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,389
l want to be on the street
where the action is.

164
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:41,230
Okay, Blackie Chan, and you'll get there.
Can we just do this first, please?

165
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,567
-All right.
-You didn't put dairy in this, did you?

166
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:47,465
-No.
-Because you know l'm lactose intolerant.

167
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,509
Last time, l barely made it to the bathroom.

168
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:52,044
Why would l want to disturb your stomach?

169
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,180
There goes your girls.

170
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:58,515
Come on, man. Let's do this.

171
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,623
-Hi, l'm Kevin Copeland. This is--
-We already gave to the United Negro Fund.

172
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,724
-Wait. Hold on.
-Excuse us.

173
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:17,329
We're actually here
to escort you ladies to the Hamptons.

174
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,872
The bags are on the plane.
Take Baby and clean out his bag.

175
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:24,104
He didn't have his colonic
and he like pooped everywhere.

176
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,281
-What's this?
-Baby got to ride in the car seat.

177
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:38,720
Where the hell am l supposed to sit?

178
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,157
This ain't right.

179
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:56,373
Man, you guys sure got a lot of bags
for a weekend.

180
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,977
-This isn't a weekend.
-lt's the weekend.

181
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:04,676
Labor Day in the Hamptons.
The last weekend of the social season.

182
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:06,810
Only the hottest people
are going to be there.

183
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,823
And only the hottest of the hottest
are going to make it onto the cover...

184
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,860
of <i>Hamptons Magazine.</i> And this is our year.

185
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:18,497
Open the window.
Baby likes a little fresh breeze.

186
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:22,057
l just hope the Vandergeld sisters'
private jet crashes on the way there.

187
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:25,071
-Oh, my God, Brittany!
-You were thinking it!

188
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,437
-l know, but you said it.
-l know.

189
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:30,944
You know Heather totally hates you
because you slept with her boyfriend.

190
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:34,276
My God. So what?
l sleep with everyone's boyfriend.

191
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:15,214
ls everybody all right?

192
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,881
My God! Your lip.

193
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,789
My God! Your nose.

194
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:25,463
Marcus, are you okay?

195
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,128
-l'm cool.
-Baby's in a wreck!

196
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,862
l can't believe...

197
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:36,638
you think we're going to go to the Hamptons
with my face looking like that.

198
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:40,275
lt's really not that bad.
Just get some makeup and cover it up.

199
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:42,611
Put makeup on this?

200
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:46,476
l am so fricking pissed.

201
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,485
My God, this is like the worst day of my life.

202
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:51,490
l went to go get my brows done...

203
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:53,685
and l told her to make me look like J-Lo.

204
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,388
And then that fricking Russian toad
made me look...

205
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:58,693
like Liza Minnelli or something.

206
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:02,458
Oh, my God! l'm going to have a B.F.

207
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,269
Wait. What's a B.F.?

208
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,363
She's going to have a bitch fit!

209
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,136
-You better get out of here.
-l am going to call your boss.

210
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:12,474
-You don't have to do that.
-No, l'll call the owner of the company.

211
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:15,606
Come on, just take it easy.
Look, we can work this out.

212
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,580
-l'm going to write a letter.
-No.

213
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:21,246
Please don't write a letter.
Look, just calm down.

214
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,846
You guys just stay here.
Stay here the whole weekend.

215
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:27,052
Do whatever you want. But whatever you do,
do not leave this room.

216
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:31,154
Don't leave this room, because if you do,
everyone's gonna see those hideous scars.

217
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,630
Scar?

218
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:37,329
-My God! Permanent damage.
-My life is over.

219
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:41,572
lf l lose this job with these good benefits,
Gina's gonna kill me.

220
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,906
-Well?
-They won't go.

221
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:50,381
-What do you mean, they won't go?
-They won't go.

222
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,749
Marcus, this weekend in the Hamptons
means everything for these girls.

223
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,223
They won't show up with a scratched-up
nose and a busted lip for nobody.

224
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:04,595
That's cool.

225
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,724
What are you doing?

226
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:10,235
l'm just going to kill myself before
the Chief does.

227
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:11,862
-Bye-bye, Kevin.
-Come on.

228
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,600
Don't do that. Stop being ridiculous.

229
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:15,801
l'm not being ridiculous. You heard the man.

230
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:17,571
One more screw-up, and we're through.

231
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:20,670
-l know, man.
-See? That's probably him right now.

232
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:23,440
Hey, what's up, Chief?

233
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:25,781
There's something me and Kevin
want to tell you.

234
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:28,082
Yeah, Chief? Hey.

235
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:31,622
Me and Marcus just wanted to thank you
for the opportunity, man.

236
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,159
No, we didn't.

237
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:35,057
Yeah, we really appreciate it.

238
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:37,426
They wanted to stop off
and get something to eat.

239
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:38,759
He's lying to--

240
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:43,766
Two, three hours max.

241
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:45,730
Trust me.

242
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:50,140
lf l don't have them there in three hours,
l'll cut them off and mail them to you myself.

243
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,111
-All right, take care. Bye.
-He lied, Chief.

244
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:58,242
Why did you do that? You know them girls
aren't going to be there.

245
00:17:58,352 --> 00:17:59,979
They'll be there.

246
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:02,711
Hey, Josh.

247
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,422
How'd you like to be part of the team?

248
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:08,417
Where are the white women at?

249
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,757
Let's do this.

250
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,910
He's right. Make them bigger.

251
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,545
Chief. They're here.

252
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:39,142
All right, the girls are yours.
Stick with them. Don't blow your cover.

253
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,208
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,217
-Are you sure this is going to work?
-Just trust me. Follow my lead.

255
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,411
What's up, money? You got a problem?
What you looking at my ass for?

256
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:09,346
No, yo, hold my poodle.

257
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,283
What's up? Y'all got a problem?
Y'all want some of this?

258
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:15,150
You want some of this, punk? What, boy?

259
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:17,690
-l'll take the both of you.
-Let's get out of here.

260
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,057
-l got this for you. Kiss my black ass!
-Cut it out.

261
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:23,995
-He was looking at my ass like l'm a girl.
-You are a girl!

262
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:27,898
And you better start acting like one
or you're going to be an unemployed girl.

263
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:30,960
Damn. l'd sure like to cut that cake.

264
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,731
Here, yo, hold this!

265
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:34,740
Hey, you trying to look at my lumps?

266
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:36,901
l'll pull off my G-string and handle mine.

267
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:39,070
-l'll handle mine.
-Kevin, it's Gomez.

268
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,644
Welcome to the Royal Hamptons Hotel.

269
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:45,617
-The bags are in the car, José.
-The name is Gomez.

270
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:48,347
-Whatever.
-Yeah, great. Here. Take Baby.

271
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,049
Clean out his bag.
Poor thing just pooped everywhere.

272
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,319
And teach him how to say,
<i>''Quiero</i> Taco Bell.''

273
00:20:53,393 --> 00:20:56,157
-Thanks a lot, Rico Suave. <i>Grazie.</i>
-Thanks, Julio.

274
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:57,890
Right away, ma'am.

275
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,432
Sweetie, you've got to slow up
with those Cosmos.

276
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:15,310
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, checking in.

277
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:17,875
Sorry. They're new.

278
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:22,018
-Dr. Dorfman did an amazing job.
-They feel so real.

279
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:27,550

00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:41,272
-Ma'am, l--
-First of all...

284
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,538
l go to Dr. Dorfman.
He totally messes up my nose job.

285
00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:47,671
l ask him to make me
look like Gwyneth Paltrow.

286
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:52,077
l get off the surgery table
looking like freaking Shrek.

287
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:56,782
Then l get here, and Mr. Harper...

288
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,884
makes me feel like
l'm some dumb blonde with fake boobs...

289
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:03,095
going to a Hugh Hefner party.

290
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,097
No. l didn't mean to offend you.

00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:07,429
-lt's just protocol.
-l'm going to have a B.F.

292
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,798
My God. She's going to have a bitch fit.

293
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,704
No. Don't have a B.F. now--

294
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:17,470
l want to speak to your supervisor.
Better yet, l'm going to write a letter.

295
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,308
-Miss, there's no reason to--
-You are in big trouble.

296
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,281

299
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:34,718
-''in America.''
-Ladies, is there a problem here?

300
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,318
-Yes.
-No.

301
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:38,795
There's no problem.

302
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:41,425

-What a sweetheart.
-Here you are. Enjoy your stay.

307
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:56,409
Has anyone ever told you
you look just like Denzel Washington?

308
00:22:57,784 --> 00:23:02,278
Yes, actually l have heard it once or twice.

309
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,590
What a beautiful chocolate man.

310
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:11,159
Beautiful. God.

311
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,425
-That was close.

-What are we going to do?
-Just act friendly.

314
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:26,208
My God.

315
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,483
Well, don't act like you don't know us.

316
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,281
Karen, Lisa, Tori.

317
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:41,551
Oh, my God.

318
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:45,464
l haven't seen you in forever.

319
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:47,059
lt's only been a year.

320
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:50,034
Did you do something different
to your hair?

321
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,967
-No.
-You gain weight?

322
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:56,734
-No.
-l know! You just had a birthday.

323
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:02,174
-Yeah.
-Totally. Total fire sign. l knew it.

324
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:04,148
-l totally knew it.
-Wait a minute.

325
00:24:04,217 --> 00:24:06,742
There is definitely...

326
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:09,555
something different about the two of you.

327
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:16,357
Collagen.

328
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:21,565
You little witch. How did you know?

329
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:26,537
Duh, it's totally obvious.
Your lips went from Cameron Diaz to Jay-Z.

330
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:32,306
You got taller, too.

331
00:24:34,614 --> 00:24:36,479
We got our knees done.

332
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,716
You can do that?

333
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:41,276
-You should do that.
-Yes.

334
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,822
Well, it was really good
seeing you ladies. Bye.

335
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,358
Excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?

336
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,426
To go freshen up.

337
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:52,226
The <i>Hamptons Magazine</i> reception
just started, so let's hit it.

338
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,264
Hey, check it out.

339
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:01,136
Are those the Wilson sisters?

340
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:05,644
More like the Wilt Chamberlain sisters.
l never noticed how big they are.

341
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:08,475
But l'd still bone.

342
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,215
My God. There's Heath.

343
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:19,115
Dude, are you hitting Karen Googlestein,
the soap heiress, too?

344
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:20,989
How do you keep that shit dangling?

345
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,621
l keep telling her l'm going to break
up with my girl.

346
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,596
You better hope Heather doesn't find out.

347
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:26,996
She won't.

348
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:30,100
At least until l wrap up this big deal
with her father.

349
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,535
Hey, Mr. V.

350
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,969
And look, there they are.
The fen-phen twins.

351
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:41,111
They're hot.

352
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,208
What, are you blind?

353
00:25:43,283 --> 00:25:45,342
That's Heather and Megan Vandergeld.

354
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,478
Your sworn enemies since you were like,
l don't know. Eight?

355
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:51,490
Did l say hot? l meant not.

356
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:54,520
-l totally hate them.
-Did you guys hear about Megan?

357
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,724
She got stopped by security at Saks
trying to pull a Winona.

358
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:07,197
God. Come on.

359
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:15,737
-This is going to be fun.
-Move.

360
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:20,481
Look who just flew in from the slums
of Beverly Hills.

361
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,015
lt's The Beverly Ho-billies.

362
00:26:25,658 --> 00:26:29,094
-Squeeze me?
-No, you didn't.

363
00:26:29,662 --> 00:26:32,495
l'm sorry, but we just saw your new video.

364
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:35,227
They had a screening
over at Saks Fifth Avenue...

365
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:37,201
in the security office.

366
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:40,405
A klept-ho-maniac.

367
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:45,743
Your mother shops at Saks.

368
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,738
What?

369
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:54,375
My God. You want to talk about mothers?

370
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,924
You want to talk about mothers.

371
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,825
lt's mother time. Okay.

372
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:05,456
Your mother's so dumb
she went to Dr. Dre for a Pap smear.

373
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:09,229
''Something's wrong, Dr. Dre.
My coochie's doing a beatbox.''

374
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:11,532
Yeah? Well, your mother is so stupid...

375
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:14,004
she exercises when she could just get...

376
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:16,064
liposuction or something.

377
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:20,669
Your mother's so old that her breast milk
is powdered. You breast-feed like this.

378
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:25,341
Your mother is so, like....

379
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,518
She's so....

380
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,445
Megan, you go.

381
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:32,914
Your mother is so stupid...

382
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,893
that she goes to Barneys Rooftop
Deck Restaurant for lunch...

383
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:39,989
and orders a <i>niçoise</i> salad and calls it
a ''ni-coise'' salad.

384
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:41,863
''Ni-coise'' salad, right?

385
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:44,027
Your mother's ass is so hairy...

386
00:27:44,103 --> 00:27:48,335
it looks like Don King's about to pop out
and say, ''Only in America!''

387
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,570
Your mother's so stupid...

388
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:54,409
that she goes into Gucci
and she tries to buy, like, Fendi and stuff.

389
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,576
Megan, Heather. Come on now, girls.
ls this any way to speak to your guests?

390
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,679
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson.

391
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:05,383
l haven't seen you since you were smaller.

392
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:08,818
Yeah. Well, we're all grown up now.

393
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,590
Yeah, l can see that.

394
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:13,860
Ladies, l fully expect
to see you later at the White Party.

395
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:17,562
-l think it's gonna be the best one ever.
-We'll be there.

396
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:21,470
-Take care. Bye. Good seeing you again.
-Bye, Mr. V.

397
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,006
This isn't over yet.

398
00:28:26,112 --> 00:28:29,411
This is a long weekend.
You better watch your back.

399
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,081
-Ladies.
-Whatever.

400
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,884
l can't believe you guys just did that
to the Vandergelds.

401
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:42,587
You know, they could take you
off the scene just like that.

402
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:46,758
-Yeah, but it was so cool, you guys.
-So cool.

403
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,564
lsn't that Denise Porter from <i>NY1 News?</i>

404
00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:56,039
Yeah, l'm working on getting you
an interview with her.

405
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,542
Great for your image.

406
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,704
l think l'll go over there
and introduce myself.

407
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:04,144
-Do you think now's a good time?
-Actually, it's a perfect time.

408
00:29:04,217 --> 00:29:07,448
-Wouldn't want to miss a photo op.
-Never that.

409
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,782
-See you later.
-Have fun.

410
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:11,255
-What's wrong? Did you just get cramps?
-Yeah.

411
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:14,487
-Do you need a tamp?
-Heating pad?

412
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,960
-Hors d'oeuvres?
-Thank you, Wolfgang Paco.

413
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:21,658
Would you give that to Baby? Thank you.

414
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:24,764
-Bye, Chico. <i>Vamonos.</i>
<i>-Bon appétit.</i>

415
00:29:25,405 --> 00:29:26,895
l'll have one.

416
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,671
-Hi, my name is--
-Brittany Wilson, of course.

417
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:35,112
Yeah. How'd you know? Brittany Wilson.

418
00:29:35,415 --> 00:29:37,042
Well, it's my job to know.

419
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:41,917
Your publicist, Tori, has been calling me
nonstop about setting up an interview.

420
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:46,857
lf l would've known you were so beautiful,
l probably would've called you myself.

421
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,624
Well, if l wasn't mistaken, l'd think
you were flirting with me, Miss Wilson.

422
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:58,431
Me? Flirting with you? A girl? Never.

423
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:03,203
Sorry, honey. l don't eat sushi. Strictly beef.

424
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:08,941
-Boy, you're really strong, aren't you?
-lt's from all that protein.

425
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:14,184
My God. These are delicious.

426
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:18,119
You might want to slow down
on the cheese.

427
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:23,425
You mean, there's cheese,
as in dairy cheese?

428
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,893
Yeah. Unless you know another way
to make quiche.

429
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:35,706
-Ladies, l think l got to go to the bathroom.
-Good. We'll come with.

430
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:38,642
No, l can handle it myself.
Thank you, though.

431
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,305
Like we're going to let you go alone.

432
00:30:42,248 --> 00:30:44,239
Time for touchups anyway.

433
00:30:45,618 --> 00:30:47,017
Move, bitch.

434
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:06,870
My God, you guys.
Heath is here. What should l do?

435
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:08,930
l don't understand what you see in him.

436
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:11,738
He's an out-of-work actor
living in a share house.

437
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,870
And he drives a 3 Series BMW.

438
00:31:17,216 --> 00:31:20,481
Tori, l really think that you need
to cut Heath a little bit of slack.

439
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:23,613
His aunt died three years ago
and he really needs new headshots.

440
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:26,988
He's just going through
a really rough time right now. Okay?

441
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,762
You okay?

442
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,501
Everything all right in there?

443
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,640
lt's fine. Shit.

444
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:47,039
Tiff, we're just going to
meet you outside. Okay?

445
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:53,983
Love you.

446
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,520
Man, it may be summertime
in the Hamptons...

447
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:03,084
but it is snowing up in here.

448
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:07,923
Tony, hand me my boots
because l'm about to go skiing.

449
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:12,596
-Great game last night, Latrell.
-That's what l do, baby.

450
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,239
Now that's what l'm talking about.

451
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,282
A white girl with a black girl's ass.

452
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,186
l'm taking that home to Mama.

453
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:33,856
Pardon me.

454
00:32:34,393 --> 00:32:36,827
Santa must've come early this year...

455
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,064
because you were first on my Christmas list.

456
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:42,096
There it is, right there.

457
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:46,366
l want to know. Are you naughty or nice?

458
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,065
Sorry, l'm not interested.

459
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:55,613
-l'll take that as naughty.
-Naughty.

460
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:57,677
You know what they say:

461
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,208
''Once you go black,
you're going to need a wheelchair.''

462
00:33:01,954 --> 00:33:04,616
Hey, Latrell. l had a great time last night.

463
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:10,261
-Okay, call me later.
-As l was saying....

464
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:14,331
Look, King Kong. Why don't you take you
and your 1980 pickup lines...

465
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,166
climb the Empire State Building,
beat on your big old monkey chest...

466
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:20,569
and then jump off? Excuse me.

467
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,031
Hold up, hold on now. l'll get the--

468
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:26,010
-This is no joke, man.
-Get your hands off me, man.

469
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,449
She don't know it yet,
but that's wifey right there.

470
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:35,253
<i>Hello, everybody. For just one second.</i>

471
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:38,449
<i>I'm Warren Vandergeld.</i>
<i>I'm sure most of you know me.</i>

474
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:49,897
<i>So bring your checkbook...</i>

475
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:53,268
<i>dress to impress,</i>
<i>and we'll see you there. Have fun.</i>

476
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,733
-So what are you going to wear?
-This?

477
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,841
You're so funny.

478
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,486
Ladies, you know what this means.

479
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:10,311
Shopping!

480
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:19,196
<i>And now, the Number One</i>
<i>most requested song on WQQR....</i>

481
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:25,232
-lt's our jam.
-This is our jam, ladies. Come on.

482
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,836
Ready? Five, six, seven, eight...

00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,910
<i>Making my way downtown</i>
<i>Walking fast</i>

484

<i>Faces pass</i>
<i>And I'm home bound</i>

<i>Making a way</i>
<i>Through the crowd</i>

487
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:48,625
Take it, Tiff and Britt. This is your verse.

488
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,486
<i>Into the sky</i>

489
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:56,433

<i>'Cause you know I'd walk</i>
<i>A thousand miles</i>

<i>feel a nigga</i>

496
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:21,057
Guys. l can't believe that you just said that.

497
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,791
Said what?

498
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:24,996
The ''N'' word.

499
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:32,767
-So? Nobody's around.

-Hello?
-Hi, baby.

00:36:54,854 --> 00:36:56,253
What's up, baby?

518
00:36:56,322 --> 00:37:00,258
l'm getting my hair done, and l was thinking
that we could go to the movies.

519
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,986
<i>How's that sound?</i>

520
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,460
-l'm back.
-Who is that?

521
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,564
You're never going to get that big old head
in this tiny hole.

522
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,094
-Here, let me help you.
-Hold on.

00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,162
-l'll hold it open while you put it in.
-Okay.

524
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,935
What is she holding open?

525
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:21,240
-Push it. lt's almost in.
-What is almost in? Marcus.

526
00:37:24,683 --> 00:37:28,449
Marcus Anthony Copeland ll,

527
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,590
-lt's so tight.
-Tight?

528
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,023
The only thing's that's going to be tight
is my foot down your throat.

529
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:37,119
You better answer me!

530
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:38,925
lt's a perfect fit.

531

-l can't believe what l just heard.
-l told you.

532
00:37:46,672 --> 00:37:48,162
l'm exhausted.

533
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:52,402
Gina. Damn. Hello? Baby?

534
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:09,158
What do you think?

535
00:38:09,228 --> 00:38:13,824
That looks so sexy.

536
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:18,661
Are you kidding?

537
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:23,674
''Hi, l'm Cellulite Sally.
Look at my huge bedonkey.''

538
00:38:23,742 --> 00:38:26,302
''And don't forget about me.
l'm Back Fat Betty.''

539
00:38:26,378 --> 00:38:27,845
Now who could have said that?

540
00:38:27,913 --> 00:38:31,371
Yeah, it's Tina the Talking Tummy.

541
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:34,418
l can't even wear a short skirt...

542
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:37,944
and a top without looking like a fat pig.

543
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,727
Calm down. l'll go see if there's something
else out there for you. Okay?

544
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:50,223
Do you think Heath will love....
Do you need help?

545
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,839
l think l need a bigger size.

546
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:57,069
Honey, you never need a bigger size.
Come here.

547
00:38:57,142 --> 00:39:00,441
Let me show you a little trick.
Brace yourself.

548
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,113
Suck it in. Squeeze those cheeks, sister.

549
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:07,745
Suck it in. Come on. Work with me.

550
00:39:08,587 --> 00:39:12,216
Don't give up on me.
You can do this. Suck it in.

551
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:16,317
Now that looks totally cute.

552
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,260
My God! Are you kidding?

553
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:22,733
''Hi, l'm Carnie Wilson before my
gastric bypass surgery.''

554
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:25,736
Well, what about this?
This goes with your skin tone.

555
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:28,932
Somebody throw Shamu back in the ocean!

556
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:32,536
Okay. Let me get you something else. Okay?

557
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,344
How's that?

558
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,216
l can't breathe.

559
00:39:39,618 --> 00:39:42,212
Honey, this is just not going to work.
l'm sorry.

560
00:39:42,288 --> 00:39:45,416
Well, of course not.
You're wearing the wrong underwear.

561
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:49,217
ls that better?

562
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,464
l can taste the leather.

563
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:56,724
Okay, you need a pair of hot shoes.
What size do you wear again?

564
00:39:57,736 --> 00:39:59,328
-Fourteen.
-What?

565
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:08,643
Do you think you could bring us a size 10?

566
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:10,272
-A what?
-A 10.

567
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:11,338
lt's an open-toed slide.

568
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:14,079
lt gives you two sizes in the front
and two in the back.

569
00:40:14,153 --> 00:40:17,850
-What about these? This one's--
-You bitch! That's so terrible.

570
00:40:17,923 --> 00:40:20,187
Let me go
and see if there's some help out there.

571
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:23,092
Some professional help.
You need professional help. Hang on.

572
00:40:23,162 --> 00:40:26,063
-Okay.
-Dr. Phil!

573
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,558
Oprah. Somebody, help me.

574
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,968
Come on out, honey. Let's see.

575
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:39,878
lt is absolutely fabulous.
lf you don't buy it, l'm buying it for myself.

576
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,377
l don't know. Stand up straight.

577
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,289
Turn around.

578
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,989
Honey, just relax. Breathe.

579
00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:14,469
You know what? Maybe a nice dress.

580
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:18,307
Okay. Who would you do?

581
00:41:18,784 --> 00:41:22,117
-Janet Reno or Rosie O'Donnell?
-Oh, come on.

582
00:41:22,187 --> 00:41:24,121
You've got to kiss and go down on them.

583
00:41:24,189 --> 00:41:27,556
-What! Are you kidding me?
-And death is not an option.

584
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,827
l don't know. Rosie.

585
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:35,900
-You're a pig. That's disgusting.
-What are you talking about?

586
00:41:35,968 --> 00:41:38,994
-Rosie's all right.
-Heads up. Here they are.

587
00:41:41,407 --> 00:41:44,467
-Hold on. Who would you do?
-No time. We're on the job.

588
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,409
-He's got my gun and badge.
-Go get him!

589
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:53,684
Get in! Get in the car.

590
00:41:56,455 --> 00:41:58,252
My God, l need a cigarette!

591
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:02,490
-Can you believe this?
-What do we do?

592
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,086
We follow them.
But we can't blow our cover.

593
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,300
-Give me back my bag.
-Oh, man.

594
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,170
l'll rip your head off.

595
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:15,900
Your ass is mine.

596
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:19,468
What is this girl, a track star?

597
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,646
You messed
with the wrong blonde today, pal.

598
00:42:38,864 --> 00:42:41,094
-Holy Christ.
-Now l'm pissed.

599
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,563
l think she's bionic, dude.

600
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,308
Holy smokes.

601
00:42:53,345 --> 00:42:57,281
-That was nice.
-Jeez, lady. All that for a bag?

602
00:42:57,983 --> 00:43:01,475
lt's not just a bag. lt's Prada.

603
00:43:11,263 --> 00:43:13,993
-lt was like a reality show.
-lt was so cool.

604
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:41,924
-Right behind you.
-Nice going, Tori.

605
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,828
Way to get us sat at the losers' table.
l thought you had it all hooked up.

606
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:48,389
Excuse me. l do have the hook-up.

607
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:51,400
Don't blame me.
Blame Little Miss Def Jam over here...

608
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,870
who had to go, ''Yo' mama''
on the Vandergelds.

609
00:43:53,939 --> 00:43:55,429
We could be finished in this town.

610
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,806
-Somebody had to stand up to those guys.
-They're the ''it'' girls.

611
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:01,812
-That's the way it's always been.
-Whatever.

612
00:44:04,983 --> 00:44:07,178
Honey, quick. Give me a pat.

613
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:11,453
No, a powder for my nose. Quick.

614
00:44:14,726 --> 00:44:15,920
Thanks.

615
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:21,228
No, l'm just kidding.

616
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:32,373
l tried to call you,
but your number changed?

617
00:44:33,512 --> 00:44:35,844
Yeah, l know. l changed it.

618
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,414
Anyway, so, l was just wondering if maybe...

619
00:44:42,387 --> 00:44:43,979
later we could--

620
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:49,027
Hello. Where have you been all night?
l've been looking all over for you.

621
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:53,956
Why are you talking to her?

622
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,035
Clean it up, coke whore.

623
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,635
Do you have any more of that?

624
00:45:03,709 --> 00:45:05,734
Don't hate me because you ain't me.

625
00:45:05,811 --> 00:45:07,938
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

626
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:10,174
<i>Gentlemen, get out your wallets...</i>

627
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,274
<i>because you'll be bidding on a date...</i>

628
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:15,548
<i>with some of Hamptons'</i>
<i>most eligible bachelorettes.</i>

629
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:18,021
<i>First up, yours truly.</i>

630
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,582
<i>Who wants to start the bidding?</i>

631
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,225
-$500?
<i>-$500.</i>

632
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:30,126
<i>Okay. Do I hear $1,000?</i>

633
00:45:30,669 --> 00:45:33,695
Well, looks like we're all
on the Vandergelds' D-list.

634
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,637
-ls this seat taken?
-Oh, no. Have a seat.

635
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,044
Can you believe this?
They're actually auctioning off women.

636
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:48,479
-Would you ever do anything like that?
-Well, it's for a good cause.

637
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:52,052
Besides, being wined and dined
by a rich guy might be nice.

638
00:45:53,225 --> 00:45:55,420
l see, so you like rich guys?

639
00:45:55,594 --> 00:45:58,722
lt might be a pleasant change
from all the losers that ask me out.

640
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,424
-$3,000.
<i>-That's good.</i>

641
00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:01,523
l see.

642
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,067
<i>But I think that we can do better than that.</i>

643
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,832
-$20,000.
<i>-Sold.</i>

644
00:46:07,472 --> 00:46:11,636
<i>$20,000. That is a new record.</i>

645
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,472
That is very good.

646
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:19,947
<i>Next to be auctioned is Tiffany Wilson.</i>

647
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:23,353
-That's you.
-Me?

648
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,291
You better do something.

649
00:46:26,692 --> 00:46:29,286
Excuse me, honey. l'll be right back.

650
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,633
<i>Who wants to start the bidding?</i>

651
00:46:38,737 --> 00:46:39,761
$4.

652
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,103
<i>$4. Do I hear $5?</i>

653
00:46:46,812 --> 00:46:48,712
$1,000.

654
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:52,807
<i>$1,000. Does anyone wish to go higher?</i>

655
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,952
Yeah, l got $2,000 right here.

656
00:46:56,121 --> 00:46:58,282

<i>Who said that?</i>

659

<i>$5,000 to the dirty geezer in the back.</i>

660
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:09,930
<i>I'm sure no one will wish</i>
<i>to go higher than that...</i>

661
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:11,559
<i>so we can just be done with it now.</i>

662
00:47:11,636 --> 00:47:13,900
$10,000.

663
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,934
$20,000.

664
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:21,435
<i>$20,000! Going once, going twice--</i>

665
00:47:21,513 --> 00:47:25,847

666
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:30,079
Fine.

667
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:32,483
Sold...

668
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:35,358
to the big black guy right there.

669
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:38,088
Step right up and claim your prize.

670
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,202
l don't want
to go on a date with Buff Daddy.

671
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,862
Come here, baby.

672
00:47:53,779 --> 00:47:56,577
Dude, my feet are killing me.

673
00:47:57,516 --> 00:48:00,917
And on top of that, that G-string
gave me diaper rash.

674
00:48:00,986 --> 00:48:03,887
-How long we got to do this, man?
-Just a couple more days.

675
00:48:03,955 --> 00:48:07,152
l don't have a couple of more days.
Do you know who my wife is?

676
00:48:07,225 --> 00:48:10,217
Here, listen to this message.
She's losing her mind.

677
00:48:10,595 --> 00:48:13,223
<i>...with another woman</i>
<i>doing what I think you're doing!</i>

678
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:14,697
You don't want to hear the rest.

679
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:18,930
By the end of the weekend,
we'll be heroes and all will be forgiven.

680
00:48:19,671 --> 00:48:21,002
All right.

681
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:25,368
-You order room service?
-No.

682
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:31,179
Who is it?

683
00:48:36,188 --> 00:48:38,383
Damn! These girls won't quit.

684
00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:43,021
We'll be right there. We're coming. Hang on.

685
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,357
-Open up!
-Open.

686
00:48:47,432 --> 00:48:48,694
One second.

687
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:51,531
We'll be right there. Hang on.

688
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,600
The ice cream's melting!

689
00:48:53,672 --> 00:48:57,733
Hold tight, girls!
We're just shaving our feet, okay?

690
00:48:58,877 --> 00:49:00,902
And braiding our vaginas.

691
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,853
What, did you guys forget?
lt's your turn to host the slumber party.

692
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:23,363
Okay, you guys. What does it mean...

693
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:27,331
when a guy is in a really bad relationship...

694
00:49:27,572 --> 00:49:31,201
and it's really obvious
that he wants to be with you...

695
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,274
but he just can't seem to break up with
his girlfriend?

696
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,712
lt means you're a total booty call.

697
00:49:37,816 --> 00:49:40,649
-My God! Brittany!
-Well, you were thinking it.

698
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:42,380
Well, you said it.

699
00:49:42,554 --> 00:49:45,216
You know,
sometimes you sound just like a man.

700
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,951
So l've been told.

701
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,654
What she means to say, honey...

702
00:49:50,729 --> 00:49:55,325
is maybe you're just making yourself
just a little bit too, like, available.

703
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:57,864
Come on, you guys.

704
00:49:58,236 --> 00:50:01,069
Don't act like you haven't done it before.

705
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:04,538
You know how it is
when you really care about someone.

706
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:05,940
You call them all day long...

707
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:08,411
because you just wanna know
how their day is going...

708
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,541
and what they're thinking about
and if they're thinking about you.

709
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:16,884
You spend all day trying to find
the perfect outfit.

710
00:50:16,988 --> 00:50:20,048
You even change your hairstyle
just so he'll take a second look.

711
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,990
But they never notice.

712
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,323
Sometimes l just wish
that they could trade places with us...

713
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,457
so that they would know how it feels.
You know?

714
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:32,268
Oh, my God. Look, it's Megan's commercial.

715
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:39,134
<i>I won't let genital herpes slow me down.</i>
<i>That's why I use Valtrum.</i>

716
00:50:39,277 --> 00:50:41,507
<i>Hey. You want to play with me?</i>

717
00:50:42,514 --> 00:50:43,640
<i>Sure.</i>

718
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:46,716
<i>I won't tell if you won't.</i>

719
00:50:46,785 --> 00:50:50,516
l so could have done that part.
She doesn't even have herpes.

720
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,855
-All done.
-Really?

721
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:59,962
My God! This is so cool.

722
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:01,293
You know something?

723
00:51:01,366 --> 00:51:04,130
l think you might have been black
in a previous life.

724
00:51:04,202 --> 00:51:06,102
Fo' shizzle, my nizzle.

725
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:10,039
Okay. Enough of this girls' talk, ladies.

726
00:51:10,141 --> 00:51:12,075
lt's time for some real fun.

727
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:16,973
Oh, yeah. That's what l'm talking about.

728
00:51:17,048 --> 00:51:19,141
Come on. Show us some of your skills.

729
00:51:19,684 --> 00:51:22,084
Yeah, totally. Learn some of your skills.

730
00:51:23,855 --> 00:51:25,516
-Actually--
-Go for it, sis.

731
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:29,117
-Tiffany's the expert.
-Yeah, but you made the video.

732
00:51:34,532 --> 00:51:36,159
Come on. Show us.

733
00:51:47,078 --> 00:51:50,309
You see, the first thing you do
is you gotta...

734
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:52,910
grab the thing here.

735
00:51:53,818 --> 00:51:56,013
Not too tight or you'll get calluses.

736
00:51:57,555 --> 00:52:00,991
Then you want to look that little sucker
in the eye...

737
00:52:01,626 --> 00:52:02,820
and go:

738
00:52:04,229 --> 00:52:06,561
''Come here, little guy.

739
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:08,997
''Come here, you little earthworm.''

740
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:13,235
You like that?
l learned that from an Eskimo porn.

741
00:52:13,438 --> 00:52:14,769
Come here.

742
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:20,405
And then l'm going to teach you guys
''The Deep Throat.''

743
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:25,715
You want to make sure the passage is clear
all the way from your throat to your chin...

744
00:52:25,817 --> 00:52:28,285
and you want to place the thing here.

745
00:52:28,553 --> 00:52:29,884
And you just wanna....

746
00:52:29,988 --> 00:52:33,253
Oh, yeah. You like that? You little freak.

747
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:37,156
-Guys like that?
-They love it.

748
00:52:37,629 --> 00:52:40,291
And another thing they love is this.

749
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,428
They love....

750
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:46,669
You like it? l call that ''The Headbanger.''

751
00:52:47,405 --> 00:52:50,374
-Don't you ever put it in your mouth?
-Never.

752
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:53,207
Never put it in the mouth. That's '80s.

753
00:52:53,278 --> 00:52:55,041
You might as well go and buy a TransAm.

754
00:52:55,113 --> 00:52:57,513
Okay. l'm ready. l think l can do it.

755
00:52:58,516 --> 00:52:59,949
Good catch.

756
00:53:00,785 --> 00:53:03,583
So you take the thing and you grab it...

757
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,520
but gentle, not to get calluses. Not pretty.

758
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:09,758
Then you look him dead in the eye
and you say:

759
00:53:11,529 --> 00:53:12,860
''Good boy.''

760
00:53:13,832 --> 00:53:15,424
You're scaring me.

761
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,331
And then comes the Headbanger.

762
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,927
Yeah. Tap.

763
00:53:22,974 --> 00:53:24,339
Well done.

764
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:28,978
All right, l got another one for you.
Carmen Electra or Pam Anderson?

765
00:53:30,315 --> 00:53:31,304
Easy.

766
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:34,078
But they both got a yeast infection.

767
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,147
Now that's tough.

768
00:53:41,693 --> 00:53:45,151
-l'm going to go with Pam Anderson.
-You're disgusting.

769
00:53:45,563 --> 00:53:48,430
-What?
-They got a yeast infection.

770
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:50,930
Who would you choose?

771
00:53:51,002 --> 00:53:53,869
Hey, Gomez. We got a couple of bogeys.

772
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,730
-No time.
-Oh, come on!

773
00:53:57,242 --> 00:53:59,642
lt's Pam Anderson, like you care.

774
00:54:03,214 --> 00:54:05,239
Run their faces. Let's go.

775
00:54:08,987 --> 00:54:11,387
-Brittany Wilson?
-Yeah, that's me.

776
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,946
Let's get her.

777
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,526
-Put the blindfold on her!
-Damn, this girl's strong.

778
00:54:33,611 --> 00:54:36,079
-Who do you work for?
-lntimate Fantasies!

779
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,842
My God. You need help?

780
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:42,478
What are you doing?
Those are the strippers, Raoul and Tito.

781
00:54:42,554 --> 00:54:43,885
Strippers?

782
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:51,560
-l thought they were going to kidnap me.
-That's part of their routine.

783
00:54:51,629 --> 00:54:55,190
Oh, my God! l am so sorry.

784
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:57,734
Hotel security! ls everything all right here?

785
00:54:57,802 --> 00:55:01,533
Everything is fine.
Just a little case of PMS. That's all.

786
00:55:01,606 --> 00:55:04,040
l'm just one big, emotional wreck.

787
00:55:04,142 --> 00:55:07,134
Could you guys go
get me some Midol and a Snickers?

788
00:55:07,212 --> 00:55:09,840
-Let's get out of here.
-My ass is fat.

789
00:55:10,148 --> 00:55:11,843
This is Harper. lt's all clear.

790
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:22,486
Okay, ladies. Let's focus.
We have to find the perfect spot.

791
00:55:23,394 --> 00:55:26,227
Would you look at these
starving kids in Africa.

792
00:55:26,297 --> 00:55:28,663
When l see them, l just want to cry.

793
00:55:29,234 --> 00:55:32,931
l mean, why can't l be that skinny?

794
00:55:34,272 --> 00:55:35,637
lt's okay, Megan.

795
00:55:36,641 --> 00:55:40,941
Just think. They can't wear belly rings
with those bloated tummies of theirs.

796
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,077
That's true.

797
00:55:45,617 --> 00:55:47,175
l feel so much better.

798
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,954
Skank alert.

799
00:55:59,697 --> 00:56:02,757
My God, girls.
l totally forgot my suntan lotion.

800
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:06,031
l'm gonna get some suntan lotion.
l'll be right back.

801
00:56:06,304 --> 00:56:07,498
Hey, Russ.

802
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,177
Hey, bro. Go long. l got a plan. Go.

803
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:29,220
Hey, yo! You do that again,
l'm going to bust....

804
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,663
l'll bust out in tears.

805
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,594
-lnbreds!
-You're a jerk.

806
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:43,997
My bad, sweetheart. Over here.
Don't hurt yourself.

807
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:47,144
Don't worry, l won't.

808
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:52,281
Sorry. Better lay off the spinach.

809
00:57:06,764 --> 00:57:09,528
Tony. Let's go hunting.

810
00:57:21,045 --> 00:57:25,345
-l'm so glad l got waxed today.
-Me, too. What did you get?

811
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,685
-The Bald Eagle.
-l got the Bermuda Triangle.

812
00:57:29,187 --> 00:57:30,586
The Landing Strip.

813
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,146
l got the Buckwheat.

814
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:35,851
Disgusting.

815
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,827
What a beautiful, sunny day.

816
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,441
Oh, my God. What happened to the sun?

817
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,475
Easy, white chocolate.

818
00:57:55,446 --> 00:57:57,277
l wouldn't want you to melt.

819
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,082
Yeah. <i>Hasta la vista,</i> Schwarzenegro. Bye.

820
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,590
Hey, kids! You guys want to make $5?

821
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:18,962
Okay, here's what l want you to do.

822
00:58:22,907 --> 00:58:26,434
Yeah, l'll take the usual.
And put it on my tab.

823
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:30,472
Hey, Latrell Spencer!
Could we have your autograph?

824
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:33,346
-Sure, little buddy.
-Thanks. You're the greatest.

825
00:58:33,418 --> 00:58:35,511
Hey, that's what l do, baby.

826
00:58:37,422 --> 00:58:39,253
-Sweet!
-Nice!

827
00:58:39,323 --> 00:58:42,224
-Hey, stay in school.
-Okay, we will!

828
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:47,023
-Wow! You must be pretty good.
-l'm all right.

829
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,797
Sometimes l feel l should be paying them
to take my autograph.

830
00:58:52,003 --> 00:58:54,699
l'm sorry, l didn't even get your name.

831
00:58:55,006 --> 00:58:58,999
Latrell. Latrell Spencer. And you are?

832
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:02,604
-Denise Porter.
-Denise. Denise Porter.

833
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:06,675
You know, you look so familiar.
l feel like l've seen you somewhere.

834
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:11,313
No. l play pro ball.
Maybe you've seen one of my games.

835
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:16,053
No. But l mean if l did, l'm sure
l would've definitely remembered you.

836
00:59:17,795 --> 00:59:20,992
Okay, well. Look, Denise...

837
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:23,926
l don't mean to be too forward or anything...

838
00:59:24,001 --> 00:59:26,993
but l'm here in town,
checking out some real estate, and--

839
00:59:27,071 --> 00:59:28,538
Oh, whereabouts?

840
00:59:29,006 --> 00:59:31,566
-You know, up around over there.
-ln Montauk?

841
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:34,509
-More like around--
-East Hampton.

842
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:37,013
Just all over the place. lt's one big blur.

843
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:39,049
One big, business blur.

844
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,177
l kind of want to
get away from all that business and...

845
00:59:42,253 --> 00:59:44,744
hang out with somebody
and have a real conversation.

846
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:47,655
So, l was wondering if you're not too busy...

847
00:59:47,725 --> 00:59:50,523
-maybe we can hang out?
-Yeah, sure.

848
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:54,492
-Really? All right. Cool!
-Yeah.

849
00:59:58,436 --> 01:00:00,836
So, l'll pick you up at about....

850
01:00:06,177 --> 01:00:09,613
You know,
the jet should be here about 7:30...

851
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,810
and the limo will take about a half-hour.
About 8:00. ls that good?

852
01:00:13,918 --> 01:00:17,820
-Yeah, 8:00 sounds great.
-8:00 sounds good? All right.

853
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:21,353
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

854
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,725
Hey, where's our $5?

855
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,795
All right, calm down.

856
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,868
Here you go. $5. $2.50 each.

857
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:37,133
-You promised to give us $5 each.
-Stay in school.

858
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:38,197
Cheapo.

859
01:00:38,609 --> 01:00:38,676
l am not making excuses.
l refuse to believe it.

860
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,236
l am not making excuses.
l refuse to believe it.

861
01:00:41,312 --> 01:00:44,110
-Really?
-l don't want to believe Marcus is cheating.

862
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,310
l don't wanna believe
Michael Jackson keeps carving up his nose.

863
01:00:47,385 --> 01:00:50,786
Excuse me. Your card has been declined
for insufficient funds.

864
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:52,753
The rep's on the line.

865
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,784
Yes, this is Mrs. Copeland.

866
01:00:57,461 --> 01:01:01,158
$4,000 dress?
And where did l buy this dress?

867
01:01:01,766 --> 01:01:03,233
The Hamptons!

868
01:01:04,402 --> 01:01:06,802
Yes, l remember.

869
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,370
Thank you.

870
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:14,506
lt is on.

871
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,042
l don't see why l got to go out
with Mandingo and his anaconda.

872
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:24,019
'Cause if you don't, you'll blow our cover.

873
01:01:24,088 --> 01:01:26,056
What you gonna be doing?

874
01:01:27,158 --> 01:01:30,855
Me? l'm going to follow up on a lead.

875
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,965
You're going on a date.

876
01:01:38,035 --> 01:01:39,696
She's a reporter.

877
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:43,829
Who else knows more
about the Hamptons people than her?

878
01:01:45,042 --> 01:01:48,808
All right, so l like the girl. You're the one
always telling me to settle down.

879
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:50,176
And you should.

880
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,411
But that don't mean
l got to go with Buffy the White Girl Slayer.

881
01:01:53,484 --> 01:01:56,385
All right. Look. Just go to dinner. Okay?

882
01:01:56,921 --> 01:02:00,357
l'm only gonna be a couple of hours
and l'll meet you back at the club.

883
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:01,721
-You promise?
-l promise?

884
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,316
l'm serious, dude. Promise.

885
01:02:03,394 --> 01:02:05,589
l do. l'm serious. All right.

886
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,495
Tell Latrell if he needs a condom...

887
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:12,127
there's an extra shower curtain
in the bathroom.

888
01:02:21,545 --> 01:02:22,739
Hop in.

889
01:02:24,882 --> 01:02:27,680
Take your time. Watch those marshmallows.

890
01:02:31,188 --> 01:02:33,053
Ease on in there, now.

891
01:02:34,091 --> 01:02:36,719
l won't bite unless you ask me to.

892
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:44,330
You are so beautiful.

893
01:02:49,674 --> 01:02:51,198
Good boy, Baby.

894
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,902
How about we listen to a little bit of music?

895
01:03:00,217 --> 01:03:01,616
What the....

896
01:03:03,954 --> 01:03:07,048
How did you know? l love this song!

897
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,060
<i>Making my way downtown</i>
<i>Walking fast</i>

898
01:03:11,128 --> 01:03:13,596
<i>Faces pass</i>
<i>And I'm home bound</i>

899
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,726
<i>And I need you</i>

900
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,228
<i>And I miss you</i>

901
01:03:22,373 --> 01:03:25,206
<i>And now I wonder</i>

902
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:30,272
<i>If I could fall</i>
<i>Into the sky</i>

903
01:03:30,614 --> 01:03:35,051
<i>Do you think time</i>
<i>Would pass me by</i>

904
01:03:35,553 --> 01:03:40,149
<i>'Cause you know I'd walk</i>
<i>A thousand miles</i>

905
01:03:40,224 --> 01:03:44,024
<i>If I could</i>
<i>Just see you</i>

906
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:46,629
<i>Tonight</i>

907
01:04:01,312 --> 01:04:04,179
-Good evening, madam. Welcome to Bella.
-Thank you.

908
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:05,974
What are you doing here?

909
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,314
l came to borrow the car
and the keys to his house.

910
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,253
Are you crazy? lf you crash this man's car,
he will kill you.

911
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:15,190
l won't crash it. Look. Just call me
before you leave. l'll bring it back.

912
01:04:15,259 --> 01:04:17,693
Then you meet me back at the club.

913
01:04:18,863 --> 01:04:21,593
No, my brother. You got to get your own.

914
01:04:26,837 --> 01:04:28,065
Help me.

915
01:04:34,512 --> 01:04:36,173
Thank you.

916
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:41,209
May l bring you something from the bar?

917
01:04:41,285 --> 01:04:44,186
Let me have
a bottle of your best champagne.

918
01:04:48,392 --> 01:04:51,293
-And bring us some oysters.
-Very good, sir.

919
01:04:51,629 --> 01:04:54,655
l have to say, l was so....

920
01:04:57,902 --> 01:05:00,427
l was happy
when l bought you at the auction.

921
01:05:00,504 --> 01:05:03,940
l mean, it's very rare
l have the opportunity to...

922
01:05:04,475 --> 01:05:08,343
bask in the ambience
of such a classy lady such as yourself.

923
01:05:09,747 --> 01:05:11,180
Oh, my God!

924
01:05:11,582 --> 01:05:15,040
-l am humbled by your...
-This athlete's foot is just killing me.

925
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,553
-...beautiful nature.
-That smell. That's infection.

926
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:21,352
-The most high-classness of your....
-My God. ls that a hangnail?

927
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,085
Captivated by your beauty.

928
01:05:25,529 --> 01:05:28,987
Your bountiful curves remind me
of the hills in ltaly.

929
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:36,332
l'm sorry. You were saying?

930
01:05:38,075 --> 01:05:41,169
-That's perfect. Thank you.
-Are you ready to order?

931
01:05:41,245 --> 01:05:45,272
Yes, l'll have the chicken. White meat only.

932
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:50,677
And for the lady, perhaps a salad?

933
01:05:51,889 --> 01:05:56,155
Perhaps not.
l'll have the steak, smothered in onions.

934
01:05:56,227 --> 01:05:59,321
A rack of ribs. Pasta with extra garlic.

935
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:04,265
French fries with lots of vinegar and a
side of onion rings with lots of sauerkraut.

936
01:06:10,207 --> 01:06:12,232
Have you ever had oysters?

937
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:15,378
Did you know oysters are an aphrodisiac?

938
01:06:22,419 --> 01:06:23,579
Sorry.

939
01:06:25,623 --> 01:06:27,591
My tongue's kind of big.

940
01:06:38,068 --> 01:06:40,229
lt'll open. Hold it!

941
01:06:40,304 --> 01:06:44,331
l'll push. Yeah. See, that did it there.

942
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,604
Just a little turn.

943
01:06:47,344 --> 01:06:49,539
There's so many keys involved...

944
01:06:49,613 --> 01:06:52,741
sometimes it's hard to figure out
what's what.

945
01:06:58,122 --> 01:07:00,022
lt's Mei Ling.

946
01:07:01,725 --> 01:07:04,091
What are you doing here? Girl, it's late!

947
01:07:04,161 --> 01:07:06,629
Come on, now. You have to go home.
Get some rest.

948
01:07:06,697 --> 01:07:10,189
You cannot stay. There are laws
against this kind of workmanship.

949
01:07:10,267 --> 01:07:12,701
They'll think
l'm running some kind of sweatshop.

950
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:16,501
That girl does not know when to go home.

951
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:21,011
l'm telling you, she will stay here
and just clean forever.

952
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:27,042
This is really nice.

953
01:07:27,651 --> 01:07:29,448
Yeah, this is dope.

954
01:07:30,888 --> 01:07:33,186
Dope summer home l picked, boy.

955
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:36,820
Who's that?

956
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:42,992
The big, buff, bald dude with the fur?

957
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:46,065
That's my trainer.

958
01:07:46,503 --> 01:07:48,061
You have your trainer on your wall?

959
01:07:48,138 --> 01:07:52,199
Yes, well, for inspiration.
l want to look like that one day and...

960
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:55,836
l come in every morning
and l look at the.... You ever see <i>Titanic?</i>

961
01:07:55,913 --> 01:07:59,906
-No, l haven't seen it.
-Me, either. You want something to drink?

962
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,983
-Yeah, sure. A glass of wine would be nice.
-Wine.

963
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:07,788
Okay, so l'll get you a glass of wine and....

964
01:08:08,592 --> 01:08:10,492
That'd be in the kitchen, right?

965
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:13,428
l don't know. This is your house, Latrell.

966
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:15,896
Who? Oh, me! Latrell.

967
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,068
That's right. l'm Latrell. That's right.

968
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,837
l'm going to get you
a bottle of my wine in my house.

969
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:27,141
<i>It's my house and I live here</i>

970
01:08:47,765 --> 01:08:49,426
Damn, little lady!

971
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:52,025
You sure can put it away.

972
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:56,764
You're so funny.

973
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:00,369
Voilà!

974
01:09:04,748 --> 01:09:06,272
You have a dog.

975
01:09:06,617 --> 01:09:08,812
No, l don't have no damn dog.

976
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,782
Well, then whose dog is that?

977
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,787
Shit.

978
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,561
That's not no dog.

979
01:09:25,135 --> 01:09:26,625
That's family.

980
01:09:28,639 --> 01:09:30,106
Hey, cousin.

981
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:36,603
Come here, boy.

982
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:44,053
He looks really mad! Are you okay?

983
01:09:44,121 --> 01:09:47,386
Yeah, l'm fine. He just misses me, that's all.

984
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:50,822
Okay, boy, playtime's over. Let me up!

985
01:09:52,463 --> 01:09:55,864
-You want me to go for help?
-No, we're just having fun.

986
01:09:55,933 --> 01:09:58,026
You sure are playful today.

987
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,869
You want to go for a walk, boy?

988
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,970
l'll be right back!

989
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,545
You know what?
Forget this! l'm out of here!

990
01:10:09,613 --> 01:10:13,572
l don't want to go on a date with a guy
and his dog is biting him and....

991
01:10:20,657 --> 01:10:23,057
What's he doing now? What's that?

992
01:10:24,194 --> 01:10:25,786
Don't pay him no mind.

993
01:10:25,863 --> 01:10:29,026
He's just going to do that
until he falls asleep.

994
01:10:31,502 --> 01:10:34,300
Now, where were we? Wine!

995
01:10:45,415 --> 01:10:49,579
You know,
l like a woman with a little extra something.

996
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:54,452
A little cushion for the pushing.

997
01:10:55,392 --> 01:10:58,259
l'd really love for you
to come to one of my games.

998
01:10:58,328 --> 01:11:01,957
No, thank you. l've seen you play.
Not impressed.

999
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:05,760
Excuse me? l'm the highest scoring forward
in the league!

1000
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:11,471
But all that talent? Totally overshadowed by
nothing but scandals and pure laziness.

1001
01:11:11,542 --> 01:11:15,501
Come on! You're shooting under 50%
from the free throw line, okay?

1002
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:17,342
Your turnover ratio, abysmal.

1003
01:11:17,414 --> 01:11:21,680
And on top of that, you can't shoot
three-pointers to save your life. So...

1004
01:11:21,752 --> 01:11:23,117
squeeze me.

1005
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,689
No one's ever cared like that before.

1006
01:11:36,533 --> 01:11:38,125
Come here, baby!

1007
01:11:44,908 --> 01:11:46,500
Oopsie! l had a poopsie.

1008
01:11:47,878 --> 01:11:51,211
Girl, we're going to get along just fine.

1009
01:11:52,049 --> 01:11:53,448
Back at you!

1010
01:11:56,787 --> 01:11:59,722
-Bask in the ambience!
-l'm going to be sick.

1011
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:05,194
So, no. l jump over the fence, fall.
l scrape my knee.

1012
01:12:05,262 --> 01:12:07,492
-Get out of here.
-No, seriously, listen.

1013
01:12:07,564 --> 01:12:11,967
l scrape my knee. l get chased by the cops
and l spend the night in jail.

1014
01:12:12,035 --> 01:12:15,300
That's insane. You did all that
just to find J-Lo and Ben's hideaway?

1015
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:19,433
l can't help it. You know,
investigative journalism is my passion.

1016
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:23,340
So how'd you end up
writing puff pieces for the local news?

1017
01:12:24,648 --> 01:12:27,242
Unfortunately, l made some enemies...

1018
01:12:27,751 --> 01:12:30,276
and ended up getting fired from my last job.

1019
01:12:30,354 --> 01:12:31,378
What happened?

1020
01:12:31,455 --> 01:12:33,548
Believe me,
you don't want to know about that.

1021
01:12:33,624 --> 01:12:36,616
Look, l spent all night talking about myself.

1022
01:12:37,094 --> 01:12:40,723
Sometimes it's good for a man
to just sit back and listen.

1023
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:44,231
Well, since you put it that way.

1024
01:12:47,504 --> 01:12:50,132
l did this piece on Warren Vandergeld.

1025
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:53,441
Him and his partners tried to swindle a guy.

1026
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:55,705
You talking about Ted Burton?

1027
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:58,009
Yeah, how did you know that?

1028
01:12:58,081 --> 01:13:00,675
lt was in the paper. l read about it.

1029
01:13:01,785 --> 01:13:03,776
But what they didn't report in the paper...

1030
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:06,880
was that Burton was 10 times smarter
than all of them.

1031
01:13:06,957 --> 01:13:10,688
He embezzled millions
and stashed it in an offshore account.

1032
01:13:13,163 --> 01:13:15,563
When Vandergeld heard the story
was going to break...

1033
01:13:15,632 --> 01:13:17,725
he didn't want to be embarrassed.

1034
01:13:17,801 --> 01:13:19,769
Well, there goes my job.

1035
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,930
You know, you're a good listener.

1036
01:13:24,007 --> 01:13:27,101
lt seems like you have the whole package.

1037
01:13:44,861 --> 01:13:45,919
Man!

1038
01:13:49,499 --> 01:13:51,592
-Hello?
-Kev, you got to go.

1039
01:13:51,668 --> 01:13:54,694
-What? Now?
-Yeah, now. We're on our way.

1040
01:13:55,706 --> 01:13:57,731
Can't you stall him for a little while?

1041
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:01,300
Look, this man sang to me.
He tried to kiss me and on top of that...

1042
01:14:01,378 --> 01:14:03,437
he been farting for the last 20 minutes.

1043
01:14:03,513 --> 01:14:06,346
All right, l'll be there in a minute. Bye.

1044
01:14:07,217 --> 01:14:10,311
-Cottontail!
-l'm coming, nigger!

1045
01:14:13,757 --> 01:14:15,918
Gomez, what the hell are we looking for?

1046
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:19,622
l don't know. Something just isn't right
about these girls.

1047
01:14:19,696 --> 01:14:21,891
l'm gonna check the bathroom.

1048
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:34,166
Find anything?

1049
01:14:35,312 --> 01:14:37,746
No. Not yet.

1050
01:14:50,927 --> 01:14:54,863
You won't believe what l....
What the hell are you doing?

1051
01:14:58,402 --> 01:15:02,168
Sniffing chicks' underwear, man.
What is the big....

1052
01:15:02,472 --> 01:15:03,962
lt's.... What?

1053
01:15:09,813 --> 01:15:11,542
They're guys, aren't they?

1054
01:15:12,482 --> 01:15:14,507
You really are disgusting.

1055
01:15:28,465 --> 01:15:31,491
-Can l buy you a drink?
-Buzz off, Smallville.

1056
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:33,565
Oh, my God. l so don't get it.

1057
01:15:33,637 --> 01:15:36,936
Guys think if they buy you a drink,
it's a free ticket into your pants.

1058
01:15:37,007 --> 01:15:38,531
Well, it's not.

1059
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:41,199
-What can l get you?
-l'll have a Panty Dropper.

1060
01:15:41,278 --> 01:15:44,247
-Screaming Orgasm.
-A Slow Comfortable Screw.

1061
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:48,845
A Blue Balls on the rocks.

1062
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:52,650
-l've had that before. That's a good drink.
-Don't drink too many.

1063
01:15:53,557 --> 01:15:55,548
-Yo, Latrell.
-What's up?

1064
01:15:57,327 --> 01:15:58,954
Excuse me, baby.

1065
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:04,931
-Latrell, my man! What's going on, brother?
-What's up, man?

1066
01:16:05,702 --> 01:16:08,603
-Two apple martinis.
-You hitting that, bro?

1067
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:11,867
-This is a tough one to crack.
-Tiffany Wilson?

1068
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,466
The ex queen?

1069
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:17,036
Here. Drop a couple of these babies
in her drink, man.

1070
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,911
Are you sure this will work?

1071
01:16:18,982 --> 01:16:21,610
Man, l just took two of them,
and l'm telling you...

1072
01:16:21,685 --> 01:16:24,381
l'm boinking someone tonight, you know?

1073
01:16:25,355 --> 01:16:26,686
Excuse me.

1074
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:36,026
That's for you, my little Miracle Whip.

1075
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,528
You need to loosen up. There you go.

1076
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:42,433
That's for you.

1077
01:16:42,506 --> 01:16:44,838
-Oh, my God! ls that Britney Spears?
-Where?

1078
01:16:44,908 --> 01:16:48,400
Right over there. Forget it, she just left.

1079
01:16:49,946 --> 01:16:51,971
Oops, she did it again.

1080
01:16:56,887 --> 01:16:59,082
-Let's drink up.
-Let's do it.

1081
01:16:59,956 --> 01:17:01,583
To the last drop.

1082
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:10,729
That's good. You want to dance?

1083
01:17:10,934 --> 01:17:14,893
You know, that's a great idea.
Here, hold Baby. Let's go, girls.

1084
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:28,951
l found out some interesting information.
Ted Burton turned the tables on Vandergeld.

1085
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,714
Tucked away $100 million.

1086
01:17:30,787 --> 01:17:33,620
Been living the high life
ever since he got out of prison.

1087
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,555
There goes our motive.

1088
01:17:45,335 --> 01:17:47,769
Those skanks think they're hot?

1089
01:17:49,806 --> 01:17:52,331
Let's show them what sexy really is.

1090
01:18:18,368 --> 01:18:21,201
They want to battle. Let's go, girls.

1091
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,913
You girls want some of this?

1092
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:41,184
Bring it on, sisters!

1093
01:18:41,324 --> 01:18:43,383
Okay, let's do it!

1094
01:18:44,227 --> 01:18:46,593
Five, six, seven, eight.

1095
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,088
Come on.

1096
01:19:55,398 --> 01:19:57,093
Hold on.

1097
01:19:57,534 --> 01:20:00,935
l know you hookers
don't think this is over with.

1098
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:03,962
Let's kick it old school.

1099
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:29,529
They suck!

1100
01:21:02,532 --> 01:21:04,056
Oh, my God!

1101
01:21:13,476 --> 01:21:14,773
We won!

1102
01:21:25,655 --> 01:21:27,316
Come on, let's go.

1103
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:30,851
Get out of my way! Move it!

1104
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:34,119
l need a drink.

1105
01:21:39,903 --> 01:21:42,701
Hey, Latrell, my man.

1106
01:21:44,474 --> 01:21:46,305
So did it work, man?

1107
01:21:48,011 --> 01:21:49,501
l don't know.

1108
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:52,342
But l got to dance.

1109
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:54,777
l got to hit this.

1110
01:21:57,487 --> 01:21:58,954
Hold the dog.

1111
01:22:04,494 --> 01:22:05,859
Let it out.

1112
01:22:06,262 --> 01:22:08,196
Oh, yeah. Now it's out.

1113
01:22:09,365 --> 01:22:11,993
l paid thousands of dollars on this outfit...

1114
01:22:12,068 --> 01:22:14,502
and do you think he even noticed?

1115
01:22:14,571 --> 01:22:15,731
lt's going to be okay.

1116
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,137
Little Miss Vandergeld walks in...

1117
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:21,268
and he just forgets all about me.

1118
01:22:22,846 --> 01:22:25,110
Okay, let it out.

1119
01:22:26,783 --> 01:22:28,148
l wonder...

1120
01:22:29,752 --> 01:22:32,243
if he would think she was so hot...

1121
01:22:32,755 --> 01:22:37,055
if he knew that she is broke.

1122
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,890
Vandergeld's broke?

1123
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:45,733
We mustn't talk of such things.

1124
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:47,302
No, we won't.

1125
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:50,871
But, yes, they're broke.

1126
01:22:53,076 --> 01:22:57,536
My father even had to
loan her father money...

1127
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,478
just so that they could keep their house.

1128
01:23:00,617 --> 01:23:03,211
They just paid us back.

1129
01:23:04,587 --> 01:23:07,818
-You guys, l love you guys.
-We love you, too.

1130
01:23:07,891 --> 01:23:09,620
l love you so much!

1131
01:23:10,994 --> 01:23:12,325
Thank you.

1132
01:23:12,395 --> 01:23:15,193
Can we get you some gum
or a mint or something?

1133
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:17,826
Hey, little girl.

1134
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,466
Really? l love you, too.

1135
01:23:29,445 --> 01:23:32,243
What the hell are you doing? Give me her!

1136
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:36,318
Sicko. Where's Latrell?

1137
01:23:37,086 --> 01:23:38,485
Dance floor.

1138
01:24:29,138 --> 01:24:31,106
Good morning, snowflake.

1139
01:24:39,315 --> 01:24:40,782
Oh, my God. Brittany!

1140
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:44,249
-What?
-We're on page six.

1141
01:24:44,487 --> 01:24:46,284
-No.
-Yeah.

1142
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:50,284
Look. ''Wilson sisters rock Hamptons.''

1143
01:24:53,763 --> 01:24:56,527
-Wilsons rock!
-We rocked!

1144
01:24:58,601 --> 01:25:02,594
Wait. We weren't in the Hamptons
this weekend.

1145
01:25:03,773 --> 01:25:08,039
No! We've been cloned!

1146
01:25:12,615 --> 01:25:15,209
He's got to be around here somewhere.

1147
01:25:15,351 --> 01:25:18,616
Girl, wait a minute.
lsn't that Marcus right there?

1148
01:25:19,255 --> 01:25:22,986
-That's him, all right. Old lying dog!
-Caught you.

1149
01:25:25,628 --> 01:25:27,528
That sounds like Gina.

1150
01:25:28,564 --> 01:25:30,794
-Don't answer it. She'll go away.
-No, she won't.

1151
01:25:30,867 --> 01:25:33,859
l'm not going anywhere
until you open this door!

1152
01:25:33,936 --> 01:25:37,531
-l told you! What am l going to do?
-Just get rid of her.

1153
01:25:38,141 --> 01:25:40,871
l'll get rid of her. You hide the stuff.

1154
01:25:43,046 --> 01:25:46,709
-l'm not playing with you!
-Coming, baby!

1155
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:48,950
What is all that noise?

1156
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:51,483
Nothing! Okay, baby, l'm coming!

1157
01:25:56,092 --> 01:25:58,219
l'm coming. Hide.

1158
01:26:01,964 --> 01:26:05,195
Hey, baby! Hi, boo-boo.

1159
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:13,238
-Nice room you got, Marcus.
-Hey, baby, what you doing here?

1160
01:26:13,309 --> 01:26:15,675
-l could ask you the same question.
-Me?

1161
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:18,040
l'm on assignment.

1162
01:26:18,748 --> 01:26:20,739
Are you wearing lipstick?

1163
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:24,146
No. That's Kool-Aid. You want some?

1164
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:27,656
You know, it's filled with lots of
vitamin C and riboflavin.

1165
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:29,214
ls that a bra?

1166
01:26:30,126 --> 01:26:31,388
No, this?

1167
01:26:31,761 --> 01:26:35,629
This is the new holsters
they gave us at work.

1168
01:26:35,698 --> 01:26:39,190
They're government issue.
You can put two guns in there and just....

1169
01:26:39,268 --> 01:26:40,758
''Freeze, FBl!''

1170
01:26:41,437 --> 01:26:44,406
-l know somebody's in here.
-Baby, nobody's in here.

1171
01:26:44,474 --> 01:26:47,341
See? Nobody's in here.

1172
01:26:48,644 --> 01:26:51,613
-Check under the bed--
-What do you mean, ''Check under the bed''?

1173
01:26:51,681 --> 01:26:54,844
-l heard somebody on the phone.
-Check under the bed!

1174
01:26:54,917 --> 01:26:58,216
-That's where everybody hides! Check it!
-Marcus! Nobody can fit!

1175
01:26:58,287 --> 01:27:00,414
See, nobody here, right? Nobody there.

1176
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:04,085
-l'll look in the bathroom.
-Wait! No! Don't check the bathroom!

1177
01:27:06,028 --> 01:27:08,428
You don't want me to check the bathroom!

1178
01:27:10,933 --> 01:27:14,369
See? Nothing in the bathroom.
Nobody in the room. See?

1179
01:27:14,737 --> 01:27:17,069
l told you no one was here. See?

1180
01:27:18,574 --> 01:27:20,735
You know, baby, this gotta stop!

1181
01:27:20,843 --> 01:27:23,744
-We can't have love if we don't have trust.
-l know, but look.

1182
01:27:23,813 --> 01:27:26,441
l was at the restaurant and the card
wouldn't go through--

1183
01:27:26,516 --> 01:27:30,543
Listen. lf we don't have trust,
we don't have nothing.

1184
01:27:30,987 --> 01:27:33,387
This is not about trust. This is about--

1185
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:37,983
There she is, right there!

1186
01:27:43,032 --> 01:27:45,227
Now, baby. l can explain.

1187
01:27:46,102 --> 01:27:48,400
-l knew it.
-Baby, it's not what you think.

1188
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:51,872
-Baby, it's not what you think.
-Don't you even say nothing to me!

1189
01:27:52,375 --> 01:27:55,367
l can explain. Baby, it's not what you think.

1190
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,011
He's a man!

1191
01:27:58,347 --> 01:27:59,746
You're sick!

1192
01:28:07,123 --> 01:28:09,853
There's a lot of lovely ladies
here today, boys.

1193
01:28:09,992 --> 01:28:11,357
Hey, Russ.

1194
01:28:14,764 --> 01:28:16,595
What happened to you?

1195
01:28:24,307 --> 01:28:25,501
l fell.

1196
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:37,511
We have to find them and stop them
before they execute their evil plan.

1197
01:28:37,587 --> 01:28:40,078
-Wait, what do they look like?
-Duh, us!

1198
01:28:40,156 --> 01:28:42,249
Afternoon, ladies.

1199
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:44,588
The Chief would like
to have a word with you.

1200
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:47,561
My God, Tiffany. They're the Men in Black.

1201
01:28:48,264 --> 01:28:49,288
Come on.

1202
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:52,827
-Easy, Ponch and Jon. My hair!
-Let's move it along, pal.

1203
01:28:52,902 --> 01:28:54,494
-Wait a minute!
-Let's go!

1204
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:59,064
Chief, we just got confirmation
that Burton's arrived at JFK.

1205
01:28:59,275 --> 01:29:03,177
l want him trailed. Give him plenty of room.
l don't want anyone jumping the gun.

1206
01:29:03,246 --> 01:29:05,373
l want to get this guy red-handed.

1207
01:29:05,681 --> 01:29:08,172
-Get your hands off of me!
-Let's go.

1208
01:29:08,684 --> 01:29:10,811
-Hey, easy!
-Right this way, girls.

1209
01:29:12,255 --> 01:29:14,917
What the hell you guys doing
with the Wilson sisters?

1210
01:29:14,991 --> 01:29:18,859
-Chief, these aren't the Wilson sisters.
-No, sir.

1211
01:29:19,695 --> 01:29:21,856
Chief, check this out.

1212
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:25,894
My God! What are you doing?

1213
01:29:25,968 --> 01:29:28,596
-That's on there pretty good.
-Let her go.

1214
01:29:28,671 --> 01:29:30,571
That's nothing, Chief.

1215
01:29:32,341 --> 01:29:33,808
How about....

1216
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,581
-Those are nice.
-That's enough!

1217
01:29:41,717 --> 01:29:44,242
l don't know how he did that...

1218
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:46,747
but you can't fake these.

1219
01:30:01,003 --> 01:30:05,235
My God! Look who's here.
lt's that beautiful--

1220
01:30:05,308 --> 01:30:06,536
Save it!

1221
01:30:08,477 --> 01:30:11,469
Because of you, l had to suspend
two of my best agents!

1222
01:30:11,547 --> 01:30:14,641
-Chief, l can explain.
-l don't want to hear it!

1223
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:17,514
You're just lucky we caught Burton
before he could strike.

1224
01:30:17,586 --> 01:30:19,747
But Burton is not our guy!

1225
01:30:20,056 --> 01:30:22,388
Let me guess: Women's intuition?

1226
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:24,418
You're both fired.

1227
01:30:24,493 --> 01:30:27,155
Turn in your guns and your badges.
This operation is over!

1228
01:30:27,229 --> 01:30:30,323
-Come on, Chief! You can't fire us.
-l just did.

1229
01:30:34,103 --> 01:30:36,571
Forget him, Marcus. We can do this ourself.

1230
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,130
-Look, all we got to do is--
-Wait.

1231
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:42,366
''We''? Kevin, this ain't about ''we.''

1232
01:30:42,912 --> 01:30:45,107
lt's never been. lt's about you.

1233
01:30:45,181 --> 01:30:48,673
You come up with some stupid idea
and l'm dumb enough to go along with it.

1234
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:50,582
And look where it's gotten me, Kevin.

1235
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:53,645
l just lost my wife and my job
because of you.

1236
01:30:53,723 --> 01:30:56,783
So don't tell me about ''we'' no more,
all right?

1237
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:01,623
They bought it. The FBl is packing up.

1238
01:31:02,131 --> 01:31:05,100
They'll be out of our hair in a couple hours.

1239
01:31:05,167 --> 01:31:07,465
We could make the grab tonight.

1240
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:10,767
You sure you and your friend
can get the job done?

1241
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:15,469
Would l let you down, Mr. V?

1242
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:24,409
-Hey, man. l just want to say sorry.
-Forget about it, dude.

1243
01:31:24,487 --> 01:31:28,753
No. You're right. You're absolutely right.
l've been selfish.

1244
01:31:28,824 --> 01:31:33,659
l'm always dragging you into everything.
l never even asked what you want to do.

1245
01:31:34,063 --> 01:31:37,658
l don't know, there's something about
always having you around, that just...

1246
01:31:37,733 --> 01:31:40,133
makes me want to step up my game.

1247
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:44,169
l guess it's because l always know
you're gonna have my back.

1248
01:31:47,676 --> 01:31:48,836
Hello?

1249
01:31:50,513 --> 01:31:51,707
Thanks.

1250
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:56,317
-Who was that?
-That was Josh.

1251
01:31:56,385 --> 01:32:00,344
Turns out that Vandergeld's prints
was all over the ransom note.

1252
01:32:01,457 --> 01:32:03,357
-What are you doing?
-Calling the Chief.

1253
01:32:03,426 --> 01:32:06,623
No, you ain't! You said we could do this
on our own, right?

1254
01:32:06,695 --> 01:32:08,162
What about backup?

1255
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:11,222
l got you, you got me.
That's all the backup we need.

1256
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,427
Triple T-K-A.

1257
01:32:13,803 --> 01:32:17,000
Time to totally kick ass!

1258
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:29,081
Three generations at the Bureau
and l'm the first to get fired.

1259
01:32:29,785 --> 01:32:31,878
My dad is going to kill me!

1260
01:32:33,022 --> 01:32:34,853
Yeah? What? Who?

1261
01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:40,351
-Copeland!
-Copeland, you dick!

1262
01:32:40,896 --> 01:32:43,387
You've got a lot of nerve, calling.

1263
01:32:43,499 --> 01:32:44,659
Where?

1264
01:32:46,869 --> 01:32:49,929
-You better not be wrong about this.
-What?

1265
01:32:50,005 --> 01:32:53,168
-We might be getting our jobs back.
-What are you talking about?

1266
01:32:53,242 --> 01:32:56,040
-We gotta go.
-What do you mean, go?

1267
01:32:56,378 --> 01:32:59,176
How about this?
RuPaul or Whoopi Goldberg?

1268
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:02,907
-l told you, l'm not playing your games.
-Come on!

1269
01:33:20,903 --> 01:33:23,428
-Any sign of Vandergeld?
-l don't see him.

1270
01:33:23,506 --> 01:33:25,565
All right, keep an eye out for him.

1271
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:27,836
lf it's going down,
it's going to go down here.

1272
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:30,470
Thank God! There you are! l did it.

1273
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:34,237
-You did what?
-l got you into the fashion show!

1274
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:39,580
Brittany, did you hear that?
We're in the fashion show.

1275
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:42,617
Not if we don't get moving.
Come on, let's go!

1276
01:33:42,691 --> 01:33:46,752
-Get the lead out, ladies.
-l mean, it's like you forgot.

1277
01:33:49,532 --> 01:33:52,023
-You mean the Wilson sisters are in?
-And we're out?

1278
01:33:52,101 --> 01:33:56,401
l'm sorry. That's just the way it is.
They're hot, you're not! So deal with it.

1279
01:33:56,472 --> 01:33:59,339
-You! Straighten up that blouse, now!
-That's impossible!

1280
01:33:59,408 --> 01:34:03,310
We've been on that catwalk every summer
for six years straight!

1281
01:34:03,712 --> 01:34:05,839
Let's just cut to the chase.

1282
01:34:06,248 --> 01:34:10,309
Who do we have to sleep with
for us to get in the show?

1283
01:34:10,686 --> 01:34:13,951
Honey, you're so
barking up the wrong tree right now. Really!

1284
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,958
lf you nail this, you're a shoo-in
for the cover of <i>Hamptons.</i>

1285
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:19,460
Darlings! Where have you been?

1286
01:34:20,429 --> 01:34:21,896
Megan! Don't!

1287
01:34:22,565 --> 01:34:24,362
This is unacceptable.

1288
01:34:25,067 --> 01:34:27,695
They just messed with the wrong girls!

1289
01:34:28,671 --> 01:34:30,662
l've been looking everywhere for you.

1290
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:34,698
Can we get the Wilson sisters
their outfits now, please? Go.

1291
01:34:39,648 --> 01:34:42,242
-Can we talk?
-Of course.

1292
01:34:43,385 --> 01:34:45,717
You were incredible at the nightclub
last night.

1293
01:34:45,788 --> 01:34:47,949
-Thank you. Thanks.
-lncredible.

1294
01:34:48,023 --> 01:34:51,720
And Heather will be leaving after the party
tonight, and l was thinking...

1295
01:34:51,794 --> 01:34:54,854
maybe you could come by around 2:00?

1296
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,794
Make that 3:00 a.m.

1297
01:35:06,108 --> 01:35:07,598
You know what?

1298
01:35:08,844 --> 01:35:10,471
l don't think so.

1299
01:35:10,646 --> 01:35:11,977
Excuse me?

1300
01:35:12,348 --> 01:35:14,680
You think l'm just a booty call.

1301
01:35:15,384 --> 01:35:16,874
Well, l'm not.

1302
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:20,513
l deserve better than that.

1303
01:35:21,657 --> 01:35:23,989
l'm tired of being your doormat.

1304
01:35:29,398 --> 01:35:30,626
Honey...

1305
01:35:31,967 --> 01:35:34,765
what makes you think you're that special?

1306
01:35:38,073 --> 01:35:40,200
-Bastard.
-Excuse me.

1307
01:35:41,243 --> 01:35:42,471
Asswipe!

1308
01:35:49,852 --> 01:35:52,787
-You're going to regret that.
-l'm so scared.

1309
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:56,015
Oh, my God! Tiffany!

1310
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:01,295
-Thank you so much, honey.
-l am so proud of you.

1311
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:04,593
Thanks. l just wish l didn't feel so crappy.

1312
01:36:05,434 --> 01:36:06,628
Honey.

1313
01:36:07,369 --> 01:36:10,668
Sometimes a man can't see
when he has someone so special...

1314
01:36:10,739 --> 01:36:12,969
sitting right in front of him.

1315
01:36:13,642 --> 01:36:16,133
Are you, like, a lesbian?

1316
01:36:19,882 --> 01:36:22,214
-l better go get changed.
-Okay.

1317
01:36:23,452 --> 01:36:26,580
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this evening we are proud to present...</i>

1318
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:30,853
<i>the fall couture line, Aubrey Allure.</i>
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

1319
01:36:32,528 --> 01:36:34,428
-Excuse me?
-You're not on the list.

1320
01:36:34,496 --> 01:36:37,659
lnvitation, my ass!
They don't know how we do it.

1321
01:36:38,634 --> 01:36:40,829
-Let's just blend.
-All right.

1322
01:36:59,621 --> 01:37:01,748
Go! Get going! Move it!

1323
01:37:08,597 --> 01:37:11,225
Didn't we just have this conversation?

1324
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,735
Can we get these fantastic supermodels...

1325
01:37:14,803 --> 01:37:17,772
-back into their dressing rooms?
-l can't believe it!

1326
01:37:52,441 --> 01:37:54,875
-They changed that quick!
-Amazing!

1327
01:38:04,153 --> 01:38:06,986
These ought to get the critics' attention.

1328
01:38:40,556 --> 01:38:43,616
Second changes, everybody! Go! Now!

1329
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:46,924
This'll be a nice little treat.

1330
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,649
My God! What's happening?

1331
01:39:15,224 --> 01:39:16,816
That's not mine!

1332
01:39:17,693 --> 01:39:19,285
Let's get out of here!

1333
01:39:19,561 --> 01:39:20,823
l'm sorry!

1334
01:39:26,902 --> 01:39:29,530
Just give me your hand. lt'll be okay.

1335
01:39:32,841 --> 01:39:34,832
l'm so sorry. Oh!

1336
01:39:35,878 --> 01:39:37,675
Come here! l got you!

1337
01:39:40,148 --> 01:39:41,672
Here we go. Up!

1338
01:39:44,553 --> 01:39:46,282
-My God!
-l hope she's okay.

1339
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:47,720
l'm ruined.

1340
01:39:52,594 --> 01:39:56,758
Looks like some people just don't know
when to quit. Come on, girls.

1341
01:39:58,333 --> 01:40:00,426
-Help me.
-l got you.

1342
01:40:05,207 --> 01:40:07,368
Karen, what are you doing?

1343
01:40:07,442 --> 01:40:11,378
Look, someone has got to give those girls
a taste of their own medicine.

1344
01:40:31,934 --> 01:40:35,961
So revolutionary! lt's so bold and so....

1345
01:40:36,905 --> 01:40:38,372
So brilliant!

1346
01:41:03,532 --> 01:41:05,966
Everybody, they're imposters!

1347
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:11,963
Hit the lights.

1348
01:41:36,732 --> 01:41:38,359
Where's Brittany?

1349
01:41:43,271 --> 01:41:44,761
Where are you?

1350
01:42:01,123 --> 01:42:02,385
Get down!

1351
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:11,626
l told you you were going to regret it.

1352
01:42:11,767 --> 01:42:14,861
You hit like a bitch! Come on.

1353
01:42:16,371 --> 01:42:19,169
You run and l'll shoot you. Come on.

1354
01:42:32,587 --> 01:42:34,748
-My turn.
-Mama?

1355
01:42:37,426 --> 01:42:39,587
Girl, we going to need some backup.

1356
01:42:41,396 --> 01:42:42,886
Girl, call NayNay and LaQuanda.

1357
01:42:42,964 --> 01:42:45,489
Tell them to bring the Vaseline
and the straight razors.

1358
01:42:45,567 --> 01:42:47,159
These bitches are on some other shit!

1359
01:42:47,235 --> 01:42:48,827
What's going on?

1360
01:42:49,237 --> 01:42:52,104
-Don't touch my dress!
-Vandergeld's got Tiffany!

1361
01:42:52,174 --> 01:42:55,610
What? No one messes with my queen!

1362
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,541
Marcus! Are you okay?

1363
01:42:58,113 --> 01:42:59,842
-No.
-What's wrong?

1364
01:43:00,449 --> 01:43:02,974
These damn G-strings are killing me!

1365
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:08,648
-Freeze!
-FBl.

1366
01:43:10,392 --> 01:43:13,190
You guys take care of them.
We're going after Vandergeld.

1367
01:43:13,261 --> 01:43:15,786
Copeland! You're going to need this.

1368
01:43:17,332 --> 01:43:18,993
Come on, let's go.

1369
01:43:21,069 --> 01:43:22,661
FBl! Freeze!

1370
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:27,201
Daddy, what are you doing?

1371
01:43:27,275 --> 01:43:30,540
Why don't you take your mother
and your sister and go on home?

1372
01:43:30,612 --> 01:43:32,842
Daddy, why are you doing this?

1373
01:43:32,914 --> 01:43:35,405
Daddy didn't tell you? He's broke.

1374
01:43:35,484 --> 01:43:37,315
What do you mean, broke?

1375
01:43:37,385 --> 01:43:40,320
Like Martha Stewart broke
or MC Hammer broke?

1376
01:43:40,655 --> 01:43:43,419
-MC Hammer broke!
-No!

1377
01:43:43,825 --> 01:43:48,626
l've been funneling money out of the charity
into a private account, just to get us by!

1378
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:53,301
Are you filming this?

1379
01:43:54,569 --> 01:43:56,969
l'll give you something to shoot!

1380
01:43:58,874 --> 01:44:01,399
-Get out of my way!
-l can't do that.

1381
01:44:06,148 --> 01:44:07,376
Drop it!

1382
01:44:12,053 --> 01:44:15,079
l got you, man. Man, we'll get that stain out.
Don't even worry.

1383
01:44:15,157 --> 01:44:16,522
Don't move!

1384
01:44:17,092 --> 01:44:19,822
Warren Vandergeld, you are under arrest!

1385
01:44:21,997 --> 01:44:26,263
l just want to tell you, l appreciate
what you did. That was real brave of you.

1386
01:44:26,334 --> 01:44:31,271
l had no choice. l couldn't let them take
my one true love away.

1387
01:44:33,208 --> 01:44:36,336
Hey, dude. l'm not what you think l am.

1388
01:44:38,046 --> 01:44:41,675
Baby, we all got secrets. That's okay.

1389
01:44:48,156 --> 01:44:52,820
Are you telling me that you are not....

1390
01:44:52,928 --> 01:44:55,158
-Yeah. l'm not a woman.
-White?

1391
01:44:55,964 --> 01:44:59,695
The deception! The betrayal, man!
You deceived me!

1392
01:44:59,768 --> 01:45:02,259
Calm down. l'm an FBl agent.
l was uncovering a--

1393
01:45:02,337 --> 01:45:03,827
Negro, please!

1394
01:45:04,706 --> 01:45:07,800
Didn't somebody tell you
this was an all-white party?

1395
01:45:07,876 --> 01:45:10,504
Someone get this jigaboo away from me!

1396
01:45:10,745 --> 01:45:12,212
Are you okay?

1397
01:45:12,547 --> 01:45:14,742
Yes, l'm fine. Thank you.

1398
01:45:15,116 --> 01:45:18,176
So, do l get to see my knight
in shining armor?

1399
01:45:18,553 --> 01:45:20,316
-Well....
-Get a leg!

1400
01:45:21,790 --> 01:45:23,155
Get off me!

1401
01:45:23,325 --> 01:45:25,589
What do you mean?
l'm going to let you have it!

1402
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:27,821
-You ain't never met nobody like me!
-lt's me!

1403
01:45:27,896 --> 01:45:30,888
You don't know who you messing with!
My name's Gina!

1404
01:45:30,966 --> 01:45:32,194
lt's me.

1405
01:45:39,774 --> 01:45:42,265
This is some Jerry Springer shit!

1406
01:45:44,679 --> 01:45:49,378
Once again, you guys managed to do
everything l told you not to do.

1407
01:45:50,085 --> 01:45:53,486
You caused over $250,000 worth of damage.

1408
01:45:53,755 --> 01:45:55,552
Two people were shot.

1409
01:45:57,125 --> 01:46:00,925
But at least you got the right guy.

1410
01:46:01,296 --> 01:46:03,662
-Good work.
-Thanks a lot, Chief.

1411
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:06,257
But we couldn't have done it
without Gomez and Harper.

1412
01:46:06,334 --> 01:46:09,633
All right,
l'll see you all in the office tomorrow.

1413
01:46:10,772 --> 01:46:12,364
Good work, guys.

1414
01:46:13,842 --> 01:46:16,811
Who will be featured
on the cover of <i>Hamptons Magazine?</i>

1415
01:46:16,878 --> 01:46:19,472
l have to take care of some business.

1416
01:46:19,681 --> 01:46:21,546
See you guys on Monday.

1417
01:46:21,616 --> 01:46:24,983
So, who do you think wore those panties
you were sniffing?

1418
01:46:25,053 --> 01:46:26,645
Kevin or Marcus?

1419
01:46:26,888 --> 01:46:30,380
-Gomez, l told you. l was looking for DNA.
-Oh, yeah.

1420
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:34,327
What are you laughing at, ''Denzel''?

1421
01:46:34,396 --> 01:46:36,990
''Oh, what a beautiful chocolate man!''

1422
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:40,492
You guys got some work to do?

1423
01:46:40,568 --> 01:46:42,798
l'm Denise Porter. Good night.

1424
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:52,341
l'm Kevin Copeland. l'm an FBl agent.

1425
01:46:53,448 --> 01:46:55,939
l make $30,000 a year after taxes.

1426
01:46:56,785 --> 01:47:00,482
l don't drive a Bentley
and l don't have a house on a hill.

1427
01:47:00,989 --> 01:47:03,549
But l'd really like to take you out.

1428
01:47:04,626 --> 01:47:07,754
Are you kidding me? Any man...

1429
01:47:09,931 --> 01:47:12,923
who would jump in front of a bullet for me...

1430
01:47:13,835 --> 01:47:16,235
can definitely take me on a date.

1431
01:47:21,576 --> 01:47:24,044
-Come on, girl, let's go.
-Wait, could l just please--

1432
01:47:24,112 --> 01:47:28,139
-l have nothing more to say to you.
-l know. Just listen to me, please.

1433
01:47:28,249 --> 01:47:30,114
Gina, l lied to you.

1434
01:47:30,919 --> 01:47:32,910
l've hid things from you.

1435
01:47:33,188 --> 01:47:36,715
But l have never cheated on you.
But l am guilty.

1436
01:47:37,959 --> 01:47:41,417
l'm guilty of paying more attention
to my job than l do my wife.

1437
01:47:41,496 --> 01:47:44,863
l'm guilty of not appreciating
all the little things you do for me.

1438
01:47:44,933 --> 01:47:47,060
Like getting your hair done.

1439
01:47:48,069 --> 01:47:51,698
Wearing that sweet-smelling Chanel
cologne l love so much.

1440
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:56,709
But my biggest crime is that
l didn't tell you l loved you every single day.

1441
01:47:58,013 --> 01:48:01,847
-You're not going to let him off that easy.
-Will you shut up?

1442
01:48:05,987 --> 01:48:07,352
l love you.

1443
01:48:14,729 --> 01:48:15,889
A wheelchair?

1444
01:48:15,964 --> 01:48:19,161
Yes, but the feeling will come back,
l promise.

1445
01:48:19,367 --> 01:48:22,302
<i>Making my way downtown</i>
<i>Walking fast</i>

1446
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:24,463
<i>Faces pass</i>
<i>And I'm home bound</i>

1447
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:26,006
Backup, Tony.

1448
01:48:27,108 --> 01:48:28,769
Hey, girls.

1449
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:37,181
So you guys were pretending to be them
the entire time?

1450
01:48:37,252 --> 01:48:40,153
Yes, we were.
But we was only doing our job.

1451
01:48:40,688 --> 01:48:43,156
l hope you guys aren't too pissed off at us.

1452
01:48:43,224 --> 01:48:44,816
We're so bummed!

1453
01:48:47,062 --> 01:48:49,587
We liked Brittany and Tiffany...

1454
01:48:49,697 --> 01:48:52,291
so much more when you were them.

1455
01:48:53,301 --> 01:48:55,030
So much more!

1456
01:48:56,137 --> 01:48:59,504
So l guess this means
we won't be hanging out any more?

1457
01:48:59,574 --> 01:49:02,441
Don't say that. Of course, we will hang out.

1458
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:05,240
Oh, yeah. We'll all get together
and we're gonna go...

1459
01:49:05,313 --> 01:49:07,747
shopping!
