A round of applause for our Black Eagles!

00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:29,334
Here comes wedge brake.

18
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:35,084
That's the fan formation! Amazing!

19
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,876
Aren't you fed up

20
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,043
with performing the same maneuvers?

21
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,209
Stay in formation, don't
do anything stupid.

22
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,501
Just watch I'll show you something cool.

23
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:47,793
Jung Tae-hun! Jung Tae-hun!

24
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,793
Get back in formation!

25
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,668
Looks like

26
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:00,459
we'll witness an unscripted maneuver!

27
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:01,834
Zero-knot!

28
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:11,876
Mommy, is that plane falling?

29
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:14,584
- What the...
- Engine problem?

30
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:15,543
Zero-knot.

31
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,459
Engine off. Recovery at 300 knots.

32
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:21,834
Hey! Turn on the engine!

33
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:22,834
100 knots

34
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:24,751
200 knots

35
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:26,751
300, recovering.

36
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:38,584
You bastard! What the hell!

DIRECTED BY KIM DONG-WON

38
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:50,334
Everyone, this is...
the best air show in the world!

39
00:02:56,668 --> 00:03:02,293
"SOAR INTO THE SUN"

40
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:06,043
Did you see that? No one can pull that off.

41
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:08,293
Even the Thunderbirds would applaud, right?

42
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:10,584
- I'm the best.
- Here he comes.

43
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,293
Salute

44
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,459
I told you never to do that!

45
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:17,918
Get rid of this bastard now!

46
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,793
You're in deep shit.

47
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:29,751
Grandma, not all Fighter
Wings are dangerous

48
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,626
I'll call you later.

49
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:51,834
Hey!

50
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:04,876
Tae-hun.

51
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,918
Look who it is.

52
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:09,918
Been a while.

53
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,584
What, what are you doing?

54
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,709
Can't old friends hug it out?
Something wrong?

55
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:18,918
- Have you been well?
- Of course.

56
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:20,376
You look good.

57
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,834
When did I not?

58
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,501
Say hello, this is Captain Jung Tae-hun.

59
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,376
And this is our rookie,
Lieutenant Ji Seok-hyeon.

60
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:32,584
Weren't you the Black
Eagles' youngest member?

61
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:33,751
It's an honor!

62
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,751
My reputation precedes me.
Good to meet you.

63
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:40,668
He's also the fastest
member to get kicked out.

64
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:41,918
Enoughâ€œ.

65
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:43,876
Good to have you,

66
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,709
I heard all your antics.

67
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,459
Caused headaches.

68
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:49,918
Good thing I got in here,

69
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,793
wouldn't have been fun in other squads.

70
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,501
Listen,

71
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,501
I was performing zero-knot
at the air show...

72
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:58,459
- Attention!
- Just listen, dude.

73
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:00,793
- On the way down...
- That's enough!

74
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:03,793
'Dude'? Stand up!

75
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,668
- Oh come on.
- Stand up!

76
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:10,543
I am your direct superior and squad leader

77
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:12,834
I will not tolerate such
unacceptable behavior.

78
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,251
Yes, sir.

79
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,834
- Name and rank.
- Captain Jung Tae-hun!

80
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:22,251
Just messing with you.

81
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,709
Come on dude, don't do that shit.

82
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:27,626
What happened to our mighty Tae-hun?

83
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:31,334
Let's get you a welcoming drink!

84
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,709
How low you've fallen.

85
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:39,918
Dude, should I drive?

86
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:41,834
No, no, I'll do it.

87
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:44,793
- My driving bothers you?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,793
You're doing 20.

89
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,709
Can't you hear everyone honking?

90
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:52,501
This is 30, can't you feel it?

91
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:55,751
How the hell do you pilot a jet this way?

92
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:58,876
A car is not a jet

93
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,668
I'll just walk, it'll be faster.

94
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,668
Feels like a roller coaster

95
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:12,876
I'm sorry commander.

96
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,501
You've been too generous.

97
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,668
You should at least meet her.

98
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:21,376
Come in.

99
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,793
Salute! Captain Jung Tae-hun reporting.

100
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:28,918
The zero-knot hot dog

101
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,001
who screwed the air show

102
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,709
I'll head back sir. Salute.

103
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,709
What was the reason for
the dangerous maneuver?

104
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:46,793
I can't judge its potential
without trying it, sir.

105
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:51,834
Captain, being a pilot
is about protecting the public,

106
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:53,876
not quenching your curiosity.

107
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:57,251
Remember that, got it?

108
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,918
Yes, sir. Salute.

109
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:04,876
Salute.

110
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,418
Let me ask you something.

111
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,793
- What was the tactical reason?
- There wasn't one, sir.

112
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,793
Didn't think it was dangerous?

113
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:17,293
I did not believe it was dangerous, sir.

114
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:18,626
So you're free to perform

115
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,209
a banned maneuver

116
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,668
with a $100 million fighter jet?

117
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:26,918
Listen carefully.

118
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:31,918
As long as I'm here,
I'll fix that rotten mindset.

119
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:42,543
What's with Major Lee? So anal.

120
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:44,251
He's our Wing's ace.

121
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,168
USAF's Red Flag appointed him as Top Gun.

122
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,709
- Ace my ass.
- Be careful.

123
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,709
He even scares me

124
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:59,251
I don't care what happens,
gonna go back the first chance I get.

125
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,751
Major, who are those guys?

126
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:07,751
Search And Rescue.

127
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:08,957
Looks like they're training.

128
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,918
- So they'll rescue us?
- That's right.

129
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,834
Hey, keep it up!

130
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,459
Go easy on him Captain Jung.

131
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,251
Maiden flight?

132
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:26,793
Fresh from the Academy

133
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:30,918
I will do my absolute best! Sir!

134
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:34,376
Don't scream! My ears hurt!

135
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,834
This isn't the marine corp.

136
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:41,793
Flying is about a sense of duty.

137
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:47,209
That's important too, but just have fun.

138
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:48,084
Sir?

139
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,751
I really hate being serious.

140
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:54,293
No progress that way, got that? My darling?

141
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,876
Yes, sir, I got it sir!

142
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:58,584
Salute, go prep.

143
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,834
- Run! Run!
- One, two, one, two.

144
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:04,168
Don't do that

145
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:05,793
I was like him too.

146
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,918
She's a beauty.

147
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:14,876
- Salute.
- Salute.

148
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:18,459
This is our Wing's handsome
chief mechanic Min.

149
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,043
Shucks, you're so right.

150
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:22,084
- I'm Jung Tae-hun, sir.
- Jung Tae-hun?

151
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:22,876
Pleased to meet you.

152
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:24,834
That idiot who got kic...

153
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,459
Who'll work on my aircraft?

154
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:31,501
That'd be Sergeant Yu,
she was right here...

155
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:33,626
- Sergeant Yu? Sergeant?
- Yes?

156
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:34,918
This is our team's ace.

157
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:37,793
For her skills, of course.

158
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:43,459
Salute.

159
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:47,709
Sergeant Yu Se-yeong. Pleased to meet you.

160
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:53,293
- Have we met before?
- Nope, never

161
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:57,209
I'll get back to work.

162
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,834
Hey, Sergeant Yu, sergeant?

163
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:12,334
Be gentle, my baby.

164
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:19,793
Relax.

165
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,084
How do you like Sergeant Yu?

166
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:29,501
Not sure yet, sir.

167
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,418
You don't have an eye for women yet.

168
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,376
Totally my style.

169
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:40,293
She can be a major pain. Let's be careful.

170
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:42,793
- Only 100 days till my discharge.
- Yes, sir

171
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:49,668
I told you to be careful, you idiot!

172
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:56,918
This is 10-point parking,
bumping into other cars.

173
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,501
It's American-style.

174
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:00,793
Were you born there?

175
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:04,293
No, I'm from Southern Korea.

176
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:09,668
- In the Boonies?
- Yeah

177
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,293
I'm so pleased to meet a hick.

178
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:16,584
You improve my life, thank you.

179
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:19,543
- Salute!
- What?

180
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:21,251
Salute

181
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,751
I'm really sorry, but...

182
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,834
could you two bastards step out?

183
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,584
You don't deserve to be a soldier!

184
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:39,668
'Mental' at one, 'concentration' at two!

185
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:43,126
- Got that?
- Yes, ma'am!

186
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,376
- One!
- Mental!

187
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:47,334
- Two!
- Concentration!

188
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,626
- One!
- Mental!

189
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,834
- Louder!
- Concentration!

190
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:00,793
Pre-take off check, all systems go.

191
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:05,376
Okay, let's get started.

192
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,251
Down, ready.

193
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:10,293
- Sir, wait, wait!
- Don't be a pussy.

194
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,918
Oh shit!

195
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:19,334
I'm gonna pass out.

196
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,418
Let's start with the basics.

197
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:23,376
Seok-hyeon, let's do this!

198
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:28,793
Your half-assed job puts wrinkles
on my delicate face!

199
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:32,626
Listen up!
There are 2.4 million parts in an aircraft.

200
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:35,751
And when you fill it
with 35,000 pounds of fuel...

201
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:43,293
and shove that in, got it?

202
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,501
We couldn't hear you, sir!

203
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,418
Listen now

204
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:52,334
2.4 million parts in an aircraft, right?

205
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:56,334
And fill it up with
35,000 pounds of fuel...

206
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:05,876
because you guys
aren't paying attention!

207
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:07,376
We couldn't hear you, sir!

208
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:08,751
We couldn't hear you.

209
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:14,793
Forehead on the ground.

210
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,793
Sir, couldn't we go a little slower?

211
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:35,834
Lesson 1,
you mustn't let anyone get on your tail.

212
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,751
- Are you ready?
- I can do this.

213
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:51,918
Passed out?

214
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,626
Alpha 2, don't go overboard.

215
00:14:56,793 --> 00:15:00,793
- Tae-hun, take it easy.
- Roger, joining formation.

216
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,751
- You okay, Seok-hyeon?
- Yes, I'm fine.

217
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,501
Jung Tae-hun!

218
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:12,959
He's a natural in an F-15K.

219
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:15,918
Sir, why did you accept that troublemaker?

220
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:17,418
Didn't want to waste his talent.

221
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,293
He must be on a par with you.

222
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:24,918
Please assign him to my squad,

223
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,959
if you're letting him stay

224
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:31,793
I'll either make him into

225
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,376
a decent pilot

226
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,034
or I'll break him in 3 months.

227
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,918
Alright, let me think about it.

228
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,209
Salute, coffee delivery.

229
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:55,501
Americano for you, and camera macchiato...

230
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,876
I meant caramel...

231
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,751
Thank you.

232
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,334
And yogurt for me.

233
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,334
Forgot the spoon.

234
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,209
Seok-hyeon, let's go greet our commander.

235
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:14,876
Let's.

236
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,959
Hot! That's hot!

237
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:25,209
That burns!

238
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:29,334
This is a top-secret doc!

239
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:30,751
I'm sorry, sir.

240
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,751
Jung Tae-hun, you bastard!

241
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,334
Jung Tae-hun!

242
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,793
He went too harsh on me

243
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:51,793
se-yeong?

244
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:06,543
Daddy! Sergeant Yu!

245
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:10,293
So embarrassing...

246
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:16,251
Not even a hand...

247
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:26,751
Has time stopped?

248
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:29,793
Only a month till my discharge

249
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,709
I'm not even close

250
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:36,668
I got 630 days, shit.

251
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,834
What? 'Shit?

252
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,543
Mind your superior!

253
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,751
- 3rd level.
- 3rd level!

254
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,751
Not cool enough, stop.

255
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:52,626
- Air condition.
- Air condition, sir!

256
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:57,751
Yeah, this feels about right.

257
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,168
Darn you!

258
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,293
Stop right there!

259
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:11,876
Is it too obvious?

260
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:20,376
I was passing by, nothing wrong with that.

261
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:21,709
Right?

262
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:26,793
Let's go.

263
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:30,584
Wait, maybe a little obvious.

264
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:36,751
Woong, get behind me.

265
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,918
- Like this?
- That's it.

266
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:41,834
Watch out for that missile.
Don't come near me!

267
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:45,418
- Shit!
- Shit!

268
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,543
You're not allowed to say that

269
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,584
I was just imitating you.

270
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,751
You can't say it just because I did.

271
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:57,376
It's auntie Yu-jin.

272
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:03,668
- Woong!
- Auntie!

273
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:05,209
Have you been well?

274
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:08,876
- This is for you!
- Nice, pizza!

275
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:09,918
Why are you here?

276
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,584
I was just passing by.

277
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:14,376
Look at the dirty clothes.

278
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,251
- Leave it.
- Hold this.

279
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:19,959
- Aren't you flying today?
- It was in the morning.

280
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:21,293
Dad! Fork!

281
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:22,834
Fork?

282
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,459
Could you hold this?

283
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:28,501
- The flight...
- Dad, can I eat first?

284
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,668
- No, you...
- Of course!

285
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,959
- Eat it.
- Yeah, eat.

286
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:33,918
Here, sauce.

287
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:35,876
Good boy.

288
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:38,209
Can't forget to take a picture.

289
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,293
Come take a picture with us.

290
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,168
Come, come.

291
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,876
Here, take a slice too.

292
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:49,834
One, two, three

293
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:52,834
I'm cut off.

294
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,418
Let's take it again, one, two, three.

295
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:58,823
The North and South Korea summit

296
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,668
will focus on peace...

297
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:04,418
Darn, what if we really unite soon?

298
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:06,293
Can I go home then?

299
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:08,501
Unification doesn't happen that easily.

300
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:10,209
Who knows what'll happen.

301
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,793
- Yo, a cup of coffee.
- Right away, sir.

302
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:17,709
Wait, we'd be jobless if that happens.

303
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,918
- Salute.
- Salute.

304
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:22,626
Yo Captain Jung.

305
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:25,126
Buddy, air combat isn't a joke.

306
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:27,834
Learn a thing or two from Major Lee.

307
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:29,293
Salute.

308
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:34,209
Why not focus on your job?
I feel bad that you get scolded.

309
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:36,709
- You little shit!
- Calm down, calm down.

310
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:39,793
Get back here, say that to me again!

311
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,501
He's always talking back to me.

312
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,501
Darn it, that's hot!

313
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,959
Why didn't you say it was hot!

314
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,793
This is a top-secret doc!

315
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,376
You're on my blacklist.

316
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:59,209
Major Lee has never lost a combat exercise.

317
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,543
He's got the best aim too.

318
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:05,584
He'll remember today,
the day of his first defeat.

319
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:07,751
Won't be easy.

320
00:21:16,293 --> 00:21:17,654
Let's start with them on our tail.

321
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:19,918
Yes sir, this should be fun.

322
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:25,251
Zoom in.

323
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:32,918
- Bogey at 11 o'clock.
- Okay, let's get this started.

324
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,543
Okay, follow us if you can.

325
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:45,501
Contact.

326
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:59,334
- We got you, you little rat.
- Be careful!

327
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:00,251
Right turn.

328
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:12,751
Yo, Tae-hun, where are you hiding?

329
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:16,418
Did you only learn to hide at Black Eagles?

330
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:21,334
Major, watch out!

331
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,876
- Careful!
- Ready missile.

332
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:28,459
We're on collision course

333
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:30,376
I don't care, just shoot!

334
00:22:36,293 --> 00:22:37,459
Are you nuts?!

335
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:42,929
Is he on our tail?

336
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:44,709
Lock-on!

337
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:47,251
- Missile's ready for you.
- Lock-on.

338
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:51,918
Mission accomplished.

339
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:54,584
Shit!

340
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:56,376
End of exercise.

341
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,209
Bring them home.

342
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:03,751
Good job Captain Jung.

343
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:09,126
Can't help but laugh
at your futile effort to win.

344
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,459
You call yourself a fighter pilot?

345
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,293
Good work everyone!

346
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:17,709
Has it ever crossed your mind?

347
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:22,959
If today was a real situation,
you wouldn't be here.

348
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,876
Aerial combat is not a show.

349
00:23:27,918 --> 00:23:29,834
Your life is on the line

350
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:38,459
I made a sharp turn here

351
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,668
I should've had him, but why didn't I?

352
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:49,459
Tactical maneuver... tactical maneuver...

353
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:57,793
What the hell's going on?

354
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:00,168
What?

355
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:02,834
Hawk Aerial Combat Competition?

356
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:07,543
Can I really come back if I win it?

357
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:25,334
Why wear just one earphone?

358
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:28,834
Can't you look at me?

359
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:40,668
Se-yeong

360
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:44,126
I have a question about the F-15K's...

361
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:45,876
That wretched hag...

362
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:49,876
Bringing out old tricks?

363
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,918
Aren't you too old for that?

364
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:56,168
It's nothing, this is part of my work.

365
00:24:56,293 --> 00:25:00,251
Let me remind you
that you're an air force officer.

366
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:02,626
Have a little pride.

367
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,834
Pride is worthless on
the battlefield of love.

368
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:09,793
Keep it together,
don't get kicked out of here too.

369
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:13,959
Why is the food here so dry?

370
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:20,834
- I don't have that kind of power.
- Come on, sir

371
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:23,334
I heard you are
the most influential person here.

372
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:26,543
Where did you hear that fact?

373
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:34,543
Sir, please help me.

374
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,834
Well...

375
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:46,043
But why do you want her?
We've got tons of mechanics

376
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:48,751
I heard her jets are the best.

377
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:51,751
Sure, she's our team's hopes and dreams

378
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:57,793
impeccable track record Flawless.

379
00:25:57,918 --> 00:25:59,584
But there's a problem.

380
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:03,168
There are, you know, people.

381
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,834
Tons of competition, such as...

382
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:10,584
He was just here.

383
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:11,709
Chivas...

384
00:26:14,793 --> 00:26:17,834
What do you take me for?

385
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:21,209
It's 18-year-old single malt.

386
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,334
This goes down smooth, doesn't it?

387
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:30,793
Sir, I beg of you.

388
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:32,293
Please.

389
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:34,709
Sure, don't worry

390
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:37,334
I'll take care of you.

391
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,334
Thank you sir.

392
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:47,959
Chivas...18...

393
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:57,668
North Korea Wonsan <i>2</i> Air Combat Command

394
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:03,918
I gave you plenty of chances, comrade.

395
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:06,543
Chief comrade...

396
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,334
So quiet today.

397
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:28,751
It's near Armistice Line. Stay frosty.

398
00:27:31,376 --> 00:27:34,834
What the hell? Unidentified
bogeys at 1 o'clock.

399
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:38,293
What are they after? What do we do sir?

400
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:41,584
Only fire when fired upon.

401
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:47,918
Everyone on full alert.

402
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,501
What the hell?

403
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,834
Tango <i>2</i> follow me, rest of you stand by.

404
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,834
Sir, what are you doing?

405
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:28,418
You really startled me!

406
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:40,543
Falcon Tango, we're heading back.

407
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:47,668
One strange thing is that...

408
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:48,918
Ministry of Defense Top-Secret Vault

409
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:56,334
those who were purged
were in charge of the Wonsan base.

410
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:58,209
Isn't that the base built

411
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:02,126
to launch ICBMs?

412
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:03,959
It not only has an ICBM launch pad

413
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,959
but it has a new airstrip

414
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:10,834
capable of deploying MIG-29s.

415
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:17,668
We're working with US intelligence
to figure out what's going on.

416
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,501
- But...
- Go on.

417
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,751
We can't rule out the possibility
of a power struggle,

418
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,584
which would lead to a coup.

419
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:33,876
Salute! Flight complete!

420
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:36,751
You've completed 2,000 flight hours.

421
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:37,876
Congratulations!

422
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:44,293
Salute!

423
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:54,876
It leans to the left.

424
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:56,793
What?

425
00:29:56,918 --> 00:30:01,209
The jet I was flying It leans to the left

426
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:03,834
I checked the steering many times.

427
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,251
That can't be

428
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:09,168
I just said it leans. Are you deaf?

429
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:13,751
You can't rely on your
looks alone to get by.

430
00:30:17,543 --> 00:30:18,423
What's with that look?

431
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:20,418
Stand down.

432
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:22,418
Stand down!

433
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:23,959
- It leans!
- What?

434
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:25,626
You think I'm full of shit?!

435
00:30:25,918 --> 00:30:28,418
Why is he always on Yu's case?

436
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:31,126
- Of course not!
- Morning, commander!

437
00:30:31,251 --> 00:30:31,876
Salute!

438
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:36,209
Salute! Captain Jo reporting!

439
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:41,251
I'm sorry, from behind you looked like him.

440
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:42,584
What?

441
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:46,334
- And major's looking for you.
- Dammit.

442
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:50,584
And you! Your promotion
depends on my recommendation.

443
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:51,834
You hear?

444
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:57,293
And Jung, I look nothing like him!

445
00:30:57,418 --> 00:30:59,834
- I'm sorry.
- Watch your mouth.

446
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,418
What the hell did I do now?

447
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,918
Goddamn toothless mutt.

448
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:09,251
Are you alright?

449
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:11,418
Shit always rolls downwards.

450
00:31:11,543 --> 00:31:13,959
That vile piece of shit.

451
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:17,418
You pilots got some bad habits.

452
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:22,334
Sergeant Yu, since it came up,

453
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:24,293
how about further steer testing?

454
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:25,709
Hey, sergeant...

455
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:28,668
Did you need something?

456
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,876
Was I talking to myself?

457
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:40,709
Sergeant! Sergeant! Let's talk.

458
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:41,876
Go.

459
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:49,834
Sergeant Yu, come on, open the door.

460
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:56,959
Salute

461
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,543
I'm here, sir.

462
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,918
- Didn't you call for me?
- No, I didn't.

463
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:16,959
Salute

464
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,251
I'm gonna pass out...

465
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:32,793
You could've... given me a ride.

466
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:34,834
How could you just take off?

467
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,626
Sergeant, I need your help

468
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:42,543
I have to win the upcoming
Hawk Competition.

469
00:32:42,751 --> 00:32:45,959
And I need the best mechanic.

470
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:52,543
Between you and me,
I really want to beat Major Lee.

471
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:55,626
That's none of my business.

472
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,751
Why not?

473
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:00,793
Don't you know Captain Jo is his co-pilot?

474
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:02,959
It's our chance to kick their asses.

475
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:04,376
Right?

476
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:06,959
Then can I ask you a favor?

477
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,793
Yes, please do that.

478
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,435
It's unlikely, but there was a complaint

479
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:15,168
that my jet leans.

480
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,709
Can you check it out on your next flight?

481
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:19,979
Okay, got it.

482
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:24,418
- After you win.
- Sure.

483
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:27,957
A modern fighter jet is filled

484
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,209
with cutting-edge tech and sensors

485
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:31,626
I know that.

486
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,376
Ever heard of the RLS system?

487
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:38,376
RLS? I heard that before.

488
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:41,751
Even when a wing is shot off,

489
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:46,251
RLS will cut off hydraulics on that wing,

490
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:50,501
so that the aircraft
can continue flying for a while.

491
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:54,584
There was an incident in which

492
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:57,834
an Israeli pilot was able to land safely.

493
00:33:58,959 --> 00:33:59,668
Question,

494
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:05,376
what if it malfunctions
and the wing is blown off?

495
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,543
What do I do then?

496
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,543
Then you're in deep trouble.

497
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:12,418
Or eject. Follow me.

498
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:59,209
Falcon Tango, flying 15,000.

499
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:00,709
Left turn.

500
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:08,834
Good work

501
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:22,849
10-minute break.

502
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,751
Break time.

503
00:35:32,251 --> 00:35:33,959
Survival training's hard, isn't it?

504
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:36,376
My calves...

505
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:49,876
Don't smoke?

506
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:51,793
I wanted to try.

507
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:56,543
Your parents raised a soft child

508
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:03,834
I grew up in an orphanage.

509
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:09,876
Don't know what they look like.

510
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:17,418
Staff sergeant, we're ready sir.

511
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:20,834
Let's go.

512
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,793
You know that we got your back, right?

513
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:31,959
My role is to save a pilot at all costs,

514
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,459
okay?

515
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:36,793
Okay

516
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:40,834
I'm late.

517
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:45,209
You haven't trained enough
for the competition tomorrow.

518
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:47,334
My everyday skill is enough.

519
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,709
Fly with Tae-hun from now on.

520
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,584
It'll be better for you.

521
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:57,168
Is that an order?

522
00:36:58,709 --> 00:36:59,793
Yes it is

523
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:23,251
I'm so sorry, and good...

524
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:29,001
Good night.

525
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,418
Sergeant, working late?

526
00:37:36,543 --> 00:37:38,751
I brought some snacks, have some.

527
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:43,084
What are you doing?

528
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:45,459
Don't you know drinking is forbidden here?

529
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:48,709
I know it's forbidden.

530
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,418
But you gotta drink, I'll take the heat

531
00:37:51,918 --> 00:37:55,751
I looked into the leaning
problem you mentioned.

532
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,918
It's pretty serious.

533
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:01,751
Could you elaborate please?

534
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:04,751
I need a drink first.

535
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:11,584
The problem is that there's no problem!

536
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:32,584
How about a bet?

537
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:37,376
If you don't win, I get to slap you.

538
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:38,376
Why?

539
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:42,001
I really want to slap
you if given a chance.

540
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:47,834
So what do I get if I win?

541
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,334
Must I do something for you?

542
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:55,709
Give-and-take is the basis of a bet.

543
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:56,959
Right?

544
00:38:58,709 --> 00:38:59,793
What do you want?

545
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:02,293
Let's go on a date.

546
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:05,959
Or buy drinks? Deal?

547
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:12,209
- Okay.
- Okay, deal!

548
00:39:16,543 --> 00:39:18,251
Let's toast...

549
00:39:19,418 --> 00:39:21,876
Are all pilots alike?

550
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:26,334
No, not everyone's a bastard.

551
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:27,876
You drank too much.

552
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:31,793
Go get some more!

553
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:33,959
What's going on?

554
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:37,376
You can't drink in the hangar!

555
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:38,959
I'm sorry sir.

556
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:40,709
- Sergeant.
- What's wrong with her?

557
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,543
You idiot, are you drunk?

558
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,293
You're adorable!

559
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:50,668
Se-yeong, Stop that!

560
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:52,459
I'm sorry sir.

561
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:55,834
Come here!

562
00:39:56,501 --> 00:40:00,334
Why is she so strong? Please stop that.

563
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:03,793
Take her inside, go!

564
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:11,168
What do I do with her...

565
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,084
You shouldn't have given her drinks.

566
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:16,793
Let me pour you one.

567
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:18,918
You should've came to me.

568
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,001
Thought you were busy...

569
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:22,001
Hey!

570
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:25,959
Do it right.

571
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:31,876
She's a bad drunk.

572
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:35,584
Turns out, she has a sappy story.

573
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:38,793
What do you mean?

574
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:43,418
She's an Air Force Academy graduate.

575
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:45,334
Academy?

576
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:50,126
She was in the hospital for a while.
Her eardrum was ruptured,

577
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:53,876
so she can't hear well
without a hearing aid.

578
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:56,626
Why wear just one earphone?

579
00:40:57,501 --> 00:41:01,418
She gave up becoming a pilot
but she couldn't give up aircraft.

580
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,626
What's the big deal about being a pilot?

581
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:13,209
No, let me pour you one.

582
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:17,043
Are you listening to me?

583
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:19,251
- Sergeant Yu.
- Answer me.

584
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,876
- I said answer me!
- Hey, Sergeant Yu.

585
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:25,001
So salty.

586
00:41:26,168 --> 00:41:31,251
You think you're so high and mighty?

587
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:39,334
My fault for getting you drunk

588
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:43,418
I hope you give your 100%.

589
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,334
At the very least,
don't let another Wing take the win.

590
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:49,876
- You got that?
- Yes sir.

591
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:51,834
Commander

592
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:55,168
I don't know if I should ask you this.

593
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:58,334
But is there a prize?

594
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:01,376
Is there?

595
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:08,418
I'll grant one wish within my power.

596
00:42:08,543 --> 00:42:11,876
Nice! Awesome.

597
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:14,584
That is all.

598
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,709
Attention.

599
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:20,626
Salute.

600
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:25,251
Dismissed.

601
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,918
Major,

602
00:42:27,376 --> 00:42:30,584
shouldn't we at least
get a car for winning?

603
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,668
We're risking our lives here.

604
00:42:37,876 --> 00:42:40,334
- Did you laugh at me?
- No sir.

605
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:42,334
You got time to laugh?

606
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,876
It's been a while

607
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:45,043
since your squad last won.

608
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:47,751
This is your chance Challenge us.

609
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,459
You're the ace...

610
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:51,876
I'm not done with you!

611
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:57,626
- All ready?
- Yes sir.

612
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,418
- Salute.
- Salute.

613
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:07,293
Where did Sergeant Yu go?

614
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,459
She went on a personal errand.

615
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,668
Where could she be?

616
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:19,834
- Captain Jung!
- Yeah?

617
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:21,501
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

618
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:22,668
And get that win.

619
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,834
Please bring home the title.

620
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:34,293
Currently Major Son is leading the charge.

621
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:35,793
We'll begin the air-to-surface match

622
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:39,501
between Eagle and Falcon squads.

623
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:40,760
Captain Jung Tae-hun.

624
00:43:40,793 --> 00:43:41,459
Major Lee Cheol-hui
Major Son Kyung-soo.

625
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:45,251
The Hawk Aerial Combat Competition
first began in 1960.

626
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:50,418
As the Air Force's biggest competition,
20 squads from various Wings,

627
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:54,709
and over 200 pilots
compete to test their skills.

628
00:43:57,251 --> 00:43:58,251
Firing ASM.

629
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:06,876
Falcon's Major Lee takes the lead
with perfectly placed shots.

630
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:09,501
Captain Jung is out of
the ranking despite an early lead.

631
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:13,293
Jung, you'll get yours if you don't win.

632
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:16,084
Captain Jung is up next
for the precision strike.

633
00:44:16,209 --> 00:44:17,501
We can do this

634
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,626
I'm a low altitude specialist.

635
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:22,251
If we go low, we can cut the lap time.

636
00:44:22,584 --> 00:44:23,959
It could be dangerous.

637
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:26,459
You've got no guts. Let's do this.

638
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:35,709
- I might pass out.
- I'm gonna eject you.

639
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:36,876
What? I'm kidding.

640
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:42,043
The pilots must hit all 5 targets
precisely within the time limit.

641
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:44,543
This category awards the most points.

642
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:46,626
Please look carefully at the target.

643
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:48,376
Time's running out.

644
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:51,793
- Ready, now!
- No, wait a bit.

645
00:44:52,418 --> 00:44:54,418
- We have to fire now.
- Just wait!

646
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,418
- Captain, fire!
- No, not yet.

647
00:44:59,918 --> 00:45:02,334
What the hell? How far will he go down?

648
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,376
Lock-on, fire now!

649
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:05,376
Deploying missiles.

650
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:18,709
Impressive! A total of 3,980 points.

651
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,376
Holy shit, awesome!

652
00:45:23,751 --> 00:45:26,709
What did I tell you. I
said I could pull it off.

653
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:30,293
Shit!

654
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:36,834
The winner of this year's
Hawk Aerial Combat Competition

655
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:40,793
is Captain Jung Tae-hun with 3,980 points.

656
00:45:41,168 --> 00:45:43,418
- Yes!
- A round of applause everyone.

657
00:45:43,543 --> 00:45:49,293
With that, we'll bring the broadcast
of this year's competition to a close.

658
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,168
Yes!

659
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,959
Why is it so noisy?

660
00:45:59,876 --> 00:46:03,668
To the winner of 52nd Hawk Competition,

661
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:08,834
thank you Captain Jung, you made my day.

662
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:14,459
- Let's toast! Soar!
- Into the sun!

663
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:17,043
Honestly, I didn't think you'd win.

664
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:19,959
- It's all because of Seok-hyeon.
- Oh come on now.

665
00:46:20,084 --> 00:46:22,418
- I almost fainted again.
- Captain Jung.

666
00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:23,959
Salute.

667
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:28,751
- Good work.
- Thank you sir.

668
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:36,751
So you're going back to the Black Eagles?

669
00:46:37,584 --> 00:46:41,043
I want to think about it further.

670
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:42,459
Let's have a drink!

671
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:46,251
I'll buy, but I'm not interested in dating.

672
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,709
Beer? Yeah, I'll buy.

673
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,584
Hey!

674
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:56,959
You startled me!

675
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:59,834
What are you doing there?

676
00:47:00,209 --> 00:47:03,501
Working of course, what else?

677
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:07,626
I didn't know you were there.
Don't shout at me.

678
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:10,459
Don't take it out on the jet.

679
00:47:10,668 --> 00:47:12,543
My ears...

680
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:19,959
Why haven't you gone home yet?

681
00:47:20,043 --> 00:47:21,251
Got some work left to do.

682
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,918
- Waiting for someone?
- What?

683
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:27,293
Nonsense.

684
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:32,751
Alright, go home already.

685
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:37,418
Sleep in your own bed.

686
00:47:37,543 --> 00:47:39,543
So tired.

687
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:16,709
Good shot, sergeant.

688
00:48:17,209 --> 00:48:18,751
Haven't you gone home yet?

689
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:21,834
Why are you here at this hour?

690
00:48:22,418 --> 00:48:24,918
- Just passing by.
- You scared me.

691
00:48:25,043 --> 00:48:27,043
Did you wait for me?

692
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:28,834
Of course not

693
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:33,668
I wanted to rescue
a bored paper plane-folding girl.

694
00:48:33,793 --> 00:48:34,876
Forget it.

695
00:48:36,668 --> 00:48:38,793
Should I take you home?

696
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,084
Forget it.

697
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,334
Come on, I'll walk you home.

698
00:48:57,918 --> 00:49:01,793
Harder than it looks. She's good.

699
00:49:02,543 --> 00:49:05,418
Se-yeong, wait for me!

700
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:10,084
We're here, right?

701
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:11,251
How did you know?

702
00:49:11,376 --> 00:49:14,751
You don't remember?
You were so drunk that night,

703
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:16,076
I circled this area several...

704
00:49:16,668 --> 00:49:17,793
You idiot

705
00:49:17,959 --> 00:49:19,418
I'm off.

706
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:22,668
Invite me up for tea or coffee!

707
00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:29,418
By the way...

708
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:32,751
Aren't you asking me out?

709
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,251
Right.

710
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,626
A promise is a promise

711
00:49:42,418 --> 00:49:47,126
I'm off tomorrow, see you then.

712
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:57,918
Good night!

713
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:27,751
I'm sorry I didn't come more often.

714
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:30,501
Please don't come anymore.

715
00:50:30,918 --> 00:50:33,126
- This is the least I can do.
- No.

716
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:37,876
You make it worse by coming here.

717
00:50:39,543 --> 00:50:40,959
Take care.

718
00:50:56,126 --> 00:50:59,418
Engine output is dropping. Emergency!

719
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:00,626
Losing control.

720
00:51:00,751 --> 00:51:03,334
Dropping fast! Mayday, mayday.

721
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:04,668
We have to eject!

722
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:06,793
No, we have to save this jet!

723
00:51:06,918 --> 00:51:08,834
Sir, we have to eject!

724
00:51:09,626 --> 00:51:10,626
Elect!

725
00:51:17,043 --> 00:51:17,626
Elect!

726
00:51:30,793 --> 00:51:34,334
Tae-hun, you can't do this!

727
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:38,376
- I haven't paid off the lease yet!
- Watch your hand.

728
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:41,334
Hey! I need my car in the afternoon.

729
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:44,418
Take a cab, I'll bring
it back with a full tank.

730
00:51:44,543 --> 00:51:47,251
No! Be careful!

731
00:51:47,376 --> 00:51:49,459
No speeding, and keep a safe distance!

732
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:50,918
Watch your front!

733
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:53,834
Be careful, you bastard!

734
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:00,001
Good morning.

735
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:17,709
- In a suit?
- Nice, isn't it?

736
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,834
First date impression is important.

737
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:22,543
It'll be cold...

738
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:41,959
This is the worst date ever!

739
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:43,668
Wanna fly it?

740
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,501
I'm a fighter pilot.

741
00:52:45,626 --> 00:52:49,126
You want me to fly a toy? I got pride too!

742
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:50,584
Try it.

743
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:59,043
Se-yeong, help!

744
00:52:59,168 --> 00:53:00,626
Easy, easy.

745
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:02,459
Just feel the wind.

746
00:53:03,043 --> 00:53:05,751
- Feel the wind?
- Smooth, like this.

747
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:07,334
Good, steer like this.

748
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:12,126
Nice and easy.

749
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:16,543
This is awesome!

750
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:36,876
- Good flight?
- Yeah.

751
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:44,043
It's strange...

752
00:53:44,793 --> 00:53:48,584
You realize you and Tae-hun
are so much alike?

753
00:53:50,543 --> 00:53:52,126
Drop the bullshit.

754
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:56,209
He's not a soldier,
he's a child who does what he likes.

755
00:53:57,209 --> 00:54:00,793
You were like that too as a cadet,

756
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,751
you were the best.

757
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:06,543
If it wasn't for that incident

758
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:10,209
I told you never to bring that up.

759
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:16,626
Cheol-hui, it's about time you let go.

760
00:54:17,418 --> 00:54:19,959
You did your best in that situation.

761
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:30,001
What's with the weather?

762
00:54:31,626 --> 00:54:33,293
Did you check the weather?

763
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:35,001
It's fog off the sea.

764
00:54:35,168 --> 00:54:37,793
- What?
- Sea fog

765
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:40,459
I think we came too far.

766
00:54:40,668 --> 00:54:42,876
What do we do? It's hard to see.

767
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:46,834
We gotta land now, over there on the beach.

768
00:54:47,668 --> 00:54:50,376
Land here? Where's the ejection switch?

769
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:52,251
No such thing, stupid!

770
00:54:53,584 --> 00:54:55,168
Switch to glide.

771
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,334
That's it.

772
00:54:57,584 --> 00:54:59,709
Stop fidgeting!

773
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:02,334
Hold tight.

774
00:55:02,626 --> 00:55:04,418
- Let's go down.
- Now?

775
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:07,959
- We're falling!
- Easy, easy.

776
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:10,668
- Daddy!
- Will you calm down?!

777
00:55:13,168 --> 00:55:15,793
- Almost there!
- Brake! Brake!

778
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:31,668
Come on, give me fire already!

779
00:55:32,584 --> 00:55:33,793
Does this really work?

780
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:36,793
Sure, I did this many times
in survival training.

781
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,501
You've been at it for 30 minutes.

782
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:40,709
Here it comes!

783
00:55:44,501 --> 00:55:47,668
Come on, almost there!

784
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:50,543
- Almost there, look!
- You're good for nothing

785
00:55:51,626 --> 00:55:53,001
I knew you were useless

786
00:55:53,043 --> 00:55:54,083
when you busted my glider.

787
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:56,834
Look, I got a spark!

788
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:59,834
So useless.

789
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:03,543
You should've said you had a lighter!

790
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,918
I wanted to give you a
chance to impress me.

791
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:10,251
All that work for nothing!

792
00:56:10,376 --> 00:56:12,376
Don't get mad at me.

793
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:16,709
You really didn't see any villages nearby?

794
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:20,501
I told you, there's nothing here.

795
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,668
Not a single visible light.

796
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:23,584
Did you get a good look?

797
00:56:23,709 --> 00:56:27,584
I walked a klick all around,
but there's nothing.

798
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:30,584
Not even an ant, absolutely nothing.

799
00:56:32,668 --> 00:56:36,834
Did you bring anything else?
Like a blanket?

800
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:37,918
It's getting cold

801
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:42,209
I have an emergency sleeping bag.

802
00:56:42,334 --> 00:56:44,793
But there's only one.

803
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:49,001
Just one?! That's perfect!

804
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:52,751
Since it's freezing,
we should hold each other tight.

805
00:56:54,834 --> 00:56:56,668
- What was that for?
- Did it hurt?

806
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:03,418
Since I got the firewood,
go fish for something to eat.

807
00:57:03,543 --> 00:57:06,584
- What?
- Stop pinching me.

808
00:57:08,543 --> 00:57:11,418
What's the occasion?
This place is too fancy.

809
00:57:15,168 --> 00:57:16,918
Aren't you eating?

810
00:57:17,043 --> 00:57:19,209
Just watching you eat is enough

811
00:57:20,043 --> 00:57:22,709
I had dinner with the commander.

812
00:57:22,834 --> 00:57:25,084
The commander? Why?

813
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:28,043
I requested my discharge.

814
00:57:32,418 --> 00:57:35,626
- Are you nuts?!
- Nope.

815
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:39,376
But this is.

816
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:47,418
Yu-jin, will you marry me?

817
00:57:51,459 --> 00:57:52,959
Is that a no?

818
00:57:57,084 --> 00:58:01,959
- Is that an order?
- Yes, it's an order.

819
00:58:03,043 --> 00:58:05,709
Last order as your superior.

820
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:18,084
Come on, don't cry.

821
00:58:22,459 --> 00:58:25,793
Sergeant, did you do what I asked?

822
00:58:25,918 --> 00:58:26,793
I did not, sir.

823
00:58:26,918 --> 00:58:29,209
Wasn't I clear enough?
Why didn't you do it?

824
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:31,626
- He said not to do it.
- Who did?

825
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:35,293
The commander flew in the morning
and said nothing's wrong.

826
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:37,959
He liked the feel of the aircraft.

827
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:41,251
- The commander flew it?
- Yes, sir.

828
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:47,668
- Did he have a scheduled flight?
- Of course not.

829
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:49,918
Just a little bit.

830
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:52,334
Major Lee is flying later,

831
00:58:52,376 --> 00:58:55,334
should I adjust it drastically?

832
00:58:55,626 --> 00:58:56,709
What?

833
00:58:58,043 --> 00:59:00,043
- No!
- Why not?

834
00:59:00,626 --> 00:59:03,334
Don't! Just don't.

835
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:04,876
What's with you today?

836
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:06,659
You said it leans to the left.

837
00:59:07,584 --> 00:59:11,168
It used to, it really did

838
00:59:12,459 --> 00:59:13,918
but it's okay now.

839
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:18,084
Let's go.

840
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:19,584
Keep it UP.

841
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:26,918
Laughing at me?

842
00:59:27,543 --> 00:59:30,834
Something wrong... with the jet?

843
00:59:31,626 --> 00:59:35,834
It has serious leaning problem!
Do your job properly!

844
00:59:42,334 --> 00:59:47,251
I think that asshole's the one
with serious problem.

845
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,668
- You think so?
- Forget it, let's go.

846
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:55,293
How's dinner at my place?
Got an announcement.

847
00:59:56,584 --> 00:59:57,834
Announcement?

848
00:59:58,584 --> 01:00:01,834
Yeah, and buy me a new fridge.

849
01:00:01,959 --> 01:00:03,334
With dual doors.

850
01:00:03,751 --> 01:00:05,501
Got a new addition to the family.

851
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:09,834
- Fridge?
- Smile.

852
01:00:15,918 --> 01:00:17,418
Can't be...

853
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:23,043
Hey, Seok-hyeon.

854
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,209
Go fetch a blanket in my room.

855
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:54,584
Yo Yu-jin!

856
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:55,793
Watcha doing?

857
01:00:55,918 --> 01:01:00,584
Woong has a field trip tomorrow.

858
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:02,418
Here, taste this one.

859
01:01:06,084 --> 01:01:06,793
Good?

860
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:09,668
Yeah, not bad

861
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:12,168
I left this out.

862
01:01:13,376 --> 01:01:16,459
Our mighty Yu-jin's domesticated now.

863
01:01:16,584 --> 01:01:19,293
Go away, watch TV or something.

864
01:01:22,334 --> 01:01:24,626
- What?
- You look happy.

865
01:01:26,418 --> 01:01:29,626
You're distracting me, go home.

866
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:31,751
Okay, okay.

867
01:01:34,168 --> 01:01:35,709
Dude, I'm off!

868
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:49,959
Sergeant Yu.

869
01:02:02,626 --> 01:02:03,751
Careful of the cars.

870
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:05,668
Put on your bag.

871
01:02:08,626 --> 01:02:11,084
Don't fight with your friends
and listen to your teacher.

872
01:02:11,209 --> 01:02:13,918
Okay dad. Bye!

873
01:02:15,168 --> 01:02:16,543
Give me a kiss.

874
01:02:23,793 --> 01:02:27,043
- I'm late.
- Alright.

875
01:02:28,876 --> 01:02:30,334
Your lunch!

876
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:37,418
North Korea Wonsan <i>2</i> Air Combat Command.

877
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:04,251
An enemy aircraft
has crossed the Armistice Line.

Requesting defection.

882
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:24,334
The bogey is sending defection signal

883
01:04:25,876 --> 01:04:27,668
I'll lead the bogey,

Bogey Sighted.

888
01:04:57,918 --> 01:04:59,584
Another bogey in the area!

889
01:05:00,293 --> 01:05:03,793
Eagle Alpha 1,
emergency situation Tail the bogey.

890
01:05:03,918 --> 01:05:05,376
There's another bogey.

891

Take care of it Alpha <i>2</i>

892
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:08,043

Support squad en route.

- This is a real combat situation.
- Roger.

896
01:05:34,793 --> 01:05:36,751
This is no joke.

897
01:05:42,626 --> 01:05:44,501
Visual on bogey <i>2.</i>

898
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,168

I got a bad feeling

Roger.

903
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:08,459
Defector in sight, permission to fire.

904
01:06:09,084 --> 01:06:10,501
Granted.

905
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:14,626
Tae-hun, careful.

906
01:06:15,793 --> 01:06:17,251
He's flying to Alpha 1's position.

907
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:20,836
Bogey <i>2</i> fired a missile.

908
01:06:20,918 --> 01:06:22,376
Missile on our 6.

909
01:06:26,209 --> 01:06:28,918
- Defector MIG hit.
- This was a setup.

910
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:45,751
Right wing hit!

911
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,793
Lock-on, firing Fox Two.

912
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:53,459
Do not engage! You're in a civilian area.

913
01:06:53,584 --> 01:06:55,876
- Absolutely no civilian casualties!
- Switching to guns.

914
01:06:56,043 --> 01:06:57,084
Guns ready.

915
01:06:57,334 --> 01:07:00,668
Gun malfunction, it's damaged from earlier.

916
01:07:00,793 --> 01:07:01,876
Shit.

917
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:04,834
Lure the bogey away from the city.

918
01:07:06,209 --> 01:07:08,209
He's following the river.

919
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:10,918
Get me Joint Chief.

920
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:19,043
Enemy aircraft in Seoul air space.

921
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:22,501
Do not engage until permitted

922
01:07:32,668 --> 01:07:34,584
I'll lead the bogey to the city limits.

923
01:07:36,168 --> 01:07:39,043
- Tae-hun, cover me.
- It's too dangerous.

924
01:07:44,418 --> 01:07:45,418
Come after me.

925
01:07:51,418 --> 01:07:53,751
Eagle 1 is under attack,
permission to engage.

926
01:07:53,876 --> 01:07:56,334
Denied! Get it away from the city!

927
01:07:56,459 --> 01:07:58,334
They fired on us first!

928
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:36,209
MIG's heading for the city.

929
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:49,209
- It's too dangerous, lock-on!
- Roger.

930
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:50,959
Missile ready.

931
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:58,751
Dae-seo, get outside the firing range!

932
01:08:58,876 --> 01:09:02,626
Don't shoot! Bogey's near the skyscraper!

933
01:10:22,043 --> 01:10:23,834
MIG's heading up the river.

934
01:10:25,668 --> 01:10:28,084
This is Falcon Tango, joining Alpha squad

935
01:10:29,751 --> 01:10:32,959
Alpha 1 is in danger,
requesting permission to fire!

936
01:10:33,084 --> 01:10:35,668
Sir, they haven't reached the city limits.

937
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:40,168
Maintain current position.

938
01:10:40,418 --> 01:10:42,126
Do not fire, maintain position.

939
01:10:43,418 --> 01:10:46,626
Do not fire until command permits.

940
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:54,751
- Permission to fire.
- Shoot him now!

941
01:11:00,168 --> 01:11:01,209
Watch out!

942
01:11:11,459 --> 01:11:13,793
Alpha 1's in danger, there's no time!

943
01:11:14,126 --> 01:11:14,959
Take this!

944
01:11:26,209 --> 01:11:28,834
Alpha 1 is hit, going down

945
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:30,626
Alpha 1 going down hard.

946
01:11:34,001 --> 01:11:36,709
No control over the
aircraft, losing altitude.

947
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,459
Snap out of it Seok-hyeon,
we have to eject!

948
01:11:40,084 --> 01:11:41,751
Wake up!

949
01:11:43,084 --> 01:11:46,043
Falcon 1, I'll pursue the bogey.

950
01:11:48,834 --> 01:11:50,626
Crash imminent, ejecting co-pilot.

951
01:12:01,334 --> 01:12:04,251
Abandon jet, eject, Eagle 1.

952
01:12:04,501 --> 01:12:07,501
Civilians at crash site, I'll steer away

953
01:12:11,793 --> 01:12:14,334
Alpha 1, eject! Eject!

954
01:12:23,793 --> 01:12:25,959
Eject before it's too late!

955
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:28,959
- Eject! Please!
- Eject!

956
01:12:29,459 --> 01:12:30,668
Dae-seo, please.

957
01:12:30,793 --> 01:12:33,334
This is your last chance, eject now!

958
01:13:14,376 --> 01:13:15,501
Permission to fire.

959
01:13:17,709 --> 01:13:19,293
Permission to fire!

960
01:13:22,126 --> 01:13:23,959
Let me shoot him, dammit!

961
01:13:24,084 --> 01:13:25,668
He crossed the Armistice Line.

962
01:13:25,793 --> 01:13:29,793
- Do not engage.
- Fire! Fire, goddammit!

963
01:13:29,918 --> 01:13:32,626
Return home. I repeat, do not engage

964
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:57,459
Alpha 1 co-pilot
is drifting north of the border.

965
01:13:57,959 --> 01:14:03,376
Ejection position, whiskey 5-5-4-2-4-7

966
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:09,126
I repeat, whiskey 5-5-4-2-4-7.

967
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:44,876
Why didn't you fire?
Dae-seo's dead because of you.

968
01:14:46,084 --> 01:14:49,834
- Didn't you hear the order?
- Shit!

969
01:14:50,209 --> 01:14:54,334
You'll follow orders and
let your wingman die?!

970
01:14:56,126 --> 01:14:58,168
You'll risk an all-out war?

971
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:01,376
Fire when fired upon, that's what you said!

972
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:02,876
A soldier.

973
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,459
Mustn't act on emotions like you.

974
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:12,543
If it was me,
I'd have fired at the first chance.

975
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:15,959
Am I wrong?

976
01:15:17,418 --> 01:15:18,876
Bastard!

977
01:15:19,459 --> 01:15:21,084
Get up!

978
01:15:41,251 --> 01:15:43,334
You're not the only one in pain.

979
01:16:35,293 --> 01:16:38,918
My love Yu-jin, thank you
for being by my side.

980
01:16:39,043 --> 01:16:42,626
PS. I'm sorry
I couldn't find you the right ring in time.

981
01:17:30,334 --> 01:17:31,834
Ready, aim!

982
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:40,376
Fire!

983
01:17:45,126 --> 01:17:46,584
Fire!

984
01:17:50,293 --> 01:17:51,751
Fire!

985
01:19:07,418 --> 01:19:11,376
Political struggles within
the North's government has been uncovered.

986
01:19:11,501 --> 01:19:13,168
The People's Army Chief Kang Sung-yul

987
01:19:13,209 --> 01:19:16,209
was responsible for the attack...

988
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:19,084
as part of a hostile take over

989
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:22,501
and the beginning of a coup d'etat.

990
01:19:22,668 --> 01:19:24,834
Yesterday's attack on midtown Seoul

991
01:19:24,959 --> 01:19:27,834
by fighter jets was part of the coup plans.

992
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:32,376
ROK-US Combined Forces Underground Command.

993
01:19:35,293 --> 01:19:36,834
This wasn't reported by the media,

994
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:40,168
but according to the KH-12 recon satellite,

995
01:19:40,293 --> 01:19:42,626
the Wonsan ICBM

996
01:19:42,793 --> 01:19:44,418
began fuelling 12 hours ago.

997
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:50,084
- And the target?
- It's presumed to be the USA.

998
01:19:50,209 --> 01:19:51,918
United States is targeted.

999
01:19:52,043 --> 01:19:53,418
Our position remains.

1000
01:19:53,543 --> 01:19:55,251
The first stealth aircraft attack

1001
01:19:55,584 --> 01:19:57,793
will take place in the Wonsan area.

1002
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,418
What do you mean?

1003
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:00,876
I've talked at link

1004
01:20:00,959 --> 01:20:02,709
with the commander of the Pacific fleet.

1005
01:20:02,834 --> 01:20:05,501
For an attack order from George Washington,

1006
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:07,501
utilizing stealth aircraft.

1007
01:20:07,584 --> 01:20:09,543
We will not simply wait around

1008
01:20:09,668 --> 01:20:12,209
for the ICBM to become fully fueled.

1009
01:20:12,334 --> 01:20:13,043
Are we clear on that?

1010
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:14,293
Minister.

1011
01:20:21,168 --> 01:20:23,834
Tiger 0, Tiger 0, this is Eagle Alpha 1-2.

1012
01:20:23,959 --> 01:20:26,543
Current position, Charlie
Tango Bravo 3-6-1.

1013
01:20:27,543 --> 01:20:29,001
We found him.

1014
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:38,501
His GPS signal is live.

1015
01:20:38,668 --> 01:20:40,793
We picked up the pilot's signal.

1016
01:20:55,793 --> 01:20:58,418
The satellite confirmed his location.

1017
01:20:58,543 --> 01:20:59,293
Where is it?

1018
01:20:59,418 --> 01:21:02,043
It's near the 38th Parallel
where Kang is in control.

1019
01:21:03,626 --> 01:21:06,334
This is 21st Fighter Wing commander Choi.

1020
01:21:06,459 --> 01:21:09,334
One of our pilots is behind enemy lines.

1021
01:21:09,543 --> 01:21:13,668
If we're given 48 hours, we'll deploy SAR

1022
01:21:13,793 --> 01:21:17,668
to secure our pilot,
and neutralize the threat at Wonsan base.

1023
01:21:17,793 --> 01:21:20,043
That's the right course of action.

1024
01:21:20,168 --> 01:21:23,209
We cannot permit any other operation.

1025
01:21:23,418 --> 01:21:27,459
We must carry out a precision
strike on the nuclear facility.

1026
01:21:27,584 --> 01:21:28,918
He's right.

1027
01:21:29,459 --> 01:21:32,376
If a nuclear attack takes
place on our soil,

1028
01:21:32,793 --> 01:21:35,793
another colossal tragedy will follow.

1029
01:21:36,001 --> 01:21:38,209
We must not let this happen.

1030
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:40,543
This is our land.

1031
01:21:40,668 --> 01:21:42,001
Absolutely not.

1032
01:21:42,376 --> 01:21:45,043
Anything else out of the US operation plan

1033
01:21:45,168 --> 01:21:47,126
will not be tolerated.

1034
01:21:47,876 --> 01:21:51,043
Captain Jung, please calm down.
You can't do this.

1035
01:21:51,168 --> 01:21:53,459
Captain, we can't let you fly!

1036
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:55,084
- Let go!
- You can't!

1037
01:21:55,209 --> 01:21:56,293
- I know how you feel.
- Let me go!

1038
01:21:56,418 --> 01:21:57,876
What are you doing!

1039
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:02,876
Please allow me to deploy!

1040
01:22:03,334 --> 01:22:05,834
I'll bring back Seok-hyeon on my own

1041
01:22:05,959 --> 01:22:07,209
insubordinate fool!

1042
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:09,251
I can't let you do that.

1043
01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:11,418
Take him into custody.

1044
01:22:11,543 --> 01:22:13,751
Don't fire, don't engage, don't rescue.

1045
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:17,126
Is this what being a
real soldier is about?!

1046
01:22:17,668 --> 01:22:21,084
My squad mates are dying before my eyes,

1047
01:22:21,209 --> 01:22:24,293
and I'm supposed to just ignore it?

1048
01:22:24,334 --> 01:22:25,374
Let go of me, you bastard!

1049
01:22:54,459 --> 01:22:58,793
Pardon me sir, but I'm
with Tae-hun on this.

1050
01:22:58,918 --> 01:23:02,793
We should do whatever
it takes to bring him home.

1051
01:23:03,293 --> 01:23:08,376
If you were me,
what'd you do in this situation?

1052
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:13,751
Give us the order, let us retrieve our man.

1053
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:21,293
You're dismissed.

1054
01:23:32,168 --> 01:23:33,543
Get me Ministry of Defense.

1055
01:23:41,918 --> 01:23:45,834
The President approved, can we succeed?

1056
01:23:45,959 --> 01:23:49,418
In all honesty, I cannot say.

1057
01:23:49,543 --> 01:23:51,126
But there's no contingency plan.

1058
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:54,626
The North may fire that nuke soon.

1059
01:23:54,751 --> 01:23:58,876
Deploying a battalion
will get their attention right away.

1060
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:04,293
We'll carry out the mission
with just <i>2</i> fighters

1061
01:24:04,418 --> 01:24:08,376
I will inform
the North officials of this mission.

1062
01:24:09,168 --> 01:24:11,834
For security reasons, do not update me.

1063
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:12,793
Yes sir.

1064
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:25,709
Please complete this mission
and come back alive.

1065
01:24:26,376 --> 01:24:27,793
That's an order.

1066
01:24:28,876 --> 01:24:30,001
Salute.

1067
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:35,626
You'll be in charge
of situation command in the air.

1068
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:39,959
A KAI-developed FA-50

1069
01:24:40,126 --> 01:24:41,166
is on the way to our base.

1070
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:45,668
It's a modified fighter
for low-altitude flight.

1071
01:24:45,793 --> 01:24:49,501
Does that mean you want
Captain Jung on this?

1072
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:52,251
You two are the best
fighter pilots we have.

1073
01:24:52,376 --> 01:24:56,418
This mission will only succeed
if you combine forces.

1074
01:24:57,293 --> 01:24:59,084
Who do you want as your co-pilot?

1075
01:24:59,293 --> 01:25:04,334
If possible, I'd like
Yu-jin to watch my back.

1076
01:25:17,293 --> 01:25:18,584
Let's go.

1077
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:28,709
It's 0400 hours,

1078
01:25:29,209 --> 01:25:36,918
exactly <i>2</i> hours from now,
we'll execute a rescue mission.

1079
01:25:37,043 --> 01:25:43,709
A fighter team will deploy first
and take out their defenses

1080
01:25:44,209 --> 01:25:46,251
I can't promise you anything.

1081
01:25:46,918 --> 01:25:50,918
But you must succeed at all costs

1082
01:25:52,376 --> 01:25:56,043
I believe in every one of you.

1083
01:25:56,376 --> 01:26:00,293
Attention! Salute the commander!

1084
01:26:00,418 --> 01:26:01,876
Salute!

1085
01:26:23,209 --> 01:26:25,168
There's no turning back.

1086
01:26:52,626 --> 01:26:53,959
How are you?

1087
01:26:56,584 --> 01:26:57,918
Promise me.

1088
01:27:00,918 --> 01:27:02,376
Come back alive.

1089
01:27:14,584 --> 01:27:16,043
Don't worry

1090
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:19,959
I Will.

1091
01:28:02,918 --> 01:28:04,459
Operation Return to Base.

1092
01:28:04,584 --> 01:28:09,084
The first half of this mission
is bombing the Wonsan airstrip

1093
01:28:09,209 --> 01:28:11,959
by <i>2</i> fighters prior to the rescue.

1094
01:28:12,126 --> 01:28:16,459
When meet with opposition,
the F-15K will engage

1095
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:21,418
and the FA-50 will fly low
and attack the missile silo

1096
01:28:21,543 --> 01:28:23,168
<i>7</i> minutes is all we have.

1097
01:28:23,293 --> 01:28:27,251
The attack must be carried
out within that time.

1098
01:28:28,668 --> 01:28:31,959
Tiger 0, Tiger 0, this is Eagle Alpha 1.

1099
01:28:32,126 --> 01:28:33,959
Current position, Whiskey Delta 4-9

1100
01:28:34,084 --> 01:28:36,918
I repeat, current position,
Whiskey Delta 4-9

1101
01:28:38,293 --> 01:28:40,418
I will command

1102
01:28:40,459 --> 01:28:42,084
from 737 Peace Eye Mobile Command.

1103
01:28:49,209 --> 01:28:50,501
This is 737 Peace Eye.

1104
01:28:51,126 --> 01:28:55,543
SAR's staging area is Echo 9-3.

1105
01:29:31,334 --> 01:29:32,626
Take-off complete.

1106
01:29:32,876 --> 01:29:33,918
Coordinate input complete.

1107
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,584
Formation from
the 21st Fighter Wing and Peace Eye

1108
01:29:45,709 --> 01:29:47,030
are already heading to the North.

1109
01:29:47,043 --> 01:29:48,293
Report to the commander.

1110
01:29:48,334 --> 01:29:49,626
Yes sir, roger that.

1111
01:29:52,084 --> 01:29:54,418
Anti-air radar jammer on.

1112
01:30:01,126 --> 01:30:02,418
Minister Kim!

1113
01:30:03,043 --> 01:30:04,918
What in the world do you
think you are doing?

1114
01:30:05,126 --> 01:30:07,209
I'll take full responsibility.

1115
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:09,043
Let us carry out this mission.

1116
01:30:09,334 --> 01:30:11,543
You cannot make this decision!

1117
01:30:11,626 --> 01:30:16,126
No, this is my country's affair, not yours

1118
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:17,584
21st Fighter Wing.

1119
01:30:17,709 --> 01:30:20,251
This is the ROK-US Combined Forces Command.

1120
01:30:20,376 --> 01:30:22,668
Withdraw all orders.

1121
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:24,959
This attack is given without permission

1122
01:30:25,668 --> 01:30:26,418
I repeat...

1123
01:30:26,584 --> 01:30:28,334
- Disconnect communication.
- Disconnecting.

1124
01:30:29,668 --> 01:30:31,793
We now take orders from 737 Mobile Command.

1125
01:30:32,209 --> 01:30:35,793
- Frequency is X-ray 5-1
- X-ray 5-1

1126
01:30:35,959 --> 01:30:38,293
Roger, X-ray 5-1.

1127
01:30:41,959 --> 01:30:43,584
Sir, they...

1128
01:30:43,668 --> 01:30:44,668
Disconnected.

1129
01:30:47,626 --> 01:30:50,793
The North will allow
safe passage across the border.

1130
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:54,709
Patch me in

1131
01:30:55,126 --> 01:30:59,709
Alpha Bravo R-0, R-0-1, mission launch in 3

1132
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:02,084
Roger, 3 minutes to mission launch.

1133
01:31:02,293 --> 01:31:06,501
The North will not fire
anti-air until the Wonsan base.

1134
01:31:06,626 --> 01:31:11,251
SAR team on stand by and fighters are a go.

1135
01:31:11,376 --> 01:31:13,501
Black Night 0-1 this is the No-Fox-6.

1136
01:31:13,626 --> 01:31:15,168
Cease operation blackout

1137
01:31:15,293 --> 01:31:17,501
and remain in preliminary attack position.

1138
01:31:17,626 --> 01:31:20,126
The White Tiger will engage Red Fox.

1139
01:31:20,251 --> 01:31:22,751
Approaching target, go under the radar.

1140
01:31:22,876 --> 01:31:25,668
Watch out for the AA turrets

1141
01:31:25,793 --> 01:31:26,501
Roger.

1142
01:31:26,959 --> 01:31:28,793
- One-in hot.
- Two-in hot.

1143
01:31:37,209 --> 01:31:38,709

01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,668
SAM homing in.

1145
01:31:48,793 --> 01:31:49,751
Flare, flare!

1147
01:32:00,668 --> 01:32:01,918

Missile ready to fire.

1149
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:05,709
Ready.

1150
01:32:06,793 --> 01:32:07,584
Fire.

1151
01:32:13,376 --> 01:32:15,376
- One splash.
- Two splash.

1152
01:33:05,084 --> 01:33:08,084
Airstrip taken out, send in SAR team.

1153
01:33:11,418 --> 01:33:13,084
Package located, roger.

1154
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:31,084
Can you hear me? Open your eyes.

1155
01:34:31,793 --> 01:34:33,876
Lieutenant Ji, wake up!

1156
01:34:43,168 --> 01:34:45,751
This is Hurricane Hawk, rescue complete.

1157
01:34:49,918 --> 01:34:52,709
Package secured, ready for last mission.

1158
01:34:52,834 --> 01:34:54,126
- Roger.
- Roger that.

1159
01:34:54,459 --> 01:34:56,959
Spike 2-7-0, bogey at 9 o'clock.

1160
01:35:01,834 --> 01:35:03,958
Golden Eagle, get to the silo,

1161
01:35:03,959 --> 01:35:05,251
the bogey's mine

1162
01:35:05,376 --> 01:35:06,209
Roger.

1163
01:35:11,543 --> 01:35:12,793
Missiles head on.

1164
01:35:35,709 --> 01:35:37,793
He's mine.

1165
01:35:55,793 --> 01:35:57,876
- Speed brake.
- Deploying!

1166
01:35:59,334 --> 01:36:00,251
Fire.

1167
01:36:08,126 --> 01:36:09,084
Yu-jin.

1168
01:36:13,668 --> 01:36:14,459
Good bye.

1169
01:36:26,501 --> 01:36:29,001
Reached target position, starting assault.

1170
01:36:29,126 --> 01:36:33,209
Golden Eagle, watch out
for AA turrets at Wonsan base

1171
01:36:33,584 --> 01:36:35,918
I repeat, AA turrets at the base.

1172
01:36:37,293 --> 01:36:38,293
SAM at 5.

1173
01:36:51,209 --> 01:36:52,168
More missiles.

1174
01:36:52,584 --> 01:36:53,834
Heat-seeking SAMs on me.

1175
01:36:55,584 --> 01:36:56,918
Flare, flare.

1176
01:37:02,126 --> 01:37:05,126
ICBM fueling complete and ready to launch.

1177
01:37:08,043 --> 01:37:09,209
Launch.

1178
01:37:17,501 --> 01:37:18,793
One missile left.

1179
01:37:18,918 --> 01:37:20,376
Impossible to reach target.

1180
01:37:26,918 --> 01:37:28,158
There's no time! Get rid of it!

1181
01:37:29,084 --> 01:37:30,459
Your priority is the missile silo.

1182
01:37:30,584 --> 01:37:32,459
We can avoid a nuclear attack

1183
01:37:32,584 --> 01:37:34,668
if you take out the ICBM

1184
01:37:34,876 --> 01:37:36,876
Roger, going in.

1185
01:37:39,626 --> 01:37:41,001
No visual on target.

1186
01:37:42,918 --> 01:37:43,709
Can't get close.

1187
01:37:46,834 --> 01:37:47,751
Wing's hit.

1188
01:37:52,043 --> 01:37:53,084
Target confirmed.

1189
01:38:01,293 --> 01:38:02,418
Target intact.

1190
01:38:13,334 --> 01:38:14,793
Gotta get rid of the missile first

1191
01:38:15,084 --> 01:38:17,918
I can evade it by shutting off the engine.

1192
01:38:18,209 --> 01:38:19,126
Zero-knot!

1193
01:38:25,626 --> 01:38:26,543
Engine off.

1194
01:39:10,209 --> 01:39:13,251
Mission accomplished, returning to base.

1195
01:39:38,626 --> 01:39:40,168
Shit, missile still on my 6,

1196
01:39:40,376 --> 01:39:42,168
I can't shake it.

1197
01:39:42,418 --> 01:39:44,751
Buy some time, I'm on my way!

1198
01:39:52,626 --> 01:39:54,001
Tae-hun, release flares!

1199
01:39:55,001 --> 01:39:56,459
Please!

1200
01:40:18,084 --> 01:40:19,293
Golden Eagle going down.

1201
01:40:23,793 --> 01:40:25,376
Jung Tae-hun!

1202
01:40:25,501 --> 01:40:28,418
Losing pressure, oxygen level low.

1203
01:40:33,501 --> 01:40:35,751
Tae-hun, activate RLS!

1204
01:40:36,834 --> 01:40:38,668
You have to eject now!

1205
01:40:40,126 --> 01:40:41,584
Jung Tae-hun!

1206
01:40:42,043 --> 01:40:43,501
Snap out of it!

1207
01:40:45,168 --> 01:40:48,168
Tae-hun, please!

1208
01:40:55,459 --> 01:40:57,751
- I can't see him.
- Tae-hun.

1209
01:41:03,126 --> 01:41:05,043
Tae-hun!

1210
01:41:40,501 --> 01:41:43,251
Golden Eagle signal lost

1211
01:41:49,959 --> 01:41:51,251
I'm at crash site.

1212
01:41:51,876 --> 01:41:56,959
Position Charlie Delta 2-6-5-0.

1213
01:41:57,793 --> 01:42:05,001
Requesting SAR... Requesting SAR...

1214
01:42:26,876 --> 01:42:27,751
Salute.

1215
01:42:30,668 --> 01:42:33,584
- Good work.
- And Captain Jung?

1216
01:42:37,459 --> 01:42:40,418
The SAR team is looking

1217
01:43:28,126 --> 01:43:30,918
I got a signal. Respond, respond!

1218
01:43:37,209 --> 01:43:37,834
Sergeant Yu!

1219
01:45:11,959 --> 01:45:13,418
Tae-hun!

1220
01:45:15,418 --> 01:45:16,876
I'm sorry sir.

1221
01:45:18,043 --> 01:45:19,209
Step aside.

1222
01:45:27,168 --> 01:45:28,918
Jung Tae-hun.

1223
01:45:39,543 --> 01:45:40,959
You had me worried.

1224
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:43,959
Tae-hun.

1225
01:45:47,126 --> 01:45:48,126
Salute.

1226
01:45:50,751 --> 01:45:51,709
Salute.

1227
01:46:02,918 --> 01:46:04,584
Thank you for coming home alive.

1228
01:46:46,418 --> 01:46:49,459
Air Force Major Park Dae-seo.

1229
01:47:17,543 --> 01:47:18,626
Come in.

1230
01:47:27,293 --> 01:47:28,751
Salute!

1231
01:47:28,918 --> 01:47:30,376
I have a request, sir.

1232
01:47:31,501 --> 01:47:32,209
What is it?

1233
01:47:32,334 --> 01:47:36,751
I'd like to claim the prize
for winning the Hawk Competition.

1234
01:47:39,168 --> 01:47:40,084
Which is?

1235
01:47:40,126 --> 01:47:43,126
Please allow me
to fly Sergeant Yu in the fighter.

1236
01:47:44,418 --> 01:47:48,251
But you'll do that regardless.

1237
01:47:48,376 --> 01:47:50,459
No sir!

1238
01:47:50,501 --> 01:47:51,709
A soldier lives and dies by his orders,

1239
01:47:51,751 --> 01:47:52,459
SO...

1240
01:47:54,043 --> 01:47:56,709
please grant it before I disobey.

1241
01:47:57,501 --> 01:47:58,834
Why you...

1242
01:48:00,793 --> 01:48:04,459
I got a request to re-assign you
to the Black Eagles.

1243
01:48:04,584 --> 01:48:06,751
- I just signed it.
- What?!

1244
01:48:07,959 --> 01:48:09,376
Please deny the request.

1245
01:48:09,501 --> 01:48:14,793
My honor and pride are
with the 21st Fighter Wing!

1246
01:48:20,959 --> 01:48:24,126
How can I not grant your wish then?

1247
01:48:25,293 --> 01:48:28,793
- Okay!
- Thank you sir!

1248
01:48:32,876 --> 01:48:34,751
His salute's snappy

1249
01:48:50,251 --> 01:48:53,834
I'm your pilot for the day.

1250
01:48:54,293 --> 01:48:58,709
We'll now begin a special flight
for our lovely Se-yeong.

1251
01:49:01,293 --> 01:49:05,043
Reaching altitude of 7,200 feet.

1252
01:49:05,918 --> 01:49:08,418
Beautiful weather.

1253
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:12,209
- Wanna see something cool?
- What's that?

1254
01:49:18,376 --> 01:49:20,334
Awesome.

1255
01:49:20,668 --> 01:49:24,418
- Yup, I'm awesome.
- No, I meant the sky.

1256
01:49:24,543 --> 01:49:26,251
You're no fun

1257
01:49:26,376 --> 01:49:27,334
Alpha 2,

1258
01:49:27,376 --> 01:49:30,251
no dangerous maneuvers
with a civilian on board.

1259
01:49:30,543 --> 01:49:34,709
Don't do anything inappropriate
in the cockpit, Tae-hun.

1260
01:49:34,876 --> 01:49:37,584
Can't you see we're on a date?

1261
01:49:37,709 --> 01:49:38,709
Hold on tight.

1262
01:49:41,918 --> 01:49:44,126
- Pursuing Alpha <i>2</i>.
- Yes, sir!

1263
01:49:49,584 --> 01:49:52,626
How far will you follow us?

1264
01:49:52,834 --> 01:49:55,751
As your wingman, all the way.

1265
01:49:55,876 --> 01:49:58,418
- What?
- All the way.

1266
01:49:58,543 --> 01:50:00,501
You're a headache.

1267
01:50:00,834 --> 01:50:02,334
Couldn't you let us alone?

1268
01:50:02,459 --> 01:50:04,751
- No can do.
- Roger.

1269
01:50:17,418 --> 01:50:19,501
Sergeant Yu, I was thinking...

1270
01:50:19,626 --> 01:50:22,418
No unnecessary chatter,
keep your eyes on the sky.

1271
01:50:22,543 --> 01:50:24,876
Don't force me to eject you.

1272
01:50:24,959 --> 01:50:29,168
What's with you? I flew
out of hell to get here.

1273
01:50:29,251 --> 01:50:32,168
Then why did you get hit?

1274
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:33,376
You lost an expensive jet.

1275
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:37,084
Things happen in battle.
You're making me feel bad.

1276
01:50:37,209 --> 01:50:40,209
- Are you hurt?
- Yes I am.

1277
01:50:40,626 --> 01:50:44,251
- That really stings.
- A kiss once we land.

1278
01:50:44,334 --> 01:50:48,293
All healed!
