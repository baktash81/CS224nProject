not much anymore.

you're one of those

00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,823
It's okay though.

49
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,993
I have a problem

52
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,402
- Right.

53
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,674
- So you remind me of somebody.

54
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,511
I can't place it though.

55
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,846
Who do you get?

56
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,481
- Who do I get?

57
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,384
- Who do people
say you look like?

58
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,189
- Um, I get Prince a lot.

59
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,258
- Ha, yeah, that's it.

60
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,729
Except you're a
little bit taller.

61
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,164
Maybe a little less
- Black?

62
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,166
- Exactly.

63
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,702
Can you sing?

64
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,676
That must be it then, Prince.

65
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,852
Brennan, I've had a long day.

66
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,689
Do you want to get out of here?

67
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,625
- Um, yeah, sure.

68
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,863
- Cool.

69
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,431
Hey, before we go,

70
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,770
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

71
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,973
Two-fifty gets you a...

72
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,511
Five hundred and I'll...

73
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,985
And a thousand...

74
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:05,056
But I'll do it for nine
hundred because you're cute

75
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,559
and I want to sleep with you.

76
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,695
- You're a hooker.

77
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,801
- Where are your
manners, Brennan?

78
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,536
I'm an entrepreneur.

79
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,608
You don't look happy.

80
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,713
What would make you happy?

81
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,144
- I'd like to check out, please.

82
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,614
But my flight doesn't
leave til seven.

83
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:03,815
Can I check my bag in?

84
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,883
- Of course.

85
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,918
- This place reeks.

86
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,888
- Smells like air freshener.

87
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,890
- No, no, no, no,
no, not the hotel.

88
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:48,126
This whole town, it's
like a pipe dream

89
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,328
palace of desperation, you know?

90
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,030
Oh my god, did you
just hear what I said?

91
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,899
Pipe dream palace
of desperation.

92
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,635
Now that is a song, that
is what he should be doing.

93
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,336
Oh god, look at him.

94
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,138
Can you imagine being him?

95
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,373
- Yeah.

96
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,042
- No, no, no, that is,
that is not for me.

97
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,610
Or you, I mean look at us,

98
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,847
we're flying first
class tonight, yes.

99
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,784
Oh by the way, I am very sorry

100
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,586
about that proposal yesterday.

101
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,087
I thought it was gonna go.

102
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,689
- You voted against it.

103
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,992
- Well, yeah, who would have
thought one vote would matter?

104
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,729
No, no, no, you know,
there'll be another one.

105
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,965
- I don't really care about it.

106
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,833
Well now, see,
that's the spirit.

107
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,735
Yes, exactly, right?

108
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,304
I mean you'll come up
with something better.

109
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,773
That is why you
are a VeroTech man.

110
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,041
- What?

111
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,509
- A VeroTech man.

112
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:42,747
I mean, listen, it's got a
great ring to it, VeroTech man.

113
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,949
Come on, say it with me, say,

114
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,684

115
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,556
Wait, where are you going?

116
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,925
Hey, you wanna hang
before the flight tonight?

117
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,927
Grab a...

118
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,965
- You're acting stupid,
like a little girl.

119
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,600
- What?

120
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,103
- Speak, Nora, use
your big kid mouth

121
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,904
and tell me what
- You understand that?

122
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,773
Does this speak to you?

123
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,807
- Stop it!

124
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,075
- You lied to me!

125
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,810
You told me you were
done, you're not.

126
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,078
So we are.

127
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,813
- We're on vacation.

128
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,250
I'm not gonna chase you.

129
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,857
Why do you play these
stupid little games?

130
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,291
I swear to god,

131
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,227
I'm gonna go back to the hotel,

132
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,828
I'm gonna pack up my
shit, and that is that.

133
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,830
- So go.

134
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,168

what the hell are you
doing in Nashville?

161
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:31,376

00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,677
What about you?

163
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:39,217
- I had a weekend getaway
that also didn't go so well.

- Sorry.

165
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,190

- Yeah.

171
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,471
- Appearance, I
mean, appearance.

172
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,842
I can't believe how
short your hair is.

173
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,411

- Yeah, it is.

179
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,262
So when are you going back
- Grab a drink with me.

00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,697
- What?

181
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,533
- Don't think of an
excuse or a way out, just,

182
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,134
grab a drink with me.

183
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,472
- Yeah.

184
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,506
- Yeah?

185
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,341
- Yeah, sure.

186
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,343
- Really?

187
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:39,812
Okay.

188
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,284
- Okay.

189
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,040
- You sure you have time?

190
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,808
- You having second thoughts?

191
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,979
- No, I was just, I
didn't want to keep you

192
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,447
if you were meeting someone.

193
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,783
- No, no, I've got
nowhere to be, you?

194
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,351
- I'm pretty free.

195
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,826
Last time we saw each other.

196
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,361
- Your nephew was
getting baptized.

197
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,529
- That's right.

198
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,698
You were leaving
Seattle for Colorado.

199
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,233
- And I missed my flight,

200
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,868
so I ended up spending my last
day with you and your family,

201
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,370
even though we both
knew it was over.

202
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,606
- But we stood there together
pretending it wasn't.

203
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,641
- Yeah, that wasn't
uncomfortable at all.

204
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,076
- Not at all.

205
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,078
- No.

206
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,882
- I've seen your Facebook.

207
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,216
- We're not friends.

208
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,218
- We'll always be friends.

209
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,755
But you were right, on
Facebook, we are not friends.

210
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,590
- So how did you see?

211
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,694
- Well, your page isn't
completely private.

212
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:07,098
So I can see assorted
pictures you've posted.

213
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,533
- That's creepy.

214
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,535
- It's a little creepy.

215
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:16,574
But you haven't posted in
a while, not since this.

216
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,843
But I gather you're not married
or you don't have any kids,

217
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,845
or if you do, you're
embarrassed by them,

218
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,780
so you don't post any pictures.

219
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,049
- They're just really ugly.

220
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,884
- You should see mine.

221
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,753
They're in the car
waiting for me.

222
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,222
It's okay, I left it running.

223
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,232
- You still in Seattle?

224
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,234
- Mmhmm.

225
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,337
Remember when you lived there?

226
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,538
- How could I forget?

227
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,741
- And you had that
ceramic garden gnome?

228
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:50,575
- Norman.

229
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,443
- Norman, yes!

230
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,079
Oh, he was horrifying
with those red eyes

231
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,348
and that geriatric smile.

232
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,883
- I used to put him
in the refrigerator.

233
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,486
- Yes, I would go for a beer
and find this fucking gnome

234
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,787
waiting for me.

235
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,159
- How come you never called?

236
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,196
- What would I have said?

237
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,599
- I don't know, any of this?

238
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,136
- Hmm, I don't know,
maybe for the same reason

239
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,139
you didn't show up to
my sister's wedding.

240
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:25,009
- You guys should feel
these for a couple days.

241
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,077
- Thank you.

242
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,114
You don't have any
place to be, right?

243
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,052
- Right.
- Right.

244
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,591
- Whew.

245
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,300
- What's your favorite memory?

246
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,504
- What, favorite
memory of all time?

247
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,506
- Of us.

248
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,744
- Uh, wow.

249
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,383
Okay, I came to your apartment

250
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,418
because we were going to dinner,

251
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,689
and you had made up this lame
excuse about no reservations

252
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,558
and that you were flustered,

253
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,327
and then I went into your
room to grab your coat

254
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,230
and you had rose
petals scattered,

255
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,934
and candles burning, and this

256
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,204
Italian meal that
you said you cooked.

257
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,473
- It was Olive Garden.

258
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,475
- I know.

259
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,143
- Yeah.

260
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,311
That was the moment when I knew

261
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:37,148
I could never live
without you in my life.

262
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,216
- But you did.

263
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,517
- No, I didn't.

264
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:41,819
You were always
there like a ghost,

265
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,889
haunting any
relationship after you.

266
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,100
- Your turn.

267
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,575
- We were working at the
bar, it was almost Christmas,

268
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,478
I think we'd been seeing
each other for about a month.

269
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,148
And you'd just gotten off
and left the building.

270
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,216
- It was so cold that day.

271
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,685
- And I watched you walk
across the parking lot,

272
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,654
toward your minivan.

273
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,890
- I hated that car.

274
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,226
- I still had people in my
section, but I didn't care,

275
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,794
I had to do something.

276
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,165
- So you ran outside,
took off your hat.

277
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,332
- I grabbed you.

278
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,668
- And you kissed me.

279
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,804
- I told you merry Christmas.

280
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:38,042
- And then you turned
around and just walked away.

281
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,547
I didn't breathe for minutes.

282
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,782
- I'm glad you didn't die.

283
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:45,784
- Me too!

284
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,387

360
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,620
- Oh, hey.

361
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:58,156
- Hey.

362
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,928
- I'm not having a beer
because I'm an alcoholic,

363
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,265
I'm having a beer
to feel better.

364
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,399
It has fruit.

365
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:24,248
- So you leave Monday?

366
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,716
- I leave Monday.

367
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:30,287
- You don't have
any plans, or...

368
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:35,792
- What about you, your
conference is done.

369
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,295
What are you still doing here?

370
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:42,366
- I thought I'd stay for
the weekend, see the sights.

371
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:45,435
- Why'd you check
out of your hotel?

372
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,940
- They put us up in a real dive.

373
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,875
I'll find a new one later.

374
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:55,012
- Don't be stupid,
you can stay in mine.

375
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,647
- Or I could do that.

376
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:57,781
- Close your eyes.

377
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,449
- How would I see?

378
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,785
- Use that noggin of yours.

379
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:05,923
- All right.

380
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,492
- Remember when you were a kid?

381
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,894
- Yeah, I think I was there.

382
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:13,397
- Picture it.

383
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:20,704
Remember the first time
you went to the ocean.

384
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,573
Your loss of virginity.

385
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,614
First thing you regretted.

386
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,084
Your first heartbreak.

387
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,220
Open your eyes.

388
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,690
What color did you see?

389
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:40,924
- What color?

390
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:43,226
- Yeah, sometimes your
dreams and memories

391
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,363
associate to a particular color.

392
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:47,731
- Blue.

393
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:48,665
- Blue?

394
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:49,766
- Mhm.

395
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,368
- Interesting.

396
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,070
- What's it mean?

397
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:57,674
- Well, sometimes, blue can
typically be associated with

398
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,810
loyalty, truth, wisdom...

399
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,148
- Hey.

400
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:09,019
- Openness, heaven,
and tranquility.

401
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,058
- Your turn.

402
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,127
- Nope, I am the
psychoanalyzer here.

403
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:18,795
- Close your eyes.

404
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,030
- Then how would I see?

405
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,198
- Just do it.

406
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,671
- Remember your first crush.

407
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
First kiss.

408
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:35,712
First time you were
alone and scared.

409
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:38,515
Remember prom and cigarettes.

410
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,916
Cats, the salon.

411
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:46,656
Your nephew, first time you
got flowers, disappointment.

412
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:51,962
Remember the last time
you played the piano.

413
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:55,399
The first time I held your hand.

414
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,134
The drinking contest.

415
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,536
The air mattress.

416
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:04,041
Right now, and the future.

417
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,047
What did you see?

418
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,587

- Yeah.
- You sure?

426
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,724
- I think so.

427
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:55,726
- Okay.

428
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,362
Do you want to...

429
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,402
Share some mozzarella
sticks with me?

430
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,104
- You asshole,

431
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,239
I thought you were gonna
say something important.

432
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:12,175
- Are you implying
fried cheese is not?

433
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:14,077
- I do like fried cheese.

434
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,546
- Mhm, but you wanted
something more like politics.

435
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:17,548
- Exactly.

436
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,985
So who did you vote for in the
last presidential election?

437
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,386
- Um, Voldemort.

438
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,690
He was a little bit darker,

439
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:29,759
but I liked that his running
mate was a human-eating snake.

440
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,329
- Oh, interesting, kind of dark.

441
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,131
- You two look like
you're having fun.

442
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:38,368
- Oh, well, mostly he's being
stupid, but it's amusing.

443
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,470
- Really, and how
are the drinks?

444
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,206
- They are real good, thank you.

445
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:46,610
- Okay, that was creepy.

446
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:48,912
Wasn't that creepy?

447
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:50,747
Real good, thank you.

448
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,084
- Sorry I was being
appreciative of your services.

449
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:56,153
- Maybe I can take you
back to my room later

450
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:57,988
and thank you some more.

451
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,890
- I don't sound
like Darth Vader.

452
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,825
- Yeah, you know
what, you kind of do.

453
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,059
- Yes, you do.

454
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,465
- All right, so, I'm guessing
a couple more vodka Red Bulls?

455
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,433
- Yeah, I think I need one now.

456
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,501
- Thank you.

457
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,071
I like her.

458
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,074
You know what we should do?

459
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,211
- Does it involve going
back to your motel room?

460
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,680
- No, we should write a poem.

461
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,748
- Or we should write a poem.

462
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,982
- To Jessie.

463
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,983
- You want to write a
poem to the waitress

464
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,818
we just met?
- Yes, I do.

465
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,187
- Okay.

466
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:31,922
What do you wanna say?

467
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:33,990
- Dear Jessie, thank you

468
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,460
for our vodka Red Bull.

469
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,464
- Nora thinks that
you're so cool.

470
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:45,402
- I'm sorry Brennan
was so creepy.

471
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:49,239
We are too wound
up to be sleepy.

472
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:54,244
- We still are going back
to your room, aren't we?

473
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,513
- You're our new favorite girl.

474
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:57,581
- You're my new favorite girl.

475
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,649
- I'm not new, I'm worn.

476
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,757
- I can move back to Seattle.

477
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:11,995
- You live in Colorado.

478
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:16,366
- I can move to Seattle and
fly to Colorado for work.

479
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,235
Unless you wanted to move to
Colorado for a couple years,

480
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,869
but I think you'd hate it there.

481
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,606
Leaving your sister and parents?

482
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,442
We could make it work.

483
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,679
I could make it work.

484
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:36,019
- Maybe we could just
stay in Nashville.

485
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:39,756
You can sing again and
I can play the piano.

486
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,937
Where are those drinks?

487
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,340
- Can I take you somewhere?

488
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,308
- You already have.

489
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,310
- Come on.

490
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:57,735
Come on.

491
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,443
- What are we doing?

492
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,579
What is this place?

493
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,157
- Still remember?

494
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,393
- Brennan, no I don't want to
- Hey, come on, come on.

495
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,694
You're so good.

496
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,664
- Your memory is of a
girl seven years ago

497
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,032
that's not still me.

498
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,367
- Hey, I think it is.

499
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,801
- You're the musician
who is now working

500
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,436
some bullshit nine to five job,

501
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:36,706
I should be pushing you
onto a stage somewhere.

502
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,075
- Just, give it a try.

503
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,243
- This is embarrassing.

504
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,711
- It is not, come on.

505
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,281
- Then you do it.

506
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,183
- I would if I knew
what the hell to do.

507
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:51,121
- You press your fingers
down until it sounds right.

508
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,390
- Oh, sounds easy enough.

509
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,691
Give it a shot.

510
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,061
- No.

511
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:59,629
I don't want to.

512
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,631
- Please.

513
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,166
Please, for me.

514
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:05,536
No?

515
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:08,339
Please, hm?

516
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,515
- Fine, but I'm gonna
murder your ear drums.

517
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,419
- I'm willing to take the risk.

518
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:25,822
- Hmmph.

519
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:26,824
- Hmmph.

520
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:35,198
- What do you want to hear?

521
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,168
- I don't know,
something cheerful.

522
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,906
Or suitably depressing,
your choice.

523
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:46,543
- Prepare yourself
for disappointment.

524
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:47,710
- Oh, I have.

525
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:56,052
- I don't remember
when I wrote this, but,

526
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,987
I called it Hindenburg.

527
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,424
- After the airship?

528
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:02,725

00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,676
- And how do I smoke?

584
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:29,579

585
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:37,753

586
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,090

- I'm Roy.

588
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:45,428
- Nora.

589
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,830
- Nice to meet you, Nora.

590
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:48,832
- You too.

591
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,918
Anyways, I'm gonna go.

592
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,987
- Well here, keep these.

593
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:15,658
Remnants of a smoke

594
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:18,594

595
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:19,662
- Thank you.

596
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:23,232
- And they called
him something like Conrad,

597
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:27,303
so he's either gonna be a
rockstar or a mathematician.

598
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:29,138
Hey, if we had a kid,

599
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:32,575
what would we name him?

600
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,710
- I don't like this game.

601
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,680
- I was just messing around.

602
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:38,682
- I know.

603
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:41,350
- Are you okay?

604
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:42,418
- Yeah, why?

605
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,321
- No reason.

606
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:52,094
- What do you hate about me?

607
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,362
- What do I hate about you?

608
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,698
- What do you hate about me?

609
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,166
- Nothing.

610
00:48:57,168 --> 00:49:00,469
- We broke up once, you've
hated me more than once, why?

611
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,171
- I don't know.

612
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:04,440
- I smoke, you hate cigarettes.

613
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,908
- Yeah, I do.

614
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,410
- That's one thing.

615
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:08,878
- There's a whole list of
things I love about you.

616
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,880
- Pfff.

617
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:16,485
I kissed that guy on my
23rd birthday and you saw.

618
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:18,955
- Yeah, it was a long time ago.

619
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,290
What are you doing, Nora?

620
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,859
- I don't know what I'm doing.

621
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:28,631
- Do we really need more drinks?

622
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,866
- Should I just order one?

623
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,436
- No, no, it's fine.

624
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:34,837
- Great, thanks.

625
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,713
I've been with someone
for a long time.

626
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:44,715
- I know.

627
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,650
Facebook.

628
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:50,686
- How'd you feel?

629
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:56,892
- How did I feel knowing
that you were with him?

630
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:58,361
- I guess.

631
00:49:58,363 --> 00:50:00,496
- I don't know.

632
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,998
- You don't know?

633
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:04,967
When it comes to emotions,
I think you always know

634
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,802
exactly how you feel.

635
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:13,709
- I guess I wondered
what it felt like.

636
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,044
- What?

637
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:17,713
- To be with you for that long.

638
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,251
- He said it was like
driving in oncoming traffic.

639
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:25,821
Each night you don't
know how you survive.

640
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,426
- I guess one day he
didn't get so lucky.

641
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,228
- He lied to me.

642
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,629
- Somebody else?

643
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:36,365
- No, with pills.

644
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,836
- But you never?
- No, are you kidding?

645
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,472
No, and I didn't think
that he would have, either.

646
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:46,709
But, yeah, looking
back it made sense.

647
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:53,249
- I would not do drugs
behind your back.

648
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,419
I wouldn't.

649
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:58,087
I wouldn't lie to you either.

650
00:50:58,089 --> 00:50:59,321
- Really?
- Uh huh.

651
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:02,158
- Oh, well then you
would be a robot.

652
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,661
Everybody lies, everybody
does fucked up stuff.

653
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:09,832
It just comes down to the
intentions behind them.

- I don't.

707
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,861
- The guy you were talking to.

708
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:42,931
- Did I fuck a guy five
minutes after talking to him

709
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:44,366
at the bar?

710
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:46,935
- It wouldn't be your first
bathroom this weekend.

711
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:49,571
- Is that what you think of me?

712
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:56,979
You know, and then not answering
doesn't make it better.

713
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,213
- You know what
I hate about you?

714
00:56:58,215 --> 00:56:59,014
- What, that you
think I'm a whore?

715
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,482
- That I love you!

716
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,185
- You haven't seen me in seven
years, you don't know me.

717
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:05,921
- I know how destroyed
I was the last time,

718
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,390
and I hate, I hate
that I love you again.

719
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:09,925
- You're drunk.

720
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,662
- I hate knowing that if this
all ends, that you'll be fine.

721
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:17,332
You'll just go back home,
you'll walk into the old bar,

722
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:19,368
and you'll wake up with one of
those plaid-wearing dirtbags

723
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,402
leaning against the pool table,

724
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:21,970
he'll come up and buy a drink,

725
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,972
follow you back to your place,
you'll take off your pants,

726
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:26,708
but you're too insecure
to take off your top.

727
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,110
And I don't know
what hurts me more,

728
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:30,412
knowing that you'll
be thinking about me

729
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,214
or that you won't be.

730
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:40,322
Nora, wait.

731
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:41,523
- No, fuck that.

732
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:42,791
- Look, you're upset.

733
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,092
- Oh, yeah, you're
fucking observant.

734
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:46,895
- Let's just cool off.
- Fuck you!

735
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:50,652
- We should probably get up.

736
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:51,654
- Why?

737
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:56,925
- Because the
alarm is going off.

738
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,994
- I didn't set an alarm.

739
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,097
- It's noon.

740
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,439
- No, I just, I'm hungover.

741
01:00:12,176 --> 01:00:15,510
I've been hungover
for like a week now.

742
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:24,386
I don't really know
what to say about that.

743
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:31,761
Maybe...

744
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:36,398
Yeah, maybe, we'll see.

745
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:42,904
I better go, okay.

746
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,108
Yeah, you too, bye.

747
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:59,221
- I, uh, picked them myself,

748
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:02,057
well, I didn't pick
them, you know.

749
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:04,960
- Yeah, well,
they're interesting.

750
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:08,296
Oh, and a card.
- Yeah.

751
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,733
- Thank you.

752
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,201
- You're welcome.

753
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,460
- You sure you don't
want something?

754
01:02:11,462 --> 01:02:12,462
- Bleh, no.

755
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,930
I still feel queasy.

756
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:16,565
Looking at you
makes me feel sick.

757
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,066
- Hey.

758
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,801
- Not you, the food.

759
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:24,940
- Is that better?

760
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:27,175
- No, no, no don't eat me.

761
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,847
- Ah!

762
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:33,915
Gross, I don't eat meat.

763
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,356
I think I blacked
out last night,

764
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:43,658
but I remember us fighting.

765
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:48,897
- We weren't fighting,
we were arguing.

766
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:51,333
Disagreeing if you will.

767
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:52,335
- Oh.

768
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:54,871
Okay.

769
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,410
- So you leave tomorrow?

770
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:05,147
- I don't want to talk about it.

771
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:07,048
- It's our last night.

772
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,520
- So let's not waste it.

773
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:13,890
Come on.

774
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,400
Ha, come up here.

775
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:36,511
- I'll fall.

776
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:39,214
- Uh, I don't think
the crash'll hurt.

777
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:40,215
Come on.

778
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:41,550
- White flamingo?

779
01:03:41,552 --> 01:03:42,951
- It's all they had.

780
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:44,553
- You're trying to
murder my liver?

781
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:46,188
- How romantic is
dying together?

782
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,956
- It's not as romantic
as living together.

783
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:51,026
- Fine, I will be
your opening act.

784
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:54,329
- Whoa, did you just
ask me to move in?

785
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:58,500
- Yeah, yeah I did.

786
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:03,305
- Haha, I do not know how you
get me to do these things.

787
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:05,140
Okay, get me a ukelele.

788
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:07,976
- What, pull it
out of my pocket?

789
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,880

with multiple cats.

794
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:44,179
- Aren't you a bit young
to be a crazy cat lady?

795
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:45,447
- I have four.

796
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:46,948
You are not a cat
lady until eight.

797
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:49,584
- Oh really, because seven
seems a little creepy to me.

798
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:51,086

- Yeah, aw.

806
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:25,153
She's a little temperamental,
mostly schizo, but I love her.

807
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:26,955
Even though she smells.

808
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:28,623
- Bathing her doesn't help.

809
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:29,625
- Um, no.

810
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:36,865
- By the way,
that cat was an asshole.

811
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:42,504
Emory Blaine, 1931.

812
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:46,141
Beloved by his wife, Emily.

813
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:49,077
Beloved by his murderer, Emily,

814
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:50,612
who poisoned his
oatmeal one night

815
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:54,516
because she secretly feared
he was having an affair

816
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:57,852
with Katherine Johnson,
whom she also...

817
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,791
- Yeah, but he got her back.

818
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:06,628
- By haunting her
everyday for five years

819
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:10,532
until she went crazy and
jumped from a window.

820
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:12,601
- What?

821
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:19,174
Have some respect.

822
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:20,176
- Sorry.

823
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:31,686
- You know, sometimes I see
ghosts of ex-boyfriends.

824
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,190
I'll wake up, in the
middle of the night,

825
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:36,691
and they'll be standing
at the edge of my bed

826
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:39,194
in the shadows, watching me.

827
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:40,528
- They're not dead.

828
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:43,198
- No, but when I
finally do wake up,

829
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,967
I have to text
them to make sure.

830
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:47,268
- That's gotta be
an awkward text.

831
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,337
Hey, it's me, long time,

832
01:06:50,474 --> 01:06:52,240
by any chance did you die?

833
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:55,210
If so, did you
haunt me last night?

834
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:57,646
- Vodka.

835
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:05,587
Makes letting them go harder.

836
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:10,392
- I never got a text, so
I guess you never saw me.

837
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:11,993
- I did.

838
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:14,229
Two days ago in Nashville.

839
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,188
- Whatcha doing?

840
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,123
- Self-deprecating.

841
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,258
- About what?

842
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:27,696
- Being 30.

843
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:35,904
I'm drunk, in a house of
judgment and forgiveness,

844
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,207
so I thought I would
evaluate my life choices

845
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:41,409
as I approach 30.

846
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:43,144
- 30 is still young.

847
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:46,614
- Not if I want to have kids.

848
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:50,285
If I want three,
I gotta start now.

849
01:09:50,287 --> 01:09:52,854
- Oh, are you propositioning me?

850
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,589
- No, I was talking.

851
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:59,761
- I know, I was just kidding.

852
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:03,064
- Yeah, well you have
the freedom, as a guy,

853
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:04,699
to kid about that,
because truth be told

854
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:08,269
you can be 50, decide
you want a kid,

855
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:11,139
and knock up some young girl.

856
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:14,108
- Yeah, I'm sure
that's easy to do.

857
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:19,881
- I don't know why I'm
thinking about this.

858
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:21,616
The future is scary.

859
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:24,486
It's heavy.

860
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:30,825
You know, I'm the only one back
home who doesn't have a kid.

861
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:34,395
- Yeah, but you've got a job,
one that you actually enjoy.

862
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,965
In this economy that's
very impressive.

863
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:41,936
- Everyone thinks David and
I are gonna get married.

864
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:45,340
I get to go home and
destroy that image.

865
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,451
I'll figure it all out tomorrow.

866
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:58,152
- Tomorrow?

867
01:10:58,154 --> 01:11:00,788
- I'll fly home, quit drinking,

868
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,993
go to the gym, and
then make a plan.

869
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:13,001
- Don't you think it was fate
that we ran into each other?

870
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:17,706
- Yeah.

871
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:20,276
- So?

872
01:11:33,223 --> 01:11:34,223
- So.

873
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:37,859
- What about us?

874
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:42,597
- I'll fly into the rain and
you'll fly into the snow.

875
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:45,466
- It doesn't snow in July.

876
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,035
- I feel like it
always snows there.

877
01:11:47,037 --> 01:11:49,437
- What did you do to me?

878
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:50,305
- Nothing.

879
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:51,839
- Yeah, but everything.

880
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:53,308
Last time it took me a
year to get over you.

881
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:56,277
365 days with your face tattooed
on the back of my eyelids.

882
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:57,812
And all the time, my
brain going crazy,

883
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,614
wondering who you're
with, what you're doing,

884
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,115
whether you're happy.

885
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:04,752
- You do remember that you
broke up with me last time?

886
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:06,020
- You forced me to.

887
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:08,122
- Oh, yes, I put a
gun to your head,

888
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:11,526
and I said, Brennan,
please, please dump me.

889
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:13,628
- We were living on a lifeboat
that was slowly sinking.

890
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,063
If I didn't get off,
we were gonna drown.

891
01:12:15,065 --> 01:12:16,631
- I don't remember ever
going to the ocean.

892
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:18,399
- I was being metaphorical,
and we did go once.

893
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:20,568
- Brennan, let's not do this.

894
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,103
- What?

895
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:25,039
- Get all intense and shit.

896
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:26,574
Not now, not tonight.

897
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:29,577
I just want to live
in this moment.

898
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:32,847
- Don't sigh like that.

899
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,116
- When you get
scared, all right,

900
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:36,384
you think about the future

901
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:37,218
but you don't want
to talk about it,

902
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,419
that's a contradiction.

903
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:39,787
- You're not an
open book yourself.

904
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,089
You get scared, too.

905
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:42,357
Why?

906
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,559
Because the future is
fucking unpredictable

907
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:47,328
and it is scary as hell.

908
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:49,897
Yes, I'm complicated.

909
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:51,833
I'm fucked up, I'm screwed up.

910
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:55,336
But you walked away last
time because of this fear.

911
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:58,039
You got terrified and you
couldn't handle the pressure

912
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,241
because it was
too tough for you.

913
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:03,311
You quit singing because of it.

914
01:13:03,313 --> 01:13:05,780
Are you happy at your job?

915
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:07,815
Are you happy at your job?
- No.

916
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,884
- Do you want to be a singer?

917
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,185
- I don't know.

918
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:12,720
- Do you want to be a singer?
- I don't know.

919
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:13,855
- Do you want to be a singer?
- I don't know, I don't know.

920
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:15,056
- Do you want to be a singer?
- Yes!

921
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:18,025
- Then stop being a
fucking pussy, Brennan.

922
01:13:18,027 --> 01:13:19,927
Stop getting frightened
and work for what you want,

923
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:22,563
even if it's gonna be
fucking awful at times.

924
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,766
- Well, what about you?

925
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:26,834
- I'm figuring that out.

926
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:37,145
I don't want to do this,
I don't want to fight.

927
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:43,217
Just, can you enjoy me
like I want to enjoy you?

928
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:46,788
Let's just do that.

929
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:48,690
Okay?

930
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:54,595
- I guess we could go get drunk.

931
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,364
- We're good at that.

932
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:09,377
♪ Look away, look
away, look away now ♪

933
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:13,781
♪ Look away, look away now ♪

934
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:17,452
♪ Now, before it costs you ♪

935
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:21,956
- What do you want me to say?

936
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,992
I know what you want me to say.

937
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:27,662
I just wanna make out with you.

938
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:31,132
Eh, no, I don't like P.D.A.

939
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,300
- Since when?

940
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:36,037
- Since people were staring.

941
01:14:39,576 --> 01:14:41,375
- You look miserable.

942
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:06,634
- So, we've talked about what
we hate about each other.

943
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:08,469
Let's get into some more meat.

944
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:10,671
What is your biggest
flaw, Brennan?

945
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:11,506
- Biggest flaw?

946
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:12,974
You tell me.

947
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:15,810
- This is a moment of
interpersonal reflection.

948
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:16,812
Go.

949
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,081
- I'd say I have two.

950
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:21,582
The first is I
can't concentrate.

951
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:25,753
You give me scissors it looks
like I cut with my toes.

952
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:27,221
- And two?

953
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:31,058
- I'm obsessed with using
my cell phone at the urinal,

954
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:35,663
and it's had disastrous
results on several occasions.

955
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:39,000
- You're never taking
my phone anywhere.

956
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:43,638
- In my next life, I'm
coming back as a rockstar.

957
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,340
Perform on stage,
write tragic love songs

958
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:48,442
about all my fucked
up relationships,

959
01:15:48,444 --> 01:15:52,113
and have 16-year-old
kids recite in unison.

960
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:56,350
In your next life, who
are you coming back as?

961
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:57,652
The president?

962
01:15:57,654 --> 01:15:59,120
- Your boyfriend.

963
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:12,667
You turned quiet.

964
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:15,836
- It's been a long time

965
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:18,973
since anyone has
treated me like this.

966
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:27,982
- All right, fine.

967
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:37,124
Oh that's good, real good.

968
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:24,672
- What's it called?
- Oh.

969
01:17:24,674 --> 01:17:25,840
- Let me see.

970
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:27,908
- This is going to
be the greatest song

971
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:30,044
ever written on a napkin.

972
01:17:38,454 --> 01:17:41,389
- I need a, I need cigarettes.

973
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:42,523
- Oh, we can leave.

974
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:45,326
- No, I have a full drink.

975
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,961
- I think there's a
store on the next block.

976
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:49,430
- Thank you, Brennan.

977
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:50,965
- Okay.

978
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:51,967
- Okay.

979
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:06,948
- Thanks.

980
01:18:09,952 --> 01:18:14,188
- Hot damn, what a surprise
to find you still here.

981
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,591
- So you haven't left?

982
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:20,728
- No no no, I guess
Nashville has consumed us.

983
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:22,296
- What about your
first class flights?

984
01:18:22,298 --> 01:18:26,534
- I traded it in for an
economy tomorrow morning, yes.

985
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:31,205
Oh, she is sucking
the life out of me.

986
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,774
Yeah, I think I'm in love.

987
01:18:33,776 --> 01:18:35,076
Or I don't know,
what's that feeling

988
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:37,945
when your dick's always hard?

989
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:40,214
Anyway, what have
you been doing?

990
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,249
Drinking, getting lost.

991
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:45,319
- Yeah, yeah, what's her name?

992
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:46,321
- Nora.

993
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:49,924
- Nora, okay, now that
sounds like the name

994
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:53,094
of my grandmother's
girlfriend, Nora.

995
01:18:54,464 --> 01:18:56,163
Anyway, look, make sure
you are on an early flight

996
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:57,832
tomorrow morning okay,
we've got another proposal

997
01:18:57,834 --> 01:18:59,567
with Nisley at noon.

998
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:03,104
This here, is a VeroTech man.

999
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:09,777
- No, I, I don't think
I'll be doing that.

1000
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,880
Why?

1001
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:15,616
I don't think I'll
be doing that, Steve.

1002
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:19,036
- Ow.

1003
01:19:19,037 --> 01:19:20,520
Okay, but you're
gonna get in trouble.

1004
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:23,057
He's in trouble, yeah,
he'll be in trouble.

1005
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:26,627
Speaking of trouble,
la la la la la la la.

1006
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:47,414
- So you're upset
because I didn't leave?

1007
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,583
- I'm upset because you
came here and made a scene.

1008
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:51,719
Why didn't you just go
- Do you know how much

1009
01:19:51,721 --> 01:19:54,655
it costs to change a flight?

1010
01:19:54,657 --> 01:19:57,158
- Where have you been?

1011
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,960
- I've been letting
you cool off.

1012
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:02,296
Who do you keep looking at?

1013
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:03,764
- David.

1014
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:06,167
- No, no, stop, stop,
don't say anything stupid.

1015
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:08,569
- Anything stupid?
- Look, it's always the same.

1016
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:11,238
- Why don't you just go
- You disappear,

1017
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,706
you're alone, and
then we're fine.

1018
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:13,741
- It's not the same.

1019
01:20:13,743 --> 01:20:14,742
- Here's what's gonna happen.

1020
01:20:14,744 --> 01:20:15,709
We're gonna get on this plane,

1021
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:16,944
we're gonna go home together,

1022
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:19,847
and it'll be like this
weekend never happened.

1023
01:20:29,559 --> 01:20:31,058
Who's that?

1024
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,760
- I don't know.

1025
01:20:32,762 --> 01:20:34,929
Ow, let go of me, David.

1026
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:36,363
- Why are you talking
to me like this?

1027
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:38,132
- You're hurting me, David.
- You're hurting me.

1028
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:40,401
- Stop it!
- I said I'm sorry.

1029
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:43,437
- Just stop it, let go of me!

1030
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:45,940
- Are you okay?

1031
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:48,776
- Yeah, yeah yeah,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1032
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:52,514

I had an abortion.

1042

- What?

1043
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:19,033
- I don't know why I told
you that, in this moment,

1044
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:21,435
but I felt like I needed to.

1045
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:25,606
- When was it?

1046
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:32,780
- It was five years ago.

1047
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:35,749
We hadn't talked in a year.

1048
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:39,987
I think you were dating that
blonde with the funky name.

1049
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:47,594
I remember thinking that
I wish it was yours.

1050
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:52,900
We would've kept it.

1051
01:22:57,907 --> 01:22:59,807
It would've been five.

1052
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:08,682
You say that you love me.

1053
01:23:11,721 --> 01:23:13,854
I want you to love... me.

1054
01:23:17,026 --> 01:23:19,493
- I do.
- Don't say anything.

1055
01:23:21,897 --> 01:23:23,564
Just float with me.

1056
01:23:28,471 --> 01:23:29,471
- Yeah.

1057
01:23:31,374 --> 01:23:32,506
- I love you.

1058
01:24:11,614 --> 01:24:14,782
- Wait what, what are you doing?

1059
01:24:14,784 --> 01:24:16,583
- I want to remember.

1060
01:24:17,987 --> 01:24:19,953
- What, that cigarette?

1061
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:22,856
- This trip.

1062
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:25,726
This moment.

1063
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:28,962
I want to remember.

1064
01:24:32,134 --> 01:24:33,134
