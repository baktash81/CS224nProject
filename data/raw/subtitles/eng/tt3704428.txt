1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,083
<i>Oh, let our love survive</i>

2
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:14,253
<i>I'll dry the tears
from your eyes</i>

3
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:20,292
<i>let's don't let a good thing die</i>

4
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,838
<i>Snowman's coming</i>

5
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:42,706
<i>yes, he's coming</i>

6
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:47,513
<i>he'll take you by the hand</i>

7
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,250
<i>he'll say one, two, three</i>

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>And you will be...</i>

9
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:59,926
<i>In cotton candy land</i>

10
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,032
<i>For those of you
who are wondering,</i>

11
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:05,272
<i>who this fella here is,</i>

12
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:10,903
<i>I am the legendary
colonel Tom Parker.</i>

13
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,624
<i>Colonel Tom
Parker, legendary manager</i>

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,629
<i>of Elvis Presley, has been
rushed to valley hospital.</i>

15
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:34,227
<i>I am the man who
gave the world Elvis Presley.</i>

16
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:42,171
<i>Without me, there would be
no Elvis Presley.</i>

17
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:44,101
<i>And yet, there are some</i>

18
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,572
<i>who'd make me out
to be the villain</i>

19
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,348
<i>of this here story.</i>

20
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:09,029
<i>Colonel Tom
Parker was a liar, a cheat, a con man.</i>

21
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:12,503
<i>A shocking new book
accuses colonel Tom Parker</i>

22
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,132
<i>of massive fraud
and mis-management.</i>

23
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:21,674
Parker received as much
as 50% of Elvis' income.

24
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,548
<i>He worked Elvis like a mule,</i>

25
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:25,442
<i>to support his own
gambling addiction.</i>

26
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,331
<i>The court finds
that the compensation received</i>

27
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,289
<i>by colonel Parker was excessive,</i>

28
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:31,118
<i>and shocked the conscience
of the court.</i>

29
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:33,000
<i>Many believe
that colonel Tom Parker</i>

30
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:35,856
<i>was responsible for the death
of Elvis Presley.</i>

31
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:39,156
Now, you listen to me.

32
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,331
The only thing that matters
is that that man

33
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,832
gets up on that stage tonight.

34
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:41,625
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

35
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:49,732
<i>his truth is marching on</i>

36
00:03:53,867 --> 00:04:00,776
<i>his truth is marching on</i>

37
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:10,252
<i>Tom Parker killed him!</i>

38
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:13,452
No! That's not true.

39
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:30,608
No, no, I didn't kill him.

40
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,514
I made Elvis Presley.

41
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:41,648
<i>Nothing all those muckrakers
said in their books was true.</i>

42
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:44,249
Me and Elvis, we was partners.

43
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:50,288
It was Elvis the showman
and the colonel the snowman.

44
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,192
<i>This is the lying dutchman.</i>

45
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:55,458
<i>I always knew I was
destined for greatness.</i>

46
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,329
<i>As an orphan,
I ran away to the carnival,</i>

47
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,368
<i>where I learned the art
of the "snow job,"</i>

48
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:04,576
<i>of emptying a rube's wallet
while leaving them with nothing</i>

49
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:07,205
<i>but a smile on their face.</i>

50
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,048
<i>But a carnival act
that would get you</i>

51
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,749
<i>the most money, the most snow,</i>

52
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:15,319
<i>had great costumes
and a unique trick,</i>

53
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,248
<i>that gave the audience feelings</i>

54
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,652
<i>they weren't sure
they should enjoy.</i>

55
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,727
<i>But they do.</i>

56
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:27,924
<i>And I knew if I could
find such an act,</i>

57
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,903
<i>I could create the greatest...</i>

58
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,367
<i>Show...</i>

59
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:34,507
<i>On...</i>

60
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:38,042
<i>Earth.</i>

61
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:41,511
<i>After the carnival, I moved
into the music business...</i>

62
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:44,246
<i>The country music business.</i>

63
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:48,718
<i>I partnered with one of its
biggest stars, Hank snow.</i>

64
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:54,390
<i>Pardon me if I'm sentimental</i>

65
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:56,828
<i>when we say goodbye</i>

66
00:05:56,964 --> 00:06:01,198
<i>And his hapless son,
jimmie Rodgers snow.</i>

67
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,334
Hot-diggity-dog, Billy.

68
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,504
- I got one.
- Oh, yeah.

69
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,239
Can't believe it.
Blow their socks off.

70
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:09,600
Security. Security, disk in!

71
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:12,507
Tell the mayors of these towns
that we need a police escort

72
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:14,207
for Hank when he arrives.

73
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:17,349
In Baton Rouge, we are going
to have a carny wedding

74
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:18,946
at the top of the Ferris wheel,

75
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,214
so, zina, pick out
your next husband.

76
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:23,753
In New Orleans, we're gonna
use the loudspeaker

77
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,783
- to announce you, Hank.
- Oh, sure.

78
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:29,864
You are going
to march in the parade.

79
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,091
Am I gonna be riding
on an elephant, too?

80
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,264
A man on an elephant
looks important.

81
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,600
And taller.

82
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:38,065
We still need to get
a novelty act

83
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,138
- to bring in the young folk.
- Well, yes, yes,

84
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:42,939
that's why you have a meeting
with the Duke of paducah tonight.

85
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:45,270
If we can book "the funniest
mouth in the south,"

86
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,755
we'll have the greatest show
of the season.

87
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:47,983
Hey, jimmie,
turn that record off.

88
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,506
Y'all have to hear this.

89
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,601
Kids all over town
are playing it everywhere I go.

90
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:00,654
I hear negro rhythms.

91
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,463
But with a country flavor.

92
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,923
Sun records?
That's Sam Phillips' label.

93
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,656
Oh, yeah, Phillips.

94
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,535
He makes all those race records
with the colored singers.

95
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:11,435
Well, this fella's
on the hayride tonight,

96
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,005
after me in the newcomer spot.

97
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,664
In shreveport?

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,309
No, they are not putting
a colored boy on the hayride.

99
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:20,514
That's the thing. He's white.

100
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:22,582
He's...

101
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,147
He's white?

102
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:27,764
<i>What do you think, texarkana?</i>

103
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,514
<i>Shall we play it
for the 27th time?</i>

104
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,368
<i>Well, that's all right, mama</i>

105
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:32,957
<i>that's all right for you</i>

106
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,873
<i>Shall we play it
for the 27th time?</i>

107
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:37,629
<i>Everybody's talkin' 'bout
this new Presley kid</i>

108
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:39,965
<i>That's all right...</i>

109
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,395
<i>That's all right
that's all right...</i>

110
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,136
He's white?

111
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,880
<i>But it don't matter
if you do ten stupid things,</i>

112
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,917
<i>as long as you do one smart one.</i>

113
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:08,487
<i>Welcome y'all
to the Louisiana hayride,</i>

114
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:12,693
<i>broadcasting live
to 26 of these United States.</i>

115
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:15,333
<i>How do you think I feel</i>

116
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,102
<i>I know your love's not real</i>

117
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:23,209
Well, the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

118
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:24,910
Where is the colonel?

119
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,076
You have the fella that's
singing the "all right, mama,"

120
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:30,682
that new record that's
on the sun label, eh?

121
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:32,712
- The pop jocks keep playing him.
- Yeah.

122
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,347
Country DJs, too.

123
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,889
Even the colored kids,
they're buyin' his record.

124
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:40,687
The colored ki... well, where
would I find such an act?

125
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:42,189
The dressing room.

126
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:48,498
- Oh. Howdy.
- Hey, Elvis Presley?

127
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:49,634
- Blue moon boys?
- Yeah.

128
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:51,231
- You're up next.
- Oh, sh...

129
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,999
Excuse me. Bill, go time!

130
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,235
I know, I know.

131
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,807
- Hi!
- How's his stomach?

132
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:00,306
I thought I'd grab him a Pepsi,

133
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,341
but poor thing's still shaking
like a leaf.

134
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:05,080
I'll get him on the stage.
Come on. Let's go.

135
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,881
Here.

136
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:10,349
It'll settle your stomach.

137
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,300
What if I forget
the words on live radio?

138
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:14,605
All we gotta do out there's
just a bit of clownin' around.

139
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,288
That's how we got this thing
started in the first place.

140
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,059
Scotty and bill are right,
Elvis.

141
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:20,634
You're not out there
on your own.

142
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,541
- You boys are a band.
- That's right.

143
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:24,205
The lord gave us music
to bring people together.

144
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,704
We're like a family,

145
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,640
and family is the most
important thing of all.

146
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,303
Amen.

147
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:33,041
Come on now, booby.
Jesse's shining bright tonight.

148
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:35,777
Shining down his strength
upon you.

149
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:46,092
<i>Oh, I'll fly away</i>

150
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:50,964
<i>Jesse, Elvis's twin
brother, who died at birth.</i>

151
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,756
<i>Tragic.</i>

152
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,960
<i>Vernon, come quick!
It's another child!</i>

153
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:58,467
<i>My darling, you'll
have the strength of two men.</i>

154
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:01,201
<i>But when my boy's
daddy passed a bad check</i>

155
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:02,577
<i>and got carted off to prison...</i>

156
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,254
<i>The boy and his mama had
to take one of the houses</i>

157
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:08,505
<i>for white folks
in a colored neighborhood.</i>

158
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,113
<i>New boy! Come over!</i>

159
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:12,142
<i>But that boy
had a big imagination.</i>

160
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,559
<i>He really believed
he was the hero</i>

161
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,631
<i>in one of them comic books.</i>

162
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:20,254
<i>He was going to bust
his daddy out of the hoosegow</i>

163
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,193
<i>and fly him
to the rock of eternity!</i>

164
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:26,856
Then he buys
his mama a pink Cadillac.

165
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:29,169
Pink Cadillac?
What are you talking about?

166
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,029
Hey, fools! Whoo!

167
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:35,940
<i>Ohh</i>

168
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:39,069
<i>black snake crawlin' in my room</i>

169
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,081
come on, doc, let's go.

170
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:44,678
<i>Them comic book heroes
all have them super powers.</i>

171
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:48,383
<i>His was music.</i>

172
00:10:48,518 --> 00:10:56,518
<i>That's all right, mama
that's all right with you</i>

173
00:10:56,798 --> 00:11:03,660

Hey, fool, come back.

191
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,916
No. He's with the spirit!

192
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:25,977
It's all right.

193
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:33,959
<i>Ohh</i>

<i>That's all right, mama

<i>-ohhh

204
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,022
Elvis. Come on,
you gotta get on in.

205
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,393
They've already announced you
on the radio.

206
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,952
Folks are real excited.

207
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,657
<i>At sun records,
Sam Phillips was on a mission</i>

208
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,961
<i>to save the world
by recording black music.</i>

209
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:16,161
<i>But it didn't sell.</i>

210
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,829
<i>So to pay his bills,</i>

211
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,501
<i>he needed to find a new singer
for his country act.</i>

212
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:24,401
I don't know what it is
you see in this boy.

213
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,979
I just think he's different.

214
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:34,085
How do you know
"big boy" crudup?

215
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:40,255
<i>That's all right, mama
that's all right for you</i>

216
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,864
<i>that's all right, mama

217
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:47,725
<i>that's all right
that's all right</i>

218
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:52,628
<i>that's all right now, mama
anyway you do</i>

219
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,871
He's a young singer
from Memphis, Tennessee.

220
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:03,445
Got a song out on the sun
label. It's all over the radio.

221
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,987
Give him a warm hayride welcome
to a Mr. Elvis Presley.

222
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:29,266
Elvis, how are you this evening?

223
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,910
Just fine, how you, sir?

224
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:35,608
<i>Greasy hair, girly makeup.</i>

225
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:38,910
<i>I cannot overstate
how strange he looked.</i>

226
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,165
Are you all geared up
with your band there to...

227
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,322
- I'm all geared up.
- Let us hear your songs?

228
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:46,056
Uh... well, I'd like to say how
happy we are to be down here.

229
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:48,027
It's a real honor
for us to be...

230
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:50,229
Get a chance to appear
on the Louisiana hayride.

231
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:52,793
We're gonna do a song for you
we got out on sun records.

232
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:55,362
Uh...

233
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:56,818
You got anything else
to say, sir?

234
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,005
No. I'm ready.

235
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:06,646
It goes...

236
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,542
It goes something like this.

237
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:13,618
<i>Oh, baby, baby,</i>

238
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:16,049
<i>baby, baby, baby</i>

239
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:18,084

00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,489
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

<i>Come back, baby

get a haircut, fairy!

244
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:39,178
<i>In that moment,
in a flash of lightning,</i>

245
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,979
<i>I watched that skinny boy
in the pink suit</i>

246
00:15:42,114 --> 00:15:46,010
<i>transform into a superhero.</i>

247
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:51,481
<i>Well, you may go to college
you may go to school</i>

248
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:55,094
<i>you may have a pink Cadillac
but don't you be nobody's fool</i>

249
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:57,927
<i>now, baby come back, baby, come</i>

250
00:15:58,063 --> 00:15:59,792

253
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:07,572
<i>what I'm talking about</i>

254
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:12,302
<i>Come on back to me, little
girl so we can play some house</i>

255
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,010
<i>Baby, come back, baby, come</i>

00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:16,339

- What are they hollerin' at?
- The wiggle!

260
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:25,617
The what?

261
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:26,933
Them girls wanna see you wiggle.

262
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:27,991
Move, man!

263
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:30,021
- Do more!
- Much more!

264
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,189
Man!

265
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,664
Do it again.

266
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:38,864
<i>Well, this is one thing, baby
that I want you to know</i>

267
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,732
<i>come on back
let's play a little house</i>

268
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,167
<i>and we can do what we did before</i>

269
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:43,168
<i>now, baby</i>

270
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,171

271
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,672
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

272
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:48,178
<i>come back, baby, come

273
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:49,914
what in god's sweet name
am I looking at?

274
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:51,012
Hit it!

275
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,709
What were you thinking, jimmie?

276
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,358
I don't know what I'm thinking.

277
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,551
Please, lord,
don't let 'em hurt my baby.

278
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:33,753
Hurt him?
Looks like they wanna...

279
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,257
<i>Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby</i>

280
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,902
<i>Now, I don't
know nothin' about music...</i>

281
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:50,074
<i>But I could see
in that girl's eyes,</i>

282
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,935
<i>that she was having feelings</i>

283
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,908
<i>she wasn't sure
she should enjoy.</i>

284
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:57,980
<i>Black snake crawlin' in my room</i>

285
00:17:58,115 --> 00:17:59,647
<i>Yes.</i>

286
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:06,390
<i>He was a taste
of forbidden fruit.</i>

287
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:11,296
<i>She could've eaten him alive.</i>

288
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:29,140
Why are you trying
to kill my son?

289
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,210
<i>It was the greatest
carnival attraction</i>

290
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:33,181
<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

291
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:35,814
<i>He was my destiny.</i>

292
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,622
<i>Right under my nose...
In Memphis.</i>

293
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:44,805
<i>Top of the morning
to you, friends,</i>

294
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:46,993
<i>from the home of colorful,
old beale street.</i>

295
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:50,295
<i>The place where the blues began
in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

296
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,701
<i>where you see pretty browns
dressed in beautiful gowns,</i>

297
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:55,441
<i>along with tailor-mades
and hand-me-downs.</i>

298
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:58,005
<i>Where you see honest men
and pickpockets skilled,</i>

299
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:00,747
<i>and business never closes
till somebody gets killed.</i>

300
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:02,647
<i>Now, just kidding.</i>

301
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,076
<i>But there's a lot goin' down
on beale street tonight,</i>

302
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,343
<i>and nowhere more-so
than at the club handy.</i>

303
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,319
<i>Come around if you wanna see
big mama Thornton,</i>

304
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:11,816
<i>layin' down her newest hit.</i>

305
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,136
<i>Get it, get it</i>

306
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,023
Get it! Come on!

307
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:15,991
<i>Oh, let's do it</i>

308
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:19,430
<i>Now, listen up,
while brown america speaks.</i>

309
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:23,960
<i>You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog</i>

310
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,568
<i>quit snoopin' 'round my door</i>

311
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:38,880
<i>Just why a truck
driver from Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

312
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:42,646
<i>liked to hang out
on beale street, I do not know.</i>

313
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,455
<i>You told me you was high class
but I could see through that...</i>

314
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:48,856
<i>But it did him no favors,</i>

315
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:52,755
<i>fitting into them
white housing projects.</i>

316
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,668
Hey, squirrel. Nice shoes.

317
00:19:55,803 --> 00:20:02,308
<i>And, daddy, I know that
you ain't no real cool cat</i>

318
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:04,702
hey, Elvis!

319
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,620
<i>Hey, Tommy.</i>

320
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,915
<i>That's that boy whose record
everybody's talkin' about.</i>

321
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:24,726
<i>You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog</i>

322
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:47,619
<i>Hey, sideburns.
Where's the negro suit today?</i>

323
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:52,188
<i>He was crazy
for that beale street music.</i>

324
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:54,988
<i>Beale street style.</i>

325
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:58,393
<i>He had beale street stars
in his eyes.</i>

326
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,392
What do you think, Tony? Huh?

327
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,161
B.b. King.

328
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,801
<i>No, I didn't take my boy away
from nothin'.</i>

329
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:10,409
<i>He was runnin'
from the day he was born.</i>

330
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:14,978
<i>I just opened the door
to our destiny.</i>

331
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:17,976
<i>So without so much as
a word to your daddy and me,</i>

332
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,650
<i>you quit your job
to go traveling</i>

333
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:22,020
<i>all the way to Florida
with this colonel fellow</i>

334
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,879
<i>that we have never met.</i>

335
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:25,388
Mama, it's only four days.

336
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:27,988
Yeah, four days.
And then what?

337
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:31,525
I knew a fella once,
got his record on the radio.

338
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,863
It was all over in a flash.

339
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:36,995
Mama, I'm just trying
to take care of you and daddy.

340
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,000
That's all I have
ever cared about.

341
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:40,814
I ain't ever gonna let us
get back to a place again

342
00:21:40,838 --> 00:21:42,209
where daddy gets in trouble
with the law

343
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:43,772
- to put food on the table.
- Elvis!

344
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:46,137
How dare you?

345
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:48,346
As the good lord warns us,

346
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:50,845
do not wear yourself out
to get rich.

347
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,818
Do not trust your own
goddamn cleverness!

348
00:21:57,621 --> 00:22:00,558
Elvis, you've upset your mama.

349
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,804
You know, mama, I was thinkin',

350
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,874
maybe I'll buy you one of them
pink Cadillacs

351
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,170
like you saw back when you
was working at the hospital.

352
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:23,108
I don't need no pink Cadillac.

353
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:27,044
Satnin, I just gotta be making

354
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,852
the most of this thing
while I can.

355
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:31,719
It's like daddy says, this
could all be over in a flash.

356
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:34,556
I'm not fearful
of it being over, booby.

357
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:37,560
I don't know how to explain it.

358
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:41,458
But I saw it
in that girl's eyes.

359
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:45,730
It's something beyond us,
but I know that whatever it is,

360
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,440
it's something that...

361
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,168
It's something
that can come between us.

362
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,577
Oh, no, mama, no. Hey.

363
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:56,642
Ain't nothing ever
gonna do that.

364
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:59,845
You're my girl. My satnin.

365
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,248
You'll always be
my bestest girl.

366
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:04,121
Hey.

367
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,120
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

368
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:10,320
I will call you every night.

369
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:15,292
Will you promise me, booby?

370
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:18,227
I promise.

371
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,768
I promise. I promise,
I promise.

372
00:23:20,904 --> 00:23:22,901
- All right. I love you.
- Bye, baby.

373
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:24,569
<i>Nothing but nothing...</i>

374
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:25,704
I love you.

375
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:27,271
<i>Is gonna come between us.</i>

376
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,409
- Let's go!
- Bye, booby!

377
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:30,945
See you soon!

378
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,753
Wanna bet?

379
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:38,051
<i>Well, it's one for the money
two for the show</i>

380
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:40,153
<i>three to get ready
now go, cat, go</i>

381
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:45,021
<i>but don't you
step on my blue suede shoes</i>

382
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,565
<i>well, you can do anything</i>

383
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,998
<i>but stay off of my
blue suede shoes</i>

384
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,835
<i>well, you can knock me down
step in my face</i>

385
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,634
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

386
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,267
<i>I have some good news.</i>

387
00:23:56,403 --> 00:23:59,502
<i>Our next four nights
are sold out...</i>

388
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:01,272
<i>thanks to the dazzling
performances</i>

389
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:05,410
<i>of our tremendous showman,
Hank snow.</i>

390
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:12,515
<i>Pardon me if I'm sentimental
when we say goodbye</i>

391
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,250
<i>And I've noticed a mild interest</i>

392
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,787
<i>in our newest act,
Elvis Presley.</i>

393
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:24,767
Hi.

394
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:26,468
Yeah, Dixie, I'll be back
before prom.

395
00:24:31,174 --> 00:24:33,942
<i>Well you can burn my house
steal my car</i>

396
00:24:34,077 --> 00:24:36,549
<i>drink my liquor
from an old fruit jar</i>

397
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,607
<i>do anything that you want to do</i>

398
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,014
Colonel, what is
that boy doing on our tour?

399
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,709
Well, I told you all about him.

400
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:44,748
And he wants to record
one of your songs.

401
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,255
Oh? Which one?

402
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,390
All of them.

403
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:49,487
Well, you warn him plenty.

404
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:53,790
None of those lewd gyrations
or sudden, jerky movements.

405
00:24:57,236 --> 00:24:58,538
Let's go!

406
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:00,870
Let's rock!

407
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:10,974
Is that a pair
of young ladies' intimates

408
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,350
I see upon the stage?

409
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:14,543
Yes, I believe it is, Hank.

410
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:17,518
Best not happen
when he sings one of my songs.

411
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:19,186
I'm sure it won't.

412
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:20,704
<i>Elvis, the papers say
there are girls</i>

413
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,155
<i>around your hotel
all night long.</i>

414
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:23,890
<i>I don't even go out, mama.
I stay in.</i>

415
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:25,998
<i>You know, it gets lonesome.</i>

416
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,459
<i>I tell you, this
new sensation, Elvis Presley,</i>

417
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,436
<i>he's breaking hearts
all over the south.</i>

418
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,033
Quit knocking at my door,
Scotty.

419
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:43,583
<i>Are you sorry we drifted apart?</i>

420
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:48,544
<i>Never know how much I love you</i>

421
00:25:49,721 --> 00:25:53,691
<i>never know how much I care</i>

422
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:56,919
<i>when you put your arms around me</i>

423
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:02,460
<i>Oh, come on, e.P.</i>

424
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,061
Life on the road ain't
the concern of folks back home.

425
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,395
<i>Fever</i>

426
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,231
Why don't you try one of these?

427
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,533
Put the pep back into your step.

428
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:13,206
<i>What a lovely way to burn</i>

429
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,241
<i>Well, shake, rattle and roll</i>

430
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:19,580
<i>I said shake, rattle and roll</i>

431
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:22,486
<i>I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll</i>

432
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:23,747
<i>well, you won't do right</i>

433
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:24,882
whoo!

434
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:26,318
<i>To save your doggone soul</i>

435
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:27,737
You're really
something else, man!

436
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:29,090
I promise,
I'll put my heart in...

437
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:30,573
I wanna be just like you!

438
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:32,158
Okay. Yeah, thank you.

439
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:33,925
I can no longer,
in good conscience,

440
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:35,290
go on stage with that boy.

441
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:38,397
Yes, a conundrum. A conundrum.

442
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:41,906
Please welcome
to the stage, Hank snow!

443
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:45,710
After I perform, I shall
spend the night in prayer.

444
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:48,505
And I will do
what needs to be done.

445
00:26:57,554 --> 00:26:58,955
Come on, jimmie!

446
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:04,859
<i>How do you think that I feel</i>

447
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,490
<i>oh, baby oh, baby</i>

448
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,703
<i>how do you think that I feel</i>

449
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,541
<i>That night,
I happened to see him.</i>

450
00:27:25,284 --> 00:27:26,686
<i>Alone.</i>

451
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,688
<i>Lost.</i>

452
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:36,152
<i>A snowman is only as good...</i>

453
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,394
<i>As his attraction.</i>

454
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,194
Elvis!

455
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:42,031
- Come on, man.
- Elvis, come on! Hurry up!

456
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:49,237
<i>It was all, or nothing.</i>

457
00:27:49,372 --> 00:27:50,880
Elvis, we're going
to the hall of mirrors!

458
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:52,438
Wait up!

459
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:54,524
Screw the hall
of mirrors. That's boring.

460
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,517
Right, hang on.
Here we go.

461
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:05,588
Hold on.

462
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:08,893
All right, fellas. Come on.

463
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:14,690
- Oh.
- Lost, my boy?

464
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:18,232
Colonel Parker, sir.

465
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:23,707
You look lost.

466
00:28:23,842 --> 00:28:26,108
- I guess I am.
- Ah, yes.

467
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:29,914
The roar of the crowd.
The life on the road.

468
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,177
And then calling home
to your loved ones,

469
00:28:32,312 --> 00:28:34,319
pretending nothing has changed,

470
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:36,888
when everything has.

471
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:40,122
Yeah. Lost.

472
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,455
I'm sorry, sir. I... I meant
I don't know the way out.

473
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:49,130
Yeah, that is precisely
what I am saying.

474
00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:54,096
I... I saw you.
Apart from all the others.

475
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:56,468
Burdened.

476
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:59,273
Like you don't know
how to get out of this.

477
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:01,737
But I do.

478
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,043
<i>Snowman's coming</i>

479
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:06,417
allow me to show you.

480
00:29:06,553 --> 00:29:09,421
<i>Yes, he's coming</i>

481
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:13,989
<i>take his magic hand</i>

482
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:15,960
Creatures of the carnival.

483
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:18,259
And I am one myself.

484
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:21,524
It's where I learned the art
of the snow job.

485
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,034
- Snow job?
- Yes.

486
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:24,914
It's like the trick
you do with the wiggling,

487
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:26,496
getting all the girls hyped up,

488
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,203
empty their wallets
and leave them

489
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,771
with nothing but the smiles
on their faces.

490
00:29:30,906 --> 00:29:31,970
I'm no trickster.

491
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,906
Oh, yes, you are.

492
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:36,238
All showmen are snowmen.

493
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,108
It's a wonderful place.

494
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:39,643
Nobody on the aerio.

495
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,454
Your future, Mr. Presley,
blazing before you.

496
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:50,830
Recording contracts,
television, even Hollywood.

497
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,001
You're great, colonel.

498
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:59,234
You are the best person
I could ever hope to work with.

499
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:00,969
You know, this is something
I ain't never

500
00:30:01,003 --> 00:30:02,840
said to nobody before...

501
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:04,804
But I believe
I can be great, too.

502
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,536
Oh, no doubt.

503
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,643
But we could be
even greater together.

504
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:14,853
But to achieve this, I need
to represent you exclusively.

505
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:17,285
Exclusively?
Sir, I... I don't follow.

506
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:20,050
What about Hank snow?

507
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,989
Hank. Yes...

508
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:24,061
He sent me here to fire you.

509
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,491
Hank wants you off the tour.

510
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:33,070
So I will have to leave Hank.

511
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,339
We will both have to
make sacrifices.

512
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:39,703
We will need a record label
with national distribution.

513
00:30:41,546 --> 00:30:43,080
Rca?

514
00:30:44,912 --> 00:30:46,750
Rca.

515
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,482
Sam Phillips... discovered me.

516
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:52,882
I know, but we have a way
to help Sam understand

517
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,054
that it would be foolish of him
to hold you back.

518
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,259
Every man has his price.

519
00:30:58,395 --> 00:31:00,295
Rca does have the distribution.

520
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,535
I just need to know that you'll

521
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,825
still be with me as friends.

522
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,996
Don't doubt that,
we're not going anywhere.

523
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:08,664
Marion and I just don't want to
stand in your way, that's all.

524
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,069
The world needs
to hear you sing, Elvis.

525
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,475
<i>Elvis Presley's
contract sold to rca today</i>

526
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,575
<i>for the highest price
in music history.</i>

527
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,180
<i>Quite the payday
for sun records.</i>

528
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:22,247
It's just business.
Show business.

529
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:23,679
To achieve truly great things,

530
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,090
one must make
truly great sacrifices.

531
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:29,786
You will have to be free
of any entanglements.

532
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:33,596
You see, my boy,
show business is snow business.

533
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:37,598
<i>And the fans need to believe
that you are always available.</i>

534
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,407
The colonel says
that with all the publicity

535
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,806
that's gonna be coming,

536
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,966
he might have to
put it out there that...

537
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,432
That...

538
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:46,609
I don't have a girl.

539
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:53,547
Then we will need
your parents' legal commitment.

540
00:31:53,682 --> 00:31:57,155
They may need a bit
of convincing themselves.

541
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,211
Sam Phillips
is a good man we can trust.

542
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,489
We don't know this colonel
from a nail in a wall.

543
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,505
Is there a lawyer
representing the family?

544
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,728
Oh, unnecessary.

545
00:32:05,864 --> 00:32:07,462
I am of the firm opinion

546
00:32:07,598 --> 00:32:10,902
that family is the most
important thing in the world.

547
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:13,628
In mind of that,
I have taken the Liberty

548
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:15,469
of making these contracts out

549
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:18,675
in the name
of Elvis Presley enterprises.

550
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,043
A family business.

551
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:22,844
And I was thinking,
Vernon Presley:

552
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:24,445
Business manager.

553
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,720
What do you think, daddy?

554
00:32:29,856 --> 00:32:32,123
Uh... well, uh...

555
00:32:32,258 --> 00:32:33,986
- I like it very much, son.
- Ah!

556
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,293
Mrs. Presley,
your son has a unique gift.

557
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:40,863
It's as though
he has the strength

558
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,325
of two men inside of him.

559
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,811
<i>You know, colonel,
I would do anything</i>

560
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:48,511
<i>to make sure my mama and daddy
never have to live</i>

561
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:50,371
<i>in no poverty ever again.</i>

562
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:53,971
Mama, it's gonna turn out
so, so good.

563
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:55,311
Mm.

564
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,130
Colonel, I wasn't fooling
when I told those other kids

565
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:01,674
I was gonna buy 'em
a Cadillac one day.

566
00:33:01,717 --> 00:33:04,146
My boy, with me, you will
buy them two Cadillacs.

567
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,552
Two?

568
00:33:06,956 --> 00:33:07,991
A hundred?

569
00:33:08,126 --> 00:33:09,223
Two hundred.

570
00:33:09,358 --> 00:33:11,188
- A thousand.
- A million.

571
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:12,559
An aeroplane.

572
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:14,630
How about a rocket ship?

573
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:19,038
Well, maybe not a rocket ship.
My mama don't like me to fly.

574
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:23,241
But me, I've always
wanted to fly. Fast.

575
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:27,009
Faster than the speed of light
to the rock of eternity.

576
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:29,240
What? To the rock of eternity?

577
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:30,874
Captain marvel, Jr.

578
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,712
He's my favorite
comic book hero.

579
00:33:34,852 --> 00:33:36,581
He flies.

580
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:38,552
Well, what about you,
Mr. Presley?

581
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,522
Are you ready to fly?

582
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,822
Yes, sir. I'm ready.

583
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:47,022
Ready to fly.

584
00:33:55,232 --> 00:33:56,912
<i>Uh, Mr. Presley,</i>

585
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:58,900
<i>try not to move around
so much during the takes.</i>

586
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,278
If I can't move, I can't sing.

587
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:04,209
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

588
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:09,211
<i>Well, I found a new place
to dwell</i>

589
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,059
<i>What is he doing?
We paid for this?</i>

590
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,849
<i>It's down at the end of
lonely street at...</i>

591
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,693
<i>It's a suicide song.</i>

592
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:17,388
<i>Heartbreak hotel</i>

593
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:20,260
<i>Them know-it-alls
said I'd backed the wrong horse.</i>

594
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:22,597
<i>But my boy knew teenagers.</i>

595
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:26,934
<i>And that first record
changed everything.</i>

596
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:31,672
<i>Well, it's so very hard to have
to leave the one you love</i>

597
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,037
<i>and you get more lonely
with each passing day</i>

598
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:41,250
<i>it's so lonely just sitting
and dreaming of...</i>

599
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:42,826
<i>In a few short months,</i>

600
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,618
<i>Elvis Presley has popped
out of nowhere.</i>

601
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:46,885
<i>Everywhere he goes,
he causes riots,</i>

602
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,625
<i>mountains of press
and rivers of money.</i>

603
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:52,121
<i>It's another
gold record for Elvis Presley.</i>

604
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,958
<i>This one giving him his first
worldwide hit.</i>

605
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:02,473
Mrs. Presley, look!

606
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:05,803
Come on, Mrs. Presley, let
me show you how to use this.

607
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:08,112
Come on, hens! Come on, hens!
Come on!

608
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:11,808
Come on! Outside!
Out of my house!

609
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,450
Come on, this way!
Come on, babies!

610
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,619
Dodger!

611
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:23,018
- Go, Billy boy!
- Ya-hoo-hoo!

612
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,962
<i>I took my boy's wiggling</i>

613
00:35:25,098 --> 00:35:27,657
<i>and put it in the movies.</i>

614
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,659
<i>I took his name and face,</i>

615
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,500
<i>and put it on all sorts of toys</i>

616
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:33,671
<i>and knick-knacks,
and called it...</i>

617
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,096
"Merchandise."

618
00:35:35,232 --> 00:35:37,605
Your face on every
conceivable object,

619
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,142
including Teddy bear, perfume,
plaster busts...

620
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:42,473
Of questionable likeness.

621
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:44,139
"The Elvis Presley game."

622
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:47,384
Something so everyone
can show their love.

623
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,883
Grandma dodger,
what is that behind your ear?

624
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,051
"I hate Elvis."

625
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,389
Huh?

626
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:00,054
Yes. I hate Elvis.

627
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,733
In my way of thinking,
"I love Elvis,"

628
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,068
that's an easy sell.

629
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,894
Those who hate your son
will do so

630
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,635
whether we profit
from it or not.

631
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:12,409
After all, what is hate worth
if it's free?

632
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,379
Oh, yeah. I get it.

633
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,652
Snowman strikes again.

634
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:25,719
Merchandise, promotion.
Diskin, what else do we have?

635
00:36:25,854 --> 00:36:27,470
- Necklaces.
- Necklaces.

636
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:30,427
- Scarves.
- Oh, scarves. Yes...

637
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:33,095
<i>Mr. Presley
and Mr. King...</i>

638
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,429
Regular peas in a pod,

639
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:36,296
relieving me
of my finest threads.

640
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:37,529
Must be some occasion.

641
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:38,895
Mr. Lansky, it's Milton berle.

642
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,828
The whole of america'll
be watching.

643
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:42,907
I don't watch television.

644
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,241
So what's it gonna be?

645
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:46,101
How you gonna
blow their wigs off?

646
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,612
Well, the network
wants me to do a ballad.

647
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:51,727
But I'm thinking about
cuttin' it up with "hound dog."

648
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,110
Whoo!

649
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:59,113
Elvis Presley, "hound dog,"
and uncle miltie.

650
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:01,152
Strange things
are happening every day.

651
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:04,060
<i>You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog, hound dog</i>

652
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:06,298
<i>cryin' all the time</i>

653
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,790
<i>you ain't nothin'
but a hound dog</i>

654
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,369
<i>cryin' all the time</i>

655
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:13,129
<i>well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit</i>

656
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,801
<i>and you ain't no friend of mine</i>

657
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:18,537
<i>when they said
you was high classed</i>

658
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:20,906
<i>well, that was just a lie</i>

659
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,708
<i>yeah, they said
you were high classed</i>

660
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:26,107
behold, tomorrow, all of america

661
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:28,413
will be talking
about Elvis Presley.

662
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:29,549
<i>My wiggling boy.</i>

663
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:34,187
Even as a little one,
he made me laugh so.

664
00:37:34,323 --> 00:37:36,123
He's so funny!

665
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:38,338
<i>You never caught a rabbit
you ain't no friend of mine</i>

666
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:44,831
<i>You ain't nothin' but a
hound dog, a hound dog</i>

667
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:47,766
<i>cryin' all the time</i>

668
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:49,342
And, senator, for the next leg

669
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:50,804
of your racial integrity tour,

670
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,935
we booked the over ton
park shell in Memphis.

671
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,803
What are they laughing about?

672
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:01,980
<i>You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog</i>

673
00:38:03,321 --> 00:38:05,781
<i>cryin' all the time</i>

674
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,993
who the hell is that?

675
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,291
It's that boy from Memphis.

676
00:38:10,427 --> 00:38:12,590
Elvis Presley.

677
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,829
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

678
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:19,329
a white boy from Memphis,
moving like a goddamn...

679
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:25,344
<i>Is your heart filled with pain</i>

680
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:29,374
<i>shall I come back...</i>

681
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:34,345
<i>The obscenity and vulgarity
of this rock and roll music</i>

682
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:38,214
<i>is obviously a means by which
the white man and his children</i>

683
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,484
<i>can be driven to the level
of the negro.</i>

684
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,631
<i>The colored folks have
been singing and playing it</i>

685
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:45,021
<i>just like I'm doing it now,
man, more years than I know.</i>

686
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,597
Colonel Parker,
we called you in here

687
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:48,324
to talk about this act of yours.

688
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,074
<i>A petition has begun circulating</i>

689
00:38:50,098 --> 00:38:52,535
<i>to bar Elvis Presley
from television.</i>

690
00:38:52,671 --> 00:38:54,232
<i>We've set up a committee</i>

691
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:56,905
<i>to keep an eye on this vulgar,
animalistic rock and roll bum.</i>

692
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,847
<i>Your style
of gyrating while you sing</i>

693
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:00,168
<i>has been bitterly criticized...</i>

694
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,010
I don't feel I'm doing
anything wrong.

695
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:04,145
<i>We simply will not
advertise on any station</i>

696
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,847
<i>that puts this delinquent
on television.</i>

697
00:39:05,983 --> 00:39:08,678
Colonel, you put an end
to your boy's animal behavior,

698
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,679
<i>or we will.</i>

699
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,356
<i>Don't worry, senator,
my boy does what he's told.</i>

700
00:39:13,491 --> 00:39:16,050
<i>Tell me, dear</i>

701
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:21,697
<i>are you lonesome tonight?</i>

702
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,837
"Elvis the pelvis."

703
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:30,899
That's one of the most childish
expressions I've ever heard

704
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:33,038
coming from an adult.

705
00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:35,106
Is Mr. Allen gonna cancel me
from the show?

706
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:37,079
Yes.

707
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:39,279
Yes, he is.

708
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:43,422
He is replacing you with one of
the country's greatest singers.

709
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:46,253
Mario lanza?

710
00:39:46,388 --> 00:39:47,619
Someone greater.

711
00:39:47,754 --> 00:39:50,561
The new Elvis Presley!

712
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:54,697
Yeah, I snowed 'em!

713
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,365
You just have to put on
one of these tails here,

714
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:58,966
can sing the "hound dog,"

715
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:02,239
and it's a light-hearted,
sophisticated family show.

716
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,602
I can't move in one of these.

717
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:04,737
And that is the point.

718
00:40:04,806 --> 00:40:06,839
Mr. Allen agreed only as long

719
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:09,308
as there is no wiggling
of those hips.

720
00:40:09,444 --> 00:40:11,764
I can't figure it out. My own
mother approves of what I do.

721
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:13,483
Mmm.

722
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:16,317
You have read the papers,
my boy?

723
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:18,118
Yeah, I read the papers.

724
00:40:18,254 --> 00:40:20,591
The papers say that I shot
my mother and smoke marijuana.

725
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:23,660
Your movement's
in the style of a black man,

726
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:26,124
and you have broken
the segregation laws.

727
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,258
So let's follow the plan.
It's a good plan.

728
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,425
You do the<i> Allen show,</i>
family style,

729
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,002
and then tomorrow
we go back to Memphis and

730
00:40:33,137 --> 00:40:36,807
we snow them on the July 4th
children's charitable concert.

731
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:40,037
And we put this whole
unfortunate misstep behind us.

732
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:42,545
Now, do you want
to go into politics?

733
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:45,550
Or shall we stay
in show business?

734
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:49,864
<i>We want to do
a show the whole family</i>

735
00:40:49,888 --> 00:40:51,781
<i>can watch and enjoy,
and we always do.</i>

736
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,268
<i>And at this time, it gives me
extreme pleasure to introduce</i>

737
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:54,992
<i>the new Elvis Presley!</i>

738
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:00,692
<i>He used to be so hip.</i>

739
00:41:00,798 --> 00:41:02,526
<i>He looked so silly.</i>

740
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:04,529
<i>I mean, he looked like a Butler.</i>

741
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:06,010
<i>I can't believe
he agreed to sing to a dog.</i>

742
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:07,474
God damn it!

743
00:41:09,642 --> 00:41:11,005
He could've given us
some warning.

744
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:12,989
I know how to do a skit,
I could've made it funny!

745
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:16,505
The most stupid, embarrassing,
humiliating thing I ever did.

746
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,258
Well, what the hell
do you want me to do about it?

747
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:19,550
We're musicians!

748
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,125
<i>It's just embarrassing.</i>

749
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:22,422
<i>Who does he think he is?</i>

750
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,598
<i>She just went on
and on about the damn dog.</i>

751
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,901
And I said, "neighbors
shouldn't speak like that."

752
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,509
And then she said...

753
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:49,408
I like the bit with the dog.

754
00:41:49,543 --> 00:41:51,825
It was the most embarrassing
performance of my life, daddy.

755
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:53,913
She wasn't the only one
who said it.

756
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:55,717
- All the neighbors did.
- Oh, god.

757
00:41:55,853 --> 00:41:57,355
Those New York people
were using you

758
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,054
to poke fun at the whole south.

759
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,825
Getting a laugh out of putting
a hillbilly in a tailcoat

760
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,291
and singing to a dog.

761
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:08,057
God damn it, mama, it was
either that or I get canceled.

762
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,099
Then that's it for television.

763
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:12,868
Colonel says I'm running out
of states that I'm welcome in.

764
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:15,532
And they don't pay
unless I can perform.

765
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:18,208
So colonel says I play the
charity concert tomorrow night,

766
00:42:18,344 --> 00:42:20,702
as the new family style,

767
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:23,574
then everybody calms down
and we get back on track.

768
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:26,348
Someone's got to think about
keeping a roof over our heads.

769
00:42:26,484 --> 00:42:28,183
Roof over our head?

770
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:30,953
We've always managed to keep
a roof over our head, Vernon.

771
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:32,889
Mama, daddy is business
manager. It's his job.

772
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:34,451
That's right.

773
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,757
We was doing just fine
before that man came along.

774
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:38,254
Colonel has got us all of this.

775
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,826
I don't want all this!
You're unhappy!

776
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:42,733
I am not!

777
00:42:43,965 --> 00:42:45,829
You're losing yourself, booby!

778
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:47,632
Oh, hell, mama, I...

779
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:49,137
Satnin knows.

780
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,776
The way you sing and move...

781
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,543
It's god-given.

782
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,146
So there can't be nothing
wrong with it.

783
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:09,753
Hey, I'm gonna ask cousin
about the movie.

784
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:11,254
Hey, e.P., e.P.!

785
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,694
Can we close down
the movie house

786
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:14,092
and watch<i> Godzilla</i> tonight?

787
00:43:14,228 --> 00:43:16,526
Don't tramp mud
in the house, Billy!

788
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:18,043
But you said
we could watch the movie!

789
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,763
Get out! Get out of my
goddamn house!

790
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:21,450
- You said you'd take us!
- Tramping mud in my house

791
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,767
and doing my damn head in.

792
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,173
Mama, you ain't never happy.

793
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:28,840
No matter what I do,
no matter how much I give you,

794
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:30,407
it ain't never enough.

795
00:43:30,543 --> 00:43:32,976
And, I wish you would not drink
so goddamn much.

796
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,579
It's not good for you.

797
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:36,083
Baby!

798
00:43:36,218 --> 00:43:37,898
- Put that back in the shed!
- Elvis, wait!

799
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:45,158
Elvis! Elvis, come on!
Elvis!

800
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:49,531
<i>Here's Elvis Presley.</i>

801
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:09,216
<i>This is

806
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:54,733

Have a good night.

808
00:45:07,713 --> 00:45:09,275
Thank you. Have a good night.

Hey, listen, man.

You're at the right place.

So just do me a favor...

824
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:01,960
Let it all hang out.

Sister rosetta found this kid
in the backwaters of Georgia.

837
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:48,934
They should get the colonel
to book him on Steve Allen.

838
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:55,150
They would love his moves.

00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:15,461
That's a nice ride
you rode up in tonight.

865
00:48:15,596 --> 00:48:18,193
It ain't like your ol'
big b.B. King bus.

866
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:22,073
Big red.

867
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:25,505
Yeah, well, I can go where
I want, play what I want,

868
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,737
and if they don't like it,
I can go someplace else.

869
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,838
You've got to be
in control, man.

870
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:32,908
You should have your own label,
like me.

871
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,546
You don't do the business,
the business will do you.

872
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:37,912
Man, I just leave all that
to the colonel.

873
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:42,220
So it's, um...

874
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:44,424
It's his idea, this new Elvis?

875
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:47,088
Listen, I don't get it, man.

876
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:49,663
Cats buy your records
because they like what you do,

877
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:53,501
not because you're dressed up
like some... like some Butler.

878
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:55,972
You really think those kids
want to see Elvis the Butler

879
00:48:56,108 --> 00:48:57,428
at the russwood park
gig tomorrow?

880
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,966
Man, I ain't wearing no tails.

881
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:02,873
I just... Gotta lay
off the moves, is all.

882
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:05,480
Colonel says if I don't,
they're gonna put me in jail.

883
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,317
Come on, man.

884
00:49:11,453 --> 00:49:13,015
They're not gonna
put you in jail.

885
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:14,760
They might put me in jail
for walking across the street,

886
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:16,292
but you're a famous white boy.

887
00:49:16,427 --> 00:49:18,628
Too many people are making
too much money off of you

888
00:49:18,764 --> 00:49:20,288
to put you in jail.

889
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,190
You think so?

890
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,498
I know so.

891
00:49:23,634 --> 00:49:28,700
Colonel's a smart man.
There's gotta be another reason.

892
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,575
<i>Every day, yes</i>

893
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:38,641
<i>there are strange things
happening every day</i>

894
00:49:38,777 --> 00:49:41,481
hey, Elvis, b.B.!
Give us a smile.

895
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:46,356
<i>Every day</i>

896
00:49:46,492 --> 00:49:48,852
<i>You promised us
a new Elvis, colonel.</i>

897
00:49:48,988 --> 00:49:52,889
Yet, here he is with this
b.B. King at club handy,

898
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:56,056
jiggling and wiggling
with Billy ward, and here,

899
00:49:56,192 --> 00:49:59,400
on colored night
at the Memphis fairgrounds.

900
00:49:59,535 --> 00:50:01,101
We've been poking
into your background,

901
00:50:01,237 --> 00:50:02,772
and we've found your records.

902
00:50:02,908 --> 00:50:05,072
"Unfit for military duty."

903
00:50:05,207 --> 00:50:07,673
"Acute psychopathic state."

904
00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:12,512
Well... I was pretending
to be crazy. I wanted out.

905
00:50:12,648 --> 00:50:15,044
I was just a boy
from hunting ton, West Virginia.

906
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:18,383
Well, before the army, we found
no record of you at all.

907
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:21,754
<i>Every day, yeah</i>

908
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:26,955
<i>there are strange things
happening every day</i>

909
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:31,597
<i>every day are so strange</i>

910
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:34,469
<i>every day
people are stealing the planes</i>

911
00:50:34,604 --> 00:50:37,903
<i>oh! There are strange
things happening</i>

912
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:42,374
<i>every day oh, ain't
that strange, every day</i>

913
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:47,285
<i>Every day, yes</i>

914
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,947
<i>there are strange things
happening every day</i>

915
00:50:53,888 --> 00:50:56,756
<i>While 10,000 screaming
fans were cramming in</i>

916
00:50:56,891 --> 00:50:59,262
<i>to see our show,
senator east land was holding</i>

917
00:50:59,398 --> 00:51:02,463
<i>a segregationist rally
just three miles away.</i>

918
00:51:05,734 --> 00:51:08,333
The mayor loved you
on the<i> Steve Allen show.</i>

919
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:11,042
All the important people did.

920
00:51:11,177 --> 00:51:13,243
What song are you going
to sing tonight?

921
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,806
I've made no decision.

922
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:19,876
I'll feel it.

923
00:51:26,787 --> 00:51:28,237
Pay no mind to all the cameras.

924
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:31,019
Those are our friends
in the vice squad.

925
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:34,188
They don't mean nothing.
Ain't that right, chief?

926
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:36,794
As long as you don't
so much as wiggle a finger.

927
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:54,185
Oh, yes, sir, good people!

928
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,549
A big thank you
to shorty Morgan's Dixie dolls!

929
00:51:57,684 --> 00:51:59,716
But I know some of
the young people

930
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:02,452
are very excited
about this next act!

931
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,787
Jesse's with us tonight, baby.

932
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:10,361
Play it smart out there, yeah?

933
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:13,761
<i>Well, stop talking about it
we're talking about everything</i>

934
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,837
<i>and do somethin' about it</i>

935
00:52:15,973 --> 00:52:17,703
Elvis Presley!

936
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:21,212
<i>Strange things happening
every day</i>

937
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:26,144
just sing the nice song.
Smile the nice smile.

938
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:27,647
No wiggling.

939
00:52:27,782 --> 00:52:29,677
Then we can get back
to our show business.

940
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,080
And have fun, my boy! Fun!

941
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,661
<i>Oh, we want peace!</i>

942
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:39,763
<i>We want peace!</i>

943
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:42,169
<i>We ought a stop talkin' about
it and do somethin' about it</i>

944
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:46,835
<i>oh, there are strange
things happening</i>

945
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:52,903
<i>every day</i>

946
00:53:11,497 --> 00:53:13,631
There's been a lot of talk
about the new Elvis.

947
00:53:21,536 --> 00:53:23,604
And of course, that other guy.

948
00:53:27,812 --> 00:53:30,445
<i>You ain't
nothin' but a hound dog</i>

949
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,074
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

950
00:53:35,017 --> 00:53:37,248
<i>...At his
command, both civil and other,</i>

951
00:53:37,383 --> 00:53:41,255
<i>to maintain public order,
and prevent crime and riots.</i>

952
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:43,052
<i>He can use those forces...</i>

953
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:46,730
To prevent the racial
integration of schools,

954
00:53:46,865 --> 00:53:50,796
if this is necessary, under the
police powers of that state...

955
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:53,403
There's a lot of people
saying a lot of things.

956
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:55,132
<i>In fact, it is his duty...</i>

957
00:53:55,268 --> 00:53:57,568
Of course you gotta listen
to the people that you love.

958
00:53:57,703 --> 00:54:00,608
<i>...And prevent
turmoil and strife within the state.</i>

959
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:04,407
But in the end,
you gotta listen to yourself.

960
00:54:06,717 --> 00:54:08,678
So I want you to know,
those New York people

961
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:10,414
ain't gonna change me none.

962
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,084
<i>The subversives who own...</i>

963
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,958
control and dominate
the entertainment industry...

964
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:19,704
- "Trouble."
<i>- Are determined...</i>

965
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:22,059
to spread africanized culture...

966
00:54:22,194 --> 00:54:26,403
I'm gonna show you what
the real Elvis is like tonight!

967
00:54:26,538 --> 00:54:28,400
<i>Influencing your children...</i>

968
00:54:28,535 --> 00:54:29,807
To accept the negroes.

969
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,240
<i>If you're looking for trouble</i>

970
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:33,704
- no.
- What's going on?

971
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,269
<i>You came to the right place</i>

972
00:54:36,812 --> 00:54:38,547
<i>if you're looking for trouble</i>

973
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:41,352
<i>just look right in my face</i>

974
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,784
<i>I was born standing up</i>

975
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:48,525
<i>and talking back</i>

976
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:54,590
<i>my daddy was a green-eyed
mountain Jack</i>

977
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:58,926
<i>because I'm evil</i>

978
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:03,000
<i>my middle name is misery</i>

979
00:55:07,144 --> 00:55:10,205
<i>well, I'm evil</i>

980
00:55:11,846 --> 00:55:15,353
<i>so don't you mess around with me</i>

981
00:55:21,857 --> 00:55:23,017
<i>I've never looked for trouble</i>

982
00:55:24,964 --> 00:55:26,496
<i>But I never ran</i>

983
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,664
<i>I don't take no orders</i>

984
00:55:31,104 --> 00:55:32,403
<i>from no kind of man</i>

985
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:35,769
<i>I'm only made out</i>

986
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:38,936
<i>of flesh, blood and bone</i>

987
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:42,607
<i>but if you're gonna
start a rumble</i>

988
00:55:42,743 --> 00:55:45,872
<i>don't you try it on alone</i>

989
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:49,244
<i>because I'm evil</i>

990
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:53,549
<i>my middle name is misery</i>

991
00:55:57,324 --> 00:55:58,356
Elvis!

992
00:55:58,492 --> 00:56:02,928
<i>Well, I'm evil</i>

993
00:56:03,063 --> 00:56:05,668
<i>so don't you mess around with me</i>

994
00:56:09,606 --> 00:56:12,201
<i>I'm evil, evil evil as can be</i>

995
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:16,144
<i>I'm evil evil, evil as can be</i>

996
00:56:17,381 --> 00:56:18,610
<i>So don't mess around</i>

997
00:56:18,746 --> 00:56:20,649
<i>don't mess around with me</i>

998
00:56:21,547 --> 00:56:23,118
<i>I'm evil</i>

999
00:56:24,187 --> 00:56:25,346
<i>I'm evil</i>

1000
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:30,056
<i>Evil, evil</i>

1001
00:56:30,192 --> 00:56:33,897
uh, now would be a good time
to get back into the car.

1002
00:56:34,032 --> 00:56:36,129
<i>I'm evil</i>

1003
00:56:36,265 --> 00:56:37,501
<i>evil</i>

1004
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:39,965
<i>evil</i>

1005
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:46,103
Our friends at rca are not gonna
be happy when they see this.

1006
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,494
<i>He didn't listen to me.</i>

1007
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:06,296
<i>Why?</i>

1008
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:09,594
<i>Why didn't he listen to me?</i>

1009
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,129
<i>I'm evil</i>

1010
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:15,671
get my boy off that stage!

1011
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:18,040
<i>With me</i>

1012
00:57:21,811 --> 00:57:24,806
Get your hands
off him. Hey!

1013
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,946
Hey, Elvis!

1014
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:43,295
Elvis!

1015
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,959
Go look after the merchandise.
Look after the merchandise!

1016
00:57:48,537 --> 00:57:49,803
Elvis, come on!

1017
00:57:49,938 --> 00:57:51,498
Get off of me!
Mama, you get in the car!

1018
00:57:51,538 --> 00:57:53,207
Get in the car!

1019
00:58:02,586 --> 00:58:04,313
You're gonna get us in trouble.

1020
00:58:05,488 --> 00:58:07,050
He's all right, come on.

1021
00:58:07,186 --> 00:58:09,190
- Elvis!
- Scotty, come on.

1022
00:58:09,325 --> 00:58:10,352
Let's go.

1023
00:58:23,632 --> 00:58:27,069
<i>My dear boy had chosen.</i>

1024
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:32,013
<i>You, his audience, his fans.</i>

1025
00:58:32,149 --> 00:58:36,585
<i>He had no idea what
he had done to both of us.</i>

1026
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,249
<i>We warned you, colonel.</i>

1027
00:58:38,385 --> 00:58:40,014
<i>You've lost control
of this act of yours.</i>

1028
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,926
<i>And he's dividing this nation.</i>

1029
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:46,355
<i>There are a lot of people
who want to see him in jail.</i>

1030
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,599
<i>I had to find a way out.</i>

1031
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,602
<i>A way to save him.</i>

1032
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:59,709
<i>Crawfish</i>

1033
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,714
<i>crawfish</i>

1034
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:12,212
no. There's no way my baby's
going to Germany for two years.

1035
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:16,154
It is either the army or jail.

1036
00:59:17,296 --> 00:59:19,223
There is something else.

1037
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,062
Vernon, they are poking
into your background.

1038
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:24,796
We don't have nothin'
to be ashamed of!

1039
00:59:24,931 --> 00:59:26,561
Now, my daddy is a good man.

1040
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,804
Yes, yes.
But your papa did go to jail.

1041
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,909
You know them,
and their flashy headlines.

1042
00:59:33,044 --> 00:59:36,972
"Elvis, the draft dodger."
"A family of delinquents."

1043
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:40,206
<i>There was no moon</i>

1044
00:59:40,342 --> 00:59:44,044
We may never book another
date, or sell another record again.

1045
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,779
And my way of thinking,

1046
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,258
the army could be a
brand new start for all of us.

1047
00:59:48,394 --> 00:59:50,159
<i>Let them cut your hair.</i>

1048
00:59:50,294 --> 00:59:53,426
Prove to the world that you are
a clean-cut, all-American boy.

1049
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:56,491
<i>You do your two years, and when
you come back, I promise you</i>

1050
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,131
<i>I will have done
everything I can</i>

1051
00:59:58,266 --> 01:00:00,966
<i>to make you the biggest
actor in Hollywood.</i>

1052
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:02,739
You will choose
your own pictures.

1053
01:00:04,776 --> 01:00:06,296
It's gonna be okay, mama.

1054
01:00:06,373 --> 01:00:10,742
<i>And I pulled Mr. Crawfish
out of his hole</i>

1055
01:00:10,877 --> 01:00:12,720
<i>Young Mr. Presley,
a rock and roller no more.</i>

1056
01:00:12,744 --> 01:00:15,979
<i>He'll do six months'
basic training at fort Chaffee</i>

1057
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:18,048
<i>before shipping off to Germany.</i>

1058
01:00:19,957 --> 01:00:21,548
<i>Since the day he was born,</i>

1059
01:00:21,683 --> 01:00:24,288
<i>she had feared
losing her second son.</i>

1060
01:00:27,866 --> 01:00:30,030
<i>While he was
in basic training...</i>

1061
01:00:31,096 --> 01:00:33,429
<i>She worried and drank...</i>

1062
01:00:34,933 --> 01:00:36,366
<i>Worried...</i>

1063
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,004
<i>And drank.</i>

1064
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,413
Hey...

1065
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:49,753
Alberta!

1066
01:01:13,511 --> 01:01:15,803
Oh, no...

1067
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:17,407
No!

1068
01:01:21,252 --> 01:01:25,879
There are some fine folks
from the press waiting outside.

1069
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:30,857
A few questions, pictures,
and they will leave us alone.

1070
01:01:30,992 --> 01:01:33,863
I can't get him to do anything.

1071
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,098
He trusted her like nobody else,

1072
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:41,838
and now she's gone
and who does he have now?

1073
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:44,869
Well...

1074
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:48,102
He trusts you.

1075
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:50,242
Can you talk to him?

1076
01:01:51,381 --> 01:01:53,212
Oh, no.

1077
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:56,242
It's not my place...

1078
01:01:56,378 --> 01:01:58,080
Can you do it, colonel?

1079
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,054
We need your help now.

1080
01:02:10,496 --> 01:02:13,095
Your daddy is doing
the best he knows how,

1081
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,264
but he is overwhelmed.

1082
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,571
He needs your help out there.

1083
01:02:18,706 --> 01:02:22,402
I can't go out there.
I just wanna stay here forever.

1084
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,648
Oh, my boy.

1085
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:27,846
No one could never replace her.

1086
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:30,085
But you listen to me.

1087
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:33,285
From this moment on,
anything she would have done...

1088
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,256
I will carry out, in her name.

1089
01:02:37,392 --> 01:02:42,622
When you are overseas,
I will stay here at home.

1090
01:02:42,758 --> 01:02:46,100
And I will work,
and I will worry.

1091
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,763
Trust me.

1092
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:56,169
Now, you go and you stand
by your papa.

1093
01:02:56,304 --> 01:02:57,540
You comfort him.

1094
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:00,343
You comfort him.

1095
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:02,550
Comfort your friends
and your family,

1096
01:03:02,686 --> 01:03:04,720
and even your fans. Hmm?

1097
01:03:04,855 --> 01:03:08,188
Because if you don't do that...

1098
01:03:08,323 --> 01:03:11,152
All that your mama
has sacrificed for you

1099
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,028
will be for nothing.

1100
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:18,496
No matter what happens,

1101
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:21,166
you stay with me
through thick and thin, okay?

1102
01:03:21,302 --> 01:03:24,470
You're like a...
Like a father to me.

1103
01:03:59,572 --> 01:04:02,440
<i>I needed to protect him.</i>

1104
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,577
<i>Even from himself.</i>

1105
01:04:12,948 --> 01:04:16,922
<i>My plan, Elvis Presley
would return</i>

1106
01:04:17,058 --> 01:04:21,327
<i>a clean-cut, all-American boy.</i>

1107
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:23,901
<i>But...</i>

1108
01:04:26,397 --> 01:04:27,696
<i>I did not consider</i>

1109
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:30,237
<i>the most dangerous thing of all.</i>

1110
01:04:32,774 --> 01:04:34,704
<i>Love.</i>

1111
01:04:44,752 --> 01:04:47,188
<i>Priscilla,
the pretty teenage daughter</i>

1112
01:04:47,324 --> 01:04:50,719
<i>of a United States
air force officer.</i>

1113
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:55,123
And then he said to me...

1114
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,407
"You know what, Priscilla?

1115
01:04:58,431 --> 01:05:00,126
You gotta listen to me, sweetie,

1116
01:05:00,262 --> 01:05:02,731
because this guy, he's got
girls all over the world, okay?

1117
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:04,514
He's got girls waiting
outside of his house

1118
01:05:04,538 --> 01:05:06,333
and girls writing him
endless fan mail."

1119
01:05:06,468 --> 01:05:08,783
And then
mommy decides to pitch in and go,

1120
01:05:08,807 --> 01:05:10,980
"ooh, what could he possibly
see in you, okay?

1121
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,878
What do you two do
up there all night?"

1122
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:14,380
And...

1123
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:19,045
And I just said, "mom, dad...

1124
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,391
We talk and we listen
to music, okay? That's all."

1125
01:05:22,526 --> 01:05:24,820
And then they were going on
and on about that photo of you

1126
01:05:24,956 --> 01:05:27,424
and Natalie wood riding around
on that bike in Memphis,

1127
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:29,925
and...
And then what I said...

1128
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,301
And I said this really calmly,
I said, "listen, okay?

1129
01:05:33,436 --> 01:05:37,634
He's just really lonely.
And quite frankly, so am I."

1130
01:05:39,774 --> 01:05:42,275
And then they didn't really
know what to say after that,

1131
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:45,747
so I went upstairs
and I went to bed.

1132
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:48,309
Never met anyone like you.

1133
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,613
Well, I hope not.

1134
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:54,992
So... what
is Natalie wood like?

1135
01:05:56,288 --> 01:05:57,785
She's nice, you know.

1136
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,522
She's been writing me
about acting.

1137
01:05:59,658 --> 01:06:01,830
I've been asking her
stories about...

1138
01:06:01,966 --> 01:06:04,025
Working with James Dean and...

1139
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:06,361
God, I just hope to one day
be as good as him, you know?

1140
01:06:06,438 --> 01:06:07,438
Mmm.

1141
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,774
Colonel's promised me
that when I get back

1142
01:06:14,909 --> 01:06:17,278
he's gonna set me up in
Hollywood to be a serious actor.

1143
01:06:20,446 --> 01:06:23,879
That's really what I dream of.

1144
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:27,219
Hey, e.P., e.P.,
now, you promised the captain

1145
01:06:27,355 --> 01:06:29,816
that you'd get her home
by 7:00.

1146
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:31,758
Hey, Charlie.
What's that behind you?

1147
01:06:31,893 --> 01:06:33,393
What? No...

1148
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,429
He don't boss me around.

1149
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:53,743
You know, I think
if you dream it, you'll do it.

1150
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:56,383
You do?

1151
01:06:57,819 --> 01:07:00,357
Yeah.

1152
01:07:02,221 --> 01:07:06,360
<i>Shall I stay?</i>

1153
01:07:08,162 --> 01:07:13,532
<i>Would it be a sin</i>

1154
01:07:16,037 --> 01:07:21,701
<i>if I can't help</i>

1155
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:28,118
<i>falling in love with you?</i>

1156
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,392
<i>You no longer
want to sing in your films,</i>

1157
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,491
<i>is that right? You want
to be a dramatic actor.</i>

1158
01:07:36,627 --> 01:07:38,624
<i>Well, sir, that's
my big ambition now.</i>

1159
01:07:38,759 --> 01:07:41,790
<i>It takes a lot of time,
a lot of experience.</i>

1160
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:45,797
<i>He was as good as Brando.</i>

1161
01:07:45,933 --> 01:07:50,140
<i>But you didn't want to see him
in movies where he didn't sing.</i>

1162
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,886
<i>A little less conversation</i>

1163
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:54,443
<i>a little more action</i>

1164
01:07:54,578 --> 01:07:58,581
<i>all this aggravation
ain't satisfactioning me</i>

1165
01:07:58,716 --> 01:08:04,781
<i>Thanks to me, his life
became one big Hollywood movie!</i>

1166
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,588
<i>Starring Priscilla...</i>

1167
01:08:07,724 --> 01:08:09,826
<i>Bright light city
gonna set my soul</i>

1168
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:12,362
<i>gonna set my soul on fire</i>

1169
01:08:12,498 --> 01:08:15,798
<i>And a cast
of his "buddies" and "cousins."</i>

1170
01:08:15,933 --> 01:08:17,793
<i>His Memphis mafia.</i>

1171
01:08:17,929 --> 01:08:19,966
<i>So get those stakes up higher</i>

1172
01:08:20,101 --> 01:08:23,899
<i>there's a thousand pretty
women waitin' out there</i>

1173
01:08:24,035 --> 01:08:27,001
<i>and they're all livin'
the devil may care</i>

1174
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:30,405
<i>and I'm just the devil
with love to spare, so</i>

1175
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,150
<i>viva, Las Vegas</i>

1176
01:08:34,782 --> 01:08:36,979
<i>There was that
fairytale wedding.</i>

1177
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,848
<i>And the honeymoon
on frank Sinatra's jet.</i>

1178
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:44,154
<i>And introducing baby Lisa Marie.</i>

1179
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:49,062
<i>I made him the highest paid
actor in Hollywood history.</i>

1180
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:50,662
<i>We had a lot of fun!</i>

1181
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,368
<i>But Elvis was a young man,</i>

1182
01:08:54,503 --> 01:08:56,865
<i>and of course,
he got distracted.</i>

1183
01:08:57,001 --> 01:09:02,003
<i>So we made them faster
and cheaper.</i>

1184
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:03,859
<i>Beatlemania sweeps america,</i>

1185
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:06,711
<i>as teens turn their attention
to the teenage rockers.</i>

1186
01:09:08,783 --> 01:09:11,214
<i>Is it my fault
the world changed?</i>

1187
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:17,451
<i>Good evening.
Dr. Martin Luther King,</i>

1188
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:20,527
<i>the apostle of non-violence
in the civil rights movement,</i>

1189
01:09:20,663 --> 01:09:22,957
<i>has been shot to death

1190
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:42,275
<i>New Elvis stinker
bombs, another flop.</i>

1191
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,784
<i>There's no more appetite
for Presley pictures.</i>

1192
01:09:45,919 --> 01:09:48,423
<i>It don't matter
how hard I worked,</i>

1193
01:09:48,558 --> 01:09:51,290
<i>how many snow jobs

1194
01:09:51,426 --> 01:09:53,390

01:09:53,525 --> 01:09:55,761
<i>My boy loved to spend.</i>

1196

<i>And with them hillbillies
around him,</i>

1197
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:01,600
<i>the money would just melt away.</i>

1198
01:10:01,736 --> 01:10:04,304
With the sale of the ranch
and the horses,

1199
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:05,801
that's gonna cover the payroll,

1200
01:10:05,937 --> 01:10:08,168
but as for the security
at Graceland...

1201
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,182
<i>Officers also reportedly chased</i>

1202
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,838
<i>and fired on

<i>Dr. King was standing

01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:18,383
<i>of his second floor
hotel room tonight,</i>

1206
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:20,356
<i>when, according to a companion,</i>

1207
01:10:20,492 --> 01:10:22,787
<i>a shot was fired
from across the street.</i>

1208
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,721
Dr. King.

1209
01:10:24,857 --> 01:10:25,719
Uncle Vernon, come quick!

1210
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,060
He always spoke the truth.

1211
01:10:27,196 --> 01:10:29,028
What happened?

1212
01:10:29,163 --> 01:10:31,072
<i>They rushed the 39-year-old
negro leader to a hospital,</i>

1213
01:10:31,096 --> 01:10:33,632
<i>where he died of a bullet wound
in the neck.</i>

1214
01:10:33,768 --> 01:10:35,195
<i>Jingle, jingles...</i>

1215
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,535
<i>Here comes Santa claus
here comes Santa claus</i>

1216
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:39,937
<i>right down Santa claus Lane</i>

1217
01:10:40,072 --> 01:10:41,977
<i>Vixen and blitzen
and all the reindeer</i>

1218
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:43,644
<i>pulling on the rein</i>

1219
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:45,848
Elvis Presley's
<i>wonderful world of Christmas.</i>

1220
01:10:45,983 --> 01:10:47,007
Brought to you by

1221
01:10:47,143 --> 01:10:48,943
the singer sewing machine
company,

1222
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,153
to every television set
in america.

1223
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,185
It only takes three days
to tape,

1224
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:54,321
and there's no audience.

1225
01:10:54,423 --> 01:10:56,153
<i>Violence breeds violence,</i>

1226
01:10:56,289 --> 01:10:58,033
<i>- repression breeds retaliation.</i>
- ...Christmas sweater.

1227
01:10:58,057 --> 01:11:01,256
Made on the new singer,
home knitting apparatus.

1228
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:04,432
- Memphis is burning.
<i>- And to fear his brother.</i>

1229
01:11:04,568 --> 01:11:06,997
<i>When you teach
that he is a lesser man</i>

1230
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:09,669
<i>because of his color
or his beliefs...</i>

1231
01:11:09,804 --> 01:11:11,572
...Dreaming
of a white Christmas,

1232
01:11:11,707 --> 01:11:14,801
because, oh,
it's definitely going to snow.

1233
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,609
Christmas special.

1234
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:18,677
Is this the best we can do,
admiral?

1235
01:11:18,812 --> 01:11:20,774
Well, we took
the Hollywood phonies

1236
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,342
for every nickel they had

1237
01:11:22,477 --> 01:11:24,749
and now it is time
for us to pack up our tents

1238
01:11:24,885 --> 01:11:26,781
and move on
to even greener pastures.

1239
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:28,455
We've seen "Elvis the rebel,"

1240
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:30,327
we've seen
"Elvis the movie star."

1241
01:11:30,462 --> 01:11:33,962
Now we will see
"Elvis the family entertainer."

1242
01:11:34,098 --> 01:11:35,530
And appliance salesman?

1243
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,764
What did you say?

1244
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,298
Listen, Jerry,
I don't need you to question me

1245
01:11:42,434 --> 01:11:45,501
about how I support my family
and every goddamn person here.

1246
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:47,169
You understand me?

1247
01:11:47,305 --> 01:11:49,225
If you don't like it,
you can go back to Memphis.

1248
01:11:51,346 --> 01:11:52,910
Laugh it up, assholes.

1249
01:12:09,193 --> 01:12:10,665
<i>What a beautiful rendition</i>

1250
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,032
<i>of "here comes Santa claus"
that was,</i>

1251
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:16,473
<i>with all the sparkle and magic
that the season brings.</i>

1252
01:12:16,608 --> 01:12:18,508
<i>And you'll be even warmer
this season</i>

1253
01:12:18,643 --> 01:12:21,075
<i>in a 12 Gauge
cable-knit woolen sweater...</i>

1254
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,409
- Satnin?
- Hi.

1255
01:12:23,545 --> 01:12:25,686
<i>Made right at home on the
singer sewer sk155 home knitter.</i>

1256
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,213
<i>And now, here's Elvis!</i>

1257
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,219
Can I watch the memorial
with you?

1258
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:35,689
Yeah, baby.

1259
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:46,201
I'm so tired of playing
Elvis Presley.

1260
01:12:46,336 --> 01:12:48,696
Too many people rely on me.

1261
01:12:52,075 --> 01:12:53,703
I love you.

1262
01:12:53,838 --> 01:12:55,610
And your daughter loves you.

1263
01:12:58,276 --> 01:13:00,380
We don't care about the money
or anything else.

1264
01:13:00,516 --> 01:13:02,209
We just want you to be happy.

1265
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,053
<i>Lord, hold my hand</i>

1266
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:05,887
<i>and don't let me fall</i>

1267
01:13:06,022 --> 01:13:09,453
you're only really happy when
you sing the music you love.

1268
01:13:09,588 --> 01:13:13,490
<i>Oh</i>

1269
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:16,889
<i>Take my hand</i>

1270
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:19,798
Mahalia Jackson.

1271
01:13:19,934 --> 01:13:22,605
I used to hear her sing
at east street church.

1272
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,968
<i>Got a feelin' in my body</i>

1273
01:13:26,104 --> 01:13:28,100
that's the music
that makes me happy.

1274
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:33,714
<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

1275
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:38,311
so when things are too
dangerous to say... sing!

1276
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:48,832
<i>When Moses walked the children
out of Egypt land</i>

1277
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:53,334
<i>he said "now don't you worry
we're in the lord's hands"</i>

1278
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:57,305
<i>I got a feelin' in my body</i>

1279
01:13:57,441 --> 01:14:00,510
<i>this will be our lucky day</i>

1280
01:14:04,012 --> 01:14:07,976
<i>we'll be released
from all our sorrow</i>

1281
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:11,213
<i>leave it layin' along the way</i>

1282
01:14:19,492 --> 01:14:22,357
<i>You gotta meet these
binder and bones guys, e.P.</i>

1283
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:23,773
<i>They're the ones
that put James brown,</i>

1284
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:26,295
<i>the rolling stones onstage.</i>

1285
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:28,097
<i>They're doing some
cutting edge stuff.</i>

1286
01:14:28,233 --> 01:14:32,366
Mr. Binder, Mr. Howe...
Thanks for coming.

1287
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:50,885
When I first came
to Hollywood, I'd come up here

1288
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:53,253
and sit for hours.

1289
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:55,059
Right over there,
the observatory...

1290
01:14:55,195 --> 01:14:57,900
That's where they shot
<i>rebel without a cause.</i>

1291
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:02,997
Man, I used to dream of being
a great actor like Jimmy Dean.

1292
01:15:03,133 --> 01:15:05,201
This sign was beautiful then.

1293
01:15:07,474 --> 01:15:09,339
And now...

1294
01:15:09,475 --> 01:15:12,345
Feels as though lots of things
are like that these days.

1295
01:15:12,481 --> 01:15:15,409
Broke down, beat up.

1296
01:15:16,251 --> 01:15:17,251
Rotten.

1297
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:21,349
I really like what you guys did,

1298
01:15:21,484 --> 01:15:23,921
putting James brown
and the stones together.

1299
01:15:24,057 --> 01:15:27,488
We're, uh...
Big fans of yours, too.

1300
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:30,032
It's just that, Mr. Presley,
we don't usually...

1301
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:31,429
Oh, Elvis.

1302
01:15:31,564 --> 01:15:32,998
Elvis, uh...

1303
01:15:34,629 --> 01:15:37,268
Christmas specials
aren't really our thing.

1304
01:15:37,404 --> 01:15:38,608
I know.

1305
01:15:40,509 --> 01:15:42,778
Tell me, honestly...

1306
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:45,274
Where do you boys
think my career's at right now?

1307
01:15:47,218 --> 01:15:48,910
Well, it's...

1308
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:51,753
It's in the toilet, Elvis.

1309
01:15:57,394 --> 01:15:59,928
You hear that, Jerry?

1310
01:16:00,064 --> 01:16:03,259
Oh, lord. I knew you were
the right guys for this job.

1311
01:16:03,394 --> 01:16:05,733
You know,
back when I was starting out,

1312
01:16:05,868 --> 01:16:08,264
some people wanted
to put me in jail,

1313
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:11,564
even kill me,
'cause of the way I was moving.

1314
01:16:13,773 --> 01:16:15,337
So they cut my hair,

1315
01:16:15,473 --> 01:16:18,340
they put me in uniform
and they sent me away.

1316
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:22,982
That killed my mother.

1317
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:27,954
And ever since then...

1318
01:16:29,754 --> 01:16:30,990
I've been lost.

1319
01:16:33,425 --> 01:16:36,160
And when you're lost,
people take advantage.

1320
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,595
I need you fellas to help me
get back to who I really am.

1321
01:16:43,869 --> 01:16:45,103
And who are you, Elvis?

1322
01:16:47,804 --> 01:16:49,951
I sure as hell ain't somebody
who sings Christmas songs

1323
01:16:49,975 --> 01:16:52,780
by a fireplace for an hour.

1324
01:16:52,915 --> 01:16:55,377
And what does the colonel think?

1325
01:16:55,512 --> 01:16:57,786
I don't give a damn
what the colonel thinks.

1326
01:17:13,001 --> 01:17:14,662
For this television special,

1327
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:17,468
we've got this bindle fella,
number one hotshot director.

1328
01:17:17,603 --> 01:17:20,373
Elvis will be humoring him by
doing a few of his fresh ideas.

1329
01:17:20,508 --> 01:17:22,072
Ah, the sweater!

1330
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:24,804
To Mr. Presley's
dressing room, please.

1331
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:28,309
We are going to sing three
spectacular Christmas songs

1332
01:17:28,445 --> 01:17:30,511
in that very sweater.

1333
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:35,481
Now, when that sign lights up,
what do you do?

1334
01:17:35,616 --> 01:17:37,056
Applause.

1335
01:17:40,965 --> 01:17:43,324
"Silent is the night"
and "deck the halls,"

1336
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,802
and, uh...
"Whose child is this?"

1337
01:17:46,938 --> 01:17:48,836
<i>You think we can do some gospel?</i>

1338
01:17:48,971 --> 01:17:50,505
Well, if you want
to find yourself,

1339
01:17:50,641 --> 01:17:52,238
first thing you do is go home.

1340
01:17:52,374 --> 01:17:55,773
Metaphorically, you know.
Get back to who you really are.

1341
01:17:55,909 --> 01:17:57,873
And what is the boy that...

1342
01:17:58,008 --> 01:17:59,657
- oh, "the little drummer boy"?
- Yes, "the little drumming boy."

1343
01:17:59,681 --> 01:18:01,246
Oh, the... with the...

1344
01:18:01,381 --> 01:18:03,282
<i>We get your old band
back together.</i>

1345
01:18:03,418 --> 01:18:07,181
But we are going to start with
"here comes Santa claus,"

1346
01:18:07,317 --> 01:18:09,089
isn't that right, Mr. Bindle?

1347
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:10,734
Uh, the Christmas specials
come later in the show.

1348
01:18:10,758 --> 01:18:12,125
Can you bring up two?

1349
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,196
<i>A leather jacket.
Raw, dirty.</i>

1350
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:17,358
Remember, ladies and gentlemen,
this is television, not radio,

1351
01:18:17,494 --> 01:18:18,964
so when that goes up
and you clap,

1352
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,460
let's see it
on your faces as well.

1353
01:18:21,829 --> 01:18:23,109
<i>But you need an audience.</i>

1354
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:24,731
<i>Audience?</i>

1355
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,780
- Bring it over to one.
<i>- At any second now,</i>

1356
01:18:26,804 --> 01:18:28,783
Elvis is gonna walk onto this
stage and perform just for you.

1357
01:18:28,807 --> 01:18:30,986
<i>I ain't sang in front
of an audience in a long time.</i>

1358
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:32,408
<i>That's my point.</i>

1359
01:18:32,544 --> 01:18:35,548
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Elvis Presley!

1360
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:16,254
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

1361
01:19:16,389 --> 01:19:18,917
<i>well, I found a new place
to dwell</i>

1362
01:19:19,053 --> 01:19:20,957
<i>well, it's down at the end
of lonely street</i>

1363
01:19:21,093 --> 01:19:23,426
<i>at heartbreak hotel</i>

1364
01:19:23,561 --> 01:19:27,029
<i>where I'll be
I'll be so lonely, baby</i>

1365
01:19:27,164 --> 01:19:29,464
<i>I'll be so lonely</i>

1366
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,437
<i>I'll be so lonely I could die</i>

1367
01:19:33,572 --> 01:19:36,637
<i>well, the bellhop's tears
keep flowin'</i>

1368
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:39,311
<i>and the desk clerk's
dressed in black</i>

1369
01:19:39,447 --> 01:19:41,808
<i>well, they've been so long
on lonely street</i>

1370
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:45,587
<i>well, they'll never
they'll never look back</i>

1371
01:19:45,723 --> 01:19:47,753
<i>they'll be so lonely, baby</i>

1372
01:19:47,889 --> 01:19:50,353
<i>they'll be so lonely</i>

1373
01:19:50,489 --> 01:19:52,758
<i>they'll be so lonely
they could die</i>

1374
01:19:56,161 --> 01:19:59,528
Well, that was... energetic.

1375
01:20:01,698 --> 01:20:04,330
<i>You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog</i>

1376
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,402
<i>snoopin' at my door</i>

1377
01:20:06,538 --> 01:20:09,038
<i>you ain't nothin'
but a hound dog</i>

1378
01:20:09,174 --> 01:20:11,705
<i>cryin' all the time</i>

1379
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,473
<i>well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit</i>

1380
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:16,215
<i>you ain't no friend of mine</i>

1381
01:20:16,947 --> 01:20:17,947
come on!

1382
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:21,350
Colonel...

1383
01:20:21,486 --> 01:20:23,556
Is "here comes
Santa claus" next?

1384
01:20:23,691 --> 01:20:25,251
Absolutely.

1385
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,888
I see no reason why not.

1386
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:31,628
He's not in the swe... he's not
even wearing the sweater.

1387
01:20:31,763 --> 01:20:34,728
<i>Well, it's one for the money
two for the show</i>

1388
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,830
<i>three to get ready
now go, cat, go</i>

1389
01:20:36,966 --> 01:20:41,337
<i>but don't you
step on my blue suede shoes</i>

1390
01:20:41,473 --> 01:20:43,544
I do not know what is going on.

1391
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,979
Singing "hound dog"?

1392
01:20:45,115 --> 01:20:46,916
What does that have to do
with Christmas?

1393
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:49,512
<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
yeah</i>

1394
01:20:49,647 --> 01:20:52,053
<i>blue, blue, blue suede shoes
baby</i>

1395
01:20:52,188 --> 01:20:54,020
<i>blue, blue, blue suede shoes
yeah</i>

1396
01:20:54,156 --> 01:20:56,020
<i>blue, blue blue suede shoes</i>

1397
01:20:56,156 --> 01:20:57,586
<i>well, you can do anything</i>

1398
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:00,028
<i>but lay off of my
blue suede shoes</i>

1399
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:06,091
Young man, you tell them

1400
01:21:06,227 --> 01:21:08,044
it's time for "here comes
Santa claus." I said so. Now!

1401
01:21:08,068 --> 01:21:09,862
All right. First positions!

1402
01:21:12,671 --> 01:21:15,067
<i>Warden threw a party
in the county jail</i>

1403
01:21:15,202 --> 01:21:17,575
<i>the prison band was there
and they began to wail</i>

1404
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:20,613
<i>the band was jumping
and the joint began to swing</i>

1405
01:21:20,749 --> 01:21:22,749
<i>you should a heard those
knocked out jailbirds sing</i>

1406
01:21:22,849 --> 01:21:27,219
<i>let's rock all right,
everybody, let's rock</i>

1407
01:21:27,354 --> 01:21:30,156
<i>everybody in the whole
cell block</i>

1408
01:21:30,291 --> 01:21:32,758
<i>was dancing to the
jailhouse rock</i>

1409
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:37,763
<i>dancing to the jailhouse rock
dancing to the jailhouse rock</i>

1410
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:41,733
<i>dancing to the jailhouse rock
dancing to the jailhouse rock</i>

1411
01:21:43,036 --> 01:21:45,739
<i>They were dancin'</i>

1412
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:47,972
<i>well, they were dancin'</i>

1413
01:21:48,108 --> 01:21:50,938
<i>to the jailhouse rock</i>

1414
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,575
hah!

1415
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:54,742
All right.

1416
01:22:00,857 --> 01:22:03,788
It's been a long time, baby.

1417
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:05,489
A long time.

1418
01:22:21,939 --> 01:22:23,587
<i>Well, I like a lot
of the new groups,</i>

1419
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:26,846
<i>you know, the Beatles
and the byrds, but,</i>

1420
01:22:26,982 --> 01:22:29,843
a lot of it is basically...

1421
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:31,984
Rock and roll music
is basically, uh...

1422
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:34,289
Gospel or rhythm and blues.

1423
01:22:34,425 --> 01:22:38,325
Well, that's one thing about
this TV special that I'm doing,

1424
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:41,159
<i>they're gonna let me do
what I want to do.</i>

1425
01:22:41,294 --> 01:22:43,356
<i>Sing the music that I want.</i>

1426
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:45,034
Music that I love.

1427
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,533
Music that makes me happy.

1428
01:22:55,744 --> 01:23:00,149
<i>Those know-it-all
hippies had brainwashed Elvis,</i>

1429
01:23:00,284 --> 01:23:02,811
<i>acting like he was
one of them radicals,</i>

1430
01:23:02,947 --> 01:23:05,677
<i>throwing his career away
to sing spirituals</i>

1431
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:07,320
<i>with a bunch of longhairs.</i>

1432
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,057
Bindle...

1433
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:18,712
- Cue the gospel number now. Go.
- "Here comes Santa claus."

1434
01:23:18,736 --> 01:23:20,593
<i>Up above my head</i>

1435
01:23:22,973 --> 01:23:25,604
<i>There is music in the air</i>

1436
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:26,839
no.

1437
01:23:26,975 --> 01:23:28,737
<i>Up above my head</i>

1438
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,380
all right, none of this
will be in the special.

1439
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:35,676
Can you make a note that
that should be in the special?

1440
01:23:37,754 --> 01:23:41,380
Okay, now let's segue straight
into the whorehouse dancers. Go!

1441
01:23:41,515 --> 01:23:43,686
Whorehouse? No.

1442
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:48,597
Now bring in
the kung fu spectacular.

1443
01:23:48,733 --> 01:23:51,928
What? Kung fu?

1444
01:23:52,063 --> 01:23:54,036
<i>If you ever take
a trip down to the ocean</i>

1445
01:23:54,171 --> 01:23:56,931
<i>find yourself down around mobile</i>

1446
01:23:57,067 --> 01:23:59,404
This has nothing
to do with Christmas!

1447
01:23:59,539 --> 01:24:01,671
You'll be hearing
from our lawyers.

1448
01:24:01,807 --> 01:24:03,487
But, we still have
"here comes Santa claus"!

1449
01:24:03,511 --> 01:24:05,610
Santa claus is bringing you
a lawsuit!

1450
01:24:05,745 --> 01:24:07,050
<i>Digging the finest
little five-piece group</i>

1451
01:24:07,074 --> 01:24:09,042
<i>up and down the Gulf of Mexico</i>

1452
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:10,917
<i>guess who's leading
that five-piece band</i>

1453
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:12,451
<i>well, wouldn't you know</i>

1454
01:24:12,587 --> 01:24:14,313
<i>it's that swinging little
guitar man</i>

1455
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:18,953
<i>I got a feelin' in my body

1456
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:22,660
<i>just put your arms around me
real tight</i>

1457
01:24:22,795 --> 01:24:25,726
<i>we'll be released

1458
01:24:25,862 --> 01:24:27,967
<i>leave it layin' along the way</i>

1459
01:24:28,102 --> 01:24:31,800
<i>well, I'm the king of the jungle

1460
01:24:31,936 --> 01:24:35,668
<i>I got a...

1461
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,646
<i>this will be our lucky day</i>

1462
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:42,714
Bobby Kennedy been shot!

1463
01:24:42,849 --> 01:24:44,826
Bobby Kennedy's
been shot, everybody!

1464
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:47,146
<i>Senator Kennedy has been shot.</i>

1465
01:24:47,281 --> 01:24:50,586
<i>Oh, my god.
Senator Kennedy has been shot.</i>

1466
01:24:52,693 --> 01:24:54,628
<i>Get the gun. Get the gun.</i>

1467
01:24:54,764 --> 01:24:57,094
<i>Take a hold of his thumb
and break it if you have to!</i>

1468
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:58,458
<i>Get his gun!</i>

1469
01:24:58,594 --> 01:24:59,960
We're ready on set.

1470
01:25:02,035 --> 01:25:03,233
Oh, my god.

1471
01:25:13,247 --> 01:25:16,809
<i>Senator Kennedy
was involved in a shooting,</i>

1472
01:25:16,944 --> 01:25:18,978
<i>that a newsman was involved,</i>

1473
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:20,952
<i>and that one other man
was involved.</i>

1474
01:25:21,087 --> 01:25:24,051
<i>There are now three doctors
back there caring for them.</i>

1475
01:25:24,187 --> 01:25:26,107
Steve,
we gotta get back to work.

1476
01:25:26,192 --> 01:25:28,192
Work?

1477
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:29,602
<i>Amount of blood
on the floor of this anteroom.</i>

1478
01:25:29,626 --> 01:25:32,459
<i>Ice is now being, uh, brought...</i>

1479
01:25:35,665 --> 01:25:38,240
Listen, I, uh...

1480
01:25:39,768 --> 01:25:41,038
I just want to say that...

1481
01:25:42,607 --> 01:25:44,846
That this nation is hurting.

1482
01:25:44,982 --> 01:25:47,314
It's lost. You know? It...

1483
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:51,319
It needs a voice right now
to help it heal.

1484
01:25:53,485 --> 01:25:55,114
We have to say something.

1485
01:25:56,253 --> 01:25:57,785
You...

1486
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,788
Have to make
a statement, e.P.

1487
01:26:00,924 --> 01:26:04,494
Mr. Presley does not
make statements.

1488
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:08,462
He sings
"here comes Santa claus"

1489
01:26:08,598 --> 01:26:10,170
and wishes everyone,

1490
01:26:10,305 --> 01:26:12,835
"merry Christmas
and good night."

1491
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:16,510
<i>Senator Kennedy's
press secretary</i>

1492
01:26:16,645 --> 01:26:18,744
<i>was made roughly an hour
and a half ago.</i>

1493
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,745
<i>Some five to ten minutes later,
the operation began.</i>

1494
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,253
<i>The six-man team
of neurosurgeons</i>

1495
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:25,857
<i>probing for the bullet
that had lodged</i>

1496
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:27,554
<i>in senator Kennedy's brain.</i>

1497
01:26:27,690 --> 01:26:29,925
<i>No report yet
as to how that operation...</i>

1498
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,085
Poor Mrs. Kennedy.

1499
01:26:32,862 --> 01:26:33,889
This tragedy...

1500
01:26:34,864 --> 01:26:36,890
A tragedy.

1501
01:26:37,026 --> 01:26:39,360
But it has nothing
to do with us.

1502
01:26:39,495 --> 01:26:42,961
<i>The white house
has reacted to the shooting...</i>

1503
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:45,235
It has everything to do with us.

1504
01:26:45,371 --> 01:26:48,774
No, I just do not think

1505
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:52,039
we should be making speeches
about politics and religion.

1506
01:26:52,175 --> 01:26:54,712
Dr. King was shot
eight miles from Graceland

1507
01:26:54,847 --> 01:26:58,420
while I was out here
singing to turtles.

1508
01:26:58,556 --> 01:27:00,681
And now this, and all you can
think about is how many

1509
01:27:00,816 --> 01:27:02,883
goddamn sweaters I can sell?

1510
01:27:03,018 --> 01:27:04,854
I am a promoter.
That is what I do.

1511
01:27:04,989 --> 01:27:07,286
And I'm Elvis Presley.
That's what I do.

1512
01:27:07,421 --> 01:27:10,065
Well, Mr. Bindle has really
gotten inside your head

1513
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,060
with all of his hippie friends.

1514
01:27:12,195 --> 01:27:14,298
You actually think that
you singing your old songs

1515
01:27:14,434 --> 01:27:16,096
dressed in black leather,

1516
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:19,070
sweating, mumbling incoherently
to the audience

1517
01:27:19,205 --> 01:27:20,640
was a good show?

1518
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:22,672
Colonel, I know when
I've excited an audience.

1519
01:27:22,808 --> 01:27:25,247
That was not a real audience,
my boy.

1520
01:27:25,382 --> 01:27:27,281
There was a sign
flashing "applaud,"

1521
01:27:27,417 --> 01:27:29,076
telling them
when to clap for you.

1522
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:32,013
This entire jamboree
is an embarrassment.

1523
01:27:33,423 --> 01:27:34,743
You have embarrassed
the sponsors,

1524
01:27:34,785 --> 01:27:35,985
you have embarrassed yourself,

1525
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:37,567
you have embarrassed me.

1526
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:40,119
Now, you can sing whatever songs

1527
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:43,422
you and Mr. Bindle choose
for 55 minutes,

1528
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:46,863
but at the end of the show,
there will be a Christmas song.

1529
01:27:48,269 --> 01:27:51,164
Or else we will be sued.

1530
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:54,576
No, you will be sued
for breach of contract,

1531
01:27:54,712 --> 01:27:58,012
because I will no longer be
the promoter of your career.

1532
01:27:58,148 --> 01:27:59,777
I will have to leave you.

1533
01:28:01,917 --> 01:28:02,917
Hmm.

1534
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:06,850
Mmm-hmm.

1535
01:28:15,762 --> 01:28:17,356
Now, I have convinced
our friends

1536
01:28:17,491 --> 01:28:19,859
at singer sewing machines
to come back tomorrow

1537
01:28:19,995 --> 01:28:22,327
for "here comes Santa claus."

1538
01:28:22,462 --> 01:28:25,797
I will see you in the morning,
Mr. Presley.

1539
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:27,473
Oh, and as I recall,

1540
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:30,036
Dr. King said
rock and roll music

1541
01:28:30,172 --> 01:28:32,843
contributed
to juvenile delinquency.

1542
01:28:32,979 --> 01:28:34,326
<i>It would be wrong,</i>

1543
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:35,710
<i>it would be self-deceptive</i>

1544
01:28:35,845 --> 01:28:37,518
<i>to ignore the connection</i>

1545
01:28:37,653 --> 01:28:39,846
<i>between that lawlessness
and hatred</i>

1546
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:42,090
<i>and this act of violence.</i>

1547
01:28:42,226 --> 01:28:43,989
<i>It would be just as wrong</i>

1548
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:47,329
<i>and just as self-deceptive
to conclude from this act</i>

1549
01:28:47,464 --> 01:28:49,824
<i>that our country itself is sick,</i>

1550
01:28:49,959 --> 01:28:51,565
<i>that it's lost its balance,</i>

1551
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:54,168
<i>that it's lost its sense
of direction,</i>

1552
01:28:54,303 --> 01:28:56,400
<i>even its common decency.</i>

1553
01:28:56,536 --> 01:28:58,167
<i>200 million Americans</i>

1554
01:28:58,303 --> 01:29:01,504
<i>did not strike down
Robert Kennedy last night,</i>

1555
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,005
<i>any more than they struck down</i>

1556
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:07,143
<i>President John F. Kennedy
in 1963,</i>

1557
01:29:07,278 --> 01:29:10,513
<i>or Dr. Martin Luther King
in April of this year.</i>

1558
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:13,048
<i>My fellow citizens, we cannot,</i>

1559
01:29:13,183 --> 01:29:15,651
<i>we just must not tolerate
the sway</i>

1560
01:29:15,786 --> 01:29:17,890
<i>of violent men among us.</i>

1561
01:29:18,026 --> 01:29:21,859
<i>We must not permit men
that are filled with hate...</i>

1562
01:29:30,903 --> 01:29:35,202
<i>Here comes Santa claus</i>

1563
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:42,979
<i>here comes Santa claus</i>

1564
01:29:44,354 --> 01:29:48,655
<i>right down Santa claus...</i>

1565
01:29:56,194 --> 01:29:59,467
We're pretty set for the number
tomorrow, right, e.P.?

1566
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:02,537
<i>It's pretty familiar territory,
right?</i>

1567
01:30:04,934 --> 01:30:07,102
A reverend once told me...

1568
01:30:09,239 --> 01:30:12,107
"When things are too dangerous
to say...

1569
01:30:14,775 --> 01:30:16,452
Sing."

1570
01:30:39,638 --> 01:30:45,338
<i>There must be lights
burning brighter somewhere</i>

1571
01:30:46,847 --> 01:30:51,152
<i>got to be birds flying higher</i>

1572
01:30:51,287 --> 01:30:54,749
<i>in a sky more blue</i>

1573
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:59,327
Standing by.
We're seconds away, folks.

1574
01:30:59,462 --> 01:31:00,959
We're just waiting on upstairs.

1575
01:31:01,094 --> 01:31:03,488
We're gonna get a rehearsal
going very shortly.

1576
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:06,266
Let's go, let's go, people!
First positions!

1577
01:31:06,402 --> 01:31:07,933
Here we go, from the top.

1578
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:11,197
Mrs. Presley is quite
the homemaker, Priscilla is,

1579
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:12,774
and I'm sure
she would love to have

1580
01:31:12,909 --> 01:31:16,039
one of the sk551 machines
so she can knit Elvis's...

1581
01:31:16,174 --> 01:31:18,340
- They were in there all night.
- Doing what?

1582
01:31:18,475 --> 01:31:20,490
He's working on a new song.
He says he's singing it.

1583
01:31:20,514 --> 01:31:22,145
New song? Whoa, hey!

1584
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,714
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas. Yes!

1585
01:31:24,849 --> 01:31:26,687
Gentlemen, take your seats.

1586
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:32,059
Now, that's a winter wonderland.

1587
01:31:32,194 --> 01:31:33,727
Mr. Bindle.

1588
01:31:33,862 --> 01:31:38,895
You and I are
on the same page at last.

1589
01:31:39,031 --> 01:31:40,762
Bring up the lights on the sign.

1590
01:31:40,897 --> 01:31:43,397
Okay, yeah. Let's go.

1591
01:31:43,533 --> 01:31:45,937
Dancers, stop.
Dancers, stop. Stop!

1592
01:31:46,903 --> 01:31:49,668
Turn about. Turn about.

1593
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:51,814
You've got to get some roll.
I got action on the right side.

1594
01:31:51,838 --> 01:31:54,275
<i>Turn around. Come on,
through, through, through!</i>

1595
01:31:57,684 --> 01:32:00,017
<i>We're lost in a cloud</i>

1596
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:03,889
<i>with too much rain</i>

1597
01:32:05,285 --> 01:32:07,728
<i>we're trapped in a world</i>

1598
01:32:09,059 --> 01:32:12,834
<i>that's troubled with pain</i>

1599
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:18,902
<i>but as long as a man
has the strength to dream</i>

1600
01:32:19,038 --> 01:32:25,911
<i>he can redeem his soul and fly</i>

1601
01:32:30,382 --> 01:32:37,923
<i>deep in my heart
there's a trembling question</i>

1602
01:32:38,058 --> 01:32:41,958
<i>still, I am sure
that the answer's</i>

1603
01:32:42,094 --> 01:32:45,497
<i>answer's gonna come somehow</i>

1604
01:32:45,633 --> 01:32:49,165
<i>out there in the dark</i>

1605
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:53,434
<i>there's a beckoning candle, yeah</i>

1606
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:57,173
<i>and while I can think
while I can talk</i>

1607
01:32:57,308 --> 01:33:01,282
<i>while I can stand
while I can walk</i>

1608
01:33:01,417 --> 01:33:04,912
<i>while I can dream</i>

1609
01:33:05,048 --> 01:33:09,080
<i>oh, please let my dream</i>

1610
01:33:09,215 --> 01:33:12,793
<i>come true, oh</i>

1611
01:33:16,563 --> 01:33:20,225
<i>right now</i>

1612
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,902
<i>let it come true right now</i>

1613
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,512
<i>Thank you. Good night.</i>

1614
01:33:37,647 --> 01:33:40,013
<i>I was always said,
when it came to music,</i>

1615
01:33:40,148 --> 01:33:41,880
<i>my boy knows best.</i>

1616
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:46,618
<i>But the special was my idea.
It was a tremendous hit.</i>

1617
01:33:47,662 --> 01:33:49,326
<i>We was back on top.</i>

1618
01:33:49,462 --> 01:33:53,159
<i>But some people were
putting ideas into his head</i>

1619
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:56,967
<i>that he didn't need me no more.</i>

1620
01:34:02,643 --> 01:34:03,811
Whoo-hoo!

1621
01:34:05,271 --> 01:34:06,505
<i>It's working.</i>

1622
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:07,979
<i>London, Germany, Japan...</i>

1623
01:34:08,114 --> 01:34:09,514
<i>Hulett here has got it
all lined up.</i>

1624
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:11,447
Air Presley's new wings.

1625
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:13,624
You know, when you
play stadiums, it's like...

1626
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,449
You do a week of shows
in just one night.

1627
01:34:15,584 --> 01:34:17,891
And when it's done,
you get on the plane...

1628
01:34:18,026 --> 01:34:20,026
You go where you want,
you play where you want,

1629
01:34:20,161 --> 01:34:22,554
and if they don't like it,
you go someplace else.

1630
01:34:22,689 --> 01:34:24,565
You know who told me that?
B.B. King.

1631
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,497
Well, b.B. Knows, man.

1632
01:34:26,632 --> 01:34:28,792
And the someplace else you
should be going is overseas.

1633
01:34:28,865 --> 01:34:30,499
I like that.

1634
01:34:30,635 --> 01:34:32,681
You know, I heard last year
alone, you had two offers.

1635
01:34:32,705 --> 01:34:34,103
Germany and Japan,

1636
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:37,108
for a million bucks
for one night.

1637
01:34:37,243 --> 01:34:39,379
I mean, why the colonel
would turn that down,

1638
01:34:39,515 --> 01:34:41,014
I have no idea, man.

1639
01:34:41,149 --> 01:34:43,447
Well, if you figure it out,
can you let us know?

1640
01:34:43,582 --> 01:34:45,019
Yeah.

1641
01:34:45,154 --> 01:34:45,913
Well, screw him.
You've got the plane now.

1642
01:34:46,048 --> 01:34:47,422
You should use it.

1643
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:49,449
Yeah, come to daddy.

1644
01:34:49,585 --> 01:34:51,559
Maybe we should call it
the "Lisa Marie."

1645
01:34:51,694 --> 01:34:52,934
That's a beautiful name.

1646
01:34:52,989 --> 01:34:54,059
Right?

1647
01:34:56,499 --> 01:34:59,724
Hit me. Hit me.

1648
01:34:59,859 --> 01:35:04,228
Mr. Parker, Mr. Kohn
would like to see you.

1649
01:35:04,364 --> 01:35:06,698
Colonel Parker. Hit me.

1650
01:35:08,841 --> 01:35:10,845
I can't, sorry.

1651
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:16,378
<i>You've run up
quite a tab, colonel.</i>

1652
01:35:16,513 --> 01:35:19,755
And we hear your boy's working
with new people.

1653
01:35:20,855 --> 01:35:23,522
You've lost your meal ticket.

1654
01:35:23,658 --> 01:35:25,890
It's time to settle up,

1655
01:35:26,026 --> 01:35:28,427
before we have to make things...

1656
01:35:28,563 --> 01:35:30,592
Uncomfortable.

1657
01:35:30,727 --> 01:35:33,698
Well, before the army, we found
no record of you at all.

1658
01:35:33,834 --> 01:35:36,496
No passport, no residency.

1659
01:35:36,632 --> 01:35:39,473
You were never a colonel.
Never a Tom.

1660
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,337
You weren't even a Parker.

1661
01:35:41,473 --> 01:35:46,980
Why did you flee Holland,
Andreas Van kuijk?

1662
01:35:50,779 --> 01:35:52,625
I don't know why

1663
01:35:52,649 --> 01:35:54,427
you can't just let
the lawyers take care of it.

1664
01:35:54,451 --> 01:35:56,089
I have to see him in Vegas.

1665
01:35:56,225 --> 01:35:58,419
He's in the hospital.
It's the right thing to do.

1666
01:35:58,554 --> 01:35:59,905
- Yeah, well...
- He's frail right now.

1667
01:35:59,929 --> 01:36:01,235
You know what he's like, baby.

1668
01:36:01,259 --> 01:36:03,262
Hey! Watch it.

1669
01:36:03,397 --> 01:36:05,245
You know what he's like. The
second that you're near him,

1670
01:36:05,269 --> 01:36:07,673
you'll be under ten feet of snow
before you know what's happened.

1671
01:36:07,697 --> 01:36:10,668
My mind's made up.
Business is business.

1672
01:36:10,803 --> 01:36:12,137
He and I are done.

1673
01:36:12,272 --> 01:36:14,107
But I owe it to him
to tell him to his face.

1674
01:36:14,242 --> 01:36:17,609
Well, just make sure he
doesn't clip your wings, honey.

1675
01:36:17,744 --> 01:36:19,439
He won't!

1676
01:36:19,575 --> 01:36:22,182
I am gonna go see him in Vegas.

1677
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:26,913
I'm gonna look him in the eyes,
and I'm gonna tell him...

1678
01:36:27,048 --> 01:36:29,063
- Watch my hair.
- I'm gonna tell him...

1679
01:36:29,087 --> 01:36:30,423
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

1680
01:36:31,957 --> 01:36:32,957
...It's over.

1681
01:36:38,262 --> 01:36:40,666
<i>You break it, you burn it</i>

1682
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:43,536
<i>drag it all around</i>

1683
01:36:43,672 --> 01:36:46,001
you twist it and turn it

1684
01:36:46,137 --> 01:36:48,538
<i>you cannot tear it down</i>

1685
01:36:48,674 --> 01:36:51,342
<i>'cause every minute,
every hour you'll be shaken</i>

1686
01:36:51,477 --> 01:36:53,979
<i>by the strength
and mighty power of my love</i>

1687
01:36:54,115 --> 01:36:55,741
colonel doesn't want you
making a fuss.

1688
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:03,852
- Colonel?
- Mmm?

1689
01:37:03,988 --> 01:37:04,988
Elvis is here.

1690
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:06,261
Oh...

1691
01:37:06,396 --> 01:37:09,354
Oh. My boy.

1692
01:37:09,489 --> 01:37:11,626
Admiral. How are you?

1693
01:37:11,761 --> 01:37:15,036
Oh, my boy, I should have
come down to see you.

1694
01:37:15,171 --> 01:37:17,334
But I'm a little
laid up, you know.

1695
01:37:17,469 --> 01:37:18,675
You've just had a heart attack.

1696
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:20,139
You're not meant
to get out of bed.

1697
01:37:20,275 --> 01:37:22,670
Heart attack?
Colonel, you said your back...

1698
01:37:22,805 --> 01:37:26,513
My heart just stopped is all,
and I fell. It's...

1699
01:37:26,648 --> 01:37:28,646
I put my back out.

1700
01:37:30,851 --> 01:37:32,683
There you go.

1701
01:37:32,818 --> 01:37:35,557
It was all the excitement about
the Christmas special, you see.

1702
01:37:35,692 --> 01:37:37,024
I should never have worried,

1703
01:37:37,159 --> 01:37:40,852
because you came through
like you always do.

1704
01:37:40,987 --> 01:37:45,356
Nobody can sell "show"
to an audience like you.

1705
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:47,727
I admit it. I was wrong.

1706
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:51,038
Colonel, I...

1707
01:37:52,237 --> 01:37:53,975
I wanted to tell you in person.

1708
01:37:54,773 --> 01:37:57,042
Um...

1709
01:37:57,177 --> 01:38:00,443
As far as business
is concerned...

1710
01:38:00,578 --> 01:38:02,775
I think we need to go
our separate ways.

1711
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:09,923
Well, you may be right.

1712
01:38:10,058 --> 01:38:12,586
Maybe it is time for me
to retire.

1713
01:38:12,722 --> 01:38:14,627
Oh, come on, colonel,
quit snowin' me.

1714
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:16,192
You ain't retiring.

1715
01:38:16,327 --> 01:38:20,430
I will miss the circus. I will.

1716
01:38:20,565 --> 01:38:22,801
But I cannot keep up
with these young fellas,

1717
01:38:22,936 --> 01:38:24,532
like your Mr. Hulett,

1718
01:38:24,667 --> 01:38:27,432
who wants to put together
a new show

1719
01:38:27,568 --> 01:38:30,138
for an international tour,

1720
01:38:30,274 --> 01:38:32,708
for you to play stadiums.

1721
01:38:32,843 --> 01:38:38,151
These international tours
are very, very expensive.

1722
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:41,756
And the costs
cut into the artist's profits.

1723
01:38:41,891 --> 01:38:43,825
I worry that the financial risk

1724
01:38:43,961 --> 01:38:46,760
would put a strain
on your daddy.

1725
01:38:46,895 --> 01:38:48,455
But I cannot help but think,

1726
01:38:48,591 --> 01:38:50,425
as your former technical advisor

1727
01:38:50,561 --> 01:38:53,663
and as an old friend, what if...

1728
01:38:53,799 --> 01:38:58,501
The next Elvis Presley show
did not cost you a red cent?

1729
01:39:01,444 --> 01:39:06,509
I wonder if your daddy would
not like the sound of that.

1730
01:39:08,018 --> 01:39:11,316
The brand-new
international hotel.

1731
01:39:30,974 --> 01:39:33,597
It's a mighty big stage.

1732
01:39:33,733 --> 01:39:35,670
The biggest in Las Vegas.

1733
01:39:35,805 --> 01:39:37,870
You could get lost
in a place like this.

1734
01:39:38,006 --> 01:39:40,772
My boy, you performed
that comeback special

1735
01:39:40,908 --> 01:39:43,717
on a tiny square,
inside a studio,

1736
01:39:43,852 --> 01:39:45,509
and the fans loved it.

1737
01:39:45,645 --> 01:39:47,155
In a room this size,

1738
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:51,849
you could give them
the greatest show on earth.

1739
01:39:51,985 --> 01:39:55,590
Nothing less than Elvis Presley.

1740
01:39:55,726 --> 01:39:58,665
I've been experimenting
with a new, big sound.

1741
01:39:58,801 --> 01:40:00,067
Good. Good, my boy.

1742
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:02,236
Because you can fill up
this entire stage

1743
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:04,996
with every musical idea
that is inside that head.

1744
01:40:06,203 --> 01:40:07,570
No, it would cost.

1745
01:40:07,705 --> 01:40:10,078
Yes, that's the beauty of it.

1746
01:40:10,213 --> 01:40:12,012
You see, this here
international hotel...

1747
01:40:18,287 --> 01:40:19,883
This international hotel...

1748
01:40:20,018 --> 01:40:21,018
Mmm-hmm.

1749
01:40:21,122 --> 01:40:23,817
Needs a major drawing card

1750
01:40:23,952 --> 01:40:27,654
to pull in all the rubes
and put it on the map.

1751
01:40:27,789 --> 01:40:30,424
So they will cover
all of the costs

1752
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,594
of putting together your show.

1753
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:34,393
And you just play here
for six weeks,

1754
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,329
and then off you go,

1755
01:40:36,465 --> 01:40:39,163
to tour around the world

1756
01:40:39,298 --> 01:40:43,103
with no financial risk
to Elvis Presley enterprises.

1757
01:40:43,238 --> 01:40:44,508
None.

1758
01:40:49,279 --> 01:40:51,284
Well, goddamn.

1759
01:40:57,953 --> 01:41:00,788
- Snowman strikes again.
- Oh, yeah.

1760
01:41:00,923 --> 01:41:05,062
We're going to make it snow.
It will snow.

1761
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:07,539
<i>First of all, we're gonna
need the sweet inspirations.</i>

1762
01:41:07,563 --> 01:41:09,760
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1763
01:41:09,896 --> 01:41:11,804
<i>And the imperials.</i>

1764
01:41:11,939 --> 01:41:14,107
<i>We're caught
in a trap I can't walk out</i>

1765
01:41:14,243 --> 01:41:16,172
<i>And a 30-piece orchestra.</i>

1766
01:41:23,919 --> 01:41:26,446
<i>You know, the first
thing that I ever recorded,</i>

1767
01:41:26,582 --> 01:41:28,047
<i>the very first thing,</i>

1768
01:41:28,182 --> 01:41:31,050
<i>was an old, uh, rhythm
and blues-type song</i>

1769
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:33,285
<i>called "that's all right,
little mama."</i>

1770
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,823
<i>And back then we only had</i>

1771
01:41:35,959 --> 01:41:39,067
<i>two or three instruments
at the time.</i>

1772
01:41:39,202 --> 01:41:41,092
<i>But this ain't
no nostalgia show.</i>

1773
01:41:41,227 --> 01:41:43,100
<i>We're gonna do something
different.</i>

1774
01:41:47,209 --> 01:41:51,477
I, uh...
I wanna try something new.

1775
01:41:51,613 --> 01:41:55,177
All right, Glen, you're gonna
start us off, okay?

1776
01:41:55,313 --> 01:41:56,547
Take the intro here.

1777
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:15,401
All right, bring that
bass up, Jerry.

1778
01:42:19,809 --> 01:42:20,967
Keep playing.

1779
01:42:23,341 --> 01:42:24,678
Whoo!

1780
01:42:24,813 --> 01:42:27,545
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1781
01:42:27,681 --> 01:42:29,206
<i>-That's all right
-that's all right</i>

1782
01:42:29,342 --> 01:42:30,781
<i>-that's all right
-that's all right</i>

1783
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:32,153
boys...

1784
01:42:32,288 --> 01:42:32,851
<i>That's all right</i>

1785
01:42:32,986 --> 01:42:33,821
With me.

1786
01:42:33,957 --> 01:42:35,514
<i>Any way you do</i>

1787
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:36,649
All right.

1788
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:43,163
<i>James, you ready?</i>

1789
01:42:43,299 --> 01:42:45,156
Oh!

1790
01:42:51,807 --> 01:42:52,998
Flames, man!

1791
01:42:53,134 --> 01:42:55,072
Flames are coming
out of that guitar.

1792
01:42:55,208 --> 01:42:57,878
I got that. Ronnie.

1793
01:42:58,013 --> 01:42:59,104
I'll get back to that.

1794
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:02,674
Horns, you ready?

1795
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:06,216
<i>Ba-da-bom! Ba-da-bom!</i>

1796
01:43:09,024 --> 01:43:10,190
Let's up the octave!

1797
01:43:11,756 --> 01:43:14,459
Yeah! Goddamn!

1798
01:43:14,595 --> 01:43:17,791
All right, 'bones.
On a one, three, four...

1799
01:43:25,166 --> 01:43:27,604
Ronnie,
you know what to do, man.

1800
01:43:27,739 --> 01:43:29,767
Do it to me, come on.
Take us home.

1801
01:43:31,809 --> 01:43:34,708
Huh, huh, huh, huh
hah! Hah! Hah!

1802
01:43:34,844 --> 01:43:36,850
Come on.
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

1803
01:43:36,986 --> 01:43:38,543
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

1804
01:43:55,201 --> 01:43:57,728
- Colonel, nice to see you.
- Oh, here you are.

1805
01:43:57,863 --> 01:43:59,406
Yeah. Here you go.

1806
01:44:02,112 --> 01:44:03,409
- How 'bout a hound dog?
- Cool.

1807
01:44:03,545 --> 01:44:04,680
I'll fix you with
some food and drink.

1808
01:44:04,704 --> 01:44:05,769
Thank you.

1809
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:10,443
All right, let's go.

1810
01:44:45,954 --> 01:44:49,281
<i>Well, that's all right, mama
that's all right with you</i>

1811
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:52,120
<i>that's all right, mama

01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:55,695

01:44:55,831 --> 01:45:02,198

01:45:02,333 --> 01:45:06,370
<i>well, my mama, she done

1816
01:45:06,505 --> 01:45:08,866
<i>"the life you're livin, son now,
women be the death of you"</i>

1817
01:45:09,002 --> 01:45:10,669
<i>now, that's all right</i>

1818
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:12,237

<i>da, da-da, Dee, Dee, Dee

01:45:52,349 --> 01:45:57,524
<i>well, that's all right now,
mama any way you do</i>

1830
01:46:09,528 --> 01:46:12,368
Ain't nobody gonna do
a better show than that.

1831
01:46:12,504 --> 01:46:13,901
I tell ya, if I was you,

1832
01:46:14,037 --> 01:46:16,202
I would book him
for a hundred years.

1833
01:46:17,613 --> 01:46:20,581
Well, no better time
than the present.

1834
01:46:20,716 --> 01:46:23,909
But we hear hulett has him
doing a world tour.

1835
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:28,722
Well, well, well, uh,
I think Mr. Presley

1836
01:46:28,858 --> 01:46:32,425
could be persuaded to make
the international his home,

1837
01:46:32,561 --> 01:46:36,063
provided he was paid
pretty well.

1838
01:46:36,199 --> 01:46:37,863
What did you have in mind?

1839
01:46:37,999 --> 01:46:40,199
I'd like to introduce to you
a couple of people tonight,

1840
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:42,861
one of which being
my beautiful wife, Priscilla.

1841
01:46:44,768 --> 01:46:46,233
Would you stand up, honey?

1842
01:46:46,368 --> 01:46:49,942
For an attraction as tremendous
as Mr. Presley...

1843
01:46:50,077 --> 01:46:53,747
We love you, Priscilla!

1844
01:46:53,883 --> 01:46:57,243
Also, this man over here,
I wouldn't be here without,

1845
01:46:57,378 --> 01:47:00,551
my manager of many years,
colonel Sanders.

1846
01:47:00,686 --> 01:47:04,316
Parker. Parker.

1847
01:47:04,452 --> 01:47:06,524
Well, we're gonna do a new song
for you tonight.

1848
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:08,787
It's called "suspicious minds."

1849
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:10,130
"Suspicious minds."

1850
01:47:14,599 --> 01:47:16,427
<i>We're caught in a trap</i>

1851
01:47:18,174 --> 01:47:20,266
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1852
01:47:21,808 --> 01:47:27,306
<i>because I love you
too much, baby</i>

1853
01:47:29,581 --> 01:47:31,175
<i>why can't you see</i>

1854
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:35,349
<i>oh, what you're doin' to me</i>

1855
01:47:35,484 --> 01:47:41,452
<i>oh, when you don't believe
a word I'm sayin'?</i>

1856
01:47:44,262 --> 01:47:50,667
<i>We can't go on together
with suspicious minds</i>

1857
01:47:50,802 --> 01:47:53,800
<i>and we can't build our dreams</i>

1858
01:47:53,936 --> 01:47:57,702
<i>on suspicious minds</i>

1859
01:47:57,837 --> 01:48:01,379
<i>so, if an old friend I know
shove it up your nose</i>

1860
01:48:01,515 --> 01:48:03,578
<i>stops by to say hello</i>

1861
01:48:05,481 --> 01:48:12,591
<i>Would I still see suspicion
in your eyes?</i>

1862
01:48:12,727 --> 01:48:16,025
That is what my boy
would expect.

1863
01:48:18,023 --> 01:48:20,696
Now...

1864
01:48:20,832 --> 01:48:23,267
What are you going to pay me?

1865
01:48:28,476 --> 01:48:32,446
<i>Oh, let our love survive</i>

1866
01:48:32,582 --> 01:48:37,510
colonel, your sideshow
is the jackpot.

1867
01:48:39,183 --> 01:48:41,585
If you bring him back
every year,

1868
01:48:41,721 --> 01:48:44,148
I'll make it worth your while.

1869
01:48:44,284 --> 01:48:46,561
<i>Oh, I've never...</i>

1870
01:48:49,022 --> 01:48:51,566
<i>Lied to you</i>

1871
01:48:52,796 --> 01:48:54,162
<i>caught in a trap</i>

1872
01:48:55,865 --> 01:48:58,667
<i>I can't walk out</i>

<i>good thing die</i>

1874
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:06,905
<i>yeah, yeah now, don't you know</i>

1875

<i>caught in a trap</i>

1876
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:11,916

1881
01:49:39,515 --> 01:49:42,276
<i>because I love you too much</i>

1882
01:49:46,382 --> 01:49:50,581
<i>caught in a trap
I can't walk out</i>

1883
01:49:52,354 --> 01:49:57,489
<i>because I love you
too much, baby</i>

1884
01:49:57,624 --> 01:50:00,591
<i>oh, don't you know
caught in a trap</i>

1885
01:50:02,764 --> 01:50:06,063
of course, I will reserve
the right to sell calendars,

1886
01:50:06,198 --> 01:50:07,338
pictures and such?

1887
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:12,504
You do whatever
you want, colonel,

1888
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:16,508
as long as that boy
stays on that stage.

1889
01:50:30,965 --> 01:50:33,158
<i>My boy's light burned brighter</i>

1890
01:50:33,294 --> 01:50:36,027
<i>than even 15 years before.</i>

1891
01:50:36,163 --> 01:50:37,364
Hi, darlin'.

1892
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:08,193
<i>I saw in her face that night</i>

1893
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:11,169
<i>what I had always known.</i>

1894
01:51:11,305 --> 01:51:16,711
<i>She could never compete
with the love he felt from you.</i>

1895
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:26,545
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it up there, man.

1896
01:51:28,216 --> 01:51:32,516
<i>Take my... take my hand</i>

1897
01:51:32,652 --> 01:51:37,390
<i>take my whole...
Whole life too</i>

1898
01:51:37,526 --> 01:51:39,862
<i>for I... for I...
I can't help</i>

1899
01:51:39,997 --> 01:51:41,501
hey, guys. Time to go back.

1900
01:51:41,636 --> 01:51:45,399
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

1901
01:51:45,534 --> 01:51:51,003
<i>oh, oh, for I...
For I can't help</i>

1902
01:51:51,138 --> 01:51:54,511
<i>falling in love</i>

1903
01:51:54,646 --> 01:51:59,886
<i>with you</i>

1904
01:52:20,036 --> 01:52:21,600
Thank you very much.

1905
01:52:25,745 --> 01:52:27,738
Thank you! Thank you.

1906
01:52:42,387 --> 01:52:44,223
Such a fine show.

1907
01:52:49,803 --> 01:52:51,633
Yeah, baby! Yeah.

1908
01:52:51,768 --> 01:52:54,128
- Wow, great show.
- Thank you. Thank you, all.

1909
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:56,600
Goddamn, Elvis.
That was great.

1910
01:52:56,736 --> 01:52:57,918
That was fantastic.

1911
01:52:57,942 --> 01:52:58,942
There she is.

1912
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:11,325
Oh, god. I don't know
who that was out there.

1913
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:13,617
You were... you...

1914
01:53:13,753 --> 01:53:15,219
You were incredible.
You were...

1915
01:53:15,355 --> 01:53:16,497
You were everything.

1916
01:53:16,632 --> 01:53:19,966
Thank you, baby. Thank you.

1917
01:53:21,866 --> 01:53:23,795
Mr. Elvis Presley,

1918
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:26,539
I guess that's your
new manager over there, hmm?

1919
01:53:26,675 --> 01:53:28,336
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

1920
01:53:28,472 --> 01:53:30,667
Yeah. I'm gonna go talk to him,
all right?

1921
01:53:30,803 --> 01:53:32,510
- Okay.
- You okay to get upstairs?

1922
01:53:32,646 --> 01:53:33,705
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

1923
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:51,994
Tremendous...
Tremendous triumph.

1924
01:53:52,129 --> 01:53:54,892
The greatest show on earth.

1925
01:53:55,028 --> 01:53:59,703
My dear boy, this brainchild
came from you and me,

1926
01:53:59,838 --> 01:54:03,470
but you alone Rose above it
all, and it worked with your talent,

1927
01:54:03,606 --> 01:54:06,909
and your dedication.

1928
01:54:07,044 --> 01:54:08,572
We did it. We did it!

1929
01:54:08,707 --> 01:54:10,478
- We did it.
- We did.

1930
01:54:12,117 --> 01:54:14,882
Come on.

1931
01:54:16,885 --> 01:54:19,685
I can't wait to show the world
what you and I can do.

1932
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:24,765
The world will see this show.

1933
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,896
Whatever it takes,
I guarantee it.

1934
01:54:27,031 --> 01:54:28,364
Whatever I have to do.

1935
01:54:32,504 --> 01:54:33,909
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,</i>

1936
01:54:33,933 --> 01:54:36,708
the king of rock and roll,
Elvis Presley!

1937
01:54:38,572 --> 01:54:40,113
No, I'm not the king.

1938
01:54:40,249 --> 01:54:42,917
Hey, fats. Mr. Fats domino,
ladies and gentlemen.

1939
01:54:43,052 --> 01:54:44,782
This is the real king
of rock and roll.

1940
01:54:44,918 --> 01:54:46,383
Yeah, I'm somethin' else.

1941
01:54:46,518 --> 01:54:48,517
Any plans
to take this show on tour?

1942
01:54:48,652 --> 01:54:50,692
There's so many places
I haven't been yet, you know.

1943
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:54,619
I'd like to go to Europe.
I'd like to go to Japan.

1944
01:54:54,755 --> 01:54:56,629
I've never been
out of the country,

1945
01:54:56,764 --> 01:54:58,126
<i>except in the service.</i>

1946
01:55:04,336 --> 01:55:05,863
What are you lookin' at
back there?

1947
01:55:06,739 --> 01:55:07,764
Oh, Mr. Diskin.

1948
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:09,436
Have we discussed
with Mr. Hulett,

1949
01:55:09,572 --> 01:55:11,203
pertaining to the death threats?

1950
01:55:11,338 --> 01:55:13,239
The death threats?

1951
01:55:13,375 --> 01:55:15,976
Precisely. Death threats!

1952
01:55:17,719 --> 01:55:19,745
<i>Down in Louisiana</i>

1953
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:23,684
<i>where the alligators
grow so mean</i>

1954
01:55:23,819 --> 01:55:27,092
<i>lived a girl that I swear
to the world</i>

1955
01:55:27,228 --> 01:55:29,353
<i>made the alligators look tame</i>

1956
01:55:29,489 --> 01:55:30,489
<i>polk salad Annie</i>

1957
01:55:33,434 --> 01:55:35,070
<i>Colonel,
once we finish the season,</i>

1958
01:55:35,094 --> 01:55:36,961
<i>Elvis wants
to take the tour overseas.</i>

1959
01:55:37,096 --> 01:55:40,201
Overseas? Have you thought
about security, Jerry?

1960
01:55:40,337 --> 01:55:42,270
<i>Of course I have.</i>

1961
01:55:42,405 --> 01:55:44,307
<i>This is Elvis Presley,</i>

1962
01:55:44,443 --> 01:55:47,473
<i>the most famous man
on the planet.</i>

1963
01:55:47,608 --> 01:55:50,044
<i>Straight-razor totin' woman</i>

1964
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:51,745
<i>lord, have mercy</i>

1965
01:55:51,881 --> 01:55:53,295
<i>The crazies
in those countries...</i>

1966
01:55:53,319 --> 01:55:55,517
They're a hundred times
more dangerous.

1967
01:55:55,653 --> 01:55:58,351
Am I the only one
who thinks about security?

1968
01:55:58,486 --> 01:56:01,419
<i>Sock a little polk salad</i>

1969
01:56:01,554 --> 01:56:02,854
<i>you know I need it</i>

1970
01:56:04,661 --> 01:56:07,698
there is nothing more important
than security!

1971
01:56:21,813 --> 01:56:25,910
Am I the only one who ever
thinks about Elvis' security!

1972
01:56:32,794 --> 01:56:33,984
Get him out of here!

1973
01:56:40,631 --> 01:56:42,266
<i>Those guys turned out to be</i>

1974
01:56:42,401 --> 01:56:44,698
<i>some over-excited fans
from Peru.</i>

1975
01:56:44,833 --> 01:56:47,236
<i>But the death threats were real.</i>

1976
01:56:47,372 --> 01:56:49,769
I'm going back on.

1977
01:56:49,904 --> 01:56:52,068
I'll rip his goddamn tongue out
by the roots.

1978
01:56:52,204 --> 01:56:55,974
<i>It started to take its toll.</i>

1979
01:56:56,109 --> 01:56:59,078
Here at baptist memorial
hospital in midtown Memphis,

1980
01:56:59,213 --> 01:57:02,216
Elvis Presley has apparently
checked in to a private suite,

1981
01:57:02,352 --> 01:57:04,056
suffering from exhaustion.

1982
01:57:04,191 --> 01:57:06,318
A sign that Elvis
is in fact here

1983
01:57:06,453 --> 01:57:10,329
is the aluminum foil that covers
his windows to deflect the sun.

1984
01:57:10,464 --> 01:57:12,102
<i>Shock around the nation today</i>

1985
01:57:12,126 --> 01:57:14,332
<i>as a free rock concert
at the altamont speedway</i>

1986
01:57:14,467 --> 01:57:16,769
<i>by English band
the rolling stones,</i>

1987
01:57:16,905 --> 01:57:18,701
<i>ended with four deaths.</i>

1988
01:57:18,836 --> 01:57:21,237
<i>One resulting from a stabbing,
allegedly committed...</i>

1989
01:57:21,373 --> 01:57:23,506
Elvis,
Dr. Nick is here.

1990
01:57:25,511 --> 01:57:27,412
Such a lovely girl,
Ms. Tate.

1991
01:57:27,547 --> 01:57:30,079
What has happened to law
and order in this country?

1992
01:57:30,214 --> 01:57:31,943
Hippies and radicals,

1993
01:57:32,078 --> 01:57:35,388
threatening and killing
popular entertainers.

1994
01:57:35,524 --> 01:57:39,659
The ira blowing up england?
Planes exploding in mid-air?

1995
01:57:39,795 --> 01:57:41,151
Has the world gone mad?

1996
01:57:41,286 --> 01:57:44,058
Hulett's security
is not what it needs to be.

1997
01:57:44,193 --> 01:57:45,628
And he knows it.

1998
01:57:45,763 --> 01:57:47,925
An international tour now
is out of the question.

1999
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:49,833
What are you talking about,
colonel?

2000
01:57:49,968 --> 01:57:51,946
I ain't gonna let these sons of
bitches push me off the stage.

2001
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:53,471
Precisely.

2002
01:57:53,606 --> 01:57:55,347
You are not one of hulett's
long-hair zeppelins,

2003
01:57:55,371 --> 01:57:57,302
you are Elvis Presley.

2004
01:57:57,437 --> 01:57:59,246
You are beloved.

2005
01:57:59,381 --> 01:58:02,107
And I told him I have to
look Priscilla in the eye,

2006
01:58:02,243 --> 01:58:06,977
and I have to promise her
that little Lisa Marie's daddy

2007
01:58:07,113 --> 01:58:10,113
will be safe while
he's away from home.

2008
01:58:10,249 --> 01:58:11,969
We're taking the show
to the world, colonel.

2009
01:58:12,051 --> 01:58:14,227
I ain't gonna disappoint
those fans.

2010
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,665
Well...

2011
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:25,629
If you want to book more dates,
we could do an American tour,

2012
01:58:25,764 --> 01:58:28,036
15 cities in 15 days,

2013
01:58:28,172 --> 01:58:31,604
while Mr. Hulett straightens out
his security problems overseas.

2014
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:33,804
I'd like that very much, son.

2015
01:58:33,939 --> 01:58:35,345
How is that gonna be any safer?

2016
01:58:35,481 --> 01:58:37,546
Because staying in this country,

2017
01:58:37,682 --> 01:58:41,448
I can handle every aspect
of security.

2018
01:58:41,584 --> 01:58:43,048
And then we go international?

2019
01:58:43,183 --> 01:58:46,125
Yeah, sure, around the world.
Wherever you want.

2020
01:58:46,261 --> 01:58:47,663
But in the meantime,
here in america,

2021
01:58:47,687 --> 01:58:50,193
we put on a great show.

2022
01:58:50,329 --> 01:58:51,622
And what will we do, Charlie?

2023
01:58:51,757 --> 01:58:53,398
And have a lot of fun.

2024
01:58:54,331 --> 01:58:56,797
Taking care of business.

2025
01:58:58,566 --> 01:59:00,997
Taking care of business.

2026
01:59:07,616 --> 01:59:10,943
<i>I'll get guarantees
from every mayor.</i>

2027
01:59:11,078 --> 01:59:13,145
<i>We'll double
the police presence.</i>

2028
01:59:13,281 --> 01:59:15,981
<i>You'll have more security
than the president.</i>

2029
01:59:18,922 --> 01:59:22,790
<i>Lord almighty
I feel my temperature rising</i>

2030
01:59:24,799 --> 01:59:28,697
<i>higher, higher it's
burning through to my soul</i>

2031
01:59:30,869 --> 01:59:36,575
<i>girl, girl, girl
you're gonna set me on fire</i>

2032
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:39,410
<i>my brain is flaming
I don't know which way to go</i>

2033
01:59:39,546 --> 01:59:41,073
<i>And when the show is done,</i>

2034
01:59:41,209 --> 01:59:44,082
<i>the boys will hustle you
to the motorcade.</i>

2035
01:59:44,217 --> 01:59:46,442
Elvis has left the building.

2036
01:59:46,578 --> 01:59:50,290
<i>Once you're in the air,
Dr. Nick will ensure your rest.</i>

2037
01:59:51,321 --> 01:59:53,087
<i>Burnin' love</i>

2038
01:59:53,222 --> 01:59:55,585
<i>Land in the next city,
then we do it all again.</i>

2039
01:59:55,721 --> 01:59:57,088
<i>Fifteen times!</i>

2040
01:59:57,223 --> 02:00:00,025
<i>I'm just a hunk
a hunk of burning love</i>

2041
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:02,164
<i>I'm just a hunk
a hunk of burning love</i>

2042
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:04,867
<i>It was life on the
road, just like the old days.</i>

2043
02:00:05,002 --> 02:00:09,034
<i>We were making so much snow,
we did it again.</i>

2044
02:00:11,242 --> 02:00:12,675
<i>And again.</i>

2045
02:00:13,541 --> 02:00:15,512
<i>And again.</i>

2046
02:00:15,648 --> 02:00:18,846
<i>All in the safety
of the us of a.</i>

2047
02:00:22,581 --> 02:00:25,890
<i>Eventually, he lost interest
in going overseas.</i>

2048
02:00:26,026 --> 02:00:27,859
<i>Why would you?</i>

2049
02:00:27,994 --> 02:00:32,323
<i>But I still kept my promise.
I brought the world to him.</i>

2050
02:00:32,459 --> 02:00:36,434
<i>I invented the world's
first ever satellite concert.</i>

2051
02:00:39,534 --> 02:00:44,741
<i>1.5 billion people in
one night, for a single artist.</i>

2052
02:00:44,876 --> 02:00:48,073
<i>Nothing like it before,
nothing like it since.</i>

2053
02:00:57,786 --> 02:01:00,353
<i>But it wasn't enough.</i>

2054
02:01:00,488 --> 02:01:06,398
<i>He was addicted to the love
he felt from you onstage.</i>

2055
02:01:06,534 --> 02:01:09,798
<i>Ordinary love
just didn't compare.</i>

2056
02:01:11,298 --> 02:01:15,976
<i>So, in the lonely moments
between shows,</i>

2057
02:01:16,111 --> 02:01:19,435
<i>he turned to them pills.</i>

2058
02:01:19,571 --> 02:01:21,810
Priscilla, I want you to
do something for me, will you?

2059
02:01:21,945 --> 02:01:25,352
You give my baby girl
a big hug for me, okay?

2060
02:01:27,487 --> 02:01:29,318
<i>The roar of the crowd.</i>

2061
02:01:29,454 --> 02:01:31,519
<i>The life on the road.</i>

2062
02:01:31,654 --> 02:01:34,851
<i>Calling home to your loved ones,
pretending nothing has changed,</i>

2063
02:01:34,987 --> 02:01:36,853
<i>when everything has.</i>

2064
02:01:36,989 --> 02:01:38,893
<i>Lost.</i>

2065
02:01:39,825 --> 02:01:41,192
What was that?

2066
02:01:45,098 --> 02:01:47,240
Ain't no one gonna walk around

2067
02:01:47,376 --> 02:01:48,736
sayin' they killed
Elvis Presley.

2068
02:01:48,871 --> 02:01:51,011
- What did you say?
- Nothing, baby.

2069
02:01:54,211 --> 02:01:56,977
<i>Dr. Martin
Luther King has been shot</i>

2070
02:01:57,112 --> 02:01:58,392
<i>in downtown Memphis,
Tennessee...</i>

2071
02:02:01,824 --> 02:02:03,647
<i>Sharon Tate was the last to die.</i>

2072
02:02:12,858 --> 02:02:14,698
Is that you, doll?

2073
02:02:14,833 --> 02:02:18,396
I'm leaving you,
and I'm taking Lisa with me.

2074
02:02:18,531 --> 02:02:21,302
Uh, 'cilla, is this about
what happens on the road?

2075
02:02:21,437 --> 02:02:22,705
About the what?

2076
02:02:22,841 --> 02:02:24,368
Is this about what happens
on the road?

2077
02:02:24,504 --> 02:02:25,952
The girls? You think
I give a shit about the girls

2078
02:02:25,976 --> 02:02:27,415
that you sneak in
through the side door?

2079
02:02:27,439 --> 02:02:29,314
No. I couldn't care less
about whoever it is

2080
02:02:29,450 --> 02:02:30,917
you sneak through the side door.

2081
02:02:31,053 --> 02:02:32,316
It's about this, Elvis.

2082
02:02:32,452 --> 02:02:33,913
- And this.
- Hey. Whoa.

2083
02:02:34,049 --> 02:02:36,047
And these goddamn pills
those leeches

2084
02:02:36,183 --> 02:02:37,583
and has-beens feed
down your throat!

2085
02:02:37,651 --> 02:02:38,786
God damn it.

2086
02:02:38,922 --> 02:02:40,230
- Like you're strung out.
- Strung out?

2087
02:02:40,254 --> 02:02:41,699
Goddamn, I'm in the best
shape of my life.

2088
02:02:41,723 --> 02:02:43,388
Best shape of your life.

2089
02:02:43,524 --> 02:02:44,871
The only time you're happy
is when you're on that stage.

2090
02:02:44,895 --> 02:02:46,356
And in between that,
you're a ghost.

2091
02:02:46,491 --> 02:02:48,251
'Cilla, I give you everything
you could want.

2092
02:02:48,368 --> 02:02:50,060
What I want is a husband.

2093
02:02:50,195 --> 02:02:52,803
I am your wife.
I am your wife!

2094
02:02:52,938 --> 02:02:56,140
And Lisa is your daughter.
She needs a father.

2095
02:02:56,276 --> 02:02:58,236
I am her father!

2096
02:03:04,883 --> 02:03:06,164
Do you remember the last time

2097
02:03:06,188 --> 02:03:07,917
that we laughed together?

2098
02:03:08,053 --> 02:03:09,894
Do you remember the last time
that the three of us

2099
02:03:09,918 --> 02:03:11,682
sat down and had
dinner together?

2100
02:03:13,154 --> 02:03:17,028
You won't even make love
to me anymore.

2101
02:03:17,163 --> 02:03:21,127
I gift you my life, and I have
nothing left in me to give you.

2102
02:03:25,833 --> 02:03:27,298
Do you still love me?

2103
02:03:47,091 --> 02:03:51,355
When you're 40 and I'm 50,
we'll be back together.

2104
02:03:53,661 --> 02:03:55,095
You'll see.

2105
02:04:12,153 --> 02:04:13,747
I have to go.

2106
02:04:13,883 --> 02:04:15,413
Will you please stay?

2107
02:04:15,548 --> 02:04:19,282
I have to go. Okay?
If I stay, I'll never leave.

2108
02:04:19,417 --> 02:04:20,824
- Please...
- You have to let me go.

2109
02:04:20,959 --> 02:04:22,760
- Please, Priscilla.
- You have to let me go.

2110
02:04:45,513 --> 02:04:47,193
<i>Fifty thousand people gathered</i>

2111
02:04:47,318 --> 02:04:49,238
<i>in New Orleans earlier today
to mourn the passing</i>

2112
02:04:49,317 --> 02:04:51,856
<i>of gospel legend,
mahalia Jackson.</i>

2113
02:04:51,991 --> 02:04:53,271
<i>Will you come to Mississippi</i>

2114
02:04:53,295 --> 02:04:55,226
<i>and sing with us, Mr. Presley?</i>

2115
02:04:55,361 --> 02:04:59,431
Why, b.B. King will be there.
Perhaps even the rolling stones.

2116
02:04:59,567 --> 02:05:01,425
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson.</i>

2117
02:05:01,561 --> 02:05:04,769
<i>The colonel, he...
He won't allow it.</i>

2118
02:05:04,904 --> 02:05:07,363
<i>You are a man,
Mr. Presley.</i>

2119
02:05:07,499 --> 02:05:08,899
And a man don't
make up his own mind

2120
02:05:09,003 --> 02:05:11,403
about matters of conscience.

2121
02:05:11,538 --> 02:05:13,641
<i>Come on, disk in.
Elvis needs a challenge</i>

2122
02:05:13,777 --> 02:05:15,142
<i>to get back on track.</i>

2123
02:05:15,277 --> 02:05:17,684
Why won't the colonel
let him go overseas?

2124
02:05:17,819 --> 02:05:19,579
- Security, Jerry. You know that.
- Bullshit!

2125
02:05:19,715 --> 02:05:21,958
The colonel's killing his
greatest asset without a reason.

2126
02:05:21,982 --> 02:05:23,719
So what is the reason?

2127
02:05:23,854 --> 02:05:26,425
Colonel always has his reasons.

2128
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:28,420
<i>I'm not at Liberty to divulge</i>

2129
02:05:28,555 --> 02:05:30,256
<i>personal information
about Mr. Parker.</i>

2130
02:05:30,391 --> 02:05:32,390
<i>He lied.</i>

2131
02:05:32,526 --> 02:05:33,974
There wasn't gonna be
an international tour

2132
02:05:33,998 --> 02:05:35,360
'cause he can't leave
the country.

2133
02:05:35,495 --> 02:05:37,598
He's got no citizenship,
no official identity.

2134
02:05:37,733 --> 02:05:39,032
He doesn't exist.

2135
02:05:39,168 --> 02:05:42,334
There never was
a colonel Tom Parker.

2136
02:05:42,469 --> 02:05:44,229
What are you
talking about, Jerry?

2137
02:05:45,604 --> 02:05:46,986
Hey, whoa, whoa!

2138
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:48,052
Get him an ice bucket!

2139
02:05:52,553 --> 02:05:53,882
Colonel's a smart man.

2140
02:05:54,017 --> 02:05:55,320
There's got to be
another reason.

2141
02:05:55,455 --> 02:05:56,654
Come on, man!

2142
02:05:56,789 --> 02:05:58,216
I will stay here at home,

2143
02:05:58,351 --> 02:06:00,422
and I will work
and I will worry.

2144
02:06:00,557 --> 02:06:02,887
<i>I mean, why the
colonel kept turning them down,</i>

2145
02:06:03,023 --> 02:06:04,023
I have no idea, man.

2146
02:06:05,631 --> 02:06:07,062
Get out of the way!

2147
02:06:09,102 --> 02:06:12,903
Now, you listen to me.
The only thing that matters...

2148
02:06:13,038 --> 02:06:16,066
Is that that man
gets up on that stage tonight.

2149
02:06:17,736 --> 02:06:20,647
If he was my son,
I'd put him in a hospital.

2150
02:06:25,184 --> 02:06:28,281
Well, of course, this is
a Presley enterprises decision.

2151
02:06:29,222 --> 02:06:30,547
Vernon?

2152
02:06:31,952 --> 02:06:34,485
Well... um...

2153
02:06:35,528 --> 02:06:37,794
Well, what can you...

2154
02:06:37,929 --> 02:06:40,128
What can you do for him,
Dr. Nick?

2155
02:06:42,430 --> 02:06:49,203
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

2156
02:06:54,449 --> 02:07:00,049
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

2157
02:07:14,534 --> 02:07:16,660
Thank you. Thank you.

2158
02:07:16,795 --> 02:07:18,875
Now he's gonna ask the house
lights to be brought up,

2159
02:07:18,937 --> 02:07:20,299
'cause we've been
looking at him.

2160
02:07:20,435 --> 02:07:22,267
He wants to look at us now.
He loves this.

2161
02:07:22,403 --> 02:07:23,843
I'd like to turn
the house lights up,

2162
02:07:23,908 --> 02:07:25,705
- ladies and gentlemen.
- Eh?

2163
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:28,643
'Cause now that you've seen me,
I'd like to take a look at you.

2164
02:07:31,412 --> 02:07:33,620
Oh, you're beautiful.
Thank you.

2165
02:07:33,755 --> 02:07:35,348
He'll mention the vips
that are here.

2166
02:07:35,484 --> 02:07:37,555
We've got some high-rollers
in here tonight.

2167
02:07:37,690 --> 02:07:38,986
Get ready for the spotlight.

2168
02:07:39,122 --> 02:07:42,485
Mr. International hotel
himself.

2169
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:44,858
- Thank you.
- Ah, there you go.

2170
02:07:44,993 --> 02:07:47,426
And right next to him,

2171
02:07:47,561 --> 02:07:52,364
is my so-called manager,
colonel Tom Parker.

2172
02:07:52,499 --> 02:07:55,940
- There he is.
- Come on.

2173
02:07:56,076 --> 02:08:01,279
But I hear rumors
that colonel is an alien.

2174
02:08:04,178 --> 02:08:05,779
Got here on my rocket ship.

2175
02:08:08,387 --> 02:08:09,415
Oh.

2176
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:15,387
Somebody call the FBI

2177
02:08:15,523 --> 02:08:17,962
and tell 'em that
he has abducted me,

2178
02:08:18,097 --> 02:08:22,429
that he has locked me
in this golden cage,

2179
02:08:22,564 --> 02:08:26,568
to keep me here forever
with you, ladies and gentlemen.

2180
02:08:29,801 --> 02:08:32,410
<i>So I'm caught in a trap</i>

2181
02:08:32,545 --> 02:08:35,078
<i>I can't get out</i>

2182
02:08:36,577 --> 02:08:40,116
'cause colonel's got some
big debts, baby.

2183
02:08:44,182 --> 02:08:46,288
Excuse me.

2184
02:08:46,423 --> 02:08:49,790
Well, this is the last show
I'm ever playing here.

2185
02:08:51,461 --> 02:08:56,595
I'm gonna get on my jet plane,
the Lisa Marie...

2186
02:08:56,730 --> 02:09:01,164
It's named after my, uh...
My beautiful daughter.

2187
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:03,304
And I'm gonna fly away.

2188
02:09:05,105 --> 02:09:07,172
No, no, no...

2189
02:09:07,308 --> 02:09:10,244
You know, I'm gonna fly away.

2190
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:12,277
Stop the show.
Stop this show!

2191
02:09:12,412 --> 02:09:13,629
Come on, get this curtain down.

2192
02:09:13,653 --> 02:09:15,581
Fuck the international.

2193
02:09:15,716 --> 02:09:18,950
Mr. Schilling, what the devil
is happening here?

2194
02:09:19,086 --> 02:09:20,485
And Las Vegas.

2195
02:09:20,621 --> 02:09:21,905
That's what he wants to know.

2196
02:09:21,929 --> 02:09:24,292
Ain't no one gonna stop me, man.

2197
02:09:25,961 --> 02:09:28,729
Oh! Security.

2198
02:09:28,864 --> 02:09:30,269
Security!

2199
02:09:31,871 --> 02:09:35,472
Security, security! Security!

2200
02:09:35,607 --> 02:09:37,770
800 shows!

2201
02:09:37,905 --> 02:09:40,770
You don't have a goddamn
passport, you son of a bitch!

2202
02:09:41,548 --> 02:09:43,146
You are fired!

2203
02:09:43,946 --> 02:09:45,951
You are fired!

2204
02:09:46,817 --> 02:09:49,185
You're fired!

2205
02:09:59,027 --> 02:10:00,559
You're fired.

2206
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:08,006
E., I...

2207
02:10:10,209 --> 02:10:12,637
Colonel, I gotta...
I'll talk him down.

2208
02:10:21,156 --> 02:10:23,285
This is colonel Tom Parker.
I wish it to be known

2209
02:10:23,421 --> 02:10:26,556
that Dr. Nick's services
are no longer required.

2210
02:10:26,691 --> 02:10:28,026
Thank you.

2211
02:10:29,462 --> 02:10:31,022
Hmm.

2212
02:10:31,157 --> 02:10:32,965
Well, disk in...

2213
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:35,495
If the boy wants to set out
on his own,

2214
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:38,562
it's all right by me,
but Presley enterprises

2215
02:10:38,698 --> 02:10:41,034
is going to cough up
what it owes.

2216
02:10:41,170 --> 02:10:43,141
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

2217
02:10:43,276 --> 02:10:45,675
Gasoline for the first trip

2224

What's the hold-up?

2225
02:11:15,405 --> 02:11:18,208
Sorry, e.P. Your daddy
won't come down.

2226
02:11:23,076 --> 02:11:24,082
Daddy.

2227
02:11:42,329 --> 02:11:44,266
What is this?

2228
02:11:44,402 --> 02:11:48,073
Well, that is what we owe
the colonel.

2229
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:52,572
We're broke.

2230
02:11:55,516 --> 02:11:58,243
Daddy, I've been playing this
mausoleum for a hundred years.

2231
02:11:58,378 --> 02:11:59,852
How could we be broke?

2232
02:11:59,988 --> 02:12:01,649
You spend so much money.

2233
02:12:01,785 --> 02:12:05,319
You know, you got the cars
and the girls and the clothes,

2234
02:12:05,454 --> 02:12:07,486
and all the...
You know, new airplane.

2235
02:12:07,622 --> 02:12:09,094
Daddy, you are
my business manager.

2236
02:12:09,229 --> 02:12:10,735
You're supposed
to be taking care of business.

2237
02:12:10,759 --> 02:12:13,422
I don't know what to tell you,
son, we're broke!

2238
02:12:13,557 --> 02:12:15,162
We're plain broke.

2239
02:12:15,297 --> 02:12:17,163
Gotta take the colonel back.

2240
02:12:17,299 --> 02:12:19,463
I am not taking him back.

2241
02:12:19,598 --> 02:12:21,205
We're gonna lose Graceland.

2242
02:12:33,788 --> 02:12:35,681
I am not taking him back!

2243
02:12:38,826 --> 02:12:40,124
He takes everything from me.

2244
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:42,520
He takes 50%
of everything that I make!

2245
02:12:42,655 --> 02:12:43,935
And now he wants
to take the home

2246
02:12:44,061 --> 02:12:45,526
that we bought for mama!

2247
02:12:46,767 --> 02:12:47,933
Listen to me, daddy.

2248
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:50,933
That old bastard
can sue if he wants,

2249
02:12:51,068 --> 02:12:52,863
but I am flying away.

2250
02:12:53,972 --> 02:12:55,503
With or without you.

2251
02:13:05,515 --> 02:13:08,888
Oh, you bloodsucking,
old vampire.

2252
02:13:09,024 --> 02:13:12,254
You bled me dry
and you still want more?

2253
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:14,653
I'm not an uncaring man,
Mr. Presley.

2254
02:13:14,789 --> 02:13:17,757
Don't you "Mr. Presley" me,
you toad.

2255
02:13:17,892 --> 02:13:20,933
If you are so determined
to get out of our contract...

2256
02:13:21,069 --> 02:13:22,430
You're goddamn right I want out.

2257
02:13:22,566 --> 02:13:24,398
Well, I will personally
loan you the money

2258
02:13:24,534 --> 02:13:26,434
that you owe
to jamboree attractions.

2259
02:13:26,570 --> 02:13:28,237
Yeah, you'll still have
your claws in me.

2260
02:13:28,373 --> 02:13:29,653
You'll still have me
working here

2261
02:13:29,737 --> 02:13:31,570
like a goddamn slave
in a salt mine,

2262
02:13:31,705 --> 02:13:34,036
you phony, no-good
piece of trash!

2263
02:13:34,171 --> 02:13:37,743
I ought a shoot you in your fat,
goddamn face!

2264
02:13:38,883 --> 02:13:40,147
Who are you?

2265
02:13:40,283 --> 02:13:42,346
I am you. And you are me.

2266
02:13:42,481 --> 02:13:43,981
Cut the horseshit!

2267
02:13:44,116 --> 02:13:46,156
Everything I've ever known
about you has been a lie.

2268
02:13:46,289 --> 02:13:47,887
E.P., you all good?

2269
02:13:48,023 --> 02:13:52,488
My past is the least
of your problems, my boy.

2270
02:13:52,623 --> 02:13:58,031
Everyone else you associate
with lives from you, Mr. Presley.

2271
02:13:58,166 --> 02:14:00,071
Even Vernon.

2272
02:14:00,207 --> 02:14:03,199
That's right,
even your own daddy

2273
02:14:03,335 --> 02:14:06,808
has looked after himself
before he's looked after you.

2274
02:14:06,943 --> 02:14:09,881
Yes, I have lived from
you, too, but the difference is

2275
02:14:10,016 --> 02:14:11,779
you have also lived from me.

2276
02:14:11,915 --> 02:14:16,613
We have supported each other.
Because we shared a dream.

2277
02:14:16,748 --> 02:14:20,051
We are the same, you and I.

2278
02:14:20,187 --> 02:14:25,626
We are two odd, lonely
children, reaching for eternity.

2279
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:31,066
Maybe you should fly away,
my boy.

2280
02:14:31,201 --> 02:14:35,040
Away from all of this.

2281
02:14:35,176 --> 02:14:39,035
But if you do choose to leave...

2282
02:14:40,742 --> 02:14:44,112
Then I, for one,
will be very lonely.

2283
02:14:44,247 --> 02:14:46,810
So would your father.

2284
02:14:46,946 --> 02:14:50,613
But I think you may
be lonely, too.

2285
02:14:53,521 --> 02:14:56,556
Oh, you see, my boy, the...

2286
02:14:56,692 --> 02:15:00,056
Truth about
the rock of eternity...

2287
02:15:03,369 --> 02:15:08,306
It is forever
just beyond our reach.

2288
02:15:36,635 --> 02:15:41,339
<i>Do the chairs in your parlor</i>

2289
02:15:43,076 --> 02:15:46,773
<i>seem empty and bare?</i>

2290
02:15:49,074 --> 02:15:53,384
<i>Do you gaze at your doorstep</i>

2291
02:15:55,186 --> 02:15:58,653
<i>picture me there?</i>

2292
02:16:00,988 --> 02:16:05,396
<i>Is your heart filled with pain?</i>

2293
02:16:06,726 --> 02:16:10,995
<i>Shall I come back again?</i>

2294
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:15,567
<i>Tell me, dear</i>

2295
02:16:15,703 --> 02:16:20,873
<i>are you lonesome tonight?</i>

2296
02:16:22,878 --> 02:16:27,286
<i>Is your heart filled with pain?</i>

2297
02:16:28,583 --> 02:16:32,885
<i>Shall I come back again?</i>

2298
02:16:34,862 --> 02:16:37,358
<i>Tell me, dear</i>

2299
02:16:37,494 --> 02:16:43,434
<i>are you lonesome tonight?</i>

2300
02:16:51,409 --> 02:16:54,511
Son, I know...
I know, I...

2301
02:16:57,214 --> 02:16:59,208
I wanna try and...

2302
02:17:00,883 --> 02:17:04,213
I wanna try and fix this.
You know...

2303
02:17:08,256 --> 02:17:09,460
Daddy...

2304
02:17:15,025 --> 02:17:17,259
Tell that son of a bitch...

2305
02:17:17,394 --> 02:17:19,767
I want things to go back
to the way they were.

2306
02:17:28,278 --> 02:17:29,282
And, daddy...

2307
02:17:31,979 --> 02:17:36,245
Tell the colonel
to send up Dr. Nick.

2308
02:17:54,465 --> 02:17:56,225
<i>It's a beautiful day
in Las Vegas,</i>

2309
02:17:56,300 --> 02:17:57,705
<i>with lots going on this weekend.</i>

2310
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:00,111
<i>Those teen sensations,
the Jacksons,</i>

2311
02:18:00,246 --> 02:18:01,810
<i>are causing a lot of excitement</i>

2312
02:18:01,945 --> 02:18:04,177
<i>with their residency
at the mgm grand.</i>

2313
02:18:04,313 --> 02:18:07,216
<i>And for the older crowd,
Elvis is back for a fifth year.</i>

2314
02:18:07,351 --> 02:18:08,717
<i>And don't we love him.</i>

2315
02:18:08,852 --> 02:18:10,547
<i>In entertainment news today,</i>

2316
02:18:10,682 --> 02:18:13,002

<i>tormented by his
growing waistline.</i>

2323
02:18:24,937 --> 02:18:26,867
<i>Sounds like it won't be
much of a stretch for him</i>

2324
02:18:27,002 --> 02:18:29,166
<i>to play the role
of a washed-up singer.</i>

2325
02:18:32,806 --> 02:18:34,875
Oh, look, here they come.

2326
02:18:37,309 --> 02:18:38,887
- Are you all right?
- Yep.

2327
02:18:38,911 --> 02:18:40,516
All right, daddy loves you.

2328
02:18:40,652 --> 02:18:43,012
- Bye, baby.
- Come on, baby.

2329
02:18:43,147 --> 02:18:44,489
- Bye, papa.
- Good girl.

2330
02:18:44,624 --> 02:18:46,656
- Bye, baby.
- Give me your hand.

2331
02:18:47,828 --> 02:18:49,219
Hi!

2332
02:18:49,355 --> 02:18:51,991
- Here she is.
- Hi, baby. How you doing?

2333
02:18:54,829 --> 02:18:56,360
Want to say goodbye to daddy?

2334
02:18:56,496 --> 02:18:59,504
- Bye, daddy.
- You're so good.

2335
02:19:01,198 --> 02:19:03,667
Hi. How are you?
How you doing?

2336
02:19:03,803 --> 02:19:05,169
We're okay.

2337
02:19:24,524 --> 02:19:25,728
Hey.

2338
02:19:27,032 --> 02:19:28,192
Hi.

2339
02:19:30,762 --> 02:19:31,965
Hmm.

2340
02:19:37,539 --> 02:19:39,071
How are you doing?

2341
02:19:54,254 --> 02:19:57,424
Honey, there's this place
in San Diego

2342
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,157
that you can go to rest.

2343
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:01,898
To heal.

2344
02:20:02,034 --> 02:20:04,004
After the show, you can fly
directly and be in a clinic

2345
02:20:04,028 --> 02:20:05,069
before anyone knows.

2346
02:20:05,205 --> 02:20:06,395
It's all been arranged.

2347
02:20:08,804 --> 02:20:11,070
I'm gonna be 40 soon, 'cilla.

2348
02:20:13,905 --> 02:20:16,105
Forty.

2349
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:18,583
And nobody's gonna remember me.

2350
02:20:21,113 --> 02:20:23,115
I never did anything lasting.

2351
02:20:25,618 --> 02:20:28,656
I never made that classic film
that I could be proud of.

2352
02:20:28,791 --> 02:20:30,925
But what about<i> a star is born?</i>

2353
02:20:32,925 --> 02:20:35,226
Uh...

2354
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:40,396
Barbra... the colonel...

2355
02:20:46,973 --> 02:20:49,981
Please go.

2356
02:20:50,116 --> 02:20:52,274
For Lisa?

2357
02:20:52,410 --> 02:20:54,817
If you dream it,
you can do it, baby.

2358
02:20:57,048 --> 02:20:58,755
I'm all out of dreams.

2359
02:21:01,325 --> 02:21:02,990
Promise me.

2360
02:21:37,027 --> 02:21:40,698
I... will always... love you.

2361
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:01,719
Hi, baby.

2362
02:22:47,164 --> 02:22:49,533
<i>Did you know
there's a kind of bird</i>

2363
02:22:49,668 --> 02:22:51,865
<i>that doesn't have any legs?</i>

2364
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,903
<i>So it can't land on nothing.</i>

2365
02:22:56,205 --> 02:22:58,303
<i>It lives its whole life
on the wing.</i>

2366
02:23:00,881 --> 02:23:04,644
When it gets tired,
it just spreads its wings

2367
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:07,147
and sleeps on the wind.

2368
02:23:10,089 --> 02:23:13,450
<i>If it ever does land,
even but one time...</i>

2369
02:23:16,186 --> 02:23:17,795
<i>So it dies.</i>

2370
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:22,657
<i>Good evening.</i>

2371
02:23:22,793 --> 02:23:25,934
<i>Elvis Presley died today.
He was 42.</i>

2372
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:27,838
<i>Apparently,
it was a heart attack.</i>

2373
02:23:27,973 --> 02:23:29,833
<i>He was found in his home
in Memphis...</i>

2374
02:23:29,968 --> 02:23:32,152
<i>President Carter
has just made a statement...</i>

2375
02:23:32,176 --> 02:23:33,736
<i>Elvis Presley's death</i>

2376
02:23:33,804 --> 02:23:36,109
<i>deprives our country
of a part of itself.</i>

2377
02:23:36,244 --> 02:23:37,872
<i>He was unique and irreplaceable.</i>

2378
02:23:38,008 --> 02:23:39,587
<i>Thousands
of mourners have gathered</i>

2379
02:23:39,611 --> 02:23:41,017
<i>outside the gates
of Graceland...</i>

2380
02:23:41,152 --> 02:23:42,792
<i>Using the styles
of white country</i>

2381
02:23:42,820 --> 02:23:44,650
<i>and black rhythm and blues,</i>

2382
02:23:44,785 --> 02:23:47,391
<i>permanently changed the face
of American popular culture.</i>

2383
02:23:47,527 --> 02:23:49,887
<i>The outpouring of
grief can be seen everywhere.</i>

2384
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:52,621
<i>He was a symbol
to people the world over,</i>

2385
02:23:52,756 --> 02:23:55,665
<i>of the vitality,
rebelliousness...</i>

2386
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:58,836
<i>What killed my boy?</i>

2387
02:23:58,971 --> 02:24:02,065
<i>Them doctors say
it was his heart.</i>

2388
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:04,540
<i>Others, the pills.</i>

2389
02:24:04,676 --> 02:24:08,076
<i>Some say it was me.</i>

2390
02:24:08,211 --> 02:24:11,849
<i>No. I'll tell you
what killed him.</i>

2391
02:24:13,144 --> 02:24:16,178
<i>It was love.</i>

2392
02:24:16,313 --> 02:24:18,587
<i>His love for you.</i>

2393
02:24:21,125 --> 02:24:23,662
<i>You know, a few weeks
before he died,</i>

2394
02:24:23,798 --> 02:24:27,696
<i>I saw him sing
for the very last time.</i>

2395
02:24:27,832 --> 02:24:29,999
<i>He could barely stand up.</i>

2396
02:24:31,295 --> 02:24:33,970
"Unchained melody."

2397
02:24:34,105 --> 02:24:37,369
From an album called
<i>unchained melody.</i>

2398
02:24:37,504 --> 02:24:41,375
Makes a lot of sense. Okay.

2399
02:24:41,511 --> 02:24:45,979
<i>But that night,
he sang as he always did.</i>

2400
02:24:46,114 --> 02:24:48,319
<i>With all his heart and soul.</i>

2401
02:24:48,455 --> 02:24:49,913
How you like it so far?

2402
02:24:53,024 --> 02:24:56,389
<i>That old voice rang out,</i>

2403
02:24:56,524 --> 02:25:01,057
<i>and he sang with all his life.</i>

2404
02:25:01,192 --> 02:25:06,534
<i>Oh, my love</i>

2405
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:08,870
<i>my darling</i>

2406
02:25:09,006 --> 02:25:13,169
<i>I've hungered for your touch</i>

2407
02:25:13,305 --> 02:25:19,015
<i>a long, lonely time</i>

2408
02:25:21,883 --> 02:25:27,390
<i>time goes by</i>

2409
02:25:27,526 --> 02:25:30,054
<i>so slowly</i>

2410
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:34,330
<i>and time can do so much</i>

2411
02:25:34,466 --> 02:25:36,730
<i>are you</i>

2412
02:25:36,865 --> 02:25:41,230
<i>still mine?</i>

2413
02:25:41,366 --> 02:25:48,275
<i>I need your love, ooh</i>

2414
02:25:49,549 --> 02:25:54,452
<i>I need your love</i>

2415
02:25:54,588 --> 02:26:00,016
<i>god speed your love</i>

2416
02:26:00,151 --> 02:26:04,588
<i>to me</i>

2417
02:26:06,297 --> 02:26:13,363
<i>lonely rivers flow to the sea
to the sea</i>

2418
02:26:13,498 --> 02:26:19,607
<i>to the open arms of the sea</i>

2419
02:26:22,074 --> 02:26:28,986
<i>Lonely rivers cry
wait for me wait for me</i>

2420
02:26:29,986 --> 02:26:33,292
<i>I'll be coming home</i>

2421
02:26:33,427 --> 02:26:38,496
<i>wait for me</i>

2422
02:26:38,632 --> 02:26:43,965
<i>my love, my darling</i>

2423
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:48,632
<i>I've hungered for your kiss</i>

2424
02:26:49,676 --> 02:26:55,875
<i>a long, lonely time</i>

2425
02:26:56,010 --> 02:26:57,554
<i>When I was a
child, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2426
02:26:57,578 --> 02:26:59,775
<i>I was a dreamer.
I read comic books</i>

2427
02:26:59,911 --> 02:27:02,514
<i>and I was the hero
of the comic book.</i>

2428
02:27:02,650 --> 02:27:05,956
<i>I saw movies and I was
the hero in the movie.</i>

2429
02:27:06,092 --> 02:27:08,055
<i>So every dream
that I ever dreamed</i>

2430
02:27:08,190 --> 02:27:10,456
has come true a hundred times.

2431
02:27:12,127 --> 02:27:18,794
<i>Are you still mine?</i>

2432
02:27:20,366 --> 02:27:27,308
<i>I need your love, ooh</i>

2433
02:27:30,544 --> 02:27:32,916
I learned very early
in life that...

2434
02:27:33,052 --> 02:27:36,019
"Without a song,
the day would never end,

2435
02:27:36,155 --> 02:27:38,780
without a song,
a man ain't got a friend,

2436
02:27:38,916 --> 02:27:42,019
without a song,
the road would never bend,

2437
02:27:42,154 --> 02:27:43,187
without a song."

2438
02:27:43,323 --> 02:27:45,088
So I keep singing a song.

2439
02:27:45,223 --> 02:27:47,892
<i>To...</i>

2440
02:27:48,028 --> 02:27:51,093
<i>Ooh-hoo</i>

2441
02:27:51,229 --> 02:27:55,072
<i>ooh</i>

2442
02:27:55,771 --> 02:27:57,100
<i>me</i>

2443
02:28:37,350 --> 02:28:40,084
<i>Elvis has left the building.</i>

2444
02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:00,335
<i>As the snow flies</i>

2445
02:29:02,274 --> 02:29:05,175
<i>on a cold and gray
Chicago mornin'</i>

2446
02:29:05,310 --> 02:29:07,512
<i>a poor little baby child is born</i>

2447
02:29:07,647 --> 02:29:09,311
<i>in the ghetto</i>

2448
02:29:12,818 --> 02:29:16,285
<i>and his mama cries</i>

2449
02:29:18,425 --> 02:29:21,420
<i>'cause if there's one thing
that she don't need</i>

2450
02:29:21,556 --> 02:29:24,155
<i>is another hungry mouth to feed</i>

2451
02:29:24,290 --> 02:29:26,361
<i>in the ghetto</i>

2452
02:29:29,232 --> 02:29:31,702
<i>people, don't you understand</i>

2453
02:29:31,838 --> 02:29:35,163
<i>the child needs a helping hand</i>

2454
02:29:35,299 --> 02:29:39,843
<i>or he'll grow to be
an angry young man some day</i>

2455
02:29:39,979 --> 02:29:42,307
<i>take a look at you and me</i>

2456
02:29:42,442 --> 02:29:45,877
<i>are we too blind to see?</i>

2457
02:29:46,013 --> 02:29:51,815
<i>Do we simply turn our heads
and look the other way</i>

2458
02:29:53,519 --> 02:29:57,557
<i>well, the world turns...</i>

2459
02:30:06,804 --> 02:30:09,498
<i>"You never
stood in that man's shoes</i>

2460
02:30:09,634 --> 02:30:12,034
<i>or saw things through his eyes</i>

2461
02:30:12,169 --> 02:30:14,603
<i>or stood and watched
with helpless hands</i>

2462
02:30:14,738 --> 02:30:17,543
<i>while the heart inside you dies</i>

2463
02:30:17,679 --> 02:30:20,345
<i>so help your brother
along the way</i>

2464
02:30:20,481 --> 02:30:23,220
<i>no matter where he starts</i>

2465
02:30:23,356 --> 02:30:28,717
<i>for the same god that made you
made him, too</i>

2466
02:30:28,852 --> 02:30:31,261
<i>these men with broken hearts"</i>

2467
02:30:32,865 --> 02:30:36,134
<i>and his mama cries</i>

2468
02:30:38,504 --> 02:30:41,272
<i>and a hungry, little boy
with a runny nose</i>

2469
02:30:41,407 --> 02:30:43,773
<i>plays in the street
as the cold wind blows</i>

2470
02:30:43,908 --> 02:30:45,539
<i>in the ghetto</i>

2471
02:30:49,014 --> 02:30:52,711
<i>and his hunger burns</i>

2472
02:30:54,354 --> 02:30:57,378
<i>so he starts to roam
the streets at night</i>

2473
02:30:57,514 --> 02:30:59,855
<i>and he learns how to steal
and he learns how to fight</i>

2474
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:01,918
<i>in the ghetto</i>

2475
02:31:05,731 --> 02:31:10,935
<i>then one night in desperation
the young man breaks away</i>

2476
02:31:11,070 --> 02:31:13,632
<i>he buys a gun, steals a car</i>

2477
02:31:13,768 --> 02:31:16,906
<i>tries to run,
but he don't get far</i>

2478
02:31:17,041 --> 02:31:20,772
<i>and his mama cries</i>

2479
02:31:45,162 --> 02:31:48,029
<i>On a cold and gray
Chicago mornin'</i>

2480
02:31:48,165 --> 02:31:51,676
<i>another little baby child
is born</i>

2481
02:31:51,811 --> 02:31:53,640
<i>in the ghetto</i>

2482
02:32:04,088 --> 02:32:07,192
<i>And his mama cries</i>

2483
02:32:21,932 --> 02:32:25,870
<i>Summer kisses, winter tears</i>

2484
02:32:30,809 --> 02:32:35,184
<i>summer kisses, winter tears</i>

2485
02:32:35,319 --> 02:32:39,685
<i>that was what she gave to me</i>

2486
02:32:39,821 --> 02:32:43,685
<i>never thought
I'd travel all alone</i>

2487
02:32:43,821 --> 02:32:49,993
<i>the trail of memories</i>

2488
02:35:23,817 --> 02:35:26,016
<i>Don't tiptoe, stomp my ground</i>

2489
02:35:26,152 --> 02:35:28,553
<i>gotta let 'em know we're comin'</i>

2490
02:35:28,688 --> 02:35:30,456
<i>just stay there, woman</i>

2491
02:35:30,592 --> 02:35:32,397
<i>engine still runnin'</i>

2492
02:35:32,532 --> 02:35:36,466
<i>get dressed

2493
02:35:36,602 --> 02:35:39,829
<i>god bless
gotta leave 'em shooken</i>

2494
02:35:39,965 --> 02:35:42,039
<i>girls goin' wild, too cray</i>

2495
02:35:42,175 --> 02:35:44,201
<i>look at what you made</i>

2496
02:35:44,336 --> 02:35:47,979
<i>always come correct

2497
02:35:48,115 --> 02:35:50,080
<i>takin' bigger steps</i>

2498
02:35:50,216 --> 02:35:52,047
<i>that's all I can do</i>

2499
02:35:52,182 --> 02:35:55,679
<i>that's all for the moment

2500
02:35:55,814 --> 02:35:57,880
<i>that's all right, mama</i>

2501
02:35:58,016 --> 02:36:00,057
<i>that's all right with you</i>

2502
02:36:00,192 --> 02:36:01,884
<i>that's all right, mama</i>

<i>that's all right now, mama

2506
02:36:12,898 --> 02:36:16,535
<i>we can't go on together</i>

2507
02:36:16,671 --> 02:36:19,103
<i>with suspicious minds</i>

2508
02:36:21,105 --> 02:36:25,049
<i>and we can't build our dreams</i>

2509
02:36:25,185 --> 02:36:28,145
<i>on suspicious minds</i>

2510
02:36:48,204 --> 02:36:54,402
<i>There must be peace
and understanding sometime</i>

2511
02:36:55,875 --> 02:36:57,912
<i>strong winds of promise</i>

2512
02:36:58,047 --> 02:37:03,483
<i>that will blow away
the doubt and fear</i>

2513
02:37:03,619 --> 02:37:07,888
<i>if I can dream of a warmer sun</i>

2514
02:37:08,024 --> 02:37:11,458
<i>where hope keeps shining
on everyone</i>

2515
02:37:11,594 --> 02:37:15,090
<i>tell me why, oh, why,</i>

2516
02:37:15,225 --> 02:37:22,067
<i>oh, why won't that sun appear</i>

2517
02:37:28,105 --> 02:37:30,812
<i>We're lost in a cloud</i>

2518
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:35,747
<i>with too much rain</i>

2519
02:37:35,882 --> 02:37:39,421
<i>we're trapped in a world</i>

2520
02:37:39,557 --> 02:37:43,288
<i>that's troubled with pain</i>

2521
02:37:43,424 --> 02:37:49,331
<i>but as long as a man
has the strength to dream</i>

2522
02:37:49,467 --> 02:37:56,365
<i>he can redeem his soul and fly</i>

2523
02:37:58,275 --> 02:38:01,141
<i>oh...</i>

2524
02:38:01,277 --> 02:38:07,046
<i>Deep in my heart,
there's a trembling question</i>

2525
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:12,321
<i>still I am sure that the answers</i>

2526
02:38:12,457 --> 02:38:15,826
<i>the answers gonna come somehow</i>

2527
02:38:15,961 --> 02:38:23,568
<i>out there in the dark,
there's a beckoning candle</i>

2528
02:38:23,703 --> 02:38:27,528
<i>and while I can think,
while I can talk</i>

2529
02:38:27,663 --> 02:38:31,736
<i>while I can stand,
while I can walk</i>

2530
02:38:31,871 --> 02:38:34,403
<i>while I can dream</i>

2531
02:38:35,414 --> 02:38:38,110
<i>please let my dream</i>

2532
02:38:39,317 --> 02:38:43,687
<i>come true</i>

2533
02:38:46,885 --> 02:38:50,723
<i>right now</i>

02:38:50,859 --> 02:38:53,191
<i>let it come true right now</i>

2535
02:38:54,232 --> 02:38:58,196
<i>oh, yeah</i>

2536
02:39:03,370 --> 02:39:04,952
<i>Thank you.</i>

2537
02:39:04,976 --> 02:39:06,456
<i>You're fantastic.
Thank you very much.</i>
