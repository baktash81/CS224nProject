1
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,400
Captain! Captain!

2
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,280
Ross! Strike!

3
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,040
Hold her down, Chen!

4
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,200
I got a strike!

5
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,040
- What you got?
- Its putting up a fight!

6
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,440
Dont let it get away.

7
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,520
- Maybe youd better give me a hand.
- Right.

8
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,960
Watch it!

9
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,640
OK, Mr Morgan, shes all yours.

10
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,240
Watch yourself!

11
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,200
Thanks. Heart attacks are so common.
Id hate to bury him at sea.

12
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,640
- Arthur! You reel him in.
- Shut up and give me another pill.

13
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,760
Open your mouth... There you go, sport.

14
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,960
OK, Chen. Lets haul it in.

15
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,480
OK, Chen. Now.

16
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Put a canvas over it, Chen.

17
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,240
- Where is it?
- Its in the bow, Mr Morgan.

18
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
- I like the way you did that.
- Thanks.

19
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,960
<i>Ahoy, Kingfisher!</i>

20
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
<i>Ahoy, West Wind!</i>

21
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,200
- Well race you!
- Why? You know I cant beat you.

22
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
- A sailboat take a fisher?
- I let them win.

23
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
- I can see why.
- Theyre girls!

24
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,560
See you at the dock, Ross!

25
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,680
- Sure is a beauty.
- Which one?

26
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,840
The boat! Sharp, aint she?

27
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,760
- Real yare, Jack.
- Ross.

28
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,000
Why dont you relax
and come get some sun with me?

29
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,720
- Why not check on your husband?
- No!

30
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,080
Take a look, Chen.

31
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
- Mr Morgan, hes sleeping.
- Thats him!

32
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,120
- Dont you feel sorry for me?
- In a way, yeah.

33
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,080
- You must get a lot of this.
- Quite a bit.

34
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,480
Youd think the fish smell
would keep them away.

35
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,120
- You wanna keep them away?
- No! I like girls.

36
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,920
- Not as much as the boat.
- I live on her. Id like to own her.

37
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,240
- Whats stopping you?
- Money.

38
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
That shouldnt be a problem.

39
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,160
- You must be kidding.
- No, I wouldnt do that.

40
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,760
I dont give to organised charity.

41
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000
But theres a big charge
in doing it this way.

42
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,440
- Individual cases.
- Mrs Morgan...

43
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,320
I dont accept charity.
I have to earn what I get.

44
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,240
You would, honey. You would.

45
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
- Ross.
- Hi.

46
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,960
When will you teach your daughters
to stow a sail?

47
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,000
Mr Morgan liked the boat.
Hell charter again.

48
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,160
Can I talk to you, please?

49
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,920
Whats the matter, Papa Stavros?

50
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,680
- Nothing.
- Somethings bugging you.

51
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,080
- The doctor says a bug is bugging me.
- Im sorry...

52
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,720
Today, he tells us we must move
to a dry climate, like Arizona.

53
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,680
- Arizona?
- Arizona.

54
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,760
Papa learn English
so they want him to move.

55
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,680
- What they speak there?
- Mama, this is not a joke.

56
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,960
- Dont worry, Ross. We wont move.
- But if youre sick...

57
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,400
Sick? A woman isnt as young as
she was, so they look for a reason.

58
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
- Then its not serious?
- Of course it is.

59
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,320
Dont listen. If he says he must
sell the boats, also dont listen.

60
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,360
Come to our wedding anniversary
on Wednesday night

61
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,080
and forget about all this.

62
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,320
- All right, Mama, thank you.
- Chen. You come, too.

63
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,320
Thank you, Mama.

64
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,440
Come on, Papa. You have made
enough trouble already.

65
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,280
Papa...

66
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,840
<i>The West Wind, too?</i>

67
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,640
Yes.

68
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,680
Hey, Sam.

69
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,560
- Hi, Ross.
- How are you?

70
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,080
Shell be off soon. Wait at the bar.

71
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,960
- Long time no see.
- Not so long.

72
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,320
To what disaster do I owe this visit?

73
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,040
- You know?
- No.

74
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,520
Only, I know when old head on
the shoulder Robin comes on.

75
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,000
I come when theres nothing wrong.

76
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,880
You come when you want to sing
a little or cry on my shoulder.

77
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,680
- Which is it tonight?
- I dont feel much like singing.

78
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,360
<i>Stavros is moving to Arizona, selling
the fishing boats and the West Wind.</i>

79
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,040
Good. Its the only way
to get it out of your system.

80
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,200
Its not that easy. Losing a home
and a job all in one day.

81
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,760
It might be worth it...
if you lose the dream, too.

82
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,200
Look, my father and I
built the boat together.

83
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,160
I wanted to own it.
Thats not a dream.

84
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,000
Your father is gone
and so is that part of your life.

85
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,400
The worst thing for you was
Papa letting you live on that boat.

86
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,680
- I can count on that speech.
- Count on me.

87
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,560
- Here we go again!
- Should I pretend I dont care?

88
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,720
Dont make things
tougher than they are!

89
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,480
Ready for your number, Robin?

90
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,400
Let Sir Galahad do it, OK?

91
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,440
- What are you doing to her, Ross?
- Nothing.

92
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,880
He just came in to tell me
his troubles and I told him mine.

93
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,240
- Its my fault.
- Its nobodys fault...

94
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,400
Jeez! Would somebody sing?

95
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,400
- Sure, Mac, sure.
- Thanks, pal.

96
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,680
Hey, you sing, Ross.
Come on, favour to me.

97
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,200
Great! Any time you wanna
make it permanent, let me know.

98
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,520
Thanks, Sam. Im still a fisherman.

99
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,960
- Whats this?
- The swinger with the mink look sent it.

100
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,720
- You must smell of musk or something.
- Excuse me.

101
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,440
I dont work here,
but thanks anyway.

102
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,080
- Whats the matter? Not enough?
- Want me to...?

103
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,920
- You sing lousy anyway.
- Thank you.

104
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,120
- I thought you sang very well...
- He stinks! The old stinkeroo.

105
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,360
- Ross Carpenter.
- Laurel Dodge.

106
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,840
Yes, sir.
The real old-fashioned stinkeroony.

107
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,640
- Whos the intellectual?
- A bad idea I had. Blind date.

108
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,520
- Hes blind, all right.
- Wait, pal, get your own date.

109
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,960
Had to call the cops, didnt you?

110
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
Thank you.

111
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,680
- Go cry on her shoulder.
- Wait a minute.

112
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,560
Youre Sir Galahad, all right,
to strangers.

113
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,120
- Im sorry I caused trouble for you.
- Dont give it a second thought.

114
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
Girls!

115
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
- What?
- You dropped a handkerchief.

116
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,160
- Come on!
- Got a match?

117
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,320
- Cut it out.
- I thought you needed help.

118
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,360
- I can get this from my enemies.
- I never saw him before.

119
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,480
- Honey, I gathered that.
- Now, you come on!

120
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,240
He said he was a friend
of my fathers and he wasnt.

121
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,400
OK, I believe you.

122
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,960
OK. Whos the girl?

123
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,680
She said she was an old football
buddy of my mothers, but she wasnt.

124
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,240
- Where do you live?
- Down the road.

125
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,120
- Very far?
- Not too far.

126
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,880
Lets go.

127
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,160
If youre trying to tire me, its working.

128
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,280
Whats the name of that church?

129
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,400
- The Old Church, everybody knows that.
- Ive never been here before.

130
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,240
Where do you come from?
Grand Rapids?

131
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,320
No. Cant we go back and go inside?

132
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,800
- Corpus Christi?
- No.

133
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,680
You could rest.
Maybe sing with the choir.

134
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,840
- Prattville, Oklahoma?
- No!

135
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,880
Its such a nice night. Wouldnt you
like to go to another local landmark?

136
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Only the one youre staying at.

137
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,160
- lll show you where Im staying.
- Good. Shall I call a cab?

138
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,640
- I dont think thats necessary.
- If you think Im gonna walk...

139
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,320
Well, here we are.

140
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,480
- Here?
- Its simple and it reeks of history.

141
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,480
- Reeks of something.
- Goodnight.

142
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,600
- Arent you asking me in?
- They double the rent for that.

143
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,480
- What do you think this place is?
- I want to find out.

144
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,000
Tomorrow.

145
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,520
- What time?
- Lunch?

146
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,760
- lll pick you up.
- Where are we eating?

147
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,560
The Mariners. Menu?

148
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,880
- Well meet there.
- You dont know it.

149
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,200
lll find it.

150
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,600
Youre sweet, Ross.

151
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,160
Then, why am I leaving?

152
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Would you like a room or anything?

153
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,720
If you dont mind parrots.

154
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,800
- Parrots?
- Yes.

155
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,560
You see, I have 23 darling creatures
who travel with me everywhere.

156
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,880
Of course, I always make
arrangements far ahead.

157
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,520
The Hilton people werent
at all understanding this time.

158
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,080
As a result, I find myself
and these poor creatures left...

159
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,440
You have to excuse me now.
Its their dinner time. Bye-bye, yall.

160
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,480
Bye-bye, now.

161
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,640
Bye-bye, now... Parrots?

162
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,960
Ross!

163
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,480
- Ross!
- Yes, sir.

164
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,400
You know Mr Johnson?

165
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,880
By reputation.

166
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,480
Mr Johnson is interested
in the boats.

167
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,600
- These the other boats?
- Yes.

168
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,120
Theyre in first-class shape,
Ross sees to that.

169
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,680
<i>How would I know? Lets shake down
the Kingfisher and lll tell you.</i>

170
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,640
Ross, he wants to take a ride.

171
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,840
Youre on, Skipper.

172
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,960
Hey, dont rev it up so much.
I dont want burnt valves.

173
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,200
- If I want.
- Cast off, Papa.

174
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,120
- Comin aboard, Papa?
- No, I gotta stay with Mama.

175
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,240
He doesnt wanna get
hot-rodded around by you.

176
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,280
Know something, Mr Johnson?
You may be right.

177
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,200
OK, Captain Blood.
Can we go home now?

178
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,840
- Why not?
- Can you handle a following sea?

179
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,120
- Like to try?
- No!

180
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,640
- Unless you can get some speed up.
- Speed, huh?

181
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,880
OK.

182
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,680
- Are you gonna buy the boats?
- At a price.

183
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,680
- I bet. Three top boats.
- Whats wrong with the fourth?

184
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,840
- Whatd you do with the sailboat?
- Make like a gentleman of the sea.

185
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,160
If the old manll throw it in.

186
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,720
- It wouldnt suit you.
- I have a girl it would.

187
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,360
- Wholl teach you to sail?
- She will.

188
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,640
Its her second-favourite sport.

189
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,360
Your butterflies opened. Two of em.

190
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,280
Thats the sea, unpredictable.
Have to clean the carburettor.

191
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,560
Shouldnt take a good mechanic
over five minutes.

192
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,760
Can you hold that for me?

193
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,880
Keep it turned away from you.
Its a little messy, you know.

194
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,160
Ross!

195
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,960
Ross!

196
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,040
Hello, Suzie Wong!

197
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,880
- Arent we getting repetitious?
- I came, I saw, I left.

198
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,880
I leave now.

199
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,160
You were very late. I waited.

200
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,760
- You picked up an ageing gentleman.
- My father.

201
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,120
Thats no gentleman,
thats my father.

202
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,400
- lll make my own jokes, thanks.
- Its not funny. Its sad.

203
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,440
You didnt show.
Hes in town so I called him.

204
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,600
Why am I always explaining?

205
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,960
Maybe its something you do.
The hotel never heard of you.

206
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,520
- Trust me on that one.
- Why?

207
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,840
Because I went to the trouble
of asking where I could find you,

208
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,360
and you like games as well as I do.

209
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,280
Come aboard and play.

210
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,520
- Tell me the rules.
- I got a feeling youd cheat.

211
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,600
Thats usually what ladies say
to gentlemen.

212
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,720
- I just came to mend fences.
- Ever tried canvas?

213
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,520
- Can you stitch?
- I kicked the habit.

214
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,360
- Sit down. Coffee?
- Save it for tonight.

215
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,680
- What happens tonight?
- Dinner.

216
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,320
Im taking you to dinner!
Well eat at my bosss house.

217
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,720
- If youre broke...
- Im not.

218
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,600
I hope youre not dreary
about money.

219
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,440
We go where I can afford
or not at all.

220
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,400
Its Papa and Mama Stavros
anniversary.

221
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,640
lll meet you at 7.30 sharp.
No wandering around hotel lobbies.

222
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,800
7.30 sharp.

223
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,840
Whats she doing here? Is the fleet in?

224
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,880
- Lay off, Robin.
- Ditto.

225
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,440
Wanna come aboard?

226
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,240
I wouldnt get aboard
Cleopatras barge with you.

227
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,520
- Why did you come?
- To apologise for the other night.

228
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,480
- I accept.
- I withdraw.

229
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,960
- I didnt know you had company.
- Robin.

230
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,280
- Youre a fast worker.
- I know youre upset.

231
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,800
Im not upset. Im hurt. H-U-R-T.

232
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,520
You know how it is
between you and I.

233
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I dont want to hear that.

234
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,360
I know how it is between us.
I also know how it could be, OK?

235
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,920
OK.

236
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,160
Youll come back this time,
like you always do.

237
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,920
All right, Robin, all right.

238
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,000
Are you? Tell me.

239
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,160
I dont know.

240
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,760
Sir Galahad.

241
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,760
Youre Sir Galahad,
Don Juan and Casanova rolled into one.

242
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,040
If it isnt this boat, its girls.
Girls, girls, girls!

243
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,600
And dont you follow me!

244
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,640
Sir? Could you tell me...?

245
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,560
Scat! Get outta here! Scat!

246
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,120
- This is really your family, isnt it?
- Well, sort of.

247
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,800
I never knew my mother.
We lost her when I was born.

248
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,320
When my dad died, I had to sell
the boat to pay for everything, so...

249
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,560
You dont have to explain to me.
Im sorry theyre leaving.

250
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,840
Quiet, please! Quiet!

251
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,760
A toast from Linda and me
to Mama and Papa,

252
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,320
for taking the trouble
to meet, marry and get us born.

253
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,960
It was no trouble at all!

254
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,240
Excuse me.

255
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,160
Many happy years to you, Mama
and Papa Stavros. Best of health.

256
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,880
- This is for you.
- Thank you, Ross!

257
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,000
- Ross, what do I get?
- You got Mama!

258
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,640
Please, dont cry, Mama.
Thats not good for you.

259
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,440
Mama!

260
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,080
- Its so pretty!
- I know, but dont cry.

261
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,760
Shes running just fine. Just fine.

262
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,560
You love this boat.

263
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,840
Oh, yeah. My father and I spent
every spare minute working on it.

264
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,680
We measured, sanded
and polished every board.

265
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,360
My dad was a great guy.
Youd have liked him.

266
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,480
And then, the day it was finished

267
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,400
was the day he died.

268
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,640
Somehow the boat meant...

269
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,000
Im sorry. Were getting too serious.

270
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,800
Were supposed to be relaxing!
Nice day, nice breeze...

271
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,080
- Nice boy.
- Nice girl.

272
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,840
- I like you!
- I dont know why!

273
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,240
Lets live to find out!

274
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,600
<i>KO V Marine Channel repeating
emergenct weather report.</i>

275
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,760

<i>Small craft warnings have been hoisted.

277
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,160

278
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,960

- No, well go to Paradise Cove.

279
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,120

Boys, put away.

285
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,680
Good to see you, Ross. We hear
from son Chen you got trouble.

286
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,400
Small trouble. Big for me.

287
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,760
Laurel, Kin Yung. He runs the place.
Laurel Dodge.

288
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,320

- How do you do?

289
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,440

307
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,760
Youd better go in.

308
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,200
- Oh! Not Robin!
- Definitely not.

309
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,560
- Madam Yung, Laurel.
- Pretty name. Sit down.

310
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,440
You, too, Ross.

311
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,280
- String some pea-pods.

312
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,760

313
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,120
String any peas before?

314
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,440
- You know this one long?
- Forever. 24 hours.

315
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,680
- No harm done yet. Hows Chen?
- Hes fine.

316
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,720
Chen very fine son. Very scarce.

317
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,400
Ross adopted son. Also very scarce.
Except when in trouble.

318
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,080
Stand in line if you wanna lecture me!

319
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,640

- We help, too!

321
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,840
Miss Laurel, you are guest.
You can clean shrimp.

322
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,520
Children, dinner time.
Better go home.

323
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,040
- Bye, Miss Laurel.
- Goodbye.

324
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,080
- Bye, kids.
- Bye, Ross.

325
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,920
Work!

326
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,720
Excuse me.

327
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,600
Here. I wouldnt want you to starve.

328
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,480
- Its not very filling.
- Ive had plenty.

329
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,880
Even if you full,
you hungry one hour later.

330
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,840
You make date with Chinese girl,
same thing.

331
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,200
One hour later,
you want second date.

332
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,040
Old men remember small things
very big. Old Chinese proverb.

333
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,200
Dinner finished.

334
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,120
You wash dishes. I show young
couple calm before storm from porch.

335
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,640
Young couple look at own calm
before storm. You help wash dishes.

336
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,080
Honourable ancestors do not approve
of men in kitchen!

337
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,200
Use honourable detergent!

338
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,880
Ross. Very pretty on porch
this time of night.

339
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,040
Shall we?

340
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,560
- Put your sweater on.
- What a beautiful view!

341
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,280
Looks like rain to me.

342
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,080
Help!

343
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,000
- There you go.
- I like the Yungs.

344
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,160
- They like you.
- Do they like Robin, too?

345
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,200
The Chinese are inscrutable,
dont express their feelings.

346
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,040
- Isnt damp air bad for instruments?
- It can only improve this one.

347
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,080
Sing something lute-ish.

348
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,320
Gotcha!

349
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,400
- Whats so funny?
- You sing Chinese velly funny!

350
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,600
Me sing Chinese velly funny!

351
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,480
Everybody wants to be a critic.
Think you can do better?

352
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,240
That means...

353
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,000
Earth boy dream of angel

354
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,520
Make him have happy heart

355
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,680
In land of love

356
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,360
Angel dream of earth boy

357
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,640
In land of love

358
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,320
Youd better run! lll get you!

359
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,000
Run home to your mama.
Too late for children to be up.

360
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,760
Too late for anybody to be up.

361
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,560
- Is she trying to tell us something?
- Something.

362
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,400
I wonder what it could be.

363
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,400
- You go to bed now.
- A mans home is his castle.

364
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,440
Kin, you sleep with
brother-in-law next door.

365
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,640
Kin doesnt like to sleep
with brother-in-law. He snores.

366
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,720
You sleep with brother-in-law!

367
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,480
- Sleep well.
- Goodnight.

368
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,440
Ross, Laurel, you come with me.

369
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,160
Laurel, you sleep with me.
Ross, you on couch.

370
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,760
- Goodnight.
- Night.

371
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,520
Night.

372
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,040
I must have gotten
the wrong fortune cookie.

373
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,920
Laurel...? Laurel!

374
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,560
Laurel!

375
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,840
<i>Ahoy, West Wind!</i>

376
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,200
One if by land...

377
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,760
...and two if by sea.

378
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,720
We can weigh anchor, Admiral.
Im ready.

379
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,360
Its no fit night for man nor beast.

380
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,000
Its not sensational here, either.

381
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,440
- Frightened?
- Terrified! Lets watch.

382
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,080
Good idea.

383
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,880
Why do you feel
so much more alive in a storm?

384
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,480
I dont know.

385
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:55,080
Maybe its because everything
seems more intense, more real.

386
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,080
This is real.

387
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
Yes.

388
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,960
You sound doubtful.

389
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,160
- Youre not too real yourself.
- Not yet.

390
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,840
- Youre not married, are you?
- Almost.

391
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,480
Is that what
youre running away from?

392
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,960
Yes. Lets not talk any more.

393
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,240
You still love him?

394
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,960
He didnt love me.

395
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,160
- I didnt ask you that.
- I was hurt.

396
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,720
- The whole thing was such a lie.
- What about him?

397
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,120
Thats why my father
brought me here from Chicago.

398
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,120
Its over with,
but Im just not all together yet.

399
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,920
Youre together enough for me.

400
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,200
I couldnt stand being fooled again.

401
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,480
Its me. And it is real. Isnt it?

402
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,440
- Were getting wet.
- Do you care?

403
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,280
I dont want to care about anything!

404
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,760
- Goodbye, Ross!
- Bye, Miss Laurel!

405
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,360
Come back soon!

406
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,160
- Bye, kids!
- Goodbye, everybody!

407
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,720
Bye!

408
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,760
Papa Stavros! What are you doing?

409
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,880
I didnt expect you.
Hello, Miss Dodge.

410
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,240
- Whats the ledger for?
- Marine insurance.

411
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,120
- They want the gear itemised.
- I itemised it last month.

412
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,680
Well, this is sort of an inventory.

413
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,600
Ross. I sold the boats.

414
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,560
You sold em? All?

415
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Johnson said, Take it or leave it.
I need the money for the house...

416
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,920
- You dont have to explain.
- Well, I just...

417
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,080
How soon does he take over?

418
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,600
- Ross. The trouble is...
- lll get my gear packed.

419
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,360
No, no! Tonight, tomorrow...
Goodbye, now.

420
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,840
- Where will you live?
- Chen can take me in for a while.

421
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,960
What are you gonna do?

422
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,800
Yep. Im gonna see him now.
Right now.

423
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,960
- Chen?
- Nope, Johnson.

424
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,360
- lll take you home.
- lll get a cab. Go see him.

425
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,280
Wait. You were going to let me
take you home, werent you?

426
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,600
I live at 136 Bay Street.
lll be waiting.

427
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,760
- I dont know how long...
- lll be waiting!

428
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,720
- We knock, Skipper.
- And we take advantage of old men.

429
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,280
This was no Greek bearing gifts. I paid.

430
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,760
<i>Will you sell the West Wind?</i>

431
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,400
Depends. I dont own anything
without a price.

432
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,840
- How much?
- Ten thousand.

433
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,120
- What dyou pay Stavros?
- Six.

434
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,480
- Youre a thief!
- A businessman. Got the money?

435
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,440
- You know I havent got any.
- Why are you wasting my time?

436
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,080
Johnson... Whatll you do
with the fishing boats?

437
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,560
Dry dock. Painting and refitting.

438
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,840
Theyll be out of circulation
for a while. And so will you.

439
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,640
- Want to work for me?
- Doing what?

440
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,240
- Fishing for tuna.
- No dice.

441
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,040
- lll tell you...
- lll tell you what youre gonna do.

442
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,000
Get your junk off my sailboat. Now.

443
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,840
Hold on, Skipper!

444
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,440
<i>Youll get nowhere with games
like choking the Kingfishers engine.</i>

445
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,840
All that did was let me knock
the sale price down.

446
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,880
All right, you want a job?

447
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,280
Then will you sell me the boat
for so much a week?

448
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,200
Everythings for sale.
But I wont promise not to sell her.

449
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,880
- What do you pay a captain?
- Captain?

450
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,120
Shouldnt you be a deck-hand first?

451
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,680
Sixty bucks a trip. If you really want
the boat, make two trips a week.

452
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,600
- Commercial captains get a percentage.
- Not if theyre inexperienced.

453
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,080
Why pay me a salary?

454
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,640
This way, the more I haul,
the more we both make.

455
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,200
- What percentage?
- Ten percent.

456
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,120
- Two.
- Seven.

457
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,040
- Five and I see the books.
- OK. Deal.

458
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,280
- Chen Yung goes with it.
- Sure.

459
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,600
- Thats how generous I am.
- Real generous.

460
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,600
- Drink?
- If yours is a Mickey.

461
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,800
You know, I like you.
You remind me of me.

462
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,320
- Trying to get me to blow the deal?
- Be here tomorrow. 3 a. m.

463
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,720
- And you can stay on the sailboat.
- Want me to maintain it, too?

464
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,480
You will, Skipper. You will.

465
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,520
- I came to talk to you, Sam.
- Good.

466
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,720
- Well?
- Got room for another singer?

467
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,520
The other dame sings, too?
Youre becoming a specialist.

468
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,240
- I sing.
- Ive been telling you that.

469
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,400
- Im available.
- What made you decide, now?

470
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,240
- Money.
- Ive offered you money before.

471
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,320
I didnt need it before.
How much can I make?

472
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,120
Scale to begin with.
More if youre a big draw.

473
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,600
This wont affect Robin. She stays.

474
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,200
Of course. She stays.

475
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,640
Sam, dont say anything about it.
lll tell her tomorrow, OK?

476
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,880
- Where are you going?
- I got a date.

477
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,280
- Theres a nice crowd. Go on now.
- I cant tonight.

478
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,520
Fishing, singing and hunting?
That makes for a full day.

479
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,600
Youre gonna have
to give up something.

480
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,320
Come on, Ross.
I want to see if I made a good deal.

481
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,560
All right, Sam.

482
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,600
- Doctor Livingstone!
- Hi!

483
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,600
Somehow this isnt how I imagined
the big reconciliation.

484
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,560
Good evening.

485
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,600
Regular patrons know Ross Carpenter,
whos sung here many times.

486
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,760
Tonight, Ross sings for the first time
as a professional.

487
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,600
Hell be here regularly from now on.

488
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,120
Lets all wish him a lot of luck.

489
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,560
Thats what I was trying to tell you.

490
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Thought you were letting me tell her.
Thanks.

491
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,560
Sorry.

492
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,560
Play it again! More!

493
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,240
- More!
- Come on! More!

494
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,040
Ross?

495
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,320
Ross?

496
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,760
- More!
- Sing it again!

497
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,520
- Robin, I was going to...
- You go the whole route, dont you?

498
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,240
Pull the rug from under me,
take the bread out of my mouth.

499
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,080
It sounds complicated.
Im keeping the wolf from the door.

500
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,600
- From the boat!
- Im singing for the money to buy it.

501
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,160
Im doing two jobs at once.
It doesnt affect you.

502
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,200
You bet it doesnt.

503
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,400
- Can I go now?
- Anchors away!

504
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,560
- Youre a busy boy!
- Youre not on my back, too!

505
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,720
The other one was just here.
She went that-a-way.

506
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,680
Laurel!

507
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,360
Laurel!

508
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,520
- People dont stand me up.
- Im not people.

509
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,600
And this is your second try.

510
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,400
- What were you doing with Robin?
- Sam gave me a job.

511
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,680
- Fishing?
- Yeah, the place is full of tuna!

512
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,240
Very funny!

513
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,000
When Im not working for Johnson,
Im here.

514
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,640
When do you work at us? Split shift?

515
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,920
- I need the money.
- Money isnt that important.

516
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,560
Not when youve got it.
Its important to me.

517
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,560
How come it isnt to you?

518
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,400
- Its what you buy that matters.
- Hes not going to give me the boat.

519
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,040
- And not much else means anything.
- Thats right. Until I do buy it.

520
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,440
I thought it was Robin.
I wish it was, I could fight that.

521
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,080
- You dont understand.
- Ive never wanted anything that badly.

522
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,720
Who and what are you
that lets you play it this cool?

523
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,320
Did you forget something?

524
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,240
Im sure she isnt cool
and she really understands.

525
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,280
Why dont you go back to her?

526
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,240
- No comment?
- Im thinking of the answer.

527
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,880
- Have you found it?
- Yeah, Ive found it.

528
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,720
Lets see if we catch more bait than tuna.

529
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,880
Havent had much luck
catching anything yet.

530
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,240
Wheres the bait?
We got a net full of water!

531
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,240
We havent got enough bait
for a sardine, much less a tuna!

532
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,840
Start the engines.
Lets make another haul.

533
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,680
Head out to sea, Chen.

534
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,080
Hey! Kill the engine!
Take it out of reverse!

535
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,560
Kill it! Kill it!

536
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,320
Kill it!

537
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,480
Gee, Ross. Im sorry.

538
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,280
Oh, well. Save the pieces.
Johnsonll want to count em.

539
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,240
We go home now?

540
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,200
Unless you want to catch
a tuna by hand!

541
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,360
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

542
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,800
- Lot different than game fishing.
- Or shrimping.

543
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,840
I used to do that off New Orleans.

544
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,600
New Orleans.
I wish I was there right now.

545
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,200
- Well, lll be...
- How long to fix it?

546
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,880
- Too long.
- How soon for a new section?

547
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,880
No wonder youre in a hurry.

548
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,280
If that trips a sample,
youll have to live out there.

549
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,560
Mr Johnson! Thats it.

550
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,800
- One ton!
- I read more.

551
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,080
- Maybe 20 pounds more.
- 1 ton, 20 pounds. How much?

552
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,960
lll have to check todays prices.
Lets go to the office.

553
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,160
Where you got that
trick adding machine!

554
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,880
Why the For Sale sign?

555
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,120
How do you sell a boat if you dont let
people know its for sale?

556
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,480
Thought you had a girl
that just loved sailing?

557
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,080
That was last week.
This week, she likes staying home.

558
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,840
- Knitting.
- Youre funny.

559
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,200
Honey, whats todays price?

560
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,440
Now give me the one on tuna.

561
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,040
Thank you, honey.

562
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:09,800
Your cuts $23. So, figuring $110
for a new section, you owe me $87.

563
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,960
Mr Johnson, dont go without
food and water until you get it.

564
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,560
- You wanted a percentage.
- On profit!

565
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,640
- Wheres the profit?
- Next trip. If I make a next trip.

566
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,680
- I got 20 bucks says you will.
- Its a bet.

567
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,760
lll show you what kind of guy I am.
Call it square.

568
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,240
- lll pay for the net.
- No.

569
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,760
- $23 and you pay for the net.
- No.

570
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,000
All right. You owe me $20
on your bet, because Im through.

571
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,320
Five, ten,

572
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,520
fifteen, twenty.

573
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,560
Skipper!

574
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,920
21, 22, 23.
Youre a rough beginner!

575
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,520
Im learning from you, Pops,
Im learning from you!

576
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,760
- Hi!
- Hi!

577
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,160
Dont be nervous. I come as a friend.

578
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,520
- Why are you all made up?
- This is what ladies wear to work.

579
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,840
- This is called a hat.
- Oh, a hat.

580
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,800
- I got a job.
- As what? Mata Hari?

581
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,240
No, selling ladies hats.
Nothing mysterious about that.

582
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,480
- Are you still mad at me?
- No.

583
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,840
- How are things?
- Not too good.

584
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,280
- Hes selling the boat.
- I know.

585
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,280
- What about that lunch?
- I cant. Im due at the shop.

586
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,760
- Arent you carrying this too far?
- Theres dinner.

587
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,880
- Id like to cook for you.
- You know what youre doing?

588
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:50,360
Youll find out when you taste
the cooking. Remember the address?

589
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,160
- 136 Bay Street.
- And lll be waiting.

590
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,400
- Try not to detour this time.
- Try not to detour this time!

591
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,360
- Hello!
- Do something!

592
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,480
- What?
- The ovens on fire!

593
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,560
Dont get excited.

594
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,240
- Got any salt?
- Just ground pepper or oregano.

595
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,400
- Looking for salt?
- No, a place to hide.

596
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,440
- If I have any, it will be up there.
- Thanks.

597
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,080
This is salt.
Im gonna show you something.

598
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,720
Its an old wives trick.

599
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,520
Maybe its a little too well done.

600
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,440
How can you say that?

601
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,840
You dont have an old wife?

602
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,280
- Its kind of late...
- You never said!

603
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,520
You never asked! No!

604
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,160
This is white wine.
Got any canned shrimp or crab?

605
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,920
Yes, but the dressing I bought
goes with cheese.

606
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,080
- Got any oil?
- I dont mind the squeak.

607
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,520
- Salad oil!
- I have some from the drugstore.

608
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,760
Never mind! Forget it.

609
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,080
See the little box? Pick it up.

610
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,880
Attagirl! Put it in your little hand.

611
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,000
Come in here.

612
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,800
Light the candles.
Take off your shoes.

613
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,040
Smoke your corn-cob pipe
and dinnerll be ready in a jiffy.

614
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,080
Papas gonna cook the dinner.

615
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,080
Mustnt play with matches!

616
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,800
- Coffee in the living room, Madam?
- Please.

617
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,600
- Cream and sugar?
- Black, thank you.

618
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:51,920
Shall I drown that out? Next door
have very far-out tastes in music.

619
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,520
I kind of like it.
Maybe its the way I feel.

620
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,240
- Dinner wasnt that bad?
- Best meal I ever cooked!

621
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,520
Ross, its still the boat, isnt it?

622
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,840
You think Im dingy, dont you?

623
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,560
You can want a thing for
the right reason. But prepare yourself.

624
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,720
- If shes sold?
- Yes.

625
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,520
Well, the good thing is I wont have
to work for Johnson any more.

626
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,480
Shh...! Its a fight!

627
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:32,200
- Theyre arguing about bracelets.
- What did she say?

628
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,680
She says if he feels that way,
he can have them back.

629
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,200
He got em back!

630
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,120
Shes working up to bigger things.

631
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,960
Theyre not fighting.
I hope theyre married!

632
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,400
Yeah, me, too.

633
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,440
Just trying to make em feel at home.

634
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,880
These walls not only have ears,
they got hands, feet, broomsticks...

635
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,040
My turn!

636
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,520
Well, hello!

637
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,160
Youre Mr Johnson?

638
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,240
Or Im stealing his liquor.

639
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,640
- Bloody Mary?
- Laurel Dodge.

640
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,240
Come in and close the door!

641
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,960
- Wont you join me in my vice?
- Im touched. But Im on business.

642
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,720
In that case, lll have this later.
Sit down.

643
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,440
Im better on my feet.
Im told its a must with you.

644
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,080
- Flattery will get you everywhere.
- I doubt it.

645
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:16,280
- Id like to buy the sailboat.
- A lot of people would.

646
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,360
- They come every morning.
- Im here this morning.

647
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,840
- Its $10,000, Miss...
- Dodge. Like in Detroit?

648
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,240
You dont have to club me!

649
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,200
- 10,000 is too much.
- But thats the price.

650
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,120
- I know what you paid.
- Everybody knows what I paid.

651
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:37,640
You have to want to buy more
than I want to sell. And I bet you do.

652
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,440
- Not that much.
- Good. We can forget the boat.

653
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,520
- Lunch? A drive?
- Seven?

654
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:48,760
- Oclock? Dinner? Even better!
- 8,000, thats all Ive got.

655
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,680
Would you like a loan till next week?

656
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,920
The interest would be too high.

657
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,000
Stay a while!
Im not as tough as I seem.

658
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,320
- Im sure. But youre as greedy.
- Im just trying to be nice.

659
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,800
If you want to sweet-talk me,
do it in numbers!

660
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,200
Temper, Miss Dodge! Temper!

661
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,080
<i>$ 10,000!

01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,560
<i>I know, I just gave it to tou.

01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,360

01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,560
<i>- lll tell you when I see you.

666
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,000
Youll only make a big thing of it.

667
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,680
Please, deposit the $2,000
in my account and trust me.

668
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,440
<i>Are tou sure its nothing medical?</i>

669
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,720
Thats my pop!

670
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,200
<i>- Is that you breathing?
- Who is he?</i>

671
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,400
<i>- A fisherman.
- A marlin fisherman?</i>

672
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,920
No, Daddy. Not marlin. Tuna.

673
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,800
<i>- Tuna!
- People have to eat!</i>

674
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,920
Im gonna write that cheque now,
Daddy. Bye!

675
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,280
OK. Thanks.

676
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,720
Mr Johnson.

677
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,400
That must be it.
Youre from Alcoholics Anonymous!

678
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,280
Youre gaping, Mr Johnson!

679
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,840
Its a Chicago bank.
Itll take a few days to clear.

680
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:24,360
The boat can stay here.
Im not asking you to wrap it up!

681
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,880
Youre in the big time now.
Lets not be so shook up.

682
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,560
- That Im saving for someone else.
- Just one condition.

683
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,360
- What?
- Dont tell anyone I bought it.

684
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,640
- I promise. Let me show you...
- Thats not necessary.

685
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,400
I have to! Dont want your diamonds
caught in the rigging!

686
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,120
- Thank you. lll manage.
- A toast to the new owner.

687
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,440
- Its a custom of the sea.
- I look forward to it.

688
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,640
Remember, Im serious
about keeping this secret.

689
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:56,360
- Want me to sign in blood?
- Would you?

690
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,760
Bring in another one!

691
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,360
Attaboy! Bring in another one!

692
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,400
Hey, Chen!

693
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,680
Attaboy! Bring in another one!

694
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,400
Beautiful!

695
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,720
What did you do?
Hijack another boat?

696
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:01,680
- Get em unloaded. Fast!
- You heard! Get em unloaded.

697
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,440
Sure is a happy one!

698
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,040
You gotta say one thing for him.
He sure...

699
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,600
He sure is! Weigh em and load em.

700
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,160
Thats the last truck-load.
Take it away!

701
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,040
- Whats the figure?
- Gross weight.

702
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,520
- And that?
- The days price per ton!

703
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,800
- Whats that sneaky little figure?
- Sliding scale differential.

704
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,920
- What does that mean?
- It means your share is $71.59.

705
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,720
Your differential friend has thrown you
a curve. I make it $103.

706
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,560
- Thats without the sliding scale.
- Sos our deal.

707
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,280
Bigger load, smaller percentage.
Its standard.

708
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,440
- In the numbers racket?
- Everyone accepts it.

709
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,920
Mr Johnson!

710
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,560
The more I haul,
the bigger your cut.

711
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,680
I was nice when you blew
your first run. Dont push me!

712
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,520
Johnson! Id rather
you be honest than nice.

713
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:18,240
- $71 is good for a days work.
- $103 is better. Its what we agreed.

714
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,520
$71 and 59 cents.

715
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,160
Count out the rest, Mr Johnson.

716
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,480
You just dont understand business.

717
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,960
Johnson!

718
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,360
The For Sale signs off.

719
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,360
- Usually is when you sell.
- Who bought it?

720
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,120
Thats classified material, Skipper.

721
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,880
Pick up your money.

722
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,920
This just came in.

723
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,800
I know its new...

724
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,200
...but is it really me?

725
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:11,280
I think it captures your image
extremely well, Mrs Figgot.

726
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:16,000
Oh! That one over there has
a teeny-weensy bit more elan.

727
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,320
I dont think so. This is...

728
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,960
Ive always loved roses...

729
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:29,080
This one is so beautifully
understated, dont you think?

730
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,080
- Absolutely muted.
- lll take it.

731
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,200
- Put it on my account.
- Yes.

732
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,080
Now...! Lets check...

733
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,040
No!

734
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,960
- Im sorry. We ran out of boxes.
- Thats all right.

735
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,000
I just love the hat! Bye!

736
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,240
Laurel...

737
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,160
- Where is it?
- Its been sold.

738
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,240
- It was mine!
- I know.

739
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,720
Why didnt you do something?

740
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,040
- Are you just going to stand there?
- Can we go?

741
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,280
This is outrageous.
I will not stand for it.

742
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,440
- Mr Peabody!
- I heard the sound of conflict.

743
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,840
- You must be the manager.
- Yes, Madam.

744
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,880
Im Mrs Figgot.

745
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,200
- Thats a name you dont fool with!
- Im taking my coffee break.

746
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,720
Miss Dodge!

747
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,800
- The penalty for desertion...
- Mr Peabody!

748
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,680
<i>How did you know
Johnson sold the West Wind?</i>

749
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,440
I went to the docks to look for you
and they were taking the sign off.

750
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,880
- Good afternoon.
- Come with me, please.

751
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:51,080
- May I take your order?
- Two coffees, two salads. OK?

752
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,600
Bring the coffee now, please.

753
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,640
Theres something I must tell you.
The man I told you about...

754
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,520
That wasnt the first time
Id been fooled.

755
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,680
- With you...
- With me, what?

756
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,240
With you it was different.

757
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:12,320
It wasnt me before, it was my money.

758
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,200
Oh! Thats the mystery. Youre rich.

759
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,960
Yes.

760
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,680
- Try to live with it!
- Dont!

761
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,920
- You dont know what its like.
- No, I dont!

762
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,200
You look at every man suspiciously.

763
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:31,920
I had to find someone
whod love me for myself.

764
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:37,560
- Ive been very lucky.
- Weve both been lucky, that way.

765
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,320
<i>- Why are you telling me this now?
- I bought the West Wind, Ross.</i>

766
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,720
- Where are you going?
- I dont know.

767
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,080
Im going with you.

768
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,840
- What have I done?
- Look...

769
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,120
When my father died,
I lived on what people gave me.

770
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:03,520
Clothes that didnt fit,
toys that had been thrown out.

771
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,640
I thought the food I ate was because
someone had finished with it.

772
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,160
Youll never understand.
A man must work for what he wants.

773
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,440
I have a right to do this for you.
I love you!

774
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:20,600
I dont take handouts from anybody.
I dont want to be kept.

775
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,160
Arent we working a little early today?

776
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,840
- You sing very well.
- I hear youre talented, too.

777
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,600
- Im sorry how things turned out.
- Boo-hoo.

778
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,400
- We had a fight.
- Tough.

779
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,680
Do you know where he is?

780
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,680
- I ought to have you thrown out.
- I have to find him.

781
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,600
He does this all the time.
Gets in a mood and disappears.

782
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,480
- Where?
- Paradise Cove.

783
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,360
Thatll be home
now the Stavroses are gone.

784
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,840
Im being much too polite to you.
I must be over the guy!

785
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,320
- Ready, Robin?
- Sure.

786
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,040
- Well?
- I would like to thank you.

787
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,600
Youd better not.

788
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,360
- Too late. Got my drink down.
- May I use that man? lll pay.

789
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,520
You want to rent him or buy him?

790
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,720
<i>I want him to sail the West Wind
to Paradise Cove.</i>

791
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,960
I couldnt possibly spare him.

792
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,960
There must be somebody you can spare.

793
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,480
Theres only one man
this business can spare.

794
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,800
- Thats me.
- Im sure of that.

795
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,120
lll take you.

796
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,080
- How much?
- It wont cost you a dime.

797
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,240
- Just what do you expect?
- Dinner, Saturday.

798
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,600
- Thats all?
- I dont have to push.

799
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,360
I know Im irresistible.

800
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:40,400
- When can we start?
- lll get my hat and go with you.

801
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,040
- Ed, stand by to cast off.
- Yes, sir.

802
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,600
Make yourself comfortable.

803
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,440
I heard sailboats needed sails to sail.

804
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,520
They do.

805
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:07,200
- You didnt say it had an auxiliary.
- You didnt ask.

806
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,560
I could have done this myself.
Ive been had.

807
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,280
Not yet.

808
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:16,040
Your eyes are bigger than
your stomach, Mr Johnson.

809
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,040
- Guests dont work, Ross.
- This one does.

810
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:37,880
Better get it finished. Radio says
heavy rains in the next few hours.

811
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,360
They did, huh? We find out.

812
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,400
Kapu! Kapu!

813
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,400
Kapu!

814
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,760
There you are, kitty.

815
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,960
First time I saw that.
He must know hell be fed.

816
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,400
No food. He tells weather.

817
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,000
Its gonna rain. I heard it on the radio.

818
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:02,280
- What they know about weather?
- I suppose Kapu knows!

819
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,280
White spots in eyes, it rain.
No spots, no rain.

820
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,040
No spots, no rain.

821
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:17,800
Youd better stow this gear
if you dont want to get it wet.

822
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,880
Very dangerous animal
when contradicted.

823
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,080
- Terribly sorry!
- lll bet.

824
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,880
Chen!

825
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,240
- Chen!
- Yes, sir!

826
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:51,080
- Do you see anything?
- Yes, sir!

827
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,840
Fish?

828
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,120
No, sir!

829
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,640
Captain! Hey, Captain!
Fish off the starboard bow!

830
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,920
Thank you! Youre very kind.

831
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:25,640
This is WY2768,
calling marine operator. Over.

832
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,440
<i>- This is a marine operator.
- Shh!</i>

833
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:32,520
<i>Come in WY2768, come in.</i>

834
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:37,000
Get me Paradise Cove.
Kin Yung house. Emergency!

835
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,880
Ross, you stop now.
Save strength for party.

836
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,600
- What party?
- Big catch, big party.

837
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:53,720
I do the work.
I dont feel much like a party.

838
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,080
You will, Ross.
Plenty wine, plenty girls.

839
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,280
Not interested. Its hot!

840
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,960
So true. Sun is out.

841
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,360
OK. The cat was right, wasnt it?

842
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,040
Should be. Very hep cat.

843
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,760
- Ross! Ross!

879
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:03,120

01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,760
Youre gonna buy this boat

881
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,240

01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,960
Know something? I should win a medal.

888
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,280

- For being the worlds biggest jackass.

889
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,560
- Well, say something.
- OK. Youre the worlds biggest jackass.

890
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,080
I thought the only thing that could
make me happy was owning the boat.

891
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,240
- But Im over it!
- I love you anyway.

892
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,560
Tell you what.
Well build a new boat, you and I.

893
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,880
Is that a proposal or a proposition?

894
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,240
Either you marry me
or live with me in sin.

895
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,400
Couldnt I have a little bit of both?

896
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,760
Oh, no... Oh, no!

897
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:59,840
- Here we go again!
- Here we go again!
