1
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,806
[speaking in foreign language]

2
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:48,901
- [Voiceover]
Identification is completed.

3
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,680
[people murmuring]

4
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,032
- [Voiceover] Okay,
welcome to CERN.

5
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:51,369
This is in fact the
control room for the

6
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:52,956
Atlas experiment.

7
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:56,615
Atlas is one of the four
large experiments now

8
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,997
going on at the LHC,

9
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,241
the large hadron collider.

10
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:05,417
The large hadron collider is
a huge ring of 27 kilometers,

11
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:08,869
and that's an accelerator
where we accelerate protons

12
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:10,146
in two different directions,

13
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,631
and then they collide
in four points.

14
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,393
We are just above one of
those colliding points at

15
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:17,878
the Atlas experiment.

16
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:19,259
So Atlas is both

17
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:23,987
a large collaboration
of about 3,000 people,

18
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,748
I'm one of them,

19
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,267
my name is Pauline Gagnon,

20
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,751
I'm Canadian.

21
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,787
I work for an
American institute,

22
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,720
Indiana University,

23
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:34,964
and I live here in France,

24
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:36,241
and work in Switzerland,

25
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,830
but that's just about
the kind of sociology

26
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:41,108
that you have with the
people here at CERN.

27
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:43,800
So it's a very mixed background.

28
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:46,251
On Atlas alone we have people

29
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,047
from more than 70
different countries.

30
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,808
There are only 38 countries

31
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,327
participating in the experiment,

32
00:04:53,362 --> 00:04:56,330
but since people like me...

33
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:59,022
I'm Canadian, and I grew up
in American institute so then

34
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:03,579
there are people from different
countries working together.

35
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:06,685
The common language to
work is broken English,

36
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,446
so everybody speaks it

37
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,277
with their own mistakes
and their own accent,

38
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,105
and all that.

39
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,590
So but people get along,

40
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:17,075
and we usually
get the work done.

41
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,009
[people murmuring]

42
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,773
All this, though, you may wonder

43
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:27,223
what's the purpose of all this?

44
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:28,431
Why do we do...

45
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:32,332
Why do we go to such an
extent, so much work?

46
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,851
3,000 people just to
build the detector,

47
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:39,546
and work on it, and analyze
the data that comes out of it.

48
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,928
Essentially, it's just
to increase the knowledge

49
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:45,379
about what matter is made of.

50
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:48,727
What is the universe
where we live?

51
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:50,695
What is this place we are in,

52
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,179
and where did it come from?

53
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:53,283
Where is it going?

54
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:55,078
So it's very
fundamental question.

55
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:58,841
It's nothing that puts food
on your plate right away.

56
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,498
The food might come
later on, you know,

57
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:03,121
because with research
you never know

58
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,123
what will come out of it.

59
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,296
We're going out,

60
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,575
and let's see what we find.

61
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:12,337
It's a bit like mushroom
hunts, you know.

62
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,246
You can bring back something
that is really good,

63
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,236
then you make a good dish,

64
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,445
or you might not come back

65
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,481
with anything suitable.

66
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:21,519
So, I was saying earlier
that we have the accelerator

67
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:23,590
which accelerates the particles,

68
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:25,902
and then we have the
detectors that are there

69
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:28,111
just to detect what comes up.

70
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:31,598
A detector is just
a very fancy camera.

71
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:35,464
So we take a snapshot of
what happens when two protons

72
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,293
come into collisions.

73
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:41,124
All the energy released
in the collision

74
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,817
then is in one small tiny point,

75
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,407
and it allows you to
create a particle,

76
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,961
because E equals MC squared.

77
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:51,721
So the energy that
you have put there,

78
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:54,103
you can transform it into mass.

79
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:56,346
The C squared's just
the exchange rate

80
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,176
between energy and mass.

81
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,936
So we can create new particles,

82
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:02,076
and study how they behave.

83
00:07:04,078 --> 00:07:07,150
[people murmuring]

84
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,946
[alarm sounding]

85
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:17,989
[machine whirring]

86
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:08,660
[people murmuring]

87
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:26,195
[machine whirring]

88

00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:02,024
[people murmuring]

90
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,598
- [Voiceover] I saw in
1995 there was an opening

91
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:16,970
at CERN, and LHC was
due to start very soon,

92
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:18,592
and so this is why I decided

93
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,525
it could be a good opportunity,

94
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,940
and that's why I jumped.

95
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:25,772
I think it's actually
beautiful to be a part

96
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:29,016
of modern cathedrals building.

97
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,535
That's the way I see it.

98
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,194
It's like being a
community with a single aim

99
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:35,609
and a single scope.

100
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:38,163
And we are producing
machines that actually

101
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:41,684
nobody has built before,
like a cathedral.

102
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:45,654
[machines whirring]

103
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm in charge of
the magnets at CERN,

104
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,015
everything that has
to do with magnets

105
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,558
for the machines,

106
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,906
and I arrived at CERN in 1995
after a few years working

107
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,943
for thermonuclear fusion,

108
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:00,841
and I think I was lured
there by the adventure

109
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,015
of the LHC,

110
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,982
so it was at the
beginning of the LHC,

111
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:06,536
and in fact where we
are today is the hole

112
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,815
where we do all the
maintenance, the work,

113
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:12,163
the construction,
the reconstruction
of the LHC magnets.

114
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:14,475
We do mostly dipoles here,

115
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,729
and we work in
quadropoles as well.

116
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:17,651
So these are the main
elements that make up

117
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:20,999
the superconducting
cryostat of the LHC.

118
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:25,659
Well, magnets are the main mass

119
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:27,247
in an accelerator.

120
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:28,869
As you've seen,
accelerators at CERN,

121
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:31,458
magnets guide particles.

122
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:34,357
They drive them around
on a circular path,

123
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:36,636
so that they can go back
to the real accelerating

124
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,465
component, which is a [mumbles].

125
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,674
But they need to do
that thousands of times

126
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:43,021
and tens of thousands
of times a second,

127
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:44,229
like in the LHC.

128
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:45,379
So the main function
of the magnet

129
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:47,129
is to guide the particles back,

130
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,027
so this is what we call dipoles,

131
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:50,477
and they have to focus them onto

132
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:53,204
the closed orbit of the machine,

133
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:54,757
and this is the quadropole.

134
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,034
In addition to that,

135
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,598
the quadropole, they
also squeeze the beam

136
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:58,623
down to the small size,

137
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,280
like smaller than a hair

138
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:01,902
in the experimental region.

139
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:05,354
This is the main
function of the magnets.

140
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:10,670
The video and ideal of
the powers and strength,

141
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:14,846
I think let's start with
the electrical power

142
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,227
that we're using

143
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,746
because we need electrical power

144
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,437
to run the machines.

145
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,647
So CERN is using
roughly 160 megawatts

146
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:27,928
of electrical power to run
all these accelerators,

147
00:11:27,963 --> 00:11:30,172
and that's more or
less the consumption

148
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,932
of a small city like Geneva,

149
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,590
so it requires
indeed a lot of power

150
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:39,388
in spite of the fact that
we're using superconductors.

151
00:11:39,422 --> 00:11:42,909
So the LHC by itself
uses about 60 megawatts,

152
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:46,015
and the whole complex
before the pre-injectors

153
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,742
use also about 60 megawatts
to inject the beam

154
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:49,847
into the LHC.

155
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,573
As to the magnetic field,

156
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:56,543
to give you a feeling for how
strong the magnetic field is,

157
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:58,096
you should imagine
a magnetic field

158
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:01,134
in our magnets of eight tesla,

159
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:02,514
produces forces.

160
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:06,864
And these magnets
are 15 meters long,

161
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:09,521
and the forces that you
produce on the magnet

162
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:13,802
are of the order of 350
tons per half magnet.

163
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:16,528
So 350 tons per meter of magnets

164
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:21,050
for every half of the magnet.

165
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:23,501
So it's a lot of weight
that needs to be taken

166
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,331
by the very strong structures
that we put around them.

167
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,817
This is why the magnets
are all encircled

168
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:31,509
in these very strong
structural steel

169
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,650
that is keeping them together.

170
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:36,376
As to the magnetic field itself,

171
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,344
so the field nominal
is eight tesla.

172
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,977
You can compare that
to the magnetic field

173
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:42,244
of the earth,

174
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,868
which you can barely see
with a magnetic needle,

175
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:48,319
so the earth is
producing here in Geneva

176
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,907
about half a gauss,

177
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:53,048
and if I compare that
to the magnetic field

178
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:54,082
of the LHC,

179
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:56,396
it is eight tesla.

180
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:59,986
That's a factor of 100,000 more.

181
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,366
So we're producing in the LHC

182
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,472
100,000 more magnetic field

183
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:06,302
than we do compared
to the magnetic field

184
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:07,407
of the earth.

185
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,727
[people murmuring]

186
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:14,603
[machine whirring]

187
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:50,742
- [Voiceover] We are at
90 meters underground

188
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,952
between the Jura and
the Lake of Geneva,

189
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:57,611
and this is the cavern
of the ATLAS experiment.

190
00:15:57,646 --> 00:16:01,236
It's the biggest experiment
in high energy physics

191
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,651
we ever built,

192
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,722
so the cavern is huge.

193
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,690
It's 60 meters by
30 meters cavern,

194
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:09,969
and inside there is a detector

195
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,798
at least 7,000 tons.

196
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:15,491
It's the same weight of
the Tour Eiffel in Paris,

197
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:18,287
and the cavern is fully
occupied, in fact,

198
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:19,875
by our detector,

199
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:22,533
and this is one of the detectors

200
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,845
that has measured the expulsion

201
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,538
this year and last year,

202
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:29,574
and now we are in
maintenance mode,

203
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:32,715
so this a period
in which we stop,

204
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,647
we open the detector,

205
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:35,166
and we work on it.

206
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,144
So the aim of all
this is quite varied.

207
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:50,492
So one of the main
aim that this...

208
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,356
The one that you can
find on the press

209
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,807
is the discovery
of the expulsion.

210
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:58,431
That is, apart from
being a particle,

211
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,880
it's a mechanism.

212
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:03,884
It's a field and is the
mechanism that gives the mass

213
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,059
to all the other particles,

214
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:08,268
but this is only one of the aims

215
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:09,511
of this detector.

216
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:11,754
This is a general
particles detector,

217
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,068
and can measure several
aspects of the nature

218
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:17,001
and the several
aspects of the nature

219
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,108
in this very tiny dimensions,

220
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:22,420
and this very back in time.

221
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,804
The accelerator itself
is a time machine,

222
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,807
and going up with
energy allows us to go

223
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:33,500
back in time and to
reach just a tiny amount

224
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:36,676
of time after Big Bang.

225
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:43,821
The description of the
nature as we know today

226
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,962
is at the moment, I would
say, quite complete,

227
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:50,103
especially after the
discovery of the expulsions,

228
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:53,969
but there are many things
we don't understand

229
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:56,903
for which this detector
has been built for,

230
00:17:56,937 --> 00:18:00,976
and this, for example, is
questions about dark matter,

231
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,600
and, well, there is one
very basic question.

232
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:06,947
That is the difference
between the amount of matter

233
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:08,294
and anti-matter,

234
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:14,127
because all this knowledge,
all this building

235
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:16,819
on knowledge and
building of materials

236
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:19,028
tells you that the Big Bang

237
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:22,377
at the certain moment
in time beginning,

238
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,899
and all the matter,
all the matter

239
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,626
that exists in the universe now

240
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:33,146
comes from a very
small point from

241
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:36,115
where everything
expanded in a way,

242
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,119
to give an image.

243
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,225
But to have this...

244
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,194
Find a tiny point with
this anonymous amount

245
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:48,679
of energy and matter density,

246
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:55,720
you must have a way
to put those together,

247
00:18:55,755 --> 00:19:00,346
and the only conceivable
way you can see about this

248
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,245
is a symmetric way of thinking,

249
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,740
in that you must
have the same amount

250
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:07,180
of matter and anti-matter.

251
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:09,734
And then of course,
you can ask yourself

252
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,357
so why there is not

253
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,982
myself in antimatter
that is destroying me.

254
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,399
So in a way there
is a tiny difference

255
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,470
between the matter
and the anti-matter

256
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:23,679
that makes all this exist,

257
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,269
and this is certainly a mystery.

258
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:31,584
There are other mysteries like
the amount of dark matter.

259
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:33,620
We see that if we look...

260
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,280
We can look at this
kind of phenomena

261
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:40,558
also in the space,

262
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,767
and we can look at the
matter in the space,

263
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:45,943
and we cannot really
compute totally the matter

264
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,220
that is in the space.

265
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,395
We can compute it,

266
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,190
but we see that
there is a deficit,

267
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,261
and there is what we
call the dark matter

268
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:54,538
and the dark energy,

269
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:58,058
that they are not
exactly the same thing.

270
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:00,958
To make this size of universe,

271
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:04,651
and this way, the matter
is distributed possible,

272
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:07,067
and this is certainly a mystery.

273
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:09,449
Another mystery I would
like to give you is

274
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:12,832
that I explain to you
that to the energy

275
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:17,837
and the time, they
are correlated,

276
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,909
and the product of the
energy and the time

277
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:23,739
has to give you a constant.

278
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:26,570
Now if you think for
a moment that the time

279
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:28,606
that you aim at is zero,

280
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,575
then to keep this as a constant,

281
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:34,129
the energy has to be infinite.

282
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:38,547
So there is into this
itself a paradox,

283
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:42,344
and there is something that
maybe we cannot approach.

284
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:43,897
We can do our best,

285
00:20:43,932 --> 00:20:48,005
but the time zero is
something that is difficult.

286
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:55,115
[people murmuring]

287
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:23,730
[machine whirring]

288
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:04,969
- [Voiceover] What we do,

289
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:08,559
we do in the research
sounds a bit strange.

290
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:13,771
I mean, we in one
hand, we want to make

291
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:19,225
a confirmation or test
of our present theory,

292
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,438
and at the same time,

293
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:27,578
we are always
looking for something

294
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:31,133
which I asks destroying
our present theory

295
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:39,245
to go to something,
to find something new.

296
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:55,503
Yeah, you direct to
have the explanation

297
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:59,990
of this Higgs particle.

298
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:00,749
[laughing]

299
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:01,992
Yeah, this is...

300
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:05,133
Yes, I mean, the Higgs
mechanism, I have...

301
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:09,758
This is one of my...

302
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:19,388
I have been wondering how
one can explain correctly

303
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,910
and easily the
role of Higgs field

304
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,398
and Higgs mechanism
and the Higgs particle.

305
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:30,479
[laughing] And this is something

306
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:33,161
which is difficult for me to do.

307
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:36,405
Yeah, how to explain is...

308
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:51,455
Higgs also does such a special,

309
00:24:52,318 --> 00:24:54,631
very unique, important role,

310
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:59,083
even, I mean,
allowing us to exist.

311
00:25:01,948 --> 00:25:04,364
This such a important particle

312
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,401
has never been discovered until

313
00:25:06,435 --> 00:25:08,437
just until one year ago.

314
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:12,614
So this is a kind
of very, I mean,

315
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:14,754
frustrating situation.

316
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:17,377
We know that theory
works very well.

317
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:21,174
However, one of the key
element of the theory

318
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,077
wasn't confirmed by experiment.

319
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:30,045
Nobody have seen
this exist or not,

320
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:34,740
and now, we have very likely

321
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:38,916
be discovered.

322
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,816
This has very likely
be discovered,

323
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,474
so in a sense, this
has the last piece

324
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:47,407
of our theory has been,

325
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:52,723
I mean, found and put
into the jigsaw puzzle,

326
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,623
but this is...

327
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:59,661
If it is jigsaw puzzle,

328
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:01,249
then it is a completion,

329
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:03,009
and you may just, I mean,

330
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:05,046
the glue and put on the wall,

331
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,325
or you may want to
disassemble instead,

332
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,846
but in physics, this
doesn't go like this.

333
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:17,265
Up to the analogy of last
piece of jigsaw puzzle

334
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:18,197
works fine,

335
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:20,337
but as soon as after that,

336
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,444
the analogy doesn't
uphold anymore.

337
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:26,619
So what we want to do is...

338
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:35,386
First of all, we have to
confirm, still confirm,

339
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:37,699
if this particle is
really the last piece

340
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:41,910
of this jigsaw puzzle, not
something similar, but...

341
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,949
Which may be totally different.

342
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:50,643
[people murmuring]

343
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,141
- [Voiceover] We have a picture,

344
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:17,592
which is a coarse
model [mumbles]

345
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:19,283
history of our universe.

346
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:21,700
Nobody tells us
that is the truth,

347
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,632
but within our
present knowledge,

348
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,876
this is the best we can do,

349
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:29,362
and indeed, it does
explain very nicely

350
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:31,744
all what we are able to observe.

351
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,505
Maybe we come up
with new observation.

352
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,889
Remember, there is
fundamentally in the universe

353
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:41,167
what we are studying at LHC

354
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,756
I taught is matter.

355
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:47,760
So matter constitute only
while the visible matter

356
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:51,177
constitute only 4%
of the universe.

357
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:53,110
All the rest is unknown,

358
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:54,802
being dark matter,

359
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:57,045
which is something
we know it exists,

360
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,392
but we have no
clue on what it is,

361
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:03,672
and even something even more
mysterious is dark energy.

362
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:06,952
So, which is something we gain

363
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:08,850
with respect it exists

364
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:11,508
because we need it to explain

365
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,718
given properties of the
evolution of the universe,

366
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,066
but again, we have no
clue what it exists.

367
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:21,000
So in other word, today,
we are in a situation.

368
00:29:21,035 --> 00:29:24,866
We have a pool of
knowledge of 4% percent

369
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,007
of the universe,

370
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:31,770
and we ignore totally what
the rest of the universe is.

371
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:42,573
So the specific
place where we are.

372
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:44,817
Now this is ATLAS experiment.

373
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:48,856
We are looking for
recreating primordial matter.

374
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,100
This is the matter as it existed

375
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:54,827
shortly after the Big Bang,

376
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:57,278
and here we are talking
about a fraction

377
00:29:57,312 --> 00:30:01,489
of microseconds after the
beginning of the universe.

378
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:06,287
At that time, temperature
were extremely high.

379
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:08,841
Energy density was very high,

380
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:11,257
and matter was in a
completely different shape

381
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,121
as it is today.

382
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:16,849
So we recreate this new, this
primordial state of matter,

383
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:19,748
and try to understand
what they are,

384
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:22,890
the nature and the properties
of this primordial matter,

385
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:26,134
and then how it
evolves from its state

386
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,964
in the early universe

387
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:30,794
to the state as
we know it today.

388
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,557
Just imagine in a single
collision of two lead nuclei,

389
00:30:35,592 --> 00:30:38,388
we are producing about
10,000 of particles

390
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,425
which are going
through our equipment,

391
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,875
and all this particles,

392
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,153
we have to look at it to see it

393
00:30:45,188 --> 00:30:46,465
and to identify it,

394
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:48,743
so of course, we
don't take a picture

395
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,434
of the particle itself.

396
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:52,920
We take a picture of the track

397
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:55,750
a particle leaves when it goes

398
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,269
through our equipment,

399
00:30:57,303 --> 00:31:00,134
so it's more or less the same

400
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:02,964
as if you would
go on a ski slope.

401
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,002
You don't see the skier.

402
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:08,418
You just see the
traces of the skier,

403
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,489
and out of the traces, you say,

404
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:12,008
"Okay, here was a skier.

405
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:14,113
"He went from there to there."

406
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:16,426
Looking at the
depths of the trace,

407
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,567
I can have an idea on
the weight of the skier,

408
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,603
and we are doing
the same exercise.

409
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:23,157
We never see the skier.

410
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:24,710
We just see the traces,

411
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:27,437
and of course, to have
a full trace of a skier,

412
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:29,197
you need a big field.

413
00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:33,098
We are really using brute force.

414
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:34,789
We are not very smart,

415
00:31:34,823 --> 00:31:38,137
so we use the energy
we are able to make

416
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:43,625
to create in a
collision to create

417
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,248
this new particles.

418
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:47,767
Now of course, this is
for the creation part,

419
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:50,909
so you need to bring
a small particle

420
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,703
to very high speed.

421
00:31:52,738 --> 00:31:55,016
When I talking about high speed,

422
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:56,604
it's something
which is very close

423
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:57,950
to the speed of light.

424
00:31:57,985 --> 00:32:00,608
So for that, you just
need a big machinery.

425
00:32:00,642 --> 00:32:02,886
The machinery being,
well, you need magnet

426
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,819
to make a particle turn,

427
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:07,684
and you need electric
field to accelerate it,

428
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,790
and then, one million
of different elements

429
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,655
just to make the
whole thing work.

430
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:18,798
I think CERN is for me
really the best example

431
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,904
in the world for humanity

432
00:32:23,251 --> 00:32:26,323
following a common objective,

433
00:32:26,358 --> 00:32:30,017
and this is, if we don't
discover anything in science,

434
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,846
I think having achieved that

435
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,779
is a major achievement.

436
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:40,406
[speaking in a foreign language]

437
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:41,625
- [Voiceover] We
are speaking about

438
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:45,515
[speaking in a foreign
language], or no?

439
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:48,518
- [Voiceover] I don't know.

440
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:49,346
- [Voiceover] No,
basically, this I think

441
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:50,865
we have to understand...

442
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:52,979
- [Voiceover] I think we
have to really understand...

443
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,249
- [Voiceover] [speaking
in a foreign language]

444
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:58,079
And bring this to the
technical [mumbles].

445
00:32:58,114 --> 00:32:59,874
- [Voiceover] I think
a list chaperone also

446
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:01,289
has to be important.

447
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:03,222
- [Voiceover] That's
the suspicion right now

448
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:07,123
is that someone hit
the crash button.

449
00:33:07,157 --> 00:33:08,400
So that's the question.

450
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:10,989
So why did it turn off
in the first place?

451
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,681
- [Voiceover] [mumbling]

452
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:14,969
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
it received emergency.

453
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,029
So it's as if someone
hit the crash button.

454
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:19,998
- [Voiceover] I mean, the
meaning of the measures

455
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,689
is not that I don't know.

456
00:33:21,723 --> 00:33:24,657
[people murmuring]

457
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:29,938
- [Voiceover] So
the law is as if...

458
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:33,183
It's as if someone
hit the crash button.

459
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:34,460
We don't think someone did,

460
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,187
but it's as if someone
hit the crash button.

461
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:38,775
[people murmuring]

462
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,673
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
the question is about

463
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,813
the first thing that he find,

464
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:44,436
that he looked at the reprocess

465
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,885
versus prom data,

466
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,922
and he just had to
stay with the prompt,

467
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:50,890
but in the reprocess data
there are largest changes

468
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:52,237
for jets,

469
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:56,275
so I find the statement
a little bit surprising.

470
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:02,316
- [Voiceover] So the question is

471
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,387
is there a quantitative measure

472
00:34:04,421 --> 00:34:07,286
of this [mumbles]
differences which you see?

473
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:09,150
Do you have some plots also

474
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:10,669
that show that?

475
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:11,532
If it's in the backup,

476
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:12,740
we can look at it later,

477
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:14,707
but I don't want
to kill the stream.

478
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:15,926
- [Voiceover] I'm not quite sure

479
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,169
if I put it in
the backup or not.

480
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:18,446
- [Voiceover] Just
more of an assent,

481
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,644
I think that's what I'll
learn from the question.

482
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,612
Okay, we can take it offline,

483
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,924
and we can go on from here.

484
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:33,554
You look frozen.

485
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:36,074
Are you still, you know, alive?

486
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:43,150
Think the shock was too
much on this question.

487
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:44,151
[mumbling]

488
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:45,117
[people laughing]

489
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:45,980
[people murmuring]

490
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:47,050
He's gone.

491
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,672
Okay, he became invisible.

492
00:34:48,707 --> 00:34:50,502
[people murmuring]

493
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:52,711
So no more questions
'till the end, please.

494
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,989
[laughing]

495
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:59,925
- [Voiceover] Can
anybody outside CERN

496
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:01,133
still hear us?

497
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:02,548
[mumbling]

498
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,791
Oh good, good.

499
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:05,275
- [Voiceover] I can hear you.

500
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,107
- [Voiceover] So I can go
and sit down and just wait.

501
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,326
- [Voiceover] At the beginning,

502
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,527
I was heavily involved
in building a system

503
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:17,287
that we call the trigger system,

504
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:21,809
and this trigger system
actually selects online

505
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:24,605
in real time only the
interesting collisions

506
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,710
that will be recorded

507
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:29,196
and that will be analyzed later.

508
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,750
Now, this involves
the development

509
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:35,961
of an electronic system which
operates very, very fast.

510
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:42,347
It looks at the collision
40 million times per second.

511
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:44,901
It is sort of a digital camera

512
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:49,561
which takes 40 million
pictures per second.

513
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:50,769
It analyzes.

514
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:52,702
It doesn't only
take this pictures,

515
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,186
but it looks at these pictures,

516
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:56,095
and looks if there are
some interesting patterns,

517
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,227
for example, and if there
are interesting patterns,

518
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:04,300
which is the case only
maybe a few hundred

519
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:05,508
times per second,

520
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:09,236
then this trigger
system recognizes these

521
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,343
and marks these
photographs, if you like,

522
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:15,000
really for recording.

523
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,346
So we don't have...

524
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:19,832
Like, when you take photographs
with a digital camera,

525
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:21,800
you take many snapshots,

526
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,285
but you eliminate those
that you do not like,

527
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,392
but we do this online
extremely fast.

528
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:38,679
Our first important
discovery was a particle

529
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:42,683
that looks very much like
the so-called Higgs particle,

530
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:45,479
which is also called God
particles, God particle,

531
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:48,240
but this is a term that
physicists don't really like.

532
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:52,417
So anyway, we have discovered
a very new particle,

533
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:54,729
and now we are going to
measure all its properties

534
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:56,973
and to make sure it is really

535
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,941
the long sought Higgs particles,

536
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:02,772
or if it is indeed
something completely new,

537
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:05,326
but actually, this
experiment was built

538
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:07,432
for another main purpose,

539
00:37:07,466 --> 00:37:09,951
and this main purpose
was really to discover

540
00:37:09,986 --> 00:37:14,093
if there are, for example,
new forces in physics.

541
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:16,544
You all know, we all know
gravity, for example,

542
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:18,719
but there are also other forces,

543
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:21,722
for example, electromagnetic
forces in the universe,

544
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:24,552
but maybe there are
even other forces

545
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:26,036
we do not know about,

546
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:30,627
and this could be discovered
at this experiment here.

547
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:32,974
We could also, for
example, discover

548
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:36,323
completely new
spatial dimensions,

549
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:37,876
which may be very small

550
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,637
so that up to now, we have
not been able to see them,

551
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:43,502
but with a tool like the
large hadron collider

552
00:37:43,537 --> 00:37:45,159
and this experiment,

553
00:37:45,193 --> 00:37:49,336
we can use this really just
like a giant microscope.

554
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,374
So we can really look
deep into nature,

555
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:56,653
and we hope to find
something very new.

556
00:37:58,034 --> 00:38:00,761
For example, it is
imaginable that gravity

557
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:03,142
becomes a very,
very strong force,

558
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:05,144
much stronger than
we are used to it,

559
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:08,078
when we go to very
small distances.

560
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:10,460
For example, when
you smash two protons

561
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:14,326
against each other as
it is done in the LHC,

562
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:17,847
then you really come to
very, very small distances,

563
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,538
and it is possible
that gravity becomes

564
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:20,643
very strong.

565
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:22,886
So if gravity becomes strong,

566
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:26,856
then we could also
create mini-black holes,

567
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,168
microscopic black holes.

568
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:32,517
So this would be a
spectacular new signature

569
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:35,071
for up to now unknown physics.

570
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:39,765
It's a constant struggle,

571
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,043
and of course, the kids
sometimes complain,

572
00:38:42,078 --> 00:38:43,631
"Mommy, there's nothing to eat.

573
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:44,770
"What shall we eat?"

574
00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:45,702
[laughs]

575
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,222
But, well, I'm not alone,

576
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:51,570
and one has to get
all the help one can.

577
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:56,575
But I think, even if
the family suffers,

578
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:01,511
I think in the end they see
how enthusiastic we are,

579
00:39:01,546 --> 00:39:05,066
and they see that we really
have achieved something,

580
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:07,448
something that is
really satisfying,

581
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:08,794
that can show new ways,

582
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:12,246
and I think normally
families understand,

583
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:14,973
but I should also say,

584
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:16,388
mind you, there have also been

585
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:18,942
lots of divorces at CERN here,

586
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:23,153
mainly because of
just too much work.

587
00:39:23,188 --> 00:39:25,224
But people are
enthusiastic, you know.

588
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:29,056
I mean, these are not
people that come at nine

589
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,057
and they leave at five,

590
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:31,541
and they look at their watch.

591
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:34,199
You know, they really like
to spend the time here,

592
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:37,029
and they put in all
the means they have

593
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:39,377
to bring out results,

594
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:42,552
and also to get
personal satisfaction.

595
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:48,972
- [Voiceover] This
center is at CERN,

596
00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:52,907
and has essentially two main,
very important connections.

597
00:39:52,942 --> 00:39:57,256
One connection is brings
us to the experiments.

598
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,742
So essentially this is
the main flux of data

599
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:01,847
is from the experiments to here.

600
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:05,230
So, when there is a
beams are colliding,

601
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:08,026
the events, so the collisions,

602
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,097
the result of the
collisions are recorded,

603
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:13,134
filtered across different
levels of filtering,

604
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:15,723
and eventually, they
are shipped to here

605
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:18,174
via a dedicated network.

606
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,245
So this is the first connection.

607
00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:23,317
The data routing
here then are stored

608
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:24,767
on disc immediately,

609
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:27,770
and they are ready to
be immediately analyzed.

610
00:40:27,804 --> 00:40:29,668
This is just the first
part of the analysis.

611
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:32,499
Actually, we call it
general reconstruction,

612
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:34,121
and the idea here is that

613
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:36,019
out of the raw data...

614
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:37,849
This is also the technical term,

615
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:39,747
the raw data which
we are receiving

616
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:41,128
from the experiments,

617
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:44,062
we reconstruct
trajectories, for example,

618
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:48,653
from which you can
identify particles

619
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:50,931
and give to them...

620
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:54,866
Let's see, assign them
energies and directions.

621
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,357
These data are also
shipped outside,

622
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:06,049
and they are shipped
initially, I mean,

623
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:07,257
directly from CERN

624
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:09,812
to a site of important
computer centers

625
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:12,055
more or less
compatible to this one,

626
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,679
which are then, in turn,

627
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:16,128
redistributing the data

628
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:19,062
to other places where
in a typical university

629
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,202
or university type
of facilities,

630
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:24,585
where the final
analysis, for example,

631
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,000
will be done,

632
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:27,633
or other activities
connected with that analysis

633
00:41:27,657 --> 00:41:28,865
of the data.

634
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,868
So, I think one can
visualize data coming

635
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:34,112
from the experiments
being stored,

636
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:37,460
being given to this
initial reconstruction,

637
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,255
and also being distributed.

638
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,428
So this is a, let's say,

639
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:42,845
the backbone of our activity.

640
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,817
I was born in 1964, and I think,

641
00:41:49,852 --> 00:41:53,096
talking with the LSA people
of my age, et cetera,

642
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:55,029
I came to the conclusion

643
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:57,894
that, you know,
the Apollo period,

644
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:02,416
end of the '60s,
beginning of the '70s,

645
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,866
had really an influence on us.

646
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,454
Initially, I was very
passionate about astronomy

647
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:09,112
and astronauts, this kind of...

648
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:11,770
Which eventually, becoming
and growing older,

649
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:14,290
became an interest in physics,

650
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,223
and so, then I decided for...

651
00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:18,708
But I think there
is a very specific,

652
00:42:18,743 --> 00:42:20,952
you know, interest,
correlation with astronomy

653
00:42:20,986 --> 00:42:23,230
and with that particular period

654
00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:24,990
of space exploration.

655
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:33,067
You know, one side,
astronomy's this gigantic

656
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:37,278
distances, worlds you
cannot really visit directly

657
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:40,109
because of distances,

658
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:42,352
and once you go for
particle physics,

659
00:42:42,387 --> 00:42:44,665
is a kind of mirror
image of this.

660
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,125
You go in the smaller
and the smaller

661
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:47,047
and the smaller,

662
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:48,393
so you find there are worlds

663
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:52,880
which are really fascinating,
strange sometimes,

664
00:42:52,915 --> 00:42:55,193
bizarre, but it's clearly...

665
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:58,472
This is one of the things

666
00:42:58,506 --> 00:43:02,165
which clearly moves me, or
moved me, to go in physics.

667
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,720
And now, even if
I'm in computing,

668
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:07,619
more on this side, clearly
there is the proudness

669
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:09,587
to say, well, you know,

670
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:13,798
these experiments are
doing really something

671
00:43:13,832 --> 00:43:16,179
really interesting, really cool,

672
00:43:16,214 --> 00:43:20,425
and we are giving our
small contribution to this.

673
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:23,635
So, it's, I think for somebody

674
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,637
which with the
physics background,

675
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:28,467
CERN, even if then you move,

676
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:29,503
keeps this fascination.

677
00:43:29,537 --> 00:43:31,229
I mean, it's our home.

678
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:33,024
It's our dream place.

679
00:43:34,266 --> 00:43:35,266
So it's...

680
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,374
I think this is this.

681
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:44,656
[machine whirring]

682
00:45:42,705 --> 00:45:45,950
[electricity whirring]

683
00:45:56,132 --> 00:45:58,065
- [Voiceover] We have
our own fire brigade.

684
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,619
We have our own
emergency services.

685
00:46:00,654 --> 00:46:03,036
Actually, we are like a city,

686
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:06,487
and this is a
challenge for my job,

687
00:46:06,522 --> 00:46:08,662
because you asked
me in the beginning

688
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:10,319
where we are here.

689
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:12,942
We have to manage a small city,

690
00:46:14,081 --> 00:46:15,703
and just to give you some ideas

691
00:46:15,738 --> 00:46:18,016
about what I mean by city,

692
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:21,295
we have roughly 10,800
guest scientists

693
00:46:22,158 --> 00:46:24,057
coming from all over the world,

694
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:25,610
120 nationalities.

695
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:29,510
We have roughly 2,500 staff.

696
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:32,168
We have 500 postdocs,

697
00:46:32,203 --> 00:46:34,619
500 students and apprentices.

698
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:39,382
So it's a population
which needs accommodation

699
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:42,765
and services as any
customer or client

700
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,044
would have needed it
in the small city.

701
00:46:52,948 --> 00:46:54,673
Actually, in some sense,

702
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:57,538
we are at the same
time an organization

703
00:46:57,573 --> 00:46:59,126
like any other organization,

704
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:02,267
but we also providing
our own legislation,

705
00:47:02,302 --> 00:47:05,857
if you like, because the
convention gives us the right

706
00:47:05,892 --> 00:47:09,930
but also the obligation to
handle certain things ourselves.

707
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:12,657
For example, if we
fix our salaries,

708
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:14,590
we cannot do it just like that.

709
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,558
We have to do it
according to the rules

710
00:47:17,593 --> 00:47:21,217
which were approved by
our 20 member states.

711
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:24,669
So, in some sense, we
are kind of a state

712
00:47:25,773 --> 00:47:26,913
in the states.

713
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:31,055
What you need is a long breath,

714
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:33,402
and this is sometimes a problem

715
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:36,370
if you discuss things
with politicians.

716
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:39,304
They're used to
work with horizons

717
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:41,789
of three to five years,

718
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:44,551
and they respect
return on investment,

719
00:47:44,585 --> 00:47:47,105
which is all more
or less immediate.

720
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,107
Immediate means tomorrow,

721
00:47:49,142 --> 00:47:50,384
but we have seen,

722
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:52,421
if I take the example
of the world wide web,

723
00:47:52,455 --> 00:47:54,802
which was invented here at CERN,

724
00:47:54,837 --> 00:47:58,910
you need sometimes I
would say, on an average,

725
00:47:58,945 --> 00:48:01,809
at least 10 years,
10 to 15 years,

726
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:04,260
between the first basic ideas

727
00:48:06,953 --> 00:48:09,714
and the first
industrial product.

728
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:13,821
[machines whirring]

729
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:45,267
[people murmuring]

730
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,912
- [Voiceover] So I'm a
theoretical physicist,

731
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,845
so my job, you
know, is to come up

732
00:49:11,879 --> 00:49:14,744
with some ideas, some
possible explanation,

733
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:17,955
and then I'm trying
to understand

734
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,164
what are the consequences
of these ideas

735
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:21,993
and how you can test those ideas

736
00:49:22,028 --> 00:49:24,099
using experimental result,

737
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:27,136
but [mumbling] result
that obtain now

738
00:49:27,171 --> 00:49:29,690
in this LHC is big machine

739
00:49:29,725 --> 00:49:32,590
that have been
built here at CERN,

740
00:49:32,624 --> 00:49:36,111
and is working pretty
well, at the moment.

741
00:49:43,325 --> 00:49:45,913
I mean, some good ideas can
come up at every moment,

742
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:47,985
and you have to be ready.

743
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:53,714
And it can be dangerous,

744
00:49:55,095 --> 00:49:57,339
in particular, when you are
driving your car, right?

745
00:49:57,373 --> 00:50:00,652
You should try to
keep your ideas alert

746
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:03,103
and be prepared when you
are getting back home

747
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:05,243
to take a little piece of paper,

748
00:50:05,278 --> 00:50:06,624
writing down your ideas,

749
00:50:06,658 --> 00:50:09,558
and try to finish
your computation.

750
00:50:12,837 --> 00:50:14,125
Most of the time,
you are stupid.

751
00:50:14,149 --> 00:50:16,323
You are making
errors, et cetera,

752
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:19,775
but from time to
time, you are right,

753
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:22,502
and you understand
exactly something new.

754
00:50:22,536 --> 00:50:25,470
That's fantastic, of
course, these days.

755
00:50:25,505 --> 00:50:27,955
When you are coming back
home in the evening,

756
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,647
you are feeling very good

757
00:50:29,681 --> 00:50:33,513
because you're more
manageable in the evenings

758
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:36,723
and in the morning,

759
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:38,621
and the feeling
that you understand

760
00:50:38,656 --> 00:50:41,314
that something that
nobody in the world

761
00:50:41,348 --> 00:50:43,454
had thought about before,

762
00:50:44,938 --> 00:50:49,080
but that's really what is
exciting about research.

763
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:50,978
For a few hours,
for a few moments,

764
00:50:51,013 --> 00:50:54,465
you'll be, you know, the
only people on the earth

765
00:50:54,499 --> 00:50:58,676
to really have clear
understanding of the problem.

766
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:02,818
Discovering the
expulsion is not like

767
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,854
discovering yet
another particle.

768
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:06,856
What we are really
after is really trying

769
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:09,790
to understand some
fundamental laws

770
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,416
from fundamental principle
that govern the universe.

771
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,211
So for a very long
time, you know,

772
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:19,076
one main team of
particle physics,

773
00:51:20,836 --> 00:51:23,632
and theoretical physics,
high energy physics,

774
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,151
was Gauge principle.

775
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:27,118
So the Gauge principle
is really the theory

776
00:51:27,153 --> 00:51:29,741
that explain how particle
interact with each other,

777
00:51:29,776 --> 00:51:31,916
basic exchange of
the Gauge possum,

778
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,298
and maybe with the
discovery of the X possum,

779
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:38,025
we are about to discover
a new, fundamental

780
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:42,478
principle of nature
that could really govern

781
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:45,274
how the universe is structured.

782
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:47,690
But, again, I mean, we
are not so much interested

783
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:48,933
in new particle.

784
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:51,142
What we really want
to understand is

785
00:51:51,177 --> 00:51:54,318
what is a principle
behind this new particles?

786
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:56,734
Is this discovery
of the new particle

787
00:51:56,768 --> 00:51:58,908
is telling me something
more fundamental

788
00:51:58,943 --> 00:52:01,773
about nature, more
fundamental physics

789
00:52:01,808 --> 00:52:04,845
would be is there a new
space time dimension?

790
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,262
Is there a new interactions,

791
00:52:07,296 --> 00:52:11,128
new fundamental interaction
between those particles?

792
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:14,234
That's really what we are about.

793
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:15,718
I mean, the fact that, you know,

794
00:52:15,753 --> 00:52:19,066
up to now, we understand
interaction as the exchange

795
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:20,447
of Gauge possum.

796
00:52:20,482 --> 00:52:23,105
It was really big step forward

797
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,935
in the understanding of nature,

798
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,869
but still there is few
things that we don't

799
00:52:28,904 --> 00:52:30,733
quite understand.

800
00:52:30,768 --> 00:52:33,460
I mean, for instance, the
fact that electromagnetism

801
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:36,463
is described by one
particular symmetry of nature.

802
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:37,706
There was a weak interaction

803
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,191
which is described
by another symmetry.

804
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:41,306
There is a strong interaction,

805
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,401
yet another symmetry.

806
00:52:43,436 --> 00:52:45,679
Why those particles
are symmetry?

807
00:52:45,714 --> 00:52:47,578
Is there something deeper

808
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:49,269
behind those symmetries?

809
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:50,891
A bigger symmetry, for instance,

810
00:52:50,926 --> 00:52:53,204
that will unify all
those symmetries

811
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:57,208
associated to the
different interactions?

812
00:52:57,243 --> 00:52:58,254
Yeah, we're trying to understand

813
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,969
this kind of things.

814
00:53:00,936 --> 00:53:02,179
We have good ideas,

815
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:03,835
but we still don't
know if our ideas

816
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,182
are true or not.

817
00:53:07,632 --> 00:53:10,532
[machine whirring]

818
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:11,731
[people murmuring]

819
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:39,448
[people murmuring]

820
00:54:57,604 --> 00:54:59,951
- [Voiceover] I mean,
I'm not a physicist,

821
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:02,575
and I used to
explain that I'm here

822
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:06,130
to develop the toys
for physicists,

823
00:55:06,164 --> 00:55:09,167
so I'm involved in
the machine side.

824
00:55:10,514 --> 00:55:13,344
So there is several
people at CERN

825
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:18,315
deciding what has to be done

826
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,661
for the physics,

827
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:23,181
and then we are in charge

828
00:55:23,216 --> 00:55:25,391
to develop the tools

829
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:29,602
in order to allow these
people to make the research.

830
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,198
There is not really
hierarchy at CERN,

831
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:42,615
or at least, this is my feeling.

832
00:55:42,649 --> 00:55:45,721
There is people from
the physics side

833
00:55:47,896 --> 00:55:50,692
deciding more or less
what has to be done,

834
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:52,970
and we are here to provide them

835
00:55:53,004 --> 00:55:56,663
the required tools to
be able to investigate

836
00:55:58,424 --> 00:56:00,391
what they are looking for.

837
00:56:00,426 --> 00:56:02,289
So there is no real hierarchy.

838
00:56:02,324 --> 00:56:03,808
There is several...

839
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:08,399
There is different
specialties at CERN,

840
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,575
and in the technical parts.

841
00:56:11,609 --> 00:56:14,612
So our section is called MDT,

842
00:56:14,647 --> 00:56:16,442
and my actual section leader

843
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:19,962
used to translate that
by "Making Dreams True."

844
00:56:19,997 --> 00:56:24,208
So there is people asking
for some dedicated tools,

845
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:29,316
and we are here to try
to develop these tools.

846
00:56:32,941 --> 00:56:35,978
So we are presently working
on the new generation

847
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:38,912
of superconducting magnets

848
00:56:38,947 --> 00:56:42,951
using new technology [mumbling]

849
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:46,264
superconducting cables

850
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:48,370
in order to reach higher field

851
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,924
that will be required
for the upgrade

852
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:53,030
of the luminosity of LHC.

853
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,379
So the magnets presently
installed in LHC

854
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,899
are based on [mumbles]
titanium technology

855
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:01,728
and we reach the limit

856
00:57:01,763 --> 00:57:05,422
of the magnetic field
that can be reached

857
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:08,425
with such a kind
of superconductors.

858
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:13,464
We are trying to
develop a new [mumbles]

859
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:15,811
dipole, 100 millimeters bore

860
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:18,089
with 13 tesla,

861
00:57:18,987 --> 00:57:21,334
and to give you a rough idea

862
00:57:22,197 --> 00:57:24,371
about what this represent,

863
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,583
the required [mumbles] cable

864
00:57:28,617 --> 00:57:31,689
to produce one coil
is around 100,000

865
00:57:33,035 --> 00:57:34,865
Swiss francs per coil,

866
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:38,627
and we need four coils in size.

867
00:57:38,662 --> 00:57:41,216
And we just need a few seconds

868
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,011
to destroy the cables,

869
00:57:43,045 --> 00:57:46,393
so this is quite
difficult to deal with.

870
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:53,021
[machines whirring]

871
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,306
[people murmuring]

872
00:58:45,763 --> 00:58:48,766
[machines whirring]

873
00:58:54,082 --> 00:58:57,016
[people murmuring]

874
01:01:44,908 --> 01:01:46,713
- [Voiceover] We are working
in superconductivity,

875
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:49,429
so the magnets we have to test.

876
01:01:49,464 --> 01:01:51,431
So they have to be cooled down

877
01:01:51,466 --> 01:01:53,606
to a very low temperature,

878
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,678
in this case to 4.2 Kelvin,

879
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,162
or even to lower temperature

880
01:01:58,197 --> 01:02:00,371
which is 1.9 Kelvin.

881
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:04,203
To do that, you need
a kind of a thermos,

882
01:02:04,237 --> 01:02:05,445
what you need,

883
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,069
and a vessel that
is a well-insulated

884
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:10,657
from the outside
which is very warm

885
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:12,418
with respect to the magnet.

886
01:02:12,452 --> 01:02:14,972
Basically, you have a
300 Kelvin difference,

887
01:02:15,007 --> 01:02:17,009
which would be the same if I say

888
01:02:17,043 --> 01:02:20,771
to 300 degree because
it's a relative number.

889
01:02:20,806 --> 01:02:23,532
So then you have
to make possible

890
01:02:23,567 --> 01:02:26,950
that the heat in leak
is really minimum.

891
01:02:26,984 --> 01:02:29,780
So we build equipments
which are essentially made

892
01:02:29,815 --> 01:02:33,646
by a vessel itself in which
we can put the magnet,

893
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,579
then we can, obviously,

894
01:02:35,613 --> 01:02:39,376
we close it, and we can
access it by a liquid

895
01:02:40,515 --> 01:02:42,793
which is in this
case liquid helium,

896
01:02:42,828 --> 01:02:45,209
and to cool down to 4.2 K.

897
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:47,591
And then to this equipment,

898
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:50,214
we have to connect the powering

899
01:02:51,422 --> 01:02:54,322
because obviously
the power generation

900
01:02:54,356 --> 01:02:57,221
is on surface and in a nominal

901
01:02:57,256 --> 01:03:01,087
20 degrees celsius
temperature is in the hole.

902
01:03:01,122 --> 01:03:05,022
So you have to bring the
current into the magnet

903
01:03:05,057 --> 01:03:06,092
through this vessel.

904
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:09,509
So this vessel is also helps us

905
01:03:09,544 --> 01:03:12,167
to make the interface
between the magnet

906
01:03:12,202 --> 01:03:13,928
and the outside,

907
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:17,069
and then, obviously, we
have all the information

908
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:19,450
coming out which are
in form of wires,

909
01:03:19,485 --> 01:03:22,246
and we are plugging
it into cards

910
01:03:23,523 --> 01:03:24,766
for data acquisition,

911
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,355
and then we have behind
a controlled room

912
01:03:27,389 --> 01:03:29,978
where on front of us
who are computers,

913
01:03:30,013 --> 01:03:31,980
we get the information visible

914
01:03:32,015 --> 01:03:34,120
and in the graphical
way, such a way

915
01:03:34,155 --> 01:03:36,674
that we can analyze
them later on.

916
01:03:36,709 --> 01:03:39,401
So that is essentially
what we are have behind,

917
01:03:39,436 --> 01:03:42,646
and basically you
have here behind me

918
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,475
three test station of this type.

919
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:48,169
So three units which
are nearly independent,

920
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:50,827
one from the others.

921
01:03:58,938 --> 01:04:01,182
Well, my family's
completely here

922
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:04,875
because I have to say, my
husband is working at CERN.

923
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,188
My husband is working
in the same area

924
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:08,189
that I'm doing,

925
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:09,846
so he's doing also magnets,

926
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,158
and, okay, life is like this.

927
01:04:12,193 --> 01:04:14,851
We have a three years old child,

928
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:19,027
and she's going to the
school, kindergarten at CERN.

929
01:04:20,477 --> 01:04:22,582
So in the morning we are
coming in family at CERN,

930
01:04:22,617 --> 01:04:26,069
and we are dispatched
all over the three sides.

931
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:28,416
My husband is working
in the [mumbles] side,

932
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,314
which is in the French area.

933
01:04:30,349 --> 01:04:33,076
I am working between
the Swiss part

934
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:36,389
and the French parts,
still in French territory,

935
01:04:36,424 --> 01:04:38,736
and my daughter is
on the Swiss side

936
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:42,016
in a kindergarten [laughs].

937
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:45,226
Yeah, my husband has
also another son,

938
01:04:46,952 --> 01:04:47,849
by the way.

939
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,816
He's in the control room.

940
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:51,749
I have his family also.

941
01:04:53,165 --> 01:04:57,100
I have my brother-in-law
working in Atlas detector.

942
01:04:59,723 --> 01:05:04,348
So in the end, we are
all a family. [laughing]

943
01:05:04,383 --> 01:05:06,109
We're all here, yeah.

944
01:05:09,112 --> 01:05:13,012
Well, when you are saying
that we have to leave

945
01:05:14,738 --> 01:05:16,809
maybe some space
for imagination,

946
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:19,053
you are assuming that
what we are doing

947
01:05:19,087 --> 01:05:20,951
is enough to
understand the world,

948
01:05:20,986 --> 01:05:22,056
how the universe works.

949
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,574
I'm not so sure.

950
01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:26,646
I think that we
are in a territory

951
01:05:26,681 --> 01:05:28,925
where we are so difficult,

952
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:33,101
somehow so close to understand
what is the complete stuff

953
01:05:35,655 --> 01:05:39,073
that it becomes very,
very hard to improve,

954
01:05:39,107 --> 01:05:40,971
and I am not at all convinced

955
01:05:41,006 --> 01:05:44,009
that this steps
which are big itself

956
01:05:47,184 --> 01:05:50,360
are big enough to
get rid of the space

957
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:55,054
which remains there.

958
01:05:55,089 --> 01:05:56,849
So I think that
we are on the top,

959
01:05:56,883 --> 01:06:00,542
but this now is going
very slowly high and high,

960
01:06:00,577 --> 01:06:04,029
but I think that we are
still very far away.

961
01:06:04,063 --> 01:06:07,860
I'm not sure that it
will come next year.

962
01:06:07,894 --> 01:06:10,483
Higgs, we explain Higgs,
and then the dreams

963
01:06:10,518 --> 01:06:11,518
are gone.

964
01:06:12,278 --> 01:06:15,454
No, I think that going ahead,

965
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:18,595
we will find a new
elements which may bring...

966
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:21,080
That is my idea, of course,

967
01:06:21,115 --> 01:06:23,565
probably will bring
us closer and closer,

968
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,016
but I'm not convinced
that we will understand

969
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:29,847
the complete picture [laughs].

970
01:06:29,882 --> 01:06:32,816
[machine whirring]

971
01:08:13,675 --> 01:08:15,919
- [Voiceover] You might
know there is a principle

972
01:08:15,953 --> 01:08:17,886
which is called the
Tropic principle.

973
01:08:17,921 --> 01:08:20,820
It's the whole nature,
laws of nature,

974
01:08:20,855 --> 01:08:24,134
has been designed only
to make it possible

975
01:08:24,169 --> 01:08:25,791
that man can exist,

976
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:30,761
but I doubt it.

977
01:08:33,523 --> 01:08:36,871
Of course, we also
realize that science,

978
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:41,117
physics is only one perspective

979
01:08:42,256 --> 01:08:45,293
of understanding
reality and nature.

980
01:08:45,328 --> 01:08:48,193
And I had a long discussion
here with the Pope

981
01:08:48,227 --> 01:08:50,747
when he visited CERN,

982
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:52,483
not the present Pope,
not the previous Pope.

983
01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:54,199
It was John Paul the Second

984
01:08:54,233 --> 01:08:55,683
who is the third.

985
01:08:58,824 --> 01:09:01,171
So I discussed with
him can there be

986
01:09:01,206 --> 01:09:04,450
a conflict between
science, between physics

987
01:09:04,485 --> 01:09:05,589
and religion?

988
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:12,596
And he agreed, no, there
cannot be a conflict.

989
01:09:12,631 --> 01:09:13,839
He agreed to that.

990
01:09:13,873 --> 01:09:16,807
Then, I ask him,
well, if you agree,

991
01:09:16,842 --> 01:09:19,845
why don't you
repelitate the Helium?

992
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:31,891
If you have the
plate, eating plate,

993
01:09:31,926 --> 01:09:33,445
you are looking at it from top.

994
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:35,309
You would say that's a circle.

995
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:37,276
If you look at it from the side,

996
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:38,622
you say that's not a circle.

997
01:09:38,657 --> 01:09:40,106
That's a line.

998
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:43,869
So this will be two
conflicting perspectives,

999
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:47,735
and you might ask
forever, is it a line,

1000
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:49,495
or is it a circle?

1001
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:52,981
So that's what science
does with reality.

1002
01:09:54,224 --> 01:09:57,814
We're looking at reality
different projections.

1003
01:09:57,848 --> 01:09:59,850
We see one projection.

1004
01:09:59,885 --> 01:10:02,198
Religious is another projection,

1005
01:10:02,232 --> 01:10:04,372
and they might
fight who is right.

1006
01:10:04,407 --> 01:10:06,409
In the end, these are
two different projections

1007
01:10:06,443 --> 01:10:08,134
of the same reality.

1008
01:10:10,723 --> 01:10:14,865
It takes a long time to
clarify a sub-concept.

1009
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,247
How do we define something?

1010
01:10:17,282 --> 01:10:20,940
So the real image data
sync in the true science

1011
01:10:20,975 --> 01:10:24,737
is to create the concepts
which are necessary

1012
01:10:26,843 --> 01:10:29,190
to find the laws of nature.

1013
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,434
Maybe these concepts
are not unique.

1014
01:10:31,468 --> 01:10:32,711
They might be different way

1015
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:34,851
how to describe nature,

1016
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:38,885
why different concepts.
