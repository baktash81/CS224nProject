1
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,930
This is unbelievable!
Look at this!

2
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,990
There's no city like this in the world.
There never was!

3
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,320
You act like you've never been here before.

4
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:09,181
I don't get here often enough.
That's the problem.

5
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:13,471
Can you picture how drop-dead
gorgeous this city is in the rain?

6
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:16,801
Imagine this town in the '20s.
Paris in the '20s,

7
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:19,152
in the rain; the artists and writers.

8
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:21,312
Why does every city have to be in the rain?

9
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:23,732
What's wonderful about getting wet?

10
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:27,392
I mean, could you ever picture us
moving here after we're married?

11
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,052
Oh God, no.

12
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,293
I could never live out of the United States.

13
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:34,063
You know, if I'd stayed here and written novels,

14
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:39,553
and not gotten, you know, caught up in that,
just, grinding out movie scripts...

15
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:40,333
I'll tell you something:

16
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,703
I would drop the house in Beverly Hills,

17
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:45,684
the pool, everything,
in a second.

18
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:48,194
I mean, look:
This is where Monet lived and painted.

19
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:50,194
We're 30 minutes from town.

20
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:52,194
Imagine the two of us settling here.

21
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:55,724
We could do it, I mean,
if my book turns out.

22
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:58,315
You're in love with a fantasy.

23
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,005
I'm in love with you.

24
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,955
We should get back to town.
We're meeting Mom and Dad for dinner.

25
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:09,196
Let's meet 'em.

26
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,226
<i>There are our sightseers.</i>

27
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:20,826
If I never see another charming
boulevard or bistro again, I...

28
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:23,177
- What a town!
- Yes. To visit.

29
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:24,777
I could see myself living here!

30
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:26,797
I feel like the Parisians kind of "get me."

31
00:05:26,797 --> 00:05:29,997
I can see myself just strolling
along the Left Bank with a,

32
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,937
you know, baguette under my arm,

33
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:35,608
headed to CafÃ© de Flore
to scribble away on my book.

34
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:38,418
What did Hemingway say?
He called it a "moveable feast."

35
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:41,198
In this traffic, nothing moves.

36
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:44,708
Well, a toast to John's new business venture here!

37
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,479
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

38
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:49,769
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,119
Well, I'll be perfectly frank.

40
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:57,909
I'm excited about this corporate merger between
our folks and the French company, but otherwise,

41
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,580
I'm not a big Francophile.

42
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,630
- John hates their politics.
- Certainly been no friend to the United States.

43
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,580
Well, I mean, you can't exactly blame them

44
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,470
for not following us down that rabbit's hole in Iraq.

45
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:10,631
- The whole Bush, you know,...
- Oh, please. Let's not get into this

46
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:13,671
- bad discussion again and again.
- Honey, honey. We're not getting into-- By the way, it's

47
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:15,741
fine for your father and I to disagree.

48
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,951
That's what a democracy is.

49
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,681
Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican party,

50
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:21,801
and I happen to think you almost got to be

51
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:25,122
- like, a demented lunatic, but it's like...
- Okay. Okay!

52
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:28,912
But it doesn't mean we don't
respect each other's views, am I right?

53
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:35,432
- Can we talk about the wedding plans?
- Yes! Please.

54
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:36,543
Let's do that.

55
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:40,113
- Your father is just...
- Inez?

56
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:42,863
- Huh? Carol?
- Hi.

57
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:46,263
Oh my G... What are you doing here?

58
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:49,324
- Nice to see you! Hi.
- Hey!

59
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:51,484
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

60
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:53,694
Paul and Carol Bates, this is my mother

61
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:58,244
- and father, and, of course, you know Gail.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.

62
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:00,935
Well, you... you didn't mention
you were going to be here.

63
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:02,135
No, it was sudden. Um...

64
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:06,195
<i>Paul got invited to lecture at
the Sorbone.(sic.) Sorbonne.</i>

65
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:08,865
Oh, how wonderful!

66
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:12,115
Well, uh, Dad's here on business,
and we just decided to

67
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:13,876
- freeload along. - Yes.
- Oh.

68
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,906
That's great. We can spend some time together.

69
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:19,586
Well, I think we have a
lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's...

70
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,596
- What?
- Well, what are doing tomorrow?

71
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:23,506
- We're driving to Verrsailles. (sic.)
- Versailles...

72
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:24,587
- Versailles.
- Oh,

73
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,587
- I'm dying to see Versailles.
- Yeah!

74
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:29,287
But it's too...uh...
We're late...I think what we're...

75
00:07:29,357 --> 00:07:32,397
Tomorrow we're locked in
to a lunch at Brasserie Lipp.

76
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:36,297
- Oh no, that's just...
- Yeah. Yeah, we are. That's already...

77
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:40,058
You know I actually had
a professor that dined there,

78
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:42,038
and saw James Joyce!

79
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:44,138
Yeah, you know, like a
million years ago, and

80
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:48,838
apparently, Joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters.

81
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:52,179
Is that...
That's the end of the story?

82
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:54,139
Well, I mean it's not a story.
It's like a detailed...

83
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,229
- We would LOVE to go to Versailles. Yes.
- Oh, good.

84
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,049
I hope you're not going to be
as antisocial tomorrow at Versailles.

85
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,480
- How was I antisocial?
- Oh, please!

86
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,880
I mean, you could totally tell you didn't want to go.

87
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,600
Well, I mean, they're your
friends, and I have to admit

88
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm not quite as taken with them as you are.

89
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:13,941
He's brilliant.

90
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:17,501
You know, I had such a crush on him
in college, and Carol's very bright.

91
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:19,741
Well, he's a pseudo-intellectual.

92
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:21,531
- Just a little bit.
- Uh, Gil,

93
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:27,501
I hardly think he'd be lecturing at
the Sorbonne if he's a pseudo-intellectual.

94
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:29,112
You should give him your book to read.

95
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:30,692
Oh, come on. Why?

96
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:32,752
No, because he could critique your writing,

97
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:35,182
and maybe show you why you're
having so much trouble.

98
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:37,902
I'm having trouble because
I'm a Hollywood hack

99
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:41,063
who never gave actual
literature a real shot.

100
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:44,303
- Until now.
- Please...Gil...

101
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:47,763
Honey, just promise me something.

102
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:50,483
If this book...doesn't pan out,

103
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:52,754
that you'll stop
eating your brains out,

104
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:55,734
and just go back to doing
what you do best.

105
00:08:55,844 --> 00:09:00,554
I mean, the studios adore you.
You're in demand...

106
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:04,084
Do you really want to give
it all up just to struggle?

107
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,175
- Well...
- Mmm?

108
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:10,025
Mmm?

109
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,735
Why would you...want to do that?

110
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:16,076
I believe Louis moved his court here,

111
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:18,416
uh, in 1682.

112
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:20,506
Originally, all this was swampland.

113
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,386
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,

114
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:25,716
uh... in Old French, the word "versailles"

115
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,007
means, uh, something like,

116
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:31,377
- "terrain were the weeds have been pulled."
- Is that right?

117
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:34,087
Uh... The... uh, middle section here

118
00:09:34,097 --> 00:09:37,977
uh... is... uh, French classical style at its height.

119
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,108
Uh... The work, I believe, of...
uh, "Louis Vau" (Louis le Vau)

120
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:42,968
- Yes.
- Uh...Mansart...I think...

121
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:45,268
- Manzard. (sic.)
- ...and Charles le Brun, I believe.

122
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:46,278
Yes, that's right.

123
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:48,398
I could get used to a summer home like this.

124
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:50,318
- I know you could.
- Me, too,

125
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,489
except, remember: in those days,

126
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:54,579
they only had baths,
and I'm definitely a shower man.

127
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:57,369
Where are you two planning on
moving after you get married?

128
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,669
Uh...Malibu.

129
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:01,339
- Really?
- We're thinking about Malibu, yeah.

130
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:04,609
I'm pushing for a little
attic in Paris with a skylight.

131
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,200
- La bowhem? (sic.)
- Yeah,

132
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,920
all that's missing is the tuberculosis.

133
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,500
Exactly. Thank you.

134
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,390
I mean, you know, the problem
is that he's not exactly sure

135
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,390
- he can write a novel.
- Really?

136
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,090
- Well...
- I mean, honey, so far your track record's-- you know, and...

137
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,481
well, everyone loves your movies.

138
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:23,051
- Yeah, well scripts are easier, so...
- Wow.

139
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:25,731
Why don't you tell them about the lead
character that you're working on right now?

140
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,601
- Yes!  - Oh, come on.
- I don't like to discuss my work.

141
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:31,302
Well, dear, you don't have to tell
them the whole plot, just the character.

142
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:33,292
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

143
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,032
He works in a nostalgia shop.

144
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:38,402
- What's a-- What's a nostalgia shop?
- Oh, not one of those stores where they sell

145
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:41,012
Shirley Temple dolls and old radios?

146
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:42,983
- And I never know who buys that stuff. Who'd want it?
- Exactly.

147
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:46,343
- I don't know.
- Well, people who live in the past,

148
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:49,203
people who think that
their lives would be happier

149
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:51,593
if they lived in an earlier time.

150
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:53,293
And just which era

151
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:56,604
would you have preferred
to live in, Miniver Cheevy?

152
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:59,704
Paris in the '20s, in the rain.

153
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:01,574
- Wouldn't have been bad.
- And the rain was an acid rain.

154
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:03,584
Oh, I see! And no global warming,

155
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:05,664
no TV and suicide bombing,

156
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,765
and nuclear weapons, drug cartels!

157
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:10,475
Usual menu of clichÃ©d horror stories.

158
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:12,595
You know, nostalgia is denial.

159
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:15,985
- Denial of the painful present.
- Oh, whoa!

160
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:18,795
Gil is a complete romantic.
I mean, he would be

161
00:11:18,906 --> 00:11:21,886
more than happy living in a
complete state of perpetual denial.

162
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:24,086
- Really?
- And the name for this fallacy

163
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:27,456
is called "golden-age thinking."

164
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,156
- TouchÃ©.
- Yeah, the erroneous notion that

165
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:33,607
a different time period is better
than the one one's living in.

166
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:37,437
It's a flaw in the Romantic
imagination of those people who...

167
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:41,647
who find it difficult to
cope with the depressive.

168
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:44,948
<i>- Yes.
- This is the nicest ring we saw.</i>

169
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:47,458
Diamonds for a wedding band.

170
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:50,048
That's the way you'd have to go.
And then, everyone will see

171
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:52,618
it in the back row when
he puts it on my finger.

172
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:56,668
Oh, Inez. It's gonna be such an event!

173
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:00,879
- I only wish that...
- I don't want to keep going over it.

174
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,999
It's your choice. What can I say?

175
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:08,649
Gil is-- he's smart,
and he's very successful.

176
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,510
- He talks about giving that all up and moving here!
- Oh, yeah, he TALKS about it.

177
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,020
Well, that frightens me.

178
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,670
This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue.

179
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:22,101
A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb.

180
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:25,601
Rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph.

181
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:28,931
- Is that true?
- It would be in Moudon. He died of the flu,

182
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:33,281
if I'm not mistaken. In 1917, I believe.

183
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:36,042
- Very good, sir.
- He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?

184
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:41,322
Yeah. So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille.

185
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:45,332
Yes, she was an influence, though
Camille was not the wife, but his mistress.

186
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,573
- Camille? No.
- Yes.

187
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:50,593
- Yes. Rose was the wife.
- No, he was never married to Rose.

188
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,453
Yes, he did marry Rose,

189
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:55,013
- in the last year their lives.
- I think you're mistaken.

190
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:57,283
Are you arguing with the guide?

191
00:12:57,284 --> 00:13:01,444
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. No, I'm certain, monsieur.

192
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:03,764
Yeah, actually, she's right.

193
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:07,394
I recently read a two-volume
biography on Rodin, and

194
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:10,244
Rose was definitely the wife.
Camille, the mistress.

195
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,945
- Yeah. You read that? Where did you...
- Yeah, I just read it.  I was surprised

196
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:15,895
because I mistakenly thought, like you, that it was, yeah,

197
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:17,475
the other way around.
It's an easy mistake.

198
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:20,655
So, Dad invited you guys for a wine-tasting.

199
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,656
- Oh, it'll be so French!
- Yeah, yeah.

200
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:25,276
Paul is an expert on French wine.

201
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:29,976
- You're joking. Really?
- Yes, of course.

202
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,436
When did you read the biography on Rodin?

203
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:36,696
Me? Why would I read
a biography on Rodin?

204
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:41,037
I will always take a California wine, but,

205
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,707
Napa Valley's 6,000 miles away.

206
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:45,837
John, old boy, how are you, buddy?

207
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:48,368
Oh, hey! What're you doing here?

208
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:51,938
Come on. I can't stand that guy.

209
00:13:52,328 --> 00:13:54,298
Um...How 'bout

210
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,938
- we try some more wine?
- Yes! Let's start here.

211
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:58,538
Now, which would you prefer here?

212
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:01,349
Well, I think we need to be scientific and just

213
00:14:01,349 --> 00:14:03,519
start drinking them all again. I don't know.

214
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,099
- Why are your cheeks so red?
- What do you mean?

215
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:07,759
- They're not red.
- They're bright red.

216
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,069
Oh, maybe it's because of the
pheromones that you're giving off.

217
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,030
These pheromones are driving me mad!

218
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,130
- Stop it! Stop!
- Ahh-- Sex and alcohol.

219
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,900
- Yeah.
- It fuels the desire

220
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,900
but kills the performance,
according to the Bard.

221
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,561
Have you tasted the '61?

222
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,111
It is divine!

223
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:28,921
- Though, Paul picked it out. I didn't...
- What?

224
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:33,521
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Slightly more tannic than the '59,

225
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,821
and I prefer a smoky feeling
to a fruity feeling.

226
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,672
So, Carol-- Carol and I
are gonna go dancing.

227
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,942
We heard of a great place. Interested?

228
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:47,482
- No... I don't want to be a killjoy,
- Come on!

229
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:49,613
but I need to get a little fresh air.

230
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:51,133
Oh, come on! Come on!

231
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:53,673
Although if you're just gonna sit there and obsess

232
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,643
over where the fire exits are, then...

233
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,643
Hey! If Gil doesn't want to go,
I'll share Paul with you.

234
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:00,863
I am very democratic,

235
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:03,904
and Paul is a marvelous dancer.

236
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,984
If it's OK with you,
I think I just want to take a little walk,

237
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:09,634
go to bed, and then we'll do it another night.

238
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:12,624
OK. Alright, well I can go, though, right?

239
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,955
- You want to go?
- Well, yeah,

240
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:18,745
Yeah, I mean, I'm not tired,
and I've been dying to go dancing,

241
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:20,785
and I'll just meet you back at the hotel.

242
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:23,155
- I'll take good care of her.
- OK.

243
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:24,875
I'll get a cab. Taxi!

244
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:27,966
- OK, but you should take a cab.
- No, I'm not taking a cab.  I'm walking.

245
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:31,036
- No, you'll get lost.
- OK, I'm gonna walk.

246
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,626
Is he a good writer?
I mean, have you read his prose?

247
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:40,607
- Well, he won't let anybody.
- He won't let?

248
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:45,327
Oh look, I mean, if he wants, I'd be glad to
look over his novel and critique it for him.

249
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:47,567
- That would be great!
- Would you?

250
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,917
- You know, I think that's what he needs!
- Yeah?

251
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:53,458
- Well, it helps.
- To have it read by someone. Yeah!

252
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,068
- And you wouldn't pull any punches?

253
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:57,928
- Well, I certainly won't be letting
you know I won't do that.
-No.

254
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:00,148
I do that about you.

255
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,978
See, but, the problem is,
when it comes to his writing,

256
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:05,619
he has absolutely no respect
for anybody else's opinion.

257
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,969
Really?

258
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,192

00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,337
- I didn't hear you.  What?
- Come on!

264
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:56,418
Come on, guy!
Get in the car!

265
00:17:56,738 --> 00:17:59,258
Guys, I think you've got me mixed up.

I can't understand you.
I'm a little drunk! I can't...

268
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:09,148
What is this, an old Peugeot?
I have a friend who collects these in Beverly Hills.

269
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:12,549
Come on, have a drink. Come on!

270
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:16,469
- Come on, buddy! Come on!
- OK.

271
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:19,999
<i>Give me your hand. OK.
Sit down, here.</i>

272
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,410

00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:32,071
OK, now, where are
you guys taking me?

- Yes, what it is, sweetheart?
- Here's a writer, from, um... where?

301
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:48,001
- California.
- Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you, old sport?

302
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:54,272
Gil...the...
You have the same names as...

303
00:20:54,272 --> 00:20:56,012
As what?

I...I...keep looking at the man playing piano, and I

309
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:26,905
believe it or not, recognize his
face from some old sheet music.

310
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:33,965
I know I can be one of the great writers
of musical lyrics - not that I can write melodies, and I try,

311
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:37,905
and then I hear the songs he writes,
and then I realize:  I'll never write a great lyric,

312
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:41,636
- and my talent really lies in drinking.
- Sure does.

313
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:46,366
Yeah, but, he didn't write the music, did he?

314
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:49,566
That's not possible...

00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,427

00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:21,439
I'm ready to move on. Let's do Bricktop's!

323
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:24,439
- Bricktop's?
- I'm bored! He's bored! We're all bored.

324
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,520
We. Are. All. Bored.
Let's do Bricktop's.

325
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,150
Why don't you tell Cole and Linda
to come with, and...um...

326
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,380
uh...Gil? You coming?

This is one of the finest establishments

Greetings and salutations.

337
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:18,238
You'll forgive me.
I've been mixing grain and grape.

338
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:21,329
Now, this a writer. uh...Gil. Yes?

339
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:23,479
- Gil...Gil Pender.
- Gil Pender.

340
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:25,459
Hemingway.

341
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:28,009
Hemingway?

342
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,930
You liked my book?

343
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,810
Liked? I loved!
All your work.

344
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,720
Yes, it was a good book,
because it was an honest book,

345
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,180
and that's what war does to men.

346
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:43,441
And there's nothing fine and noble
about dying in the mud,

347
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:45,611
unless you die gracefully,

348
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,711
and then it's not only noble, but brave.

349
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,331
Did you read my story?
What'd you think?

350
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:55,161
There was some fine writing in it,
but it was unfulfilled.

351
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:58,472
- I might've known you'd hate it.
- But darling, you're too sensitive.

352
00:24:58,472 --> 00:25:00,472
You liked my story, but he hates me!

353
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:04,372
Please, old sport,
you make matters extremely difficult.

354
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:08,362
I'm jumpy.  Suddenly I don't like
the atmosphere here any more.

355
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:10,083
Ah! Where're you going?

356
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,863
<i>Para reunirse con mis amigos en Saint-Germain.
(To meet some friends on Saint-Germain.)</i>

357
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:15,353
- He's going to Saint-Germain. I'm going with him.
- Zelda, sweetheart...

358
00:25:15,353 --> 00:25:19,393
If you're going to stay here and drink
with him, I'm going with the toreador.

359
00:25:19,444 --> 00:25:22,754
Would you bring her back
at a reasonable time?

360
00:25:22,794 --> 00:25:26,544
- She'll drive you crazy, this woman.
- She's exciting,

361
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:28,384
and she has talent.

362
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:31,134
This month it's writing.
Last month it was something else.

363
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:34,805
You're a writer. You need time to write.
Not all this fooling around.

364
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:37,815
She's wasting you because she's
really a competitor. Don't you agree?

365
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:38,415
Me?

366
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:41,825
Speak up, for Christ's sake! I'm asking if
you think my friend is making a tragic mistake.

367
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:44,715
Actually, I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well.

368
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:47,566
You're a writer. You make observations.
You were with them all night!

369
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:50,476
Could we not discuss my personal life in public?

370
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:55,366
She's jealous of his gift,
and it's a fine gift. It's rare.

371
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:58,537
- You like his work? You can speak for it.
- Stop it! Stop it.

372
00:25:58,537 --> 00:25:59,967
You like Mark Twain?

373
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,897
I'm going to find Zelda.

374
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:04,907
I don't like the thought
of her with that Spaniard.

375
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:07,137
May I?

376
00:26:07,138 --> 00:26:09,578
Yeah, I'm actually a huge Mark Twain fan.

377
00:26:09,578 --> 00:26:14,348
I think you can even make the case
that all modern American literature

378
00:26:14,348 --> 00:26:16,918
comes from Huckleberry Finn.

379
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:22,278
- You box?
- No. Not really. No.

380
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:24,889
What're you writing?

381
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:27,249
- A novel.
- 'Bout what?

382
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:31,769
It's about a man who works
in a nostalgia shop.

383
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,770
What the hell is a nostalgia shop?

384
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,800
A place where they sell old things. Memorabilia.

385
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,010
and... Does that sound terrible?

386
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,810
No subject is terrible if the story is true.

387
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:49,331
If the prose is clean and honest,
and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure.

388
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:51,951
No good.

389
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:56,101
Can I ask you the biggest favor in the world?

390
00:26:56,512 --> 00:26:59,232
- What is it?
- Would you read it?

391
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:01,322
- Your novel?
- Yeah, it's like

392
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:06,012
400 pages long, and I'm just
looking for, you know, an opinion.

393
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:08,212
My opinion is I hate it.

394
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:10,473
I mean, you haven't even read it.

395
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:12,773
If it's bad, I'll hate it
because I hate bad writing,

396
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:17,103
and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate it all the more.
You don't want the opinion of another writer.

397
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:20,453
Yeah. You know, it's just...
You know what it is?

398
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,613
I'm having a hard time,

399
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:25,564
you know, trusting somebody to evaluate it.

400
00:27:25,564 --> 00:27:28,444
Writers are competitive.

401
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:30,994
I'm not gonna be competitive with you.

402
00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:33,424
You're too self-effacing.
It's not manly.

403
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:36,155
If you're a writer,
declare yourself the best writer!

404
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:40,625
But you're not, as long as I'm around.
Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it?

405
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,295
No, I don't.

406
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:44,585
Hey, I'm not gonna read your novel,
but I'll tell you what I'll do.

407
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:45,735
Yes?

408
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:47,906
I'll bring it to Gertrude Stein's.

409
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:50,436
She's the only one I trust with my writing.

410
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,626
You'll show my novel to Gertrude Stein?

411
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:56,496
- Give it to me.
- I'll bring it to you.

412
00:27:56,496 --> 00:27:58,196
- And she gets back from Spain tomorrow.
- Great.

413
00:27:58,197 --> 00:28:00,487
I'm gonna go get it.
I'm gonna...

414
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:03,707
I can't tell you how excited I am!
This is gonna be such a lift!

415
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:05,827
My heart is just racing right now!

416
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:08,807
I'm gonna get it, and I'll be back.

417
00:28:18,918 --> 00:28:23,488
Whoa, whoa, Gil!
Take it easy!

418
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:27,969
You had a big night.
Fitzgerald. Hemingway!

419
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:30,399
Papa!
You gotta...

420
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:34,279
OK, we never said where
we were gonna meet.

421
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:17,223
Good thing you didn't go last night.
You would've hated the music, and the crowd,

422
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,223
but I had fun.

423
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:23,323
What're you thinking about?
You seem like you're in a daze.

424
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:27,854
If I was to tell you that I spent

425
00:29:28,574 --> 00:29:31,494
last night with Ernest Hemingway
and Scott Fitzgerald,

426
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:33,974
- what would you say?
- Is that what you were dreaming about?

427
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,974
Your literary idols?

428
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,224
Yeah, but if I wasn't dreaming...

429
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:41,225
What does that mean?

430
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:44,515
If I was with Hemingway,
and Fitzgerald,

431
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:46,065
and Cole Porter.

432
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:48,065
I'd be thinking brain tumor.

433
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:51,365
And when I tell you,
Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly

434
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:56,096
as we've come to know her through
everything we've read in books and articles.

435
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,156
You know, charming, but all over the map.

436
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:02,026
You know, she does not like
Hemingway one bit.

437
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:07,407
and Scott knows Hemingway is right about her,
but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her!

438
00:30:07,957 --> 00:30:09,617
Come on! Get up! We should

439
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:12,557
quit the idle chatter,
because we're gonna be late.

440
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:14,897
You know, I'm not gonna...

441
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,528
I think I'm gonna stay here
and do some work on my novel,

442
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:19,528
'cause there's a little polishing I wanna do.

443
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:25,108
No. You can do that later.
Mom said we can use her decorator's discount. Get up!

444
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:28,819
Come look at these, Inez.

445
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:32,279
Wouldn't these be charming in a Malibu beach house?

446
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:35,549
<i>- Combien, monsieur? (How much, sir?)
- Dix-huit mille. (â¬18,000)</i>

447
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:37,369
<i>- Merci. (Thanks.)
- What is that?</i>

448
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,829
There a steal at $18,000.

449
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,330
$18,000 for this?

450
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,330
Oh wait. It's Euros, so it's more.

451
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,290
- So that's like 20. $20,000.
- Even more, I think. Yeah.

452
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,670
I know, but it's very hard
to find anything like this at home.

453
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:55,741
- She's right, Gil.
- I know, but we haven't even found a house yet,

454
00:30:55,741 --> 00:31:00,661
and we're trying to keep expenses down,
so I don't have to take any crummy rewrite jobs.

455
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:02,941
Well, you get what you pay for.

456
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:05,421
- Nice.
- Cheap is cheap.

457
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,122
OK, you guys want to walk back?

458
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:11,722
Walk? No, it's starting to rain.

459
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:14,742
Oh, it'll be nice walking in the rain!
It's beautiful!

460
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:18,102
No, there's nothing beautiful
about walking in the rain.

461
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:20,683
No, don't forget.
We're taking you to dinner tonight.

462
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:22,123
Oh, right. Yes. Great.

463
00:31:22,123 --> 00:31:26,293
And then, also, I have a big
surprise for you after dinner.

464
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:30,833
- What? No. I don't like surprises.
- I have an incredible...Trust me, you're gonna love this.

465
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,704
- What is it?
- Are you sure you don't want to walk in the rain?

466
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:37,034
This is our last chance.
It's not that bad out.

467
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:39,034
Okay.

468
00:31:42,345 --> 00:31:44,775
I don't understand.
Where are we going?

469
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:46,775
But, you made us rush through dinner,

470
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:49,255
and Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.

471
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:53,855
Profiteroles? You're going to have
the most amazing adventure of your life!

472
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,516
- Where?
- Just, Inez, please.

473
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:02,166
- Why are you carrying that manuscript around?
- You'll see, and when you do,

474
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,166
your jaw is gonna drop.

475
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:09,586
OK. You know I wouldn't hide anything,
so if I'm saying it's incredible,

476
00:32:09,587 --> 00:32:13,347
- it's...
- OK.

477
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:21,507
- It's just, I don't understand!
- I know. You've been wondering why I've been acting strange all day?

478
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:23,778
- Yeah.
- Well, you're about to find out,

479
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:28,618
and you're gonna wonder why I wasn't
acting more strange, when you find out.

480
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:31,118
- This is very...
- I know. I know.

481
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:44,649
Well, I don't know what you're carrying on about,
but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure.

482
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,170
I am tired from the gym and a massage,
so I'm gonna get this cab.

483
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,650
- Taxi!
- Inez, wait!

484
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,780
- Let's just wait a little longer.
- Look,

485
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,270
you want to walk the streets of Paris,
and take it in by night,

486
00:32:56,271 --> 00:33:00,091
that's fine. You go ahead.
But I'm in the middle of a great book that Carol lent me.

487
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:02,951
Come on, just 10 more minutes,
and then we can walk home.

488
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:06,271
If I'm asleep when you get in,
don't wake me up.

489
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:14,422
What am I doing wrong?

490
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:17,892
Unless she's right,
and I need to see a neurologist.

491
00:33:18,202 --> 00:33:23,252
OK, you left the wine-tasting, a little drunk,
but not out of control.

492
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:27,053
Lost, you walk along...
this is the spot...

493
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:29,663
I mean, it's just like a one-shot deal.

494
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,393
The clock struck midnight...

495
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:49,765
Hello!

496
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:55,505
Oh, hi, Mr. Hemingway. Here.

497
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:57,505
Let me just jump in.

498
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,396
The assignment was to take the hill.
There were 4 of us.

499
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:12,857
5 if you counted Vicente, but he had
lost his hand when a grenade went off

500
00:34:12,857 --> 00:34:15,337
and couldn't fight as he could when I first met him.

501
00:34:15,337 --> 00:34:17,337
And he was young, and brave.

502
00:34:17,337 --> 00:34:21,507
And the hill was soggy from days of rain,
and the hill sloped down toward a road,

503
00:34:21,508 --> 00:34:23,988
and there were many German soldiers on the road.

504
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:26,098
And the idea was to aim for the first group,

505
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:29,258
and if our aim was true, we could delay them.

506
00:34:29,758 --> 00:34:32,208
- Were you scared?
- Of what?

507
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:34,928
Getting killed?

508
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:38,479
You'll never write well
if you're afraid of dying.

509
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,189
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do. I'd say it's probably...

510
00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:43,359
maybe my greatest fear, actually.

511
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,949
Well, that's something all men before
you have done. All men will do.

512
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,960
- I know. I know.
- Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?

513
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,410
Actually, my fiancÃ©e is pretty sexy.

514
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,380
And when you make love to her,
you feel true, and beautiful

515
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,550
passion, and you, for at least that moment,
lose your fear of death.

516
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:03,831
No. That doesn't happen.

517
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:07,831
I believe that love that is true and real
creates a respite from death.

518
00:35:07,831 --> 00:35:12,401
All cowardice comes from not loving,
or not loving well, which is the same thing.

519
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,372
And when the man who is brave and true
looks Death squarely in the face

520
00:35:16,372 --> 00:35:20,752
like some rhino-hunters I know,
or Belmonte, who's truly brave.

521
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:25,882
It is because they love with sufficient
passion, to push death out of their minds,

522
00:35:25,883 --> 00:35:28,753
until it returns, as it does, to all men.

523
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:31,973
And then you must make really good love again.

524
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,313
Think about it.

525
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,585
- Alice. How the hell are you?
- Hi!

526
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:54,815
Good? Good. Ah, she's here. Follow me.

527
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:57,385
<i>- Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.(No. I don't agree.)
- Mais pourquoi? (But why?)</i>

528
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:58,715
<i>Parce-que... (Because...)</i>

529
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:01,205
This is Gil Pender, Miss Stein.

530
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:03,776
He's a young American writer.
I thought you two should know each other.

531
00:36:03,776 --> 00:36:05,256
I'm glad you're here.

532
00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:08,276
You can help decide which of us is right,
and which of us is wrong.

533
00:36:08,276 --> 00:36:11,676
I was just telling Pablo that
this portrait doesn't capture Adriana.

534
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:14,956
It has a universality, but no objectivity.

535
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:17,217
<i>Non, non, non. Vous ne le comprenez pas correctement.
(No, no ,no. You don't understand correctly.)</i>

536
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,947
<i>Connaisez pas Adriana. Regardez...
(You don't know Adriana. Look...)</i>

537
00:36:18,947 --> 00:36:20,467
<i>Regardez le mouvement, le tableau.
(Look at the motion, the painting.)</i>

538
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:22,227
<i>C'est exactement ce qu'elle reprÃ©sente!
(It's exactly what she represents!)</i>

539
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:25,267
<i>Non. Tu n'as pas raison.(No. You're wrong.)
Look how he's done her:</i>

540
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,658
dripping with sexual innuendo,

541
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:31,718
carnal to the point of smoldering,
and, yes, she's beautiful, but

542
00:36:31,718 --> 00:36:34,678
it's a subtle beauty;
an implied sensuality.

543
00:36:34,808 --> 00:36:38,388
I mean, what is your first
impression of Adriana?

544
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,959
Exceptionally lovely.

545
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:46,289
<i>Belle, mais trop subtile. Plus implicite, Pablo!
(Beautiful, but too subtle. More defined, Pablo!)</i>

546
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,669
Yes, you're right, Miss Stein.
'Course...uh...

547
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:50,959
you can see why he's lost all objectivity.

548
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,020
He's made a creature of Place Pigalle.

549
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,740
A whore with volcanic appetites.

550
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,310
<i>Non, non! C'est ce qu'elle vraiment si vous la connaissez!
(No, no! It's true if you know her!)</i>

551
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,460
<i>Yes, avec toi, au privÃ©,
(Yes, with you, in private,)</i>

552
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,410
because she's your lover,
but we don't know her that way!

553
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:06,331
So you make a petit-bourgeois judgment
and turn her into an object of pleasure.

554
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:10,331
<i>- It's more like a still-life than a portrait.
- Non.</i>

555
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:14,031
<i>Non. Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.
(No. No. I do not agree.)</i>

556
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:16,172
And what's this book of
yours I've been hearing about?

557
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:17,232
Is this it?

558
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:19,112
- Yeah, this is...uh...
- I'll take a look.

559
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,932
Have you read it, Hemingway?

560
00:37:20,932 --> 00:37:24,552
No, this I leave to you.
You've always been a fine judge of my work.

561
00:37:24,782 --> 00:37:27,372
" "Out of the Past" was the name of the store,"

562
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:29,803
"and its products consisted of memories."

563
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:33,103
"What was prosaic and
even vulgar to one generation,"

564
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:36,193
"had been transmuted by
the mere passing of years"

565
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:40,443
"to a status at once magical and also camp."

566
00:37:40,604 --> 00:37:42,624
I love it.

567
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:46,214
I'm already hooked.
Hooked!

568
00:37:47,074 --> 00:37:48,684
I'll start it tonight,

569
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:51,604
but first, you and I
have something to talk about.

570
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:55,195
<i>I've been waiting for two months
for a reply from that editor.</i>

571
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:58,255
<i>I sent him the piece you and I
looked at, plus four others,</i>

572
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:02,025
<i>plus four shorter pieces.
And this guy, I gave him a copy of the...</i>

573
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:09,036
<i>- Nevertheless, two months: nary a word.
- Right.</i>

574
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:15,026
So were you really hooked
with those opening lines?

575
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:21,047
Oh, the past has always had a
great charisma for me.

576
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:25,437
Oh, me, too.
Great charisma for me.

577
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:28,257
I always say that I was born too late.

578
00:38:28,257 --> 00:38:30,997
<i>Mmm. Moi aussi.
(Mmm. Me, too.)</i>

579
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:34,378
<i>For me, la Belle Ãpoque Paris
would have been perfect.</i>

580
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:37,508
- Really? Better than now?
- Yes.

581
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:42,118
Another whole sensibility,
the street lamps, the kiosques,

582
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,439
the...horse and carriages,

583
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:49,229
and Maxim's then.

584
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,809
You speak very good English.

585
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:55,389
- No, not really.
- No, you do!

586
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,850
How long have you been dating Picasso?

587
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,870
My God, did I just say that?

588
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,390
Pardon?

589
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,540
I don't mean to...I didn't mean to pry....
Were you born in Paris?

590
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:11,961
I was born in Bordeaux.

591
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:15,091
I moved here to study fashion.

592
00:39:15,141 --> 00:39:16,951
But you don't want to hear all this.

593
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,951
Yes, I do.

594
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:23,552
Yes, continue.
You moved here to study fashion...

595
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:27,992
I...came here to study with Coco Chanel,

596
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,692
<i>and I fell in love with Paris,</i>

597
00:39:30,753 --> 00:39:32,763
and also,

598
00:39:32,883 --> 00:39:38,453
a very dark-eyed, haunted
Jewish-Italian painter.

599
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:47,143
And I knew Amedeo had another woman, but still,
I couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked,

600
00:39:47,144 --> 00:39:49,934
and it was a beautiful six months.

601
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:53,064
M..M...Modigliani?

602
00:39:53,064 --> 00:39:57,564
You lived with...
You lived with Modigliani?

603
00:39:57,565 --> 00:40:02,605
You asked me,
so I'm telling you my sad story.

604
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:07,595
With Braque, though, there was another woman.

605
00:40:08,426 --> 00:40:10,036
Many.

606
00:40:10,846 --> 00:40:12,796
And now,

607
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:14,796
with Pablo.

608
00:40:14,796 --> 00:40:18,556
I mean, he's married,
but...

609
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:22,196
every day, it's on-again, off-again.

610
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:27,447
I don't know how any woman
can stay with him. He's so difficult.

611
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:32,887
My God, you take "art groupie"
to a whole new level!

612
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:37,158
- Pardon?
- Nothing. I was just saying that...

613
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:39,158
But tell me about yourself.

614
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:44,218
- What? Well, what can I say...
- So, have you come to Paris to write?

615
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:46,699
Because, you know,

616
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:51,699
these days, so many Americans
feel the need to move here.

617
00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:56,339
Isn't Hemingway attractive?

618
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:59,339
I love his writing.

619
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,040
I know. Actually, I'm just here visiting.

620
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,040
Oh, you must stay here.

621
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,340
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a wonderful city, for

622
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:14,841
- writers, artists.
- I know. I'd like to, but it's not that easy.

623
00:41:15,261 --> 00:41:16,841
And,

624
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:21,821
I didn't fall in love madly with your book...

625
00:41:21,822 --> 00:41:24,522
- Really?
- ...so I want to hear the rest of it.

626
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:29,252
- You really like? Because I'm still kind of tinkering...
- Pender?

627
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:33,632
- Yeah, let's go up to Montmartre. Let's get a drink, OK?
- Uh...yeah.

628
00:41:33,632 --> 00:41:38,062
I'll discuss your book with you as soon as I've finished it.
Where can I reach you?

629
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:42,443
Why don't I drop back by, instead of you
trying to find me, if that's all right?

630
00:41:42,443 --> 00:41:46,773
- We run an open house.
- Are you coming with us?

631
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,444
I wish that I could.
I cant, but

632
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:53,404
hopefully I'll see you again eventually.

633
00:41:53,404 --> 00:41:55,614
That would be nice.

634
00:41:55,824 --> 00:41:58,884
- Let's go!
- One of these days, I plan to steal you away from this genius

635
00:41:58,885 --> 00:42:01,515
who's great, but he's no MirÃ³.

636
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,616
I'm Gil Pender.

637
00:42:20,616 --> 00:42:24,876
I was with Hemingway, and Picasso.

638
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:29,197
Pablo Picasso, and Ernest Hemingway.

639
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:33,587
I'm Gil Pender, from Pasadena!

640
00:42:34,097 --> 00:42:38,177
Cub Scouts. I failed freshman English.

641
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:41,988
Little old Gil Pender has his novel

642
00:42:41,988 --> 00:42:45,728
with Gertrude. Stein.

643
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:49,168
Boy, that girl was so...

644
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,869
lovely.

645
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:58,209
Well, it's a shame you two didn't
come to the movies with us last night,

646
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:01,139
We saw a wonderfully
funny American film.

647
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,830
Who was in it?

648
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,670
Oh, I don't know.
I forget the name.

649
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:08,370
Wonderful but forgettable.
That sounds like a picture I've seen.

650
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,060
I probably wrote it.

651
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,890
Well, I know it was moronic and infantile, and

652
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,721
utterly lacking in any wit or believability,

653
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:19,151
- but John and I laughed in spite of all that.
- Have we been down this way yet?

654
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:21,091
Was it?

655
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:24,081
What time did you get in last night?

656
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:26,901
Not that late...uh...
I was...uh...

657
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:30,392
I'm really finding these midnight strolls
great for me creatively,

658
00:43:30,392 --> 00:43:33,612
without the distractions of the day.
I'll probably end up going on another little

659
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:36,812
- hike tonight.
- Well, we'll see.

660
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:39,352
Yeah. We'll see.

661
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:43,013
Oh, look at those wonderful glass figures.

662
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:48,033
<i>[Cole Porter's "You Do Something to Me"]
âª ...that simply mystifies me âª</i>

663
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:54,133
<i>âª Tell me why should it be  âª</i>

664
00:43:54,514 --> 00:44:00,594
<i>âª You have the power to hypnotize me âª</i>

665
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:02,414
<i>Vous aimez?
(You like?)</i>

666
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:04,595
Yes. Very beautiful.

667
00:44:04,595 --> 00:44:06,685
- Oh. You're American.
- Yeah.

668
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:08,835
You like Cole Porter?

669
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:11,935
I do. I'm a big fan.
I like to

670
00:44:11,935 --> 00:44:16,055
kind of think I'm a member
of Linda and Cole's inner circle.

671
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:18,056
I'm kidding.

672
00:44:18,946 --> 00:44:20,596
Very pretty lyrics.

673
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:23,616
- Very amusing.
- Charming.

674
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,327
Gil?

675
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:32,787
- Gil? Hi.
- Yeah? Yes.

676
00:44:32,787 --> 00:44:35,247
- Yeah. We should go.
- We're going now?

677
00:44:35,247 --> 00:44:38,687
Yeah. We're meeting Paul and Carol
at the museum for the private showing.

678
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:40,267
- OK. Yeah. Right.

679
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,778
You know, Paul happens to be an expert in Monet,

680
00:44:42,778 --> 00:44:44,778
so you'll find it enlightening, I think.

681
00:44:44,778 --> 00:44:46,068
Yeah. OK.

682
00:44:46,068 --> 00:44:48,938
Let's get some culture.

683
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:52,638
The juxtaposition of color is amazing.

684
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:55,239
This man was the real father

685
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,189
of abstract expressionism.

686
00:44:57,189 --> 00:44:59,449
I take that back.
Maybe Turner.

687
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,389
I mean, I love Turner,

688
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:04,389
but, I just find this...

689
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:05,640
overwhelming.

690
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,900
If I'm not mistaken,
it took him 2 years to complete this.

691
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,110
He worked out of Giverny,
where he was frequently...

692
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,360
I heard that Monet,
one of the things that he used to try to...

693
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,020
Shh! I'm trying to hear Paul say it.

694
00:45:18,161 --> 00:45:20,321
Well, he was frequently
visited by Caillebotte,

695
00:45:20,321 --> 00:45:23,471
an artist who I personally feel was underrated.

696
00:45:23,871 --> 00:45:25,731
Ah. Now.

697
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:28,071
Here's a superb Picasso.

698
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:32,201
If I'm not mistaken, he painted
this marvelous portrait of his

699
00:45:32,202 --> 00:45:35,912
French mistress
Madeleine Brissou in the '20s.

700
00:45:36,372 --> 00:45:39,362
Paul, I'm gonna have to
differ with you on this one.

701
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,652
- Really.
- Gil, just pay attention.

702
00:45:41,653 --> 00:45:43,253
You might learn something.

703
00:45:43,253 --> 00:45:45,363
OK, well, if I'm not mistaken,

704
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:47,883
this was a failed attempt to capture

705
00:45:47,883 --> 00:45:50,693
a young French girl named Adriana,

706
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:53,853
from Bordeaux, if my art history serves me,

707
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:57,944
who came to Paris to study
costume design for the theater.

708
00:45:57,944 --> 00:46:01,874
I'm pretty sure she had an affair
with Modigliani, then Braque,

709
00:46:01,874 --> 00:46:04,534
which is how Pablo met her.
Picasso.

710
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,614
Of course, what you don't get

711
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:09,385
from this portrait
is the subtlety,

712
00:46:09,385 --> 00:46:11,905
and her beauty.
She was just a knock-out.

713
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:15,865
What have you been smoking?

714
00:46:16,135 --> 00:46:18,775
I'd hardly call this picture marvelous,

715
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,986
it's more of a petit-bourgeois statement

716
00:46:20,996 --> 00:46:23,996
on how Pablo sees her. Saw her.

717
00:46:24,276 --> 00:46:26,646
He's distracted by the fact
that she was a

718
00:46:26,646 --> 00:46:29,576
absolute volcano in the sack.

719
00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:38,397
Too rich for me.

720
00:46:39,707 --> 00:46:41,467
Where'd Gil run off to?

721
00:46:42,748 --> 00:46:44,128
Work.

722
00:46:45,508 --> 00:46:47,668
Been walking around Paris. You know,

723
00:46:47,668 --> 00:46:52,778
the way the city's lit up at night
allegedly inspires him, so...

724
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:56,328
But that's OK,
because I'm going dancing with Paul.

725
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:58,139
Where's Carol?

726
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:01,259
uh...She's in bed with a bad oyster,

727
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:02,659
so I'll see you guys later.

728
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:04,659
Thanks for dinner, Daddy.

729
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:06,819
Bye, sweetie.

730
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:10,620
Where do you think
Gil goes every night?

731
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,590
You heard her.
He walks, and gets ideas.

732
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,720
- You sound skeptical.
- No.

733
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,400
I've seen what he earns,
but sometimes I think he's got a...

734
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:21,881
got a... part missing,

735
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,881
and I didn't like his remark about

736
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:26,101
Tea Party Republicans.
They are decent

737
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:28,021
people trying to take back the country.

738
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:30,021
They are not
crypto-fascist

739
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:32,021
airhead zombies.
You hear him say that?

740
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:34,681
Nevertheless, I don't think
your idea of having him followed

741
00:47:34,682 --> 00:47:36,962
- is very practical.
- No?

742
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:38,822
I'd like to know where he goes every night.

743
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,582
Well, we know one thing:

744
00:47:40,582 --> 00:47:42,342
he doesn't go dancing.

745
00:47:55,113 --> 00:47:57,313
Oh! Excuse me!

746
00:47:58,524 --> 00:48:01,304
- Is this gentleman bothering you?
- Hello, Gil!

747
00:48:01,304 --> 00:48:03,954
Hey! How are you?
I was hoping we'd see you here.

748
00:48:04,294 --> 00:48:06,574
- What a great party!
- Oh, good.

749
00:48:06,574 --> 00:48:08,574
- It's nice to see you here.
- Thank you.

750
00:48:08,574 --> 00:48:10,574
Oh, Delfine?

751
00:48:10,575 --> 00:48:13,175
- Gil, we'll catch up with you later, OK?
- Sure, sure.

752
00:48:13,175 --> 00:48:15,175
<i>Bon soir, Madame.
(Good evening, Madame.)</i>

753
00:48:15,175 --> 00:48:17,755
- What a surprise!
- It was just a total fluke.

754
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:19,495
I was at Gertrude Stein's,

755
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:21,755
she's almost finished with my novel,
and I run into this guy.

756
00:48:21,756 --> 00:48:24,096
Turns out he's Archibald MacLeish.
He says he's on his way over here,

757
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:25,896
come on over. Oh, I'm not
going to crash the Fitzgeralds,

758
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,726
but then he said you'd be here.
You and Pablo, and...

759
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:30,336
Oh, Pablo's home.

760
00:48:30,336 --> 00:48:33,766
- We had a...bit of a quarrel.
- Oh no!

761
00:48:34,017 --> 00:48:37,647
- You look like you were having fun with Djuna Barnes, dancing.
- Oh, yeah!

762
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:39,647
Wait. That was Djuna Barnes?

763
00:48:39,647 --> 00:48:42,187
- Yeah.
- Wow. No wonder she wanted to lead.

764
00:48:42,187 --> 00:48:45,997
Isn't this a wonderful
place to throw a party?

765
00:48:45,997 --> 00:48:49,467
- It's so great!
- Only the Fitzgeralds can do that!

766
00:48:49,538 --> 00:48:52,618
- I want to show you something. Come with me.
- OK.

767
00:48:54,428 --> 00:48:57,928
- So, what about your book?
- It's coming along. Yeah!

768
00:48:58,598 --> 00:49:00,878
Look at that!

769
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:04,439
- Wow!
- It's from the turn of the century.

770
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:07,709
Isn't it beautiful?
It's my favorite era.

771
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:10,799
I love it so much.
Everything was so perfect.

772
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:12,819
It's so nice to see you tonight.

773
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,630
- I was hoping to...
- It's so nice to see you!

774
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:16,980
<i>VoilÃ , ma petite Adriana!
(There she is, my little Adriana!)</i>

775
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,750
Isn't this little Parisian
dream a moveable feast?

776
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:24,060
Mark my words.
I'm going to steal you away

777
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,061
from that fugitive from
MÃ¡laga one way or another.

778
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:29,881
Between Belmonte and myself,
whom would you choose?

779
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:31,491
<i>Vous Ãªtes tous deux parfaits.
(You are both perfect.)</i>

780
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:34,321
But he has more courage.
He faces death more often, and

781
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:37,501
more directly, and if you chose him,
I'd be disappointed, but I'd understand.

782
00:49:37,502 --> 00:49:39,182
<i>Ella ha elegido Pablo.>
(She chose Pablo.)</i>

783
00:49:39,192 --> 00:49:41,722
Yes, she's chosen Picasso,
but Pablo thinks

784
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:44,412
women are only to sleep
with or to paint.

785
00:49:44,632 --> 00:49:45,982
What about you?

786
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:48,642
I think a woman is equal
to a man in courage.

787
00:49:48,643 --> 00:49:51,213
Have you ever shot
a charging lion?

788
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,053
Never.

789
00:49:53,053 --> 00:49:55,383
Would you like to know
how that feels?

790
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:57,393
- I don't think so.
- You ever hunted?

791
00:49:57,393 --> 00:49:58,793
- No.
- You?

792
00:49:58,793 --> 00:50:01,033
Only for bargains.

793
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,594
<i>TomÃ©monos otra copita.
(Let's take another drink.)</i>

794
00:50:04,624 --> 00:50:07,664
You know, it's so loud,
I wonder if we can go some place

795
00:50:07,664 --> 00:50:11,774
- where we can hear ourselves think a little bit?
- Sure! Bye.

796
00:50:11,794 --> 00:50:13,904
Who wants a fight?

797
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:17,315
Well, I hope it was nothing
serious with you and Pablo.

798
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:19,985
He's moody and possessive.

799
00:50:19,985 --> 00:50:21,815
Artists are like children.

800
00:50:21,815 --> 00:50:25,055
Well, you certainly understand why
all these guys want to paint you,

801
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:28,195
'cause you have just about
one of the best faces ever.

802
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:31,266
- It's so interesting...
- Oh?

803
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:35,696
- You're interesting, too, in a lost way.
- Lost?

804
00:50:36,476 --> 00:50:38,426
Well, I guess I am lost.

805
00:50:38,427 --> 00:50:40,427
Tell me more about your book.

806
00:50:40,577 --> 00:50:43,687
My book is kind of a...

807
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:48,227
You know what?
I couldn't care less about my book tonight.

808
00:50:48,227 --> 00:50:50,457
I just want to walk around Paris with you.

809
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:53,498
I keep forgetting you're just a tourist.

810
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:55,558
That's putting it mildly.

811
00:50:55,558 --> 00:50:57,788
I can never decide whether

812
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:01,408
Paris is more beautiful by day or by night.

813
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:03,588
No, you can't.
You couldn't pick one. I mean,

814
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:07,379
I can give you a checkmate
argument for each side.

815
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:10,579
You know, I sometimes think,
"How's anyone gonna come up with a

816
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:12,579
book, or a painting, or a

817
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:16,069
symphony or a sculpture that can
compete with a great city?"

818
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,570
You can't, 'cause, like,
you look around, every...

819
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:22,440
every street, every boulevard
is its own special art form.

820
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,800
And when you think that in the cold,

821
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,130
violent, meaningless universe,
that Paris exists, these lights...

822
00:51:30,131 --> 00:51:34,201
I mean, come on, there's nothing
happening on Jupiter or Neptune,

823
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:37,231
but from way out in space
you can see these lights,

824
00:51:37,231 --> 00:51:41,401
the cafÃ©s, people drinking, and singing...

825
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:45,932
I mean, for all we know,
Paris is the hottest spot in the universe.

826
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:48,152
<i>- Vous Ãªtes un poÃ¨te.(You are a poet.)
- Aw, come on.</i>

827
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:53,542
It's just... You're very kind,
but I wouldn't call my babbling poetic.

828
00:51:53,613 --> 00:51:56,323
Although I was on a pretty good roll there.

829
00:51:56,733 --> 00:51:58,423
See anything you like?

830
00:51:58,423 --> 00:52:02,043
Yeah. I'm ashamed to admit
I'm attracted to all of them.

831
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:05,353
I like cheap sexy.
That makes me shallow.

832
00:52:05,754 --> 00:52:09,284
When I was in Catholic school,
one weekend

833
00:52:09,284 --> 00:52:12,774
my roommate and I,
we paid a girl from Pigalle

834
00:52:12,774 --> 00:52:16,204
to come and teach us all her tricks.

835
00:52:16,224 --> 00:52:18,324
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

836
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:20,345
Wow. That's...

837
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:26,805
That's...That's...
I'm going to be thinking about that one.

838
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:36,156
I love walking with you.

839
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:39,426
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

840
00:52:42,497 --> 00:52:45,227
God, is that who I think it is?

841
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:47,957
What is she doing here,
staring into the water?

842
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:50,387
Oh my God!

843
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:52,747
Zelda, what are you doing?!

844
00:52:52,747 --> 00:52:55,317
- Please? I don't want to live!
- Stop!

845
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:58,358
- What is it?
- Scott and that beautiful countess.

846
00:52:58,928 --> 00:53:01,118
They were-- It was so obvious
they were whispering about me,

847
00:53:01,158 --> 00:53:04,628
and the more they drank,
the more he fell in love with her!

848
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:06,458
He...Scott loves only you.

849
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:08,779
- I can tell you that with absolute certainty.
- No.

850
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:11,469
- He's tired of me!
- You're wrong. You're wrong. I know.

851
00:53:11,899 --> 00:53:15,199
- How?
- Trust me. I know.

852
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:18,639
- Sometimes you get a feel for people, and I get...
- My skin hurts!

853
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,050
- What do you mean?
- I don't wanna...I hate the way I look!

854
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,050
Don't do that!

855
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,540
- Here. Take this.
- What is this?

856
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,540
It's a Valium.
It'll make you feel better.

857
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,970
- You carry medicine?
- No, not normally.

858
00:53:31,971 --> 00:53:33,821
It's just since I've been engaged to Inez,

859
00:53:33,821 --> 00:53:38,571
I've been having panic attacks,
but I'm sure they'll subside after the wedding.

860
00:53:38,571 --> 00:53:41,031
I've never heard of Valium.
What is this?

861
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:44,551
It's the...pill of the future.

862
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:51,102
You never said you were getting married.

863
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:54,422
Yeah. You know,
it's still a....

864
00:53:54,422 --> 00:53:57,142
ways in the future.

865
00:53:57,413 --> 00:54:01,403
- Well, good luck with your book, and your wedding.
- Thank you.

866
00:54:01,543 --> 00:54:03,913
I think you'd like Inez.
She has a...

867
00:54:03,913 --> 00:54:06,453
has a very sharp sense of humor, and

868
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:10,783
she's attractive. She doesn't say
that we agree on everything, but...

869
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:13,034
But the important things.

870
00:54:13,034 --> 00:54:15,164
Yeah, or...actually,

871
00:54:15,164 --> 00:54:17,124
maybe the small things. The...

872
00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:20,674
Sometimes there's a little bit
of a disconnect with the big things.

873
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:23,145
She wants to live in Malibu, and

874
00:54:23,145 --> 00:54:26,035
wants me to work in Hollywood, and....

875
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:29,305
But I will say that we both like

876
00:54:29,805 --> 00:54:32,865
Indian food.
Not all Indian food, but the...

877
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:35,016
you know...the pita bread.

878
00:54:35,016 --> 00:54:38,286
We both like pita bread.
I guess it's called naan.

879
00:54:39,636 --> 00:54:41,306
I should go.

880
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,306
Pablo will be missing me.

881
00:54:43,306 --> 00:54:45,616
- Come on. I'll walk you home.
- No. No. No.

882
00:54:45,617 --> 00:54:47,927
Just finish your drink.
I live just around the corner.

883
00:54:47,927 --> 00:54:52,337
- No. Come on. I'm not gonna...
- Well, I...I...prefer to be by myself for a while,

884
00:54:52,337 --> 00:54:56,347
but thank you for the evening.
Bye.

885
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:01,728
<i>Monsieur? C'est un dommage.
(Sir? It's a shame.)</i>

886
00:55:01,728 --> 00:55:03,728
<i>C'est un dommage.
(It's a shame.)</i>

887
00:55:04,298 --> 00:55:06,458
We met, earlier tonight...

888
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:08,798
At the party!

889
00:55:09,238 --> 00:55:10,798
<i>DalÃ­, sÃ­?
(DalÃ­, yes?)</i>

890
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,199
- Yes...
- DalÃ­!

891
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,279
- I remember!
- DalÃ­. Ya.

892
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:18,949
<i>Un bouteille de vin rouge!
(A bottle of red wine!)</i>

893
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,239
It can't be...
Yeah....

894
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,370
So?

895
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,760
<i>Un autre verre pour monsieur, s'il vous plaÃ®t.
(Another glass for this man, please.)</i>

896
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,580
I love the language!

897
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,910
The French!
The waiters? No.

898
00:55:36,741 --> 00:55:40,331
You like the shape of the rhinoceros?

899
00:55:40,611 --> 00:55:43,231
The rhinoceros? Uh...

900
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:46,191
Haven't really thought about it.

901
00:55:46,391 --> 00:55:50,751
I paint the rhinoceros.
I paint you.

902
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:53,922
<i>SÃ­. Your sad eyes.</i>

903
00:55:53,932 --> 00:55:58,502
Your big lips, melting over the hot sand,

904
00:55:58,532 --> 00:56:00,832
with one tear.

905
00:56:00,843 --> 00:56:05,463
Yes! And in your tear,
another face.

906
00:56:05,493 --> 00:56:08,073
The Christ's face!

907
00:56:08,223 --> 00:56:11,263
Yes, in the rhinoceros.

908
00:56:11,404 --> 00:56:14,434
Yeah. I mean, I probably do look sad. I'm in...

909
00:56:14,434 --> 00:56:17,764
a very perplexing situation.

910
00:56:18,654 --> 00:56:22,864
<>Diablo...Luis! Oye, Luis!
(Damn. Luis! Hey, Luis!)

911
00:56:23,054 --> 00:56:25,454
My friends.

912
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,425
This... SeÃ±or BuÃ±uel.

913
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:32,435
- BuÃ±uel?
- SÃ­. BuÃ±uel...and...Mr. Man Ray.

914
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:35,425
- Man Ray? My Gosh!
- How 'bout that?

915
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:39,195
This is Pen-der. Pen-der.

916
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:41,396
Pender!

917
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:44,646
- Yes. And I am DalÃ­!
- DalÃ­. Yes.

918
00:56:44,646 --> 00:56:46,646
You have to remember.

919
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,956
Pender is in a perplexing situation.

920
00:56:49,957 --> 00:56:53,037
It sounds so crazy to say.

921
00:56:53,037 --> 00:56:55,637
You guys are going to think I'm drunk, but

922
00:56:55,637 --> 00:56:57,757
I have to tell someone. I'm...

923
00:56:57,757 --> 00:56:59,767
from a...

924
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:02,147
a different time. Another era.

925
00:57:02,148 --> 00:57:05,018
The future. OK? I come...

926
00:57:05,018 --> 00:57:07,838
from the 2000th millenium to here.

927
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,828
I get in a car, and I slide through time.

928
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,638
Exactly correct.

929
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,749
You inhabit two worlds.

930
00:57:15,749 --> 00:57:18,649
- So far, I see nothing strange.
- Why?

931
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:20,279
Yeah, you're surrealists!

932
00:57:20,279 --> 00:57:22,879
But I'm a normal guy.
See, in one life,

933
00:57:22,879 --> 00:57:25,379
I'm engaged to marry a woman I love.

934
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:27,639
At least, I think I love her.

935
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:30,360
Christ! I better love her!
I'm marrying her!

936
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,850
The rhinoceros makes love

937
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:35,610
by mounting the female.

938
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,550
But...

939
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,850
is there a difference

940
00:57:39,851 --> 00:57:43,491
in the beauty between two

941
00:57:43,491 --> 00:57:45,971
rhinoceroses?

942
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:48,201
There is another woman?

943
00:57:48,201 --> 00:57:51,641
Adriana. Yes, and I'm...

944
00:57:51,892 --> 00:57:53,952
very drawn to her.

945
00:57:53,952 --> 00:57:57,272
I find her extremely alluring.

946
00:57:57,272 --> 00:58:00,982
The problem is that other men,

947
00:58:00,982 --> 00:58:04,982
great artists - geniuses -
also find her alluring,

948
00:58:04,993 --> 00:58:08,473
and she finds them.
So, there's that...

949
00:58:08,473 --> 00:58:12,453
A man in love with a woman
from a different era.

950
00:58:12,483 --> 00:58:14,333
I see a photograph.

951
00:58:14,343 --> 00:58:16,543
I see a film.

952
00:58:16,554 --> 00:58:19,684
I see an insurmountable problem.

953
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:21,544
I see...

954
00:58:21,544 --> 00:58:24,514
...a rhinoceros.

955
00:58:24,514 --> 00:58:26,264
Did you get any work done last night?

956
00:58:26,264 --> 00:58:29,194
Yeah...I just....
I'm starting to think that maybe my

957
00:58:29,195 --> 00:58:30,745
book is too realistic.

958
00:58:30,745 --> 00:58:34,115
That I'm missing some chances
to let my imagination kind of

959
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:38,395
go crazy, and not be so
damn logical.

960
00:58:38,505 --> 00:58:42,005
- Why do you always look so good in the morning?
- No. No. No. No!

961
00:58:42,006 --> 00:58:43,436
- We have to get dressed!
- Just for a second!

962
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:47,386
Come here! I've been working like a demon.
I gotta get this stuff done, but

963
00:58:47,386 --> 00:58:51,896
I can't resist you any more.
You're so fetching in the morning.

964
00:58:52,037 --> 00:58:54,067
Paul said we have to go to the countryside.

965
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:57,617
You know? He said he's taking us
to this beautiful little inn for lunch.

966
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,907
But, I mean, if you don't want to go,
don't go.

967
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,027
I'm not missing it because of you.

968
00:59:18,819 --> 00:59:22,959
<i>Hello! Bonjour!</i>

969
00:59:23,709 --> 00:59:26,689
- Hello! I have a quick question for you about Rodin.
- Hello.

970
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:29,699
OK, now, I understand
he loved his wife

971
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,920
and he also loved his mistress.

972
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,620
- Yes.
- But do you think that's possible,

973
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,620
to love two women at once?

974
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:39,120
Well, he loved them both,
but in a different way.

975
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,090
You know...

976
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,470
That's very...
That's very French.

977
00:59:43,471 --> 00:59:46,291
You guys are way...
you know...much...

978
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,231
more evolved in that department
than we are.

979
00:59:49,231 --> 00:59:51,491
Do you remember me?
I was in the...

980
00:59:51,491 --> 00:59:53,761
- was in the group that...
- Yes!

981
00:59:53,772 --> 00:59:56,212
The group with the pedantic gentleman.

982
00:59:56,212 --> 01:00:00,302
Pedantic? Yes.
That's a perfect word.

983
01:00:08,793 --> 01:00:12,003
Here is ... his photo.

984
01:00:12,003 --> 01:00:14,093
I want to know where
he goes each night.

985
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:16,953
What is your suspicion? Hm?

986
01:00:17,003 --> 01:00:18,503
He's engaged to my daughter.

987
01:00:18,504 --> 01:00:21,544
To marry. I want to make sure
that she's making the right decision.

988
01:00:21,544 --> 01:00:23,924
Naturally, discretion is paramount.

989
01:00:24,044 --> 01:00:26,384
<i>Well, you've come to the
right place, Monsieur.</i>

990
01:00:26,424 --> 01:00:30,494
Monsieur Tisserant will personally
keep track of the gentleman,

991
01:00:30,534 --> 01:00:33,584
and report about his whereabouts at night.

992
01:00:53,906 --> 01:00:55,756
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

993
01:00:55,757 --> 01:00:58,627
Hey! Thank you for stopping.

994
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:01,747
- Gil Pender.
- Tom Eliot.

995
01:01:01,747 --> 01:01:05,107
Tom Eliot?
Tom Stearns Eliot?

996
01:01:05,107 --> 01:01:08,447
T.S Eliot? T.S. Eliot?

997
01:01:09,038 --> 01:01:11,928
<i>- Pender.
- Prufrock's like my mantra!</i>

998
01:01:11,928 --> 01:01:13,928
OK. Sorry. Sorry.

999
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,549
Listen. Where I come from,

1000
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:27,239
people measure out their lives
with coke spoons.

1001
01:01:27,409 --> 01:01:29,949
- Hello? Ms. Stein?
- Oh, Pender.

1002
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:32,029
I'll get to your book in a moment.
I finished it.

1003
01:01:32,029 --> 01:01:34,349
We're just in the middle
of a little personal crisis.

1004
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:36,950
Oh, OK. Should I come back?
I don't want to interrupt.

1005
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,010
No, it's no secret.

1006
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:42,460
Adriana has left Pablo,
and has flown to Africa with Hemingway.

1007
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,230
<i>SabÃ­a que tenÃ­a obsesiÃ³n con este fanfarrÃ³n!
(I knew that I had an obsession with that bully!)</i>

1008
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:46,791
<i>Ya hemos hablado de todo esto!
(We talked about all this!)</i>

1009
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:50,411
<i>Estoy segura de que ella regresarÃ¡ muy devoto.
(I'm sure that she'll come back very devoted.)</i>

1010
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:53,871
<i>Muy devoto. Oh, he took her hunting kudu,
but she'll be back to him.</i>

1011
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:58,821
The sound of hyenas in your ears at night when
you're trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy.

1012
01:01:58,822 --> 01:02:01,202
Mount Kilimanjaro is not Paris.

1013
01:02:01,302 --> 01:02:04,632
- What are you saying, that he took her to Mount Kilimanjaro?
- Now, about your book,

1014
01:02:04,942 --> 01:02:06,642
it's very unusual, indeed.

1015
01:02:06,642 --> 01:02:10,292
I mean, in a way, it's almost like science fiction.

1016
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:14,033
We all fear death,
and question our place in the universe.

1017
01:02:14,033 --> 01:02:17,373
The artist's job is not to succumb to despair,

1018
01:02:17,373 --> 01:02:21,113
but to find an antidote for
the emptiness of existence.

1019
01:02:21,303 --> 01:02:25,723
You have a clear and lively voice.
Don't be such a defeatist.

1020
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:32,694
Tell Gil to bring his suit, 'cause we're
going to be dining formal tomorrow night.

1021
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:36,574
I forgot to tell you, actually.
Gil isn't coming to Mont Saint-Michel.

1022
01:02:36,575 --> 01:02:39,335
Why not?
I don't understand it!

1023
01:02:39,335 --> 01:02:41,355
Because, he writes.
He rewrites.

1024
01:02:41,355 --> 01:02:43,265
He rewrites the rewrites, you know?

1025
01:02:43,265 --> 01:02:45,125
He says, "Picasso never left his studio."

1026
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:48,045
I said, "Gil, you have absolutely
nothing in common with Picasso."

1027
01:02:48,046 --> 01:02:49,766
He just looks at me.

1028
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,006
Well, he's gonna miss a great weekend.

Yeah. You seem a bit young
to be so familiar with his work.

1042
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,980
It's because he wrote
many songs about Paris.

1043
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:49,500
Yeah. What was the story? It was like he was
in love with your hometown, or something.

Daddy had chest pains.

- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just indigestion.

- We can't take that chance.
- You know he had an angioplasty 3 years ago.

Yeah. Right.

01:07:16,387 --> 01:07:18,387
They put a balloon in me.
Big deal.

Gil, why are you so dressed up?

1086
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:29,078
Me? No, no, no, I'm not.
I've been writing.

Wh...You dress up and
put on cologne to write?

1089
01:07:34,109 --> 01:07:36,029
No, no. I jumped in the shower,

1090
01:07:36,029 --> 01:07:38,959
just for a second. You know
how I think better in the shower,

1091
01:07:38,959 --> 01:07:41,649
and I get the positive ions going in there?

1092
01:07:41,649 --> 01:07:43,359
So, we were halfway to Mont Saint-Michel

1093
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,769
when Daddy just...
he went pale as a ghost.

1094
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,960
- That's terrible!
- I mean, it was so scary, so we just

1095
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,460
- turned right around and came back.
- Yeah. You had to.

1096
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:54,320
John, is there anything I can get,
for your color to me looks

1097
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,770
- like it's OK, but I'm not a doctor.
- Naw, I'm fine.

1098
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:59,331
I'm sure it's the
beef bourguignon she made me have.

1099
01:07:59,331 --> 01:08:02,131
- What is that?
- Where?

1100

- That in your hand.
- Nothing.

01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:07,901

- I know. I know.

1102
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:10,731

- Yes.</i>

1104
01:08:11,942 --> 01:08:14,952
It's not...incredible....
It's from the flea market.

1105
01:08:14,952 --> 01:08:16,352
- Well, can I open it?
- No, no no,

1106
01:08:16,352 --> 01:08:20,942
That's what I'm saying.
Honey, it's for a special dinner

then I'm going to give it to you.

1108
01:08:23,373 --> 01:08:27,483
- Is it jewelry? I hope it's my taste, if it's jewelry, because...
- Well...

1109
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:31,013
- ...that moonstone necklace?
- But I thought you liked the moon?

1110
01:08:31,013 --> 01:08:33,963
Because it's understated, but elegant.

1111
01:08:33,964 --> 01:08:35,964
That's what you always say.

1112
01:08:35,964 --> 01:08:38,204
Cheap is cheap,
is what I always say.

1113
01:08:38,204 --> 01:08:39,794
Yeah. You didn't see this necklace.

1114
01:08:39,794 --> 01:08:43,654
I've never actually even worn it.
I'll show you. You'll see why immediately.

1115
01:08:43,784 --> 01:08:47,484
- Everybody's down on moonstone, all of a sudden.
- Well...

1116
01:08:47,495 --> 01:08:50,025
- they are...
- A little simple.

1117
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,555
I think... I thought
you loved their simplicity.

1118
01:08:52,555 --> 01:08:55,085
Yeah, that's the problem.
They're too simple.

1119
01:08:55,085 --> 01:08:57,935
Well, what do I know?
Too simple.

1120
01:08:59,316 --> 01:09:01,326
Where are my pearl earrings?

1121
01:09:03,246 --> 01:09:05,146
Did...Did you bring them?

1122
01:09:05,146 --> 01:09:07,636
I don't even remember you packing them.

1123
01:09:07,636 --> 01:09:10,386
Yes, I did, because I've worn them here!

1124
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:12,887
No, you didn't.
Oh, they must've fallen out!

1125
01:09:12,887 --> 01:09:15,477
Both of them?
Gil, my ears are pierced.

1126
01:09:15,477 --> 01:09:18,657
Inez, I told you to keep
everything in the hotel safe!

1127
01:09:18,747 --> 01:09:21,127
- Do you think it was the maid?
- It's always the maid.

1128
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:23,127
I...I know I saw them
here this morning.

1129

Well, I would report the theft right away.

1130
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:27,948
You know, she was so snotty
yesterday when I asked her...

1131
01:09:27,948 --> 01:09:30,258
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not
jump to any conclusions, OK?

1132
01:09:30,258 --> 01:09:33,518
- You don't just level a charge of theft against somebody.
- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.

1133
01:09:33,518 --> 01:09:36,878
- Shh, Inez, no!
- Could you call the house detective?

1134
01:09:36,879 --> 01:09:39,279
- Send him up. Thank you.
- This is turning into a witch hunt!

1135
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,139
You don't do this to people!

1136
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:42,779
Yes, you do,
if they've stolen.

1137
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,439
I didn't like that maid.
I didn't like her from the beginning.

1138
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,009
She was sweet. She was pleasant.
She was upbeat!

1139
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,710
You always take the
side of the help, as usual!

1140
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:53,380
That's why Daddy says you're a communist.

1141
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,980
<i>Bon soir. (Good evening.)
I'm Doctor GÃ©rard.</i>

1142
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:59,310
- Do you want some more water?
- I'm fine.

1143
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:04,831
- He's had angioplasty.
- I didn't need it.

1144
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:10,231
Look! Are these them?

1145
01:10:10,231 --> 01:10:12,231
I don't know.

1146
01:10:12,232 --> 01:10:15,662
- Where did you find them?
- They were just in the bathroom.

1147
01:10:15,662 --> 01:10:17,662
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah. On the sink.

1148
01:10:19,102 --> 01:10:20,992
What the hell were they
doing in the bathroom?

1149
01:10:20,992 --> 01:10:23,052
I don't know.
They were just...

1150
01:10:23,872 --> 01:10:26,462
But maybe you dropped them, and

1151
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:30,653
when you were putting them away,
and the housekeeper must've picked them up.

1152
01:10:30,653 --> 01:10:33,413
and placed them there, out in
the open where we could see them easily.

1153
01:10:33,413 --> 01:10:35,413
That was really thoughtful of her.

1154
01:10:35,413 --> 01:10:37,323
I didn't drop them.
I wouldn't drop them.

1155
01:10:37,324 --> 01:10:39,324
The important thing is
they're not stolen.

1156
01:11:06,636 --> 01:11:09,226
<i>C'est l'un de vos meilleurs, jusqu'au prÃ©sent.
(It's one of your best, until now.)</i>

1157
01:11:09,236 --> 01:11:11,886
<i>J'ai parlÃ© Ã  Leo. Je pense qu'il va l'acheter
(I talked to Leo. I think that he'll buy it.)</i>

1158
01:11:11,886 --> 01:11:14,166
Oh, Pender!
I was just telling Matisse

1159
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:17,527
we're going to buy one of his
paintings for our personal collection.

1160
01:11:17,557 --> 01:11:19,927
I think 500 Francs is fair.

1161
01:11:20,107 --> 01:11:22,367
500 Francs for a Matisse?

1162
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,157
Yeah, I think that sounds fair.

1163
01:11:24,157 --> 01:11:26,797
You know, I was wondering if
maybe I could pick up 6 or 7.

1164
01:11:26,798 --> 01:11:28,628
- What have we got here?
- Yeah. Oh.

1165
01:11:28,628 --> 01:11:31,548
OK, now, I've brought a rewrite over
of the first few chapters of my book,

1166
01:11:31,568 --> 01:11:35,948
and if you could just tell me if I'm
heading in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

1167
01:11:35,948 --> 01:11:37,808
- Leave it with me.
- OK. Great.

1168
01:11:37,808 --> 01:11:39,768
and have you heard from Hemingway?

1169
01:11:39,769 --> 01:11:42,169
Oh, they've been back for days, now.

1170
01:11:42,169 --> 01:11:45,409
The trip didn't work out.
I knew they wouldn't hit it off.

1171
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:47,409
It's over. With Picasso, too.

1172
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:49,999
She's at Deyrolle, by herself.

1173
01:11:49,999 --> 01:11:50,889
By herself?

1174
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,880
Oh, one of those crazy
Surrealist painters is getting married.

1175
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,720
They're doing it up there.

1176
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,070
She'll be glad to see you.

1177
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:03,090
<i>Eh bien, mes chers amies, je propose de porter un toast...
(Well, my dear friends, I propose to raise a toast to...)</i>

1178
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:34,973
Oh. What are you doing here?

1179
01:12:34,973 --> 01:12:36,973
I came to find you.

1180
01:12:36,973 --> 01:12:41,083
- You did?
- Yeah. Maybe this is coming out of left field, but

1181
01:12:41,084 --> 01:12:44,904
let's just say, as a writer,
I'm pretty good at

1182
01:12:44,904 --> 01:12:48,744
picking up on vibrations from people-
women in particular.

1183
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:53,404
I sense that there are
some complicated feelings, maybe,

1184
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:56,285
that you have for me.

1185
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:58,455
Aren't you gonna get married?

1186
01:12:58,455 --> 01:13:01,335
Well, everything's a little
up in the air right now.

1187
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,165
I don't know what is gonna happen.

1188
01:13:04,325 --> 01:13:07,625
Is there some place that we
can talk? Maybe more quiet?

1189
01:13:07,626 --> 01:13:10,296
- Sure.
- Come on.

1190
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:12,706
Oh, Mr. BuÃ±uel!

1191
01:13:12,706 --> 01:13:15,196
I had a nice idea
for a movie for you.

1192
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,636
- Yes?
- A group of people attend a

1193
01:13:17,637 --> 01:13:23,217
very formal dinner party. At the end of dinner,
when they try to leave the room, they can't.

1194
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:25,377
Why not?

1195
01:13:25,377 --> 01:13:28,837
They just can't seem to exit the door.

1196
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,478
<i>- B...But why?
- Well, momento,</i>

1197
01:13:32,478 --> 01:13:35,658
when they're forced to stay together,
the veneer of civilization

1198
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:39,398
quickly fades away,
and what you're left with is

1199
01:13:39,398 --> 01:13:42,488
who they really are:  animals.

1200
01:13:43,229 --> 01:13:44,279
But I don't get it.

1201
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:46,279
Why don't they just
walk out of the room?

1202
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:47,789
All I'm saying is just think about.
Who knows?

1203
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:51,459
Maybe when you're shaving one day,
it'll tickle your fancy.

1204
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:55,469
I don't understand.
What's holding them in the room?

1205
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,863
What are you doing?

1206
01:14:37,203 --> 01:14:39,653
I don't know!

1207
01:14:47,124 --> 01:14:49,424
I did feel,
for a minute there,

1208
01:14:49,424 --> 01:14:53,554
while I was doing it, like I was immortal.

1209
01:14:54,294 --> 01:14:56,114
But you look so sad.

1210
01:14:56,115 --> 01:14:59,465
Because life is too mysterious.

1211
01:14:59,465 --> 01:15:01,985
This is the time we live in.

1212
01:15:02,355 --> 01:15:04,945
Everything moves so fast.

1213
01:15:05,165 --> 01:15:08,915
Life is noisy and complicated.

1214
01:15:09,636 --> 01:15:12,616
I've always been a logical person.
I've never

1215
01:15:12,616 --> 01:15:14,266
I never acted too crazy.

1216
01:15:14,266 --> 01:15:17,766
I didn't stay here.
When I first came out here,

1217
01:15:17,766 --> 01:15:21,826
I didn't take a real shot at being a writer.

1218
01:15:21,827 --> 01:15:25,747
I'd just, kind of, be a hired Hollywood hand.

1219
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:28,927
Don't laugh. I just want to...

1220
01:15:28,927 --> 01:15:32,047
I feel like I just want to let it go.

1221
01:15:32,607 --> 01:15:35,497
- Here.
- Oh!

1222
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:43,718
Oh! This is...
This is remarkable!

1223
01:15:43,718 --> 01:15:46,148
Go on. Here, put in on.

1224
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:48,149
They're so beautiful!

1225
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:56,769
Look!

1226
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:04,350
<i>Monsieur, Mademoiselle, on y va!
(Sir, Miss, away we go!)</i>

1227
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:08,460
<i>- Qui est vous? (Who are you?)
- Allez monter. Nous allons trop tard. (Come up. We're too late)</i>

1228
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:11,730
<i>- Allez!
- Come on! Come on!</i>

1229
01:16:28,932 --> 01:16:31,972
<i>Oh, mon Dieu,
this is so beautiful!</i>

1230
01:16:32,202 --> 01:16:35,752
It's unbelievable!
All the pictures I've seen...

1231
01:16:35,753 --> 01:16:37,753
<i>Here it is: La Belle Ãpoque!</i>

1232
01:16:37,753 --> 01:16:41,383
Wow! I don't know
what it is about this city!

1233
01:16:41,383 --> 01:16:45,673
It's like, I've got to write a note
to the Chamber of Commerce.

1234
01:16:49,644 --> 01:16:51,604
<i>Bon soir!
(Good evening!)</i>

1235
01:16:52,294 --> 01:16:54,844
<i>Bon soir! Bienvenue.
(Good evening! Welcome.)</i>

1236
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:56,844
Thank you.

1237
01:16:56,994 --> 01:16:59,874
<i>Oh, mon Dieu! Quelle robe magnifique!
(Oh, my God! What a magnificent dress!)</i>

1238
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:01,675
<i>Tellement avant-garde!
(So ahead of the time!)</i>

1239
01:17:03,355 --> 01:17:07,825
<i>S'il vous plaÃ®t, prenez un boire du champagne. C'est la fÃªte!
(Please, have a drink of champagne. It's a party!)</i>

1240
01:17:08,705 --> 01:17:10,305
<i>Champagne.</i>

1241
01:17:38,728 --> 01:17:42,958
Isn't it amazing? The first time we met,
I told you about this place,

1242
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,958
<i>and the Belle Ãpoque,</i>

1243
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,958
and here we are!

1244
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:50,018
I don't know why,
but I have this feeling that...

1245
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:52,019
I don't know, like I can't...

1246
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:54,629
believe my luck.

1247
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:58,449
Well, I can. I know exactly where I want to go next.

1248
01:17:58,449 --> 01:18:00,449
You lead the way.

1249
01:18:38,823 --> 01:18:40,253
Look!

1250
01:18:42,003 --> 01:18:44,003
Oh, my God!

1251
01:18:44,163 --> 01:18:46,833
Pablo admires him so much!

1252
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:48,913
- I have to say hello.
- No, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

1253
01:18:48,913 --> 01:18:50,713
- Come with me! I'm nervous.
- Really? OK.

1254
01:18:50,713 --> 01:18:53,103
But, we know he's a lonely man.

1255
01:18:53,444 --> 01:18:57,224
- I'm sure he would love some company.
- OK, let's go.

1256
01:18:59,564 --> 01:19:00,944
Monsieur Lautrec?

1257
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:04,224
<i>- Oui? (Yes?)
- Bon soir. Nous sommes de grands amateurs.(Good evening. We are great fans.)</i>

1258
01:19:04,265 --> 01:19:07,645
<i>- Merci, Madame. (Thank you, Madame.)
- Pouvons-nous vous offrir un verre? (May we offer you a drink?)</i>

1259
01:19:07,645 --> 01:19:11,355
<i>Je serais enchantÃ©e. Prenez un siÃ¨ge.
(I would be delighted. Have a seat.)</i>

1260
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:13,355
He's asking us to sit down with him.

1261
01:19:13,355 --> 01:19:16,865
This much French I do
understand, and the gesture.

1262
01:19:16,866 --> 01:19:18,066
<i>Vous Ãªtes Americain?
(You are American?)</i>

1263
01:19:18,066 --> 01:19:19,566
Yes, I'm an American.

1264
01:19:19,566 --> 01:19:22,896
<i>Je vous devine Ã  l'accent.(I could tell from the accent.)
- Yeah. Oui. Oui.</i>

1265
01:19:22,896 --> 01:19:26,346
<i>Vos dessins! Votre attention! Nous admirons tout que vous faites.
(Your drawings! Your attention! We admire everything that you do.)</i>

1266
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:28,806
<i>- I love your drawings, also.
- Bon soir!
- Merci.</i>

1267
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:35,257
<i>Savez que moi je prÃ©senter Monsieur Gauginand Monsieur Degas.
(May I present Mr. Gaugin and Mr. Degas.)</i>

1268
01:19:35,257 --> 01:19:38,117
- Bon soir.
- EnchantÃ©e.
- Bon soir. EnchantÃ©e.

1269
01:19:38,687 --> 01:19:42,837
- Paul Gaugin.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1270
01:19:42,838 --> 01:19:45,858
See the sketch he's made?
Nobody can draw like this today.

1271
01:19:45,858 --> 01:19:47,858
Not Picasso. Not Matisse.

1272
01:19:47,858 --> 01:19:50,228
<i>Unbelievable. Parlez-vous anglais?</i>

1273
01:19:50,228 --> 01:19:52,228
<i>- Non, monsieur. (No, sir.)
- Il parle un petit peu.(He speaks a little.)</i>

1274
01:19:52,248 --> 01:19:56,368
<i>Non, non. I speak well. Parle trÃ¨s bien. Bien oui. Tu veut voir? 
(No, no. I speak very well. Absolutely. You want to see?)</i>

1275
01:19:56,369 --> 01:19:59,939
Degas and I were just
talking about how this...

1276
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:05,369
<i>um...this...cette...gÃ©nÃ©ration est plus vide, et il manque d'imagination.
(...this generation is empty, and is missing imagination.)</i>

1277
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,730
He said...He says that

1278
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:12,120
this generation is empty,
and has no imagination.

1279
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:16,360
<i>Better to have lived during the...
la Renaissance.</i>

1280
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:19,490
No! This is the golden age.

1281
01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:21,051
<i>- Non.
- C'est l'Ã¢ge d'or!(It's the golden age!)</i>

1282
01:20:21,051 --> 01:20:23,981
<i>Pas de tout. La Renaissance, c'est beaucoup mieux.
(Not at all. The Renaissance is much better.)</i>

1283
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:27,141
<i>Qu'est-ce que vous faites dans la vie?
(What is it you do?)</i>

1284
01:20:27,141 --> 01:20:29,661
<i>J'Ã©tudie la haute-couture.
(I study high fashion.)</i>

1285
01:20:29,661 --> 01:20:31,901
<i>C'est pour Ã§a vous Ãªtes ****(That's why you're dressed like that.)</i>

1286
01:20:33,472 --> 01:20:35,412
<i>Je comprends maintenant!
(I understand now!)</i>

1287
01:20:35,412 --> 01:20:37,412
<i>Les vÃªtements tres jeune.
(The youthful clothes.)</i>

1288
01:20:38,052 --> 01:20:40,692
<i>Voulez vous de lui prÃ©senter Ã  Richard?
(Would you introduce her to Richard?)</i>

1289
01:20:40,692 --> 01:20:45,172
<i>- Ah, oui! (Oh, yes!)
- Ah, oui. He wants to have you meet his friend Richard.</i>

1290
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:48,673
He's looking for someone
to do costumes for the new ballet.

1291
01:20:48,673 --> 01:20:50,223
<i>So, vous intÃ©resse?
(So, you're interested?)</i>

1292
01:20:50,223 --> 01:20:52,223
- Ballet costumes?
- Yes.

1293
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:54,033
Oh my God! I...

1294
01:20:54,033 --> 01:20:56,133
I don't live here.

1295
01:20:56,134 --> 01:20:57,944
I mean, I do, but I don't. I...

1296
01:20:57,944 --> 01:21:00,084
It's best not to go
into too many details. We're...

1297
01:21:00,164 --> 01:21:03,054
We're temporarily
passing through.

1298
01:21:04,344 --> 01:21:06,824
Can I speak with you a minute?

1299
01:21:08,825 --> 01:21:10,825
<i>PermitÃ©e?
(May I?)</i>

1300
01:21:11,905 --> 01:21:13,665
<i>EnchantÃ©..</i>

1301
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:18,035
Wow, it didn't take
Gaugin long to start steaming in.

1302
01:21:18,035 --> 01:21:20,195
Let's never go back to the '20s!

1303
01:21:20,196 --> 01:21:22,196
- What are you talking about?
- We should stay here.

1304
01:21:22,196 --> 01:21:24,766
It's the start of La Belle Ãpoque!

1305
01:21:24,776 --> 01:21:29,556
It's the greatest, most
beautiful era Paris has ever known.

1306
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:33,516
Yeah, but about the '20s,
and the Charleston,

1307
01:21:33,517 --> 01:21:35,517
and the Fitzgeralds,
and the Hemingways?

1308
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:37,857
I mean, I love those guys.

1309
01:21:38,137 --> 01:21:41,897
But it's the present.
It's dull.

1310
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,227
Dull?

1311
01:21:44,578 --> 01:21:46,608
It's not my present.

1312
01:21:46,608 --> 01:21:48,948
I'm from 2010.

1313
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,488
What do you mean?

1314
01:21:53,488 --> 01:21:57,908
I dropped in on you the same way
we're dropping in on the 1890s.

1315
01:21:59,019 --> 01:22:00,299
You did?

1316
01:22:00,299 --> 01:22:03,759
I was trying to escape my present
the same way you're trying to escape yours,

1317
01:22:03,759 --> 01:22:05,919
to a golden age.

1318
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:10,909
Surely you don't think
the '20s are a golden age!

1319
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:13,360
Well, yeah. To me they are.

1320
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,710
But I'm from the '20s, and I'm
telling you the golden age is La Belle Ãpoque.

1321
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:23,130
And look at these guys. I mean, to them,
their golden age was the Renaissance.

1322
01:22:23,131 --> 01:22:27,591
<i>You know, they're trade Belle Ãpoque
to be painting alongside</i>

1323
01:22:27,591 --> 01:22:29,371
Titian and Michelango.

1324
01:22:29,371 --> 01:22:31,401
And those guys probably imagined

1325
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:34,441
life was a lot better
when Kublai Khan was around.

1326
01:22:34,442 --> 01:22:38,272
You see, I'm having an insight right now.
It's a minor one, but

1327
01:22:38,272 --> 01:22:41,612
it explains the anxiety in my dream that I had.

1328
01:22:41,612 --> 01:22:44,222
- What dream?
- I had a dream the other night, where

1329
01:22:44,222 --> 01:22:46,912
it was like a nightmare,
where I ran out of Zithromax.

1330
01:22:46,913 --> 01:22:50,123
And then I went to the dentist,
and he didn't have any Novocaine.

1331
01:22:50,123 --> 01:22:52,123
You see what I'm saying?

1332
01:22:52,123 --> 01:22:55,693
These people don't have any antibiotics.

1333
01:22:55,693 --> 01:22:57,953
What are you talking about?

1334
01:22:57,953 --> 01:23:01,243
Adriana, if you stay here,
and this becomes your present,

1335
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:06,364
then, pretty soon, you'll start
imagining another time was really your,

1336
01:23:06,364 --> 01:23:08,754
you know, was really the golden time.

1337
01:23:08,754 --> 01:23:11,004
That's what the present is.

1338
01:23:11,005 --> 01:23:15,725
That it's a little unsatisfying,
because life's a little unsatisfying.

1339
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:18,845
That's the problem with writers.

1340
01:23:18,845 --> 01:23:21,415
You are so full of words.

1341
01:23:21,415 --> 01:23:24,115
But I am more emotional,

1342
01:23:24,116 --> 01:23:25,786
and I'm going stay,

1343
01:23:25,786 --> 01:23:29,816
and live in Paris' most glorious time.

1344
01:23:30,316 --> 01:23:33,866
You made a choice to leave
Paris once, and you regretted it.

1345
01:23:33,866 --> 01:23:36,316
Yeah, I did regret it.
It was a bad decision,

1346
01:23:36,317 --> 01:23:37,657
but at least it was a choice.

1347
01:23:37,657 --> 01:23:41,297
I mean, it was a real choice.
This way, I think, is,

1348
01:23:41,297 --> 01:23:43,917
I don't know, crazy.
It doesn't really work.

1349
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:47,887
If I ever want to write
something worthwhile, I have to,

1350
01:23:47,888 --> 01:23:51,018
you know, get rid of my
illusions, and then I'd be

1351
01:23:51,018 --> 01:23:54,538
happier in the past,
as where I want a home.

1352
01:23:56,038 --> 01:23:57,478
So...

1353
01:23:58,128 --> 01:24:00,448
Goodbye, Gil?

1354
01:24:11,069 --> 01:24:13,369
Goodbye.

1355
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,460
Pender, I read your rewrite,
and you're nicely on the right track.

1356
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,180
You understood me clearly.

1357
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,270
If the rest of the book
reads as well when you're done,

1358
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:25,830
- you'll have something of value.
- That is the best news!

1359
01:24:25,831 --> 01:24:28,221
I really did listen to you,
so I'm happy to hear that it

1360
01:24:28,491 --> 01:24:30,811
You know, it seems like I'm
moving forward.

1361
01:24:30,811 --> 01:24:32,591
I mean, it just means
the world to me that you

1362
01:24:32,591 --> 01:24:34,711
- Hemingway read the chapters, too, and he thinks...
- He read it?

1363
01:24:34,711 --> 01:24:36,711
...he thinks it's going to be a fine book.

1364
01:24:36,711 --> 01:24:38,801
but he did have one plot suggestion.

1365
01:24:38,802 --> 01:24:40,032
What's the suggestion?

1366
01:24:40,032 --> 01:24:41,982
Well, he doesn't quite believe
that the protagonist

1367
01:24:42,002 --> 01:24:46,472
doesn't see that his fiancÃ©e is
having an affair right before his eyes.

1368
01:24:46,692 --> 01:24:50,002
- With?
- The other character. The pedantic one.

1369
01:24:55,843 --> 01:24:58,353
That's called denial.

1370
01:24:58,353 --> 01:25:00,353
Thank you.

1371
01:25:01,033 --> 01:25:02,593
You're crazy!

1372
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:04,594
Paul and I?

1373
01:25:04,594 --> 01:25:07,334
Where did you get such an insane notion?

1374
01:25:07,334 --> 01:25:09,334
Where? From Ernest Hemingway.

1375
01:25:09,334 --> 01:25:12,174
He figured it out, and, guess what,
it makes perfect sense.

1376
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:14,254
Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again.

1377
01:25:14,255 --> 01:25:16,705
- No. No!
- There's nothing crazy about Hemingway,

1378
01:25:16,705 --> 01:25:19,655
or Fitzgerald, or Gertrude Stein,
or Salvador DalÃ­!

1379
01:25:19,655 --> 01:25:22,135
Yeah, except that they've been dead for years!

1380
01:25:22,135 --> 01:25:24,065
No, no. The past is not dead.

1381
01:25:24,065 --> 01:25:26,785
Actually, it's not even past.
You know who said that?

1382
01:25:26,786 --> 01:25:28,936
Faulkner. And he was right.
And I met him, too.

1383
01:25:28,936 --> 01:25:30,456
I ran into him at a dinner party.

1384
01:25:30,456 --> 01:25:32,236
- You're a raving lunatic!
- No, I'm not.

1385
01:25:32,236 --> 01:25:34,556
- Yes, you are.
- No. I'm too trusting.

1386
01:25:34,556 --> 01:25:36,556
I'm jealous,
and I'm trusting.

1387
01:25:36,556 --> 01:25:38,136
It's cognitive dissonance.

1388
01:25:38,136 --> 01:25:39,376
- Scott Fitzgerald talked about it.
- Gil. Gil.

1389
01:25:39,377 --> 01:25:42,237
Inez, you can fool me,
but you cannot fool Hemingway.

1390
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:45,087
- I know.
- Jesus Christ, I'm dealing with a madman here.

1391
01:25:45,087 --> 01:25:47,577
OK. Yes! I did.

1392
01:25:47,577 --> 01:25:50,167
I was with Paul for a few nights,

1393
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:53,437
because he's romantic,
and he speaks French,

1394
01:25:53,438 --> 01:25:57,988
and you were always working, and maybe it's
the mystique of this corny city, but...

1395
01:25:57,988 --> 01:25:59,988
get over it, Gil.

1396
01:26:00,908 --> 01:26:03,228
You just put this in perspective
when we get home.

1397
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:07,099
I'm not...I'm not going back.

1398
01:26:07,689 --> 01:26:11,269
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm staying here, and it has nothing to do with,

1399
01:26:11,289 --> 01:26:13,879
you know, your romantic fling;
Paris is Paris.

1400
01:26:13,879 --> 01:26:16,219
Inez, you and I, it's obvious we're not...

1401
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:18,710
I don't think we're right for each other.

1402
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,940
What?

1403
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:23,950
What are you saying?

1404
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:26,670
What are you even talking about?

1405
01:26:29,021 --> 01:26:31,231
- You ready to go swimming?
- Hi!

1406
01:26:31,231 --> 01:26:32,851
We're breaking up.

1407
01:26:32,851 --> 01:26:35,061
- What?
- Yeah. Gil's moving to Paris.

1408
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:37,061
- I knew it. I told you.
- What's going on?

1409
01:26:37,061 --> 01:26:39,781
No, no, I'm going to stay in Paris, but

1410
01:26:39,781 --> 01:26:41,301
just because we're...

1411
01:26:41,302 --> 01:26:44,092
If I'm unhappy, I'll move back.
But for the time being, yes.

1412
01:26:44,092 --> 01:26:46,722
W...W...With who?...
With who, Gil?

1413
01:26:46,722 --> 01:26:49,572
- No one, I...
- One of your crazy hallucinatory friends?

1414
01:26:49,602 --> 01:26:51,572
I mean, Mom's right about you.

1415
01:26:51,572 --> 01:26:53,462
You have this part missing.

1416
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:54,843
Yeah, I said that first.

1417
01:26:54,843 --> 01:26:57,143
Anyone whose protagonist
makes a living

1418
01:26:57,143 --> 01:27:00,503
selling old cap pistols
and Joan Crawford cutout books...

1419
01:27:00,503 --> 01:27:03,183
- Honestly...
- Look, I'm not trying to be

1420
01:27:03,183 --> 01:27:05,963
a martyr, but I think
you'll be better off without me.

1421
01:27:05,964 --> 01:27:08,624
- I really do.
- But we would!

1422
01:27:08,624 --> 01:27:11,754
- I can't believe you're moving.
- Go ahead. Go ahead!

1423
01:27:11,754 --> 01:27:17,074
Walk the streets. Gush over the
Parisian light and the rooftops.

1424
01:27:17,074 --> 01:27:19,074
Goodbye, Inez.

1425
01:27:19,725 --> 01:27:22,065
- Say hi to Trotsky.
- Yeah.

1426
01:27:23,385 --> 01:27:26,905
- Unbelievable!
- You know, I had...

1427
01:27:26,905 --> 01:27:30,835
a private detective follow him.
I knew he was up to no good.

1428
01:27:30,836 --> 01:27:32,996
- You did?
- You bet I did.

1429
01:27:32,996 --> 01:27:35,016
He saw him get into a car
at midnight every night,

1430
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:37,016
and he followed him very closely.

1431
01:27:37,296 --> 01:27:40,326
- And what happened?
- I don't know.

1432
01:27:40,326 --> 01:27:44,426
The detective agency says
the detective is missing.

1433
01:27:45,487 --> 01:27:46,747
<i>Ã qui dois-je l'honneur?
(To whom do I owe the honor?)</i>

1434
01:27:46,747 --> 01:27:49,217
<i>Je...Je suis perdu.
(I...I'm lost.)</i>

1435
01:27:49,217 --> 01:27:51,217
<i>J'ai detournÃ©e la mauvaise endroit.
(I made a wrong turn.)</i>

1436
01:27:51,217 --> 01:27:54,397
<i>Gardes! Gardes!
(Guards! Guards!)</i>

1437
01:27:54,758 --> 01:27:56,398
<i>Lui coupe la tÃªte!
(Off with his head!)</i>

1438
01:27:56,608 --> 01:27:58,398
<i>Lui coupe la tÃªte!
(Off with his head!)</i>

1439
01:29:05,413 --> 01:29:08,343
- Hey! Hi!
- Hey!

1440
01:29:09,524 --> 01:29:11,964
Wow! What...

1441
01:29:12,894 --> 01:29:15,094
Good to see you.

1442
01:29:15,094 --> 01:29:17,174
What are you doing here?

1443
01:29:17,174 --> 01:29:19,344
I'm returning from dinner with friends.

1444
01:29:19,344 --> 01:29:21,344
- Oh. OK.
- I live here.

1445
01:29:21,345 --> 01:29:24,405
And you? What are you doing here?

1446
01:29:24,925 --> 01:29:26,795
I was just out for a walk.

1447
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:30,075
Yeah, I'm actually...I decided.
I'm moving to Paris.

1448
01:29:30,075 --> 01:29:33,685
- Really? Wow. I'm sure you will love it.
- Yeah.

1449
01:29:33,686 --> 01:29:36,586
- Yeah. You think so?
- Yeah.

1450
01:29:36,726 --> 01:29:38,926
You know, I thought about
you the other day.

1451
01:29:38,926 --> 01:29:40,716
- Really?
- Yeah, because

1452
01:29:40,716 --> 01:29:44,466
my boss got a whole
new album of Cole Porter songs.

1453
01:29:44,466 --> 01:29:46,766
That made you think about me?

1454
01:29:46,847 --> 01:29:49,737
I like to be thought of that way.

1455
01:29:49,737 --> 01:29:53,977
You're on your way home right now?

1456
01:29:54,517 --> 01:29:55,977
Yes.

1457
01:29:55,977 --> 01:30:00,197
Can I walk with you,
or, I'll buy you a cup of coffee?

1458
01:30:00,198 --> 01:30:03,208
Oh, OK, now it's starting to rain.

1459
01:30:04,348 --> 01:30:08,108
No, but that's OK.
I don't mind getting wet.

1460
01:30:08,668 --> 01:30:11,198
- Really?
- Yeah.

1461
01:30:11,519 --> 01:30:15,809
Actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.

1462
01:30:15,839 --> 01:30:18,149
I feel that's what
I'm always saying.

1463
01:30:18,149 --> 01:30:20,699
I couldn't agree more with you.

1464
01:30:20,699 --> 01:30:24,009
Yes, it is more beautiful.

1465
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:26,810
By the way, my name is Gabrielle.

1466
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:29,160
- Gil.
- Nice to meet you.

1467
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:32,230
That's a pretty name.
