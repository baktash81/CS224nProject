1
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:51,466
Mommy!

2
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,970
Bad dreams?

3
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:59,928
- Mommy.
- All over, come on here.

4
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,519
He's in my closet,
something's in my closet.

5
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:07,565
Oh, too much junk food.
Too much of the tube, guys.

6
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,823
He's in there.

7
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,234
Tad, now there's nothing in this house
that's going to hurt you.

8
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:14,697
Now, look what I see in the closet here.

9
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:18,576
All right, I see clothing,
I see a pile of blankets on a chair,

10
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:20,783
a lot of toys that weren't put away,

11
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:24,997
and your favorite
over-the-hill teddy bear

12
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,455
who would probably be a lot happier...

13
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:34,343
Who would probably be a lot happier
in bed with you.

14
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:36,797
And that's it, nothing else.

15
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:40,266
I saw him, really. He's in the closet.

16
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,976
He has yellow eyes,
and his mouth is about this long,

17
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:48,523
and he has teeth
and they're curled like this,

18
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:50,645
and he made sounds.

19
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,571
What kind of sounds?

20
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,699
What kind of sounds?

21
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,660
Come on, try. What kind of sounds?
Like what?

22
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,457
Yeah, that'd scare me pretty good.

23
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:09,336
- Really.
- But he's all gone now, champ, see?

24
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,539
He's in there, I saw him.

25
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:13,419
Really.

26
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,001
Tad, you saw him in your dreams,
in your head, nowhere else.

27
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,548
See, Tad, there aren't any real...

28
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,464
Tad, listen to me,
there's no such thing as real monsters.

29
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,224
Only in stories.

30
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,843
There's no real monsters, though.

31
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,307
- Really?
- Really.

32
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,888
Really.

33
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,236
Okay, over, done with, gone, right?

34
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:37,154
Over, done with, gone.

35
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,483
Okay, snuggle in.

36
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:45,076
Night, night, sleep tight,
don't let the bedbugs bite.

37
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,663
You have good dreams, little man.

38
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:59,338
There aren't any monsters, Tad.

39
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,602
Except for the one in my closet.

40
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,067
Please.

41
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:21,529
Please, please.

42
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,888
Hey, Tadder.

43
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:52,305
You know, it looks like
someone was moving furniture around

44
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:56,515
up in your bedroom last night?
Any idea on who that might have been?

45
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:57,929
No.

46
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,647
- Do you know, Donna?
- Wasn't me.

47
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:04,146
Wasn't me, neither.

48
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:05,733
Wasn't me.

49
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,692
Yeah, come on in, Steve.

50
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,649
Morning.

51
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:14,446
- Mrs. Trenton.
- Morning.

52
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,708
Here you go, Tadpole.

53
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,325
Just like I promised,
brought your horse back.

54
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:23,546
- Looks pretty good stripped, doesn't it?
- Do we have a cheque for him?

55
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:27,623
Listen, why don't you just wait
until I bring your table back?

56
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:29,793
Thanks.

57
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:33,598
Well, I can't stay
for a cup of coffee anyway.

58
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,175
Sorry, would you like a cup?

59
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,424
Just teasing.

60
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,021
Hey, Tad, maybe it was Mr. Kemp who
moved all your furniture around, huh?

61
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,642
Okay.

62
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,933
What did I do now, huh?

63
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:49,188
- No, the monster did it.
- The monster?

64
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,943
Oh, now come on,
remember what I said.

65
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,826
"There aren't no such things
as monsters."

66
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:57,622
There aren't any such things
as monsters.

67
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:59,870
Not in the daytime anyway.

68
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,746
Oh, come here, you.
"Not in the daytime."

69
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:05,537
I'll show you what a monster can do
in the daytime.

70
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,580
He grabs your knee...

71
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,087
<i>- I know a lot about cereals...
- Daddy, Daddy, look!</i>

72
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:14,135
<i>...because I'm the
Sharp Cereal Professor.</i>

73
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:19,679
<i>Sharp Cereals, Twinkles, Coco-Bears,
Bran 16...</i>

74
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,428
My daddy invented that.
He made him all up.

75
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:24,935
Who?

76
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:26,643
The Professor.

77
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:28,973
<i>And they're good for you.</i>

78
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:32,018
Well, your daddy's real smart, isn't he?

79
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,442
As well as being
a hell of a tennis player.

80
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:36,648
Ready for a rematch anytime you are.

81
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,906
- Sure, sure.
- Tadpole.

82
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:40,613
- Bye.
- Bye.

83
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:41,990
Thanks.

84
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,203
<i>No, nothing wrong here.</i>

85
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,843
That's game, set, and match.

86
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:57,343
- It was a good game.
- Oh, yeah.

87
00:10:57,469 --> 00:11:01,052
- What was the score, 6-0, 6-1?
- Yeah.

88
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:06,477
- You're not getting tired of this, are you?
- What, are you kidding me?

89
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:08,513
Getting my ass handed to me
every week? No, I love it.

90
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,023
I'm a masochist.

91
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,687
- Well, whatever turns you on.
- Yeah.

92
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:29,800
No. Turn that off, please. It's dinner.

93
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,177
Turn it off.

94
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,361
This marriage is definitely
running out of conversation, isn't it?

95
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:54,405
Maybe we should talk about
having another baby.

96
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:02,456
I got you.

97
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:08,124
Oh, no, he's got me. He's got me.

98
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,883
Watch my chair!

99
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:32,188
Hi.

100
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:34,696
Excuse me.

101
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:36,237
Listen, I have a problem
with my front wheel.

102
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:38,029
I wonder if you could take a look at it.

103
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:41,413
Park it next to the Datsun,
leave the keys in it.

104
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,035
Well, I was kind of hoping
I could wait for it today.

105
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:50,505
- You're kidding.
- No.

106
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:53,170
- See you later, Harry.
- Yeah.

107
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:03,598
Joe Camber will do it for you.

108
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:06,098
What's that?

109
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:08,226
Joe Camber.

110
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:11,644
Do a real good job
and he won't rob you blind.

111
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:17,066
Where's Joe Camber?

112
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,244
You take 117 here, straight out of town,
6 miles, give or take.

113
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:24,158
Go all the way out to the end,
you'll see Camber's mailbox.

114
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,784
Can't miss it.

115
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:28,991
Thanks.

116
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:34,047
See you later, Harry.

117
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:17,794
Hi.

118
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:21,499
Pa!

119
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,015
Tough time finding this place.
How are you?

120
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,854
My name is Victor Trenton.
You're Mr. Camber, right?

121
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:40,100
Yeah.

122
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,703
Afternoon.

123
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:01,293
You folks want anything to drink?

124
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,338
No, thank you. Thanks.

125
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:27,400
Vic.

126
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:31,029
Come on, Cujo. Come on, boy.

127
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:34,869
Don't go over to that dog,
you don't know that dog.

128
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:39,076
Don't worry about it, ma'am.
Cujo won't hurt him, he likes kids.

129
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,581
He's safe.

130
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,000
Run me down the hill and back,
wanna have a listen to it.

131
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,123
- Yeah, okay.
- Vic.

132
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,043
Oh, it's all right.

133
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,754
Yeah, it's all right.

134
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:55,220
Don't worry, Mr. Trenton,
your boy will be all right.

135
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,266
Gently.

136
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,108
Cujo. His name's Cujo.

137
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,697
- Cujo? How you doing, Cujo?
- He loves that.

138
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,941
Hey, boy.

139
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,036
What kind of dog is he?

140
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:22,623
Saint Bernard.

141
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:24,125
He's a great dog.

142
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,956
Yeah, he's a pretty smart one, too.

143
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,548
Monsters, stay out of Tad's room,
you have no business here.

144
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:41,549
No monsters in Tad's closet,
it's too small for you in there. See?

145
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:44,680
Where else?

146
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:48,893
- Under the bed.
- Under the bed? Okay.

147
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:50,640
All right.

148
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:54,904
No monsters under Tad's bed,
you cannot fit under there.

149
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:58,529
No monsters outside Tad's window.

150
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:01,275
Can't hold on out there.

151
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:03,827
Nothing will touch Tad,

152
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:08,077
nothing will hurt Tad
all through this night.

153
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,580
Okay?

154
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:14,210
They have no business here.

155
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:20,543
Okay?

156
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:34,517
God, 1:30.

157
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:46,115
What?

158
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:49,282
You're just really good with him,
that's all.

159
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,915
How am I with you?

160
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:54,537
Wonderful.

161
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:58,703
Night.

162
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:16,183
<i>No, nothing wrong here.</i>

163
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,014
<i>Well, that's not entirely true.</i>

164
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,143
<i>This morning,
thousands of people across the country</i>

165
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:24,729
<i>reported internal hemorrhaging
after eating Sharp Cereal products.</i>

166
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,904
<i>The scare, however,
proved to be a false alarm.</i>

167
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,492
- Hi.
- Hi.

168
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,243
- Hi, Tad.
- Hi, Dad.

169
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,821
<i>Despite that fact, the scare has reached
alarming proportions.</i>

170
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:37,041
<i>Sharp Cereal has been unavailable
for comment.</i>

171
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,041
<i>Nope, nothing wrong here, folks.</i>

172
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,285
Cute.

173
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:45,332
That's our ad campaign.

174
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:47,174
They've recalled
the whole goddamn cereal.

175
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:49,508
- Then there's no harm done, is there?
- "No harm done"?

176
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:51,677
Donna, that guy comes into
America's living room,

177
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:53,466
and he says to kids, he says,
"Trust me."

178
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,592
- Yes, I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

179
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,470
You see, we created that guy,
Roger and me.

180
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,395
- He's our brainchild.
- Yes, I understand.

181
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:01,894
And these kids,
they go out and they buy the cereal.

182
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:04,017
All the Sharp Cereals. All of them.

183
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:08,357
Bran 16, All Grain,
Coco-Bears, Twinkles.

184
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:13,067
And now, kids all over the country
are peeing and puking red dye

185
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:16,902
and scaring the hell out of their parents,
and we told them to buy it.

186
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,906
The Sharp Professor is us.
That's our ass, Roger's and mine.

187
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:23,249
You'll work it out,
you always have before.

188
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:25,252
All right, look,
I appreciate this isn't a world crisis,

189
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,085
- it's not a mass suicide...
- That'll be Roger.

190
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:29,379
Hello?

191
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:32,130
Yeah, sure, Roger, hold on. It's Roger.

192
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:33,340
Calm down.

193
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,548
Hi, Rog.

194
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:41,973
Roger, Rog, calm down.

195
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:45,770
Calm down, we'll work it out,
we always have before.

196
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,399
Well, then, nobody got hurt, right?

197
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:50,733
What we're talking about here
is a lot of scared people.

198
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:52,938
<i>We're talking about recalling
the whole goddamn cereal.</i>

199
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:56,276
Well, that's not too bad.
I mean, it certainly could be worse.

200
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:59,778
Hey, buddy, don't yell at me,
I didn't do it, it's your dye not my...

201
00:20:59,913 --> 00:21:00,909
Roger.

202
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,159
<i>...like there's nothing wrong here.
- Look, look, no harm was done,</i>

203
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:07,625
and I'm sure given time,
this whole thing will blow over...

204
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:10,244
<i>We're having a special board meeting
next week, okay?</i>

205
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:11,376
Special board meeting?

206
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:13,416
<i>To re-assess our position
re the Professor.</i>

207
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,546
Sure, we can be there.

208
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:16,087
<i>- You better be there.
- Right.</i>

209
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,129
<i>You better start taking this
a little more seriously, too.</i>

210
00:21:18,264 --> 00:21:20,256
<i>- Right.
- I'm not kidding.</i>

211
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:24,928
"To re-assess our position,
re the Professor."

212
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:29,222
We lost the Sharp account.

213
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:37,818
Brett!

214
00:22:44,553 --> 00:22:45,584
Hi.

215
00:22:46,597 --> 00:22:47,676
Hi.

216
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,468
Come here.

217
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:52,967
Can't see you anymore, Steve.

218
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:57,933
Well, it's a little late for that, isn't it?

219
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,813
Just came by to tell you that.

220
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:08,400
Okay. Look, can you tell me why?

221
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:12,824
Jesus, I don't know.

222
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:15,196
I got this terrific husband
and this terrific kid

223
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:18,248
and here I am screwing around
with the local stud.

224
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:20,167
No offense intended.

225
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:21,670
None taken.

226
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:23,707
What the hell's the matter?

227
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:26,799
It's just over, that's all. I want it over.

228
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:31,637
It's not your fault.
It was just a stupid mistake.

229
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:36,299
Okay.

230
00:23:37,144 --> 00:23:38,852
Whatever you want.

231
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm sorry.

232
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:20,194
- Hi, pumpkin.
- Hi. Look what I made.

233
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:23,030
Hey, that's really nice.

234
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:25,450
What happened to you?

235
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,281
- Nothing.
- Yeah? Doesn't look like nothing.

236
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,789
I got hit by a swing.

237
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:34,334
Come here, let me make it better.

238
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,379
Well, over, done with, gone, right?

239
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:40,671
Over, done with, gone.

240
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:42,344
Okay, strap in.

241
00:25:57,442 --> 00:26:00,313
- Oh, you like this, huh?
- It's fun.

242
00:26:04,283 --> 00:26:05,943
<i>Bum, bum, bum</i>

243
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:10,370
<i>- I see your hiney, nice and shiny
- Nice and shiny</i>

244
00:26:10,497 --> 00:26:14,281
<i>- If you don't hide it, I think I'll bite it
- I think I'll bite it</i>

245
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:19,623
- Daddy's home.
- Yeah, so I see.

246
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:23,499
Okay, everybody out.

247
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:27,003
- Hi.
- Daddy!

248
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,090
My big guy.

249
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:32,389
- Home early, huh?
- Yeah.

250
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,979
- What happened to your head?
- Fell off the swing.

251
00:26:36,104 --> 00:26:37,931
- You did?
- Pinto's doing that thing again.

252
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,689
I'll have to take it out to Camber's.
Let me see.

253
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:41,476
- Yeah, I've heard that one before.
- Come here.

254
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,234
Hey, would you like to play
some baseball?

255
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:44,357
- Yeah.
- Would you?

256
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:47,025
There's a load of groceries here, Tad,
that's your job.

257
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:49,532
No, not today.

258
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,820
Go on, go get your mitt,
you left it on the front lawn again.

259
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:54,116
- Go on.
- Okay.

260
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,707
So what'd you do today?

261
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:05,295
Oh, you know, the usual.
Groceries, errands.

262
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:08,249
Yeah?

263
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:10,594
Roger come in today?

264
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:13,638
No, he's still in mourning
for the account.

265
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,978
What the hell is that?

266
00:28:14,113 --> 00:28:15,737
It's an engine hoist.

267
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:21,360
You wanted one.
It's the new hydraulic hoist you wanted.

268
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:24,120
You kept telling me you need one.

269
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:26,655
You tell me
what the fuck you're up to, Charity.

270
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:29,081
Sit down and eat, and I will.

271
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,628
Can't you use it?

272
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:35,666
Damn well can't afford it.

273
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:56,192
I won the lottery.

274
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,120
$5,000.

275
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,083
When do we get it?

276
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,460
Two weeks, a little less.

277
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:22,750
Thanks.

278
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,340
I got you a present.

279
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,721
You give me one, Joe. Okay?

280
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,641
I wanna go away for a week with Brett,

281
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,191
to see my sister in Connecticut.

282
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,870
Boston? What the hell
are you gonna do in Boston?

283
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,618
What makes you think
I could afford to go, anyways?

284
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,291
Shit, you're rolling in it!

285
00:29:57,543 --> 00:30:00,747
You might have to dig out something
from the mattress is all.

286
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:04,371
You're kicking up your heels a little,
aren't you, Joey?

287
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:07,676
You gonna go right to the Combat Zone,
see a couple of dirty movies

288
00:30:07,804 --> 00:30:08,918
and try to get the clap.

289
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:12,389
You better look out, Pervier,
or I'll sic my dog on you.

290
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:14,215
That dog?

291
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:17,104
You couldn't sic that dog on me
if I was coming at you

292
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,768
with a straight razor in each hand.

293
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:22,980
What's your wife say about it?

294
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,019
She don't know, she don't have to know.

295
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:26,482
Oh, sure.

296
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:30,234
She gonna take the boy and visit
her sister. Gonna be gone a week.

297
00:30:35,455 --> 00:30:38,740
You gonna spend a lump
of that lottery money, huh?

298
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:42,961
- Oh, shit.
- Broads, booze, baseball!

299
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:46,706
I don't want to do it alone,
it's no fun. Come on.

300
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:51,799
I don't give a shit if I do.

301
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:56,716
Okay, now you're talking.
Now you're talking!

302
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,797
You got me, got me!
You got me, got me!

303
00:31:36,554 --> 00:31:37,669
How's my boy, huh?

304
00:31:37,805 --> 00:31:39,050
You having a good time
at summer camp?

305
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:40,641
- No.
- No?

306
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,971
Your mom said you were having fun.

307
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,394
- Come on, you wanna go home, then?
- Yeah.

308
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:50,192
All right, come on, let's go.
Over the shoulders.

309
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:52,274
Yeah, home we go.

310
00:31:52,402 --> 00:31:54,442
Think you can beat me to the Jaguar?

311
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:56,528
Think you can beat me? Come on.

312
00:32:32,274 --> 00:32:34,811
God, you scared the shit out of me.

313
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:36,270
I'm sorry.

314
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,396
How'd you get in here anyway?

315
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:41,487
Finished with your table,
I brought it back.

316
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:45,031
It's all stripped
and it's a beautiful piece of work.

317
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,153
Leave it on the back porch.

318
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:48,782
I already did.

319
00:32:50,082 --> 00:32:51,707
Where's Tadpole?

320
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:54,118
He's upstairs sleeping.

321
00:32:58,132 --> 00:33:01,251
- Steve.
- I miss you, okay?

322
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:03,881
- You know, I miss touching you.
- Steve...

323
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,094
Please. Quit it!

324
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:15,719
Steve.

325
00:33:23,655 --> 00:33:27,189
Home!
It's my goddamn home, you bastard!

326
00:33:27,325 --> 00:33:29,483
Bastard, it's my home!

327
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:32,452
What the hell are you doing?

328
00:33:32,622 --> 00:33:34,780
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

329
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:37,039
Just get out of here, Kemp.

330
00:33:38,836 --> 00:33:40,544
Mommy, Mommy!

331
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:44,001
What happened?

332
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:45,918
The milk spilled.

333
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:51,763
- Go out and ride your bike, Tad.
- Are you okay, Mommy?

334
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:52,922
- Go on.
- Yeah, honey, I'm okay.

335
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:54,766
Go ride your bike.

336
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,094
I brought your table, but I spilt some...

337
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,392
Steve.

338
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:06,565
Yeah.

339
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:19,577
Yes or no?

340
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,542
Yes.

341
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:03,827
No, no! Don't, you son of a...

342
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:10,749
What is it?

343
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:13,000
I don't want you to go.

344
00:35:13,133 --> 00:35:16,217
Well, I'll be back.
I'll be back in 10 days.

345
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,631
But I don't want to go to day camp.

346
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:23,216
Why don't you give that
another day or two, all right?

347
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:27,386
Who's gonna say the monster words?
Mommy don't know them.

348
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:36,400
Come here.

349
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,363
You see, Tad,

350
00:35:46,414 --> 00:35:50,163
the thing about the monster words
is they're written down.

351
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,667
Yeah, that's the only way
your dad can know them.

352
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:55,832
So, what I'll do is I'll copy them for you

353
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:59,630
and I'll tack them on your bedroom wall
and that way...

354
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:02,715
Well, your mom
can read them to you every night.

355
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:04,092
Will you?

356
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,342
I will. I promise I'll do it for you tonight.

357
00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:12,304
Okay, Tad, time for your nap.

358
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,684
I love you, sport.

359
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:23,109
Did you fix it?

360
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:25,153
No, I don't have the tools.

361
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:28,322
Take it up to Joe Camber's,
it's only 7 miles.

362
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:29,913
Yeah, maybe.

363
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:32,620
I'll try and run it up Saturday
if I can get the time.

364
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:35,121
It's okay, I'll take care of it.

365
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,376
Cujo?

366
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,192
Cujo.

367
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,611
Cujo, what's the matter?

368
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:39,158
Cujo, it's me, Brett.

369
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:43,699
Take it easy, boy.

370
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,624
I'm not gonna hurt you.

371
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:52,542
Cujo?

372
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:02,003
Cujo!

373
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:05,268
Cujo!

374
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:28,371
I don't want you to go for 10 days.
I want you to go for one day.

375
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,711
Tad, I'll be back before you know it.
Now give me a kiss, come on.

376
00:39:38,717 --> 00:39:41,552
I forgot to take the Pinto into Camber's.

377
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,257
I'll take care of it.

378
00:39:51,437 --> 00:39:53,346
Well, I'll see you.

379
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:00,235
Vic! Stay there.

380
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:16,708
I just wanted you to know it was over.

381
00:40:16,836 --> 00:40:19,671
I just wanted to be sure
that you knew that.

382
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:23,627
I can't make that it never happened, Vic.

383
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,087
I can't make like
it never happened either, Donna.

384
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:28,012
I know. I know that.

385
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:31,599
So I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

386
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,649
I don't know.

387
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:03,416
Get the rest of the bags, Brett.

388
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:15,547
Mom?

389
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:18,926
You know, I'm worried about Cujo.

390
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:22,645
I saw him this morning in the fog
and he was all bloody.

391
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,353
He was dripping foam at the mouth.

392
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,311
I think I better tell Dad.

393
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,520
No, you do no such thing.

394
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:32,312
Your father would just
jump on something like that.

395
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,737
You just leave him be and he'll come
mooching around your dad

396
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:36,659
and your dad will take care of him.

397
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,620
He loves Cujo.

398
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,786
Yeah, I guess he would.

399
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,165
Tell you what,
we'll call your father tonight.

400
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:49,082
When you talk to him,
you say, sort of casually,

401
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,333
"You feeding my dog, Daddy?"

402
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,797
Then you know.

403
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:57,715
- Yeah.
- Brett!

404
00:43:02,243 --> 00:43:03,441
Cujo.

405
00:43:04,828 --> 00:43:06,868
What're you growling at?

406
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,888
Come on! Come on! I don't give a shit!

407
00:43:35,023 --> 00:43:37,857
You hear me? I don't give a shit!

408
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:50,741
You are dead, you stupid son of a bitch.

409
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:49,832
Cujo!

410
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,335
Cujo!

411
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:00,805
Cujo!

412
00:45:03,564 --> 00:45:04,727
Shit.

413
00:45:33,093 --> 00:45:34,255
Gary!

414
00:45:38,473 --> 00:45:39,848
Hey, Gary!

415
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:01,656
Gary?

416
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,868
Gary!

417
00:46:23,724 --> 00:46:26,393
Oh. Shit.

418
00:46:27,895 --> 00:46:29,353
Gary.

419
00:46:30,314 --> 00:46:31,559
Gary.

420
00:47:33,206 --> 00:47:34,369
Cujo!

421
00:47:37,584 --> 00:47:39,458
Oh, my God, you're rabid.

422
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:45,790
Easy, boy. Easy, Cujo.

423
00:47:59,606 --> 00:48:02,974
<i>- One rolled over and the other one said
- One rolled over and the other one said</i>

424
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:04,105
<i>Bum, bum, bum</i>

425
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:08,564
<i>- I see your hiney, it's nice and shiny
- I see your hiney, it's nice and shiny</i>

426
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:13,443
<i>- If you don't hide it, I think I'll bite it
- If you don't hide it, I think I'll bite it</i>

427
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:23,957
<i>Oh, my goodness, oh, my soul!</i>

428
00:48:32,803 --> 00:48:36,504
Come on, baby. Just a little more to go.

429
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:20,719
- Well, I think we've arrived, Tadder.
- Yeah, but is anybody home?

430
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,638
I don't know, we'll see.

431
00:49:28,856 --> 00:49:30,054
Hello?

432
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:37,901
- I can't get my seatbelt off.
- Hello?

433
00:49:43,287 --> 00:49:45,861
Just great. This is great.

434
00:49:49,793 --> 00:49:54,087
- I can't get my dang old seatbelt off.
- All right! I'm coming.

435
00:49:55,756 --> 00:49:57,749
You're so impatient.

436
00:49:58,968 --> 00:50:00,676
Damn belt is stuck again.

437
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:03,804
I guess everything in this car is broken.

438
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:06,552
I wish Daddy'd get a new car.

439
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,392
Sounds good to me.

440
00:50:10,563 --> 00:50:12,105
Damn this car.

441
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:14,105
You pull while I push.

442
00:50:17,152 --> 00:50:18,978
Oh, I can't get it.

443
00:50:19,112 --> 00:50:20,108
Pull!

444
00:50:59,817 --> 00:51:02,225
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Mommy!

445
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:12,322
Oh, there's no monsters.

446
00:51:13,955 --> 00:51:15,450
I know, baby.

447
00:51:15,582 --> 00:51:18,334
It's the monster out of my closet!

448
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,078
Listen to me, it's not a monster,
it's just a doggy.

449
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:49,606
Okay, okay.

450
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:50,735
I want to go home.

451
00:51:50,865 --> 00:51:52,609
The doggy's gone.
See, the doggy's gone.

452
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:56,027
Okay, all right, we're gonna go home
right now.

453
00:51:56,704 --> 00:51:58,115
We're going right now.

454
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:03,960
Damn this car!

455
00:52:07,381 --> 00:52:09,919
- I want to go home.
- Listen to me!

456
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:13,004
- I want to go home.
- We can't go home right now, okay?

457
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:15,178
We have to wait.

458
00:52:15,889 --> 00:52:18,594
Tad, we have to let... Okay.

459
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:21,395
We have to let the engine die down.

460
00:52:22,855 --> 00:52:23,850
Okay.

461
00:52:26,482 --> 00:52:29,435
Okay, we're gonna go home
in a few minutes.

462
00:52:33,155 --> 00:52:35,646
We're gonna go home in a few minutes.

463
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:32,791
Mom, aren't we going?

464
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:35,125
Ma!

465
00:53:37,716 --> 00:53:39,709
Yeah, okay, we'll try it.

466
00:53:41,303 --> 00:53:43,046
Cross your fingers.

467
00:53:43,472 --> 00:53:45,630
Come on, baby, one more time.

468
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:56,018
Great, it started! We're gonna go home.

469
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,036
Fuck you, dog.

470
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:33,885
Come on, damn it, turn over.

471
00:54:36,397 --> 00:54:38,970
Goddamn you, car!

472
00:54:40,525 --> 00:54:43,479
God, why didn't you get this car fixed?

473
00:54:44,988 --> 00:54:45,983
God!

474
00:54:51,077 --> 00:54:53,485
Mommy, are you okay?

475
00:54:57,082 --> 00:54:58,245
Yeah.

476
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:01,331
I thought you were mad at me.

477
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:05,921
No, baby, never at you.

478
00:55:12,388 --> 00:55:14,297
Can he get us in here?

479
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:19,765
No.

480
00:55:21,772 --> 00:55:25,355
Can he eat his way in here? Can he?

481
00:55:26,486 --> 00:55:27,565
No.

482
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:31,440
Wish he would die.

483
00:55:33,408 --> 00:55:34,689
Me, too.

484
00:56:49,021 --> 00:56:50,848
Mommy?

485
00:56:51,232 --> 00:56:54,315
- What?
- I gotta go pee.

486
00:56:54,776 --> 00:56:58,359
- Oh, Tadder, you got to go bad?
- Yes.

487
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:00,317
Real bad?

488
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,574
Okay, look, we're gonna open this door
just a little crack, okay?

489
00:57:07,706 --> 00:57:09,663
And you pee right outside here.

490
00:57:12,752 --> 00:57:14,128
Why can't we go outside?

491
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:16,923
Because it's too cold.
Get your pants down.

492
00:57:17,048 --> 00:57:18,792
- Ready?
- Ready.

493
00:57:18,924 --> 00:57:20,834
Okay, go quick.

494
00:57:41,362 --> 00:57:43,189
Zip up your pants, Tad.

495
01:00:14,131 --> 01:00:18,378
- Don't open the window!
- Got to open a little bit for some air.

496
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:25,217
What's that?

497
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:26,927
The monster words.

498
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,765
Oh, let me see. Please?

499
01:00:30,438 --> 01:00:32,478
I'll give them right back.

500
01:00:33,983 --> 01:00:37,187
- Something to drink.
- Oh, baby.

501
01:00:38,488 --> 01:00:41,939
We got just a little bit left
and I think we ought to save it, okay?

502
01:00:42,075 --> 01:00:44,067
Can you wait just for a while?

503
01:00:44,202 --> 01:00:46,325
- Yeah.
- Good, thank you.

504
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:50,779
Can I have my monster words back?

505
01:00:53,709 --> 01:00:58,455
"Monsters stay out of Tad's room.
You have no business here.

506
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:03,668
"No monsters under Tad's bed,
you can't fit under there.

507
01:01:04,512 --> 01:01:09,637
"No monsters hiding in Tad's closet,
it's too small in there.

508
01:01:10,226 --> 01:01:13,512
"No monsters outside Tad's window,

509
01:01:13,646 --> 01:01:16,682
"you can't hold on out there.

510
01:01:16,983 --> 01:01:21,145
"No vampires, no werewolves,
nothing that bites.

511
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:24,528
"You have no business here."

512
01:01:26,074 --> 01:01:28,446
Maybe it'll start now.

513
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:32,827
I'm afraid to try it because
the battery's so weak.

514
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:37,079
What does it matter
if the battery's weak or not?

515
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,037
We're just sitting here.

516
01:01:39,171 --> 01:01:40,415
Try it.

517
01:01:41,505 --> 01:01:42,786
Please.

518
01:01:44,507 --> 01:01:45,622
Okay.

519
01:02:00,774 --> 01:02:02,054
Told you.

520
01:02:06,654 --> 01:02:10,154
Don't worry, when the mailman comes
we'll go home.

521
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:23,873
- Just lay them out like this.
- Okay.

522
01:02:26,882 --> 01:02:28,625
- George.
- Yeah.

523
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:34,755
Hold mail until notified, the Cambers,
remember, George?

524
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:36,763
My mind's gone.

525
01:02:36,891 --> 01:02:39,346
Thanks, Roger. Saved me a trip.

526
01:02:58,578 --> 01:03:00,950
Get back in that barn, damn you.

527
01:03:37,823 --> 01:03:39,198
Oh, my God.

528
01:04:16,193 --> 01:04:18,185
It makes him angry.

529
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:42,295
Come on. Please be quiet.

530
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,757
I want to go home. I want to go home.

531
01:04:52,894 --> 01:04:55,646
Momma wants to go home
very much, too.

532
01:04:56,981 --> 01:04:59,935
Can we please go home?

533
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:01,348
Oh, baby.

534
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:07,404
<i>No, nothing wrong here.</i>

535
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:18,582
<i>- No, nothing wrong here.
- This is ridiculous.</i>

536
01:05:18,751 --> 01:05:22,583
We need a whole new campaign.
Start from scratch, huh, Vic?

537
01:05:24,632 --> 01:05:26,790
- Vic?
- Huh, what? I'm sorry.

538
01:05:26,926 --> 01:05:29,499
Cut it, Frank. We're wasting our time.

539
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:33,176
- Where you going?
- I need some sugar.

540
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:52,152
Tadder?

541
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:54,774
Tad?

542
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,551
Oh, shit.

543
01:10:03,062 --> 01:10:05,303
Mommy, Mommy.

544
01:10:06,565 --> 01:10:08,106
Mommy, please!

545
01:10:08,232 --> 01:10:11,067
Mommy!

546
01:10:12,153 --> 01:10:14,822
- I want to go home.
- Okay, baby.

547
01:10:16,657 --> 01:10:18,863
Real soon.

548
01:10:18,993 --> 01:10:22,943
Real soon, dear. Tadder, real soon.

549
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,073
I want to go home.

550
01:10:25,207 --> 01:10:27,959
Don't get out of the car.

551
01:10:46,144 --> 01:10:47,389
No!

552
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:01,402
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- Just wanted you to know, Roger.

553
01:11:01,532 --> 01:11:03,940
- I have to go back.
- Go back? Go home?

554
01:11:04,077 --> 01:11:05,736
You can't do that.
This whole damn thing was your idea.

555
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,361
- You can't do that to me.
- I know, Roger. I'm sorry.

556
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:10,786
- But I can't stay.
- Oh, look, I understand.

557
01:11:10,917 --> 01:11:12,874
I know what you're going through.

558
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:14,829
- You do?
- Of course.

559
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,712
You think I'm so wrapped up
in my own problems,

560
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,710
I can't see what's happening to you.
I see it, believe me.

561
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,168
- Happens to everyone.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

562
01:11:22,303 --> 01:11:24,592
Oh, you can't come up with an answer
to the Sharp account

563
01:11:24,722 --> 01:11:28,007
so you think you're through,
you think the creative juice is gone.

564
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:30,976
It's panic, that's all. Just panic.

565
01:11:35,273 --> 01:11:39,057
Hey, what did I say?
Vic, what is eating you?

566
01:11:42,489 --> 01:11:44,398
Donna's been having an affair.

567
01:11:46,242 --> 01:11:49,159
Before I left she told me she had quit it.

568
01:11:49,286 --> 01:11:52,406
But, Roger, she hasn't
answered the phone in two days.

569
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:53,997
Oh, shit.

570
01:11:54,207 --> 01:11:55,998
I'm going back.

571
01:11:56,626 --> 01:11:58,001
I'm sorry.

572
01:11:58,253 --> 01:12:01,918
Look, maybe she's spending
the night with a friend.

573
01:12:02,048 --> 01:12:04,670
Oh, I can't believe I said that.
Call someone.

574
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:06,794
Call the police,
have them go over and take a look.

575
01:12:06,928 --> 01:12:08,837
That's not the point.

576
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:12,471
God damn it, Vic,
you can't run out on the Sharp account.

577
01:12:12,725 --> 01:12:14,268
Wanna bet?

578
01:13:21,373 --> 01:13:23,781
Please, God, get me out of here.

579
01:13:26,753 --> 01:13:28,876
Please get me out of here.

580
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,489
Tad.

581
01:14:11,379 --> 01:14:12,956
Tadder, wake up.

582
01:14:15,174 --> 01:14:16,288
Tad.

583
01:14:20,137 --> 01:14:22,010
Tad! Tad!

584
01:14:23,598 --> 01:14:24,761
Tad!

585
01:14:24,933 --> 01:14:26,392
Oh, my God.

586
01:14:26,893 --> 01:14:28,304
Tad, wake up.

587
01:14:30,814 --> 01:14:32,641
Oh, come on.

588
01:14:40,656 --> 01:14:42,898
Breathe, breathe.

589
01:14:44,744 --> 01:14:45,739
Tad.

590
01:14:51,834 --> 01:14:53,910
Come on, breathe. Breathe.

591
01:14:54,044 --> 01:14:56,167
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

592
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:57,293
Come on.

593
01:14:58,382 --> 01:15:00,919
Tadder, talk to me.

594
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:02,924
I want to go home.

595
01:15:04,637 --> 01:15:05,966
- Tadder, talk.
- I want to go home.

596
01:15:06,096 --> 01:15:08,587
<i>Four little monkeys sitting on a bed</i>

597
01:15:08,724 --> 01:15:10,763
<i>- One rolled over
- One rolled over</i>

598
01:15:10,893 --> 01:15:13,384
<i>- and the other one said
- Bum, bum, bum</i>

599
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,521
<i>I see your hiney, nice and shiny</i>

600
01:15:17,775 --> 01:15:20,894
<i>If you don't hide it, I think I'll bite it</i>

601
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,566
Okay.

602
01:15:38,961 --> 01:15:40,456
Anybody home?

603
01:15:47,136 --> 01:15:48,334
Donna?

604
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:13,154
Donna?

605
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:53,694
We got to everybody on that list,
didn't we, Bannerman?

606
01:16:53,823 --> 01:16:56,528
Did we ever reach Mrs...
What was her name?

607
01:16:56,659 --> 01:17:00,110
- Her friend in Werdon?
- I said yes.

608
01:17:00,246 --> 01:17:04,789
Man, I'm telling you, it was Kemp.
All right? This was Kemp who did this.

609
01:17:05,293 --> 01:17:09,125
- Where's your wife's car, Mr. Trenton?
- The what?

610
01:17:09,714 --> 01:17:13,924
It bothers me. Kemp came here, right?
He grabs your wife and son.

611
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:17,965
Why? Well, he's crazy,
which is reason enough.

612
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:20,048
Where's her car?

613
01:17:20,182 --> 01:17:22,803
It's in the shop at Camber's.
The needle valve is sticking.

614
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:24,678
- Joe Camber's?
- Yes, Joe Camber's.

615
01:17:24,811 --> 01:17:26,804
- She was going to take it in.
- When would that have been?

616
01:17:26,938 --> 01:17:29,394
- I don't know.
- I'll check it out.

617
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:34,525
Wait, what are you going
to do about Kemp?

618
01:17:34,654 --> 01:17:37,690
We've got an MV alert out on him,
we'll pick him up soon enough.

619
01:17:37,823 --> 01:17:39,696
Kemp is taken care of.

620
01:20:02,794 --> 01:20:04,288
Goddamn you!

621
01:20:25,523 --> 01:20:26,518
No!

622
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:49,044
Oh, Tad. Oh, not now!

623
01:20:49,462 --> 01:20:53,507
Oh, please, not now.
Oh, please, please.

624
01:20:56,094 --> 01:20:57,339
Breathe!

625
01:20:57,512 --> 01:20:59,005
Not now!

626
01:20:59,847 --> 01:21:01,175
I want...

627
01:21:02,141 --> 01:21:04,596
- I want my daddy.
- Okay.

628
01:21:04,727 --> 01:21:06,849
Okay. I'll get your daddy.

629
01:21:06,979 --> 01:21:08,687
Oh, my God.

630
01:21:08,814 --> 01:21:10,770
I want my daddy.

631
01:21:11,941 --> 01:21:14,776
I want my daddy.

632
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:19,741
I want my daddy.

633
01:21:20,366 --> 01:21:24,364
- I want my daddy.
- All right, I'll get your daddy!

634
01:21:46,641 --> 01:21:47,673
Mr. Trenton?

635
01:21:48,977 --> 01:21:50,470
We picked up Kemp.

636
01:21:51,437 --> 01:21:52,717
Are they all right?

637
01:21:52,855 --> 01:21:54,978
Well, your wife and son
weren't with him.

638
01:21:55,107 --> 01:21:57,645
He claims that he never even saw them.

639
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:59,983
Bullshit! Now you don't
believe that, do you?

640
01:22:00,112 --> 01:22:02,354
Not after what he did to the house.

641
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:05,573
Now, that's the thing.
He admits that he trashed the house.

642
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,657
His story checks.

643
01:22:07,786 --> 01:22:10,490
To tell you the truth, I believe him.

644
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:15,826
What did Bannerman say?

645
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,336
Well, he...

646
01:22:18,838 --> 01:22:23,417
Probably following up some lead,
we'll be hearing from him any time now.

647
01:22:24,302 --> 01:22:26,710
Wait a minute,
you haven't heard from him yet?

648
01:22:26,846 --> 01:22:28,969
He hasn't even called in?

649
01:23:29,739 --> 01:23:30,733
Tad?

650
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:34,032
Tad, baby.

651
01:23:36,703 --> 01:23:37,699
Tad.

652
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,788
Oh, baby, wake up.

653
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,126
Tadder?

654
01:23:50,549 --> 01:23:51,664
Tad?

655
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:06,596
Dear, God, gotta save my baby.

656
01:24:08,859 --> 01:24:10,852
Gotta save my baby.

657
01:24:58,781 --> 01:25:00,987
Well, come on, then!

658
01:27:31,174 --> 01:27:32,170
Tadder?

659
01:27:47,898 --> 01:27:48,893
Tad?

660
01:28:12,756 --> 01:28:13,787
Tad?

661
01:28:15,007 --> 01:28:16,252
Breathe!

662
01:28:38,363 --> 01:28:39,608
Yes.

663
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,524
Yes, baby.

664
01:28:41,656 --> 01:28:44,408
Yes, yes.

665
01:28:44,534 --> 01:28:47,405
Yes, my baby.

666
01:28:50,207 --> 01:28:51,202
Yes.

667
01:28:52,584 --> 01:28:53,580
Yes.

668
01:28:55,754 --> 01:28:58,874
Yes, baby, yes.

669
01:29:39,795 --> 01:29:40,993
Donna?

670
01:29:45,259 --> 01:29:46,457
Donna?

671
01:29:47,594 --> 01:29:48,757
Donna!
