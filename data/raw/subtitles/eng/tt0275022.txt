1
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,175
-Hand me the flashlight.
- Here it is.

2
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,181
- Kit, I've got the shovel.
- You do?

3
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,434
Lucy, get the box.

4
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,062
- What are you putting in?
- It's supposed to be a secret.

5
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,981
- What are you putting in?
- It's supposed to be a secret.

6
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,487
- My dad thinks I'm at your house.
- My mom thinks I'm at yours.

7
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,408
Let's d i g deep.

8
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,370
So no one will find it.

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:24,459
- Di g it deeper!.
- We don't wanna get caught.

10
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,045
I want some dirt.

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,636
When we were ten growing up
in Georgia, Mimi, Kit and I...

12
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,807
knew exactly what we wanted
out oflife.

13
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,602
- Lucy, get the box.
- This is fun.

14
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:46,732
So we put our dreams in a box,
and we buried it.

15
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,234
We have to keep it dry.

16
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,788
We made a pact to dig it up
at midnight...

17
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:05,042
the day of our
high school graduation.

18
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,461
Pack it down.

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,717
- Let's be best friends forever.
- We will.

20
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,970
Now, I don't even remember
what our wishes were--

21
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,056
except for one.

22
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,018
We wished that we'd be
best friends forever.

23
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,189
Well, that wish
didn 't come true.

24
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,545
I see you on the street
andyou walk on by

25
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,924
Baby

26
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:58,929
You make me wanna hang
my head down and cry

27
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,603
Ifyou gave me
halfthe chance, you'd see

28
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:10,858
My desire burning inside ofme

29
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:15,779
But you choose
to look the other way

30
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:22,286
I've had to work
much harder than this

31
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,665
For something I want
Don 't try to resist me

32
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,586
Open your heart to me, baby

33
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,756
I hold the lock
andyou hold the key--

34
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,050
- Lucille Wagner!.
- Pop?.

35
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,220
- Baby, we're gonna be late.
- I was just--

36
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,222
- Did you practice your speech?.
- I almost have it.

37
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,142
Lucy, how's it gonna look if the
valedictorian messes up her speech?.

38
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,935
Okay.

39
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,230
Don't wrinkle your robe.
Just ironed it forya.

40
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:57,237
Okay, big day!. Come on!
See ya on deck! Let's go!

41
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:00,324
Toads do look like frogs.

42
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,368
It's just one's, you know,
in the water and one's not.

43
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,121
It doesn't--
It could happen to anybody.

44
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,875
Hey, Mimi!
I know you want me.

45
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,755
Ho!

46
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,049
I'm gonna look
drop-dead gorgeous.

47
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,843
You should see my dress.

48
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:24,139
- Hello! Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me, Kit.

49
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,517
What, you're too perfect
to bump into anybody?.

50
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,727
- What?.
- Perfect.

51
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,481
Sweet, proper...

52
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,691
nerdy and virginal.

53
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,319
- I'm not--
- You're a virgin.

54
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,738
I told y'all.

55
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:44,159
Just get us in the picture, okay?.
Hold my purse.

56
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,913
No, don't push the button.
Wait till I get over there. Honey!

57
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:53,252
- Mama, what are you doing?.
- One second. Stand up straight.

58
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,505
- I am. I will.
- Tuckyour tummy in.

59
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,882
- Smile.
- Mom, I'm smiling!

60
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,051
Bigger, darling.

61
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:05,222
- Lucy, your speech was wonderful.
- Thankyou.

62
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,975
I hope you're gonna continue
studying music in college.

63
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,060
Actually, Lucy wants
to become a doctor.

64
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,105
Voice classes would make
nice electives.

65
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,275
No time. We're looking at a double
major in biology and chemistry...

66
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,737
if she wants to get into
the best med school, huh?.

67
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,699
Henry, I'll show you how
to start that truck for tonight.

68
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,869
All right.
See you later.

69
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,122
- Bye, Ms. J.
- Good luck, Henry.

70
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm all he's got, you know?.

71
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,836
Congratulations, Lucy.

72
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,966
Thank you. Thanks.

73
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,188
Here it is.
Honey, what's wrong?.

74
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,190
I'm fine.

75
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,696
Pop, I worked really hard
to be the valedictorian.

76
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,948
Course you did.

77
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,119
Why didn't it feel
like anything?.

78
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,748
What do you mean, you didn't
feel anything?. It felt great!

79
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,252
Pop, I never went
to one football game.

80
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,546
You don't like football.

81
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,467
But you're supposed to go,
and it's supposed to be fun.

82
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:27,262
And like all the parties
at Hemmings Field and stuff...

83
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,140
I never went to any of'em.

84
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:35,229
I never stayed out late.
I never just hung out.

85
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,648
'Cause you had
a head on your shoulders.

86
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,858
You stayed home, and you studied.

87
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,820
There's just a lot of things
that I wanted to do that I didn't.

88
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,825
And I was up there getting
my diploma, and I was like...

89
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,911
"Is this it?'

90
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:55,082
Come on now. Didn't we both
work hard for this?.

91
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,503
You're right.

92
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,423
I guess it's just the pressure
of graduation. You're right.

93
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,934
Girls, hi!

94
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,314
Lucy.

95
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,242
Mimi, not now. Okay?.

96
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,203
- Are you comin' or not?.
- Coming where?.

97
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,247
It's graduation night!

98
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,209
Oh, God, Hemmings Field.
I totally forgot.

99
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,920
So, are you comin' or not?.

100
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,843
I have plans.
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,762
Come on. You okay?.

102
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,900
Do you want something?.

103
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,819
Yeah. Are you coming
at midnight or what?.

104
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,322
Excuse me?.

105
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,782
Kit, we made a pact, remember?.

106
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,119
Oh, you're not serious!

107
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,665
Well, look, you can
really go without me.

108
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:22,586
I have better things to do
than dig up some old box.

109
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,593
Standing here
looking at all the world

110
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,482
The guitar guy is such a hottie.

111
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,150
That's Ben Kimble.

112
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,653
I heard he just got out of jail.
Killed a guy.

113
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,989
I don't believe you.

114
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,326
Yeah! Everybody's talking about it.

115
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,161
Oh, too bad!

116
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,039
Well, if anyone could have him,
it'd be you.

117
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,668
But I'm off the market, remember?.

118
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,712
Oh, please!
Dylan's at UCLA doing...

119
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,840
God knows what
with God knows who.

120
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,508
That's not true.

121
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,009
Right.

122
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,011
Whatever.

123
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,183
- Are you ready?.
- Yeah, yeah, just two seconds.

124
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,191
Okay, hold on.

125
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,237
Henry, are you ready?.

126
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,072
Henry, are you ready?.

127
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,201
I'm ready.

128
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,812
That's okay. Go on.

129
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,493
Why are you stopping?.

130
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,289
This isn't how I hoped it would be.

131
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,584
That's weird, 'cause this is
exactly how I hoped it would be...

132
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,170
or pretty accurate.

133
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:33,175
- Maybe ifwe get into bed.
- That's a good idea.

134
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,431
These are nice sheets.

135
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,811
- Can I hear the list again?.
- Oh, Luce, come on.

136
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:48,398
Please, please.
Just one more time.

137
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,071
Thanks.

138
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,198
All right.

139
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,870
Reason number one.

140
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:05,958
We've been lab partners for three
years so we really trust each other.

141
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,169
- That's really important. Okay.
- Trust is very important.

142
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,964
Reason number two:. We are both 1 8
and have never done it.

143
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,508
Very important!

144
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,261
Reason number three:.

145
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,722
We both want to do it.

146
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,724
Reason number four--

147
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,813
Please, Lucy, come on. Please.

148
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,817
I'm, I'm begging you.
Please, let's just do it.

149
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,529
- Okay, yeah, we can do it.
- Yeah?.

150
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,698
Okay, so let's--

151
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,204
- I'll go this way.
- Okay, I'm going this way.

152
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,206
Let's do this.

153
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:54,423
Please don't laugh.
You're killing this.

154
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,093
- Your first time should be special.
- Yeah, this is special!

155
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,096
Listen, do you want to spend
the rest ofyour life...

156
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,599
knowing that you did it for the
first time with your lab partner?.

157
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,602
Yes, yes, I do.
And I'll tell you why.

158
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,897
Because you know what it's like
for a guy to go to college a virgin?.

159
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,399
No, I'm telling you
they, they--

160
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,736
They're ostracized!
They treat them like lepers!

161
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,362
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:23,327
- What's up, Mimi?. How's the fetus?.
- Drop dead.

163
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,997
- Is it mine or what?.
- I can't believe we went out.

164
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:30,334
- I'm trying to do the right thing.
- Yeah?. What's the right thing?.

165
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,920
Ignoring me
for the past five months?.

166
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,507
Letting your friends call me a ho?.
Spreading rumors?.

167
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:39,301
I'm repeating what I heard,
that you let some guy...

168
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,429
do you in his car
over Christmas break.

169
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,099
Jerk.

170
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,732
It's ten paces
on the other side.

171
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,320
- What are you doing here?.
- Where's Lucy?.

172
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,113
She's not comin'.

173
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,036
- You have a flashlight?. Good.
- Gimme back my flashlight!

174
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:20,300
Let's just get this
over with, okay?.

175
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:38,777
God, I don't even remember
what we put in here.

176
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,779
Me either.

177
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,657
Here, hold this
for a second, Lucy.

178
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,755
My Bridal Barbie!

179
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,466
She was my wish.

180
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,219
- You're gettin' your wish.
- I know.

181
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,724
Lucy, I think this is yours.

182
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,143
- My locket.
- What did you wish for?.

183
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:16,064
I wanted to find my mom.

184
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:17,774
Did you ever find her?.

185
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,821
No, she lives in Arizona and my pop
doesn't think it's a good idea, so--

186
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:26,116
What did you wish for?.

187
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,872
- A key chain?.
- No, the world.

188
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:35,209
That I was gonna get out
of this crappy town...

189
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,544
go all the way to California...

190
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:42,132
put my feet
in the Pacific Ocean.

191
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:45,260
There's a wish that's not
coming true for a while.

192
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:49,348
- A lot you know, Kit.
- What's that supposed to mean?.

193
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,772
Slide Records recording contest?.

194
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,859
- So?.
- So I'm going on Sunday.

195
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,988
You're going to California
to audition for a record company?.

196
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,116
- Yeah.
- You're pregnant.

197
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,119
- So?. I'll wear something slimming.
- And what?.

198
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,455
You thinkyou're gonna become
this big, fat, pregnant star?.

199
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:17,334
- I have a pretty good voice.
- How are you gonna get there?.

200
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,380
- I found a ride with this guy.
- What?. No, that is crazy.

201
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,383
You can't go to Los Angeles
by yourselfwith some guy.

202
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:29,179
So?. Then come with me. I'll sing
lead, and you can sing backups.

203
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,224
- It's not something we should do.
- It's stupid is what it is.

204
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,060
Okay, fine.
You know what?.

205
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,688
You can just forget
all your past!

206
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,359
Oh, wow.

207
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:48,365
- Oh, my goodness. Look at us!
- Let me see.

208
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,326
- I was so chubby.
- Singing.

209
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:57,833
- I have to go meet my friends.
- Yeah, it's getting late.

210
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,086
Yeah.

211
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,258
Hey, you guys.

212
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:10,721
I'm leaving Sunday at 7:00 a.m.
ifyou all wanna come.

213
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,231
What do you mean you're not
coming home for the summer?.

214
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,109
Dylan, listen to me,
you have to come home.

215
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:28,071
Because! I haven't seen you
since Christmas.

216
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,073
Don't you miss me?.

217
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:34,077
- Excuse me.
- Dad, customer!

218
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,413
Dylan, we have to plan
the wedding.

219
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,207
All right.

220
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,585
I love you--
Dylan?.

221
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,139
- Hey, darlin'.
- Hey, Pop.

222
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,768
Dr.Johnson called today.
Good news.

223
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,978
Got me a job at the hospital?.

224
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,397
All those discounts I gave him
finally paid off.

225
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,775
- Cool.
- Yep.

226
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,778
Can I askyou a question?.

227
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,488
It's about Mother.

228
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,955
- Has she ever tried to see me?.
- No, she hasn't.

229
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,124
I was thinking,
maybe she's afraid to visit me.

230
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,794
Luce, you do not have
to feel any guilt...

231
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,630
about your mother leaving us.

232
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,465
This is not about us.

233
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,593
She was the one who walked out
on a three-year-old.

234
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:35,180
She's the one that should
feel guilty. All right?.

235
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,432
All right.

236
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,037
Nobody brings four suitcases
on a road trip.

237
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:43,373
Look, Dylan asked me
to go see him in LA...

238
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,084
and I can't get there
looking like a skank.

239
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,670
You better hope it all fits.

240
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,756
It will, okay?.

241
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,013
I'm not going to the audition.
You can drop me off in Arizona.

242
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,557
- Fine.
- Fine.

243
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:04,728
- Fine. Shotgun.
- Yeah, right. I'm sitting up front.

244
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,316
You must be Lucy.

245
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,776
Yeah.

246
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,864
So you're taking us to L.A.?.

247
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,408
Yeah. I'll get your bag.

248
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,497
- You okay?. Sorry.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

249
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:27,793
- Move it, Ben! Let's go!
- I'll get the door foryou.

250
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,093
Hey, who's the guy?.

251
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:39,513
That's just Ben.
He's really cool.

252
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,225
Let's hit it.

253
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,219
Where's the bathroom?.

254
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,972
Second door.
There's no soap.

255
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,319
What's the deal with Lucy?.

256
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:38,947
- What, are you hot for her?.
- No.

257
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:44,411
I wouldn't even try, Ben.
Seriously, she's not like us.

258
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:46,497
She's way out ofyour league.

259
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,628
Want a chip?.

260
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,423
Get outta here.

261
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,351
What are you doin'?.

262
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,145
- What's with this music?.
- Well, I like it.

263
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:12,481
Can we listen to something else
for ten minutes?.

264
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,275
No.

265
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,277
Come on, Ben, please?.

266
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:18,987
Be a nice guy.

267
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,823
Okay, five minutes.
Just five minutes.

268
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,325
Thankyou.

269
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,498
I don't wanna be a fool

270
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:32,501
In this game fortwo

271
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:36,672
So I'm leavingyou behind

272
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:40,467
Bye, bye, bye
Don't make it tough

273
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:43,345
I've had enough

274
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:46,515
Bye, bye

275
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,142
Baby

276
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:55,065
- Ben!
- I can't listen to this.

277
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,359
- You said five minutes.
- Forget it.

278
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,153
Like this is any better.

279
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,713
- Why are we stopped?.
- I'm tired.

280
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,381
Let someone else drive.

281
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,176
No, nobody drives
the cruiser but me.

282
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,387
- Okay, whatever.
- Where are we gonna sleep?.

283
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,182
There's a field.
I got a tent and sleeping bags.

284
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,226
A field?.

285
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,939
No, I don't sleep in a field.

286
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,525
I saw a sign for a Hilton
back there.

287
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,195
How much money do we have?.

288
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,368
I can't believe
you only brought $40.

289
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:53,290
I have expenses. I had to have
my homecoming dress custom-made.

290
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,584
I was voted queen, you know.

291
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,295
Oh, my dream come true.

292
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,132
- Did anybody make a plan?.
- What do you mean?.

293
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:05,385
How far you'll drive each day?.
Which towns you'll stop in?.

294
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,096
How much gas money you'll need?.

295
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,099
Okay.

296
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:15,771
We have $486, right?.
Which means...

297
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,107
for food, gas--

298
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,402
Is it enough?.

299
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,155
It's gonna be tight.

300
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,453
Oh, my gosh.

301
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:34,665
It's a love room.

302
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,626
Oh, man!

303
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,294
Look at the walls!

304
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:42,130
- I'm not sleeping here!
- This is what we can afford.

305
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:44,716
Is this run by the hour?.
I'm not sleeping here.

306
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:47,135
- Where you gonna sleep?.
- I don't know.

307
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:50,806
This place is disgusting.
I'll take this bed.

308
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,151
So how come
you're going to L.A.?.

309
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,158
My uncle might have
a job for me there...

310
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:13,829
so I'm gonna check it out
and if I like it, I'll move there.

311
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:17,332
What about your band?.
Don't you have a band?.

312
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:20,836
No, I was just filling in the
other night. I don't have a band.

313
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,842
Mimi said that she didn't think
you'd come with us on the trip.

314
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,637
Neither did I.

315
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,307
You sorry you did?.

316
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,684
Not so far.

317
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,735
Well, good night.

318
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,737
Good night.

319
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,718
Hey! It's freakin' cold!

320
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,763
- We're in here.
- I'm in here.

321
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:15,390
I just need
to brush my teeth.

322
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,943
- What are you doing?.
- You're so touchy.

323
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:31,240
Mimi, how do you know Ben?.

324
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:35,577
- Just from around.
- Gosh, don't you think he's cute?.

325
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:39,748
- He's all right.
- I can't believe he was in jail.

326
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:42,751
- What?.
- Yeah!

327
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:46,421
He like killed a guy.
What?. That's what I heard.

328
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,966
Excuse me?.
He killed somebody?.

329
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:54,221
No, he did not kill anybody--
I don't think.

330
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:58,058
Okay, he had a car, he was
coming to L.A. Don't be upset.

331
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:02,145
I'm on a road trip with a killer and
you're telling me not to be upset?.

332
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:05,399
- He'll hearyou.
- Oh, my God.

333
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,282
What's up?.

334
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,747
Do you know him at all?.

335
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:24,459
He used to hang out with some
of the guys at the trailer park.

336
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,755
So he may have
killed someone, okay?.

337
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:33,343
So what?. He did his time.
He paid his debt to society.

338
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,971
Oh, my God.

339
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:44,354
Ready to go?.

340
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,356
Yeah.

341
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,319
Hey, you wanna ride up front
with me today?.

342
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:54,615
No, that's okay.
The backseat's fine. It's okay.

343
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,951
- I'll check us out, okay?.
- Yeah.

344
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,884
- I'll be back.
- I'll come with ya.

345
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:16,094
No, it's okay, I'm fine.

346
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,848
- Will you please get me some chips?.
- No, Mimi.

347
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:21,517
Open the door.

348
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,189
I'll get my own chips.

349
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:33,487
Y'all, wait for me!

350
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:43,705
So when he came home
last Christmas, he proposed.

351
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:47,000
He's comin' home as soon as
he's done with school next spring.

352
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,878
You're seriously
gonna marry that loser?.

353
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,922
You don't even know him.

354
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,387
- What's wrong?.
- Nothing. It just kicked, is all.

355
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,556
- Can I feel it?.
- Ifyou want.

356
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,933
It kicked again.

357
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:06,770
- What about Kurt?.
- What about Kurt?.

358
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:10,399
- He's the father, isn't he?.
- Yes, Kurt's the father.

359
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:14,194
But it wasn't working out,
so I dumped him.

360
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,114
You're gonna raise this baby
all by yourself?.

361
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:20,993
I'm gonna go wait in the car
with Ben, all right?.

362
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,203
That's so typical of her.

363
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:27,249
She's not thinkin' about her future.
How's she gonna get by with a baby?.

364
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,918
Well, she brought this
upon herself.

365
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,796
What?.

366
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,936
- Hello.
- Hi, Pop.

367
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,606
Sneaking away in
the middle of the night?.

368
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,066
I'm very upset with you.
Dr.Johnson went...

369
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,444
to a great deal of trouble
to get you that job.

370
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:59,156
- I'm sorry, okay?.
- Sorry?

371
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:02,701
You are coming back now! And
you will regard that as a command!

372
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,953
You're usually so levelheaded...

373
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:08,290
andyou pull a stunt like this,
I am so surprised atyou.

374
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:11,251
You worked so hard. Areyou
gonna start slacking offnow?

375
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:31,188
What are you writing there?.

376
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:32,981
Stuff.

377
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,322
Are you mad at me or something?.

378
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,950
Why would I be mad at you?.
I don't even know you.

379
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:50,207
- No!
- Oh, no, it sounds bad.

380
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:53,168
Look at all that smoke.

381
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,308
What's wrong with it, Ben?.

382
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:11,562
It's the head gasket, I think.

383
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:14,398
- Give me your shirt.
- Here.

384
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,527
Whoa! What are you doing?.

385
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,946
Nobody touches this except
for specialists and myself.

386
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,907
Because it's an antique
and I don't want people to--

387
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:28,245
- It's your radiator.
- No, it's the head gasket.

388
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:34,001
No, your radiator's cracked.
What year it this?. '73.

389
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:37,838
Oh, that's like 350,
plus labor.

390
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:41,758
Great! Great!

391
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,562
I'm hungry.

392
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:56,732
How long does it take
to get a tow truck?.

393
00:30:56,815 --> 00:31:00,777
- Ben's only been gone two hours.
- I'm so hungry.

394
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:04,615
Won't you stop saying that?.
We heard you. You're hungry.

395
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,242
So what?.

396
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:15,292
We don't have $350.
Even if he gets a tow truck...

397
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,544
we don't have enough money
to get the car fixed.

398
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:22,591
I'm gonna be stuck here in--
Where the hell am I?. Where am I?.

399
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:23,967
Louisiana.

400
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:27,554
Stuck in some
butt-hole town, Louisiana.

401
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:29,723
I am never gonna get to LA
to see Dylan.

402
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,975
He's gonna be so upset.

403
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,770
Whatever.

404
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,605
Excuse me?.

405
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,732
Could you be more self-centered?.

406
00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:45,072
- You're just jealous.
- What?.

407
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:49,618
I'm not blind. I know how girls
like you looked at me in school.

408
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:52,287
You would've given anything
to trade places with me.

409
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,331
Girls like me?.

410
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,626
I can't help it if I'm popular,
so just lay off.

411
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,922
Girls like me?.

412
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,300
I didn't make the rules, Mimi.
It's not my fault...

413
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,553
everyone thinks
you're a trailer-trash skeeze.

414
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,306
- Stop it!
- Don't touch me like that!

415
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,892
- Guys, don't!
- You're pregnant!

416
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,186
You're a redneck!

417
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:20,524
Girls! Mimi! Stop!

418
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:26,822
Stop it! Stop!
I'm so sick of the two ofyou...

419
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,116
bitching and fighting
every damn second of the day!

420
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:32,119
For once,
would you just shut up?.

421
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:35,706
I don't know why the hell I asked
the two ofyou to come on this trip.

422
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,000
We don't belong together.

423
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,669
This was a mistake, okay?.

424
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:46,425
I'm sorry, partner,
that's the best I can do.

425
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,014
It's a cracked radiator.

426
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,561
He said he'd get it ready
by tomorrow.

427
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,646
How will we get the money
to pay for it?.

428
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,067
I have an idea.

429
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,236
I'm gonna call my father
and have him come get me.

430
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,322
You're leaving?.

431
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,574
This trip's over.

432
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,410
Wait, I have an idea!

433
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:16,538
You know what?.
I'm sick ofyour ideas, Mimi.

434
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,582
I should've known you'd make
a mess of this trip.

435
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:23,879
Fine, run home to your daddy,
but don't try and blame this on me.

436
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:37,893
Lucy, I haven't asked you
for anything in a really long time.

437
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:41,104
But I'm gonna askyou to stay.

438
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:45,275
Please hang up the damn phone
and just stay with us!

439
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,236
Come on, Lucy.

440
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:50,572
Hello?

441
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,745
I do.
I have a really good idea.

442
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,957
Yeah, it better be good.

443
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,768
Okay, I have something
to say.

444
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:24,606
I know we're not all getting along,
but tonight's important.

445
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,025
We really need the money.

446
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,530
So could we just be civil
and get through this?. Okay?.

447
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,240
Okay.

448
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:40,414
All right!
Y'all ready?.

449
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:42,457
Yeah.

450
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,629
- That's cute.
- Thankyou.

451
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:54,928
Wait.

452
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,348
It's all the tips
we can get, right?.

453
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,142
- Mm-hmm.
- So?.

454
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,186
Ifwe wanna put on a show,
we have to be sexy.

455
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:05,189
Now you're talkin'.

456
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:11,778
- Whatcha got?.
- Let me wear those feathers.

457
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:14,698
All right, next contestant's
a brand-new act.

458
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,951
And for all tourists that don't
know how the rules go in my club...

459
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,162
here it is, plain and simple.

460
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,289
You're the judge.
Ifyou hate 'em, tell 'em.

461
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,374
Ifyou like 'em, pay 'em.

462
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,835
We got baskets going around.
Put the money in there.

463
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:30,005
Be loud, be fair and be generous
ifyou like what you hear.

464
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:32,299
So, come on, give 'em
a warm welcome.

465
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,703
- They lookyoung.
- It's past their bedtime.

466
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:13,173
I saw him dancing there
by the record machine

467
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:16,885
Get off the stage!

468
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,724
- Mimi, come on!
- I can't do it.

469
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:28,564
- You can do it.
- I thought so, but I can't.

470
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,650
- Please do it for me.
- You just gotta go do it.

471
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:35,070
- No, you do it.
- I don't know if I can.

472
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:38,907
You've got the best voice.
Come on, please for me.

473
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:41,702
- Okay, okay.
- Thankyou.

474
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,912
- You okay?.
- No.

475
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:08,729
I saw him dancing there
by the record machine

476
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:13,901
I knew he must have been
about 17

477
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:18,322
The beat was going strong

478
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:21,992
Playing my favorite song

479
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:27,998
I could tell it wouldn 't be long
till he was with me, yeah, me

480
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:33,462
I could tell it wouldn 't be long
till he was with me singing

481
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:38,592
I love rock and roll so put
another dime in the jukebox, baby

482
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:44,765
I love rock and roll so come
and take some time and dance with me

483
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:52,272
He smiled so I got up
and asked for his name

484
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:58,362
But that don 't matter
he said 'cause it's all the same

485
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:01,114
He said, can I take you home

486
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:05,911
Where we can be alone

487
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:08,872
And next we were movin ' on
and he was with me

488
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,958
Yeah, me

489
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:16,338
And next we were movin ' on and
he was with me, yeah, me, singing

490
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:34,523
I love rock and roll

491
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:37,860
'Cause it soothes my soul
Yeah

492
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,903
I love rock and roll

493
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:42,406
Yeah

494
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:57,754
And we were moving on
and singing that same old song

495
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,715
Yeah, me

496
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,366
Roll, roll, roll

497
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,434
Now.

498
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:55,270
It's so amazing.

499
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:11,453
Lucy, come here.

500
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,125
- How much is it?.
- Enough for the car and the trip.

501
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,670
Perfect.

502
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,801
You wanna come dance with us?.

503
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:29,763
No. We should get outta here before
somebody realizes you're underage.

504
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:32,349
Come on, just a
little bit longer, please?.

505
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:35,644
- All right, you go ahead.
- Thankyou.

506
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,319
- Hey, she with you?.
- What?.

507
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:47,447
Is she your girl?.

508
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:49,449
No.

509
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:52,661
Yeah. Watch this.

510
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,342
Move your hands, please.

511
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:13,056
We're gonna get a little freaky.
Hey, what's up, baby?. Come on.

512
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,642
- What's wrong?.
- Will you stop it?.

513
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:19,021
Excuse me. Hey, I don't think
she wants to dance.

514
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:22,149
I think she does.
You should mind your own business.

515
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:25,068
- Will you leave me alone?.
- Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

516
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:29,364
My nose!

517
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:34,870
Let's go.

518
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,544
Oh, damn!

519
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,087
Is this livin' or what?.

520
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,673
There's a mini-bar!

521
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:52,429
Y'all, you could swim
in this bathtub!

522
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:55,390
Look, I'm--

523
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,353
I'm not mad at you
for what happened there. Okay?.

524
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,271
There's bathrobes!

525
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:04,399
- Where are you going?.
-Just going out.

526
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:09,822
Are any ofyou guys tired,
'cause it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm wired!

527
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:14,618
- Who wants some of mama's punch?.
- Me, please.

528
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:17,621
- Madame.
- Madame.

529
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:40,185
Go, Lucy! Go, Lucy!

530
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:48,068
What are you doing?.

531
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:51,321
You go, girl!

532
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:00,664
I have seen one, y'all.

533
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:04,501
Yeah, but have you touched one?.

534
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:09,882
She has!
Give us the details!

535
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:13,510
It's always the quiet ones.

536
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:16,263
Say it loud. Say you
touched one and you're proud!

537
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:19,183
Lucy touched one!
She did!

538
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:32,196
Okay, the best thing
that ever happened to you.

539
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:34,406
- That's easy.
- What?.

540
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:38,577
Reaching my goal weight.

541
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:42,206
Third year at fat camp,
the summer before eighth grade.

542
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:45,709
Wait, that camp you went to
every summer was a fat camp?.

543
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,965
Yes, and I loved it.

544
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:52,007
Yes, and I loved it.

545
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,259
For two months...

546
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:58,305
my mama wasn't around
to pick on me for being fat.

547
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,893
Being fat is just
unacceptable to her.

548
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:08,732
Okay. The worst thing
that ever happened to you.

549
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:11,360
That's even easier.
Reaching my goal weight.

550
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:13,195
- You said--
- It turns out...

551
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,824
that being prettier
than my mama...

552
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:19,451
is even more
unacceptable.

553
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,287
Oh,Jesus.

554
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:25,791
Yep.

555
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:30,003
One morning I woke up,
and she was gone.

556
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:33,090
Pop really wouldn't
say anything about it.

557
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:37,135
I thought she was coming back,
and Pop told me she wasn't.

558
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:40,889
They fought all the time.

559
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:44,351
You know, I think
that she just got fed up...

560
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:47,145
and took off
without even thinking.

561
00:44:47,271 --> 00:44:51,191
And after a while, it was
just too late to come back.

562
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,571
I know she wants to see me.

563
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,450
She's just scared, that's all.

564
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:05,706
I'm gonna be so sick later.

565
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:09,042
Mimi, be glad you're pregnant
and you couldn't act stupid with us.

566
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:13,797
That's not why I don't drink.
I just don't see the point in it.

567
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:15,591
So you never partied?.

568
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:20,095
Once.

569
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:23,849
Over Christmas.

570
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:28,645
There was one of those parties
at Hemmings Field.

571
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:32,983
And this guy
was drinking this beer...

572
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:37,905
and I remember
it was in a blue bottle.

573
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,950
And I was real mad
at Kurt because...

574
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:45,704
he blew me off again
to hang out with his friends.

575
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:50,000
So I had a few beers.

576
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:54,129
I had more than a few.

577
00:45:56,006 --> 00:46:00,052
This guy, you know, he seemed--
He seemed real nice...

578
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:03,222
'cause when I couldn't walk,
he offered to drive me home.

579
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:11,230
It's no big deal, Luce.
It happens to girls all the time.

580
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:13,816
Did you go to the police?.

581
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:16,068
No.

582
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:19,655
I'm from a trailer park.
I got drunk and got in his car.

583
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,783
So, Kurt's not the father?.

584
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:26,745
I saw this ad in a magazine.

585
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:32,584
So I called up this lawyer in
Atlanta, and she sent me this stuff.

586
00:46:32,668 --> 00:46:35,003
Um, all these pictures
and letters...

587
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:38,173
of all these people
who want babies.

588
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:40,717
- I was supposed to pick one.
- The guy...

589
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:45,305
what was his name?.

590
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,476
I don't know.

591
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:55,566
Why did we stop being friends?.

592
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:58,485
I don't know.
People drift apart.

593
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,322
Promise me we won't
drift apart again.

594
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:05,909
Come here.

595
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:10,497
And where have you been
all night?.

596
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:20,007
Thankyou.

597
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,509
For what you did
last night, I mean.

598
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:24,761
Thanks.

599
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:30,225
Scoot over.

600
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:41,487
I'm never drinkin' again. Honest.

601
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:43,614
This burrito is so good.

602
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:45,908
Don't mention food.

603
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:50,913
- What are you doing?.
- Chilling.

604
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,302
- Wake him up.
- Y'all, he's been driving all day.

605
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:09,473
- We can't just stay here.
- We should just let him sleep.

606
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:11,934
- Uh-uh.
- We'll let him sleep.

607
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,479
Lucy, get his keys.

608
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:18,524
He told us we couldn't drive
his car. I can't do that.

609
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,193
Why not?. It's not like we're
gonna drive this over a cliff.

610
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:24,988
- It's stupid to stay here.
- I'll drive.

611
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:26,615
Get his keys.

612
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,618
- Yeah, get his keys.
- Why do I have to get his keys?.

613
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:34,331
Because Kit and I voted
and you lost.

614
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:35,833
Get the keys.

615
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:38,544
Yeah, Lucy, get his keys.

616
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:50,556
- This is stealing.
- It's not stealing if he's in the car.

617
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:53,100
No, it's kidnapping.

618
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:02,317
Okay, stop.

619
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:08,282
Oh, I got it.

620
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,209
Go, go.

621
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:33,640
You failed driver's ed,
didn't you?.

622
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:35,851
Maybe.

623
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:39,605
- Move over.
- Oh, God.

624
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,900
Guys, smile for the camera.

625
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:59,416
Go ahead, turn it on, turn it on.

626
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:09,092
Let's go, girls

627
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:19,394
I'm goin'out tonight
and I'm feeling all right

628
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,440
I'm gonna let
it all hang out

629
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:25,734
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice

630
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:27,236
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice

631
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:31,156
Yeah, I'm gonna scream and shout

632
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:42,584
Get a little outta line

633
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:46,171
I ain 't gonna act
politically correct

634
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:50,551
I only wanna have a good time

635
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:54,680
The best thing about being a woman

636
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:58,976
Is the prerogative
to have a little fun and

637
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:03,605
Oh, oh, oh
Go totally crazy

638
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:07,818
- Hi! Did you have a good nap?.
- Yeah.

639
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:09,987
Stop, stop the car.

640
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,031
Don't be mad. You looked so sweet
when you were sleeping.

641
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:16,535
- We just didn't wanna wake you.
- Stop the car.

642
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:19,121
- It's against the law to park here.
- It's my car.

643
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:21,832
- We're almost at an exit.
- Stop the damn car!

644
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:46,899
- Mimi, go talk to him.
- Uh-uh, you go talk to him.

645
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:49,818
- Nobody's gonna go talk to him.
- I know, he's mad.

646
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:53,489
And he has killed before.

647
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:56,992
Mimi, you said
he didn't kill anyone.

648
00:51:57,117 --> 00:52:01,288
- I said I thought he didn't.
- Oh, my God.

649
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:08,629
- It's okay, I'll go.
- I'm sorry.

650
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,426
God!

651
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,304
Be careful, Lucy.

652
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:26,772
- We're sorry.
- I've been in a car full of chicks.

653
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:30,067
Do you have any idea what it's like
being surrounded by girls?.

654
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:35,739
Being a girl yourself,
I know, stupid question.

655
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:39,493
But I'm a guy, okay?.
I'm a guy.Just a guy.

656
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:43,956
And I have been listening
to girl talk and watching you do...

657
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:46,458
your girl things for days.

658
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:49,336
I'm not complaining, 'cause,
let's face it, I'm outnumbered.

659
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,338
But that's my car.

660
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:54,383
It's my car, and it's just--

661
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:01,223
It's the one thing that hasn't
been taken over by chicks.

662
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:06,603
- Okay?.
- Okay.

663
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,846
- Ben?.
- Yeah?.

664
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,140
Were you really in jail?.

665
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:47,478
Yeah, I was.

666
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:49,813
- So you killed a guy?.
- What?.

667
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:53,108
Who said I killed a guy?.

668
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:57,404
Everybody back home.

669
00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:02,242
Oh, man.
No, I didn't kill a guy.

670
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,912
What did you do then?.

671
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:10,542
I was in college, and I get
this call from my stepsister.

672
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:15,464
She wants me to come get her 'cause
my stepdad is beating her up.

673
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:17,674
My mom can't stop him, so...

674
00:54:17,758 --> 00:54:21,386
I drive home in
the middle of the night...

675
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:24,973
and she throws her things out
the window and climbs out...

676
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:26,975
and then I drive her back
to school in Ohio with me.

677
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,562
- And you went to jail for that?.
- That's the thing.

678
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:32,523
There's this law...

679
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:36,151
against driving a child that's
not a relative across state lines...

680
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:38,946
and my stepdad of course
pressed charges.

681
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:41,865
But, you know, it's okay.
I only got six months...

682
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:44,201
and I had to stay in Ohio
for a year's probation.

683
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:47,746
My sister got to go live
with her mom.

684
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:56,129
You all really thought
I killed a guy?.

685
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:59,174
Yeah.

686
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:05,347
What were you thinking getting
into a car with a homicidal maniac?.

687
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:25,909
- Why are we stopping?.
- You'll see.

688
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:40,716
- Mimi, you okay?.
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

689
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,139
Look.

690
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,979
It's like you have to whisper.

691
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:57,649
Hello!

692
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:10,662
Man. We gotta make time. The next
hotel is still an hour away.

693
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:14,541
Ben, do you have enough
sleeping bags for all of us?.

694
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:16,668
You serious?.

695
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:19,379
You really want to camp here?.

696
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:20,797
Yeah.

697
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:25,010
It sounds like fun.

698
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:31,058
You gotta keep your thumb
on the outside like this.

699
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,853
Right. Now, the trick is...

700
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:38,398
you don't want to let him know
that you're gonna hit him.

701
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:42,069
Maybe like look away first.

702
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:46,406
And then, when he least expects it,
you throw your whole body into it.

703
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:53,080
What are you doing to her?.

704
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:55,082
I'm teaching her how to fight
because every girl...

705
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:58,043
should know how
to throw a decent punch.

706
00:56:58,126 --> 00:56:59,545
That was decent.

707
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:01,588
I'm gonna go to bed.

708
00:57:01,672 --> 00:57:04,508
I'm gonna go to the ladies room.
Where is it again?.

709
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:07,511
Third bush after the rock
over there.

710
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,972
- This one?.
- That one, yeah.

711
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:17,020
What are you always
writing in there?.

712
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:21,358
Poems, mostly.

713
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:23,986
Can I hear one?.

714
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:29,116
Okay. One.
But you can't laugh.

715
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:37,082
"I used to think I had
the answers to everything...

716
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:39,626
but now I know that life
doesn't always go my way.

717
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:43,589
It feels like I'm caught in the
middle, and that's when I realize...

718
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:47,092
that I'm not a girl,
and not yet a woman.

719
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:50,971
All I need is time,
just a moment that's mine.

720
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:54,349
And while I'm in between,
I'm not a girl."

721
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:00,189
I liked it.

722
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:01,899
Really?.

723
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:04,109
Yeah, really, I like it.

724
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:12,159
- What?.
- You got ash on your face.

725
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,286
- Where?.
- I'll get it.

726
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:16,288
There.

727
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:26,924
- What's wrong?.
- What happened?.

728
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,301
Something bit my ass.

729
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:32,387
- Let me see.
- It's a snake bite.

730
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:34,389
No, Mimi,
that's a mosquito bite.

731
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:38,393
Don't look!

732
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:41,897
- How could I not?. It's nothing.
- But it could've been a snake.

733
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:44,733
All right! We are outta here
at the crack of dawn.

734
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:47,402
Nothing's biting my ass.

735
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:52,324
So we'll be in Tucson today?.

736
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:55,285
- Around 4:00, I think.
- Are you nervous?.

737
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:59,206
Should I call and tell her I'm
coming, or should I just show up?.

738
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:02,334
- I should just show up, right?.
- Surprise is always better.

739
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:05,587
She's gonna be
real happy to see you.

740
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:07,214
I hope so.

741
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:24,565
You'll call and tell me everything
about the audition, right?.

742
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:28,902
-You could still come with us.
-We don't leave town until tomorrow.

743
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:31,113
I'll be fine, okay?.

744
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:34,366
You know where we're staying
ifyou need us.

745
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:37,703
Bye.

746
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:43,709
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

747
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:46,003
I guess this is it.

748
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:50,799
I guess, yeah.

749
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:52,885
What?.

750
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:01,768
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

751
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:15,240
Can I help you?.

752
01:00:15,324 --> 01:00:18,327
It's me, Mama-- Lucy.

753
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,372
Come in.

754
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:37,888
You have a really nice house.

755
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,265
Thankyou, Lucy.

756
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:56,406
Tucson seems like
a really nice city.

757
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,325
It is.

758
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,035
Can I askyou
why you're here, Lucy?.

759
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:03,163
Can I askyou
why you're here, Lucy?.

760
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:06,667
I wanted to see you.

761
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,794
And why was that, Lucy?.

762
01:01:10,504 --> 01:01:12,381
Well, you're my mother.

763
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,393
Why do you keep
saying my name like that?.

764
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,526
Hold on a moment.

765
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:42,452
Hello?.

766
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:45,080
Sweetie, tell Joey's mommy I said
you could swim for another hour...

767
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:47,040
ifyou put on more sunscreen.

768
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:49,042
I don't want you to burn.

769
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:52,254
Daddy will pickyou up at 5:00.
I love you.

770
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:05,809
- I have brothers?.
- Well, yes.

771
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:10,063
- How old are they?.
- Ten and seven.

772
01:02:12,024 --> 01:02:13,901
Do they know about me?.

773
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:21,325
Lucy, I think we need
to have a talk.

774
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,374
Whoa
Wait, seven, eight.

775
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,418
Five, six--

776
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:49,603
Come on in. Here.

777
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:51,605
- What happened?.
- What's wrong?.

778
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,525
- Get some towels, please?.
- I'm fine.

779
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:57,778
So, Luce, you got to see
your mom, right?.

780
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:02,115
- Yeah, I saw her.
- And what happened?.

781
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:22,719
Just thought you might want
some dry clothes.

782
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:24,721
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

783
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:29,601
I'm fine.

784
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:31,603
I'm okay.

785
01:03:35,149 --> 01:03:37,442
I know.

786
01:03:39,403 --> 01:03:41,280
Really, I'm okay.

787
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,128
What happened?.

788
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:04,219
She said...

789
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:07,681
that she never wanted me.

790
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:17,858
She said that my father
made her have me...

791
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,446
and that I was
just a mistake.

792
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:44,384
I look like her, you know?.

793
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:49,473
I have her eyes and her hands.

794
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:51,809
It's her loss, Luce.

795
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:55,270
It's weird though, you know?.

796
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:58,941
I don't have a mother.

797
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:00,776
Well, you have us.

798
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:02,611
Yeah.

799
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:22,840
Trying to call your dad?.

800
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:26,051
I can't.
I will in a minute.

801
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:27,845
You got that poem
you read me?.

802
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:31,014
- Yeah.
- Can I see it?.

803
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:33,183
Yeah, sure.

804
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:36,395
It's right here.

805
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:41,608
What are you doing?.

806
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:46,196
Stop worrying so much.
Come on. I made you something.

807
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,614
Okay.

808
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:55,289
This is my surprise?.

809
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,499
Wouldn't it be sad if it was?.

810
01:05:57,583 --> 01:06:00,169
Like if I just totally sucked
at cheering people up.

811
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,716
I wrote some music
foryour poem.

812
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,262
Will you play it for me?.

813
01:06:10,387 --> 01:06:12,264
Will you sing?.

814
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:20,647
Just use this part
as the chorus.

815
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:35,746
- Yeah.
- Like that?.

816
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:59,686
Go my way
Like that?.

817
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:05,943
It feels like I'm caught
in the middle

818
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:07,945
A little low there.

819
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:12,574
That's when I realize

820
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:16,119
I'm not a girl

821
01:07:18,914 --> 01:07:21,875
And not yet a woman

822
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:28,799
All I need is time

823
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:32,219
A moment that is mine

824
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:36,557
While I'm in between

825
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,561
I'm not a girl

826
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:52,948
Thank you.

827
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:56,577
It's no trouble at all.

828
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:43,707
Hello, you have reached Pete
and Lucy. Please leave a message.

829
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:50,714
Hi, Pop. I'm just calling to say
that I'm fine, okay?.

830
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:55,886
And you were right about Mama.
You were right.

831
01:08:56,011 --> 01:09:01,517
I love you, okay?.
I'm fine. Bye.

832
01:09:08,607 --> 01:09:12,402
I'm not the kind ofgirl
you take home

833
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:17,241
Ifit makesyou happy

834
01:09:17,324 --> 01:09:21,537
It can't be that bad

835
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:26,875
Ifit makesyou happy

836
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:30,921
Then why the hell
are you so sad

837
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:37,344
Ifit makesyou happy

838
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:42,224
It can 't be that bad

839
01:09:42,307 --> 01:09:46,979
Ifit makesyou happy

840
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:51,984
Then why the hell
are you so sad

841
01:10:31,482 --> 01:10:33,775
It's too cold. It's freezing!

842
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:40,240
Don't even! Don't.

843
01:10:42,493 --> 01:10:45,746
- I can't believe we're here.
- I know.

844
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:51,293
Ben, you know, there are
a lot of colleges here in L.A.

845
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:56,882
Hey, what if I didn't go back?.

846
01:10:57,007 --> 01:11:00,844
I could go to school here.
I mean...

847
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:05,349
why don't I do something
for me for once, you know?.

848
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:07,392
I wanna stay.

849
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:09,394
I'm gonna stay.

850
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:14,191
Good.

851
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:17,528
Look how happy she is.

852
01:11:22,908 --> 01:11:27,746
Fill this out, turn it in over
there. The audition is in six days.

853
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:30,082
Wait. Where do we turn it in?.

854
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:33,168
You turn it in over there.

855
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:35,420
Fill this out--

856
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:38,465
- What about music?.
- You know what?.

857
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:41,844
I'll get some flyers printed up.
I know a few guys in L.A.

858
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:44,638
I'll try to put a band together,
and I'll see you at the hotel.

859
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:48,183
- Okay. Great.
- Hey, where you going?.

860
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:02,865
Baby?. Hi, it's me!
Guess where I am.

861
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,908
L.A.!

862
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:09,329
Okay. All right.
Then I'll come to you.

863
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:13,500
All right.
Then how 'bout tonight?.

864
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,298
Then how 'bout
tomorrow morning?.

865
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:25,053
Dylan, I'm in Los Angeles!

866
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:27,806
I came to see you!

867
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,810
Fine.

868
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:34,897
What am I gonna say?.
Fine.

869
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:38,942
Me too.

870
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:50,579
He's really busy with finals
and all. Yeah.

871
01:12:50,662 --> 01:12:52,372
We're fine.

872
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,419
So who wants to go sightseeing?.

873
01:12:57,503 --> 01:13:00,339
- I do!
- Okay! All right. Lucy?.

874
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:03,509
I'm kinda tired.

875
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:08,931
Yeah, I'm pretty beat.

876
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:11,558
Well, I need you.
We can't drive your car, remember?.

877
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:15,270
Don't wreck it.

878
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:17,356
All right!

879
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:29,451
Wait, we're on Melrose--

880
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:32,704
I thought we were going
to see the Hollywood sign.

881
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:36,625
- We will.
- But I think it's back that way.

882
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:40,003
I know. But we're gonna
make a stop first, okay?.

883
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:43,590
Kit, you can
see Dylan tomorrow.

884
01:13:45,759 --> 01:13:47,761
- Kit, come on. Let's go back.
- No.

885
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:52,182
- Kit, let's go back. Please!
- No! I want to see him now.

886
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:08,991
Are you sure?.

887
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:11,952
Yeah.

888
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:56,163
Kit, I really should wait
in the car.

889
01:14:58,165 --> 01:15:01,084
- How do I look?.
- You look really great.

890
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,420
Don't you guys want
to be alone together?.

891
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:09,051
I want you with me.
Come on.

892
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:21,730
- Surprise!
- Honey.

893
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:24,566
Hi! Oh, baby.

894
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:27,069
Kit-Kat, I thought we were
gonna make plans tomorrow.

895
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:30,906
Oh, I know. I just really wanted
to see you. This is my friend, Mimi.

896
01:15:33,784 --> 01:15:36,245
You two know each other?.

897
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,413
Yeah. From school.
Right, Mimi?.

898
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:41,667
- Right.
- Yeah.

899
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:47,422
Oh. Well, aren't you gonna
invite us in?.

900
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:51,260
Yeah, I would, Kitty-Kat, but I've
got this friend here, and he's--

901
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:53,178
you know, he's really upset,
and we're supposed to, like...

902
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:55,264
you know,
hang out or whatever.

903
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,892
Do you need money for the pizza?.

904
01:16:00,561 --> 01:16:04,565
- Your friend sounds really upset.
- Wait, Kit, hold on.

905
01:16:05,983 --> 01:16:09,611
- Oh, God.
- Who's she?.

906
01:16:11,572 --> 01:16:14,032
We're supposed to be
getting married.

907
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:17,953
We're supposed to be
getting married.

908
01:16:18,078 --> 01:16:20,873
I was-- I was gonna tell you,
I just, you know...

909
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:23,292
didn't want to do it
over the phone.

910
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:24,793
Dylan, you gave me a ring.

911
01:16:24,877 --> 01:16:27,838
You proposed and gave me a ring!

912
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:29,631
Kit, I mean,
I'm sorry, you know?.

913
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:39,808
Oh, my God.

914
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:49,359
It was Dylan, wasn't it?.

915
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:53,489
It was you.
You were the guy at Christmas.

916
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:57,576
- Wasn't it?. It was him, huh?.
- What are you talking about?.

917
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:01,872
That night when you came over,
you had that rip in your shirt.

918
01:17:01,955 --> 01:17:05,751
- That was the night that he--
- Kit, what is your problem here?.

919
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:10,422
- Kit, I have to go.
- No, Mimi, come back here.

920
01:17:10,547 --> 01:17:14,259
I want him to admit it.
Admit it!

921
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:17,596
You're getting all worked up
over nothing, Kitty-Kat.

922
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:22,351
My name is not Kitty-Kat.
I am not your pet!

923
01:17:52,422 --> 01:17:53,799
Hello?.

924
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:13,026
- Excuse me, where's the phone?.
- It's right over there.

925
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:23,412
Yeah, can I make
a collect call, please?.

926
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:45,267
They said I lost the baby.

927
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:48,103
"Lost it."

928
01:18:49,188 --> 01:18:52,483
Like it was my keys
or something.

929
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:58,280
Isn't that the stupidest
damn thing you've ever heard?.

930
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:04,703
I'd decided to keep her.

931
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:10,459
I was standing on the beach...

932
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:15,464
and my toes were
in the Pacific Ocean...

933
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:19,760
and she kicked.

934
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:24,431
It was like this sign.

935
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:27,976
Don't touch me, Luce.
I'm already crying.

936
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:30,312
Okay.

937
01:19:32,523 --> 01:19:34,650
I would have made a good mom.

938
01:19:43,534 --> 01:19:45,869
Just what were you thinking,
running away...

939
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:48,789
with a pregnant girl!

940
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:50,791
Lucy, I'm waiting
for an answer.

941
01:19:50,874 --> 01:19:53,460
Do you know what it took
to come here?.

942
01:19:53,544 --> 01:19:56,880
I had to take cash out of savings
for plane fare and hotel.

943
01:19:56,964 --> 01:20:00,509
I worked hard to earn that money
for your college education.

944
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:01,969
I'm sorry.

945
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:11,520
So you made a mistake.
I understand.

946
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:17,276
Everybody makes mistakes.
You're forgiven.

947
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:19,736
I'm gonna take you girls back
to where you belong...

948
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:22,573
and we'll forget about
this whole crazy thing, all right?.

949
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:24,575
Okay.

950
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,618
Who's that boy you were with?.

951
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:30,038
How old is he anyway?. Is he the one
who put the crazy idea in your head?.

952
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,878
He just gave us a ride.

953
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:38,213
That's all.

954
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:46,889
Hey, sorry it took me so long.
We got a band.

955
01:20:47,014 --> 01:20:51,518
- What are you doing?.
- Packing.

956
01:20:51,602 --> 01:20:56,190
My father says I have
to move to his hotel, so--

957
01:20:56,273 --> 01:21:00,152
Until the audition?.
How are we gonna rehearse?.

958
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:02,529
I'm not going to the audition.

959
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:10,746
Look, I have to
go back with him, okay?.

960
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:16,293
Ben, he's my father, okay?.

961
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:18,128
I just can't--

962
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:23,091
And with everything happening
with Mimi, I just think I should go.

963
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,639
- No, I get it.
- Don't be like that.

964
01:21:29,765 --> 01:21:31,725
I get it. It's okay.

965
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:34,728
It's fine.

966
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:16,854
Did you see
how fast he went down?.

967
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,235
It's 'cause you threw your body
into that punch, like I taught you.

968
01:22:26,864 --> 01:22:28,532
You did really good.

969
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:33,328
Hey, come here.

970
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:36,540
Thankyou.

971
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:45,299
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

972
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:47,342
It's not your fault.

973
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:03,942
Got it?.

974
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:12,910
I can't believe
this trip is over.

975
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:16,163
I know. God, doesn't it feel like
we left home a million years ago?.

976
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:18,165
Yeah.

977
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:23,837
- Hey, y'all, thanks.
- For what?.

978
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:28,258
For coming on this trip with me.
Thankyou.

979
01:23:30,844 --> 01:23:33,138
Mimi and I were talking...

980
01:23:33,222 --> 01:23:34,389
and we were thinking--

981
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:37,142
That you need to stay
and go to the audition.

982
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:39,728
Guys, I can't do that.

983
01:23:39,853 --> 01:23:41,855
- I can't.
- You've got to.

984
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,775
Kit and I voted, and you lost,
so you've got to go.

985
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:53,408
All right, baby,
ready to head home?.

986
01:23:53,534 --> 01:23:56,954
- I'm coming.
- Ladies...

987
01:23:57,079 --> 01:23:58,622
let's roll.

988
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:03,919
Come on, let's go.

989
01:24:08,257 --> 01:24:10,175
We tried.

990
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:14,012
Here you go, buddy.

991
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:16,515
- Thankyou, sir.
- I'll take that, sweetie.

992
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:26,608
Good-bye, Lucy.

993
01:24:27,734 --> 01:24:29,111
Good-bye.

994
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:06,523
It's gonna feel good
to get back home, won't it?.

995
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:08,192
Look, honey...

996
01:25:09,568 --> 01:25:12,279
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

997
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:15,991
I wasn't angry at you.
I was angry at what you did.

998
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:18,118
- Okay?.
- Okay.

999
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:31,256
I don't want to be like her.

1000
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:35,010
We'll just get back home, and
everything'll be back to normal.

1001
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:37,095
You just wait and see.

1002
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:40,849
Don't make me do
what she did.

1003
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:47,314
Don't make me run.
Just let me go, okay?.

1004
01:25:59,243 --> 01:26:01,745
What are you--

1005
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:03,997
I used to think

1006
01:26:05,082 --> 01:26:09,503
I had the answers
to everything

1007
01:26:13,048 --> 01:26:16,844
But now I know

1008
01:26:16,969 --> 01:26:20,180
That life doesn't always

1009
01:26:20,264 --> 01:26:23,892
Go my way

1010
01:26:24,017 --> 01:26:25,477
Yeah

1011
01:26:25,602 --> 01:26:31,024
Feels like I'm caught
in the middle

1012
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:37,197
That's when I realize

1013
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:40,659
I'm not a girl

1014
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:46,331
Not yet a woman

1015
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,838
All I need is time

1016
01:26:52,921 --> 01:26:57,092
A moment that is mine

1017
01:26:57,217 --> 01:27:01,013
While I'm in between

1018
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:03,724
I'm not a girl

1019
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:09,980
There is no need
to protect me

1020
01:27:13,734 --> 01:27:16,904
It's time that I

1021
01:27:16,987 --> 01:27:20,449
L earned to face up to this

1022
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:26,288
On my own

1023
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:32,711
I've seen so much more
than you know now

1024
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:37,758
So don 't tell me
to shut my eyes

1025
01:28:06,662 --> 01:28:11,875
But ifyou look at me closely

1026
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,128
You will see it in my eyes

1027
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:20,968
This girl will always find

1028
01:28:21,051 --> 01:28:26,431
Her way

1029
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:32,980
I'm not a girl
Don 't tell me what to believe

1030
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:39,278
I'm just trying to find
the woman in me, yeah

1031
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,685
My baby!

1032
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:29,786
This time, we didn 't make
any wishes for the future.

1033
01:29:31,747 --> 01:29:34,458
We said good-bye to our past.

1034
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:38,128
Now, none of us has any idea
where life's gonna take us...

1035
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:40,506
'cause what we have is now.

1036
01:29:42,257 --> 01:29:44,092
And right now,
we have each other.

1037
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:16,416
- Let's do this thing!
- Action!
