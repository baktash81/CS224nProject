1
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,180
Swim trunks are loaded with detergents and
other hazardous chemicals harmful to fish.

2
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,165
Hi, Allison.

3
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,866
- Just quit my job at the aquarium.
- Heard you got fired.

4
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:53,242
Yeah. The aquarium's totally changed.
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

5
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,543
I got a lot
of great offers.

6
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,606
Things are really
starting to happen for me.

7
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,619
I was thinking maybe later if you weren't doing any...

8
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:04,418
- I mean if... When you're not working.
- I don't think so.

9
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,860
Okay, I guess I'll just take
some sea snails and be on my way.

10
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,401
No, no, a little lower.
The ones on the bottom.

11
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,061
Have a good nipple.

12
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,806
- <i>Ah, you have beautiful</i>
<i>skin, baby?</i>

13
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,037
Get some olive oil,
rub it all over you.

14
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,271
We'll have
a good time?

15
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,978
<i> Let's get him out of there. </i>

16
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,524
Try to keep your
goldfish in <i>this</i> bowl.

17
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,661
If you like, I could
stick around for awhile.

18
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,163
Every kid needs a father.

19
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,047
What the hell?

20
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,531
What the hell
are you doing?

21
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,974
There's a mongrel koi in there.
It's the most dangerous of all goldfish.

22
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,571
Do you have any ice?

23
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,581
Shoes off?

24
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,447
Respect the 18th century
Persian carpet.

25
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,857
Whoa!
What are those?

26
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,760
Medieval weapons.
I'm a collector.

27
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,594
They're worth twice as much
if they've killed somebody.

28
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,767
I collect
Canadian quarters.

29
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,330
I got about six of'em.

30
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,871
Would you like
anything to drink?

31
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,042
I wouldn't mind
a glass of...

32
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,916
Whoa.
What is that?

33
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,946
Is that a custom Living Color
anti-glare, retractable-top tank?

34
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,619
- I'm not sure.
- It is!

35
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,254
They assemble each one
of these by hand.

36
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,198
<i>Chinese tailbar lionfish. </i>
<i>He's a beaut!</i>

37
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,360
That's an $800 fish!

38
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,199
- Try a grand.
- Then you overpaid.

39
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,605
Hey, fishy, fishy,
fishy, fishy.

40
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,383
Hey. An Australian
rainbow fish.

41
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,387
<i>You're not gonna</i>
<i>want to put him in there... </i>

42
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:33,391
- Oh, God!
- <i>Women love it. </i>

43
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,189
They find it erotic
when they eat each other.

44
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,160
Excuse me
for a second?

45
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,167
Must make pee-pee.

46
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,248
<i> Antoine, hi. It's Regina. </i>

47
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,719
<i>I'm flying in from Luxembourg tomorrow. </i>
<i>I want you to be my driver. </i>

48
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,088
Swiss Air, flight 12.
Is it still 3,500?

49
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:10,027
<i>See you. </i> Ciao.

50
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,224
I finally figured out how you
pick up all these gorgeous women.

51
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,291
- How's that?
- You're a limo driver.

52
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,205
Sometimes I am.

53
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,505
- So you just drive them back here and have sex with them?
- If they pay me enough, yes.

54
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,239
What kind of limo service
is that?

55
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,749
Shouldn't you be taking them
to fancy restaurants or the theater?

56
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,685
- I'm a gigolo.
- A gigo-who?

57
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,390
Women pay me
to give them pleasure.

58
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,090
- How did you get that job?
- I just kind of fell into it.

59
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,803
I'm gonna kill
my guidance counselor.

60
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,488
Down!
Bad dog!

61
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,267
Hey, guys.
Did you miss me?

62
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,780
<i>Well, there's been a slight delay</i>
<i>in our move-to-the-beach plan. </i>

63
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,212
But don't worry.

64
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,652
Its's gonna happen.

65
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,525
<i> Hey, fish guy!</i>

66
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,275
I think there's something wrong
with my big fish.

67
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,346
PH is off. The nitrates
are at a dangerous level.

68
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:19,858
I can neutralize it.

69
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,191
They don't like that.

70
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,625
- I think our little friend has Malawi bloat.
- What the hell is that?

71
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,727
- It's a gill disorder.
- Is it bad?

72
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,971
- Could be fatal.
- But is he gonna make it?

73
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:40,479
He's in shock. I gave him some freeze-dried
water fleas, but he's gotta want to live.

74
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,242
- The next forty-eight hours are critical.
- Forty-eight hours?

75
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,218
But I got to go to Switzerland for
business. I'll be gone for three weeks.

76
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,016
Well, cancel it.
You got a sick fish here, pal.

77
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,080
Hey, hey,
what about you?

78
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,649
Sounds good, but I can't afford
to go to Europe right now.

79
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,891
- My passport expired...
- No, no, I mean you can stay here and look after my fish.

80
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,092
I've got
a full bar?

81
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,328
Digital television.

82
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,836
You're on the beach.

83
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,169
I don't know.

84
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,274
I would be honored
to care for your fish.

85
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:36,299
<i> Just remember, don't use my car</i>
<i>and don't answer my phone. </i>

86
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,668
No car, no phone.

87
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,832
So I guess throwing a big beach party's
out of the question.

88
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,976
This is a 14th century
Hungarian crossbow.

89
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,778
It has killed a king...

90
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,251
and changed
the history of Europe.

91
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,620
You mess up anything in my apartment,
I'll shove it up your ass.

92
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,951
Have a good trip.

93
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,903
Women pay me
to give them pleasure.

94
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,963
<i> I'm on the beach. </i>

95
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,009
<i>I mean, I open up my window,</i>
<i>I got sand blowin'in my face. </i>

96
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,342
- It's that crazy. I'd love to show it to you sometime.
- No.

97
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,347
- You really owe it to yourself to see...
- No.

98
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,612
<i>Hey! Try to get laid</i>
<i>on your own time, pal. </i>

99
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,615
I guess I'll just take
some sea snails.

100
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,890
You better get me some
from the colder tank.

101
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:06,184
<i> I've been bad. </i>
<i>I've been really bad. </i>

102
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,348
<i> But it was worth it. </i>

103
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,220
Hi. Would you like to buy
some Girls of America cookies?

104
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,890
- <i> Don't hit me with that. </i>
- Could you come back later?

105
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,560
What are you watching?

106
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,968
<i>You're gross!</i>

107
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,064
You're a sick man,
and I'm gonna tell!

108
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,473
- Hit me with it again.
- How much?

109
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,845
Great.

110
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,781
Hey, Deuce, it's Antoine.

111
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,879
<i>I just realized</i>
<i>I don't know you that well. </i>

112
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,924
To be honest,
it's freaking me out a little.

113
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,722
You just make sure you keep
my apartment clean or you will die.

114
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,728
<i>Bye-bye. </i>

115
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,488
- Six thousand dollars?
- I know. It sucks.

116
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,994
Neil, where am I going
to get $6,000 in three weeks?

117
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:06,725
I don't know your budget.
You may not want to...

118
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,529
blow your whole wad
on this tank.

119
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,230
I would.

120
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,138
- Can I pay in installments?
- No.

121
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,905
I'm up to my bicep in it,
if you know what I mean.

122
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,938
I'm not trying to flip you over
and do you dry here.

123
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,849
Look, squat on it
for a night...

124
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,853
and let me know.

125
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,242
What? Hello?

126
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,842
I've been staring
at your number for hours.

127
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,012
I got it
from a friend.

128
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,580
I'm not really
supposed to use this phone.

129
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,592
Why don't you
come over?

130
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,561
My address is
1235 Radford Way.

131
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,326
Actually, I've-I've
got a lot of work...

132
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,267
to do here... still.

133
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,270
I'm naked.

134
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,987
Now, there's my little
German tourist.

135
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,993
Is this it?
Is this the whole outfit?

136
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,122
It's perfect.

137
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,668
<i>"Guten Abend,</i>
<i>Herr Fraulein. "</i>

138
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,804
Yes. Use the map.
Use the map.

139
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,213
<i>"Vohr est der</i>
Statue of Liberty?"

140
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,749
You should've stuck
with the tour, Heinz.

141
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,160
Now you'll have
to pay the penalty.

142
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,365
It's no problem
I'll just...

143
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,563
Let me slip on
a few of these babies.

144
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,708
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

145
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,841
Now come here,

146
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,852
you naughty little
sightseer.

147
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,253
Wait a second.
I definitely heard something.

148
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,126
Oh, that's just Wolfy.
He's been in there a while.

149
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,927
Now you concentrate
and stay in character.

150
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,731
Wolfy, settle down!

151
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,171
Now you just focus on your
little wiener schnitzel.

152
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,604
I gotta get out of here.

153
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,771
Don't worry. He never
gets all the way through.

154
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,179
Maybe you better go.

155
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,881
<i>Wolfy, you've gotta stop</i>
<i>doing this to Mommy's friends. </i>

156
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,652
<i>Yes, he does. </i>

157
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,160
He'll be all right for a while.
Here, this is for you.

158
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,696
It's all I could grab.

159
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,255
- Did I bring you pleasure?
- Not really.

160
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,769
You better haul ass.

161
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,152
Ten dollars?

162
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,914
<i> A martini</i>
<i>and two olives. </i>

163
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,917
Martini.
Two olives.

164
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:23,546
Any ladies need
some entertainment tonight?

165
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,599
Eight-fifty.

166
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,439
- Eight dollars?
- And fifty cents.

167
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,643
Well, how much just for
a plain cranberry juice?

168
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,772
- Three dollars.
- I'll go for that.

169
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,248
There you go.
That's eleven-fifty.

170
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,755
No, no. Perhaps
you misunderstood me.

171
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,058
I wish to cancel my original order
of the martini and two olives...

172
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,066
and go for just the plain cranberry
juice by itself for the three dollars.

173
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:12,103
And I apologize for any inconvenience
this may have caused you.

174
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,297
<i>Perhaps</i>
<i>you don't understand. </i>

175
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,707
If you don't pay me now,
I'm gonna take this swizzle stick...

176
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,644
and I'll be shovin' that
right up your pee hole.

177
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,774
- So that was eleven-fifty, right?
- Right.

178
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,446
Okay,
there's ten...

179
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,319
and six quarters, and...

180
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,292
Tell you what.
I'll go work on your tip.

181
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,697
I couldn't help
overhearing your Spanish.

182
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:49,571
- It's French.
- <i>Oui. </i>

183
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,838
French. Nice people.
May I?

184
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,402
No...

185
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:00,577
<i>Excuzes-moi. </i> These leather seats.

186
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,019
<i>Would you like a martini</i>
<i>or cranberry juice?</i>

187
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,354
- No.
- Kind of celebrating tonight.

188
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,196
Possible career change.

189
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,428
I'm pretty excited
about it.

190
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,697
You wanna get out of here?

191
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,338
Okay. I'm sorry.

192
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,403
I mean, together.

193
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,026
What happened
to the carpet?

194
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:46,155
Oh, it's one of those
18th century wet rugs.

195
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,934
Well, that's
certainly appreciated.

196
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,014
Maybe we should take care
of a little business first.

197
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,710
If you prefer.

198
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,619
I don't have a set price or anything,
but I have been getting ten dollars.

199
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,955
- I'm sorry?
- Well, that's my going rate.

200
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,893
But I'm willing
to negotiate.

201
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:22,764
That's funny.
But the price is 500.

202
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,803
You're gonna pay me $500?

203
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:30,467
No, honey. You pay me.

204
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,535
Oh, I get it.
This is some kind of role reversal.

205
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,547
I'll play along
with this.

206
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,743
Okay, 300, 400, 500.
You're my hooker.

207
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,446
No, seriously,
where's my ten dollars?

208
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:46,013
Look, asshole. I didn't come
all the way down here for nothing.

209
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,549
Now give me my $500!

210
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,426
You give me ten dollars!

211
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,330
Five hundred, now!

212
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,701
You pay me ten dollars.

213
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,369
Nice.

214
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,154
Is that all you got?

215
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,870
Ten dollars.

216
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,011
No! Please don't!

217
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:53,057
Five hundred dollars...
or the fish gets it.

218
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,456
Let's talk about this.

219
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,369
- Why do you have a picture of Antoine?
- Well, this is his place.

220
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:09,100
I'm watching his fish
for him.

221
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,539
Please, don't tell him
about the shoes?

222
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,463
- Can I help you?
- <i>Oh, my God. </i>

223
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,974
I'm lookin' at a dead man.

224
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,671
You know, Claire told me
that Antoine's place was messed up,

225
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,510
but I had no idea.

226
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,574
- Claire?
- The hooker you ass-punched.

227
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,018
That was a misunderstanding.

228
00:25:56,087 --> 00:26:00,683
And I intend to have everything
fixed by the time Antoine gets back.

229
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,160
I'm just a little
strapped for cash right now.

230
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,891
Maybe there's somethin'
we could work out.

231
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,798
Claire mentioned
that you dabble in harlotry.

232
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,166
- I'm sorry?
- You a man-whore.

233
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,831
- Well, I tried that for a couple hours...
- See this ring?

234
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,840
Topaz.
That's my mother's birthstone.

235
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,808
Got that from man-whorin'.

236
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,437
See this key chain?
That's right.

237
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,482
Mini yo-yo. Know where I got
the money for that?

238
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,312
- Man-whoring?
- Stock market.

239
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:29,319
But I got the money for the stock market
from man-whorin'...

240
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,788
and representin'
man-whores like yourself.

241
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,189
So...
you're a pimp?

242
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,956
T. J. Don't consider himself
no pimp.

243
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,657
More of a male madam.

244
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,801
That wasn't
too well thought out.

245
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,133
<i> Look at this proud fish. </i>

246
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,571
<i>It's like a coyote... </i>
<i>king of the jungle. </i>

247
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,634
It's like Antoine.
He don't need no pimp.

248
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,647
Then look at this
mid-level fish here.

249
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,650
Works hotels, conventions,
senior centers.

250
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,916
I represent several man-whores
at this level of the game.

251
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,048
Now look at
this little fella,

252
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,992
<i>at the bottom, tryin'to</i>
<i>get busy with the scuba man. </i>

253
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:14,259
You know, if you work hard
and listen to me,

254
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,266
this could be you.

255
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,234
<i>Well, thanks,</i>

256
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,363
but I already have
a job.

257
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,373
I clean fish tanks.

258
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:27,104
- You gon' make $150 cleanin' fish tanks?
- $150?

259
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,612
Yeah. Fish ain't
gon' pay for all this.

260
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,884
I don't know.

261
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,444
You know, Antoine's
got a bad temper.

262
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,958
I remember once
I dropped a cigar ash on his rug.

263
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,462
He made me pick it up
with my anus.

264
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,629
Well, maybe I could do
a couple jobs,

265
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,534
just to get this place
fixed up.

266
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,250
We got a lot of work
to do.

267
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,133
You a man-whore now.

268
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,143
I'm so proud.

269
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,145
Thanks, T. J.

270
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,148
Now remember,
it's a business.

271
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,151
Never, ever fall in love.

272
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,576
<i>I'm upstairs!</i>

273
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,494
Okay, Deuce,

274
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,498
don't fall in love.

275
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,007
I know what you're thinkin'.

276
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:21,117
You're thinkin' those are
the biggest boobies you've ever seen.

277
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,120
Can I please
use your phone?

278
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,122
I'm not your average woman.

279
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,124
I like sex,

280
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,127
and I'm not afraid to adm...

281
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,363
Excuse me.
I just had pudding an hour ago.

282
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:39,961
- Dear God.
- You ever parked your bicycle in an airplane hangar?

283
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:45,533
- I'm sorry?
- You ever thrown a toothpick into a volcano?

284
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,443
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

285
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,107
Just making idle chitchat.

286
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,481
- Are you comfortable?
- Actually, no.

287
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,646
I'm sweatin'.

288
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,656
You're gettin' me all hot.

289
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,452
You don't like my hair,
do you?

290
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,428
- I think there's been a mistake.
- Did you say steak?

291
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,397
- No, mistake.
- Oh, see, now you got me all excited.

292
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,400
Look, I'm gay.

293
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,629
Well, how gay are you?

294
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,969
Very, very gay. You must have dialed
the Very Gay Escort Service.

295
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,974
Oh, shit.

296
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,342
See, sometimes my fingers swell up
and I can't cleanly hit the numbers.

297
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:26,179
- They should make a phone for full-figured girls.
- They should.

298
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,778
So, what do we do?

299
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,860
Cakes and pies. Cakes and pies.

300
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,867
Okay, which pie
has the most sugar?

301
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,369
- Peach cobbler.
- You win again.

302
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,371
That's four games to one.

303
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,431
Well, fast food trivia
is my game, honey.

304
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:58,048
I must tell you, nobody
has ever pleasured Jabba the Slut.

305
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:02,485
<i>Deucey, you have a way of satisfying</i>
<i>a woman that would sicken a normal man. </i>

306
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,544
I can't do this anymore.

307
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,022
You must have
a magical "man-gina. "

308
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,116
"Man-gina. "

309
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:14,221
It's a professional term we man-whores
use to describe our... he-pussy.

310
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,460
<i>I'm not one</i>
<i>of your man-whores. </i>

311
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,024
Okay? I quit.

312
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,536
You ungrateful he-bitch.

313
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,836
How 'bout I get Antoine on the phone
in Switzerland and tell him...

314
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,842
how you redecorated
his poon palace.

315
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,346
I'm not
an ungrateful he-bitch.

316
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,848
Just give me a minute
to think here.

317
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,442
Thanks.

318
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,377
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

319
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,507
- Hey, Dad, let me ask you a question.
- And what's that, son?

320
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:09,019
Do you think it's wrong for a man
to accept money from a woman...

321
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,555
to, you know,
show her a good time?

322
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,783
I was just thinking about that
this morning.

323
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,919
The idea of a man-whore
is a relatively new idea.

324
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,391
- Cologne?
- No, thanks.

325
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,237
These women are looking for something
more than just sex. They want romance.

326
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,536
What do you mean?

327
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:34,772
Well, it was like when I met
your mom, God rest her soul.

328
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,781
I didn't have so much
as a toilet to clean.

329
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,785
Still, I wasn't going to pay her a dime
for sex, no matter what she was charging.

330
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,650
What?

331
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,986
Your mom could've had any man
she wanted in that strip club,

332
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:51,461
and this being my first time in Bangkok,
I was looking for a good time myself.

333
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,793
- You met Mom where?
- It's not important.

334
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,493
The thing is,
she saw something in me...

335
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,092
beyond the 200 baht...

336
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,070
a man with an eye
for adventure...

337
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,232
who wasn't afraid
to risk it all.

338
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,241
Dad, are you saying that...

339
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,646
<i>So we took all her</i>
<i>one-dollar bills off the stage,</i>

340
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,651
said good-bye
to that donkey...

341
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,678
<i>and two days later</i>
<i>we were man and wife. </i>

342
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,190
And we were happily married
a long time.

343
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:25,457
So, do you think I should be
more of a risk-taker?

344
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,521
Worked for me.

345
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,589
Thanks, Pops.

346
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,172
Well, son,

347
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,175
looks like I've got
some work to do.

348
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,782
You got yourself
a man-whore.

349
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,784
Hah!

350
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,547
My man!

351
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,831
- Is Tina here?
- Yes.

352
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,530
I'm Deuce Bigalow,
your date.

353
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,664
I'll get my things.

354
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,477
I love this place.

355
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,812
- Where you from again?
- Norway.

356
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,819
- <i> Freak!</i>
- I hear great things about it.

357
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,220
- <i> Holy shit, it's Bigfoot!</i>
- So, how'd you end up here?

358
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,225
I had a pituitary gland procedure
at U.C.L.A. Medical Center...

359
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,194
and fell in love
with the people here.

360
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,197
<i> Hey, keep it in the circus!</i>

361
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:38,201
This place has gone way downhill.
What do you say we go somewhere else?

362
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,203
<i> That's a huge bitch!</i>

363
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,436
I'm sorry about
what those people said.

364
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,943
You should be able to go
on <i>all</i> the rides.

365
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,506
I had a really great time,

366
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,607
but I should go...

367
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,515
Easy. Easy!

368
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,619
Wait! Wait!

369
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:05,092
I know what we could do!
I got it!

370
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,395
Give me a second to think here!
Wait! Whoa!

371
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:14,029
Oh, yes. Ohh!

372
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,630
Mmmm. Ohh.

373
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,115
Oh, God!

374
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,119
Oh, no one has ever
touched my feet before.

375
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,034
Deuce Bigalow?

376
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,967
Detective Fowler,
L.A.P.D.

377
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,906
I want to ask you a few questions
about Antoine Laconte,

378
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:54,604
known gigolo,
male prostitute.

379
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,614
I'm just taking care
of his fish.

380
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,513
I'll bet you are.

381
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,484
You make me sick.

382
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:06,387
You're gonna tell me that gigantic woman
didn't just pay you to have sex with her?

383
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:09,119
- No!
- Let me tell you something, mister.

384
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:13,425
I can sleep at night because I make
a decent, God-fearing, honest living.

385
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,398
I'm sure you do,
but there's nothing I can tell you.

386
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,332
Oh, I think there is.

387
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,267
What do you think
of this?

388
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,307
- You think I can get anything for it? You know, money?
- I don't know!

389
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:27,140
- Yeah, you think I'm a loser, don't you?
- No, I don't.

390
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:31,648
Well, maybe I am a loser, but I'm
a loser who can bust your ass.

391
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:35,277
You tell Antoine
I'm gonna nail him.

392
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,237
Hello.

393
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,967
- Is this Ruth?
- Yeah. I'll be right down...

394
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,441
Goddamn it!

395
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,501
- Nice day?
- Yeah.

396
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,513
Shove it up your ass!

397
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,616
Geez, you okay?

398
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,714
I'm sorry.
I have Tourette's syndrome.

399
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,283
It causes me to have
these uncontrollable outbursts.

400
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,886
- It's not so bad.
- Yeah, it's okay.

401
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,898
I mean,
you get used to it.

402
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,298
Ball sweat!
Anus!

403
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,302
Anus licker!

404
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,564
You know,
there are some places...

405
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,574
I can't go...

406
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,803
Nipple biter!

407
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,147
What are you talkin' about?
I barely notice it.

408
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,376
Scrotum!

409
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,817
Sperm!
Sperm face!

410
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,548
I just can't go near
places like churches...

411
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,216
Vulva!

412
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,921
Elementary schools...
Jizz! Jizz trap!

413
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,930
Pretty much anywhere.

414
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,432
Fart!
Dildo!

415
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,762
Big, big titties!

416
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,999
Shit! Shit whore!

417
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:06,339
<i>Let's put the top up. </i>
<i>I'll put on the air conditioning. </i>

418
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,872
You probably want
to take me home, don't you?

419
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,883
No.

420
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,387
Hey, I got an idea.

421
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,687
I'm nervous.
There's a lot of people here.

422
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,696
- Don't worry...
- Crap muncher!

423
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,698
<i> "Crap muncher"?</i>

424
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,360
I know!
He was definitely safe!

425
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,893
- What do you think about the other team?
- Assholes!

426
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,406
Right.
And their pitcher...

427
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,410
I mean, stop stalling
and throw it already.

428
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,708
Ball hair!

429
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,044
Yeah,
ball hair!

430
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,210
What we need
is a strike hair.

431
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:51,083
That other team is a bunch of
high-priced babies!

432
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,089
- Whores!
- Yeah! You tell 'em, baby!

433
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,489
They called him out?

434
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,158
Scrotum licker!

435
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,634
Piss face!

436
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,345
Deucey, you the best he-bitch
in my man-stable.

437
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,853
If I had two more man-ginas like you,
I'd be a millionaire.

438
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,320
T. J., I think
I'm gonna get out.

439
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,323
Sit down.

440
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:32,090
- This next date is what we man-pimps call a doozy.
- What's wrong with this one?

441
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,960
- Nothin'.
- Have you seen her?

442
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,431
What is she, 80?
A hunchback?

443
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,494
She just got out of college. Her girlfriends
pitched in to get her a little beefcake.

444
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,939
- <i>She thinks it's a blind date. </i>
- It's a guy, isn't it?

445
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,972
I don't think so,
but I have been fooled before.

446
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,637
You must be Kate.

447
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,639
Excuse me.
Waiter.

448
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,404
Sorry.
We're busy tonight.

449
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,480
- All right, number four?
- <i>Yes, thank you. </i>

450
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,979
- I'm Kate.
- Are you sure?

451
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,080
I think so.

452
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,591
I'm sorry.
You're just not what I expected.

453
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,390
- Really.
- No, no.

454
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,626
I mean, in a good way.

455
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,602
They didn't say
you were so perfect.

456
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,695
"Perfect. "

457
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,909
Sally and Megan didn't tell me
a lot about you.

458
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,946
Who?

459
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,947
Oh, right...

460
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,849
Well, I clean tanks..
Tankers.

461
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,454
I'm sorry.
I'm still kinda shocked.

462
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,287
I mean, you're...
you're really normal.

463
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,360
Thank you.

464
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,090
My last couple of dates
have been horrible.

465
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:18,328
- You get fixed up on a lot of blind dates?
- Only recently.

466
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:23,100
- How about you?
- This is my first.

467
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,574
- I hope this place is okay.
- Are you kidding? It's terrific.

468
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,911
Oh, God.

469
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:34,041
- Are you okay?
- Is this one of those...

470
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,245
It's a sushi bar.

471
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,481
- <i>Are you allergic?</i>
- <i>You could say that. </i>

472
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,548
That's a dog-faced
puffer fish over there.

473
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:45,459
<i>He's not even fully matured yet. </i>
<i>He's a teenager, for crying out loud!</i>

474
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,890
Can I ask you
to stop that, please?

475
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,299
<i>Hai. </i>

476
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:59,536
I don't see how it could
possibly be pleasurable for a woman.

477
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,477
I just don't think
it's natural.

478
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,810
You're not supposed to
go up there.

479
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,817
To tell you the truth,
I don't know how men do it either.

480
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,150
You're not curious
just to try something new?

481
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:14,156
I'm just not into it.

482
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:17,660
- So space exploration is definitely out for you.
- Definitely.

483
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,663
I mean, more power to any woman
who wants to be an astronaut.

484
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,665
I just wouldn't
do it.

485
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,668
Frankly, I'd rather
take it up the butt.

486
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,341
So you think
this is a good spot?

487
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,478
Perfect.

488
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,882
Life's funny?

489
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,884
Some pretty close calls.

490
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,222
Wonder if he knew
how close he came to the end.

491
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,724
Oh, he knew.

492
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,387
I bet he never thought he'd be held
by such a lovely woman.

493
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,397
Deuce.

494
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,561
You're embarrassing me
in front of our new friend.

495
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,543
That was a really nice thing
you did tonight.

496
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:16,052
Too bad it's a freshwater fish.

497
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,816
I'm kidding.

498
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,823
I'm just joking.

499
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:31,025
Good night.

500
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,558
You've had yourself
an interesting little evening.

501
00:44:56,627 --> 00:45:00,290
Just taking care of his fish?
She looks like a nice catch.

502
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,731
- It was a first date.
- Listen up, man-whore.

503
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,735
I oughta bust you
right now.

504
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:09,239
- We just had sushi.
- "Sushi"? Is that what they call it nowadays?

505
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,934
I'm hip to your
man-whore slang.

506
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:17,072
All right, fine, why don't I just go
have a chat with your spicy tuna roll.

507
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,637
No, don't!

508
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,883
All right.
Okay, Deuce.

509
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,921
No problem, baby.
Relax.

510
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:28,424
Maybe I'll even let this one
slide for some information.

511
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,824
Like Antoine's black book.

512
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,988
- You know, the one with his list of clients.
- I don't know anything about it.

513
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,328
Oh, yeah?
You know anything about this?

514
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,665
Look.
See that red spot?

515
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,070
That wasn't there this morning.
You know what it is?

516
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,507
Maybe it's a rash, something you got
from jogging. How the hell do I know?

517
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,512
Get it away from me.

518
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,514
Maybe you're right.

519
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,914
You got three days,
Bigalow.

520
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:05,158
T. J., I really like this girl.

521
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:09,598
Deucey, don't be falling in love with no
she-john. You're in it for the money.

522
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:13,033
<i>Antoine'll be back soon. </i>
<i>Apartment ain't gonna pay to fix itself. </i>

523
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,037
<i>I know. </i>

524
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,939
- Hey, there's been this detective following me.
- Goddamn it, white boy!

525
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:22,206
- You didn't tell him nothin' about me, did ya?
- No, but what should I do?

526
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,816
- About what?
- About the cop.

527
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,284
Would you stop mentioning
the damn cops!

528
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:32,288
Don't make me
he-bitch man-slap you.

529
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,558
Hi, I'm Deuce Bigalow,
your man-whore for this evening.

530
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,798
Hi, I'm Carol...

531
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,503
I have narcolepsy.
It's a sleeping disorder.

532
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,341
<i>It isn't</i>
<i>the worst thing. </i>

533
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:59,871
I'm just not allowed to fly
in a plane or drive a car...

534
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,884
or work in a gun range.

535
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,440
This is such a treat.

536
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,444
I've always wanted to try soup,
but there's the fear of drowning.

537
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,022
I really had fun.

538
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,218
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I'll be fine.

539
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,227
You sure?

540
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,559
Good night.

541
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,069
<i>Come on. You can dance. </i>

542
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,416
- You look great.
- Thanks.

543
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,181
<i>I want you</i>
<i>to meet my roommate. </i>

544
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,052
<i>Who's there?</i>
<i>Kate?</i>

545
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,581
- I hear someone.
- It's just me and my friend.

546
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,288
Are you sure?
I hear three people.

547
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,354
You're the third person.

548
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,868
She's newly blind.
She's still getting adjusted.

549
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:37,395
<i>Bergita, this is Deuce. </i>

550
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,669
I think there's something
wrong with Cassie.

551
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,234
Oh, honey.

552
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,075
This isn't Cassie.

553
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,138
<i>Here she is. </i>

554
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,413
Oh, there you are.

555
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,012
It's nice to meet you.

556
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:59,521
Once you try it for the first time,
you're pretty happy with the results.

557
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,531
I've never met a hair transplant
technician before.

558
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,771
Oh, man, I forgot.
It's my dad's birthday.

559
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,244
- Let's go see him.
- He's working.

560
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,247
So?
What does he do?

561
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:23,442
He's in
the restaurant industry.

562
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:29,214
Kate, I'd like you
to meet my dad, Bob Bigalow.

563
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,624
Bob, Kate.

564
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,629
Hi.

565
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,631
Son, I'm very proud of you.

566
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,634
She is
a lovely young lady.

567
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,136
Thank you.

568
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,139
It's so nice to meet you.
Happy birthday.

569
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,801
- <i>Thank you. </i>
- Well, we should probably be going.

570
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,209
Deuce.

571
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,146
Dad probably has a lot
of paperwork to do, and...

572
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,877
No, the paper's
completely stocked.

573
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:59,650
I've got plenty of time to get acquainted
with the woman who's made my boy so happy.

574
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,214
We got you a cake.

575
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,226
Deuce said it's your favorite.

576
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:08,162
- We had to go to a Filipino bakery to get it.
- You didn't.

577
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,166
You did!

578
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,429
Raspberry bibingka.

579
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,437
You shouldn't have.

580
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:18,099
My wife,
God rest her soul,

581
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,336
use to make this
all the time.

582
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,344
You would've liked her.

583
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,346
Bangkok Betty.

584
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:29,809
She had the most amazing mouth.
It paid for our honeymoon.

585
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:32,912
We should probably
be going.

586
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,924
Deuce, it's your dad's birthday.

587
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:42,825
Hi. Bob, we have an overflowing toilet
in the ladies' bathroom.

588
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,834
There is shit everywhere.
It's a real mess.

589
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:49,838
- <i>You think you could take care of that for me?</i>
- No worries, Vic. Right on it.

590
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,841
- I'd like you to meet my son's girlfriend Kate.
- Kate, nice to meet you.

591
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,501
- You, too.
- Hi, Deuce.

592
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,944
<i>So could you</i>
<i>get in there, Bob?</i>

593
00:51:57,013 --> 00:52:01,211
<i>I got a party of ten coming in,</i>
<i>and I am up to my ankles in human crap. </i>

594
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,514
It's a real stinkfest
back there.

595
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,521
Sure.

596
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,217
Looks like I'd better
get back to work.

597
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,816
<i>It's a pleasure</i>
<i>meeting you, dear. </i>

598
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,863
Warms my heart
just being in your presence.

599
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,455
Thank you.

600
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,467
See you, son.

601
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:26,275
See, my dad's one of those guys, he likes to
be involved in every facet of the business.

602
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:30,302
- It's okay.
- No problem to small or big. They come to him for everything.

603
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,247
Deuce, it's all right.

604
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:38,150
It's not his restaurant.

605
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:41,247
My dad's not even a waiter.

606
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,725
He's the men's room attendant.
I'm sorry.

607
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,228
Don't be silly.

608
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,830
You know
what my dad does?

609
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,233
He's an aeronautical
engineer.

610
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,415
Bob?

611
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,889
Wanna blow out
your candle?

612
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,366
Now that's good bibingka.

613
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,746
I had a really
nice time tonight.

614
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:41,375
I find that
hard to believe.

615
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,386
I've never met
anyone like you.

616
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,051
Good.

617
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,195
I have to see you
again.

618
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,035
When we go inside, try to be quiet
so we don't wake up Brigita.

619
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,493
Why don't I get
the light?

620
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:29,020
Hang on. I'll be right back.
Be right back.

621
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,972
You are good.

622
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,360
Are you all right?

623
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:01,522
I need you to be
okay with something.

624
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:04,032
What? I'm okay
with everything.

625
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,159
Deuce.

626
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:09,034
There may be things
about me that you don't like.

627
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,972
I like everything
about you.

628
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:16,103
I mean, physically.

629
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:19,615
So you're taller than me.
Big deal. I'll get over it.

630
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,277
It's not that.

631
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,286
What?

632
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:28,051
If you were to find out
something about me...

633
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:31,184
and my body that was
maybe a little different...

634
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,786
than what you were used to,
would that be okay?

635
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,924
There could be nothing
on your body that I wouldn't like.

636
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,060
What are you
talking about?

637
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:46,005
What do you got, like, six toes
or something? I can live with that.

638
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,374
Deuce, I have to tell you,

639
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:50,777
I have a...

640
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:25,904
Oh, my God. I'm sorry!

641
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:29,577
- I tried to tell you.
- No, it's my fault.

642
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,416
I shouldn't have
pulled it so hard.

643
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,514
If you want to leave,
I completely understand.

644
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,389
<i>I don't want to leave. </i>
<i>I'm sorry I had that reaction. </i>

645
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,020
I just... I got a lot of things
going on in my life recently,

646
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:42,155
and they all sort of culminated
when your leg fell off...

647
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,223
came off...
disconnected...

648
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,996
- Just get out!
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>

649
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,901
Please leave.

650
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:55,002
Kate!
I'm sorry!

651
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,342
<i> Just go home. </i>

652
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,746
Don't I have
a say in this?

653
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,750
Hand me my leg.

654
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,685
- Then will you come out and talk?
- I don't know.

655
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:15,023
Are you sure
you want to stay?

656
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,898
Yes, but only if
you come out of there.

657
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:24,163
I need to know how you feel
about all this.

658
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,300
The same as I did
an hour ago,

659
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:30,676
when I thought to myself,
"I'm the luckiest guy in the world...

660
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:33,238
to be with her leg...
with you. "

661
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:07,644
Is this normal?
My face is numb.

662
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,777
It's perfectly normal
in hair replacement surgery.

663
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,982
The local anesthetic has numbed
the major nerves in your face,

664
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,048
just like at the dentist.

665
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:24,224
<i>You're Kate's best friends, and I know</i>
<i>your opinions mean a lot to her. </i>

666
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,066
And I'd like to get
really serious with her.

667
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:31,072
- You're a prostitute!
- Not anymore.

668
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,074
And it's "man-whore. "

669
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:37,010
Anyway, I just quit.
I mean, Kate's the one for me.

670
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,241
Listen, you were only supposed to
go out with her one night,

671
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,510
show her a good time, and then
get the hell out of her life.

672
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:44,553
- You know she's not normal.
- She's not like other girls.

673
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,681
You know what her problem is?
Friends like you.

674
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,884
<i>She's perfect. </i>
<i>She's kind,</i>

675
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:53,656
she's sweet, she's funny,
and she likes me.

676
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,823
Now I came here
to give you your money back...

677
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:59,665
the money you paid a stranger
to have sex with your friend.

678
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:05,263
Hey! You stay away
from her, man-whore!

679
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:09,004
Hiya, Deuce. Your three days
are up, lover boy.

680
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:12,411
- So where's Antoine's black book?
- I've looked everywhere.

681
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:15,679
Listen, punk, you are aiding
and abetting a known criminal.

682
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,084
Do the initials T and J mean
anything to you?

683
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:20,588
Turkey jizz?
I don't...

684
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:25,356
You better show some respect, or I'm gonna rip
that pleasure-giving tongue out of your head!

685
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,419
One more thing.

686
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:30,295
I was at the precinct, and I
really had to use the john,

687
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,527
and it's pretty filthy in there
and I was in kind of a hurry...

688
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:35,594
and I didn't have time to use one of
those, you know, paper ass gaskets.

689
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:39,472
I was doin' my business, and something
sort of splashed up on me, all over.

690
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:43,273
What do you do in situations like that?
You think I'll be all right?

691
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,838
- I think you're pretty safe.
- I better be!

692
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:55,249
<i> Ugly is not a problem for this guy. </i>

693
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,555
<i>My man would stick his dick</i>
<i>in a he-monkey. </i>

694
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,561
All right.
I'll catch you later.

695
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,888
What up, Deucey?

696
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,595
You should know,
that cop won't leave me alone.

697
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,570
What about the cop?

698
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:12,767
- He's been asking questions.
- Goddamn white boy.

699
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:15,402
Anyway, it doesn't matter
to me anymore. I'm quitting.

700
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,537
What about
Antoine's apartment?

701
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,606
I'm gonna get the rest of the money
the old-fashioned way.

702
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,617
You gonna steal it?

703
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,588
See ya, T. J.

704
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,162
I just quit!
I'm never doing it again!

705
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:41,431
- You lied to me!
- Listen, please. It's not what you think.

706
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,200
You were paid
to go out with me!

707
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,545
- You want breakfast?
- Kate!

708
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:57,348
<i>Please go away!</i>
<i>I don't want to see you again!</i>

709
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,787
Me neither.

710
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,916
I'm sorry.

711
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:09,087
I'm 1,500 short.
Isn't there anything else you can do?

712
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:12,719
Listen, I came all over the place...
down from six grand.

713
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,093
This is a custom
hand job.

714
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:18,327
- Let me pay you monthly.
- The last time I didn't get the money up front,

715
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,869
I got the big stiffie.

716
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,306
- Hello?
- What the hell are you doing picking up my phone?

717
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:30,937
- I found the coral you wanted.
- If you are doing anything I disapprove of, I will kill you!

718
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:34,915
- <i>Hola, senor. No yo tengo. </i>
<i>No habla Ingles. </i>

719
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:37,282
- Murder! I will kill you!
- <i>Hasta luego. </i>

720
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,816
Hey, Antoine. It's Elaine.

721
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,828
<i>I really need</i>
<i>to see you again. </i>

722
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,296
<i>Same price, same place?</i>

723
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:53,563
I'll have the money.

724
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:57,128
Hi. This isn't
Antoine,

725
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,140
but maybe we
can work something out.

726
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,744
Hi.

727
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,931
I'm Deuce.

728
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,379
- Stop.
- Why?

729
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,751
- You don't want to have sex.
- Yes, I do.

730
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,053
I think we both do.

731
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,862
Don't you find me
attractive?

732
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:59,027
Are you kidding? You're one of
the hottest women I've ever seen.

733
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,729
Easy, easy.

734
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:04,568
I just can't do this.

735
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,801
I'm head over heels
for a girl,

736
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,868
and we're going through a rough time,
me being a man-whore and all.

737
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,813
But I know it's gonna work out,
because I love her.

738
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:17,083
Well, she's a lucky girl.

739
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,212
At least emotionally.

740
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,258
My guy used
to be like that.

741
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:27,729
Hang in there.

742
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,900
Things have a way
of working out.

743
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,538
Where you goin'?

744
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:45,479
Well, I thought we talked
and you understood.

745
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:49,484
I understand. But the fact is,
I still paid for your services.

746
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,385
What did you have
in mind?

747
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,665
- I'm just exhausted.
- Oh, God, you were amazing. Are you kidding?

748
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,838
I just had to see
for myself.

749
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:29,277
Kate!

750
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,605
- What?
- How's Elaine?

751
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,199
You know, your wife.

752
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,642
Bastard!

753
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,578
This wasn't about
some black book.

754
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,809
Your wife was a customer
of Antoine's, wasn't she?

755
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:05,081
That son of a bitch is goin' down.
And you're gonna join him!

756
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,888
How's that gonna fix
your marriage?

757
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:16,460
Look, I lost someone
that I love too.

758
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,435
You know why
she did this?

759
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:24,837
You wanna know why
she went outside our marriage?

760
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:26,932
It's because
of my dick, man.

761
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:30,069
I mean, that's the reason.
It's my dick.

762
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,671
Take it easy.

763
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:36,115
You're saying your wife cheated on you
because your penis is too small?

764
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:41,020
It's not too small. It's too thin,
okay? My dick is too thin.

765
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:45,049
- I've got a thin dick!
- Can you keep it down?

766
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,755
- I'd like to come back here someday.
- Everybody knows...

767
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,492
that it's width, width that
gives sexual gratification.

768
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,694
I've read it.
<i>Cosmo, Redbook,</i> you name it.

769
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:58,138
What am I supposed to do? I've got
the thinnest penis in the world! Here.

770
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:01,370
- It's like a Twizzler. Look!
- No, no, stop that.

771
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:04,880
Sit down!
Sit!

772
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:08,348
It's not your dick.
It's you.

773
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,476
I'm telling you now,
if you painted it silver...

774
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:13,113
and twisted it on the end,
it'd look like a kickstand.

775
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,517
If man-whoring
has taught me anything,

776
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,459
it's that most women are as unhappy
with their entire body...

777
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,587
as you are
with your small penis.

778
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,859
- Thin penis.
- Whatever.

779
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,795
- While you're worried about your penis,
- Thin penis.

780
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,737
Women are worried
about their height,

781
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:33,502
their weight,
their giant feet,

782
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:36,409
the stream of obscenities that could
burst through their mouth at any second.

783
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,846
If you make a woman
feel good about herself,

784
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,349
it really doesn't matter
what's wrong with you.

785
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:47,119
Even if it's
really, really thin?

786
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,384
We're talkin'
spaghetti stick.

787
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:53,761
Tell you what.

788
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:57,890
Every time you're feeling self-conscious
about your thin dick,

789
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,368
say something nice to make
your woman feel sexy.

790
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:06,368
I mean, is that it?
I mean, is that all there is?

791
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,845
There is
one other thing.

792
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:29,897
<i>Yes, sir. </i>

793
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:33,924
You're sure there isn't
anything you can do?

794
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:38,005
Yes, sir.
I understand.

795
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:49,850
Listen.
I really appreciate you helping me.

796
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:52,114
I guess
I misjudged you.

797
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:55,347
Anyway, I got you
off the hook.

798
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,824
Why am I still worried?

799
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,088
You got to give them T. J.

800
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:03,097
- I can't do that!
- You got no choice.

801
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,133
I've been workin'
on this case for three months.

802
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,864
- Boss says somebody's got to be arrested.
- But T. J.'s my friend.

803
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,930
They're serious, Deuce.

804
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:15,170
Look, I don't like it,
but it's either you or him.

805
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:24,181
Your Honor, sex for money
is morally reprehensible.

806
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:29,247
Mr. Bigalow has compounded this crime
by refusing to name his he-pimp.

807
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:32,692
<i>Therefore, we ask for</i>
<i>the maximum term... </i>

808
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,628
for each of the five counts
of prostitution.

809
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,052
Excuse me.

810
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:17,301
We never had sex.

811
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,568
We talked about it.

812
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,906
Well, I talked about it.

813
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:26,607
But Deuce never took advantage of me.
He should have.

814
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:28,616
But he's my friend.

815
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:34,350
<i>He made me realize that I wasn't</i>
<i>just some hot babe with huge tits. </i>

816
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:37,358
<i>Even though I am. </i>

817
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,486
<i>Oh, and he also</i>
<i>got me walkin'again. </i>

818
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,594
<i>Deuce and I</i>
<i>never had sex. </i>

819
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:52,368
- It was physically impossible.
- <i> Freak!</i>

820
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:56,040
<i>It's true I paid him money</i>
<i>to be with him,</i>

821
01:11:56,111 --> 01:12:00,639
and I'd do it again because he made me
feel good about myself.

822
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:03,184
Behemoth.

823
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,853
And no one ever
touched my feet before.

824
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,790
<i> That's a huge bitch!</i>

825
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,955
Deuce taught me to be
comfortable with who I am.

826
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,930
Thank you, Deuce.

827
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,229
Asshole!

828
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,630
These are very serious
charges, Mr. Bigalow.

829
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:26,800
<i>I just have one question</i>
<i>to ask you. </i>

830
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:30,709
During your entire stint as a he-whore,
did you have sex with anyone?

831
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,875
Yes, Your Honor.

832
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,078
Just one woman.

833
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:42,749
And I'm in love with her.

834
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,884
<i>Order!</i>

835
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,894
Order, please.

836
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:49,897
This is very important,
Mr. Bigalow.

837
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:52,433
Did she pay you for sex?

838
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,898
No.

839
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,770
Case dismissed.

840
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,505
Yes!

841
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,889
These shots will deaden
the nerve area...

842
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:22,089
where your hair transplants
will be.

843
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,096
There.
That should do it.

844
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:29,604
Nurse, would you please
remove our donor hair.

845
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,605
I'll be back
in a minute.

846
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:46,888
Mr. Johnson, please
just lie back down now.

847
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,480
Oh, my God.
Deuce!

848
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,549
Kate, listen to me.

849
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,561
What are you
doing here?

850
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:56,564
It's the only way
I could get you to see me.

851
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:59,795
Deuce, it's over
between us.

852
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:04,266
Listen,

853
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,603
those shots
hurt like hell.

854
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,609
Could you at least
hear me out?

855
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:12,477
Well, I don't know how much you charge
by the hour, but you have one minute.

856
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:15,483
I deserved that.

857
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,955
I should've told you
right from the start,

858
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,957
but I was afraid.

859
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,651
Afraid of what?

860
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:28,992
Afraid that a girl
as wonderful as you...

861
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:33,592
could never fall for a guy
who cleans fish tanks.

862
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:36,103
'Cause that's who
I really am.

863
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:39,436
This whole gigolo thing
was just a mistake.

864
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:42,500
But I'm glad
it happened...

865
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:46,309
'cause I never
would have met you.

866
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:49,316
I never would have known
what love was.

867
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:54,116
I'm sorry.
I'm not perfect.

868
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,283
I'm not perfect either.

869
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,961
Yes, you are.

870
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:06,865
You're perfect in every way.

871
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,870
I knew it
the moment I met you.

872
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:18,578
Kate.

873
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:22,208
"You have a smile
that could melt an iceberg.

874
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:27,347
"Your lips
are as sweet as honey.

875
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,357
"You may only have
one leg,

876
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:35,260
but it's the most beautiful
leg in the world. "

877
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,805
Are you kissing me?
'Cause I can't feel a thing.

878
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:48,406
<i> Now boarding</i>
<i>at gate 53.</i>

879
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:51,412
<i>Flight 14 to Sydney, Australia</i>
<i>is now boarding... </i>

880
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,914
I've never done this
in 12 hours before.

881
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:56,416
I'm not responsible
if the seals leak.

882
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,521
Shit!
Shit cabinet!

883
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:12,967
Come on, put the fish
in the tank already.

884
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:15,970
Antoine's plane landed
20 minutes ago.

885
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:19,030
I think
we're gonna be okay.

886
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:22,936
Could you step this way,
please?

887
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,477
Is it time to put
the big guy in yet?

888
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,485
Give him another minute.
Temperature's not right.

889
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:43,297
Spread them again, please.

890
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:48,832
<i> Okay, we can put</i>
<i>the last fish in. </i>

891
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,838
Looks like
you pulled it off, kid.

892
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,840
<i> Time for some tequila!</i>

893
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,110
Margaritas, anybody?

894
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:26,363
I need... Chinese...
tailbar... lionfish.

895
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,974
- 700, 800.
- Where'd you get all that money?

896
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,981
- Friends.
- Yeah, right.

897
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:36,643
Anything else?

898
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:40,882
On second thought, you'd better give me
some of those sea snails.

899
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,418
So how was your trip?

900
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:14,578
Very good...

901
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:16,647
till about three hours ago.

902
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:19,091
Yeah?
What happened?

903
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,322
I don't wanna talk
about it.

904
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,600
The place looks good.

905
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,603
Good to be home.

906
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:32,765
I should take off
so you can relax.

907
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:35,275
Is there something
you're not telling me?

908
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,442
<i>Yeah. </i>

909
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:42,506
I put your mail on the nightstand.

910
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,588
Right.

911
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:53,594
What the hell is this?

912
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,062
<i>A chocolate margarita. </i>

913
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,758
You've been having
a party?

914
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:01,564
It was more like,
a welcome-home thing, really.

915
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,339
I could really use one
right now.

916
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,443
Spicy.

917
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:23,123
- I should probably go.
- My fish.

918
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,989
They look smaller.

919
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:33,531
Sometimes
when they're sick,

920
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,729
they'll shrink.

921
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:09,703
I did man-whore for a little bit,
but none of your clients.

922
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:11,705
None of them.

923
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:14,765
I know an aquarium guy
who can fix all of this.

924
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:17,209
i>He's a little expensive... </i>

925
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,602
Tough guy.

926
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:21,608
What do you think of this?

927
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:23,769
You're busted.

928
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:26,847
What's goin' on
out here?

929
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,417
I can see!

930
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,550
You're black.

931
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:35,851
I knew it.
