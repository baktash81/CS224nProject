1
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:34,662
Slave in the Magic Mirror,

2
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:38,207
come from the farthest space.

3
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,669
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.

4
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,088
Speak!

5
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,842
Let me see thy face.

6
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,972
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?

7
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:55,850
Magic Mirror on the wall,

8
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,020
who is the fairest one of all?

9
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:03,608
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.

10
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:07,820
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

11
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:12,200
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.

12
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:18,247
Alas, she is more fair than thee.

13
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:22,376
Alas for her! Reveal her name.

14
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,421
Lips red as the rose.

15
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:28,508
Hair black as ebony.

16
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:31,052
Skin white as snow.

17
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:34,055
Snow White!

18
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:10,341
Want to know a secret?

19
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,135
Promise not to tell?

20
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,932
We are standing
by a wishing well

21
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:22,061
Make a wish into the well

22
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,772
That's all you have to do

23
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,942
And if you hear it echoing

24
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:31,445
Your wish will soon come true

25
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:36,284
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing

26
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,120
For the one I love

27
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:42,582
- To find me
- To find me

28
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,293
- Today
- Today

29
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,963
- I'm hoping
- I'm hoping

30
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,133
And I'm dreaming of

31
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,511
- The nice things
- The nice things

32
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:58,472
- He'll say
- He'll say

33
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,281
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing

34
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:18,159
For the one I love

35
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,662
- To find me
- To find me

36
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,499
- Today
- Today

37
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,169
- Oh!
- Hello.

38
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,338
- Oh.
- Did I frighten you?

39
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,507
Wait! Wait, please.

40
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:36,135
Don't run away.

41
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:39,847
Now that I've found you

42
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:44,226
Hear what I have to say

43
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:47,730
One song

44
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,400
I have but one song

45
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:56,864
One song only for you

46
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:04,997
One heart tenderly beating

47
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,918
Ever entreating

48
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:13,422
Constant and true

49
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:17,009
One love

50
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:20,888
That has possessed me

51
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,392
One love

52
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:29,063
Thrilling me through

53
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,566
One song

54
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:36,946
My heart keeps singing

55
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,574
Of one love

56
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,580
Only for you

57
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,597
Take her far into the forest.

58
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,934
Find some secluded glade

59
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,562
where she can pick wildflowers.

60
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:11,772
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,651
And there, my faithful Huntsman,

62
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:18,112
you will kill her!

63
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,740
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!

64
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:22,324
Silence!

65
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,620
You know the penalty if you fail.

66
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,249
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:33,419
But to make doubly sure

68
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,172
you do not fail,

69
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:41,469
bring back her heart in this.

70
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:53,981
One song,
I have but one song

71
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:10,706
Hello there.

72
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,666
What's the matter?

73
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,461
Where's your mama and papa?

74
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,130
Why, I believe you're lost.

75
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:20,674
Oh, please don't cry.

76
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,140
Come on, perk up.

77
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,643
Won't you smile for me?

78
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:32,853
That's better.

79
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:36,398
Your mama and papa can't be far.

80
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,236
There they are!

81
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,989
Can you fly?

82
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,868
Good-bye. Good-bye!

83
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,003
I can't, I can't do it.

84
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,092
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.

85
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,969
I don't understand!

86
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:07,680
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!

87
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,057
- But, but who?
- The Queen.

88
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,183
- The Queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.

89
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,686
Run away, hide!

90
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,772
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!

91
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,734
Now, go. Go! Go!

92
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,947
Run! Run! Hide!

93
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,983
Oh!

94
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,155
Please don't run away.

95
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,908
I won't hurt you.

96
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,497
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

97
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,042
But you don't know
what I've been through.

98
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,837
And all because I was afraid.

99
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:48,507
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.

100
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:52,928
What do you do
when things go wrong?

101
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:57,516
Oh! You sing a song!

102
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:30,507
With a smile and a song

103
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:34,011
Life is just like a bright, sunny day

104
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:37,431
Your cares fade away

105
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:40,100
And your heart is young

106
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:47,441
With a smile and a song

107
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:51,028
All the world seems to waken anew

108
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:54,281
Rejoicing with you

109
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,618
As the song is sung

110
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:01,288
There's no use in grumbling

111
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,959
When raindrops come tumbling

112
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:10,589
Remember you're the one

113
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:16,595
Who can fill the world with sunshine

114
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,307
When you smile and you sing

115
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,145
Everything is in tune and it's spring

116
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,564
And life flows along

117
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:33,821
With a smile and a song

118
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,412
I really feel quite happy now.

119
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,872
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.

120
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,792
Everything's going to be all right.

121
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:51,130
But I do need a place to sleep at night.

122
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,967
I can't sleep
in the ground like you

123
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:57,970
or in a tree the way you do.

124
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:02,641
And I'm sure no nest would possibly
be big enough for me.

125
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:06,311
Maybe you know where I can stay.

126
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:07,938
In the woods somewhere?

127
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,732
You do?

128
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,236
Will you take me there?

129
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,241
Oh, it's adorable!

130
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,786
Just like a doll's house.

131
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,636
I like it here.

132
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:35,400
Ooh, it's dark inside.

133
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:48,080
Guess there's no one home.

134
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:53,126
Hello?

135
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,254
May I come in?

136
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,174
Shh!

137
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,362
Oh!

138
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:25,867
What a cute little chair!

139
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,956
Why, there's seven little chairs!

140
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,542
Must be seven little children.

141
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:38,171
And from the look of this table,
seven untidy little children.

142
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:44,177
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!

143
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,225
And a shoe!

144
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,275
And just look at that fireplace.

145
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:00,235
It's covered with dust.

146
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:10,037
And look, cobwebs everywhere!

147
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,998
My, my, my!

148
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:15,334
What a pile of dirty dishes!

149
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:20,047
And just look at that broom!

150
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,677
Why, they've never swept this room.

151
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:28,138
You'd think their mother would...

152
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:31,683
Maybe they have no mother.

153
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,603
Then they're orphans.

154
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,064
That's too bad.

155
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:39,900
I know!

156
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,527
We'll clean the house
and surprise them.

157
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,571
Then maybe they'll let me stay.

158
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,705
Now, you wash the dishes.

159
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:56,041
You tidy up the room.

160
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,002
You clean the fireplace.

161
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,088
And I will use the broom.

162
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,472
Just whistle while you work

163
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:17,604
And cheerfully together
we can tidy up the place

164
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,815
So hum a merry tune

165
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:26,947
It won't take long when there's a song
to help you set the pace

166
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,282
And as you sweep the room

167
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,493
Imagine that the broom

168
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:36,790
Is someone that you love and soon
you'll find you're dancing to the tune

169
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,752
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.

170
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:43,296
When hearts are high the time will fly

171
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,632
So whistle while you work

172
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,100
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

173
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,977
Not under the rug.

174
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:08,859
So whistle while you work

175
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,219
We dig, dig, dig,
dig, dig, dig, dig

176
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:38,471
In our mine the whole day through

177
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:43,184
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
is what we like to do

178
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,437
It ain't no trick to get rich quick

179
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:47,731
If ya dig, dig, dig
with a shovel or a pick

180
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:52,485
- In a mine
- In a mine

181
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:57,157
Where a million diamonds
- Shine

182
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,283
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

183
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:00,660
From early morn 'til night

184
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:06,374
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
up everything in sight

185
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,002
We dig up diamonds by the score

186
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,212
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more

187
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,548
Though we don't know
what we dig 'em for

188
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,884
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig

189
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:47,707
Heigh-ho

190
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:51,336
Heigh-ho

191
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,964
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

192
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:56,466
Heigh-ho

193
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,887
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

194
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,976
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

195
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,646
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

196
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:15,068
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

197
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,205
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

198
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:31,584
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho, hum

199
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:36,464
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

200
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,927
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

201
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:45,265
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

202
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,270
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

203
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:54,899
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

204
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:03,742
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho...

205
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:17,338
Let's see what's upstairs.

206
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,156
Oh, what adorable little beds!

207
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:48,453
And look,
they have their names carved on them.

208
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:51,498
Doc, Happy,

209
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:52,999
Sneezy, Dopey...

210
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,127
What funny names
for children!

211
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:59,923
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

212
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,927
I'm a little sleepy myself.

213
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,268
Oh! Oh!

214
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:38,002
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

215
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:43,174
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

216
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:48,263
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

217
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:52,892
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

218
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:57,689
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

219
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,619
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

220
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:16,332
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

221
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,962
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

222
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:25,550
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

223
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,637
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh...

224
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:30,889
Look!

225
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,894
Our house! The lit's light...
Uh, the light's lit.

226
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,401
Jiminy Crickets!

227
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,987
The door is open.
The chimney's smoking.

228
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,572
Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.

229
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:49,240
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.

230
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:50,742
Or a dragon.

231
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:54,287
Mark my words,
there's trouble a-brewin'.

232
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:57,790
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.

233
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,585
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.

234
00:27:00,711 --> 00:27:02,712
What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.

235
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:05,548
Yes.
We'll, uh, squeak up... Sneak up.

236
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:08,092
Come on, hen... Uh, men. Follow me.

237
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:27,403
Psst!

238
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,469
Shh!

239
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,265
Shh!

240
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,352
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...

241
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,813
Hook and granny...
Crooked fan...

242
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:03,648
Search everywhere.

243
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,377
Shh!

244
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,712
Quiet.

245
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:33,011
Look! The floor, it's been swept!

246
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,223
Hah!

247
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,183
Chair's been dusted!

248
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:42,020
Our window's been washed.

249
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:44,897
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.

250
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:48,192
Why, why, why, why,
the whole place is clean!

251
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,070
There's dirty work afoot.

252
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:54,198
Sink's empty.

253
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:57,201
Hey, someone stole our dishes!

254
00:28:57,828 --> 00:29:00,913
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.

255
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,001
My cup's been washed.

256
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,337
Sugar's gone.

257
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:11,049
Something's cooking.

258
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,218
Smells good!

259
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:17,388
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.

260
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:23,770
See? It's witches' brew.

261
00:29:25,272 --> 00:29:28,232
Look what's happened
to our stable... Uh, table.

262
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:29,942
Flowers!

263
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:33,696
- Huh?
- Look, goldenrod.

264
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:37,408
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!

265
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:41,579
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I... Oh.

266
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:43,039
Ah...

267
00:29:43,123 --> 00:29:44,248
Ahhh...

268
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,129
Thanks!

269
00:29:57,137 --> 00:29:58,429
Hey!

270
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,601
Shh!

271
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,106
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!

272
00:30:08,232 --> 00:30:10,942
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.

273
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:14,487
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.

274
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,073
It's coming.

275
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,369
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.

276
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,413
Oh! Ah... Ah... Ah!

277
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,540
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.

278
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,999
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.

279
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,543
Make a hard knot.

280
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,711
There, that will hold him.

281
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,798
- Thanks!
- Shh!

282
00:30:33,924 --> 00:30:37,135
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?

283
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,643
- What's that?
- That's it.

284
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:49,480
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.

285
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:15,339
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.

286
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:20,678
One of us has gotta go down
and chase it up.

287
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,889
Up. Down.

288
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,867
Here, take it.

289
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,870
Don't be nervous.

290
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:05,556
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.

291
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:07,767
Yes! Right behind ya.

292
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:50,935
Here it comes!

293
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,114
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.

294
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,782
Hold it shut.

295
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:18,004
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.

296
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,213
Get it now!

297
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:20,590
- Quick!
- Give it to it!

298
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:22,675
Don't let it get away!

299
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,764
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

300
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,683
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?

301
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,311
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?

302
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:35,605
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?

303
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:37,315
What was it doin'?

304
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,031
He says it's a,
a monster asleep in our beds!

305
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,074
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.

306
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,200
Yeah, while it's sleeping.

307
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,661
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.

308
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:52,288
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.

309
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:54,123
We'll kill it dead.

310
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:22,943
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!

311
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,862
- Gee!
- What a monster!

312
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:26,489
It covers three beds.

313
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,200
Let's kill it before it wakes up.

314
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:30,910
- Which end do we kill?
- Shh!

315
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,328
Shh!

316
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:01,065
Well, eh, ah...

317
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,569
- What is it?
- Why, it... It's a girl!

318
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:09,407
She's mighty purdy.

319
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:14,078
She's beautiful, just like a angel.

320
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:17,581
Angel, hah! She's a female!

321
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:21,585
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.

322
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,755
What are wicked wiles?

323
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:27,049
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.

324
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:28,300
Shh!

325
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,511
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

326
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,931
Aw, let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.

327
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:35,474
- Look out.
- She's movin'.

328
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,643
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?

329
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,103
Hide.

330
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,109
Oh, dear.

331
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,280
I wonder if the children are...

332
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,284
Oh!

333
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,626
Why, why, you're little men!

334
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,967
How do you do?

335
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:18,142
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?

336
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:21,520
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!

337
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:25,274
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.

338
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:28,277
I know, you're Doc.

339
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:32,156
Why, why, why, yes.
Yes! That's true.

340
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:36,160
And you're, you're Bashful.

341
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,663
Oh, gosh!

342
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,543
And you, you're Sleepy.

343
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,337
How'd you guess?

344
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,674
And you?

345
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,428
And you're Sneezy.

346
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:03,354
- Yes, and you must be...
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.

347
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,105
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

348
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,983
You mean he can't talk?

349
00:37:08,068 --> 00:37:10,027
He don't know. He never tried.

350
00:37:10,153 --> 00:37:12,530
Oh, that's too bad.

351
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:18,160
Oh!

352
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:19,995
You must be Grumpy.

353
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,165
Oh, yes! Yes!

354
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,544
Hah! We know who we are.

355
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,338
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here.

356
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:32,758
Hmph! Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?

357
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:35,970
What are you... Who are you, my dear?

358
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,639
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.

359
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,432
Snow White?
The Princess?

360
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,600
Yes.

361
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:46,272
Well... Well, my,
my dear Quincess... Uh, Princess.

362
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,816
We're, uh, we're honored.
Yes, we're, uh, we're...

363
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,944
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.

364
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,781
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?

365
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,075
Nothing! Just standin' there
sputterin' like a doodlebug!

366
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:00,870
Who, who, who,
who's butterin' like a spoodledug?

367
00:38:00,954 --> 00:38:04,748
- Who's... Uh, gutter...
- Aw, shut up and tell her to get out!

368
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:07,334
Please don't send me away!

369
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,503
- If you do, she'll kill me.
Kill you?

370
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,754
Who will?
Yes, who?

371
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:12,840
- My stepmother, the Queen.
The Queen?

372
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,466
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!

373
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:17,636
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!

374
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,305
I'm warnin' ya.

375
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,223
If the Queen finds her here,

376
00:38:21,308 --> 00:38:24,768
she'll swoop down
and wreak her vengeance on us!

377
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:27,438
But she doesn't know where I am!

378
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:30,441
She don't, eh? She knows everything.

379
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:33,110
She's full of black magic.

380
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:36,280
She can even make herself invisible.

381
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:37,448
Pfft!

382
00:38:38,408 --> 00:38:41,118
Might be in this room right now.

383
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:47,958
Oh, she'll never find me here.

384
00:38:48,418 --> 00:38:51,587
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

385
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:54,298
I'll wash and sew
and sweep and cook and...

386
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:55,591
Cook?

387
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:58,260
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Uh, lumple dapplins?

388
00:38:58,345 --> 00:39:00,888
Apple dumplings!
- Eh, yes!

389
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,598
Crapple dumpkins.

390
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:04,850
Yes, and plum pudding
and gooseberry pie...

391
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:08,145
Gooseberry pie?
Hooray! She stays!

392
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,000
Ah!

393
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:31,752
Soup!

394
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,295
Hooray!

395
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,312
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

396
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:52,022
Just a minute.

397
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,069
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.

398
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,989
Wash? Wash?

399
00:40:00,073 --> 00:40:03,659
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.

400
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:09,331
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

401
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:11,417
'Tain't New Year's.

402
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,628
Oh, perhaps you have washed.

403
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:16,338
Perhaps we...

404
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:21,552
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?

405
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:25,097
When? When. Uh, you said whe...

406
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:30,102
Why, last week.
Why, recently!

407
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:34,356
Yes, recently!

408
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,860
Oh, recently!

409
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,238
Let me see your hands.

410
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:49,747
Let me see your hands!

411
00:40:55,378 --> 00:40:58,422
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!

412
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:04,428
Come on, let's see them.

413
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:08,640
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!

414
00:41:09,225 --> 00:41:10,559
And you?

415
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,231
Worse than I thought!

416
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:17,941
Oh!

417
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:21,904
How shocking!

418
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,992
Goodness me, this will never do.

419
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:33,123
March straight outside and wash,
or you'll not get a bite to eat.

420
00:42:04,614 --> 00:42:05,781
Hah!

421
00:42:08,701 --> 00:42:11,620
Well, aren't you going to wash?

422
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:16,500
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

423
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:29,346
Oh! Did you hurt yourself?

424
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,360
Hah, women!

425
00:42:45,238 --> 00:42:47,156
Courage, men, courage.

426
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:50,367
Don't be nervous.

427
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:55,873
Gosh, it's wet!

428
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,543
It's cold, too!

429
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,296
We ain't gonna do it, are we?

430
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,215
Well, it'll please the Princess.

431
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:07,676
I'll take a chance for her!

432
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,052
Me, too!

433
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:12,431
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.

434
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,642
But I'm warnin' ya,
you give 'em an inch,

435
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,936
and they'll walk all over ya!

436
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,523
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.

437
00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:24,776
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?

438
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,195
Do ya get in the tub?

439
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:28,780
Do ya have to wash
where it doesn't show?

440
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:32,034
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.

441
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:34,953
Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace

442
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,873
Just pull up your sleeves
and get 'em in place

443
00:43:37,957 --> 00:43:41,126
Then scoop up the water
and rub it on your face and go...

444
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:47,549
Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff

445
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:50,052
Work up a lather
And when you got enough

446
00:43:50,136 --> 00:43:53,263
Get your hands full of water
and you snort and you snuff and go...

447
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:59,144
You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub

448
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,230
You sputter and splash
all over the tub

449
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:04,983
You may be cold
and wet when you're done

450
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,945
But you gotta admit
it's good and clean fun

451
00:44:08,071 --> 00:44:10,906
So splash all you like
'Tain't any trick

452
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:14,409
As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick

453
00:44:14,494 --> 00:44:17,412
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...

454
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,347
Hah! Next thing ya know

455
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:38,600
she'll be tyin' your beards up
in pink ribbons

456
00:44:38,685 --> 00:44:43,146
and smellin' ya up with
that stuff called "perfoom. "

457
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:44,356
Hah!

458
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:12,968
A fine bunch of water lilies
you turned out to be.

459
00:45:14,387 --> 00:45:18,056
I'd like to see anybody
make me wash if I didn't wanna.

460
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:51,506
Get him!

461
00:45:52,925 --> 00:45:54,760
Hey, let go of me!

462
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:57,471
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.

463
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:59,639
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!

464
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:02,601
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!

465
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:05,187
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.

466
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:10,067
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...

467
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:16,573
Get the soap!

468
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,252
Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.

469
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,388
Never say die. Never say die.

470
00:46:39,472 --> 00:46:40,972
You don't...

471
00:47:02,412 --> 00:47:04,955
Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied

472
00:47:05,081 --> 00:47:07,582
That he'll look mighty cute
as soon as he's dried

473
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:10,669
Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go...

474
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:28,979
Ain't he sweet?

475
00:47:29,188 --> 00:47:31,356
Smells like a petunia.

476
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:34,276
He sure is cute!

477
00:47:35,361 --> 00:47:37,654
You'll pay dearly for this!

478
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:38,989
Supper!

479
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:43,452
- Supper!
Food. Hooray!

480
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,665
Hah!

481
00:48:05,475 --> 00:48:08,101
Magic Mirror on the wall,

482
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:11,521
who now is the fairest one of all?

483
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:15,484
Over the seven jeweled hills

484
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:18,111
beyond the seventh fall,

485
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:20,697
in the cottage of the seven dwarfs

486
00:48:21,157 --> 00:48:25,494
dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.

487
00:48:26,412 --> 00:48:30,624
Snow White lies dead in the forest.

488
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:33,376
The Huntsman has brought me proof.

489
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,880
Behold her heart.

490
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:40,383
Snow White still lives,

491
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,594
the fairest in the land.

492
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:47,432
'Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

493
00:48:48,267 --> 00:48:50,060
The heart of a pig!

494
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:52,729
Then I've been tricked!

495
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:18,129
The heart of a pig!

496
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:20,757
The blundering fool!

497
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:24,553
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage

498
00:49:24,637 --> 00:49:27,556
in a disguise so complete

499
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,101
no one will ever suspect.

500
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:38,316
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness,

501
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:42,779
change my queenly raiment
to a peddler's cloak.

502
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:47,617
Mummy Dust to make me old.

503
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:52,080
To shroud my clothes,
the black of night.

504
00:49:56,085 --> 00:50:00,589
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.

505
00:50:08,347 --> 00:50:12,309
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.

506
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,481
A blast of wind

507
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:22,027
to fan my hate!

508
00:50:23,529 --> 00:50:25,739
A thunderbolt

509
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:29,826
To mix it well.

510
00:50:31,537 --> 00:50:32,871
Now,

511
00:50:33,873 --> 00:50:37,000
begin thy magic spell.

512
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:01,691
Look!

513
00:51:02,652 --> 00:51:04,027
My hands!

514
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,368
My voice!

515
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,287
My voice.

516
00:51:18,751 --> 00:51:21,670
A perfect disguise.

517
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,717
And now...

518
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,721
A special sort of death

519
00:51:32,348 --> 00:51:34,391
for one so fair.

520
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:37,060
What shall it be?

521
00:51:37,603 --> 00:51:38,770
Ah!

522
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:42,273
A poisoned apple!

523
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:45,110
Sleeping Death.

524
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:48,423
I'd like to dance
and tap my feet

525
00:52:48,507 --> 00:52:50,425
But they won't keep in rhythm

526
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:54,554
You see, I washed 'em both today
and I can't do nothin' with 'em

527
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:58,558
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

528
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:02,312
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

529
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:15,533
I...

530
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:24,209
Oh, gosh!

531
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:32,967
I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb

532
00:53:33,052 --> 00:53:35,970
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him

533
00:53:37,306 --> 00:53:41,184
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

534
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,187
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

535
00:54:55,509 --> 00:54:58,177
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...

536
00:54:58,304 --> 00:55:00,263
Watch... Watch...

537
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,684
Thanks.

538
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:53,232
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

539
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:55,193
Hey! Hey!

540
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:04,827
Hooray!

541
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,618
That was fun!

542
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,453
Now you do something.

543
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:49,163
Well, what shall I do?

544
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:52,792
- Tell us a story.
Yes, tell us a story.

545
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,878
- A true story.
- A love story.

546
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,966
Well, once there was a princess.

547
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:02,635
Was the princess you?

548
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,805
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?

549
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,099
Oh, it was very easy.

550
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:11,436
Anyone could see that the Prince
was charming.

551
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:13,646
The only one for me.

552
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:16,315
Was he strong and handsome?

553
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,151
Was he big and tall?

554
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:21,988
There's nobody like him
anywhere at all.

555
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:24,115
Did he say he loved ya?

556
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:26,242
Did he steal a kiss?

557
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:29,495
He was so romantic

558
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:34,500
I could not resist

559
00:57:44,011 --> 00:57:49,766
Some day my prince will come

560
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:55,605
Some day we'll meet again

561
00:57:56,315 --> 00:58:02,278
And away to his castle we'll go

562
00:58:03,155 --> 00:58:06,657
To be happy forever

563
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:08,868
I know

564
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,163
Hah! Mush!

565
00:58:12,831 --> 00:58:18,211
Some day when spring is here

566
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:24,383
We'll find our love anew

567
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:30,056
And the birds will sing

568
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:35,895
And wedding bells will ring

569
00:58:37,397 --> 00:58:42,819
Some day when my dreams

570
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:46,864
Come true

571
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:01,462
Oh, my goodness!

572
00:59:01,547 --> 00:59:03,464
It's past bedtime.

573
00:59:03,549 --> 00:59:05,550
Go right upstairs to bed.

574
00:59:07,886 --> 00:59:10,179
Wait! Hold on there, men!

575
00:59:11,932 --> 00:59:16,269
The, uh, Princess will sleep
in our beds upstairs.

576
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:17,895
But where will you sleep?

577
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:22,775
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable
down here in... in...

578
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,026
In a pig's eye!

579
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:27,280
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...

580
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:30,074
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?

581
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:33,244
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.

582
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:36,247
Now don't you worry about us.

583
00:59:36,373 --> 00:59:41,377
We'll be all right, ma'am.
Go right on up now, my dear.

584
00:59:41,461 --> 00:59:43,713
Well, if you insist.

585
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:47,258
Good night.

586
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:49,218
Good night, Princess.

587
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:54,182
You're sure you'll be comfortable?

588
00:59:54,266 --> 00:59:57,560
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.

589
00:59:58,645 --> 01:00:00,646
Well, pleasant dreams.

590
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:03,649
Pleasant dreams.

591
01:00:08,822 --> 01:00:09,864
Let go!

592
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:11,782
- I saw it first!
Now, men, don't get excited.

593
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:14,202
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.

594
01:00:14,286 --> 01:00:16,621
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!

595
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:34,472
Bless the seven little
men who have been so kind to me.

596
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:39,018
And... And may my dreams come true.

597
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:40,770
Amen.

598
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:45,191
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.

599
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,027
Hah! Women!

600
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:56,369
A fine kettle of fish!

601
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:43,142
Dip the apple in the brew.

602
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:47,605
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!

603
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:01,327
Look! On the skin!

604
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:05,498
The symbol of what lies within.

605
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:10,836
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.

606
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,672
To make her hunger for a bite.

607
01:03:16,968 --> 01:03:18,594
Have a bite?

608
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:23,808
It's not for you.

609
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,185
It's for Snow White.

610
01:03:27,312 --> 01:03:29,939
When she breaks the tender peel

611
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,775
to taste the apple in my hand,

612
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:36,612
her breath will still, her blood congeal.

613
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:40,366
Then I'll be fairest in the land!

614
01:03:43,328 --> 01:03:44,787
But wait!

615
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:48,707
There may be an antidote.

616
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:50,960
Nothing must be overlooked.

617
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:55,965
Oh, here it is!

618
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,561
"Love's First Kiss. "

619
01:04:08,728 --> 01:04:09,979
Bah!

620
01:04:10,564 --> 01:04:12,398
No fear of that.

621
01:04:12,899 --> 01:04:15,359
The dwarfs will think she's dead.

622
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,988
She'll be buried alive!

623
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:33,043
Buried alive!

624
01:04:44,764 --> 01:04:46,098
Thirsty?

625
01:04:46,725 --> 01:04:47,766
Have a drink!

626
01:05:48,787 --> 01:05:50,496
Now, don't forget, my dear.

627
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,249
The... The old Queen's a sly one,

628
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,376
full of witchcraft.

629
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,670
So beware of strangers.

630
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:00,839
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

631
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,343
See you tonight.

632
01:06:06,513 --> 01:06:09,848
Uh, yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.

633
01:06:14,354 --> 01:06:16,021
Be awful careful

634
01:06:16,523 --> 01:06:19,858
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...

635
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:24,113
- Good-bye.
- Oh, gosh!

636
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:28,117
Hah! Disgustin'!

637
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:31,829
And be sure to watch out...
To wa... To wa...

638
01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:33,455
To wa...

639
01:06:33,832 --> 01:06:35,291
Watch out.

640
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:38,002
Thanks.

641
01:07:07,032 --> 01:07:09,533
Well... All right.

642
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:14,455
But that's the last... Wha...

643
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:18,042
Oh, go on. Run along.

644
01:07:19,711 --> 01:07:21,920
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

645
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:23,881
It's off to work we go

646
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,509
Heigh-ho

647
01:07:27,636 --> 01:07:29,720
Good-bye! Good-bye!

648
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:35,643
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.

649
01:07:36,227 --> 01:07:38,979
Why, Grumpy, you do care.

650
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:04,546
Hah!

651
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:20,604
Good-bye, Grumpy!

652
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:34,576
The little men will be away

653
01:08:34,703 --> 01:08:37,204
and she'll be all alone

654
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:41,250
with a harmless old peddler woman.

655
01:08:43,545 --> 01:08:46,755
A harmless old peddler woman!

656
01:08:56,891 --> 01:09:01,645
Some day
my prince will come

657
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:07,401
Some day we'll meet again

658
01:09:07,485 --> 01:09:12,322
And away to his castle we'll go

659
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:17,494
To be happy forever I know

660
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:25,085
Some day when spring is here

661
01:09:25,837 --> 01:09:30,007
We'll find our love anew

662
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:34,678
And the birds will sing

663
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:40,017
And wedding bells will ring

664
01:09:40,435 --> 01:09:44,688
Some day when my dreams

665
01:09:45,023 --> 01:09:47,524
Come true

666
01:09:55,366 --> 01:09:57,701
All alone, my pet?

667
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:01,330
Why, why, yes, I am. But...

668
01:10:01,456 --> 01:10:05,042
The, the little men are not here?

669
01:10:06,044 --> 01:10:08,128
No, they're not, but...

670
01:10:08,213 --> 01:10:09,671
Mmm-hmm.

671
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:13,342
Making pies?

672
01:10:14,552 --> 01:10:16,303
Yes, gooseberry pies.

673
01:10:16,387 --> 01:10:18,639
It's apple pies

674
01:10:18,723 --> 01:10:22,017
that make the menfolks' mouths water.

675
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:27,397
Pies made from apples like these.

676
01:10:29,901 --> 01:10:32,486
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!

677
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:36,031
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.

678
01:10:40,578 --> 01:10:41,787
Like to try one?

679
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:44,081
Hmm?

680
01:10:44,749 --> 01:10:47,918
Go on. Go on, have a bite.

681
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:58,262
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!

682
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:01,223
Shame on you,
frightening a poor old lady.

683
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:04,935
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

684
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:09,731
There, there. I'm sorry.

685
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:12,734
Oh! My heart!

686
01:11:13,444 --> 01:11:15,779
Oh, my... My poor heart.

687
01:11:16,698 --> 01:11:19,741
Take me into the house and let me rest.

688
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:22,953
A drink of water, please.

689
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:54,943
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

690
01:11:55,069 --> 01:11:59,281
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

691
01:12:01,993 --> 01:12:03,619
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

692
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:19,343
Hey, look!

693
01:12:25,016 --> 01:12:28,268
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!

694
01:12:28,353 --> 01:12:30,187
Go on! Get outta here!

695
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:37,361
What ails these crazy birds?

696
01:12:38,154 --> 01:12:39,613
They've gone plumb daffy.

697
01:12:39,697 --> 01:12:40,864
Yeah, they've...

698
01:12:47,121 --> 01:12:51,458
And because you've been
so good to poor old Granny,

699
01:12:52,043 --> 01:12:54,670
I'll share a secret with you.

700
01:12:55,213 --> 01:12:57,339
This is no ordinary apple.

701
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,050
It's a magic wishing apple.

702
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:02,886
A wishing apple?

703
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:04,346
Yes!

704
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:09,393
One bite and all your dreams
will come true.

705
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,479
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.

706
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:15,649
Now, make a wish

707
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:18,068
and take a bite.

708
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:20,821
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.

709
01:13:20,905 --> 01:13:22,572
- 'Tain't natural.
There's something wrong.

710
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:25,534
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.

711
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:29,413
Maybe the old Queen's
got Snow White.

712
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:31,206
- The Queen!
Snow White!

713
01:13:31,332 --> 01:13:33,709
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!

714
01:13:33,835 --> 01:13:36,253
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!

715
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:37,796
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?

716
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,090
Yes, yes, what'll we do?

717
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:43,427
Come on! Giddap!

718
01:13:52,854 --> 01:13:55,355
Wait for me! Wait for...

719
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:13,790
There must be something
your little heart desires.

720
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:17,252
Perhaps there's someone you love.

721
01:14:17,879 --> 01:14:19,838
Well, there is someone.

722
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,215
I thought so. I thought so!

723
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:27,179
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.

724
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:30,140
Now, take the apple, dearie,

725
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:31,808
and make a wish.

726
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,730
I wish... I wish...

727
01:14:36,814 --> 01:14:39,107
That's it, go on! Go on.

728
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:55,832
And that he will carry me away
to his castle

729
01:14:57,126 --> 01:15:00,212
where we will live happily ever after.

730
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:03,256
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.

731
01:15:07,678 --> 01:15:09,930
Don't let the wish grow cold!

732
01:15:11,682 --> 01:15:14,684
Oh, I feel strange.

733
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:19,773
- Her breath will still.
- Oh. Oh.

734
01:15:20,942 --> 01:15:24,152
- Her blood congeal.
- Oh.

735
01:15:34,831 --> 01:15:38,166
Now I'll be fairest in the land!

736
01:15:46,884 --> 01:15:48,677
Hurry, hurry.

737
01:15:54,517 --> 01:15:56,143
There she goes!

738
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,539
After her!

739
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:49,738
I'm trapped! What will I do?

740
01:16:50,573 --> 01:16:52,991
The meddling little fools!

741
01:16:57,914 --> 01:17:01,833
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.

742
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:05,670
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!

743
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,173
Look out!

744
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,553
One song

745
01:19:18,637 --> 01:19:20,305
One song

746
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:24,893
I have but one song

747
01:19:25,019 --> 01:19:27,562
- One song
- One song

748
01:19:27,688 --> 01:19:32,400
- Only for you
- For you

749
01:19:32,526 --> 01:19:35,487
One heart

750
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:39,240
Tenderly beating

751
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:43,078
Ever entreating

752
01:19:43,662 --> 01:19:49,084
- Constant and true
- So true

753
01:19:49,168 --> 01:19:52,504
- One love
- One love

754
01:19:52,588 --> 01:19:56,591
That has possessed me

755
01:19:57,218 --> 01:20:00,178
- One love
- One love

756
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:05,517
- Thrilling me through
- So true

757
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:08,770
- One song
- One song

758
01:20:08,896 --> 01:20:13,400
- My heart keeps singing
- Keeps singing

759
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:18,780
- Of one love
- One love

760
01:20:19,407 --> 01:20:25,286
Only for you...

761
01:20:51,814 --> 01:20:57,402
And away
to his castle you'll go

762
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:03,491
To be happy forever we know

763
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:43,323
Good-bye.

764
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:48,453
Good-bye, Grumpy.

765
01:21:49,163 --> 01:21:50,705
Good-bye.

766
01:21:58,047 --> 01:21:59,714
Oh, Dopey.

767
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:05,345
Good-bye!

768
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:26,824
Some day when spring is here

769
01:22:27,701 --> 01:22:32,580
We'll find our love anew

770
01:22:32,706 --> 01:22:36,834
And the birds will sing

771
01:22:36,919 --> 01:22:40,672
And wedding bells will ring

772
01:22:41,882 --> 01:22:45,843
Some day when my dreams

773
01:22:45,928 --> 01:22:49,222
Come true!
