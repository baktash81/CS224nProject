1
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,635
Dad! Dad! Dad!

2
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,429
It burns! Aah!

3
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,015
Dad! No!

4
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,938
Eli?

5
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,570
Eli?

6
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,531
Are you okay?

7
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,910
Had the same dream.

8
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,955
The one where you thought you were cured?

9
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,749
Yeah.

10
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,837
You will be, honey.
That's why we're doing this.

11
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,882
Just one more drive to go, okay?

12
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,635
- Promise?
- Promise.

13
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,430
We'll be there before sunset.

14
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,891
I mean about being cured.

15
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,268
Cross my heart.

16
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,273
You know I love you, right?

17
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,777
I know.

18
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,413
Also declined.

19
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,498
What's that?

20
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,749
Declined.

21
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,756
That's all I got.

22
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,389
Three people, two nights? That's 240.

23
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,599
We stayed one night.

24
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,816
Nice watch.

25
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,362
Let's go. Burning daylight.

26
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,446
We're ready.

27
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,366
Come on, honey.

28
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,749
Holy shit, dude. Check that out.

29
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,043
- What the fresh fuck is that?
- Ha ha ha ha ha.

30
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,921
Houston, we have a problem.

31
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,758
Hey, spaceman,
what planet are you from... Uranus?

32
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,593
Uranus.

33
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,805
Eli.

34
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,517
Come here... honey. Ah. It's me.

35
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,644
It's okay.

36
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,064
Mom. Mom, it's ripped. Mom, it's...

37
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,317
It's ripped. Get the tape.

38
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,194
- It's okay. I got him
- He's gonna pass out.

39
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,740
Eli, you're okay. I got it.

40
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,241
Breathe, Eli.

41
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,870
- I'm sorry.
- Eli, calm down. Take it easy.

42
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,707
Breathe, honey.
Eli, look at me. I'm right here.

43
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,421
Real tough, assholes,
picking on a sick kid.

44
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,049
Don't look at them.
It's just you and me, okay?

45
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,678
Hey, don't look at them.
Look at me, okay? Breathe.

46
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,764
- Go grow up.
- Breathe, honey.

47
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,350
Can you smell that birthday cake
fresh from the oven?

48
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,353
All right, breathe in. Smell it?

49
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,898
Blow out those candles.
Purse your lips.

50
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,400
That's it. Good.

51
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,528
There's a couple more left. Blow 'em out.

52
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,531
That's good.

53
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,203
Now make a wish.

54
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,377
What did you wish for?

55
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,214
I wish I could beat the crap out of them.

56
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,134
Make another wish.

57
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,388
That Dr. Horn can fix me.

58
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,854
Should we get out of here?

59
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,024
- Come on.
- See ya, man.

60
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,776
- Blast off.
- Yeah.

61
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,529
Bye.

62
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,493
Shit.

63
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,537
Asshole.

64
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,366
- Piece of shit.
- The old car never did that.

65
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,869
I wasn't talking about the car.
I was talking about you.

66
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,953
Paul.

67
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,125
What? He knows I'm kidding.

68
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,420
But we did need to tighten our belts
to get you to this doctor, pal.

69
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,131
I know.

70
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,926
Well, she's gonna be worth every penny.

71
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,221
She's a miracle worker. Right?

72
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,979
- Are you gonna show me my card or not?
- Oh.

73
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,356
Is...

74
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,484
this your card?

75
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,236
That is my card.

76
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,280
How'd you do that?

77
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,034
It's not your card. You're lying to me
to make me feel better.

78
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:17,038
Calm down. I wouldn't lie to you,
baby. Right, Paul?

79
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,874
- He's nervous.
- I know.

80
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,546
I miss DC.

81
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,419
Is this where we're staying?

82
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,921
- It is, buddy.
- Yep.

83
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,881
Just for a little while.

84
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,486
Hey, get your stuff. Let's go.

85
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,631
Where's the doorbell?

86
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,757
I don't know.

87
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,894
<i>Welcome, Miller family. This is Dr. Horn.</i>

88
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,814
<i>In order to protect
the integrity of the house,</i>

89
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:11,485
<i>the decontamination chamber
is our only way in or out.</i>

90
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,114
<i>Eli, will you please enter first
by yourself?</i>

91
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,991
We'll be right behind you.

92
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,578
- You're okay.
- You got this.

93
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,065
<i>Raise your arms, please.</i>

94
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,683
Hello, Eli. I'm Dr. Horn.

95
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,397
Hello.

96
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,778
Rose.

97
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,114
Paul.

98
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,741
- Nice to meet you in the flesh finally.
- Dr. Horn.

99
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,954
- These are my nurses... Barbara, Maricela.
- Pleased to meet you.

100
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,330
Did you find the place okay?

101
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,833
- Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Miller.
- Call me Rose.

102
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,836
We're so happy to have you out here.
You're in good hands.

103
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,462
- I know.
- It's so lovely here.

104
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,923
I find the isolation
is good for the soul.

105
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,842
Excuse me.

106
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,015
You can take your suit off now.

107
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,891
You're safe.

108
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,770
- What if there are contaminates?
- There aren't any.

109
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,981
This is a clean house.

110
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,322
- He's a little shy.
- There's no rush.

111
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,826
You have to trust yourself first.
Will you fetch the Millers' luggage?

112
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,202
- Right away.
- Absolutely.

113
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,580
Please, follow me.
I'll show you your room.

114
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,793
- How long will it take?
- The treatment? We do it in three stages.

115
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,962
It's called Viral Gene Therapy.

116
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,758
You see, your immune system produces
too many bad immunoglobulin...

117
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,218
My body carries
a defective RAG1-RAG2 gene.

118
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,138
Which we can correct
using an encoded virus.

119
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,807
- You really know your stuff.
- I read.

120
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,227
Rose and Paul, you'll be on this floor,
but we're gonna go to Eli's room first.

121
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,771
Can't he sleep with us?

122
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,399
Unfortunately, our patients must be
in their own rooms for treatment.

123
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,778
- How long have you been a doctor?
- I've been an immunologist for 25 years,

124
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,280
but I started this clean house
three years ago.

125
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,157
How many patients have you treated?

126
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,450
Quite a few.

127
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,910
And you've cured all of them?

128
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,162
Hmm?

129
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,874
And you've cured all of them?

130
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,878
Eli, I know you're nervous,
but you don't need to be.

131
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,838
I will make you better.

132
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,929
Don't worry about that.
That's the sound of the air filtration.

133
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,389
Sometimes it makes the old piping vibrate.

134
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,600
This is an old house.

135
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,521
It had been abandoned for God knows
how long before I bought it. Shall we?

136
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,191
What's down there?

137
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,736
Not all of the house had been retrofitted
to be a clean environment.

138
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,864
But don't worry. These seals are airtight.

139
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,409
Shall we continue?

140
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,374
Eli.

141
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,505
This is your room, Eli.

142
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,658
I know it's a lot to get used to,

143
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,411
but I hope you don't think of this
as a medical facility.

144
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,956
To me it's a home,
and for now, it's your home.

145
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,502
Is the water safe?

146
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,427
The water here is completely filtered,
purer than bottled water.

147
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,263
Probably a long time
since you've had a shower.

148
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,268
You can trust Dr. Horn, honey.

149
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,436
Breathe.

150
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,647
It's okay to breathe.

151
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,941
It's okay.

152
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,153
That's it.

153
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,005
Oh, it's been so long.

154
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,425
I love you.

155
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,052
I know.

156
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,515
Mwah.

157
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,594
Where'd you get that?

158
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,389
It's for him to wear
when we go home. Do you like it?

159
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,021
Did you see his face
when he took off the suit?

160
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,857
He was so happy.

161
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,151
You remember?

162
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,029
Happy? Hmm?

163
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,615
- I just got a lot on my mind.
- I know.

164
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,160
But this is gonna work.

165
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,581
Everything we hoped for.

166
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,209
Everything I prayed for is right here.

167
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,465
He's gonna get better.

168
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,009
We just gotta have faith.

169
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,387
I do.

170
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,016
I've always been a faithful man.

171
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,690
Hi.

172
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,152
Do you want to come in?

173
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,982
Eli?

174
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,781
My God, you're shaking.

175
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,451
Can I sleep in your bed tonight?

176
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,815
Good morning, Eli. How are you feeling?

177
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,360
- Okay.
- I heard you didn't sleep well.

178
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,491
There was something in my room.

179
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,785
- What was it?
- I don't know.

180
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,414
Like... breathing on the window?

181
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,834
Were you asleep or awake?

182
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,753
Awake.

183
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,546
I think.

184
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,259
Bad dreams are a side effect of
the immunosuppressants you're taking.

185
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,596
I've even had some patients hallucinate.
It's perfectly normal.

186
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,932
Shall we begin?

187
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:45,994
You're not coming?

188
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,748
Mom?

189
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,792
We have to stay here, honey?

190
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,169
We won't move from this spot. Promise.

191
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,342
Eli.

192
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,428
Why don't you make a wish?

193
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,354
What'd you wish for?

194
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,191
That I was brave.

195
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,236
You already are.

196
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,045
Just this way.

197
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,714
Hmm.

198
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,644
Stand there.

199
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,063
Stand there.

200
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,816
Hands in the air.

201
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,199
<i>Seis, sesenta y seis.</i>

202
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,284
Arms out.

203
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,329
Turn around.

204
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
Wait.

205
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,049
<i>Vírese,</i> Eli. Face this way.

206
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,761
Why are you taking my picture?

207
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,763
<i>Listo.</i>

208
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,389
Where are you from?

209
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,187
Do you know what happened to the boy
who asked too many questions?

210
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,315
He got answers?

211
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,532
Stations.

212
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,809
So when did this all start, Eli?

213
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,268
About four years ago.

214
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,604
But it's much worse now.

215
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,108
My patients are all just like you.

216
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,651
All with failing immune systems.

217
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,363
The condition remains dormant
until around your age.

218
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,659
What do you think is making you sick?

219
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,743
Needle.

220
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,704
Lots of things.

221
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,541
The air, water.

222
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,379
- Dust.
- Could be those things.

223
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,923
Could be something else.

224
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,468
Because what is an autoimmune syndrome
at its core?

225
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,224
It's the body fighting itself, right?

226
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,810
In a normal, healthy body,

227
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,563
antibodies are produced by stem cells
in the marrow.

228
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,691
But in your body, that gene is impaired,

229
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,736
so I'm gonna take this modified virus
and inject it into the marrow.

230
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,408
This virus is gonna repair that gene
and reset your entire immune system.

231
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,827
Poof. Like a magic trick.

232
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,704
Right?

233
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,727
Scalpel.

234
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,610
Bone punch.

235
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,575
So, I want you to count back from 100.

236
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,453
One hundred...

237
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,122
Ninety-nine...

238
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,001
Ninety-eight...

239
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,505
Keep counting.

240
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,381
Ninety-seven...

241
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,426
Ninety-six...

242
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,346
Ninety-five...

243
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,725
Ninety-four...

244
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,770
Ninety-three...

245
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,691
Ninety-two...

246
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,658
What-What...

247
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,387
Dr. Horn? Dr. Horn, let me go.

248
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,555
I can't do that, Eli.

249
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,432
Dr. Horn, it burns.

250
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,894
- That's the medication.
- No! No, it really burns.

251
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,396
That means it's working.

252
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,078
No!

253
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,163
Aah!

254
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,960
Boo!

255
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,170
Ha ha ha.

256
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,798
Ah. I shouldn't have done that.

257
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,218
- What, with you being sick and all.
- How do you know I'm sick?

258
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,303
Well, you're in there, aren't you?

259
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,639
That's where all of you stay.

260
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,975
They say you're what, like,
allergic to the world, right?

261
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,353
I-I guess you could say that.

262
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,313
So you've never been outside?

263
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,650
No, I have. I mean,
I wasn't born like this.

264
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,736
My mom-My mom told me
I was a tough birth.

265
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:02,574
She was sick a lot when I was pregnant.
Er, um, when she was pregnant, but...

266
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,785
- I was fine until recently...
- You tell everybody your life story?

267
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,704
Uh...

268
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,915
You're cute. I'm Haley.

269
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,459
I live down the road.

270
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,462
- I'm Eli.
- You're what?

271
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,089
Eli. My name's Eli.

272
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,762
No, I don't like it.
I want to call you something else.

273
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,432
What are you into? What do you like to do?

274
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,477
Um, I like magic... card tricks.

275
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,605
Card tricks? Wow.

276
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,274
No. No, look.

277
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,402
Hold on a sec.

278
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,030
Uh...

279
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,658
Look. Pick a card, any card.

280
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,954
Wait. So I pick a card and then-

281
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,416
and then what, you're gonna, like,
guess what card I picked?

282
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,420
- Uh...
- Hey, you want to see a real trick?

283
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,217
I can light this twig on fire
with my mind.

284
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,428
Don't believe me? Watch.

285
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,143
You scared of fire?

286
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,979
Uh... no.

287
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:20,610
I used to be scared of fire,
then I learned how to master it.

288
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,947
Where's the match?

289
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,658
What match?

290
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,369
Come on. It's what you were doing
when you turned around.

291
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,371
You hid it in your palm
and then distracted me.

292
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,665
A good magician never reveals her secrets.

293
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,208
Come on, tell me.

294
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,043
What's the fun in that?

295
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,671
Some things you just got to
figure out on your own.

296
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,257
Anyway, I got to go.

297
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,217
Wait.

298
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,220
I could ask my parents
if you could come inside.

299
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,765
In there? No, thanks.

300
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,308
Why not?

301
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,856
Look, I don't mean
to freak you out, but...

302
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:02,318
there's just something... off
about the whole place.

303
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,195
Gives me the creeps.

304
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,532
Actually, I'm not even
supposed to be here.

305
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,744
The woman that runs this place,
she doesn't like me.

306
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,623
I don't like her either. She's... shifty.

307
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,333
Shifty?

308
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,753
It's just better
if you don't say anything.

309
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,549
See you later, Houdini.

310
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,546
What are you doing?

311
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,217
You can't wander this place by yourself.

312
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,597
Put this back in your hand.

313
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,147
Where did she go?

314
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,357
Who?

315
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,114
Dear Lord...

316
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,993
we are thankful for everything
that you have given us...

317
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:19,247
and for this time that
we get to spend together as a family.

318
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,544
And especially for placing Dr. Horn
in our paths.

319
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,421
In Jesus' name, amen.

320
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,505
Amen.

321
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,308
Something on your mind, honey?

322
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,310
He's upset because I yelled at him.

323
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,035
I said I was sorry, but he needs to
put that drip back in his hand.

324
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,400
He won't believe me
that I saw someone in the hallway.

325
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,570
- There's another kid in this house.
- Probably one of the nurses.

326
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,363
It wasn't a nurse!

327
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,824
Eli.

328
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,409
Honey.

329
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,577
Calm down, okay?

330
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,412
Calm down.

331
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,248
It was another patient.

332
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,542
Honey, I'm scared, too.

333
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,670
I am. I get scared of new places,
new people sometimes,

334
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,840
but for you, it must be so overwhelming.

335
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,676
On your body and your mind.

336
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,681
But there is nobody else here
except us. I promise.

337
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,150
Here. I got it.

338
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,073
Right.

339
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,866
Eat up.

340
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,208
- Looks like shit.
- Tastes like shit, too.

341
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,103
I knew it.

342
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,273
"For best results,
practice in a dark place."

343
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,993
Who are you?

344
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,901
Aah!

345
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,594
No! No, no! No! No!

346
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,726
Eli, Eli! Listen to me!

347
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,228
- Shh.
- No!

348
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,146
It's Dad. Shh. Shh. Shh.

349
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,400
- Honey.
- Hey, listen to me. Shh. Shh. Shh.

350
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,527
- Hey.
- Paul, do something!

351
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,363
- Do what?
- No! No! No!

352
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,198
Breathe. Breathe.

353
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,702
Breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe.
Just breathe. Just...

354
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,429
It's, uh, it's the medication.

355
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,141
Maybe you could lower the dosage
or something.

356
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,435
I mean, if he's seeing things, I mean...

357
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,496
- We put everything on the line for this.
- I know.

358
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,396
Everything.

359
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,065
- He was terrified, Paul.
- Okay, let her do her job.

360
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,568
I-I'm-I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

361
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,863
What we're doing here
is very hard on Eli's body,

362
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,449
and some of
the symptoms from his condition

363
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,992
are bound to flare up,

364
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,995
but we need to stay the course
of the medication,

365
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,413
especially with Procedure Two.

366
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,789
Why? What do you mean?

367
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,418
Eli's gonna get worse
before he gets better.

368
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:09,972
Hey.

369
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,434
Be strong, sweetheart.

370
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,602
We're right here.

371
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,839
Good news, Eli. We spent the night
working on your stem cells,

372
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,801
and we can confirm
that the gene therapy virus

373
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,177
is correcting the mutation.

374
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,101
This is gonna burn a little bit.
On the count of three.

375
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,521
One, two...

376
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,443
It'll be over before you know it.

377
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,195
- Remain calm.
- It burns.

378
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,114
It hurts!

379
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,868
Aah! Aah, it burns!

380
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,455
Breathe. This is supposed to happen.

381
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,422
Unfortunately, the virus
that's gonna cure your affliction

382
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,674
is unable to cross
the blood-brain barrier,

383
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,050
so we have to penetrate.

384
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,010
Drill.

385
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,221
Relax.

386
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,765
Stress will make your symptoms worse.

387
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:47,987
You're gonna be fine.
You will be.

388
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,072
Jesus, look over my son...

389
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,993
give him the strength to get through this.

390
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,996
You really think praying's gonna help us?

391
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,880
- How is he?
- He had a bit of a reaction today.

392
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,339
A reaction?

393
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,924
Yes. It's quite common.

394
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,511
His body's gonna reject the new cells
just like any transplant. Okay?

395
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,595
Can I see him?

396
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,807
After he's had some rest.

397
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,483
Thank you.

398
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,242
Dr. Horn told me how strong you were...

399
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,286
- There's something shifty about her.
- Shifty?

400
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,370
What?

401
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,542
- I think she's making me sicker.
- No, she's not, Eli. It's the medication...

402
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,670
I know what I saw, Mom,
and it's not the medication.

403
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,006
And if it was, then why do I feel worse?

404
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,633
Because it's working.

405
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,013
The good cells are fighting the bad stuff.
You're bound to feel weak.

406
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,016
I wanna leave.

407
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,727
You want to leave?

408
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,729
Okay.

409
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,815
Let's go. Come on.

410
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,151
Doctor says you're getting better.

411
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,865
You want to leave and stay sick forever,
or do you want to stay and get better?

412
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:15,950
What's it gonna be?

413
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,039
Stay and get better.

414
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,490
Who's there?

415
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,998
That's not real.

416
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:49,043
- Eli.
- That's not real. It's not real.

417
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,060
Let me out!

418
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,812
Please!

419
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,659
No!

420
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,577
No. Please stop!

421
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,376
Mom! Mom, Dad, help!

422
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,980
What did you do?

423
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,153
It wasn't me!

424
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,780
Eli, you were standing
in front of the closet door.

425
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,825
- 'Cause I'd been hiding in there.
- With shards of glass?

426
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,493
They wrote it on my window, too.

427
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,204
- Your name?
- No. "Lie."

428
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,039
You could've hurt yourself, honey.

429
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,336
Eli, none of my other patients
have ever mentioned ghosts.

430
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,426
- Hey.
- No. No one believes me!

431
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,610
Oh, now you decide to show up.

432
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,196
What happened last night?

433
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,072
Did I get you in trouble?

434
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,912
You look terrible.

435
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,372
I feel terrible, too.

436
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:34,749
What happened?

437
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,296
If I tell you,
you have to promise not to laugh.

438
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,380
Just spill it.

439
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,595
I think this house is haunted.

440
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,723
I think something bad happened here.

441
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,393
Great. Now you think I'm crazy, too.

442
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,562
No, I don't think you're crazy.

443
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,814
Then why'd you laugh?

444
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,944
Because Perry,
the kid who stayed here before you,

445
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,237
he said the same thing.

446
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,325
- He did?
- Yep.

447
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,536
Well, I don't talk to him
as much as I talk to you,

448
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,830
but he said that he was seeing ghosts.

449
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,084
Dr. Horn said none of her patients
ever saw ghosts.

450
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,335
And you believe her?

451
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,922
Mom and Dad said to trust her.

452
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,759
Oh, and I'm sure your parents
always tell you the truth.

453
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,848
Perry said the longer he was in there,
the more clearly he saw them,

454
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,558
and he told Dr. Horn that.

455
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,144
- Well, what did she say?
- I don't know.

456
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,730
He said he was about to get
Procedure Three.

457
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,484
And that was the last time I saw him.

458
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:50,409
- I need to get out of here.
- So get your hazmat and go.

459
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,787
I can't. I wouldn't survive outside
without my parents.

460
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,170
Wait here a sec.

461
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,236
Aah.

462
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,575
No!

463
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,493
No! Let go of me!

464
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,332
No!

465
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,142
No! Let me go!

466
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,895
No! Let go of me!

467
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,531
No. No. No!

468
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,743
Let me out! Let me out!

469
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,751
No. No. No!

470
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,964
No. No, stop!

471
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,298
No!

472
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,528
Eli, breathe.

473
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,155
Eli, breathe.

474
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,240
Breathe.

475
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,408
- Breathe.
- Eli?

476
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,451
Eli?

477
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,120
What's going on?

478
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:01,331
I-I heard screams.
He was trying to leave the house.

479
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,458
They opened the door.

480
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,836
Haldol, 20 ccs!

481
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,963
I thought you said this place was secure.

482
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,173
Must have been
an electrical short circuit.

483
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,135
You know about the ghosts.

484
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,761
Eli, you have to stop it.

485
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,887
Hurry, hurry!

486
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,264
I know about Perry!

487
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,393
Who-Who's Perry?

488
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,770
- I-I don't know what you're talking about.
- Lie.

489
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,896
Who's Perry?

490
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,067
Lie! You're a liar!

491
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,987
Someone tell me what's actually going on.

492
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,323
Eli, I'm right here.
Look at me. I'm right here.

493
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,284
Okay? Breathe. Breathe.

494
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,285
Let's make our wish.

495
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,245
I don't want to make a fucking wish!

496
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,339
Mom?

497
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,475
He's...

498
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,233
He's just not...
he's not accepting treatment.

499
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,408
He's just not accepting it. No, he's not.

500
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,330
I think we have to prepare for
the decision. We're just going to do it.

501
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,334
He's not accepting treatment.

502
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,461
So there's no other choice
at this point.

503
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,879
Yeah.

504
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:37,094
I was just saying that I can't believe
that he actually tried to leave.

505
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,765
The last treatment
didn't go as I'd hoped.

506
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,101
Eli's brain is waging a war
against the serum.

507
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,270
That's why he's feeling
so sick and delusional.

508
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,148
I'm going to administer diazepam

509
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,359
to enable him to rest until dawn,

510
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,237
and then we'll begin the final procedure.

511
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,156
Wait.

512
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,535
I think I should be the one
that gives it to him.

513
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,914
He'll take it better coming from me.

514
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,612
I'm not crazy, Mom.

515
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,574
I know you're not.

516
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,910
Dad thinks I am.

517
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,413
No, he doesn't.

518
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,583
- He doesn't.
- Yes, he does.

519
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,920
He looks at me like he doesn't believe me.

520
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,091
You mean the same way
you're looking at me right now?

521
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,182
You know, this is hard for him.

522
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,601
Watching you go through this.

523
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,354
He was the one that found Dr. Horn.

524
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,899
He looked everywhere
for a doctor to help you.

525
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,359
We would never have brought you here

526
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,070
if we didn't think you could go on
and live a normal life.

527
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,326
But you said you believed me.

528
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,495
I do. I believe
that you saw things. I just...

529
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,625
I just don't believe
the things you saw are real.

530
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,506
Hey.

531
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,717
Trust me.

532
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,887
I know the effects
medication can have on the mind.

533
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,723
You see something,
and you swear it was real.

534
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:47,891
But it's not.

535
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,480
I know how hard this is for you.

536
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,400
But it's almost over.

537
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,986
You just need to get some sleep.

538
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,324
- What's that?
- What?

539
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,410
What?

540
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,958
I'm not as good at tricks as some people.

541
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,585
Here.

542
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,466
- What is it?
- It's just something to help you sleep.

543
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,603
Show me.

544
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,233
Good.

545
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,945
Come here.

546
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,783
You know I love you, right?

547
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,660
I know.

548
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,506
Three-one-seven...

549
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,590
What?

550
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,012
Okay, lie down.

551
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,186
Sweet dreams.

552
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,338
Haley.

553
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,597
Bitch. Unh.

554
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,141
Still alive, huh?

555
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:40,271
Listen. Did Perry ever say if the ghost
was trying to hurt him or help him?

556
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,981
He didn't say. Why?

557
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,859
Because they tried to
drag me out of the house,

558
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:48,530
and I'm not sure if they
wanted to kill me or get me to leave.

559
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,157
It kind of sounds like
they wanted to kill you.

560
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,700
Why would you think otherwise?

561
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,083
"Lie"?

562
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:04,587
They wrote that. On my window
and on my closet door.

563
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,298
But if you turn it upside down...

564
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,387
Three-one-seven. What does that mean?

565
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,098
This is what they've been
trying to tell me the entire time.

566
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:19,060
Ooh. Oh, like a secret code
to a secret door.

567
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,562
I never said it was a door.

568
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,940
Don't give me that suspicious look.

569
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,109
It was just the first thing
that entered my head.

570
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,861
You're not a ghost, too, are you?

571
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,157
What kind of drugs do they got you on now?
Do I look like a ghost?

572
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,869
I think it is a code to a door...

573
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,536
to the medical wing.

574
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,080
- What's in there?
- Answers.

575
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,832
- To what?
- To why she's lying.

576
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,835
Are you gonna do it?

577
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,128
What if you get caught?

578
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,299
Everybody's gotta sleep.

579
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,801
Right?

580
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,844
Lie.

581
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,223
What were you and Dr. Horn talking about?

582
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,559
What?

583
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,687
What were you and Dr. Horn talking about?

584
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,231
Before I came along.

585
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,279
Tell me.

586
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,700
Just talking about
the need to be prepared...

587
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,161
for all possibilities.

588
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,914
All possibilities? What do you mean?

589
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,679
Look, she said that
with each procedure, there are...

590
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,306
inherent risks.

591
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,811
He had a bad reaction to the last one.

592
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:36,359
And for every chance that
he's gonna pull through, there's...

593
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,323
- What?
- There's a chance that he won't.

594
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,662
She said that?

595
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,872
It's what she said.

596
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,251
That she doesn't think it's gonna work?

597
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,424
Then I don't understand.

598
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:04,220
She's cured every one of her patients.
That's what you told me.

599
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,392
That's what I told Eli.

600
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,569
Why would you lie to me?

601
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,823
Why would you lie to me about that?

602
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,035
Just tried to do what's best for Eli.

603
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,498
You knew this was always
a possibility, Rose.

604
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,208
Is his life in danger?

605
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,545
Is it?

606
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,846
How dare you?

607
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:47,930
How dare I?

608
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,057
- I'm leaving.
- How dare I?!

609
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,727
- I'm taking him with me.
- After what you did?

610
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,480
You're the one
that wanted to try anything!

611
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,692
<i>And you're in denial.</i>

612
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,070
<i>We had one chance to do the right thing.</i>

613
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,198
<i>Rose. Rose!</i>

614
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:27,929
Eli.

615
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,600
"Perry. Treatment 1."

616
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,022
"Treatment 2."

617
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,776
Treatment 3.

618
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,117
"Agnes. Treatment 1."

619
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,370
Treatment 2.

620
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,040
Treatment 3.

621
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,461
"Lucius. Treatment 1."

622
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,339
"Treatment 2."

623
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,509
"Treatment 3."

624
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,931
Mom! Dad, we have to leave!

625
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,720
Take a breath, Rose.

626
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:57,995
Open the door.

627
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,205
Open this door!

628
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:04,418
I am leaving, and I'm taking him with me.

629
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,505
- Where would you go?
- Anywhere. As far away as possible.

630
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:10,549
And keep him hidden in a glass cage
away from the world?

631
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,761
- What kind of life is that?
- A life where he is loved.

632
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:20,518
No amount of love
can protect him from his condition.

633
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:25,189
You know that. You've seen with
your own eyes how bad it can get.

634
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:28,609
It will only get worse,
and by then, it's gonna be too late.

635
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,447
Out there, there's nothing but suffering.

636
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,908
There's only suffering for him in here.

637
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,245
- In here, there's still a chance.
- Is there?

638
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,416
I need to know that you can save him.

639
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,503
With you by my side, I can, Rose.

640
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:55,928
Mom!

641
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,320
Must have gotten in last night.

642
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:18,034
Dad. Dad, where's Mom?
We all need to leave right now.

643
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,619
- She'll be back in a minute.
- No.

644
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,496
No, we have to leave right now.

645
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,582
Dad, it's her. It's Dr. Horn.

646
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,126
I saw her files.

647
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:29,879
None of her patients
made it past the third procedure.

648
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,881
Dad, they all died.

649
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:39,013
You remember the old meadow?

650
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,934
The one we took Bronson to
when he was just a pup.

651
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:51,358
Last night, I had a dream that
we were playing ball in the old meadow...

652
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,613
and Bronson was chasing the ball.
He was attacking it.

653
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,198
Remember how he used to do that?

654
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,241
Dad.

655
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,162
You're scaring me.

656
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,123
No, no, no. Come here.

657
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,714
You are so loved, Eli.

658
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,217
You know that.

659
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,930
Sometimes I get jealous of you,
the way Mom...

660
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,892
says, "You know I love you, right?"
And you say...

661
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,852
I know.

662
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,773
Like it's nothing to you.

663
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:37,196
That makes me happy, the way you say it
like that, like it's nothing.

664
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,407
Love is normal.

665
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,451
There's just no doubt in your mind.

666
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:45,579
Eli.

667
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,625
I'm so... sorry...

668
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,002
for all this.

669
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:56,549
Come here.

670
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,345
Ow! Aah!

671
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:03,764
Why did you do that?

672
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:08,602
Take him to the exam room.

673
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,605
Let go! She's brainwashed you!

674
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:16,569
Mom! Dad! You have to believe me!
I saw the files!

675
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,862
Aah!

676
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,865
- Let go!
- This is for your own good.

677
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:25,035
No! No, she's gonna kill me!

678
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,829
Like she killed the others!

679
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,665
- Let go!
- Why isn't the sedation working?

680
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:33,419
Mom! Mom, please, you have to believe me!

681
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,379
She killed all her...

682
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,674
Oh...

683
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:43,554
Ow!

684
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,556
Eli!

685
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:47,808
Eli! Stop!

686
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,734
- Eli.
- She moved them!

687
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,819
- She knows I know.
- Settle down.

688
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,696
You killed your patients, didn't you?

689
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,742
You experimented on them,
and then you murdered them!

690
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:08,120
But they're still here!
They're still here in this house!

691
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,747
- Eli, breathe.
- Get back!

692
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,124
- You are sicker than you realize.
- You get away from me!

693
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,334
Get back, all of you!

694
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:18,047
I thought they were trying to hurt me,
but they never hurt anyone.

695
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,466
- It was you the whole time.
- Eli, take a breath.

696
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,908
Eli, we're all just trying to help you.

697
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:48,827
Open the door.

698
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,454
- Eli.
- Eli!

699
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:54,208
Okay, we'll get in another way.
Come with me.

700
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,880
Mom, Dad, I was right. This place is not...

701
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:27,384
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Let me out!

702
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,179
- Let me out. I can't breathe!
- You can't leave him in there.

703
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,305
I can't breathe!

704
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,141
- We have to.
- No!

705
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:35,559
He knows.

706
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,667
Eli.

707
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,015
I can breathe.

708
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,729
I can breathe.

709
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:21,813
I can breathe.

710
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:34,410
Mom! Mom, Dad, I'm not sick!

711
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,744
I can breathe!

712
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,626
Why did you tell me I was sick?

713
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,047
Why did you tell me I was gonna die?

714
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:51,343
Let me out! Let me out!

715
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:56,432
- Please, Mom, let me out!
- Rose.

716
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,058
Let me out!

717
01:13:58,725 --> 01:13:59,726
Rose.

718
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,522
I know he's awake, but we're almost ready.

719
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:06,042
- I need to see him.
- I wish you wouldn't. If we just proceed...

720
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:07,109
I'm not asking.

721
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,244
Eli.

722
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,705
Eli, can you hear me?

723
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,002
I'm sorry I lied to you.

724
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,798
You were never allergic to the outside,

725
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,260
but I had to make you believe you were
to protect you.

726
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,014
Protect you from the world.

727
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,733
I know this must be so confusing...

728
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,068
and scary...

729
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:53,489
but no one's trying to hurt you, honey.

730
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:56,408
And none of this is your fault.

731
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:00,454
It's mine.

732
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:07,711
But, baby, you've got to
see this last procedure through,

733
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:11,381
and then I promise you,
I will explain everything.

734
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,302
Eli.

735
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,055
Eli.

736
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:21,600
Eli.

737
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,685
Aah!

738
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,031
- That was Eli.
- Eli!

739
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,741
Eli! No!

740
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,119
Eli!

741
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,329
Aah!

742
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,638
Eli!

743
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:00,973
Open this door!

744
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,475
Open the door!

745
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,937
- What's happening?
- They lied to me!

746
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,898
I'm not sick!

747
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,068
They're gonna kill me!

748
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:38,218
Open this door! You don't understand
what's happening here!

749
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:41,513
- I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

750
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,557
You're so much stronger than the others.

751
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,643
Eli! Open this door!

752
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,317
Don't be afraid.

753
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,401
No!

754
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,236
Don't be afraid, Eli.

755
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,447
- No!
- Don't be afraid.

756
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,908
- You.
- They're the ones who are afraid!

757
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,536
No! No! No!

758
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:33,857
Oh!

759
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,407
No! Let go!

760
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,373
- No!
- Get his shirt off.

761
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:51,083
- No!
- Get his shirt off.

762
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,923
No! Unh. Dad!

763
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:00,425
Why are you doing this? No!

764
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:04,262
No! No! No!

765
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,391
What are you doing?

766
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:13,313
Rose. What are you doing?

767
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,273
He was right.

768
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,694
She wants to kill him.

769
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:21,822
I saw the bodies of the children.

770
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,574
She buried them down there.

771
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:28,453
She didn't save any of them.

772
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:32,499
Why did you tell me you could save him?

773
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,876
Because I can.

774
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,587
I thought I could cure Eli.
God knows I wanted to.

775
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:40,966
The gene therapy would've worked
if he weren't so strong.

776
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:44,636
He's too far gone,
but he could still be saved.

777
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,849
- Mom, what is she talking about? Mom!
- Get back! Get back!

778
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,601
Don't you touch my son.

779
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:53,937
We've got to get him out of here.

780
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,523
He cannot leave here. You know that.
Not the way he is.

781
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:59,568
I'll get you out of here, honey.
We're gonna leave.

782
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,319
Honey, get this...

783
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:04,781
- Get off of me!
- Rose. Rose.

784
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,367
Let me help you.

785
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,384
You're gonna help me get him out of here.

786
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:13,540
I'll help you.

787
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:14,791
- Promise?
- Yes.

788
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:17,169
Untie him, please.

789
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:23,884
Save him.

790
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,097
Paul.

791
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,682
- Paul, what are you doing?
- No!

792
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:34,227
- I can save his soul.
- No. What are you doing?

793
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,188
- She's gonna kill him!
- No!

794
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,773
- No!
- No!

795
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,983
Get off of me! No, get off me!

796
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:41,066
- No!
- Dad!

797
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,653
- Rose!
- Dad!

798
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,739
What are you doing?

799
01:19:45,822 --> 01:19:48,408
Dad! Dad, why are you doing this?

800
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,619
No! No!

801
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,539
Eli...

802
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,335
you were brought here with love and hope.

803
01:19:58,418 --> 01:19:59,294
No!

804
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:02,464
Your parents have been working with me
for longer than you realized.

805
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:04,466
No. No!

806
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:06,134
The sickness you have...

807
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,220
I'm not sick. I could breathe.

808
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,055
I could breathe.

809
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,518
The sickness you have
doesn't come from outside.

810
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:16,686
It comes from within.

811
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:18,605
What did I do?

812
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,609
- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything wrong.

813
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:25,570
But you will.

814
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,910
Mom! Mom, what's happening?

815
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:37,082
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

816
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:38,208
Amen.

817
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:47,133
Saint Michael the Archangel,

818
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:49,219
illustrious leader of the heavenly army,

819
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:51,982
defend us in the battle against
the rulers of the world of darkness,

820
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:54,266
and in the spirit of wickedness
in high places,

821
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,977
- heed my prayer.
- Let our prayers be heard by thee.

822
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:03,567
God arises, his enemies scattered,
and those who hate him flee before him.

823
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:10,490
"Accursed diabolical legion,

824
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:13,535
we abjure you by the living God,
by the true God, by the holy God,

825
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:17,122
who so loved the world that he gave us
his only begotten son

826
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:20,458
so that those who believe in him
may not perish but have everlasting life.

827
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,627
Begone, serpent, master of lies!

828
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:26,339
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
deliver us!

829
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,885
No! Aah! Aah!

830
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,099
May this holy water purify the skin.

831
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:53,617
May this dagger...

832
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,578
purify the soul.

833
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:06,796
May you find peace and forgiveness

834
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,506
in the arms of the Lord, Eli.

835
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:10,550
Eli!

836
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,305
Aah!

837
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:35,033
Aah.

838
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:38,411
No!

839
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:43,708
Dr. Horn!

840
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,502
- Dr. Horn!
<i>- Dios mío!</i>

841
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:47,712
Dr. Horn. Dr. Horn!

842
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:19,744
Come on, get up! We gotta get out of here!

843
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:28,920
Open the door!

844
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,089
Oh, my God!

845
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:35,844
Watch.

846
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,314
Eli.

847
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:54,279
What has she been putting inside me?

848
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:56,990
Let them go.

849
01:23:57,949 --> 01:24:00,618
What have you been putting inside me?

850
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,039
Medicine...

851
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:06,750
to make you feel better.

852
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:09,711
Lie!

853
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:10,837
Holy water.

854
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:13,631
It's holy water.

855
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:17,427
The injections were tannis roots.

856
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,389
Suppression medication
while she worked on your genes.

857
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:29,397
What am I?

858
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:31,691
What am I?!

859
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:32,942
You're our son.

860
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:34,903
Lie!

861
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:39,991
You're my son!

862
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,411
And my father?

863
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,457
I prayed, Eli.

864
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,710
I prayed every day.

865
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:53,588
Prayed to who?

866
01:24:58,885 --> 01:24:59,928
Prayed to who?!

867
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:16,069
Prayed... to... who?

868
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:17,821
The Lord didn't answer me.

869
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,033
But your father did.

870
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:26,079
He promised me
you wouldn't be like him, Eli.

871
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:29,457
But he lied.

872
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,506
The Devil always lies.

873
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,093
Eli.

874
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,239
I wanted you so desperately.

875
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:11,749
Forgive me.

876
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,026
Eli.

877
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:03,319
Hey, Houdini.

878
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,950
I knew you were stronger than the others.

879
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:11,618
The others?

880
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:13,997
Perry?

881
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,291
And Lucius and Agnes,

882
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:18,835
your sadly departed
half-brother and sister.

883
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:23,840
Dad gets around.

884
01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:28,177
If you knew the whole time,
you could've just told me.

885
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,638
Would you have believed me if I had?

886
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:33,766
Sometimes you just have to
walk the path for yourself.

887
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:37,228
Besides, we're not allowed
to set each other free.

888
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:38,354
Why not?

889
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:41,399
Um, Dad says you got to earn your place.

890
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:43,776
My dad.

891
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:47,363
I can take you to him if you want.

892
01:28:52,952 --> 01:28:54,370
You still trust her?

893
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,126

Oh, God.
