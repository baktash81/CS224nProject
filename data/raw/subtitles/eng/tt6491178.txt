00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,087
On the fire escape.

183
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,835
His deaf girlfriend's in here.

184
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,176
You guys gonna shoot her?

185
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,340
- She's got a gun.
- 75 percent chance, yeah.

186
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,808
All right. Where do you want me?

187
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,895
Window.

188
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,317
Should've let the plumber in.

189
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,775
[Whispers] One, two...

190
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,418
Police. Okay?

191
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,916
Comprende, siono?

192
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,127
That handbag seemed a little heavy.

193
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,056
Even taking into account
the amount of makeup Latina's carry?

194
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,428
Yeah, even still.

195
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,727
She's got a gun.

196
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,146
[Gasps]

197
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,236
Come on. Come on, honey.

198
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,114
You stay there.

199
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,496
Why don't you shut the doors
and crank up the fans?

200
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,726
Where did your novio put
that green duffel bag you got last night?

201
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,434
Can I have something to wear?

202
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,564
I'm cold.

203
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,149
I didn't understand that, did you?

204
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
No.

205
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,402
Sounded kind of like dolphin.

206
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,319
I expect she'll get more intelligible
when she answers our questions.

207
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,238
- Where's the green duffel bag?
- I wanna call a lawyer.

208
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,915
I wanna... [stutters]

209
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,500
Where's the green duffel bag?

210
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,588
We saw Vasquez bring it here
last night at 11:00,

211
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,136
that swell guy who fled
and left you here with us.

212
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,140
- Least he had time...
- [Ball rolls]

213
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,843
To get his soul mate.

214
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,814
Tell us where it is,

215
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,693
and my partner and I will be done in time
to get the breakfast special at Bert's.

216
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,652
Maybe that's reason enough to forget
all about you and that gun of yours.

217
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,959
Where is it?

218
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
The closet.

219
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,924
There.

220
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,388
In the wall behind the suits.

221
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,860
I smell three eggs over easy.

222
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,118
Hash browns...

223
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,124
And pumpernickel toast.

224
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,830
Plus that coffee you owe me.

225
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,393
- Officer.
- [Davids] Detective?

226
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,315
Drag Vasquez back inside.

227
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,403
We got cash, narcotics, and two imbeciles
to drive downtown and paper.

228
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,950
You said if I told you where the bag was,
you'll let me go.

229
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,034
- Can you understand her?
- No.

230
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,204
J we can be considerate j

231
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,632
j to people or strangers j

232
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,381
j until you get to know them

233
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,972
This a guy or a girl singing this song?

234
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,523
J yeah j

235
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,017
j it's raining so hard outside &

236
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,149
j before you go
I'll give you my favorite umbrella &

237
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,851
j to keep you dry

238
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,648
can't tell.

239
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,604
J would you like to have... I

240
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,907
not that there's much of a difference
these days.

241
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,401
I think that line was obliterated...

242
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,863
The day men started saying,
"we're pregnant,"

243
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,289
when their wives were.

244
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,463
Your breakfast specials.

245
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,554
Thanks.

246
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,890
- [Cell phone vibrates]
- [Cell phone chimes]

247
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,941
Didn't know the chief lieutenant
was so fond of intrigue.

248
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,028
Excuse me.

249
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,899
Could you box our food up
in to-go containers?

250
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,323
You want me to pack up
everything I just carried

251
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,621
- from all the way over there?
- Correct.

252
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,916
I'll get some take-out boxes.

253
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,132
You two crash into a truck
filled with breakfast buffet?

254
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,263
We were getting the breakfast specials
at Bert's when we got your message

255
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,517
and we boxed them up
and rode in with their emanations.

256
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,769
I like their pumpernickel toast.

257
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,726
They get it fresh from Jeanette's,
bakery across the way.

258
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,316
[Clears throat]

259
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,444
There's an issue with the bust
you two made this morning.

260
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,618
Who's complaining?

261
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,664
Civilian, saw you out on the fire escape.

262
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,079
Vasquez was armed and a threat.

263
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,785
- We did what was...
- There's a video.

264
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,749
[Sighs]

265
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,546
You've seen it?

266
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,374
I have. It's not terrible.

267
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,301
Certainly could be much, much better.

268
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,549
Sound is shit.

269
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,348
Civilian was too far away
to get anything intelligible.

270
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,592
- That helps us.
- Who tipped you off?

271
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,761
My contact at channel 7.

272
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,181
[Both sigh]

273
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,733
Anchovies.

274
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,108
- When's it airing?
- 6:00.

275
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:07,986
You'll survive.

276
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,238
Though,
I think it'll end our current discussions

277
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,698
about raises and promotions.

278
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,910
[Sighs] Anchovies.

279
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,913
We didn't give Vasquez
that much cast-iron.

280
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,881
- It was mostly me, Anthony...
- He gave him plenty.

281
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,926
Mr. Lurasetti's in that video, too,

282
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,013
smiling like a yearbook picture

283
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,807
when you put your foot
on that hombre's cabeza.

284
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,721
Our inspector...

285
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,641
Our Mexican-American inspector,
is unlikely to be lenient.

286
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:47,401
Though your productivity is exemplary and
it'll keep you from losing your badges.

287
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,490
Politics, like always.

288
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,823
Like cell phones and just as annoying,

289
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,413
politics are everywhere.

290
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,163
Being branded a racist
in today's public forum

291
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,670
is like being accused
of communism in the '50s...

292
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:12,714
Whether it's a possibly offensive remark
made in a private phone call

293
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:17,518
or the indelicate treatment of a minority
who sells drugs to children.

294
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:22,273
The entertainment industry, formerly known
as the news, needs villains.

295
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,600
There's certainly nothing hypocritical
about the media

296
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:29,109
handling every perceived intolerance
with complete and utter intolerance.

297
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,240
[Sighs] It's bullshit.

298
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,448
But it's reality.

299
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,370
But I'm not racist.

300
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,790
Every Martin Luther King day,
I order a cup of dark roast.

301
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,834
How long is this suspension gonna be?

302
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,177
Six weeks.

303
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,346
No pay.

304
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,924
We need the hours.

305
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,806
I know what detectives make in Bulwark.

306
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,349
[Heavy sigh]

307
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,574
Go have some pumpernickel.

308
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,085
Ridgeman.

309
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,084
Gotta be aware of this stuff.

310
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,878
Digital eyes are everywhere.

311
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,632
I do what I think best when I'm out there.

312
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,014
I was that way when we were partners,
and I'm still that way now.

313
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,814
There's a reason I'm sitting
behind this desk running things

314
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,017
and you're out there
crouching on fire escapes

315
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,852
in the cold for hours

316
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,738
with a partner
that's 20 years younger than you.

317
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,692
Hey, Anthony's got a mouth
with its own engine, but he's solid.

318
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,113
That wasn't my point.

319
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,335
[Heavy sigh]

320
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,429
Thanks for letting us know
about this situation,

321
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,924
and any word you can have
with the inspector on our behalf

322
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,218
would be greatly appreciated.

323
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,845
One thing before you go.

324
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,892
I watched that video a couple times.

325
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,146
You threw a lot more cast-iron
than you needed to.

326
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,685
And when we worked together...

327
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,021
You weren't that rough.

328
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,575
And?

329
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,867
It's not healthy for you

330
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,407
to scuff concrete as long as you have.

331
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,333
You get results,

332
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,079
but you're losing perspective
and compassion.

333
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,970
Couple more years out there
and you're gonna be

334
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,836
a human steamroller covered with spikes...

335
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,459
And fueled by bile.

336
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,462
There's a lot of imbeciles out there.

337
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,889
Yeah.

338
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:20,492
Use your time off to think about things.
Talk it over with Melanie.

339
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,821
Spend some time with her and Sara.

340
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,621
Yeah, I will.

341
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,183
I won't.

342
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,103
I won't.

343
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,231
[Woman] Sara?

344
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,990
Yeah, mom, it's me.

345
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,951
Sweetie?

346
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,287
What's wrong?

347
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,177
Sweetie?

348
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,760
Come here.

349
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,100
Good evening.
And welcome back, Mr. lurasetti.

350
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,440
Anybody born in New York

351
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,693
- calls me Tony.
- Tony, it is.

352
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,358
One moment, please.

353
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,099
Is something wrong with it, Tony?

354
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:56,266
No, no, it's beautiful.
Exactly like you promised.

355
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,979
It's... if Denise has any doubts
about saying yes when I'm on my knee,

356
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,860
this will nudge her
in the right direction.

357
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,364
I got an issue at work.

358
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,491

532
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,290
I shall.

533
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,506
Now.

534
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,085
Anthony. Yeah.

535
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,752
Be outside my place at 4:30.

536
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,504
Yup, A.M.

537
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,426
Bring all your hardware
and dress nonchalant.

538
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,408
[Cell phone vibrates]

539
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,890
Are you the famous police officer
I saw in the news?

540
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,064
Any reason you're back there?

541
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:05,779
There is.

542
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,404
- Things okay with you and Melanie?
- They're fine.

543
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,007
Are you gonna tell me
the nature of this endeavor?

544
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,668
I'm gonna sleep.

545
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:24,135
- What are we here...
- You're gonna drive to 19th and Brant.

546
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,576
Why are we going all the way up there?

547
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:31,141
Every answer I give you is gonna engender
three times as many questions.

548
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:34,938
Let me sleep while I can, and
once we're there, you'll get your answers

549
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,480
and a nap if you need one.

550
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,978
Sounds like a stakeout.

551
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,235
19th and Brant.

552
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,907
You realize we're suspended.

553
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,325
Wake me at 18th.

554
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,917
[Ridgeman snores]

555
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,513
We're at 18th.

556
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,685
Corner right.

557
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,286
Before you touch anything.

558
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,126
Ashtray.

559
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,889
One of these big orange things
opened up by my apartment.

560
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,342
Ripe and fresh.

561
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,478
- It's shit?
- I haven't been in it.

562
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,391
I thought Denise cooked.

563
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,984
Only at her place.

564
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:10,441
She only shops at organic stores
that specialize in assuaging guilt.

565
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,497
Let's pull in the other side
of this dumpster.

566
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,714
- This is good?
- It's perfect.

567
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
Take two.

568
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:58,490
Something's going on in room 633
of that tan stucco.

569
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,578
What?

570
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,667
Hard to tell.

571
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,624
Especially because apartment 633
doesn't even exist.

572
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
How do you mean?

573
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,888
Well, there's no door marked 633.

574
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,715
There's no windows or a buzzer.

575
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,385
No mail gets delivered there either.

576
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,856
But it's there.

577
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,103
This is sounding metaphysical.

578
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,020
You got a tip on this?

579
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:30,657
Yeah.

580
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,863
My contact tells me
that one Lorentz Vogelmann

581
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,910
is looking for an invisible residence.

582
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,785
And 633 in this tan stucco
is where he landed.

583
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,672
Vogelmann, I don't know that name.

584
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,758
Well, he's not local.

585
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,343
What line of work is he in?

586
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,300
Distribution.

587
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,763
Heroin, mostly. Large bundles.

588
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,054
[Scoffs]

589
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,766
What are we doing here?

590
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,319
You asking me this question as a civilian?

591
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,443
Because that's what we are right now,
civilians.

592
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,094
No different than kindergarten teachers

593
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,777
or the bum that collects aluminum cans
outside my building.

594
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,737
I know where I flung my badge yesterday.

595
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,657
What are we doing here?

596
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,163
We're monitoring a suspicious individual

597
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,996
to try and figure out if he's got
any money he doesn't need.

598
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,257
[Sighs]

599
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:38,965
Anchovies.

600
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,430
- If you don't wanna be part of this...
- Christ.

601
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,642
Are you insane?

602
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,360
You get suspended, not for the first time
in your career either.

603
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,983
Now you decide to become a criminal?

604
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,498
And what the hell
are you even thinking with this?

605
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,419
Well?

606
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,590
Say something.

607
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,249
Talk!

608
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,680
I'm a month away from my 60th.

609
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,096
I'm still the same rank I was at 27.

610
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,803
For a lot of years,
I believed that the quality of my work,

611
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:29,265
what we do together,
what I did with my previous partners...

612
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,567
Would get me what I deserved.

613
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,739
But I don't politic,
and I don't change with the times.

614
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,943
And it turns out that that shit's
more important than good, honest work.

615
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,581
So yesterday,
after we stop a massive amount of drugs

616
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,159
from getting into the school system,

617
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,711
we get suspended
because it wasn't done politely.

618
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,373
Then I go home and I find
my daughter has been assaulted

619
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,333
for the fifth time in two years...

620
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,592
Because of the shit neighborhood
my shit wages force me to live in.

621
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,882
And my wife can't help.

622
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,389
She's barely getting through the day
on her meds as it is.

623
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:08,231
They okay?

624
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,725
Yeah. Melanie's coping. Sara's doing okay.

625
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,232
She's dealing with it better
than most kids her age would.

626
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,740
But who knows what kind of
long-term damage is going on with her?

627
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,704
There's been opportunities before,
more than a few.

628
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,540
Take a bribe,
pocket a bundle, pilfer cash.

629
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:42,680
I was a cop on active duty. Today,
I'm a poor civilian who's nearly 60.

630
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,850
I can accept that, but I'm not gonna ask
my wife and daughter to.

631
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:52,648
If we put all our collars together,
every imbecile we ever nabbed,

632
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,777
it'd probably fill two entire wings
of the state prison. Maybe three.

633
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:03,155
We have the skills and the right
to acquire proper compensation.

634
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,368
[Sighs]

635
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,368
- Christ.
- Weddings aren't cheap.

636
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,828
Don't be an asshole.
That's not what I'm thinking about.

637
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,962
Do you think our wages
accurately reflect what we...

638
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,335
Enough with the justifications.

639
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:20,168
I'm smarter than you by a yardstick.
You're not gonna manipulate me.

640
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,887
I saw how you looked
at that duffel bag yesterday.

641
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,639
Quiet.

642
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:27,974
Let me think.

643
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,780
Anchovies.

644
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,009
Look, if you don't wanna
hear any more about this,

645
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,523
fling the gear and drop me off.

646
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,241
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I don't need a guardian.

647
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,200
- I can do this myself if I have to.
- You don't know that.

648
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,689
Not for sure, no.
But if things get tricky,

649
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,749
I'll disengage and find something else.

650
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,415
This is a bad idea.

651
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,842
It's bad for you, and it's bad for me.

652
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,967
It's... bad like lasagne in a can.

653
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,512
Well, then, fling the gear
and drop me off.

654
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:19,852
Look, if you do this,
you do it for yourself.

655
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,530
You don't do it
because you pity my situation.

656
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,512
Or because we're partners
or because we're friends

657
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,027
that grill burgers on Sundays
or go to the fights.

658
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,207
You do it solely because you wanna earn.
And that's it.

659
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,884
We disguise ourselves
at the point of contact.

660
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:51,008
Yeah, I got ballistic masks
and vests in the garbage bags,

661
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,718
some teargas bombs as well.

662
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,515
I'm in until I'm not.

663
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,523
- Lorentz Vogelmann?
- Yeah.

664
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,157
- He looks cast-iron.
- He is.

665
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,962
Any idea if his merchandise is in 633?

666
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,961
No idea,
but after we confirm that he's there,

667
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,338
we'll tail him
and we'll learn his itinerary.

668
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,639
You got a time frame?

669
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,925
My contact said
he's rented 633 for two weeks.

670
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,556
We're at day two of that period.

671
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,060
You know anything else about him,
vehicle, associates?

672
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,434
That's what we're learning now.

673
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:44,989
Camera”?

674
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:47,742
Thanks.

675
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,860
[Camera beeps]

676
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,535
Why don't you take a nap?

677
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,373
Gladly.

678
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,495
Make sure to ask me
if I'm still in when I wake up.

679
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,594
- [Car horn honking]
- [Lurasetti groans]

680
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,736
I've been processing here for five hours.

681
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:37,664
- You should have given me a nudge.
- There wasn't a reason to.

682
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,083
Are you still in?

683
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,249
I am until I'm not.

684
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,673
- You see Vogelmann yet?
- Nope.

685
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,147
I'm gonna get something
from this big orange thing.

686
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,396
You want egg salad on rye toast?

687
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,273
Two of them, and root beer.

688
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,479
Mmm-hmm.

689
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,466
Mmm.

690
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,476
Amen.

691
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,896
I've been listening to and smelling that
for the last 98 minutes.

692
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,906
Best part of a stakeout,

693
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,488
other than when it ends...

694
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:39,995
Is when you're eating.

695
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,873
A single red ant could've eaten it faster.

696
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,299
Nope.

697
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:03,844
[Loud sigh]

698
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,687
Take two.

699
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,519
I'm still enjoying the aftertaste.

700
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,779
Not all of us are.

701
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,744
Where did you park?

702
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,641
I've been telling you,
you're getting senile.

703
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,128
You didn't lock it?

01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,341
and we should allow the other party
room for tardiness.

883
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,135
Unless Vogelmann is 19 minutes late.

884
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,714
Possible, but not probable.

885
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,799
And I'm doing the walk-by myself.

886
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,511
- I usually...
- You're barely here as it is.

887
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,140
Any and every bigger risk
we come upon is mine to take.

888
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:00,196
[Spraying]

889
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,211
[Coughs]

890
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:29,813
I'll do you first.

891
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,766
Don't make no mess of it.

892
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,152
[Scoffs]
I used to graffiti back in the day.

893
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:36,806
And I remember what it looked like.

894
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,031
You were no better yourself,
you know that?

895
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:41,737
I was only doing tags.

896
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:43,785
You was the one trying to make art.

897
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:47,577
Nigga painted a pit bull
everybody thought was a turtle.

898
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,502
[Car door opens, closes]

899
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:45,681
[Sighs]

900
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,269
Nothing.

901
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,598
How about getting on a nearby roof
for a better vantage?

902
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,060
Not worth the exposure,

903
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,772
or the risk of us getting split up,
in case things get urgent.

904
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:03,236
- This is a bad location for...
- [Vehicle approaches]

905
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:22,505
Who the hell are those guys?

906
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:28,595
Must have been here
since before Vogelmann arrived.

907
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,686
[Sighs]

908
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,302
It's them.

909
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,262
Who?

910
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,629
The black dudes.

911
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:08,759
The ones who drove Vogelmann.

912
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:42,748
- Anchovies.
- Crud.

913
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:47,636
Any idea what's going on here?

914
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:52,262
Evidently, these guys expect to be exposed
to people or a camera at some point.

915
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:55,599
That's the only way those disguises
make any sense.

916
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,223
What kind of job?

917
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,277
Robbery?

918
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:02,442
Kidnapping?

919
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,980
- Murder?
- One or some of those. Yeah.

920
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,019
Ma'am?

921
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:39,097
- You need some assistance?
- [Sighs]

922
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,441
Sorry.

923
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:55,449
Can you hold that?

924
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,700
Please hold it. Ma'am?

925
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:14,767
Jeffrey?

926
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:21,514
Jeffrey, let me in.

927
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,487
- Open this.
- [Man] Kelly, please stop yelling.

928
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:31,134
- I was in the bathroom.
- Why did you put the chain on the door?

929
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,242
Why aren't you on your way to work?

930
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,265
You are not allowed to answer
a question with a question.

931
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,745
Don't shout at me, okay?

932
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:41,121
You just need to go back downstairs,
get on the bus and go to work.

933
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:44,252
- Open this right now.
- I can't.

934
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,942
What do you mean you can't?
Of course you can.

935
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,958
I want to, I really, really do,
but I can't.

936
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:51,590
Your maternity leave ended four weeks ago.

937
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,216
You've used all of your vacation

938
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:55,764
and every single sick day
staying here with Jackson.

939
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,134
He needed me.

940
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,269
I'm taking good care of him...

941
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:06,233
And I will continue to do so
until you're home from work.

942
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:07,779
[Scoffs]

943
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,858
I hate you.

944
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,198
- [Sighs]
- And I love you twice as much.

945
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,409
You need to go to work... today.

946
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:19,787
[Sobs]

947
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,662
My job is so stupid.

948
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:32,502
I go there and I sell chunks of my life
for a paycheck, so that...

949
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,261
Rich people I've never even met

950
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,590
can put money
in places I've never even seen.

951
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,061
How am I supposed to sit at a stupid desk

952
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:46,106
and talk about bank accounts
when my baby is here?

953
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:52,737
[Sobs]

954
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:09,918
Jackson needs diapers...
And clothes and gourmet baby food.

955
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:13,417
Eventually,
he's gonna need school supplies.

956
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,532
And if he's anything
like me and my brothers,

957
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:16,887
he'll need braces, too.

958
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:20,599
Now, all these things cost money,
and you make way more than I do.

959
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:23,438
I know.

960
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,267
Please get on the bus and go to work.

961
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:28,266
Okay.

962
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:31,731
I'm sorry I said I hate you.

963
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,274
That's all right.

964
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,190
I know what you really meant.

965
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:39,068
Can I see him, though?

966
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:41,737
Just through the opening.

967
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,041
I promise I'll go if you let me
see him just for a second.

968
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,209
[Sighs]

969
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,815
- I need to touch him.
- Kelly, please...

970
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,443
I... just for a second. I swear I'll go.

971
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,819
You've broken that swear before
and recently.

972
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,618
Do you swear on the life of our baby

973
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:24,162
that you will leave
after you've touched him?

974
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,586
No, no, no.

975
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:32,212
Say it out loud for it to count,
that's how swears work.

976
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,796
I swear on the life of our child
that I will go to work

977
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,343
after I've touched him.

978
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,312
You swore on his life.

979
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,291
I'll see you both
when I get home from work.

980
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:30,934
So cute.

981
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,943
[Breathing heavily]

982
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:06,517
Hey.

983
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,717
- Hey.
- Hi.

984
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:11,140
- Welcome back, Bonita.
- Thank you.

985
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:13,601
Good heavens and praise be to him.

986
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:21,360
Can that radiant vision of maternity
that just walked through our front doors

987
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,733
possibly be our beloved Mrs. summer?

988
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:27,535
Welcome back.

989
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,113
Welcome back and congratulations

990
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:33,496
on bringing such a lovely boy child
into this world.

991
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,331
Thank you, Mr. Edmington.

992
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,626
All of us in the bank have
great expectations for your boy.

993
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,584
Wondrous expectations on a global scale.

994
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,179
So do I.

995
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,342
Well, in that case,
our expectations are aligned.

996
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,802
- Yeah.
- Welcome back.

997
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,225
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

998
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:54,430
Mrs. summer,
your absence was a weight upon us,

999
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:57,934
your return is a divine blessing.

1000
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:01,903
It was just three months.

1001
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,906
Nevertheless, a doleful era.

1002
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,701
You really shouldn't look that good
after having a baby.

1003
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:10,366
Thanks.

1004
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:12,243
It's kind of annoying how good you look.

1005
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:15,076
- Thank you.
- I made cupcakes.

1006
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,786
- Oh, double chocolate.
- Of course.

1007
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:27,175
Oh, yeah,
your husband helped me with that part.

1008
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:31,053
A small token, a minuscule
manifestation of our affections.

1009
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:35,763
Mr. Edmington, everybody, really,
thank you for this, really.

1010
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:42,223
- It was really hard to leave the baby...
- [Truck braking]

1011
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,358
Any deliveries scheduled for today?

1012
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,946
Not that I'm aware of.

1013
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,198
Everyone, listen.

1014
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,621
Hands up, and keep them there
or this man dies.

1015
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,638
[Electronic voice] Keep your hands raised.

1016
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,257
Cooperate.

1017
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:17,017
If you make any sudden moves,
you will be executed.

1018
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:21,441
If the police show up,
everyone will be executed.

1019
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:26,777
Do not prioritize money
over having a heartbeat.

1020
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:29,149
Do you understand?

1021
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:30,828
Yes.

1022
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,286
- Mr. Edmington.
- Sir.

1023
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:41,037
Are there any employees in the back?

1024
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:44,920
If so, get them right now.

1025
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:47,834
You have 20 seconds.

1026
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,306
No, there is no one in the back.
Everyone is here in the front.

1027
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,803
Are you certain of this response?

1028
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,639
You appear to be uncertain.

1029
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:03,441
No, I'm quite certain everyone is here
in the front of the bank.

1030
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,145
We will accept this response.

1031
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:10,569
If you are mistaken, your testicles
will be removed...

1032
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,325
With this.

1033
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:17,914
Please,
let's not talk about anything rash.

1034
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,437
Everyone is here, as I said,
in the front...

1035
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:20,461
You.

1036
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,464
You seem honest and obedient.

1037
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:31,587
Handcuff every single person here,
except for the manager.

1038
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,006
Use these.

1039
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:40,179
Fasten their hands behind their backs.

1040
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:41,482
Tight.

1041
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:47,028
Do not say anything to anyone at any time
or you will be executed.

1042
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,830
Mr. Edmington.

1043
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:03,998
Sir.

1044
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,580
One of us will follow you to the vaults.

1045
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,293
Open them all.

1046
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:12,052
I will open every vault
that I am capable of opening for you.

1047
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,174
If our associate does not return

1048
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,848
with gold bullion
in three minutes or less,

1049
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:20,389
we will execute this woman.

1050
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:22,398
[Whimpers]

1051
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:27,901
[Clock ticking]

1052
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,462
[Low whisper] Send it.

1053
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:56,592
[Groans]

1054
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:11,274
Will you make sure my baby gets this?

1055
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,947
His name is Jackson.

1056
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,122
Must have gone this way.

1057
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:24,741
Think they know we're following?

1058
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:26,170
Thirty percent.

1059
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:28,749
Though I'm hoping they saw us
at Brownvine.

1060
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:31,707
You're hoping they saw us?

1061
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,155
Yeah, if they know they've been spotted,
maybe they'll abort

1062
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,589
whatever it is they got planned.

1063
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,631
Glad to hear your priorities changed.

1064
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,956
Well, if civilians are at risk,
they're the priority.

1065
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,392
Money or no money,
badge or no badge. You had doubts?

1066
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,689
Microscopic ones, if any, but...

1067
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,566
Good to hear things articulated.

1068
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:54,730
Trusted bank of north Bulwark.

1069
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:58,366
That isn't ambiguous.
Is that an embrasure?

1070
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:01,286
- What's an embrasure?
- See that opening?

1071
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:04,156
The horizontal slit
above the word "security."

1072
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,205
A guy's in there.

1073
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:13,877
So it's a robbery.

1074
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:15,459
Yup.

1075
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:48,450
We wait until they drive off?

1076
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:50,706
Yeah.

1077
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:54,289
It's a robbery until somebody
turns it into something worse.

1078
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:05,759
You looking to box them in?

1079
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,223
Pointlessly.

1080
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:10,646
Financial district on a weekday.

1081
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:12,432
Shouldn't engage them here.

1082
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:17,190
You think they'd go back
to the parking garage after this?

1083
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:18,942
Fifty percent.

1084
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:28,244
Fifty percent doesn't value anything
in a yes-or-no question.

1085
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:34,704
Hope this asshole doesn't get too curious.

1086
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,301
[Inaudible]

1087
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:44,134
"The bank will reopen
in 15 minutes. Come back then."

1088
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:47,430
Might have said 50, with a "y."

1089
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:49,309
Probably not.

1090
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:56,317
This guy's like a cigarette commercial.

1091
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:21,630
They're loading.

1092
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:23,086

- Christ.

1094

- [Smacks door]
- Christ.

1095
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:56,206
We could have stopped this.

1096
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:04,301
- Are you gonna say anything?
- Focus on that.

1097
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:09,098
We let those people get killed.

1098
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:13,637
You're not gonna say anything?

1099
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:19,942
You don't have anything to say
about our culpability?

1100
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,816
Those Italian emotions are saying plenty.

1101
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:25,740
- You go to hell, you heartless fuck.
- I never saw that opera.

1102
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,951
Look, by the time we knew
it wasn't a routine drug deal,

1103
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:31,278
- it was already too late.
- You could have called it in.

1104
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,123
When the Van left the parking garage.

1105
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,871
Put the Bulwark pd on alert.

1106
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:37,212
We didn't.

1107
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:39,579
The chance of that accomplishing anything

1108
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:43,542
in the 16-minute interim,
less than 50 percent or even 25.

1109
01:34:44,387 --> 01:34:47,129
You wanna call the Bulwark pd,
the state police, the feds,

1110
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:48,838
let them handle it, go ahead.

1111
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,800
But that Van, and the cutthroats inside,

1112
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,728
they'll be vapor
before any enforcement agency can respond.

1113
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:59,349
We're it.

1114
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:23,669
You said you weren't gonna kill anyone

1115
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,593
unless it was in self-defense.
You gave us your word.

1116
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:30,588
Get on the interstate.

1117
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:34,384
It was excessive what happened back there.

1118
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:36,222
[Cocks gun]

1119
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:38,771
Do you wish to expand upon your critique?

1120
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,641
Give us the urban point of view?

1121
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,397
He ain't got nothing more to say.

1122
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:45,187
Hush that flap, nigga.

1123
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:48,439
Keep your attention on the road.
We'll get through this.

1124
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:52,569
Muscles.

1125
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:53,997

1126
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:55,874
Yeah.

1127
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,616
Place your firearms
inside of the glove box.

1128
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,206
That wasn't a suggestion.

1129
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:11,883
A'ight.

1130
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:29,568
Cover that weaponry
with the sport section.

1131

Close the door.

1132
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,492
Close the door.

1133

It's closed.

1134
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,289
We didn't hear it click.

1135
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:48,124
We want to hear it click.

Nah, nothing.

1143
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:36,092
Any idea where they're gonna land?

1144
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:39,017
Somewhere rural,
where they're gonna exchange vehicles,

1145
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:40,103
but where that is...

1146
01:38:29,862 --> 01:38:31,318
Need gas pretty soon.

1147
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:32,737
Yeah, so do they.

01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,610

Just do what you're paid to do
and never mind them back there.

1166
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:10,098
Remember when your ma brung us
out here for your birthday?

1167
01:41:12,275 --> 01:41:15,563
You, me, at least ten other little'uns.

even though we didn't
really want him around.

1170
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:30,623
But there was your sister's friends
and a couple of neighbors, I think.

1171
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:40,132
You wanted an ice-cream cake
so your ma brung it in a cooler.

What was it again?

That's right. That's right.

1175
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:53,938
I remember now. Nigga was a t-Rex.

1176
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:03,614
And its fangs was made out of candy corns.

1177

on the tips that look like blood.

Yeah.

1188
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:36,348
But she probably knew my ma
wasn't taking care of me too good.

1189
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:41,571
She knew.

1190

Together.

01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:15,386
- Well, there's a...
- No.

1197
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:18,598
Only things behind us are
a green pickup and a gray car

1198

1199

Always am.

1201
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:42,746
First estimate is five people dead.

Looks like a large amount of gold bullion
was delivered two days ago.

1205

Not a coincidence.

I gotta know.

1210
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,823
In case we don't come back,
I gotta know what she would have said.

1211

We're coming back.

1212
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:34,048
One hundred percent?

1213
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:40,225
I'm at 80. Maybe even 85, you're 70.

1214
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:43,349
Experience?

1215
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:46,359
Yeah, plus I'm not Italian.

1216
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,242
That's her voice mail.

Hey, Denise, I...

1218
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:00,453
I got a favor to ask you.

1219
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:01,544
Pretty important.

1220
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:04,211
I'm stuck uptown right now...

1221
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:06,751
And I need some information
back at my place.

1222
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:11,552
So if you could swing by and get it,
I would really, really appreciate it.

1223
01:45:12,932 --> 01:45:15,765
It's in the right pocket of my tan blazer,

1224
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:19,845
the herringbone one that I wore
to your sister's the last time.

1225
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:26,567
And I know this is inconvenient,
but you would really be helping me out.

1226
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:29,107
Call me when you get it.

1227
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:32,739
That's it, I'll talk to you soon.

1228
01:45:33,786 --> 01:45:35,401
Love you, bye.

1229
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:38,866
Ain't the most romantic way to propose.

1230
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:40,458
It isn't.

1231
01:45:40,626 --> 01:45:42,787
Denise is smart, she's very clear-minded.

1232
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:45,106
She's not gonna change her answer
one way or the other

1233
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:46,336
because of how I asked her.

1234
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:48,664
- I'd give you about...
- Don't tell me a percentage.

1235
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:58,177
Watch this up here.

1236
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:02,056
I see it.

1237
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:06,311
Let's grab takeout
when we're done with this.

1238
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:11,771
I'm really in the mood
for some cellophane noodles.

1239
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:18,656
Okay.

1240
01:46:36,807 --> 01:46:37,842
Muscles.

1241
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:40,386
Yeah?

1242
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:42,722
Is anybody following after us?

1243
01:46:43,814 --> 01:46:45,850
The green pickup, the gray car?

1244
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:49,350
- No.
- Please check your mirrors.

1245
01:46:54,325 --> 01:46:55,735
Nothing but rust and air.

1246
01:46:56,076 --> 01:46:57,361
I'll keep an eye out.

1247
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:00,365
- [Turn signal clicking]
- Muscles...

1248
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:02,864
To whom are you signaling?

1249
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:05,495
Nobody, no one.

1250
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:07,868
I just did it out of habit.

1251
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:21,351
Possum.

1252
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:27,721

1253
01:47:41,413 --> 01:47:42,653
We here.

1254
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:46,369
"We are here" or "we're here."

1255
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:48,659
Not "we here."

1256
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:51,036
You understood me, didn't you?

1257
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:56,626
- Didn't you?
- Please face forward.

1258
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,295
Nigga is exacerbating.

1259
01:48:38,095 --> 01:48:39,676
The garage door is still intact?

1260
01:48:40,806 --> 01:48:41,806
Look like.

1261
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:50,854
Open the right bay.

1262
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:53,019
Can I take my gun
out the glove box in case?

1263
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:54,110
You may not.

Dead rat.

1271
01:50:56,233 --> 01:50:57,233
Give me the key.

1272
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:03,104
Give me the key.

1273
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,272
Shoot him and use the spare key.

1274
01:51:06,034 --> 01:51:08,366
The spare is on the ring
that I gave to slim.

1275
01:51:13,167 --> 01:51:14,247
Where is the key?

1276
01:51:15,169 --> 01:51:16,830
Did you check your mother's rectum?

1277
01:51:29,016 --> 01:51:30,016
[Groans]

1278
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:32,182
Where is the key?

1279
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:36,512
Ask your proctologist. [Chuckles]

[Running footsteps]

1281
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:47,158
Hold tight, nigga.

1282
01:51:51,496 --> 01:51:52,656
Get out of here.

1283
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:55,868
Just leave me, man. Get out of here.

1284
01:51:55,959 --> 01:51:57,620
- Shut that flap, nigga.
- [Groans]

1285

Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Henry, stop!

1286
01:52:05,135 --> 01:52:08,719
This whole thing was my fault. My idea.

1287
01:52:09,306 --> 01:52:10,306
Get.

1288
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:15,561
Henry.

1289
01:52:17,773 --> 01:52:18,933
You get to go...

1290
01:52:19,524 --> 01:52:20,855
Give something to my ma.

1291
01:52:21,318 --> 01:52:22,558
I take care of her good.

1292
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:24,111
Yeah.

1293
01:52:24,905 --> 01:52:27,612
Get her a nice television. One of those...

1294
01:52:40,379 --> 01:52:41,585
Do you see the key?

1295
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:43,544
He swallowed it.

1296
01:52:44,216 --> 01:52:45,877
And slim's still out there.

1297
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:56,387
Should we drive past them
and come at them from behind?

1298
01:52:56,478 --> 01:52:59,936
No. We need to box them in
right here, right now.

1299
01:53:03,151 --> 01:53:07,144
Conflict couldn't happen in
a better, less populated place than this.

1300

Looks like problems with the hired help.

1301
01:53:33,223 --> 01:53:36,715
- So Reed's still alive?
- That front door looks armored.

1302
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:38,721
Why are they making her do that?

1303
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:41,019
They wanna clean things up before they go?

1304
01:53:41,106 --> 01:53:43,893
- Seventy-five percent.
- What's the other 25?

1305
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:46,942
I'm not sure. Something weird.

1306
01:53:59,624 --> 01:54:01,080
This is excessive.

1307
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:34,989
- You got a leak.
- I'm aware.

1308
01:54:38,038 --> 01:54:39,153
Don't get shot.

1309
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:41,028
They don't have the right angle.

1310
01:54:45,629 --> 01:54:46,994
Unless they get on the ground.

1311
01:54:48,256 --> 01:54:50,588
Since I'm already here,
I'll get off the first shots.

1312
01:54:50,675 --> 01:54:52,040
You learn that in the army?

1313
01:54:52,344 --> 01:54:53,800
[Lurasetti] Geometry, actually.

1314
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:56,168
[Ridgeman] Did you see what happened
to that other helper?

1315
01:54:57,057 --> 01:54:59,137
- [Lurasetti] The skinny black guy?
- [Ridgeman] Him.

1316
01:54:59,559 --> 01:55:00,559
[Lurasetti] No.

1317
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:03,552
I think he disappeared
during the first barrage.

1318
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:06,684
[Ridgeman] That's a variable
we didn't need.

1319
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:13,312
Start the party.

[Lurasetti] Don't be an asshole.

1322
01:55:42,018 --> 01:55:44,009
They're rolling bunkers on airless tires.

Remove the stomach,

1324
01:55:49,526 --> 01:55:51,812
so that the key doesn't fall
into his entrails.

1325
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:53,359
I will.

1326
01:56:09,838 --> 01:56:11,169
Think they're cops?

1327
01:56:14,926 --> 01:56:18,134
Not unless they're crooked ones,
looking for the gold.

1328
01:56:19,848 --> 01:56:22,009

for an engagement with us.

I know which one it is.

Careful not to pop his liver.

That is the worst smell in the world,

1339

legible in that picture?

Completely. And she's younger
than she looks.

to the emergency room?

No, it hurts too much to move.

02:05:51,794 --> 02:05:54,706
There aren't any.
I really hope that this...

1408
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:57,299
Mistake...

1409
02:05:58,468 --> 02:05:59,878
Is not what I'm remembered for.

1410
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:02,630
I'll keep your name out of it.

1411
02:06:04,348 --> 02:06:05,588
- I hope you can.
- I will.

1412
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:11,890
Want me to get that?

1413
02:06:15,818 --> 02:06:16,853
Well, she called.

1414
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:19,853
I know.

1415
02:06:20,073 --> 02:06:21,358
Well, I'll type for you.

1416
02:06:22,408 --> 02:06:24,273
- Passcode is...
- I know what it is.

1417
02:06:27,330 --> 02:06:28,866
- Let me hold it.
- Here.

1420
02:06:47,767 --> 02:06:48,767
I'm sorry.

1421
02:06:49,644 --> 02:06:52,807
It wasn't what I wanted to hear.

1422

[Chuckles]

1423
02:06:58,569 --> 02:07:00,105
- Want me to break it?
- Uh-huh.

1424
02:07:11,666 --> 02:07:12,746
Damn!

1425
02:07:15,628 --> 02:07:16,628
Damn!

1426
02:07:17,338 --> 02:07:18,373
Good?

[Van door opens]

[Men coughing]

1429
02:08:53,434 --> 02:08:55,641
[Man] I'm surrendering. Taking your deal.

1430
02:08:55,895 --> 02:08:57,681
All right. Come on out with your hands up.

1431

[Gasps] I need med...

1432
02:09:19,001 --> 02:09:20,787
[Henry] Get rid of that gas can, nigga.

1433
02:09:26,008 --> 02:09:28,169
I ain't done all this to see you
burn up no money.

1434
02:09:28,761 --> 02:09:30,467
Gold isn't flammable.

1435
02:09:30,805 --> 02:09:32,011
Yeah, I don't want it melted.

1436
02:09:32,974 --> 02:09:34,180
And there's cash in there too.

1437
02:09:34,267 --> 02:09:35,302
[Coughing inside Van]

1438
02:09:40,106 --> 02:09:43,098
You wanna come over here
and take care of Vogelmann yourself?

1439
02:09:43,192 --> 02:09:45,057
No, nigga. No.

1440
02:09:45,528 --> 02:09:46,528
You the professional.

1441
02:09:47,238 --> 02:09:48,899
Look at all the good work you done here.

1442
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,985
Can execute naked women and everything.

1443
02:09:55,079 --> 02:09:56,079

[Gunshot]

1447
02:10:36,162 --> 02:10:37,762
[Henry] The next bullet ain't a warning.

1448
02:10:43,294 --> 02:10:45,535
That bulletproof vest
you got there's real nice.

1449
02:10:46,005 --> 02:10:47,245
Makes you look svelte.

1450
02:10:48,716 --> 02:10:50,297
Like when a female puts on a girdle.

1451
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:55,532
It's much more flattering
than that windbreaker

1452
02:10:55,556 --> 02:10:58,047
you wore on the news
when you stomped that Mexican.

1453
02:10:59,435 --> 02:11:00,550
Where did you spot me?

1454
02:11:01,562 --> 02:11:02,893
When you drove by the bank.

1455
02:11:03,898 --> 02:11:06,765
And twice when you was following
on the parkway.

1456
02:11:09,236 --> 02:11:10,271
What do you want?

1457
02:11:10,905 --> 02:11:11,905
Stay right there.

1458
02:11:12,990 --> 02:11:16,699
So I can thank you face-to-face
for wiping out all these cruel-ass thugs.

1459
02:11:18,788 --> 02:11:20,708
That's what most cops do
when they get suspended.

1463
02:11:25,211 --> 02:11:26,326
Why you taking that off?

1464
02:11:27,088 --> 02:11:29,044
I need the strap to stop the bleeding.

1465
02:11:29,715 --> 02:11:31,296
- [Grunts]
- A'ight.

1466
02:11:34,762 --> 02:11:36,082
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

1467
02:11:37,556 --> 02:11:38,796
You tell me some bullshit

1468
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:40,885
and I send that video I made

1469
02:11:40,976 --> 02:11:42,682
of you killing that white girl
to the news.

1470
02:11:48,401 --> 02:11:50,107
I got a real good angle from up there.

1471
02:11:50,778 --> 02:11:52,418
Even got you when you took off your mask.

1472
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:56,196
- So ask.
- What do the Bulwark pd know...

1473
02:12:12,633 --> 02:12:14,464
- Nigga.
- Likewise.

1474
02:12:19,849 --> 02:12:21,134
Let's talk through this.

1475
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:23,845
Make some words.

1476
02:12:26,355 --> 02:12:29,017
We should clean up this mess together
and split the gold.

1477
02:12:31,861 --> 02:12:33,271
We can fight each other some more,

1478
02:12:34,655 --> 02:12:38,443
do this until we're crippled or dead,
or we can both be rich.

1479
02:12:39,326 --> 02:12:40,987
I don't see how this is a dilemma.

1480
02:12:42,037 --> 02:12:43,037
Trusting a cop...

1481
02:12:43,998 --> 02:12:46,489
One that's crooked as fuck,
is the dilemma.

1482
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:49,450
Only thing absolutely certain about you

1483
02:12:49,545 --> 02:12:52,412
is that you don't give a shit
about any oath you swear to.

1484
02:13:01,474 --> 02:13:04,466
My daughter got assaulted
for the fifth time two days ago.

and can't even walk

1494
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:47,759
Let's unload the guns together and slowly
so neither one of us is tempted.

back with us neither

We bury them.

We didn't know they was
gonna grab no woman.

1502
02:14:55,379 --> 02:14:57,870
Nobody was supposed to get shot
unless they pulled a gun on us.

1503
02:14:58,215 --> 02:14:59,250
That was the deal.

1504
02:14:59,675 --> 02:15:01,586
Did you believe that
or did you just want to?

Our word's good. It'll be 60/40.

We go in the Van at the same time.

However you want. It's all cotton candy.

1511
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:28,734
It's not gonna smell great in there.

1512
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:39,620
We'll put the gold in here.

1513
02:15:39,715 --> 02:15:41,626
Why? This wreck is dead as an insect.

1514
02:15:41,717 --> 02:15:43,753
Right, but I got to sit in it to steer.

1515

1516

with everything in your trunk.

you're making me paranoid and suspicious.

who don't know nothing?

I believe what you meant to say was,
"who don't know anything."

You understood me, didn't you?

1563

Yeah, but you're a lot smarter
than you sound,

1564

a whole lot smarter from what I've seen.

1565

It's good to be underestimated.

this car with a submarine?

Yup.

- Just a precautionary measure.

That video is my insurance policy.

1572

Wrong. You can identify me
if they toss you in jail.

1573

If you get brought to trial,
I can do the same to you.

We keep each other quiet.
That's fair. That's balanced.

1575

But that video opens me up
to extortion from you,

or anyone you send it to, or for anyone
that hacks into your hardware.
