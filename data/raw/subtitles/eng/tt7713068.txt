Respect your elders.

401

I mean, your elderly.
[laughing]

402

Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

407

Yo, Simpson.

414
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,880
Any clean clothes
in lost and found?

415
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,986
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

416
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,888
The Sionis family name
is on

417
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,555
half the museums and
schools in Gotham.

418
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,992
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

419
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,728
[Harley] <i>Montoya's day is
going almost as badly as mine.</i>

420

<i>Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?</i>

421
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,432
<i>That's him.</i>

422
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,467
He had four people killed
alone last night.

423
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,270
If Roman Sionis is
such a mastermind,

424
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,538
how'd he get fired
from his own fucking company?

425
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,807
The Janus Corporation is

426
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,574
his father's company,
thank you.

427
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,878
And by the way,
they cut him off.

428
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:07,546
Where does the DA's office
stand on all this?

429
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,915
[Harley] <i>To make
matters worse,</i>

430
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,749
<i>the assistant DA?
That's her ex.</i>

431
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,253
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...

432
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,255
There's a shipment
coming in.

433
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,488
[Erickson] Drugs?

434
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,124
- A diamond.
- [Munroe] A diamond.

435
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,826
Wow, Montoya.
Should we call the Feds for backup?

436
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,162
[Montoya] Listen,
I had a source at the club.

437
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,830
His driver.

438
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,398
He said that Roman couldn't
stop talking about this thing.

439
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,632
And he said that
he overheard

440
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,733
something about
laser-encoding.

441
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,169
Now, I did some research.

442
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,905
I think
it's the Bertinelli diamond.

443
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,707
You remember the Bertinelli
massacre, right?

444
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,209
[Harley]
<i>Quick history lesson.</i>

445
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,044
<i>Fifteen years ago,
one of the wealthiest</i>

446
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,847
<i>Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</i>

447
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,549
<i>It was a power grab,
but the real target</i>

448
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,684
<i>was the Bertinellis'
super-secret</i>

449
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,054
<i>offshore bank accounts,</i>

450
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,755
<i>the details of which
were said to be encoded</i>

451
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:53,460
<i>in the atomic structure
of a 30-carat diamond.</i>

452
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,161
<i>The rock was lost.</i>

453
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:58,564
<i>And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

454
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,566
Which is exactly
why Roman Sionis

455
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,203
is trying to
get his hands on it.

456
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,305
That's what makes him
so dangerous.

457
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,107
He's already
building an army.

458
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,208
If he gets the diamond,

459
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,843
he'll have all the money
and connections

460
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,045
to bribe every single
judge and cop

461
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,180
he needs to get a
monopoly on the city.

462
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,216
You said you had
someone on the inside?

463

- Yes. He's... [stammering]

So basically,
you have nothing.

You are trying to go after

467
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,228
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

468
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,529
and all you've got is
rumors and a hunch?

469
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,165
- [vibrating continues]
- Well, you know,

470
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,533

a case against him, too.

Isn't that right,
Miss Yee?

472

is willing to throw himself

it's fine with me.

00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,222
Whoops. Ah...

1216
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:14,294
This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.

1217
00:58:16,963 --> 00:58:18,797
Lotus flower!

1218
00:58:18,865 --> 00:58:21,301
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

1219
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,436
He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.

1220
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:25,505
He knows everything
and everyone.

1221
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:27,273
Nothing happens around here,
let me tell you,

1222
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,908
without Doc
knowing about it.

1223
00:58:28,975 --> 00:58:32,011
And he happens to be
the only person

1224
00:58:32,078 --> 00:58:33,913
who actually cares
about me.

1225
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,648
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

1226

She's been ordering #32

1227

with extra chili
for many years.

1228
00:58:39,485 --> 00:58:40,553
Lesson number two,

1229
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,488
you always want
extra chili with #32.

1230
00:58:42,555 --> 00:58:44,424
[whispers] So you don't
have to taste his cooking.

1231
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:47,427
Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.

1232
00:58:47,493 --> 00:58:49,796
Everyone's looking for you.
And you.

1233

1234
00:58:51,831 --> 00:58:55,268
I'm telling you,
if you want boys to respect you,

1235
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:57,937
you have to show them
that you're serious.

1236
00:58:58,004 --> 00:59:01,474
Blow something up.
Shoot someone.

1237
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,943
Nothing gets a guy's
attention like violence.

1238
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,112
Shut that door.
Lock it.

1239
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:08,548
Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?

1240
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:20,860
This place...

1241
00:59:20,927 --> 00:59:22,895
Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

1242
00:59:22,962 --> 00:59:24,897
...is so fucking dope.

Oh, shit.
Is that a hyena in a bathtub?

1245
00:59:29,702 --> 00:59:32,972
I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.

1246
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:35,775
He's my little dumpling,
aren't you?

1247
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:37,977
Aren't you,
my little baby?

1248
00:59:38,044 --> 00:59:40,046
Aren't you, Brucey?
Yes.

1249
00:59:40,113 --> 00:59:42,014
I love you.

1250
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:46,953
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

Who's this?

1254
00:59:59,565 --> 01:00:01,534
It's a beaver.

1255
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:02,602
Hmm.

1256
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:09,375

You don't know
who that is?

1261
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:28,161
The Joker.

1262
01:00:28,227 --> 01:00:30,997
The Clown Prince of Crime?

1263
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:32,665
My former partner
in madness?

1264
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:35,201
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

1265
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:37,236
You've never heard of him?

1266
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:39,539
Well, sounds like a dick.

1267
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:43,676

[scoffs] I'm a rat?

1567
01:18:00,513 --> 01:18:04,083
I knew you couldn't be trusted.
Roman's little bird.

1568
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:06,552
You little fucking bird.

1569
01:18:06,619 --> 01:18:09,288
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1570
01:18:11,123 --> 01:18:14,260
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1571
01:18:15,829 --> 01:18:18,899
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1572
01:18:18,966 --> 01:18:20,199
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1573
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:21,567
Prove it to me.

1574
01:18:22,836 --> 01:18:25,137
Rip open
her little tummy.

1575
01:18:25,204 --> 01:18:26,706
Yeah,
that's not gonna happen.

1576
01:18:26,772 --> 01:18:29,108
Now! Rip it open!

1577
01:18:31,143 --> 01:18:32,345
[Zsasz groaning]

1583

Don't fucking move.

1584

Who the fuck are you?

1585
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,818
Go get the kid.

1586
01:19:11,885 --> 01:19:13,386
- All right.
- [gun cocks]

1587
01:19:13,452 --> 01:19:15,221
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [Cassandra] Back the fuck up!

1588
01:19:15,288 --> 01:19:17,891
- Get away from me. All of you.
- [Lance] Put that shit down.

1589
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:19,993
Shoot them, kid.

1590
01:19:20,059 --> 01:19:23,931
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1591
01:19:23,997 --> 01:19:27,066
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
- Don't move!

1592
01:19:27,133 --> 01:19:28,802
Okay.

1593
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:31,170
I don't know what
the fuck is going on.

1594
01:19:31,237 --> 01:19:32,772
But I know
that this shit stick...

1595
01:19:32,839 --> 01:19:34,340
[Cassandra grunts]

1596
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:36,409
...just tried to gut me.

1597
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,411
And you.

1598
01:19:40,513 --> 01:19:42,315
Thought you were different.

1599
01:19:45,084 --> 01:19:46,485
I'm sorry, kid.

1600
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:51,591
I'm just a terrible person,
I guess.

1601
01:19:58,564 --> 01:19:59,565
Ooh!

1602
01:20:00,299 --> 01:20:01,634
Ooh, I'm back.

1603
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:03,603
Okay, I feel like
I've just walked in on

1604
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:05,171
something I don't
give two shits about.

1605
01:20:05,237 --> 01:20:06,405
This guy's dead,
so I'm just

1606
01:20:06,472 --> 01:20:07,908
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1607
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:10,576
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1608
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:12,778
Excuse me?
I work for Sionis?

1609
01:20:14,347 --> 01:20:17,084
I'm not letting you
sell the kid to him.

1610
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:18,517
I wasn't going
to sell the kid.

1611
01:20:18,584 --> 01:20:20,219
I was going
to trade the kid.

1612
01:20:20,286 --> 01:20:22,089
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin.
Huh?

1613
01:20:22,154 --> 01:20:23,322
I'm not proud
of what I did,

1614
01:20:23,389 --> 01:20:25,157
but I had
half the city after me.

1615
01:20:25,224 --> 01:20:27,126
Even the fucking
Crossbow Killer.

1616
01:20:27,193 --> 01:20:28,929
I'm not
the Crossbow Killer!

1617
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,196
Whoa.

1618
01:20:31,932 --> 01:20:33,033
They call me...

1619
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,667
Helena Bertinelli.

1620
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:35,601
For fuck's sake.

1621
01:20:35,668 --> 01:20:37,737
As in
the Bertinelli massacre?

1622
01:20:37,804 --> 01:20:41,808
Sheesh kebab.
That is childhood trauma, right there.

1623
01:20:47,513 --> 01:20:49,582

01:20:53,352 --> 01:20:55,022
I killed his firing squad.

[both groan]

1627
01:20:59,993 --> 01:21:02,595
<i>I killed Victor Zsasz.</i>

[groans]

1629
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,803
And now I'm done.

1630
01:21:11,637 --> 01:21:12,738
Bravo.

1631
01:21:17,777 --> 01:21:19,545
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1632
01:21:19,612 --> 01:21:21,948
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1633
01:21:22,015 --> 01:21:23,449
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

1634
01:21:23,516 --> 01:21:25,852
sweetheart,
but you are not done.

1635
01:21:25,919 --> 01:21:26,987
Who do you think funded

1636
01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:28,621
Galante's little
power grab, huh?

1637
01:21:28,688 --> 01:21:30,456
Galante was
working with Sionis.

1638
01:21:30,523 --> 01:21:32,826
Roman killed your whole
family looking for that rock.

1639
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:35,761
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1640
01:21:35,829 --> 01:21:38,464
That diamond is our only
chance of stopping him.

1641
01:21:38,531 --> 01:21:39,699
[Cassandra] You guys.

1642
01:21:39,765 --> 01:21:42,334
Hey, I think
you should see this.

1643
01:21:44,838 --> 01:21:45,872
Oh.

1644
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:47,606
It's Sionis.

1645
01:21:59,953 --> 01:22:02,155
We're fucked.

1646
01:22:02,221 --> 01:22:04,290
He bought himself an army.

1647
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:13,967
They're all here for me.

1648
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:17,670
Aren't they?

1649
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:26,079
- No.
- They're not?

1650
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:28,347
No, they're not.

1651
01:22:28,414 --> 01:22:29,950
Do you know
what that means?

1652
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,550
That means he's not just
after the kid anymore.

1653
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:33,053
He's after all of us.

1654
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,956
He's sure as hell after me.
I just robbed him.

1655
01:22:36,022 --> 01:22:39,258
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1656
01:22:39,325 --> 01:22:40,693
And you're dumb enough

1657
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,795
to be building
a case against him.

1658
01:22:42,863 --> 01:22:45,598
So, unless we all wanna
die very unpleasant deaths

1659
01:22:45,664 --> 01:22:47,366
and let Roman
go finger-fishing

1660
01:22:47,433 --> 01:22:49,035
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1661
01:22:50,536 --> 01:22:51,972
we're gonna have
to work together.

1662
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,607
With you?

1663
01:22:54,673 --> 01:22:55,909
Yeah.

1664
01:22:55,976 --> 01:22:57,476
- [crying quietly]
- We're gonna work together,

1665
01:22:57,543 --> 01:22:59,012
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

1666

[Montoya scoffs]

1667
01:23:03,216 --> 01:23:04,517
Okay.

01:23:05,451 --> 01:23:07,888
Yeah. Okay.

1669
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:11,925
Sure.

1670
01:23:11,992 --> 01:23:13,359
Yes!

1671
01:23:13,425 --> 01:23:15,728
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1672
01:23:15,795 --> 01:23:16,796
Mmm-hmm.

1673
01:23:20,533 --> 01:23:23,335
Will this do?

1674
01:23:24,805 --> 01:23:25,771
No.

- Not at all.

I can't believe

- [Huntress] We're fucked.

- Uh, there's this.

1681

I've protected you.

I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

1685

Well, now it's time
to say thank you.

with Roman Sionis.

brings me the girl alive.

Hey, nice.
What the hell is up

1699
01:24:54,727 --> 01:24:55,929
with this bow
and arrow shtick?

1700
01:24:55,996 --> 01:24:57,463
It's not a fucking
bow and arrow.

1701
01:24:57,529 --> 01:24:58,999
It's a crossbow.
I'm not 12.
