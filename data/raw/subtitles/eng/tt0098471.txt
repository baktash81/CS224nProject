I ROBBED THAT GOD DAMN BANK

354
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,853
BECAUSE I NEEDED THE MONEY.
SO, GO AHEAD, KILL ME,

355
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:03,623
BUT I'M NOT GETTING OUT
OF THIS CAR WITHOUT MY MONEY!

356
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,334
GET OUT OF HERE.

357
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,210
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

358
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:27,246
YOU LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

359
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,834
SLIDE OVER. I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU.

360
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:52,271
HE'S NOT FAR FROM HERE.
COME ON. MOVE OVER. HURRY.

361
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,263
UHH!

362
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,810
I'LL GO GET SOME HELP.

363
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,413
CANVAS. COVER THE CAR.

364
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:35,748
OK, OK.

365
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:55,167
UNH! HE'S A FRIEND
OF MY DAD'S.

366
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,770
VERY NICE GUY.
HE'LL FIX YOU UP.

367
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:00,507
LET'S HOPE
HE'S HOME.

368
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,475
DR. HORVATH!

369
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:06,646
DR. HORVATH!

370
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:07,947
DR. HORVATH!

371
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,653
HERE WE GO.

372
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,422
[GRUNTING]

373
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,592
THERE. OK. NOW, YOU LIE HERE
AND I'LL GO GET HIM.

374
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,161
NO. IS THIS A DOCTOR?
HE'LL CALL THE COPS.

375
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,696
THEY HAVE TO REPORT
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

376
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,364
NO, HE WON'T.
HE'S A FRIEND OF MY DAD'S.

377
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,800
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS FRIENDS IF HE'S A DOCTOR.

378
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:28,835
THEY HAVE TO REPORT IT.

379
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,203
HE'S NOT A DOCTOR.
HE'S A VETERINARIAN,

380
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,640
AND NOT THE KIND
TO CALL THE COPS, EITHER.

381
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,475
DR. HORVATH!

382
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,610

DR. HORVATH!

383
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,345
DR. HORVATH!

384
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:42,715
WHO IS IT?

385
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:45,484
HI, DR. HORVATH.

00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,286
REMEMBER ME?
NED PERRY.

387
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,389
GEORGE, MY BOY.
HOW NICE OF YOU TO VISIT ME.

388
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,891
NO, I'M NOT GEORGE.
I'M NED.

389
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:54,293
GEORGE IS MY FATHER.
I NEED YOUR HELP, SIR.

390
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,294
WHAT?

391
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,295
A FRIEND OF MINE
HAS BEEN HURT.

392
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,296
I BROUGHT HIM IN
TO SEE YOU.

393
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,297
HE'S IN
THE EXAMINING ROOM.

394
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,201
HURT? BUT I HAVEN'T
PRACTICED IN YEARS, GEORGE.

395
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,170
YES, I KNOW, BUT HE'S
REALLY IN BAD SHAPE, SIR,

396
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,505
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO, SO...

397
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,575
PLEASE, DR. HORVATH.
LOOK HIM OVER. IT'S URGENT.

398
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,844
LOOK HIM OVER? BUT I DON'T
KNOW HOW ANYMORE, GEORGE.

399
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,180
WHAT BREED IS HE?

400
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:15,848
NO, HE'S NOT A DOG,
DR. HORVATH.

401
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,217
HE'S--
JUST COME AND SEE.

402
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,920
GOD, HE'S GONNA SHIT
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

403
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,655
NO, HE WON'T.
HE'S HOUSEBROKEN.

404
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,392
WHAT IS THIS?

405
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,827
A FRIEND. HE'S BEEN
WOUNDED IN THE THIGH

406
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,495
AND HE'S LOST
A LOT OF BLOOD.

407
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,230
BUT I'M NOT
A DOCTOR, GEORGE.

408
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,364
NO, I KNOW, I KNOW.
BUT CAN YOU JUST

409
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,233
TAKE OUT A BULLET
AND BANDAGE THE WOUND?

410
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,535
BULLET? WHY?
WHO SHOT HIM?

411
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,939
POOR LITTLE DOGGIE.

412
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,207
WAS HE HUNTING?

413
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,510
TOOK HIM
FOR A RABBIT, HUH?

414
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,913
STUPID HUNTERS.

415
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:48,781
ARE YOU OK,
DR. HORVATH?

416
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:51,918
I'M OK, GEORGE. I'M OK.

417
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,525
HOT. VERY HOT.

418
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,627
WHAT IS THIS CRAP?!

419
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,394
EASY, BOY. EASY.

420
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,230
LISTEN, MAYBE I SHOULD
TAKE HIM SOMEPLACE ELSE.

421
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,064
EASY, BOY.

422
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,899
DR. HORVATH, WE'RE NOT
GONNA BOTHER YOU

423
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,534
ANY LONGER. OK?

424
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,402
GEORGE, GO AND GET
THE ALCOHOL.

425
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:11,938
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU STAY THERE.

426
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,539
YOU STAY RIGHT HERE.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

427
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,641
EEE-HEE-HEE!

00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:15,875
AAH!

429
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,277
YOU'LL BE FINE.
YOU JUST LIE THERE.

430
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,279
DR. HORVATH
WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

431
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,649
YOU'LL BE BETTER
IN NO TIME. YOU'LL SEE.

432
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,785
THINK YOU CAN DO IT,
DR. HORVATH?

433
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,454
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN,
GEORGE.

434
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:32,892
OOH. NASTY WOUND.
VERY NASTY.

00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,627
POOR LITTLE POOCHIE.

436
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:36,929
I HAVE NO ANESTHETIC.

437
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:40,299
HERE. BITE ON THIS.

438
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,935
UHH! GET ME
OUT OF HERE!

439
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,170
IT HURTS!

440
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,274
AAH!

441
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,478
BE BETTER TO PUT HIM
TO SLEEP.

442
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:57,283
Tener: NED PERRY.
MALE CAUCASIAN.

443

444
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,488
HE'S 32 YEARS OLD.
NO RECORD.

445
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,657
HE WORKED 11 YEARS
IN THE SAME PLACE.

446
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:07,159
NORTHWEST LUMBER.
HE WAS A SALES MANAGER.

447
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:10,262
2 YEARS AGO, HIS WIFE
DIED. HE CRACKED.

448
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,198
COULDN'T DO HIS JOB,
APPARENTLY.

449
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,200
THEY LAID HIM OFF.

450
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,202
LATELY, HE DOES
TELEPHONE SALES.

451
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,303

452
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,872
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST
GET A BETTER JOB?

453
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:22,842
A BREAKDOWN.
WOULD YOU HIRE HIM?

454
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,377
THE TRUE THING IS I WOULDN'T
HIRE HIM TO ROB A BANK.

455
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:31,718
THE DAUGHTER'S 6.
SHE'S NOT NORMAL.

SHE'S IN THE SPECIAL SCHOOL.

459
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,532
THIS GUY DOESN'T FIT LUCAS'S
M.O. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

460
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:49,168
NOTHING MAKES SENSE
WITH LUCAS IN THIS SCREW-UP.

461
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,571
JUST IN CASE, SEND A CAR
TO THE KID'S SCHOOL.
