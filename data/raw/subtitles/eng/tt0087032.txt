00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:44,082
Do you understand?

3
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,250
We, the Falafel family,

4
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:49,258
from the very beginning until now,

5
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:53,628
have ruled the desert
with one thing - ''speed''.

6
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:56,402
Our ants run faster than others.

7
00:00:56,602 --> 00:00:58,570
We spend money faster than others.

8
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:01,674
Now, from the ground...

9
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:05,203
suddenly...

10
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:10,076
Our planes fly faster than others.

11
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,616
We have the fastest boats
and the fastest cars

12
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:16,313
except for one.

13
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,083
It is you!

14
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:21,456
Last year I sent you
to race the Cannonball Run

15
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:25,429
to let people know about
the Falafel family.

16
00:01:25,598 --> 00:01:27,657
The fastest family in the world.

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,668
We could have won.

18
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:35,563
But you guit during the race.

19
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:38,238
A thousand thanks.

20
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:40,641
Please listen to me.
We drove too fast,

21
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:42,408
and that caused a flat tire.

22
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:44,881
- Father.
- Stop explaining!

23
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:48,850
You have already disgraced
the Falafel family.

24
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:53,282
A thousand thanks.

25
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:01,231
Do you have a blonde slave

26
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,927
for any special reason?

27
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:06,462
Don't underestimate him.

28
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:09,040
Prior to becoming a slave,
he was a hotshot on TV.

29
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,766
That's right.

30
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,339
Two thousand thanks.

31
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:19,814
If it weren't for my ulcer,
I would have won the last time.

32
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,284
The worst part is...

33
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:25,551
I order you to return to America

34
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:29,216
to win the Cannonball Run.

35
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:31,922
The problem is none of us
has a driver's license.

36
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't ask you.

37
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:36,835
But Father,

38
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,563
there's no Cannonball Run this year.

39
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,003
No race? Then organize one.

40
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:45,068
I know what to do.

41
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:08,226
Someone is speeding.

42
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:10,197
Someone really has guts
but no regard for life.

43
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,702
I'm not sure about that.
The ticket's going to be expensive.

44
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,704
- Here they come.
- We have to chase them.

45
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,233
''Speed Limit: 55 m.p.h.''

46
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:48,840
''Speed Limit: 155 m.p.h.''

47
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,604
This car is really fast.

48
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:24,038
A white car is coming at you
in about 3 seconds.

49
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:25,605
You're exaggerating.

50
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:28,338
Right, there are two pretty girls
in the car.

51
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:46,296
This is a straight road.
How could we miss them?

52
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:49,200
Calm down. Look for dust and dirt.

53
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,960
It must be them.

54
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,276
We really have lost them.

55
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:03,678
The two girls are driving
a white Lamborghini.

56
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,681
How could we have missed them?

57
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,285
Really, we didn't see them.

58
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,649
I saw it.
This time, we won't lose them.

59
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,588
Don't get cocky.

60
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:22,725
We'll split up.
They won't get away.

61
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:26,198
Let's do it.

62
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,021
I'm heading south-east,
chasing a white Lamborghini.

63
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,094
Be on the lookout.

64
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:17,489
Thank you.

65
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,805
Did I have too much drink or what?

66
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,538
The white Lamborghini is gone.

67
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:42,044
But here comes a red one.

68
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:46,412
That isn't right.
There are two more girls speeding.

69
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:11,968
It's boring racing with them.

70
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,472
The Cannonball Run is much better.

71
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:17,173
Right. There's a Cannonball Run
this year.

72
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,816
Why don't we compete race?

73
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:20,349
It must be exciting.

74
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,283
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go.

75
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,281
Ladies and gentlemen,

76
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,549
welcome to the Human Cannonball show.

77
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:02,354
Get ready to be thrilled
by a brave performer.

78
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,997
This stunt pushes human ability
to its limit.

79
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:09,432
This is a record-breaking event

80
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,263
that defies death.

81
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:14,998
It's a gamble of life.

82
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:25,074
J.J., is this going to work?

83
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,384
It'll work.

84
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:31,481
- We're going to be rich.
- Rich...?

85
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:33,420
We're going to split
all the money in half.

86
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,720
We're partners.

87
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,388
- You perform and I get the money.
- That's fair.

88
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:42,230
- You won't go wrong with me.
- Because we're partners.

89
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:44,563
My part is more dangerous.

90
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:46,364
Don't be a chicken.

91
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,104
The pilot is very experienced.

92
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:52,437
- He can do it with his eyes closed.
- Closed eyes?

93
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,706
Don't be afraid.
He'll drop you gently.

94
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:58,041
- Then you'll go through that.
- Go through what?

95
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,515
- Go through a net. It's very safe.
- Really?

96
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:03,145
There's hay behind it.

97
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:06,315
If you don't catch the net,
you'll wind up as a scarecrow.

98
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:08,450
What if it doesn't work?

99
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:10,788
- It's not dangerous?
- I'm very calm.

100
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:13,523
- Have some confidence.
- Right.

101
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:15,791
If you have confidence,
I won't be worried.

102
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,698
Good luck.

103
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:20,304
- J.J., I'm still scared.
- Scared?

104
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:24,169
If you are scared,
then change into Captain Chaos.

105
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:25,536
Everything will be fine.

106
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:29,444
Captain Chaos only appears
when human life is in grave danger.

107
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:34,043
Right, ask him to come.

108
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:41,256
Hello, this is Jack Smith.

109
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:43,953
We brought our camera

110
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:45,859
to report

111
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,626
to our viewers

112
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,598
who will witness a stunt

113
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:53,203
called the Human Cannonball.

114
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,604
A human bomb will be dropped
at 140 m.p.h.

115
00:09:56,842 --> 00:09:59,606
If he is lucky,

116
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:02,305
he will become a national hero.

117
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,814
His face will not only be seen
on magazine covers,

118
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:06,780
but millions of adoring women

119
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,217
will be at his feet.

120
00:10:08,387 --> 00:10:13,051
He will be surrounded by women.

121
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:20,963
Clumsy oaf.

122
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:26,162
J.J., long time no see.

123
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:27,770
You look great.

124
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,208
I think I'd better take your place.

125
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:32,174
l'll do it. We're good partners.

126
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:33,175
It's better if i take your place.

127
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:34,437
- Really?
- Right.

128
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:35,773
Then go ahead.

129
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:37,148
Thank you.

130
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:38,850
- Be cool.
- I will.

131
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:41,180
He's in grave danger.

132
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,955
Drinking beer is better
than doing anything else.

133
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,324
Drinking beer...

134
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:59,461
lced cold beer...with chicken wings...

135
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,940
Let me take a sip to wake myself up.

136
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,672
What's the matter?

137
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:06,902
I want to go down.

138
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:09,672
That's easy. Watch me.

139
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:25,252
Don't blink. The Human Cannonball
is ready to be dropped.

140
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,628
Everything is ready.

141
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:02,293
The smart has the ideas.
The dumb one does the work.

142
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:03,692
An ambulance is here

143
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:05,804
to see if he's all right.

144
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:09,174
The pilot is great.
Are you all right?

145
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:12,401
It's really exciting. It's great.
The event was wonderful.

146
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:14,305
- You really accomplished something.
- Pull me out first.

147
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:16,607
- It's fabulous. We'll be rich.
- Hurry up!

148
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,478
You'll be a star
and appear on magazine covers.

149
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:20,881
You can do whatever you want, J.J.

150
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:24,747
J.J...
you seem to be shorter?

151
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,481
J.J., are you all right?

152
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:28,553
- We'll make tons of money now.
- Is that right?

153
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,287
If we perform this ten times a day
for about a year,

154
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:32,828
we'll be billionaires.

155
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,562
What?

156
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,828
The prize for the Cannonball Run
is a million dollars.

157
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,733
It's just a small amount.
It's nothing.

158
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:41,303
A lottery prize is more than this.

159
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,468
Did i say something wrong?

160
00:12:45,644 --> 00:12:47,612
You want me to perform this
ten times a day?

161
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:49,478
How about nine times?

162
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:52,879
I just want you to be rich.

163
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:05,359
I want to discuss something
at this meeting today.

164
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:10,864
Our family has had money
and power for a long time.

165
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:14,699
I control everything in America,

166
00:13:14,873 --> 00:13:18,240
prostitution, gambling,

167
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,370
drugs, racketeering,
and prostitution.

168
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:27,076
Boss, you said prostitution twice.

169
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:33,147
I like it.
Our business has gone down.

170
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:37,251
Guys, who worked for us before,
work for other families.

171
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:41,628
They don't even consider us.
Why is this?

172
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:43,701
It is because we're nice guys?

173
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:46,163
Is the interest too high?

174
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:47,999
Too many people emigrate?

175
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:55,713
None of the above.

176
00:13:56,748 --> 00:14:01,708
No...you're all stupid.

177
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:03,755
I didn't know we'd be playing
a guessing game.

178
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:05,480
Give us a hint.

179
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:10,727
Last year, i passed my business
over to my son, Don Don.

180
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:14,457
I asked you all to assist him

181
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:18,694
to increase business.

182
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:20,965
And what are the results?

183
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:25,742
He has only brought our family
disgrace and shame.

184
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:30,208
What happened?

185
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,512
This cat is dead.

186
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,850
Give me a new cat.

187
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:50,391
Even cats can't survive.
Thank you.

188
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:56,296
This hair is soft. It's interesting.

189
00:14:57,976 --> 00:14:59,341
It's a boy.

190
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:08,485
Go and bring Don Don back.

191
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:11,384
Don Don.

192
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:14,025
Your father wants us
to learn about your affairs.

193
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:17,086
What are your assets?

194
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:22,065
I'm...i'm good-natured,
and i dress well, and...

195
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:26,102
No. What about your liabilities?

196
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:31,002
Well, there is one small liability.

197
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,369
What...?

198
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:35,713
I could use a tummy tuck.

199
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:37,248
- A tummy tuck?
- Yes, i have to pee.

200
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:38,609
You have to pee?

201
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:43,686
- I'm going to kill you...
- Calm down.

202
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:48,081
Don Don,
do you have any outstanding debts?

203
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,225
It's all here.

204
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:51,989
Take a guick look.

205
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:58,594
$30,000?
We have to get the money back.

206
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:01,837
Fenderbaum?

207
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:04,475
- Right.
- We have to get it back.

208
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:10,474
You better tell Jim
where his car is.

209
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:13,311
Me again?
It's your turn.

210
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,450
How are you?

211
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,960
Can i help you ladies?

212
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,522
Our car broke down.

213
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,328
Right.

214
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:28,294
Take a hike?

215
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,432
Get lost.

216
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:36,240
What a jerk!

217
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:38,673
- What are we going to do?
- Martha.

218
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:42,046
Come here...

219
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:44,911
Come on here, baby.

220
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:49,413
Are you all right?

221
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:54,056
Could be. This is a beauty,
just like you.

222
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,524
It's about average.

223
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:58,663
I have to enjoy it
before the license fee goes up.

224
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,092
What do you want?

225
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:03,132
- A ride.
- All right. Get in.

226
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:05,663
- I'm Martha.
- I'm Jill.

227
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:08,305
- I'm George.
- You're a nice guy.

228
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,877
Attention Japan Cargo.
Please land at hangar three.

229
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:17,446
Roger.

230
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,415
We're in trouble.
We have to go through customs.

231
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,177
And they'll impound the car.

232
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:24,015
And we won't be able
to enter the race.

233
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:25,587
What shall we do?

234
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:28,922
- Land immediately.
- All right.

235
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:30,921
Take emergency action.

236
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:33,358
A cop car is following us.

237
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,426
- Get rid of it.
- Roger.

238
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:40,095
- Take action 9.
- Roger.

239
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,840
Great, look for a place to hide.

240
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,489
I know you are in there.
Open the door.

241
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:13,255
Open the door, Blake. It's Fenderbaum.

242
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:15,393
It's me.

243
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:19,670
I know you're in there.

244
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,156
I know a way.

245
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:49,766
Men...Women...

246
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,229
When i make a dry Martini,
it's really a dry Martini.

247
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:05,316
- Someone's knocking at the window.
- It's the window cleaner.

248
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:11,452
- Go and see who it is.
- Forget it. I don't have the time.

249
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,557
Blake, open the window, let me in.

250
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:19,059
Let me handle this.
I'll be back.

251
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:26,266
Someone sure picked the wrong time.
It's annoying.

252
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:28,770
Blake, I'm here.

253
00:20:31,476 --> 00:20:33,740
I'm in a serious situation.
You leave first.

254
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:36,472
Blake, I'm here on serious business.

255
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:38,139
- What a coincidence?
- Right.

256
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,656
Do you want to kill me?
This is the 18th floor.

257
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:48,884
Really? It's the 18th floor?

258
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,324
- The 18th floor?
- Right, the 18th floor.

259
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,260
Really?

260
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:07,741
You are the tallest short guy
l've ever seen.

261
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,039
- Read this good news.
- What?

262
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:14,879
The Sheikh is organizing
the Cannonball Run this year.

263
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:17,850
First prize is one million dollars.

264
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:21,025
If we win, we'll be rich.

265
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,391
Be careful! Watch out!

266
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:26,655
- Don't come in. l'll come out.
- Blake.

267
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,130
Where are you going?

268
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,829
I don't need you
when I have a million dollars.

269
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:35,267
You creep.

270
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:40,137
How come you become
a window cleaner?

271
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:41,803
Just now. It was the only way
to make you come out.

272
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:59,989
You're on time, Doctor.

273
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,557
- Money can make anyone on time.
- Smart.

274
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:07,463
Don't worry.
I can cure those who aren't sick.

275
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:11,531
I can't cure the ones who are sick.

276
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,779
I have to win the Cannonball Run
this time.

277
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,744
That's why I need you
to take care of me on the road.

278
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,976
Are you good at curing ulcers?

279
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,383
My speciality is haemorrhoids.

280
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,354
I guess it's all the same.

281
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:32,986
My examination will cure you.

282
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:36,066
Let me give you a check-up.

283
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,934
Open up your mouth.

284
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:46,604
I'm clean. You know my rules.

285
00:22:47,512 --> 00:22:52,575
Everyone has to pay me
no matter who it is.

286
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:58,654
Right...you're good.

287
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:04,061
What are you doing? Drinking milk?

288
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:07,460
It won't improve your health
if you fool around like this.

289
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,658
It's better than nothing.

290
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:12,694
Can i help you?

291
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:14,400
Whiskey and water.

292
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,502
Does anyone speak Oriental?

293
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:19,303
Two Whiskeys and water.

294
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,841
I'll get you something.

295
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:33,887
Are you deaf?
Whiskey and water. Go.

296
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:39,528
- Hurry.
- All right, coming right up.

297
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,031
We'll get a bottle of champagne.

298
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,169
And we'll go up to my place.

299
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:47,266
Father, what are you saying?

300
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:51,072
Haven't you seen The Thornbirds?

301
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:57,270
Pal, this outfit is no good.

302
00:23:57,415 --> 00:24:00,782
You can look but you can't touch.
It's a pity.

303
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:03,354
Why do i still feel hungry?

304
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:05,351
Order something again.

305
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:09,391
Roast pigeon tastes good,
at a good price.

306
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:11,995
What about steak? Last time l...

307
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:15,196
I'm not talking about food.

308
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,800
What are you talking about?

309
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:19,699
- I meant women.
- Women.

310
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:22,065
If there aren't women in this world,

311
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,808
being a rich man is meaningless.

312
00:24:24,976 --> 00:24:27,843
- Right, i agree.
- You agree?

313
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,537
Yes, J.J., I'm not gay.

314
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:32,683
I know you're not.

315
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:37,377
You're just a little different.

316
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:40,684
I'm just kidding.

317
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:43,158
If you want a girl,
I'll give you one of mine.

318
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:44,228
But that's how you get diseases.

319
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:45,420
It wouldn't be a coincidence.

320
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:48,466
Then hurry up.
I can't hold on anymore.

321
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:52,536
- What's up?
- Seems like we have the girls.

322
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:53,897
We'll have fun tonight.

323
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:54,800
Yeah, have fun tonight.

324
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:57,167
- What fun?
- Let's go.

325
00:25:00,745 --> 00:25:03,305
You have to leave after the fun.

326
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:06,278
J.J. how are you?

327
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:09,386
- Do you have any plans tonight?
- Not yet.

328
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,388
Let's have fun tonight.

329
00:25:12,824 --> 00:25:14,086
Count me in.

330
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:34,706
Do we still owe Don Don $30,000?

331
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,248
- Didn't you pay him back?
- No.

332
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:40,613
That means
you still owe him $30,000.

333
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,918
Some collectors are here
for the money.

334
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:46,921
What collectors? Where?

335
00:25:47,058 --> 00:25:48,923
They're at the entrance. Don't look.

336
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:53,657
Stupid, i told you not to look.

337
00:25:53,865 --> 00:25:57,232
They're at the entrance,
so we'll sneak out the back door.

338
00:25:57,402 --> 00:26:00,371
They can't be in two places
at the same time.

339
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:03,102
- Good idea.
- Of course.

340
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:12,647
We're dead this time.

341
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:17,150
They won't be easy on us.

342
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:18,883
You signed the loan.

343
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:21,821
Then it has nothing to do with me.

344
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,428
If you don't pay, you won't live.

345
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:34,000
My life isn't worth anything.

346
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:39,710
Listen to me.
Do you think we'd run away?

347
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:41,278
We know we owe you money.

348
00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:43,972
That's why we're here?

349
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:46,412
Then, tell me what you want to do.

350
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:49,246
We want to enter the Cannonball Run.

351
00:26:49,354 --> 00:26:51,618
We want to win the million dollars
and pay our debt.

352
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:54,155
What idiot would offer
that much money?

353
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:58,693
Fenderbaum, Blake,
aren't you both in the race?

354
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,797
Why don't you go rest?

355
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:03,731
It starts early tomorrow.

356
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:10,606
You guys don't have taste.

357
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:17,477
Take the money.
The Godfather look is out.

358
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:18,977
Buy yourself something new.

359
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:20,879
That's him.

360
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:25,282
It seems like this Sheikh is rich.

361
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,472
Boss, it's nice to see you.

362
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:54,407
You look handsome.
Welcome to the Pinto Ranch.

363
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,077
Do you want to have some fun today?

364
00:28:01,092 --> 00:28:03,458
- May i have a chair?
- Of course.

365
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,596
This is serious.

366
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,464
My...my father, do you know him?

367
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:15,799
Do you mind if i call you Dumb-Dumb?

368
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:18,499
Okay. Dumb-Dumb.

369
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:21,711
Your father knows
you are a bum.

370
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,437
That's why he asked me to help you.

371
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:26,082
So he sent you to Las Vegas

372
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,309
to learn the business from me.

373
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:32,182
So what did i do?
I gave you a job on this ranch.

374
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:35,224
But you only fool around
with the girls here.

375
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:36,123
I just slept with one girl.

376
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:38,989
- The girl was ugly.
- Shut up.

377
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,690
Forget about that.

378
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,769
I lent you the money
to operate a prostitution ring.

379
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:50,465
- The economy isn't doing well.
- Is that right?

380
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:53,040
How much does he owe?

381
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:54,772
As of 9:30 a.m.,

382
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:59,145
with compound interest
and administrative fees,

383
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:04,550
the total is $9,332,448.55.

384
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,151
Mr. Hahn, I'm doing the best i can.

385
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,384
What? You're going to die.

386
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,656
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

387
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,165
You have to pay off your debt
by tomorrow.

388
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:20,862
You still have a day.
Tomorrow is the due date.

389
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:23,004
- Great.
- Shut up.

390
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:29,306
You'll be dead if you don't pay
within 24 hours.

391
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:33,079
Don't ever have a name like his.

392
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:35,078
What do you think?

393
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:41,083
- It's funny, boss.
- Don't laugh.

394
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:43,357
No one can laugh
without my permission.

395
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:47,059
So that's it. Dumb-Dumb.

396
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:51,032
Mr. Hahn, i have a guestion.

397
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:53,270
I'm dead.

398
00:29:56,941 --> 00:29:58,408
Anymore guestions?

399
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:01,706
No...no guestions.

400
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:08,743
Is he really your uncle?

401
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:10,945
He is also your uncle.

402
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:12,055
The relationship is complicated.

403
00:30:12,223 --> 00:30:14,282
I still don't understand.

404
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:18,226
He used to visit us often.
I call his mother, Aunt.

405
00:30:18,362 --> 00:30:20,922
Your mother
and my mother are sisters.

406
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:28,036
He's the spouse of our eldest aunt.

407
00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:30,037
I haven't seen him for a long time.

408
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:33,472
I only know he drives a white car.

409
00:30:34,011 --> 00:30:35,569
My mother never mentioned him.

410
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:38,777
Uncle.

411
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,579
Sons, my place sells high-end cars.

412
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:48,885
Nowadays, we have ways
of doing business.

413
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,121
I started my business here.

414
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:56,422
Uncle, I'm Melvin.
You held me when i was a child.

415
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,632
Are you really my nephews?

416
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:00,862
I am Susan's son.

417
00:31:01,205 --> 00:31:02,570
I don't recall.

418
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:07,902
That doesn't matter.
Doesn't that driver look different?

419
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:11,208
He...is a bit special.

420
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:14,782
Not only that, he looks strange.

421
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:17,080
I didn't know it was so easy
to get a license here.

422
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:21,124
He doesn't have a license of course.
Come here...

423
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:23,557
I drive from the back.

424
00:31:23,694 --> 00:31:26,254
He just pretends to drive the car.

425
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:29,159
It's my way of doing business.
Here's my slogan...

426
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:33,201
''If a monkey can drive, so can you.''

427
00:31:36,707 --> 00:31:40,666
He's interesting.
I treat him like my partner.

428
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:44,579
Come, partner, isn't this fun?

429
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,912
Yes, it's fun.

430
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:49,417
Uncle, we have a small problem.

431
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,283
Yes. We're broke.
We're almost bankrupt.

432
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:54,820
We want to borrow your car.

433
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,953
Are you going to use it
for something illegal?

434
00:31:59,096 --> 00:32:02,964
No, we want to get into a race.

435
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,432
The Cannonball Run.

436
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:08,832
Stop it. I told you not to play
with the phone.

437
00:32:10,474 --> 00:32:13,932
This stupid monkey always makes
long distance calls by mistake.

438
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:19,307
Stupid monkey. Stop it.

439
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:23,111
Wait a second.
I'll teach him a lesson.

440
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:25,682
Stupid monkey.

441
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:30,088
I can't stand this anymore.

442
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:36,700
Let's do this.
I will lend you the car.

443
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:39,563
But you have to bring him along.

444
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,934
You don't have to pay me if he dies.

445
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,639
I didn't expect

446
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:51,109
to look so real in a nun's habit.

447
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:54,583
It's so hot in this outfit.

448
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,186
- I want to get a cup of coffee.
- Good.

449
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,581
- Are we scheduled tomorrow?
- Yes...

450
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:01,391
I'm sick of playing small roles.

451
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:03,093
I don't even have a line.

452
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:06,390
Dreaming of becoming a star
is ruining my life.

453
00:33:11,302 --> 00:33:13,463
My goodness, it's so crowded here.

454
00:33:14,672 --> 00:33:16,640
We're finished.
You can have our seats.

455
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:18,842
- Thank you.
- You're so nice.

456
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:20,706
God bless you.

457
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:30,616
I'm sick and tired
of being a supporting actress.

458
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:32,120
I really want to change my career.

459
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:33,449
Betty, you can't rush things.

460
00:33:33,557 --> 00:33:34,922
You have to wait for a chance
in this business.

461
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:36,991
I'll have to wait until i get old.

462
00:33:37,094 --> 00:33:39,654
The best way to make money
is to look for a rich man.

463
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,059
It doesn't matter if he marries me.

464
00:33:41,265 --> 00:33:43,426
As long as he gives me money.

465
00:33:43,534 --> 00:33:45,195
How are we going to spend
a million dollars?

466
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:46,531
- How will we spend it?
- Listen to me.

467
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:49,366
I want to buy a race horse
for the Derby.

468
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:51,566
Then I'll buy a TV station
for my son.

469
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:55,668
I'll spend the rest on a mistress.

470
00:33:56,614 --> 00:34:00,072
There are a thousand ways
to spend the money.

471
00:34:00,217 --> 00:34:01,878
- Right?
- You're smart.

472
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:04,414
We've found our targets.

473
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:05,784
- Are you insane?
- Listen to me.

474
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:09,490
You're so clumsy. Look at you.

475
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:10,885
What shall i do?

476
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:13,759
- Women will suck you dry...
- Come over here.

477
00:34:13,864 --> 00:34:16,025
Mister. I'm sorry to interrupt you.

478
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,967
We accidentally spilled coffee
all over our table.

479
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:20,661
May we join you?

480
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:23,840
Certainly. It's great...

481
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,509
You don't have to get up.
We'll sit couple to couple.

482
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,673
- Couple to couple?
- Great.

483
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:32,940
- J.J. they're joining us.
- Thank you.

484
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,745
I'm Sister Veronica.

485
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:36,682
- I'm Sister Betty.
- How are you?

486
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:39,856
I'm J.J. and he's my partner, Victor.

487
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,252
We're partners.

488
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:42,892
Are you two related?

489
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,328
No, we're just business partners.

490
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:50,062
It's that simple.

491
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:51,325
And you two?

492
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:55,494
Betty and i are like real sisters.

493
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:59,734
What is your occupation?

494
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:02,708
- We're professional...
- Car racers.

495
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,940
Right. We're in a race today
that's going to the east coast.

496
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,311
Really? Then you'll be rich?

497
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:13,083
Sure. Which church are you from?

498
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,556
Our church is old and ugly.
We're from...

499
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:16,784
The Old and Ugly Church.

500
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,328
We and some other sisters

501
00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:20,997
- organized a detox centre...
- It's a community.

502
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:22,793
It's called
the Desert Detox Community.

503
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:26,232
- The name sounds strange.
- It's new.

504
00:35:26,303 --> 00:35:27,565
I'm very familiar with the bible,

505
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:30,707
because i always pray
the night before a race.

506
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:33,968
l've never heard that name.

507
00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:35,236
You're reading an old version
of the Bible.

508
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:38,348
Even the teaching material
changes every year.

509
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:40,610
- Right.
- Is that right?

510
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:42,548
The Bible has to be updated.

511
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,982
It should be.

512
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:46,988
We still have work to do.
Let's go. Bye.

513
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,225
- Right, we'll talk later.
- Good.

514
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:51,890
- Let's go.
- When does the race begin?

515
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:54,462
- At noon.
- At the hotel entrance.

516
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:56,395
- Bye, sisters.
- Bye.

517
00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:58,726
Let's go.

518
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:00,899
- Talk to you later.
- Bye.

519
00:36:01,138 --> 00:36:03,800
- Bye...
- Many people need our help.

520
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,870
Is the problem resolved?

521
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:11,343
I can solve any problem.

522
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:13,109
We have the thing planned.

523
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:14,775
While they are racing,

524
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,978
we will get that Arab.

525
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:19,885
Are you insane? Kill the Arab?

526
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,855
He is a very rich man.

527
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:23,219
Yes, i know.

528
00:36:23,327 --> 00:36:26,091
I still owe someone a lot of money.
What time is it now?

529
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:28,358
I'm in trouble.
I have to pay off my debt tomorrow.

530
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:31,890
If we catch the Arab,
everything will be solved.

531
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:35,560
He wants us to think of a way
to catch that Arab.

532
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:36,764
Why?

533
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:39,843
Why? lf we have him,

534
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,478
we can extort him.

535
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:45,580
Don't get mad. i know what to do.

536
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:47,717
- You really blew me off.
- Good night.

537
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,294
Anna, try it again.

538
00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:20,147
Step on the gas.

539
00:37:27,658 --> 00:37:28,920
Everything is fine.

540
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:35,997
Do you think those military people

541
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,634
will salute when they see you?

542
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:43,466
You're cunning.

543
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,344
Jill, Martha, it's great.

544
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:52,637
J.J. looks cocky.

545
00:37:52,816 --> 00:37:54,579
His partner doesn't look that great.

546
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,516
That fat guy always gets cheated.

547
00:37:57,655 --> 00:37:59,816
Those two can't compare to us.

548
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:03,189
- Let's check out the other racers.
- All right.

549
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:06,191
How do i look?

550
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,993
- You look smart and sexy.
- Sexy?

551
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:15,063
- You too...
- I don't look that great.

552
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,207
- No.
- What's my title?

553
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,002
Landmine soldier.

554
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:23,542
A solider on the front lines.

555
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:24,774
- That's brave.
- Right.

556
00:38:24,882 --> 00:38:27,350
J.J., i want a medal.

557
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:29,782
- A medal?
- I'll look better with one.

558
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,581
All right, you can choose one.

559
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:34,691
No, i can't take one of yours.

560
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:35,689
I feel embarrassed.

561
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:37,121
We're partners. Help yourself.

562
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:38,454
All right.

563
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:42,127
That one looks good. Thank you.

564
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:46,334
You're so generous.
A medal of the highest honour.

565
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:50,467
Thank you so much. This suits me.

566
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:53,572
It's beautiful. I really like it.

567
00:38:53,744 --> 00:38:57,305
It looks so shiny under the sun.
Look who it is.

568
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:58,979
How are you?

569
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,915
- How are you?
- Are you a General?

570
00:39:01,118 --> 00:39:04,485
You're a General. He's a lieutenant.

571
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,047
He's just a soldier.

572
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:09,819
General, can you help us?

573
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,928
We have an urgent errand
and we have to go to New York.

574
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:14,393
There are many people
who need our help there.

575
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:16,499
Can you give us a ride?

576
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:18,601
It's because our church is poor.

577
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:21,932
- We can't afford to buy tickets.
- Let's do it.

578
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,403
The other racers
aren't as fast as you.

579
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:28,407
And you're funny.

580
00:39:29,246 --> 00:39:30,213
Funny?

581
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:32,941
Yes, you know that we're sisters.

582
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:35,048
We may look serious,

583
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,344
but we like to relax
when we get the chance.

584
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:38,385
Relax?

585
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:40,786
You want to relax?
As you like.

586
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:43,551
We have to discuss this.

587
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:45,457
- What are you doing?
- Come over here.

588
00:39:45,896 --> 00:39:46,954
What?

589
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:48,792
I think you overdid it.

590
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:51,125
Funny and relaxed.

591
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,962
What's wrong with being relaxed?

592
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,503
- i know.
- Helping people is difficult.

593
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:57,367
It's a jinx to have nuns
come with us.

594
00:39:57,508 --> 00:39:58,372
Just do something good.

595
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:00,042
If we let them come with us,

596
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,770
we won't be able to pick up girls.

597
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:05,915
I know I'm a womanizer.

598
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,813
But if they come with us...

599
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:11,216
- We can use them as shields.
- All right.

600
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:18,592
J.J. is the best.

601
00:40:19,229 --> 00:40:20,196
Let's get into the car.

602
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:22,332
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

603
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:24,897
J.J., you'll go to heaven.

604
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:26,297
It's an honour for the angels.

605
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:28,229
The handbag is trendy.

606
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,037
We follow trends, too.

607
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:33,272
I have to make myself clear.
We're in the military.

608
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:37,005
We do what we want to do.
Aren't you scared?

609
00:40:37,214 --> 00:40:39,079
- That's all right.
- That's good.

610
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,913
Being a nun is a tough job.

611
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,780
My daughter
doesn't want to become one.

612
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:47,885
Look who is here.

613
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:49,857
It's someone famous.

614
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:53,196
It's General Patent
and General Administrator.

615
00:40:56,166 --> 00:41:00,227
It's better to be a cop
when you're chased by one.

616
00:41:00,804 --> 00:41:01,964
Something's wrong.

617
00:41:02,973 --> 00:41:05,840
Miss, let me tell you.

618
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:09,504
We were disguised as priests before.
We didn't win.

619
00:41:09,646 --> 00:41:11,614
Disguising yourselves as nuns
won't do you any good.

620
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,217
That's why we're disguised as cops.

621
00:41:15,352 --> 00:41:17,912
We can protect the ladies.

622
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:23,788
We can also search them.
That's great.

623
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:25,052
You really have guts.

624
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:28,196
They're real nuns.

625
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:29,697
You have to pay them respect.

626
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,266
Watch yourself!

627
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:52,486
You solve your own problem.

628
00:41:52,756 --> 00:41:54,519
Everybody, come here...

629
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:57,251
Fenderbaum, Blake, J.J. and fat guy,

630
00:41:57,461 --> 00:42:00,430
come here and listen
to the rules of the race.

631
00:42:00,564 --> 00:42:03,328
Although I'm the prince
of the Falafel family,

632
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:09,599
I do my business seriously.

633
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:12,635
Don't laugh...

634
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:16,370
To encourage this race,

635
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:19,006
I personally donate a million dollars

636
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:22,050
as the first prize.

637
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:24,249
We will be rich.

638
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:30,322
- Good.
- I wish i had a million dollars.

639
00:42:30,427 --> 00:42:35,296
But i get an advantage
for offering this prize.

640
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,367
I have to be the first one
to start the race.

641
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:42,929
General, is car racing dangerous?

642
00:42:43,073 --> 00:42:45,132
It's not. It's exciting.

643
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,341
Captain Chaos is back.

644
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:53,075
How are you?

645
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:55,943
J.J., I'm here to protect you.
You will win this time.

646
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:58,850
Ask the nuns to get into the car.
We'll take off now.

647
00:42:59,122 --> 00:43:00,885
Your partner is good at acting.

648
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:03,991
It's not acting. This is real.

649
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:06,887
General, you sit in the back.

650
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:10,124
Sister Betty and l
will sit up front.

651
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:15,233
- The fat guy is cute.
- Of course.

652
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:19,904
Don't try to be funny.

653
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:25,407
Everybody, wish me luck.
I hope all of you fail. Cheers.

654
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:07,950
Thank you. Goodbye...

655
00:44:29,012 --> 00:44:30,570
Are you out of your mind?

656
00:44:30,714 --> 00:44:33,274
You're blocking the way. Move away!

657
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,679
All right.

658
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:08,549
Say it again.

659
00:45:09,953 --> 00:45:13,218
You're so stupid. Listen carefully.

660
00:45:13,323 --> 00:45:14,585
Get close to his car.

661
00:45:14,691 --> 00:45:17,159
Press the button at the right time.

662
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:18,726
The metal hand
clamps onto the car's bumper.

663
00:45:18,895 --> 00:45:21,056
Then i will step on the brake

664
00:45:21,164 --> 00:45:24,429
to stop his car.
Then you go and grab him.

665
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:27,031
Now do you understand?

666
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:30,506
I understand.

667
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:53,322
Attention, there's a cop behind you.

668
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,090
We'll be in trouble.

669
00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:57,266
This doesn't work during the day,
only at night.

670
00:45:58,001 --> 00:45:59,662
Show them what you can do.

671
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,628
The cop is getting closer.

672
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,471
- Everything is ready.
- The jet is ready.

673
00:46:17,587 --> 00:46:20,351
Good, this is great.

674
00:46:27,464 --> 00:46:28,624
They are coming.

675
00:46:28,965 --> 00:46:31,126
Are they here yet?
I am still a bit confused.

676
00:46:32,402 --> 00:46:36,361
It's easy. We'll chase them
and grab their rear bumper.

677
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,301
Watch me. I'm ready. Be careful.

678
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:41,977
Be calm. Ready. Go.

679
00:46:42,512 --> 00:46:44,173
Press the button...

680
00:46:44,614 --> 00:46:45,672
Press.

681
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:49,352
The car is shaking,
I can't press the button.

682
00:46:49,986 --> 00:46:52,750
If you're so good,
why don't you do it? Press...

683
00:46:55,325 --> 00:46:58,988
- His car isn't going anywhere.
- Not going anywhere.

684
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:10,769
The car took off.
We can't even follow them now.

685
00:47:24,988 --> 00:47:26,751
That's cute.

686
00:47:43,373 --> 00:47:44,840
Granny,
do you want a tire change?

687
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:49,838
Tony, will we make it this time?

688
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:52,675
Shut up, we've been working together

689
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:54,316
for a long time,
have we ever failed?

690
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,551
The control panel

691
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:04,422
in this helicopter
has been improved.

692
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:09,563
Your body may be intact
after a car accident,

693
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:12,134
but you'll be minced meat
in a helicopter accident.

694
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:19,597
Shut up.
Keep reading the instructions.

695
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,570
If you want to live, read louder.

696
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,097
We made it.

697
00:48:42,432 --> 00:48:44,297
But you're so scared
your hair is standing on end.

698
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:47,069
Can you explain to me
how to catch him?

699
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:48,166
Why?

700
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:50,466
This is too complicated.
One explanation isn't enough.

701
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:53,035
You are as dumb as a pig.

702
00:48:53,243 --> 00:48:57,202
Listen, we have a magnet.
It can even pick up a truck.

703
00:48:58,181 --> 00:48:59,842
Is it that powerful?

704
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:06,184
We are driving really fast.
Are we speeding?

705
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:08,550
Yes. We are going 110 m.p.h.

706
00:49:11,127 --> 00:49:12,788
It is really exciting.

707
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:14,621
Are you touching my thigh?

708
00:49:16,032 --> 00:49:17,294
Yes.

709
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,438
It's all right. Please continue.

710
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,772
We have just passed a cop.

711
00:49:28,979 --> 00:49:30,446
It doesn't matter.
Just pretend we didn't see him.

712
00:49:31,114 --> 00:49:32,775
Sir, how fast are you driving?

713
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:35,544
About 80 m.p.h.

714
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:37,687
They just passed us.

715
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:39,650
We have to give them a ticket.

716
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,855
Watch me. You're still a rookie.

717
00:49:42,025 --> 00:49:45,085
So you've never been involved
in a real car chase.

718
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:49,327
Oh no. The cops are behind us.

719
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:52,901
They just want my autograph.

720
00:49:57,707 --> 00:50:00,801
What is wrong? What happened?

721
00:50:00,877 --> 00:50:03,243
I am afraid of the cops.

722
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,347
You are afraid?

723
00:50:06,683 --> 00:50:09,243
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

724
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:12,286
I am counting on you.
Your hands are warm.

725
00:50:12,455 --> 00:50:14,218
They are steaming hot.

726
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:17,522
- His whole body is very warm.
- Is that right?

727
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:21,119
You know what?
Fatty's thigh is warm, too.

728
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:24,995
There is a technigue to speeding.

729
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:27,103
Going in the same direction

730
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,738
will give you 20 m.p.h. more,
even when making a turn.

731
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:49,649
What are you writing?

732
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:50,953
My resignation letter.

733
00:51:02,205 --> 00:51:03,467
It is lunch time, Prince.

734
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:05,772
You will get a stomach ache
if you eat too much.

735
00:51:05,942 --> 00:51:09,708
Let me have some.
I will have the stomach ache instead.

736
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:16,709
His car is ahead of us.

737
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:18,013
I see it.

738
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:23,886
This is getting exciting.

739
00:51:24,094 --> 00:51:25,959
What do we do now?

740
00:51:26,362 --> 00:51:28,728
Of course, we will follow it.

741
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:30,263
When they are not looking,

742
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,267
we will use the magnet
to pick the car up.

743
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:34,836
It's better than using super glue.

744
00:51:35,004 --> 00:51:38,462
That is great, Tony.
I have faith in you.

745
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:40,700
I have to be 100%   certain.

746
00:51:41,377 --> 00:51:42,742
That is good.

747
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,275
Do you think we are too low?

748
00:51:45,815 --> 00:51:46,782
You don't understand.

749
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:49,111
We are almost touching the car.

750
00:51:49,285 --> 00:51:50,946
Don't you think i know that?

751
00:51:54,357 --> 00:51:59,624
Go left. A bit left.

752
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:02,994
Stop mumbling in my ear.
I know what to do.

753
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:04,328
Go a bit lower.

754
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:06,666
Lower the magnet.

755
00:52:08,404 --> 00:52:10,065
It sticks like super glue.

756
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:19,771
It's so tight,
nothing can break it apart.

757
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:25,014
Let's fly into the sky...

758
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:31,156
Let's fly into the sky.

759
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:36,196
How come it is not working?

760
00:52:36,733 --> 00:52:37,995
Do you think the fan belt is broken?

761
00:52:39,569 --> 00:52:42,834
Is it too light?
Is that why it won't work?

762
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:47,942
Don't worry. I'll fix it.

763
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:51,913
I think we will have to wear
our seatbelts.

764
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:20,404
It is lunch time.

765
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:23,209
You feed him. Let me drive.

766
00:53:23,379 --> 00:53:25,939
No. It is your turn. Hurry up.

767
00:53:29,152 --> 00:53:30,210
This is for you.

768
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:34,655
What are you doing, monkey?

769
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:37,918
That monkey is crazy.
It should be sent to a clinic.

770
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:49,563
London Bridge is falling down,
falling down...

771
00:53:52,475 --> 00:53:54,033
- Soldier.
- Yes, sir?

772
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:55,508
- You're driving well.
- Thank you, Sir.

773
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:56,770
Keep up the good work.

774
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:02,607
Sister Betty,
I am familiar with the Bible.

775
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:05,984
Why haven't i heard about
the Desert Detox Community?

776
00:54:06,222 --> 00:54:08,190
- It has to do with morality.
- Morality?

777
00:54:08,391 --> 00:54:10,359
She doesn't have a good memory.

778
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:16,521
- We want to rest now.
- Go ahead.

779
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,301
If you don't mind,
we have to change.

780
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:22,338
Please go ahead. Don't be shy.

781
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:24,133
Goodnight.

782
00:54:31,114 --> 00:54:34,880
I think they're open-minded.

783
00:54:34,984 --> 00:54:36,645
It's nice that they're open-minded.

784
00:54:37,086 --> 00:54:40,954
Nice?
I can't control myself anymore.

785
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:44,017
J.J., you have to control yourself.

786
00:54:44,193 --> 00:54:46,058
It's very difficult. They always...

787
00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:49,653
They're religious.
You have a dirty mind.

788
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:56,372
- They're nuns.
- They're women, too.

789
00:54:56,472 --> 00:54:58,633
I don't know what to say to you.

790
00:55:00,276 --> 00:55:03,336
I can't stop fantasizing
about those girls.

791
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:08,677
J.J.

792
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:11,954
Please forgive me, God.
I have sinned.

793
00:55:26,469 --> 00:55:28,835
Good morning, Officer.
Nice day, isn't it?

794
00:55:28,938 --> 00:55:33,102
- Don't sweet talk me. Step aside.
- All right.

795
00:55:37,547 --> 00:55:39,515
- Good morning.
- General?

796
00:55:41,384 --> 00:55:42,851
What's the matter, Officer?

797
00:55:43,419 --> 00:55:45,580
Nothing, your car
was over the speed limit.

798
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:47,650
It's a military emergency.

799
00:55:48,157 --> 00:55:49,317
How urgent is it?

800
00:55:49,892 --> 00:55:51,154
It's highly confidential.

801
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:52,792
Where is your driver's license?

802
00:55:52,962 --> 00:55:55,522
Stop.
I'm contaminated with radiation.

803
00:55:57,867 --> 00:55:59,630
Do you think I'm an idiot?

804
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:01,201
There was a nuclear radiation leak.

805
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:04,239
We have to take the leaky object
to the next state.

806
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:05,867
Why?

807
00:56:08,244 --> 00:56:09,506
To store it in a warehouse.

808
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,338
This is nonsense.

809
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:15,241
Hey, Brother-in-law!

810
00:56:15,551 --> 00:56:17,018
That's my wife's brother.

811
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:19,151
- Go ahead. We'll wait for you.
- Thank you.

812
00:56:19,255 --> 00:56:21,018
Long time no see...

813
00:56:21,157 --> 00:56:23,125
- I didn't know you're coming back.
- Private.

814
00:56:25,294 --> 00:56:26,454
General.

815
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,795
Why are you here?

816
00:56:28,898 --> 00:56:32,459
I'm on vacation.
I haven't had one in 10 years.

817
00:56:33,436 --> 00:56:35,996
I order you to drive this car
to the next state.

818
00:56:36,272 --> 00:56:38,035
- Go and drive.
- Yes, Sir.

819
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:41,406
Wait a minute.
I have to check it out first.

820
00:56:41,811 --> 00:56:44,279
His rank is higher.
I have to listen to him.

821
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:46,075
See how many medals he has.

822
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:48,909
I don't care. I have to check.

823
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,581
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Officer.

824
00:56:53,089 --> 00:56:54,249
What's going on?

825
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:55,619
General, what happened?

826
00:56:55,725 --> 00:56:56,783
I'm sorry, Sisters.

827
00:56:56,926 --> 00:56:59,690
I tried to explain everything
to the officer.

828
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:01,692
Why are these nuns with you?

829
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:06,560
- Just in case we die while on duty.
- This is serious.

830
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:08,532
The mission is called ''God Knows''.

831
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:10,503
We have to keep this top secret.

832
00:57:10,706 --> 00:57:14,472
If we don't complete this mission,
the U.S. may be destroyed.

833
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:17,107
You have to be careful.

834
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,744
ln that case,
I will escort you to the border.

835
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:23,076
God bless you.

836
00:57:23,186 --> 00:57:24,744
Officer, i have to tell you.

837
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:27,685
There are two spies
disguised as cops.

838
00:57:27,824 --> 00:57:32,090
They're following us in a red car.
They're spies.

839
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:35,230
- Is that true?
- It's true.

840
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:40,961
Attention, there's a message
from the General.

841
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:44,665
Two spies disguised as cops
are driving a red car.

842
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,708
They are trying to steal
our nuclear waste.

843
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:50,003
If you see them, stop them.

844
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:51,880
Do you understand?

845
00:57:54,717 --> 00:57:57,083
Units Two and Five
are heading east.

846
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:59,347
We saw the spies.

847
00:57:59,822 --> 00:58:00,982
Spies?

848
00:58:01,557 --> 00:58:04,822
l've always been mistaken by others,
but never for a spy.

849
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:07,120
Do they think i am James Bond?

850
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:10,862
Report to the General.
The spies won't get away.

851
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:15,700
Report to the General.
What General?

852
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:21,301
It's that jerk, J.J.,
he's playing a trick on us.

853
00:58:30,553 --> 00:58:34,216
Good work.
But we're not free yet.

854
00:58:34,457 --> 00:58:37,017
Units Two and Five
are heading west.

855
00:58:38,027 --> 00:58:39,289
This is the Captain.

856
00:58:39,428 --> 00:58:42,488
Capture them. Dead or alive.

857
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:46,066
We will have to take a chance.

858
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:47,531
I am going to place the car
in the middle of the road.

859
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:50,639
So they will be blocked.

860
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,808
If they have the guts,
they will hit us.

861
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:56,035
Or else they'll go into the ditch.

862
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:58,376
Let's do that. Speed up.

863
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:00,548
If they have the guts,

864
00:59:00,983 --> 00:59:02,644
we'll be minced meat if they hit us.

865
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:03,682
That's right.

866
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:24,438
Don't throw that, stupid monkey.

867
00:59:25,808 --> 00:59:29,369
I hate sitting up here.
I am bored.

868
00:59:29,812 --> 00:59:34,078
Do you think i enjoy
sitting back here? Stupid monkey.

869
00:59:36,385 --> 00:59:38,649
I won't be easy on you
if you keep on throwing stuff.

870
00:59:49,665 --> 00:59:52,532
- Why are you out here?
- It is safer here.

871
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:56,231
- Who is driving?
- He is.

872
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:11,115
Do you want to take me to a disco?

873
01:00:11,287 --> 01:00:13,255
I haven't put on my dancing shoes.

874
01:00:22,298 --> 01:00:23,765
- Blake.
- What?

875
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:25,128
It's the General's car.

876
01:00:25,568 --> 01:00:26,830
Is the fat guy driving?

877
01:00:28,104 --> 01:00:31,164
No, the General is driving.

878
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:33,139
The General is driving.

879
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:36,834
I am going to teach him a lesson.

880
01:00:44,954 --> 01:00:49,118
We're going to win this time
and get the prize.

881
01:00:52,795 --> 01:00:56,458
You have to trust me.
You won't forget this experience.

882
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:59,065
- Will we have fun together?
- Yes.

883
01:01:00,436 --> 01:01:04,497
You'll be proud
to tell your grandchildren.

884
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:07,040
If you crash the car,

885
01:01:07,176 --> 01:01:08,837
I will never forget the experience.

886
01:01:09,278 --> 01:01:10,438
That won't happen.

887
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:14,379
We will be gentle with it.

888
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,108
Do you think you can handle
the both of us?

889
01:01:19,955 --> 01:01:21,718
- All right.
- We got it...

890
01:01:21,924 --> 01:01:23,892
The keys are in the car.
Don't mess around.

891
01:01:24,026 --> 01:01:26,586
Or else my friends will laugh at me.

892
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:28,797
They will envy you.

893
01:01:29,031 --> 01:01:32,091
- Really?
- Drink more milk for energy.

894
01:01:32,368 --> 01:01:33,528
Really?

895
01:01:39,475 --> 01:01:41,238
Is the tank full?

896
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:43,403
Please drive carefully.

897
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,538
Bye, handsome.

898
01:02:01,797 --> 01:02:04,664
Look at that fat guy.

899
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:13,403
What are you doing?

900
01:02:17,513 --> 01:02:19,071
What do you want?

901
01:02:28,357 --> 01:02:29,619
Give me a hand.

902
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:31,851
Why do i have to?
I am not involved in this.

903
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:33,824
Help me cut this. Come on.

904
01:02:36,432 --> 01:02:38,195
- Thank you.
- You don't have team spirit.

905
01:02:56,886 --> 01:02:58,251
I will help you later.

906
01:03:09,932 --> 01:03:11,695
Did i scare you? Are you all right?

907
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:13,802
Don't be afraid.
I will protect you.

908
01:03:13,936 --> 01:03:15,995
Can we go for a ride later?

909
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:24,370
This is the first time
l've been rescued.

910
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:27,107
Please stay for dinner
and meet my parents.

911
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:29,074
- You're great.
- You're so capable.

912
01:03:29,118 --> 01:03:30,380
- It's wonderful.
- Please, don't mention it.

913
01:03:30,586 --> 01:03:31,644
What's your name?

914
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:32,821
I'm Jack...

915
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:34,923
We still have to finish the race.

916
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:36,491
A million dollar prize
is waiting for us.

917
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:37,954
No, she and i are...

918
01:03:38,227 --> 01:03:40,195
Don't forget me when you get rich.

919
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:44,025
When i am rich, i will come back.

920
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:48,465
Why are they taking so long?

921
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:53,833
They look great. They have changed.

922
01:03:56,679 --> 01:03:59,842
- Are we too sexy?
- Maybe.

923
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,109
I am afraid we may scare them.

924
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:07,585
General, you have two pretty women
for this task.

925
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:10,692
I guess the mission
must be very important.

926
01:04:18,701 --> 01:04:21,465
All right, we have enough food.
We don't have to worry.

927
01:04:22,738 --> 01:04:26,196
You won't starve.

928
01:04:38,254 --> 01:04:41,314
You look great out of your outfit.

929
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:50,423
They're beautiful.
Private, come with me.

930
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:54,133
Disguised as nuns, huh?

931
01:04:57,006 --> 01:04:58,473
Get into the car, guickly.

932
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:03,410
Yes, General.

933
01:05:21,497 --> 01:05:25,365
What are you doing?
We don't need a gun.

934
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,506
Turn right...

935
01:05:35,744 --> 01:05:41,205
We'll use the wire to stop the car.
Then you steal the money.

936
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:43,885
- I steal the money?
- I will kidnap the Prince.

937
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:47,113
After that,
we will go back to Las Vegas.

938
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:48,551
Let's do it.

939
01:05:50,092 --> 01:05:51,559
This is Falafel.

940
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:55,826
Did you get it? Doubtful?

941
01:05:56,165 --> 01:05:57,530
What a name for a company.

942
01:05:58,634 --> 01:06:01,501
The name doesn't sound good,
but go ahead and buy it.

943
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:04,639
Use another name
to make birth control pills.

944
01:06:04,773 --> 01:06:07,640
I am going to buy. That is it.

945
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,473
Do you understand?

946
01:06:10,779 --> 01:06:13,247
I can't hear you. Speak up a bit.

947
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:15,314
I said,
do you still have a stomach ache?

948
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:18,384
- Thank you.
- It is a deal. Bye.

949
01:06:26,495 --> 01:06:27,757
What happened?

950
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:33,495
- They are coming. Make it tighter.
- I know.

951
01:06:34,269 --> 01:06:36,430
- I have tried my best.
- They are coming...

952
01:06:50,919 --> 01:06:52,079
What lousy luck!

953
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:55,214
This car is like a toy. I am so mad!

954
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,655
You get what you pay for.

955
01:06:57,926 --> 01:06:59,188
- What shall we do?
- I don't know.

956
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,191
Go and flirt with someone
so they can fix it.

957
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:22,150
They are getting intimate.

958
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:25,053
It is a real show.

959
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:43,332
The car just suddenly stopped.

960
01:07:43,505 --> 01:07:46,474
It looks like there is a gas leak.

961
01:07:47,376 --> 01:07:48,741
It is here.

962
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:50,938
This isn't the gear box.

963
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,741
What gear box?

964
01:07:52,881 --> 01:07:54,143
Can you fix it?

965
01:07:54,349 --> 01:07:57,614
I am a car repair expert.

966
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:00,481
Really?

967
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,139
How powerful is your truck?

968
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:21,932
It is eguipped with a jet engine.

969
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:24,875
- The horsepower is second to none.
- Really?

970
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,547
It doesn't look bad.

971
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,146
It is so hot.

972
01:08:34,089 --> 01:08:35,852
It is really hot.

973
01:08:40,362 --> 01:08:43,422
Sonny, believe me,
I won't trick you.

974
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:47,126
If my boss knows i am speeding,
he will yell at me.

975
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:49,134
How will he know?

976
01:08:49,638 --> 01:08:51,697
How about this?
Why don't you take me back first?

977
01:08:51,907 --> 01:08:56,276
Let me explain to my boss.
Or else i will be fired.

978
01:09:02,451 --> 01:09:05,511
Forget it. I don't care.

979
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:09,388
We will make this trip unforgettable.

980
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,664
Attention, a cop is approaching...

981
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:24,272
We have to race them.

982
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:28,601
- Use the jet.
- All right.

983
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:32,605
The jet is ready, 3, 2, 1.

984
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:34,716
- Ready.
- Go.

985
01:09:45,961 --> 01:09:47,326
- Turn it off.
- Why?

986
01:09:47,496 --> 01:09:48,861
Turn it off.

987
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:53,267
We're going into the water.

988
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:10,584
There is nothing we can do.

989
01:10:28,537 --> 01:10:30,903
Look, beer cans.

990
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:34,075
- Release the oil.
- All right.

991
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,442
There is an oil leak.

992
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:44,684
They caused the accident.
We had nothing to do with it.

993
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:46,151
I am sorry.

994
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:51,824
Attention...

995
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:52,927
What is the matter now?

996
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:09,642
Turn off the engine.

997
01:11:11,546 --> 01:11:12,808
Keep guiet.

998
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:15,007
Underwater operations. Ready.

999
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:18,379
It is all right.

1000
01:11:24,559 --> 01:11:26,925
You have to have patience
to catch a big fish.

1001
01:11:27,062 --> 01:11:29,121
- I have been waiting for 5 years.
- It is been that long?

1002
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:31,163
That is why you have to be guiet.

1003
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,699
- How do you know?
- From experience.

1004
01:11:33,835 --> 01:11:36,895
When my wife is home, i hide.

1005
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:39,774
I saw a big fish recently.

1006
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:43,244
He must be drunk.

1007
01:11:49,751 --> 01:11:51,616
Highway 40 is up ahead.

1008
01:11:51,787 --> 01:11:53,049
Go at full speed.

1009
01:12:12,174 --> 01:12:15,143
Speak of the devil. You see.
I caught a big fish.

1010
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:18,039
- I caught a fish.
- That is great.

1011
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:23,044
Going at full speed.

1012
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:29,486
Look, smoke is coming out of it.

1013
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:31,056
The fish must be big. Don't let go!

1014
01:12:31,259 --> 01:12:33,022
That fish must weigh
a few hundred pounds.

1015
01:12:33,528 --> 01:12:35,291
Hold on tight. Don't let go!

1016
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:44,970
It must be fun to be in the army.

1017
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,800
It's not bad when you're not at war.

1018
01:12:48,543 --> 01:12:49,908
- General.
- What is the matter?

1019
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:52,073
Since our mission is dangerous,

1020
01:12:52,147 --> 01:12:55,116
why don't we let the Private go?

1021
01:12:56,051 --> 01:12:56,915
I will consider it.

1022
01:12:57,052 --> 01:12:59,020
His girlfriend is waiting for him.

1023
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:01,487
- J.J., let him go.
- Well...

1024
01:13:01,656 --> 01:13:03,021
This is inhumane.

1025
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:05,920
I'll break the rules just this once.
Watch me.

1026
01:13:06,461 --> 01:13:07,826
- Private.
- Yes, Sir?

1027
01:13:08,497 --> 01:13:09,862
You have done well.

1028
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:13,167
ln order not to disappoint
your girlfriend,

1029
01:13:14,036 --> 01:13:17,199
l've decided to let you go home.
Stop the car.

1030
01:13:17,406 --> 01:13:18,566
Yes, Sir.

1031
01:13:40,662 --> 01:13:41,924
Listen to me.

1032
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:44,594
I really appreciate your attitude.

1033
01:13:44,766 --> 01:13:48,327
Your performance shows
that you are a patriot.

1034
01:13:48,703 --> 01:13:52,366
l've decided to give you a medal
of the highest honour.

1035
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:59,178
- My medal?
- That is right. Your medal.

1036
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:11,216
- Then i won't have any.
- Shut up.

1037
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:15,630
General, i have taken
my driving test 30 times.

1038
01:14:15,797 --> 01:14:17,162
I am delighted
that i have gained your trust

1039
01:14:17,332 --> 01:14:18,594
to be your driver.

1040
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,859
I am really honoured.

1041
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,550
Goodbye.

1042
01:14:57,506 --> 01:14:58,871
This time we can't go wrong.

1043
01:14:59,074 --> 01:15:02,532
It is hard to find a partner
who can fly.

1044
01:15:02,677 --> 01:15:04,645
You are flying now.

1045
01:15:04,846 --> 01:15:07,212
- Read the landing instructions.
- All right.

1046
01:15:10,118 --> 01:15:12,086
It says to lower the flaps.

1047
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:15,114
- Why don't you lower the flaps?
- Where are they?

1048
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:17,983
On the right side...stupid.

1049
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,821
There are 40 buttons.
They are all numbered.

1050
01:15:19,995 --> 01:15:21,257
Which one do i press?

1051
01:15:21,296 --> 01:15:22,558
Choose anyone.

1052
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:25,097
- An even or odd number?
- It is up to you.

1053
01:15:49,624 --> 01:15:52,184
I am writing a song.
I am better than Quincy Jones.

1054
01:15:56,498 --> 01:15:59,558
I don't understand.
I though flying was difficult?

1055
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:01,669
We can't fail this time.

1056
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:04,532
I just spoke with Don Don.
He is mad.

1057
01:16:05,974 --> 01:16:07,532
Don't worry.

1058
01:16:08,476 --> 01:16:11,240
The easiest way is the best way.

1059
01:16:11,346 --> 01:16:12,813
No problem.

1060
01:16:13,515 --> 01:16:14,379
Really?

1061
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:18,212
Relax, all right?

1062
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:26,892
I am starting to have stomach ache.
Do you have any painkillers?

1063
01:16:28,396 --> 01:16:30,364
This is a new product.

1064
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:36,462
It is slimy,
but it is better than an injection.

1065
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:52,914
I guess it is fate.

1066
01:16:53,622 --> 01:16:55,590
This is a product of Allah.

1067
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:58,255
A pretty girl
standing by the side of the road

1068
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,827
is a waste.

1069
01:17:00,295 --> 01:17:02,263
Why don't you come home with me?

1070
01:17:02,631 --> 01:17:04,895
I am the famous prince
of the Falafel family.

1071
01:17:04,966 --> 01:17:06,228
My family is rich.

1072
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:08,029
You will enjoy luxury
if you come with me.

1073
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:12,596
After probation, you can be my...

1074
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:13,901
Seventieth wife.

1075
01:17:14,075 --> 01:17:16,441
I hate people pointing guns at me.

1076
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:23,048
If you do well,
you will get promoted.

1077
01:17:27,889 --> 01:17:29,151
This is fun. Did we make you horny?

1078
01:17:29,324 --> 01:17:30,689
Especially when we got changed?

1079
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:32,157
Did you guys get horny?

1080
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,728
It was all Betty's idea.

1081
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:36,922
We are always dressed up.

1082
01:17:36,965 --> 01:17:38,728
We didn't expect you to believe us.

1083
01:17:38,967 --> 01:17:40,127
We are very innocent.

1084
01:17:40,335 --> 01:17:44,601
We were afraid
that you would kick us out.

1085
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:47,236
How could l?

1086
01:17:50,412 --> 01:17:52,471
We did it to make money.

1087
01:17:53,315 --> 01:17:55,180
Who wouldn't want to?

1088
01:17:57,452 --> 01:17:58,714
Let me kiss you.

1089
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:01,253
I have been waiting for this
for a long time.

1090
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,831
I hate giving out speeding tickets.

1091
01:18:15,036 --> 01:18:17,800
Especially to big shots.

1092
01:18:22,277 --> 01:18:23,642
I have to give you a ticket...

1093
01:18:26,681 --> 01:18:28,046
Don't mess around.

1094
01:18:32,487 --> 01:18:33,749
Why did you kiss that monkey?

1095
01:18:33,955 --> 01:18:36,822
That car is a bit strange.
Go and check it out.

1096
01:18:37,592 --> 01:18:38,957
I know. This must be Candid Camera.

1097
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:40,061
Don't look!

1098
01:18:40,228 --> 01:18:43,493
The program
that plays tricks on people.

1099
01:18:43,698 --> 01:18:46,064
- We are on TV now.
- We are going to be movie stars.

1100
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:48,735
Go back and be smart.
Stand straight, hurry.

1101
01:18:49,904 --> 01:18:51,565
Be calm. Be more expressive.

1102
01:18:51,706 --> 01:18:53,571
Come on...you can do better.

1103
01:18:54,242 --> 01:18:56,005
I am sorry. Can i have your license?

1104
01:19:02,984 --> 01:19:05,248
He hit a cop. He will go to jail.

1105
01:19:06,721 --> 01:19:08,279
He thinks we are playing with him.

1106
01:19:10,725 --> 01:19:12,283
Don't mess around.
Don't make him angry.

1107
01:19:18,032 --> 01:19:19,693
You have to take it
if you want to be a star.

1108
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:22,868
I have had acting classes.
I know how to act.

1109
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:27,236
How was it?

1110
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:28,671
I think it is better
if we sing him a song.

1111
01:19:28,843 --> 01:19:30,208
Get up and sing.

1112
01:19:30,378 --> 01:19:31,936
Get up and work hard.

1113
01:19:38,787 --> 01:19:40,550
We should go now,
or else we will be arrested.

1114
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:45,751
We haven't finished yet.
Shouldn't we get paid?

1115
01:19:45,894 --> 01:19:47,953
Forget it. Let's go.

1116
01:19:52,233 --> 01:19:53,700
Be guiet. Look.

1117
01:19:54,335 --> 01:19:55,996
Why is everyone stopped there?

1118
01:20:05,513 --> 01:20:07,481
What is going on? What happened?

1119
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:10,310
When i took some medicine,

1120
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:13,912
a pretty girl suddenly appeared.

1121
01:20:14,155 --> 01:20:15,417
Actually, it was nothing.

1122
01:20:15,623 --> 01:20:18,888
Falafel was kidnapped.
And the money was robbed.

1123
01:20:19,761 --> 01:20:20,819
How did it happen?

1124
01:20:20,962 --> 01:20:22,623
A pretty girl wanted to hitch a ride.

1125
01:20:22,797 --> 01:20:24,560
Being nice guys, we stopped the car.

1126
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,531
- God knows...
- That is impossible.

1127
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:28,464
No one knows
where the money was kept.

1128
01:20:28,603 --> 01:20:30,662
Someone in this group
gave away the secret.

1129
01:20:31,139 --> 01:20:32,800
He is right. No one else knew

1130
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:35,000
there was so much cash involved,
except us.

1131
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:43,708
J.J.

1132
01:20:44,552 --> 01:20:48,318
You two better talk.

1133
01:20:48,523 --> 01:20:51,788
- How?
- Say it.

1134
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:54,592
J.J., this is simple.

1135
01:20:55,763 --> 01:20:59,927
We owe a casino for a small amount.

1136
01:21:00,869 --> 01:21:04,236
They were being cautious,
so they sent some collectors.

1137
01:21:05,907 --> 01:21:07,568
You told them the secret.

1138
01:21:08,343 --> 01:21:10,106
We didn't mean to.

1139
01:21:10,278 --> 01:21:11,643
Who are they?

1140
01:21:11,846 --> 01:21:14,508
They are friends
of the Godfather's son, Don Don.

1141
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:16,412
We have to find them
and discuss this.

1142
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:18,312
- That may work.
- It is not going to work.

1143
01:21:18,419 --> 01:21:19,181
Why?

1144
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:20,312
Because the Pinto Ranch
is heavily guarded.

1145
01:21:20,555 --> 01:21:22,716
It is not easy to get in.

1146
01:21:23,391 --> 01:21:25,655
They can't scare us if i am here.

1147
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:27,394
You, Captain Chaos, go in.

1148
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:30,462
And you will end up not coming out.

1149
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,927
What else can we do?

1150
01:21:33,034 --> 01:21:34,899
What is wrong?
Why are there so many people?

1151
01:21:35,637 --> 01:21:37,298
We have to rescue the Prince
as soon as we can.

1152
01:21:37,405 --> 01:21:38,565
He is probably fooling around
with some girls.

1153
01:21:38,673 --> 01:21:41,540
He is going to be drained.

1154
01:21:41,743 --> 01:21:44,906
I have a solution.
I can go to my old friend.

1155
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:48,146
He is a bad guy.

1156
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:52,408
It doesn't matter who he is
if he can help us.

1157
01:21:53,688 --> 01:21:55,155
He is waiting for you.

1158
01:22:09,003 --> 01:22:10,265
Sit here.

1159
01:22:12,674 --> 01:22:14,539
Every time you come here,
it is bad news.

1160
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:17,175
- You are bright.
- Right...

1161
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,545
All right, how much do you want?

1162
01:22:21,215 --> 01:22:23,979
We are not here
to ask you for money.

1163
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:27,514
We just need your help.

1164
01:22:27,989 --> 01:22:30,150
Who told you to sit down.
Stand up.

1165
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:34,025
Mr. Sinatra.

1166
01:22:34,195 --> 01:22:35,560
Call me Frank.

1167
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:37,324
I am really honoured.

1168
01:22:37,999 --> 01:22:41,366
Hold on.
Let me take a good look at you guys.

1169
01:22:41,469 --> 01:22:42,629
Don't try to be too cute with me.

1170
01:22:42,804 --> 01:22:43,771
How should i address you?

1171
01:22:43,938 --> 01:22:45,098
Call me, ''Sir''.

1172
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,803
- Call him, ''Sir''.
- I know.

1173
01:22:48,309 --> 01:22:51,574
Sir, we are Cannonball racers.

1174
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:54,247
- What?
- Cannonball car racers.

1175
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:58,113
We have something in common.

1176
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:01,083
I like car racing, too.

1177
01:23:02,924 --> 01:23:05,085
You are lucky
we have that in common.

1178
01:23:05,293 --> 01:23:06,055
Sir.

1179
01:23:06,294 --> 01:23:07,955
Sir, our race goes
from the west coast

1180
01:23:08,162 --> 01:23:09,527
to the east coast.

1181
01:23:09,631 --> 01:23:13,089
- During the race, Falafel...
- Falafel?

1182
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:15,166
Right, he is an Arab prince.

1183
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:17,133
I know a lot of Arab princes.

1184
01:23:17,238 --> 01:23:18,603
He could be your friend.

1185
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:22,005
Someone kidnapped him
and stole his million dollars.

1186
01:23:22,176 --> 01:23:23,643
That is why we are here
for your help.

1187
01:23:24,312 --> 01:23:26,177
You should go to the FBl.

1188
01:23:26,814 --> 01:23:28,873
You are better than the FBl.

1189
01:23:32,186 --> 01:23:33,653
All right, tell me what you want.

1190
01:23:33,855 --> 01:23:34,822
What is his background?

1191
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:37,157
He is the former Godfather's son.

1192
01:23:39,861 --> 01:23:41,021
I have an idea.

1193
01:23:41,763 --> 01:23:43,526
He's wanted to hire my performers
for a long time.

1194
01:23:43,665 --> 01:23:45,326
I can introduce you to him.

1195
01:23:48,803 --> 01:23:51,169
Anna, get me Don Don.

1196
01:23:54,876 --> 01:23:56,844
Frank introduced me
to other performers,

1197
01:23:57,011 --> 01:23:58,171
but they weren't very good.

1198
01:23:58,279 --> 01:23:59,337
Maybe not.

1199
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:01,813
I guarantee you,
these girls will surprise you.

1200
01:24:02,016 --> 01:24:04,576
Believe me. I am not bragging.

1201
01:24:04,752 --> 01:24:07,812
Really? Let me meet them.

1202
01:24:08,056 --> 01:24:09,523
Let's see the guality.

1203
01:24:44,525 --> 01:24:45,992
What is the matter?

1204
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,321
They are the ugliest group so far.

1205
01:24:49,063 --> 01:24:52,521
You can't define art
by its appearance.

1206
01:25:07,982 --> 01:25:09,643
They are not bad.

1207
01:25:40,148 --> 01:25:43,413
Frank knows his stuff.

1208
01:25:43,518 --> 01:25:46,078
He keeps the good ones to himself.

1209
01:25:51,592 --> 01:25:52,752
Thank you.

1210
01:26:01,636 --> 01:26:04,400
Great. You got the contract.

1211
01:26:04,505 --> 01:26:07,269
It is an irrevocable contract.

1212
01:26:07,441 --> 01:26:08,806
It will be extended to 1997.

1213
01:26:09,043 --> 01:26:11,511
Nothing will be changed.
Let's get changed.

1214
01:26:12,313 --> 01:26:13,780
Go...and get changed backstage.

1215
01:26:13,981 --> 01:26:16,643
But don't remove your make-up.

1216
01:26:16,784 --> 01:26:18,251
Do this favour for Frank.

1217
01:26:18,452 --> 01:26:19,919
Don't argue with him.

1218
01:26:25,593 --> 01:26:26,958
The bully is here.

1219
01:26:43,644 --> 01:26:47,011
We will pay you
after signing the contracts.

1220
01:26:47,148 --> 01:26:48,308
Great...

1221
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:51,311
Hey, what a pleasant surprise?

1222
01:26:57,158 --> 01:26:59,524
What surprise?

1223
01:27:01,596 --> 01:27:04,861
I told you I'd be here
to get my money.

1224
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:08,760
If you don't have the money,
you are dead.

1225
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:10,732
May l?

1226
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:14,303
On no...

1227
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:29,116
Are they here to help you?

1228
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:31,048
They are dancers.

1229
01:27:31,225 --> 01:27:34,194
Dancers?
Is the audience blind?

1230
01:27:34,595 --> 01:27:35,653
It is a joke.

1231
01:27:37,331 --> 01:27:38,992
How are you? Boss.

1232
01:27:41,168 --> 01:27:44,137
- Shouldn't you shave?
- We try to be fair to the guys.

1233
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:47,407
I take too many birth control pills.

1234
01:27:48,276 --> 01:27:51,939
You have to take them?
You could promote vasectomies.

1235
01:27:53,581 --> 01:27:55,344
I am Laverne.

1236
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:04,248
- Keep an eye on them.
- All right.

1237
01:28:06,427 --> 01:28:09,590
Dumb-Dumb,
do you have the money?

1238
01:28:11,933 --> 01:28:13,594
I have a million in cash.

1239
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:17,627
I have some guys getting the rest.

1240
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,305
This is just the interest.

1241
01:28:20,474 --> 01:28:22,533
When are you going to pay
the remaining balance?

1242
01:28:24,312 --> 01:28:26,576
All right, i will wait one more day.

1243
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:30,740
If you don't have it by then,
dig yourself a grave.

1244
01:28:33,254 --> 01:28:35,415
Bye, everyone.

1245
01:28:35,656 --> 01:28:37,419
Come again.

1246
01:28:39,794 --> 01:28:42,558
Where is the ladies' washroom?

1247
01:28:42,663 --> 01:28:46,030
- Upstairs and to the left.
- To the left.

1248
01:28:47,201 --> 01:28:50,466
In the contract, you have to dance
and do the janitorial work.

1249
01:28:55,242 --> 01:28:56,504
- Stick out your chest.
- Yes.

1250
01:29:00,781 --> 01:29:01,941
Mr. Hahn.

1251
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:04,509
Don't let those girls
get too close to me.

1252
01:29:07,088 --> 01:29:10,148
We would like
some show business advice.

1253
01:29:10,658 --> 01:29:13,525
My advice to you is,
get out of show business.

1254
01:29:14,061 --> 01:29:15,028
Hit them!

1255
01:29:18,265 --> 01:29:21,234
Get the money. Go that way.

1256
01:29:21,635 --> 01:29:23,296
Let's hide...

1257
01:29:35,549 --> 01:29:37,312
- We got the money.
- Let's run.

1258
01:29:37,451 --> 01:29:39,316
This way...

1259
01:29:39,487 --> 01:29:40,954
- We have to rescue the Prince.
- All right.

1260
01:29:41,055 --> 01:29:42,613
Hurry up.

1261
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,528
Excuse me. How are you?

1262
01:29:48,729 --> 01:29:51,493
Can you get my luggage for me?

1263
01:29:54,402 --> 01:29:58,065
- That girl is so ugly.
- She is as skinny as a skeleton.

1264
01:30:04,545 --> 01:30:07,514
- I can't hold this anymore...
- We can't get in. It is locked.

1265
01:30:10,251 --> 01:30:12,014
1, 2, 3.

1266
01:30:14,488 --> 01:30:16,649
What is happening? More women?

1267
01:30:16,824 --> 01:30:18,883
You will have to wait.

1268
01:30:19,026 --> 01:30:21,790
There is only so much water
in the fountain.

1269
01:30:21,962 --> 01:30:24,931
- We are not girls.
- We are men.

1270
01:30:25,699 --> 01:30:27,963
Men? I am not interested in men.

1271
01:30:28,102 --> 01:30:29,967
If i do this, i can't face Allah.

1272
01:30:30,271 --> 01:30:32,739
Prince, we're here to rescue you.
Let's run.

1273
01:30:32,873 --> 01:30:34,238
- I don't want to go.
- Come on.

1274
01:30:35,009 --> 01:30:36,874
This is interesting.
It is a swing.

1275
01:30:37,111 --> 01:30:39,875
I want to bring this home.
It is fantastic.

1276
01:30:40,081 --> 01:30:42,140
Don't bother. Come.
Help me up.

1277
01:30:43,717 --> 01:30:45,184
I am sorry. Mr. Hahn.

1278
01:30:45,352 --> 01:30:48,913
I warned you.
If those girls took the money,

1279
01:30:49,056 --> 01:30:53,823
- you are dead.
- Please don't.

1280
01:30:54,161 --> 01:30:55,628
I will teach you a lesson.

1281
01:30:55,763 --> 01:30:59,324
He will stab you a few times.
And he will stab you a few times.

1282
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:00,932
Then he will stab you a few times.

1283
01:31:01,068 --> 01:31:02,831
Don't you worry.

1284
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,335
They can't leave.

1285
01:31:04,472 --> 01:31:07,839
The Pinto Ranch has so many girls.

1286
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:13,206
None of them can run away.

1287
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:16,080
Hurry up...

1288
01:31:16,584 --> 01:31:20,042
- Where are you taking me?
- Open the door.

1289
01:31:20,187 --> 01:31:22,553
- Don't you have the car keys?
- I don't know.

1290
01:31:22,857 --> 01:31:25,325
- You are useless.
- Don't move.

1291
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:33,095
The show is over.

1292
01:31:42,209 --> 01:31:44,370
Shield me from any bullets.

1293
01:31:47,748 --> 01:31:53,015
It's your turn to play,
any way you like.

1294
01:31:53,154 --> 01:31:55,520
You heard him. Any way you like.

1295
01:31:55,689 --> 01:31:57,452
We will kill them,

1296
01:31:57,558 --> 01:31:59,116
so that there is no evidence.

1297
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:00,820
Kill them?

1298
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:06,700
J.J., there is no way out.
What do we do?

1299
01:32:06,767 --> 01:32:07,825
Be calm.

1300
01:32:08,469 --> 01:32:09,936
We are in trouble.

1301
01:32:29,323 --> 01:32:30,881
Give me back my money.

1302
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:34,088
Money? He is got the money.

1303
01:32:34,428 --> 01:32:35,690
Now he has the money.

1304
01:32:37,831 --> 01:32:38,991
J.J.

1305
01:32:44,805 --> 01:32:47,865
As is customary,
any last reguests?

1306
01:32:49,643 --> 01:32:50,507
Right.

1307
01:32:52,913 --> 01:32:54,175
You are so generous?

1308
01:32:54,281 --> 01:32:56,442
My wish will make you go bankrupt.

1309
01:32:56,517 --> 01:32:58,678
I just want to have a crazy party.

1310
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:02,521
I want a guiet place to figure out
the lottery numbers.

1311
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:06,651
I...I don't know yet...
let me think about it.

1312
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:11,820
I want to eat expensive seafood
and drink wine.

1313
01:33:13,067 --> 01:33:13,931
What about you?

1314
01:33:14,435 --> 01:33:15,595
Do you have a menu?

1315
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:20,129
I do. I will send you one in hell.

1316
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:41,261
Our rescuers are here!

1317
01:33:50,004 --> 01:33:51,471
This ranch is not bad.

1318
01:33:58,078 --> 01:33:59,136
Hi there!

1319
01:34:05,753 --> 01:34:09,211
- Come on.
- I am tough.

1320
01:34:18,132 --> 01:34:19,793
I am tough.

1321
01:34:24,538 --> 01:34:28,406
Hey...can i have a look?

1322
01:34:28,509 --> 01:34:31,478
- No problem.
- It is small, but it is nice.

1323
01:34:33,981 --> 01:34:35,243
That one is escaping.

1324
01:34:37,551 --> 01:34:38,415
I will go after him.

1325
01:34:38,552 --> 01:34:41,020
You go and catch him.
We will take care of you.

1326
01:34:41,155 --> 01:34:43,020
Don't worry. I will be back soon.

1327
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:53,867
What happened to you?
You are not good in this.

1328
01:34:54,368 --> 01:34:56,131
- Let me do it.
- Go ahead.

1329
01:35:01,475 --> 01:35:02,840
That guy will be miserable.

1330
01:35:18,892 --> 01:35:20,052
You are full of energy.

1331
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,921
Of course.
It is an Olympic year.

1332
01:35:22,096 --> 01:35:23,757
- Is that right?
- I am an athlete.

1333
01:35:25,366 --> 01:35:26,731
Don't get injured.

1334
01:35:27,134 --> 01:35:29,602
- Sisters, it is dangerous.
- I will protect you.

1335
01:35:30,704 --> 01:35:32,569
5, 6, 7.

1336
01:35:34,274 --> 01:35:35,036
Next.

1337
01:35:39,947 --> 01:35:41,608
Do you have some good ones
to show me?

1338
01:35:41,782 --> 01:35:44,250
The craftsmanship is wonderful.
Where did you get it?

1339
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:45,918
It is a gift from my cousin.

1340
01:35:47,221 --> 01:35:50,384
Good. That is enough. Forget it.

1341
01:35:51,558 --> 01:35:53,526
- A thousand thanks.
- Bless you, my son.

1342
01:35:57,030 --> 01:36:06,701
This way...you will know my power...

1343
01:36:17,284 --> 01:36:19,445
- You are smart.
- Of course.

1344
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:28,019
We owe you $30,000.
This will pay off the debt.

1345
01:36:29,263 --> 01:36:33,927
Good. Let's have a drink. Waiter...

1346
01:36:34,134 --> 01:36:36,193
They are busy now.
They don't have time.

1347
01:36:40,974 --> 01:36:42,339
I am having so much fun.

1348
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:47,280
- Handle them.
- No problem.

1349
01:36:48,415 --> 01:36:51,976
Captain Chaos is here.
Don't you worry.

1350
01:36:52,085 --> 01:36:53,848
Here comes Captain Chaos.

1351
01:36:55,489 --> 01:36:57,354
Up in the sky.

1352
01:36:58,959 --> 01:37:01,723
Thank goodness i am in shape.
Go ahead.

1353
01:37:02,396 --> 01:37:05,160
Is anyone injured?
Do you need any help?

1354
01:37:05,265 --> 01:37:06,425
Give him a shot.

1355
01:37:06,633 --> 01:37:08,396
It is a piece of cake.

1356
01:37:09,136 --> 01:37:14,199
Watch me.
One shot will fix everything.

1357
01:37:21,849 --> 01:37:24,317
Jackie, i am J.J.
We are from the same group.

1358
01:37:32,092 --> 01:37:33,559
- Let's split up.
- Yes.

1359
01:37:37,831 --> 01:37:38,991
Hi there.

1360
01:37:42,603 --> 01:37:44,468
- It is Superman.
- He is on a trampoline.

1361
01:37:54,748 --> 01:37:57,114
Can you hold this for me?

1362
01:37:57,184 --> 01:38:01,052
Let me look at this.
The more i look, the more i like it.

1363
01:38:05,492 --> 01:38:06,754
I am finished.

1364
01:38:07,494 --> 01:38:08,961
Take that...

1365
01:38:09,162 --> 01:38:13,929
Don't move...stop it.

1366
01:38:15,068 --> 01:38:16,035
Look.

1367
01:38:17,437 --> 01:38:18,802
It is a miracle.

1368
01:38:18,972 --> 01:38:22,430
- No.
- No. it is us.

1369
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:26,676
- J.J.
- Captain Chaos.

1370
01:38:27,748 --> 01:38:29,010
You are my girl.

1371
01:38:29,917 --> 01:38:33,080
- This time i needed your help.
- No problem.

1372
01:38:34,021 --> 01:38:36,683
We are here for you.

1373
01:38:37,324 --> 01:38:38,689
- Did you miss us?
- A bit.

1374
01:38:38,859 --> 01:38:40,019
This much.

1375
01:38:41,028 --> 01:38:42,689
A bit more.

1376
01:38:42,829 --> 01:38:44,694
- A bit more?
- All right.

1377
01:38:46,066 --> 01:38:48,125
My dear. How lovely!

1378
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:51,135
Fenderbaum.

1379
01:38:53,907 --> 01:38:56,068
- Couple to couple.
- Wait a minute.

1380
01:38:59,513 --> 01:39:03,074
Fenderbaum,
don't mess with my partner.

1381
01:39:03,584 --> 01:39:05,449
- Your partner?
- Partner?...

1382
01:39:05,586 --> 01:39:09,147
Right. I bought the ranch.

1383
01:39:09,556 --> 01:39:10,523
Right.

1384
01:39:12,693 --> 01:39:15,856
It was worth it. I like this.

1385
01:39:16,697 --> 01:39:19,257
I can't live without women.

1386
01:39:21,168 --> 01:39:24,035
You got away with it this time.
You idiot.

1387
01:39:24,237 --> 01:39:26,797
Does this guy know
you owe a lot of money?

1388
01:39:27,507 --> 01:39:29,771
It doesn't help if you yell at me.
Stingy.

1389
01:39:31,545 --> 01:39:33,103
- Prince.
- My partner.

1390
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:36,947
Prince, i need money to buy women.

1391
01:39:37,851 --> 01:39:38,818
How much?

1392
01:39:40,887 --> 01:39:42,354
$9,000,000.

1393
01:39:42,556 --> 01:39:45,923
$9,000,000?
It's such a small amount.

1394
01:39:46,526 --> 01:39:47,788
I will give you $18,000,000.

1395
01:39:47,928 --> 01:39:49,896
Get some high guality girls.

1396
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:52,291
Thank you.
Why are you leaving so soon?

1397
01:39:52,866 --> 01:39:54,527
I have a race to finish.

1398
01:39:55,302 --> 01:39:57,463
Since everyone is here,

1399
01:39:57,671 --> 01:39:59,832
in order to celebrate,

1400
01:40:00,007 --> 01:40:01,372
I'd like to announce that the prize

1401
01:40:01,508 --> 01:40:04,773
has been increased to $2,000,000.

1402
01:40:04,845 --> 01:40:06,710
Great...

1403
01:40:06,813 --> 01:40:09,179
- How many houses can that buy?
- I don't know.

1404
01:40:09,282 --> 01:40:10,544
$2,000,000.

1405
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:12,915
If we win, we'll split it 3 ways.
Good...

1406
01:40:13,086 --> 01:40:15,350
Get into the car, dear.
Get into the car.

1407
01:40:16,323 --> 01:40:18,188
Get into the car...

1408
01:40:24,531 --> 01:40:26,192
Fenderbaum, Blake, come here.

1409
01:40:27,467 --> 01:40:29,332
Sir, we are going to race.

1410
01:40:29,536 --> 01:40:32,903
I know. I'll be faster than you.
See you at the finish line.

1411
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:32,495
Jackie, you are an average player.

1412
01:41:32,632 --> 01:41:34,691
Don't embarrass yourself next time.

1413
01:42:04,197 --> 01:42:08,065
Your pulse is irregular.
How am i going to cure you?

1414
01:42:08,168 --> 01:42:09,931
Shut up...you are bothering me.

1415
01:42:10,103 --> 01:42:13,561
Just keep me in shape until the end.

1416
01:42:22,649 --> 01:42:24,412
The Prince is going to fail again.

1417
01:42:25,786 --> 01:42:29,847
We are going to win.
We will get a million dollars.

1418
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:31,953
Each one gets a million.

1419
01:42:38,765 --> 01:42:40,130
It is Frank.

1420
01:42:41,434 --> 01:42:42,799
He is driving really fast.

1421
01:42:43,003 --> 01:42:46,564
We have to be faster than him.
Go ahead.

1422
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:48,305
We are at the limit.

1423
01:42:48,875 --> 01:42:51,343
We want to talk business with you.
It is me.

1424
01:42:51,545 --> 01:42:53,410
We are old pals.

1425
01:42:53,547 --> 01:42:57,608
No matter who wins,
we will split it in half.

1426
01:42:59,085 --> 01:43:00,848
You get 70 percent.
We get 30 percent.

1427
01:43:02,122 --> 01:43:03,987
What about 10 percent?

1428
01:43:05,759 --> 01:43:06,919
I won't care.

1429
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:33,117
No need to rush.
The champion arrived 4 hours ago.

1430
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:34,687
Get a drink and take a rest.

1431
01:43:34,821 --> 01:43:37,187
The race continues tomorrow.
That is it.

1432
01:43:38,792 --> 01:43:40,157
Who won? I have to take a look.

1433
01:43:41,528 --> 01:43:44,497
We can't lose the race tomorrow.

1434
01:43:44,931 --> 01:43:48,594
Relax. We didn't forget about you.

1435
01:43:48,902 --> 01:43:51,769
You lost the Cannonball Run again.

1436
01:43:51,938 --> 01:43:54,099
You really make me mad.

1437
01:43:54,274 --> 01:43:57,038
Father, the doctor gave me
the wrong shot.

1438
01:43:57,210 --> 01:43:58,472
That is why i lost.

1439
01:43:58,578 --> 01:44:01,240
I am warning you.
If you don't win tomorrow,

1440
01:44:01,381 --> 01:44:05,044
you will never drive again.
You will be riding camels.

1441
01:44:05,218 --> 01:44:07,686
Father, don't get mad.
I will win tomorrow.

1442
01:44:08,154 --> 01:44:10,918
Because i invited today's champion
to be my partner.

1443
01:44:11,024 --> 01:44:13,185
This will work perfectly.

1444
01:44:13,426 --> 01:44:17,385
He is just like you.
He admires you, too.

1445
01:44:17,731 --> 01:44:18,891
Let's meet him.

1446
01:44:21,468 --> 01:44:25,131
Let me introduce you.
Father, here is today's champion.

1447
