00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:04,583
<i>I never imagined myself</i>

3
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:07,921
<i>as someone suited to a life
of incarceration.</i>

4
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:10,958
<i>As a boy, I was afraid
of confined spaces.</i>

5
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:13,093
<i>I feared elevators.</i>

6
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:15,896
<i>When I was old enough, I just
wanted to get in the car,</i>

7
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,731
<i>roll the windows
and drive, drive...</i>

8
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,635
<i>drive wherever my eyes
would take me.</i>

9
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:24,637
<i>I was an American kid.</i>

10
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,507
<i>Confinement of any kind
was terrifying to me.</i>

11
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,011
<i>So, to my surprise,
having been sentenced</i>

12
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:34,114
<i>to ten years in prison,</i>

13
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:36,749
<i>I found I adjusted quite well.</i>

14
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:48,561
Section Seven,
full lockdown, 800 hours.

15
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,711
<i>I liked the routine.</i>

16
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:07,580
<i>I liked the regimen.</i>

17
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:11,018
<i>Same activities,
same time, every day.</i>

18
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,820
<i>The same toothbrush,
the same clothes, same toilet.</i>

19
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:18,557
<i>Same stale sweat, stale smoke,</i>

20
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:21,928
<i>stale bodies,
stale cooking, stale farts.</i>

21
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:23,930
<i>Same conversations.</i>

22
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,999
<i>The faces change but not much.</i>

23
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,633
<i>No choice.</i>

24
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,602
<i>I found that I liked
reading books.</i>

25
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:32,906
<i>I'd never read a book before...
not all the way through.</i>

26
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:38,811
<i>I found a life for myself that
had been beyond my imagination.</i>

27
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:44,084
<i>It was in prison
I learned to count cards.</i>

28
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,591
<i>What separates blackjack
from other games</i>

29
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,162
<i>is that it's based on
dependent events,</i>

30
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:58,999
<i>meaning past affects
the probability in the future.</i>

31
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:01,968
<i>The house has a 1.5% advantage.</i>

32
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:05,704
<i>If a player knows the nature
of the cards in the shoe,</i>

33
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:07,974
<i>he can turn the house advantage
to himself.</i>

34
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,677
<i>To do this, he has to</i>

35
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,779
<i>keep track of every card
that is played.</i>

36
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:17,117
<i>Count is based on
a high/low system.</i>

37
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,853
<i>High cards...
ten, jack, queen, king...</i>

38
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,922
<i>have a value of minus-one.</i>

39
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:25,892
<i>If they are depleted,
player's advantage goes down.</i>

40
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,695
<i>The low cards...
two, three, four, five, six...</i>

41
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,764
<i>have a value of plus-one.</i>

42
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,838
<i>The seven, eight and nine
have no count value.</i>

43
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:39,705
<i>The player keeps track
of every card</i>

44
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,209
<i>and calculates
the running count.</i>

45
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:44,244
<i>Then the player arrives
at the true count,</i>

46
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:47,114
<i>which is the running count
divided by the decks remaining.</i>

47
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:49,216
<i>For example, if the
running count is plus-nine</i>

48
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,784
<i>and there are four and a half
decks remaining,</i>

49
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:55,021
<i>nine over four and a half gives
you a true count of plus-two.</i>

50
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:57,991
<i>As true count increases,</i>

51
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:00,127
<i>the player's advantage
increases.</i>

52
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,997
<i>The idea is to bet little when
you don't have the advantage,</i>

53
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,166
<i>more when you do.</i>

54
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:12,172
Well, that's about
enough for me.

55
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:15,708
- Hey, man, good to see you.
- Good playing with you.

56
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,045
Again.

57
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:21,982
How we doing?

58
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,919
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

59
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,291
And would you like large bills?

60
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:33,059
Yes, please.

61
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:38,031
That's one, two, three,
four, five, six,

62
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:40,133
seven and 50.

63
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,068
- That's $750.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:44,471
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

65
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,963
Good day.

66
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:44,898
Good day to you, sir.

67
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:48,101
I'd like a...
single, one night.

68
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:50,070
I'll pay now. I have cash.

69
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:52,738
- $56.
- All right.

70
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,244
Checkout's at noon.

71
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:59,346
Sign here.

72
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,047
Would you like some coffee?

73
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:02,983
How old is it?

74
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:05,151
I made it this morning.

75
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:07,187
I'm fine.

76
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:09,556
- Room 101.
- Thank you.

77
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:11,258
Mm-hmm.

78
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:54,120
Mr. B.

79
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:55,722
- Long time, no see.
- Hey.

80
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:57,424
- Not so long, Slippery Joe.
- How you been?

81
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:59,025
No, they don't call me that
no more.

82
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,260
- Yeah?
- What are they calling you?

83
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:01,494
Do you have a suggestion?

84
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:03,163
You here for
the poker tournament?

85
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:04,964
Yeah. I like grand openings.

86
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:06,166
Reopenings. You know,
I don't know why they bother.

87
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,434
Well, they're working
things out.

88
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,068
Mistakes get made.
It always happens.

89
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:11,037
They got a new
high-stakes pai gow room.

90
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,439
Yeah, house odds 11%.

91
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:14,307
Yeah, and plenty of suckers.

92
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,376
I don't know. Those Asian
gamblers are pretty crafty.

93
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,578
No, you j-just seem to think
of them that way, you know.

94
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:20,180
What-what are you gonna play?

95
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:21,581
I'm gonna play
a little blackjack.

96
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,316
Oh, you know, there's some
great guys down here.

97
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:25,318
- Downtown Brown...
- Ah, I-I've met enough people.

98
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,188
No, you've got to meet 'em, man.
So, anyway, so...

99
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:30,457
All right, you know what?
Let's just go to Washa Casino.

100
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,158
It's 15 minutes away.

101
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:33,426
We can sit in on the poker game.

102
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,094
Ah, Slippery.

103
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:36,763
Come on, Mr. B.

104
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,465
We're going. We're going.

105
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:40,366
You know what?

106
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,469
This has been dead to me.

107
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,437
You can...

108
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:46,339
Kansas City's been
a bust for me anyway.

109
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:49,108
- It's like, ever since I...
- Never played Kansas City.

110
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:56,216
Washa Casino... where'd they get
a name like that?

111
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,184
It's indigenous.

112
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:01,187
Hmm.

113
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:03,389
Well, where's all
the Indian shit?

114
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:05,358
Jackpot.

115
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:12,098
Shit.

116
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:16,102
Shit!

117
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,137
They're down to the final table.

118
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:22,275
Mm.

119
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,213
World fucking tournament.

120
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:29,215
Kiss my balls.

121
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,050
What's your problem, Slip?

122
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:32,552
I ain't got no problem.

123
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:35,321
USA! USA!

124
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:38,391
Look at this asshole, Mr. USA.

125
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,126
It's working for him.

126
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,095
Yeah, and he's working it
for all it's worth.

127
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,397
He was born in the Ukraine.

128
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,266
You know he's got
his own website?

129
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,501
I came all the way out here
for this shit.

130
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:54,140
Where you on to next?

131
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,176
Uh, there's a law enforcement
convention in Atlantic City.

132
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,212
- GSC.
- Hmm.

133
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:00,848
Yeah, cops are always good.

134
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:02,348
They get a few drinks in 'em,

135
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:03,616
they think nobody
can touch 'em.

136
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,285
Shit.
I ever tell you about

137
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,586
my brother Bobby
from Pascagoula?

138
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,588
State trooper.

139
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:11,558
- USA! USA!
- USA!

140
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:14,527
<i>The man never saw
a day of service.</i>

141
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:17,096
<i>I'd like to run that
red, white and blue flag</i>

142
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,499
<i>straight through his mouth
and out his asshole.</i>

143
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:22,201
But you just told
the story of his life.

144
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:26,706
USA! USA! USA! USA!

145
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,374
That's it, baby.

146
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:38,318
May I join you?

147
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:39,586
Be our guest.

148
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,187
I recognize you.

149
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,156
- We've played before.
- Yeah.

150
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:45,425
You know, I'm gonna let you two
just... youngsters be.

151
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,226
I'm gonna go play some dice.

152
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,595
All right.

153
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:51,431
- Three times.
- No, four times.

154
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:53,132
Horseshoe Baltimore,

155
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,468
Caesars Atlantic City, Foxwoods

156
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:58,137
- and Harrah's Philly.
- That's right.

157
00:12:58,171 --> 00:13:00,473
You binked a gutshot straight
at Foxwoods.

158
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,141
No explaining luck.

159
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:03,343
Linda, right?

160
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:04,912
La Linda.

161
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:06,914
LL, like "Lucky Lady."

162
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:08,214
Ah, okay.

163
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,282
I've watched you play.

164
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:10,416
You count cards, right?

165
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,751
I'm not that smart.

166
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:14,721
But you win,
so you count cards.

167
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:17,624
How do you avoid
getting backed off?

168
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,659
I've been backed off.

169
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:22,161
Yet here you are.

170
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,732
Yeah, well,
it's a matter of degree.

171
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:28,267
The house doesn't mind players
who count cards.

172
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:31,170
They don't even mind players
who count cards and win.

173
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:33,773
Oh, I'll have a Tom Collins
with Tanqueray.

174
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:36,342
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Soda water, please.

175
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:40,546
What they don't like are players
who count cards and win big.

176
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,449
It's about how much you win
and how you win it.

177
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:46,252
I stick to modest goals.

178
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,421
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

179
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,289
What's your name again?

180
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:52,158
William Tell.

181
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:54,694
I've watched you play poker,

182
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:56,763
and I wonder why you play
at such low stakes.

183
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,331
You're a crackerjack.

184
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:00,400
I keep to modest goals.

185
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:01,701
No, there's no reason for that.

186
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:04,437
You can get someone
to stake you... an MTT...

187
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,539
make seven million payout.

188
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:09,242
That's what you do...
you-you run a stable.

189
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,678
I'm always looking
for a good thoroughbred.

190
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,181
I can get someone
to back you 100%, on my word.

191
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:18,451
I prefer to work
under the radar.

192
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:21,187
I thought you were a gambler.

193
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:26,526
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

194
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,462
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

195
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,265
So, Bill...

196
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:34,267
you ever been to prison?

197
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,305
Why would you say that?

198
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,441
I can tell
when someone's been inside.

199
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:43,476
It's a gift I have.

200
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:49,215
Here's the problem
with a backer.

201
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,785
He puts up the money,
you split the winnings.

202
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:54,787
That's all good,
but if you lose,

203
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:57,256
you have to pay those losses
out of future winnings.

204
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,725
Right? That only makes sense.

205
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:01,728
And slowly, you build weight.

206
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:04,597
You go to any poker website,
look up the top ten winners...

207
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,468
millions in earnings...
50% of them are underwater.

208
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,838
Swamped in debt
they'll never repay.

209
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:14,373
If you don't play for money,
why do you play at all?

210
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:17,543
It passes the time.

211
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:21,247
So, Bill...

212
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:24,885
...why don't you pass
some time with me?

213
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:26,619
Let's play poker.

214
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,427
<i>In poker, the player does not</i>

215
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,762
<i>play against the house.</i>

216
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,764
<i>He plays against other players.</i>

217
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:40,299
<i>The house takes a cut.</i>

218
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,301
<i>Two things are necessary:</i>

219
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,670
<i>knowledge of
the mathematical odds,</i>

220
00:15:44,704 --> 00:15:47,573
<i>knowledge of your opponents.</i>

221
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,776
<i>Poker is all about waiting.</i>

222
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:52,645
<i>Hours pass. Days pass.</i>

223
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:54,680
<i>Hand after hand,</i>

224
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,783
<i>each hand like the hand before.</i>

225
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:06,325
<i>Then something happens.</i>

226
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:21,108
<i>There's a weight
a gambler can accrue</i>

227
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:23,877
<i>by accepting financial backing.</i>

228
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:26,914
<i>It's like any weight
a person in debt accrues.</i>

229
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:31,450
<i>It builds and builds,
has a life of its own.</i>

230
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:35,588
<i>There also is a moral weight
a man can accrue.</i>

231
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:41,561
<i>This is the weight created
by his past actions.</i>

232
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,765
<i>It is a weight...</i>

233
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,569
<i>...which can never be removed.</i>

234
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,600
Your attention, please.

235
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,602
The Correctional Officers
Association mixer

236
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:25,005
- has been moved...
- Nice playing with you.

237
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,508
Welcome, sir.

238
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,700
Polygraphs have
historically been

239
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,836
the problem child
of investigation

240
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,005
in law enforcement.

241
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:07,573
This may soon change.

242
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,675
Vocat Electronics has developed

243
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:13,981
a 22-point facial recognition
software...

244
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,718
...that uses
a proprietary algorithm

245
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,922
to interact with CQT detection.

246
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:24,992
This software, called STABL,

247
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:27,593
is in the beta testing phase.

248
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:31,697
Vocat will soon be offering
a test version of this software

249
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:33,900
to qualified law enforcement

250
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:37,770
and public incarceration
agencies.

251
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,741
Vocat makes no great claims

252
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:46,079
but thinks this advance
of potential truth detection

253
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,781
needs some field experience.

254
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,549
How reliable is it?

255
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,618
How does it work?

256
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,055
That's what I want
to get into now.

257
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:58,824
I prepared this
PowerPoint demonstration

258
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,827
with a volunteer from the
Milwaukee Police Department...

259
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:02,628
Do you remember him?

260
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,898
...misclassifying innocent
subjects, false positives.

261
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:06,766
This is my number.

262
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,634
I'm staying at this hotel.

263
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,003
Cumulative research evidence
suggests

264
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:15,008
that CQT detects deception
better than chance

265
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:18,512
but with significant
error rates.

266
00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:22,949
<i>The smartest bet for a novice</i>

267
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:25,185
<i>is red/black in roulette.</i>

268
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:27,720
<i>Your odds are 47.4%.</i>

269
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:29,655
No more bets.

270
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:32,159
<i>You win, you walk away.</i>

271
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:34,995
<i>You lose, you walk away.</i>

272
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,596
<i>It's the only smart casino bet.</i>

273
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,900
14, red.

274
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:45,999
No!

275
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:47,834
Where's my shoe?

276
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:50,137
Hey! Get the fuck back!

277
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,272
Where's my shoe, guys?

278
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,174
Shoe!

279
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,745
Get the fuck back!

280
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,882
Now!

281
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:03,884
Get up!

282
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:09,142
Hi.

283
00:24:09,175 --> 00:24:11,177
Johnnie Walker, double, neat.

284
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:13,313
- Please.
- You got it.

285
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:21,820
Hello.

286
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:23,256
Yeah, you gave me
a piece of paper

287
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,359
with your number on it
earlier tonight.

288
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:28,194
You awake?

289
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:31,431
I'm here. I'm at the bar.

290
00:24:31,464 --> 00:24:33,799
The one by the elevators.

291
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:37,070
I'll wait.

292
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:50,250
You want a drink?

293
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:53,219
Yeah, I'll have one of those.

294
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:54,988
Another. The same.

295
00:24:55,021 --> 00:24:56,923
Sure.

296
00:24:56,956 --> 00:24:58,391
Let's sit.

297
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:12,238
So, what was that all about?

298
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:16,843
What?

299
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:21,414
You giving me a piece of paper
with your name and number on it.

300
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:24,284
You remember Major John Gordo?

301
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,154
Of course,
he's not a major anymore.

302
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:30,123
He just uses that title.

303
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:33,259
What are you talking about?

304
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,262
PFC William Tillich.

305
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:38,164
Isn't that your name?

306
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:40,667
I've done my research.

307
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,902
I know your case.

308
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:47,941
Thank you.

309
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,445
- Who are you?
- Cirk Baufort.

310
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,147
Cirk with a "C."

311
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,383
My father was Roger Baufort.

312
00:25:56,416 --> 00:26:00,153
Gordo trained my father in the
arts of enhanced interrogation.

313
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:04,391
Roger Baufort?
That name doesn't ring a bell.

314
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:06,493
Gordo was at Abu Ghraib.

315
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:08,995
As a private contractor.

316
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:11,998
My father, he visited him there.

317
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:14,134
Is this story going anywhere?

318
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,002
The beauty of his scheme
was that Gordo,

319
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:18,104
once he became
a private contractor,

320
00:26:18,138 --> 00:26:21,307
he couldn't be prosecuted for
crimes not on American soil.

321
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:23,309
But my father...

322
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:25,278
wasn't so lucky.

323
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:29,282
He was dishonorably discharged,
got addicted to oxycodone.

324
00:26:29,315 --> 00:26:31,317
He'd been injured.
He drank heavily.

325
00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:34,287
He beat my mother.
He beat me.

326
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,423
My mother left one day
without saying a word.

327
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:38,525
Without a suitcase. Just...

328
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:43,029
That left only me to beat.

329
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,099
Until he shot himself.

330
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:47,934
That was four years ago.

331
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:52,205
So I decided I'd just
get into it.

332
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:55,008
Investigate it for myself,
find out what really happened.

333
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,110
Set things straight.

334
00:26:57,143 --> 00:26:59,446
What does your mother say?

335
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:02,315
She made her choice.

336
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:04,451
Do you know where she is?

337
00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:06,286
No.

338
00:27:08,788 --> 00:27:11,224
And how am I involved in this?

339
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:13,493
Well, there were
a handful of soldiers

340
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:16,196
that were bad apples,
who were punished,

341
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:17,497
but those who are
really responsible

342
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,766
are still walking around
out there,

343
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,601
giving lectures at conventions,

344
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:23,503
getting honorary degrees.

345
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:25,472
The apples weren't bad.

346
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:27,540
The barrel they came from
was bad.

347
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:35,381
You know, when I recognized you
at John Gordo's seminar,

348
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:37,083
I recognized you instantly.

349
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:40,086
I thought to myself,

350
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:44,090
"Here's a man who might want
a piece of what I'm gonna do."

351
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:46,526
<i>This is how it starts.</i>

352
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,495
<i>Just a fleeting thought.</i>

353
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:50,363
<i>A daydream.</i>

354
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:52,365
<i>Then it builds...</i>

355
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:54,567
<i>and builds.</i>

356
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,536
And what is that?

357
00:27:57,637 --> 00:28:01,274
Capture him,
torture him and kill him.

358
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:04,110
They made you the fall guy.

359
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:06,446
They fucked you, PFC Tillich.

360
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,481
- My name is Tell.
- Whatever.

361
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:11,317
You were in the photos.
No one else was prosecuted.

362
00:28:11,351 --> 00:28:13,353
Just the soldiers in the photos.

363
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:15,088
They put you in hell.

364
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:16,623
Then they blamed you for it.

365
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:18,224
You got the barracks
at Leavenworth,

366
00:28:18,258 --> 00:28:19,826
and Gordo got R and R in Kuwait.

367
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,128
Cirk...

368
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,297
you need to back off.

369
00:28:26,432 --> 00:28:28,401
I've spent a lot of time
thinking

370
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:31,304
the exact same thoughts
you're thinking right now.

371
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:35,508
They eat you up.

372
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:41,047
Are you gonna tell on me?

373
00:28:42,582 --> 00:28:44,284
No.

374
00:28:44,317 --> 00:28:45,853
I'm not.

375
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:47,855
It's your life.

376
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:54,320
Cirk with a "C"?

377
00:29:55,722 --> 00:29:58,124
It's Bill Tell.

378
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:05,498
You want to ride with me?

379
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:07,367
I'm a card player.

380
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,570
I go from city to city,
casino to casino,

381
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:13,206
card room to card room.

382
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,508
It gets lonely.

383
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:18,378
I'd like some company.

384
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:20,446
I'll cover the costs.

385
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:44,404
Who is it?

386
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:46,272
Tell.

387
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:47,774
Bill.

388
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:51,544
Come on in.

389
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,564
You live like this?

390
00:31:11,597 --> 00:31:13,599
Well, I was packing.

391
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,806
All right. Let's get your shit
together, get on the road.

392
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,262
Turn it off.

393
00:31:43,296 --> 00:31:44,731
Ah, come on.

394
00:31:44,764 --> 00:31:46,365
Turn that shit off.

395
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:50,369
Who are you? God?

396
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,577
If you'd ever actually
been there,

397
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,513
you'd never want to hear
that shit again in your life.

398
00:32:05,618 --> 00:32:07,320
So, where are we going?

399
00:32:07,353 --> 00:32:08,755
You never told me.

400
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:11,357
You never asked.

401
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:15,428
There's a racino
at Delaware Park.

402
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:18,731
Delaware casinos are tied
into race tracks.

403
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:22,735
I'm not really into
playing cards.

404
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:26,506
Do you like sports?

405
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,075
Yeah.

406
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:30,810
Well, they have
a great sports book.

407
00:32:30,844 --> 00:32:33,379
Yeah, but that costs money.
I mean...

408
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,414
how much is it gonna cost me?

409
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:36,917
'Cause I can't really go around

410
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,519
spending my money like that
on sports betting.

411
00:32:39,552 --> 00:32:42,890
<i>Who is this insolent
little prick?</i>

412
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:46,492
I did play fantasy football

413
00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:48,795
with the guys a while back,
but...

414
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:50,730
I don't suppose that counts.

415
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:53,100
What about college?
What happened there?

416
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,568
It wasn't for me.

417
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,839
How much debt you got?

418
00:32:58,872 --> 00:33:00,807
Some.

419
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:04,744
A lot.

420
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:10,616
And you want to go back?

421
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:14,922
I got out of the mood.

422
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:17,423
Do you have any interests?

423
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,559
What do you mean?

424
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:21,794
Interests, like...

425
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:24,597
anything you want to do:
an occupation, a business.

426
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,701
I got interests.

427
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:36,409
<i>Sports betting is
a world unto itself.</i>

428
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:37,710
<i>There's a hundred games</i>

429
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:39,545
going on around the world
at any given moment.

430
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:40,948
That's a lot of information.

431
00:33:40,981 --> 00:33:42,850
But the algorithms here
at the house are faster

432
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:44,517
and better
and quicker than you,

433
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,853
so unless you have
inside information,

434
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:48,454
sports betting is just for fun.

435
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:49,990
Here's a couple hundred bucks.

436
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:52,926
You pick two teams,
place some bets, have some fun.

437
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,962
I'm gonna go play
some blackjack.

438
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:57,931
Here's walking-around money.

439
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:03,170
Just, uh, a second.

440
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:05,671
It's just a little damn noisy
out there.

441
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:07,707
Oh, that's a lot better.

442
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,742
Hey, La Linda, you there?

443
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:13,746
Uh, I'm at Delaware Raceway.

444
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:19,452
Electricians.

445
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:21,889
So, uh, I've been thinking
about what you were saying

446
00:34:21,922 --> 00:34:23,924
and having some second thoughts.

447
00:34:23,957 --> 00:34:25,758
I might be interested in, uh,

448
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:27,760
in what-what you were
talking about.

449
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:32,732
Yeah, I realize that.

450
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:35,002
I just think that we could take
the conversation to the...

451
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:37,004
the next step.

452
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,675
After this, back up to AC.

453
00:34:46,246 --> 00:34:47,813
Okay.

454
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,716
All right.

455
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:04,965
<i>Is there an end to punishment?</i>

456
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:07,633
<i>Is there a limit to
the amount of effort it takes</i>

457
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,535
<i>to merit expiation?</i>

458
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:13,974
<i>Is it possible to know
when one reaches the limit?</i>

459
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:06,293
Well, here she is.

460
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:08,095
Madam.

461
00:36:08,128 --> 00:36:10,596
Join us.

462
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:11,999
La Linda, I'd like
to introduce you

463
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:14,001
to the young man
formerly known as Cirk Baufort.

464
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:16,103
Now we just call him the Kid.

465
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:17,703
Yep. That's Cirk with a "C."

466
00:36:17,737 --> 00:36:18,939
- Yeah.
- Pleased to meet you, Kid.

467
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:20,841
King of sports book, the Kid is.

468
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:22,808
Yesterday, played two games,
hit 'em both on a double pop.

469
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,144
Oh. Give me some of your luck.

470
00:36:26,046 --> 00:36:27,848
Uh, La Linda and I just have
something we want to discuss.

471
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,016
- Maybe...
- Yeah.

472
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:30,583
I'll, uh,
give the slots a whirl.

473
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:32,651
All right.
Bet small, lose small.

474
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:36,890
He's a good kid.

475
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:39,960
What was this thing
you wanted to talk about?

476
00:36:39,993 --> 00:36:44,663
Uh, well, I may want
to build up a nest egg,

477
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:48,035
and, uh, to do that,
I need a backer.

478
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:50,137
Well, that's a dramatic turn.

479
00:36:51,371 --> 00:36:53,672
You woke something in me.

480
00:36:56,043 --> 00:36:57,878
I don't know.

481
00:36:57,911 --> 00:36:59,913
It's the Kid. He needs help.

482
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:01,915
And money will do that?

483
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:04,084
He's got debts.

484
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:06,786
So, where do we start?

485
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:09,122
Well, jump on one
of these WSOP tours.

486
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:11,690
They got an event every week.

487
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,759
And you'll come up fast
if you're willing to travel.

488
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:15,829
I am.

489
00:37:15,862 --> 00:37:17,831
We'll start
on the East Coast for now.

490
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:19,199
Tease 'em.

491
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,168
Vegas?

492
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:23,203
That's where the money is.

493
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:25,205
Do I have to meet the backer?

494
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:27,807
For some people,
it's an ego thing.

495
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:29,843
- Others don't care.
- Mm-hmm.

496
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,945
I'll find something
that suits you.

497
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:39,785
I build my nest egg, I bail.

498
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:42,956
One year max, then I'm out.

499
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:48,661
I wish I could believe that.

500
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:50,864
Believe.

501
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:57,803
I'm too old for this.

502
00:37:57,838 --> 00:37:59,873
- Mwah. Bye.
- Bye.

503
00:38:08,248 --> 00:38:11,184
The other day, you asked me,

504
00:38:11,218 --> 00:38:14,154
"What was the greatest hand
of poker ever played?"

505
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:18,992
And I can only speak
for what I have seen,

506
00:38:19,025 --> 00:38:21,727
and this...

507
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,131
is the best hand I ever saw.

508
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:27,934
2012, Indian casino in Iowa.

509
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:31,670
Blackbird Bend, Omaha Nation.

510
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:33,772
10K tournament.

511
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:36,843
Goldie... Asian player,
wore a lot of gold...

512
00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:39,045
and Alex Karesco,
WSOP champion.

513
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,881
You may have heard of him.

514
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:44,017
Alex has pocket queens,

515
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,286
clubs and diamonds.

516
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:49,856
Goldie has
eight, nine of diamonds.

517
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,859
How'd you do that?

518
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:54,094
Practice. I was in a place

519
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:56,129
where I had a lot of time
on my hands.

520
00:38:56,163 --> 00:38:57,696
Now the flop.

521
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,299
Ten of spades,

522
00:38:59,332 --> 00:39:01,835
jack of diamonds,
queen of hearts.

523
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,905
There's blood in the water.

524
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:08,175
Both players think
they're ahead.

525
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,844
It goes check, raise,

526
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:13,113
reraise, re-reraise,

527
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:14,915
call.

528
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:16,917
Alex and Goldie head-to-head.

529
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,952
Now the turn.

530
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:21,787
Ten of diamonds. Now...

531
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,191
there is only one card
that gets Goldie out.

532
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:25,892
There's a two percent chance

533
00:39:25,926 --> 00:39:27,826
the river will come
the seven of diamonds.

534
00:39:27,861 --> 00:39:30,330
Alex has a 98% chance of winning

535
00:39:30,363 --> 00:39:32,098
with queens full of tens.

536
00:39:32,132 --> 00:39:34,067
Goldie looks at the damage.

537
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,203
He doesn't even have
a pot-sized bet left behind.

538
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:39,906
Makes this little sucking sound
that the Japanese do.

539
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:44,110
Then he goes all in.

540
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:46,012
Alex calls.

541
00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:47,981
Now the river.

542
00:39:49,815 --> 00:39:51,750
Seven of diamonds.

543
00:39:51,784 --> 00:39:54,287
Straight flush beats
a full house. Goldie wins.

544
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:55,989
You saw that game?

545
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:57,857
Haven't been to Iowa since.

546
00:39:57,891 --> 00:39:59,960
Could you top us off, please?

547
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,937
So this, um...

548
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:15,942
...this plan you have

549
00:40:15,976 --> 00:40:18,144
about Major John Gordo...

550
00:40:18,178 --> 00:40:20,280
you given it more thought?

551
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,116
He's all nails.

552
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:25,185
You're not.

553
00:40:25,218 --> 00:40:27,320
He's right out of fucking
<i>Call of Duty.</i>

554
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:31,757
How you gonna do that?

555
00:40:32,892 --> 00:40:34,828
Well...

556
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:36,963
there would need to be
a tranquilizer.

557
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:39,866
Ketamine, combined with Telazol.

558
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:42,235
It can be administered
by a dart pistol.

559
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:45,171
Where'd you find out about this?

560
00:40:45,205 --> 00:40:47,274
- The Internet.
- And you have it?

561
00:40:47,307 --> 00:40:49,009
Just the ketamine.

562
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,077
But it's amazing how easy
the stuff is to get.

563
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:52,879
I mean, I ordered it on a lark.

564
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:54,314
Three days later, it arrived.

565
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:57,884
This isn't
very well thought out.

566
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:01,921
And that's why I need a partner.

567
00:41:01,955 --> 00:41:05,892
Somebody with experience,
somebody with expertise.

568
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:07,927
And motive.

569
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:09,829
A strong guy.

570
00:41:09,863 --> 00:41:11,398
A guy like you.

571
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:17,237
Let's...

572
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:21,074
roll back your scenario
for a moment.

573
00:41:21,107 --> 00:41:23,610
You've located John Gordo.

574
00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:26,046
You shot him with a dart.

575
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,947
He's gaga.

576
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:29,949
What next?

577
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:35,355
Strip him naked.

578
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:38,058
Put a hood over his head.

579
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:41,027
One of those green
military sandbags.

580
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:43,229
You can find them on eBay.

581
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,066
Handcuff him.

582
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:48,868
Hang him from the ceiling,
keep him from sleeping.

583
00:41:50,136 --> 00:41:54,240
Make him try to jerk off
while I hit him in the legs.

584
00:41:56,443 --> 00:41:58,411
Did your father tell you
about this?

585
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:01,014
No, he never talked about it.

586
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:04,351
He kept it all inside.

587
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:06,319
He beat you.

588
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:08,922
That's in the past.

589
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:10,190
The body remembers.

590
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:12,192
It stores it all.

591
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:16,162
Do you want to hear about it?

592
00:42:16,196 --> 00:42:18,131
Would that interest you?

593
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:21,201
- What?
- You know what.

594
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,269
You're dying to hear.

595
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:36,116
The noise.

596
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:39,486
The smell.

597
00:42:41,054 --> 00:42:44,457
Feces, urine,

598
00:42:44,491 --> 00:42:47,293
oil, explosives,

599
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:50,964
bleach, sweat, smoke.

600
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:53,500
All day, every day.

601
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:55,502
Sand spiders, camel spiders,

602
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:58,071
ants as big as cockroaches.

603
00:42:58,104 --> 00:43:00,473
The heat, the fear,

604
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:03,009
the adrenaline jack, mortars.

605
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:04,477
The sheer noise of it.

606
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:07,113
And blood.

607
00:43:07,147 --> 00:43:10,350
And the only way to survive
was to rise above.

608
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:12,318
Rise and laugh.

609
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:15,021
Surf the craziness.

610
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:18,391
To see a grown man shit
and piss on himself.

611
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:21,261
Sing the song, man.

612
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:24,063
The noise, the fucking noise.

613
00:43:26,132 --> 00:43:28,001
The noise.

614
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:30,737
We were all just trapped
in there,

615
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:35,208
in the same shit,
sh-sh... shithole.

616
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,312
Them and us.

617
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:45,385
And am I trying to justify
what we did?

618
00:43:48,788 --> 00:43:50,457
No.

619
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,229
Nothing...

620
00:43:57,797 --> 00:44:01,100
Nothing can justify
what we did.

621
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,506
Your father understood that.

622
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:10,977
If you were there,
you could understand.

623
00:44:11,644 --> 00:44:15,081
Otherwise, there's no...

624
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:17,116
understanding.

625
00:44:49,115 --> 00:44:51,117
Minnesota?

626
00:44:55,355 --> 00:44:57,357
When was the last time?

627
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,192
Orlando?

628
00:44:59,225 --> 00:45:00,660
Oxford Downs. That's right.

629
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:02,562
- You were with Clickity Dick.
- USA! USA!

630
00:45:02,595 --> 00:45:04,664
I'd like to put a cap
in that motherfucker.

631
00:45:04,697 --> 00:45:07,166
Now, take it smooth, Minnie.

632
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,236
And exercise those legs.

633
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:15,608
They call him Minnesota Fats
after the movie.

634
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:17,510
You know, there's not
a lot of fat people

635
00:45:17,544 --> 00:45:19,512
that play
professional poker anymore.

636
00:45:19,546 --> 00:45:21,681
I like to call him
Charlie Two Chins.

637
00:45:21,714 --> 00:45:23,449
Why is that?

638
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:25,485
'Cause he got more chins
than a Chinese phone book.

639
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:27,420
Thanks for the straight line.

640
00:45:27,453 --> 00:45:29,322
Minnesota Fats played pool
in that movie.

641
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:31,357
- No, poker.
- No, that's Cincinnati Kid.

642
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:33,259
Oh, whatever.

643
00:45:42,302 --> 00:45:44,170
<i>The preferred poker variant</i>

644
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:47,473
<i>for multi-table tournaments
is no-limit Texas Hold'em.</i>

645
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:50,476
<i>It encourages large pots
and large raises.</i>

646
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,080
<i>The prize money is split
between the top five players.</i>

647
00:45:55,315 --> 00:45:57,116
<i>Before the hole cards are dealt,</i>

648
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,586
<i>the player to the left
of the button must post</i>

649
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:01,287
<i>small and big blinds.</i>

650
00:46:02,622 --> 00:46:06,392
<i>This stimulates action, and
the blinds go up every hour.</i>

651
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:15,168
<i>The rest of the cards
are common cards.</i>

652
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:20,607
<i>The flop, three cards.</i>

653
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:33,319
1,800.

654
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,469
<i>The turn.</i>

655
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:10,456
<i>And the river.</i>

656
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,526
<i>The river can instantly turn
a losing hand into a winner.</i>

657
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:16,262
<i>That's Hold'em's
betting appeal.</i>

658
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:17,563
All in.

659
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,331
What happened? You get bored?

660
00:47:52,365 --> 00:47:54,300
Played some slots.

661
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,469
You should read some books.

662
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:57,838
I'm gonna buy you one.

663
00:47:57,871 --> 00:47:59,605
I've read books.

664
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:01,274
What is it with her?

665
00:48:01,307 --> 00:48:02,642
- Name one.
- One what?

666
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:04,577
Book.

667
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,512
How 'bout <i>Poker for Dummies.</i>

668
00:48:06,546 --> 00:48:08,314
I believe you may have read it.

669
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:10,450
I like him.

670
00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:15,655
Wow. You made it
to the second dinner break.

671
00:48:15,688 --> 00:48:18,791
I must have fired
two dozen tournaments

672
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:21,461
before I lasted that long.

673
00:48:21,494 --> 00:48:23,831
So, how many are left?

674
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:26,766
Four tables,
so should be done tomorrow.

675
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:30,369
How much cards do you play?

676
00:48:33,406 --> 00:48:35,441
40 hands an hour,

677
00:48:35,475 --> 00:48:38,344
eight to 12 hours a day,
six to seven days a week.

678
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:40,446
Do you do anything else?

679
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,849
Like what?

680
00:48:41,882 --> 00:48:43,549
Like anything.

681
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:46,719
Go to a park,
a concert, a museum.

682
00:48:46,753 --> 00:48:48,621
- Museum?
- Yeah.

683
00:48:48,654 --> 00:48:50,490
I'll buy you a book on it.
It's called...

684
00:48:50,523 --> 00:48:51,859
<i>Museums for Dummies.</i>

685
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:54,660
Ba-dum-bum.

686
00:48:54,694 --> 00:48:58,364
No, but seriously,
you should do something else.

687
00:48:58,397 --> 00:49:00,366
Just for variety.

688
00:49:04,604 --> 00:49:06,672
I like playing cards.

689
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:25,691
USA!

690
00:49:25,725 --> 00:49:28,795
USA! USA! USA!

691
00:49:35,836 --> 00:49:38,504
That's $800,000.

692
00:49:38,538 --> 00:49:40,107
Where do they get their money?

693
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,842
Geez Louise.

694
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,543
Slow down, Kid.

695
00:49:43,576 --> 00:49:45,778
You see the purple chips?
What do they say?

696
00:49:45,812 --> 00:49:47,547
5,000.

697
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,949
5,000 what?

698
00:49:48,982 --> 00:49:50,851
5,000 grains of rice?

699
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:52,618
That's not money.

700
00:49:52,652 --> 00:49:54,420
Those are tournament chips.

701
00:49:54,453 --> 00:49:55,755
We just call them dollars.

702
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:57,523
It's good publicity.

703
00:49:57,557 --> 00:49:59,559
So, how much is it?

704
00:49:59,592 --> 00:50:02,695
Depends on the buy-in
and the split.

705
00:50:02,728 --> 00:50:06,632
A game like this,
there's about 500,000 in play.

706
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:09,136
The winner will get 150,

707
00:50:09,169 --> 00:50:12,805
runner-up anywhere 70 to 80,
and so on.

708
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,442
- Oh, yeah!
- USA! USA!

709
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:20,546
USA! USA! USA!

710
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,448
You know who he is?

711
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:23,716
Who?

712
00:50:23,749 --> 00:50:26,619
Bill Tell or whatever
his real name is.

713
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:28,588
You know who he is, right?

714
00:50:28,621 --> 00:50:31,691
All I've ever heard was
William Tell.

715
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:33,693
Why do you think
he has another name?

716
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:35,728
You've been around him.

717
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:37,865
He's a mystery.

718
00:50:37,898 --> 00:50:40,901
And I don't know if that's
a good thing or a bad thing.

719
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:43,436
Am I in any danger?

720
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:44,670
Of what?

721
00:50:44,704 --> 00:50:46,472
Falling in love?

722
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:49,408
Don't be a child.

723
00:50:49,442 --> 00:50:51,444
What is his past?

724
00:50:51,477 --> 00:50:53,180
I haven't asked.

725
00:50:53,213 --> 00:50:54,982
Well, what are you two
doing together?

726
00:50:55,015 --> 00:50:56,749
I don't have any goals.

727
00:50:56,782 --> 00:50:59,719
I'm just along for the ride,
one day at a time.

728
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:01,587
Hmm.

729
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,691
What do you think
he's holding?

730
00:51:05,725 --> 00:51:08,594
I don't know, but if
you be quiet, we'll find out.

731
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:12,933
All in.

732
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:20,573
Call.

733
00:51:25,511 --> 00:51:28,048
Oh, yeah! USA!

734
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:30,783
USA! USA!

735
00:51:30,816 --> 00:51:34,587
USA! USA!

736
00:51:36,522 --> 00:51:39,592
- USA!
- That's it, baby.

737
00:51:45,498 --> 00:51:47,600
All right.

738
00:51:47,633 --> 00:51:49,735
54,000 for a night's work.

739
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:51,905
Hope you're not disappointed.

740
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:55,775
That's, uh, 27 for you,
27 for me.

741
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:58,011
Let me sign this.

742
00:51:58,045 --> 00:52:00,013
Hey, uh, excuse me a second.

743
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:01,647
Got to hose it.

744
00:52:01,681 --> 00:52:02,950
All right.

745
00:52:02,983 --> 00:52:04,985
I'll have a Manhattan.

746
00:52:05,018 --> 00:52:07,787
I'll have the, uh...
the same, please.

747
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:11,959
Here you go.

748
00:52:11,992 --> 00:52:13,994
Thanks.

749
00:52:21,134 --> 00:52:22,936
Thank you.

750
00:52:24,104 --> 00:52:26,873
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

751
00:52:33,981 --> 00:52:37,017
What did you mean when
you said that the other day?

752
00:52:38,018 --> 00:52:39,853
Said what?

753
00:52:39,886 --> 00:52:41,587
I woke you.

754
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,990
What does that mean?

755
00:52:45,758 --> 00:52:48,561
I don't know.
It was just something I said.

756
00:52:48,594 --> 00:52:50,030
It's just a comment.

757
00:52:50,063 --> 00:52:52,099
Mm.

758
00:52:52,132 --> 00:52:54,500
It's a odd thing to say.

759
00:52:56,736 --> 00:52:59,605
So, what's your story?

760
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:02,009
Everybody's got a story.

761
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:04,077
What's <i>your</i> story?

762
00:53:06,779 --> 00:53:09,548
Why poker?

763
00:53:09,582 --> 00:53:11,817
Let me guess... it has
something to do with a man.

764
00:53:11,852 --> 00:53:13,954
- Bingo.
- Where was this?

765
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:17,024
East Saint Louis.

766
00:53:17,057 --> 00:53:18,925
He went outside his zone.

767
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:20,093
He tilted.

768
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:21,328
Which direction?

769
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:22,996
Violence.

770
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,698
But he had some good friends
who liked me,

771
00:53:25,731 --> 00:53:28,135
and they were gamblers,

772
00:53:28,168 --> 00:53:30,904
and I drifted
in that direction.

773
00:53:30,937 --> 00:53:34,941
And... they said I have
very good people skills.

774
00:53:36,176 --> 00:53:39,046
Yeah, I found something
I'm good at.

775
00:53:42,082 --> 00:53:43,984
I like you.

776
00:53:47,988 --> 00:53:50,957
I like this friendship we have.

777
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:02,903
So, um...

778
00:54:02,936 --> 00:54:04,938
what are your plans?

779
00:54:04,971 --> 00:54:07,606
I like, uh...
I like where it's headed.

780
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,975
I mean tonight.

781
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:13,779
I got to go back to my motel.

782
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:15,681
I got some work to do.

783
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:18,151
You're not staying here?

784
00:54:18,185 --> 00:54:20,120
No, I don't like staying
at casinos.

785
00:54:20,153 --> 00:54:22,856
They know everything about
you... the maids and the staff.

786
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:24,091
Corridor cameras, noise.

787
00:54:24,124 --> 00:54:26,093
It's not for me.

788
00:54:26,126 --> 00:54:27,994
See you down the road,
La Linda.

789
00:54:30,663 --> 00:54:31,932
Cleveland, right?

790
00:54:31,965 --> 00:54:34,000
Yeah.

791
00:55:00,894 --> 00:55:04,064
<i>His real name was John Rodgers.</i>

792
00:55:04,097 --> 00:55:07,167
<i>"John Gordo" came
sometime later.</i>

793
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,169
<i>He was born in Georgia.</i>

794
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:11,238
<i>He first came to the attention
of the CIA</i>

795
00:55:11,271 --> 00:55:13,974
<i>during the Contra
counterinsurgency.</i>

796
00:55:15,741 --> 00:55:18,677
<i>He was trained in interrogation
in Nicaragua.</i>

797
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:21,281
<i>From there, he entered
the SERE program.</i>

798
00:55:21,314 --> 00:55:24,650
<i>Survival, Evasion,
Resistance and Escape.</i>

799
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:28,687
<i>The program was devised
to help captured U.S. soldiers</i>

800
00:55:28,721 --> 00:55:30,924
<i>withstand hostile
interrogations.</i>

801
00:55:30,957 --> 00:55:32,893
Get the fuck up! Get up!

802
00:55:38,298 --> 00:55:41,268
<i>They were put
into stress conditions.</i>

803
00:55:42,302 --> 00:55:44,905
<i>Sensory deprivation,</i>

804
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:47,474
<i>confinement in close spaces,</i>

805
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:50,776
<i>given bombardment with
dangerous decibels of noise.</i>

806
00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:57,250
<i>Starvation, sleep deprivation.</i>

807
00:56:00,086 --> 00:56:01,888
<i>And sexual humiliation.</i>

808
00:56:17,971 --> 00:56:20,207
<i>After the foreign fighters at
the Guantanamo detention camp</i>

809
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,243
<i>were unresponsive
to interrogations,</i>

810
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:26,079
<i>a decision was made
to reverse engineer</i>

811
00:56:26,112 --> 00:56:27,881
<i>the lessons learned
in the SERE program.</i>

812
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,953
<i>SERE psych op instructors
were brought to Gitmo</i>

813
00:56:32,986 --> 00:56:36,089
<i>to devise enhanced
interrogation techniques.</i>

814
00:56:37,557 --> 00:56:39,825
<i>One of the first to arrive</i>

815
00:56:39,859 --> 00:56:44,064
<i>was consultant John Gordo,
now a civilian.</i>

816
00:56:44,097 --> 00:56:46,132
<i>Lessons learned at Gitmo
were conveyed</i>

817
00:56:46,166 --> 00:56:48,835
<i>to interrogation black sites
around the world.</i>

818
00:56:52,872 --> 00:56:55,075
<i>In 2003, a decision was made</i>

819
00:56:55,108 --> 00:56:57,244
<i>to Gitmo-ize
the civilian prisons</i>

820
00:56:57,277 --> 00:57:00,013
<i>at Bagram Airfield
and Abu Ghraib.</i>

821
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:06,286
<i>Civilian consultant John Gordo
arrived in May.</i>

822
00:57:10,357 --> 00:57:12,292
Did you go to college, Tillich?

823
00:57:12,325 --> 00:57:14,261
Community college, two years.

824
00:57:14,294 --> 00:57:16,263
They teach you
creativity there?

825
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:17,864
No, sir.

826
00:57:17,897 --> 00:57:19,299
Well, that's what
it takes here.

827
00:57:19,332 --> 00:57:20,967
Not everything's
black-and-white.

828
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:22,269
You got to use
your imagination.

829
00:57:22,302 --> 00:57:25,038
This isn't about
following a manual.

830
00:57:25,071 --> 00:57:27,007
It's about getting answers.

831
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,009
Answers that'll save
American lives.

832
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:30,877
What if they don't know
the answers?

833
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:32,879
They all say that.

834
00:57:32,912 --> 00:57:34,414
That's their culture.

835
00:57:34,447 --> 00:57:36,383
Follow me.

836
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,218
Wake him up!

837
00:57:38,251 --> 00:57:41,121
Baufort, get in there.

838
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:43,290
Time to talk, little buddy.

839
00:57:43,323 --> 00:57:46,159
Up! Let's go!

840
00:57:49,062 --> 00:57:51,031
Go!

841
00:57:51,064 --> 00:57:53,033
I'll be right back.

842
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:54,401
Tillich...

843
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:56,836
I like you.

844
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:59,005
I think you got what it takes.

845
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,207
You got the right stuff.

846
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:04,044
I'm gonna put you
on night shift.

847
00:58:04,077 --> 00:58:07,347
That's where all
the good stuff happens.

848
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,984
Okay, let's fuck this Ahmed up!

849
00:58:12,118 --> 00:58:15,155
Greer. Wipe that shit
off of him.

850
00:58:15,188 --> 00:58:18,325
Your easy days are over, Ahmed.

851
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:20,060
Come on.

852
00:58:20,093 --> 00:58:22,062
Get him up. Get him up.

853
00:58:25,265 --> 00:58:27,067
<i>Gordo was right.</i>

854
00:58:28,234 --> 00:58:30,236
<i>I had it in me.</i>

855
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:35,375
<i>I had the right stuff.</i>

856
00:58:55,295 --> 00:58:57,263
<i>The Kid was right.</i>

857
00:58:57,297 --> 00:59:00,433
<i>When those photos came out,
Gordo vanished.</i>

858
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:08,241
<i>The only ones prosecuted
were in the pictures.</i>

859
00:59:08,274 --> 00:59:10,210
<i>Not their superiors.</i>

860
00:59:10,243 --> 00:59:13,346
<i>Not their superiors' superiors.</i>

861
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,350
<i>Gordo moved on, started
his own consulting company.</i>

862
00:59:17,384 --> 00:59:20,086
<i>I heard he was
working in Cairo.</i>

863
00:59:22,188 --> 00:59:25,525
<i>In the military,
rank means everything.</i>

864
00:59:25,558 --> 00:59:29,162
<i>In USDB, it means nothing.</i>

865
00:59:31,164 --> 00:59:32,365
The f...

866
00:59:32,399 --> 00:59:34,000
- What you doing, man?
- What?

867
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:35,268
- You got a problem?
- No. I'm sorry.

868
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:37,404
- You got a problem?
- I'm sorry.

869
00:59:37,437 --> 00:59:39,472
Sorry about that.

870
01:00:02,328 --> 01:00:05,165
Do it. Do it.

871
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:17,444
Bitch.

872
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:29,189
<i>Prisoner's name
was Clay Williams.</i>

873
01:00:29,222 --> 01:00:31,758
<i>I don't know if he's
alive or dead.</i>

874
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:33,460
<i>If he were alive,</i>

875
01:00:33,493 --> 01:00:36,429
<i>I wonder if I could hire him
to finish the job.</i>

876
01:00:43,503 --> 01:00:46,339
<i>You know,
this ain't such a bad life.</i>

877
01:00:46,372 --> 01:00:48,408
I think I could
get used to this.

878
01:00:50,276 --> 01:00:52,111
It's a thin margin.

879
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:54,080
It's 24-7.

880
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:56,182
Most cats can't cut it.

881
01:00:58,818 --> 01:01:00,553
So, how'd you meet La Linda?

882
01:01:00,587 --> 01:01:02,155
I like her.

883
01:01:02,188 --> 01:01:04,157
She runs a stable.

884
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:06,059
That's what they call
a group of gamblers

885
01:01:06,092 --> 01:01:07,327
backed by investors.

886
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,095
The gamblers are the horses.

887
01:01:09,128 --> 01:01:10,497
The investors put up the money.

888
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:13,299
Split the winnings
with the, uh... the stable.

889
01:01:14,501 --> 01:01:17,170
But why don't they just
use their own money?

890
01:01:18,605 --> 01:01:20,440
OPM.

891
01:01:22,242 --> 01:01:24,377
Other people's money.

892
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:28,281
Casino, the TV, the websites...
they all want big pots.

893
01:01:28,314 --> 01:01:30,383
It's entertainment.

894
01:01:33,586 --> 01:01:35,522
Hey, where are we going, anyway?

895
01:01:35,555 --> 01:01:37,390
I thought Saint Louis
was back that way.

896
01:01:37,423 --> 01:01:39,225
Taking a detour.

897
01:01:41,294 --> 01:01:44,230
We're gonna take a little trip
down memory lane.

898
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:13,293
<i>This was my home
for eight and a half years.</i>

899
01:02:13,326 --> 01:02:16,062
<i>Since we were near,
I thought we'd drop by.</i>

900
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:20,533
Up there, second floor.

901
01:02:20,567 --> 01:02:22,502
202 B Pod.

902
01:02:24,237 --> 01:02:27,340
I got my own place
after the first year.

903
01:02:27,373 --> 01:02:29,475
Then, um...

904
01:02:29,509 --> 01:02:32,312
another place
on the other side.

905
01:02:33,713 --> 01:02:35,515
You know that fella
I told you about,

906
01:02:35,548 --> 01:02:37,317
the one I wanted you to meet?

907
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,252
He's here.

908
01:02:39,285 --> 01:02:41,454
Thought I'd pay him a visit.
I've arranged it.

909
01:02:41,487 --> 01:02:43,456
Want to join?

910
01:02:44,691 --> 01:02:46,459
Go into a military prison?

911
01:02:46,492 --> 01:02:48,261
No. No, thanks.

912
01:02:48,294 --> 01:02:50,196
Well, it's pretty good
as far as prisons go.

913
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:52,732
You know, built in 2002.

914
01:02:52,765 --> 01:02:55,702
Things still work, like toilets.

915
01:02:55,735 --> 01:02:58,371
Shit, man, I mean,
you walk in there

916
01:02:58,404 --> 01:03:00,506
and those doors close
behind you, that's fucking it.

917
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,208
I'm going in.

918
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:03,743
Come on.
Think of it as a field trip.

919
01:03:03,776 --> 01:03:06,613
As a teachable moment.

920
01:03:06,646 --> 01:03:08,581
I'll wait in the car.

921
01:03:11,184 --> 01:03:13,152
I'm inviting you.

922
01:03:15,355 --> 01:03:17,290
I ain't going.

923
01:03:22,629 --> 01:03:24,430
Just park the car.

924
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:02,435
Hey, you ever been
on Google Earth?

925
01:04:04,504 --> 01:04:06,372
What is that?

926
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:08,574
It's where I was when I was
waiting for you. It's amazing.

927
01:04:08,608 --> 01:04:10,476
Look, you can enter any place
in the world.

928
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,445
It comes right up.
Street View.

929
01:04:12,478 --> 01:04:14,447
Look at that.
290 Great Hills Road.

930
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,282
Rockville, Virginia.

931
01:04:16,315 --> 01:04:18,651
The house, the surroundings,
latitude, longitude.

932
01:04:18,685 --> 01:04:20,753
That's John Gordo's house.

933
01:04:22,555 --> 01:04:25,525
Front entrance, back entrance.

934
01:04:27,027 --> 01:04:29,830
You still got him on the brain?

935
01:04:29,863 --> 01:04:31,631
Yes, sir.

936
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,402
I don't think that's
such a great idea.

937
01:04:46,612 --> 01:04:48,681
How'd it go at Leavenworth?

938
01:04:55,421 --> 01:04:57,356
You still pissed at me?

939
01:05:00,894 --> 01:05:03,030
Hey, wasn't La Linda
supposed to meet us here?

940
01:05:03,063 --> 01:05:04,530
Yeah.

941
01:05:04,564 --> 01:05:06,466
She'll be here tomorrow.

942
01:05:06,499 --> 01:05:08,468
Meet us in Saint Louis,

943
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:11,337
then do a deep stacks
in Biloxi.

944
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:14,507
Tunica, and on to Panama City.

945
01:05:15,843 --> 01:05:17,677
You like her, huh?

946
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:24,617
Yeah.

947
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:26,552
Yeah. Me, too.

948
01:05:28,454 --> 01:05:30,490
You ever been married?

949
01:05:35,795 --> 01:05:39,298
When I was in the service,
I was a bit of a ladies' man.

950
01:05:39,332 --> 01:05:40,767
Thought I was.

951
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,503
But, uh...

952
01:05:43,536 --> 01:05:46,073
then the other stuff happened.

953
01:05:46,106 --> 01:05:48,508
The narrative was broken.

954
01:05:51,477 --> 01:05:53,679
So, how long's it been
since you got laid?

955
01:05:58,684 --> 01:06:01,420
How long has it been
since you've seen your mother?

956
01:06:01,454 --> 01:06:03,356
I wouldn't know
where to find her.

957
01:06:03,389 --> 01:06:05,092
That's bullshit.

958
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:07,426
What business is it
of yours, anyway?

959
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:10,730
- You remember her?
- Sure.

960
01:06:10,763 --> 01:06:13,699
Yeah? She reach out to you?

961
01:06:13,733 --> 01:06:15,768
She try and contact you?

962
01:06:18,538 --> 01:06:21,340
I'll make you a deal, Kid.

963
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:24,310
You go see your mother,
and I'll fucking get laid.

964
01:06:32,485 --> 01:06:35,388
About earlier:
I don't like prisons.

965
01:06:36,589 --> 01:06:38,424
Even seeing them
on the highway here,

966
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:41,828
looking at it and...
you realize,

967
01:06:41,862 --> 01:06:44,330
"Oh, my God, that's a prison."

968
01:06:47,533 --> 01:06:50,536
My dad used to send my mom
letters from Bagram,

969
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:52,738
and she'd cry.

970
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:04,784
There's something
quite similar in poker.

971
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:07,687
You know the phrase "tilt"?

972
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,388
Yeah.

973
01:07:09,422 --> 01:07:10,891
When a player gets
caught up in winning,

974
01:07:10,924 --> 01:07:13,559
plays outside his zone.

975
01:07:13,593 --> 01:07:15,761
Just like in pinball.

976
01:07:18,031 --> 01:07:20,968
And there's something similar
in interrogations.

977
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:23,603
It's called "force drift."

978
01:07:23,636 --> 01:07:26,806
It happens when
the interrogator applies

979
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,509
more and more force to
the prisoner with less results.

980
01:07:31,912 --> 01:07:33,914
The interrogator
becomes intoxicated

981
01:07:33,947 --> 01:07:36,549
by frustration and power.

982
01:07:38,451 --> 01:07:40,888
Any man can tilt.

983
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:43,489
I can tilt.

984
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:45,591
Your father can tilt.

985
01:07:46,826 --> 01:07:48,929
You can tilt.

986
01:07:54,734 --> 01:07:56,837
I said ride with me.

987
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:58,939
You did.

988
01:07:58,972 --> 01:08:01,008
You came along.

989
01:08:02,976 --> 01:08:06,412
What do you think we're up to,
you and me?

990
01:08:56,096 --> 01:08:58,798
La Linda!

991
01:09:01,068 --> 01:09:03,669
Here, I preregistered you
with a buy-in.

992
01:09:03,703 --> 01:09:06,639
Now, your name is getting
some recognition value.

993
01:09:06,672 --> 01:09:08,641
Well, that's always
a good thing.

994
01:09:08,674 --> 01:09:10,710
How's the turnout?

995
01:09:10,743 --> 01:09:13,080
- Uh, it's normal.
- Oh.

996
01:09:13,113 --> 01:09:15,614
You know that guy, uh,
that's always doing like this?

997
01:09:15,648 --> 01:09:17,951
- Religious Ronnie.
- Yeah. He's here.

998
01:09:17,985 --> 01:09:20,519
Got the Santa Tanita
and all that stuff with him.

999
01:09:20,553 --> 01:09:22,621
- Santeria.
- Santeria...

1000
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,995
Mm, mm, mm.

1001
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:25,551
Let's get the cards in the air!

1002
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:53,947
Clock!

1003
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,815
Clock on 38.

1004
01:10:58,885 --> 01:11:00,387
Okay, okay.

1005
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,754
<i>A great player can see</i>

1006
01:11:01,787 --> 01:11:03,924
<i>right into your soul.</i>

1007
01:11:03,957 --> 01:11:06,226
<i>He can wear earplugs,</i>

1008
01:11:06,259 --> 01:11:09,896
<i>a hoodie, a baseball cap,</i>

1009
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:13,834
<i>mirrored glasses, a ski mask,</i>

1010
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:16,036
<i>but he'll see right
into your soul.</i>

1011
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:17,803
Call.

1012
01:11:28,248 --> 01:11:30,417
- Where's Cirk?
- He must have crashed.

1013
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,152
I'll call him and wake him up.

1014
01:11:32,185 --> 01:11:34,653
No, that's all right.
Don't bother.

1015
01:11:34,687 --> 01:11:36,123
I want a drink.

1016
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:38,058
What can I get you-all?

1017
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:39,725
Uh, I'll have a Tanqueray
on the rocks.

1018
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,129
I'll have a Jack, uh,

1019
01:11:42,162 --> 01:11:44,097
double, neat.

1020
01:11:45,866 --> 01:11:47,134
You talk to him.

1021
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:49,136
Have you noticed anything
about him lately?

1022
01:11:49,169 --> 01:11:51,737
Like what?

1023
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,739
Moody and...

1024
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:56,076
I don't... I don't know.

1025
01:11:56,109 --> 01:11:59,146
Well, I got a offer for
a sponsorship from Rock Poker.

1026
01:11:59,179 --> 01:12:00,981
10,000, for you.

1027
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:03,049
Yeah?
That's the one with the, uh,

1028
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:05,018
little pony logo
on the titty, right?

1029
01:12:05,051 --> 01:12:07,154
Yeah, the rocking horse
with the word "poker."

1030
01:12:09,055 --> 01:12:12,225
Are you all right?

1031
01:12:12,259 --> 01:12:15,195
Yeah. I'm fucking all right.

1032
01:12:15,228 --> 01:12:16,963
"Fucking all right."

1033
01:12:16,997 --> 01:12:19,933
Crying and shit.

1034
01:12:19,966 --> 01:12:22,135
- What do I have to do for this sponsorship?
- Mm.

1035
01:12:22,169 --> 01:12:23,937
You just have to wear
their T-shirts

1036
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,804
during the tournaments.

1037
01:12:27,073 --> 01:12:29,042
I-I had to ask.

1038
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:31,011
It was an offer.

1039
01:12:33,213 --> 01:12:35,081
I wish the Kid had been here.

1040
01:12:35,115 --> 01:12:37,184
- Well, let me call him.
- No, it's all right.

1041
01:12:37,217 --> 01:12:39,019
Leave him alone.

1042
01:12:43,089 --> 01:12:45,926
You know you made the cut.
This is your moment.

1043
01:12:47,928 --> 01:12:52,132
You know, I think that you have
the wrong idea about me.

1044
01:12:52,165 --> 01:12:54,968
Yes, I-I want to win the money.

1045
01:12:55,001 --> 01:12:56,870
I want to go
to the World Series,

1046
01:12:56,903 --> 01:12:59,906
but then that's it.

1047
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:04,044
This kid Cirk, he needs help.

1048
01:13:04,077 --> 01:13:06,112
He's got financial debts.

1049
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:09,015
And I understand him.

1050
01:13:09,049 --> 01:13:10,951
And if I can help him,

1051
01:13:10,984 --> 01:13:13,520
maybe he has a chance
to start over again,

1052
01:13:13,553 --> 01:13:16,856
resume his education
and start a life.

1053
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,960
And you would do all that?

1054
01:13:19,993 --> 01:13:21,827
Well...

1055
01:13:21,861 --> 01:13:23,263
yeah.

1056
01:13:24,231 --> 01:13:25,999
Yeah.

1057
01:13:26,032 --> 01:13:28,535
You have to be the strangest
poker player I ever met.

1058
01:13:28,568 --> 01:13:31,271
- Oh, you have no idea.
- Mm.

1059
01:13:33,139 --> 01:13:35,842
What you doing tomorrow?
You're off.

1060
01:13:39,012 --> 01:13:41,381
I got no plans.

1061
01:13:41,414 --> 01:13:43,984
<i>She said to me,</i>

1062
01:13:44,017 --> 01:13:46,752
<i>"Did you ever see a city
all lit up at night?"</i>

1063
01:13:48,955 --> 01:13:52,025
<i>I said, "Yeah, I've seen
a whole city on fire."</i>

1064
01:13:55,295 --> 01:13:58,164
<i>"Not like that," she said.</i>

1065
01:14:09,909 --> 01:14:11,144
Bobby, you must see this.

1066
01:14:11,177 --> 01:14:12,879
I didn't have it bad.

1067
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:14,214
Come on, trust me.
This is amazing.

1068
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:16,149
That's not what I meant to say.

1069
01:14:16,182 --> 01:14:18,251
Of course you know
other people have it better.

1070
01:14:18,285 --> 01:14:21,354
And you learn to be careful
around certain people.

1071
01:14:21,388 --> 01:14:25,191
But I had friends,
and I had family, of course.

1072
01:14:25,225 --> 01:14:26,860
They had a park.

1073
01:14:26,893 --> 01:14:28,295
They lit it up like this.

1074
01:14:28,328 --> 01:14:31,031
Much bigger.

1075
01:14:31,064 --> 01:14:32,866
How would I know?

1076
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:34,234
I was just a little kid.

1077
01:14:34,267 --> 01:14:35,935
Everything was bigger.

1078
01:14:35,969 --> 01:14:38,238
- This was Saint Louis?
- Yeah.

1079
01:14:41,908 --> 01:14:43,376
You know,
it doesn't matter to me

1080
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:46,046
if you did something bad
in the past.

1081
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:48,081
You can tell me about it.

1082
01:14:51,484 --> 01:14:53,819
Yeah, I don't know.

1083
01:14:56,356 --> 01:14:58,858
What could be so bad?

1084
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:04,130
I was just a kid.

1085
01:15:04,164 --> 01:15:06,066
Everything was bigger.

1086
01:15:06,099 --> 01:15:07,901
Just in your mind.

1087
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:50,377
I'm glad you suggested
this place.

1088
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:21,067
No! In the name
of Jesus and Mary,

1089
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,502
what have you done to me?

1090
01:17:22,535 --> 01:17:25,071
I have done nothing to you!

1091
01:17:27,173 --> 01:17:29,275
USA! USA!

1092
01:17:29,309 --> 01:17:33,313
USA! USA! USA!

1093
01:17:52,499 --> 01:17:54,167
Call.

1094
01:19:22,288 --> 01:19:24,090
Hey.

1095
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:27,594
Where were you?

1096
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:29,562
Oh, played a little blackjack.

1097
01:19:29,596 --> 01:19:31,464
How'd that go?

1098
01:19:31,497 --> 01:19:33,399
Came out ahead.

1099
01:19:33,433 --> 01:19:35,234
Nice.

1100
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:42,742
How do you like it?

1101
01:19:42,775 --> 01:19:44,577
- Like what?
- This.

1102
01:19:44,611 --> 01:19:46,379
This life...

1103
01:19:46,412 --> 01:19:48,448
we have, you and me.

1104
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:51,618
Yeah. It's cool.

1105
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:54,253
That's for sure, but...

1106
01:19:54,287 --> 01:19:56,356
But what?

1107
01:19:58,524 --> 01:20:01,327
It's all the same.

1108
01:20:01,361 --> 01:20:05,198
You know, it's...
it's repetitive.

1109
01:20:05,231 --> 01:20:06,733
It's, uh...

1110
01:20:06,766 --> 01:20:11,170
I don't know if it really feels
like it's going anywhere.

1111
01:20:13,306 --> 01:20:17,510
Well, you know, you just go
around and around

1112
01:20:17,543 --> 01:20:19,545
until you work things out.

1113
01:20:21,714 --> 01:20:23,750
How's that going for you?

1114
01:20:27,687 --> 01:20:29,957
You given it any more thought?

1115
01:20:34,694 --> 01:20:36,462
No.

1116
01:20:41,634 --> 01:20:44,704
You going to
the World Series of Poker?

1117
01:20:44,737 --> 01:20:46,572
Already registered.

1118
01:20:46,606 --> 01:20:47,975
That'll be cool.

1119
01:20:48,008 --> 01:20:50,276
Yeah, that'll be it for me.

1120
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:52,578
You gonna quit?
Quit the circuit?

1121
01:20:54,681 --> 01:20:56,716
I've done my time.

1122
01:20:58,751 --> 01:21:00,420
Look...

1123
01:21:01,587 --> 01:21:03,589
I don't know if...

1124
01:21:03,623 --> 01:21:06,459
I'm up for going to Vegas.

1125
01:21:08,628 --> 01:21:11,330
Yeah? You gonna bail?

1126
01:21:32,418 --> 01:21:34,487
It's late,
but you got a second?

1127
01:21:36,756 --> 01:21:38,758
Sure.

1128
01:21:39,759 --> 01:21:42,261
I want to show you something.

1129
01:21:42,295 --> 01:21:44,363
You have a moment?

1130
01:21:44,397 --> 01:21:46,232
I got a proposal.

1131
01:21:46,867 --> 01:21:48,768
Come here. Follow me.

1132
01:22:22,535 --> 01:22:24,337
Come on.

1133
01:22:43,823 --> 01:22:45,625
You live like this?

1134
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:47,527
Sit down.

1135
01:22:55,568 --> 01:22:57,503
Need anything?

1136
01:22:57,537 --> 01:22:59,438
Some water?

1137
01:22:59,472 --> 01:23:01,440
No, I'm fine.

1138
01:23:03,709 --> 01:23:05,745
How about...

1139
01:23:05,778 --> 01:23:08,714
a sandbag
to put over your head?

1140
01:23:11,551 --> 01:23:13,586
They sell them on eBay.

1141
01:23:16,589 --> 01:23:18,624
When civilian contractor
John Gordo

1142
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:20,726
first approached me
in Abu Ghraib,

1143
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,930
he said I needed
to be more creative.

1144
01:23:22,963 --> 01:23:27,733
He said I had talent
but I lacked imagination.

1145
01:23:27,767 --> 01:23:29,435
Would you agree with that?

1146
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:31,504
Bill, what the fuck
is going on here?

1147
01:23:31,537 --> 01:23:33,506
Real life is going on.

1148
01:23:34,774 --> 01:23:36,642
World Series of Torture.

1149
01:23:36,676 --> 01:23:38,879
- I'm gonna sp...
- Stay seated!

1150
01:23:40,613 --> 01:23:42,815
You sure I can't get you
any water?

1151
01:23:44,885 --> 01:23:47,553
You may wish
you had accepted later.

1152
01:23:51,024 --> 01:23:53,759
Do I have
your attention now, Cirk?

1153
01:23:54,995 --> 01:23:57,797
Do I? Do I?!

1154
01:23:58,866 --> 01:24:00,700
Yeah.

1155
01:24:00,733 --> 01:24:02,501
Good.

1156
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:08,942
Are the little nerves at the
ends of your fingers and toes

1157
01:24:08,976 --> 01:24:12,712
and the tip of your dick
starting to tingle with fear?

1158
01:24:16,884 --> 01:24:18,751
Good.

1159
01:24:18,784 --> 01:24:20,820
Let me enhance this
a little bit.

1160
01:24:34,868 --> 01:24:36,970
I've been doing a little
investigating about you,

1161
01:24:37,004 --> 01:24:39,572
Cirk with a "C."

1162
01:24:40,806 --> 01:24:43,509
About your father...
I did meet him at Abu Ghraib.

1163
01:24:43,542 --> 01:24:44,978
I lied about that.

1164
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:48,714
Your mother,
your time in college,

1165
01:24:48,748 --> 01:24:50,549
your scrapes with the law.

1166
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:52,785
It's all on the Internet,
of course.

1167
01:24:55,588 --> 01:24:57,823
I'm gonna make you a proposal.

1168
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,828
Sit up.

1169
01:25:10,703 --> 01:25:16,575
You have approximately $20,000
in college loan debts.

1170
01:25:23,516 --> 01:25:25,052
20,000.

1171
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:28,487
To go back to college...

1172
01:25:28,521 --> 01:25:31,892
tuition, expenses,
condoms and so forth...

1173
01:25:31,925 --> 01:25:35,594
it adds up,
so let's say another...

1174
01:25:37,864 --> 01:25:39,833
...80,000.

1175
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:46,572
On top of that, you've got
$5,000 in credit card debt.

1176
01:25:46,605 --> 01:25:48,909
Your mama... bless her,
she's got her problems...

1177
01:25:48,942 --> 01:25:51,979
she's about 35 grand
underwater,

1178
01:25:52,012 --> 01:25:55,715
with the mortgage and all,
so let's say 40 grand.

1179
01:25:55,748 --> 01:25:57,683
And for the heck of it,
let's throw in

1180
01:25:57,717 --> 01:25:59,286
another ten grand pocket money.

1181
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:03,723
That's 150 grand, cash,
tax free.

1182
01:26:03,756 --> 01:26:06,659
All that's yours
on one condition.

1183
01:26:06,692 --> 01:26:08,627
And what is that?

1184
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:24,510
Go see your mother.

1185
01:26:30,183 --> 01:26:33,619
She lives
in Fall River, Oregon.

1186
01:26:33,652 --> 01:26:35,022
I have the address.

1187
01:26:35,055 --> 01:26:36,622
I spoke to her.

1188
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:38,892
I didn't tell her
who I was, of course.

1189
01:26:38,925 --> 01:26:41,727
Go visit her.

1190
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:43,696
Forgive her.

1191
01:26:43,729 --> 01:26:45,564
Make things right with her.

1192
01:26:45,598 --> 01:26:47,100
Clear up her debt.

1193
01:26:47,134 --> 01:26:50,103
Tell her about
your college plans.

1194
01:26:50,137 --> 01:26:52,805
Then put her on the phone
with me.

1195
01:26:54,074 --> 01:26:56,910
I want to hear her say
these things.

1196
01:26:56,943 --> 01:26:59,012
I want to hear her voice.

1197
01:27:08,188 --> 01:27:10,123
You serious?

1198
01:27:12,758 --> 01:27:14,560
Yes.

1199
01:27:20,033 --> 01:27:22,568
And if I don't?

1200
01:27:24,905 --> 01:27:27,974
This is not a proposal
you can afford to reject.

1201
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:32,778
And if you cheat me,

1202
01:27:32,812 --> 01:27:34,814
I'll find you.

1203
01:27:36,016 --> 01:27:38,051
You don't want that to happen.

1204
01:27:42,155 --> 01:27:44,991
I don't like celebrity gambling.

1205
01:27:46,126 --> 01:27:48,761
I like anonymous gambling.

1206
01:27:48,794 --> 01:27:50,763
I did this for you.

1207
01:27:52,165 --> 01:27:54,201
You hear what I'm saying?

1208
01:28:03,176 --> 01:28:05,112
Yeah.

1209
01:28:06,146 --> 01:28:08,014
Do we have a deal?

1210
01:28:13,286 --> 01:28:15,222
Yeah, we have a deal.

1211
01:28:16,822 --> 01:28:19,059
Thank you.

1212
01:28:19,092 --> 01:28:20,961
Okay.

1213
01:28:20,994 --> 01:28:22,728
Let's give her a call.

1214
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:25,432
She'll still be up right now.

1215
01:28:25,465 --> 01:28:27,100
Yeah.

1216
01:29:01,902 --> 01:29:03,802
One sec!

1217
01:29:04,838 --> 01:29:06,072
Who is it?

1218
01:29:06,106 --> 01:29:07,941
It's William.

1219
01:29:10,844 --> 01:29:12,778
What's up? Thought we were
meeting in the pit.

1220
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:14,080
- You cool?
- Yeah.

1221
01:29:14,114 --> 01:29:15,982
Yeah.

1222
01:29:16,016 --> 01:29:18,118
Uh, we got final table
tomorrow.

1223
01:29:18,151 --> 01:29:20,053
Yeah, no, I know.
2:30, right?

1224
01:29:20,086 --> 01:29:21,955
Hey, where's your sidekick?

1225
01:29:21,988 --> 01:29:24,491
Oh, yeah, he had to...
he had to go home.

1226
01:29:24,524 --> 01:29:26,259
His mom's not feeling well.

1227
01:29:26,293 --> 01:29:28,061
- He has a mom?
- Yeah.

1228
01:29:28,094 --> 01:29:29,762
Believe it or not.

1229
01:29:29,795 --> 01:29:31,231
So, what's on your mind?

1230
01:29:31,264 --> 01:29:33,066
Um...

1231
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:38,804
I made a promise to Cirk
before I left.

1232
01:29:38,838 --> 01:29:40,941
You know, he talks about you.
He fancies you.

1233
01:29:40,974 --> 01:29:44,077
You mean he
fancies himself a matchmaker.

1234
01:29:46,012 --> 01:29:49,282
I promised him that I'd...

1235
01:29:49,316 --> 01:29:52,886
act on these feelings I have.

1236
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,990
These feelings towards you.

1237
01:29:57,023 --> 01:29:58,258
Oh.

1238
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:00,726
I think you may have them, too.

1239
01:30:09,135 --> 01:30:10,904
You do, huh?

1240
01:30:10,937 --> 01:30:12,771
Yes, I do.

1241
01:30:26,987 --> 01:30:28,821
<i>The feeling of being</i>

1242
01:30:28,855 --> 01:30:32,292
<i>forgiven by another
and forgiving oneself</i>

1243
01:30:32,325 --> 01:30:34,760
<i>are so much alike...</i>

1244
01:30:36,429 --> 01:30:39,798
<i>...there's no point in trying
to keep them distinct.</i>

1245
01:30:44,104 --> 01:30:46,039
How much time we got?

1246
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,975
Come look at this.

1247
01:30:51,044 --> 01:30:52,811
What?

1248
01:30:54,114 --> 01:30:55,982
Cirk?

1249
01:30:56,016 --> 01:30:57,884
My God, Cirk, is that you?

1250
01:30:57,917 --> 01:30:59,886
- Yeah, Mom. Yeah, Mom, it's me.
- What? Where are you?

1251
01:30:59,919 --> 01:31:01,955
I'm in Panama City.

1252
01:31:01,988 --> 01:31:03,323
Well, what's happening?

1253
01:31:03,356 --> 01:31:05,325
It-it's been so long.

1254
01:31:05,358 --> 01:31:08,862
Mom, I've been thinking, and...

1255
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:11,164
I haven't been fair to you.

1256
01:31:11,197 --> 01:31:13,199
I want to come and see you.

1257
01:31:15,035 --> 01:31:17,037
Are you... are you all right?

1258
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:18,305
So it goes on
like that for a while.

1259
01:31:18,338 --> 01:31:20,006
Got a little maudlin.

1260
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,841
She lives outside of Portland.

1261
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,310
He'll be there in a day or two.

1262
01:31:23,343 --> 01:31:25,845
- He'll call me from there.
- Mm.

1263
01:31:25,879 --> 01:31:28,181
How'd you get him to do that?

1264
01:31:28,214 --> 01:31:30,216
He wanted to.

1265
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:32,886
Just needed an excuse.

1266
01:31:32,919 --> 01:31:34,287
I may go visit them.

1267
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:37,324
I never played the Northwest.

1268
01:31:37,357 --> 01:31:40,226
And welcome to the final table.

1269
01:31:48,935 --> 01:31:50,270
You keep tabs on this.

1270
01:31:50,303 --> 01:31:52,372
- I'm expecting a call.
- Mm-hmm.

1271
01:32:22,402 --> 01:32:24,938
Yes!

1272
01:32:24,971 --> 01:32:27,240
USA! USA!

1273
01:32:27,273 --> 01:32:29,209
USA!

1274
01:32:38,151 --> 01:32:40,086
Well done.

1275
01:32:45,325 --> 01:32:47,160
All right, players.

1276
01:32:47,193 --> 01:32:48,695
That's the end of the level.

1277
01:32:48,728 --> 01:32:50,697
90-minute dinner break.

1278
01:32:57,437 --> 01:32:59,506
Your phone was buzzing.

1279
01:33:05,278 --> 01:33:07,213
It's from Cirk.

1280
01:33:07,247 --> 01:33:09,916
"Wish you were here."

1281
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:19,192
Nice.

1282
01:33:19,225 --> 01:33:21,261
You got about ten minutes.

1283
01:34:39,205 --> 01:34:41,140
Good game.

1284
01:34:41,174 --> 01:34:42,575
Good game, man.

1285
01:36:07,427 --> 01:36:09,095
I need a minute.

1286
01:36:17,537 --> 01:36:19,372
What's going on?

1287
01:36:21,374 --> 01:36:23,242
Floor.

1288
01:36:31,751 --> 01:36:33,921
Thanks for joining me
here in Rockville, Virginia.

1289
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:35,755
Ryan Choi
with Eleven Alive News.

1290
01:36:35,788 --> 01:36:39,192
We are currently on the scene
of Major John Gordo's home.

1291
01:36:39,225 --> 01:36:40,660
Now, what we do know is that

1292
01:36:40,693 --> 01:36:42,729
there has been
a unidentified suspect

1293
01:36:42,762 --> 01:36:45,632
that was armed
with a pellet pistol.

1294
01:36:45,665 --> 01:36:48,401
The suspect fired and missed.

1295
01:36:48,434 --> 01:36:51,604
Major Gordo returned fire,
killing the suspect.

1296
01:36:51,638 --> 01:36:54,474
Earlier today,
I spoke with Major Gordo.

1297
01:36:54,507 --> 01:36:56,309
You purchase security

1298
01:36:56,342 --> 01:36:58,244
thinking something like this
might happen,

1299
01:36:58,277 --> 01:37:01,247
but you don't think
it ever will.

1300
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,783
In other news, a fire
in the warehouse district

1301
01:37:03,816 --> 01:37:06,386
of suspicious origin.

1302
01:37:06,419 --> 01:37:08,454
Four fire companies responded.

1303
01:37:08,488 --> 01:37:10,289
There were no
reported injuries,

1304
01:37:10,323 --> 01:37:12,225
and the fire was brought
under control

1305
01:37:12,258 --> 01:37:14,962
after roughly 90 minutes.

1306
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:18,164
Fire investigators
are on the scene.

1307
01:39:39,438 --> 01:39:41,607
It's turned off.

1308
01:39:55,588 --> 01:39:57,557
Come sit down, John.

1309
01:39:58,658 --> 01:40:00,593
Don't be stupid.

1310
01:40:24,617 --> 01:40:26,452
You remember me?

1311
01:40:26,485 --> 01:40:27,921
Should I?

1312
01:40:30,456 --> 01:40:32,692
Tier 1A, Abu Ghraib.

1313
01:40:35,461 --> 01:40:36,897
Tillich?

1314
01:40:38,031 --> 01:40:39,900
Bill Tillich.

1315
01:40:42,635 --> 01:40:45,771
You look pretty good,
all things considered.

1316
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:50,177
How long were you
in Leavenworth?

1317
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:52,745
- Eight and a half years.
- That's a bitch.

1318
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:01,787
That boy that you shot...

1319
01:41:03,623 --> 01:41:05,725
...he wanted to kill you.

1320
01:41:05,758 --> 01:41:07,593
I assumed that.

1321
01:41:09,595 --> 01:41:12,565
You trained his father...

1322
01:41:12,598 --> 01:41:14,935
his name was Roger Baufort...

1323
01:41:14,968 --> 01:41:17,004
just like you trained me.

1324
01:41:18,671 --> 01:41:21,440
What happened to him?

1325
01:41:21,474 --> 01:41:23,476
He shot himself.

1326
01:41:25,078 --> 01:41:27,747
So I'm to blame?

1327
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:30,783
That's a pussified defense,
PFC Tillich,

1328
01:41:30,816 --> 01:41:32,785
and you know it.

1329
01:41:32,818 --> 01:41:36,489
We are each responsible
for our own actions.

1330
01:41:39,692 --> 01:41:41,727
I believe that.

1331
01:41:44,563 --> 01:41:47,800
We are going to go
into the next room,

1332
01:41:47,834 --> 01:41:49,836
you and I...

1333
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:54,440
...and we are going to have
a dramatic reenactment.

1334
01:41:56,977 --> 01:41:59,712
Only one of us
will come out alive.

1335
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:04,583
I'm going to make things right.

1336
01:42:06,652 --> 01:42:09,455
Either that, John Rodgers...

1337
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:13,260
...or I'm going to blast
a bullet

1338
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:15,561
straight through your eyeball.

1339
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:34,714
Lead the way.

1340
01:42:34,747 --> 01:42:36,649
After you.

1341
01:42:46,126 --> 01:42:48,594
I got some cigarettes.
Do you want one?

1342
01:42:48,627 --> 01:42:50,563
No.

1343
01:42:50,596 --> 01:42:52,866
Neither do I.

1344
01:42:52,899 --> 01:42:54,868
Who goes first?

1345
01:42:56,169 --> 01:42:57,971
Me.

1346
01:44:02,969 --> 01:44:05,038
Emergency services?

1347
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:09,976
I'd like to report a homicide.

1348
01:44:12,112 --> 01:44:14,680
290 Great Falls Road.

1349
01:44:50,749 --> 01:44:52,119
<i>I never imagined myself</i>

1350
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:55,188
<i>as someone suited
to a life of incarceration.</i>

1351
01:44:59,259 --> 01:45:00,994
Inmate Tillich.

1352
01:45:01,027 --> 01:45:02,795
You got a visitor.

1353
