Look at him.
Look at the little angry butler.

288
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:30,155

We're going to the Taj.

293

- We're going to the Taj.
- We're going to the Taj.

294

Um, hang on. Let's go.
Uh, excuse me, sir.

295
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:45,204
- Namaste, mate.
- Namaste.

296
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:47,106
I think we've got
a little problem here

297
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:50,244
because, um, we...
we didn't order this pork thing.

298
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:52,579
Yes.

299
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:55,848
[chuckles] No, no, no.
I don't think so.

300
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,416
Because if you just look here,
we didn't actually...

301
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:58,986
- [gunshot]
- [woman screams]

- Are you hurt?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

312

If I may, uh...

313
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:47,492
2003 was a very good year
for Bordeaux

314
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:49,894
due to the exceptional
heat wave that year.

315
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:53,231
Uh, the Château Latour, there...

316
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:57,835
Amazing depth, powerful yet silky,
dark fruit, seamless finish.

317
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:59,204
It's a very good wine.

318
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:01,174
- Hm. Yeah.
- That sounds nice.

319
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:03,944
Um...

320
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:08,114
You know what? Why don't you
just bring me a JD and Diet Coke.

321
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:10,217
- Really?
- Yeah.

322
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:14,152
And you know what? Bring us a
cheeseburger for old times' sake.

323
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:15,853
[Arjun] Chicken or fish, sir?

324
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:17,491
No. Just a regular burger. Beef.

325
00:23:18,124 --> 00:23:20,428
Oh. They don't have beef here.

326
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:24,165
- Yeah. They got everything here.
- Honey, cows are sacred in India.

327
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:28,369
- I am so sorry. I completely spaced. Uh...
- It's okay.

328
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,836
Okay, so what do you recommend?
What's...

329
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:34,139
- The lamb kofta is popular with Americans.
- Hi, Sally.

330
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:35,909
Hey, Zahra.

331
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:39,310
No. I've just checked in with reception.
They said the doctor's still on their way.

332
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:41,014
[baby cooing]

333
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,049
No, no. He's more than fine.

334
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,486
Yeah, he had a big feed
and I just put him down.

335
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:50,523
Sure, I'll call you then.

336
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:52,826
But, really, we're all good.

337
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:55,362
Okay.

338
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:57,297
Enjoy.

339
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:06,104
Thank you, sir. And how would
you like to make the payment?

340
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:08,476
[chattering]

341
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:11,366
[man on phone, in Hindi] There's
been an attack. Is the hotel safe?!

342
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,618
Yes, of course.

343
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,994
[man]
So everything is okay there?

00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:28,831
They won't.

695
00:48:32,301 --> 00:48:33,368
I gotta go, Dad.

696
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,304
I'll call you
when we're out, okay?

Come, come. Quiet.

[Arjun]
Mr. Oberoi, sir. Are you there?

714
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:40,562
- [pounding on door]
- Sir.

715
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,998
Sir. Sir, it's me,
Arjun from Shamiana.

716
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,932
Okay.

717
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:46,534
[metal clanks]

718
00:50:49,037 --> 00:50:50,706

Please come. Come, come.

00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:56,776
Nothing to fear. Please come.

Yes. Please.

722
00:51:00,816 --> 00:51:01,717
Hi.

723
00:51:02,618 --> 00:51:03,518
How are we feeling?

724
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,020
Yeah, everything's fine.

725
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:07,122
Everything is fine.

726
00:51:13,729 --> 00:51:17,833
[Jomon] Please, please. This way.
Take a seat. We have water...

727
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,568
- Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
- Jomon.

728
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,638
I'm so sorry. Everything will be fine now.
You're totally safe.

729
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,606
Sit anywhere you like, okay?

730
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:28,912
No problem. Please, please.

731
00:51:29,645 --> 00:51:30,579
[chef] Welcome, sir.

732
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:34,683
- I would like a cognac. Vernier Dejeune.
- Of course. Of course, sir.

733
00:51:36,752 --> 00:51:37,853
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

734
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:40,454
Take a seat, sir.

735
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,869
[claps]

736
00:51:55,871 --> 00:51:58,807
Ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention, please?

737
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,508
Can you come closer?
Arjun, can you just help them?

738
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:03,977
Little further. I don't...
I don't want to speak loudly. Please.

739
00:52:03,979 --> 00:52:06,780
Can you come closer, sir?
Sir, ma'am? Please.

740
00:52:06,782 --> 00:52:09,751
Sir, you can...
Can you come forward, please? Thank you.

741
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:15,457
Ladies and gentlemen...

742
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:20,462
I am Hemant Oberoi,
head chef here at the Taj.

743
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:24,933
We are all terribly sorry for everything
you've had to endure here tonight.

744
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:30,538
But please be rest assured
the worst is behind us now.

745
00:52:32,207 --> 00:52:36,144
The Chambers is an exclusive club.
Very difficult to access.

746
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:39,646
As you can see,
there are no internal windows

747
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:42,217
and every entrance
has been secured.

748
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:46,920
We will be safe here until
police comes and fetches us.

749
00:52:46,922 --> 00:52:48,822
[man] When will that be?

750
00:52:48,824 --> 00:52:50,690
- [woman] What's taking them so long?
- [Oberoi] Ma'am.

751
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:53,595
They're outside right now.
It's just a matter of time.

752
00:52:55,298 --> 00:52:58,533
Yes, what's important
is that we remain calm and quiet

753
00:52:59,202 --> 00:53:02,205
because we want our position
to remain a secret.

754
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:09,075
[man on TV] <i>The situation inside the
hotel is becoming utterly desperate.</i>

755

<i>Footage just in of this man forced
to flee on a rope improvised...</i>

756
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:14,515
Come on. We should get going.

757
00:53:15,616 --> 00:53:17,185
Going? Where?

758
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:19,319
The staff's moving everybody up to the
Chambers Lounge on the sixth floor.

759
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,087
They said it'll be safer.

760
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:22,255
No way.

761
00:53:22,257 --> 00:53:23,790
Sally. Come on.

762
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:25,526
You can go.
I'm not going anywhere.

763
00:53:27,362 --> 00:53:29,029
David. There are men
with guns out there

764
00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:30,864
that are just killing people
in the hallway.

765
00:53:30,866 --> 00:53:32,601
- There's no way that I'm going out there.
- I know.

766
00:53:33,602 --> 00:53:36,036
And Zahra's out there
and she's by herself.

767
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:38,673
[sobbing] They came in here.
They fucking shot her, David.

768
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,941
Like a fucking rabbit.
And if we move and if the baby wakes up,

769
00:53:41,943 --> 00:53:44,246
- they're gonna shoot us too.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

770
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,948
[breathes shakily] I mean,
the cops are already outside.

771
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,053
Can't we just wait for them
to come and get us?

772
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,057
Yeah.

773
00:53:58,059 --> 00:53:58,959
Okay.

774
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:01,862
[Sally sighs]

775
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:10,972

- [gasping]
- [Vam, muffled] Kanu!

[muffled rapid gunfire]

779

None of your business.

Are you calling me a terrorist?

is disgraceful.

Ha.

849
00:57:58,966 --> 00:58:00,234
She's worried about your beard.

850
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:02,970
- My beard.
- Uh-huh.

851
00:58:03,537 --> 00:58:05,072
Also your turban.

852
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,206
Hang back in the kitchen
for a little bit, huh?

853
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,109
Good boy.

[stammers] I'd like
to show you something.

Here's Seva.

00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:44,478
That's my wife and her quite...
quite awful sister.

860

This is my...
This is my pagri.

861
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:57,524
To us Sikhs it is...
it is sacred.

862
00:58:59,426 --> 00:59:05,399
It's a... It's a symbol
of honor and courage.

863
00:59:10,971 --> 00:59:15,477
Since I was a small boy,
I've never gone outside without it.

864
00:59:18,212 --> 00:59:21,148
To do so would...
It would bring shame to my family.

865
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:24,218
But...

866
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,088
while we are in this hotel,
you are my guest.

867
00:59:29,624 --> 00:59:31,524
And I am your staff.

868
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,428
So, if it would make you feel
comfortable, I will take it off.

869
00:59:35,596 --> 00:59:36,497
Would you like that?

870
00:59:37,598 --> 00:59:38,499
No.

871
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:40,567
No.

872
00:59:41,468 --> 00:59:42,903
I'm just scared.

873
00:59:43,637 --> 00:59:44,671
We all are.

874
00:59:46,507 --> 00:59:47,408
But...

875
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:49,910
to get through this,
we must...

876
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:52,277
must stick together.

877
00:59:52,279 --> 00:59:53,180
Okay?

878
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:57,918
Yes. Indeed.

879
00:59:58,352 --> 01:00:00,051
Thank you.

880
01:00:00,053 --> 01:00:01,989

- This is Lani from the hotel reception.
- <i>Yes.</i>

885
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,237
Ma'am, the rescue team
is on your floor.

886
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,106

- Don't open that door. What, you're crazy?

905
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:43,257
- You're going to get us killed.

[woman panting]

907
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,393
Mr. Oberoi, sir. It's Prahba.

908
01:01:48,395 --> 01:01:51,229
- It could be a trap.
- I know what I'm doing, sir.

01:02:23,664 --> 01:02:25,764
- A doctor or a nurse?
- I'm an ophthalmologist.

924
01:02:25,766 --> 01:02:27,632
- Please come.
- I'm not sure if there's much I can do,

925
01:02:27,634 --> 01:02:28,769
- but I can try.
- It's okay.

926
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:32,105
I... I need to see the wound.

[screams]

931
01:02:42,182 --> 01:02:44,515
We need to tape this hole shut and
then we make a sling for her arm.

932
01:02:44,517 --> 01:02:48,185
- Elastoplast, Sellotape...
- First aid box. [speaks in Hindi]

- Come. Hold this. Hold tight here.

It's not good.

935
01:02:58,865 --> 01:03:00,601
I think she's bleeding
into her chest cavity.

936
01:03:01,468 --> 01:03:03,837
There's no way to save her
without getting her to a hospital.

937
01:03:05,572 --> 01:03:07,439
- I'll take her.
- Too risky.

938
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:09,341
If she stays, she'll die.

[Bree groaning, panting]

940
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,851

We go down the back stairs and
straight out the service exit.

942
01:03:21,288 --> 01:03:22,887
Arjun, if they find you,
they find us.

943
01:03:22,889 --> 01:03:24,957
But if I make it,
we'll have a way out.

944
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:26,627
- [Bree screams]
- [woman] Shh.

945
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,165
We can't just
let her die here.

946
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:35,434
Okay.

947
01:03:36,402 --> 01:03:37,436
Call me when you get out.

948
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,408
It's okay.

949
01:03:44,978 --> 01:03:47,681
Madam? Madam? Madam?

950
01:03:48,314 --> 01:03:49,816
I'm going to get you
out of here, okay?

951
01:03:51,685 --> 01:03:54,454
But there are some stairs.
Do you think you can stand?

01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,693

- [Oberoi] Ma'am, you will be fine.
- Okay.

01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:07,768
You'll be fine.
Arjun is with you. Don't worry.

956
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:11,738

like an American.

Put your hand in
her bra and check there.

No, I'm so sorry Brother...

I can't touch her there.

[Brother] She's an infidel.
It's not a sin.

Check.

CNN just showed that Special
Forces have landed in Mumbai.

..as we've heard
our Muslim brothers scream.
