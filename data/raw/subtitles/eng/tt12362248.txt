4
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,653
Oh, the joy of the holidays.

5
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,537
And by joy, of course,

6
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:12,068
I mean that soul crushing
mixture of anxiety

7
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,063
and depression that we shoved
down under our happy faces,

8
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:20,657
while actually we just
got past Thanksgiving.

9
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,218
I'm not ready.

10
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,688
As mothers, we're supposed
to pull it all together

11
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,138
and make it perfect.

12
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,398
Not because we like it,

13
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,058
but because we know we're the only ones

14
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,948
that can get the job done.

15
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,688
And let's be clear.

16
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,563
There is no greater
challenge than Christmas.

17
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:45,928
Hey!

18
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,763
Hey!

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,028
- Hi Diane.
- Hi Shelly.

20
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,318
Where are you headed to?

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,708
Shopping. Got some decorations to buy.

22
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,738
Oh, gees. Good luck with that.

23
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,108
I bought all of these
decorations like months ago.

24
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,224
- Crazy sales.
- Cool.

25
00:02:02,226 --> 00:02:04,538
[laughs] Yeah, got a whole
new theme going this year.

26
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,778
Gonna invite the neighborhood.

27
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,868
- You're gonna be there, right?
- Couldn't miss it

28
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,994
if I wanted to.
[Shelly laughing]

29
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:12,632
You're funny.

30
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:16,838
I'm really excited to see what
you're putting up this year.

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,568
Yeah. Pretty excited.

32
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,853
My eyes on you.

33
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,862
Oh, I'll make sure you have
a front row seat, Shelly.

34
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,918
[laughs] I will be there.

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,470
I'll be there. I'll be looking.

36
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:34,248
- All right.
- Okay. See ya.

37
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,250
I'll see ya there.

38
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,458
[Christmasy music]

39
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:45,781
Ooh.

40
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,942
Don't panic.

41
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,322
I got this.

42
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,878
It's not my first rodeo.

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,348
My third, actually.

44
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,327
I have the two at home.

45
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:00,144
Here's Abby. She's 15 going on 21.

46
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,378
- Not dressed like this.
- The girls at school

47
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,682
- dress way worse than this.
- I don't care.

48
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,321
- You don't. Go change.
- So protective.

49
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:07,740
Yes! Go change.

50
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,271
- Whatever.
- I love you.

51
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,283
Take the makeup down a notch.

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,188
- My youngest, Dougie.
- Mommy, mommy.

53
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,998
Oh, he's pure joy.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,178
When he's dry. What's up?

55
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,288
- I wet the bed again.
- But don't let the constant

56
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,458
urinating distract you, I don't.

57
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,698
After all, my bets are on him

58
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,518
to be the one to change
my diapers when I'm old.

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,748
Ah, the cycle of life.

60
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,558
My husband, Brian.

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,938
15 years of marriage, still my best bud.

62
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,583
But while he's at work, I get stuff done.

63
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,528
For example, when it comes to Christmas,

64
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,023
even the simplest of tasks,
he's absolutely useless.

65
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,318
You try it.

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,278
Oh, I think she's going for it.

67
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,533
That candy cane is mine!

68
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:17,101
Yes!

69
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,577
Wait, ah, I almost forgot.

70
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,078
Mom.

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,781
The kids call her Nana. I call her Jane.

72
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:25,978
Oh, my bridge.

73
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,688
I need some tape, some glue, some cotton,

74
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,818
and then I'm just good to go.

75
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,628
She was an Army nurse for years.

76
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,789
She's a woman of many strengths.

77
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,128
- Brian, we need to go.
- I love this.

78
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,608
This is absolutely beautiful.

79
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,460
Oh, lovely. Hope it fits me.

80
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:41,378
Letting her guard
down isn't one of them.

81
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,418
Hey, candy cane lady.

82
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,533
Is it really Christmas
without oversized candy canes?

83
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,353
Hold on. Hold on.

84
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,393
- That's the one you want?
- Oh, you don't have

85
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:57,798
- to do that.
- Well, that's,

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,740
oh, maybe I shoulda let you get it.

87
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:00,879
Wow.

88
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,612
- Thanks.
- That's some bird there.

89
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:03,488
- Yeah.
- You know how to pick 'em.

90
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,608
- Well, I always get it early.
- Ah, great.

91
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,268
- Early bird special.
- Well, merry Christmas.

92
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,178
Slow your role, buddy.
No need to rush it.

93
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,458
Yeah, merry Christmas.

94
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,543
Still got 119 hours to go. Lots of time.

95
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,963
Merry Christmas.

96
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,178
And while I'm trying to prepare

97
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,598
for this magical holiday season,

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,203
my partner in crime
burns the midnight oil.

99
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,188
I know his work is all-consuming.

100
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,812
But we both know he hides behind it.

101
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:41,806
I'm awake, I'm awake,
I'm awake, I'm awake.

102
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:42,641
I'm awake.

103
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,582
Sorry.

104
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,438
And there's my sister Kate.

105
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,697
She loves her life way too much.

106
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:57,088
Cut! That's a wrap.

107
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,840
We're back here same time tomorrow.

108
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,848
So, still headed to DR for the holidays?

109
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,628
Bags are packed, sunscreen pre applied,

110
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,028
and I am counting the minutes.

111
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,341
- Oh.
- Oh, what?

112
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:11,768
It's just...

113
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,123
Spit it out, Miranda.
I don't have all day.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,833
Your sister?

115
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:19,398
[groans] Ah, crap.

116
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,428
You wanted me to remind you
to patch things up with her.

117
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,158
Ah, another year bites the dust.

118
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,278
Look, it's none of my business, but-

119
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,848
- I said remind me, not lecture me.

120
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,438
I know, but you keep
going on about how much

121
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,408
you miss your niece and your nephew.

122
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,768
I know, I confide in your
as I have no social life

123
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,758
outside of this job.

124
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,098
It's just, my relationship with my sister

125
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,482
is complex, and guilt-ridden-

126
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:45,948
and downright vindictive.

127
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,068
I mean, there's always next year.

128
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,023
It's just this year, ugh, I need a break.

129
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,728
Okay, wish me luck. I hope
they sign off on this.

130
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,563
Good luck.

131
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:03,906
[Shelly laughing]

132
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:10,643
Oh my gosh, how do
you move off? [groans]

133
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:11,978
Oh, is that him?

134
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,453
- Diane, you see it?
- Oh.

135
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:19,388
- I love Christmas!
- He has time

136
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,543
to roast marshmallows, I
have not showered today.

137
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:24,889
Oh, crap!

138
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:26,687
Crap!

139
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:31,478
Ah!

140
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:35,377
So good.

141
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:42,730
All right. Can't be that bad.

142
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:47,128
[groans]

143
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:51,774
[dramatic crescendo]

144
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,561
[phone ringing]

145
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:59,396
Excellent shot, sir.

146
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,548
I've had my eye on you for
quite a while now, Brian.

147
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,918
You remind me of a younger,
smarter version of myself.

148
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,688
Ah, that's funny 'cause
I've always thought

149
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,003
of you as a smarter,
better-looking version of myself.

150
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,838
I think there was a but coming.

151
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,948
No, no, there's no
buts coming here, sir.

152
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,781
No buts at all.

153
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:26,593
As in, but am I failing you, Roger?

154
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:31,014
Do you wanna define the
word failing for me, please?

155
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:34,208
I mean, are you talking
failing as in I'm fired failing

156
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,838
or failing as in, Brian,
I see that you're really

157
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,498
working your ass off,
please do not fail me now.

158
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,307
Which one are we talking about?

159
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,458
Look, I'd give anything to be you, okay?

160
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,698
Company man on his way up in the world,

161
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,518
solid under pressure.

162
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,618
Brian, the fate of my company

163
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,808
and the ability to focus on my short game

164
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,708
- are at stake right now.
- Look, sir,

165
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,038
I'm sure you've noticed that my wife,

166
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,448
she's about to burst, right?

167
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,928
And I am now on my 17th cup of coffee.

168
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,140
So I just, I need a little bit of...

169
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,588
- Of time.
- Well, there no rest

170
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,748
for the weary.

171
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,548
So, do I have your commitment on this

172
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,250
or do I need to find someone else?

173
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,008
No, come on, come on.

174
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,618
Of course you have my
commitment, 100% there.

175
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,453
Absolutely.

176
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:25,638
That sounds like a company
man I can get behind.

177
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,053
Run me the updated
numbers before I tee off.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,833
Will do.

179
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,556
I'm on it. I'll take
care of it, I promise.

180
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:33,391
All right?

181
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,128
Hey, Rosie, in 10 years,

182
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,488
remind me to never have any kids.

183
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,358
[Rosie] Are you sure
you want to schedule that?

184
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,787
See, even Rosie knows your full of it.

185
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:51,039
[notification buzzing]

186
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:54,138
Wait, what party? Whose party?

187
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,528
It's Claire! Would you chill?

188
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,018
Two days before Christmas. Just the girls.

189
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,248
Two days before Christmas?

190
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,698
Why can't you have a party with me?

191
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,168
We'll wrap presents, shop for
more presents, wrap those.

192
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,348
I'll give you a sip of mommy's egg nog.

193
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,181
I'm 15.

194
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:12,423
I wanna go to a 15-year-old
party with regular egg nog.

195
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:17,258
Abby, please, be my
little Christmas angel.

196
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,368
I'm not your Christmas angel.

197
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,628
I'm your puppet.

198
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,628
Pull the strings and I do what you say.

199
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,558
Pull this string and I do all the laundry.

200
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,158
Pull this string and I stay locked up

201
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,488
in my room like some medieval hostage.

202
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,790
- Don't be so dramatic.
- Look in the mirror!

203
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,878
Abby, please, please.

204
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,978
You know what I'm up against.

205
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,166
Come on. You thrive on it.

206
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:42,168
[Diane gasping]

207
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,728
Hey, I can see your bra in that shirt.

208
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,078
- Put something on under it.
- Shh.

209
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,758
This could be a real game changer for me.

210
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,328
No, I know, it's a great project.

211
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,308
Ah, come on, you know me.

212
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,438
- Of course I'm gonna deliver.
- Oh my gosh.

213
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,318
You're delivering, too?

214
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,433
We have something in common.

215
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,878
Listen, if I nail
this deal, right, Diane,

216
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,988
I make partner, okay?

217
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,384
And then think about it, and you-

218
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:04,217
- But I miss you.
- I know.

219
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:05,548
I miss you, too. But listen.

220
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,638
Then you can get the help around here

221
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,918
that you always wanted, all right?

222
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,790
All right, Granny's here.
[horn honking]

223
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:17,293
Oh, great. That's Jane.

224
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,178
On time, reporting for duty.

225
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,880
- Hi, Jane.
- Don't call me that.

226
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,398
What's with the chili?

227
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,718
Diane, it's 81 degrees in Punta Cana.

228
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,588
Ah, doesn't that sound wonderful?

229
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,668
Oh my gosh, that beachfront?

230
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,998
Yeah. Umbrella drinks on the beach.

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,078
- Spa?
- Spa day.

232
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,315
Do you think they'll
let chili on the plane?

233
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:43,678
It could have my seat.

234
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,838
Honey, honey, you've
got everything handled.

235
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,878
- You've got this.
- No, I don't got this.

236
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,968
But that's okay, go jet set with Kate.

237
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,968
- Really? I can go?
- No, you can't go!

238
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,318
What's wrong with you?

239
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,178
My husband and my daughter
have completely abandoned me.

240
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,678
You're not going anywhere.

241
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,038
As you wish, my dear.

242
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,248
You still want the chili, right?

243
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,699
- Yes.
- Morning, Jane.

244
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,178
- Morning.
- Later, Jane.

245
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,873
- Nana's here.
- Nana!

246
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:09,548
- Hi.
- Why are you here?

247
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,918
Oh, I came to say bon voyage

248
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,928
and grab your mother's sun hat,

249
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,618
but now I guess I'm helping.

250
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,318
Hey, soldier, if you eat your breakfast

251
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,778
in five minutes, we're
gonna get you to school.

252
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,611
Check and check.

253
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,763
- You can go on your trip now.
- No, she can't, Abby.

254
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:26,848
Hey! 0845, that's in 15 minutes, people.

255
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,988
Hurry up, double time. Quick!

256
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,376
Yeah.

257
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:33,751
[laughs] They love it when I do that.

258
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,238
I love it when you do that.

259
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,695
There you go. Another blue one.

260
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:38,697
Thank you.

261
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:42,583
- Where's my phone?
- You're kidding?

262
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:43,416
No, I'm not kidding you.

263
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,709
Thought it's glued to your face.

264
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:45,691
Diane, will you just help me out?

265
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:47,558
- Get it together.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,188
Get married they said, have
some kids, yeah, bla bla

267
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,021
- Hey, Dad?
- What?

268
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:53,358
I have a sleep over party. I need to go.

269
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,218
I lost my phone. Help me out, all right?

270
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,051
- Come on!
- Come on.

271
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:58,378
- Mom said it's up to you!
- Yo, let's go!

272
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,054
- I already have to pee again.
- I just knew you

273
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:01,078
were driving me crazy!

274
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,528
Look, you live here for free.

275
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,058
- Help me find my phone.
- Mom said it's up to you.

276
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,778
Look, you know your mother, okay?

277
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,548
Nothing is ever, ever
up to me in this house.

278
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,208
My entire social life depends on you.

279
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,208
Aren't you the top
salesman at your company?

280
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,748
You're always saying you
can sell anything to anyone.

281
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,550
Whatever you do there, do it on Mom.

282
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:22,614
- All right, Abby?
- Do you wanna play?

283
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:23,664
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's play a game.

284
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,497
You wanna play? I'll play with you.

285
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:25,678
- Yeah?
- Give me that phone.

286
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,511
- Look-
- Come on.

287
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:28,608
Social is your mother's
department, okay?

288
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,531
We have different
departments. You know that.

289
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,528
- It's on the list everywhere.
- Please, Dad!

290
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,358
Look, just do me a
favor. Give me the phone.

291
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,058
Right, give me the phone
and I promise you I will

292
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,838
give it my best shot, okay?

293
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,689
I promise you.
[phone buzzing]

- Answer it.
- Hey, Grandpa.

- Yeah, yeah.
- Abby!

296
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,850
- How you doing?
- Give me the phone.

297

Oh my God, is that really you?

- Love you, Dad.
- Yeah, that was Abby, yeah.

She still giving you crap all the time?

300
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,640
Oh my God, you have no idea.

[horn honking]

302
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:05,318
- Hey, Dad. How are ya?
- And how well can I be?

303
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,392
72 hours ago, they gave me a new hip.

304
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:09,822
I can't really do this right now, Dad.

305
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:10,874
We're late. Can I call you later?

306
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:13,060
They give me a physical therapist.

307
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,258
And I get here and I look up

308
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,531
and his office is on the
third floor of a walk-up.

309
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,048
I really can't do this right now, Dad.

310
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,968
- You're not listening to me.
- So, with a broken hip,

311
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,828
I gotta walk up to my physical therapist.

312
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,378
- How's that for math?
- Actually, you know what?

313
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,983
Your daughter-in-law wants to have you.

314
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:30,074
And how are you, madam?

315
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:31,565
Yeah, we're getting divorced.

316
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,398
No, I'm kidding. We're
going to the doctor.

317
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,853
We gotta go. Bye, bye, bye.

318
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,943
Left me holding the phone.

319
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,483
I've been dumped on by kings.

[doctor humming]

321
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,838
Look in the mirror and
tell yourself you can.

322
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,863
You can.

324
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,298
Okay, well, I found some happiness

325
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,508
because this is my
favorite part of the day.

326
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,078
- Well, that's sad.
- Well, Diane,

327
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,518
after this I got lunch, which
is just tuna on whole wheat.

328
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,488
And then tonight it's reruns

329
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,588
of "Out in the Wild,
Unplugged, A Survivor's Tale".

330
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,068
So yes, this is the most
exciting part of my day.

331
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,833
Will you stop.

332
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,565
- Okay, here we go.
- Sorry.

333
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,098
A little goopla there.

334
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,693
- And off we-
- Come on. Come on.

335
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,328
Brian, mm-hmm.

336
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,288
- Yeah. See it?
- What?

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,805
Dee, dee, dee. Dee, dee.

00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:48,328
Dee, dee. Und dee.

339
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,988
That's still a thing? I didn't notice.

340
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,548
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Still in effect.

341
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,903
Okay, here we go.

342
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,448
Gees, hey, Brian, do you
wanna drive over here?

343
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,488
I don't need to do this.

344
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,418
- I mean, who am I?
- I don't-

345
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,048
- I can go out and I can order bedpans.

346
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,881
Okay. You know what?

347
00:16:03,883 --> 00:16:05,555
I'll be back. Just give me,
just give me two seconds, okay?

348
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:07,238
- Brian!
- Yeah, Brian, come on.

349
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,848

- Such an ass.
- I don't get this guy.

352
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,178
Why is it always just
two seconds with him?

353
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,988
- Sometimes he lasts longer.
- I pray that's true

354
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,368
for your sake.

355
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,775
- Oh! Sapless winter!
- What?

356
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:25,235
Just joking. I'm joking.

357
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:28,545
Oh, you're awful. How could you?

358
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:31,628
- You're 37 weeks.
- Oh, well what about

359
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,878
- the pains I've been having?
- You mean your husband?

360
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,788
Yes, and my daughter.

361
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,508
Now that you mention it,
my sister, my mother,

362
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,208

and his two perfect kids

363
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,868
- across the street, Shelly.
- Wait a second.

364
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,068
Are you talking about your daughter, Abby?

365

- My Abby?
- Yes, Tom, help. Help me.

God, that was a hell birth for me.

Do you remember I had to
use forceps to get her out?

- Yeah.
- I mean,

369
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:59,148
I pulled a hamstring
pulling that kid outta you.

370
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,488
- She is a tough gal.
- I know. Relentless.

Otherwise we might have to do the C word

377

- to get him outta here.
- Oh, no.

- Him?
- Well-

382
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:28,008
- Is this is a boy?
- Yeah, I can't tell 100%

take this home with you.

because it's me vocalizing.

Is he insane?

411
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,608
I mean, I should have him disbarred

412
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,656
- or whatever you call that.
- Revoke his medical license.

413
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:43,568
- Yeah. That.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.

perfect Walters' Christmas.

It's a maybe.

It depends on how useful you could be.

- On your phone.

average out the last four,

Speaking of sleep, sleepovers
are great for sleep, right?

524
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,953
- Mm-hmm, yep. Yep, yep.
- Yeah.

525
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:21,190
Hang on a second.

526
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:22,288
What are we talking about right now?

527
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,488
Oh, nothing. Just sit down and enjoy.

528
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,158
- You deserve it.
- Sup, champ?

529
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,273
- Sit down.
- Mm, pancakes.

530
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:31,252
Mm-hmm.

531
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,467
Whoa, this is a production.

532
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,518
You better eat fast, man.

533
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,978
I wanna get going. It's gonna
be nuts out there today.

534
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,138
- Yeah.
- I want to, like,

535
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,418
throw down with another
mom in the toy section,

536
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,018
- you know what I'm saying?
- That sounds amazing.

537
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,158
- What is that?
- Bedrest, Mom.

538
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,668
It means plenty of rest. Here.

539
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,408
- Ooh.
- Fresh kale, spinach,

540
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,878
agave nectar, and a splash of cinnamon.

541
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,198
- Disgusting.
- Unbelievable.

542
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,998
You need your strength.

543
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,398
And the kale is good for
smoothing out fine lines.

544
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,428
- You guys want more?
- Well, you dad's gonna have

545
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,829
to take it to go, 'cause we're leaving.

546
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:12,528
- Yeah.
- I've been slaving

547
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,598
over this breakfast since 6:00 AM.

548
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,638
Now, don't you care enough about me

549
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,548
to let me go to that party, yes or no?

550
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,186
- Come on.
- I care about you so much.

551
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,548
- Me, too.
- My answer is no.

552
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,062
No way.

553
00:25:25,064 --> 00:25:26,731
Thanks for breakfast.

554
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:32,629
Okay, your sister's nuts.
You know that, right?

555
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,464
Yeah.

556
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:35,855
Hey, would you do
yourself a favor, please,

557
00:25:35,857 --> 00:25:38,358
- and call your sister?
- She tried to hijack Jane

558
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,598
to another country.

559
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,433
Forget it.

560
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,033
Whew.

561
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,701
Whew.

562
00:25:45,703 --> 00:25:46,560
- Whoa.
- What is it?

563
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,440
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

564
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:51,652
No, no, look at me.

565
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:53,098
- You know what?
- I'm good. I'm good.

566
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,908
- Have some water. See-
- That was interesting.

567
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,310
You're stressing the baby out.

568
00:25:56,312 --> 00:25:57,143
You're stressing everybody out.

569
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:57,978
- Okay.
- Come on, just take this.

570
00:26:02,434 --> 00:26:05,831
[phone ringing]

571
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:09,203
- Hold on a sec. I'm getting a call.
- Oh, no, don't answer it.

572
00:26:09,205 --> 00:26:10,758
- No, you know.
- Don't do it!

573
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,548
Go get some eggs. I'll meet
you over there, all right?

574
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,568
Brian, my boy.

575
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,958
We're checking in on
ya. The team's all here.

576
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,748
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

577
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,058
We haven't gotten the latest figures yet,

578
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,523
but if you need any of my
help, I'm here for you.

579
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,882
- [loud scratching]
- Hello?

580
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:33,087
[imitating static]

581
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:35,135
He's on the toilet?

582
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:38,448
- Sounds like it.
- I really, really can't talk.

583
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,281
- Okay?
- Nevermind,

584
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:40,114
we're out of time.

585
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:42,808
Pack your bags. You can
finish on the plane.

586
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,333
Give it up, Walters.

587
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,310
Ignore that. We'll see you tomorrow.

588
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,940
[Brian] Really?

589
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,103
It's come to this.

590
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,268
What was that?

591
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,848
What was what?

592
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,748
It was like you were humping the tree.

593
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,200
What was going on over there?

594
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,298
- I don't know.
- Oh my gosh, what?

595
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,495
This might not be the
time to tell you this.

596
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,565
- Oh, it's the time.
- Are you sure

597
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,988
- you wanna hear this?
- It's the time. Bring it.

598
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,318
- Okay, you know the-
- Give it to me.

599
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,288
- Bring it.
- You know

600
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,658
that production line down in Texas?

601
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,004
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, the merger?

602
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:25,638
- Uh-huh.
- Is-

603
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,778
- Big stuff.
- Yeah, it's not

604
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,335
going so well and they need me down there

605
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:30,973
- and I can't say no.
- Oh.

606
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,133
Oh, you're going to Texas. [laughs]

607
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:41,538
I'm really sorry about this.

608
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,328
You're going to Texas?

609
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,593
You know what?

610
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:49,145
That makes me, I gotta put
on the happy faces for this.

611
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,938
- No, no, no, don't.
- Chin up, chin up.

612
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,083
I mean, this is a happy, happy, happy,

613
00:27:56,772 --> 00:28:00,270
here it comes, there's your happy face.

614
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:02,851
Put our happy faces on.

615
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:05,838
Face on.

616
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,643
Texas, woo!

617
00:28:08,596 --> 00:28:10,496
I don't know if Texas is ready for you.

618
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,638
- I'm sorry.
- I'm done with you.

619
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,793
Texas can have you.

620
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,423
Texas.

621
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:20,193
- Honestly.
- Clean up on aisle four.

622
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,968
One of my most important jobs is

623
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,958
finding the special
moments to carry the family

624
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,793
through it all.

625
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,408
What better way to spend
an evening than with Santa?

626
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,968
It's Christmas.

627
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,720
All right, maybe for Dougie's sake.

628
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:40,608
All right, let's do this. Yeah?

629
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,618
Santa. Yay, so excited.

630
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,888
Can we get this over with?
I've got things to do.

631
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,848
That's the spirit I'm looking for.

632
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,093
Come on, guys.

633
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,156
Have you decided if I can go?

634
00:28:51,158 --> 00:28:53,508
Can you tell my why
it's so important to you?

635
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:56,534
- There's a boy I like.
- Oh, a boy, okay.

636
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:58,608
- Yeah, great.
- All right.

637
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,908
It's no big deal. We're just friends.

638
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,718
It's kind of a big deal.

639
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,553
You like him?

640
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,783
Walters!

641
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,938
Early bird gets the Santa. [cackling]

642
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,838
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

643
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,208
Hot chocolate! Can you take me, please?

644
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,338
All right. Swirly chocolate syrup?

645
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,998
- Yes!
- Extra cherries?

646
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,318
- Yes!
- Come on.

647
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,937
Really?

648
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:26,145
Wow, unbelievable.

649
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:28,559
[sighs] It's okay.

650
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:32,236
Hey, listen, why don't
we just go home, right?

651
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,518
Put on a Christmas video instead?

652
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,408
- I mean, look at this line.
- No, you're gonna wait

653
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,473
- in that line.
- I really

654
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,758
- don't wanna wait here.
- I'll get us a hot chocolate.

655
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,398
If you're lucky, I'll get
you some more whipped cream.

656
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,538
I think I've had just
about enough of that.

657
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,540
- Have you?
- Yeah.

658
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,261
- Well.
- All right.

659
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:46,763
- Get in line.
- I'll race you.

660
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:51,157
[people chattering]

661
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,248
Hey, tough guy.

662
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,868
Aren't you supposed to
be somewhere right now?

663
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,768
- Nope. Union break.
- Union?

664
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,028
They got a union for this? For real?

665
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,368
Hey, look, nobody's going
anywhere in that line.

666
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,183
Sit down. Come on.

667
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,563
Yeah, been a card carrying
member since 1973.

668
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,818
Even got an award last year.

669
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,307
- Got a problem with that?
- No, no problem.

670
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,638
I mean, that just makes
perfect sense right about now.

671
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,140
- Yeah, I thought so.
- Yeah.

672
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,678
I got a bedazzled plaque hanging right

673
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,893
over the fireplace.

674
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,708
You should come over and see it sometime.

675
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,960
You gotta be joking me.

676
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:37,128
Actually, I'm a little
too busy waiting out here

677
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,468
on line for someone to go to work.

678
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,693
- Time's up, Sydney.
- Beat it, Denny.

679
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,028
I got two more minutes left.

680
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,958
- Come on, you're killing me.
- You mean he's killing us.

681
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,218
- Come on.
- We're not

682
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,528
going into overtime.

683
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,838
Come on, chug it. Let's go.

684
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,888
Come on.
[Sydney burping]

685
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,218
That's nice. Really nice.

686
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,158
There's kids around here, you know?

687
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,838
- All right, showtime.
- Oh, God almighty.

688
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,218
That's disgusting, Rumples...

689
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,508
- You catching Rumplemints?
- Yeah, that and a corn dog.

690
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,748
That's disgusting. Ah.

691
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,629
Come on. You keep an eye on him.

692
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:05,776
- Make it two, okay?
- You ready?

693
00:31:05,778 --> 00:31:06,631
- Come on.
- Yeah.

694
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:09,018
- All right, come on.
- You weren't in line?

Terrible, Tom. It's terrible. [laughs]

872
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:49,321
[frantic music]

873
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,408
I thought Toby was
supposed to be joining us.

874
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,323
He'll be here.

875
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,320
Do you have any leftover lunch?

876
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,008
- You're hungry?
- Yes.

877
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,623
- Quick, give it to me.
- So bossy.

878
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,273
Hi, girl. Hello.

879
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:10,888
[groans] Are you that Shelly fellow?

880
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,778
Yes!

881
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,638
Yes, is this your office's definition

882
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,478
of an emergency situation?

883
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,458
I'll have you know, I'm HOA president

884
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,598
of this peaceful little hamlet,

885
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,378
and I'm gonna be taking
this up with the mayor.

886
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,018
I need that dog taken out
of this park immediately.

887
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,272
- You got that, Chuck?
- All right.

888
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,838
- Can you do that?
- Gave up breakfast

889
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,748
for this, I'm starving!

890
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,918
I have a few questions for ya.

891
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,098
Does the canine have dilated pupils,

892
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,158
lack of fear, showing aggression?

893
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,818
- Like, [yells] coming at ya.
- Okay, you know what?

894
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,158
Unfortunately, I don't have a degree

895
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,838
in canine psychology, so I
don't know how the dog feels.

896
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,671
Why don't you just give me this.

897
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:43,148
- Okay. Hey, that's my stick.
- Let's get a little quicker.

898
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,978
- That's my stick.
- I know it's your stick.

899
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,597
But I'm doing this, all right?

900
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:51,298
- Hey, Walters? Take it and-
- Give me my stick.

901
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,758
Walters! Walters, don't
you dare make a move!

902
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,998
No, this is my dog.

903
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,848
Why don't you back off
and go save some turtles,

904
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,753
because you're not touching her.

905
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:01,586
You know what?

906
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:02,419
If you would have read my flyer,

907
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:04,758
you'd know I took care of
that turtle issue a week ago.

908
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,428
So why don't you hand over the dog?

909
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,158
No chance.

910
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,496
- You got a turtle issue?
- No.

911
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:12,103
- Go. Go!
- We got a runner!

912
00:42:13,022 --> 00:42:15,005
[Chase music]

913
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,743
Please, what you're doing is illegal!

914
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:25,185
- I'm gonna go this way!
- All right!

915
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,600
Stupid shoes!

916
00:42:35,538 --> 00:42:37,256
- My knight!
- Hurry!

917
00:42:37,258 --> 00:42:38,278
I gotta get my Dad's car back

918
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,413
- before he gets up for work.
- Great.

919
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:42,082
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

920
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:46,082
- [tires squealing]
- Dammit!

921
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:48,534
I can't run in this
handmade alpaca skin shoes!

922
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,410
Quick-legged, canine-loving little fart.

923
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,193
Sorry, what?

924
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,368
Where does she think she's going?

925
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,631
If she's going back to her house,

926
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:58,393
I think she's royally screwed.

927
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,068
- You want some?
- Aw, do I want a banana?

928
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,903
No!

929
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,208
- I'm potassium intolerant.
- Hey, I would have

930
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,168
eaten that banana.

931
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,923
I'm hungry. I haven't had lunch.

932
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,035
There's a fruit stand on sixth.

933
00:43:12,037 --> 00:43:14,458
I'm going past it if
you wanna walk with me.

934
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,903
Yeah.

935
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:17,728
- I'm starving.
- I'm just, I'm in ketosis.

936
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,108
- I can't eat sugar.
- Did you say you're

937
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,898
- looking for an alpaca?
- No, I have-

938
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,000
- I have alpacas, if you need 'em.

939
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,654
- Abby, I can't hear you!
- The dog is starving.

940
00:43:29,656 --> 00:43:31,014
- [indistinct]
- Abby!

941
00:43:31,016 --> 00:43:33,143
- Hello, can you hear me?
- Okay.

942
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:35,448
The dog is [indistinct].

943
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,228
Are you on this flight?
Are you business class?

944
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,683
I need you to board now or clear the area.

945
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:49,181
[Christmas music]

946
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:07,514
[dramatic music]

947
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:09,168
[throat clearing throat]
[Diane shrieking]

948
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,008
Diane, what are you doing here?

949
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:14,398
- You caught me red-handed.
- Yeah,

950
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,488
disobeying doctor's orders, huh?

951
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,048
- Yeah, sorry.
- Diane.

952
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,485
- I'm sorry.
- Diane.

953
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:23,258
I have to get a tree, Tom!

954
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,928
Well, you don't want one of these.

955
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:25,783
- No?
- No.

956
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:28,458
Are you kidding? These are the rejects.

957
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,658
These are the misfits, the degenerates

958
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,568
of the Christmas tree underworld,

959
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,578
left to rot until they're
minced up into kitty litter.

960
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,178
- No good. You know that.
- I don't know that, Tom.

961
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,098
- Now you know.
- Excellent conifer, Tom!

962
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,958
- 200 bucks!
- 200 bucks?

963
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,608
Yeah, you got a problem with that?

964
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:52,008
Fine, you can keep the ax head.

965
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,938
You're gonna need some
WD-40, though, to pry it out.

966
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,608
- But you can keep it.
- 125.

967
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,510
- 80 bucks.
- Oh, okay, I'll take it.

968
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:01,933
Have a merry Christmas, Tom!

969
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:05,178
And a fine day to you, smiley lady.

970
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,798
Forget about the trees.

971
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,678
Come here, follow me.

972
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,013
I got something really
good to show you. Come on.

973
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:13,827
Oh.

974
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:15,808
Oh, wow.

975
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,418
- Yeah.
- They are something.

976
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,418
I make these myself.

977
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,573
Aren't they beautiful?

978
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,998
What I do is I think about
what I wanna do first,

979
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,607
'cause I'm a thinker to being with.

980
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:28,440
[chainsaw grinding]
And then I get a piece

981
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:29,579
of paper, a pad and a pencil,

982
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:31,821
[drowned out by chainsaw]

983
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:32,871
and what I do, I don't
know if you can see it,

984
00:45:32,873 --> 00:45:35,478
I make arms out of twigs, arm twigs.

985
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,568
And I go, ooh, okay, I'm
gonna need some stuff

986
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,318
from the hobby store.

987
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,392
Because the hobby store really

988
00:45:40,394 --> 00:45:42,621
[drowned out by chainsaw]
and kind of addictive.

989
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:44,178
I mean, once you start
working with a hot glue gun,

990
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,165
you don't wanna stop
working with a hot glue gun.

991
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:48,328
[drowned out by chainsaw]

992
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,773
Angela's my best seller.

993
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,278
I'd like you to have Angela.

994
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,498
- Oh, Tom, I couldn't.
- Yes.

995
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,891
- Okay, well, for the kids.
- It's for a good cause.

996
00:45:58,893 --> 00:45:59,724
There you go.

997
00:45:59,726 --> 00:46:00,557
- Oh, Angela.
- Thank you very much.

998
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,478
Hey, mister, guess
what? Your angels suck!

999
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,608
I don't think he meant that.

1000
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,683
I mean, I love kids.

1001
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:09,603
Bullseye!

1002
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,848
You little brats!

1003
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,328
If I get you, I'm gonna hang you up

1004
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,348
by your Buster Browns!

1005
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,708
Kids'll be kids, huh?

1006
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,906
Good seeing you, Diane. We gotta go, guys.

1007
00:46:19,908 --> 00:46:22,008
Put 'em back in the cage, Shelly.

1008
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,418
Shelly. [scoffs]

1009
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,068
- Girl's name.
- Yeah. Right?

1010
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:25,901
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1011
00:46:25,903 --> 00:46:28,137
Oh, Tom, look at you.

1012
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:28,970
- Thanks.
- Look at you.

1013
00:46:28,972 --> 00:46:30,955
- Oh, you don't deserve that.
- Diane.

1014
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:33,148
- You're so good.
- You're so nice.

1015
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,978
I wanna give you something else.

1016
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,655
- So weird.
- Take a look at this.

1017
00:46:36,657 --> 00:46:39,633
Oh, oh, Tom, I just can't take any more

1018
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:41,828
- from you.
- Oh, you are gonna take this.

1019
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,348
This is "Dr. Tom Sings Christmas".

1020
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,308
- Oh.
- And I want you to have this.

1021
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,888
- Oh.
- Okay, come on, take it.

1022
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,298
It's gonna relax you.
You're gonna love it.

1023
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,778
- Oh.
- Hey, and it's on the house.

1024
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,117
- Okay?
- Oh, Tom.

1025
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,328
All right, now you get home
and you get some bedrest.

1026
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,468
- All right.
- All right.

1027
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,858
- Thank you.
- Next time I see you,

1028
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,268
I wanna see you in bed.

1029
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:03,138
I didn't mean that. You know what I meant.

1030
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,857
- I know what you meant.
- Good luck with the tree.

1031
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:08,633
Thank you.
[Tom sighs]

1032

Christmas.

1033
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,028
All right, so I just want,

1034
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,888
take everything out,
lay it out, take stock.

1035
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,368
We're probably gonna
need more extension cords

1036
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,910
- for all these lights.
- You think?

1037
00:47:21,912 --> 00:47:24,051
Oh, what is, this is hideous.

1038
00:47:24,053 --> 00:47:26,310
Don't lift anything.

1039
00:47:26,312 --> 00:47:28,458
[Jane grumbling]

1040
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,960
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1041
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,523
What's up, Shelly?

1042
00:47:33,439 --> 00:47:36,188
Come on, did I break an
HOA rule you just made up?

1043
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,568
I'm just trying to be neighborly here.

1044
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:41,193
But you hiding anything from me, Walters?

1045
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,308
How many watts you putting up this year?

1046
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,048
Enough to blow your mind.

1047
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,650
- I could do this all day.
- Huh?

1048
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,578
Look, I don't have
time for this, all right?

1049
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,808
What is going on? What is it?

1050
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:57,798
Stray dog.

1051
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,278
It has been hanging out at the park

1052
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,798
across the street from the school.

1053
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,848
And it is my job as current president

1054
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,738
to keep everybody safe,
including you, Diane.

1055
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,918
I feel safer already.

1056
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,188
What does this have to do with me?

1057
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,178
Abby was seen at the
park earlier with that dog.

1058
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,638
And when I confronted her about it,

1059
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,438
she hopped into a car, sped outta there

1060
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,778
like a bat outta heck.

1061
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,128
And I just thought you
should know about it.

1062
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,068
Okay, you have finally
lose your ever-loving mind

1063
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:27,078
because Abby is at a
friend's house studying.

1064
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,262
I'm not so sure about that.

1065
00:48:29,264 --> 00:48:30,518
Might wanna follow-up on your kids.

1066
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,896
Anyway, I gotta get
going. I have a meeting.

1067
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:36,058
- It was great talking with you.
- Jane.

1068
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,978
Hey, that's not huge.

1069
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,628
- Jane.
- What, what, what?

1070
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,308
We're gonna need some extra
extension cords after all.

1071
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,348
Yeah, to tie him up with,

1072
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:50,350
roast him over a pit of
fire like the pig he is.

1073
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,208
Hey, Dougie, you wanna
go with me to the store?

1074
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,088
Mom needs to go inside and relax.

1075
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:57,921
Come on, let's go.

1076
00:48:57,923 --> 00:48:59,528
We gotta go buy some more stuff.

Yep.

Okay, great timing as usual.

1082

I'm in the middle of a crisis.

just didn't sit right

license, and take your dog.

of you guys here again.

you should have done.

Abby is my daughter.

1193
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,233
She doesn't need a BFF.
She needs a mother.

- Why would you do that?
- It is not about

1195

the damn dog, Diane.

Can you please go wait inside for us?

- Okay.
- All right.

00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,873
I'm sorry.

- No party?
- No. No party.

- What about my phone?
- Hand it over.

1205

Fine, you win again. Happy now?

1206
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,113
No, I'm not happy. At all.

1207

I'm not happy.

1208
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,578
The most important thing
between us is trust.

1209
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:58,198
You have to be able to tell me the truth.

1210
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,208
Like, especially if you're in trouble.

1211
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:02,548
So you never made mistakes?

1212
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,738
You've never lied?

1213
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,558
I had to, okay?

1214
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,408
And for the record, I'm not sorry.

1215
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,088
So take my phone, ground me for life.

1216
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:14,673
I don't give a shit!

1217
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:16,468
- Yeah-
- Abby.

1218
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:19,708
Yeah. And I curse all the
time when you're not around.

1219
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,541
You know what?

1220
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,728
That animal is going to
the shelter in the morning.

1221
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,378
Take him, give him to your grandmother.

1222
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,258
She'll know what to do,

1223
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,908
and you get your ass in your room.

1224
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,678
- Now! I'm done.
- Yeah?

1225
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,153
Well, I'm done with you, too!

1226
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,913
Come here.

1227
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,713
Let's go, buddy.

1228
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,153
What the hell?

1229
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,561
[soft music]

1230
00:57:04,593 --> 00:57:05,913
- Hey.
- Hey.

1231
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,381
- Mom?
- What?

1232
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,990
I'm leaving.

1233
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:12,951
The heck are you talking
about, you're leaving?

1234
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:15,468
- [Abby sobbing]
- A doggy for Christmas?

1235
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,368
Oh my God, whose dog
is it? Are you okay?

1236
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,988
- Look, there's a dog here.
- You're the best sister ever.

1237
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,311
- No, I'm not.
- I love you.

1238
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,838
Oh my, whose dog is this?

1239
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,468
- Oh my God, this dog smells.
- Mom, did you hear

1240
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,598
- what I said?
- Dougie?

1241
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,348
Dougie, honey, could you go upstairs,

1242
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,181
you get ready for bed,

1243
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:33,918
and I'll bring doggy up to
tuck you in with me, okay?

1244
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,763
Okay.

1245
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,898
- Bye, Dougie.
- You're leaving?

1246
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,348
Where do you think you're going?

1247
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,898
I tried to make things better between us

1248
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,938
and I screwed up and I made
things worse, much worse.

1249
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,938
Okay, can you just stick it out just

1250
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,918
for a little while longer, please?

1251
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,738
Look, she doesn't want me here, Mom.

1252
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,033
That is not true.
She's just under, wait-

1253
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:51,701
- Mom.
- She's under a lot

1254
00:57:51,703 --> 00:57:52,534
of pressure right now.

1255
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:54,288
- And whose dog is this?
- Would you stop

1256
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,268
taking her side for once?

1257
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,003
I'm your daughter, too, you know?

1258
00:57:58,005 --> 00:57:58,995
I know, I know.

1259
00:57:58,997 --> 00:58:00,438
And where are you gonna stay?

1260
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,068
I'll stay at the hotel in town tonight.

1261
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,118
And then tomorrow I'm going on my trip.

1262
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,638
- Wait, I got, wait.
- Merry Christmas, Mom.

1263
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,538
Oh, come on. No, come on, pumpkin!

1264
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,617
[Kate] Don't call me
pumpkin. You know I hate that!

1265
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:13,028
Okay, fine, Petunia.

1266
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:16,054
Come on, Katie. Kate!

1267
00:58:16,056 --> 00:58:16,889
What?

1268
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:24,768
What did you do to Nick the reindeer?

1269
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,263
He didn't do anything to you.

1270
00:58:34,568 --> 00:58:36,901
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1271
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:10,388
[clock ticking]

1272
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:15,698
[Dr.Tom muffled by mask]

1273
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,628
What's going on down there?

1274
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,739
You know I can't understand
you under that mask.

1275
00:59:19,741 --> 00:59:22,241
[Tom yelling]

1276
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:25,416
- Get off me!
- What?

1277
00:59:25,418 --> 00:59:28,125
[Dr.Tom laughing]
Get outta there!

1278
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,853
I'm just joshing with ya.

1279
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,718
- Everything looks great.
- Yeah, and?

1280
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,018
Yeah, you're 3.5 centimeters.

1281
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,268
The old train has left the station.

1282
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:41,578
Oh, no, don't say that.

1283
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,158
What? The joke my rabbi told me?

1284
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,168
The train. I can't have this baby.

1285
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:48,288
I'm not ready, Tom. Not before Christmas.

1286
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,888
I'm not. I mean, can't you do
something to slow this down?

1287
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:53,308
Don't you know some, make
some kind of sound or-

1288
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,358
- Okay, yeah, sure.

1289
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,238
I can get into a time
machine and push pause,

1290
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,978
- but I-
- Yeah, I doubt we can.

1291
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,648
Listen, Diane, this is the
best part of the pregnancy.

1292
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,688
At least it is for me.

1293
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:08,113
The delivery, it's far too much pressure.

1294
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,928
And if that doesn't work,

1295
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:13,556
maybe a banjo and a set
of pliers'll do the trick.

1296
01:00:13,558 --> 01:00:15,588
- Banjos and a set of pliers?
- Yeah.

1297
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:16,848
It's an old world technique.

1298
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:17,681
It goes way back.

1299
01:00:17,683 --> 01:00:19,218
My father handed it down to me,

1300
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,578
his father handed it down to him,

1301
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,658
his father handed it down to him,

1302
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,658
but it's been banned
in, like, 17 countries,

1303
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,208
so it's not in popular use.

1304
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,338
So the point I'm trying

1305
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,513
to make is that if you
need help, just ask.

1306
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,798
Do you know where I can find
a Speed Diamond race track,

1307
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,188
because they're sold out everywhere.

1308
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,098
- Everywhere.
- Okay,

1309
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,218
you're not getting it are you?

1310
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,866
Let's close our eyes. Close 'em.

1311
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:44,305
- No, don't make me do it.
- Close those eyes.

1312
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:48,067
- Tom, I don't have time.
- And let's breathe in,

1313
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:51,042
and out, and hum.
[both humming]

1314
01:00:51,044 --> 01:00:51,877
And breathe.

1315
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:54,683
Just twice.

1316
01:00:57,450 --> 01:01:01,283
Good. Open your eyes, look at me slowly.

1317
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,093
Yeah.

1318
01:01:04,419 --> 01:01:05,252
How do you feel?

1319
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:11,153
Old, tired, bloated.

1320
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:15,808
Got some serious cravings. Snails.

1321
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:18,178
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

1322
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,658
Except for the part about the snails.

1323
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,323
They're the carpet baggers of the sea.

1324
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,298
But you know what the really good news is?

1325
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,448
The next time you see me,

1326
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,253
I'll have my catcher's mitt on.

1327
01:01:34,422 --> 01:01:36,589
[humming]

1328
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:41,513
[loud smacking]
[imitating crying]

1329
01:01:41,515 --> 01:01:44,751
Thanks, Tom. I needed that.

1330
01:01:44,753 --> 01:01:46,223
I know. I did, too.

1331
01:01:47,555 --> 01:01:50,518
[upbeat music]

1332
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,598
I feel good. I went through
the numbers up and down,

1333
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,011
right, and I can't see how they'd say no.

1334
01:01:54,013 --> 01:01:55,768
I think it's really an amazing,

1335
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,668
it's an amazing plan.

1336
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,448
That's exactly what
I wanna hear, Walters.

1337
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,803
Or should I say partner?

1338
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:09,130
It's got a nice ring to it, right?

1339
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,823
So would nice bump up would
sound pretty good, too.

1340
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:15,808
[both laughing]

1341
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:16,643
Nice.

1342
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,053
Yes, I admire a man who
knows what he wants.

1343
01:02:27,763 --> 01:02:30,346
[Brian coughs]

1344
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,758
You serious about this?

1345
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,693
I put you through hell
and back and you survived.

1346
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,323
Unless you tank tomorrow.

1347
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,608
But you won't. You're my ace.

1348
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,218
Yeah. I gotta call my wife.

1349
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,638
Okay, but first, you are
aware that I'm gonna need you

1350
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,600
to be based in the London office?

1351
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,093
[laughs] Yeah, nice.

1352
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:59,743
- Wait, what?
- Six to nine months, tops.

1353
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,173
Think about it.

1354
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,910
I need your answer tomorrow
after the presentation.

1355
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,418
Well done, Walters. Congrats.

1356
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,458
Yeah, thanks Stu.

1357
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:18,418
Hey, over there, I mean
to ask you about Mary,

1358
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,418
the kids, and Ben.

1359
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,333
Did he make all county?

1360
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,970
I wouldn't know. I been
stuck down here for months.

1361
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,420
See you in the morning. Get some rest.

1362
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:35,916
[Christmas rock music]

1363
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,792
[phone ringing]

1364
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,713
Oh, hey, Brian.

1365
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:13,358
Well, Kate showed up. So thanks for that.

1366
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,008
And I don't know how to
repair the past, though.

1367
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,448
She's gone now.

1368
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:22,228
And let's see, Abby got
arrested with that Smith kid,

1369
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,578
Toby, down the block.

1370
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,898
So I bailed 'em out for 300 bucks

1371
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,008
and now she hates me
even more than before.

1372
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:29,458
So that's awesome.

1373
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,350
And to top it off, I've got a stray dog.

1374
01:04:33,352 --> 01:04:35,768
It's actually dog-napped, in the mud room,

1375
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:38,688
that Dougie thinks is
his Christmas present

1376
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:41,568
until I have to get rid of it tomorrow.

1377
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:45,348
So that's, like, oh,
I can't wait for that.

1378
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:47,063
But how's it going for you?

1379
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,988
Empathy, Brian. I know it's hard for you.

1380
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:55,648
But just put yourself in my shoes

1381
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:59,658
and maybe it will occur to
you that you should be here

1382
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,563
dealing with some of this stuff.

1383
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,498
Now I'm hanging up on you. I love you.

1384
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,333
Bye.

1385
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:27,890
I'm gonna put the star up to surprise Dad.

1386
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:34,113
[dog barking]

1387
01:05:34,115 --> 01:05:36,354
- Fred, get off!
- Fred, get off of her!

1388
01:05:36,356 --> 01:05:41,356
Watch out!
[loud crashing]

1389
01:05:42,114 --> 01:05:44,968
- What the hell happened?
- Are you okay?

1390
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:46,788
- Honey, what did you do?
- I don't know.

1391
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:48,648
I was trying to put the star on the tree

1392
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:49,665
and then it just fell.

1393
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:50,781
- I'm sorry.
- Could we just

1394
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:52,223
have one Christmas?

1395
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,343
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

1396
01:05:56,626 --> 01:05:59,160
[door slamming]
I told him I was sorry.

1397
01:05:59,162 --> 01:06:01,607
No, no, it's all right.

1398
01:06:33,265 --> 01:06:34,985
What are you doing up?

1399
01:06:34,987 --> 01:06:36,508
What are you doing up?

1400
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:38,318
Don't talk to me like that.

1401
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,188
Listen to me, your
sister and I both gave up

1402
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:42,608
- a beautiful vacation-
- Oh, Mom, don't-

1403
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:43,988
- Instead-
- Don't go there, please.

1404
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,008
Everyone is here to help you, okay?

1405
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,108
No, she's no here
for me anymore, is she?

1406
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:49,436
- Well, whose fault is that?
- Whose fault is that?

1407
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:50,888
- Whose fault is that?
- Okay.

1408
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:52,298
You have to let your guard down,

1409
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,773
you have to let us help you.

1410
01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:54,818
- You look exhausted.
- Oh, like she

1411
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,928
- let her guard down.
- I'm not having this argument

1412
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:57,761
with you again.

1413
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,368
This has been going on since
you were six years old.

1414
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:00,268
Grow up.

1415
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:01,128
You need to take off your clothes,

1416
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,278
you need to crawl in bed,
and you need to get some rest

1417
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,658
before this baby comes.

1418
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,838
You can do anything you set your mind to.

1419
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,438
Tomorrow is another
day. You have got this.

1420
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,523
Go to bed. Get some sleep.

1421
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,118
[dramatic music]

1422
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:34,953
Oh.

1423
01:07:51,357 --> 01:07:52,857
Oh, no she didn't.

1424
01:07:54,046 --> 01:07:55,781
Oh, man.

1425
01:07:55,783 --> 01:07:57,450
She did not do that.

1426
01:08:11,094 --> 01:08:13,761
[loud knocking]

1427
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,778
- Hi.
- Hi, Diane.

1428
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:26,084
Yeah, I need to talk
to Abby. Is she here?

1429
01:08:26,086 --> 01:08:27,683
No. Was she supposed to be?

1430
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,698
She said Claire's having a sleepover?

1431
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,048
Oh, yeah. It got outta hand.

1432
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:33,518
I sent everybody home.

1433
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,397
- But she wasn't here?
- No.

1434
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:36,807
All right.

1435
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:40,448
- Are you okay? Do you-
- No, I'm not okay, no.

1436
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,738
I'm fine. Sorry to bother you.

1437
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,448
Just call me if she shows up here.

1438
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,823
- All right?
- Okay.

1439
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,904
[loud knocking]

1440
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:13,343
Get in here.
[Abby sobbing]

1441
01:09:15,764 --> 01:09:16,596
Hey.

1442
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:19,443
It's okay.

1443
01:09:20,559 --> 01:09:23,046
What's wrong? What happened?

1444
01:09:23,048 --> 01:09:26,428
Everything. I ruined everything.

1445
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:28,448
Mom is going to drop off the dog tomorrow.

1446
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:31,403
And I was supposed to take care of her.

1447
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,212
But I messed up.

1448
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,897
Hey, don't say that.

1449
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:41,557
Your mother's mad right
now. She'll come around.

1450
01:09:41,559 --> 01:09:44,603
No, you don't know how she can be.

1451
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:47,063
Actually, I do.

1452
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:52,528
Look, your mom is tough.

1453
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:56,628
But what I can tell you is she loves you.

1454
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:59,578
And she would cut off her right arm

1455
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,980
- if it would save you.
- Then why did you leave?

1456
01:10:07,857 --> 01:10:09,993
I'm gonna call her right now.

1457
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:15,063
You stay here tonight
until she calms down.

1458
01:10:15,065 --> 01:10:16,148
Is that okay?

1459
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:18,385
Yeah.

1460
01:10:29,168 --> 01:10:31,683
- [phone ringing]
- Is she with you?

1461
01:10:32,889 --> 01:10:33,723
Okay.

1462
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,413
Okay.

1463
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,637
Thanks, Kate.

1464
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,089
You don't have to thank me.

1465
01:10:43,923 --> 01:10:46,284
Is it okay if she stays here tonight?

1466
01:10:46,286 --> 01:10:47,619
No, it's fine.

1467
01:10:49,451 --> 01:10:51,190
No, just...

1468
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:55,343
I'm glad she's with you. I'm fine.

1469
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,183
Hey.

1470
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:02,246
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1471
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,702
It's not all your fault.

1472
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,833
And I hope you reconsider.

1473
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:12,033
I know we're not very
tropical or relaxing,

1474
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:14,368
- but-
- I don't need tropical.

1475
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:19,041
Thank you for being there for her.

1476
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:21,637
If you could stay, I'd really love you to.

1477
01:11:21,639 --> 01:11:24,851
I'd really love you to be
with us for the holidays.

1478
01:11:24,853 --> 01:11:26,021
I always have.

1479
01:11:27,397 --> 01:11:30,768
- Okay.
- Give her a hug for me.

1480
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:32,903
Okay, thanks, Kate.

1481
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:49,053
[clock ticking]

1482
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:00,202
Okay, I see. Everyone against me now?

1483
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,528
Your mommy has a very busy day.

1484
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,908
So you and I are going on Nana's fun day.

1485
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:11,838
And I think your mommy's taking the dog

1486
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,563
to the doctor this afternoon.

1487
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:15,683
Why?

1488
01:12:16,693 --> 01:12:17,818
Just to make sure she's healthy.

1489
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:20,018
- You know, for a check up.
- She's okay.

1490
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,795
- I brushed her teeth.
- You did?

1491
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,683
Yup. Her breath stank like poop.

1492
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,767
Hurry up, time is a-tickin'.

1493
01:12:30,294 --> 01:12:31,648
Bye, doggie. I love you.

1494
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:34,513
See you later.
[dog barking]

1495
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,048
You're trying too hard
to be a good mother,

1496
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:41,208
so you keep forgetting
the most important thing.

1497
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:43,673
They're little for such a short time.

1498
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,713
Bed rest.

1499
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:49,328
- Isn't that puppy cute?
- Oh, yeah.

1500
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:51,387
But we have other fun things to do.

1501
01:12:51,389 --> 01:12:52,223
Hop in.

1502
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:55,286
[Dougie] Yeah.

1503
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,496
[Jane] You think we're gonna see Santa?

1504
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:58,329
[Dougie] Yeah!

1505
01:12:58,331 --> 01:13:00,188
[Jane] I don't know. He
might be at the North Pole.

1506
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:03,207
But I'm for sure gonna
see some of his elves.

1507
01:13:36,422 --> 01:13:40,063
- [dog whining]
- What's going on, buddy?

1508
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:45,202
What are you doing?

1509
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:49,593
What is going on?

1510
01:14:10,644 --> 01:14:12,048
Oh my God.

1511
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:15,623
Come on, dog. Come on, dog.

1512
01:14:18,318 --> 01:14:20,288
Come on, dog.

1513
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,820
I got enough stubborn in my life!

1514
01:14:29,402 --> 01:14:30,235
Good girl.

1515
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,485
Hey, Dad, what's up?

1516
01:14:34,487 --> 01:14:36,658
- Where are you?
- I'm in Texas,

1517
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,313
on my way to a big presentation.

1518
01:14:39,857 --> 01:14:40,690
Wow.

1519
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:46,883
Well, remember, over, under, through.

1520
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:49,608
Yeah, I got it. Thanks.

1521
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,788
Oh, good, you remembered.

1522
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,503
That impresses me. Thank you.

1523
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,458
Also remember a good tie knot-

1524
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,868
- Is the measure of a man. I know.

1525
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:01,198
Hey, another one.

1526
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,733
You actually were listening.

1527
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,032
I get a kick outta that.

1528
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,463
Modern technology, Jesus Christ.

1529
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,137
You imagine what I'm talking to you on

1530
01:15:12,139 --> 01:15:13,341
and you're talking to me?

1531
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,648
Talk about modern technology.

1532
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:18,868
And yet, you know how many letters I had

1533
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:22,994
to write to your mother
just to get her to date me?

1534
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:25,648
Let me guess, three, four, five?

1535
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:27,498
27.

1536
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,862
Ah, 27. Nice.

1537
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:31,862
And now here you are.

1538
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:33,933
Look at ya.

1539
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,938
At least I got one thing right.

1540
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:37,773
Yeah.

1541
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,021
How'd you do it all those years?

1542
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:44,112
I mean, the traveling,
the juggling all of it?

1543
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:47,307
I mean, it never seems to be enough-

1544
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:48,668
- Time.
- Yeah, no time.

1545
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,501
- It's-
- If I had

1546
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,183
to do it all over again,

1547
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:58,590
I'll never get the chance,
but I'd need more time.

1548
01:16:01,389 --> 01:16:02,323
Yeah. Yeah.

1549
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,518
I gotta go, Dad. Wish me luck, all right?

1550
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,532
If a man knows who he is,

1551
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:14,723
he doesn't need luck, 'cause
he's already who he is.

1552
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,323
Brian?

1553
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,133
Hear me.

1554
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,253
Leave a piece of yourself.

1555
01:16:28,059 --> 01:16:29,253
Hey, Dad.

1556
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,313
Love you.

1557
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,682
You both missed a
great party last night.

1558
01:16:35,684 --> 01:16:38,238
[scoffs] I'm grounded until next year.

1559
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,913
Yeah, me, too. But hey, it was worth it.

1560
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:45,355
Whoa, Abby, that's your mom.

1561
01:16:45,357 --> 01:16:47,928
Oh, no, she's taking
the dog to the shelter.

1562
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,298
We need to stop her.

1563
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,608
- Okay-
- Come on, think!

1564
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,691
- We need to do something!
- Okay, we'll need

1565
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:55,328
to bust my dad's car outta the garage.

1566
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:56,523
- Come with me.
- Okay, okay.

1567
01:16:57,718 --> 01:16:58,968
- Okay, bye then.
- Bye!

1568
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,838
All right, Benjamin
Graham is a company known

1569
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,348
for its innovative
spirit, a solution company

1570
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:12,967
that practically seeks the wants

1571
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:14,608
and needs of customers with a goal

1572
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:18,448
of achieving customer
satisfaction and customer success.

1573
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:20,168
So let's just cut to the chase, all right?

1574
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:23,887
We're gonna be increasing
production by 18%.

1575
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:27,265
Okay-
[phone buzzing]

1576
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:28,473
Excuse me, sorry.

1577
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:37,778
I'm sorry, where was I?

1578
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,610
Oh, right.

1579
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:42,908
And then all the while, we'll
be reducing the overall cost

1580
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,148
by a factor of 7%.

1581
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:45,981
Okay-
[phone buzzing]

1582
01:17:45,983 --> 01:17:50,285
Damn. Sorry, just one second.

1583
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:54,537
Whose phone is this? I
don't recognize this number.

1584
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:56,717
- Hello?
- Dad?

1585
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,903
- Abby? Hey I'm-
- Dad, hello?

1586
01:17:58,905 --> 01:18:00,141
- I'm at work, I can't-
- Hey, hey, yeah.

1587
01:18:00,143 --> 01:18:01,348
- Hello?
- I need you.

1588
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,738
- What?
- Mom's taking my dog

1589
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:03,878
to the shelter.

1590
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,588
You don't know what's
going on, but I need you.

1591
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:08,738
- Mom doesn't understand.
- Calm down. What?

1592
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,248
- She what?
- Please come home.

1593
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,557
I need you home, please.

1594
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:14,140
- I need you for under-
- What?

1595
01:18:14,142 --> 01:18:17,543
- [dial tone beeping]
- No signal.

1596
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:23,053
Hello?

1597
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:25,503
Abby? Abby?

1598
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,502
I can't do this.

1599
01:18:38,504 --> 01:18:39,921
I can't continue.

1600
01:18:48,494 --> 01:18:51,077
Sit down. I'll be right back.

1601
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,112
Walters.

1602
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:08,190
- What are you doing?
- Not now, Roger.

1603
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,600
You're throwing it all away.

1604
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,818
Look, Roger, I can't
go to London right now.

1605
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,862
You wanna fire me? Knock yourself out.

1606
01:19:19,798 --> 01:19:21,868
I gotta be with my family, okay?

1607
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:24,088
You understand that, right?

1608
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:26,452
- Brian?
- What? It's family.

1609
01:19:28,469 --> 01:19:30,700
Oh, perfect. Unbelievable.

1610
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:36,137
I knew Walters wouldn't deliver.

1611
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:37,738
Pathetic.

1612
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,188
Shut up.

1613
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:40,693
He's the best man we've got.

1614
01:19:49,957 --> 01:19:51,408
- [dog whining]
- What are you looking

1615
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,563
at me with those beady eyes for?

1616
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,368
Trying to make me feel
like I'm a horrible mother?

1617
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:58,598
I know.

1618
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,733
Some selfish witch I turned out to be.

1619
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:04,170
I wasn't always like that, you know?

1620
01:20:05,526 --> 01:20:08,213
I really wasn't always like that.

1621
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,838
I just wanted everything
to be perfect, you know?

1622
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,513
So I fixed everything up,
put the tree back together,

1623
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,573
took my position by the door.

1624
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:25,198
It was Christmas, you
know, but it was Sunday,

1625
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,952
so I knew that he would be there.

1626
01:20:29,523 --> 01:20:32,191
[loud knocking]

1627
01:20:43,645 --> 01:20:45,738
And I could see the look on his face

1628
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,933
when he saw that I fixed everything up.

1629
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:02,362
It replays over and over
in my head every day.

1630
01:21:03,657 --> 01:21:06,157
[dog whining]

1631
01:21:14,709 --> 01:21:16,554
[Christmas music]

1632
01:21:16,556 --> 01:21:19,223
[clock ticking]

1633
01:21:24,592 --> 01:21:25,423
I'm just a little stressed.

1634
01:21:25,425 --> 01:21:26,998
Maybe you can help me out.

1635
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,918
I'm sorry, sir, but the
earliest flight I can get you

1636
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,378
on is at 7:00 PM on standby.

1637
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:35,019
Standby? No.

1638
01:21:35,021 --> 01:21:37,098
I can't do standby. What's your name?

1639
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:37,933
Jessica.

1640
01:21:39,035 --> 01:21:40,903
You like jacuzzis?

1641
01:21:42,743 --> 01:21:43,858
I got one that's made out of rhinestone

1642
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:45,510
and you'd look really good in it.

1643
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:52,663
Hello?

1644
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,413
Hello?

1645
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:02,521
Dr. Klein?

1646
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:05,748
[dogs barking]

1647
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:06,833
Hello?

1648
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,183
[man groaning]

1649
01:22:17,143 --> 01:22:18,063
Hold it.

1650
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,307
- I know you.
- No, you don't.

1651
01:22:21,309 --> 01:22:22,588
I know that dog, too.

1652
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:24,168
Made me look like an idiot in the park.

1653
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:26,144
No, my dog. This is my dog.

1654
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:28,023
What you call that
little miss runs away?

1655
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,818
Do you know where the doctor is?

1656
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,596
Yeah, Doc Klein's in
the back over there.

1657
01:22:32,598 --> 01:22:33,429
- Thank you.
- I got a question

1658
01:22:33,431 --> 01:22:35,154
for you, first.

1659
01:22:35,156 --> 01:22:37,908
Do you have an apple or
gluten-free chips, something?

1660
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,485
- No.
- I'm starving, please.

1661
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:40,743
No. No!

1662
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,478
- Fine.
- Thank you.

1663
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:46,233
Take a quiche. Merry Christmas.

1664
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:50,664
Paging Dr. Klein in neurosurgery.

1665
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:52,678
Paging Dr. Klein in neurosurgery.

1666
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,898
- Hi, Dr. Klein.
- Oh, hey.

1667
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,833
Hi, how are you?

1668
01:22:57,965 --> 01:22:59,588
You're the one that got the iguana stuck

1669
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:01,557
- in the toilet, right?
- No, we spoke

1670
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:03,458
- on the phone.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no.

1671
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,437
The parrot in the attic, yeah, sure.

1672
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:06,347
Oh, God.

1673
01:23:06,349 --> 01:23:07,868
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1674
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:09,403
Oh my gosh pregnant mom, defiant daughter.

1675
01:23:09,405 --> 01:23:12,057
- Yes, that's me.
- How did I?

1676
01:23:12,059 --> 01:23:14,798
- It's been a busy week.
- Okay, thanks for seeing us.

1677
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,098
Something's going on with her.

1678
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,728
I'm just not sure. I thought
you should take a look.

1679
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:20,807
Yeah, I think we'll
be fine. Look at you.

1680
01:23:20,809 --> 01:23:21,641
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1681
01:23:21,643 --> 01:23:24,618
I mean, she looks, she doesn't look good.

1682
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,557
- She doesn't look good?
- No.

1683
01:23:26,559 --> 01:23:29,478
But let's take a few x-rays
and then maybe you can wait

1684
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,804
in the lobby and I'll get back to you.

1685
01:23:30,806 --> 01:23:32,241
Oh, oh, yeah, my phone's there.

1686
01:23:32,243 --> 01:23:34,298
Sure, yes. I'll be in the lobby.

1687
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,383
Oh, boy. We'll be fine, I think.

1688
01:23:37,385 --> 01:23:39,218
Let me just check you.

1689
01:23:43,245 --> 01:23:44,077
Okay.

1690
01:23:47,362 --> 01:23:49,038
Very good. Very good.

1691
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,570
You're a strong dog, yes.

1692
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:54,973
Here, let me just see your,

1693
01:23:54,975 --> 01:23:56,163
what do we got here?

1694
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,793
Hey, teeth look good.

1695
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,452
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

1696
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:08,557
You don't know what
it's like in my house.

1697
01:24:08,559 --> 01:24:10,929
It's non-stop chaos.

1698
01:24:10,931 --> 01:24:12,768
At least your parents love each other.

1699
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:15,905
You got a cool young
brother, a bitchin' aunt,

1700
01:24:15,907 --> 01:24:17,733
and to top it all off, you got me.

1701
01:24:20,969 --> 01:24:22,505
I got you?

1702
01:24:22,507 --> 01:24:24,458
You think I just hang out with strays,

1703
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:27,328
tour police stations, and
steal my old man's car

1704
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:28,163
for just anyone?

1705
01:24:29,253 --> 01:24:31,452
- At least not this weekend.
- [laughs] What?

1706
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,878
- Kate!
- Diane, you didn't.

1707
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,108
I can't believe you did
this after everything.

1708
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:44,952
Oh, Kate.

1709
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,998
- Mom, how could you?
- Abby!

1710
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,088
No, no, no, I'll remember
this for the rest of my life.

1711
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:53,005
Oh, I hope you do. I'm so sorry.

1712
01:24:53,007 --> 01:24:55,268
- How could you say that?
- I'm so sorry.

1713
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:56,898
I was trying so hard to be a good mother,

1714
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,993
I forgot the most important thing.

1715
01:25:00,905 --> 01:25:03,249
[gasps] Baby!

1716
01:25:03,251 --> 01:25:05,807
Hi. Oh my goodness, hi, girl.

1717
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:08,660
She was a bit dehydrated,
but her vitals look good.

1718
01:25:08,662 --> 01:25:10,257
- That's good.
- And?

1719
01:25:10,259 --> 01:25:13,327
Look at this. She swallowed something.

1720
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:17,368
No, those look like puppies.

1721
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,418
Four puppies!

1722
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,251
Yeah?

1723
01:25:20,253 --> 01:25:21,219
- Yeah, those are puppies.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

1724
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:22,419
- Puppies!
- Those are puppies.

1725
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:26,002
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- Those are puppies.

1726
01:25:26,004 --> 01:25:27,085
You're right, those are puppies.

1727
01:25:27,087 --> 01:25:28,780
- This is unreal.
- You're having puppies.
