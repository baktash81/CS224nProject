1
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:28,086
- Congratulations.
- We're so pleased.

2
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:32,860
A wonderful article in the paper about you,
Sir Oliver. It's wonderful, sir! Wonderful!

3
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,834
Good morning, Professor,
or I should say Sir Oliver.

4
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:38,894
- Long article about you.
- Is there? Well, well, well.

5
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:41,907
I think they made a mistake about your age.

6
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,318
Paper! Paper!

7
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,022
Paper! Paper!

8
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,191
Paper!

9
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:13,270
It's such an honor for Edinburgh, Sir Oliver.
I cannot take your money.

10
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,433
- Thank you.
- Paper! Paper!

11
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,242
Congratulations, Professor.

12
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:59,347
# Here's to the prof of geology

13
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:03,855
# Master of all natural history

14
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:08,327
# Rare boy he, and rare boys we

15
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:12,830
# To know such a big curiosity

16
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:15,197
# To the braw, aye, aye, aye, aye

17
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,293
# To the bricht, aye, aye, aye, aye

18
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:21,238
# To the knicht, aye, aye, aye, aye,
aye, aye, aye, aye

19
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:22,832
# Aye

20
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:25,704
I'm sorry.

21
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:29,111
Sir Oliver, since you have
been created a knight,

22
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:34,482
I've given your students a holiday -
a day for a knight, so to speak.

23
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:40,424
First, however, there's to be a presentation.
Will the Laird of Glendarach step forward?

24
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:42,693
Sir Oliver.

25
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:47,461
In the name of the student body, in gratitude
for the knowledge you have imparted to us...

26
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,730
That's enough obituary prose.

27
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,036
An inkwell, I presume.

28
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:55,165
A very handsome thing.

29
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,869
Hellish to dust.

30
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:00,936
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

31
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:04,778
And now off to the playing fields, all of you!

32
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:26,864
Ah.

33
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,273
It cost £4.17. I was on the committee
that made the collection.

34
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:34,837
- I thank you for your efforts, McEwen.
- £5 was subscribed. That left three shillings.

35
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:37,405
You're not going to give me
the change, are you?

36
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:41,921
I expended it on this. A little extra token
I thought you might fancy.

37
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:46,322
I saw it during Easter week in a little window
in Glasgow, a curiosity shop.

38
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:49,691
It seemed to whisper to me.
"Buy me for Professor Lindenbrook."

39
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:51,492
What did you reply?

40
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:54,465
I said "Only if you can be
bought for three shillings."

41
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:58,903
- I argued with the owner all Good Friday.
- It's lava, of course.

42
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:02,567
But exceptionally heavy.
Could serve as a paperweight.

43
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:06,442
- Do you like it, Professor?
- It's a scholar's choice.

44
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,640
What are you eating tonight?

45
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:13,648
This being Tuesday, I'm not eating.

46
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:17,189
I find it very healthy
to eat only every other night.

47
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:21,091
Be at my house at eight o'clock.
I'm entertaining some of the faculty.

48
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:24,391
- I do not think I could.
- What's the matter with you?

49
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:29,094
You used to come to my house regularly.
Is it those frayed cuffs that worry you?

50
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,898
I won't get my other shirt
from the wash till Friday.

51
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:34,939
Eight o'clock sharp.
We're scientists, aren't we?

52
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:39,068
That's one society where frayed cuffs
don't matter. We've all had 'em.

53
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:42,114
Yes, Sir Oliver. Eight o'clock.

54
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:47,245
Lava.

55
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,845
I swear there's something inside.

56
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:27,091
- There's Uncle now, Kirsty.
- And high time too!

57
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,896
I thought it was Uncle Oliver.

58
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,868
I want it understood that not a single stitch
I'm wearing belongs to me.

59
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,269
- Good evening, Miss Jenny.
- Good evening, Alec McEwen.

60
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:44,536
- I'm early, but I trust I'm not too early.
- I didn't know you were coming.

61
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:48,011
Well, your uncle - I should say Sir Oliver -
ordered me to come.

62
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:51,710
Where is he? He's never
been late like this - never.

63
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:55,049
I don't know, but, to return
to the subject of my clothes,

64
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:58,352
they're my classmate's,
the young Laird of Glendarach.

65
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:02,087
"You can't go to dinner dressed like that"
said the young laird.

66
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:06,861
"The professor knows my wardrobe"
I replied, and went to take my bath.

67
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:11,300
When I returned, my clothes had been
confiscated and these substituted.

68
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:14,669
I want to make it clear I have no claim
to the Glendarach tartan.

69
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:17,504
You've explained your magnificence.

70
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,635
Kirsty!

71
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:22,203
There will be one more guest.

72
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:26,480
- I'll seat you between the dean and the rector.
- Couldn't I sit next to you?

73
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,645
Certainly not.

74
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,321
Pardon my being personal, but I notice a
certain harshness in your attitude toward me.

75
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:40,593
What do you expect when it takes a command
from my uncle to bring you to this house?

76
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:45,195
Miss Jenny, why should I
torture myself to no purpose?

77
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:48,069
Two years more I have to study
for my master's degree.

78
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:50,905
Then four years more
as a laboratory assistant.

79
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,673
There's the money I owe my relatives.
They're paying for my schooling.

80
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:57,545
You are very logical, Mr McEwen.

81
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,279
- It's the logic of an empty purse.
- How like a Scotsman.

82
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,081
I am a Scotsman.

83
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:07,592
I know one whose purse was not empty,
because he didn't even have a purse.

84
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,061
His name was Robert Burns.
Do you know what he said?

85
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:13,495
Miss Jenny, the time of poetry is over.

86
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,401
If this is true, Alec McEwen, what are you
doing with your hand on my knee?

87
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:22,701
Miss Jenny.

88
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,277
Now you just wait in there.

89
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:28,108
Kirsty, I'll set the extra place.

90
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:42,126
Is there something you want?

91
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:45,220
- A key is stuck.
- But that's impossible.

92
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:47,732
It was just tuned last month.

93
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,859
Which one?

94
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:52,666
- This one. Can't you see?
- No, I can't.

95
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,301
At least you can see how unhappy I am.

96
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,867
You know how I've felt since
that day you entered the classroom

97
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,710
and brought your uncle
the galoshes he forgot.

98
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:05,283
You looked like spring itself.

99
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:11,420
# My love is like a red, red rose

100
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:17,292
# That's newly sprung in June

101
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:22,459
# My love is like the melody

102
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:26,905
# That's sweetly played in tune

103
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:29,498
I thought you were setting the table.

104
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:32,840
There's a key stuck. Mr McEwen is fixing it.

105
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:35,437
#... my bonny lass

106
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:41,753
# So deep in love am I

107
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:49,289
# That I will love you still, my dear

108
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:55,126
# Till all the seas go dry

109
00:10:56,502 --> 00:11:00,302
# Till all the seas go dry, my love

110
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:03,638
# And rocks melt with the sun

111
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:09,341
# And I will love you still, my dear

112
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:17,454
# While the sands of life shall run

113
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,691
# So fare-thee-well, my only love

114
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:32,337
# And fare-thee-well a while

115
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:40,336
# For I'll come back to you, my love

116
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:51,248
# Though it were ten thousand mile

117
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:05,398
- Miss Jenny, you're crying.
- I've been over the goose... the fumes...

118
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:15,075
- Good evening, Miss Jenny.
- Good evening, gentlemen.

119
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:17,446
We were worrying
about Professor Lindenbrook.

120
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:20,350
Yes, we were. Isn't he with you?

121
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:22,512
- Isn't he here?
- No.

122
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:36,529
- Careful it doesn't go too high, Paisley.
- It's just about the limit now, Sir Oliver.

123
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:40,467
I gave no permission for visitors.
Oh, it's you, McEwen.

124
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,476
- Good lad. You can lend Paisley a hand.
- Uncle, your guests are waiting.

125
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:46,978
If you don't come now, the goose will be...

126
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,947
- Oh, goose, goose, goose!
- Tell him, Alec.

127
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,484
This lava you gave me is one in ten million.
I've been at it all day.

128
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:58,047
- Aye, and without a pause for lunch or tea.
- You've had three semesters of petrology.

129
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:02,322
Now then, from which volcano
could this piece of lava have emerged?

130
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,396
- Fujiyama?
- No.

131
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,864
- Mount Etna?
- Very close. The Mediterranean.

132
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,629
The Lipari island group off the coast of Italy.

133
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:13,399
- But theirs is a very light lava, sir.
- That's exactly what stumped me.

134
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:17,442
Inside there must be something
the weight of the heaviest rock in existence.

135
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,140
- But that would be Icelandic peridotite.
- Precisely.

136
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,442
- There's a piece chipped off.
- By me.

137
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:28,681
- What's the rock inside?
- Icelandic peridotite, naturally.

138
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:31,154
When I saw this, I stopped chipping.

139
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:37,261
There's some marks on the surface.
Looks like a letter or some notches.

140
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,060
Three notches made by the hand of man.

141
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:45,031
But how could a rock from Iceland

142
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:50,337
possibly pop out of a volcano across
the world? What's your conclusion?

143
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:54,971
Science does notjump to conclusions.
Science is not a guessing game.

144
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:58,312
We're going to melt off the crust of lava.

145
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,510
Mr Paisley.

146
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:07,086
Add 10cc of aqua regia.

147
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,285
Not too fast, you know.

148
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,294
I shall write to Professor Goetaborg
of Stockholm about this.

149
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,663
He's the leading authority on volcanoes.

150
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:17,999
How long is all this going to take?

151
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:23,030
A typically female question. To melt lava
will take as long as it takes lava to melt.

152
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:26,636
- Maybe two hours, maybe four hours.
- Two hours? Four hours?

153
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:29,681
Maybe the whole night.
Who cares?

154
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:37,045
Jenny!

155
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,883
Are you all right?

156
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:59,568
That was entirely my fault, Sir Oliver.
I don't know how it could have happened.

157
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:06,076
Mr Paisley, by your slip you've rendered
an inestimable service to science.

158
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,452
Alec.

159
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:14,391
See this? What would you call it?

160
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,792
As you said, it's a man-made object.

161
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:20,855
Looks like a top.
A surveyor's instrument. A plumb bob.

162
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,458
Not only looks like - it is a plumb bob.

163
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:28,735
- There are letters on it.
- It's an inscription. A message, perhaps.

164
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,537
Can you make out what it says, Professor?

165
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:34,942
It's in some Nordic tongue.

166
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:38,642
The hand that wrote this trembled.
Perhaps it was a dying hand.

167
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:42,154
I wonder what it's written in. Paint? Ink?

168
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:45,122
- Perhaps blood.
- Possibly.

169
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,727
Look at this side, sir. A signature.

170
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:51,855
Arne Saknus...

171
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,958
Arne Saknussem.

172
00:15:57,103 --> 00:16:01,506
I hope it isn't too much to suggest that
you take me home now, Uncle Oliver.

173
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:03,804
Or do I have to go alone?

174
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:08,210
Alone. Alone. It's unthinkable,
but it must be true.

175
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:13,183
A man took some tools and went where
no human being has ever set foot.

176
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:17,655
Alone. Into the interior of the earth, alone.

177
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:21,454
- What is he talking about?
- Arne Saknussem, the Icelandic scientist.

178
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:26,055
Greatest of his day. He was laughed at when
he claimed there was a world down below.

179
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:30,501
The laughter stopped when he disappeared,
never to be heard from.

180
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,864
Until tonight.

181
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:43,843
Get out of here, woman! I didn't ask for tea.

182
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,942
I don't want any tea! All I want is my post.

183
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:52,616
There's no use shouting at me, Sir Oliver.
I can shoutjust as loud as you can!

184
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,855
For two weeks you've had nothing to eat
and you haven't slept!

185
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:58,055
Out, woman!

186
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:00,257
Here's your post, Uncle Oliver.

187
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:15,044
Another day and still nothing.
Can you believe that? No answer!

188
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:19,073
- Where is Alec McEwen?
- At the university, looking for letters there.

189
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:22,586
How long does it take for a letter
to get here from Stockholm?

190
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:25,123
- Answer the bell.
- Did it ring?

191
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:30,728
We have to speak to Sir Oliver.
And don't tell us he's busy.

192
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,322
Callers, callers. That's all I need.

193
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:38,800
Oliver, we all know
your reputation for rudeness.

194
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:41,635
You also have a reputation
as a conscientious man.

195
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:44,301
But you've skipped every lecture
in two weeks.

196
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,540
- I'm involved in something important.
- More important than our university?

197
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:52,276
Something any university would envy us.

198
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:58,288
You laugh. What does the name
Arne Saknussem mean to you, gentlemen?

199
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,323
Saknussem... Just a second.

200
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:05,363
Wasn't he the one who wrote
about the lost city of Atlantis?

201
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:10,800
That was an early phase of his career.
His real fame rests on his study of volcanoes.

202
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,634
Out of a volcano
came this message from him.

203
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:17,369
It lay unnoticed for 100 years,
was probably picked up by some peasant,

204
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:20,606
gathered dust in a curiosity shop
till it came to me.

205
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,239
Here is a translation of the words.

206
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:26,580
"I am dying, but my life's work
must not be lost."

207
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:29,416
"Whoever descends into
the crater of Sneffels Yocul

208
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:33,857
can reach the center of the earth.
I did it. Arne Saknussem."

209
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,087
- The center of the earth?
- Sneffels Yocul?

210
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:39,926
An extinct volcano in Iceland.
There must be a direct route from it

211
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,829
to a region no man has ever seen.

212
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:44,267
But, Oliver, this is sheer fantasy.

213
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:47,066
You haven't heard all of it.
There's a postscript.

214
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:52,338
"At sunrise on the last day of May
the mountain Scartaris will point the path."

215
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:57,208
- Well, what do you say now?
- I'm more mystified than ever.

216
00:18:57,316 --> 00:19:00,547
- Scartaris?
- It's a mountain peak near the volcano.

217
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:03,383
But this is a student's hoax.
You should know better.

218
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,651
Just a second, Rector.

219
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:09,387
Let's not take that tone.
Let's assume it's authentic.

220
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:14,365
Isn't the correct procedure to write a paper
and submit it to the university officially?

221
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:17,061
More than anything,
you must consult other experts.

222
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:21,697
- A thing like this needs verification.
- Here is my paper.

223
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:24,503
And I've written to
the foremost authority in Europe.

224
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:26,201
The Royal Geological Society?

225
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:29,509
More eminent still.
Professor Goetaborg of Stockholm.

226
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:31,674
And what does he say?

227
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:34,719
Unfortunately I've not yet received his reply.

228
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,879
And I've written to him twice.

229
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:43,259
I suggest we relax on the matter until your
famous correspondent sees fit to answer you.

230
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:46,389
And in the meantime
we could do with a cup of tea.

231
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:48,524
I know you two think I'm daft.

232
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:52,094
Think whatever you want!

233
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,340
Jenny, tea!

234
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:59,605
- When did you get here?
- Just this moment, Sir Oliver. Look.

235
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,740
It's from Stockholm!

236
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:18,057
Well, he's got his letter from Stockholm.
Did you see the shine in his eyes?

237
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,089
There'll never be a better moment
to tell him about our feelings for each other.

238
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:26,968
- He'll say yes almost inadvertently.
- What if he says no advertently?

239
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,937
You wait and see how firm
my voice can be when I speak of you.

240
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:45,151
Blast and damn!
Blast and damnation!

241
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:48,454
- The devil blast it!
- What is it, Oliver?

242
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:51,553
- Don't keep us in the dark.
- Bad news, sir?

243
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:57,135
I am stricken. The University of Stockholm
informs me that Professor Goetaborg

244
00:20:57,202 --> 00:21:00,069
has vanished from Sweden.

245
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:05,873
His disappearance follows closely the date
my communication must have reached him.

246
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:07,503
With all my material.

247
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:10,741
He evidently didn't think it
important enough to answer.

248
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:13,249
Or too important.

249
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,847
McEwen, go directly to the harbor. Find out
when the next ship leaves for Iceland.

250
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:21,256
- Oliver, calm down.
- I will not be beaten to my goal.

251
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:25,525
- But what is your goal?
- You heard Saknussem's message.

252
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,260
- Oliver, you're seriously ill.
- I am seriously well.

253
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:33,738
What are you waiting for? I told you to hurry.
If you'll excuse me, I must start packing.

254
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,672
- To go where?
- To Iceland to begin with.

255
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:39,575
- And then?
- Where Arne Saknussem went.

256
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:42,704
- Oliver!
- Will you kindly stop saying Oliver.

257
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:46,649
I can't sit in my classrooms waiting,
while a scoundrel named Goetaborg

258
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:49,347
exploits what I foolishly placed in his hands.

259
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:54,859
Don't you see what's at stake? The ultimate
aim of all science: To penetrate the unknown.

260
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,657
Do you realize we know
less about the earth we live on

261
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,756
than about the stars
and the galaxies of outer space?

262
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:05,269
The greatest mystery is right here,
right under our feet.

263
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:08,272
And now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen...

264
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,745
- I must have a word with you.
- I've no time.

265
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:20,114
- You must take time for this, sir.
- What are you so urgent about?

266
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:24,815
- This is the most urgent moment of my life.
- Not for me. I have to be in Iceland.

267
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,223
So must I. I'm going with you, sir.

268
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:31,888
- Where?
- To the center of the earth, naturally.

269
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:52,781
# My heart's in the Highlands

270
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:54,944
# A-chasing the deer

271
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:58,879
# A-hunting the wild deer

272
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,687
# And chasing the roe

273
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:05,997
# My heart's in the Highlands

274
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:08,727
# Wherever I go

275
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:13,597
Right now all Iceland must be aware
that the Scots have arrived.

276
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:16,334
I wish I could sing loud enough
for Jenny to hear me.

277
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:18,103
Homesick already?

278
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,509
It is a bit painful to leave her
on the first day of our engagement.

279
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:25,709
To come back to her as a world-famous
scientist is not to be sneezed at.

280
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,911
Come here. Take a look.

281
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:36,292
Did you expect a flight of stairs
with a red carpet?

282
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:41,060
I neglected to tell you, sir.
I have a nervous fear of heights.

283
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:45,695
Well, you'll get over that
after the first million fathoms or so.

284
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:48,239
Million fathoms...

285
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,973
Alec, he's been here.

286
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,821
He's been surveying here.
This is fresh-cut wood.

287
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:12,124
- Your revered colleague from Stockholm.
- He isn't wasting any time.

288
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:17,430
- Do you think he's already gone down?
- No. The message said the last day of May.

289
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:21,995
Take our carriage to Reykjavik.
Buy all the rope available.

290
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:26,534
Stock up on hardtacks, salted beef, chocolate,
and all the medical supplies we need,

291
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:30,308
but more than anything inquire
whether they have Ruhmkorff lamps.

292
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:33,077
Have another carriage
waiting for me at sunset.

293
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:37,919
- You think we can prepare it all so quickly?
- We must. We're in a race.

294
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:40,048
What's that you're taking?

295
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,252
Jenny's farewell gift.

296
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:46,089
I'll keep it with me always.

297
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:02,871
Scartaris.

298
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,483
- Back to my hotel.
- Já, Professor Goetaborg.

299
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:09,643
My good man.
I assume my assistant sent you.

300
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:13,811
No, no, thank you.
Nobody carries a soldier's weapons.

301
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,320
And take your time.
These instruments are delicate.

302
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,010
Easy, coachman.

303
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:58,422
This isn't the same road we came by
this morning. I said slow down, man!

304
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:11,034
You're out of your senses! Stop your horses,
man! This is not a request, it's a command!

305
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:17,412
Can't you hear me? Slow down!

306
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:21,443
Stop, you fool!

307
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:30,719
Whoa!

308
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:42,436
If you've ruined my instruments,
I'll horsewhip you, so help me.

309
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:49,640
And where are we?
This certainly is not my hotel.

310
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:07,192
- Professor!
- Alec!

311
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:12,167
Where are we?

312
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:15,832
Apparently in an eider-feather storehouse.

313
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:19,273
- How did you get here?
- I don't know. It went so fast.

314
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:22,643
I was clubbed. I was overpowered
before I knew there was a struggle.

315
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:26,650
- Did you see who did it?
- No. I was just trying to do your errands.

316
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:30,016
I said Professor Goetaborg was a scoundrel.
He's a criminal.

317
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:34,787
Very likely he's dreamed of such a project.
Your letter was the key to the door of fame.

318
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,693
- Hush. Did you hear that?
- What?

319
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,026
Some tapping.

320
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:43,329
Don't get your hopes up, Professor.
There's not a soul around.

321
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:46,802
- Everybody is in the market square.
- Why? It isn't Sunday.

322
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:49,705
The fishing fleet is going out
for the first summer haul.

323
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:53,141
- You mean the shops are closed?
- No, the shops are open.

324
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:57,682
But every piece of rope, every lamp,
everything we'd need was sold.

325
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:59,239
To Professor Goetaborg.

326
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:03,146
He's staying in the very inn
where we have our rooms.

327
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:06,648
This time I heard it too.

328
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,160
- A fellow prisoner, do you suppose?
- Let's give it a signal, sir.

329
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,698
- It's a code.
- Morse?

330
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,966
I can'tjust make it out. Jot this down.

331
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,608
Dash, dash, dot, dot, dot, dot,

332
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,647
long dash...

333
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:33,081
- It doesn't make sense.
- Perhaps it's in Icelandic.

334
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:35,277
I don't think so.

335
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,052
We've established contact.

336
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:48,126
I still can't make it out.

337
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:52,067
My esteemed friend, whoever you are,
let me introduce myself.

338
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:56,096
Professor Oliver Lindenbrook,
University of Edinburgh.

339
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:04,080
May I ask you to interrupt your tapping
for a moment and listen?

340
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:07,084
In what language
would you like me to speak?

341
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:13,655
- He doesn't understand English.
- I'll try French.

342
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:18,753
Mon cher ami, vous et nous sommes
dans une situation abominable.

343
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,562
It's no good, sir. It sounds more Russian.

344
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:37,906
Gertrude?

345
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,685
Gertrude! Gertrude!

346
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:49,720
- It's a female prisoner.
- And her lover.

347
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:59,935
Professor, they're kissing.

348
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:03,406
I'm sorry, but for once
we must dispense with tact.

349
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:06,467
Much as I regret to disturb
this tender moment,

350
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:09,275
is there any way you can get us out of here?

351
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:27,556
It's a duck!

352
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,499
And I was just about to try Latin!

353
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:40,634
Young man with the gold tooth, I'll give you
more gold if you'll guide us to Reykjavik.

354
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:45,949
You take us to Reykjavik.

355
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:07,137
I understand that Professor Goetaborg
from Stockholm is stopping here,

356
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,298
a friend of mine.

357
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:14,740
- A friend of yours? Professor Goetaborg?
- Let's say a colleague.

358
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:16,905
May I have your help?

359
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:20,945
- He is at home, isn't he?
- Yes, I...

360
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:24,419
He is not at home. He is not to be disturbed.

361
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:31,054
- Don't tell me he's asleep with this going on.
- You cannot see him. I'm sorry.

362
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:34,223
Here are your coins. And here is my card,

363
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:38,759
if you'll be good enough to put it in his box
so that he'll know tomorrow that I'm around.

364
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,929
Thank you so much.

365
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:54,476
Goetaborg! I know you're in there.
Open up. This is Lindenbrook.

366
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:09,691
Goetaborg.

367
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:31,020
Do you see what this is, laddie?
The very last word in equipment.

368
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:33,148
Ruhmkorff lamps.

369
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,118
Self-generating.

370
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:42,028
- How long will they burn?
- My guess is indefinitely.

371
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,503
As long as they're wound up,
the induction coil will give off current.

372
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:50,473
Breathing devices.
The kind they use in coal mines in Wales.

373
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:57,376
All the instruments needed for exploring
the world below, whatever it may be.

374
00:33:57,482 --> 00:34:01,248
I shall wait here till Goetaborg returns.

375
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:04,120
You wait too.

376
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:08,421
Goetaborg may be a strong man.

377
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:20,599
More treasure, sir. Climbing boots.

378
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:23,873
Alpenstocks.

379
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:26,035
Blankets.

380
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:31,140
Food for months.

381
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,079
A chart of the...

382
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:46,555
Professor!

383
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:51,227
What?

384
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:02,805
Well, Goetaborg, it seems
there's such a thing as justice after all.

385
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:07,615
So you wanted to push in ahead of us.

386
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:10,210
Fate took care of him.

387
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:12,779
Why didn't they tell us at the desk?

388
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:17,851
Hotels rarely advertise the fact
that there are corpses lying around.

389
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:22,329
The Icelander teaches us a lesson.

390
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:26,063
All right. We'll observe one minute of silence

391
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:30,301
in memory of a great scientist,
even if he was a blasted thief.

392
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:05,074
Alec, you mentioned fate. Slight correction.

393
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:08,703
Fate plus a few grains of potassium cyanide.

394
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:13,306
He was against someone
who was even more against him.

395
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:15,846
Who?

396
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:50,512
I'm the wife of Professor Goetaborg.

397
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:53,318
- Oh, my dear.
- What is it?

398
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:59,294
I was surprised my husband wasn't
at the pier to meet me. Is something wrong?

399
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:02,458
Won't you sit down
for a minute before you go up?

400
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,594
Please, my dear.

401
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:12,372
He seemed so well. Early in the morning
he went to the mountain.

402
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:17,779
When he came back for lunch he received
his guest right in the lobby. I saw him myself.

403
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,374
They went up to his room and ate.

404
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:25,720
What are you trying to tell me?
That my husband is?

405
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:29,250
His guest left about four.

406
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:33,623
In the evening when the maid
went to make the bed...

407
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:38,532
Oh, dear God! As long as I can remember,
no one ever died in my inn!

408
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:44,702
Of course, we called a doctor,
but it was too late.

409
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:48,472
We left him up there because we knew
you were due in on the morning boat.

410
00:37:56,754 --> 00:38:02,989
Just ten days ago he was...
he was joking on the pier in Stockholm.

411
00:38:03,628 --> 00:38:08,031
The moment he arrived here
he sent me a message,

412
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,193
just with one word: "Come."

413
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,772
Madam, my deep sympathy.

414
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:28,110
My name - Oliver Lindenbrook
of Edinburgh University.

415
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:30,915
I take it you're familiar with that name.

416
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:35,321
- Professor Lindenbrook.
- I see you are.

417
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:42,299
I must ask you a question, and it's just
as well that Madam Goetaborg be present.

418
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,063
This will be difficult for you,
madam, but it must be faced.

419
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:48,935
Who was the last person to see him alive?

420
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,099
His luncheon guest.

421
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:53,905
- And who was that?
- Count Saknussem.

422
00:38:55,146 --> 00:39:00,015
Count Saknussem? I didn't realize
the Saknussem family still existed.

423
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:03,247
The Saknussems are
the oldest family in this whole land.

424
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:06,414
A descendant of Arne Saknussem?

425
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:09,492
And a scientist too in his own right.

426
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:12,222
And it was he who lunched
with Professor Goetaborg?

427
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:14,024
They saw each other every day.

428
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:18,592
They worked together in his room
with all those charts and instruments.

429
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:23,266
I suggest that you have
an autopsy performed immediately.

430
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:27,674
You think there's something suspicious
about my husband's death?

431
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:32,045
Your husband came to Iceland
for the same reasons that brought me.

432
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:35,051
Neither he nor I could suspect
there was a third party

433
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,917
who would stop at nothing to forestall us.

434
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:40,582
He was... killed?

435
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:42,922
Poisoned.

436
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:46,394
This is now a matter for the police.
Go and send for them at once.

437
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:48,591
To your room first, madam.

438
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:54,804
Just one second, if you please. Thank you.

439
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:04,205
I am deeply distressed by your husband's
death, and I fully understand your feelings.

440
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:07,410
However, I must ask you one question.

441
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:12,548
How do you plan to dispose of the equipment
your husband assembled up there?

442
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:15,626
- What does it matter now?
- Don't give it another thought.

443
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:18,662
- I'll take it off your hands.
- We can discuss it later.

444
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,858
No, we cannot discuss it later, madam.
Time is running out.

445
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:25,266
My expedition must start
within the next 24 hours.

446
00:40:26,337 --> 00:40:29,329
- Your expedition?
- Exactly.

447
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,568
I only know of the Goetaborg Expedition.

448
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:35,168
Husbands don't tell their wives everything.

449
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:39,238
I do not wish to blacken the memory of
your husband, but as I'm under pressure,

450
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,511
I must change my request to a demand.

451
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:44,180
I have a right to that equipment
and I claim it.

452
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:48,349
A right? To take over the work
of another man's lifetime?

453
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:52,657
- He died for that idea.
- An idea he stole from me.

454
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,595
- That is a lie.
- Madam...

455
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,758
An unforgivable lie!

456
00:40:58,336 --> 00:41:03,740
I would rather destroy every pound
of that equipment than let you have it.

457
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:18,819
"Incredible encounter."

458
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:24,089
"A Saknussem descendant turns up -
acts as if he were King of Volcanoes."

459
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:28,622
"Tries to force me to surrender
his ancestor's secret."

460
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:31,764
"Saknussem called again."

461
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:38,365
"New complication.
My real adversary arrives: Lindenbrook."

462
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:43,470
"Undoubtedly to claim his rights.
Must fight him somehow."

463
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:01,361
Young man, would you
come here a moment, please?

464
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:05,334
Who are those for?

465
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:11,400
Professor Lindenbrook.

466
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:30,093
- Oh. At least we have some rope.
- That's a beginning.

467
00:42:33,431 --> 00:42:36,764
Tell him to stop jabbering
and go for some more shopping.

468
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:38,927
What about lamps?

469
00:42:40,471 --> 00:42:42,530
Lamps. Lamps.

470
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:45,504
What about picks?

471
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:47,669
And provisions. Food.

472
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:53,279
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Put me down! Put me down!

473
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:55,842
Kindly put me down! Put me down!

474
00:42:57,655 --> 00:43:00,146
Will somebody please explain this outrage?

475
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:03,125
Are we to be abducted every day in Iceland?

476
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:13,468
- She speaks Icelandic.
- I do.

477
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:16,700
But I wish to apologize
to you in plain English.

478
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:20,640
I went through my husband's diary,

479
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:24,545
and some of his remarks led me
to believe I did you an injustice.

480
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:28,710
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- Don't give it another thought. I shan't.

481
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:31,413
I'm Sir Oliver's assistant, Alec McEwen.

482
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:34,686
This whole expedition began,
thanks to this lad.

483
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:36,954
Began - and that's all it has done.

484
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:39,655
Sir Oliver, this morning
you asked me for these.

485
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,255
If you still want them, they're yours.

486
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:45,735
Will you say that again?

487
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:50,068
I shall not stand in the way
of the Lindenbrook Expedition.

488
00:43:58,316 --> 00:43:59,340
Madam.

489
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,216
My husband had these boots
made specially. I hope they fit you.

490
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:08,088
Mine will be ready without delay. I told
your man to order some for me immediately.

491
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:10,285
Good, good.

492
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:15,197
What was that?
Why would you need boots like this?

493
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:18,235
Well, I can't very well go in these.

494
00:44:18,302 --> 00:44:20,793
- Go where, madam?
- Don't say it.

495
00:44:21,706 --> 00:44:25,472
Naturally, I'm coming along.
That's why I'm giving you all of this.

496
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:30,003
- It's a condition. I thought you understood.
- You didn't mention any condition.

497
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:35,280
Then I do now. Whom did you intend
to take along, besides this young man?

498
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:38,254
- The big Icelander.
- Then I'll be very useful.

499
00:44:38,322 --> 00:44:42,554
- He doesn't understand a word of English.
- You can't come along! You're a woman!

500
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,457
And what has my sex to do with it?

501
00:44:44,562 --> 00:44:49,499
We're not contemplating a stroll
down Piccadilly or the Champs Élysées.

502
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:53,628
Professor Lindenbrook,
I have just lost my husband.

503
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:56,665
I have nothing else to live for
any more up here.

504
00:44:56,741 --> 00:45:02,441
- Down there I can represent his name.
- The decision is not yours to make.

505
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:06,176
The police require your presence
for the investigation into the death.

506
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,718
I have already given my testimony.

507
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:14,321
But, madam, quite apart from the appalling
danger, think of the inconvenience.

508
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:16,484
The lack of privacy.

509
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:19,292
In short, you don't want all of this.

510
00:45:19,397 --> 00:45:23,265
I may be mad on the subject of this journey,
but I am not stupid!

511
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:26,303
To burden myself with a female
is sheer stupidity!

512
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:31,034
I resent that word. I may have been
a disturbance to men, never a burden.

513
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:34,735
This is an absolute holdup!

514
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:39,207
You will not receive
one iota of extra consideration.

515
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:43,276
You'll sleep where we sleep,
eat what we eat and wash when we wash.

516
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:45,845
Then you accept my proposition.

517
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:22,525
Professor, look!

518
00:46:47,485 --> 00:46:49,612
There's our gateway!

519
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:24,478
Thank you, Scartaris!

520
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:28,681
Never was there a brighter sunrise.

521
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:34,662
Now we descend into oblivion
or... we enter the great book of history.

522
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:38,092
Roll call.

523
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:40,465
Carla Goetaborg.

524
00:47:40,538 --> 00:47:43,837
- Alexander McEwen.
- Hans and Gertrude Belker.

525
00:47:43,908 --> 00:47:46,001
Oliver S Lindenbrook.

526
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:51,506
What did he say? Hans and who?

527
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:53,674
And Gertrude.

528
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:03,423
Professor!

529
00:48:06,797 --> 00:48:08,856
Professor!

530
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:12,631
All right, you've arrived.

531
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:22,675
- Rather an alarming descent.
- I found it exhilarating.

532
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:26,611
I wonder if Madam Goetaborg
will change her mind.

533
00:48:26,684 --> 00:48:28,777
You make my mouth water.

534
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,580
- Hans is tying the rope on her.
- I'm a fool.

535
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:36,717
I should have told him to tie her to a mule
and send her back where she belongs.

536
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:39,625
In what language
would you have told him that?

537
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:42,666
All right, she may be
of some use in that respect.

538
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:46,931
And then there's always
the blessed chance the rope may break.

539
00:48:59,149 --> 00:49:01,913
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- Quite.

540
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:04,749
Hans insisted on a double rope, you see.

541
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:09,418
- Did he indeed? How solicitous.
- But that was for Gertrude.

542
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,628
Poor Sir Oliver, stuck with a woman.

543
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:16,024
If only you could see your face.

544
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:20,867
That's my consolation, madam.
I don't have to look at it. You do.

545
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:48,994
- There isn't enough rope in all Europe.
- Perhaps this is the wrong entrance.

546
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:51,296
The sign was unmistakable.

547
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:54,303
But there's no other way to continue.

548
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,898
Gertrude!

549
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,603
Gertrude!

550
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:23,657
He says there's a tunnel on the other side...

551
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:26,168
slanting downhill but walkable.

552
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,363
Eureka!

553
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:34,269
Thank you.

554
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:42,678
Now then, a general summary.

555
00:50:43,253 --> 00:50:47,690
A: We must never use more than
two Ruhmkorff lamps at a time.

556
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:51,319
B: We will not be needing
our breathing equipment for a long stretch.

557
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:54,694
Nevertheless, none of us
must ever take a step without it.

558
00:50:54,798 --> 00:51:00,134
C: Use canteens freely for now. There'll be
plenty of mineral springs on our way.

559
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:03,071
As my husband's charts indicated.

560
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:08,100
Is Professor Goetaborg to be with us
on our entire journey, madam?

561
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:09,873
Sorry.

562
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:14,615
Well, every journey begins with a first step.

563
00:51:14,685 --> 00:51:16,846
May the good Lord be with us.

564
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,013
Onward.

565
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:23,417
And let's have some music.
Alec, will you start us off?

566
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:23,944
Miss Jenny.

567
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:32,487
I saw you turn pale when the dominie spoke
of those in peril at the far ends of the earth.

568
00:52:32,563 --> 00:52:36,021
The far ends of the earth -
at least that would be somewhere.

569
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:41,264
There was a clipping in a Stockholm paper.
A dispatch from Reykjavik.

570
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:45,430
- I can only read their names.
- I had it translated.

571
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:50,173
The last news was that they went up Mount
Sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys.

572
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,144
Yes?

573
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:54,547
And then the animals
came down without their packs.

574
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:56,710
- And?
- And that's all.

575
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:02,616
Oliver S Lindenbrook, Alexander McEwen,

576
00:53:02,693 --> 00:53:06,129
Hans Belker and... Madam...

577
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:09,597
- What's it?
- It seems a woman went with them.

578
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:12,634
A woman!

579
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:05,515
You know what they'll call that
in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich?

580
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:09,456
A slight tremor,
coming from undefined regions.

581
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:15,127
Well, we've lived through
a slight tremor. Let us proceed.

582
00:54:37,654 --> 00:54:40,248
It seems to be moving away from us.

583
00:54:40,357 --> 00:54:44,521
Madam, in these regions I'd never venture
to say that anything is moving away -

584
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:45,959
or coming towards us.

585
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:50,261
The only thing we can be certain of
is that danger is always with us.

586
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:52,427
We might as well ignore it.

587
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:14,281
Run!

588
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:50,917
Jump!

589
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:13,608
The three notches.

590
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:19,282
The three notches of Arne Saknussem.

591
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:22,654
- What does that mean?
- We've been shown the right path.

592
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:24,853
Alec, the plumb bob.

593
00:56:26,396 --> 00:56:30,628
Look. Without these marks,
we would have gone astray.

594
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:33,862
We'd have wasted months
exploring endlessly.

595
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:37,432
We might have taken
any one of these channels.

596
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:40,874
But our great colleague
maketh a path for our feet.

597
00:56:48,952 --> 00:56:51,887
Well, you all deserve a rest. Let us have tea.

598
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:55,514
With a double ration of raisins.

599
00:56:57,728 --> 00:57:00,253
May I comb my hair first, Professor?

600
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:04,632
Ladies on the left, gentlemen on the right.

601
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:29,517
What is it, madam?

602
00:57:30,127 --> 00:57:35,827
If we'd known that you had nightmares, we'd
have made different sleeping arrangements.

603
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:39,860
Someone is walking up there.

604
00:57:40,904 --> 00:57:44,067
I heard footsteps. Human footsteps.

605
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:49,272
Madam, since the beginning of time
all women have heard footsteps up there.

606
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:51,871
My hearing is extremely acute.

607
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:54,644
The hearing of all women is extremely acute.

608
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:59,484
My wife used to hear rats in the attic, usually
the nights before I had an important lecture.

609
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:02,148
I used to go up, armed with a broom.

610
00:58:03,193 --> 00:58:05,661
Alec, go up and find out. Hans.

611
00:58:05,762 --> 00:58:09,163
Madam, will you leave those men alone?
They need rest.

612
00:58:09,232 --> 00:58:13,362
Moreover, it was stipulated
that I give the orders.

613
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:16,666
There's no need to use
that patient voice with me.

614
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:19,435
Would you rather I used an impatient voice?

615
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:23,240
Professor Lindenbrook,
I am a member of this expedition,

616
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:26,646
and as such I intend to report
any observation I make.

617
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:30,452
Alec.

618
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:36,186
Put it down in the record that a member
of the expedition reported... rats in the attic.

619
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:39,220
Lights out.

620
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:58,239
Don't be afraid, madam.
I'm right here.

621
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,929
Conceal these marks completely.

622
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:57,198
I'll give them some new ones.

623
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:36,339
This is steeper than anything
we've encountered.

624
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:39,347
It's just as well we all had a good night's rest.

625
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:41,508
Alec, take this down.

626
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:44,843
"21st day of our descent."

627
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:51,349
"Starting from an estimated depth of 129km,
limestone formation continues."

628
01:00:52,762 --> 01:00:55,731
Kai-ai, Professor.
Here are the three notches again.

629
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:57,892
Good.

630
01:01:04,474 --> 01:01:09,241
- Gertrude, wrong turn.
- Let's see. What have we here?

631
01:01:09,846 --> 01:01:15,079
One heads 220º south-southwest,
the other 160º south-southeast.

632
01:01:15,151 --> 01:01:19,451
Strange. I would have wagered
we'd have to bear in that direction.

633
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:22,491
That was Gertrude's feeling too.

634
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,084
Are you sure your compass is right?

635
01:01:26,262 --> 01:01:28,321
Quite.

636
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:46,508
What's he saying?

637
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:51,885
Hans is wondering about
the ultimate goal of our expedition.

638
01:01:51,955 --> 01:01:55,083
- He's asking why.
- Alec, suppose you tell him.

639
01:01:57,594 --> 01:02:02,429
Well, why does man freeze to death
trying to reach the North Pole?

640
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:08,127
Why does man drive himself to suffer
the steam and heat of the Amazon?

641
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,869
Why does he stagger his mind
with the mathematics of the sky?

642
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:16,275
Once a question has arisen
in the human brain,

643
01:02:16,346 --> 01:02:20,806
the answer must be found
if it takes 100 years. 1,000 years.

644
01:02:20,884 --> 01:02:24,911
Let's hear you render that into
a few well-chosen Icelandic words.

645
01:02:25,455 --> 01:02:29,016
Why not simply tell him
scientists have bats in their belfries?

646
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:43,771
Are you all right? Can you unhook yourself?

647
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:48,273
Hans.

648
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:03,257
- Grab his hand.
- I didn't see it.

649
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:07,288
Never mind about that.

650
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,234
How is it possible?
This way was clearly indicated.

651
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:16,535
There must have been a quake
since Arne Saknussem's day.

652
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:21,076
This is no recent fissure. This has
been here since the beginning of time.

653
01:03:21,144 --> 01:03:24,272
I was not in a position
to observe it scientifically.

654
01:03:24,347 --> 01:03:27,908
We've made a mistake
somewhere. But where?

655
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:51,532
What are you doing here?
We're supposed to stay together.

656
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:54,075
And we must never have
more than two lamps.

657
01:03:54,177 --> 01:03:57,669
We've been tricked.
Tricked into the wrong tunnel.

658
01:03:57,747 --> 01:04:00,875
Those three notches
are not Arne Saknussem's.

659
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:06,254
She's right, Professor.
Someone has passed through before us.

660
01:04:06,322 --> 01:04:08,449
No need to ask who.

661
01:04:08,525 --> 01:04:11,653
Madam... heard him last night.

662
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:16,390
Now she's saying "I told you so."
Silently, I admit, but she's saying it.

663
01:04:16,466 --> 01:04:20,402
When I wish to say something,
Professor, I say it - aloud.

664
01:04:21,337 --> 01:04:25,103
Due to this development, I have no choice
but to break up the expedition.

665
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,438
- We must return.
- Why?

666
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,502
You don't strike me
as a man who frightens easily.

667
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:33,241
I'm not thinking of myself. You know that.

668
01:04:33,316 --> 01:04:37,685
- I must think of you, a woman.
- We agreed I was to be one of your men.

669
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:41,713
- But if there is a madman loose...
- He's against all of us.

670
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:44,156
Against the very concept of this journey.

671
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:51,690
What's happened? What's he saying?

672
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:54,735
He said we should go back to where Alec fell.

673
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:02,143
But it's not on our route. If we're to go ahead,
we have no time for detours.

674
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:04,236
Then you wait here.

675
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:35,677
If only my Jenny were here to see this.

676
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:53,895
Madam, now that the boy has gone
and Hans doesn't understand English,

677
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:56,693
I must ask rather a delicate question.

678
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,100
I'm blushing already.

679
01:06:00,236 --> 01:06:03,501
You're wearing... stays, are you not?

680
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:04,470
Professor!

681
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:07,907
Yes, I thought so.
I can hear them creaking as you walk along.

682
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:10,070
What I wear is not your business.

683
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:14,275
Everything is my business. We'll look
the other way while you discard them.

684
01:06:14,384 --> 01:06:16,079
Professor, you go too far.

685
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:18,517
We're approaching regions of excessive heat.

686
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:22,182
Nothing must impede
anyone's breathing in any way.

687
01:06:45,682 --> 01:06:48,617
Alec! Leaving in a few minutes!

688
01:08:01,824 --> 01:08:05,021
I've got to take a specimen
of this back to Edinburgh,

689
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:07,561
if it's the last thing I do.

690
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:19,268
Unique. Inexplicable.

691
01:08:25,214 --> 01:08:30,311
All right, ready to go, if that boy Alec
would be good enough to appear.

692
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,513
Where the devil is he?

693
01:08:56,846 --> 01:08:58,939
It's a blind alley!

694
01:09:02,118 --> 01:09:04,348
Keep back!

695
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:38,579
Professor!

696
01:09:56,038 --> 01:09:56,936
Hans!

697
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,550
Good God!

698
01:11:00,303 --> 01:11:03,898
Hold on. Hold on to my arm... my shoulder!

699
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:08,440
Little bit... Hold on. That's it.

700
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:16,677
Praise the Lord!

701
01:12:20,316 --> 01:12:22,409
Alec.

702
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,053
Professor!

703
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:08,288
Hello! Hello!

704
01:13:11,434 --> 01:13:13,698
Professor! Professor! Here I am!

705
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:11,004
Salt.

706
01:17:39,101 --> 01:17:40,898
Alec!

707
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:46,433
Alec!

708
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:51,103
Professor.

709
01:17:51,847 --> 01:17:55,874
Professor, you can't go on this way.
I've kept track of the passage of days.

710
01:17:55,951 --> 01:17:58,920
- You haven't.
- We'll try the cross-channel over there.

711
01:17:59,021 --> 01:18:02,457
We were in that channel yesterday.
We left marks.

712
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:06,961
- You won't find him there.
- I've got to find him. I'm responsible.

713
01:18:13,302 --> 01:18:14,997
Look.

714
01:18:18,674 --> 01:18:21,905
No need to translate.
I can see that this is a recent break.

715
01:18:22,011 --> 01:18:22,875
Alec!

716
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,119
Can you hear me?

717
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:35,723
If you're down there, give us a sign!

718
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:43,795
Alec, listen carefully. When the echoes stop,
you must try to answer.

719
01:18:43,866 --> 01:18:47,700
If you're injured,
if you can't talk, make an effort.

720
01:18:47,803 --> 01:18:53,105
Pick up a pebble and scratch the rock.
We'll hear you, I promise you.

721
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:55,267
Just give us a sign.

722
01:19:13,862 --> 01:19:18,697
A phosphorescent pool.
A strange grave for a young Scot.

723
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:25,267
Professor, there's no use.

724
01:19:25,374 --> 01:19:27,604
How can I live with myself?

725
01:19:27,676 --> 01:19:32,875
Accept his loss, like one soldier
accepts the loss of another soldier.

726
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:35,449
You must continue with what you started.

727
01:19:35,517 --> 01:19:38,577
You must go on with
the Lindenbrook Expedition.

728
01:19:38,687 --> 01:19:44,717
- The Lindenbrook Expedition!
- Yes. Go on with it.

729
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:47,796
It was his project as much as it was yours.

730
01:19:49,098 --> 01:19:51,293
Yes, you're right.

731
01:19:53,035 --> 01:19:58,405
We will proceed. But we won't call it
the Lindenbrook Expedition any more.

732
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:03,141
From now on
it's the Alec McEwen Expedition.

733
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:46,150
No broken bones? Ribs all right?

734
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:48,382
Good. Get up.

735
01:20:52,261 --> 01:20:55,355
Down there, food and water. Refresh yourself.

736
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:01,593
So you've lost your friends? Just as well.

737
01:21:12,014 --> 01:21:13,709
It's my servant.

738
01:21:16,485 --> 01:21:21,149
Too much heat, too much load...
too much fear.

739
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:24,418
You're younger. You'll do to carry my things.

740
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:28,625
I'm not your servant, Count Saknussem.

741
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:35,159
Pride? Rather out of place here. Eat, drink,
then pick up those things. I'm in a hurry.

742
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:38,637
- To steal the professor's project?
- Steal?

743
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:44,270
Listen, young foreigner,
I don't have to steal what belongs to me.

744
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:46,871
You're in my world now.

745
01:21:54,656 --> 01:21:57,557
Stop. I need someone to carry my equipment.

746
01:21:59,061 --> 01:22:04,021
You will never find your companions or your
way out. You need me as much as I need you.

747
01:22:04,099 --> 01:22:06,260
You found me. My friends could find me too.

748
01:22:06,335 --> 01:22:10,635
Very well. You'll carry it
with one arm, not two!

749
01:22:20,749 --> 01:22:23,217
- A hail of bullets.
- No, no.

750
01:22:23,285 --> 01:22:27,278
It's a multiple echo,
reverberating through the rock chambers.

751
01:22:27,356 --> 01:22:30,450
The last echo will give us the direction.

752
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:38,257
166º south-southeast.

753
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:59,123
Alec. Alec.

754
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,155
Alec. Alec!

755
01:23:06,532 --> 01:23:10,298
We'd given you up, but you're alive, laddie.

756
01:23:10,369 --> 01:23:12,462
You're alive!

757
01:23:15,774 --> 01:23:17,867
Professor.

758
01:23:18,944 --> 01:23:20,502
Hans.

759
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,672
Just to see you...

760
01:23:25,517 --> 01:23:27,747
Where was he?

761
01:23:27,853 --> 01:23:31,914
I... I didn't think he'd shoot, but he did.

762
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:35,926
Of course I did. What did you expect?

763
01:23:36,862 --> 01:23:40,491
You are trespassers here.
I am the owner of this domain.

764
01:23:43,502 --> 01:23:46,471
You are also the murderer of my husband.

765
01:23:46,538 --> 01:23:49,871
I claimed my rights. He would not listen.

766
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:54,936
Count Saknussem, in the name of your great
ancestor, put down that preposterous gun.

767
01:23:55,013 --> 01:23:58,346
No harm will come of it
if you accept my terms.

768
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:03,912
You will go back the way you came, but you
will leave the equipment I need and that man.

769
01:24:07,259 --> 01:24:09,750
You're not going to listen to a murderer?

770
01:24:09,862 --> 01:24:12,057
Never interrupt a murderer, madam.

771
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:15,294
I resent that bourgeois classification.

772
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:20,236
I'll spare your lives.
You have my word of honor.

773
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:25,468
Give me your hand on that.

774
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:34,176
A bourgeois trick.

775
01:24:34,286 --> 01:24:36,345
So sorry.

776
01:24:42,194 --> 01:24:47,791
Now then, before we continue on our
journey, we must perform a solemn duty.

777
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,959
We have to hold court.

778
01:24:53,872 --> 01:24:59,071
Here, hundreds of kilometers beneath
the surface of the earth, we are the law.

779
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:04,847
The defendant stands accused
of one murder and one act of mayhem.

780
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:08,215
To preserve legal formalities
I must ask you, as jurors,

781
01:25:08,287 --> 01:25:10,915
is the defendant guilty or not guilty?

782
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:13,082
Guilty.

783
01:25:14,126 --> 01:25:16,287
Guilty.

784
01:25:30,108 --> 01:25:32,167
Guilty.

785
01:25:33,912 --> 01:25:37,473
Then the mandatory sentence is death.

786
01:25:40,085 --> 01:25:45,284
There are two bullets left. Madam,
will you be good enough to explain to Hans?

787
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:47,848
We will follow the route
marked by the notches.

788
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:52,124
He is to wait here for ten minutes,
then carry out the sentence.

789
01:25:57,469 --> 01:26:01,166
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I can carry something with my left hand.

790
01:26:01,273 --> 01:26:05,642
You can carry yourself for a couple of days.
That's all we can expect.

791
01:26:06,945 --> 01:26:12,884
Sir Oliver, there's a slight problem.
Our friend Hans refuses to shoot the count.

792
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:16,045
What do you mean, "refuses"?
It's a court order.

793
01:26:16,121 --> 01:26:19,921
It seems his family have been loyal
to the Saknussems for generations

794
01:26:20,025 --> 01:26:22,858
and, well, he cannot touch the gun.

795
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:25,055
This is contempt of court.

796
01:26:26,365 --> 01:26:29,857
- All right, Alec.
- No, no, Professor... I mean, Sir Oliver.

797
01:26:29,968 --> 01:26:34,962
You mustn't look at me. I, um...
I couldn't pull the trigger with my left hand.

798
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:44,708
Oh, no. You... you couldn't consider
for a moment that I could do it.

799
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,980
- After all, I'm a woman.
- I see.

800
01:26:48,086 --> 01:26:52,716
For weeks you've been denying your sex,
and now you fall back on it.

801
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:57,785
I would say the natural executioner
would be the leader of the expedition.

802
01:26:58,931 --> 01:27:01,297
We must face the truth, sir.

803
01:27:01,366 --> 01:27:05,860
We're much too civilized to...
to do away with a fellow human being.

804
01:27:05,938 --> 01:27:09,704
What do you propose? Drag him with us?
Feed him? Let him share our glory?

805
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,901
Stop fiddling with those lamps.

806
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:18,806
What's he jabbering about?

807
01:27:18,884 --> 01:27:22,945
I'll tell you what he's saying.
The lamps are giving out.

808
01:27:23,055 --> 01:27:27,924
And I'll give you the reason. The induction
coils have been corroded by the salt.

809
01:27:28,026 --> 01:27:31,894
To save what we can, I insist that
we leave these regions at once.

810
01:27:31,964 --> 01:27:34,057
You insist?!

811
01:27:38,971 --> 01:27:42,737
As a matter of fact,
he's bloody well right. Let's be off.

812
01:27:52,985 --> 01:27:58,480
You realize Saknussem's unfastened
himself from the rope again and gone off?

813
01:27:58,557 --> 01:28:01,549
What's the harm?
He'll be back when it's time to eat.

814
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:05,323
The harm is, madam,
that he's wasting a lamp.

815
01:28:34,693 --> 01:28:37,218
Madam, will you try your lamp, please?

816
01:28:46,838 --> 01:28:48,897
- It's dead.
- Yours, Alec?

817
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:58,444
When these things are gone,
they're really gone.

818
01:28:59,685 --> 01:29:04,019
Madam, make a final note,
while you've still light enough to write by.

819
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:07,456
- Let me, madam. My arm's quite well now.
- No need.

820
01:29:08,994 --> 01:29:11,519
"We've covered another 92km."

821
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:14,121
"Temperature dropped seven degrees."

822
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:19,495
"It's surprisingly cooler than anticipated...

823
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,835
but darkness is closing about us."

824
01:29:22,908 --> 01:29:25,001
"This may be our last entry."

825
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,607
Hans and I can cut
some rope into some torches.

826
01:29:33,685 --> 01:29:38,952
That's a good idea. What puzzles me is that
the three notches of old Arne Saknussem

827
01:29:39,057 --> 01:29:41,685
still keep pointing our way.

828
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,820
What kind of a lamp did he have?

829
01:29:44,896 --> 01:29:47,626
Perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp.

830
01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:52,033
From here on neither do you, Sir Oliver.
Why don't you turn it off?

831
01:29:53,705 --> 01:29:55,764
Yes, just switch it off.

832
01:30:03,548 --> 01:30:05,641
Why, it's miraculous!

833
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,511
Look at this.

834
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:19,327
What is it, sir?

835
01:30:19,397 --> 01:30:22,332
A form of algae with
the property of luminescence.

836
01:30:22,467 --> 01:30:26,198
Light without heat. A cool, chemical light.

837
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:29,933
You've seen fireflies, madam,
and glowworms,

838
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:33,671
and forms of life in the sea
that generate their own light.

839
01:30:33,745 --> 01:30:36,270
The same principle is involved here.

840
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,942
"256th day."

841
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:20,157
"The phenomenal winds
vanished as abruptly as they came."

842
01:31:21,459 --> 01:31:24,986
"We are now in a stupendous
deposit of cinnabar."

843
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:29,329
What's that curious mark
you make on every page?

844
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,926
ME. McEwen Expedition.

845
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:35,771
So whenever I've said
Lindenbrook Expedition,

846
01:31:35,874 --> 01:31:38,342
you've written McEwen Expedition?

847
01:31:40,111 --> 01:31:44,377
May I remind you that months ago
you gave me explicit orders to that effect?

848
01:31:44,516 --> 01:31:49,544
You may not remind me! I do not wish
to be corrected by you incessantly.

849
01:31:49,621 --> 01:31:50,883
Is that what I'm doing?

850
01:31:50,956 --> 01:31:55,586
You're doing it with your looks, the inflection
of your voice, the very posture of your body.

851
01:31:55,694 --> 01:31:59,528
Your entire presence
is a constant criticism of me.

852
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:02,431
I'm tired of it. I've had enough.

853
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,094
You've had enough.

854
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:13,537
Well, let me tell you, you dried-up walnut
of a man, if anyone's had enough, it's me.

855
01:32:14,045 --> 01:32:16,707
- It's I.
- It's I, it's me!

856
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:20,308
It's Carla Goetaborg! I quit! I am leaving!

857
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:25,582
May I send for madam's horse and carriage?

858
01:32:36,067 --> 01:32:38,126
Well...

859
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:41,534
Well, at least you know I have a temper.

860
01:32:41,606 --> 01:32:45,804
And from now on Alec will keep the charts.
Alec! Alec!

861
01:32:47,012 --> 01:32:48,912
Why can't he stay around?

862
01:33:31,923 --> 01:33:34,721
Kai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!

863
01:33:46,905 --> 01:33:49,339
Mushrooms! A forest of mushrooms!

864
01:33:49,407 --> 01:33:54,811
They may be hundreds of years old, but
the small ones we can eat! They're delicious.

865
01:33:57,482 --> 01:34:01,179
To think they grew without sun
this far under the earth!

866
01:34:08,827 --> 01:34:10,886
All the food we can eat!

867
01:34:17,535 --> 01:34:19,628
It's tougher than leather.

868
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:25,375
We'll have new soles for our shoes.

869
01:34:30,348 --> 01:34:32,475
It's like an oak tree.

870
01:35:15,427 --> 01:35:20,865
Madam, you're magnificent. Mushroom steak,
mushroom soup, mushroom hash.

871
01:35:20,932 --> 01:35:25,631
Let me say this. If we'd had one more week
of that salted beef, I would have perished.

872
01:35:25,703 --> 01:35:28,171
Don't be too happy.
After some months of this,

873
01:35:28,273 --> 01:35:31,299
you'll be smacking your lips
at the thought of salt beef.

874
01:35:31,376 --> 01:35:36,336
Yes, months, months.
If we only knew how many more.

875
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:39,246
There's no term to the work of a scientist.

876
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:42,980
Let me say this, madam.
If you hadn't been along,

877
01:35:43,088 --> 01:35:46,524
this whole journey
would have been unbearable.

878
01:35:46,591 --> 01:35:49,651
But that's not
Professor Lindenbrook's feeling.

879
01:35:49,727 --> 01:35:51,957
It's mine.

880
01:35:52,063 --> 01:35:56,659
You see, we have no sun,
no moon and no stars.

881
01:35:58,269 --> 01:36:00,760
But then you're here.

882
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:06,408
And what is the name of the girl you love?

883
01:36:06,478 --> 01:36:09,914
- I beg your pardon?
- The girl you love?

884
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:13,142
- What's her name?
- Jenny.

885
01:36:13,251 --> 01:36:16,414
But why would you want
to know thatjust now?

886
01:36:16,488 --> 01:36:20,652
Dear Alec! There are times
when it's advisable

887
01:36:20,725 --> 01:36:23,285
to jog a young man's memory.

888
01:36:31,469 --> 01:36:33,334
Professor?

889
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:38,166
Here's some hot mushroom porridge
for you, Sir Oliver.

890
01:36:51,256 --> 01:36:54,453
I slept as I never slept in Edinburgh.

891
01:36:54,526 --> 01:37:01,398
No street noises, no church bells,
no clatter of pans from the kitchen.

892
01:37:01,499 --> 01:37:03,933
I may move here permanently.

893
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:11,341
What's our large friend doing over there?

894
01:37:11,442 --> 01:37:13,433
I don't know.

895
01:37:13,511 --> 01:37:15,741
Special command of His Majesty.

896
01:37:15,847 --> 01:37:21,149
Is that madman still giving orders?
This is supposed to be his rest period.

897
01:37:21,719 --> 01:37:26,713
The minute you fell asleep he went off
in that direction, through the tunnel.

898
01:37:26,824 --> 01:37:30,954
He came back long enough
to order the felling of the mushrooms.

899
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:41,671
What in the world can he want with all those?

900
01:38:10,902 --> 01:38:14,633
You've come to ask me
why I didn't take my rest period.

901
01:38:14,706 --> 01:38:19,473
I don't sleep. I hate those little slices of death.

902
01:38:19,544 --> 01:38:24,106
- It's a sea.
- It's an ocean with waves and currents.

903
01:38:24,215 --> 01:38:26,149
The ocean of the underworld.

904
01:38:26,251 --> 01:38:28,845
Some earthquake,
before the beginning of history,

905
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:34,119
cracked wide open the great sea
and through the fissures poured this.

906
01:38:34,225 --> 01:38:36,489
The fissures closed again.

907
01:38:36,561 --> 01:38:39,724
No map ever recorded the Saknussem Ocean.

908
01:38:41,633 --> 01:38:44,568
I so christened it while you were asleep.

909
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:48,537
It's the prerogative of the discoverer.
I congratulate you.

910
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:53,077
You realize, Lindenbrook, that from now on
there will be no notches to follow.

911
01:38:53,144 --> 01:38:56,079
That's why you ordered a raft. I approve.

912
01:39:11,462 --> 01:39:12,520
A dimetrodon!

913
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:15,292
If I had my gun,
we'd have fresh meat for dinner.

914
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,096
That's what he's seen. He's a flesh eater.

915
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:26,108
- Can he swim?
- No, thank God.

916
01:43:18,643 --> 01:43:21,134
The wind blowing down the high street!

917
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:24,439
Here.

918
01:43:24,515 --> 01:43:26,574
I brought you some nice apples.

919
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:33,951
- I wonder if it's cold where they are.
- Where they are. Indeed.

920
01:43:34,992 --> 01:43:37,085
Are they anyplace?

921
01:43:55,112 --> 01:43:57,979
McEwen, put that toy away
and take over the rudder.

922
01:43:58,115 --> 01:43:59,548
Yes, sir.

923
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:03,942
- I didn't tell you to throw it away.
- It flew out of my hand!

924
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:07,351
My watch!

925
01:44:09,093 --> 01:44:12,085
- Save the instruments.
- What's happening?

926
01:44:12,863 --> 01:44:15,354
My ring! My wedding ring.

927
01:44:15,466 --> 01:44:19,732
A field of force that snatches gold away.
This is it! This is it!

928
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:23,329
The junction of magnetic forces
from the North Pole and South Pole!

929
01:44:23,474 --> 01:44:25,533
The center of the earth!

930
01:44:36,487 --> 01:44:38,546
Hang on!

931
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,498
Hold on to your rope!

932
01:45:16,494 --> 01:45:18,553
No!

933
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:56,960
Is everyone here?

934
01:45:57,068 --> 01:45:59,059
Madam Goetaborg,

935
01:45:59,170 --> 01:46:01,263
Alec, Hans.

936
01:46:05,042 --> 01:46:06,942
Gertrude.

937
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:10,140
And His Highness over there.

938
01:46:13,551 --> 01:46:18,420
So... the expedition with all the names...

939
01:46:18,489 --> 01:46:20,650
ends like this.

940
01:46:20,725 --> 01:46:23,353
We're alive, aren't we?

941
01:46:23,461 --> 01:46:26,328
After all, we did hit the center of the earth.

942
01:46:26,864 --> 01:46:28,923
It hit us, laddie.

943
01:46:34,839 --> 01:46:39,299
No need to tell us, madam.
He wants to know where we go from here.

944
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:43,041
Tired minds don't plan well.

945
01:46:43,147 --> 01:46:45,240
Sleep first, plan later.

946
01:46:49,754 --> 01:46:52,780
When I refused to eat my porridge
when I was a boy,

947
01:46:52,923 --> 01:46:55,517
my mother - like all mothers - used to say

948
01:46:55,593 --> 01:47:01,156
"Oliver, the day may come when
you'd very much like to have that porridge."

949
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:08,303
Why do you look so surprised? Is it
incredible to you that I ever had a mother?

950
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:15,269
I was just thinking how proud she'd be of
that little boy who wouldn't eat his porridge.

951
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,129
Here, duck.

952
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:17,866
Here, duck.

953
01:48:30,454 --> 01:48:32,547
Gertrude?

954
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,053
Gertrude?

955
01:48:45,236 --> 01:48:47,295
Gertrude?

956
01:48:50,241 --> 01:48:51,640
Gertrude!

957
01:49:00,317 --> 01:49:02,308
Gertrude!

958
01:49:06,991 --> 01:49:09,050
Gertrude! Gertrude!

959
01:49:09,894 --> 01:49:11,987
Gertrude!

960
01:49:53,137 --> 01:49:54,900
Hans! Hans!

961
01:50:01,946 --> 01:50:04,039
Why do you look at me like that?

962
01:50:05,349 --> 01:50:07,146
Hans!

963
01:50:07,885 --> 01:50:11,184
I needed food, so I took it.

964
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:16,057
Professor, tell your man to calm himself.

965
01:50:16,126 --> 01:50:20,460
I'm not in the mood to engage in a dispute
about a slaughtered duck.

966
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:24,297
Professor, stop him! Stop this fool!

967
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:26,461
- Hans!
- Hans!

968
01:50:38,716 --> 01:50:42,174
You ingrates! What can you do without me?

969
01:50:42,286 --> 01:50:46,154
Only I can show you
the way out of this realm of mine.

970
01:50:46,223 --> 01:50:47,315
Look out!

971
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,683
This is the sunken city.

972
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:29,363
After 5,000 years,
behold a fragment of the lost Atlantis.

973
01:51:39,777 --> 01:51:42,905
All we know about it
comes from the Greek.

974
01:51:43,013 --> 01:51:48,007
The floor of the sea opened up
and swallowed the whole island of Atlantis.

975
01:51:50,888 --> 01:51:54,187
This must have been the market square.

976
01:51:55,726 --> 01:52:00,220
Professor. Professor,
this looks like some sort of inn.

977
01:52:02,099 --> 01:52:05,500
It is an inn. An eating place, certainly.

978
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:09,901
"Eating." What a word.
What a wonderful word.

979
01:52:13,077 --> 01:52:17,980
Well, we've learned one thing
about the inhabitants of Atlantis.

980
01:52:18,115 --> 01:52:20,174
They ate oysters.

981
01:52:34,098 --> 01:52:37,499
Stale bread. We must speak to the baker.

982
01:52:38,502 --> 01:52:41,062
Madam! Madam!

983
01:52:41,772 --> 01:52:43,000
Já?

984
01:52:47,111 --> 01:52:51,775
- He's asking if that was a temple to their god.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.

985
01:52:54,885 --> 01:52:58,685
It's some sort of altar stone
where the sacred flame burned.

986
01:52:58,755 --> 01:53:03,283
- It's serpentine, isn't it?
- Exactly. A massive form of asbestos.

987
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:08,297
To think that at a moment like this
I've no pad and pencil to record it all.

988
01:53:15,906 --> 01:53:18,704
Turn around, madam. Don't look.

989
01:53:18,775 --> 01:53:20,868
What is it?

990
01:53:22,446 --> 01:53:26,940
The great Arne Saknussem, I presume.

991
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,518
So this is as far as you came.

992
01:53:29,586 --> 01:53:33,750
What's the matter with you two?
Say "how do you do" to a brave man.

993
01:53:35,192 --> 01:53:39,788
He must have dragged himself here
with a broken leg. Look at that tibia.

994
01:53:41,165 --> 01:53:43,929
- You won't find anything edible in there.
- Why not?

995
01:53:44,001 --> 01:53:46,731
The Chinese eat eggs over 400 years old.

996
01:53:49,273 --> 01:53:51,537
Gunpowder.

997
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:55,303
Professor, look at his right hand.

998
01:53:55,379 --> 01:53:57,472
It's pointing somewhere.

999
01:53:59,316 --> 01:54:01,375
To that shaft over there.

1000
01:54:39,756 --> 01:54:43,920
Of course! Of course!
This is what the pointing finger meant!

1001
01:54:43,994 --> 01:54:48,294
This is the way up.
He couldn't make it, but we can!

1002
01:54:48,365 --> 01:54:52,995
This is the volcanic chimney.
The violent updraft can mean only one thing:

1003
01:54:53,103 --> 01:54:55,298
A direct hatchway to the surface.

1004
01:54:55,405 --> 01:54:58,533
- And we can climb up.
- Madam, explain to Hans.

1005
01:54:58,609 --> 01:55:01,806
Let him venture 100 meters or so
on reconnoiter.

1006
01:55:01,912 --> 01:55:04,278
The updraft can't carry him away.

1007
01:55:29,139 --> 01:55:32,233
Now I'd say let's roll up our sleeves -
if we had any.

1008
01:55:32,309 --> 01:55:35,244
We mustn't hope for much.
This light won't stay with us.

1009
01:55:35,312 --> 01:55:38,839
- We'll have to provide some kind of light.
- And food.

1010
01:55:38,915 --> 01:55:42,874
I'll go see what I can find.
I'll comb every inch of Atlantis.

1011
01:56:14,951 --> 01:56:17,419
If we only had some shears,
we could cut it off.

1012
01:56:17,487 --> 01:56:19,546
Could we?

1013
01:56:33,437 --> 01:56:35,905
Kai-ai! Kai-ai!

1014
01:56:36,306 --> 01:56:38,638
Kai-ai! Kai-ai!

1015
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:43,645
Flints! I've found some flints.

1016
01:56:45,882 --> 01:56:48,476
Good lad. We won't be walking in darkness.

1017
01:57:03,734 --> 01:57:08,831
I wish I had better news. It gives every
indication of being a perfect passage upward,

1018
01:57:08,905 --> 01:57:11,601
straighter than the one we descended.

1019
01:57:11,675 --> 01:57:14,041
- But...
- But? But?

1020
01:57:14,945 --> 01:57:20,247
There's an obstacle. A gigantic block
of stone obstructs the passageway.

1021
01:57:20,317 --> 01:57:23,286
Hans said only a landslide
could ever move it.

1022
01:57:47,677 --> 01:57:49,736
No, let him be.

1023
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,744
If his hopes hadn't been so high...

1024
01:57:57,387 --> 01:58:00,584
- Alec!
- Yes, sir?

1025
01:58:01,258 --> 01:58:04,716
The haversack -
Arne Saknussem's haversack. Get it.

1026
01:58:04,861 --> 01:58:09,264
If God is with us and that gunpowder
has kept its ginger over the years,

1027
01:58:09,332 --> 01:58:12,062
we'll make that landslide ourselves.

1028
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:59,244
Now, my wonderful companions,

1029
01:58:59,316 --> 01:59:03,047
you realize, I hope,
that we're taking an enormous chance.

1030
01:59:03,119 --> 01:59:05,383
But it's our only chance.

1031
01:59:05,455 --> 01:59:08,982
I guarantee that this'll blow up
the obstructing rock.

1032
01:59:09,059 --> 01:59:14,725
Whether the surrounding rocks will take the
disturbance lightly, I cannot guarantee.

1033
01:59:14,831 --> 01:59:17,197
Let's get what protection we can.

1034
01:59:17,267 --> 01:59:19,326
Into the altar stone.

1035
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:44,051
Dear God, ruler of heaven and earth...

1036
01:59:44,127 --> 01:59:46,857
Don't set any limit to his realm, laddie.

1037
01:59:49,533 --> 01:59:53,230
God of the universe,
we are in thy merciful hands.

1038
02:00:16,393 --> 02:00:19,123
- Look out!
- Run, Professor! A monster!

1039
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:25,593
Let me go!

1040
02:01:16,486 --> 02:01:18,920
We've started an earthquake!

1041
02:02:24,788 --> 02:02:27,552
The lava is pushing us up!

1042
02:02:57,287 --> 02:03:01,724
- It's an earthquake of unusual magnitude!
- More likely it's a volcanic eruption.

1043
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:06,353
Listen to this. "Stromboli, Italy.
First eyewitness report."

1044
02:03:06,463 --> 02:03:10,923
"The capsule of the dead volcano
broke under a tremendous explosion."

1045
02:03:11,034 --> 02:03:15,266
"Rocks of extraordinary size
are being spewed out into the sea."

1046
02:03:40,964 --> 02:03:43,057
Dammi una mano.

1047
02:03:45,969 --> 02:03:48,665
Piano. Piano.

1048
02:03:55,678 --> 02:03:58,704
- Passami il vino.
- Ecco.

1049
02:03:58,782 --> 02:04:00,875
Signora, beva, beva.

1050
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:06,655
Where's Alec?

1051
02:04:12,262 --> 02:04:17,131
Hans says... Alec was thrown
from the altar stone...

1052
02:04:18,535 --> 02:04:21,299
long before we hit the water.

1053
02:04:25,175 --> 02:04:27,769
Non si preoccupi. Abbiamo uno scalino.

1054
02:04:27,877 --> 02:04:31,506
I'm most grateful, ladies,
but my immediate need is not a ladder.

1055
02:04:31,581 --> 02:04:34,914
I need trousers. Pants.

1056
02:04:34,984 --> 02:04:37,475
Pantaloons. Pantaloons.

1057
02:04:38,154 --> 02:04:41,646
- Vuole i pantaloni.
- Pantaloni.

1058
02:04:42,292 --> 02:04:45,693
Don't bring them yourselves.
Send a friar, a monk.

1059
02:04:54,537 --> 02:04:56,596
Excuse me, ladies.

1060
02:04:59,142 --> 02:05:01,201
Excuse me.

1061
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:14,048
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!

1062
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:22,289
Speech! Speech!

1063
02:05:28,171 --> 02:05:33,473
Fellow Scots, if these shouts of yours
express some pleasure

1064
02:05:33,543 --> 02:05:37,274
that we've returned alive, I thank you deeply.

1065
02:05:37,347 --> 02:05:42,307
However, if they're meant as praise
for a successful scientist,

1066
02:05:42,385 --> 02:05:45,047
I must disclaim that honor.

1067
02:05:47,957 --> 02:05:52,985
No. A scientist who cannot prove what he has
accomplished has accomplished nothing.

1068
02:05:53,096 --> 02:05:55,929
I have no records, no shred of evidence.

1069
02:05:55,999 --> 02:06:01,767
I will never embarrass this distinguished
university by asking that it take my word.

1070
02:06:01,871 --> 02:06:04,135
Let me say only this.

1071
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:10,645
300 years ago a daring man undertook
a perilous journey and never came back.

1072
02:06:10,713 --> 02:06:14,308
We followed his path and returned,
by the grace of God -

1073
02:06:14,417 --> 02:06:16,442
and a heathen altar stone.

1074
02:06:16,519 --> 02:06:19,613
One day someone else -

1075
02:06:19,689 --> 02:06:23,750
it may be you, my boy,
or your sons or your grandsons -

1076
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:26,294
will pick up where we left off.

1077
02:06:26,362 --> 02:06:30,731
This, I know: The spirit of man
cannot be stopped.

1078
02:06:37,674 --> 02:06:40,108
Splendid, Oliver. Splendid speech.

1079
02:06:40,176 --> 02:06:44,112
Professor, here's someone
who wants to say goodbye.

1080
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:46,512
His ship sails at four.

1081
02:06:46,582 --> 02:06:50,177
Hans, old friend.
We never could have done without you.

1082
02:06:50,286 --> 02:06:52,481
He has a speech.

1083
02:06:54,724 --> 02:07:00,594
If you... if you will ever
go down there again,

1084
02:07:00,697 --> 02:07:03,723
the center earth, Hans will go too.

1085
02:07:05,101 --> 02:07:06,125
Thank you.

1086
02:07:07,303 --> 02:07:11,239
Did you get your injuries when
the volcano blew up, in the hot lava?

1087
02:07:11,307 --> 02:07:13,332
No, it happened at our wedding.

1088
02:07:13,443 --> 02:07:18,244
He was in such a hurry leaving the church,
he fell all the way down the steps.

1089
02:07:18,314 --> 02:07:22,080
You poor wee bride. After all that waiting.

1090
02:07:22,151 --> 02:07:24,642
It's been no marriage for you at all.

1091
02:07:24,721 --> 02:07:26,814
You underestimate Alec.

1092
02:07:29,559 --> 02:07:33,256
I'm taking the night train to London
and then back to Stockholm.

1093
02:07:33,363 --> 02:07:36,264
Stockholm? But you have ajob
to do here in Edinburgh.

1094
02:07:36,332 --> 02:07:38,527
- I?
- I intend to write my memoirs.

1095
02:07:38,634 --> 02:07:41,432
I can't remember
everything that happened alone.

1096
02:07:41,504 --> 02:07:47,636
Oh, I see. What you need is a widow
who can jog your memory and take dictation.

1097
02:07:47,710 --> 02:07:51,737
I suppose I'm to report every day
from nine till twelve, from two to six?

1098
02:07:51,848 --> 02:07:55,579
No, none of that nonsense.
You can stay in my house.

1099
02:07:55,685 --> 02:07:57,846
And what would Edinburgh say?

1100
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:02,323
It's one thing to spend one's days
and nights with a man under the earth,

1101
02:08:02,425 --> 02:08:05,258
another under one roof in Scotland.

1102
02:08:05,328 --> 02:08:07,694
Well, uh... what do you propose?

1103
02:08:08,297 --> 02:08:11,733
That's not a word I'd bandy about, Professor.

1104
02:08:12,135 --> 02:08:14,262
What did I say? Which word?

1105
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:18,039
I thought it would catch in your throat.

1106
02:08:20,276 --> 02:08:22,608
Madam. Madam.

1107
02:08:22,678 --> 02:08:26,079
Thank you. Madam Goetaborg.
Frau Goetaborg!

1108
02:08:26,149 --> 02:08:28,242
Carla!

1109
02:08:29,519 --> 02:08:31,510
Yes... Oliver?

1110
02:08:31,621 --> 02:08:33,316
Carla...

1111
02:08:35,691 --> 02:08:37,659
I warn you...

1112
02:08:37,727 --> 02:08:39,854
I'm wearing stays again.

1113
