I'm afraid I hit the back

It's nothing serious, Officer.

on sailing for beginners?

- It's over there on the table.
- Ah.

Why not a motor boat?

There's no problem
as long as we take this book.

another book. The Bible.

- We got the...

- But the book...

00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,376
I don't think that book
will take us past the breakwater.

Yeah, I guess she's attractive

and shanghaied a whole new crew.

345
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,258
Should be an interesting cruise.

346
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,425
- Cruise?
- Uh-huh.

347
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,063
- Jason's boat never leaves the dock.
- Why not?

348
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,934
Well, for one thing, it's got no motor.

349
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,058
You're kidding.

350
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,102
He took it out and put in a wine cellar.

351
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,436
WAGNER: Mr. Garland.

352
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,822
Yes.

353
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,189
We just got a call in from RCC.
An emergency dispatch, sir.

354
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,236
Emergency, emergency!
Garlotti, start up the engines.

355
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,568
Wagner, crank up the radar.

356
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,073
Somebody get Lieutenant Jordan.
Walsh, please stand by.

357
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,275
- I am standing by, sir.
- Good!

358
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,486
We wanna shove off as soon as
Lieutenant Jordan comes aboard.

359
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,618
Prepare hot soup and blankets
for the survivors.

360
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,785
Seaman, give me a hand
with this tarpaulin.

361
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,877
What's the emergency?

362
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,630
A rowboat stuck on the rocks.

363
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,880
What a shame.

364
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,295
A guy like that deserves the <i>Titanic.</i>

365
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,631
Look busy.

366
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,097
Here are the sails, Stanley.

367
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,465
KATE: Now remember,

368
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,306
this time, when you hoist the main sail,
get it all the way to the top.

369
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,810
Ahoy there, skipper.

370
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,816
KATE: Well, hello.
Can I help you with something?

371
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,570
Yes, you see,
we're going on a picnic and...

372
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,452
See, there's a picnic hamper.

373
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,820
HARRY: Yeah,
so we'd like to rent a sailboat.

374
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,276
Something suitable
for a cruise, like to, uh,

375
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,867
Catalina.

376
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,914
Catalina? I thought you said
we're going to go to Mexi...

377
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,245
He's so anxious.

378
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:51,043
KATE: Well, I'm, uh... Excuse me.

379
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,497
I've got this 28-foot ketch.

380
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,585
Would that be all right?

381
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,967
My father, the old sea dog,
always use to say to me

382
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,888
as we were standing on
the deck of his brigantine,

383
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,349
he'd say, "Son, if you must rent an boat,

384
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,683
"make sure it's a ketch."

385
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,687
Have you got something
a little smaller?

386
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,521
See, I haven't done much sailing.

387
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,395
Ah, bilge water!

388
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,272
The man's a regular jack-tar.

389
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,727
Why, it's a thrill to see him
at the fantail.

390
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,738
Sturdy hand on the spinnaker.

391
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,413
That's a neat trick.

392
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,948
You see, the spinnaker's forward.

393
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,537
Huh? Is she quick?

394
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,116
I was just testing you, ma'am.

395
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,543
After all, I wouldn't want to rent a boat

396
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,251
from a girl who didn't know
her spinnaker from her fantail.

397
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,581
Huh? She's great, right?

398
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,089
I'd like the cut of your jib, ma'am.

399
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,755
Come on, Kate. Before we lose the wind.

400
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,548
Yeah, I'll be right there.

401
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,255
I have a sailing lesson.

402
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,309
Could you put up the sails?

403
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,765
Could Magellan find the Horn?

404
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,902
Well then, I'll see you later.

405
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,194
Smooth getaway.

406
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,900
- She knows.
- Oh, shut up.

407
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,414
KATE: Bye!

408
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,116
All right, come on.
Start putting up the sails.

409
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,082
That's your job, Magellan.

410
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,405
I'm warning you, Max.
Come on. We got work to do.

411
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,746
Charlie, come on.

412
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:18,382
<i>Folks, we'd like you
to stay where you are.</i>

413
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,125
<i>Don't move.</i>

414
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,298
<i>We're sending you a boat
to pick you up in just a few minutes.</i>

415
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,603
You see, Florence?

416
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,097
I told you the Coast Guard
would come and get us.

417
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,391
Lieutenant, RCC called.
Boat capsized, sinking.

418
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:33,975
We gotta move out. Come on, let's go.

419
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,192
Hey!

420
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,227
Garland?

421
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,605
We just got a call up from RCC.

422
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,781
A boat capsized. Sinking.

423
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,605
You can handle this
without us, can't you?

424
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,159
JORDAN: We'll pick you up
on the way back.

425
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,464
I don't know why I ever let you
talk us into buying a boat.

426
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,633
I'm sick of the boat.

427
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,379
I'm sick of fishing.

428
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,723
I'm sick of the whole Pacific Ocean.

429
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,592
You know what I'm sick of?

430
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:07,757
ENSIGN: Ahoy, there.

431
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,810
Don't worry, we'll get you off the rocks.

432
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,806
I'll throw you this line
and I'll give you a tow.

433
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,149
Ahhh!

434
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,194
And the next thing you do
is snap the head of the sail

435
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,067
- to the halyard.
- What's a halyard?

436
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,494
A halyard is what you snap
the head of the sail to.

437
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,785
Now, look alive, swabbies,
or we'll never get to Mexico.

438
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,500
We'll try again.

439
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,836
I'll secure it.

440
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,546
You've done nothing right
since we started.

441
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,851
After all, I was a Girl Scout.

442
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,508
- Oh.
- Okay.

443
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,149
Oh...

444
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,069
Terrific, terrific.

445
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,941
It fell in our prop, sir.

446
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,446
Oh, no.

447
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,991
Give me a knife.

448
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,905
Uh, sir, we're drifting.

449
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,714
I know we're drifting.
Just give me a knife.

450
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,211
- And the tide's going out.
- I know the tide is going out.

451
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,592
Give me a knife.

452
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,046
Hey...

453
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,466
- Hey!
- Slow down!

454
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,092
Slow down!

455
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,894
They didn't slow down.

456
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,019
Whoa!

457
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,649
Hoist the jib. Somebody hoist the jib.

458
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,735
Ahhh, Charlie! Argh, Harry!

459
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,778
HARRY: I said hoist the jib!
Not Charlie!

460
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:57,788
CHARLIE: Harry,
do something! Max, help!

461
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,329
MAX: You're gonna be all right.

462
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,417
CHARLIE: Save me! Save me!

463
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,745
CHARLIE: Stop the boat!
Stop the boat!

464
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,586
Harry, do something.

465
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,932
Easy, Charlie. Easy.

466
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,350
Up.

467
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,850
Max is coming up to help ya.

468
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,720
Max, please hurry!

469
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,176
MAX: Hold on, Charlie! I'm coming.

470
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,438
MAX: Hold on.
CHARLIE: Max, hurry up.

471
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,648
CHARLIE: Get me down outta here, Max.
Get me down!

472
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,072
MAX: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

473
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:27,694
Harry, the book, Harry. Read the book.

474
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,451
- (SCREAMING)
- Whoa!

475
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,736
MAX: Harry!
Steady the boat, Harry!

476
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,333
CHARLIE: Do something!
Harry? Harry?

477
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,292
Whoa, whoa!

478
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,462
Come down.

479
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:41,955
Come down.

480
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,633
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa!

481
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,803
CHARLIE: Max, do something!

482
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,130
Harry, I'm gonna drown.
I can't swim, Harry.

483
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,680
Oh! Uh!

484
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,017
Thanks, Max.

485
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,389
Don't mention it.

486
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:07,976
Harry?

487
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,066
CHARLIE: What does
the book say, Harry?

488
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,662
Harry!

489
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,204
Harry!

490
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,168
Ahhh!

491
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,787
- Right of way, right of way!
- Uh!

492
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,670
Harry!

493
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,669
(HORN BLARING)

494
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,056
Oh, Harry.

495
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,277
Hey, look over there in the rocks.

496
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,708
Looks like one of those
boats from the Coast Guard.

497
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,877
KATE: It's that new ensign.

498
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,876
What a shame.

499
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,802
Why don't we tack over there?

500
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,797
Look out, let's come about.

501
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,894
KATE: Ahoy, there.

502
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,811
Need any help?

503
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,898
No. This is just a drill.

504
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,941
What kind of drill?

505
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,900
Running aground on the rocks drill.

506
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,402
Throw us a line and we'll give you a tow.

507
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:38,945
Don't bother.

508
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,913
Oh, it's no bother.

509
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,411
As a matter of fact, I insist.

510
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,834
Charlie, trim the mainsail.

511
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,207
Do what?

512
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,923
Untie the rope.

513
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,245
Oh.

514
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,763
Not that one.

515
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,300
CHARLIE: Harry!

516
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,509
Harry.

517
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,097
Where are ya, Harry?
Where did you go?

518
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,432
MAX: How do you like sailing
so far, Harry?

519
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,599
HARRY: I'm warning you, Max.
MAX: Harry.

520
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,692
Let me in there.

521
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,106
Now, look what you've done.

522
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,151
What do you want from me?
I never trimmed no main sail before.

523
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,775
- I told you which rope.
- You told me and I pulled.

524
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,450
The wrong rope!

525
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,783
(THUD)

526
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:19,986
What's that?

527
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,486
I don't know. I think we hit something.

528
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,985
There's water in here.
Let's get out of here.

529
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,497
- Water, where?
- Harry, let's get out!

530
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,081
Don't panic! Prepare to abandon ship.

531
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,672
Follow your captain.

532
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,554

CHARLIE: Harry, look.

534
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,507
You did it. You got us to Mexico.

535
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,506
Mexico? Look, dumb-dumb.

536
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,675
Welcome to Tacos Muchos, <i>senores.</i>

537
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,228
I do wish that when you get back to...

539

San Francisco.

542
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,619
They could tow us home.

543
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:07,079
You'll see to it. Ha!

545
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,171
Rescued by a girl in a sailboat.

546
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,344
What kind of image is that

547
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
- for the Coast Guard?
- Well, sir...

548
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,045
I'll tell you what kind of an image it is.

549
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,593
It's a lousy image.

550
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,675
This is the toughest
assignment on the West Coast.

551
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,852
Balboa's a seagoing freeway.

552
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,394
With all the rescuing
we have to do here,

553
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,396
the one kind of rescue we don't need
is rescuing the rescue boat.

554
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:32,901
Yes, sir.

555
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,944
Tomorrow, Mr. Jordan leaves
and the <i>Point Maley</i> is yours.

556
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,449
My advice to you is shape up.

557
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,204
Shape up. Yes, sir.

558
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,408
TAYLOR: Dismissed!

559
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,414
Garland...

560
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,414
If your father handled a boat
the way you do,

561
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,957
we'd all be speaking Japanese.

562
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,714
Japanese.

(NOISY CHATTERING)

564
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,894
- Oh, your hair's lovely.
- Thank you.

565
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,559
Oh, hi.

566
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,103
- Are you alone?
- Yeah, I am.

567
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:15,268
Oh, um,

568
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,731
why don't you give me five minutes?

569
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,784
Okay, you just wait over there
and I'll be right with you.

570
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,149
Right this way, please.

571
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,912
Oh, Clemens. Party of four.
I'll be with you in just one minute.

MAN: Hi, Elaine, nice to see you.

573
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:28,575
- WAITRESS: Dr. Clemens?
- Yes.

574
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,251
Your table's right over there.

575
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,917
WAITRESS: Oh, I'll have a table for you
in just a few minutes, sir.

576
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,924
Uh, have you bumped into anybody

577
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,214
or spilled any drinks yet?

578
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,716
- No.
- Oh.

579
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,930
But the evening's still young.

580
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,854
Right over there. I'll be right with you.

581
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,056
Your table will be ready
in just a minute, Mr. Garland.

582
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,018
Thank you.

583
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,071
And thank you, Miss Fairchild,

584
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,438
for coming to my rescue this afternoon.

585
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:03,783
Oh, it was nothing.

586
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,364
You're too modest.

587
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,161
My commanding officer
was very impressed.

588
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,701
I was just doing my duty.

589
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,578
Law of the sea you know.

590
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,210
Does the law of the sea
say you're suppose to wipe out

591
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,631
an entire career?

592
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:21,126
Let's not get uptight, Mr. Garland.

593
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,633
Remember me?

594
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,128
"Sadie, The Painted Lady."

595
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,426
I apologized for that.
Now what else do you want me to do?

596
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,599
Find a way to get the smell
of turpentine out of my hair.

597
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,469
That was an accident.

598
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,902
I didn't ask for
that kind of introduction.

599
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,483
All right.

600
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,611
Well, why don't we just make
a deal then?

601
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,819
You stay out of my life
and I'll stay out of your career.

602
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,110
- It's a deal.
- Deal.

603
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,403
- Deal, fine.
- WAITRESS: Hey.

604
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,817
I didn't know you two were friends.

605
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,237
Why don't you share a table?

606
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,584
It'd be a lot quicker.

607
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,043
Uh...

608
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,747
- Well, all right.
- Good.

609
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,379
But separate checks.

610
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,430
- Oh.
- You can't be serious?

611
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,513
No other explanation.

612
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,058
The fates are against me. I am jinxed.

613
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:13,563
You know when I was born?

614
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,099
When?

615
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,307
December 7, 1941.

616
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,610
At the naval hospital in Pearl Harbor.

617
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,439
That doesn't prove anything.

618
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,984
I took my training in Miami.

619
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,779
You know how
many hurricanes we had?

620
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,033
Twelve.

621
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,947
Well, that's not unusual for Florida.

622
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,452
In one week?

623
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,583
I mean, we got hit by Adele
through Lisa.

624
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,583
Mona followed me to Kansas.

625
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,538
And what about you?
The first time I met you

626
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,536
I soaked you with a can of paint.

627
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,461
That has nothing to do with fate.

628
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:46,724
- You're just clumsy.
- Oh...

629
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,550
You know what I think your problem is?

630
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,803
What?

631
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,760
I think maybe you just try
a little too hard

632
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,846
to live up to your father's reputation.

633
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,021
Well, maybe I...

634
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,611
Well, enough of my exciting life.

635
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,435
What about you?

636
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,898
- Me?
- Mmm-hmm.

637
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,400
Oh, mine's the same old dull story.

638
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,407
Mother a go-go dancer.
Father a cat burglar.

639
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,738
As you might expect,

640
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,791
the Fairchilds are a staid
old New England family.

641
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,415
Mother still spearheads committees

642
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,590
to keep the picnickers
away from Plymouth Rock.

643
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,748
And my father's always
turning out lights

644
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,378
whenever anybody leaves the room.

645
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,434
And you decided to kick
the establishment?

646
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,759
No, nothing so dramatic.
I just went to school out here.

647
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,965
Decided to stay on.

648
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,676
ENSIGN: Wise decision.

649
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:36,966
I mean, I wouldn't have
wanted to, you know,

650
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,767
go through life without running into you.

651
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,939
If you'll excuse the expression.

652
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,310
It has been fun.

653
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,646
As a matter of fact,

654
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,275
it's really been so pleasant.

655
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,855
Why don't we just forget about
the separate checks?

656
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:52,947
You pay mine.

657
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,277
Oh, I knew you weren't
the type to hold a grudge.

658
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,037
Oh, it's my Yankee blood.

659
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,866
Oh.

660
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,673
What do you think?
It's a Tom Garland first.

661
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:04,129
We, uh, finished dinner.

662
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,464
And I didn't even spill anything on you.

663
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,468
You see, you've broken your jinx.
I told you.

664
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,627
- Well, I'll drink to that.
- All right.

665
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,141
Oh!

666
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,822
So if we run into
a really serious fire at sea,

667
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,109
by running all the pumps,

668
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,912
both self-contained and auxiliary,

669
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:36,078
we can pump as much as
five tons of water per minute.

670
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,828
- Five tons!
- All right, any questions?

671
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,198
Wow! That's a lot of water.

672
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,406
Okay, good.

673
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,036
Now, if you all will step
into the wheelhouse,

674
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,962
I'll show you
some more of the equipment.

675
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,592
I'm very impressed, Mr. Garland.

676
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,460
Well, thank you, Miss Fairchild.

677
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,506
Your knowledge of seamanship
overwhelms me.

678
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,721
Oh, you're too kind.

679
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,591
You are truly a man of the sea.

680
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,007
Well, it's in my blood.

681
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,433
Now, if you will all step over
to the starboard side...

682
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,678
Port.

683
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,265
I better write that on my cuff.

684
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,814
And this is our weather information.

685
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:11,395
We get that from the weather
bureau and from the radio.

686
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,704
And this shows a low pressure
area moving in.

687
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,198
What does that mean, Mr. Garland?

688
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,832
Well, it could mean a number of things.

689
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,367
Low clouds, overcast...

690
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,288
We might even be in for a little fog.

691
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,549
What does that book
say about fog, Harry?

692
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,051
Not much.

693
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,007
But there's a whole chapter
on insubordination.

694
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:38,797
Harry, maybe we ought to stop
here for a while till the fog lifts.

695
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,807
The fog is just what we needed.

00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,099
Perfect cover.

697
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,562
But how do you know
if you're going in the right direction?

698
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,563
You ever heard of dead reckoning?

699
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,228
Have you? Have you?

700
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,822
Is that what you're doing, Harry?

701
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,228
Of course.

702
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,740
All I have to do is keep an even keel

703
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,737
and a steady hand on the tiller.

704
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,744
And this time we wind up
in a Chinese restaurant.

Somebody down here hates me.

760
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,740
Ensign Garland,
you are a menace to boating.

761
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,906
I know that sinking ships
is a tradition in your family,

762
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,658
but it should be theirs not ours.

763
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,203
It may be no excuse, sir,

764
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,076
but they failed to state their position.

765
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:52,371
We lost them in the sea return.

766
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:53,964
You're right. It's no excuse.

767
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,793
And the report does show, sir,
that we were in heavy fog.

768
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,921
It was a beautiful day
when you ran that boat on the rocks.

769
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,417
That's true, sir.

770
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:04,585
I am warning you, Ensign Garland.

771
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:06,675
Father or no father,

772
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,223
if you goof up just one more time,

773
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,643
not only will you lose command
of the <i>Point Maley,</i>

774
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:14,308
but I will write a fitness report
that wouldn't qualify you to...

00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,064
To command a kayak
in the Bering Straits.

776
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,613
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

777
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:30,038
HARRY: Okay, Max.
Stop the boat right here.

778
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,199
Yeah, that's it.

779
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,499
Are you sure that this is
where the picnic basket went down?

780
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,665
Are you kidding?
I'd know that buoy anywhere.

781
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,804
Now look, toss
the grappling hook overboard.

782
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,879
And, you, start fishing.

783
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,467
Now when you hook the basket,
bring it up very carefully

784
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,812
and make sure you don't spill
any of the food.

785
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Harry, does saltwater ruin salami?

786
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,345
Not like white bread and mayonnaise.

00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,243
Ahoy. What's burning?

00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,163
Nothing's burning.

789
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:11,621
Then why did you radio us
that your boat was on fire?

790
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,662
Well, would you want
everyone in Balboa

791
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,166

was locked in the head?

- Harry told me to fish.
- And you keep fishing.

I've prepared myself

871
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,950
- for any emergency.
- Oh...

872
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,621
I've even gotten pretty good
at drilling my own teeth.

873
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,869
Well, good luck, Mr. Mitchell.

874
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,958
Well, hail the conquering hero!

875
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,301
I don't know why everyone's
making such a big deal

876
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,878
over a few simple rescues.

877
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,928
I think it's just plain relief.
You were sinking so many boats

878
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:22,218
nobody knew where you were
going to strike next.

879
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,640
Thank you.

880
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:25,012
You know where Kate is?

881
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,928
At the Dexter slip.

882
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,889
Say... Do you wanna
come with us tomorrow?

883
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,108
We're going on our annual cruise.

884
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,900
You're actually going out in the water?

885
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,903
Renting a motor and everything.

886
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:38,069
- Where are you going?
- Across the bay.

887
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,026
That's the whole cruise?

888
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,947
Buzz Langley is giving a surprise luau

889
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,831
on his yacht for his ex-wife.

890
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,449
The boat's still in her name.

891
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,751
I'll have to pass. Try me next year.

892
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,870
Well, in case you change your mind,

893
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:53,419
what size do you take in a grass skirt?

894
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,499
Kate.

895
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,339
KATE: Hi.

896
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:01,758
Before you say a word,
what I did today was just routine.

897
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,097
Not anything any other
Coast Guard officer

898
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,929
wouldn't do and the rescues
weren't as sensational

899
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,522
as I'm sure everyone has told you.

900
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,556
I heard you were just fair.

901
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:19,989
I just got invited to
Jason's annual cruise.

902
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:22,028
Would you believe it's just
across the bay?

903
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:24,527
Don't laugh, last year it took him
three days to get there.

904
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,826
- Three days?
- And four nights.

905
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,913
Oh, I believe it.

906
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,040
Oh, uh...

907
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,875
Your picture's in the paper.

908
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,882
I wish everyone wouldn't
make such a big deal

909
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,420
out of all these rescues.

910
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,590
ENSIGN: Oh, it's for the fishermen.

911
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,551
Don't you notice anything strange
about that photograph?

912
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,717
Outside of the fact
that it's not my good side,

913
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,056
no.

914
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:50,891
I mean, you don't think it's odd

915
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,885
that you're the only one
anybody can recognize?

916
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:55,016
Every photographer loves a pretty face.

917
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:57,233
Tom, I don't think those men
wanted to have

918
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:58,443
their photographs taken.

919
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,736
With a fish like that, come on, Kate.

920
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:02,994
Well, I think they're phonies.

921
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:06,199
And I think you're being
overly suspicious.

922
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:08,664
Oh...

923
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,620
Well, you may be right.

924
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,084
I suppose it's perfectly natural

925
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:17,669
for three men to catch a
record 565-pound sea bass

926
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,922
and not want to have their
photograph taken.

927
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,694
What are they doing
with the diving suits?

928
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,403
Beats me, sir.

929
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,612
All set, Charlie?

930
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,447
Harry, I don't think this is gonna work.

931
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,031
Of course it's gonna work.

932
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,029
You heard the man at the surplus store.

933
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:52,288
All we have to do is read this pamphlet.

934
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:54,829
Why me, Harry?
I don't know how to dive.

935
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,294
Give me a hand, Max.

936
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,312
All right, head for their boat, Walsh.

937
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:15,975
Ten degrees to starboard.

938
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,650
Make it look casual.

939
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:20,149
Yes, sir.
Ten casual degrees to starboard.

940
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,028
I hope that book is better
than the one you had on sailing.

941
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,532
There was nothing wrong
with that book.

942
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,740
It just didn't include a chapter

943
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,661
on how to avoid being sunk
by your own Coast Guard.

944
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:16,121
MAX: Speaking of the Coast Guard.

945
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,464
HARRY: Start fishing.

946
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,711
Well, for heaven's sakes,
don't catch anything.

947
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,306
Now, they want us to think
they're fishing.

948
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,719
Any sign of the guy in the diving suit?

949
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:40,555
No.

950
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:42,556
Keep heading for them.

951
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:43,725
Casually?

952
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:45,185
Just steer.

953
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:50,914
MAX: Harry, what's that?

954
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,237
HARRY: What's what?

955
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,828
- HARRY: It's a shark.
- A shark!

956
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,450
Will you be quiet?
Any sudden noise and he might attack.

957
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,289
- The boat?
- No. Charlie!

958
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:03,753
He could eat him, the wet suit, snorkel,
the picnic basket, anything.

959
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:05,997
Here take this.

960
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,115
Shark! Man-eater!

961
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,711
Stop thrashing.

962
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,292
The shark will know you're afraid.

963
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,127
He's already found that out.

964
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,586
Shark!

965
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,888
- CHARLIE: Shark!
- Mr. Garland?

966
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,722
There's a man in the water
yelling shark.

967
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:04,019
Wagner, break out the rifle.
Throttle down.

968
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,443
Harry!

969
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,783
Charlie...

970
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,452
Don't panic.

971
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,662
Stay calm.

972
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,493
Charlie, don't worry.

973
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:23,325
It says in the manual
sharks don't like to eat people.

974
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,384
Tell that to Long John Silver.

975
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:28,419
Harry...

976
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,796
That Coast Guard guy's
got a gun in his hand.

977
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:35,681
Charlie's got a better
chance against the shark.

978
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:39,098
Hold your fire.

979
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,970
He's just a kid.

980
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,595
(GUN SHOTS)

981
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:50,066
Harry, he got him.

982
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:52,609
Poor Charlie. What a way to go.

983
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:56,906
Charlie, you're all right!

984
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:06,581
Charlie, Charlie, I'm so glad to see ya!

985
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,456
I think I got the bends.

986
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:11,093
Just don't depend on me
for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

987
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,590
Max, come on.

988
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:17,973
CHARLIE: <i>No, no, no!</i>

989
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:19,551
Max, my mind is made up.

990
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,889
I wouldn't go into water
again, even in a submarine!

991
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,433
What do you want to do? You wanna
leave two million bucks down there

992
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:25,887
for the sand dabs and the halibut?

993
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:27,435
Oh, and don't forget the sharks.

994
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,900
Charlie, with your share of the loot
you can spend the rest of your life

995
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,151
- walking down easy street.
- With a wooden leg.

996
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:34,404
Charlie, take my personal word for it...

997
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,895
Quiet, quiet!

998
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:37,574
Hello, is this long distance, operator?

999
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,527
Long distance? To where?

1000
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,198
I'd like to place a call
to Tokyo, operator.

1001
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:44,582
To... Tokyo?

1002
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:48,416
That's right. Yes.
It's person to person for Mr...

1003
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,666
Masomori Tanohara.

1004
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,298
The number is Fujiyama 325...

1005
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,420
Five. 2571.

1006
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,465
Right.

1007
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,390
Now, if there's no answer,

1008
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,560
try Kamikaze 62914.

1009
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:04,888
Yes.

1010
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,438
Okay, I'll wait.

1011
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,770
Harry, I'd like to ask you
a personal question.

1012
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,266
Why are you calling Tokyo?

1013
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,110
- Why am I calling Tokyo?
- Why are you calling Tokyo?

1014
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,572
I'm calling...

1015
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,240
Hello? Hello, Masomori!

1016
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:20,815
It's Harry Simmons.

1017
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:23,237
Yes, yes! Oh, fine.

1018
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:25,788
Still raising Cain
in Cherry Blossom Lane,

1019
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,288
you sly old samurai, you?

1020
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,920
Harry, why are you calling him?

1021
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,580
How's your wife?

1022
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,292
Sorry about that.

1023
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:34,545
How's your geisha? Good!

1024
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:36,009
Well, you win some, you lose some.

1025
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,508
Harry, why?

1026
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:40,301
Look, Masomori, baby, I need a favor.

1027
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,760
Well, I... No, no, no camera.

1028
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,143
What? Forget the motorbike.

1029
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,641
What I... I've got watches!

1030
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,943
Now listen.

1031
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:51,806
What I'm really in the market for is...

1032
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:55,194
Do you know a good pearl diver?

1033
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,202
(BRASS BAND PLAYING)

1034
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:17,964
That's a girl.

1035
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,585
But the best thing to do
is get down there and shoot.

1036
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:22,045
All right, let's hustle up,
fellas, come on.

1037
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,394
Okay.

1038
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,759
All right, right about here.
This will be swell.

1039
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,095
Just a head shot.

1040
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,350
Not too much of the zoom.
Zoom in and out. Okay?

1041
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,232
Good luck, Mr. Mitchell.

1042
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,849
Thank you, Mr. Garland. Thank you.

1043
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,516
Excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me.
Get the kids out of the way, will ya?

1044
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,015
All right, you set now?

1045
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:38,727
A two shot, okay? All right?
All right, speed.

1046
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:39,898
Good. Mr. Mitchell?

1047
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:41,146
Uh, yeah.

1048
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,065
Uh, Mr. Mitchell, I'm not
gonna keep you too long

1049
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,735
because I know that you're anxious
to get on your trip around the world.

1050
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:46,905
That's right.

1051
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,794
I know our viewers
are anxious to find out

1052
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,619
how your family feels about this.

1053
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:53,205
Well, why don't you ask them?
They're right there.

1054
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,577
Oh. Move it. Move it back, boys.

1055
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:57,798
Okay, let's clear it up. Right.

1056
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,758
Good? Okay, fine. All right.

1057
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,549
Oh, are these all the Mitchell kids?

1058
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,224
This is the whole Mitchell family.

1059
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,554
Okay, Mrs. Mitchell?

1060
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:08,556
Mrs. Mitchell, how do you feel
about an epic voyage

1061
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:11,387
that will keep your husband
away from home for three years?

1062
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,435
I certainly hope so.

1063
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:18,566
Hi.

1064
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,526
What did you find out?

1065
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:21,778
They said it would take days

1066
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:23,401
to check all the eastern yacht clubs

1067
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,407
for a Commodore Simmons.

1068
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,659
Oh...

1069
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,453
What do you think they're up to, Tom?

1070
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:32,197
I don't know. But you're right.
They're up to something.

1071
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,379
Uh, maybe they're smugglers.
Or even spies.

1072
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,713
If they are, we just won the Cold War.

1073
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,550
Did Simmons tell you
where they're staying?

1074
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,510
Yeah, I think it's
the Yankee Clipper Motel. What?

1075
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,553
I'll go over there
and see what I can find out.

1076
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,425
- Tom?
- Yeah?

1077
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:51,682
Well, what if they
come for the boat again?

1078
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,351
I don't know. Stall them till I get back.

1079
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:55,685
All right.

(BABIES CRYING)

1086
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:58,644
I don't see any guy
that looks like a Japanese pearl diver.

1087
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,846
What did you expect, him to get off
the plane in a bathing suit?

1088
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:02,555
Maybe he missed connections in LA.

1089
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,106
Yeah, I better call
the airport in Los Angeles

1090
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,070
and see if there's a Miss...

1091
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:07,987
Hold the phone.

1092
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,333

Hey, it's for me.

honorable Masomori Tanohara."

1101
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,111
Yeah, okay.

1102
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,664
"I am very honored to make
your honorable acquaintance."

1103
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:57,121
Me, honorable Harry Simmons.

1104
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,325
What a beautiful chick.

1105
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,373
Too bad they couldn't send somebody
who could speak English.

1106
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:05,174
In our line of work,
it's always good to do business

1107
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:06,421
with someone who can't talk.

1108
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,424
Come on.
You come, come, come, come.

1109
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,378
You come. He Max.

1110
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:12,675
- I'm Charlie.
- Yeah.

1111
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,758
I'll tell her. Charlie, Max, Harry.

1112

(QUIET CHATTER)

1113
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,690
I beg your pardon. Could you...

1114
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,686
Mr. Garland, what are you doing here?

1115
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,822
Oh, I was just going
into the coffee shop.

1116
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,072
Great little place to eat.

1117
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,281
Oh, yeah. I was just registering.

1118
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:39,699
Of course, sir.

1119
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,789
Mrs. Taylor and I are registering.

1120
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,915
We're having our apartment painted.

1121
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:51,341
We're just gonna be here until...

1122
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,835
Why am I explaining all of this to you?

1123
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:56,675
Uh, we'll be checking in about 6:00 p.m.

1124
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,100
Your room will be ready, Commander.

1125
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,058
- Room 52.
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

1126
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:07,515
- Uh, coffee shop's through that door.
- Oh, thank you.

1127
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,355
Say, you do have a
Commodore Simmons registered here?

1128
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,783
Room 706.

1129
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:17,071
I was just wondering if that was
the same Commodore Simmons

1130
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:19,026
that I knew in, uh, Charleston.

1131
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,701
No, this gentleman came from Kansas.

1132
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:22,874
Leavenworth, I believe.

1133
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,083
Oh, yes, yes.

1134
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:26,543
He told me that's his winter home.

1135
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:30,036
- When did he arrive?
- Last Tuesday.

1136
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,840
It checks out.

1137
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,715
Come. We, we live here.

1138
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:45,391
Live here.

1139

Well, if it isn't Mr. Coast Guard.

1140
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:52,568
You're a little late if you wanted
to sink our car. We just parked it.

1141
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,361
Nice to see you again, sir.

1142
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:57,029
This is my cousin Shirley
from Pittsburgh.

01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:58,201

I come. Oh, what I got.

1159
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:50,792
I got a basket. Picnic.

Boy, is she taking off her robe.

why they sent for a Japanese girl.

it's not the picnic basket.

She's been down there a long time.

1200

01:05:56,912 --> 01:05:59,792
Listen, I need to see what's really
in that basket.

1221
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,293
Now, just pull the car over
there into the shadows.

1222
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,507
- A-ha, a-ha!
- A-ha, what?

1223
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,345
I just found
the Japanese word for "bonus."

1224
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,807
- "Bonus?"
- Yeah.

1225
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:20,984
- I think we ought to give Chiyoko one.
- CHARLIE: She deserves it.

MAX: How much you figure, Harry?

1227
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:25,726
Well, if I give her 100 bucks,
she'll be bound to Buddha for a year.

1228
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,606
- I think that's fair.
- Chiyoko!

Operator, may I talk to the police?

1263
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:30,502
Never in my wildest dreams
could I believe that one of my own men

1264
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,044
would become a Peeping Tom.

1265
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:33,754
Especially one named Tom.

1266
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:36,724
Sir, there is a
very reasonable explanation to this.

1267
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,966
Of course there is. And I'm sure
the base psychiatrist will find it.

1268

Sir, you can't really believe
that I was trying to peek at your wife.

No, not that she isn't very attractive.

Commodore Simmons' room, not hers.

Oh, you are sicker than I thought.

1272
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:55,192
I was trying to look
into his picnic basket.

His picnic basket?

1274
01:09:58,111 --> 01:09:59,861
Sir, that's where the stolen jewels are.

1275

Commodore Simmons is a jewel thief?

1276
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:06,541
I would stake my entire reputation on it.

1277
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:10,872
Let me put it another way.

1278
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,545
I'm getting nervous.
We gotta get out of here.

Oh, but I'm sorry,
you call at a very bad time.

01:37:55,579 --> 01:37:56,789
- Harry.
- Harry!

1732
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,129
Forget it, Harry.

1733
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:06,259
- Those are the breaks.
- The breaks.

1734
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:10,257
(SIGH)

1735
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:12,971
Well...

1736
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:15,181
Maybe the movie will be good.

1737
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,911
You have done it, Garland.

1738
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,243
You've come through.

1739
01:38:36,328 --> 01:38:38,868
You're "Torpedo" Tommy's son, all right.

1740
01:38:38,955 --> 01:38:41,165
- Thank you, sir.
- We'd better get on the radio

1741
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,377
and have headquarters
alert the Mexican authorities.

1742
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:45,417
Let's take all this, Garlotti,

1743
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:48,505
and make an accurate list
for the authorities.

1744
01:38:49,716 --> 01:38:51,126
Tom, look.

1745
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:56,349
I think we'd better put that in
with the rest of the inventory.

1746
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:58,306
Isn't it beautiful?

1747
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:01,232
Would make a wonderful
engagement ring, wouldn't it?

1748
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:03,559
Perfect.

1749
01:39:03,897 --> 01:39:05,187
Oh, well.

1750
01:39:08,318 --> 01:39:11,908
You know something,
I can't seem to get it off my finger.

1751
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:14,032
Funny.

1752
01:39:17,202 --> 01:39:20,082
Well, I, I guess
you'll just have to keep it.

1753
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:28,211
But turn in the pickle.

1754
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:39,468
I don't know how I'm gonna
break the news to my pelican.

1755
01:39:40,058 --> 01:39:41,638
That's his problem.

1756
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,730
I don't wanna lose the girl
who helped me break my jinx.
