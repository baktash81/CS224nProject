Clumsy brute, look what you've done.

82
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:40,952
13, 12, 11, 10, 9.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,115

7,6,5,4.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,115

88
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,285

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,331
Thank you.

90
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,413
Oh gee Mr. drummond.

What is it?

93
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,035
Well pretty strong.

94
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:28,042
It's a bull shot.

95
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,417
Gosh!

96
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,333
Tastes like beef soup.

97
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,664
It is beef soup!

98
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,202
Is it?

99
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,448
Well a little of it is.

100
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,868
The rest's vodka.

101
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:53,873
Hello darling.

102
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,535
Wasn't it lovely?

103
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,167
Wow!

104
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,618
Did you do that Mr. drummond?

105
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,990
Do what?

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,830
The eye.

107
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,822
Good heavens no.

108
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,733
Don't do things like that to girls.

109
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,660
I bet they're both spies.

110
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,907
Well as a matter of fact
you're completely right.

111
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:26,077
You see the one, the one with the glasses.

112
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,083
She's Hungarian.

113
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,285
The eyes are disguised of course.

114
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,122
Ah yes!

115
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,660
Damn clever these Hungarians.

116
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,952
Wow!

117
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,993
Actually she's working for us now.

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,580
Because she's madly in love with you?

119
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,368
Well what do you think?

120
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,285
What does it feel like
to be a hero Mr. drummond?

121
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,292
Careful.

122
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:45,872
What?

123
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,875
That's my bad knee.

124
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:48,788
Oh.

125
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,498
No really Mr. drummond.

126
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,535
You are a hero.

127
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,407
why you caught that man that
killed the secretary of state

128
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,827
and then you went and
kidnapped all those tanks,

129
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,413
And then you caught that other man...

130
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,417
Ssh.

131
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,532
More Hungarians.

132
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,873
Oh, oh I'm sorry Mr. drummond.

133
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:20,708
But gee, if ever you need
a girl Friday I'll do it.

134
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,202
Well now's your chance.

135
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:29,198
Me?

136
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,330
Mr. drummond's holiday office speaking.

137
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,368
Mr. drummond's secretary.

138
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,122
Oh.

139
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,456
Oh I'm sorry.

140
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,823
It's your secretary.

141
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,539
Hello miss crumb.

142
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,157
Miss crumb!

143
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,167
What?

144
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,875
The sst1?

145
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,750
When?

146
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,743
Right, I'll be there as soon as possible.

147
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,160
You have to go home?

148
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,998
When you gotta go you gotta go.

149
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,125
Oh!

150
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,123
Mr. drummond?

151
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,456
Do I look like Mr. drummond?

152
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,538
Where is he?

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,490
Who are you?

154
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,740
I'm his daily, who are you.

155
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,160
Miss Mary.

156
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,202
You?

157
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,868
I'm a cookery school.

158
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:52,792
Oh.

159
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,493
Have you got a light?

160
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,620
I don't approve of smoking,
it ruins the taste buds.

161
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,035
Where is Mr. drummond?

162
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,157
Is it important?

163
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,952
Yes it is.

164
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,387
You have to stand
still for it to go away.

165
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,157
You can tell me if you like.

166
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,032
I'm his confidential daily.

167
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,952
When are you expecting him back?

168
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,414
I'm not, he's gone on holiday.

169
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,532
Why didn't you say
so, when did he leave?

170
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,702
Two days ago.

171
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,914
He went for a fortnight.

172
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,198
Changed his mind though,
he's coming back today.

173
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,493
Oh.

174
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,600
In that case I'll just leave him a note.

175
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,368
will you be sure to see that he gets this

176
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,740
as soon as he gets back?

177
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,750
Thank you.

178
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,490
It's your greatest
aeroplane ever Mr. Mortimer.

179
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,535
In fact I think it's
the greatest ever built.

180
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,532
We know the prime minister
wants you to have a knighthood.

181
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,122
Oh congratulations!

182
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,705
yes but unfortunately I'm
afraid it isn't possible,

183
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,493
Not yet, the home office.

184
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,331
Well what have they to
do with aircraft designs?

185
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,618
Itisn't that it's, they
say you're breaking the law.

186
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,081
Well indeed, do they.

187
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,198
well I can assure you sir that
I have never broken the law

188
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,698
to my knowledge.

189
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,539
Well you're classified old
chap, and so is your briefcase.

190
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,248
Official secrets act.

191
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,660
Well I've always been of the opinion

192
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,032
that my secrets are safer in the custody

193
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:31,622
Of someone who knows and
understands them, me.

194
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,240
ah but if somebody kidnaps you

195
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,910
And your notes are with you...

196
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:38,282
Now look here sir Dudley,
I mean Mr. Mortimer.

197
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,281
With that briefcase under your arm

198
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,623
You're in danger with every step you take.

199
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,035
Now look old chap we haven't told you

200
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,327
But there's been a couple
of accidents recently.

201
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,868
We were getting worried about
anything happening to you.

202
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,535
so we've been trying to insure you

203
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,498
For five million pounds.

204
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,706
only we can't get anyone
willing to accept the risk,

205
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,243
Not while you walk around
with that briefcase.

206
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,706
Five million?

207
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,088
Well you're worth it,
we couldn't replace you.

208
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,232
I was thinking it's not very much.

209
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,452
Well all right.

210
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,288
Good day gentlemen.

211
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:10,292
Oh sorry.

212
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:15,577
Now this must be locked away
sir, that's very important.

213
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,583
What about that?

214
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,910
It's welded sir, for safety.

215
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:20,917
Good day gentlemen.

216
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:26,297
He's right you know, he
is worth more than that.

217
00:13:58,292 --> 00:13:59,292
Pandora!

218
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,282
Sir Dudley Mortimer.

219
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,202
Lord Mortimer.

220
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,289
Is something wrong?

221
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,282
Did you have a breakdown?

222
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:49,952
Did you have a puncture?

223
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,448
Maybe he ran out of water.

224
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,743
Oh yes.

225
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,830
My dear young lady,

226
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,573
Even I know that water
does not drive a car.

227
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,823
Oh look!

228
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,956
Here.

229
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:02,788
Look.

230
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,407
Oh petroleum.

231
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,327
Oh poor little man, what will you do.

232
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,164
Oh don't worry we'll tow you, won't we.

233
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,077
- I don't want a tow!
- Get the rope pandora.

234
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,618
- I will not be towed!
- It's all right.

235
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,456
No I'm gonna push.

236
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,322
I'm gonna push.

237
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,323
Take the handbrake off will you.

238
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,039
Put that rope away.

239
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,952
Put it away I say.

240
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:20,788
No stop, stop.

241
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,592
I'm perfectly capable
of managing this myself.

242
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,698
In you go little man.

243
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,243
We take care of you.

244
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,288
Stop, stop!

245
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:35,327
Stop how dare you!

246
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,163
Stop it, stop!

247
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,847
I'll have the law on you two young ladies!

248
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,206
Stop, how dare you!

249
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,208
Stop I say!

250
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,333
Stop!

251
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:03,292
Bye bye!

252
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,202
Drive carefully Mr. Mortimer.

253
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,667
Pull

254
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,042
damn!

255
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,785
Well Hugh, what do you make of it.

256
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,702
Well it ought to be
too late for sabotage.

257
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,323
the prototype's been built, it flies

258
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,868
And the contract's been signed.

259
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:46,875
Pull!

260
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,202
Good shot.

261
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,743
but they can still cancel the contract

262
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,206
until the end of next month.

263
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,208
Pull

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,365
that's funny.

265
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,990
Somebody's shooting my clays.

266
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,206
Yes old chap, you are.

267
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,410
You know if this news gets about.

268
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,907
Hey you shooting at my birds?

269
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,873
No, aren't you?

270
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:09,792
Pull.

271
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,452
great Scott, I think that's
the most amazing bit of

272
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,289
Trick shooting I've ever seen.

273
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,327
Hello there please.

274
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,073
It is baroness Helga is it not.

275
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,331
look Hugh, if this contract's cancelled

276
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,413
the country stands to lose

277
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:29,407
A thousand million pounds in exports.

278
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,123
You've got to do something about it.

279
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,410
I'll do my best.

280
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,827
- Ah my dear thorensen.
- Lord dunburry.

281
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,993
May I present major Newman,
major Newman lord dunburry.

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,989
And?

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,910
Oh Hugh drummond, I thought you'd met.

284
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,577
The Hugh drummond?

285
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,413
Well.

286
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:44,748
We should have met sooner.

287
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,535
On business, but this is much nicer.

288
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:48,531
Business?

289
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:51,282
You insure some of my aeroplanes.

290
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,452
One of them has just crashed.

291
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:59,747
I think you
owe me an apology madam.

292
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,206
But your friend had missed.

293
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,118
I hoped to save you the shame.

294
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,410
Oh my dear girl.

295
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,327
Mr. drummond's a better
shot even than you.

296
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,322
I'm the duffer.

297
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,033
Better shot than me I doubt.

298
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,493
But we could see.

299
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,490
You will come and visit
me soon Mr. drummond.

300
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,285
Thorensen experimental aerodynamics.

301
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:20,827
Dunburry will tell you.

302
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,573
Right, I'll be down tomorrow.

303
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:28,947
Thorensen?

304
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,664
Oh they're gliders, sail planes.

305
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,532
They've done some research for us.

306
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:33,497
They're a good firm, not very big.

307
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,330
Something crashed?

308
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,573
Oh just one of his gliders.

309
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,483
not very important, not one of his,

310
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:40,947
Well I'll see you there perhaps.

311
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,750
Bye.

312
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,285
You are a good shot.

313
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,247
I'm also a good cook.

314
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,740
That is our dinner.

315
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,035
Fresh?

316
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:59,282
Pheasants are supposed to
be hung for a week you know.

317
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:02,157
I'm a very good cook.

318
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,027
You'll never know they were fresh.

319
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,289
Well, why?

320
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,292
Why what?

321
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,258
Why sit halfway up a
tree, middle of surrey,

322
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,414
shooting at my Clay pigeons,

323
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:39,498
In order to come back here
and go to bed with me.

324
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,160
I wanted to see how
good a shot you were.

325
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,657
And?

326
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,157
Better than most men.

327
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,095
And what's the end
product supposed to be?

328
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,952
Must there be one.

329
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,285
well shooting often ends up

330
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,732
In somebody getting killed you know.

331
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,323
Would you mind?

332
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,875
Packing?

333
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,333
All right.

334
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,167
Thank you.

335
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,073
Hello.

336
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,125
Flicky?

337
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,164
You forget your ski.

338
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,042
Flicky.

339
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,958
Flicky. - Wow!

340
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:45,085
I bet they're a pushover
once you get 'em up here.

341
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:46,657
Now flicky listen to me.

342
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,448
I don't want to seem inhospitable but...

343
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,243
Well don't I even get a drink?

344
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,081
Champagne or beef soup.

345
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,493
A bull shot.

346
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,330
Over there.

347
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,333
I'll make one.

348
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,750
Eh flicky, how long were
you thinking of staying.

349
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,782
In London that is.

350
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,827
Until my aunt's better.

351
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,198
Your aunt?

352
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,038
Yes.

353
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,998
She broke her leg.

354
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,035
Isn't that marvellous!

355
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,285
well you see there's no
one to take care of her

356
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:21,998
Except for me.

357
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,865
That's why I'm here.

358
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:28,865
but she won't need me all the time so

359
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,492
I can be free to help you too.

360
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,417
Yes.

361
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:37,917
Who's Angela?

362
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,202
My daily.

363
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,208
Oh.

364
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:44,248
Well she left a note for you.

365
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,535
It says Mr. drummond.

366
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:47,372
Ssh.

367
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,375
Telephone.

368
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,539
Oh.

369
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:54,952
You have company.

370
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,706
Why didn't you say something?

371
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,868
Oh flicky.

372
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,660
Ah, the bedroom.

373
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:04,667
My bed.

374
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,831
She's off the phone now.

375
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:46,417
Gosh.

376
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,539
She was in a hurry.

377
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,698
What do we do now?

378
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,667
Flicky.

379
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,831
That's a silly question isn't it.

380
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:04,175
I mean first thing we
do is take your coat off

381
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,032
And then we draw a bath, and...

382
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:08,782
- Mr. drummond I, I...
- What do you like

383
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:11,032
For breakfast in the morning?

384
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,702
My, my aunt she may
be waiting up for me.

385
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,928
I think I better call her.
Flicky, flicky.

386
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,785
For a femme fatale you make
a damn good ski instructor.

387
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:23,612
Your aunt doesn't exist does she.

388
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:28,952
Mayfair 8860 then.

389
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,323
What's that?

390
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,413
Claridge's.

391
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:55,352
Claridge's hotel, good evening.

392
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,375
Hey.

393
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:03,407
Put your finger on there,
don't let go till I tell you.

394
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,875
Ah.

395
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,823
What is it?

396
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,039
A plastic explosive.

397
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:19,998
enough to blow the whole
place to smithereens

398
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,615
And you and me with it.

399
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:26,123
It's all right, it's quite
safe, you can let go now.

400
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:31,337
You see she replaced the
telephone mic with that.

401
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,160
One word in here and poof.

402
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:45,708
After you.

403
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,573
Hello, hello Mr. drummond.

404
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,583
Bang!

405
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,414
One, two, three, crack.

406
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:01,452
Well done major Newman, right in the bowl.

407
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,664
So sorry dear lady.

408
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,747
Relax the egg, wing
commander, relax the egg.

409
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,990
Now then come along, all together then.

410
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,948
One, two, three, relax, crack.

411
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:16,958
That's it.

412
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:22,788
Oh dear, we'll have to do
better than that Mr. thorensen.

413
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:24,952
I will try miss Mary.

414
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,495
Little egg behind the ear.

415
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,740
Thank you dear lady.

416
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,750
Sir!

417
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:42,373
Why don't you watch major
Newman, he does it so well.

418
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,035
Show him major Newman.

419
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:48,282
There, now you try.

420
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,035
Oh dear, time to stop.

421
00:25:57,042 --> 00:26:00,222
Never mind, tomorrow we'll start whipping.

422
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:06,452
whipping our golden sweet
nature nurtured eggs

423
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,743
Into a lovely creamy froth.

424
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,115
I can't wait!

425
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:13,115
but for the moment back
to our responsibilities

426
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,035
And don't forget my aprons.

427
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:19,623
you will do your homework
won't you Mr. thorensen

428
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,705
well done major.

429
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,664
A special diploma for you my boy.

430
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,948
Thank you.

431
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:28,073
11 o'clock tomorrow then.

432
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,618
Goodnight.

433
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,625
Bless you bishop.

434
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,164
Kills the taste buds.

435
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,702
A merciful death.

436
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,823
Hello dear little man.

437
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:42,958
Miss Mary?

438
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:46,875
Miss Mary?

439
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,240
All right you can come out now.

440
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,115
What the hell are you doing here?

441
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,845
Well the note your
cleaning lady left you.

442
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:05,282
So you decided to play
private eye did you?

443
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,312
But I just got here as you drove up.

444
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,470
Well let's see if
she's upstairs shall we.

445
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,948
Hey, why a cookery school?

446
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,868
well firstly 500 guineas a course,

447
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,115
secondly it's a good front

448
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,240
and it provides the sort of clients

449
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,081
That it pays to inform on.

450
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,990
Ooh.

451
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,580
Who's been after what?

452
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:38,198
Yes and I don't know.

453
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,664
the only thing likely to
interest a thief around here

454
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,032
would be nasty gossip.

455
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:48,887
Maybe, maybe they're
after his diary then.

456
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:51,702
maybe you're right

457
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:56,888
But I don't think miss
Mary's that obvious.

458
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:03,633
All the same, you could
be on the right track.

459
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,567
Well what do you make of this, hmm.

460
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:12,792
Look here.

461
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:18,098
Wing commander Aston's Christmas party.

462
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:20,914
Strip poker before...

463
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:24,327
Yeah I don't think that's
very suitable for you.

464
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,333
And the boat.

465
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:29,823
Doesn't mean anything to me.

466
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,743
Doesn't say anything
about my baroness either.

467
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,830
Or the sst1.

468
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:35,913
That's what you mean.

469
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:38,945
Clever little thing aren't you.

470
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,414
Shut up!

471
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:21,577
That's miss Mary.

472
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,077
Yeah still warm.

473
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,095
His friends must've
been here very recently.

474
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,497
What do you make of that?

475
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:46,448
H d Tor gl dang.

476
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:48,542
What?

477
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:52,535
I think it's a warning
of some kind flicky.

478
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:55,782
That gliding's a bit dangerous.

479
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,539
Thank you.

480
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:05,248
You have looked through the
parachute yourself my dear.

481
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,160
Mr. drummond is far too valuable to lose.

482
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,452
Oh yes sir.

483
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,243
I packed it myself.

484
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:17,248
You say it broke up in
the air Mr. thorensen.

485
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,785
My experts tell me so.

486
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:22,327
Though somebody had beaten it
with a club as it was flying.

487
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:26,253
One would need a very big
club to smash that, eh.

488
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,640
Well we shall have to see what happens.

489
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,247
Good luck Mr. drummond.

490
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,618
Release at 4000 feet sir.

491
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:04,625
All right.

492
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:01,073
You are out of sight now darling.

493
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,083
Thank you!

494
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,077
He's releasing now.

495
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,195
Drummond sail plane to control.

496
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:53,702
Drummond sail plane to tower.

497
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,407
Hello drummond sail
plane, come in please.

498
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:06,417
He's broken off.

499
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,164
There he goes!

500
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,577
Oh poor lamb.

501
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,368
do you know, I think
someone cut the rip cord

502
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,490
of his parachute.

503
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,487
He's trying to open it by hand.

504
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:44,782
How much longer?

505
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:45,792
Oh seconds.

506
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:23,623
Hugh drummond, you have the
worst stiff neck I ever see.

507
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,325
Yeah you can say that again.

508
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,456
You can do that again.

509
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:34,827
Tell me what did you
find out about thorensen?

510
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,039
Thorensen?

511
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:39,862
He's come to the sauna, I give
him a massage, he goes home.

512
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:42,732
Sometimes I don't see him for weeks.

513
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:46,748
And when he's not in england
he's in north Africa.

514
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,750
North Africa?

515
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,948
Didn't mention a man
called barouche did he?

516
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:58,414
Barouche, barouche,
he talks about barouche.

517
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,997
He meets him too in north Africa.

518
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,160
And something about a boat.

519
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,077
Osprey 111?

520
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,414
Yes that's it.

521
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:07,907
A very fast boat he said.

522
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:12,588
He mentioned somebody
else called Carl petersen.

523
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Petersen?

524
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,833
Is that any help??

525
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:22,407
Birgit.

526
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:25,702
I absolutely adore you.

527
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,708
- You do?
- Mm hmm.

528
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:38,407
And now I've got to rush off.

529
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,081
You sure you love me so?

530
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,870
Well I can't prove it in
front of the natives can I.

531
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,232
You're next major Newman.

532
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:18,833
Hello.

533
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,198
Tell him I'll be down in a minute.

534
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:26,498
Yes?

535
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,375
Boo!

536
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:40,292
Boo.

537
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,664
It's me!

538
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,907
I know it's you.

539
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:50,032
How do you know it's me?

540
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,157
You didn't even look.

541
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:56,032
How do you like my dress?

542
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,452
Just the thing for
following me around in.

543
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,458
Mm, I thought so.

544
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,164
Where we dining?

545
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,907
We aren't dining anywhere.

546
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,782
I've made other arrangements.

547
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:09,792
Aw shucks.

548
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:15,323
You must admit it was a good idea though.

549
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,993
I was even on the same plane with you

550
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,240
and you didn't spot me.

551
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,740
Well how could I?

552
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,240
You've got a black wig
and dark glasses on.

553
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,785
Now if you'll excuse me
I've got to rush off.

554
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:26,792
Help yourself.

555
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:30,827
Flicky.

556
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,413
Yes?

557
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:35,157
You know everybody's
got a home somewhere.

558
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,657
Why don't you go to yours, mm?

559
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,032
There's a good girl.

560
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:41,407
I can't, it's too far away.

561
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,532
Flicky.

562
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,032
I'm hungry.

563
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:47,868
Well try the hotel
restaurant, excellent.

564
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,455
I want to go out.

565
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,285
Go to the kasbah.

566
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:53,452
With you?

567
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:57,664
there's a restaurant there
where the sheep's eyes are

568
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,867
A richly rewarding experience.

569
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,414
Sheep's eyes?

570
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,417
Yuck.

571
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,250
Ah Mr. drummond.

572
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,577
How do you do.

573
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,368
You from the British embassy?

574
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,660
oh yes I hope I won't shock you old chap

575
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,498
But you'll find me a bit
of a fallout you know.

576
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,535
This way please.

577
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:17,657
I think you mean dropout.

578
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,531
Do I?

579
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,782
Oh yes, so I do.

580
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,952
my name's carruthers by the
way, peregrine carruthers,

581
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,118
but you can call me butch.

582
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:23,955
That yours?

583
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,868
Yes, super isn't she.

584
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,081
Positively psychedelic.

585
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,698
Oh I hope you're safe.

586
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,388
That's what mother keeps worrying about.

587
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,865
Who cares Mr. drummond, get with it.

588
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:34,990
Live dangerously.

589
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:42,618
What does his excellency
think about your swinging image?

590
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,831
I don't know, he doesn't say.

591
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:45,868
Wonder why not.

592
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:46,990
He's mummy's brother.

593
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,448
Here's your invitation.

594
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,823
Lord dunburry laid it on.

595
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,573
It's a pre-race party.

596
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,993
Pre-race, what for?

597
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,830
Powerboats.

598
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,289
International gold cup tomorrow.

599
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:12,782
Who's lady manderley?

600
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:15,032
Oh ex patriot society type.

601
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,657
Always in the cheap press.

602
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,907
Yachts, the riviera, money to burn.

603
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:21,657
Last time it was a harem party.

604
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:22,497
Great fun.

605
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,115
Come as your favourite eunuch.

606
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:27,745
I'm glad it was last time,
I feel a bit overdressed.

607
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,118
Barouche be there?

608
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:30,831
Oh I can't say old chap.

609
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,948
Where do you fit in?

610
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:32,788
Me?

611
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:35,498
Oh I've been assigned as your bodyguard.

612
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,115
Good grief.

613
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,240
Look out!

614
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:52,053
When will they learn
to drive on the left?

615
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:53,958
Madge!

616
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:55,997
Glad you could make it.

617
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Lovely sweet.

618
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:01,490
Darling, darling get me a drink will you.

619
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,285
Isn't he sweet.

620
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:04,498
Cecil.

621
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,327
Who's the contact butch?

622
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:19,033
No idea old chap, I presume
they'll reveal themselves.

623
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,622
By the look of some of these
dresses it won't be long now.

624
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,240
Yes I see what you mean.

625
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,790
Oh well I'll be around
if you need any protection.

626
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,782
Thank you butch.

627
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:37,739
Mr. drummond?

628
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,750
Yes.

629
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:46,782
Reggie!

630
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:48,748
This is divine.

631
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,330
You always make a party go so.

632
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:54,077
Mr. drummond.

633
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,823
Oh yes, of course.

634
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:58,118
Reggie come here at once!

635
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:08,875
Cool baby!

636
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,490
Good evening Mr. drummond.

637
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,990
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

638
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,580
Forgive the uproar out there.

639
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,698
My parties suit my purpose.

640
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:32,393
People think I'm a fool and
they talk and talk and talk.

641
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:34,873
Now Mr. barouche.

642
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,455
dunburry put an urgent on it

643
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,298
And I'm afraid we haven't
been able to do much.

644
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,375
Very nice.

645
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,785
Mysterious person barouche.

646
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,956
But you'll see for yourself.

647
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,898
He's definitely coming here tonight.

648
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:56,455
Who's kruger?

649
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,750
Built this boat.

650
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:01,993
Osprey lll.

651
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,830
Mm hmm.

652
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,913
He's expected to win
the gold cup tomorrow.

653
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:06,623
What's his connection with barouche?

654
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:08,240
We're not sure.

655
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,910
except at one of my parties

656
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:13,577
kruger boasted he could take
barouche for half a million

657
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:14,789
if he wanted to.

658
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:17,623
Something about barouche
buying the osprey.

659
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,205
Half a million.

660
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:21,573
That's an awful lot of money for a boat.

661
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,368
Could he have been buying
anything else as well?

662
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:24,785
Possibly.

663
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:27,032
you see kruger's father was a scientist

664
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,748
Doing advanced work on infrasound.

665
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,410
He died last year.

666
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:33,373
Police think it was murder.

667
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,740
There was no proof.

668
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,830
Infrasound.

669
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,032
What's that?

670
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,157
Subsonic vibrations.

671
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,123
You can't hear it but it's there.

672
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:44,660
It can destroy life very quickly.

673
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,282
kruger's father was trying to find out

674
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:48,498
How to control and direct it.

675
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,365
What's thorensen got
to do with all of this?

676
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,331
We've drawn a blank there.

677
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:58,653
Oh except that thorensen often
flies down to meet barouche.

678
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,250
Yes?

679
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,083
Thank you.

680
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,872
Barouche has just arrived.

681
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,993
Darling you look gorgeous!

682
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,990
Angel fetch me a drink.

683
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,980
My own party and I'm dying of thirst.

684
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,250
Over there.

685
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:36,914
Darling man, I'm honoured.

686
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:38,623
My sheikh of the desert.

687
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,240
So exciting!

688
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,250
So mysterious!

689
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:45,157
Oh you must meet Mr. drummond.

690
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:48,657
He's just popped down
from London for the race.

691
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:50,202
Ah drummond.

692
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:53,664
Your reputation proceeds you.

693
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,623
Insurance isn't it?

694
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:56,625
That's correct.

695
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:02,365
We must have a lot of
things in common Mr. drummond.

696
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:04,785
Love for the subdued for example.

697
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:07,368
Lady manderley's parties...

698
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,865
Good evening Mr. drummond.

699
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,706
Surprise surprise.

700
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,657
Your aim's gone to pot baroness.

701
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:24,782
My aim is perfect.

702
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:26,157
Dead centre.

703
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:28,373
Just that you drilled the wrong heart.

704
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,365
Oh don't be so egocentric darling.

705
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,955
You're not the only interest I have.

706
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,914
Oh you mustn't say things like that.

707
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,123
You'll make me jealous.

708
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:40,118
That's a grunig Mark six.

709
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:41,865
Special Swedish target pistol.

710
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,868
Virtually guarantees you a bullseye.

711
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,660
Only one problem.

712
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:49,123
Fires just one shot at a time.

713
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:51,160
But I might've reloaded.

714
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:52,657
I'll take a chance on that.

715
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:54,032
I won't!

716
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,485
You see it was loaded after all.

717
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:01,327
To you Mr. drummond.

718
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,490
- What?
- Hello mr kruger.

719
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,615
What do you want?

720
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,035
I've told your boss already
we've done our bit of business

721
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:51,031
and that's that.

722
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:53,452
He didn't get everything.

723
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:55,368
He didn't get the boat.

724
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,831
That's his tough luck huh.

725
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,872
But he wants it.

726
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,660
Not a chance baby, now scram.

727
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:05,288
What's that?

728
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:06,992
That's little pandora's box.

729
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,115
Is this kruger's boat house?

730
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:27,410
Yes he's over there.

731
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:30,122
Silly Mr. kruger.

732
00:48:57,917 --> 00:48:58,917
Is he dead?

733
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:05,077
That's strange.

734
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,198
Not a Mark on him.

735
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,580
Just like miss Mary.

736
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,853
Well thank heavens he's not British.

737
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:17,573
Well he's not my responsibility you see.

738
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,698
Why kill him though?

739
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,913
What's so important about a boat?

740
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:24,697
Sound waves, could that be it.

741
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:26,489
What do you mean?

742
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,455
Well young kruger there

743
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,438
Was always talking about sound waves.

744
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:33,958
Powdered glass.

745
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:40,831
Of course.

746
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:41,833
Infrasound.

747
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,114
That's it.

748
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:47,035
That's what he was always going
on about, infrasound, yes.

749
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:49,462
Wonder if there's some
emergency lighting here.

750
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Yes.

751
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,373
What was that?

752
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:24,535
That's infrasonic sound.

753
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:27,702
Directed down through
these holes in the hull.

754
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:29,243
Breaks up the water friction.

755
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,081
Makes the boat slide faster.

756
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,103
And hey presto, you've won the race.

757
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,865
No wonder he was bumped off.

758
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:41,535
There's no need to murder
a man to stop him cheating.

759
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:46,028
All you've gotta do is to report
him to the race committee.

760
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:55,827
But what makes you so sure
that he will come himself?

761
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:56,833
I know him.

762
00:50:58,292 --> 00:50:59,292
He will.

763
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:04,618
Look for him.

764
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,865
Will all competitors

765
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:08,615
for the international gold cup

766
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,785
Proceed to the start buoy.

767
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:12,202
Oh look, there!

768
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:20,657
Yes.

769
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:21,667
Put 'em down.

770
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,035
I say it's terribly
exciting playing decoy.

771
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:35,762
I feel just like one
of those stuffed ducks.

772
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,368
Five seconds to go.

773
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,740
Four, three, two, one.

774
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,375
I say!

775
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:28,623
Do you think we could stop for a moment?

776
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,240
Didn't you say live dangerously butch?

777
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,330
Yes.

778
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,323
Well live dangerously.

779
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,410
They're trying to cut us off.

780
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:39,405
They've switched on the Sonic.

781
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,167
Tear gas!

782
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:47,539
Go on, you go there.

783
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,667
Drive.

784
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,618
Baroness Helga.

785
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:43,160
Five o'clock, one mile.

786
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:46,123
Estimated time of arrival, three minutes.

787
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,990
Received, central out.

788
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,581
Is this what you're after?

789
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:53,743
Don't touch it.

790
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:58,708
Turn it off!

791
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,698
Slow down or I'll shoot.

792
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:16,388
If you shoot me we'll
never stop in time.

793
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:30,206
You look a mess.

794
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:24,285
Well.

795
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:26,327
Not really used to roughing it baroness.

796
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:28,289
It won't be for long.

797
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,232
And it's a comfortable place to die.

798
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,118
Ooh!

799
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,456
Do you mind?

800
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:04,792
- Move.
- Hmm.

801
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,740
Cosy little place. - Come on.

802
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:21,035
Come on, move.

803
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,333
You wait here.

804
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,910
Two against one Mr. drummond.

805
00:58:37,917 --> 00:58:40,797
We don't wanna miss the
manager though, do we.

806
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,331
A drink sir.

807
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:48,913
Black and white with water please.

808
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:49,747
Black and white.

809
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:50,739
And water.

810
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:51,580
No ice.

811
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:55,039
- No ice.
- Right away sir.

812
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:56,452
And you sir?

813
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:57,538
Nothing.

814
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:59,032
Nothing for me thank you.

815
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,830
Black and white.

816
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:01,833
And water.

817
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,250
Thank you.

818
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:09,497
This way please.

819
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,535
Hmm not bad.

820
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:12,952
Little less water next time.

821
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:20,285
Oh dear, that reminds me,

822
00:59:20,292 --> 00:59:22,932
His excellency's expecting us for dinner.

823
00:59:30,792 --> 00:59:32,702
My dear carruthers.

824
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:33,708
Don't be alarmed.

825
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:38,410
Ah Mr. drummond.

826
00:59:38,417 --> 00:59:40,123
How very nice of you to come.

827
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:42,327
Thank you ladies.

828
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,410
You're not barouche at all,

829
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,123
You're thorensen aren't you.

830
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:49,581
Oh no no, he's barouche.

831
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:50,583
I saw him shot.

832
00:59:58,042 --> 00:59:58,997
Thorensen.

833
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,660
The killing of barouche was a necessity.

834
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:04,452
There was too much curiosity.

835
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:07,538
A coup de theatre, my dear sir.

836
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:12,032
Would you care for something
to drink Mr. drummond?

837
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,952
It's inevitable I suppose.

838
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:17,164
This desire to disguise yourself.

839
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:18,623
What do you mean?

840
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:23,285
the whole civilised
world finds Carl petersen

841
01:00:23,292 --> 01:00:24,498
totally repulsive.

842
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:28,468
You seem to have reached
the same conclusion.

843
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,080
Who is this Carl petersen?

844
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:34,539
You are.

845
01:00:34,542 --> 01:00:36,248
I can smell you.

846
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,865
You think you're so damn
clever don't you drummond.

847
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:40,365
But I'll show you.

848
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,375
I'll show you.

849
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:46,956
This, this island on the
crossroads of the mediterranean.

850
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:52,658
From here I will control the
whole destiny of the world.

851
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:57,710
Ridiculous you can't even
control your own temper.

852
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:18,955
Come on carruthers.

853
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:22,038
Mustn't keep he waiting
any longer must we.

854
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:23,582
Don't move Mr. drummond.

855
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,083
Drop it.

856
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:30,083
Hello flicky.

857
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:32,498
I wondered what had happened to you.

858
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,500
I missed you.

859
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:36,373
I shan't miss you.

860
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:41,365
So very slowly back down there.

861
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:45,282
And we're all changed for dinner.

862
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:47,157
Shall we gentlemen?

863
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:48,623
Shall we?

864
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:49,831
Yes.

865
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,490
The telegram you were expecting Carl.

866
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,831
Thank you my dear.

867
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:58,073
How do you like the clothes

868
01:01:58,083 --> 01:02:00,163
We provided for you Mr. drummond?

869
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:02,907
Excellent, they
might've been made for me.

870
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:04,702
They were my dear fellow.

871
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:06,288
They were.

872
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:07,623
History repeats itself.

873
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:09,535
Napoleon dreamt of the entire universe

874
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:11,157
Thronging to his door.

875
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:13,873
Now I shall fulfil his dreams.

876
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,535
Dressed as the Duke of Wellington?

877
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:17,873
Well of course my dear fellow.

878
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:19,910
Never back a loser.

879
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:27,535
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a dump like this?

880
01:02:27,542 --> 01:02:29,373
never, not even in england,

881
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,955
have I ever come across a hotel

882
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,448
Where the service met
with my satisfaction.

883
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:37,323
So I built and staffed my own.

884
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:42,157
pandora, I'm sure you'd prefer something

885
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:44,907
A trifle more exotic,
wouldn't you my dear.

886
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:46,827
You know my taste.

887
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:50,448
And what about you flicky,
with your sweet tooth.

888
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:52,414
I think she deserves a little reward

889
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:55,748
For having looked after you
so nicely, don't you think.

890
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,830
I thought working for
you was its own reward.

891
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:00,073
I can't eat that stuff.

892
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:03,873
Why don't you give it to pandora?

893
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,160
Do you think you should darling?

894
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:08,873
It's terribly bad for the complexion.

895
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:11,706
I have a perfect complexion.

896
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:15,073
see Mr. drummond, to get perfect service

897
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,943
One needs total single-mindedness.

898
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:25,747
Thank you sir.

899
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:26,785
See what I mean.

900
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:32,453
Ordinary servant would've
panicked, started to scream.

901
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,580
Not my girls.

902
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:43,198
Hello central.

903
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:44,914
Ready for number nine.

904
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:49,217
Thank you
control, message received.

905
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:53,414
Number seven please.

906
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:06,456
They'll drown!

907
01:04:13,292 --> 01:04:14,292
Help!

908
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:16,583
I can't swim

909
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,785
Remarkable girls
aren't they Mr. drummond.

910
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:39,077
You'll see that in training.

911
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,083
I wonder what for.

912
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,157
Control Mr. drummond.

913
01:04:49,167 --> 01:04:50,532
Perfect control.

914
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:51,998
These girls can do anything.

915
01:04:54,625 --> 01:05:01,493
Jerks jerks, titty who.

916
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:04,873
Jerks, titty who?

917
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:11,987
Central it's yoiks and
tally-ho, not jerks and titty who.

918
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:16,118
Yoiks yoiks, tally-ho.

919
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,865
This one's slightly
more stupid than some.

920
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,785
That's why she's having extra training.

921
01:05:19,792 --> 01:05:20,952
Now watch her take this.

922
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,615
Fantastic!

923
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:31,625
Faultless landing.

924
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:36,373
I think she's hurt.

925
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,375
Central.

926
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,206
Number seven needs reactivating.

927
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:42,073
Reactivate immediately.

928
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:44,455
She's...

929
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:45,458
Better.

930
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,660
Very interesting.

931
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:51,952
Are they all like that?

932
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:55,914
That one's so
stupid she's almost human.

933
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:57,032
Must give you somebody to talk to you

934
01:05:57,042 --> 01:05:58,782
When you wanna feel superior.

935
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:02,202
Please sir, can I have
this one to practise with.

936
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,808
Why don't she get
her riding right first.

937
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:23,331
Is there something wrong with him?

938
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:24,539
Has he been wrongly programmed?

939
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:26,077
Look here I really must protest.

940
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:28,243
This just isn't decent.

941
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,365
What about you Mr. drummond?

942
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:32,660
would you care to give us a little tuition

943
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:34,657
In the art of seduction?

944
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:38,823
Well now I'll have a try.

945
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,410
That's the way.

946
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:44,417
Just relax.

947
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:48,743
Arms around the neck, that's right.

948
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:52,698
I say, do remember you're British.

949
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,206
Got there at last drummond.

950
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:01,618
Mm.

951
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,785
well there has to be some
method of controlling them

952
01:07:03,792 --> 01:07:05,372
Doesn't there.

953
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:08,331
but I must say I didn't
expect to find something

954
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:10,743
As simple as a switch.

955
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,410
Hardly simple Mr. drummond.

956
01:07:13,542 --> 01:07:17,032
You've heard of artificial
legs, artificial hands.

957
01:07:17,042 --> 01:07:19,873
Well my girls have artificial brains.

958
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:22,155
Surgically implanted, of course.

959
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:25,948
I've termed the operation robotizing,

960
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,243
for want of a better word.

961
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,948
Sorry sir.

962
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:38,698
I don't know what happened.

963
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:41,368
You passed out in the heat of passion.

964
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,615
once they've been fully
trained and programed

965
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:46,115
you won't be able to tell the
difference between my girls

966
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:48,240
And the common or garden variety.

967
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:52,210
Except of course that
they'll be under my control.

968
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,414
Those two have been
trained as weightlifters.

969
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:11,623
They think big.

970
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:16,038
yes but apart from giving
you somebody to live with

971
01:08:16,042 --> 01:08:19,702
Who tolerates your nastiness,
what's the point of it all.

972
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:21,073
The point?

973
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:25,123
Eight million pounds Mr.
Drummond, that's the point.

974
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:26,532
A great deal of money.

975
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,778
Here we have the operations room.

976
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:57,535
Has this one had the treatment?

977
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:59,202
Your lovely spy?

978
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,038
No.

979
01:09:00,042 --> 01:09:03,122
she's supervising the installation
of the booster mechanism

980
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,660
On my little toy.

981
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:07,327
Thanks to you for getting me the boat.

982
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,073
What does your little toy do?

983
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,448
The sst1.

984
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:16,164
That airfield's pretty well guarded now,

985
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:18,123
You won't get near it again.

986
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,125
I don't need to.

987
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:25,277
Pandora would you show Mr.
Drummond how the prototype works.

988
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:31,205
Mr. drummond, would you
put your glass down please.

989
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:33,042
Move a little back.

990
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:36,833
Hold it.

991
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:45,417
Infrasound.

992
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:50,032
So you've gone right off
explosives now have you.

993
01:09:50,042 --> 01:09:51,157
Yes.

994
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:55,867
Unfortunately for pandora she
does so enjoy a good bang.

995
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:00,788
Will you offer Mr. drummond
another drink my dears.

996
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:01,907
Thank you.

997
01:10:01,917 --> 01:10:03,657
- Black and white.
- With water.

998
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:05,907
- No ice.
- Quite correct.

999
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,497
We're ready Carl.

1000
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,160
you see Mr. drummond,

1001
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,067
until I could get hold of that boat

1002
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,827
I couldn't quite work out how to employ

1003
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:17,333
Pandora's little gadget
for long-range destruction.

1004
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:20,539
but now, when the sst1 takes off tomorrow,

1005
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:23,873
I turn on my projector
and the infrasonic waves

1006
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:28,490
Will totally jam the supersonic
control system of the plane.

1007
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,285
What do you want to do that for?

1008
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,452
Eight million pounds.

1009
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:36,323
That's my fee for when the
plane's contracts are cancelled.

1010
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,743
And are we gonna see
this happen on your screen?

1011
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,660
Oh yes.

1012
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,157
Yes tomorrow morning.

1013
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:43,927
That's the last thing
either of you will see.

1014
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:47,353
After that I'm going to use it on you.

1015
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,365
Were you spying on us?

1016
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,375
No ma'am.

1017
01:10:57,708 --> 01:11:01,208
Mr. drummond said you
looked through the keyhole.

1018
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:02,705
Did you?

1019
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:03,708
No ma'am.

1020
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:12,998
I switched her off.

1021
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Good.

1022
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:21,208
Happy now?

1023
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:26,403
Yes I don't like being watched.

1024
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,750
Hey.

1025
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:39,785
Do you have a light?

1026
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:52,868
I only want a light.

1027
01:11:59,375 --> 01:12:00,375
Thank you.

1028
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,697
I am like your last cigarette.

1029
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,818
A special treat for the condemned.

1030
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:12,063
Dangerous to smoke in bed you know.

1031
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:16,702
That Helga is with him.

1032
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:17,914
She could have you.

1033
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,123
Oh yes?

1034
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:22,081
She's so selfish that one.

1035
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:24,243
I told her it was my turn.

1036
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,535
Makes me so terribly cross.

1037
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,323
Why don't you try me?

1038
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:38,327
You are not like him.

1039
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:44,065
Well you could pretend couldn't you.

1040
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:56,789
No no I'm sorry.

1041
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:03,913
But I promise you once
you know how it's very good.

1042
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:05,288
Yes I'm sure.

1043
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:08,432
But look are you sure you're not a robot.

1044
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:10,573
Oh dear you want a robot?

1045
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:11,538
- Yes.
- Why?

1046
01:13:11,542 --> 01:13:14,452
well you see I promised
my mother I wouldn't

1047
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,743
But I mean if you were a robot
then that would be all right.

1048
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:17,956
Wouldn't it?

1049
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:20,289
But mummy will never know.

1050
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,748
Oh I say.

1051
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,490
Mummy never told me about this.

1052
01:14:58,792 --> 01:14:59,702
Control.

1053
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:01,448
All numbers report to control.

1054
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:03,538
Numbers return.

1055
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:52,164
Must you be so rough darling.

1056
01:15:53,167 --> 01:15:54,782
Ooh I thought you'd never get here.

1057
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:56,452
Who you double crossing this time?

1058
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:58,323
I had to make contact.

1059
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,664
Petersen's watching all the time.

1060
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:01,667
All right.

1061
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:05,157
Now you've got me what do you want?

1062
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:06,167
CIA.

1063
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,785
Cl who?

1064
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:11,498
Washington thought you
needed looking after.

1065
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,535
How sweet of them.

1066
01:16:14,292 --> 01:16:16,372
You must think I'm a
bigger fool than I look.

1067
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:18,535
if you don't believe
me why did you come here

1068
01:16:18,542 --> 01:16:20,157
Instead of trying to swim for it.

1069
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:21,167
Curiosity.

1070
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,081
and the fact that the
nearest place to swim to

1071
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:26,073
200 miles away.

1072
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,289
I'm not that strong.

1073
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:28,872
Look.

1074
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,160
Petersen still trusts me.

1075
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:33,577
Do you want my help or not?

1076
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:36,243
Well how'd you get the
job in the first place?

1077
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,080
You just call him up and ask.

1078
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:40,493
Two years ago petersen needed
a girl who spoke Russian.

1079
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,500
I do.

1080
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:46,407
Suppressor's intact.

1081
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:48,157
Only thing, no gas.

1082
01:16:51,167 --> 01:16:53,202
Yes they think of everything don't they.

1083
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:54,448
Almost everything.

1084
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:55,458
Yes.

1085
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:02,032
if you shoot me I'll shoot
your fragile girlfriend,

1086
01:17:02,042 --> 01:17:03,748
And you wouldn't like that, would you.

1087
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:07,365
For many reasons yes, I think I would.

1088
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:12,156
Give me that gun or I'll shoot
the darling little traitor.

1089
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:25,827
I wouldn't if I were you.

1090
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Drummond!

1091
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:31,157
Drummond!

1092
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:56,914
If baroness Helga had alerted control

1093
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,748
Then we would've been
certain of his death.

1094
01:17:58,750 --> 01:17:59,750
All right.

1095
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:05,865
Hello control.

1096
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:06,705
Control.

1097
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,368
Have they finished
searching the grounds yet?

1098
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,660
Continue search.

1099
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:12,333
Out.

1100
01:18:16,917 --> 01:18:19,597
Central, drummond is not in the kitchen.

1101
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:23,708
Over there.

1102
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:26,708
Sit down.

1103
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:49,164
Number seven reporting.

1104
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:50,747
No sign of drummond.

1105
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,081
Out.

1106
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:54,448
They've searched everywhere Carl.

1107
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:56,243
My aim is still perfect.

1108
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,456
I must've killed him.

1109
01:18:57,458 --> 01:18:58,368
What a pity.

1110
01:18:58,375 --> 01:18:59,955
I would've liked him
to have seen the show.

1111
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,318
It's about to start at any minute.

1112
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,206
Hello central.

1113
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:34,868
Number seven reporting
from the kitchen area.

1114
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:39,160
Drummond is not here.

1115
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:41,698
Hello central.

1116
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:44,468
Recall all units, seal
all doors immediately.

1117
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:47,157
We're about to commence operations.

1118
01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:49,747
All numbers report to central.

1119
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,730
Doors and windows sealed immediately.

1120
01:19:53,292 --> 01:19:55,412
Operation about to commence.

1121
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,285
See you later handsome.

1122
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:04,663
See you later handsome?

1123
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:23,785
Helga would you get me a
shot of major Newman please.

1124
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:24,792
Yes Carl.

1125
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:30,663
Who's that?

1126
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:31,747
The man who's going to pay me

1127
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:34,850
When that lovely plane goes up in smoke.

1128
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:36,740
There you are major Newman.

1129
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,115
Your boys may be damn clever

1130
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:40,805
But they'll never build a plane like that.

1131
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:46,327
Eight million pounds.

1132
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:49,157
It's not bad is it.

1133
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:50,747
How monstrous!

1134
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:53,240
rather depends on whose
side you're on dear chap,

1135
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,080
doesn't it.

1136
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,289
I mean talking about money like that.

1137
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:57,702
Like a tradesmen.

1138
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:02,577
Nearly ready Carl.

1139
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:06,833
Now.

1140
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:24,705
Do you see what's happening?

1141
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:27,664
Their plane is supersonic,
our little toy is subsonic.

1142
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:30,547
I've jammed their controls,
they can do nothing.

1143
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,365
They will continue to climb

1144
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:35,475
And no one will ever know what happened.

1145
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:46,695
Stop it, stop it at once I say.

1146
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,365
I think I owe myself this pleasure.

1147
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:52,375
No don't.

1148
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:54,623
I was only going to tickle him.

1149
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:56,490
Have you gone mad?

1150
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:02,240
Use this in here and you'll
jam the destructor, you fool.

1151
01:25:10,417 --> 01:25:11,417
Yes.

1152
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,365
Turn it off petersen.

1153
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:20,206
Ah come in, just in time.

1154
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:21,118
They've almost gone into orbit.

1155
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:22,910
I said turn it off.

1156
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,282
Try and make me.

1157
01:25:24,292 --> 01:25:27,952
He can't use that, it'll jam
the destructor, he said so.

1158
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,573
Keep that destructor going.

1159
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,243
Yes.

1160
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:32,250
Right.

1161
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:37,660
I'm gonna walk up to you,
take that out of your hand,

1162
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:39,077
and I'm gonna turn off your little toy.

1163
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:40,914
Stop! Take another
step and I'll kill you.

1164
01:25:40,917 --> 01:25:41,917
You kill me,

1165
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:45,753
I'm gonna blow your eight
million pounds old boy.

1166
01:26:01,625 --> 01:26:02,489
Hello central.

1167
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:05,420
All numbers to report to
the rooftop immediately.

1168
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:09,164
Let's go.

1169
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:10,702
I don't think contracts for that plane

1170
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:12,328
Will be cancelled after all.

1171
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:16,375
Stop him!

1172
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,208
Stop him!

1173
01:26:37,917 --> 01:26:39,202
Hello central.

1174
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:40,698
Numbers one through six to eliminate

1175
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:43,548
Numbers eight through
13, immediate and urgent.

1176
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,160
And numbers eight through 13

1177
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,873
To eliminate numbers one through
six, immediate and urgent.

1178
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:48,705
Where's that little machine gotten to?

1179
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:50,414
Upstairs, too dangerous
a toy for you and me.

1180
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:53,123
- Oh but I thought if you...
- And central.

1181
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:56,615
number seven to pick up the
infrasonic manual destructor

1182
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:58,205
And dispose of it.

1183
01:26:58,208 --> 01:27:00,448
Orders confirmed.

1184
01:27:03,667 --> 01:27:04,667
Come on.

1185
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:22,778
Female of the species carruthers.

1186
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,581
Mr. drummond.

1187
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:35,115
Hello number seven.

1188
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:40,945
I thought central told you to
dispose of that horrid thing.

1189
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,456
That's just what I'm doing.

1190
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,918
Why don't you dispose
of it somewhere else, hmm?

1191
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:48,583
Here.

1192
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,490
Well thank you very much.

1193
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:06,918
Let's see if this'll open
the boathouse, shall we.

1194
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:11,452
Oh look look look, right here.

1195
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,458
Oh good show.

1196
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,490
Now you hold that.

1197
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,160
Okay.

1198
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:27,157
Please, please, please
be very very careful.

1199
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:27,997
Then don't look.

1200
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Okay.

1201
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:33,167
Ooh!

1202
01:28:43,417 --> 01:28:44,417
Oh!

1203
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:09,615
Peregrine, that was fantastic!

1204
01:29:11,167 --> 01:29:13,407
Yes it was rather, wasn't it.

1205
01:29:24,167 --> 01:29:25,907
sorry Mr. drummond

1206
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:29,032
But when you're playing
mata hari anything goes.

1207
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:30,873
Not the CIA.

1208
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:32,035
How surprising.

1209
01:29:33,042 --> 01:29:34,373
You couldn't possibly be working for

1210
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:36,160
That Russian organisation could you?

1211
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:37,702
How did you guess?

1212
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:39,956
Now get away from the boat.

1213
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:44,660
Are you Russian?

1214
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:48,627
Oh sorry peregrine but
we don't have infrasound.

1215
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:49,788
At least we didn't.

1216
01:29:49,792 --> 01:29:52,592
But that's marvellous,
why didn't you tell me.

1217
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:55,948
Is just about the only thing I can do.

1218
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:56,993
Speak Russian I mean.

1219
01:30:01,542 --> 01:30:04,373
Mr. drummond will you
tell his excellency please

1220
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:06,990
I'm not defecting, just
taking leave of absence

1221
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,780
To improve my Russian relations.

1222
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:13,205
Come back!

1223
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,573
Mummy will never forgive you!

1224
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:23,830
Number seven?

1225
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:36,365
Who are you working for?

1226
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:37,955
Who do you think?

1227
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:49,831
j some girls do satisfy you j

1228
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:53,664
j but they'll all mystify you j

1229
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:56,907
j they'll thrill you and some will do j

1230
01:30:56,917 --> 01:31:00,782
j anything you desire j

1231
01:31:00,792 --> 01:31:04,748
j there's no doubt about it j

1232
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:09,706
j it's proved to be true j

1233
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:13,323
j there is nothing in the world j

1234
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:17,693
j that can do what some girls do j
