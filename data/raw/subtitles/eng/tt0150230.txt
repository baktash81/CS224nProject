IN MY CRUISING CAREER...

38
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,906
THAT YOU CANNOT
EXPECT PEOPLE...

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,109
TO TRANSFORM
IN AN AFTERNOON.

40
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,778
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
REWRITE THEIR SOULS...

41
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:29,515
AND REDO EVERY DAY
THAT THEY'VE LIVED THUS FAR...

42
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,185
BEFORE THEY COME ON
TO THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS,

43
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,320
AND YET I EXPECT THAT.

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,989
I EXPECT THE TOTAL
TRANSFORMATION OF THEIR LIFE,

45
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,125
THE ENTIRE REWRITE
OF THEIR SOULS.

46
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,462
I AM FIGHTING MINUTE TO MINUTE,

47
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:42,763
EVERY MOMENT
THAT THEY'RE ON THE BUS,

48
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,531
FOR EVERY DAY THEY'VE LIVED
THUS FAR TO SEEM AS...

49
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,636
A ABSTRACT WRECKAGE...

50
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,737
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED
BUT IS PROBABLY A DELUSION,

51
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,073
AND THAT THIS IS
THE FIRST REAL DAY OF THEIR LIVES.

52
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,208
<i>NOT TO GENERALIZE.</i>

53
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,878
<i>AGAIN, WITH EVERY BUSLOAD,</i>
<i>THERE'S INTERNATIONALITY...</i>

54
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,582
<i>AND THEREFORE DIFFERENT
GRADATIONS...</i>

55
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,683
<i>OF CRUISING MANIFESTATION.</i>

56
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,886
<i>BUT I, UH--</i>

57
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,089
I FIND MYSELF
CONNECTING...

58
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,758
WITH SOME OF THEM
MORE THAN OTHERS.

59
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,894
<i>- IT IS RAINING?</i>
- KIND OF.

60
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,029
- HELLO.
<i>- HELLO.</i>

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,699
WHAT'S UP, BENITEZ?

62
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,834
<i>- WE'RE LEAVING.</i>
- WE'RE LEAVING?

63
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,037
- OH, IT'S RAINING.
- NO!

64
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,173
IT'S NOT RAINING.

IN HUMAN HISTORY.

67
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,926

UNDER THREAT
OF ASSASSINATION,

70
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:56,002
AND THE ASSASSINS
ARE OUR DREAMS TRIUMPHANT,

71
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,272
THE BY-PRODUCT OF SUCH A PURSUIT--
CREATIVITY AND RADICALIZATION--

72
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:04,010
WHICH ARE THE FURTHER THEMES
OF GREENWICH VILLAGE LINEAGE.

DEEP IN THE HEART
OF HIS OPIUM ADDICTION.

91
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,667
ALTHOUGH HE HAS MANY RESIDENCES

HE LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS...

129
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,493
IN THE WHITE HORSE
TAVERN ON HUDSON STREET...

130
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,627

FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE
DOROTHY PARKER WRESTLES...

132

WITH ALCOHOLISM AND
THE DEFEATS OF A LIFETIME...

133
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,102
AND FAILS.

134
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,178
<i>NEW YORK CITY
IS A LIVING ORGANISM.

135
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:56,448
<i>IT EVOLVES, IT DEVOLVES.
IT FLUCTUATES AS A LIVING ORGANISM.

136
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,118
SO MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH NEW YORK CITY...

137
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,956
IS AS VITRIOLIC AS
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MYSELF...

138
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,457
AND WITH ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING,

139
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,592
WHICH MEANS THAT IT CHANGES
EVERY MILLISECOND,

140
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,727
THAT IT'S IN
CONSTANT FLUCTUATION.

141
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,931
THIS WINTER I REALLY FELT
LIKE WE WERE GETTING A DIVORCE.

142
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,600
AND I WAS CERTAINLY
THE LOSER OF THAT DIVORCE.

143
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,803
THERE WAS ANGER.
I WAS OVERWHELMED.

144
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,007
I WAS REEMERGED
INTO MY OWN NAIVETE.

145
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,676
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW ANGRY
THE CITY WAS WITH ME.

146
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,946
IT SEEMED LIKE A VINDICTIVE WOMAN,
TO BE LIKE NO REASON WHATSOEVER,

147
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,616
JUST BY THE PURE RAGE
OF ITS OWN EXISTENCE.

148
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,586
BECAUSE THE CONCRETE SETTLED.

149
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:34,887
BECAUSE THE TERRA-COTTA
HAD BEEN METICULOUSLY CARVED.

150
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,556
BECAUSE SOME OF THE BUILDINGS
ARE HIGHER THAN OTHERS.

151
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,994
THE ANGER, THE INFERIORITY,

152
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:41,195
THAT SOME OF
THE SHORTER BUILDINGS FEEL, I FELT.

153
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,497
I SUDDENLY WAS NOT WELCOME
ON THIS ISLAND ANYMORE.

154
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,767
AND THE CITY AND I HAVE HAD...

155
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:48,768
A REEMERGENCE OF SOME KIND
IN THE SUMMER,

156
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,971
MAYBE BECAUSE I WAS ABLE
TO REFUEL MY CRUISE A LITTLE BIT...

157
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,574
BY WORKING LABORIOUSLY...

158
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:55,075
AND CRAWLING
MY WAY BACK ONTO THE ISLAND.

159
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,843
BECAUSE PERHAPS I PAID
PROPER RESPECT TO IT.

160
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,580
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE CITY WAS SO
ANGRY WITH ME DURING THIS WINTER.

161
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,318
I'M JUST GLAD THAT IT'S NOT QUITE
AS ANGRY WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

162
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,521
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK
TOO SOON, FOR GOD'S SAKES.

163
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,190
LIKE I SAID, THE RELATIONSHIP
SEEMS TO CHANGE,

164
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,859
AS ANY HUMAN
RELATIONSHIP WOULD...

165
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,461
AND WITH ANY LIVING THING.

166
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,865
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IF THIS
IS A LIVING ORGANISM,

167
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:20,266
IT'S MORE ON THE LINES OF A CYCLOPS.

168
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,367
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IF IT
IS A LIVING ORGANISM,

169
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,039
PERHAPS IT'S MORE ON THE
LEVEL OF A SCINTILLATING,

170
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,740
STREAMLINED MERMAID...

171
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,409
WHO SINGS TO ME AT NIGHT.

172
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,883
I GUESS I AM RIGHT NOW.

173
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,891
JOEL.

174
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,027
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO CHECK IN.

175
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,696
I DID THE 8:45 PICKUP.

176
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,365
HELLO. GRAY LINE.

177
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,501
<i>YOU CAN STAY OUT THERE</i>
<i>ONE MINUTE.</i>

178
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,170
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.

179
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,907
LET ME SEE IF MISS GALL
IS HERE. HOLD ON.

180
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,111
<i>THE LOWER LOOP IN THE
DOWNTOWN DIRECTION...

181
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,314
<i>NOW BOARDING THE BUS
OUTSIDE TO THE RIGHT.

182
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,788
WE NEED A TOUR GUIDE
FOR A SECOND SECTION DOWNTOWN.

183
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,593
HANG ON.
WAIT FOR THE SECOND SECTION.

184
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,465
<i>I THINK OF EVERY
DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP...

185
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:30,202
<i>AS ANOTHER LOOP
TOWARDS MY DEATH.

186
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,939
THAT IS WHY I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF THE DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP--

187
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,744
EACH LOOP AS A CONTINUOUS
AND INDIVIDUALIZED, UM,

188
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,481
SEARCH FOR PERFECTION.

189
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,091
H.G. WELLS ONCE WROTE...

190
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,828
THAT TO TELL THE HISTORY
OF NEW YORK CITY...

191
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:59,031
IS TO TELL THE STORY
OF THE WORLD.

192
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,234
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS.

193
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:08,106
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
PEOPLE WORK...

194
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:12,377
INSIDE THE WORLD TRADE
CENTER BUILDINGS...

195
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,047
DAILY.

196
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:20,385
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
BUILDINGS HAVE THEIR OWN ZIP CODE.

197
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,792
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
TOWERS THEMSELVES,

198
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,596
BUILT TO SWAY IN HEAVY WINDS
A FOOT AND A HALF IN ANY DIRECTION.

199
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,732
SOMETHING
TO CONSIDER.

200
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,537
SO WHAT'S UP, TIM?
HOW'S THE GRAY LINE?

201
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,672
- GRAY LINE IS LIKE--
- APPLE'S BETTER, RIGHT?

202
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,410
YEAH, DAMN RIGHT.
APPLE WAS LIKE A LIVING CARNIVAL.

203
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,079
WE WERE COSSACKS,
AND WE TOOK WHAT WE WANTED.

204
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,282
WE THREW PEOPLE OVERBOARD,
OFF THE BUS, IF WE DIDN'T LIKE THEM.

205
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,417
IT WAS OUR TERRITORY.

206
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,621
THE CITY BELONGED TO US
AT APPLE. -APPLE IS BETTER.

207
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,756
- ABSOLUTELY.
- NUMBER ONE.

208
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,426
I HAD MORE OF AN ERECTION
WHEN I WORKED AT APPLE.

209
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,095
I JUST FELT LIKE
SO MUCH MORE OF A MAN.

210
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,230
YOU KNOW APPLE
IS BETTER, RIGHT? -YEAH!

211
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,900
I WANTED TO HEAR YOU
SAY YES.

212
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,569
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY YES.

213
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,470
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

214
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,704
- NUMBER ONE.
- I'M GONNA PROBABLY GET FIRED.

215
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,608
I'LL PROBABLY BE HUNG
FROM A FLAGPOLE SOMEWHERE,

216
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:15,809
BUT APPLE IS BETTER.

217
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,043
APPLE IS BETTER!

218
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,382
I THINK THAT THE GREAT
TOUR GUIDES OF APPLE TOURS,

219
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,283
IN THAT SENSE,
WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARTACUS.

220
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,187
SPARTACUS WAS ONE OF THE GREAT
TOUR GUIDES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.

221
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,390
HE WOULD HAVE FIT IN
AT APPLE TOURS.

222
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,593
BRUTUS AND HIS CONSPIRATORS...

223
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:34,494
RIGHT BEFORE THE
ASSASSINATION OF CAESAR,

224
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,728
THEY WERE APPLE TOUR GUIDES.

225
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,932
BUT LIKE WILLY WONKA
IS A GRAY LINE TOUR GUIDE.

226
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,736
ALSO ONE OF MY GREAT
INSPIRATIONS ON THE TOUR ROUTE,

227
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,737
BUT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THERE.

228
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,007
ATTILA THE HUN...

229
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,211
WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD
APPLE DISPATCHER.

230
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,151
WHEREAS VIRGIL
IN THE <i>INFERNO,</i>

231
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,354
I THINK WOULD HAVE WORKED
FOR GRAY LINE.

232
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,557
HOW MANY YEAR NOW? -LIKE FOUR
YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING THE TOUR.

233
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,693
NO, FIVE. DON'T SAY FOUR,
PLEASE. -FIVE YEARS.

234
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,896
YEAH! BY THE TIME
YOU WORKED AT GRAY LINE,

235
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,565
YOU GOT THAT TROLLEY BUS
AND YOU GO TO CENTRAL PARK.

236
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,701
- I REMEMBER THE DAMN TROLLEY.
- I WORKED ON THE DOUBLE-DECKER.

237
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:19,438
I REMEMBER THAT. -LATER ON
YOU COME WORK AT APPLE.

238
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,107
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S BEEN
FIVE YEARS OF THIS, GOING IN CIRCLES.

239
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,845
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING
ON THIS SIDEWALK FOR FIVE YEARS.

240
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,980
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

241
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,860
OH, LOOK, STRAIGHT UP.
THAT'S A GREAT VIEW.

242
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,598
THE WHITE TERRA-COTTA
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

243
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,535
THAT'S THE ONE BUILDING THAT LOUIS
SULLIVAN DESIGNED...

244
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:49,736
FOR NEW YORK CITY.

245
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,538
HMM.
LOOK AT THE METICULOUSNESS.

246
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,741
THAT STRONG VERTICAL LAUNCH
IN THE FACADE...

247
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,478
IS TYPICAL
OF THE SULLIVAN MILIEU.

248
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,147
YOU KNOW, TERRA-COTTA...

249
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,385
BECOMES ONE OF THE
MAJOR MATERIALS...

250
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:05,786
OF NEW YORK CITY ARCHITECTURE.

251
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,420
IT'S LIKE
A SAND-BAKED BRICK.

252
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,689
IT'S NOT QUITE GRANITE,
AND IT'S NOT QUITE BRICK.

253
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,824
IT WALKS
THE MAINSTREAM MIDDLE.

254
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,960
IT WAS EXCELLENT
FOR NEW YORK ARCHITECTURE...

255
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,629
BECAUSE IT COULD HANG OFF
THE SKELETONS OF THE BUILDINGS.

256
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,765
IT'S MUCH LIGHTER THAN STONE.

257
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,002
THE DIFFERENCE, THOUGH,
BETWEEN STONE AND TERRA-COTTA...

258
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:23,403
THAT STRIKES ME THE MOST...

259
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:27,772
IS THAT TERRA-COTTA REFLECTS THE
SUNLIGHT, AND STONE ABSORBS IT.

260
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,442
YOU CAN SEE THE BOUNCY LIGHT
ALONG THIS BUILDING.

261
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,315
WHEN I SEE TERRA-COTTA LIKE
THIS, IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL...

262
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,553
LIKE I'M SENSELESSLY RUNNING...

263
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:41,654
THROUGH A MEADOW OR
HIGH GRASSLAND AREA NUDE,

264
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,857
CHASING A WOMAN I'VE NEVER MET
BEFORE WHO'S ENTIRELY NUDE.

265
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,526
IT'S JUST THE MOST RAW
AND PRIMORDIAL CHASE.

266
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,263
TWO NUDE HUMAN BEINGS RUNNING
THROUGH GRASSLAND MARSH AREA.

267
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,033
AS YOU MOVE UP THE BUILDING,

268
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:55,534
CAN'T YOU FEEL THE
UNDULATIONS OF HER CURVATURE?

269
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,135
THE--

270
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,339
OHH! YES!

271
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,474
YES!

272
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,011
TH-THAT SLIGHT GROAN...

273
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:06,212
THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE
IN THE ACT OF INTERCOURSE.

274
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,347
THE, LIKE, "UHH!"

275
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,016
LIKE THE SOMEWHAT DYING GRUNT
OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN GRUNTING...

276
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,685
IN THE STORMS
OF HER OWN MALAISE.

277
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,989
YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE
METICULATIONS OF THE CORNICE LINES

278
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,790
OF THE TERRA-COTTA.

279
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,558
THAT'S WHY THE TERRA-COTTA
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

280
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,227
IT'S THE "UHH,"
THE "UHH" MOMENTS OF LIFE.

281
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,965
UHH! UHH!

282
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,701
YES! YES!

283
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,438
OH, GOD, PLEASE!

284
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,108
THE BEGGING PARTS OF LIFE
ON THE LEFT SIDE.

285
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,845
YOU SEE THOSE LION-ESQUE
CHARACTERS WAY UP THERE?

286
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:44,115
PLEASE DON'T STOP.
PLEASE DON'T STOP.

287
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,343
<i>HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME
IN THE BACK?

288
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,021
TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND TREES
ARE PLANTED,

289
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,758
TEN AND A HALF MILLION CARTLOADS
OF TOPSOIL IMPORTED...

290
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,028
AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES
OF DRAINAGE PIPES LAID,

291
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,164
AND THESE ARE
THE BASIC INGREDIENTS...

292
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,833
OF THE SUPPOSEDLY NATURAL
CREATION...

293
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,502
CALLED CENTRAL PARK.

294
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,240
THERE IS NOTHING NATURAL
ABOUT CENTRAL PARK.

295
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,375
WELCOME.

296
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,976
FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED,

297
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,714
THE ESSENTIAL LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT
OF THIS ORIGINAL CENTRAL PARK,

298
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,984
SEES A GROUP OF BOYS PLAYING A
PRIMORDIAL FORM OF BASEBALL...

299
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,654
ON THE LOWER PLAY LAWNS
IN THE 1850s,

300
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,391
AND AT THAT MOMENT OUTLAWS
BASEBALL FROM CENTRAL PARK.

301
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,661
THE MEN WHO BUILD AND DESIGN THIS
PARK ARE TRANSCENDENTALISTS.

302
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,932
TO THEM, CENTRAL PARK IS A
PLACE TO BECOME ONE WITH NATURE,

303
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,602
TO FOCUS ON TREES,
TO SCINTILLATE WITH GRASS,

304
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,805
TO STARE INTO
ONE ANOTHER'S EYES.

305
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,543
NO SWEATING ALLOWED
IN THE ORIGINAL CENTRAL PARK.

306
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,678
NO PERSPIRATION
OF ANY KIND.

307
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,881
ANYONE YOU SEE CONGREGATING
FOR THE BASEBALL GAME ON THE LEFT,

308
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,550
BICYCLING,
ROLLER-BLADING, JOGGING,

309
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:29,288
THEY ARE NOT
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.

310
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,423
ANYONE YOU SEE LOUNGING
IN THE SUN,

311
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:35,160
HAVING A PICNIC
OR KISSING,

312
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,363
THEY <i>ARE</i>
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.

313
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,033
ACK! <i>"MUCHO" GRACIAS.</i>

314
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,168
- MUCHAS GRACIAS.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

315
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:47,439
- MUCHAS GRACIAS.
- SAY <i>HOLA</i> TO BUENOS AIRES FOR ME.

316
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,574
¿COMO?

317
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:53,312
SAY HELLO TO BUENOS AIRES
FOR ME.

318
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,447
- SAY HELLO?
- MM-HMM.

319
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,116
HELLO, YEAH. WHEN YOU
GET TO BUENOS AIRES.

320
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,252
- AH, YES.
- YES. <i>SI.</i>

321
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,455
THANK YOU.

322
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,260
- CIAO.
- BEAUTIFUL.

323
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,929
BEAUTIFUL. WE'RE BEAUTIFUL.
THE PARK IS BEAUTIFUL.

324
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,598
- YES. THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK.
- NICE TO MEET YOU. CIAO.

325
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,734
- CIAO.
- <i>ADIOS.</i>

326
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,005
STYLE.

327
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,944
I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT BIDS.
WERE YOU INTERESTED IN TAKING ONE?

328
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,614
OH, UM, I LOOKED AT
WHAT'S LEFT.

329
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,352
THE ONES I WAS INTERESTED IN WERE
TAKEN. -JUST WANTED TO CHECK.

330
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,422
THE ONLY ONE I WOULD'VE BEEN
INTERESTED IN THAT WASN'T TAKEN...

331
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,623
WAS THAT 34.

332
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,893
BUT THAT'S GOT SUCH AN EARLY
HOTEL PICKUP, AND I-- YOU KNOW.

333
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,663
SO YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.

334
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:44,464
- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
- PICK A BID...

335
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,833
SO YOU'LL KNOW YOU'LL HAVE STEADY
WORK. -TAKE THE DAMN BID, LEVITCH!

336
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:53,104
YEAH, BUT I WAS TALKING TO TANYA.
THERE'S NO WAY TO REWRITE THE BIDS?

337
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,774
NO REWRITING. -LIKE--
THEY'RE, LIKE, WITH SOLIDITY.

338
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,977
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- TAKE THE BID, TIM.

339
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,080
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

340
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:02,181
YOU DON'T CARE WHEN
YOU'RE UP AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING.

341
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,084
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ANYWAY AT 7:00 IN THE MORNING.

342
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:05,285
NEITHER DO I.

343
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:10,188
I'M DOIN' IT. YOU GET 20 HOURS
A WEEK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

344
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,858
YEAH, YOU GET 20 HOURS A
WEEK, AND THAT'S ONE THING.

345
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:13,927
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT.

346
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,428
IT'S BEIN' DECIDED NOW.

347
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,196
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT
ANYWAY, TIM. -DON'T BE LATE.

348
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,332
RIGHT. -IT MAY BE
TOO LATE IN A FEW MINUTES.

349
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,467
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

350
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,671
THIS IS LIKE MY LAST FEW
MINUTES TO REALLY DECIDE.

351
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,806
I APPRECIATE IT.

352
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,009
I'LL TAKE THESE NEXT FEW MINUTES...

353
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,010
AND DEEPLY
CONTEMPLATE AND MAKE SURE.

354
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,295
<i>IF I HAVE AN ESSENTIAL GOAL
ON THE CRUISE RIGHT NOW,

355
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,965
I THINK THAT
THE SIMPLEST GOAL...

356
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,635
IS PERHAPS TO--

357
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,711
TO BE ABLE TO EXHIBIT...

358
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:09,448
THAT I AM THRILLED
TO BE ALIVE...

359
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,117
AND TO BE STILL RESPECTED.

360
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,989
THE MORE SOULFUL OF US--

361
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,193
I SUPPOSE THE BUDDHIST OR
WHATEVER LABEL YOU WANT TO PUT...

362
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,396
ON THOSE EXPERIENCING
FURTHER INDIVIDUALITY...

363
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,599
MIGHT SAY, "LOOK, WHY SHOULD YOU
CARE ABOUT RESPECT FROM OTHERS?

364
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,802
"JUST THE THRILL OF BEING ALIVE
IS YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

365
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,471
YOU CAN DO THAT ALONE
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM".

366
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,675
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
THE CRUISE IS FOR ME.

367
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,878
THE CRUISE IS ABOUT
THE SEARCHINGS...

368
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,547
FOR EVERYTHING WORTHWHILE
IN EXISTENCE.

369
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,217
IT IS ABOUT WALKING INTO THE BAR
AND LUSTING AFTER...

370
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,886
ALL THE WORTHWHILE POSSIBILITIES
OF THE WORLD.

371
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,021
IT IS ABOUT FLESH.

372
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,157
IT IS ABOUT WAVES
UNDULATING.

373
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,962
AND IT IS ABOUT
EXHIBITIONISM.

374
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,532
YOU KNOW, I WANT
TO LOOK AT THE FLOWER...

375
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:01,233
AND APPRECIATE THE
BEAUTY OF A FLOWER.

376
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,368
SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT SAY,

377
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,805
"YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FLOWER
AND BECOME THE FLOWER.

378
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,006
ISN'T THAT EVEN BETTER?"

379
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,308
BUT THEN I FURTHER
WOULD LOVE IT ON THE CRUISE...

380
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:11,811
IF I CAN LOOK AT THE FLOWER,

381
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,512
APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY
OF THE FLOWER...

382
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,715
AND THEN HAVE THE FLOWER
APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF ME.

383
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,121
THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT CRUISING RIGHT NOW.

384
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,324
YES, BECOMING THE FLOWER WOULD
BE A LOT OF FUN. I CAN DO THAT TOO.

385
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,828
I CAN DO THAT ON WEDNESDAY.
I'M FREE THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

386
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,129
I CAN TRY TO BECOME THE FLOWER.

387
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,264
BUT COME THE WEEKEND,
GODDAMN IT,

388
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,934
I WILL APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF THE FLOWER,

389
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,603
AND THEN LIKEWISE,
I WILL STAND EXHIBITIONISTIC,

390
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,807
HAVING THE FLOWER APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF ME.

391
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,611
I THINK HAVING AN INTIMATE
"LOVE AFFAIR"...

392
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,213
WITH A FLOWER...

393
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,416
IS FAR MORE PSYCHOTIC
AND RIVETING...

394
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,085
THAN HAVING
"A LOVE AFFAIR"...

395
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,289
WITH SOME OF THE BANAL CREATURES
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

396
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,093
ALTHOUGH I'D BE
INTO THAT TOO.

397
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,277
WELCOME.

398
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:56,547
THIS IS MY FRIEND RUSSIO'S ROOM,
AND I'M CRASHING HERE RIGHT NOW.

399
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,851
CIVILIZATION...

400
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,520
IS THE AMPUTATION...

401
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,257
OF EVERYTHING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO US,

402
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,460
AN EXPERIMENT CREATED...

403
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,596
BY ALIENS...

404
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,265
UNABLE TO HAVE SEX.

405
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,604
CIVILIZATION
IS THE MOLESTATION...

406
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,807
OF EVERYTHING
WE EVER COULD BE,

407
00:22:55,807 --> 00:23:00,077
A GIANT REPRESSION
MELTING INTO SUPPRESSION,

408
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,815
SO THAT YOU NEVER SAY
WHAT YOU MEAN.

409
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,620
CIVILIZATION...

410
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,823
IS BREATHING DOWN OUR NECKS,

411
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,492
SPLITTING US APART.

412
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,628
WE ARE WRECKAGE...

413
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,763
WITH BEATING HEARTS.

414
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,568
CIVILIZATION
IS A CAN OF HAIR SPRAY...

415
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,771
SPRAYING FOR
THE SEASONLESS VEIN...

416
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:30,509
INTO A HAIR NET
MADE UP OF CURLS,

417
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,712
ONLY EVER MEANT TO BE WAVES.

418
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,516
CIVILIZATION--
GENOCIDE BELIEFS,

419
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,253
MORALISTIC,
SEE-THROUGH LACE BLOUSES,

420
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,389
MISSILES BALLISTIC,

421
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:48,659
LACKADAISICAL,
MELANCHOLIC RED LIPSTICK.

422
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,397
WHEN ONE FEELS NAUSEOUS
BUT DOESN'T FEEL SICK.

423
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,134
CIVILIZATION
KNEW WHO YOU WERE...

424
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,337
BEFORE YOU WERE EVER BORN,

425
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:03,074
FORGAVE YOU WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU NEEDED FORGIVING.

426
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,811
AND YOU NEVER ONCE...

427
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,413
SURPRISED...

428
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,548
THIS CIVILIZATION.

429
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,752
AND YOU NEVER ONCE FELT...

430
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,421
THAT SENSATION.

431
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,093

441
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,512
I WANNA GO HOME.

442
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,852
FOURTEEN HUNDRED

443
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:48,453

SEVEN MILES

447
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,935
A SLICE OF THE STATE
OF INDIANA...

448
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,672
VAULTED ONTO THE CORNER
OF 34th STREET AND FIFTH AVENUE.

449

KING KONG CLIMBED IT.

450
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:16,747
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
WILL BE IN FRONT OF US...

451
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:20,485
WHEN O'SHAYNE MAKES
THE MASCULINE TURN.

452
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:27,425
IF ARCHITECTURE IS THE HISTORY
OF ALL PHALLIC EMOTION,

453
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,094
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING...

454
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,764
IS UTTER CATHARSIS,

455
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,967
AND WE ARE SITTING
IN ITS SILHOUETTE.

00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,772
THE BEAUTIFUL PYRAMID

MEANT TO BE A REPLICA

LEWIS MUMFORD, THE MAJOR

CALLED

461

END QUOTE.

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,593
UNINSPIRED VOLUPTUOUSNESS...

465
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,999
SUNLIGHT-- POWERFUL.

466
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:12,269

468
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,812
THE ARCH IN THE PARK WILL BE
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BUS...

469
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,481
WHEN O'SHAYNE SWINGS US
ONTO 14th STREET.

470
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,218
AND 14th STREET IS THE WIDEST

471
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,821
THIS IS WHERE THE ISLAND IS...

472

LITERALLY TWO AND
A HALF MILES WIDE.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THAT IS ALL.

474

THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILES LONG.
2.4 MILLION PEOPLE.

THE FULTON FISH MARKET...

478
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:56,047
WILL BE MORE OF AN ODOR THAN A
LANDMARK AT THIS TIME OF DAY,

00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,250
BUT IT REALLY SWINGS OUT
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.

YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT LATER,

TAKE YOUR CHILDREN
OUT... -AND GET DRUNK.

499

00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,127
<i>IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE
HAVE TO WORK FOR A LIVING.

504
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,330
IT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING,
IF I HAD A CHOICE--

505
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,465
OTHER THAN MY ACNE--

506
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,135
I THINK WOULD BE THE FIRST THING
I WOULD REMOVE FROM MY LIFE.

507
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,639
IF I COULD ERASE AN
ASPECT OF MY LIFE,

508
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,940
IT WOULD BE THIS NEED
TO WORK FOR A LIVING.

509
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,812
YOU UNDERSTAND, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE TOUR ITSELF.

510
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,250
WHEN I'M ON THE TOUR ITSELF...

511
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:38,451
AND I'M SHOWING OTHERS
THE APPRECIATION OF BEAUTY...

512
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,151
AND THE HUGENESS OF ALL THIS,

513
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,888
AND EXPERIENCING THE LASCIVIOUS
VOYEURISM OF THE TOUR BUS,

514
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,091
AND EROTICIZING WOMEN
IN A CONSPIRACY WITH THIS CITY,

515
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,761
AND HAVING SPIRITUAL
TANTRIC CONNECTIONS...

516
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,430
WITH INTERNATIONAL
FLESH CONGREGATIONS,

517
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,633
THIS IS NOT, IN MY MIND,
WORKING FOR A LIVING.

518
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,768
YET, AT THE SAME TIME,
IT IS,

519
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,438
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE WEEK
WHEN I'VE MADE $200 AFTER TAXES...

520
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,342
AND I HAVE ALL THESE OTHER
PRAGMATIC EXPENSES...

521
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:05,243
JUST TO KEEP THE CRUISE ALIVE,

522
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,378
YOU KNOW, IT'S RIDICULOUS.

523
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:11,115
I CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER WAKE UP
EARLY IN THE MORNING AGAIN,

524
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,785
NOT UNLESS I WAS CRUISING.

525
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,944
<i>THE ROADS AROUND YOU NOW...

526
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:44,214
<i>WILL BECOME CLAUSTROPHOBIC
AND NARROW IN FEELING.

527
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,418
AND THIS WILL NOT JUST BE
YOUR OWN PROJECTION.

528
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:52,222
THE ROADS <i>ARE</i> CLAUSTROPHOBIC
AND NARROW IN FEELING.

529
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,426
THESE ARE THE OLDEST ROADWAYS
OF MANHATTAN ISLAND.

530
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:59,696
THESE DESIGNED BY THE DUTCH
IN THE EARLY 17th CENTURY.

531
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:03,434
WELCOME TO NEW AMSTERDAM.

532
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,773
FONTANEZ CONTINUES TO
AUDACIOUSLY IMPROVISE,

533
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:12,510
NOT ONLY WITH THE TOUR ROUTE,
BUT WITH HIS OWN LIFE.

534
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,487
<i>NEXT DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP

535
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:23,188
<i>IS IN 20 MINUTES.

536
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,591
<i>NO MORE BOARDING AT THIS TIME.

537
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:26,292
<i>NEXT DOUBLE-DECKER
LOOP TOUR IS IN 20 MINUTES.

538
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,060
<i>NO BOARDING AT THIS TIME.

539
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,865
YOU'VE GOT BLOOD ALL OVER YOU.

540
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,534
FUCKIN' SHAVING THIS MORNING
WAS LIKE A CARNAGE.

541
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:41,338
JUST CLEAN YOURSELF UP. -THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO.

542
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,076
GEORGE WAS CRITICIZING
THE LINING.

543
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:48,279
I'LL GRANT YOU, IT'S NOT IN
GOOD SHAPE. IT NEEDS NEW LINING.

544
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,482
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
THAT SHOULD AFFECT MY, YOU KNOW--

545
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,685
THE COSMETICS ARE A TRICKY THING
ON THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS.

546
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,423
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF SIMPLE...

547
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,626
...CONFORMIST FASTIDIOUSNESS,
YOU KNOW.

548
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:05,896
I'M NOT DRESSING TO IMPRESS
MY GRANDMOTHER, YOU KNOW.

549
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:09,100
I AM, IN A LAUNCHING
AND VITRIOLIC WAY,

550
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,837
TRYING, AT ANY EXPENSE,
TO GRAB THE COLLARS OF PEOPLE...

551
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:16,040
WHO HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY...

552
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,175
AND TRYING TO GRAB
THEIR ATTENTION...

553
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,845
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE GREATEST TUMULTUOUSNESS.

554
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:25,115
AND RIPPED LINING
IS PART OF THAT ROUTINE.

555
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,055
I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO
UNDERSTAND THAT, THOUGH,

556
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,456
BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER DONE IT.

557
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,259
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THEIR DOUBLE-DECKER TOUR.

558
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,470
ST. PAUL'S CHURCH, IN BROWN,
IN FRONT OF THE BUS,

559
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,606
SITTING ON BROADWAY ITSELF,

560
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,176
WAS BUILT BY THE BRITISH EMPIRE...

561
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:52,877
WHEN THIS WAS STILL
A COLONY IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE...

562
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,012
AND NOT A STATE
IN THE UNION.

563
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:58,216
GEORGE WASHINGTON--
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM.

564
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,053
HE TOOK HIS OATH OF OFFICE...

565
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:01,854
AS THE FIRST PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES...

566
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:05,156
AT THE CORNER
OF WALL STREET AND BROAD,

567
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,291
APRIL 30, 1789.

568
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:11,029
JUST AFTER THE OATH, WASHINGTON
IS MARCHED IN A PROCESSION HERE...

569
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,164
ON THE LEFT, UP BROADWAY,

570
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:16,367
TAKING A FURTHER LEFT TURN
INTO ST. PAUL'S CHURCH.

571
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:20,104
WASHINGTON KNEELS AT THE ALTAR
ON A PILLOW...

572
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,374
AND PRAYS FOR THE FUTURE
OF THE UNION.

573
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,044
THE PILLOW STILL SITS
UNDER GLASS...

574
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,781
AT THE ALTAR IN ST. PAUL'S,
ON YOUR LEFT.

575
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,985
"I LOVE THE MAN
THAT CAN SMILE IN TROUBLE,

576
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,722
"THAT CAN GATHER STRENGTH
IN TOTAL DISTRESS...

577
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,391
AND GROW BY REFLECTION".

578
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,662
THOMAS PAINE PARK.

579
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,678
YOU KNOW, ACCORDING
TO THE CITY REPORTS,

580
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:04,415
ELEVEN PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED
OFF THIS BRIDGE...

581
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,550
AND SURVIVED.

582
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,260
ONE OF MY CRUISING
DREAMS WOULD BE...

583
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:16,461
TO GET A CRUISE TOGETHER
WITH THOSE 11.

584
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,769
I LOVE THESE THINGS.

585
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,108
I CRUISED THIS BRIDGE
ONCE SOLO...

586
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,777
WHEN I WAS IN
A SEVERE SOLO ANGST,

587
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,715
WHEN THE ENTIRE WORLD HAD
DIVORCED ITSELF FROM ME...

588
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:37,816
ON A SINGULAR EVENING,

589
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,184
WHICH IS USUALLY
ON TUESDAY NIGHTS.

590
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,853
AND, UH,
I CRUISED THE BRIDGE,

591
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,057
REALIZING THAT, UH,
THE PILLARS OF STONE...

592
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,192
WERE MY FRIENDS.

593
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,463
THEY REALLY
MAKE ME FEEL WHOLE.

594
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:56,200
THEY REMIND ME THAT MY FUTURE
HAS A BRIGHTNESS, PERHAPS.

595
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,004
EVEN IF I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO BELIEVES THAT,

596
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:01,005
I KNOW THEY BELIEVE IT.

597
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,425
ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT...

598
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:21,826
HAVING THE TRIPTYCHS OF
THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AS A FRIEND,

599
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:25,563
CERTAINLY, IS THAT
IT NEVER CONTRADICTS ME.

600
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,300
IF IT MAKES ME FEEL FUTILE,
IT DOES IT INDIRECTLY,

601
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,435
WITH A SUBTLETY.

602
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,105
IT DOES IT WITH AN AMBIVALENCE
AND AN ALOOFNESS.

603
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:38,375
THERE'S NO VICTORY
IN ITS SUBJUGATION OF ME.

604
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,513
IF IT SUBJUGATES ME,
THAT'S THE DELUSION,

605
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:42,014
THE POWER OF MY OWN MIND.

606
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,517
THE BEST MOMENTS IN
OUR FRIENDSHIPS...

607
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:46,918
ARE WHEN I BECOME THE
BROOKLYN BRIDGE IN MY MIND,

608
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,587
WHEN I REALIZE
THAT WE ARE EQUALS.

609
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,017
THESE ARE
THE WORLD TRADE CENTERS.

610
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,356
YEAH, SEE THESE TWO TOWERS?
THE TWIN TOWERS, SEE?

611
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,491
BROTHERS.

612
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,161
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO, UM,

613
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,830
SPIN IN BETWEEN
THE TWO TOWERS.

614
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,499
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UM, SPIN AROUND
AND YOU MAKE YOURSELF DIZZY?

615
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,504
THEN YOU LOOK UP,

616
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:40,205
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE BUILDINGS
ARE FALLING IN ON TOP OF YOU.

617
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:44,041
YEAH, I RECOMMEND THAT.
IT'S FUN.

618
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,244
IF YOU GET TO STAND IN THE
PLAZA BETWEEN THE TWO TOWERS.

619
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,982
BUT DON'T LOOK UP
UNTIL AFTER YOU'RE DIZZY.

620
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,057
GOOD VIEW
OF COMMUTERS...

621
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,328
RUNNING TOWARDS
THEIR DESTINATIONS...

622
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,463
AND FROM THEMSELVES.

623
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,284
<i>I THINK THAT WHEN I
THINK ABOUT MY FUTURE,

624
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:31,021
<i>INTERESTINGLY, I THINK
ABOUT MY GRANDPARENTS,

625
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,025
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
MY GRANDPARENTS

626
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,126
ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

627
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,894
I SPENT MANY
FORMATIVE MOMENTS...

628
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,563
IN MY FORMATIVE YEARS
WITH THEM.

629
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,233
ALL OF MY SUMMERS
WERE CRUISING WITH THEM.

630
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,902
AND FROM THEIR
POINT OF VIEW,

631
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,105
I KNOW THAT THEY FEEL
THAT I AM CURRENTLY A FAILURE...

632
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,774
AND WILL ALWAYS BE
A DOWNTRODDEN FAILURE.

633
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:55,579
AND I THINK THAT OFTEN THAT
MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FUTURE...

634
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,783
VEER TOWARDS THEIR POINTS
OF VIEW ON THE UNIVERSE,

635
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,918
WHAT THEY CONSIDER
TO BE IMPORTANT,

636
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,088
AND WHAT THEY CONSIDER
TO BE IMPORTANT...

637
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:05,189
IS A BASIC SELF-PRESERVATIONISM...

638
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,858
AND SECURITY THAT I AM NOT
CREATING FOR MYSELF.

639
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:12,128
WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE
IMPORTANT IS HAVING AN OCCUPATION,

640
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,730
A NICHE IN SOCIETY,

641
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:18,002
SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE AT A PARTY AND
SOMEBODY ASKS YOU WHAT YOU DO,

642
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,137
YOU'LL HAVE
A SINGLE-WORD ANSWER...

643
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,806
OR AT LEAST YOU CAN ANSWER
WITHIN A SENTENCE.

644
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:27,611
WELCOME. <i>I KNOW THAT THEY
THINK THAT I'M NOT ALTOGETHER...</i>

645
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,747
<i>WITH MY FEET ON THE GROUND.

646
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,950
<i>I KNOW THAT THEY FEEL THEY'RE
GOING TO BE DYING VERY SOON...

647
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,687
<i>WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I AM
GOING TO KIND OF FADE OUT...

648
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,356
<i>INTO A SUPRATERRESTRIAL
FAILURE.

649
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:43,094
A SERIES OF AGGRAVATIONS,
A SERIES OF FRUSTRATIONS.

650
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,831
THEIR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN ME
FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY LIFE...

651
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,768
IS SOMETHING I'VE
ALWAYS BEEN CONTENDING WITH...

652
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:50,969
AND ALWAYS BEEN OBSESSED WITH.

653
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,072
BYE-BYE. THANK YOU.

654
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:55,373
<i>IF I HAD AN IMMEDIATE GOAL
ON AN AFTERNOON LIKE TODAY,

655
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:59,643
<i>IT WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE
SOME CONCRETENESS TO THEM,

656

657

661
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,591

I GRANT YOU,

663
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,764
ALL THESE WORDS I'M USING
ARE KIND OF BLAND AND VAGUE TERMS,

665
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:25,268
THEY'RE THE MOST CONCRETE AND
ABSORBING GOALS A PERSON CAN HAVE.

666
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:29,006
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE
ABLE TO TELL MY GRANDPARENTS...

667
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:32,076
THAT I'VE DONE SOMETHING
THAT THEY CAN APPRECIATE,

668
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,777
THAT THEY CAN RESPECT.

669
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,615
I REALLY, REALLY
DO NOT WANT TO BECOME...

670
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,819
THE PERSON THAT THEY THINK
THAT I'M GOING TO BECOME.

671
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:33,070
THE, UH, IMAGE MAKES ME THINK
OF THIS CONVERSATION,

672
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,874
UH, WITH THIS WOMAN
THE OTHER DAY.

673
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:42,145
SHE WAS A FASTIDIOUS, JUDAIC-TYPE
WOMAN IN VERY SEXUAL SLACKS.

674
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,281
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE GRID PLAN.

675
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,484
AND I MADE THE COMMENT
ABOUT HOW, YOU KNOW,

676
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,154
THE GRID PLAN EMANATES
FROM OUR WEAKNESSES,

677
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,823
THIS LAYOUT OF AVENUES
AND STREETS IN NEW YORK CITY,

678
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,958
THIS SYSTEM
OF 90-DEGREE ANGLES.

679
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,696
TO ME, THE GRID PLAN IS PURITAN,
IT'S HOMOGENIZING,

680
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:03,500
IN A CITY WHERE THERE IS
NO HOMOGENIZATION AVAILABLE.

681
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,704
THERE IS ONLY TOTAL EXISTENCE,
TOTAL CACOPHONY,

682
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,907
A TOTAL FLOWING OF HUMAN
ETHNICITIES AND TRIBES AND BEINGS...

683
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,110
AND GRADATIONS OF AWARENESS
AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND CRUISING.

684
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,245
AND--

685
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,449
THIS WOMAN TURNS TO ME. SHE GOES,
"I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT".

686
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:23,253
SHE GOES, "I CAN'T IMAGINE IT.
EVERYONE LIKES THE GRID PLAN".

687
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,389
OF COURSE,
THE QUESTION IS,

688
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,592
"WHO IS EVERYONE?"
IT'S JUST WHAT I HAD SAID.

689
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,261
WHOEVER THAT IS
UNDER THE WHITE COMFORTER,

690
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,999
CUDDLED UP WITH 34th STREET
AND BROADWAY,

691
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,668
EXISTING ON THE CONCRETE
OF THIS CITY,

692
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,039
HUNGRY AND DISHEVELLED,

693
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,840
STRUGGLING TO CRAWL
THEIR WAY ONTO THIS ISLAND...

694
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,608
WITH ALL OF THEIR MACHINATED
RAGES AND HELLISHNESS...

695
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,277
AND SELF-ORCHESTRATED
PURGATORIES--

696
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,947
I MEAN, WHAT DOES THAT PERSON
THINK ABOUT THE GRID PLAN?

697
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:53,684
PROBABLY MUCH MORE ON MY PLANE
OF THINKING, MY GRADATION OF BEING,

698
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,353
WHICH IS, LET'S JUST
BLOW UP THE GRID PLAN...

699
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,457
AND REWRITE THE STREETS TO BE...

700
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:01,158
MUCH MORE A SELF-PORTRAITURE
OF OUR PERSONAL STRUGGLES,

701
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:05,428
RATHER THAN SOME REAL ESTATE
BROKER'S WET DREAM FROM 1807.

702
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,098
WE'RE FORCED TO WALK
IN THESE RIGHT ANGLES.

703
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,233
DOESN'T SHE FIND IT
INFURIATING?

704
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,903
BY BEING SO COMPLETELY
ALLEGIANT TO THE GRID PLAN--

705
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,207
I THINK MOST NOTEWORTHY
IS THIS IDIOM:

706
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,708
"I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
CHANGING THE GRID PLAN".

707
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,911
SHE'S REALLY, UH,
ALIGNING HERSELF...

708
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,046
WITH THIS CIVILIZATION.

709
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,716
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "I CAN'T IMAGINE
ALTERING THIS CIVILIZATION.

710
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:29,986
"I CAN'T IMAGINE ALTERING
THIS MEEK AND LYING MORALITY...

711
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,656
"THAT RULES OUR LIVES.

712
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,693
"CAN'T IMAGINE STANDING UP ON A
CHAIR IN THE ROOM...

713
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:36,394
"TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVE.

714
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:40,130
"I CAN'T IMAGINE CHANGING
MY MIND ON ANYTHING.

715
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,867
"I, IN THE END, CAN'T IMAGINE
HAVING MY OWN IDENTITY...

716
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,071
THAT CONTRADICTS
OTHER IDENTITIES".

717
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,274
WHEN SHE SAYS TO ME,
AFTER MY STATEMENTS,

718
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,875
"EVERYONE LIKES
THE GRID PLAN,"

719
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,078
ISN'T SHE AUTOMATICALLY
EXCLUDING MYSELF FROM "EVERYONE"?

720
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,214
HOW COULD YOU NOT LIKE
THE GRID PLAN?

721
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,815
IT'S SO FUNCTIONAL.

722
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,485
YOU TAKE A RIGHT TURN,
A RIGHT TURN, A RIGHT TURN.

723
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,688
THERE'S A RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT,
YELLOW LIGHT. IT'S SO SYMMETRICAL.

724
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,493
BY SAYING THAT EVERYONE
LIKES THE GRID PLAN,

725
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:14,297
YOU'RE SAYING, "I'M GOING TO RELIVE
ALL THE MISTAKES MY PARENTS MADE.

726
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:17,501
"I'M GOING TO IDENTIFY
AND RELIVE ALL THE SORROWS...

727
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,170
"MY MOTHER EVER
LIVED THROUGH.

728
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,839
"I WILL PROPAGATE AND CREATE
DYSFUNCTIONAL CHILDREN...

729
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,043
"IN THE SAME DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY
THAT I WAS RAISED.

730
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,780
"I WILL SPREAD NEUROSIS
THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE...

731
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:29,681
"AND DO MY BEST...

732
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,517
"TO RECREATE MYSELF
AND THE DAMAGES OF MY LIFE...

733
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,720
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION".

734
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,864
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL MAPS
OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN,

735
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,999
EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THIS CENTURY,

736
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:52,202
MADISON AVENUE,
IN FRONT OF YOU, IN BACK OF YOU,

737
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,803
IS NOT EVEN ON THE MAP.

738
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,641
THIS BEGINS AS A SERVICE ROAD
FOR FIFTH AVENUE,

739
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:57,442
ONE BLOCK TO THE WEST.

740
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,311
FIFTH AVENUE IS
"MILLIONAIRE'S ROW,"

741
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:01,812
A SYSTEM OF
ARISTOCRATIC MANSIONS.

742
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,947
THIS IS WHERE
THE HORSE STABLES ARE.

743
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:08,218
THIS IS WHERE THE GARDENERS'
SHACKS ARE, NOT THAT LONG AGO.

744
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:11,421
MADISON AVENUE,
NOT EVEN A BOULEVARD...

745
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,557
UNTIL THE AUTOMOBILE
TAKES OVER THE ISLAND.

746
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,226
WILL YOU LOOK AT IT TODAY.

747
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,895
MAY I RESTATE, RECAPITULATE...

748
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,565
AND GENERALLY REGURGITATE,

749
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,234
WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN THE
MIDDLE OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN,

750
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,437
YOU ARE SITTING AMONGST
A 20th-CENTURY INVENTION,

751
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,709
A CITY THAT GREW UP
AT AN EXPLOSION, AS AN EXPLOSION.

752
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:34,378
IT IS AN EXPLOSION,
AN EXPERIMENT,

753
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,581
A SYSTEM OF TEST TUBES GURGLING,
BOILING OUT OF CONTROL,

754
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,784
A RADIOACTIVE ATOM
SWIRLING.

755
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:45,054
CIVILIZATION HAS NEVER
LOOKED LIKE THIS BEFORE.

756
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,190
THIS IS LUDICROUSNESS,

757
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:50,394
AND THIS CANNOT LAST.

758
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,198
THE NEW ANN TAYLOR STORE
ON THE RIGHT.

759
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:07,477
YESTERDAY GRAY LINE
FINALLY ENFORCED THEIR, UH,

760
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:12,282
UM, OBLIGATORY
UNIFORM POLICY.

761
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,417
IT'S A NEW POLICY.

762
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,621
WE HAVE TO--
ALL THE TOUR GUIDES HAVE TO WEAR...

763
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,824
GRAY LINE
BRIGHT RED SHIRTS.

764
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:24,027
AND CERTAINLY MY ILLNESS,
I THINK, IS ASSOCIATED...

765
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,697
WITH THIS LATEST
LEGISLATION.

766
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,969
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT I CAME...

767
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,470
TO THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS
FOR EMPLOYMENT...

768
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,238
FOR ONE REASON
AND ONE ESSENTIAL REASON ONLY,

769
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,908
AND THAT WAS TO, UH,
MEET WOMEN,

770
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,945
TO MEET AND SEDUCE WOMEN...

771
00:44:39,946 --> 00:44:41,546
FROM EVERY HABITABLE
CONTINENT IN THE WORLD.

772
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,082
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE.

773
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,283
I'M CERTAINLY NOT
HERE FOR THE MONEY.

774
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:48,585
AND, UM, THEY'RE JUST
LITERALLY BLOWING MY SHTICK.

775
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,488
I SAID TO GEORGE YESTERDAY,

776
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:51,789
BECAUSE
THE DISPATCHERS BASICALLY SAID,

777
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:55,526
"IF YOU DON'T PUT ON THAT SHIRT,
WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU HOME EARLY".

778
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,195
IT CAN LEAD
TO MY TERMINATION.

779
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,330
THAT'S HOW SERIOUS
THEY ARE ABOUT THIS.

780
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,465
I SAID, "AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,

781
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,669
"THE OFFICIAL GRAY LINE POLICY
AT THIS POINT IS, YOU KNOW,

782
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,338
"'SPEED, YOU ARE NOT GONNA
GET LAID ON OUR BUSES.

783
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,473
WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE'."

784
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,044
THEY'RE GONNA
MAKE ME PULL A SHTICK...

785
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:14,745
THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS PULLIN',
AND IT'S TERRIBLE.

786
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,083
AND, UH, REALLY,

787
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,587
MOSTLY IT'S JUST THE REGIME
SENDING OUT A MESSAGE...

788
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:24,888
THAT I'M ENTIRELY REPLACEABLE.

789
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,258
IT'S THEM SAYING,

790
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:29,159
"WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR TOUR.
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

791
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,362
"YOU WEAR THIS SHIRT, AND IF
YOU DON'T CONFORM, YOU'RE OUT,

792
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,497
'CAUSE WE CAN REPLACE YOU".

793
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,701
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS CITY
RIGHT NOW IS SEVEN PERCENT.

794
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,275
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IN FRONT OF US.

795
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,944
"ANTI,"
AS OPPOSED TO "CRUISE".

796
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,681
THIS IS AN ELEMENTARY AND VERY
PHYSICAL EXAMPLE OF ANTI-CRUISE,

797
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,118
WHERE OUR IMMOBILITY...

798
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,319
IS CREATED BY LITERALLY
JUST A BLOCKADE OF THE SIDEWALK.

799
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,553
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IS EVERYWHERE.

800
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:34,825
EVERY GOOD DAY OF MY LIFE
IS A DAY I EVADE THE ANTI-CRUISE.

801
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,595
PLEASE KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN,

802
00:46:36,596 --> 00:46:39,096
'CAUSE I DO SENSE A LOT OF THAT
NEGATIVE FODDER IN THE AIR.

803
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,099
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

804
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,200
BUT THIS IS A VERY
ECLECTIC AND DANGEROUS AFTERNOON.

805
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:46,036
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IS CERTAINLY MOBILIZED TODAY.

806
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:52,976
ON OUR LEFT WILL BE
THE CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE,

807
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,111
CAPITAL OF INCARCERATION.

808
00:46:56,713 --> 00:47:00,983
INCARCERATION, ANOTHER BASIC
ASPECT OF OUR DAILY LIVES,

809
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,721
UTILIZED
IN AN UNORIGINAL WAY...

810
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,390
IN THE CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE
ON OUR LEFT.

811
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,594
AND I CAN PERSONALLY
VOUCH FOR THAT.

812
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:27,678
THE ANTI-CRUISE IS AN ATTEMPT
TO IMPRISON US.

813
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,881
AT EVERY LEVEL OF LIVING,
IT EXISTS.

814
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:35,151
YOUNGER CRUISERS
HAVE ASKED ME, "WHY?

815
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:39,956
"WHY IS THE ANTI-CRUISE
SO AVARICIOUS AND CONSTANT...

816
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,159
IN ITS ATTEMPT
TO STOP THE CRUISE?"

817
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,829
AND I HAVE NO ANSWER.
THERE IS NO ANSWER.

818
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,498
I MEAN,
IT'S GRAVITATIONAL.

819
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,701
IT'S A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S
MADE UP OF RECIPROCALS...

820
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,371
AND OF PULLING GRAVITIES.

821
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,506
IT SIMPLY EXISTS.

822
00:47:56,506 --> 00:48:00,776
WHERE THERE IS CRUISE,
THERE IS AN ESCORT OF ANTI-CRUISE.

823
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,980
BUT EVEN IN A COMPLETE BASTION...

824
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,116
OF ANTI-CRUISE FODDER,

825
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:09,853
WHICH THIS ENTIRE
SQUARE BLOCK IS,

826
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,988
THERE IS CRUISE.

827
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,726
SOMEWHERE IN THERE IS
A SPARKLE OF CRUISING ENERGY...

828
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,530
DEEPLY SUBLIMATED WITHIN THE
BELLOWING BELLY OF THE BEAST.

829
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,403
SURVIVOR.

830
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,538
HE KNOWS NO PRISON.

831
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,008
THEY WERE ALL OVER
THE PRISON FLOOR,

832
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:32,809
BUT YOU NEVER SAW THEM
LOOKING MELANCHOLY.

833
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,111
THEY KEPT CRUISIN'.

834
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,681
NO IMPRISONMENT
FOR THE COCKROACH.

835
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:41,885
LIFE-IMPENDING
DRASTIC SURVIVOR.

836
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,554
THROUGH THE MILLENNIAS,
THROUGH THE ERUPTIONS OF TIME,

837
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,524
PAST THE DINOSAURS,

838
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:48,825
WITNESSING THE FLIGHT
OF BIRDS FOR THE FIRST TIME,

839
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,028
CLOUDS DYING,
ASTEROIDS HITTING THE EARTH.

840
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,698
NO PRISON FOR THE COCKROACH.

841
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:58,968
I HAVE SUCH RESPECT
FOR THOSE BASTARDS.

842
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,104
BUT I WAS NOT SO FORTUNATE.

843
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,641
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS
CRUISING HARD AT THAT TIME,

844
00:49:03,642 --> 00:49:04,742
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT--

845
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,976
THE ANTI-CRUISE REALLY
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK...

846
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,714
COULD NOT ALLOW ME
EVEN PHYSICAL MOBILITY.

847
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,417
I WAS-- ACCORDING TO THEM,

848
00:49:12,418 --> 00:49:13,818
I WAS RUNNING FROM
THE COPS FOR A MONTH...

849
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,518
BEFORE THEY CAUGHT UP TO ME.

850
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,090
I WAS NOT EVEN AWARE
THAT I WAS RUNNING FROM THE COPS...

851
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:19,691
AS MUCH AS FROM THE ANTI-CRUISE.

852
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,459
I FELT LIKE A FUGITIVE,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

853
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,594
EVERY DAY I FEEL
LIKE A FUGITIVE.

854
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:25,631
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THEM...

855
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:28,332
THAT I'M RUNNING
FROM THE ANTI-CRUISE EVERY DAY.

856
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:31,001
WHEN I WAS UP IN FRONT OF THE
JUDGE FOR MY ARRAIGNMENT,

857
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:32,004
THE JUDGE SAID,

858
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:34,205
"MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH
THIS CASE IS THAT THIS GUY--

859
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,407
"THIS CURRENT PERSON
WE'RE JUDGING--

860
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:40,076
RAN FROM THE POLICE
FOR A MONTH".

861
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:43,280
IF I COULD HAVE SPOKEN-- OF COURSE,
I WASN'T ALLOWED TO SPEAK--

862
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,483
I WOULD HAVE SAID,
"IT'S BEEN A LOT MORE THAN A MONTH.

863
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,152
"I'VE BEEN RUNNING
FROM YOU PEOPLE ALL MY LIFE.

864
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,821
ALL MY LIFE.
AND I'M GONNA KEEP RUNNING".

865
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,562
THERE ARE SO MANY PRISONERS,

866
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:58,663
INMATES, SO MANY
PEOPLE TO BE JUDGED,

867
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,897
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO
CONSIDER YOU AS A HUMAN BEING.

868
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:04,100
YOU'RE FILED THROUGH
AS IN AN ASSEMBLY LINE.

869
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,071
IN SOME WAYS,

870
00:50:05,072 --> 00:50:08,372
IT MADE ME THINK OF THE FACT THAT
IN TERMS OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,

871
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:11,041
WE HAVE THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE
AS PLANTS.

872
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,044
SO THIS ENTIRE
NOTION OF INDIVIDUALITY...

873
00:50:13,045 --> 00:50:14,145
IS A DELUSION ANYWAY.

874
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,379
IT IS A DIREFUL DELUSION.

875
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,583
THERE IS NO REAL INDIVIDUALITY
EXCEPT FOR THAT WHICH WE PROJECT.

876
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,087
BUT SITTING IN THE CELL BLOCK,

877
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:24,388
I REALIZED THAT THE PURSUIT OF
THAT SO-CALLED INDIVIDUALITY...

878
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:27,591
IS EVERYTHING I BELIEVE IN.

879
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,062
THE FULLEST PURSUIT OF THOSE...

880
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:31,863
POSSIBILITIES OF THAT
"INDIVIDUALITY,"

881
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,997
EVEN IF IT IS
AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE,

882
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:37,200
IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
FAILURE I CAN THINK OF.

883
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,005
<i>I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S A DELUSION.

884
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:45,742
<i>I DON'T CARE IF WE HAVE
THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE AS PLANTS.

885
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,945
<i>I WANT TO BE THE PLANT
THAT GROWS THE HIGHEST.

886
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,080
<i>I WANT TO BE THE BEAN STALK.

887
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:55,885
<i>I WANT TO BE THE FLOWER...

888
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,089
<i>THAT SMELLS MOST PROFUSELY,

889
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:02,826
<i>THAT VEERS MOST DRASTICALLY
TOWARDS THE SUNLIGHT.

890
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,902
LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL
LEAVES, FOR GOD'S SAKES.

891
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,782
YOU SEE THAT?
SEE HOW STUBBORN THIS LEAF IS?

892
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:28,019
I'M TRYING TO PICK IT UP, LIKE LOOK,

893
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,420
PICK UP THE SPIRIT.
LIKE PICK IT UP NOW.

894
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,256
LET'S GET SOME EXPANSION.
LET'S GET SOME ERECTION GOIN'.

895
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,993
HE'S LIKE, "I'M FLACCID. I'M NOT
MOVIN'. I'M NOT DOIN' IT TODAY".

896
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,662
COME ON, IT'S WEST 67th STREET.
IT'S SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

897
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,332
IT'S AUGUST. DO THIS.
"NO, NO, NO".

898
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:46,069
COME ON, GET IT UP.
"NO, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TODAY".

899
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,670
COME ON NOW!

900
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,874
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
HE'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

901
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,009
DIFFERENT COLOR,
DIFFERENT ATTITUDE.

902
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,610
LOOK AT THAT STYLE.

903
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,814
AND THEY MOVE WITH YOU.
THEY'VE GOT SUCH MOBILITY THERE.

904
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,687
THIS GUY'S LIKE STREAMLINED,
LIKE SEXY.

905
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:06,890
SO SEXY.
LOOK AT THOSE LINES.

906
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,025
AN AIRPLANE.

907
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,431
BEAUTIFUL.

908
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:23,973
<i>GOTTA RISE.

909
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:29,312
RISE.
RISE TO THE OCCASION.

910
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,785
THESE PEOPLE ARE
ON THE 12:00 DOWN,

911
00:52:33,786 --> 00:52:35,186
AND THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE IT TO ME.

912
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,456
THE 12:00 DOWN ON THIS PARTICULAR
DAY WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

913
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,193
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE
UNDERSTANDING THAT RIGHT NOW.

914
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:43,194
LOOK AT THIS.

915
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,599
RISE.

916
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,734
GO FOR IT.

917
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:55,472
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.
GOOD-BYE.

918
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,607
GOOD LUCK.

919
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:43,846
<i>I THINK THAT MY FAVORITE VICTORY
IS THE ABILITY TO FEEL.

920
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:47,050
<i>SUCH INSINCERITY--
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

921
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,320
<i>IF THE CRUISE IS ANYTHING,
BE IT APPRECIATION, BE IT A VOYAGE,

922
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,990
<i>BE IT AN ADVENTURE
THAT LEADS BACK TO OURSELVES,

923
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,125
<i>BE IT A CARTWHEEL
OR A SOMERSAULT--

924
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,863
<i>IF YOU FIND THE CRUISE IN A PIECE
OF CARROT CAKE, A TOPLESS BAR,

925
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,600
<i>THE ONE THING THE CRUISE
ALWAYS IS, I THINK, IS SINCERE.

926
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,404
<i>AND SINCERITY IS ONE OF MY
FAVORITE VICTORIES IN THIS LIFETIME.

927
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,608
I MEAN, HOW MUCH REBELLION
DID I HAVE TO EXPERIENCE?

928
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,209
HOW MUCH FIGHTING DID I DO?

929
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,480
HOW MANY TIMES DID
I HAVE TO IGNORE...

930
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:17,381
MY FATHER'S INABILITY TO EMOTE?

931
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,217
HOW WE ALL IGNORE OUR FATHERS'
INABILITY TO EMOTE IN OUR PRESENCE.

932
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,886
HOW MUCH AIR-CONDITIONING
DID I HAVE TO TRANSCEND...

933
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,556
AND THE COMFORT
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT?

934
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,225
THE COMFORTABLE COUCHES,
THE TELEVISION,

935
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,428
THE MAGNITUDE OF STATIC
THAT SURROUNDS US.

936
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:37,232
HOW MUCH DAILY INFIGHTING,
STRATEGIZING, EVADING, RUNNING...

937
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,436
DID I HAVE TO DO
FOR THE ABILITY TO FEEL,

938
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,572
FOR THE ABILITY TO EMOTE,

939
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:47,376
FOR THE SIMPLE MOMENTS
WHEN I FEEL ACTUAL PASSION?

940
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:57,520
HELLO, EVERYONE.
CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THE BACK?

941
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,655
WELCOME TO NEW YORK CITY.

942
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,360
H.G. WELLS ONCE WROTE
THAT TO TELL

943
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,461
THE SOCIAL HISTORY
OF NEW YORK CITY...

944
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:09,265
IS TO TELL THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD, THE STORY OF THE WORLD.

945
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:12,468
IT'S GOING TO BE
A LONG MORNING.

946
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:26,882
<i>TO ALL MY ENEMIES
WHO ADD FLAVOR TO MY LIFE,

947
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,220
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...

948
00:56:29,221 --> 00:56:30,521
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT?

949
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,890
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
AND TALK TO ME ABOUT IT?

950
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,492
TO LESLIE LINDENSTRAUS:

951
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:40,763
LOOK, IF YOU WANNA TRY TO CHOKE
ME WHEN I'M, LIKE, PREPUBESCENT...

952
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,899
AND REALLY MUCH SMALLER
THAN YOU, THAT'S FINE.

953
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:46,102
I KNOW THAT'S HOW WE ALL
REALLY FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER,

954
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:48,237
AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT
IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT.

955
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,242
BUT I'M GONNA FIND YOU AND KICK
YOUR ASS 'CAUSE I'M NOT SEVEN...

956
00:56:51,243 --> 00:56:52,943
AND PREPUBESCENT ANYMORE.

957
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:56,779
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE,
BUT I REMEMBER THAT DAY.

958
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,381
TO JORDAN:

959
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,352
LOOK, BANANAS MAY BE SOMETHING...

960
00:57:00,353 --> 00:57:02,553
THAT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
CAN EAT WITHOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?

961
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:05,855
YES, I WANTED A BANANA
AND YES, YOU LEFT ME OUT.

962
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:09,058
BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE
THERE ARE OTHER BANANAS.

963
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,193
I THINK I PROVED THAT
TO YOU BY NOW.

964
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,329
<i>TO TIRZAH:</i>

965
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:17,599
THERE WAS ABOUT TWO HOURS OF
MY ENTIRE LIFE THUS FAR ON EARTH...

966
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,269
WHEN I WAS ABSOLUTELY
DEPENDENT UPON YOU.

967
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:25,074
AND THOSE WERE A COUPLE
OF THE WORST HOURS OF MY LIFE.

968
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:29,344
TO CHARLES PURPURRA: I KNOW
YOU NEVER READ MY SCREENPLAY.

969
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:33,082
AND TO LESLIE LEE: I KNOW YOU
DIDN'T READ THAT FULL-LENGTH PLAY.

970
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:36,285
I WORKED ON IT. I SWEATED
ON IT. I TURMOILED OVER IT.

971
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,887
I MALAISED THROUGH IT.

972
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,624
I LIVED ABOVE IT, UNDER IT,
BECAUSE OF IT, NOT BECAUSE OF IT.

973
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,225
I HATED IT. I LOVED IT.

974
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:46,963
I DIED AND I WAS REBORN WITHIN THE
ROOM AS I WORKED ON THAT PLAY,

975
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:50,166
AND I KNOW
YOU DID NOT READ IT.

976
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,637
TO SWAYNE,

977
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:54,338
WHO SUPPOSEDLY WAS GOING
TO READ THAT SCRIPT I GAVE HIM.

978
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,572
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
FUCK THE SCRIPT.

979
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,076
YOU ARE FOREVER KNOWN
AS THE TOUR GUIDE...

980
00:57:58,077 --> 00:57:59,677
WHO GOT HIT BY A TRAFFIC LIGHT.

981
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,445
AND I THINK THAT'S
THE PROPER EPITHET FOR YOU.

982
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,016
AND HOW DARE YOU
DO A TINA HOWE PLAY...

983
00:58:05,017 --> 00:58:06,617
IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE
IN NEW YORK CITY,

984
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:09,919
AS IF I HAVE TIME TO SIT THERE
AND LISTEN TO THAT TRASH...

985
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,588
WHEN THERE IS SHTICKING
AND CRUISING TO BE DONE.

986
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:15,792
YOU OBVIOUSLY LEAD
AN "INFINTESTIMIAL" EXISTENCE.

987
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,927
TO JOSH:

988
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:20,596
YOUR NARCISSISM...

989
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,799
IS MEDIOCRE.

990
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,469
NARCISSISM IN SOME WAYS
IS INEVITABLE.

991
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:30,206
I MEAN, SINCE WE'RE ALL LIVING IN
THE SAME BODIES FOR THIS MORTALITY,

992
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,609
IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE
THAT WE WILL BE...

993
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,310
SELF-ABSORBED AT SOME POINT.

994
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:36,078
BUT WHY IS IT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE
HAVE A NARCISSISM AS YOURSELF...

995
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,282
THAT LEADS TO MEDIOCRITY
AND NOTHING ELSE?

996
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,951
<i>TO JEN AND MICHELLE:</i>

997
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:44,620
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ORGY.

998
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,058
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT
CAME DOWN TO A DOUBLE DATE...

999
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:48,759
WITH ME AS A FIFTH WHEEL.

1000
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,496
THAT SUCKS. I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A SITUATION WHERE I'VE BEEN...

1001
00:58:52,497 --> 00:58:53,597
SO SEVERELY DISSED.

1002
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,734
I MEAN, AN ORGY IS WHEN
EVERYBODY PARTICIPATES,

1003
00:58:56,735 --> 00:58:59,035
NOT FOUR OUT OF FIVE IN THE ROOM.

1004
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,238
TO RAELLE:

1005
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:07,576
I AM NOT GOING TO GO
TO SOME SINGLE JEWISH PARTY...

1006
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,246
BECAUSE I'M A DISHEVELLED
WRECK OF A SHTICKER...

1007
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,915
TO TRY TO MEET
SOME LONG ISLAND JEWESS...

1008
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:16,119
AND LAND ON A FRONT YARD
IN A HOUSE WITH TWO CARS...

1009
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,056
AND CHILDREN WHO
BAWL MY NAME...

1010
00:59:18,057 --> 00:59:19,757
THROUGH THEIR OWN
SALIVARY GLANDS.

1011
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,593
THAT MAY BE YOUR APPROXIMATE
GOAL, BUT THAT IS NOT MINE.

1012
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:26,796
I AM SURPRISED
BY YOUR UNORIGINALITY,

1013
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:30,533
AND I AM TIRED
OF YOUR SILLY EMASCULATIONS.

1014
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,670
I WOULD PREFER TO BE
EMASCULATED BY A WOMAN...

1015
00:59:32,671 --> 00:59:34,171
WITH MUCH MORE SEVERITY...

1016
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,939
AND WITH A LITTLE BIT
MORE BACKBONE.

1017
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,142
TO MEM LEVITCH:

1018
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,812
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?

1019
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:46,015
I'M TRYING TO LEAD SOMETHING
OF A YOUTHFUL EXISTENCE HERE.

1020
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,684
I'M STANDING HERE
ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE TODAY...

1021
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,689
TALKING TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...

1022
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,390
ABOUT THE MINUSCULE
MOMENTS OF ALIENATION...

1023
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:56,692
THAT I REMEMBER SO WELL
OVER THE LAST QUARTER CENTURY,

1024
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:59,362
AND ALL YOU CAN DO
IS LEAVE MESSAGES ON MY MACHINE...

1025
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,665
AND LECTURE ME ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU NEED ME...

1026
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:02,466
UP THERE IN WESTCHESTER.

1027
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:06,302
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
CHECK THE AIR IN YOUR TIRES?

1028
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:10,039
YOU NEVER ONCE VAULTED
OUT OF THE GOLDEN CHAIR.

1029
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,643
YOU NEVER HAD THE GUTS,
THE AUDACITY,

1030
01:00:12,644 --> 01:00:14,844
TO STAND UP AND DO
SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE.

1031
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:17,514
YOU COULD ONLY UTILIZE
YOUR OWN NARCISSISMS...

1032
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:19,115
AND YOUR OWN SELF-ABSORPTION...

1033
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:22,085
TO ALWAYS, IN A TONAL SENSE,
IMPLY TO ME, YOUR CHILD,

1034
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,386
THAT I HAD TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

1035
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,657
AND THIS HAS BEEN A DAILY CRUSADE
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF MY BIRTH.

1036
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,792
AND WHEN I EMANATED
FROM YOUR BLOODY THIGHS,

1037
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:34,063
IF I'D KNOWN ALL THIS, I'M SURE
I WOULD HAVE CRAWLED BACK IN.

1038
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:37,033
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT
ALL THE MENSTRUATION...

1039
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:38,334
THAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT...

1040
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:42,071
WAS PARTS OF MYSELF LEFT BEHIND
THAT YOU WERE CHOKING TO DEATH?

1041
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,206
THAT WAS MY BLOOD!

PEOPLE CONSTANTLY JUMPING OFF THE

THE CIRCLE.

1072
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,793
WHEN YOU CROSS THE STREET
CALLED HOUSTON STREET,

1073
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:46,462
YOU ENTER THE DISTRICT
CALLED SOHO,

1074
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:49,131
WHICH STANDS
FOR "SOUTH OF HOUSTON".

1075
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:51,267
AND AS WE
ENTER SOHO TODAY,

1076
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,205
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT...

1077
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:56,606
TO DEDICATE THIS CRUISE
AND THIS ENTRANCE INTO SOHO...

1078
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,809
TO OUR DRIVER AND NAVIGATOR
DOWNSTAIRS, BENITEZ.

1079
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,944
IN A CERTAIN PERSONAL
DESPAIR TODAY,

1080
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,014
I WANT HIM TO KNOW
THAT I AM WITH HIM,

1081
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:06,215
AND I'M BACKING HIM UP ALL THE WAY.

1082
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,350
WE'VE DONE
MANY CIRCLES TOGETHER,

1083
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:12,088
AND TOGETHER
WE'VE SUFFERED, AS WE ENTER SOHO.

1084
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:16,358
WE'RE CROSSING HOUSTON STREET
RIGHT NOW. CAN YOU FEEL IT?

1085
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:19,028
BENITEZ,
CAN YOU FEEL IT?

1086
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:21,697
WE'RE ENTERING SOHO.

1087
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:43,051
I WROTE JON A LETTER ABOUT
THE, UH, LAMED VOVNIKS.

1088
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:45,721
UM--

1089
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:49,458
THE, UH-- FROM
THE ANCIENT CABALA.

1090
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:52,661
THIRTY-SIX, UH, IN HEBREW--
LAMED VOVNIK.

1091
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,797
I BELIEVE IT MEANS 36.

1092
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,101
AND, ESSENTIALLY,

1093
01:03:56,102 --> 01:03:59,602
IT DISCUSSES HOW THERE ARE 36
HUMAN BEINGS ON THE PLANET...

1094
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:02,271
AT ALL TIMES-- ONLY 36--

1095
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:06,008
WHO, UH, UPHOLD AND
CREATE THE EQUILIBRIUM...

1096
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,677
FOR ALL OF OUR SUFFERINGS.

1097
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:12,948
THEY TAKE THE MALAISE AND
THE MAELSTROM OF PERSECUTIONS...

1098
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:16,153
AND THE DISASTERS OF THE WORLD
ONTO THEIR OWN SHOULDERS,

1099
01:04:16,154 --> 01:04:17,654
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE,

1100
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:21,490
THROUGHOUT THEIR
FLESH-PHYSICAL-INCARNATED LIVES.

1101
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,159
AND WITHOUT THESE 36 PEOPLE,

1102
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,829
THE INFRASTRUCTURE
OF THE WORLD WOULD FALL APART...

1103
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:30,566
AND THERE WOULD BE ARMAGEDDON
AND PERHAPS THE FINAL JUDGMENT,

1104
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:34,303
BUT NOT A PRETTY JUDGMENT,
BY ANY MEANS.

1105
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,904
FINAL BUT NOT PRETTY.

1106
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,709
MOST OF THE VOVNIKS
DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY'RE VOVNIKS.

1107
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,913
THEY SUFFER
IN AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE HELL,

1108
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:47,116
AND THEY SWIM IN AN ENTIRE
WHIRLPOOL OF HUMILITY...

1109
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,319
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THEMSELVES OR WHO THEY ARE...

1110
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,454
OR THEIR IMPORTANCE
IN THE WORLD.

1111
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:55,124
AND THE VOVNIK MORDECAI,

1112
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:58,861
WHO LEFT THE LARGE FAMILY
OF THE LEVIS...

1113
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:04,733
TO MOVE TO MIERDZBERGZST
ON THE ROCKY GLACIERS OF SILESIA,

1114
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,869
UH, IN THE 17th CENTURY,

1115
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:10,606
WHERE THE BAAL SHEM TOV
HAD SET UP CRUISING HEADQUARTERS...

1116
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:15,410
AND INSTITUTED THE BEGINNINGS OF
THE HASIDIM, HASIDIC RELIGION.

1117
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,546
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV,
THE ENLIGHTENED RABBI,

1118
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:22,350
PREACHING THE CARNIVOROUSNESS
AND THE RELIGIOSITY IN JOY...

1119
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,486
AND THE ECSTASY OF PRAYER.

1120
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:28,224
I MEAN, THE HASIDS ARE NO LONGER
GOING TO SIT WITH PRAYER BOOKS,

1121
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,893
YOU KNOW, SILENTLY PRAYING
IN DARKENED SYNAGOGUES.

1122
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:33,562
THEY ARE GOING
TO JUMP AROUND THE ROOM.

1123
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,532
THEY ARE GOING TO SCREAM
AND YELL THEIR LOVE FOR GOD.

1124
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:37,833
THEY'RE GOING TO DO CARTWHEELS.

1125
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:41,570
AND MORDECAI WENT THERE
TO HELP CLEAN OUT OUTHOUSES.

1126
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,239
BASICALLY, HE WAS A PEASANT
LIVING IN THE TOWN.

1127
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:49,044
DERELICTS AND BUMS AND GENIUSES
AND ARISTOCRATS AND POETS...

1128
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,714
AND MEN OF EVERY KIND
OF OCCUPATION AND PHYLUM...

1129
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:55,451
WERE GOING TO MIERDZBERGZST
ON THE ROCKY GLACIERS OF SILESIA...

1130
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,055
JUST TO HAVE THEIR OWN MOMENTS
WITH THE BAAL SHEM TOV,

1131
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:00,256
THIS ENLIGHTENED RABBI.

1132
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:02,660
AND MORDECAI REVERENTLY
STOOD IN THE SAME ROOM...

1133
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:05,061
WITH THE BAAL
SHEM TOV A FEW TIMES...

1134
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,730
AS HE WENT OFF
TO DO HIS DAILY TOIL.

1135
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,001
EVENTUALLY, THEY CALLED HIM
"THE DANCER OF GOD,"

1136
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,738
BECAUSE WHEN THE HASIDS WOULD
FORM FOR THEIR REELS OF DANCE...

1137
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:18,941
IN HONOR TO THEIR ECSTASY
TO THEIR GOD,

1138
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,645
MORDECAI WOULD JUMP SO HIGH...

1139
01:06:21,646 --> 01:06:23,746
AND WOULD DANCE
WITH SUCH AN EXUBERANCE,

1140
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:26,583
THE OTHER HASIDICS WERE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT HIM...

1141
01:06:26,584 --> 01:06:27,384
AND FOR HIM,

1142
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,152
AND HE WAS EXILED
FROM THE DANCE.

1143
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:33,889
AND SO HE APPEASED HIMSELF
BY DANCING ALONE AT NIGHT...

1144
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,558
IN THE SHED RESERVED
FOR THE SICK AND DYING,

1145
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,762
AND HE WOULD ENTERTAIN THEM
IN THE EVENINGS ALONE.

1146
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,100
SUDDENLY,

1147
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:45,101
THE GAON OF KIEV WHISPERS TO
THE BAAL SHEM TOV ONE DAY...

1148
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,770
THAT THERE IS A VOVNIK,

1149
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:51,507
UH, A HOLY, UH, MAN.

1150
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,642
THEY HAVE
ANOTHER TERM FOR IT.

1151
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:58,447
A MAN OF TOTAL EQUILIBRIUM,
A LAMED VOVNIK, IN TOWN.

1152
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,884
AND SO THEY START SEARCHING
FOR WHO THIS MIGHT BE.

1153
01:07:00,885 --> 01:07:02,085
THEY INTERVIEW THE DERELICTS.

1154
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,853
THEY INTERVIEW ALL THE PEASANTS.
THEY INTERVIEW THE HANDYMEN.

1155
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:08,057
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE GUYS WHO
HANG OUT WITH FARM ANIMALS,

1156
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,160
ANYBODY WHO MIGHT
BE MENTALLY RETARDED,

1157
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:11,161
AS MANY VOVNIKS
ARE MENTALLY RETARDED.

1158
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:14,463
SUDDENLY, THEY REALIZE THAT THE
GUY WHO CLEANS THE OUTHOUSES...

1159
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,598
DISAPPEARS THE NEXT MORNING.

1160
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,734
SUDDENLY,
RUMORS SPREAD AROUND.

1161
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:22,471
THEY SAY TO THE BAAL SHEM TOV, "HE
DANCED FOR THE SICK AT NIGHT ALONE.

1162
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:25,140
HE CLEANED THE OUTHOUSES
CONSCIENTIOUSLY".

1163
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:29,411
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV WOOED
THEM AWAY, PUSHED THEM AWAY,

1164
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:31,547
AND WAS CRYING.

1165
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,682
AND THERE WAS SILENCE.

1166
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,817
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV
SAID SIMPLY,

1167
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:40,089
"THAT ONE WAS HEALTHY
AMONGST THE SICK,

1168
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,758
AND I DID NOT SEE HIM".

1169
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:57,172
<i>- IS THAT OPEN?</i>
- YEAH. THANKS, LARRY.

1170
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,180
- HOW YA BEEN?
- ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?

1171
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:08,384
- HANGIN' IN THERE.
- I KNOW THAT FEELIN'.

1172
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,925
TODAY'S
MY LAST DAY, MAN. -REALLY?

1173
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:20,096
YEAH. I GOT THE JOB
WORKING WITH TRANSIT.

1174
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:21,197
ALL RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS.

1175
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:24,934
THANK YOU.
I START THAT TUESDAY. -ALL RIGHT.

1176
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,069
I WAS GONNA
COME IN MONDAY,

1177
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,272
BUT AFTER I HEARD
THE WEATHER REPORT, I SAID NO.

1178
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,941
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1179
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,079
I'VE PAID MY DUES.

1180
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,680
WELL, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY.
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF CIRCLES.

1181
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,216
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

1182
01:08:38,217 --> 01:08:40,317
I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT
THERE'S A FINISH LINE TO THIS.

1183
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:44,686
I FIND THAT--
I FIND THAT INTERESTING.

1184
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:47,890
THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF LOOKING AT IT,
MAN. -IT'S BEEN SO NICE TO KNOW YOU.

1185
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,559
- IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE.
- YEAH, IT'S BEEN A DAMN PLEASURE.

1186
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,160
- YEAH, BUT I'LL BE AROUND.
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

1187
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:55,032
PICK UP SOME EXTRA MONEY
FROM TIME TO TIME.

1188
01:08:55,033 --> 01:08:56,333
YEAH, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

1189
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:59,101
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO MUCH MONEY. -THAT'S RIGHT.

1190
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:03,905
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
AND KEEP IT ALIVE.

1191
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:09,244
244 EAST 49th STREET...

1192
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,515
WILL BE A QUIET,

1193
01:09:10,516 --> 01:09:13,516
BROWN ROW HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NEXT BLOCK ON YOUR LEFT,

1194
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:16,719
STILL CURRENTLY
THE NEW YORK CITY RESIDENCE...

1195
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,854
OF KATHARINE HEPBURN.

1196
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:22,591
GRETA GARBO AND BETTE DAVIS,
WHEN THEY WERE BOTH LIVING,

1197
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:26,861
ALSO HAD RESIDENCES
ON THIS NEXT BLOCK.

1198
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:32,200
WHEN THEY ASKED GRETA GARBO WHY
SHE CHOSE TO LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY,

1199
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:35,404
SHE SAID THAT NEW YORK
WAS THE ONLY PLACE...

1200
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:38,073
WHERE SHE COULD BE... ALONE.

1201
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:54,039
<i>I AM CRUISING CURRENTLY...

1202
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,344
<i>RIGHT NOW.

1203
01:11:56,345 --> 01:12:01,149
<i>I AM CRUISING BECAUSE
I HAVE DEDICATED MYSELF...

1204
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:05,420
<i>TO ALL THAT IS CREATIVE AND
DESTRUCTIVE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

1205
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:09,158
<i>AND I'M EQUALLY IN LOVE
WITH EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE...

1206
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:12,361
<i>AND ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT HAVE CAUSED ME TURMOIL...

1207
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:15,564
<i>AND ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT HAVE CAUSED ME GLORY.

1208
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:20,902
<i>I AM THE LIVING WHISPERED WARNING
IN THE ROMAN GENERAL'S EAR,

1209
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:23,572
<i>"GLORY IS FLEETING".

1210
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:27,309
<i>AND IN THAT VERB,
THAT ACTIVE VERB, "FLEETING,"

1211
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:30,512
<i>THERE I LIVE,
THERE I RESIDE IN THIS MOMENT.

1212
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:35,316
<i>I'VE DEDICATED MYSELF
TO THE IDIOM, "I DON'T KNOW".

1213
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:40,121
<i>AND I'M IN LOVE WITH THE FRANTIC
CHAOS OF THIS LIMITLESS UNIVERSE.

1214
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,907
I'VE FACED THIS BEFORE.

1215
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:37,245
THE SECOND TO LAST TIME
I TRIED IT, IT DIDN'T GO OFF,

1216
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,449
AND I FOUND MYSELF
OVERLOOKING 42nd STREET.

1217
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:44,719
I WAS, LIKE,
EXACTLY 45 FLOORS UP,

1218
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,389
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THE CHRYSLER BUILDING.

1219
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:49,524
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

1220
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:52,194
THE LAST TIME I TRIED IT,

1221
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:55,931
I STOOD ATOP
THE MARRIOTT MARQUIS HOTEL,

1222
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:58,600
THINKING THAT I HAD
SO GLORIOUSLY ONCE AGAIN EVADED...

1223
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,803
THE ANTI-CRUISE
FIRE EXIT SIGNALS...

1224
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:04,074
AND THEN WAS
SUDDENLY SURROUNDED...

1225
01:14:04,075 --> 01:14:05,975
BY TWO FIRE DEPARTMENTS PEOPLE,

1226
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,743
HEAD OF SECURITY.

1227
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,481
LECTURE, REPRIMAND.

1228
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:15,684
I BARELY GOT OUT
OF THERE ALIVE.

1229
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,955
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A KEY BEFORE, THOUGH.

1230
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:23,158
SEEMS TO ME
IT'S THE POTENTIAL OF TURNING IT OFF,

1231
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:26,361
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS ON AND WHAT IS OFF.
