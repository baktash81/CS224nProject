00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,480
NARRATOR: In ancient times
 there was one disease

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,550
feared above all
 others, leprosy.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,040
In the 19th century when
 the disease broke out

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,970
in the Hawaiian Islands
 governments panicked,

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,610
heads of state acted
 rashly, and cruelly.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,750
Any victim who showed
 signs of the disease

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,260
was uprooted from his home
 and sent to a remote island,

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,740
forced to live the rest of
 his life in total isolation.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,820
The lepers lived
 in fear and shame

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,270
without houses,
 crops, sanitation,

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,170
nor medical help of any kind.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,230
The island was nothing more than
 an inhumane prison that turned

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:56,150
lepers into animals
 struggling for survival.

14
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,530
Then a priest came to
 live among these people.

15
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,270
His name was Joseph Damian.

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,720
At first the lepers
 were suspicious.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,790
Who was this god he served?

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Damien began to work with the
 people then building houses

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,500
and improving their
 living conditions.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,090
He shamed the government into
 increasing the meager shipments

21
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,120
of food, clothing,
 and medical supplies.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,690
He set up a school to
 educate the children.

23
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:39,660
After 16 years of service Damien
 himself fell victim to leprosy,

24
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,950
but not before giving
 hope to these people

25
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,070
and bringing worldwide
 attention to their plite.

26
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,390
Our story, although fiction, is
 inspired by the works of Damien

27
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,520
and based on his
 successor to the island

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,900
a man whom we call
 Brother Dalton.

29
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,050
Almost at once Brother Dalton
 was confronted by the Kahuna,

30
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,630
once a spiritual
 leader who had lost

31
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,350
control when the lepers
 turned to Christian teachings.

32
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,830
In his bid to regain
 power the Kahuna

33
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,680
contended that
 leprosy was a curse

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,000
brought to Hawaii
 by the white man.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,110
And that if the whites
 were driven out the plague

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,770
would go with them.

37
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,410
The people listened, for the
 Kahuna emphasized his message

38
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,150
through what seemed to
 be supernatural feats.

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
It was during this
 time of tension

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,900
that two brothers tragically
 arrived on the island.
