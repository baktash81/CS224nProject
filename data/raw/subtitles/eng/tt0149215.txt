1
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,920
<i><u>The Swan Princess</u></i>

2
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,720
<i><u>Mistery of the Enchanted Kingdom</u></i>

3
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,320
Yeah!
I love my new home.

4
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,720
Love sitting in my favorite spot.

5
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,120
Down by the bubbling brook.

6
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,820
Sing it with me.

7
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,000
Eating lovely nuts...

8
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,060
You just stick in your beak
and crack it in two...

9
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,020
Sometimes it's hard cos the shells
are tough and I'm gonna give it up

10
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,620
Then chuck it in the bubbling brook.

11
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,380
What a place I found!
Not a care in the world!

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,340
It's a bird's dream, really.

13
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh great! It's over. No more
living a life variety for me.

14
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,080
I'm getting out of here.

15
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,760
Come on, legs,
don't fail me now!

16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,780
What am I running for? I should be
flying for crying out loud! I'm a bird!

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
Come on, men!
Pull!

18
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,700
Come on, let's see the spirit
of festival days!

19
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,680
<i>What a glorious day!</i>

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,760
<i>It's true when we say it
doesn't get any better than this...</i>

21
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,180
<i>All the best in the land  are here
showing their hand and we're sure</i>

22
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,820
<i>That the best is here.</i>

23
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,760
<i>We can dance like the wind...</i>

24
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,260
<i>Play a wizard's violin.</i>

25
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,060
<i>And do tricks of incredible risk...</i>

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,780
<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

27
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,880
It needs to come up just a little.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,060
That's perfect.

29
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,880
Hallelujah, Odette.

30
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,780
You brought culture and
refinement to the festival.

31
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,740
Now thinking men have an alternative
to that mindless obstacle course.

32
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,560
Well placed window!

33
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,080
<i>Judging horses and lambs,
unicorns, goats and rams.</i>

34
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,460
<i>And I hope it gets better than this...</i>

35
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:54,260
<i>Of all the grace in the kingdom I know that the queen will rise up to the top of the list...</i>

36
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,080
<i>Displays of wit and finesse
we have lacked, I confess.</i>

37
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,500
<i>But now, we have all that we missed.</i>

38
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,180
<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

39
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,980
<i>Derek's brought us peace and
set us solidly so we can sing now...</i>

40
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,940
<i>We're gonna save a life the way
a man and wife are supposed to do.</i>

41
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,100
<i>All the clouds have banished now that
fear is banished from the kingdom.</i>

42
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:34,180
<i>And so to celebrate we'll show
the world how great we are...</i>

43
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,060
<i>Hit the mark.</i>

44
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,960
<i>Ring the bell.</i>

45
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,140
<i>Kiss them all and live to tell.</i>

46
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,100
<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

47
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,740
<i>Also trumpets and troupers,
those lions and wild boars...</i>

48
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,241
<i>Once you taste them
you just can't resist.</i>

49
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,920
<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

50
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,540
<i>Daggers and dungeons,
dragons and wars...</i>

51
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,520
<i>Arrows and aligators fought us.</i>

52
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,140
<i>We've overcome every
possible foe...</i>

53
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,140
<i>What a bravery has brought us.</i>

54
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,940
<i>Now there's nothing that can
spoil the fun of festival days.</i>

55
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,600
You gotta try this, Brom.

56
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,760
Best obstacle course we've
ever had.

57
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,860
Not dangerous enough for
my taste..

58
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,160
I'll add a snake pit if you
promise to partake.

59
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,040
Well, I...

60
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,360
I'll take that as a yes.

61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,920
But Derek...

62
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,440
Come on, Brom...

63
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,920
Winner gets to be
prince for a day.

64
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:53,820
<i>Dealing with the danger all my life.
It's second nature to revel it.</i>

65
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:02,120
<i>But now, that the final victory is
ours, I think it's time we celebrate it.</i>

66
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,440
<i>Now there is nothing that can
spoil the fun of festival days.</i>

67
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,940
Get me out of here!

68
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,940
<i>Feed the crowd, shout horray...</i>

69
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,560
<i>as a crowned prince for a day.</i>

70
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,000
<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,040
<i>There is only one kingdom</i>

72
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,040
<i>where this kind of dream could
come true.</i>

73
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,520
<i>Throw your cares to the wind,
let the party begin.</i>

74
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,240
<i>It may be years till
we see something like this...</i>

75
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,720
<i>It doesn't get any better than...</i>

76
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,220
<i>Or any wetter than</i>

77
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,320
<i>This double head can see
anything better...</i>

78
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:58,760
<i>It doesn't get any better than this.</i>

79
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,840
My name is Zelda.

80
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm only going to tell you
this once, so listen carefully!

81
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,560
Yes, yes, of course.

82
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,760
Many years ago
after being banished

83
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,040
for developing the forbidden arts...

84
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,740
Rothbart came to the castle
at Swan Lake.

85
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,720
Vanquished and powerless he
lived in despair.

86
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,340
Until I found him.
I roused his spirit.

87
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,140
Inspired him to begin a new.

88
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,940
I awakened the sleeping evil
genius within.

89
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,140
And after years of work, the fruit
of our labor finally appeared.

90
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,860
Finally. The forbidden arts
are mine again.

91
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,040
Now we will rule as
king and queen.

92
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,940
Actually, I had a different plan.

93
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,040
I'm gonna force Odette
to marry me.

94
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,020
Of course, it cuts you out of plan.

95
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,760
You wouldn't have the forbidden
arts if it weren't for me.

96
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,240
True. And, yet, sadly
you're out of here.

97
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,040
Those notes belong to me just
as much as they belong to you.

98
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,760
More! And they
will be mine someday!

99
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,460
They will be mine!

100
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,900
Get out!

101
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,900
I have a feeling those notes
still exist.

102
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,540
And you're going to
help me get them.

103
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,860
Excuse me.
May I just mention

104
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,220
that I have absolutely no talent
for this particular kind of adventure.

105
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,420
On the contrary.

106
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,540
The yaki bird can imitate any
voice after hearing it only once.

107
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,920
Do mine!

108
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
But I don't think...

109
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,520
Do my voice!

110
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,320
Do it again!

111
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,340
Do it again!

112
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,520
Go to the castle at Swan Lake

113
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,860
and find out if those notes
still exist, my little spy.

114
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,160
Spy? No, see, spies
get captured and tortured.

115
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,900
I couldn't bear torture. I start
sobbing if I even get a canker sore.

116
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Stop whining.

117
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,760
As soon as you found out if the
notes exist, I promise to set you free.

118
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,460
Seek out Whizzer and
bring him to me.

119
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,420
My little seekers are a far
cry from the forbidden arts.

120
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,340
But they can find you
no matter where you go.

121
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,720
So don't ever try to run and
don't you ever betray me!

122
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,260
Now go find out
about those notes.

123
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,560
47, 48, 49, 50.

124
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,560
Look!

125
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,260
You mean those little bumps?

126
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,760
These little bumps are going to
help me win the obstacle course.

127
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,720
You're gonna enter the
obstacle course?

128
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,580
That's right, Mr. "inch-at-a-time"

129
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,680
And when I am
crowned prince for a day

130
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,640
Finally, the people will see me as
a prince forever.

131
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,240
If you don't mind, it's time
to work on my mental fitness.

132
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,740
You can say that again.

133
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,140
The next one who disturbs me
shall be punished by these babies.

134
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,360
Run away, run away!

135
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,360
Jean-Bob you know anything about Rothbart's notes being hidden in the castle?

136
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,060
Okay, that's it!

137
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:56,620
Every day, in every way,
I just get better and better. No?

138
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,720
It doesn't bother me, of course.

139
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,040
But some people think the
obstacle course is too dangerous.

140
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,600
Rothbart's notes on a
forbidden arts

141
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,540
were they hidden in the castle?

142
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,720
Who told you that?

143
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,540
Well, everybody's
talking about it.

144
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,740
Derek... something
horrible has happened.

145
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,560
You can tell me in front of Odette.

146
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,960
I'm not sure.

147
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,240
Rogers, we have no secrets.

148
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,140
Actually, you do have one secret.

149
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,320
Go on, Rogers.

150
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,180
Yeah, go on.

151
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,040
Well there's a rumor going
around about Rothbart's notes.

152
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,140
That they're being hidden in the castle.

153
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,840
That's ridiculous. If we knew those notes
existed they'd destroyed immediately.

154
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,640
Actually Odette ...

155
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,840
You found Rothbart's formula
for the forbidden arts

156
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,840
and you didn't tell me?

157
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,220
I did not want you to worry.

158
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,280
You see, after Clavius was destroyed,

159
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,640
Rogers and I found this
underground chamber.

160
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,440
There were all sorts of things Rothbart left behind, including his formula for the forbidden arts.

161
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,740
I destroyed everything, of course

162
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,040
except Rothbart's notes.

163
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,020
I'm free.

164
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
Derek. How could you?

165
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Apologize, Derek.

166
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,380
I really think that someday we
can use their power for good.

167
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,080
Derek, nothing good can
come from those notes.

168
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,520
You must destroy them.

169
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,140
You're right, Odette.
I will destroy them right away.

170
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,260
Rogers and I are the only
ones who know where they are.

171
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,740
But there's a rumor.

172
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,140
Look, even if someone did find them, they'd never figure them out without my help.

173
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,240
Apologize, apologize!

174
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,060
I would never put you in danger.

175
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,560
Promise me you will destroy
those notes, Derek!

176
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,040
I promise. I was careless,
foolish and selfish.

177
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,360
But I wasn't.

178
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,960
I did this for us.
For the kingdom.

179
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,300
Please just trust me, Odette!

180
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,640
Please, Rogers, no long speaches!

181
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,180
I only need two words: numb scull.

182
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,220
I am all free!

183
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,020
Now all I have to do
is get out of here.

184
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,320
Hold it!

185
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,360
Spying is a crime
in this kingdom.

186
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,100
So I here by claim you
as a prisoner of law.

187
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,760
Mommy, will you hold me?

188
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,020
Look at a smog check,
why don't ya?

189
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,120
Well I've looked on you, small fly.
You give up or else...

190
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,660
Zelda! Zelda!
The notes are there.

191
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,460
I knew they were there.
I knew it.

192
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,440
Great. The notes are there. Meanwhile, I got an ulcer the size of a watermellon.

193
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,220
Now, to get my hands on that chest.

194
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,080
At least it's done and I can
go back to my regular calm life.

195
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,420
Although, I'll probably gonna have nightmares the rest of my life of this little masquerade.

196
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,740
Masquerade...

197
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
So long, Zelda...
I'm leaving.

198
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,940
I think I'll do a little play.

199
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,520
I will play maiden in distress
from the far away north.

200
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,440
Break a leg!

201
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,340
The next time you need
a talking bird,

202
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,840
I understand parrots
are very dependable.

203
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,960
Not so fast.

204
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,460
There's a part for you too
in my little charade.

205
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,500
You promised to set me free.

206
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,440
How can I be a maiden in distress
without anyone to distress me?

207
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,820
- We made a deal.
- Now I'm making you another deal.

208
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,700
It's two deals in one day.
How many deals do you want?

209
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,700
Zeus boy, show some gratitude.

210
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,180
Good thing I checked this.
This cable is coming loose.

211
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,580
You should leave it that way.

212
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Add to little danger and excitement
to a rather easy and boring ride.

213
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,280
Derek, we need to talk.

214
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,400
Rogers, old man.

215
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
You made it all the way to the top.

216
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,700
You're gonna make it all the way to
the bottom with that old man's stuff

217
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,920
As your counselor and friend, Derek

218
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,460
I beg you apologize to Odette.

219
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,920
You know you're going to
have to sooner or later.

220
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,420
Why do I always have to be
the one to apologize?

221
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,600
Because that's what we husbands do.

222
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,780
We hunt, we fish, we want
sporting events and we apologize.

223
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,780
I could never be married and give
up my days of living on the edge.

224
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,280
Excuse me, big silly braggart,
but I was talking to Derek.

225
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,420
You know she's right.
She's always right.

226
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Now you're on her side? You kept
the secret too, you know.

227
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,020
I never felt good about it.

228
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,600
Well you should have
said something then.

229
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
You're the prince!

230
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,940
You're my counselor.
You're supposed to counsel me.

231
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,060
I'm supposed to support you.

232
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,060
That's my point.

233
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,220
He caught you on that one.
You've been disgraced, old man.

234
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,980
And yet, I leave in triumph.

235
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:43,080
Please, Derek, reconsider!

236
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,340
Reconsider what?

237
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,660
I'm right, aren't I?

238
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,340
Isn't it enough that
I fight the dragons?

239
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,160
That I fight the villains
and I win the prize?

240
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,240
Isn't it enough that
I run the kingdom?

241
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,160
Solve everyone's problems,

242
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,480
direct and advise?

243
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,060
Why must I also get down
on my knees and apologize?

244
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,740
<i>Because I love her,</i>

245
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,620
<i>I need her like
Earth needs the Sun...</i>

246
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:25,340
<i>I need the one I love
to keep my hope right, my head right,</i>

247
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:32,500
<i>my heart fighting on,
until I am back in her arms.</i>

248
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,280
<i>Because I love her, I need her,
like summer needs rain.</i>

249
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,980
<i>To grow and sustain each day...</i>

250
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:49,480
<i>I hear her singing and bringing
the strength to my soul</i>

251
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,320
<i>until I am back in her arms.</i>

252
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:02,920
<i>Miles apart, yet still my heart can
hear her melody.</i>

253
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:12,140
<i>I'm more than sure that I can't
endure without her love for me.</i>

254
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:18,600
<i>Because I love her, I need her,
like I need to breathe.</i>

255
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,000
<i>Did Adam need Eve like this?</i>

256
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,820
<i>Now I see clearly
I nearly gave up all I had.</i>

257
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:36,320
<i>So whatever our differences were
I'll bid them goodbye...</i>

258
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:48,400
<i>I'll give love a try and
all because I love her.</i>

259
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Almost done.

260
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,520
Look at all these entries, Puffin.

261
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,320
I can't right now, princess.

262
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,900
My radar is searching for
enemy activity.

263
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,200
Frederick, I didn't know
you like to perform.

264
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,120
What will you do?
Song? A dance?

265
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,320
I juggle. Omelettes.

266
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,680
Wow, a real stage...

267
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,140
I've done it.

268
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,740
My body and mind are one.

269
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:41,600
If I can mantain this feeling,
the obstacle course is mine.

270
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:52,220
-Far longer than forever.
-I'll hold you in my arms...

271
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,420
I've come to enter the
talent show.

272
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Certainly. Your name?

273
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,260
The Lady in Black.

274
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,820
-And your talent?
-The tango.

275
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,120
Oh, the tango.
Partner's name?

276
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,120
-I don't have one yet.
-Uberta?

277
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,280
No one can know it's me.

278
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,080
I want to win because I'm the
best, not because I'm the queen.

279
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,780
Oh, I see. I hope you can
find the partner in time.

280
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,300
I know someone who would
jump at the idea.

281
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,660
The tango? The tango's most
difficult dance known to man...

282
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,060
Rogers, you will help me
win this talent show.

283
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:39,960
Oh no, ma'am. A waltz,  maybe, a
nice foxtrot, but the tango. No way.

284
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,600
You're probably right. How silly of me to think that you could still do the tango.

285
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,060
Well, I didn't say I couldn't do it.

286
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,840
I guess even the greatest
dancers must grow old and stiff.

287
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,540
I'm not that old.

288
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,640
No, no, no. Please don't fight it,
Rogers. You must accept the truth.

289
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:09,540
Your muscles have become weak and flabby. You've the timing of a busted clock.

290
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,940
Now wait a minute!

291
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,600
Poor Rogers. You used to
move with such grace and style.

292
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,700
I still could, if I had a mind to.

293
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,000
No, no. you Must give in to the
truth. You're washed up.

294
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,200
Washed up?

295
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,900
You'll never do the tango again.

296
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,200
-Don't you count on it, my lady!
-No, no. Rogers.

297
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,100
-Orchestra!   -Don't!
-Hit it!

298
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,600
Who's washed up, chikita?
You ain't for sure!

299
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,520
Help!

300
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,240
Here he comes.
Come on, attack!

301
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,740
Help somebody!Help!

302
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,920
Hold on, madam!
I'll get the little beast.

303
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,600
Let him hit you, or else...!

304
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,120
Take that bat!

305
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,480
I hope you are alright!

306
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,180
Well I'm alright now
that you're here.

307
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,300
You were so brave.
So handsome too!

308
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,180
Even your long nose...

309
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,700
I am Zelda. From
Chut'n Chut'n Do Dang.

310
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,360
Chut'n Chut'n Do Dang?
I've never...

311
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,520
It's very far.
I've run away.

312
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,720
The evil king keep me in the castle
and make me play the accordion,

313
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,180
all day long.

314
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,200
Oh, you poor girl!

315
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,000
-What, what?
-The castle.

316
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,480
Help me. I'm so scared of castles.
Don't lock me up in the castle.

317
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,880
Oh my girl,
there's no reason to fear.

318
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,480
This is a good castle, I promise.
I will give you a tour myself.

319
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,840
I'll show you the whole thing,
from top to bottom.

320
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,300
If you promise,
then I guess it's fine,

321
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:19,600
Bridget, take this poor creature inside
and give her anything she needs!

322
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,720
You'll see we're a lot nicer than those
Chut'n Chut'n Do Dang is, any old day.

323
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,960
Don't you forget we've
got a talent show to win!

324
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,580
Now look, Rogers.

325
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,080
I'm not going to lose
because of your sorry love life.

326
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,380
Now snap out of it!

327
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,660
I want to but I think I can't...

328
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,300
Now, this particular room I
think you'll find very interesting.

329
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,480
-Originally it was used for...
-Cut the speech and open a door!

330
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,740
I'm so excited.
Will you forgive?

331
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,600
I will.

332
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,540
As I was saying,
this room was originally...

333
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,820
Nice.
Next room!

334
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,760
-But I didn't get to tell you.
-Please pumpkin! Next room.

335
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,620
Pumpkin? Anything you
say, muffin.

336
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,960
This next room... is nothing special.
Very boring.

337
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,160
What is in it?

338
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:34,160
Nothing. Little things, stuff and other
things. Now, if you'll just follow me...

339
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,180
No, Zelda.
You mustn't do that.

340
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,900
What Rogers honey don't
want me to see?

341
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,980
Nothing at all.

342
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,300
You shouldn't have done
that, Zelda.

343
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,700
-I'm so sorry.
-Well, you should be.

344
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:56,000
-You're mad at Zelda.
-No. You don't have to...

345
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,980
I could never be mad at you.

346
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,660
In Chut'n Chut'n Do Dang
if the girl loved a boy,

347
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,760
She show it in special way.

348
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,660
-You want to see?
-If you want to show me.

349
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,180
I love that girl.

350
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,580
I heard we have a special guest.

351
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,080
Her name is Zelda.
I think Rogers is in love.

352
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,880
Rogers in love?
This I gotta see.

353
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,400
Look Odette, there's
something I...

354
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,400
I was wrong to keep
Rothbart's notes .

355
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,600
Oh, Derek...
you will destroy them then?

356
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,580
-As soon as the festival's over.
-Don't wait till then, Derek! Please.

357
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,660
After the festival.
I promise.

358
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,440
Trust me!
Nothing will happen.

359
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,240
So I tell the king I will
not play accordion no more.

360
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,640
Yes. And so then? What did he
do, what did that awful king do?

361
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:04,460
The king, he grabbed me and say: "You must play accordion" and Zelda say "I won't"

362
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,040
Then the king, he shake
me and say: "You must..."

363
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,060
And then Zelda said: "No".
Then the king yell: "Guards"...

364
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,180
And then what happened? What
happened when the guards came?

365
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,420
Then I remembered
self defense technique.

366
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,380
And Zelda go...

367
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,960
Then Zelda run away
and then I come here...

368
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,340
We'll act out your story for
the talent contest.

369
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,900
Zelda, accordion slave.
It's a sure winner.

370
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,600
What a shame. It's getting
dark and you have to go.

371
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,800
-But she hasn't even eaten.
-Well thank heavens for doggy bags.

372
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,200
But she has no home.

373
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,560
Well she does now. I'm buying her one
at the northern end of the kingdom.

374
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,220
-But I want to stay.
-You are not safe here.

375
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,620
The Do Dangians
will come looking for you.

376
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,220
Oh, they'd never look here.

377
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,280
Of course they will. Those
Dang Do Dangians always do.

378
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,080
Come now, dear, the
carriage is leaving.

379
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,880
-Uberta!   - But I'm scared.
Rogers, help !

380
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,680
-Move it, you little tramp!
-Zelda !

381
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,600
Oh, my ankle!

382
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,420
Now look what you've done. She'll have to stay here now for at least a few days.

383
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,500
Poor little muffin.

384
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,940
I don't care if you are the king.

385
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:55,080
It's cruel to force someone
to play the accordion.

386
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,980
Hands off!

387
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,740
How dare you
treat Zelda that way?

388
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,900
Forget about me, Zelda. Run!
I'll take care of the guard.

389
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,760
Run, Zelda!

390
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:37,420
-Thanks a lot, pumpkin.
-You're welcome, muffin.

391
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,980
Gone. My muffin is gone.

392
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,040
How could she leave me?
We were in love.

393
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,440
No, wait, maybe I
misunderstood her letter.

394
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,900
Yes, that's it.
"Dear pumpkin, I hate you. Zelda"

395
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,800
Oh, that pain!

396
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,600
I guess her anckle wasn't
that bad after all.

397
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,400
You! You sent her
back, didn't you?

398
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,300
Rogers.

399
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,200
You sent her back to that
crazed accordion loving King .

400
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,480
-I would never!
-You!

401
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,120
You're monster!
You wolf in queen's clothing!

402
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,300
How dare you accuse me of
such things? I am a queen.

403
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:37,580
I always act with dignity.
Now, you shape up or I'll pop... !

404
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:49,220
Look on the bright side, Rogers! Now we can rehearse without any distraction.

405
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,180
Rehearse?
I feel like dying not dancing.

406
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,900
She's gone!

407
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,820
<i>She's gone and
with her the Sun and Moon.</i>

408
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,940
<i>And the stars have banished from sight,
shall never again be a sunrise for me,</i>

409
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,020
<i>Because she was my light.</i>

410
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,820
<i> No laughter will ever escape from
my lips ,I'll never again sing a song</i>

411
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,960
<i>for the light and love of my life
was Zelda.</i>

412
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,220
<i>And now she's gone.</i>

413
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,300
How pathetic, Rogers.

414
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:39,020
<i>She's gone and with her the greatest
love the world has ever known</i>

415
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:46,100
<i>has suffered a dagger right through the heart and lies as cold as tomb.</i>

416
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,140
<i>the passion of Romeo and Juliet,
Josephine and Napoleon</i>

417
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,520
<i>should have bowed to the
love of Rogers and Zelda.</i>

418
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,420
<i>But now she's gone.</i>

419
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,320
Get a grip, Rogers!
You're making me nauseous.

420
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,780
<i>Save your words of encouragement,
nothing can bring me cheer.</i>

421
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:19,100
<i>Take away all my life support
and bury me right here!</i>

422
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,420
If I didn't need a partner,
I swear I would.

423
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:28,520
<i>Now, little darling, won't you please come home and heal this broken heart?</i>

424
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,400
<i>Because your muffin man
he just can't stand the pain...</i>

425
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,880
<i>For the reason my world
had turned was Zelda...</i>

426
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,880
<i>No other love in history held her.</i>

427
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:56,520
<i>But now, she's gone...</i>

428
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,900
Rogers, this is your queen speaking.

429
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,880
You will regain consciousness
this instant

430
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,480
and remain conscious until
I win the talent show.

431
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,700
Or else...

432
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,800
Very well!
I have no other choice

433
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,420
but to take you to a castle and deal with you in a matter to which you are according!

434
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,160
Oh, my muffin play the accordion.

435
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,760
Your muffin's history, chump!

436
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,400
What kind of lock did he put
on this thing anyhow?

437
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,880
Finally.

438
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,800
I'm free. I'm free.

439
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,380
-I am free, aren't I?   -Yes. Go on, you
worthless mass of feathers!

440
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,160
I'm free.

441
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:27,080
Yes. The power to change.
The power to create.

442
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,200
And, finally... The greatest of them all,
the power to destr... What's this?

443
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,600
Someone's torn off the last word...

444
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,400
I'll never have the power
to destroy without it.

445
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,780
So, that's what Derek meant.

446
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,780
-Hello.
-Tell me what Derek said.

447
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,060
He said: "They'd never figure
them out without my help. "

448
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,520
The little whimp, tore it off himself.

449
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:15,100
He's hiding it somewhere.
He took what I wanted most of all.

450
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,600
He took what I love.

451
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,900
Well two can play this game.

452
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:30,100
"Dear Prince Derek, I have kidnapped
your sweet Odette, dot."

453
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:39,100
"If you want to see her alive again, comma, then meet me at the mouth of the Western River"

454
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,080
"with the missing section
of Rothbart's notes. "

455
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,500
"Exclamation, exclamation, exclamation! "

456
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,980
-Take this to Derek!
-But you said...

457
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:56,320
You know how many Yaki birds
would die to have just one deal?

458
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,120
Now you've got three.

459
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,020
Take it to Derek now!

460
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,480
I'll take care Odette.

461
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,080
Seek her out and bring her to me!

462
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,880
Will you hurry up, Jean-Bob?
It's getting late.

463
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,460
Don't rush me!

464
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,220
You know, I can't believe you made
Odette drive you all the way up here.

465
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,600
Just so you can practice
for the obstacle course.

466
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,920
It is the perfect spot.

467
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,400
I will swing across this ravine,
race down that slope,

468
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,900
swim the river,

469
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,080
hop those rocks,
then scale this cliff

470
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,380
before the last grain of
sand falls to the bottom .

471
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,900
I wish you wouldn't do this.

472
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,500
You can't change my mind, Odette.

473
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,940
If I must prove I'm a
prince, then so be it.

474
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,220
Ready?

475
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,720
Speaking of falling to
the bottom...

476
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,220
Don't you think that bind's
a little frazzle?

477
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,020
Record time.

478
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,000
What is that?

479
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:38,640
-Some kind of fast moving light thing...
-Thanks a lot, Mr Science.

480
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,720
Odette!

481
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,680
Hold on!

482
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,400
Here!

483
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,560
Sure, let the frog drive. Frogs are
known for their waggon driving!

484
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,860
Just a little more!

485
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,680
I don't like my options...

486
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,920
Everybody out!

487
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,580
I still don't like my options.

488
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,680
Odette!

489
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,580
Someone finds this funny?

490
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,660
-Who are you?
-I am Zelda, accordion slave.

491
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,640
You'll never get away with this.

492
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,440
Don't make her angry!

493
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,340
-Derek will come for me.
-Odette!

494
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,800
I hope so...

495
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,040
But it seems to take his time when
it comes to really important matters.

496
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,240
Such as destroying Rothbart's notes.

497
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,640
He can have you back,

498
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,740
as soon as he brings the little
piece he stole.

499
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,160
He'll never do it.

500
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:52,020
We know both Derek will give
me anything to save your life.

501
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,980
Even the power to destroy.

502
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,280
Face it, sister.
The forbidden arts are now mine .

503
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:09,920
You know, not all things are as bad as
they seem. But I'm pretty sure this is!

504
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,500
Odette?

505
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,340
Where is she?

506
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,960
Okay...

507
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,560
Next me pluck the duck.

508
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,260
Add a touch of basil.

509
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,860
A pinch of a rice... Oh yummy!

510
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,060
Frederick, have you seen Odette?

511
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,180
Not since she left in the carriage.

512
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,720
I hope you find her soon.
I'm making your favorite.

513
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,560
It used to be his favorite.

514
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,860
That's a good looking duck...

515
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,460
Odette?

516
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,880
No!

517
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,560
Derek... Derek, where are you?

518
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,260
Something foul is going on here...

519
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,280
And you're just the one
behind it all, aren't you?

520
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,040
I got you this time.
Give yourself up...

521
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,600
There's nowhere to hide...

522
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
You better enjoy your rest,

523
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,100
because when you wake up you've
got some explaining to do!

524
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,660
Just because I have to wait
for the power to destroy,

525
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:44,540
doesn't mean I can't enjoy
the power to create and change.

526
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,280
<i>I guess I've been naughty
and I've been bad.</i>

527
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,200
<i>I couldn't live well enough alone.</i>

528
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,780
<i>I dug up a horrible secret, you see
and I'm afraid I've made it my own.</i>

529
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,680
<i>It's something so wicked
I should often think</i>

530
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,980
<i>of the descipable deeds that I'll do.</i>

531
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:17,280
<i>Creating such chaos as you've never
seen and misery like you never knew.</i>

532
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,820
<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

533
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,380
<i>Ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

534
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,580
<i>So kiss up your happiness,
bury your dreams,</i>

535
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,460
<i>Embrace
this new feeling of dread...</i>

536
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:41,180
<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

537
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,040
<i>The power to change is mine!
All mine!</i>

538
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,640
<i> The first thing I'll
change is the wind.</i>

539
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:02,200
<i>Odette and Derek are soon going to find that I played them for sniveling fools.</i>

540
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,540
<i>From now on the kingdom
will hear what I say.</i>

541
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,640
<i>And whatever Zelda says - goes.</i>

542
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,060
<i>The world is my play thing,
my yo yo, my toy.</i>

543
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,460
<i>And I won't stop
till everyone knows.</i>

544
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,760
<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

545
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,880
<i>Ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

546
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,460
<i>I'm the badest of bad girls,</i>

547
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,120
<i>And now that I'm back
my cast is written in red...</i>

548
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,520
<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

549
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,980
<i>Are you scared?</i>

550
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,980
<i>All the fear.</i>

551
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,640
Overflowing is more like it.

552
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,400
<i>Will you run and hide?</i>

553
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,800
<i>Well ain't that a shme, cos honey
it's too darn late.</i>

554
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,940
<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

555
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:12,280
<i>Move over Medusa, Cruela, get lost!
Take a hike wicked Witch of the West!</i>

556
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:24,860
<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead, wonderfuly sad days, can you see my mad ways?</i>

557
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:34,780
<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

558
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,180
What ?

559
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,160
I know how to teach you a lesson.

560
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,100
No.

561
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,580
Trap Odette!

562
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,380
Try that!

563
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,940
The same thing will happen to you
if you try to escape.

564
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,400
Anyone for barbcued frog legs?

565
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,460
If you won't act like you've
got a spine, Rodgers,

566
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,320
Then I'll give you one myself.

567
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,260
And that goes for all the rest
of the bones in your body too.

568
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,380
Try dripping now, Mr. Sniveling Pants.

569
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,000
Is that you, muffin?

570
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,280
No.

571
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,780
What will it take to bring
you to your senses?

572
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,960
Odette's been kidnapped.

573
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,560
What?!

574
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,200
Zelda used you to get the keys.

575
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,200
Oh that, that mean muffin!
Derek, I'm so sorry.

576
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,400
It's not your fault.

577
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,400
If I hadn't kept Rothbart's notes
none of this would have happened.

578
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,980
She wants some sort of ransom,
no doubt.

579
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,120
That's what I've come to get.

580
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,340
Derek, you can't give away the
secret to the forbidden arts.

581
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
You promised
to keep them safe.

582
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,340
I've fought the forbidden arts
before, and I'll fight them again.

583
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,260
But I am not going to lose Odette.

584
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,940
You can't fool me.

585
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,900
All this nice talk is just part
of the torture, I know it.

586
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,060
First you make think I'm not
gonna be tortured, sure.

587
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,660
Then you torture me anyhow.

588
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,580
I'm not stupid. I've been around
the block a few times, alright?

589
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,160
Look, Whizzer, we are
not gonna torture you.

590
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,680
All we want to know is how to
find Odette.

591
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,520
Please. You gotta help us.

592
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,680
I can't tell you.

593
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,220
She'll send one of those
fireballs after me.

594
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,840
She'll torture me way worse
than you ever could.

595
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,340
Believe me, she won't waste
time with the nice talk.

596
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,440
Who is she?

597
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,200
I've said too much.
Now she'll never let me go.

598
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,900
Oh, you bird brain!

599
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,760
Whizzer, my friend.

600
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,480
<i>You are prisoner forever when
you're trapped inside your fears,</i>

601
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,100
<i>Because you know that
what you're doing isn't right.</i>

602
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,500
<i>And you're never gonna change
that in a hundred million years,</i>

603
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,200
<i>Unless you change the
side for which you fight.</i>

604
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,600
<i>So trust a wing of friendship, believe
us when we say you'll feel  marvelous</i>

605
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,220
<i>The moment you decide
to do what's right and proper</i>

606
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,508
<i>You'll be free again.</i>

607
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:36,445
<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right side.</i>

608
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:46,800
<i>The right side where there's confidence
and wondrous piece of mind.</i>

609
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,500
That's the spirit, Whizzer.

610
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:54,600
<i>We can always persevere
whatever obstacles appear.</i>

611
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,700
<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right side.</i>

612
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,025
You guys are right. I'm gonna tell
you everything. What am I, crazy?

613
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,300
<i>If your feathers are quivering,
if you're shaking in yur shell,</i>

614
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,045
<i>then it's confidence you're
wanting that's for sure.</i>

615
00:50:10,046 --> 00:50:13,250
<i>It'll all come from knowing that
your actions will tell</i>

616
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,400
<i> that your intentions
are noble, good and pure...</i>

617
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,100
<i>so gather courage from your comrades,</i>

618
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,700
<i>take the promise of your pals that whatever comes we'll take it and destroy.</i>

619
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,850
<i>So be true to the feelings
that you're fighting,</i>

620
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,650
<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right side.</i>

621
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:34,560
<i>The right side.</i>

622
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,200
<i>Where there's confidence
and wondrous piece of mind,</i>

623
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:46,800
<i>You can always persevere
whatever obstacles appear.</i>

624
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,300
<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right...</i>

625
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,400
<i>You're not always looking
over your shoulder,</i>

626
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,345
<i>you're not sneaking from
shadow to shadow,</i>

627
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:59,502
<i>You can live your life
free or in border</i>

628
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:05,415
<i>When you know you're
on the right side.</i>

629
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:14,203
<i>Where there's confidence
and wondrous piece of mind,</i>

630
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:20,500
<i>You can always persevere
whatever obstacles appear.</i>

631
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:34,020
<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right side.</i>

632
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:45,600
She... she's got the notes.
Except for a little section he tore off.

633
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,999
So she doesn't have what she really
wants which is the power to destroy.

634
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,140
So she kidnapped her with a fireball, so he would give here the missing section.

635
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,200
So he's probably on his way to
meet her right now.

636
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,300
And if she gets
the power to destroy,

637
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,850
Oh boy, it's gonna be trouble
for you, me, he and she.

638
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:09,450
It felt good. Alright, what do
we do, men?

639
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:10,520
Yeah...

640
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,400
We've got to find Derek before he
gives away that missing section.

641
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,850
-Speed, you take the  water way!
-I'm on my way.

642
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,150
And remember, men, no fear!

643
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,800
I just betrayed the most powerful,

644
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,870
most dangerous person
in the universe.

645
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,750
This is not good!
Not good!

646
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,500
Right on time!

647
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,000
Just to make sure
there are no tricks!

648
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,005
Zelda?

649
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,000
Odette!

650
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,950
Oh, Derek.

651
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,770
-You escaped ?
-Yes.

652
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,000
But you have to stop her.
She'll destroy everything.

653
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,350
She can't destroy anything
without this.

654
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,425
You keep falling for that old trick,
don't you, big guy?

655
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,780
Give me Odette!

656
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,890
Sorry, I need her
for the experiment.

657
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:25,277
To see if the power
to destroy really works.

658
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,500
Prince Derek...

659
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,076
Follow that fireball, Puffin!
Go!

660
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,070
That won't be necessary, sire.
Whizzer knows the way.

661
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,320
Nothing like a quiet
evening sitting by the fire.

662
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,715
You just can't keep
a good woman down.

663
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,160
Of course, she sort of puts
a damp on the things.

664
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,325
Odette. How did...

665
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,900
There's no time to explain, Derek.
You have to stop her.

666
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I've got to get you out of
here first.

667
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,900
No, Derek.

668
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,200
Is there any escape?

669
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,800
Derek...

670
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,500
I won't see you die.
Is there any escape?

671
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,800
I think so...

672
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,350
This is crazy.

673
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,900
Trust me, Derek.
Pull!

674
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,900
Are you pushing or am I doing
all the work?

675
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,070
You're lucky, Odette.

676
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,950
You'll be the first to see
the power to destroy.

677
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,200
-Go, Odette !
-I'm not leaving you.

678
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,945
You!

679
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,800
-I was here first.
-So what? I am a prince.

680
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,275
Cowards! Come out!

681
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,600
This is war, not hide and seek.

682
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,160
Seek... My seekers!

683
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:13,993
What do you know? I have
improved on the forbidden arts.

684
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,020
You gotta get out of here, Odette.

685
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,850
You can't hide from this one.
Trust me! Go!

686
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,500
What?

687
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,062
It's a destroying seeker.
Go!

688
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:30,500
Seek out the swan
and destroy her!

689
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,200
No! Odette !

690
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,300
The fireball will die,
if you break the rod.

691
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,900
Odette.

692
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,700
Bye, Derek.

693
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,650
Hello, Zelda.

694
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,350
Rothbart, you're alive!

695
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,888
Amazing, isn't it?

696
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:34,100
Thank you for recovering the
forbidden arts.

697
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,950
But now you're through.

698
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,500
Tell you what, I'll give you
a chance. To run!

699
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,800
Traitor!

700
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,700
Zelda.

701
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,756
Puffin!

702
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,250
Odette?

703
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,100
Where is she?
Where is Odette?

704
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,620
Oh, Derek, she's gone.

705
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:29,100
Gone? What do
you mean gone?

706
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,530
The fireball.
She couldn't get away.

707
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,180
No!

708
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,550
Odette...

709
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:38,200
If you can hear me, Odette...
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...

710
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,390
I pray something good can still
come from destroying these notes.

711
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,033
Odette.

712
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,100
Is it really you?

713
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:14,900
-Oh, Derek.
-Oh, Odette. I'm so sorry. I love you.

714
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,850
-Sorry, Speed.
-Me too.

715
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:26,715
-I love you, Puffin.
-I love you.

716
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,355
These are the last two contestants
for the obstacle course.

717
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:52,408
They call this an obstacle course.
It doesn't even have a snake pit.

718
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,670
Last year's champion
Rock Chutney.

719
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:04,630
And a new entry this year -
Jean-Bob!

720
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,064
Let me apologize ahead
for defeating you.

721
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:17,983
I was looking forward to this,
but the little guy's still dumb.

722
01:01:17,985 --> 01:01:20,159
I sort of feel sorry for him.

723
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:24,300
Yes, me too. I wish we
can spare him the shame.

724
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,430
Runners, to your mark.

725
01:01:28,866 --> 01:01:32,650
Rock, my friend, you are a half wit.

726
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,400
In fact, it hurts me to know that
you are so very stupid.

727
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,350
-It's not me.
-Set!

728
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:48,700
In addition to all this...
you run like a girl.

729
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,100
-Go!
-I'll get you!

730
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:18,747
A new record! Jean-Bob
is prince for a day.

731
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,300
Now you see.
I am a prince!

732
01:02:58,062 --> 01:02:59,325
Rogers!

733
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,970
Not again!
Rogers, get down here!

734
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,600
They really liked me!

735
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,999
Promise me, Derek, there's no
more magic in the castle.

736
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,550
I can't do that.

737
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,160
So long as you are here, Odette,
there'll always be magic.

738
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:52,050
