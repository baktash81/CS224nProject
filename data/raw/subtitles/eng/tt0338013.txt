<i>No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired

343
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:28,878
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

344
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,152
How about on the fifth?

345
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,481
<i>That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?</i>

346
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:38,895
<i>Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.</i>

347
00:24:38,962 --> 00:24:42,408
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

348

00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:55,848
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

353
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,826
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.
Really?

354
00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:00,866
- Thank you.
- [Mutters] Great.

355
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:02,792
I don't have a pen.

Oh.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.</i>

359
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:13,499
Mr. Barish?

360
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,635
How are we today?

361
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,553
Not too good, actually.

362
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,473
<i>Boo!
Oh, my God! Stan!</i>

363
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,353
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!

364
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:27,581

Sorry. Sorry.

365
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,558
[Whispers]
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

366
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,382
You should not
have seen this.

367
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,356
I apologize.

368
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,411
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

369
00:25:40,478 --> 00:25:43,192
<i>I assure you, no.
[Woman]
No.</i>

370
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:51,028
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

371
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:55,537
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

372
00:25:55,607 --> 00:25:57,974
so I can't show you evidence.

373
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,536
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

374
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,580
and she wanted to move on.

375
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:07,506
<i>[Dr. Mierzwiak]

God, Rob! Give it a rest!

00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,005
It's okay.
It's all right.

383
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:27,655
Carrie, I am making
a birdhouse.

384
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:33,191
<i>What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.</i>

385
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,981
She's impulsive.

386
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,465
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

387
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:42,149
[Sighs]

388
00:26:42,215 --> 00:26:44,069
A lark.

389
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:47,429
[Sobbing]
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

390
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:52,542
<i>[Woman]
Wait, wait, wait, wait!</i>

391
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,424
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

392
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,360
Okay. I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time.

393
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,662
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

394
00:27:01,729 --> 00:27:04,543
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.

395
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:08,021
<i>And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.</i>

396
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,485
Now, the, uh...

397
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:17,371
the first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

398
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,290
<i>is to go home...</i>

399
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:24,569
<i>and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.</i>

400
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,770
<i>Anything.</i>

401
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:32,240
<i>And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.</i>

402
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:34,796
<i>Okay?</i>

403
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:39,724
<i>So we'll need, uh,
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,</i>

404
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:44,551
<i>books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,</i>

405
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:47,146
<i>journal entries.</i>

406
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:48,908
<i>We want to empty your home...</i>

407
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:53,132
<i>We want to empty your life
of Clementine.</i>

408
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:57,507
<i>And after the mapping is done,
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.</i>

409
00:27:57,581 --> 00:28:00,777
<i>That way, when you awake
in the morning,</i>

410
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:05,098
<i>you'll fixind yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened...</i>

411
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:07,552
<i>a new life awaiting you.</i>

412
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,756
[Tires Screech]

Wake up, buddy!

413
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:20,448
<i>[Mary]
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.</i>

414
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:23,550
<i>You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.</i>

415
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:28,028
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

416
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:31,611
<i>Hello. I'm right here.</i>

417
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:35,707
I know it's an emergency,
and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.

418
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:39,071
<i>Maybe you could talk to the doctor,
a- and he...</i>

419
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:43,224
<i>All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like
to come in this week?</i>

420
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:46,589
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy
this afternoon.

421
00:28:46,654 --> 00:28:50,448
<i>Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?</i>

422
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,233
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

423
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,370

<i>one of our most experienced

He'll be handling
your case tonight.

430
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:12,402
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

431
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,322
My name is Joel Barish,

432
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:18,761
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

433
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:23,653
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

434
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,149
Uh, I was...

435
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:29,867
living with this woman, Naomi,

436
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,388
uh, a couple years ago,

437
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:37,478
and my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.

438
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:40,646
<i>Naomi couldn't go, but I went...</i>

439
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:43,747
<i>and I, uh, met Clementine.</i>

440
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:46,686
<i>[Pencils Clattering On Floor]
I'm sorry.</i>

441
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:49,575
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

442
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,088
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

443
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,012
There's an emotional core...

444
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:56,931
to each of our memories,

445
00:29:56,996 --> 00:30:00,607
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

446
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:03,009
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

447
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:06,653
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

448
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,662
as in a dream upon waking.

449
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:11,899
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

450
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:14,835
Well, uh, technically speaking,

451
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,765
<i>the procedure is brain damage,</i>

452
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,546
but it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

453
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:21,466
Nothing you'll miss.

454
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,751
Comfortable?

455
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:29,297
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,
is actually creating a map of your brain.

456
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,606
<i>[Mierzwiak]
Okay, let's get started.</i>

457
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:35,250
<i>If we want to get
this procedure underway tonight,
we have some work to do.</i>

458
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:38,995
I want you to react
to these objects, Mr. Barish,
if you will.

There's a good story
behind this one...

461
00:30:43,956 --> 00:30:46,770
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,
I'll get a much better
emotional readout...

462
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:50,576
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

463
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,497
Just try to focus on the memories.

464
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:55,016
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

This is so...

00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:06,776
All right, we should get started.

Very good.

[Simultaneously]
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out
to be like this.

1313
01:16:23,209 --> 01:16:26,437
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1314
01:16:26,504 --> 01:16:28,871
<i>I'm a stupid girl
with a stupid crush!
Yeah.</i>

1315
01:16:28,937 --> 01:16:31,324
I swear I basically
forced him into it!

1316
01:16:32,485 --> 01:16:35,006
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

1317
01:16:37,573 --> 01:16:40,190
Tell me what?

1318
01:16:40,261 --> 01:16:42,169
Oh, you poor kid.

1319
01:16:43,139 --> 01:16:45,145
You can have him.

1320
01:16:45,217 --> 01:16:47,072
You did.

1321
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:57,139
What?

1322
01:17:00,797 --> 01:17:02,705
Oh, uh,

1323
01:17:07,514 --> 01:17:10,961
we have a history.

1324
01:17:11,033 --> 01:17:13,488
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1325
01:17:13,561 --> 01:17:15,632
You...

1326
01:17:15,704 --> 01:17:18,092
You wanted it done...

1327
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:21,329
so you could get past, uh...

1328
01:17:22,965 --> 01:17:24,874
You could... Yeah.

1329
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:31,047
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

1330
01:17:31,122 --> 01:17:33,030
It's almost morning.

1331
01:17:34,193 --> 01:17:36,102
We'll talk later.

1332
01:17:37,073 --> 01:17:38,926
Okay?

1333
01:17:49,452 --> 01:17:51,306
<i>[Stan]
Hey.</i>

1334
01:17:55,082 --> 01:17:56,989
Let me give you a lift home.

1335
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,635
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1336
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:12,155
Hi.
Hi.

1337
01:18:12,228 --> 01:18:16,002
Didn't figure you'd show your face
around me again.

1338
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:19,164
I guess I thought
you were... humiliated.

1339
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:21,119
You did run away,
after all.

1340
01:18:21,184 --> 01:18:23,834
<i>I just needed to see ya.</i>

1341
01:18:23,904 --> 01:18:26,108
Yeah?

1342
01:18:26,176 --> 01:18:28,794
I'd like to, um,

1343
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,708
take you out or something.

1344
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:34,228
You're married.

1345
01:18:34,301 --> 01:18:36,634
Not yet. Not married.

1346
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,555
No, I'm not married, no.

1347
01:18:38,618 --> 01:18:41,521
Look, man,
I'm telling you right off the bat
I'm high maintenance,

1348
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:45,967
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

1349
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,275
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1350
01:18:48,343 --> 01:18:51,342
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1351
01:18:51,414 --> 01:18:53,487
Okay.

1352
01:18:53,559 --> 01:18:56,339
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1353
01:18:56,405 --> 01:18:59,087
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1354
01:18:59,156 --> 01:19:02,636
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

1355
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:07,178
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech
really well.

1356
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:10,596
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole
human race pegged.

1357
01:19:10,672 --> 01:19:12,581
Hmm. Probably.

1358
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:16,874
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1359
01:19:16,943 --> 01:19:18,797
even after that.

1360
01:19:18,862 --> 01:19:22,122
Mmm. I know.

1361
01:19:24,363 --> 01:19:26,272
It would be different...

1362
01:19:27,369 --> 01:19:29,672
if we could just give it
another go around.

1363
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:35,749
Remember me.

1364
01:19:35,814 --> 01:19:37,724
Try your best.

1365
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,830
Maybe we can.

1366
01:20:11,803 --> 01:20:14,617
[Mierzwiak]
Okay, so just tell me
what you remember,

1367
01:20:14,682 --> 01:20:17,169
and, uh, then we'll
take it from there.

1368
01:20:17,242 --> 01:20:19,380
[Mary]
Okay.

1369
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:22,229
I liked you immediately.

1370
01:20:22,295 --> 01:20:24,683
<i>You didn't
come on to me at all.</i>

1371
01:20:24,758 --> 01:20:27,626
<i>I liked that.</i>

1372
01:20:27,701 --> 01:20:30,549
<i>I was so tongue-tied
around you at fixirst.</i>

1373
01:20:30,613 --> 01:20:33,163
<i>I wanted you to think
I was smart.</i>

1374
01:20:34,322 --> 01:20:36,558
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

1375
01:20:36,627 --> 01:20:39,974
I had these fantasies
of us being married...

1376
01:20:40,049 --> 01:20:43,278
and having kids and... just...

1377
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:45,928
<i>Oh, Howie, I can't do this.</i>

1378
01:20:45,998 --> 01:20:48,485
<i>[Mierzwiak]
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.</i>

1379
01:20:48,558 --> 01:20:50,925
<i>[Mary Crying]
Yeah, I know.</i>

1380
01:20:50,991 --> 01:20:52,845
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1381
01:20:53,165 --> 01:20:55,171
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1382
01:20:55,244 --> 01:20:57,098
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?

1383
01:20:57,162 --> 01:20:59,552
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...

1384
01:20:59,627 --> 01:21:02,114
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.

1385
01:21:02,186 --> 01:21:04,040
No, no, no, no!

1386
01:21:04,105 --> 01:21:06,178
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.

1387
01:21:06,247 --> 01:21:09,117
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1388
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:13,888
<i>[Joel]
This is the day we met.</i>

1389
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:17,024
<i>You were down by the surf.
I couldjust make you out
in the distance.</i>

1390
01:21:17,093 --> 01:21:19,132
<i>I remember being drawn to you
even then.</i>

1391
01:21:19,204 --> 01:21:23,163
<i>I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back. "</i>

1392
01:21:24,866 --> 01:21:27,898
<i>You were in that orange sweatshirt
that I would come to know so well...</i>

1393
01:21:27,968 --> 01:21:29,856
<i>and even hate, eventually.</i>

1394
01:21:29,921 --> 01:21:33,748
At the time I thought,
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1395
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:36,439
Hi there.

1396
01:21:36,509 --> 01:21:38,364
Hi.

1397
01:21:38,429 --> 01:21:41,243
I saw you sitting over here...

1398
01:21:41,308 --> 01:21:43,162
by yourself,

1399
01:21:43,227 --> 01:21:46,007
and I thought, "Thank God.

1400
01:21:46,074 --> 01:21:48,757
Someone normal
who doesn't know how to interact
at these things either."

1401
01:21:48,825 --> 01:21:50,864
Yeah.

1402
01:21:50,937 --> 01:21:53,839
I don't ever know what to say.

1403
01:21:53,913 --> 01:21:56,529
I'm Clementine.

1404
01:21:56,599 --> 01:21:59,632
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1405
01:21:59,702 --> 01:22:01,840
And then you just took it...

1406
01:22:01,909 --> 01:22:04,329
without waiting for an answer.

1407
01:22:07,731 --> 01:22:10,118
It was so intimate,

1408
01:22:10,193 --> 01:22:13,192
like we were already lovers.

1409
01:22:13,265 --> 01:22:15,948
I'm Joel.

1410
01:22:16,016 --> 01:22:18,089
Hi, Joel.

1411
01:22:18,161 --> 01:22:21,258
So, no jokes about my name.

1412
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:25,602
You mean like...
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine

1413
01:22:25,677 --> 01:22:28,066
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

1414
01:22:28,139 --> 01:22:30,082
Yeah. Like that.

1415
01:22:30,156 --> 01:22:32,010
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1416
01:22:32,074 --> 01:22:35,652
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1417
01:22:35,722 --> 01:22:37,630
<i>Oh.</i>

1418
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:41,732
I think your name is magical.

1419
01:22:44,518 --> 01:22:46,722
This is it, Joel.

1420
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,894
It's gonna be gone soon.

1421
01:22:50,949 --> 01:22:53,185
I know.

1422
01:22:53,252 --> 01:22:55,106
What do we do?

1423
01:22:57,411 --> 01:22:59,799
Enjoy it.

1424
01:23:15,771 --> 01:23:17,976
[Clementine]
You married?
No.

1425
01:23:18,044 --> 01:23:20,562
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1426
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:22,455
I do sort of live
with someone though.

1427
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,749
Male or female?
What?

1428
01:23:25,816 --> 01:23:28,150
Female. Female.

1429
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,546
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1430
01:23:36,213 --> 01:23:40,040
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.

1431
01:23:41,011 --> 01:23:42,864
They might have a dog.

1432
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:46,442
[Giggling]
There's no dog.

1433
01:23:46,512 --> 01:23:48,422
What are you doing?

01:23:48,497 --> 01:23:51,627
<i>It's freezing out.

Hoo-hoo!

<i>- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!</i>

1437
01:24:04,746 --> 01:24:07,233
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1438
01:24:07,306 --> 01:24:10,305
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

1439
01:24:12,937 --> 01:24:14,791
It's dark.

1440
01:24:14,855 --> 01:24:18,684
So, uh, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1441
01:24:18,759 --> 01:24:21,856
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...

1442
01:24:21,925 --> 01:24:24,226
We're...
[Laughing]
Whatever.

1443
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:28,218
<i>So this is great.
Now I can look for, um,
candles, matches...</i>

1444
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:30,657
<i>and the liquor cabinet.</i>

1445
01:24:30,723 --> 01:24:33,852
<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>[Tapping Phone Receiver Button]</i>

01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,028
I think we should go.

1448
01:24:40,096 --> 01:24:42,582
There's no phone line.
What?

1449
01:24:42,655 --> 01:24:44,726
<i>I think we should go.
Why?</i>

1450
01:24:44,797 --> 01:24:47,284
It's our house...
just for tonight.
[Sighs]

1451
01:24:47,356 --> 01:24:50,203
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

1452
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:53,625
<i>Which one do you want to be?
Uh...</i>

1453
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:57,037
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1454
01:24:58,487 --> 01:25:01,683
What are you do...

1455
01:25:01,752 --> 01:25:03,890
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.

1456
01:25:03,959 --> 01:25:06,446
So, are you okay with wine?

1457
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:09,069
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.

1458
01:25:09,141 --> 01:25:13,199
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

1459
01:25:16,466 --> 01:25:19,117
<i>I'm Ruth-less at the moment.

Now I wish I'd stayed.

1467

<i>[Clementine]
