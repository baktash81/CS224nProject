1
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,100
Looking for something?

2
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:42,020
Yes, a grave.

3
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,140
No one's had time to die here yet.
You can see there is no graveyard.

4
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,380
This was a long time ago.

5
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,179
Actually, not such a long time.
Nearly three years.

6
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:53,619
I buried a friend here.
A friend.

7
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Huge trees stood here.
A cedar and a fir tree.

8
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,020
Remember them?

9
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,299
Probably chopped down
when the settlement was built.

10
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,379
Could it be those?

11
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,180
Dersu!

12
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,699
In the islands, the hunter

13
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:38,300
Roams all day long

14
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,539
But no luck for him

15
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,460
And he curses himseIf

16
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,860
What's he going to do

17
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,780
How is he to serve

18
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,300
He cannot be cheerful

19
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,939
So what
He'll try to aim better

20
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,620
So the hunter goes

21
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,580
To warmer waters

22
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,979
Where the fish were frolicking

23
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,419
In the beautiful weather

24
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:23,740
There on the shore

25
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,539
That year...

26
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,419
my assignment was
to go to the Shkotovo area...

27
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,379
in the Ussurii region...

28
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,860
to make a topographic survey.

29
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:33,740
Sometimes mountains and forests
look cheerful and attractive.

30
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:39,579
At other times,
they seem sullen and wild.

31
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
This isn't just my own feeling.

32
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,939
All the men in the unit
share this feeling.

33
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:55,300
With God's help,
we will spend the night here.

34
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,500
And tomorrow,
we'll find a more cheerful place.

35
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,420
Very well.
We'll halt here for the night.

36
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,339
Yes, we'll stay here for the night.

37
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,779
That valley reminded me...

38
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,699
of Walpurgis Night...

39
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,259
a place where witches
would gather for their Sabbath.

40
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,100
What's that?

41
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,699
A falling rock.

42
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,540
Is someone coming down?

43
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,899
It's a bear!

44
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,699
Please to not shoot!
Me are people!

45
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,019
Hello, Captain.

46
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,019
Look. A man.

47
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,540
You said it was a bear.

48
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,779
Won't you join us?

49
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,139
Thanks.

50
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:07,580
I am very hungry.

51
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,539
Nothing to eat today.

52
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,539
Who are you?

53
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,299
A Chinese?

54
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,299
A Korean?

55
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,220
No. Me is Goldi.

56
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,539
A hunter?

57
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,299
Me hunt all the time.

58
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:12,220
No other job.

59
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,419
Where do you live?

60
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,299
Not have home.

61
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:26,860
Build a shack and sleep,
and living like in a home.

62
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,620
No luck today?

63
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:38,820
Today shoot at stag.

64
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,580
Me not hurt him much.

65
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:42,700
Stag run away.

66
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,620
Me follow after it.

67
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,820
Me see people tracks.

68
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,019
Me go slow.
Me think:

69
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,100
''What kind of people
so far in the hills?''

70
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,779
Me look close.

71
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,500
See Captain, soldiers.

72
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,340
So me come here quick.

73
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,899
Why did you miss the stag
if you're such a good hunter?

74
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,460
You never miss?

75
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:14,740
We're soldiers.
We're not supposed to miss.

76
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,019
You great hunter, shoot all beasts...

77
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,980
we don't have anything to eat.

78
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,820
Hey, you!
Enough babble!

79
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,940
Well, well.

80
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:11,179
Here. Now you can babble.

81
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,980
My name is Arseniev.
What's yours?

82
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:29,539
Dersu Uzala.

83
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,259
How old are you?

84
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,419
I don't know well.

85
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,259
Me live a long, long time.

86
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:52,220
Do you have a family?

87
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:59,500
They all die long ago.

88
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,100
Before, I had a wife...

89
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:12,019
son and girl.

90
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,340
The smallpox finish all people.

91
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,379
Now me left alone.

92
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,299
Look, Dersu.

93
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,259
We are surveying this area--

94
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,940
the ranges, passes and rivers.

95
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,460
Will you be our guide?

96
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,220
Necessary me think.

97
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,779
Stop it.

98
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,700
Well, think it over.

99
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:18,220
Now, let's go to sleep.

100
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,419
The next day,
without saying a word...

101
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Dersu took his place
at the head of our squad.

102
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,340
There is a road here.

103
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:11,100
- A road!
- Come here! There's a road!

104
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,940
What's there?

105
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,779
This road two, three days before,
one people come.

106
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,940
Then rain come.

107
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,220
These people Chinese.

108
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:23,340
Where did you get that?

109
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:26,379
How you not understand?
Look well!

110
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,500
He wear Chinese boots.
Water in his tracks.

111
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,059
You the same as children.

112
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,980
Eyes not see.

113
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,899
You live in the forest, die soon.

114
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,740
Chinese!

115
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,379
Let's go!
Let's go!

116
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,860
Soon we find shack.

117
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,779
How do you know?

118
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:23,580
Look!

119
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,940
Strip bark.
Make roof.

120
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,539
The rain-soaked ashes...

121
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,539
the bed of grass...

122
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:01,860
and a discarded piece
of Chinese fabric...

123
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,779
all confirmed Dersu's words.

124
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,420
Obviously, a Chinese spent the night
a couple of days ago.

125
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,579
Did you see that?

126
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,539
Yegor!

127
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,380
Captain.
Rice, salt, matches, give some.

128
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,059
What do you need it for?

129
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,859
Rice, salt, matches.
Wrap in birch bark, put in shack.

130
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,259
You plan to return?

131
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,180
Why return?

132
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:52,059
Other people come.

133
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,660
Find dry wood.

134
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,740
Find food. Not die.

135
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,940
Olentiev!

136
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,380
Bring matches, rice and salt.

137
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,140
At your command.

138
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,579
This Goldi filled me
with admiration.

139
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:35,180
He had amazing insight...

140
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:39,019
acquired during his long life
in the forest.

141
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,420
Besides, he had a beautiful soul.

142
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,059
He provided for the needs
of a person he didn't know...

143
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:53,299
and probably wouldn't ever see.

144
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:19,660
Dersu, let's wait
until the rain stops.

145
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,579
Time to get ready.

146
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:25,940
Listen good.
Birds are starting to sing.

147
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,019
Rain soon stop.

148
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,940
Sun is coming out.

149
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,140
Dersu, do you know what the sun is?

150
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:44,900
Everyone knows the sun.

151
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:50,140
Could be that
you've never seen the sun?

152
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,380
Look, there it is.

153
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:21,940
Captain.

154
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:25,059
Sun is the most important men.

155
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:28,059
This men die, all die.

156
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,819
And this is another important men.

157
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,940
This is bad men. Shout.

158
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:04,819
If one listens to you,
everything around are men.

159
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,819
Look. All is men.
Water alive.

160
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,740
Well, you said it.

161
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,900
Is fire alive too?

162
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:19,500
Yes, fire is still men.

163
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:25,380
Fire angry,
forest burn for many days.

164
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,900
Fire get angry, frightful.

165
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:32,019
Water get angry, frightful.

166
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,220
Wind get angry, frightful.

167
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:37,980
Fire, water, wind.
Three mighty men.

168
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,660
The first snow fell that day.

169
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:14,700
- Why shoot?
-Just for fun.

170
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:17,059
- Step back, Dersu.
- Waste bullets, bad.

171
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,779
What waste? We're soldiers.
We're practicing.

172
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:26,619
- Screw it!
- Seryoga drank too much.

173
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,859
Let me try. Taras!

174
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,259
What a shot!

175
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,900
Go!

176
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,420
What the hell?

177
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,980
It's harder than
bringing down a flying bird.

178
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,220
Good shooter not miss.

179
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,019
Go ahead, old man.
Try it yourself.

180
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:19,180
Why shoot and smash? Why break?
Where in forest you find bottle?

181
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,579
Are you trying to
worm your way out of it?

182
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,940
Just admit you won't hit it.

183
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:26,339
Me not shoot at bottle.
Me shoot at rope.

184
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,140
Bottle fall down,
you give me bottle.

185
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:29,859
Hit the rope?
Go ahead.

186
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,740
It's yours if you hit the rope,
and I will fill it with vodka.

187
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:34,700
Go, Marchenko!

188
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,980
Go!

189
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,819
What a man!

190
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,099
He certainly put one over
on you, Olentiev!

191
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,299
Get ready to set out, men.

192
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:08,900
Go, go!

193
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:13,299
Once again, once again!

194
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,220
You won!

195
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:44,380
- Where is Dersu?
- God knows.

196
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,099
He suddenly decided to take
his portion of vodka and went off.

197
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,299
- He's sitting by the river.
- What's he doing?

198
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,140
Sitting by the fire and singing.
Probably drunk.

199
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,339
Let me tie it.

200
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,460
May I sit with you
for a while, Dersu?

201
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,299
Captain.

202
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,619
Over there my wife and kids die.

203
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,940
Smallpox.

204
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,099
Everyone afraid of smallpox.

205
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,140
Wife, kids, house,
all together burn.

206
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,220
Last night bad dream had.

207
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:19,779
Yurt will be soon fall down.

208
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,220
Wife, kids in this yurt...

209
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,859
all get freezing.

210
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,259
No eat.

211
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:33,539
So me come here,
give them everything.

212
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,420
Yesterday, an old men walked along.

213
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,380
This men didn't sleep the night.

214
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,180
- How do you know?
- No sign at camp fire that he sleep.

215
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,059
How do you know he's old?

216
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,579
Young man always walk on his toes.

217
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,740
Old man always walk on his heels.

218
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:54,819
I met that old Chinese
a few days later.

219
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,180
His name is Li Tsung-ping.

220
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,539
He is 64.

221
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,980
He come from Tientsin.

222
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,299
How did he land here?

223
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,259
Was a woman.
His brother took her.

224
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,779
He went into the mountains.

225
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:05,700
For 40 years live alone.

226
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,339
Thank you.

227
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,059
It's cold already.

228
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,780
Maybe we should invite the old man
to come over to our fire.

229
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,139
Don't, Captain.

230
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,179
Don't disturb him.

231
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,860
Him now think very much.

232
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,659
He see house, he see garden...

233
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:02,820
all in blossom.

234
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:31,780
Captain! Captain!

235
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:38,940
Li Tsung-ping come say good-bye.

236
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:40,860
Him now go home.

237
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,460
The ultimate goal
of this expedition...

238
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:30,219
was to explore the area
around Lake Khanka.

239
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,340
We had to cross bigs swamps
and roadless tracts.

240
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,820
I sent most of the men
and horses to Chernigovka.

241
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,860
Dersu, Olentiev, Krushinovandl...

242
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,579
set out for the lake in a flatboat.

243
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,260
Olentiev, stay here and make camp.

244
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Dersu and I will go on.

245
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,940
Unload.

246
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,900
Captain!

247
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:04,059
Us go back soon?
Me little scared.

248
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:08,059
Lake Khanka is not far.
We won't stay there long.

249
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:11,260
All right, Captain,
you see for yourself.

250
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,619
What is okay is okay.

251
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:39,260
Silence layover
the frozen reaches of the lake.

252
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:46,940
Some menace to humans
was lurking in this silence.

253
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,820
Captain!

254
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,659
Have to go back quick.

255
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:02,699
The wind cover our tracks.

256
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,619
Yes, yes, let's go.

257
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,940
Never mind, Dersu.

258
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:43,340
Now we'll know where we came from.

259
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,019
From there!

260
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:52,619
Captain!
Us weren't here. Bad!

261
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,579
Captain! Us lose road!

262
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:33,340
Road there.
But how do we get there?

263
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,260
There is water all around.

264
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,260
Captain! Sun is low.

265
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,099
Soon night come.
Night come, we die.

266
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:57,940
If the camp is close by,
they'll hear us.

267
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,940
We'll have to spend
the night here, Dersu.

268
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:20,940
It's dangerous to go on.
What shall we do?

269
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:27,460
Captain! Listen.
Listen good.

270
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:33,219
Have to work fast.
Us not work good, us die.

271
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,940
- What work?
- Cut grass.

272
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,579
Captain! Work fast!

273
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,019
Captain! Work fast!

274
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:26,539
Captain! Must hold grass!

275
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,059
Take rope!

276
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,260
Captain! Get up! Get up!

277
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,780
As the wind howled,
I sank into darkness.

278
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,619
I don't know how long I slept.

279
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,380
Hey, bear!

280
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,019
Climb out of den!
Sun is up!

281
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,380
Only then did I realize
what Dersu had done for me.

282
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,699
His witshad saved me.

283
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,980
Thank you, Dersu.
Thank you.

284
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,900
What would I have done without you?

285
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:40,780
Go together, work together.
No need thanks.

286
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,139
That's Olentiev!

287
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,139
From that point on...

288
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:33,059
our expedition became more difficult.

289
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,059
Let's go! Go!

290
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:48,820
Severe frost.

291
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,780
Exhaustion.

292
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,219
Hunger.

293
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,780
Man is very small
before the face of nature.

294
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,940
Forward! Forward! Don't stop!

295
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:37,860
Forward!

296
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,059
Captain!
Me find smell of smoke.

297
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,139
Udegheis are frying fish.

298
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,219
Thank you.

299
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,900
Captain.

300
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:05,460
Where go tomorrow?

301
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:11,579
We'll reach Chernigovka,
join our men there...

302
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:14,460
and then take the train
to Vladivostok.

303
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:20,460
Come with me.
It's nice and comfortable in town.

304
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:28,099
No, thank you.

305
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:29,820
Me cannot.

306
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,219
What me work in town?

307
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,219
Hunting, no.

308
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,139
Sable chase, no.

309
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,139
At least come to the station with me.

310
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:48,139
I'll get food
and some money for you there.

311
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,300
Me food, money not need.

312
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,460
Me now search sables.

313
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:01,539
Sables same money.

314
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,820
What's the matter, Dersu?

315
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:38,900
Me bad man.

316
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,980
Me want some cartridge.

317
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,219
Olentiev, give him
everything that's left.

318
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,099
Thank you, Captain.

319
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:22,420
Me tomorrow go straight ahead.

320
01:02:24,019 --> 01:02:26,659
Four suns go.

321
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,139
Find Daubikhe...

322
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,820
then go Ulakhen...

323
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:35,139
then Fujin.

324
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:38,780
Me heard...

325
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,300
many, many sable there.

326
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,179
Deer too.

327
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,340
Me heard about it.

328
01:03:40,179 --> 01:03:44,420
People around say.
Now me understand.

329
01:03:55,059 --> 01:03:57,500
Good-bye, military men.

330
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,860
Farewell.

331
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:12,420
Good-bye, Dersu.
Maybe we'll meet again.

332
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:17,980
Good-bye, Captain.

333
01:04:20,059 --> 01:04:21,420
Well...

334
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:32,619
Maybe we'll meet again.

335
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,179
Good-bye.

336
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:57,900
He's a fine man.
I never met anyone like him.

337
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,420
He's a rare man.
May God give him good health.

338
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,460
In the islands, the hunter

339
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:13,619
Roams all day long

340
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:18,460
But no luck for him

341
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:23,579
And he curses himseIf

342
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:28,099
What's he going to do

343
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:32,420
How is he to serve

344
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,699
He cannot be cheerful

345
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:41,099
So what
He'll try to aim better

346
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:44,219
So the hunter goes

347
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:47,099
To warmer waters

348
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,179
That spring...

349
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:37,019
once again I set out to traveI
across the Ussurii area.

350
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,020
Go! Go!

351
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,979
Where are you going?

352
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,939
To the left!

353
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,420
Careful! Look after the horses!
