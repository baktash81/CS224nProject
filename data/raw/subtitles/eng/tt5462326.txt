Oh, right.
You're so innocent.

28
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:23,742
I'm totally leading you
down a dark path of corruption.

29
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,676
You're right.

30
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,578
If I crash and burn
on my test today,

31
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,180
that's on you.

32
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,148
Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,750
I forgot
you have your PSATs today.

34
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:32,918
Are you ready?

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,819
How can I be ready

36
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,555
with you taking up
all my study time?

37
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,490
Ha-ha.

38
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,292
You're gonna do awesome.

39
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:43,295
Then maybe we can
celebrate tonight?

40
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,497
Can you get away
from the parental units?

41
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,765
I'll have
to make something up,

42
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,834
but you know
how creative I can be.

43
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,903
Mom says to get
your ass out of bed.

44
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,472
Jesus! Knock, please!

45
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,710
Oh, my God! I will kill you!

Good Lord, really?

56
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,336
Oh, sorry, Ms. Ryan.

57
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:58,570
See that, Josh?

58
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,405
Always do what Mom says.

59
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:04,843
No! No! No! No!

60
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,248
So not funny.

61
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,716
Awful.

62
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,951
Hey, uh, can I go to a movie
with Riley tonight?

63
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,886
- "With Riley."
- Shut up.

64
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,689
Since when does anyone
under 30 go to the movies?

65
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,793
Sweetheart,
you're not seeing that boy.

66
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,462
Well, he has a name,

67
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,831
and I know why you don't want me
to see him.

68
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,899
Yeah,
because he's a junior,

69
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:28,700
and you're a sophomore.

70
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,736
Listen, I used to be
a 17-year-old dude once,

71
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,371
-so I think I know--
-Dad, gross!

72
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,438
- Gross?
- Yeah.

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,773
Honey, your grandparents
are coming

74
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,443
-for dinner tonight, remember?
-Wh-- Mom, really?

75
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:38,944
Really.

76
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,812
What? You haven't seen them
in months,

77
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,814
and they're not getting
any younger, you know,

78
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,617
so the "movie" can wait.

79
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,285
Awesome!

80
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,553
You and Grandma
passive-aggressive

81
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,288
bitching at each other,

82
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,590
and Grandpa telling
his disgusting Vietnam stories.

83
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,892
"Pulled it out
and killed the Charlie bastard

84
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,762
with his own pigsticker."

85
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,064
Carly! I am so sorry.

86
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,033
<i>M gan yiu,</i> Mrs. Ryan.

87
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,634
I'm the Chinese.

88
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,903
Chinese is not the Charlie.

89
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,307
Well, I'm already
on the rag anyway, and I--

90
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,375
I can't hear you!

91
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,643
Hashtag,
inappropriate talk before--

92
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,979
- "Hashtag"?
- Son, you take my advice.

93
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,781
Don't ever have kids.

94
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:16,782
Oh, oops!

95
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,450
...Mr. Ryan.

96
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,786
-It's too late.
-This is bullshit!

97
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:21,953
Okay, Carly,

98
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,922
that is enough, young lady!

99
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,524
So nothing about Jeannie yet?

100
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,360
No. No baby news yet.
Soon, soon, soon.

101
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,828
This is so weak.
I can already see

102
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,629
how this is gonna go down.

103
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,031
Aunt Jeannie's gonna
have her kid today,

104
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:33,665
out of all days,

105
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,868
and you're going to be
the no-show for dinner.

106
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,557
I--

107
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,429
You know, I want to trust you,
Carly. Really...

108
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,131
I do.

109
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,370
Your dad and I both do,
but you don't make it easy

110
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,772
on us when you shut us out.

111
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,612
Do you mind not Facebooking
when we're driving together?

112
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,048
It's really
the only time we have,

113
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,783
just the two of us.

114
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,718
"Facebooking."

115
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,521
You know what I mean.

116
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,055
Yeah, whatever.

117
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,425
You know, I really, really hate
when you say that.

118
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:36,828
Amazing. I mean,

119
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,931
everything just revolves
around you, doesn't it?

120
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,502
Doesn't everyone's world
revolve around themselves?

121
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,504
Who else
should it revolve around?

122
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:45,971
Well,

123
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:50,675
you're part of a family, Carly,
and that means

124
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,676
that you love each other

125
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,912
even when
you can't stand each other,

126
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,013
and that you give a shit

127
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:59,618
even when you don't really give
a shit.

128
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,687
Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense, Mom.

129
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,424
Take your Aunt Jeannie,
for instance.

130
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,526
I mean, you could have
a new cousin today.

131
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,628
That is a big deal.

132
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,865
And all you can think about is--

133
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,101
You know,
I don't even know

134
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,035
what you're thinking about,

135
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,870
because you don't tell me
anymore.

136
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,439
We used to be best friends,
remember?

137
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,774
Okay. Well, that's not the case
anymore, Mom.

138
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,810
I have other friends.

139
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,878
Right.

140
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:36,154
See, it's just, for me,
you and Josh are everything.

141
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,892
So you don't get
to just shut me out.

142
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:41,960
Okay, it's not fair.

143
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,664
God, it's not my fault
you have no life!

144
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,073
You know what?

145
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,975
You're right.

146
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,010
Whatever.

147
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,898
Stop it! Stop it!

148
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,235
- Had enough?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

149
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:24,836
No! No! Ow!

150
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,637
All right, Sun-Yi.

151
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,540
Thanks for everything.
We'll see you next week.

152
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,140
Bye, Lisa.

153
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,809
-Bye, Mr. Ryan.
-Okay, Mister.

154
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,711

00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,316
I'm okay, Mom.

180
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,755
All right. It's okay.

181
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,293
Josh.

182
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,869
<i>Joshua!</i>

183
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,105
<i>God, it smells</i>
<i>like something died in there.</i>

184
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,173
<i>How am I supposed</i>
<i>to get that out?</i>

185
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,941
<i>Great. Perfect excuse</i>
<i>to get rid of it.</i>

186
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,810
<i>That's awesome, Kendall.</i>

194
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,410
We are so over.

195
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,012
-I'm dying.
-Why do we do it?

196
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,147
Killing ourselves
to hold back Father Time

197
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,884
for what, a few more months?
Why do anything? I don't know.

198
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:13,418
Be healthy, I guess.

199
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,921
Be healthy, my ass.
It's not about being healthy.

200
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:17,622
It's about being hot,

201
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:21,492
and hot, skinny bitch,
is in our rear-view mirror.

202
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,294
Speak for yourself.

203
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,063
I mean,
don't get me wrong.

204
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,131
Look at you.
You're amazing.

205
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,466
But that's not what
keeps your hubby

206
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,934
from chasing
after 17-year-olds.

207
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,970
It's state divorce law
that does that shit.

208
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:35,006
Yeah, if it weren't for that
juicy hunk of asada

209
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,942
in the front row,
I would not be keeping up

210
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:38,409
with this torture.

211
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,979
Okay, you know he could
sue you for sexual harassment

212
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,114
for shoving your business
in his face.

213
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,216
Are you kidding me?
He is making his way

214
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,118
through that class
like a stomach flu.

215
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,219
I'm just hoping
he gets to my row

216
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,122
before I have a massive coronary
and peace out, yo.

217
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,425
Your sister,

218
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,427
she's gonna pop one out, huh?

219
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,329
Yeah, good luck with that.

220
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,631
God, I need a real drink.

221
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,333
I saw Riley changing in front
of the mirror the other day,

222
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,068
and I started to hate her
a little.

223
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,536
She's my daughter.
I should be proud,

224
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,171
but all I could think was,
"One day,

225
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,408
those tits are gonna drop,
you little whore."

226
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,911
-Is that wrong?
-That's funny.

227
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,479
-I could have sworn--
-What?

228
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,148
That I got 100
from the ATM yesterday.

229
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,050
Oh, don't worry
about it. I got this.

230
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,118
Yeah.
No, it's just weird.

231
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,686
I don't know
what I could have done with it.

232
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,521
I don't know
about your little angels,

233
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,457
but mine steals from me
every chance she gets.

234
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,060
-No.
-She's a bitch.

235
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,100
Does anybody know
what this means?

236
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,570
Anyone? Bueller? No?

237
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,005
It refers to products designed

238
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,708
with a predetermined,
limited life span.

239
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,345
Products that are
literally built to die,

240
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,680
that is, to become unfashionable

241
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,282
or nonfunctional
in a certain amount of time.

242
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,984
-See exhibit A.
-Excuse me.

243
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,485
That's actually
the new one.

244
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,287
You are dexterously
missing my point,

245
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,723
and making it at exactly
the same time.

246
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,225
See, the idea is to manipulate

247
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,127
the consumer...

248
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,562
...to constantly want to buy

249
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,064
-the new one.
-Yeah, duh.

250
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,565
Of course, there's
an argument to be made

251
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,035
in favor of--
What's this? What is it?

252
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,503
- Planned obsolescence.
- Planned obsolescence.

253
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,173
That's right.
Without getting rid of the old,

254
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,175
you might never embrace the new.

255
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,243
The need
to continuously replace,

256
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,013
it forces us
to accelerate progress.

257
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,982
The same thing
can happen in nature.

258
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,483
Hold that thought.

259
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,051
Yep?

260
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,721
Sure.

261
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,156
Peña, you need to go
to the office.

262
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,758
Where was I?
You were saying how we were

263
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,361
the new and improved version
of last year's class.

264
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,196
That's funny.

265
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,198
Oh.

266
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,667
Really?

267
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,769
Yes?

268
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,143
Okay.

269
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,679
I understand.

270
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,716
All right.

271
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,489
Jenson... they need you
in the office, too. I'm sorry.

272
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,189
What's going on?

273
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,792
Chapter 12.
Everyone, let's go. Come on.

274
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,117
Problem?

275
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,590
What's the rush today?

276
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,826
We still have over an hour.

277
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,094
Look at 'em.

278
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:46,264
Looks like they're waiting
for a buffet.

279
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,240
My mom is such a penis.
She is killing me.

280
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,443
She just won't let go
of that shit last weekend.

281
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:02,080
I'm totally cut off.
No credit, no ATM.

282
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,748
Can't even get any
of my birthday money.

283
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,149
-Can't you ask your dad?
-Nah.

284
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,117
He direct deposits
in my account.

285
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,287
It's not like he can just fly in
and drop me a hundo.

286
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,089
He's in, like, Europe
or something.

287
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,290
I don't know.
Fuck that dude.

288
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,426
Besides, I got you, fam.

289
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,232
Seriously, you're not gonna
wash your hands?

290
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,136
Oh.

291
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,112
We are gonna
get fucked up! Fucked up!

292
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,414
Put that down! Here.
Put it in your bag.

293
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:39,650
Let's go.

294
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,654
Whoa.
This is not normal. Whoa!

295
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:47,458
Watch where you're going,
fucking ham beast!

296
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,860
Come on.

297
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,896
Jesus.

298
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,532
Whoa, Riley,
look at that.

299
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,668
Let me go!

300
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,571
-Is that McKenna's mom?
-Let me go!

301
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,606
No! Get off!

302
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,274
Let me go!

303
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:06,444
Get off of me!

304
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,314
<i>♪ Soul hurting</i>

305
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,291
<i>♪ Soul hurting</i>

306
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,602
You're finished?

307
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,905
You know there's still
20 minutes left.

308
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:34,539
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,574
And the score's pretty important
to your future.

310
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,676
I took a lot of practice tests.

311
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,544
Why are the buses here?

312
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,946
This isn't a fucking bomb scare.

313
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,614
-Come on.
-Back up. Back up.

314
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:17,448
No, I'm not gonna back up.

315
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,384
We can't send these kids home.
We don't know what's happened!

316
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,288
What are they doing here?

317
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,792
Come on, honey.
Mom's here. Let's go.

318
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,461
Back up! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

319
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,496
-Do you see your mom?
-Yeah, right.

320
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,332
If ISIS dropped a bomb
on this place,

321
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,333
she'd be so stoked.

322
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,501
Come on over.
Evan, let's go.

323
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,803
Evan. Evan.

324
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,739
This is my kid!
You're not gonna tell me what--

325
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,774
-Back up!
-Touch me again, I'll--

326
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:44,775
Get the fuck back!

327
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,812
Evan. Evan!
Evan, let's go now!

328
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,881
Right now.
Come on. Let's go!

329
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,751
Hold that kid!

330
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,920
No!

331
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,423
Whoa, dude, check it out.

332
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,427
What in the actual fuck?

333
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,020
We gotta go.

334
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,846
My car. I drove today.

335
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,668
I told you to fucking stay back!

336
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,973
Hey, Mrs. Beasley.

337
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,842
Where's Amanda?

338
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,112
She's inside.

339
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,118
<i>Commissioner?</i>
<i>Commissioner?</i>

340
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,120
Look, look, at this time,

341
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:12,490
the last thing we want to do
is disseminate any information

342
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:15,393
that may not be accurate,
and compound the problem.

343
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,527
<i>Is it true</i>
<i>that the murderers</i>

344
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,396
and the victims are related?
<i>Can you at least--</i>

345
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,765
<i>Some of that information</i>
<i>may be correct, but...</i>

346
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,466
Fuck.

347
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,101
Come on, Dad.

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,773
<i>Do you have kids, sir?</i>
<i>Do you know where they are?</i>

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,975
<i>I do,</i>

350
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,009
I intend to see them very soon.

You gotta tell us the truth!

354
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,115
Tell us what's really going--

355
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,446
Dad?

356
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,920
Dad! What-- what the fuck, man?

357
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,557
Don't--
Please don't do this again!

358
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,693
It's me. It's your son.
It's Damon!

359
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,803
Ain't you had enough
of that shit?

360
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,680
Dad.

361
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,650
Put the bottle down.

362
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,019
What the fuck?

363
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,799
Dad!

364
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,536
No!

365
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,543
Dad!

366
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,945
No, Dad! No!

367
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,612
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>about your little angels...</i>

368
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,018
Carly?

369
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,220
...but mine steals from me

370
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,022
<i>every chance she gets.</i>

371
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,833
<i>Well, look at you.</i>

372
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,802
Look at you.

373
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:16,640
-Two kids.
-I know. Ugh, hard to believe.

374
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,876
And you have

375
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,278
-none?
-Can't wrap my head around it.

376
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,146
Look, you either die single,

377
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:25,950
or you live long enough
to see yourself become a cliché.

378
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,319
Stupid.

379
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:30,154
Ugh. So it's the best, huh?

380
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:35,159
It is, but they need you less
and less...

381
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,060
and...

382
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,228
that's sort of
why I'm here today.

383
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:43,901
Remember how you said
if ever I want to get back in...

384
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,105
Oh, Kendall, that was, what,
like, 15 years ago?

385
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:52,309
Uh, yeah,
that's the "ever" part.

386
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,046
Look,

387
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:59,650
Kendall, you are always
a rock star to me,

388
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:03,087
but this isn't something you can
just jump back into.

389
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:06,624
I get it. You're going crazy,
kids.

390
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,792
Crazy? Wow.

391
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:12,029
Maybe take some classes.

392
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:17,668
-Classes?
-Yeah. Something fun.

393
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,724
Tell me.

394
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,359
Oh, my God.

395
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,194
Are you sure?

396
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,830
Okay, okay.

397
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,133
I'll meet you at the hospital.

398
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,036
Yep.

399
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,379
God damn it!

400
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,458
Yeah,
like he's gonna stop.

401
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,326
I don't know. We're supposed
to be in class, aren't we?

402
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:19,063
World War Z just broke out
at our school. I'm pretty sure

403
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,865
nobody's gonna care
that we left early.

404
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,344
Where's the remote? We gotta
find out what's going on.

405
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:37,948
Yo, shit was
fucking retarded.

406
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,185
Oh, man. I need to light up.

407
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,958
<i>What we had prayed...</i>

408
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,292
Found it.

409
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,794
...was an isolated incident
is apparently far from it,

410
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,797
as multiple reports
are now coming in

411
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,200
of similar attacks
across the country.

412
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:59,236
<i>We can hardly believe</i>
<i>what we are reporting to you</i>

413
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,138
<i>based on the videos</i>
<i>that are flooding in,</i>

414
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,110
<i>and we want to warn you,</i>
<i>this footage is very graphic.</i>

415
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:09,513
Fucking needed that.

416
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:12,249
-Hey, you want a drink, bitch?
-Yeah.

417
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,252
I mean, fuck no!
Dude, get in here!

418
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,170
But what we know is this.

419
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:34,238
-What the fuck?
<i>-Multiple incidents</i>

420
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,341
are being reported
of parents attacking...

421
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:42,279
and, in many cases,
murdering their own children.

422
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,547
Riley!

423
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,522
Mom?

424
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:53,257
Are you okay?

425
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,327
I spilled my drink.

426
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,197
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>many viewers are unfamiliar</i>

427
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,899
<i>with a phenomenon</i>
<i>known as "savaging."</i>

428
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,201
It's actually somewhat common
in the animal kingdom.

429
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:06,270
For instance,
in a domestic pig population,

430
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:08,372
as anyone involved in raising
livestock will tell you--

431
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,207
Excuse me.
You are talking about pigs?

432
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:13,210
There are children dying,
and you're talking about pigs.

433
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,478
Well, yes. In fact,
around 50 percent

434
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,981
of the piglet fatalities seen
is due to the mother attacking

435
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,350
or crushing
the newborn pre-weaned babies,

436
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,519
and no one can say
exactly why they do it.

437
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:25,889
<i>Again, we have</i>
<i>to emphasize, we have no idea</i>

438
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,958
what set off the incidents,
<i>and authorities</i>

439
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,328
<i>have so far refused</i>
<i>to issue any statement.</i>

440
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,864
All we know is what we are...

441
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,032
Riley?

442
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,038
Riley, I swear to God,

443
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,508
if you're messing with me,
I'll kill you.

444
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,060
Hey, kiddo.

445
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,596
<i>Dr. Torres,</i>
<i>please dial...</i>

446
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,067
<i>All right,</i>
<i>but isn't it a fact</i>

447
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,502
that we still have no real idea
<i>what is causing this?</i>

448
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:13,937
<i>It could be</i>
<i>a natural phenomenon,</i>

449
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:18,242
<i>but let's just postulate</i>
<i>someone wants to wipe us out,</i>

450
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:19,610
<i>so they create</i>
<i>a biological weapon</i>

451
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:25,182
or a neurotoxin which attacks
a very hard-wired human impulse,

452
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,083
which is to protect our young.

453
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:29,186
Any parent would rush out
in front of a speeding car,

454
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:31,488
<i>or an oncoming train</i>
<i>or even a wild animal</i>

455
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,991
<i>to save their child,</i>
<i>but if you could take</i>

456
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:37,094
that natural human impulse
<i>and reverse it,</i>

457
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,495
you wouldn't have
to wipe us out,

458
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,464
because at that point,
we ourselves

459
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,499
would be wiping out
our own future.

460
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:43,567
Kendall!

461
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,904
Oh, Jeannie!
It's about time, woman!

462
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:47,571
-Damn.
-Are you the father?

463
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,239
-No, I'm the--
-No, he's the boyfriend.

464
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,008
It's complicated. Dan the man.

465
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,644
I hope you remembered
to bring your camera.

466
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,581
Motherfucker!
I can't do this! I can't!

467
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,084
Dan, Dan, are you sure
you don't want to wait outside?

468
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,054
This might be a little more
than you signed up for.

469
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,056
This thing is fucked up!

470
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:09,593
Holy fucking shit!
How have you done this twice?

471
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,328
- You're inhuman.
- Easy there.

472
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,329
Less talking. More breathing.

473
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:13,397
- Okay.
- We're almost there.

474
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,432
80 percent dilated.
She's good to go, Doctor.

475
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,101
- Hey, I know it hurts. I know.
- This fucking sucks!

476
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,470
I know this hurts, Mama,
but trust me.

477
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,272
The second you see
that beautiful baby

478
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,242
and hear that voice,
everything will just disappear.

479
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:28,378
It's some kind of magic,
okay? Trust me.

480
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,012
It will go away.

481
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,281
It's probably
just the drugs kicking in.

482
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,083
No, no, Jeannie.
It's something else.

483
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:37,454
It's-- It's love kicking in,
okay? So just let it come.

484
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,655
And push!

485
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,590
Do you mind? Do you mind?

486
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,562
Are you getting this?
Get this.

487
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:48,532
Good job, Mama.

488
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,168
Look at that beautiful girl!

489
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,539
Very strong voice.

490
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:59,142
I bet Mommy wants
to hold her daughter.

491
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,542

493
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,346
Jeannie, you're
holding her too tight.

494
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,347
- Stop.
- Stop, Jeannie.

495
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,116

00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:21,485
My dad's at work,
and my mom is--

528
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,688
She's at the gym with...

529
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,324
We have to go.
We have to go right now!

530
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,318
Hey, um--

531
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,654
I'm not taking any calls,
all right?

532
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,855
<i>What about your wife?</i>

533
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:02,726
Oh, especially not.

534
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:20,443
God damn it, Brent.

535
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,579
It's okay. It's okay.

536
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:25,549
Excuse me, ma'am.
You're the mother's sister?

537
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,217
Yes. Is she okay?

538
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:30,220
She's fine.
She's been sedated.

539
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,521
Sedated.

540
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,858
We need to ask
for the baby.

541
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,494
No. I think I need
to keep her close with me.

542
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:40,230
Ma'am, I need you
to give her the child.

543
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:41,198
But this is my family.

544
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,600
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but we must insist.

545
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:46,303
It's for the child's safety.

546
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,804
Please understand.

547
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,906
No. No.

548
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,643
What is this?
What is going on here?

549
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:56,913
We're not sure,
but until we know more,

550
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,249
we need to protect
the children.

551
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:01,618
Oh...

552
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,555

564
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:53,570
How 'bout your sister?
Did she have the baby?

569
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:04,581
He's hiding
around here somewhere.

570
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:07,617
Okay, is-- is Mr. Ryan home?

571
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,852
<i>No. He go to work.</i>

572

573
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,990
<i>No, Ms. Ryan.</i>
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

574
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:17,327
No. Listen, I am coming home.

575
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,500
Whose car is that?

576
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,368
The housekeeper's.

577
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,971
My dad doesn't get home
'til late.

578
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,907
All right, let's do this fast.
We're gonna go in.

579
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,409
We're gonna get
your little brother,

580
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,411
and get the hell out, okay?

581
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,713
Okay.

582
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,622
Sun-Yi?

583
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:48,058
Carly, you're home.

584
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,693
Why you not at school?

585
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:50,660
We left early today.

586
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,830
Okay. Come here.
I make you the lunch.

587
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,398
That's your boyfriend?

588
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,367
Mr. Ryan say no boyfriend
in the house.

589
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:58,468
You understand me?

590
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,738
We're only here for a minute,
okay? Uh, where's Joshua?

591
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,605
In his room.

592
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:06,710
I don't know
why he's not come out.

593
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,511
Oh, my God.

594
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,884
I can't get this stain
out of the floor!

595
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,053
No, you need-- you need--
you need to leave, okay?

596
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,121
You need to go right now.

597
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,989
I clean the mess,
and then I go.

598
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,024
No! You need
to leave right now!

599
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,727
Don't worry about the cleaning!
Just get out of the house!

600
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:26,096
- Go get your brother.
- Get out!

601
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,067
You want the lunch, kid?

602
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,904
I'm good.

603
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,806
Everybody so crazy today.

604
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:39,542
I don't understand
why they so crazy today.

605
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,643
I don't clean the kitchen.

606
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,979
I don't know
who's clean the kitchen.

607
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,792
<i>Josh?</i>

608
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,128
Where are you, bro?

609
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,166
Hey, are you okay?

610
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,438
Lisa.

611
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,874
Something bad happened to Lisa.

612
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:11,641
I know. I know. I know.

613
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:14,010
In Chinese... I didn't--
She didn't do anything wrong.

614
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,478
-I know, okay? I know.
-Why'd she do it?

615
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,181
Just listen to me.
I know. I know you're scared.

616
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:20,517
But we have
to get out of the house

617
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,186
before Mom and Dad come home.

618
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,165
<i>I think it's</i>
<i>horrible what's happening.</i>

619
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,735
- <i>Yes.</i>
<i>- I only wish that I...</i>

620
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,950
<i>Intellectually,</i>
<i>I should feel devastated.</i>

621
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,718
<i>This should be</i>
<i>the most awful thing</i>

622
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,620
that could happen to anybody.

623
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:58,855
<i>I get that...</i>

624
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:01,090
<i>but it's just not.</i>

625
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:04,961
<i>Look...</i>

626
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,163
<i>I'm trying to summon up</i>
<i>some crocodile tears for you</i>

627
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:10,133
<i>just so you don't think</i>
<i>I'm a monster...</i>

628
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,535
<i>but I can't.</i>

629
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,504
<i>So you think it's good,</i>

630
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:15,872
<i>what's happening?</i>

631
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,640
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

632
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,110
I think it's horrible
what's happening.

633
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,680
But for you...

634
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:24,881
It was exactly right.

635
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:27,183
What the hell
are you doing here?

636
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,521
It's not what you think,
Mr. Ryan.

637
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,490
What are you doing
in my house?

638
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,625
Is my daughter here?

639
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,594
Carly? Joshua?

640
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:38,928
Is that Dad? I want Dad.

641
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,763
No, we have to leave,
God damn it.

642
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,099
-I need to get my backpack.
-Why?

643
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:43,833
Fine. Just get it.

644
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,134
Mr. Ryan, we--
we need to talk, sir.

645
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,569
Oh, do we need to talk?

646
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,972
Yeah, we do need to talk.
You can't be here.

647
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:50,139
This is not about me and Carly.

648
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:53,943
-It's about what's happening.
-I get exactly...

649
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,746
...what's happening.

650
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,248
It's called hormones.

651
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,749
Shh.

652
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,652
Yeah, believe it or not,
I used to be young once, too,

653
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:05,288
and actually,
not all that long ago,

654
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,124
by the way. And I think
about how things were

655
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,959
-in my day.
-Mr. Ryan--

656
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,094
But now...

657
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,096
the world you kids
are living in,

658
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:15,231

659

You bought a pool table?

I mean,
Christmas is coming up.

701
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,734
Do you really think
this is the right time

702
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:06,903
to start building a man cave
in the basement?

703
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,939
It's not a man cave, Kendall.

704
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,274
Jesus!

705
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:15,378
I just thought, you know,
like-- like a family room.

706
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,779
The whole house
is a family room.

707
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,981
Okay. You see, I got a problem
with that one right there,

708
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,917
because I bust my ass six days
a week

709
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:21,984
trying to pay this place down,

710
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,286
and it's like
a fucking obstacle course

711
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:24,887
trying to get out
the fucking front door.

712
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,756
I mean, one of these days,
I'm gonna trip over

713
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:27,857
one of Josh's toys
and take a nose dive

714
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:29,425
-straight to the emergency room.
-What are you saying?

715
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:32,361
I'm saying that maybe we need
to have boundaries.

716
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,197
I'm saying that
maybe there needs to be

717
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,001
a fucking grown-up zone,
and a fucking kid zone!

718
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,370
Brent... honey...

719
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,939
you think I want to be the one

720
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:44,307
to piss all over
your family room?

721
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,008
Do you think
I want to be the one

722
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,345
who has to build
a fucking family room?

723
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,284
Perfect. Yeah.

724
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:56,119
Okay. Well,

725
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:58,988
let me see if I can take care
of this for you, sweetheart.

726
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,759
Yeah, I think I have something.
I have just the right thing.

727
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,130
Oh, yeah!

728
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:09,132
♪ You put your right foot in

729
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,200
♪ You take your right foot out ♪

730
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:12,468
♪ You do the hokey-pokey ♪

731
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,171
<i>♪ And you fuckin'</i>
<i>Work it all out ♪</i>

732
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,874
Brent, stop.

733
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,847
And you do the hokey-pokey,

734
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:28,117
and you turn yourself around!

735
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,092
That's what it's all about!

736
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,935
There you go.

737
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,303
Problem solved.

738
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:50,306
You're right, honey.
I hate pool.

739
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,347
Not a big fan
of machine-part sales either.

740
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,850
Trying to hit quotas
down there, be a big man.

741
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:04,020
Not exactly what I had in mind
as a young dude, you know.

742
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:07,356
Bright future. Everything
in the world to look forward to.

743
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,560
I mean, I was gonna grab
the world by the balls

744
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:13,029
and squeeze, boy!

745
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,166
God damn it! I remember
that kid I used to be

746
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,235
like it was
four fucking minutes ago!

747
00:47:19,237 --> 00:47:21,938
My feet barely touched
the ground back then.

748
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,539
My kill ratio
was nine out of ten!

749
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,107
It was 100 percent sex.

750
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:28,444
But that guy, in a million years
could never have pictured

751
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:32,215
this tired motherfucker
he turned out to be!

752
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,917
Flat on his ass,
fat, bald,

753
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:36,953
cottage-cheese fucking ass,

754
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:39,155
Blue Bonnet butter
waistline,

755
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:42,225
with hair coming out
of my ears, my nose.

756
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:45,595
And my salary went
from 145,000 dollars

757
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:47,530
to 45,000 dollars!

758
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:51,067
Yeah, building
a fucking man cave!

759
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:52,268
That's right.

760
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,970
You're right!

761
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,645
I mean,
does any of this make any sense

762
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,213
to you at all?

763
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,350
Of course it does.

764
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,654
I mean...

765
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:13,356
it's not that...

766
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,358
as a woman...

767
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,261
you don't have...

768
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,364
career dreams,

769
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,499
relationship dreams.

770
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,969
I did. I had all that...

771
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,239
but there's this bigger thing.

772
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,677
All your life,
you know it's coming.

773
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,648
And there's this mix
of anxiety and...

774
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,517
secret excitement...

775
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,187
and terror...

776
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,424
because you know that one day...

777
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,359
inevitably...

778
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,995
you'll create this life.

779
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:56,499
The hugeness of it,
the importance of it...

780
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:00,569
everything is building
to that moment.

781
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,972
And then...

782
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,474
it happens.

783
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:10,212
And no matter what you thought
it would be...

784
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,182
it's not like that.

785
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,086
I mean, it's intense.

786
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:20,456
It's fucking bat-shit,
but it's not...

787
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,626
It doesn't...

788
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,397
Anyways, it is what it is.

789
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,369
Just something that happens,
and then it's...

790
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,304
Then it's over.

791
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,673
Yeah.

792
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,712
I know this is the way
things are supposed to be.

793
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,648
I-- I know we're doing it right.

794
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,318
It's just hard to get
my head around, you know?

795
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,054
I mean, I used to be Brent...

796
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,757
and you used to be Kendall...

797
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,626
and now we're just...

798
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,630
Mom and Dad.

799
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,378
Fuck!

800
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:16,112
Come on!

801
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:18,214
<i>The origin of threat</i>
<i>is still being determined,</i>

802
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:20,383
but what we are being told
<i>by authorities</i>

803
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:22,451
is that we are under attack.

804
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:27,023
<i>To anyone</i>
<i>in earshot of this broadcast,</i>

805
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:30,559
the message is, you are going
<i>to want to go to them.</i>

806
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:31,627
It's your natural instinct

807
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,397
in the middle of a crisis,
<i>is to protect them,</i>

808
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,533
<i>but do not go</i>
<i>near your children.</i>

809
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,389
Are you all right?

810
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,294
Took a header.

811
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,630
Must have blacked out.

812
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,733
You're home early.

813
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:46,869
So are you.

814
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,345
They're in the basement.

815
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,551
Carly?

816
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,253
<i>Joshua?</i>

817
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,422
<i>-Can you hear me?</i>
<i>-Mom?</i>

818
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:07,423
Dude, shh.

819
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:10,826
<i>Yes, it's Mommy.</i>
<i>Mommy's here.</i>

820
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,195
<i>Is your sister with you?</i>

821
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,499
-Yeah, Mom, I'm here.
-Oh, thank God.

822
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,200
Are you two all right?

823
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,804
Mom...

824
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,639
I stole the money...

825
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,541
from your purse.

826
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,510
I'm so sorry. I--

827
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:29,745
Riley, she just said
that she needed it,

828
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,547
and then her...

829
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:33,716
her mom...

830
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:34,550
It's okay, honey.

831
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:38,254
I understand. You must have had
a very good reason...

832
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,689
but that's not what this
is about.

833
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,291
Now I want you to unbolt
the door,

834
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:45,928
and I want you and your brother
to come out of that basement.

835
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,630
<i>Do you understand?</i>

836
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:51,534
No, Mom, we're not coming out,
okay? You have to leave.

837
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,436
<i>You-- you need to leave</i>
<i>the house, you and Dad!</i>

838
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:58,908
Your motherfucking mother
said to open this door!

839
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,276
And, motherfuckers,

840
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:04,380
you're going to open
this motherfucking door!

841
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,858
Carly.

842
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:17,893
Not so helpful.

843
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,663
Joshie.

844
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,666
All right.
Let's try it this way.

845
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:25,534
Where are you going?

846
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,656
That's not gonna cut
through this door.

847
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:49,558
The hell it won't.

848
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:50,993
It's a Sawzall.

849
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:53,462
That means it saws all.

850
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:56,765
Ah, well, you know,
educate me.

851
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,611
Fuck this.

852
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,980
I'm tired of messing around
with this shit.

853
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:12,815
You want to get things done?

854
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,383
Huh?

855
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:16,652
I'll get things done.

856
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,260
Mom! Please don't!

857
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:25,894
Please.

858
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:30,699
What the fuck?

859
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,420
Aw, shit!

860
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:54,323
Got a fucking explanation
for this?

861
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:54,990
You really went all in

862
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,992
on the midlife crisis thing,
didn't you?

863
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,394
A fucking handgun?
Really?

864
00:54:58,396 --> 00:55:01,363
Well, I mean, some psycho
could break into the house.

865
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:02,731
How am I supposed to defend us?

866
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:06,035
You do realize
that one in five children

867
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:09,571
and adolescents injured
involve firearms!

868
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:11,373
It was in a locked case.

869
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,509
What was the combination?

870
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,445
Josh's birthday.

871
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,921
Who wants to die today?

872
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,858
Speak! Speak!

873
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,493
Come on.

874
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,697
What a jerk you are.

875
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:39,835
Damn it!

876
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:42,604
Forget it.

877
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:44,073
I have an idea.

878
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,776
Want to get me something
for this?

879
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,912
Oh, you bet I will.

880
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:54,516
Okay,
just get some alcohol.

881
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,685
Alcohol? Okay.

882
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:57,953
Just alcohol. Okay.

883
00:55:57,955 --> 00:56:00,456
Maybe I should try
to take the bullet out first.

884
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,125
Are you fucking kidding me?
No! No. Leave it.

885
00:56:03,127 --> 00:56:04,827
I just don't want it
to get infected.

886
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:06,028
-Just leave it.
-Okay.

887
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,630
You ready?
One, two, three, go.

888
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,038
What-- what was that?

889
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:16,805
It sounded like Mom.

890
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:19,975
All right. okay, okay.

891
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,944
Opening. Don't hurt your teeth.

892
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,011
Okay, okay.

893
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,914
Okay. Okay. Okay. Ow! Fuck!

894
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:28,450
All right.

895
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:32,054
All right, okay. Here we go.
All right. And...

896
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,922
one,

897
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:35,691
two...

898
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,493
three...

899
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:38,560
five, six.

900
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,963
Do you think Dad's hurting her?

901
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,132
I don't know.

902
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,402
I don't think so. I think...

903
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,539
I think
they only want to hurt us.

904
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,176
Don't worry.

905
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:55,411
Everything's gonna be okay,

906
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:57,913
'cause whatever's happening
out there...

907
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,848
it's gonna pass.

908
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,050
But until then...

909
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,852
we're safe here, okay?

910
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:05,554
No one can get in.

911
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,556

What?

931
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:47,723
- Just wait here.
- Okay.

932
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,142
What the fuck?

933
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,183
I found Lisa outside...

934
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:52,354
by the bins. That explains
the mess in the kitchen.

935
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,822
Ah.

936
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,224
I was wondering about that.

937
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:57,726
Hmm.

938
00:59:57,728 --> 00:59:59,962
How long do you think
it'll take?

939
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,196
I don't know.

940
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:03,131
It's a big basement.

941
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,667
We should hear them coughing.

942
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,769
Throwing up.

943
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:14,209
After that, we should be good
to cut the door down.

944
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,305
Josh, are you okay?

945
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:44,206
Hey...

946
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,907
listen to me, okay?

947
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,776
You gotta stay with me...

948
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:48,910
okay?

949
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:50,812
You have to stay with me.

950
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,016
I don't know
why this is happening...

951
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:55,951
and I don't know--

952
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:58,086
I don't know
what we could have done

953
01:00:58,088 --> 01:00:59,955
or not done to change it.

954
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,825
But the fact is that...

955
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,062
is that Mom and Dad
want to hurt us.

956
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,967
They want to kill us.

957
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,871
Okay, but we're not gonna
let that happen, all right?

958
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,176
We're gonna get out of here.

959
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:36,384
You gonna hurt them?

960
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:39,187
Shh. Stay down. Go back.

961
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,323
Your nose.

962
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,127
Shh.

963
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,270
Do it.

964
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,874
Come on.

965
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,434
Come on.

966
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,350
Ah! Fuck!

967
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,991
I don't see 'em.

968
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,139
Stand back.

969
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,213
Stay. Stay.

970
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:28,183
Damn it, Carly! Get back here!

971
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,762
<i>Mom, no! Stop!</i>

972
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,531
Stop! Mom!

973
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,076
Hey.

974
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:55,710
Mommy...

975
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:58,646
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

976
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,383
Oh, no, no. No, honey.

977
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,550
Honey, it's okay.

978
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:05,487
You don't ever have to be afraid
of me.

979
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:09,524
Oh, look how beautiful you are.

980
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,193
You did a good job.

981
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,295
Here.

982
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,465
Just a kiss of it.

983
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:20,035
There's your angel cheeks.

984
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,604
Thank you for making me pretty,
Mommy.

985
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:25,373
Oh, honey, you were born
that way.

986
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:31,179
There is nothing I want more
in this world than to see you...

987
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,616
Honey.

988
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:36,584
Mom. No!

989
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,631
Mrs. Ryan, no!

990
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,205
- Carly.
- No!

991
01:07:57,207 --> 01:08:00,108
Mom! No! No!

992
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,377
- Let go of me!
- No!

993
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,279
No. No, no, no.

994
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:06,147
Baby, baby,
Carly, it's okay.

995
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:08,450
Shh. Shh. It's okay.

996
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,590
- Mom!
- It's okay, Carly.

997
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,100
No!

998
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,704
Holy shit!

999
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,706
Mom, stop!

1000
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,823
It's usually not this bad.

1001
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,403
I used to think
my parents getting divorced

1002
01:09:02,405 --> 01:09:04,305
was the hugest tragedy
of my life,

1003
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:08,543
but ironically, that shit
doubled my chance of survival.

1004
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:17,852
Where's Mom?

1005
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:20,889
What?

1006
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,825
Mom, stop it!
You're gonna hurt them!

1007
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,326
Mom!

1008
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:27,795
No!

1009
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:32,200
No! Mom, stop!

1010
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:34,669
No!

1011
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:41,309
Damon?

1012
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,685
Mom, please, no!

1013
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:00,695
Come on.

1014
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:02,297
Josh, come on.

1015
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:07,969
Stop!

1016
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,979
Sawzall.

1017
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,848
Means it...

1018
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,351
saws...

1019
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:24,619
all.

1020
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,957
Daddy, please, no.

1021
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,863
I'm sorry I said
that you have no life, okay?

1022
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,532
I'm sorry
that we don't talk anymore.

1023
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,300
I'm sorry
that we're not best friends--

1024
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:41,769
-Shh!
-Mom, we're a family.

1025
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:42,570
We love each other.

1026
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:43,838
When they can't stand
each other,

1027
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,774
-they give a shit.
-Whatever. Whatever.

1028
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:48,776
Saws...

1029
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:50,645
all.

1030
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:55,984
Close your eyes, bro.
Close your eyes.

1031
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:03,424
No! Stop!

1032
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:08,930
Shit.

1033
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:11,399
I forgot. Your parents.

1034
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,468
That was tonight?

1035
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,572
God damn it.

1036
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,810
Just a sec.

1037
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:28,283
<i>All right, all right.</i>
<i>Hold your horses. Jesus!</i>

1038
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,685
Mom, Dad, listen.

1039
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:41,696
Dad!

1040
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,704
Oh! Holy shit!

1041
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,006
Dad! You killed me!

1042
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:53,975
You fucking killed me!

1043
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:55,643
Nah, bullshit.

1044
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,945
I missed your gut, crybaby.

1045
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,815
- I'm gonna get you now.
- Grandpa!

1046
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:06,354
Please don't hurt Dad anymore.
Please.

1047
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:07,689
Hey!

1048
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:09,791
There's my little piss
and vinegar.

1049
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:30,978
Mom?

1050
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,453
Get your hands off me.

1051
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,490
No!

1052
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:45,560
You do not want to kill Brent.

1053
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,628
Brent is your son.

1054
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:57,138
As if you ever gave a shit
about him.

1055
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:00,775
You were never good enough
for him.

1056
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:03,010
You're a whore.

1057
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:06,514
Kendall's not even a real name!

1058
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:15,022
Dad, what are you doing?

1059
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:16,724
No! Dad!

1060
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,831
Well...

1061
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,800
you fucked up, son...

1062
01:13:25,802 --> 01:13:28,870
but what if I told you
I fucked up even worse?

1063
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:30,705
-How?
-Did you know

1064
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:31,639
that once upon a time,

1065
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,908
the Firebird
was Grandpa Mel's car?

1066
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,910
It's true.
He bought it brand-new in '79

1067
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:39,547
right off the line,
used his V.A. settlement.

1068
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:40,982
Man, that car was his baby.

1069
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:42,517
When I was little,
I used to watch him

1070
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:45,052
polish it on the front lawn
every weekend.

1071
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:46,821
And by the time I turned
into a dumb,

1072
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:48,055
horny, pimple-faced
high school kid

1073
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:50,958
just like you're gonna be,
it was officially a classic.

1074
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,528
So long story short,
I stole the keys,

1075
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:54,862
picked up my girlfriend.

1076
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:56,831
Yeah,
this is before I met your mom.

1077
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,199
Took it out for a little spin.

1078
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:03,938
Pretty much totaled
the motherfucker.

1079
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,174
Cool.

1080
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,009
Well, Mel didn't think so.

1081
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:10,211
I thought
he was gonna crush my skull.

1082
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:11,446
But you know what he did?

1083
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,815
He sold it to me.
And it wasn't cheap either.

1084
01:14:13,817 --> 01:14:17,018
I'd have to pay him back
every dime he put into it.

1085
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,519
And if I wanted
to drive my senior year,

1086
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:20,455
I better learn how to fix a car.
So I did.

1087
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:21,989
I spent the whole summer
working two jobs,

1088
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:23,925
paid back my dad.
"Here's ten dollars, Dad.

1089
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:26,994
Here's 20 dollars, Dad.
Here's 100 dollars, Dad."

1090
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:27,995
By the end of the summer,

1091
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:30,765
I had that bad boy cherried out
from the ground up.

1092
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:33,201
Now, you talk
about a pussy magnet.

1093
01:14:33,203 --> 01:14:36,237
- Dad.
- Chick magnet.

1094
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,609
Your mom keeps telling me
to sell it,

1095
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:43,911
but I just can't bear
to let her go.

1096
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:45,246
Is that why Mom always says,

1097
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:48,516
"I can't bear to think
about what must have happened

1098
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:49,917
in that car"?

1099
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,786
Because of the accident?

1100
01:14:51,788 --> 01:14:52,820
No, no, buddy. Nah.

1101
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,156
She's talking
about something else.

1102
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,829
I'm sorry I messed up, Dad.

1103
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,164
Hey...

1104
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,700
like father, like son, right?

1105
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:09,971
But if you ever
touch that car again...

1106
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:13,107
I'll fuckin' kill you.

1107
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,777
Dad!

1108
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:18,713
No! No, Dad!

1109
01:15:18,715 --> 01:15:22,650

It's okay.

1135
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,414
I don't think so.

1136
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:09,984
Joshua,
come on, big guy.

1137
01:18:09,986 --> 01:18:13,187
Get the Sawzall.
Cut us loose.

I love you, Mom.

1144
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:09,744
Me, too.

1145
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,981
