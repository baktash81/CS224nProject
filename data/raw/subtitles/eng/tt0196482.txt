1
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:25,472
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:28,305
(rooster crowing)

3
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:34,192
(bright warm music)

4
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:47,707
- Come on, William.

5
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,707
(bright warm music)

6
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,605
If we stay here, we'll be
the first to see 'em coming.

7
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:03,605
(bright warm music)

8
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:08,540
- I'm thirsty, and so is my frog.

9
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,675
- [Janie] William!

10
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:12,675
(bright warm music)

11
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,374
- Janie, what if he never
comes and my frog dries up

12
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:42,043
and I miss lunch?

13
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:43,953
(Pat whistling)

14
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:45,912
- See anything yet?

15
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:46,999
- Not yet!

16
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,999
(bright warm music)

17
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,320
He's come, he's come!

18
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,320
(bright warm music)

19
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,791
(Danny whinnying)

20
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,373
- Whoa!

21
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,361
Meet Danny.

22
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:11,460
Well, what do you think, Janie?

23
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,580
Will Andrea like him?

24
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,841
- Oh, yes!

25
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:16,841
(bright warm music)

26
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,033
- I said keep those heels down!

27
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,450
Okay.

28
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,453
Relax!

29
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:02,594
(Danny whinnying)

30
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,029
(Danny whinnying)

31
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,970
- He's fighting me, and he
won't pick up the right lead!

32
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,123
- It's his first workout, a
new place and a new rider,

33
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,388
and you're handling him sloppily.

34
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:27,449
(dog barking)

35
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,798
(Danny whinnying)

36
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:29,631
Hold him!

37
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:34,631
(dog barking)
(dramatic tense music)

38
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:36,760
Whoa!

39
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,481
(Danny whinnying)

40
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,449
Whoa!

41
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,282
(Danny whinnying)

42
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,769
Andrea, don't you ever do that again!

43
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:49,030
(warm pensive music)

44
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,863
- Andrea?

45
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:51,030
- Janie, let her go!

46
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,113
(warm pensive music)

47
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,450
A touchy fella, this Danny, huh?

48
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,533
(warm pensive music)

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,651
Take him to his stall, Janie.

50
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,734
(warm pensive music)

51
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,157
- No use trying to tell me you're sorry.

52
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,223
We are your friends here, you know.

53
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:35,306
(warm pensive music)

54
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,450
Pat, I'm sure he won't do it again.

55
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,470
It's just that everything's so new!

56
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,190
- Maybe, or maybe Danny isn't quite

57
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,270
what we hoped he would be.

58
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,070
You know, a horse or a pony
can win every ribbon around,

59
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,590
and then, suddenly, something happens

60
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,890
and everything goes wrong.

61
00:06:58,535 --> 00:06:59,610
You know, I just hope Mr. Cummings

62
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,920
didn't get himself a
prima donna of a pony.

63
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,800
- Oh, no, Pat, he's not!

64
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,540
- Would you like to give Milady a workout?

65
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,590
- [Janie] Sure thing.

66
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:30,478
(warm pensive music)

67
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:52,182
(dog barking)

68
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:54,067
- Janie!

69
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:58,174
(dog barking)

70
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,020
Janie, how would you
like to help me get Danny

71
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,970
ready for the next show?

72
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,230
- Oh, yes!

73
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,790
He's not getting rid of Danny?

74
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,623
I was sure that when he--

75
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:18,960
- Oh, Mr. Cummings not only
agreed that you were to help,

76
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,602
he also wants you to take it
on as a job and be paid for it.

77
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,435
- Really?

78
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,630
- It's nothing much, but it is something.

79
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,430
You are now an employee
of Longue Vue Stables.

80
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,330
- Can I call my mother?

81
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,293
- You do that.

82
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,663
Well, I guess you still
need your exercise.

83
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,470
- And not only that, I'm
going to be paid for it!

84
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,453
- That's wonderful.

85
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,050
Dear, do you think you
could come home soon?

86
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,500
I need your help, Mr.
DeVito's coming for dinner.

87
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:48,943
- Yes, bye.

88
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,999
(warm pensive music)

89
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,440
- Mike, do you think it's
going to become one of those?

90
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,940
- William, I'd say he's gonna be that one.

91
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,000
Do you really think he needs
a picture to help him change?

92
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,890
- Yup.

93
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,293
- Well, maybe you're right.

94
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,870
Now, as I was saying, the
Texas I knew 15 years ago

95
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,210
was mainly oil rigs.

96
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,890
Looked like a buncha Eiffel Towers

97
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,360
smack in the middle of the cactus.

98
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,430
Boy, when I'd go into
town, there they'd be,

99
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,656
those salty Texans with
their big hats and boots.

100
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:39,875
- And guns?

101
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,820
- No, more like ice cream cones.

102
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,370
- Did you ever learn to ride a horse?

103
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,260
- Funny you should ask.

104
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,093
Would you believe it,

105
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:49,940
went to a dude ranch a couple of times.

106
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,500
Yessiree, Bob, and I got
up on a horse each time.

107
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,870
That's when I bought my
genuine lizard boots.

108
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,270
Did I ever show you my 10-gallon hat?

109
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,560
- Nope.

110
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,703
- That doesn't mean you can ride a horse.

111
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,163
- Now, that's very true.

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,850
- Mr. Cummings doesn't
have a 10-gallon hat,

113
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,944
and he doesn't wear Western boots.

114
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:11,677
- [Mike] Sounds like a lovely man.

115
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,200
- And he's very rich.

116
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,400
They own three houses and
12 horses, and now Danny.

117
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,060
- The fact that Mr. Cummings has money

118
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,260
has nothing at all to do

119
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,223
with whether or not he's a nice man.

120
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,550
- Mr. Cummings hired me to
help get Danny ready for shows.

121
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,510
- That a fact?

122
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,630
Must mean you're pretty good, Janie.

123
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,900
- Danny doesn't like Andrea.

124
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,740
- That's not so, he was just scared then!

125
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,710
He's a beautiful pony.

126
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,290
- And a lucky one, I'd say,
havin' a friend like you.

127
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,440
- Mike, before it gets dark,

128
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,630
will you let me throw a ball to you?

129
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,200
I need practice.

130
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,080
- Now, this here is one fine glove.

131
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,433
- That's my father's glove, isn't it, Mom?

132
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,470
- Janie, I'd like you
to help set the table.

133
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,400
- Well, hold on!

134
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,870
I might not be much on horses,

135
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,770
but I'm first rate at settin' a table!

136
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:11,421
(warm melancholic music)

137
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:21,242
- Dude ranch.

138
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:24,659
(warm melancholic music)

139
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:31,662
- [Kate] Janie, dinner's ready!

140
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:35,079
(warm melancholic music)

141
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,327
- He's supposed to have
won a lot of classes,

142
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,000
but of course, he'll
just be for the summer.

143
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,420
Father's already talkin' about me

144
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,070
getting a thoroughbred next year.

145
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,170
- This is Jane.

146
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,970
She's going to help me get
my pony ready for some shows,

147
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,430
and he's certainly going
to need a lot of help.

148
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,872
- He's moving just
beautifully, Andrea, ask Pat.

149
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:06,272
Aren't you gonna ride today?

150
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,620
- Will he be ready for
the Hungerford show?

151
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,900
- Well, he'd better be!

152
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,090
- He will be, Andrea, just watch!

153
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,200
- Come, Betty, I want you
to see my new riding outfit.

154
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,453
It's really gorgeous.

155
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,230
Oh, hi, Pat, you know Betty, don't you?

156
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,273
- Yes, I know her.

157
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,903
Janie!

158
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,748
Why don't you cool out Danny
and then come on with me?

159
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:39,638
- [Janie] Okay!

160
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:42,638
(bright warm music)

161
00:12:57,823 --> 00:12:59,656
- Yoo-hoo, Pat, Janie!

162
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,130
Mr. Merler's going to
help me to find a way

163
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,180
to make all of this a little less boring.

164
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,232
Mr. Merler, what would
you say to a rock garden?

165
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:12,263
Yes, a rock garden over there.

166
00:13:12,263 --> 00:13:15,263
(bright warm music)

167
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,330
- Pat, I never knew
you rode in the garden.

168
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,173
- Oh, that!

169
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,623
Hey, don't look at the
year, it sure dates me.

170
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,110
See, one of the advantages
of living alone,

171
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,910
you make your bed whenever you want.

172
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,053
- When I have my own place,
it'll be just like this.

173
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,450
- Don't think it'll get a
prize in House Beautiful.

174
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,550
How 'bout a root beer?

175
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,383
- Okay.

176
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:14,466
- Hey, here we go.

177
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,400
To you, Janie, and to the
whole crazy, wonderful world

178
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,783
of horses you've come into.

179
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:30,230
You know, that's what you've done, Janie.

180
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,230
You've become part of a world,

181
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,920
and with two kinds of horse people.

182
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,040
One kind wants glamor, fancy
clothes, being admired,

183
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,030
being part of the smart set,

184
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,410
but the other kind is totally different.

185
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,490
They love horses, no matter what or where.

186
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,627
- Even Western?

187
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,690
- That's right, even Western.

188
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,840
Not only that, work horses too!

189
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,360
The horse lover loves horses, every kind,

190
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,360
loves working with them,
caring for them, period.

191
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,593
Hey, another toast.

192
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,470
To Longue Vue and the
even more fabulous place

193
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,970
it will become,

194
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,970
if Mrs. Cummings ever gets
finished remodeling it.

195
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,160
- And to Danny.

196
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,053
- Of course, and to Danny.

197
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,510
You're doing beautifully!

198
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,210
Now, let's try him on some fences.

199
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,423
That's even better!

200
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,960
- Darling, that lovely blouse!

201
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,420
I bought that for the
party you're going to.

202
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,580
Isn't there something
else you could've worn?

203
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,580
- Oh, it's fine, how did I look?

204
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,050
- Looked pretty good to me,

205
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,630
but I'm not the one who'll be judging.

206
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,583
Andrea, you remember our talk?

207
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,370
I don't hold with doing things halfway.

208
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,600
Now, it's not going to be
like it was in the past.

209
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,682
You are giving this your full
concentration, are you not?

210
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:45,950
- Yes.

211
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,310
- See, there are winners and losers.

212
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,350
If you want to ride, you've
got to make up your mind.

213
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,993
You are a winner, agreed?

214
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,060
- Oh, Monty, you make it
sound so frightfully serious.

215
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,550
- Agreed?

216
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,650
- Agreed.

217
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,760
- What do you think, Pat, the pony ready?

218
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,200
Can we put him into a show?

219
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,060
- Only one way to find out.

220
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,070
- Good, let's do it.

221
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,280
- I do have to keep my appointment,
it's hair and nails day,

222
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,951
and you better make an appointment.

223
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,700
(Monty chuckles)

224
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,900
- I'll be taking Noble
out in about an hour.

225
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,180
- I guess we're gonna have
showtime faster than we thought.

226
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,090
- Now, see, Danny, you
just did as you were told,

227
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,840
and now you're going to be showing.

228
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,893
Isn't that great?

229
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:51,255
(muffled speaking over loudspeaker)

230
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,422
(lively music)

231
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:06,923
What do you want?

232
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:09,003
- Nothin', just thought I could help.

233
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,030
- You can see if he wants some water.

234
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,500
- What's his name?

235
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,333
- Danny.

236
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,903
- Andrea's class is next.

237
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,829
- Bye.
- Light and Lively,

238
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,210
ridden by Emily--

239
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,210
- Who's your friend?

240
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,393
- [Janie] I don't know.

241
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:43,393
(muffled speaking over loudspeaker]

242
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:45,303

And sixth, number 42, Peanut
Brittle, Amy (mumbles).

245
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,708
(bright music)

246
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:35,580
- Oh, darling, you look
adorable, just adorable!

247
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,313
- Remember, I want a first.

248
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,567
- No matter what he gets, Janie,

249
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:43,496
you made Danny the
best-looking pony in the show.

250
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:46,079
(bright music)

251
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,669
- [Announcer] Trot, please, trot!

252
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:17,252
(bright music)

253
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:35,649
- That's sloppy riding.

254
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:37,778
- Canter, please, canter!

255
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:40,361
(bright music)

256
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:55,828

Last call for open (mumbles)

272

(warm pensive music)

274
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,703
131 entering the ring, Andrea Cummings.

275
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,530
- She's riding very badly today.

276
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,420
- Oh, but she's having such a good time.

277
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,050
- She didn't come here
to have a good time.

278
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,883
- Oh!

279
00:23:58,565 --> 00:24:00,563
- Oh, she's pullin' him too much.

280
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:06,803
(loud thudding)
(Danny whinnying)

281
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:09,970
(tense pensive music)

282
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:22,344
- Oh, Monty!

283
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:25,511
(tense pensive music)

284
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:11,260
- Andrea, the next time
you fall off a horse,

285
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,830
you get up and you get on it again.

286
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,340
You finish the course!

287
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,600
Real sloppy riding, Miss.

288
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,320
- That Danny is just no good!

289
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,160
- Are you all right, darling?

290
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,200
- Pat, I'm afraid we didn't get a pony.

291
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,093
We got a lemon.

292
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,943
Andrea!

293
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,823
Come on.

294
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,810
- Janie, darling, listen,
tomorrow, we're having a barbecue

295
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,470
for Mr. Cummings, it's his birthday.

296
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,333
Now, we expect you and
your darling mother, okay?

297
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,713
We'll see you tomorrow, and
everybody's going to be there.

298
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,510
- Why did Danny do that?

299
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,860
- Horses and people, they
have one thing in common.

300
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,960
You never know what they're gonna do next.

301
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,450
Well, maybe he just needs more work,

302
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,450
or he was acting up against the
way Andrea was handling him.

303
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,180
Or maybe he is a lemon.

304
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,420
- [Janie] He isn't.

305
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,220
I'll work with him harder than ever.

306
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,130
Hope it rains tomorrow.

307
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,630
I don't wanna go to any dumb barbecue.

308
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,900
- Well, it's not supposed to,
so I expect to see you there,

309
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,900
also your mother, and this
fabulous man you can't stand.

310
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,053
- [Janie] Fabulous! (scoffs)

311
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,743
(upbeat music)

312
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:01,690
- Can't keep away from here even today.

313
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,500
- You're lucky, you don't
have to get dressed up.

314
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,130
- Oh, don't I?

315
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,053
Come with me.

316
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,280
Janie Neely, you are not
gonna spend the afternoon

317
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,621
in the stable, come on! (laughs)

318
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:19,621
(jazzy music)
(people chattering)

319
00:27:58,642 --> 00:27:59,500
- Two kicks, two kicks.
- You nervous?

320
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,183
- So I go one, two,

321
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:02,661
three, one--
- It goes before.

322
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,511
- Before, okay, you do the two kicks.

323
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:09,000
One, two, and then you go one, two,

324
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,510
three, four, one, two,

325
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,482
Then you turn and then you go
one, two, somethin' like that?

326
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:15,315
I don't know.
- Do you know it?

327
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:17,232
- Come on, try it?
- No!

328
00:28:19,204 --> 00:28:20,880
- Janie, hello, dear!

329
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,260
Isn't your mother coming?

330
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,680
I hear she has a lovely friend.

331
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,430
He's coming too, I hope.

332
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,484
- I expect so.

333
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:31,484
(jazzy music)
(people chattering)

334
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,710
- South side of Chicago
was never like this.

335
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,060
- Neither was Poughkeepsie.

336
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:13,790
- Kate!

337
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,810
Darling, you look adorable!

338
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,430
- It was so nice of you to invite us.

339
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,750
- Why, Mr. DeVito, I have been hearing

340
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,200
exquisite things about you!

341
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,540
A builder?

342
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,583
- Contractor, ma'am.

343
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,140
- And that wonderful
costume you're wearing.

344
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,220
- Why, Mrs. Cummings,
ma'am, this is no costume.

345
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,070
These are my Western threads.

346
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,810
- He's so wonderfully earthy.

347
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,430
- Vicky, they're starting on desserts.

348
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,640
- Oh, Monty, have you met

349
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,020
Kate's charming friend, Mr. DeVito?

350
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,480
- Hi.

351
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,060
- Kate, your Janie is
just a precious jewel,

352
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,920
that's my considered opinion.

353
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,600
- A bit uncut and unpolished, I'm afraid.

354
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,230
- Ah, but a beauty like
her mother nonetheless.

355
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,850
Nice of you to invite us.

356
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,100
Happy birthday, Mr. Cummings.

357
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,110
- Thank you.

358
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,433
Now, if you'll excuse us, Vicky?

359
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:05,921
(warm pensive music)
(muffled chattering)

360
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,870
- Where did you find
him, such a earthy man?

361
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,010
- Oh, what about our Janie?

362
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,260
She made a conquest.

363
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,347
- Yuck, he was a creep.

364
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,030
Did you see Andrea?

365
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,650
She was smoking behind the house.

366
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,496
- I barely recognized
her, she has changed.

367
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:28,913
(warm music)

368
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:34,053
Two, three.

369
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:37,145
(Mike grunts)
(Kate laughs)

370
00:30:37,145 --> 00:30:38,660
That was good.

371
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,600
You, young feller, are taking
a bath and heading for bed.

372
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,330
- I want to watch television.

373
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,810
- Not tonight.

374
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,523
Janie, will you get his bath ready?

375
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,860
- I'll get my own bath ready.

376
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,895
- Come on!

377
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:54,312
(warm music)

378
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,203
Mom!

379
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:17,042
(screen door slamming)

380
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,823
- Nice, Janie!

381
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,273
Great, keep going!

382
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,163
Good.

383
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,610
Okay, now the big one.

384
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,610
Let's try him on some jumps.

385
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,443
- All right.

386
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,750
Danny, I want you to do your best,

387
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,300
and I want you to do it for me.

388
00:32:12,503 --> 00:32:13,663
- Great, keep going!

389
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,173
Janie, go get Andrea.

390
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,320
I want her to see the
way he's jumping today.

391
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:35,150
(soft patting)

392
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,320
- He's really a darling.

393
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,293
He called me this morning, first thing.

394
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,970
Well, I guess he's determined to show me

395
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,270
how well brought up he is.

396
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,493
And of course, he said
all the proper things.

397
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,030
Hold on.

398
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,390
- Pat said you should
come down and ride Danny.

399
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,560
He's completely changed,

400
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,200
the way he jumps!

401
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,800
- Well, tell Pat I don't care.

402
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,873
I don't want to ride him now, or ever.

403
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,370
And he tried to kiss me.

404
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,873
Oh, but he's so clumsy.

405
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,803
Really!

406
00:33:08,643 --> 00:33:11,060
(warm music)

407
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:22,673
(tense warm music)

408
00:33:22,673 --> 00:33:23,590
- Pat, Pat!

409
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:27,737
(pensive warm music)

410
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,802
- Maybe that's why he balked at the show.

411
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:48,102
He must have been in pain.

412
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,070
- I don't believe it's fractured,

413
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,720
but I'd like to take some x-rays.

414
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:56,493
- [Monty] A lame horse is not much better

415
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,633
than one with a broken leg.

416
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,500
- What type of treatment should he get?

417
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,480
- Well, that depends on
exactly what we find.

418
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,710
Over the long haul, probably just rest,

419
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,640
but for now, hosing every few hours.

420
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,540
- I could do that.

421
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,890
- I'll come back later
and take those x-rays.

422
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,070
- What are the chances of this pony

423
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,070
ever being any good for showing?

424
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,490
What are the odds?

425
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,620
Isn't once lame always lame?

426
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,040
- [Dr. Greaves] Not necessarily.

427
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,477
That depends on exactly what we find

428
00:34:24,477 --> 00:34:26,313
and the care the pony gets.

429
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:29,063
(Danny neighing)

430
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,123
- Thanks, Doc.

431
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,480
Oh, Pat, will you come
up to the house later?

432
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,380
Wanna talk to you.

433
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,763
(warm pensive music)

434
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:47,480
- It was my fault, I asked him to jump.

435
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,853
He did it for me!

436
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,933
- Why don't you go home?

437
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:54,320
There's nothing to do now.

438
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,442
Danny will be getting his x-rays.

439
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:59,525
(warm pensive music)

440
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:25,109
- [William] 63, 74, 85, 93, 99.

441
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,270
- I should be back there.

442
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,600
When Dr. Greaves finishes the x-rays,

443
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,660
he'll need being hosed down.

444
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,110
- Then Andrea should be doing it.

445
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,180
He's her pony.

446
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,740
- I know he's her pony,
everyone's always telling me that,

447
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,580
but it's my job to take care of him.

448
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,450
I'm being paid for that!

449
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,390
- Lock out, lock out, we
got a touchdown. (grunts)

450
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,040
Touchdown! (laughs)
- Touchdown!

451
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,820
- Oh, good game, William!

452
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,493
Well fought and well played.

453
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,410
Guess you're not in any mood

454
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,360
for all this silly foolin' around, huh?

455
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,613
- Please, Janie, not late.

456
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,005
(warm music)

457
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:48,447
- Don't you worry, I'm
going to take care of you

458
00:36:48,447 --> 00:36:51,215
and you'll get all better fast.

459
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:53,632
(warm music)

460
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,360
- Hmm, these jeans!

461
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,430
You'd think by now, I should
take them out and bury them!

462
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,480
I mean, they've done a
full job and earned a rest,

463
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,090
but when have I got a
chance to go to the store?

464
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,350
- When I grow up, I'm
gonna be just like you.

465
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,924
I'm never gonna get married.

466
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:10,980
- (laughs) Janie, you
have me figured wrong.

467
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,690
- No one tells you what to
do, you're your own boss.

468
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,860
- And Mr. Cummings, who is he?

469
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,500
- You know what I mean.

470
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,660
You don't have to, my mother,

471
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,820
she thinks Mr. DeVito's just wonderful.

472
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,893
- I think he's pretty nice myself.

473
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,293
Janie, I've got some bad news.

474
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,960
Mr. Cummings has decided
to get rid of Danny.

475
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,127
- No!

476
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:38,837
- Janie.
- No!

477
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:40,807
- Janie, listen.
- No!

478
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:41,767
- Janie!

479
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:44,850
(warm pensive music)

480
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:48,730
Janie!

481
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,813
(warm pensive music)

482
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,070
Janie.

483
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,290
Honey, you said you wanted to be like me.

484
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,930
That means you want to
be able to make a living

485
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,260
by caring for horses.

486
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,090
Okay, then the most important
lesson you have to learn

487
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,380
is that you do your best, and that's all,

488
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,840
and you have to accept the
fact that horses and ponies

489
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,130
are gonna come and go.

490
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,030
- Not Danny, he's special.

491
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,520
He jumped because I asked
him to, he did it for me!

492
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,230
That's why he got hurt.

493
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,943
- Honey, he had a weakness
or an old injury, that's why!

494
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,020
Try and understand.

495
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,320
Mr. Cummings doesn't have
Danny as a pet for Andrea.

496
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,620
He's for her to ride in shows, to win.

497
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,400
- I'll take care of Danny.

498
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,090
I'll hose down his leg,

499
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,440
and Mr. Cummings won't
have to pay me anything!

500
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:51,138
(warm pensive music)

501
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,247
- Janie!

502
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:57,330
(warm pensive music)

503
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,740
- [Monty] Yes, Janie?

504
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,630
- Mr. Cummings, about Danny,

505
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,400
you don't have to pay me anymore,

506
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,000
and I'll work really hard
to make his leg better.

507
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,270
- Didn't Pat tell you?

508
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,850
- He'll be able to go to
shows soon, Mr. Cummings!

509
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,210
I know he will.

510
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,800
- Then you know things
Dr. Greaves doesn't.

511
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,500
Fact is, there's no bone
broken, according to the x-ray.

512
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,410
The tendon has been injured.

513
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,243
There's no way we can know

514
00:39:24,243 --> 00:39:26,770
that the pony will ever
be able to show again.

515
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,860
- Pat, you said I was
real good with Danny!

516
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,693
- Yes, you are.

517
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:32,840
- And you'll be just as good
with Andrea's new horse.

518
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,980
I just bought a beauty for
Andrea, genuine champion.

519
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,020
This time, she must really be ready.

520
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,460
It's ridiculous to
enter shows and not win.

521
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,293
- Janie, honey--

522
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:42,730
- And you can still take care of Danny.

523
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,430
He won't be leaving quite so soon.

524
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,950
- You're back, at last!

525
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,480
I have been pleading with Roberto to wait.

526
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,820
We need your opinion on some
very exciting new dress designs

527
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,653
for next season.

528
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,510
- Pat, if Danny gets better,

529
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,410
he wouldn't have to go then, would he?

530
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:12,329
(bright harmonica music)

531
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,470
- Very good, William!

532
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,560
You got the most important thing, breath.

533
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,393
Now, let's read the--

534
00:40:18,393 --> 00:40:21,160
- You had no right to talk
to Mr. Cummings about it.

535
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,600
I've never asked special
favors from anyone,

536
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,200
and you're my daughter, and you don't need

537
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,120
special favors either.

538
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,100
- I just wanted him to know
he didn't have to pay me.

539
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,040
- Mr. Cummings has been very generous,

540
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,310
but we don't need him to pity us.

541
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,710
If he wants to get rid
of that horse, so be it,

542
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,150
and tomorrow morning, I
want you to tell him that.

543
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,103
Do you understand?

544
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,450
I also want you to
apologize to Mr. Cummings

545
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,112
for trying to interfere.

546
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:50,529
(warm melancholic music)

547
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:53,651
- Goodnight, Janie.

548
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,068
(warm melancholic music)

549
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:02,564
(birds chirping)

550
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,450
- Just the person I wanted to see.

551
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:55,200
- Mr. Cummings, I want to apologize.

552
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,653
- There's no need to go on.

553
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:02,312
Janie, the thing you
wanted most, you've got it.

554
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,603
You have yourself a pony.

555
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,440
You don't understand, all right.

556
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,720
Let's put it simply by
saying that someone,

557
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,910
a person who doesn't wish to be revealed,

558
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,860
has advanced the money.

559
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,673
I really couldn't expect too much.

560
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,503
- You mean, Danny's mine?

561
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,910
- Now, this is the arrangement
that was suggested.

562
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,310
Course, you have to approve.

563
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,170
You now have two animals to take care of,

564
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,330
Danny and Andrea's new horse.

565
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,870
And the money that you will be earning,

566
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,180
well, that will go to pay for Danny's feed

567
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,160
and repaying the debt to
your unrevealed benefactor.

568
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,040
How does that strike you?

569
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,410
- I think it's wonderful!

570
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,530
I'll work very hard.

571
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,663
- I'm sure you will.

572
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,283
Janie, someone certainly
has a lot of faith in you.

573
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,032
You should be very pleased.

574
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:53,865
- I am.

575
00:42:54,912 --> 00:42:57,495
(bright music)

576
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:12,381
Mom, he's mine, he's mine!

577
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,964
(bright music)

578
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:17,780
Danny's mine, Mom, I own Danny!

579
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,823
- Yes, darling, it's wonderful.

580
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,820
Truthfully, I was against it at first,

581
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,273
but I know you love Danny,
and I respect that love.

582
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:31,266
I also know I can trust you to
keep your end of the bargain.

583
00:43:31,266 --> 00:43:34,266
(water splattering)

584
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,280
- [William] You think he knows
that he belongs to you now?

585
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,410
- [Janie] I think he
knows that I'm his friend.

586
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,343
- Will that really get Danny better?

587
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,850
- That's what Dr. Greaves says.

588
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,166
- Poor old Danny.

589
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:54,166
(barn door sliding)

590
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,543
- How's it goin'?

591
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,800
- [Janie] All right.

592
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,000
Pat, I'm gonna work as hard as I can.

593
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,300
- [Pat] I'm sure you will.

594
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,150
- When he gets better,
would it be wrong to jump?

595
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,810
His bad leg could come back.

596
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,070
- Maybe, but all you can
do is try your hardest

597
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,160
and keep your fingers crossed.

598
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,560
- Hello, William, how are you?

599
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,140
- Very well, thank you.

600
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,260
- She's the greatest person that ever was.

601
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,133
I'm sure she got Danny for me.

602
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,070
- Oh, she's fabulous!

603
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,820
Pat, can I take her in?

604
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,106
- Be my guest.

605
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:40,523
(warm music)

606
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:45,057
Here she is, here she is.

607
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,474
(warm music)

608
00:44:57,898 --> 00:44:59,807
- Oh, she's fantastic!

609
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:02,224
(warm music)

610
00:45:13,936 --> 00:45:18,685
- Don't you worry, Danny,
I'm gonna get you better.

611
00:45:18,685 --> 00:45:21,685
(bright warm music)

612
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,757
(water splattering)

613
00:45:39,675 --> 00:45:42,508
(horse galloping)

614
00:46:47,303 --> 00:46:49,594
I don't care if you never jump again.

615
00:46:49,594 --> 00:46:51,994
I just want your leg to get better.

616
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:54,411
(warm music)

617
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:42,893
(Danny whinnying)

618
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,560
(pensive music)

619
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:00,853
Good morning.

620
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,993
- Honey, it's not so good.

621
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,140
Danny's gone.

622
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:11,038
(tense pensive music)

623
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:24,690
Did you leave the stall door open?

624
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,693
- No, I always slide it shut!

625
00:48:28,904 --> 00:48:32,363
- Well, put a call into the town police.

626
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,610
Hey, there's no reason
to expect the worst.

627
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,816
He probably wandered
off, and he'll be back.

628
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:41,983
(tense pensive music)

629
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:50,124
- Danny!

630
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:55,884
Danny!

631
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,800
Mr. Cummings, I'm going home now.

632
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,340
There's hay and water in all the stalls.

633
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,850
- If anyone sees the pony,
we'll get a call right away.

634
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:22,430
You know, you've been
doing a fine job, Janie.

635
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:23,263
- Thank you.

636
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,903
- All right now, let's see
a trot and then a canter!

637
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,410
(melancholic pensive music)

638
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,120
- Danny!

639
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,787
(melancholic pensive music)

640
00:50:35,258 --> 00:50:36,469
(birds hooting)
(wings flapping)

641
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:37,302
Danny?

642
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:40,841
(birds hooting)

643
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,762
(pensive music)

644
00:51:03,923 --> 00:51:05,283
Danny?

645
00:51:05,283 --> 00:51:07,783
(owl hooting)

646
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:13,720
(pensive music)

647
00:51:23,971 --> 00:51:27,804
(horse whinnying in distance)

648
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,224
Danny?

649
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:46,701
Danny?

650
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:54,538
(tense music)

651
00:51:54,538 --> 00:51:55,371
(paint can clattering)

652
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:56,300
- Who's back there?

653
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,390
Gonna steal from me, huh?

654
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,040
- [Janie] No, I wasn't!

655
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,757
- Jethro, you let her be!

656
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,817
You can beat up on your own
kids, but not somebody else's!

657
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,773
I declare, ain't you Ms. Neely's child?

658
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,160
- Yes.

659
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,070
- Her Ma is Sybil's teacher,

660
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,160
and she ain't even got no pa neither!

661
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,560
- Then why is she trying to steal from me?

662
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,730
- I wasn't, I was looking for
my pony, Danny, he's lost!

663
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,250
- Well, he sure ain't here, so get!

664
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,503
I got shoeing to do!

665
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:32,820
- Aw, you remember me to your ma.

666
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,383
She's a real nice lady.

667
00:52:35,448 --> 00:52:36,920
- All right.

668
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,337
(warm music)

669
00:52:52,344 --> 00:52:53,177
- Hi!

670
00:52:55,054 --> 00:52:56,360
- Oh, it's you.

671
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,070
- I live back there.

672
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,960
He lit into ya, huh?

673
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,330
- I was looking for my pony.

674
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,930
- You got your own pony?

675
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,750
- He's lame, and he's been missing.

676
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,070
- I'll keep an eye out for him.

677
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,490
- [Janie] Bye.

678
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,603
- My dad, he's not as bad as he sounds.

679
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,880
You gonna be at the big county show?

680
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,713
- Maybe.

681
00:53:16,954 --> 00:53:19,954
(bright warm music)

682
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,673
- Any news?

683
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,220
- Janie had her own bit of excitement.

684
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,130
- I was sure Danny was there.

685
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:51,840
That man, his name's
Jethro, he was terrible,

686
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,350
all dirty and awful.

687
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,200
You should see where they live!

688
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,103
- When Sybil comes to
class, she looks just fine.

689
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,120
- But stories I hear about this Jethro

690
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,620
suggest he's one bad apple.

691
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,973
Too much booze and too
many kids, and no work.

692
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,500
Miss Janie, I am here.

693
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,333
Shall we go?

694
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,990
- I called Mike at his
office and told him.

695
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:18,305
- You came just because of Danny?

696
00:54:18,305 --> 00:54:21,525
(warm music)

697
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:23,720
- Come on, we still have
plenty of daylight left,

698
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,500
and I know most of these
back roads around here,

699
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,070
so we can scoot around 'em--
- Could we?

700
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,405
- Well, sure, why not?

701
00:54:28,405 --> 00:54:30,385
- He couldn't have gone
too far because of his leg!

702
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:31,218
- Right!

703
00:54:31,218 --> 00:54:33,635
(warm music)

704
00:54:37,937 --> 00:54:39,463
Leave a candle in the window!

705
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:41,880
(warm music)

706
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,993
We'll try again tomorrow.

707
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,263
- Danny!

708
00:56:09,642 --> 00:56:11,071
Danny!

709
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:13,488
(warm music)

710
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,986
(energetic music)

711
00:57:09,102 --> 00:57:11,494
Mom, it's Danny, he's come back!

712
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,911
(warm music)

713
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:26,599
I was looking for him,
and he came and found me!

714
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:28,511
And he's never even been here before!

715
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,337
- Look, he's bleeding!

716
00:57:30,337 --> 00:57:32,431
- But he's not limping anymore!

717
00:57:32,431 --> 00:57:34,848
(warm music)

718
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,550
- Well, the cut's superficial.

719
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,800
Probably just got caught
on some barbed wire.

720
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:13,200
More importantly, the leg looks
pretty good for the moment.

721
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,380
- Some first class
caring, wouldn't you say?

722
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,600
- Indeed.

723
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,570
You're the new owner, huh, Janie?

724
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,100
Well, you've done quite a job here,

725
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,730
and now you have yourself
a grand little pony.

726
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:25,130
- Why don't you take him
to his stall now, Janie?

727
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:26,563
- Thanks, Dr. Greaves.

728
00:58:35,404 --> 00:58:38,454
(warm music)

729
00:58:38,454 --> 00:58:42,121
- [Pat] The leg could
go again, couldn't it?

730
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,750
Shorten your reins, Andrea!

731
00:58:54,172 --> 00:58:55,172
Sit up tall!

732
00:59:03,823 --> 00:59:06,240
(warm music)

733
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,503
Come on, Andrea, sharper responses!

734
00:59:37,503 --> 00:59:39,652
Pretend you're at the
county show right now!

735
00:59:39,652 --> 00:59:42,652
(bright warm music)

736
00:59:47,747 --> 00:59:50,660
What has the lonesome prairie sent to us?

737
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,863
- Oh, just visitin' the civilized folk.

738
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,140
I wanted to see this pony

739
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,040
that's been causin' all the commotion.

740
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:04,170
Say, she really is good, isn't she?

741
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,970
- She certainly is.

742
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,230
- You mean it?

743
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,270
- [Pat] I always mean it.

744
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,970
- Pat, is this my lesson or isn't it?

745
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:14,103
- Come again, cowboy.

746
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,590
- What are you doing here?

747
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:21,913
- Oh, just drivin' by.

748
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,530
So, that's the famous Danny.

749
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:27,443
- Isn't he great?

750
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,480
He's just a little bit
stiff when he moves,

751
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,820
but Dr. Greaves says
that he'll be all right.

752
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,493
- Oh, he's a fine lookin' fella.

753
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,073
When you finish here,
I'll give you a ride home.

754
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,920
- I have to cool him out now.

755
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,743
- Story of my life,
waitin' for the ladies.

756
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,120
What are you thinkin' about, Janie?

757
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,610
- [Janie] Did you know my father?

758
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:01,933
- [Mike] No, I'm sorry, I didn't.

759
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:05,113
Your mother says he was a wonderful man.

760
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,480
- I don't remember him at all
well, but he was a good rider,

761
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,910
and he had his own horses too.

762
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:11,743
- I know.

763
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,230
- [Janie] Hi, Ma.

764
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,063
- [Mike] Hi, let me take that.

765
01:01:33,063 --> 01:01:35,314
- Well, this is a surprise.

766
01:01:35,314 --> 01:01:37,981
(Mike chuckles)

767
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,210
- Well, I was early for a meeting,

768
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,290
so I decided to drop in on Janie.

769
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:50,240
She's the one with the surprises.

770
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,060
Have you seen her ride?

771
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:53,740
- Is she really good?

772
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,313
- Oh, I think she's all right.

773
01:01:56,866 --> 01:01:58,270
You know, I had a thought.

774
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:01,333
Why can't Janie enter the next
horse show and ride Danny?

775
01:02:06,444 --> 01:02:09,265
- Will you come in, Mike, stay for dinner?

776
01:02:09,265 --> 01:02:12,300
- Oh, well, no, I can't,
I've got this meeting.

777
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,480
Course, I don't know, could Danny do it?

778
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,023
- His leg seems all better!

779
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:20,363
- It's a nice idea, but the answer is no.

780
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:24,550
We're not horse people, Janie,
and we're never going to be.

781
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,460
- My daddy was!

782
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,653
- I was never part of that world, Janie.

783
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,670
I don't want my daughter judged

784
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:36,433
by the bloodline of her horse
or the cut of her clothes.

785
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,120
- Thanks for driving me.

786
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,997
- I don't know, maybe you're right.

787
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:52,970
Maybe you're not, but it's your fault.

788
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,200
You let me fall in love with you,

789
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,440
and now your kid has become my kid,

790
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,940
and I happen to think she's
a pretty terrific kid!

791
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,433
See ya.

792
01:03:11,967 --> 01:03:12,800
- Mom!

793
01:03:13,937 --> 01:03:14,770
Mom!

794
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,910
- Janie, I just don't want you

795
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:31,470
trying to be someone you're not.

796
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:34,320
I don't want you envying Andrea Cummings.

797
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,600
- Andrea?

798
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,950
I don't want to be like Andrea.

799
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,173
I want to be like Pat.

800
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:44,630
- (laughs) Okay.

801
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:45,483
You win.

802
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,103
Both of you.

803
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,680
- All right, now let's do
your balancing exercises.

804
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,780
Hands above your head.

805
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,963
All right, now twist.

806
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,063
Hips.

807
01:04:30,647 --> 01:04:32,297
All right, that's enough for now.

808
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:44,777
Well, we're gonna have to
work a lot more on this.

809
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,300
- Hi.

810
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,693
- Janie, saddle up Midnight
Star and bring her to the ring.

811
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:57,763
- All right.

812
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,750
- Since when don't you
saddle up your own horse?

813
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,800
- She's supposed to work here, isn't she?

814
01:05:09,942 --> 01:05:12,275
(Pat sighs)

815
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:24,180
You really going to ride that
Danny in the county show?

816
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:26,640
- I'm just gonna enter one or two classes.

817
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,420
- Make sure they're nice and easy.

818
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,310
Don't go trying the Children's Hunter,

819
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:31,610
'cause he'd never make it.

820
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:37,980
He's a lemon, that's
what my father calls him.

821
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,490
You know what your Danny will do?

822
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:42,270
The same as with me.

823
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:45,900
All those people there, they'll
scare him, and he'll shy,

824
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,510
or maybe he'll pull his
fake lame act again.

825
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,370
- It wasn't fake!

826
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:52,080
- Just remember what I said.

827
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,973
Choose a class that's nice and easy.

828
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,922
(warm pensive music)

829
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,603
(tense music)

830
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:16,200
- You planning to leave his
stall door open again, Andrea?

831
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,503
- I didn't mean to!

832
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,363
He suddenly lunged!

833
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,120
It was an accident.

834
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,093
Why would I wanna do a thing like that?

835
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,770
Pat, you wouldn't tell my father!

836
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,423
- I haven't a clue why you do it,

837
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,683
but I'll tell you one thing I do know.

838
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,070
From now on, you are putting on

839
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:39,710
and taking off your own saddle, okay?

840
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,270
- Yes!
- And

841
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,520
you will stop being a brat

842
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,607
when it comes to Janie.

843
01:07:43,607 --> 01:07:44,463
- I'm not!

844
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,713
Okay.

845
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,513
- [Kate] My goodness, my little girl!

846
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,420
- Looks fairly good, doesn't she?

847
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,930
- Oh, Mr. Cummings!

848
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:13,120
What a wonderful ring
and stable, everything.

849
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,870
- Yes, oh, you haven't
seen all this before.

850
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:17,833
Yes, we enjoy it.

851
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,393
- Nice little setup.

852
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,660
- [Monty] Beautiful animal, eh?

853
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,383
Course, it's a matter of breeding.

854
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:31,553
- Here's Janie.

855
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,333
- Some good blood there
too, wouldn't you say?

856
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,900
- It's how a pony performs

857
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,500
when the chips are down that counts.

858
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,660
Now, Kate, I do hope Janie's not planning

859
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,450
to enter the Children's Hunter.

860
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,590
Shame to get her hopes up.

861
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,840
- We've been thinking about it.

862
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,190
- Not a good idea, my dear.

863
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,003
There you have it, class will out.

864
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,020
- Are you a bettin' man, Mr. Cummings?

865
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,083
- I always play to win, in everything.

866
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,490
I do have to go now.

867
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:18,883
Mrs. Cummings insists on my
taking her to a flower show.

868
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,900
Mr. DeVito, if you'd care to place

869
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,773
500 on the Children's Hunter.

870
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,890
- You got a bet.

871
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,330
- Fine.

872
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:33,190
Nice to see you're becoming
a horse man, Mr. DeVito.

873
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:35,720
Some day, I might see you on a horse.

874
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,170
- Well, I hope to see that
happen one day myself.

875
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:40,323
- Kate.

876
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:45,393
- Mike, she's never ridden in competition.

877
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,470
- Well, I guess I'm gonna
have to encourage her

878
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,467
to practice, a lot.

879
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:54,601
(bright warm music)

880
01:10:54,631 --> 01:10:58,964
(muffled speaking over loudspeaker)

881
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:41,187
(warm music)

882
01:12:32,336 --> 01:12:37,130
- The blue ribbon and silver
trophy went to number 41.

883
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:41,380
41 is Louisville Slugger (mumbles).

884
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:44,999
Second to 637, Talk of the Town.

885
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:49,332
(muffled speaking over loudspeaker)

886
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,270
- Hey, you look great!

887
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,103
- How did you get here?

888
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:55,490
- Hitched a ride.

889
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:58,270
Don't worry, my dad ain't here.

890
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,220
He's got a good job now.

891
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:03,320
That fella who was here
before with your mom,

892
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,180
that's his new boss.

893
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,210
- Mike?

894
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,213
- He's great!

895
01:13:08,338 --> 01:13:11,320
He came right up to the house,
saw my daddy sittin' there,

896
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,580
and gave him a job!

897
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,920
He builds houses now!

898
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,360
- I gotta go now, my class is next.

899
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,310
- I'll help you up.

900
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,713
One, two, three.

901
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,283
Some day, I'm gonna be
a rider, just like you.

902
01:13:30,926 --> 01:13:33,676
- [Announcer] Walk, please, walk!

903
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:04,547
- [Pat] What is she doing?

904
01:14:04,547 --> 01:14:07,297
- [Announcer] Trot, please, trot!

905
01:14:15,627 --> 01:14:17,794
- [Pat] What is she doing?

906
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,790
- [Pat] She's blocking
her from the judges!

907
01:14:41,637 --> 01:14:43,487
- [Announcer] Canter, please, canter!

908
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:56,170
Line up now, please, facing me!

909
01:15:03,785 --> 01:15:06,952
Everyone line up, please, and face me!

910
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,973
First, blue ribbon, number 276.

911
01:15:27,234 --> 01:15:30,401
(audience applauding)

912
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:35,687
Second, number 700.

913
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:41,821
(audience members
whistling and applauding)

914
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,754
- Oh, Monty darling, I really
can't see the difference

915
01:15:46,754 --> 01:15:48,430
in a first and a second.

916
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:51,060
- Darling, I can.
- Third, number 364.

917
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:53,648
(audience cheering and applauding)

918
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:55,231
Fourth, number 182.

919
01:15:57,639 --> 01:15:59,139
Fifth, number 603.

920
01:16:02,552 --> 01:16:04,052
Sixth, number 508.

921
01:16:05,678 --> 01:16:09,095
(warm melancholic music)

922
01:16:40,057 --> 01:16:41,940
- You did that on purpose!

923
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:44,780
You worked me against the
fence just to get at Danny!

924
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:45,870
- Well, you're wrong.

925
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:48,250
Midnight Star doesn't have to
do that to beat your Danny.

926
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,250
- I think I'll have to have
a talk with your father,

927
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,720
and I don't think he'd like
what I have to tell him.

928
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,553
- Don't.

929
01:16:53,553 --> 01:16:54,930
- Janie has two more classes.

930
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:57,020
Is it agreed that you'll
stay out of her way?

931
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,040
- Yes.

932
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:58,890
- [Monty] Andrea!

933
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:09,150
- Oh, how he does like winning first.

934
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:11,830
I saw what happened.

935
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:13,880
It wasn't your fault, you rode very well.

936
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:20,007
(bright music)

937
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,517
- [Announcer] Canter!

938
01:17:30,517 --> 01:17:32,346
Canter, please, canter!

939
01:17:32,346 --> 01:17:34,929
(bright music)

940
01:18:01,414 --> 01:18:03,914
(tense music)

941
01:18:07,327 --> 01:18:09,910
(bright music)

942
01:18:28,168 --> 01:18:30,962
All right now, will you
please line up and face me?

943
01:18:30,962 --> 01:18:34,026
(bright music)

944
01:18:34,026 --> 01:18:36,026
First prize, number 700.

945
01:18:37,398 --> 01:18:40,565
(audience applauding)

946
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,303
Second, 432.

947
01:18:47,318 --> 01:18:50,485
(audience applauding)

948
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,630
Third, 308.

949
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,253
- Oh, shucks!

950
01:18:57,238 --> 01:19:00,655
(warm melancholic music)

951
01:19:17,524 --> 01:19:18,360
- You looked real good.

952
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,940
- I shoulda seen that paper.

953
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:21,790
- Well, from where I was sittin',

954
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,580
you looked like a real pro.

955
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,290
- It's not fair.

956
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:27,950
- Well, you rode him in a
show, that's the main thing.

957
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:29,703
- Mr. Cummings says he's a lemon.

958
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:34,090
- That's one opinion, and
we don't happen to agree.

959
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:35,750
- You never did agree, did you?

960
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,250
You're the one that lent me
the money so I could get Danny.

961
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,883
All along, I thought it was Pat.

962
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:42,463
- My big secret.

963
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:44,660
Who told you?

964
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,870
- No one.

965
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:48,630
You believed in Danny,
no one else really did,

966
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:50,323
just like you believed in Jethro.

967
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:54,643
- Well, Jethro might turn out all right.

968
01:19:54,643 --> 01:19:56,180
- And Danny will.

969
01:19:56,180 --> 01:20:01,060
- Janie, maybe you shouldn't
show Danny over fences.

970
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,950
I mean, I don't want you
to think you have to do it

971
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:04,950
just because of my stupid bet.

972
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:06,260
- That's not why!

973
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,800
If he doesn't, it'll be like
everyone's saying he's a lemon,

974
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,485
and that's not true.

975
01:20:10,485 --> 01:20:15,480
(muffled speaking over loudspeaker)

976
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,580
- Knock 'em dead, kid.

977
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,266
You too.

978
01:20:19,266 --> 01:20:23,599
(muffled speaking over loudspeaker)

979
01:20:33,739 --> 01:20:34,572
- You see what I mean

980
01:20:34,572 --> 01:20:37,170
about class shining through, Mr. DeVito?

981
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,817
- Not yet, Mr. Cummings, not quite yet.

982
01:20:44,459 --> 01:20:47,042
(bright music)

983
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:05,387
- All right, Danny, now, the best we can.

984
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:09,233
(bright music)

985
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:38,346
(audience applauding)

986
01:24:45,155 --> 01:24:47,580
- The PHA is donated by the (mumbles)

987
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:48,833
Riding and Driving Club.

988
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:53,263
I have the results of class number 78,

989
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:58,660
the Children's Hunter over
fences on the outside course.

990
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,920
First, the blue ribbon
and the silver trophy

991
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,720
honoring the memory of
Sergeant Bertram Thomson

992
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:08,615
goes to number 676,

993
01:25:08,615 --> 01:25:11,032
Miss Jane Neely riding Danny.

994
01:25:13,146 --> 01:25:17,055
Second, the red ribbon, to number 700.

995
01:25:17,055 --> 01:25:20,590
This is Andrea Cummings
riding Midnight Star.

996
01:25:21,775 --> 01:25:25,692
Third, number 240, Lucy
Atwood riding Samantha.

997
01:25:27,295 --> 01:25:29,878
- Incredible, quite incredible!

998
01:25:31,757 --> 01:25:33,443
(Vickie clapping)

999
01:25:33,443 --> 01:25:35,860
(warm music)

1000
01:25:47,546 --> 01:25:50,713
(audience applauding)

1001
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:18,406
(audience applauding)

1002
01:26:54,093 --> 01:26:55,442
(muffled speaking over loudspeaker)

1003
01:26:55,442 --> 01:26:58,190
- Oh, see, Janie, what did I tell ya?

1004
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:00,120
All it takes is a lot of hard work,

1005
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,473
and maybe a little love.

1006
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,393
- Let me see.

1007
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:05,683
Wow!

1008
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:09,063
- Janie, you were wonderful!

1009
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:13,760
- [Mike] Well, Janie, now what?

1010
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,670
- [Janie] Now I have
to take care of Danny.

1011
01:27:23,919 --> 01:27:26,336
(warm music)

1012
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:36,726
- He's limping again.

01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:40,143
