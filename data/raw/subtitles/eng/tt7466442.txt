- Ha!
- Why "Ha"?

342

'Cause we don't
have to pay rent.

343
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,189
That'll help us with the bank.

He said, "maybe."

345
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:54,757
Yeah, but he winked
when he said it.

346
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,026
He's only got one eye.

347
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,486
How do you know
it wasn't a blink?

swallow us up.

the water pipe,

about the rent.

kind of "maybe" that was.

what was that thing you told
me your mother used to say?

I don't know. "Something
stinks in here"?

387

No. It was like,

"keeps you out of

Oh, yeah. She did say that.

that was very edgy.

- Mm.

681
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,775
- Accidently fall into a hole.
- A-bup-bup!

682

Gracefully tumble
in while screaming?

683

Go into a hole,

684
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,971
you get to keep whatever lands
in your mouth. That's a rule.

685

the bleachers, too!

tooth you've ever seen?

Okay, maybe not
too close. (GAGS)

It was in my mouth, Tina!

It's just, I think it's, like,

692

against the law for
you to have that.

I mean, I guess,
maybe, I don't know.

703
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,877
It was very dramatic,

704

- and we got it all on tape.
- Oh!

that kinda player.

No, I wanna be able to say

to call your landlord
and leave a message?

like-like you?

other dead people.

were murdered to death,

by a murderer-burier.

It's just our landlord's
gonna go to prison.

The bank's gonna
call in our loan,

862
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,499
and then they'll take
our restaurant stuff,

863
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,400
and we will live in
a box on the street.

to not go out of business.

868
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,743
No. Going out of business
down there is not as bad

869
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,578
as going out of
business in there.

Dreamy Bob is dumb

sees things the way they are.

gotta do to Droopy Bob?

saying. It's like a metaphor.

- Like this.
- Ow!

- All the trouble.

about how guilty he is?

did it, who did?

between two carnies.

with that theory?

say it back there.

But maybe not
making eye contact.

1238

night, you know?

- You were?
- Yeah.

We were playing lucky
ducky on the wharf.

And sure, Dan and
Mr. Fischoeder

1243
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:56,498
got into a big fight.

1244
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:59,042
Mr. Fischoeder started
throwing ducks at Dan's head.

1245
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:01,044
He kept yelling "duck,"
and it was confusing.

1246
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,254
I can see that.

1247
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,731
Anyway, after the
game, I went back

1248
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:05,007
'cause I forgot my stress ball.

1249
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:07,384

Mr. Fischoeder,</i>

<i>and Felix Fischoeder,</i>

1251
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,345
<i>and they're yelling
at each other,</i>

1252
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:11,889
<i>and they're all throwing ducks.</i>

1253
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,473
Wait. Felix was at the game?

1254
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,725
No. He wasn't.

1255
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:17,019
Mr. Fischoeder doesn't
let him play lucky ducky

1256
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,687
because Felix gives
all the duckies

1257
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,272
different voices
and personalities

1258
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,599
and it makes it take a while.

1259
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:23,812
That's why it was weird that
he showed up that night.

1260
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:25,485
But nobody back
there wants to hear

1261
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,112
that maybe Mr. Fischoeder
didn't do it.

1262
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:29,072
Oh, my God. Of course.

1263
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:31,533
Felix Fischoeder.
It's so Felix.

1264
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,619
He has access to
Mr. Fischoeder's gun.

1265
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:35,412
He was fighting with
both Mr. Fischoeder

1266
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:36,538
and Cotton Candy Dan.

1267
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:39,416
And most importantly,
he has a motive.

1268
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,668
He has a motive to
frame his brother.

1269
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:42,961
Because he's mad

1270
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,297
Mr. Fischoeder doesn't like
his lucky ducky voices?

1271
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:46,507
No, because I bet you

1272
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,134
if Mr. Fischoeder goes to
jail, Felix gets his money.

1273
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:50,469
We gotta go to the cops.

1274
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:53,138
Oh. Uh, mind if I
don't go to the cops?

1275
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:55,098
I have to pick up
my dry cleaning,

1276
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:56,225
because it's dry now.

00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,535

- Olive bar.
- What?

1284
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:07,879
I thought you could
have imported olives,

1285
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:08,987
and they could go there.

1286
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,090
- Oh. I'm not sure...
- While you wait for a burger,

1287
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,509
you help yourself to
an imported olive.

1288
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,534
Okay.

1289
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,136

she's missing all the fun

1294

00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:26,959
No questions from this guy.

1298
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,249
I'm the marketing department.

1299
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,591
I took Gene's burger suit,

1300
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,301
let out the crotch a
little bit, and bam.

1301
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,595
I'll push the product,
while you push the cart.

1302
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,222
- But the bikini.
- It's summer.

1303
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,474
- And sex sells, baby.
- Yeah, Bob.

1304
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:39,852
Is that sex? A burger
with a bikini on it?

- All right.

No, it was nice.

just a burger in a bikini.

don't tell us.

- Sorry. Sorry.

1315
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,206
Don't sneak up on a cop.

1316
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,041
That's our job. We
sneak up on you.

1317
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,126
Why are you here?

1318
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,712
We went to the police station,
where you live, I assume.

1319
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,630
But nobody from Homicide
would talk to us.

1320
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,150
So, then we went to
look for you in Robbery,

1321
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:11,401
but they said you
were on a stakeout.

1322
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,302
And they told you where I was?

1323
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:14,761
They said you were
at a dangerous

1324
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:15,888
biker gang headquarters,

1325
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:17,198
and we said, "The
One Eyed Snakes"?

1326
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:18,307
And they said, "Yeah,"

1327
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,492
and we said, "Oh,
we know those guys."

1328
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:20,577
And they were like, "What?"

1329
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:21,870
And we were like, "Yeah,
they're really nice."

1330
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:22,954
Get down, get down. (SHUSHING)

We are also getting down.

1333
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,275
What are we looking for?

1334
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:29,359
(WHISPERS) Bikers.

1335
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:30,485
Right. But, doing what?

1336
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:33,572
We got a tip that they stole
a bunch of karaoke machines,

1337
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:35,884
and I'm watching to see if
they try and move the goods.

1338
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:37,826
That doesn't seem like
their kind of crime.

1343
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:46,919
Anyway, we're here to tell you

1344
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:48,587
that the police
have the wrong guy.

1345
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:50,964
Mr. Fischoeder didn't
kill Cotton Candy Dan.

1346
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,508

- A very unique cufflink.

found the other one.

every year. I mean, just...

get into it. Bye, phones.

at the picture,

2032

2033
01:04:56,563 --> 01:04:58,732
which I bought for myself
when I graduated law school

2034
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:00,299
'cause no one else
got me a present.

2035
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:02,002
- Oh, boo-hoo.
- You went to law school?

2036
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,237
I knew he bit me,

2037
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,155
but I didn't know he
swallowed the damn thing.

2038
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:07,324
And you have that weird
tooth for some reason,

2039
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:08,659
and it matches my scar,

2040
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:09,743
and now everyone thinks

2041
01:05:09,826 --> 01:05:11,054
I murdered him
just 'cause I did.

2042
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:13,539
Unbelievable. You killed
Cotton Candy Andy?

- Cotton Candy Andy Dan?

- It's just... Never mind.
- You framed me?

2045

You're a terrible family lawyer.

2046

were by some stairs.

might have gotten

2145

wait six years.

off on the questions.

The new section of pipe is

us out somehow?

01:32:15,327 --> 01:32:16,328
Thanks. You too.

2851
01:32:16,411 --> 01:32:18,997
So, I was doing parkour
down on the beach with Zeke,

2852
01:32:19,164 --> 01:32:20,444
we're really good at parkouring,

2853
01:32:20,499 --> 01:32:21,779
or I'm really good
at parkouring.

2854
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:23,377
Anyway, I found this.

2855
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:25,295
- (GASPS)
- It made me think of you.

2856
01:32:25,462 --> 01:32:27,756
Maybe because you have
the same kind of barrette.

2857
01:32:27,923 --> 01:32:29,800
Do you want it? It
smells like seaweed.

2858
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:31,218
- Jimmy Jr.?
- Yeah?

2859
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:32,487
There's something I
wanted to ask you.

2860
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:34,555
Something summer
boyfriend-related.

2861
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:37,182
But then I thought maybe
it was a stupid question

2862
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:39,393
for anyone to ask anyone ever.

2863
01:32:39,476 --> 01:32:40,745
- (ZEKE GRUNTS)
- And my heart was an idiot...

2864
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:42,813
- Oh.
- ZEKE: Rolling, rolling.

2865
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:45,440
I'm doing parkour off the
locker, Jay-Ju. You see me?

2866
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:46,900
It looked a little
awkward, Zeke.

2867
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:48,402
I'm working on it! Yow-za!

2868
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:50,571
(LAUGHS) You fell
off the wall.

2869
01:32:50,654 --> 01:32:52,030
Yeah, what am I looking at here?

2870
01:32:52,114 --> 01:32:53,115
ZEKE: Parkour!

2871
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:54,533
Uh, what were you saying?

2872
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,910
Oh, I was saying, I thought
my heart was an idiot.

2873
01:32:57,077 --> 01:32:59,037
But then you found
my barrette-clace.

2874
01:32:59,204 --> 01:33:01,164
And now it kinda makes me think

2875
01:33:01,248 --> 01:33:02,888
maybe there's only no
romance in the world

2876
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:05,210
if you believe there's
no romance in the world.

2877
01:33:05,377 --> 01:33:07,296
And who wants to believe that?

2878
01:33:07,379 --> 01:33:08,630
Uh...

2879
01:33:08,714 --> 01:33:10,424
Now, I don't know
why I got so hung up

2880
01:33:10,507 --> 01:33:12,092
on the question I
was gonna ask anyway.

2881
01:33:12,259 --> 01:33:14,178
Mostly, I just
really wanna do this.

2882
01:33:14,636 --> 01:33:16,889
(BOTH MOANING)

2883
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:19,850
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

2884

(BAND CONTINUES

CHLOE: You're not gonna do it.

2886
01:33:27,566 --> 01:33:28,567
LOUISE: I'm gonna do it.

2887
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:29,836
You think because you,
like, saved the wharf

2888
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,045
or something, you're
all brave now?

2889
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:32,404
Yeah. On three.

2890
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:34,615
One, two, three.

2891
01:33:35,073 --> 01:33:37,242
- (ALL GASP)
- Your hat fell off.

2892
01:33:37,409 --> 01:33:38,410
LOUISE: Hmm? Oh, yeah.

2893
01:33:38,952 --> 01:33:40,805
Louise, reminding you that
you have detention today

2894
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:41,909
because you skipped school.

2895
01:33:41,997 --> 01:33:43,707
Oh, my God, your ears fell off!

2896
01:33:43,874 --> 01:33:45,834
Okay. It's okay. What
do we do? What do we do?

2897
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:47,201
It's fine. It's
not a big deal.

2898
01:33:47,252 --> 01:33:48,587
Emergency counsel session?

2899
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,214
I can get puppets here so fast.

2900
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,216
Ms. Labonz, will
you go to my office

2901
01:33:52,299 --> 01:33:53,842
and get Security Blanket Hank

2902
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:56,011
- and, oh, just get them all.
- No.

2903
01:33:56,178 --> 01:33:57,846
Mr. Frond, I'm good.

2904
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:00,015
- Oh, really?
- MS. LaBONZ: She's good.

2905
01:34:00,098 --> 01:34:01,451
- Okay. I'm so proud of you.
- LOUISE: Don't say

2906
01:34:01,475 --> 01:34:02,755
- "you're so proud of me."
- Yep.

2907
01:34:04,186 --> 01:34:06,230
Is everybody ready
to do this again?

2908
01:34:06,313 --> 01:34:07,564
LINDA: Yeah. GENE:
Sure, Father.

2909
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:08,833
LOUISE: I mean, it seems
like you're making us.

2910
01:34:08,857 --> 01:34:09,858
Teddy did a good job.

2911
01:34:09,942 --> 01:34:10,943
Kind of. Right?

2912
01:34:11,026 --> 01:34:13,237
LINDA: Aw, banner.
I love banners.

2913
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,405
GENE: Are we dead
set on "Burgers"?

2914
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:17,052
I mean, is it too
late to change that?

2915
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:18,435
TINA: Oh, yeah.
We could do wraps.

2916
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:19,493
LOUISE: Or soup.

2917
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:20,661
BOB: Mm. LINDA: Mm, soup.

2918
01:34:20,744 --> 01:34:23,288

has a certain sound to it.

Everyone, back inside,

- GENE: What a journey!

2923
01:34:30,295 --> 01:34:32,464
- (CHEERING)
- Yeah! All right!

2924
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:34,883
Finally. Now, we can bring
out Johnny Jazz Hands.

2925
01:34:34,967 --> 01:34:35,968
Oh, goody.
