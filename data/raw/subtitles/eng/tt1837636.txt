1
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:57,273
Assuming the Ottoman Empire
finally becomes defunct,

2
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:01,047
Russia would get the Dardanelles,
the portion closest to them,

3
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,487
and the Italians,
the islands off the mainland.

4
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,475
- And the French had no problem with that?
- But the French had problems with everything.

5
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:11,625
That is their nature.

6
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,604
And the big pieces?

7
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:18,647
Oh once I conceded control over Syria
and Lebanon to them it got easier.

8
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,894
Let us read your mind.

9
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:25,363
Mr Churchill, do you really want
Lebanon for the British Empire?

10
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:29,989
It's a mess grown in a 1,000 years
that no one will ever disentangle.

11
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:32,770
And Syria might pose
an even bigger problem.

12
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:37,999
Sunni, Shiite, Alawites, Druze,
Christian, all at each other's throats.

13
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:42,446
And up North, the Kurds.
Let the French deal with the Kurds.

14
00:03:42,448 --> 00:03:45,443
Or let the French
try to deal with the Kurds.

15
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:46,931
And let them fail.

16
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:49,903
I know where all your intelligence
comes from.

17
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:56,560
Are you trying to say...
from the woman?

18
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,617
From that woman?

19
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:03,075
Petty rivalries only after cocktails.

20
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,381
Now, to us.

21
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:11,953
Zone B: our area of influence.

22
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:15,340
I wrestle from the French
Baghdad, Bazra, Kuwait.

23
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:18,981
This will now be
under our direct control.

24
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,578
And how do we delineate the borders?

25
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,259
- That will fall in place later.
- No.

26
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:27,972
This is the moment.
It has to be now.

27
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:36,846
Our issues start down here,
in the South.

28
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:39,518
Now it's just a vague dotted line.

29
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,960
- We have a problem with Ibn Saud.
- The scoundrel.

30
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:44,241
In fact we have two problems.

31
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,738
Firstly, he wants the whole of Arabia
as a separate country for himself.

32
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,192
The bastard.

33
00:04:50,294 --> 00:04:54,001
Ahh.. secondly,
he wants a flexible border.

34
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,346
One of his tribes moving North
for the summer pastures.

35
00:04:57,348 --> 00:05:00,725
There are no bloody pastures.
There's only sand.

36
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,732
And he wants a border...

37
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:05,300
according to the movement
of people, not territory.

38
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:07,656
East is not fly.

39
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,205
Who knows best about tribes?

40
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:14,278
Lineages, affiliations, rivalries.

41
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,473
Who knows best
about Bedouin tribes?

42
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,205
And who is going
to rule over all of this?

43
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:24,922
We are talking
to potential future kings.

44
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:29,537
Who knows the candidates?
Who knows them best?

45
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:33,709
The woman. Gertrude.

46
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,746
Gertrude who?

47
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:41,232
- Gertrude Bell.
- A silly bitch.

48
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:45,231
It's a chattering windbag
of conceited, gushing,

49
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:47,389
heavy-chested man-woman,

50
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:51,643
a globe-trotting,
rump-wagging, blethering ass.

51
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:58,948
Gertrude.

52
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,689
- Gertrude, look at me.
- Mother, don't.

53
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:03,901
- What?
- Don't tell me how to behave.

54
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:05,776
I'm afraid I'm going to, anyway.

55
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:10,087
- You will smile.
- Yes, mother.

56
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,338
You will not, scare the young men
with your intelligence.

57
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,700
How do I do that?
I cannot play dumb.

58
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,244
Just, listen to what
they have to say, and smile.

59
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,071
That will be hard.

60
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:24,640
- Gertrude...
- I love it.

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,605
I love it.

62
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:31,809
I love it.

63
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,164
- And then?
- You mean after the lion?

64
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,625
- Yes.
- Well then I shot an elephant.

65
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,200
Ah!

66
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:55,899
And all of this was
in the South of Sudan?

67
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,713
No, my hunting party
had moved to Kenya by then.

68
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:01,047
- Oh..
- God, was that a safari!

69
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:05,184
I would guess you didn't
shoot just one elephant.

70
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:11,755
First a rhino, then a lion,
and then two elephant bulls.

71
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:15,610
Are there any elephants left in Africa?

72
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,057
You meaning what, young lady?

73
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:25,500
Gertrude...

74
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:29,284
I would love, to elope with you.

75
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:33,684
Where to? Paris, India?

76
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,503
The pyramids?

77
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:39,100
Out there, there's a barn.

78
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:42,846
You mean hay?

79
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,037
Nobody would notice
if we left for a few minutes.

80
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:51,902
You mean for fornication.
If we can straight forward.

81
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,200
Absolutely.

82
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:57,220
- Like the cattle in the field?
- Absolutely.

83
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:01,631
Arnold Runcie, I barely know you.

84
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:05,549
- But you seem to like cows.
- Absolutely.

85
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:07,991
How many do you have?

86
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:12,639
Near Newcastle,
I have 800 Herefordshire.

87
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:17,183
Up North, in Scotland, 2,000.

88
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:21,700
- Angus?
- Angus. Yes.

89
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:23,847
Black, Angus.

90
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:43,234
Miss Bell, thank you for the honour.

91
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,031
Over here, Mr. Havenhurst.

92
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,895
Over here to your left.

93
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:49,994
I'm so sorry.

94
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,325
So sorry.

95
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:56,433
Dear God!

96
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:59,977
Send me an earthquake, please.

97
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,263
I can't take it,
I can't take it any longer.

98
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:22,739
I feel so domesticated.

99
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,245
- It.. it's stifling to me.
- Oh Gertrude, what am I supposed to say?

100
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:30,851
I can say it. We should never
have allowed you to go to Oxford.

101
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:32,562
But dear, she's one
of only four women to

102
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:35,624
study history and to graduate
with the highest honours.

103
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:39,091
A young, unmarried woman
from a good family should not...

104
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:41,383
Should not be allowed out on the street
without a chaperone.

105
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:45,932
- Gertrude, would you please sit down?
- No, no, I don't want to sit down.

106
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:49,332
Ohh.. darling, darling, darling,
I have always supported you.

107
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:51,700
I've watched you
climb, sharp high rocks.

108
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,200
But let us not forget the string of nannies
who quit because of your wilfulness.

109
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:58,008
Ah well, so what.

110
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:01,847
Do you remember that time when you climbed
that tall beech tree in the park?

111
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:05,002
And you had a very large lamp shade
on your back.

112
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:07,605
Yes, I remember that.

113
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,296
Yes you were only 5, and you
were already reading voraciously.

114
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:13,963
And somebody stupidly showed you
Leonardo da Vinci's sketchbook.

115
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:18,379
- I remember the one with the parachute.
- Who ever would need a parachute?

116
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:21,454
Everyone.
Everyone needs a parachute.

117
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:25,511
Well it probably hurt me more than you
when you broke your ankle.

118
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,723
I don't like to think about it,
it hurts me even today.

119
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,252
Get me out of here, please.

120
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:35,858
Please, please, get me out of here!

121
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,600
India, Arabia, anywhere.
Please!

122
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:50,344
You know...

123
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:56,090
However how much it hurts me
when you're not around,

124
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:00,338
we are going to have
to get you out of here.

125
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,400
Where?

126
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:05,999
What about Tehran?

127
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,471
The embassy.

128
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:17,426
I'm going to introduce
Gertrude now Mary,

129
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:21,296
it's introduction time.
Gertrude, may I use your glass
for a moment, thank you.

130
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:23,954
Excellencies.

131
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:27,209
Here you go.
Ladies and gentlemen,
come forward.

132
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,801
Come forward. Thank you.

133
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:37,362
I'd like to introduce
Gertrude Lowthian Bell to you.

134
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,214
She is a brilliant young scholar,

135
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:43,929
and I am blessed
to call her my niece.

136
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:47,811
She is actually the daughter
of my wife Mary's sister,

137
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,500
and we love her.

138
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,435
And I'm sure you all, will make
her stay with us, a wonderful experience.

139
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:00,553
As to the return of my dear wife,

140
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:04,136
boys, the wildlife is over.

141
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:08,660
No more riding on horseback
into our dining room.

142
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:14,516
No more drunken orgies
on our well-groomed British lawn.

143
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:18,972
No more rescues
of damsels in distress.

144
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:22,775
And no more, public display

145
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:28,500
of the wildest irreverence,
towards our beloved Queen Victoria,

146
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,352
who, I think needs to spend time here,

147
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,100
to wean her from her grand design
of a prudish empire.

148
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,100
To the British Empire!

149
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,913
To the British Empire!

150
00:12:44,244 --> 00:12:45,815
And to Persia.

151
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:51,036
The country, of 5,000 years of poetry.

152
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:53,436
Why is my glass empty?

153
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:55,502
Where is the champagne?

154
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:16,100
The scents. Can't believe it.

155
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:20,940
- And the birds.
- Nightingale.

156
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:24,969
When I cry at night into my pillow,
she always makes me feel happy.

157
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,711
She? Umm, I think
it's only the males that sing.

158
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:32,328
- Oh don't spoil it.
- I'm sorry, Flo...

159
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:35,000
Hello.

160
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:39,163
I'm Henry Cadogan.

161
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:42,000
- I am...
- Henry is the secretary of the Embassy.

162
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,948
Actually I'm, only
the third secretary.

163
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,600
Miss Bell I welcome you to the embassy
of Her Majesty the Queen.

164
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:52,733
A prudish majesty.

165
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:57,519
I have been officially assigned
to be your guardian,

166
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,500
to entertain you so,

167
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,000
if there's anything you need at all,
please let me know.

168
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:06,829
I will do that.

169
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:13,855
Henry.

170
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:16,800
Oh Henry, please show us
your trick shots.

171
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:20,424
Florence, the table isn't
even free, it's...

172
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,200
Please.

173
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,200
Please please please.

174
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:27,100
No, I'm not a circus performer.

175
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,700
He has two unbelievable trick shots.

176
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:34,433
Show us, your "Orbit of the Moon".

177
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,000
Florence, it's embarrassing.

178
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:41,102
- What's your second trick shot?
- The "Frog Leap".

179
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,802
Henry, show us your card trick.

180
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,200
He has the greatest of card tricks.

181
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,632
- Really?
- Please.

182
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,200
Florence, it's a silly trick. No!

183
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:00,862
Come, come.

184
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:10,303
Miss Bell, may I suggest
at the residency,

185
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:13,400
you put your bed out
on the roof under the sky.

186
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:17,207
I do love the stars at night.

187
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,300
Although I'll have to put out
mosquito netting for you.

188
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,232
Uhh the mosquitoes are awful.

189
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Miss Lascelle,
are we not boring you?

190
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,300
No.

191
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,900
Oh, no, no, no, no.

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,300
Florence. Florence,
will you please come over?

193
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,035
Now?

194
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:37,398
The new Italian ambassador
has a present for you.

195
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,300
- Henry, I shall come right back.
- Alright.

196
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:57,354
It's like "The Beast's Garden".

197
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:05,280
It's a perfect nightmare
of flowers, and scents.

198
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,900
Uh huh.

199
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,450
Mr. Cadogan, do you by any chance,
know what this inscription says?

200
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,048
Yes.

201
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
It's in Farsi,

202
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,471
but a medieval form of it.

203
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,400
Can you read it?

204
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,200
Umm.

205
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,371
"With them, the seed
of wisdom did I sow,

206
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:46,950
"and with my own hand,
laboured it to grow."

207
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,950
"And this was all the harvest
that I reaped,

208
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:51,600
"I came like water
and like wind I go."

209
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:55,200
Miss Bell, you know poetry?

210
00:16:56,261 --> 00:17:00,000
- You know Omar Khayyam.
- Yes, I do.

211
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,106
I want to learn his language.

212
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:10,065
Mother dearest,

213
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:13,390
I am using the opportunity
to send you this

214
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,127
with today's diplomatic pouch.

215
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:19,100
My first week has been most precious
and I have started to learn Farsi

216
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,882
in order to read the poets
in their original.

217
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:27,669
Mr. Cadogan, who works at the embassy,
is very helpful in this.

218
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:31,683
He is agreeable,
intelligent, well-read,

219
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,803
looking after us, Florence and me,
as his special property.

220
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:36,757
I like him.

221
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,137
He's invited us
to ride with him today."

222
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:49,400
- But Henry, you can't ride.
- Yes, I can.

223
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,703
What if you fall?

224
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:53,330
- It happens to the best.
- You will get hurt.

225
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't like you to ride.

226
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:58,700
- Why don't you join us?
- I'm afraid of horses.

227
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:02,500
Bye.

228
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:39,564
Miss Bell, this is my favourite place
in all of the countryside.

229
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,709
After the winter, when
the water level's very high

230
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:47,300
the shepherds swim their flocks
down here for the summer pasture.

231
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:51,109
Sometimes there're thousands of sheep,

232
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:55,900
and, the shepherds swim among them
on these inflated goat skins.

233
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,400
- Yes, I've seen that.
- Have you?

234
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,902
In Babylonian reliefs.

235
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,403
They were doing it 4,000 years ago.

236
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,400
- They're still doing it.
- It's extraordinary.

237
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:11,414
Sometimes I go up there.

238
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:16,100
I'm a fairly good mountain climber,

239
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,400
but how for God's sake
do you get up?

240
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:21,500
I must confess it's pretty easy,
heh..

241
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:24,936
Just walk around the back,
and go up.

242
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:27,804
And why?

243
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,680
Why do you go there?

244
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:38,104
I go when I'm lonely.

245
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:43,212
I get very lonely.

246
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,400
Gertrude.

247
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,300
Ahh, dear...

248
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:04,200
- Yes?
- A letter.

249
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:07,452
- A letter for me?
- No, for Henry.

250
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,200
- Mr. Cadogan you mean?
- Yes, Henry.

251
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,600
Could you please
hand him this letter?

252
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:17,100
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

253
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,500
Oh I can not, I can not.

254
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,249
Why can't you?

255
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,300
Gertrude, from woman to woman,
you won't say anything?

256
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:30,300
- No, I won't.
- To no one?

257
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:33,706
Not a soul I, I promise.

258
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:42,400
Well.. since last year. I mean since
one year, two months and 11 days...

259
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:44,031
What?

260
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,156
I have had...

261
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:48,658
a passion for Henry.

262
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,000
What did he say to you today?
Did he mention me today?

263
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:58,000
No, we just talked about shepherds.

264
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,300
So.. why can't you give Mr. Cadogan
your letter?

265
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,585
I just can't.

266
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:07,350
And sending him letters by mail
might cause gossip upon its arrival.

267
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:08,326
Letters?

268
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:11,100
See I have written
two hundred and two.

269
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,669
What is.. so terrible.

270
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,591
I can't send them.

271
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,326
Sweet Florence, my darling.

272
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:28,241
You know I would do anything for you.

273
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,600
But I cannot fight
the battles of your heart.

274
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:57,097
Father dearest,

275
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,540
I do not know where to begin.

276
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:04,400
The Orient is like a prolonged dream.

277
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,600
I am being taken care of wonderfully
by Auntie, and for all the rest,

278
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,900
Mr. Cadogan is a fine guide
and guardian.

279
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:20,355
He takes care of Florence and me.

280
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:23,163
He shows us lovely things
from the bazaars.

281
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,212
He is always there
when we want him,

282
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:28,300
and never when we don't.

283
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:29,829
Hurry.

284
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:43,877
Yes. Thank you for bringing us.

285
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,066
You see, they really
eat the heads here.

286
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:50,611
Do they?

287
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:53,200
- This is a delicacy?
- Yeah.

288
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,302
Look at the colours!

289
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:04,100
- Ah yes.
- So pretty.

290
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,908
This is paprika. You try it.

291
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,163
I can?

292
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,978
How do you say "Thank you"?

293
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:20,103
Don't you love it, Florence?

294
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,864
Miss Bell.

295
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,937
I stayed up,
hoping I would see you.

296
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:41,613
I didn't come to play billiards.

297
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:44,895
Why did you come?

298
00:23:46,964 --> 00:23:49,593
I came, for your card trick.

299
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,500
I see.

300
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:56,386
Card trick it is.

301
00:23:57,738 --> 00:23:59,544
You have to come over here.

302
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:08,970
As you can see,
the deck is already shuffled.

303
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:13,812
The red cards and the black cards
are, placed at random.

304
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:20,200
This trick is fiendish.

305
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:28,344
Because, from this point on,
I will not touch the cards.

306
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:31,479
You will do everything.

307
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:33,269
Me?

308
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:35,669
You see,

309
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,794
I am going to cast a spell over you.

310
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:44,824
And under this spell,
without looking,

311
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:51,070
you'll be able to determine
if the card is red, or if it is black.

312
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,162
Without looking at the cards?

313
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,262
That's impossible.

314
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:00,112
According to the laws of probability.

315
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:03,300
Under my spell,

316
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,479
the laws do not exist.

317
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:12,260
You may begin.

318
00:25:16,063 --> 00:25:18,026
Do not turn it over.

319
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:19,925
I'm not.

320
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,319
What colour is it?

321
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:27,944
Black.

322
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,744
Black.

323
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:35,187
Red.

324
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:37,978
Black.

325
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,417
Red.

326
00:25:42,781 --> 00:25:44,772
Black. Black.

327
00:25:44,774 --> 00:25:47,787
Red. Red. Red.

328
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:00,944
Voila.

329
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:08,339
Mr. Cadogan,
you did touch the cards again,

330
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:09,883
when you turned them over.

331
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,870
Gertrude, you're very smart.

332
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:20,869
You're the only one
who's ever noticed that.

333
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:26,432
Did you just
call me "Gertrude", Henry?

334
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:29,080
Yes, I did.

335
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,636
And did you just call me Henry?

336
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:36,995
Shhh... the walls have ears.

337
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:43,830
How does the trick really work?

338
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:51,058
I'm not going to tell you.

339
00:26:52,183 --> 00:26:54,316
But you're very close.

340
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,141
Am I?

341
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,326
Love the birds here.

342
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:40,000
I come here for the birds.

343
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:52,609
This is the Tower of Silence.

344
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:09,221
Gertrude, you're sure
you wish to go all the way up?

345
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:10,538
Yes, I'm sure.

346
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,278
Yes.

347
00:29:14,602 --> 00:29:16,800
There may be bones.

348
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:19,336
Maybe skulls.

349
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,840
Maybe vultures.

350
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,792
What if we anger the vultures?

351
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,973
They've probably heard us
and flown away.

352
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:44,729
As I told you,

353
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,672
this is what the Zoroastrians,
leave their dead to the vultures.

354
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:51,864
They consider them sacred.

355
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,757
You're scared?

356
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:08,743
I'm not afraid.

357
00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:23,021
Gertrude Lowthian Bell.

358
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:25,765
I wish to kiss you.

359
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:44,586
Maybe we shouldn't do it here.

360
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:48,142
Run. Come on.

361
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:24,169
Florence,
stop that moody brooding.

362
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:26,331
- Oh Father...
- Frank.

363
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,400
- Please don't Frank Frank me.
- She is a girl.

364
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,951
My dinner table is a no cry zone.

365
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,358
I'm sorry I gave birth to a daughter.
You wanted a boy, obviously.

366
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,431
Absolutely not!

367
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:39,421
You could've born me a dromedary,
and I wouldn't have minded.

368
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,300
Now look, darling.

369
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:46,058
There is a good side about tears.

370
00:32:46,713 --> 00:32:49,830
If you cry a lot,
you need to pee much less.

371
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:05,159
Let's smoke a cigar together.

372
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:10,850
- Bread.
- Yeah.

373
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,138
A piece of bread.

374
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:15,581
A.. a loaf of bread.

375
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:21,099
Sharab wine.
A flask of wine.

376
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:23,677
And so, umm..

377
00:33:24,971 --> 00:33:26,521
You're doing so well.

378
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:28,400
- I am?
- Yes.

379
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:35,421
"A loaf of bread beneath the bough.
A flask of wine, a book of verse.

380
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:41,403
"And Thou beside me
singing in the wilderness,

381
00:33:41,556 --> 00:33:45,859
and wilderness is paradise enow."

382
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:51,200
More.
More more more more more more..

383
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,500
Look at this verse.

384
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:59,000
"The bird of time, has but a little way,

385
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:00,894
to fly."

386
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:19,701
- It's of Alexander the Great.
- Yeah.

387
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:24,650
That's 2,200 years looking at you.

388
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,634
- It is for me?
- No.

389
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:33,363
Only half.

390
00:34:34,517 --> 00:34:37,031
I had a silversmith cut it in two.

391
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:41,547
So half is for you,
and half is for me.

392
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:54,569
Wherever you are in the world,

393
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:57,455
and wherever I might be,

394
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,292
this is proof
that we belong to each other.

395
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:06,250
And if one of us dies,
then the other keeps the whole coin.

396
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,185
Henry.

397
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,135
Gertrude Lowthian Bell,

398
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:24,253
will you marry me?

399
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:29,041
Did I hear you correctly?

400
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,019
Yes, marry me.
Will you marry me?

401
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:38,200
Shouldn't you be down
on your knees?

402
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:39,937
Oh no.

403
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:44,749
I did it wrong.

404
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:52,100
- Yes.
- Yes?

405
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:58,750
Alright, will you marry me?

406
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:01,615
I will.

407
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:24,745
Henry?

408
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,600
What are you doing?

409
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:38,300
How did you pass
the security guards with a ladder?

410
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:45,750
I know how to do
all the most important things in life.

411
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,800
But you could've fallen
to your death.

412
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,100
It was very important
that I solve a particular mystery.

413
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,000
What mystery?

414
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:04,749
Well, you see...

415
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,645
I love your smile.

416
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:13,144
But many a man,
in love with a woman's smile,

417
00:37:13,446 --> 00:37:17,902
has made the mistake,
of marrying the whole girl.

418
00:37:28,445 --> 00:37:30,400
Here's the whole girl.

419
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:09,368
I wonder why my father
hasn't answered me.

420
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:12,738
Don't worry, there's
always a delay because,

421
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,800
the mail needs to be sorted
in the foreign office in London.

422
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:18,087
Two days ago I sent a telegram.

423
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:20,231
Sent a telegram,

424
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,753
from the embassy?

425
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:24,950
- So, everyone knows about us?
- No.

426
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,623
No, I only said,
"Have you sent an answer?"

427
00:38:29,783 --> 00:38:31,246
and I've heard nothing.

428
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,728
Nothing from him.

429
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,690
I'm worried.

430
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:02,327
Can I help you?

431
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:09,039
Memsah, from dispatch.
Don't have a telegram,

432
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:12,466
but I noticed that the mailwoman
had this letter for you.

433
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,178
I knew you were waiting.

434
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,155
I'm always here for you.

435
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:19,804
I would..

436
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:22,200
I would.. would...

437
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,500
Would what?

438
00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:27,144
I would give my life
for a woman like you.

439
00:40:42,468 --> 00:40:45,706
I shall return home,
I shall speak to my father.

440
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,620
Love is lawless. Don't go.

441
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:26,900
His credentials are not impressive.

442
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,426
I don't care.

443
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:31,363
Do you have any idea
how little a junior diplomat earns?

444
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:35,300
I could live in a tent - a tent!
- with the man I love.

445
00:41:35,366 --> 00:41:37,877
What I have found out about him
and what you probably do not know...

446
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:38,973
I know everything.

447
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:41,861
What you probably do not know
is the man is a gambler.

448
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,739
He's accumulated significant debts.

449
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:47,900
But, you had an enormous,
an enormous debt.

450
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,300
When you started your steel mill,
you did.

451
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,600
- My answer remains, No!
- Why?

452
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,800
I will not give my consent to this,

453
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:58,609
this childish plan.

454
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,508
The nightingale with drops
of his heart's blood,

455
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,068
had nourished the red rose.

456
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,428
Then came the wind.

457
00:42:28,165 --> 00:42:30,995
And catching at the boughs
in envious mood,

458
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,725
a hundred thorns
about his heart entwined.

459
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:24,600
This, just arrived
by diplomatic pouch from Tehran.

460
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:33,002
... says that the coin, and
the clothes of Mr., Mr. Henry Cadogan,

461
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:37,600
were found neatly arranged
on a rock, by the Lar river.

462
00:43:41,783 --> 00:43:45,400
Cadogan's body was found,
the following day,

463
00:43:45,452 --> 00:43:48,800
at the bottom of a, of a cliff,

464
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,734
on the opposite side of the river.

465
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:58,550
The embassy regrets to inform you
of this, tragic accident.

466
00:44:01,911 --> 00:44:04,064
It was no accident.

467
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:11,400
There's also a,
short note from Cadogan,

468
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,222
which I hesitate to give to you.

469
00:44:21,482 --> 00:44:23,300
Gertrude, I'll leave you now.

470
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:37,233
Eternal love, does keep
in his complacent arms,

471
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:41,928
the earth, the air, the deep.

472
00:45:20,098 --> 00:45:23,023
Light of mine eyes,
and harvest of my heart,

473
00:45:23,793 --> 00:45:26,669
and mine at last
in changeless memory.

474
00:45:27,336 --> 00:45:30,300
Ah when he found it easy to depart,

475
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,276
he left the harder pilgrimage to me.

476
00:45:34,044 --> 00:45:36,696
Oh Camel-driver
though the cordage start,

477
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:39,709
for God's sake help me
lift the fallen load,

478
00:45:40,547 --> 00:45:43,047
and pity be my comrade of the road.

479
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,500
My face is seamed with dust,
mine eyes are wet,

480
00:45:52,947 --> 00:45:56,150
of dust and tears
the turquoise firmament,

481
00:45:56,228 --> 00:46:00,513
kneadeth the bricks for joy's abode.
And yet,

482
00:46:00,613 --> 00:46:03,998
I had not castled,
and the time is gone.

483
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,689
What shall I play?

484
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:11,509
Upon the chequered floor
of night and day,

485
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:13,667
Death won the game.

486
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:06,256
For the first time in my life,
I know who I am.

487
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:10,436
My heart belongs to no one now
but the desert.

488
00:47:21,455 --> 00:47:24,130
- Ahh.. for years really.
- Years?

489
00:47:25,648 --> 00:47:30,454
But why venturing out in the desert,
a woman alone, in times of war?

490
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:34,216
Have you ever experienced the desert?

491
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:36,424
What has that got to do with it?

492
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:40,800
What I would like to know is this:
What brings you here?

493
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,437
Why do you leave England for good,
as you say?

494
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:46,226
Well to be honest, I do not
fully understood myself.

495
00:47:46,326 --> 00:47:48,237
But I did have my moment of epiphany.

496
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,782
Miss Bell, allow me to be candid.

497
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:53,143
This sounds pathetic.

498
00:47:56,649 --> 00:47:58,300
And what are your intentions?

499
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,724
My intentions, are to move out there

500
00:48:02,824 --> 00:48:05,583
and, do some archaeological research.

501
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:07,851
- Study the Bedouins.
- The Bedouins?

502
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:09,925
Heavens..

503
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,900
This is not going to happen.

504
00:48:14,162 --> 00:48:17,917
May I remind you, they are
under Turkish administration.

505
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:20,050
You going to ask for their permit?

506
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,357
No, and I'm not going
to ask for your permit either.

507
00:48:25,476 --> 00:48:27,279
Do not forget one thing.

508
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:31,450
Do not forget that soon
we intend to inherit their empire,

509
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,250
and I do not want trouble,
I do not want trouble
for our ongoing efforts.

510
00:48:36,252 --> 00:48:39,424
You will not stir up
confrontations with Turkey

511
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:42,741
because of the Bedouins.
They are feuding amongst themselves.

512
00:48:42,841 --> 00:48:48,909
Now, this little venture of yours,
is counterproductive,
and it is dangerous.

513
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:52,780
You have no power to stop me.

514
00:48:55,171 --> 00:48:58,600
You will not leave.

515
00:48:58,650 --> 00:48:59,991
Yes, I will.

516
00:49:00,142 --> 00:49:02,506
I have already been out there
and I am going back.

517
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:03,905
Good day, gentlemen.

518
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,719
Miss Bell, even if it costs me

519
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,221
to let the Turkish authorities know
about your plans,

520
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:10,143
they will intercept you.

521
00:49:10,476 --> 00:49:15,046
This silly business of yours
is not going to happen!

522
00:49:35,933 --> 00:49:38,339
- Fattuh.
- Yes, Miss Bell.

523
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:43,251
Do you and the rest of the men know
that we may, we may all be arrested?

524
00:49:43,353 --> 00:49:44,681
I'm prepared.

525
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:47,300
Even for that?

526
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,431
Fattuh is always prepared.

527
00:50:09,848 --> 00:50:10,982
You are under arrest!

528
00:50:10,984 --> 00:50:12,887
All of you are under arrest!

529
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:21,952
Lieutenant.. is there something
I can help you with?

530
00:50:22,054 --> 00:50:24,250
Who allowed you to leave
in the middle of the night,

531
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,421
without a permit
by the authorities?

532
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:29,744
- Effendi there must be some misunderstand...
- We do have a permit.

533
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,262
- You, who are you?
- I'm Fattuh. The servant of Miss Bell.

534
00:50:35,995 --> 00:50:40,098
Miss Gertrude Bell, I know who you are.
Do you have any weapons?

535
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:42,640
Ah no. No we do not.

536
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:58,113
- This document comes directly...
- It comes directly from Istanbul.

537
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,684
Directly from the ministry.

538
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:03,695
Miss Bell, I am so sorry.

539
00:51:04,325 --> 00:51:06,366
I had a cable from our headquarters
in Amman...

540
00:51:06,368 --> 00:51:10,338
Yes well, a man probably just
wasn't notified by your government.

541
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:14,810
The ways of bureaucracy are labyrinthine.
It's always the same, even in London,

542
00:51:15,012 --> 00:51:17,099
at our Foreign Office, so...

543
00:51:17,101 --> 00:51:19,707
- Is that so?
- Yes. Yes.

544
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:24,082
Thank you, Lieutenant.

545
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:26,548
Your horses look like
they need some water.

546
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,839
Would you like to share
a moment with us?

547
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:37,747
Where did you get the permit?

548
00:51:37,949 --> 00:51:40,814
I know this scribe
in the main mosque in Amman.

549
00:51:40,816 --> 00:51:43,697
He can forge anything
for a good bakchich.

550
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:45,615
Fattuh.

551
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,965
Lieutenant.

552
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:56,070
Did you ah.. did you come
from the garrison at the railway?

553
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:58,172
Yes, lady.

554
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:01,112
And how many cavalry
are stationed there?

555
00:52:01,936 --> 00:52:03,155
About 60.

556
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:04,876
But the numbers are dwindling.

557
00:52:04,878 --> 00:52:06,724
We were 100 in April.

558
00:52:06,726 --> 00:52:09,562
- Artillery?
- All gone.

559
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,886
I should not tell you that.

560
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,664
I'm just a traveller
and a scientist.

561
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,937
Everyone knows that,
that the forces of the Ottoman Empire

562
00:52:17,938 --> 00:52:20,035
are somewhat overstretched.

563
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,406
Besides, it's all officially
in the papers.

564
00:52:23,746 --> 00:52:25,706
But my outpost is not in the papers.

565
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,579
Lieutenant.

566
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:31,822
I would like to offer you
a photograph.

567
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:35,228
You are very kind, lady Bell.

568
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,402
- You and your men. Do you accept?
- Yeah I'd like to.

569
00:52:39,544 --> 00:52:42,800
And because I do not wish
to carry a military secret,

570
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,500
I am going to give you,
the exposed negative.

571
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:49,575
- You can have it developed in Aman.
- Thank you.

572
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,624
I would say right in the middle.

573
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:56,965
Yes.

574
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,804
Ah! The light is beautiful.

575
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:01,207
Over here.

576
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:05,313
Superb.

577
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,351
More water, Omar.

578
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:05,980
Fine.

579
00:55:06,311 --> 00:55:09,185
This well has plenty of water.

580
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:12,137
We can fill her bath all the way.

581
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:46,642
Dear diary,

582
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:51,713
we have reached an oasis,
that is something from a Bedouin fable.

583
00:55:52,277 --> 00:55:56,586
The solitude of the desert
gives me consolation in my own solitude.

584
00:55:58,771 --> 00:56:03,168
Fattuh asked me why I always
request two glasses of tea.

585
00:56:04,515 --> 00:56:05,577
Should I tell him

586
00:56:05,578 --> 00:56:08,814
this is for the man,
who lives in my heart?

587
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:09,931
Day in, day out.
We keep moving ahead,

588
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:13,448
and setting up camp
is the same familiar routine.

589
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:17,278
But the deeper we immerse
ourselves into the desert,

590
00:57:17,929 --> 00:57:20,555
the more everything seems like a dream.

591
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:26,374
Some days we move across terrain
that is almost impassable.

592
00:57:27,414 --> 00:57:31,609
Over hard crusts of salt,
like shards of broken porcelain.

593
00:57:34,925 --> 00:57:40,226
Often I don't follow any map,
but merely go, where my curiosity leads me.

594
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:47,137
East of the Dead Sea, I explored
the hidden gorge of Wadi Mujib.

595
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:51,472
I never expected to find
water so fresh in the desert.

596
00:57:57,086 --> 00:58:00,308
The deeper I penetrate
this mysterious labyrinth,

597
00:58:01,255 --> 00:58:03,543
the more I become known to myself.

598
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,751
Near the end of the gorge,
Fattuh found something curious.

599
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:36,500
It turned out to be
a Neolithic spearhead,

600
00:58:36,702 --> 00:58:38,995
at least 10,000 years old.

601
00:58:42,594 --> 00:58:45,178
I speculated that
in prehistoric times,

602
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,579
there must have been war here,

603
00:58:47,314 --> 00:58:50,067
and that this must have been
a very defensible place.

604
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:53,559
But Fattuh said: "This cannot be."

605
00:58:53,841 --> 00:58:56,512
At such an early time,
the world was paradise.

606
00:58:57,085 --> 00:59:01,507
and paradise is meant to come upon us
again if we live a righteous life,

607
00:59:02,102 --> 00:59:04,232
as foretold by the Prophet.

608
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:09,497
Paradise has no time,
no age, no dwelling place.

609
00:59:10,182 --> 00:59:11,611
It awaits us.

610
00:59:15,944 --> 00:59:19,131
This made me eager
to go deeper into archaeology.

611
00:59:20,814 --> 00:59:24,847
Not far from the gorge
is the British excavation site of Petra.

612
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:31,247
It was a hard day's travel,
because of the arrival of early rain.

613
00:59:32,722 --> 00:59:34,578
Greetings.

614
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,600
Welcome, Miss Bell!

615
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,300
Welcome to our home!

616
00:59:38,447 --> 00:59:42,500
I'm Campbell Thompson.
This is my colleague, T.E. Lawrence.

617
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,000
And what does, "T.E." stand for?

618
00:59:47,705 --> 00:59:50,151
T.E. stands for Thomas Edward.

619
00:59:50,372 --> 00:59:53,200
I despise both names,
they're an abomination.

620
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,753
- Please just call me Lawrence.
- Will do, Lawrence.

621
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,461
We knew you were coming.

622
00:59:58,563 --> 01:00:01,200
Really? We didn't send messengers.

623
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,250
A myriad of stars see you at night,

624
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,468
and during the day, the rustling sand
announced your footsteps.

625
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:09,500
Sorry umm.. he's always like this.

626
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:14,500
And what's a school boy like you
doing out here, Lawrence?

627
01:00:14,602 --> 01:00:17,800
Ahh.. this particular school boy
has a PhD in archaeology.

628
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,064
Thompson eh...

629
01:00:19,468 --> 01:00:22,100
I have a PhD
in medieval pottery shards.

630
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,600
It follows me around like
the wafting of an old spinster's fart.

631
01:00:26,086 --> 01:00:28,011
How I long to be rid of it!

632
01:00:29,332 --> 01:00:30,218
Shall we?

633
01:00:45,144 --> 01:00:46,625
This place is a dump.

634
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,600
Everything has been moved
by grave robbers,

635
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,182
over and over again.

636
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:53,448
We're simply stuck here.

637
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:56,600
Lawrence is dreaming
of great treasures, hoards of gold.

638
01:00:57,907 --> 01:00:59,070
At least...

639
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:02,536
Lord Almighty, give us a library
of Babylonian clay tablets

640
01:01:02,636 --> 01:01:05,246
the likes the Germans
have excavated in Mesopotamia.

641
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,800
Our excavation methods
are no match for theirs.

642
01:01:09,655 --> 01:01:11,314
This is true, Gertrude, darling.

643
01:01:13,725 --> 01:01:14,976
"Darling".

644
01:01:17,246 --> 01:01:19,830
You know, I made a big mistake,
wearing this belt here.

645
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:23,212
This kind of belt
is only worn by bachelors.

646
01:01:23,582 --> 01:01:24,692
And..?

647
01:01:24,694 --> 01:01:28,231
And, the local excavation workers

648
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,435
have been trying to find me a wife.

649
01:01:30,537 --> 01:01:33,400
Imagine, a wife for me
how horrible!

650
01:01:34,535 --> 01:01:36,076
But, they heard of your arrival

651
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,800
and, an instant rumour spread
that you are my bride,

652
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,211
sent from England.

653
01:01:43,718 --> 01:01:46,157
I'm not sure the right man for you
has been born yet.

654
01:01:50,983 --> 01:01:53,500
To me the Ottoman Empire
can't last much longer,

655
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,000
I mean it looks like the Roman Empire
shortly before its collapse.

656
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,886
What do you think's gonna happen?

657
01:02:00,589 --> 01:02:01,700
Chaos.

658
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,800
Chaos and war.

659
01:02:05,986 --> 01:02:07,761
Don't you think the British Empire
will take over

660
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:10,604
- and fill the void of power?
- No, I beg to differ.

661
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:15,889
I believe that what with the Arabs
whose spirit of nationhood will emerge.

662
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,204
They are the future.

663
01:02:18,715 --> 01:02:20,414
Eh, perhaps, but...

664
01:02:20,472 --> 01:02:24,965
Any meaningful change
may take centuries to launch.

665
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,681
- It will happen in our lifetime...
- Enough, enough politics.

666
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,506
Decades.

667
01:02:28,808 --> 01:02:31,265
We are archaeologists.

668
01:02:31,267 --> 01:02:33,441
So far, I'm only a traveller.

669
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,001
Well then, to the travellers.

670
01:02:36,103 --> 01:02:40,400
And to those who dig up mysteries
from under the surface.

671
01:02:41,999 --> 01:02:44,019
I'm sorry, we have no glasses.

672
01:02:51,547 --> 01:02:52,940
You know what, Gertrude?

673
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:56,276
Regardless of what anyone says,

674
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:59,218
under the benign,
soft glove of campfire,

675
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:02,000
with good scotch in your fist,

676
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,112
make a terrific bride.

677
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:35,000
Gertie!

678
01:03:36,135 --> 01:03:38,003
You had breakfast yet?

679
01:03:38,534 --> 01:03:40,693
Got a hangover.

680
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:46,375
Ohh I've got a, Roman Empire
size headache.

681
01:03:46,898 --> 01:03:49,371
What a shame that we do
not have Rome set on fire,

682
01:03:49,373 --> 01:03:53,168
Nero singing to us live,
bemoaning the conflagration

683
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,550
he himself started just to get
into the right mood.

684
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,702
- Those were the good old days.
- Lawrence, keep it down.

685
01:04:00,243 --> 01:04:00,870
Gertie.

686
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,339
You can't leave.

687
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:06,775
The local women might try
to wife me off again.

688
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,400
Do you want me to kiss you
in front of everyone?

689
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,859
Absolutely.

690
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,700
My kiss,

691
01:04:16,345 --> 01:04:17,800
my kiss shall liberate you.

692
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,600
Ow, wonderful!

693
01:04:24,263 --> 01:04:25,479
Gertie,

694
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,700
would you please, not marry me?

695
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,875
Absolutely.

696
01:04:43,919 --> 01:04:45,200
Please, do come in.

697
01:04:46,241 --> 01:04:48,066
Miss Bell, the consul.

698
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:52,037
Miss Bell, welcome!

699
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,102
Welcome back!

700
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:57,937
Before we talk business,
allow me to congratulate you

701
01:04:58,037 --> 01:05:00,543
on your feat of alluding
the Turkish authorities.

702
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,683
Well, I had a permit,
if you know what I mean.

703
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,701
Ohh.. how did you forge it?

704
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,306
Wasn't me, it was a, scribe
from the Great Mosque,

705
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,757
one of the finest.

706
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,933
Yes, it was my servant
who contacted him.

707
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:17,290
Well I'm sure if you ever needed
a document, we could arrange...

708
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,551
Ahh.. the British Empire has
no need for such petty tricks.

709
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:20,604
No.

710
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,960
Except for printing millions
of counterfeit Deutschmarks

711
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,773
and Turkish piastres in order
to undermine their economies.

712
01:05:25,854 --> 01:05:27,784
Please, take a seat.

713
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,102
Well...

714
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:39,992
I'm here to inform you of my plans
to travel to the Jabal Druze.

715
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:41,600
You can't be serious.

716
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,600
Yes, I most certainly am.

717
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,915
No one has travelled
to the Druze in decades.

718
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,474
So it's about time.

719
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:52,200
No British soldier
will accompany you, Miss Bell.

720
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,685
It would mean a provocation
for the Druze people.

721
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,292
- I myself as a soldier...
- Major...

722
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,484
Major of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers.

723
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:05,000
Miss Bell, we seem to know quite
a lot about each other already.

724
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,300
Major...

725
01:06:06,973 --> 01:06:11,050
I'm here to ask you for what you're already
so graciously, volunteering.

726
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,822
Even if you do not hear from me
for several months

727
01:06:13,922 --> 01:06:15,651
pay no attention and send no one.

728
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:20,500
The Druze will take you for a spy.

729
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,000
Yes, well maybe I am.

730
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,404
Maybe I am a spy,
but I am a spy for no one.

731
01:06:25,405 --> 01:06:27,591
No one but myself.

732
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:37,819
I am the consul's wife.

733
01:06:37,854 --> 01:06:39,970
- Yes.
- Don't be so formal, dear.

734
01:06:40,835 --> 01:06:43,395
Miss Bell, this is Judith. Welcome.

735
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:45,653
I ah.. brought you a present.

736
01:06:45,688 --> 01:06:47,518
One for each of you.

737
01:06:48,553 --> 01:06:50,205
Oh this is very kind.

738
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,001
Oh it's just something
I found in a souk.

739
01:06:52,036 --> 01:06:55,120
- What do I do with it?
- That's just beautiful.

740
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:59,335
They show the rank of a sheik my love,
so don't use them in the kitchen
for your onions.

741
01:07:00,764 --> 01:07:01,862
Come.

742
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,529
But the Druze are fiercely independent.

743
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,681
And more than anything, anti-Turkish.

744
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:15,152
In fact, they're the only people ever
to have defeated the Turks.

745
01:07:15,187 --> 01:07:17,639
And this is what makes them
so interesting.

746
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:21,503
Besides, their faith incorporates
Christian, Gnostic, Neoplatonic tenets

747
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:23,483
which overlay their Islamic beliefs.

748
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:25,700
Please, let's not talk about Plato.

749
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:28,491
Would you like
some more of the couscous?

750
01:07:28,492 --> 01:07:30,800
We're not talking about Plato,
my love.

751
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,253
We are talking about a very grave danger
Miss Bell will face.

752
01:07:34,712 --> 01:07:36,300
Will all be worthwhile.

753
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,268
Be careful.

754
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:41,781
The Druze do not play the game
as it should be played.

755
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,820
They go out to slay,
and they spare no one.

756
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,560
While they have enough
dry powder in their flasks,

757
01:07:48,561 --> 01:07:50,097
and strength to pull the trigger,

758
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:53,071
they kill every man,
woman and child they encounter.

759
01:07:53,106 --> 01:07:54,559
How awful!

760
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,800
I want you to have them.

761
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,980
No...

762
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,800
No, it's too much.

763
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,475
Dear...

764
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:20,591
Have you not said on several occasions
that you would never give these pistols away?

765
01:08:22,492 --> 01:08:23,528
Well...

766
01:08:25,255 --> 01:08:27,523
And now they are, given away.

767
01:08:28,884 --> 01:08:31,063
Miss Bell, for you.

768
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,700
For me?

769
01:09:05,191 --> 01:09:09,159
We are travelling across
the vast expanse of Bedouin lands,

770
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,801
and my eyes are opening
to the complexity

771
01:09:12,102 --> 01:09:14,200
of tribal relations here.

772
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:18,976
Fattuh has been my gracious teacher
in all of this.

773
01:09:19,011 --> 01:09:24,100
He says that the most volatile conflict
is between the Druze, and the Beni Sakhr.

774
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,571
My worry is, is Omar, Miss Bell.

775
01:09:34,928 --> 01:09:37,729
Yes, I only found out this morning
that he was Beni Sakhr.

776
01:09:40,484 --> 01:09:41,759
Should we leave him behind?

777
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,044
Well there's no mercy
between Druze and Beni Sakhr.

778
01:09:45,144 --> 01:09:48,990
If two of them meet,
only one survives.

779
01:10:05,089 --> 01:10:06,130
Lady Bell!

780
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,960
Yes.

781
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:12,575
I realize that the Druze
would recognize Omar as a Beni Sakhr

782
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:13,776
by his accent.

783
01:10:14,323 --> 01:10:16,208
Ahhhh.. I did not think about that.

784
01:10:17,509 --> 01:10:18,361
What do we do?

785
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,505
Ask Omar.

786
01:10:22,599 --> 01:10:25,591
Omar, should I send you back
before it's too late?

787
01:10:31,729 --> 01:10:34,100
Omar suddenly became a deaf-mute.

788
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:36,397
When?

789
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:38,056
An hour ago.

790
01:11:16,824 --> 01:11:19,175
You are my prisoners,
you will die!

791
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,235
- All of you!
- If I die,

792
01:11:22,599 --> 01:11:24,250
it shall be at the hands
of your sheikh.

793
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:27,310
Where is your sheikh?
Take me to him.

794
01:11:27,345 --> 01:11:29,723
- Miss Bell, you're wounded!
- Nothing.

795
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:33,570
Nothing.
Take me to your sheikh now!

796
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,545
Now!

797
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,192
A woman passes through the entrance
at the women's side.

798
01:11:53,227 --> 01:11:55,543
This woman is joining the men.

799
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:03,850
Sit down.

800
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,562
Sit down, woman.

801
01:12:07,976 --> 01:12:09,396
Please.

802
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,435
Who are you to dare come here?

803
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,370
I am Gertrude Bell.

804
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,421
And I am a subject
of the British Empire.

805
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:23,405
Thank the Almighty
that you're not German.

806
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,900
Have a seat, please.

807
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:29,344
I thank him every day that I am not.

808
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:43,500
- Are you a spy?
- No.

809
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,126
I am a writer.

810
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:49,622
I write about the beauty of the land
and its people.

811
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,022
So you're a poet.

812
01:12:53,055 --> 01:12:56,900
In a way, but in fact,
I.. I do not describe...

813
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,900
what I see...

814
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,862
I.. I.. I just name its beauty.

815
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:04,400
More in the vein of the...

816
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:06,615
..Roman poet Virgil.

817
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:08,020
Who is an Aeneid.

818
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:11,810
Yes.

819
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:18,851
I'm so sorry, but how does the sheikh
of the Druze know about Virgil?

820
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:23,219
I have travelled... incognito.

821
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,738
I've been to Damascus.

822
01:13:25,773 --> 01:13:27,101
To Beirut.

823
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,590
To Paris.

824
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:32,261
Les Champs-Elysées,
... avenue du monde.

825
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:33,911
Baudelaire...

826
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,930
Et ses "Fleurs du mal". Rimbaud.

827
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:41,524
You're right,
this poet never describes anything.

828
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:44,626
He just names
the glory of the trees,

829
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,185
the beehives...

830
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,208
and the life in the country.

831
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,257
He's like our poets.

832
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:56,282
This is true.

833
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:02,674
May I ask in
one of my trusted men?

834
01:14:02,675 --> 01:14:04,124
Please do.

835
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,946
Fattuh,

836
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:10,358
would you fetch me my wooden case?

837
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:13,657
Miss Bell,

838
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:17,000
I hope my men didn't hurt you.

839
01:14:17,503 --> 01:14:24,364
They did, but it is a small wound.
It is what we call um.. merely a graze.

840
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,200
Forgive them.

841
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,698
They know no better.

842
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,360
I'm sorry.

843
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,952
I want like to give you a gift.

844
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:42,340
It is something very precious to me
and it was given to me. And now,

845
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,666
now it is yours.

846
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:53,883
Exquisite!

847
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:57,683
Stay as my guest.

848
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,240
You are under the protection
of our hospitality.

849
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:58,827
Good to have you back.

850
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:02,410
A noble bare wound... but alive.

851
01:16:02,511 --> 01:16:04,852
Please, it's nothing. Nothing.

852
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,600
But I have to admit something, I..

853
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:11,248
- I gave away your pistols
- They were not mine, they were yours.

854
01:16:11,283 --> 01:16:13,350
No, but you gave them to me.

855
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,800
They were ornamental anyway.

856
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:17,930
And finally, finally it became useful.
Assumed a purpose.

857
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:20,050
- I'm sorry.
- Miss Bell,

858
01:16:20,085 --> 01:16:23,241
will you please be quiet?
Finally, something happened.

859
01:16:23,642 --> 01:16:24,403
Bullets.

860
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,461
Now I have a new plan,
I want to go to Hyell.

861
01:16:32,496 --> 01:16:35,900
But it is the middle of the Arabian desert.
It is the forbidden zone.

862
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,200
Yes and we have only a few reports
from.. from some travellers in the 1850s.

863
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,149
Why for God's sake Hyell?

864
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:46,553
Because it is the secret epicentre
of the Arab world

865
01:16:46,588 --> 01:16:48,789
and I want to meet the Emir Ibn Rashid.

866
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:52,451
He is important.
He is the leader of Arabia.

867
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,420
- Who would be with you?
- Fattuh.

868
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:56,968
And my men.

869
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:00,073
What? I trust them.

870
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:18,634
You've arrived too early.

871
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,942
- Want me to come back later?
- No.

872
01:17:21,977 --> 01:17:23,117
No, no, no.

873
01:17:23,152 --> 01:17:24,572
What's going on?

874
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:28,588
- This stallion is for you.
- For me?

875
01:17:28,589 --> 01:17:30,624
Well you'll need the best horse in Arabia.

876
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:35,186
Hoh! But you're painting it!
Never seen anything like it.

877
01:17:35,187 --> 01:17:36,222
Well...

878
01:17:38,548 --> 01:17:40,979
- Well, what?
- I have to make a confession.

879
01:17:43,391 --> 01:17:45,136
I stole him for you!

880
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,447
You stole this horse for me?

881
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:50,363
See what he can do.

882
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,800
Bravo!

883
01:18:04,562 --> 01:18:07,010
Bravo, Salhadin.
Bravo, Salhadin.

884
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,550
Bravo.

885
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:13,340
I didn't exactly steal him, you understand,
it was more an act of expropriation.

886
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,622
-  Where? From whom?
- From the Turkish authorities.

887
01:18:16,657 --> 01:18:18,243
From the enemy, so to speak.

888
01:18:18,244 --> 01:18:19,244
How?

889
01:18:19,769 --> 01:18:21,918
Well, there were two things I did.

890
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,717
I paid off an editor
of a local newspaper

891
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:28,230
to write about a disease
spreading amongst the horses.

892
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:32,973
Then, I took on false credentials
as a vet,

893
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,585
I went straight to the Turkish garrison,
I inspected the horses,

894
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:40,613
this stallion here of course
had to be removed immediately,

895
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:43,150
and I put him straight
into quarantine.

896
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:47,097
So, His Excellency,
the British consul

897
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:50,893
- Richard Doughty-Wylie...
- I've stolen a horse for you.

898
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,499
Ah, Miss Bell.

899
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,700
- I have summoned you and I felt...
- No one summons me.

900
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:17,238
I have, ah.. invited you.

901
01:19:17,273 --> 01:19:18,584
That sounds vaguely better.

902
01:19:18,619 --> 01:19:22,200
Yes. Well let's get straight
at it then, shall we?

903
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:27,506
You ventured out, and I felt
not inclined to support this.

904
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,026
To put it mildly.

905
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:33,010
With the size and momentum
of the Great War that is gaining,

906
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:35,909
it would be of considerable value
for our country

907
01:19:36,009 --> 01:19:39,920
if you could make your curiosity
more... systematic.

908
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,073
Meaning what?

909
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,004
You would be our only spy

910
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,512
in a vast area
we have little intelligence about.

911
01:19:48,324 --> 01:19:51,300
In short... no.

912
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:55,000
- A blunt no.
- Correct. A blunt no.

913
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:57,408
I operate for no one.

914
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:03,396
What is it then that attracts you
to the Bedouin out there?

915
01:20:03,397 --> 01:20:06,658
It is something that you and your world
would never understand.

916
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:09,800
It's their freedom.

917
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,500
It's their dignity.

918
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:16,170
It's their poetry of life.

919
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:22,759
Have a good day.

920
01:21:23,209 --> 01:21:24,398
Mr. Wylie!

921
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,975
Richard. Please say Richard.

922
01:21:30,274 --> 01:21:31,874
Richard...

923
01:21:35,338 --> 01:21:37,529
I'm not ready, uh..

924
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,246
I would never be with...

925
01:21:41,281 --> 01:21:42,618
Would never what?

926
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,556
I would never be with a man again.

927
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:51,863
Because I, uh...

928
01:21:52,636 --> 01:21:54,224
I lost a man.

929
01:21:56,082 --> 01:21:57,874
- Lost?
- Yes.

930
01:22:00,228 --> 01:22:01,695
I'm a widow.

931
01:22:06,773 --> 01:22:07,773
A widow?

932
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,980
Yes! No, no, I, uh...

933
01:22:13,781 --> 01:22:15,196
Sort of.

934
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:26,489
- O what a clumsy fool I've been.
- No, it's, uh...

935
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,747
Will you forgive me?

936
01:22:32,003 --> 01:22:33,317
Of course.

937
01:22:42,394 --> 01:22:43,628
Well...

938
01:22:58,536 --> 01:23:03,100
I see a bright future. Greatness.

939
01:23:03,689 --> 01:23:06,602
With abundant wealth.

940
01:23:08,243 --> 01:23:11,072
A great destiny will take shape.

941
01:23:11,838 --> 01:23:15,000
No. I will forge my own destiny.

942
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:18,500
What else do we need?

943
01:23:18,754 --> 01:23:23,348
Ah, quinine, iodine, and
antidote against scorpions.

944
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:28,140
No, scorpions, no.
We will be watchful.

945
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:31,517
No Bedouin has ever been stung,
am I right?

946
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:34,397
Yes, yes m'am. As you wish.

947
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,665
This market has everything we need.

948
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:40,576
Mosquito net, a folding bed,
a canvas bathtub.

949
01:23:40,611 --> 01:23:41,711
We need this.

950
01:23:42,074 --> 01:23:43,971
Well, the lady has a good eye.

951
01:23:44,006 --> 01:23:46,094
Assure you they are the best.

952
01:23:46,431 --> 01:23:50,718
Hey boss, we might need four saddles.
How much apiece?

953
01:23:50,865 --> 01:23:52,516
The Noble Lady doesn't pay.

954
01:23:52,902 --> 01:23:54,300
Welcome.

955
01:23:55,179 --> 01:23:56,353
Why?

956
01:23:56,577 --> 01:24:00,600
The Lady is a guest of our Sheik.
Guests don't pay. Welcome.

957
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,563
- Four of these.
- I'll have them ready.

958
01:24:05,365 --> 01:24:07,034
Thank you very much.

959
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:18,000
- I have confession to make.
- A confession?

960
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,200
Yes.

961
01:24:21,076 --> 01:24:22,566
As wonderful as the horse was,

962
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:25,700
it would never have made it
in the dunes of the Necru desert.

963
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,321
Yes, and what did you do?

964
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,700
I traded it. Well, Fattuh
traded it in the market place.

965
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:36,001
For four of the very best dromedaries.
There they are.

966
01:24:37,802 --> 01:24:39,200
I'm sorry.

967
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:43,000
Gertrude, don't leave. Not now.

968
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:45,817
Richard, I have no choice.

969
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,048
My heart is not ready.

970
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:54,600
I can feel that.

971
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:00,100
- Stay for just a few more weeks.
- No, it's late December.

972
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,000
Very soon, the desert
won't be passible.

973
01:25:06,637 --> 01:25:09,889
- I'm am longing for you.
- Please do not say that.

974
01:25:09,924 --> 01:25:12,255
Do not say these things.

975
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:21,300
- Well it will be very lonely without you.
- You have a wife.

976
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,366
It is the most unbearable loneliness
to be married unhappily.

977
01:25:25,401 --> 01:25:29,001
This comes at me
from nowhere. Nowhere, Richard.

978
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:33,602
Besides, I could never fully be yours.
You are a married man.

979
01:25:36,369 --> 01:25:37,822
I will settle everything.

980
01:25:41,879 --> 01:25:43,300
Will you write to me?

981
01:25:47,087 --> 01:25:51,338
Yes I'll write you from every,
every post office in the desert.

982
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,422
I will keep a diary for you.

983
01:26:05,529 --> 01:26:07,310
The wind is shouting...

984
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:09,719
Shouting what?

985
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:15,000
The wind is shouting of sand...
and shouting storm.

986
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:02,400
Can the lady show me how to do it?

987
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:04,500
To cook an egg?

988
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:08,300
The desert knows no eggs.
The desert knows no hens.

989
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:11,100
Uhhh.. you boil it for 5 minutes.

990
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,900
The desert knows no.. minutes.

991
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:16,600
The length of a prayer.

992
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,600
Ohh.. ever present.

993
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,000
Richard...

994
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:35,300
I am trying to keep you
out of my thoughts,

995
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:37,429
but it is strange.

996
01:29:37,464 --> 01:29:41,100
You are on my mind
in every step of the desert.

997
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,900
My cook does not have
a notion of time.

998
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:46,460
He has never boiled an egg.

999
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:51,710
Already I have dropped back into the desert
as if it were my own place.

1000
01:29:53,404 --> 01:29:57,853
Silence and solitude fall around me
like an impenetrable veil.

1001
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:02,050
Sleep more profound
than civilization contrives,

1002
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:05,700
and then, the roadless desert,

1003
01:30:05,805 --> 01:30:07,307
again.

1004
01:30:15,228 --> 01:30:18,255
Before the tribal wars,
this place was alive.

1005
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:21,603
Now they're only ghosts here.

1006
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:36,000
What is this?

1007
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:39,856
How is this possible?

1008
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:43,600
Is it from the consul?

1009
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:48,481
The consul's messenger
must have been riding day and night.

1010
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:53,285
We shall stay here tonight.

1011
01:30:58,692 --> 01:31:00,060
My beloved,

1012
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:05,272
the desert has you
and my heart is with you.

1013
01:31:06,311 --> 01:31:09,500
If I was free
and a very perfect night,

1014
01:31:09,601 --> 01:31:13,944
it would be more fitting
to take you and kiss you.

1015
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:18,300
God seems to have joined us
for some divine moment.

1016
01:31:20,305 --> 01:31:21,900
Ah, the ecstasy!

1017
01:31:23,932 --> 01:31:25,255
We might reach it again,

1018
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:28,100
on an outpost of time.

1019
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:39,669
Ahhh.. I can't sleep..
I can't sleep.

1020
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,882
It is one in the morning.

1021
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:47,952
You and you and you
are between me and any rest.

1022
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:51,300
You once called me life.

1023
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:56,500
And fire. I flame, and I'm consumed.

1024
01:31:56,854 --> 01:31:59,732
There is a voice in me
I try to chase away. It says...

1025
01:31:59,733 --> 01:32:04,100
"Before all other world,
claim me and take me."

1026
01:32:06,376 --> 01:32:07,830
And yet...

1027
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,500
Deliver this please.

1028
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,000
It's not enough.

1029
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:36,600
This is a desert, not a post office.

1030
01:32:36,803 --> 01:32:39,800
I only have this donkey for transportation.

1031
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,300
Is this enough?

1032
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,500
Thank you.

1033
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:11,734
Richard...

1034
01:33:11,769 --> 01:33:16,485
I doubt there is anyone in the world
so happy as I am now.

1035
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,600
You were baptised of the desert,

1036
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,400
and there is no another
salvation for you.

1037
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:27,227
When we are on the move, I feel,

1038
01:33:27,262 --> 01:33:30,145
everything is behind us.

1039
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:33,422
Only our shadows follow,

1040
01:33:33,457 --> 01:33:35,368
as if to remind us

1041
01:33:36,313 --> 01:33:38,082
of our past lives.

1042
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,600
My lady.

1043
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,500
Our sheik wishes to invite you to
have tea with him in his tent.

1044
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:50,600
Does the lady accept the invitation?

1045
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:54,100
Yes, the honor is mine.

1046
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,024
The honor is mine.

1047
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:26,100
Sheik Harb, invites the Lady of the Desert
to his tent.

1048
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,313
Of course, thank you.

1049
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:48,300
According to our tradition, I am honored to
invite you for a dinner feast.

1050
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:52,200
It is an honor to accept your hospitality.

1051
01:35:52,355 --> 01:35:55,300
Anyone who makes it to my tent is a guest.

1052
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:58,000
Your Arabic pronunciation
is excellent.

1053
01:36:25,228 --> 01:36:29,502
The lady is bold,
as bold as any Bedouin man.

1054
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,811
- Is your destination Hyell?
- It is.

1055
01:36:34,667 --> 01:36:36,869
I want to meet Ibin Rashid.

1056
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,800
We have to talk a lot
about Ibin Rashid.

1057
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:43,500
He has powerful enemies.

1058
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,400
Ibn Saud?

1059
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:48,078
Yes, and many others.

1060
01:36:48,113 --> 01:36:51,000
- You will not find him in Hyell.
- Where is he?

1061
01:36:51,130 --> 01:36:53,300
He's at war in the South.

1062
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:56,800
I thought he was at peace
with Yunnan Ze.

1063
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:02,400
Not any longer. Beware of Hyell.
There is a lot of murdering going on.

1064
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,908
- For me?
- Yeap.

1065
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:39,400
Sheik Harb, you've shown me
such gracious hospitality.

1066
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:43,600
And you have entertained me
with wonderful, desert stories.

1067
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:46,300
Every Bedouin is a storyteller.

1068
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:52,776
But you have also given me insight
into the tribes, and insight
into the affairs of Hyell.

1069
01:37:53,556 --> 01:37:56,900
And for that,
I want to thank you.

1070
01:37:57,648 --> 01:38:00,600
I would like to give you.. these.

1071
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,600
These are my binoculars.

1072
01:38:03,623 --> 01:38:06,400
I can see clearly now,
so I do not need them.

1073
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:08,200
These are a gift.

1074
01:38:09,477 --> 01:38:13,818
I have become a, a desert traveller
who is very rich.

1075
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:16,409
Thank you.

1076
01:38:16,444 --> 01:38:19,800
And my guide Hammet,
will be your escort.

1077
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:22,600
No harm will be done to you
on your way.

1078
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,900
But once in Hyell, no one gets out.

1079
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:30,834
Inshallah.
We want to see you again.. alive.

1080
01:38:31,569 --> 01:38:33,100
Inshallah.

1081
01:38:35,747 --> 01:38:37,800
You can see very far.

1082
01:39:40,702 --> 01:39:43,876
The sand is soft, we will camp here.

1083
01:39:44,057 --> 01:39:45,700
What do we do next?

1084
01:39:46,334 --> 01:39:48,000
Wait and see.

1085
01:39:48,251 --> 01:39:52,700
When they come out,
they come out to welcome us,

1086
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:55,400
or they come out to kill us.

1087
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,800
I don't see anyone.

1088
01:39:59,056 --> 01:40:03,000
They are arguing about, what to do with us.

1089
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:49,500
Slaves, I don't know exactly
what this means.

1090
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,389
But it's an insult, I'm sure.

1091
01:40:52,607 --> 01:40:53,927
Only the woman.

1092
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:56,222
Men must stay behind.

1093
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,765
Only the woman is invited here.

1094
01:41:28,214 --> 01:41:31,679
I am Ibrahim, uncle of our beloved Emir.

1095
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:36,600
May I see him?

1096
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,800
He is gone.

1097
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:42,700
When will he be back?

1098
01:41:43,733 --> 01:41:48,300
He is at war with our enemies.
You cannot leave until he returns.

1099
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:56,404
And my men?

1100
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,800
You will stay here.

1101
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:20,652
I am Fatima, the aunt of the emir.

1102
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:23,100
This is Turkia,
who will entertain you.

1103
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,700
Welcome to Hyell.

1104
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,600
You must be the Lady of the Desert.

1105
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:29,000
Rumour has been faster
than your camels.

1106
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:30,935
I'm Gertrude Bell.

1107
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:34,784
Who has sent you?

1108
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,428
No one.

1109
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:40,500
No, I'm here on my own.

1110
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,400
On your own?

1111
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:45,700
I know the world.

1112
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:48,000
I come from Istanbul.

1113
01:43:48,314 --> 01:43:50,900
The Sultan sent me as a gift
to Emir Rashid.

1114
01:43:51,730 --> 01:43:53,402
What are your plans?

1115
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:58,591
I would like to meet Ibn Rashid.

1116
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:28,555
Emir Rashid has been driven out of Hyell.

1117
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:31,428
His women followed him.

1118
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:34,504
And all his Shuma tribesmen.

1119
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,202
But he left me behind.

1120
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:40,826
- He was a guest of the Emir?
- Yes.

1121
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,100
The Emmy Harrud, six years ago.

1122
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:44,815
What happened?

1123
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:49,522
This palace is full of conspiracies.

1124
01:44:49,757 --> 01:44:50,950
Full of murder.

1125
01:44:52,572 --> 01:44:54,599
What happened to the Emir?

1126
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,230
He was assassinated.

1127
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:00,924
And his successor was murdered.
And his successor as well,

1128
01:45:00,959 --> 01:45:02,868
all within a few years.

1129
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,139
The Eunuchs were killed with them,

1130
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:12,671
and the entire harem was passed
from man, to man, to man.

1131
01:45:15,483 --> 01:45:17,400
Who is the ruling Emir now?

1132
01:45:17,509 --> 01:45:20,585
There was hardly anyone left
in his family.

1133
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,605
So he's young.

1134
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,100
He's raiding in the North.

1135
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,100
Fatima, his aunt,

1136
01:45:27,324 --> 01:45:31,200
is the true ruler.
She is the real Emir.

1137
01:45:40,441 --> 01:45:42,041
It's beautiful.

1138
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,978
I have been a prisoner here
for three weeks now.

1139
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,400
You are not a prisoner.

1140
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,586
Your men are taken care of well.

1141
01:46:00,712 --> 01:46:04,239
You are only requested to stay
until the Emir decides.

1142
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:07,612
Decides what?

1143
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,300
If it would be good
to have you here.

1144
01:46:11,670 --> 01:46:12,866
For what?

1145
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:18,786
My wish is to keep you here,
in the harem of the Emir.

1146
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
He would be delighted.

1147
01:46:25,907 --> 01:46:27,545
Ohhh, Fatima...

1148
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:30,144
That is not my wish.

1149
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:35,438
When does he get back?

1150
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:39,860
Do you know?

1151
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,489
I'm delighted to greet my guest.

1152
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:13,750
He means:
"I am delighted to greet my wife,

1153
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,300
into my harem."

1154
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:17,479
Yes, my wife.

1155
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,006
Emir...

1156
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:26,300
It is an honour to meet you.

1157
01:48:26,893 --> 01:48:29,600
However, I am already married.

1158
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,100
I'm a member of the British Consul's harem,

1159
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:37,300
and this would cause a problem
for both the man and his country.

1160
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:40,300
I was told otherwise.

1161
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:47,838
"No man ever touches a married woman",

1162
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:53,784
the Prophet, peace be upon him,
has taught us.

1163
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:59,700
Dear Richard,
it's clear from what I've seen

1164
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:02,800
that the house of Rashid
is moving towards its demise.

1165
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:08,700
It now appears that, Ibn Salstar
is in the ascendant,

1166
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:12,569
and that the future of Central Arabia
lies, with him,

1167
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:15,200
not the people of Hyell.

1168
01:50:15,335 --> 01:50:18,900
I shall communicate this
to the British Arab Bureau.

1169
01:50:24,222 --> 01:50:28,048
The explorations that I have undertaken
these past years,

1170
01:50:28,687 --> 01:50:32,600
the terrain and its people,
of tribal life and governments,

1171
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:37,833
have culminated in a unique picture,
one that only I can paint.

1172
01:50:53,049 --> 01:50:57,300
As for myself, I sense that
long years of preparation,

1173
01:50:57,750 --> 01:51:00,877
preparation for what I do not know,
have ended,

1174
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:04,099
and a new destiny,

1175
01:51:04,134 --> 01:51:05,963
is unfolding before me.

1176
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:14,429
I have only now, to return to you.

1177
01:51:48,104 --> 01:51:49,729
Let's find somewhere quiet.

1178
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:02,041
I've read your diary.

1179
01:52:03,954 --> 01:52:05,905
It was meant for you.

1180
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:08,270
The world is changing.

1181
01:52:11,374 --> 01:52:15,312
While I was in the desert, the war
turned into a World Wide War, and I..

1182
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,737
I didn't even notice.

1183
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:20,441
All of Europe now.

1184
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,624
Russia, Japan...

1185
01:52:27,961 --> 01:52:30,958
and America now.
They will have their say too.

1186
01:52:35,402 --> 01:52:37,539
Gertrude, there's something
that I want to tell you.

1187
01:52:41,823 --> 01:52:44,309
I have reenlisted for active service.

1188
01:52:54,838 --> 01:52:56,410
I expected it.

1189
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,976
The moment I'm back from war,

1190
01:53:01,110 --> 01:53:03,595
I shall put everything in order
with Judith.

1191
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:07,329
I shall be free.

1192
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:12,500
I'd rather put a bullet in my head,

1193
01:53:12,563 --> 01:53:14,100
than live without you.

1194
01:53:17,468 --> 01:53:18,991
Why do you say that?

1195
01:53:27,088 --> 01:53:28,929
Gertrude...

1196
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:33,100
There is something you should know.

1197
01:53:34,848 --> 01:53:37,600
Judith has been making
ominous remarks about...

1198
01:53:39,353 --> 01:53:42,586
about committing suicide
if I should try to divorce her.

1199
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:45,729
I see.

1200
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:47,400
I do not believe it, but...

1201
01:53:53,772 --> 01:53:57,896
Love is a tyrant, sparing none.

1202
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:38,600
Gertie... Oriental secretary.
Congratulations.

1203
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:41,100
It's as if they invented
the post for you.

1204
01:54:43,522 --> 01:54:46,659
- All this is your staff?
- It is.

1205
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:51,872
You have become senior advisor,
Lawrence.

1206
01:54:52,647 --> 01:54:55,324
You've morphed into a political animal.

1207
01:54:55,537 --> 01:54:59,300
- Technically, I'm under you, but...
- What?

1208
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:03,675
There are no other men like me, and
no other women like you either, of course.

1209
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:06,818
You've become some kind of, queen.

1210
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:11,000
No, just a woman
who misses her man.

1211
01:55:11,525 --> 01:55:14,300
Oh you mean your officer
who joined in the glories of war.

1212
01:55:16,035 --> 01:55:17,435
Yes, I do.

1213
01:55:21,433 --> 01:55:24,465
Miss Bell, could you nudge
a little bit closer, please?
We'd like to get

1214
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,800
- the Giza Pyramids in the frame.
- Mr Churchill!

1215
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:28,124
Still, please.

1216
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:32,222
Mr. Churchill, what are you expecting
from the conference?

1217
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:33,994
Boys, let's face it...

1218
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:35,900
a new order of the Arab World.

1219
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,014
Mr. Churchill, with this new emphasis
on the Middle East,

1220
01:55:39,049 --> 01:55:42,000
where does that leave off policy
towards British India?

1221
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:46,862
Churchill is trying to sell this
as an achievement of the British Empire.

1222
01:55:47,470 --> 01:55:50,100
- What else is it?
- Come on, Lawrence.

1223
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,700
We are not leading them to autonomy,

1224
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:55,000
it's the Arab nations who are awakening.
This is their achievement.

1225
01:55:55,790 --> 01:55:57,422
Yes of course.

1226
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,982
The Lions of the British Empire.

1227
01:56:04,370 --> 01:56:05,858
Mr Lawrence, over this way please,

1228
01:56:05,859 --> 01:56:08,500
with the pyramids in the background,
for the photographers. Gentlemen...

1229
01:56:08,607 --> 01:56:11,200
You're having a shot.
A little to the left, sir.

1230
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:15,800
Hold tight, Mr. Lawrence.

1231
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:18,800
Gentlemen, are we getting this camp?
The shot is marvellous.

1232
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:22,749
Mister Lawrence!

1233
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:27,445
Marvellous. Boys,
are you getting this?

1234
01:56:27,446 --> 01:56:29,600
One more like that,
please, Mr. Churchill.

1235
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:33,555
My cigar... my cigar went out.

1236
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:35,909
This is the end of the world.

1237
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:40,200
- One more, Mr. Churchill.
- You're all looking fabulous.
- Simply splendid.

1238
01:56:41,852 --> 01:56:44,200
4,000 years of history
are looking upon you.

1239
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,300
Oh Lawrence, shut up.

1240
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,057
Napoleon said that before you.

1241
01:56:48,058 --> 01:56:51,000
Yes, all together now.
Excellent!

1242
01:57:16,335 --> 01:57:18,350
Our losses at Gallipoli are staggering

1243
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:23,700
and the Australian expedition force
has lost 30,000 men in one single day.

1244
01:57:24,118 --> 01:57:25,865
General, this is classified.

1245
01:57:25,866 --> 01:57:30,100
I don't care. By tomorrow,
the whole world will shout it
from its window.

1246
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:32,557
Doughty-Wylie ,
who led the assault,

1247
01:57:32,558 --> 01:57:34,900
has already been awarded
the ah, Victoria Cross.

1248
01:57:35,822 --> 01:57:37,551
Did you say Richard?

1249
01:57:37,586 --> 01:57:39,475
Richard Doughty-Wylie?

1250
01:57:39,890 --> 01:57:41,673
Royal Welsh Fusiliers.

1251
01:57:41,674 --> 01:57:44,650
But the Victoria Cross is only
for fallen heroes.

1252
01:57:44,966 --> 01:57:46,300
Correct.

1253
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:49,900
We're told he was
seeking death in combat.

1254
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,400
I think he was having problems
with his wife.

1255
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:00,500
Yes.

1256
01:58:30,317 --> 01:58:33,500
Excuse me. Thank you.
Thank you.

1257
01:58:51,696 --> 01:58:56,600
Fattuh. What would I do without you?

1258
01:58:58,460 --> 01:59:01,812
I shall follow the lady
to the end of the world.

1259
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:19,000
Dear diary,

1260
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:22,700
in the afflictions of my heart,
I am turning to you.

1261
01:59:23,849 --> 01:59:25,800
It is as if my life is ended,

1262
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:28,300
as if love was not meant for me,

1263
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:33,100
and only the great task
I have shouldered keeps me going.

1264
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:38,600
Cairo has became
one of the centres of the world again,

1265
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:41,800
and I'm starting a new life,

1266
01:59:42,745 --> 01:59:44,500
the life of a politician.

1267
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,100
Gertrude,

1268
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:53,002
Prince Faisal has requested
a meeting with you.

1269
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:55,641
He seems to be everywhere.

1270
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:59,600
And how does the third son of Sharif Hussein
deal with his brothers?

1271
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:03,600
His brothers are only interested
in horse racing.

1272
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:13,600
Gertrude,
we have to play their game.

1273
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:17,884
Faisal is shrewd,
he's cunning, he's ruthless.

1274
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:21,700
But he seems to be the right one
for this time in history.

1275
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:25,500
- I mean, let's be sincere...
- It's dangerous to be sincere,

1276
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,630
unless you're also stupid.

1277
02:00:31,085 --> 02:00:34,479
England needs to get out its colonies
sooner rather than later.

1278
02:00:39,570 --> 02:00:43,101
I tremble for my country
when I reflect that God is just.

1279
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:22,500
My brother Faisal and I, have read
your memorandum on the Arab war.

1280
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,300
Congratulations.

1281
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:26,500
You do express our feelings.

1282
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:30,300
No one in the Western world knows
the heart of the Bedouin better than you.

1283
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:32,897
The Bedouins call you...

1284
02:01:32,932 --> 02:01:34,900
"the noble lady".

1285
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:39,637
I am honoured.

1286
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:43,000
And we agree with those who call you
"the mother of the faithful",

1287
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:46,507
a title given to the wife of the Prophet,
peace upon him.

1288
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:49,704
In the face of two direct descendants
of the Prophet

1289
02:01:49,739 --> 02:01:53,300
and in the face,
of the people of the desert,

1290
02:01:53,870 --> 02:01:56,300
I am not worthy of that honour.

1291
02:02:00,149 --> 02:02:04,900
Your falcons,
your falcons are worthy of kings.

1292
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,900
You will soon be kings.

1293
02:02:12,910 --> 02:02:14,400
Over whom?

1294
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,053
Over the people I love.

1295
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:27,000
What makes an English woman,
love us so much?

1296
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:36,890
I have a trusted man, from Homs.

1297
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,100
He is, ah...

1298
02:02:41,390 --> 02:02:43,694
Well, he has saved my life,

1299
02:02:43,729 --> 02:02:46,200
many, many times in the desert,

1300
02:02:47,084 --> 02:02:49,522
he has an old mother,
and when she speaks to him

1301
02:02:49,622 --> 02:02:51,688
- she has five sons - she says...

1302
02:02:52,563 --> 02:02:53,827
Fattuh...

1303
02:02:54,630 --> 02:02:57,700
Fattuh, whom I entrust to bury me.

1304
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:01,000
And then she speaks of the weather,

1305
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:02,920
she speaks of the garden,

1306
02:03:04,548 --> 02:03:07,400
and for that alone, for him,

1307
02:03:09,456 --> 02:03:11,700
you will always have my heart.

1308
02:03:14,715 --> 02:03:18,313
And now, with your permission,
I will leave.

1309
02:03:20,610 --> 02:03:22,000
Go in peace.

1310
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,400
How could she know
that we will be kings?

1311
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:43,300
She is the maker of kings.

1312
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:47,725
She is the uncrowned Queen Of The Desert.
