It can be genetic,
environmental factors.

One of the reasons
I fell in love with him.

94
00:03:58,136 --> 00:03:59,568

No.

106
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:20,589
You have been so uptight

since you found out that
Brooks is coming to town.

108
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:24,060
I don't think that's true.

109

- Could that be a factor in all this?
- Let's be fair.

You're not a therapist, right?
With all respect.

116
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:38,673
- No, but I am a doctor.
- Sure.

117
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,610
And I believe in treating

about your brother

00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,483
We're right next to the room
where I masturbated.

122
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:50,754
I think he has it in his head
that Brooks is cooler

123
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:53,956
and more successful
and hotter than he is.

124
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,158
I never said "hotter."

125
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,658
He's charming.

126
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,261
That's interesting.
And is he single?

128
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:01,898
I don't know
if I mentioned it,

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,932

00:05:05,302 --> 00:05:07,136
Uh, Keith.

00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,238

wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?

Just checking the mail.

00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,218
Oh, yeah?

150
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,285
Some people check it
earlier in the day,

151
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:58,588
but there's always a risk

152
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,891
that the mail carrier
hasn't come yet.

153
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:06,564
This spares me the chance of
a futile trip to the mailbox.

154
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:09,764
Uh-huh.

155
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:13,838
Plus, it allows Bastian here
the opportunity to urinate.

156
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:16,605
You have a good one.

157
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:18,107
Any plans for this evening?

158
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:20,042
MAX: No.

159
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,509
Perhaps a game night?

160
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:22,677
We're just gonna stay in,

161
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,314
- just the two of us.
- Mmm-hmm.

162
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:26,182
- Boring.
- Mmm.

163
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:28,617
I see.

164
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:32,891
I do hope you keep me in mind
for any future game nights.

165
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,089
You bet.

166
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:38,627
I've always enjoyed the
camaraderie of good friends

167

competing in games
of chance and skill.

168
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:44,968
Yeah. Yeah, well,
we'll do that,

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,338
but tonight it's just
the two of us.

Three for one?

174
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:05,687
Yup.

175
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:07,792
How can that be profitable
for Frito-Lay?

176

00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,476
No, no, no.
Just gonna be us three.

347
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,879
I can see 'em in the doorway.

348
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,846
There's a whole mess
of people. Hey, guys!

349
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:06,716
- MAX: <i>There they are.</i>
- RYAN: Hey!

350
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:07,883
These guys are leaving.

351
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,284
Take off, guys.

352
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:11,322
We had a little bit
of a mix-up with the...

353
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:13,923
- God damn it!
- What?

354
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,591
We didn't want him to know
we were having a game night.

355
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:19,128
He used to come, and we don't
like him anymore, so...

356
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,729
Oh.

357
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:22,230
You know,
I think he knows now.

358
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:23,566
He sure does.

359
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:26,969
Maxi Pad,
come on, bring it in.

360
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,505
(LAUGHS) I haven't
seen you in a year!

361
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:33,542
Hey, you smell good.

362
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:34,876
What is that?

363
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,745
Is that Selsun Blue?
Head and Shoulders?

364
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,313
Why do you assume
it's a dandruff shampoo?

365
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,716
Well, I mean,
you've always been

366
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,017
a little bit of a snowstorm.

367
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,051
Hey, would you
hold that for a second?

368
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,686
- Yup.
- Hey, guys!

369
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,389
- You look good, stranger.
- Wanna drink?

370
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:47,756
It's been forever.

371
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,325
I know, and that's my fault.
I'm so sorry.

372
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,926
Sweet ride, Brooks.

373
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:52,961
Oh, you like that? I just
got her a couple weeks ago.

374
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:54,263
What is that? A Corvette?

375
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:57,466
It's a 1976 rally red
Stingray coupe.

376
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:58,868
It was my dream car as a kid.

377
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,769
And that's what gave me
the idea to get it.

378
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:02,873
You know what?
I love your house.

379
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,940
Are you being sarcastic?

380
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,140
No, I mean, I love your house.

381
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:07,976
It reminds me
of Mom and Dad's.

382
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,979
Makes me think
of simpler times.

383
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,013
Simpler?

384
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,014
So how long
are you in town for?

385
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,082
You know, I'm not sure.

386
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,884
It depends on how many clients

387
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:17,786
the firm's gonna be having me
schmooze while I'm here.

388
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:18,921
(BOTH LAUGHING)

389
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,121
<i>But hopefully for a while.</i>

390
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,426
I don't get to see you guys,
and I...

391
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:27,062
God, I really miss you, man.
I really do.

392
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:28,929
- Oh.
- (BROOKS SIGHS)

393
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,365
Miss you, too, Brooks.

394
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,835
RYAN: And go!

395
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:34,570
Shock-rocker.
Dated Rose McGowan.

396
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,205
Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.

397
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:37,272
Yep. You got it.

398
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:38,975
- Quick story.
- There's no pausing.

399
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:40,275
You remember
the urban myth where

400
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:42,110
Marilyn Manson
had the ribs taken out,

401
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:43,678
so he could go down
on himself?

402
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,113
ALL: Yeah.

403
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:46,115
You don't mind me telling
the story, do you, Max?

404
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:47,548
You're in the middle of a...

405
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,652
You were 14 years old.
It's an adorable story.

406
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:50,851
I forbid it.

407
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:53,322
I'm a little curious.

408
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:55,191
Did you blow yourself?

409
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:57,158
You know the bungee cords
on roof racks?

410
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,828
- Yeah.
- Max took one of those bungee cords

411
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,895
and he put it around his neck.

412
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:02,130
Here he goes.

413
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:03,631
And then he wrapped it
behind his legs,

414
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,833
so he could squish his face
down into his crotch.

415

- (ALL GASP)
- <i>But the problem was</i>

416
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:10,239
that it got stuck!
He couldn't unhook it.

- (ALL LAUGHING)
- And about an hour later,

Mom comes home,
and she finds him there.

KEVIN: <i>Shit!</i>

00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:18,815
Her little pretzel boy

- Little pretzel boy?

422
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:23,519
Great story.
Are we back on now?

423
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:25,053
So?

424
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:25,922
So what?

425
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,322
Did you suck it?

426
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:28,956
- (ALL LAUGHING)
- Let's go. Come on. Brooks.

427
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,192
Back to it. Come on.
Play the game.

428
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:33,229
Poor man's Johnny Depp,
starred in <i>Jericho.</i>

Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

This guy. He hated kids
in <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

Sam Neill.

00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:45,039

Oh, this is easy!

447
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,364
Annie, the famous actor
that we met

448
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,068
at the airport
about eight years ago.

449
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,034
Who?

450
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,471
Only actor we've ever met
at an airport who's famous.

451
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:16,437
Bobby Flay?

452
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:17,639
Not an actor.

453
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,475
This fellow was in front of us
at the Sbarro.

454
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,876
We were wondering why he wasn't
in the first-class lounge.

455
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:24,013
Oh, yes, yes.

456
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,313
Who was that?

457
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:26,715
God damn it!

458
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:27,850
Max, there's a whole room of
people to help you out here.

459
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,018
- Use us.
- Good point.

460
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,287
He was the Incredible Hulk.

461
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:32,455
BOTH: Eric Bana.

462
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,190
- Other one.
- MICHELLE: <i>Uh, Mark Ruffalo.</i>

463
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,024
- Other one.
- KEVIN: <i>Lou Ferrigno.</i>

464
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:38,094
Holy shit! <i>Primal Fear.</i>

465
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,894
Richard Gere never played
the Incredible Hulk.

- Motherfucking Ed Norton!

- Ooh. Really?

how long

481
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,355
I'm gonna be here,
I rented a place.

482
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:08,957
It's only a couple miles away.

483
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,491
You know,
it's up on Broadmoor.

484
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:11,861
Ooh! Swanky neighborhood.

485
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:14,997
It's a very cool house.
But it's just me there alone.

486
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:17,065
It'd be great
to have you guys come over.

487
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,534
Oh, well,
it's kind of a tradition

488
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:20,869
to have game nights here.

489
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,238
But you know what?

490
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,205
Let's let him show off
his big house, huh?

491
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,840
BROOKS: That's the spirit!

492
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:28,210
Trust me,

493
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:32,580
this will be a game night
to remember.

- Mmm.

- Promise?
- Good night, everybody.

Well, I mean, come on.

00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,763
We don't see him
in over a year.

503
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,467
He shows up
in your dream car,

504
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:52,634
insults our house,

505
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,435
and then tells an embarrassing
story about you,

506
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:56,805
right before your turn just
to throw you off your game.

507
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,173
Welcome to my whole life.

508
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,607
Why are you suddenly
so worked up about it?

509
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:01,410
Well, 'cause now he's messing
with your balls

510
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:03,878
and literally killing
millions of our babies.

511
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,448
Well,
that's a little dramatic,

512
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,415
but, yeah, you know.
I mean, that's Brooks.

513
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,652
I thought that this was just
regular old brother stuff,

514
00:18:09,654 --> 00:18:11,319
- but I totally see it now.
- Mmm-mmm.

515
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,521
He undermines you
every chance he gets.

516
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:14,522
Yeah. Yeah.

517
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,525
- It's crazy!
- Thank you, Annie.

518
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,693
I've never won
a single game against him.

519
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:22,666
I just... I think we gotta
fix this Brooks thing.

520
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,166
- Fix it?
- Yeah.

521
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,268
What are you suggesting?

522
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,569
I'm suggesting
we beat his ass.

523
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,440
Jesus Christ.

524
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,541
Good evening.

525
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,646
- We're gonna skip the cleanup?
- (CHUCKLES)

526
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:42,917
Sure you don't wanna
take a Lyft?

527
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,685
No, no. I am not getting
drunk tonight.

528
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:46,020
- GARY: Good evening!
- I'm gonna stay alert and ready.

529
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:48,123
- Jesus, Gary!
- (ANNIE GASPS)

530
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,357
Where are you headed?

531
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,794
We are going to, uh,
to my brother's.

532
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,963
Another game night?

533
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:57,633
No. No, absolutely not.

534
00:18:57,635 --> 00:19:00,035
We're going to, um,

535
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:02,538
- have some dinner.
- Eat.

536
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,138
I see.

537
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,040
Pity. I was going
to invite you over

538
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,778
for a dinner I'm hosting.

539
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,512
I've purchased
four lamb shanks

540
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,647
that I've been simmering
in a broth

541
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:16,751
of red wine and rosemary.

542
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:19,821
- That sounds so yummy, though.
- Damn it.

543
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:23,357
It was actually
Debbie's recipe.

544
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,095
I like to think she left
behind her recipe cards

545
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:28,963
as a gesture of goodwill,

546
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:34,171
but it was most likely
an unintentional oversight.

547
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,114
Well, here we go.

548
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,582
GARY: What?

549
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:48,051
I'm sorry?

550
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,919
I thought you said something.

551
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:53,355
- No.
- Nope, not us.

552
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:54,358
Okay.

553
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:59,062
- (CAR ENGINE STARTS)
- Have fun.

554
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:04,866
MAX: Oh, fuck me.

555
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:06,634
A guy who rents a house
this big

556
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,202
must be making up
for something

557
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:09,838
pretty small, I'd say.

558
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,574
No, no. No, I've seen his dick.
It's pretty great.

559
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,412
Well, I tried.

560
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:17,278
- Hey!
- MAX: Hey!

561
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,880
- ANNIE: Hey!
- How are you doing, beautiful?

562
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,883
- Good, good. Really fancy.
- Very nice house, Tony Stark.

563
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,786
Should we give our drink
orders to JARVIS? (CHUCKLES)

564
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,353
No, I got the Tony Stark part,

565
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:26,688
but then you went
full nerd on me.

566
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,257
I kinda lost you,
but please do come in.

567
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:29,590
- All right.
- Thanks, Cap.

568
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:31,292
- Hi, guys!
- ALL: <i>What's up?</i>

569
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:35,029
Boy, could sleep four
on that couch. Look at that.

570
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:36,733
Oh, hello, friends.

571
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,535
Hey, let me introduce you
to my date. This is Sarah.

572
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:42,604
Sarah is head of company
accounting at our office.

573
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:44,138
Well,
corporate communications.

574
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,574
And she's also British,

575
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,142
which means
she's smart as shit.

576
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:48,977
- I'm Irish.
- Okay? Same island.

577
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,412
Well, it's really not.

578
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:51,311
- Nice to meet you. Hi.
- Nice to meet you, too.

579
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:52,547
- I'm Max.
- Annie.

580
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:53,816
So, you can't
always judge a book

581
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,584
by its past covers, can you?

582
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,618
- ANNIE: Mmm.
- Almost a saying.

583
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,953
- Here you go.
- Hey, Brooks.

584
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:00,221
- Cheers.
- We didn't know

585
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:01,522
if you had any games,
so we thought

586
00:21:01,524 --> 00:21:03,192
we'd bring you
a few of our favorites.

587
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,893
Hey, look at that.

588
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,627
- (CLATTERS)
- ALL: Whoa!

589
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:08,196
- MAX: Huh.
- <i>The poor games.</i>

590
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,397
I told you
we're taking it up a notch.

591
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,402
The game that we're gonna
play tonight is so epic

592
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:15,804
that we don't need a board,
and we do not need pieces.

593
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:17,772
Still didn't need
to throw them across the room.

594
00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:19,107
I was being theatrical.

595
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:21,076
Holy shit!
Are we doing a fight club?

596
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:22,711
A what?

597
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,046
It's when rich people pay poor
people to fight each other...

598
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:25,180
Hey, hey, hey!
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

599
00:21:25,182 --> 00:21:26,182
Stop with
the fight club, okay.

600
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,115
- It's nonsense.
- No.

601
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:29,683
Ryan believes
everything he reads.

602
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:30,751
Thank you.

603
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:33,190
So, what are we playing?

604
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,926
In the next hour,

605
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:40,828
someone in this room
is going to be taken,

606
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,497
and it's gonna be up to you
to find them

607
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:44,132
before they are murdered.

608
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:46,167
Oh! It's a murder
mystery party.

609
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:47,702
BROOKS: <i>Not just
any murder mystery.</i>

610
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:49,871
I found this company.
They do it super real.

611
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:51,373
They use legit actors.

612
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,143
You're not gonna know
what's real and what's fake.

613
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,010
- Fun!
- BROOKS: <i>But that's not all.</i>

614
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:58,145
Because whoever
finds the victim

615
00:21:58,147 --> 00:22:00,617
wins the grand prize.

616
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,118
The keys to the Stingray.

617
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,953
- What?
- Wow.

618
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:08,256
Just the keys?

619
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:09,958
No, Ryan, the whole car.

620
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,993
Oh, yes! Oh, man!

621
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,694
You're so lucky I brought you
to this game night

622
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:16,263
- and not one of Max and Annie's.
- Hey!

623
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:17,932
No, I just mean
'cause this is better.

624
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:19,300
Oh.

625
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:20,602
You're not gonna actually
give away your car?

626
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,737
Oh, it's just a tax write-off.

627
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:25,574
And the Audi,
it's more practical.

628
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:27,174
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

629
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:29,076
Okay. How do we start?

630
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:31,279
We just wait for it to begin.

631
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:33,749
Maybe play a drinking game
to pass the time?

632
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:36,151
This group does not play
drinking games.

633
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:38,621
Tonight we do, Max.

634
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,521
- Oh. "Never Have I Ever."
- RYAN: <i>Good one!</i>

635
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,156
(QUIETLY) Can you believe
this guy?

636
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:44,226
(QUIETLY) Yeah,
he's ridiculous.

637
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:45,859
Beautiful house, though.

638
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:47,564
Good champagne.

639
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:53,404
Here we go.

640
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:57,271
Yup. We're at the house.

641
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,443
We'll let you know
when we have him.

642
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:05,449

644
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:19,426
What's with that knife?

645
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:21,229
It's for the cheese.

646
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:23,733
Okay, all right.
Just, you know,

647
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,167
really aggressive way
to carry a knife.

648
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:27,836
Oh no, I've got one.

649
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:31,506
Never have I ever
connected my work computer

650
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,840
to the projector
in the conference room

651
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:35,442
when it was open
on a WebMD page

652
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:36,744

653
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:39,013
- RYAN: <i>That's not cool!</i>
- SARAH: <i>Drink!</i>

654
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:41,115
Just for the record,
I did not have chlamydia.

655
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:42,351
It was pubic dermatitis.

656
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:44,086
You get it from
not washing your crotch.

657
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:45,421
- Okay.
- MAX: <i>Good for you.</i>

658
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,789
I... I like her.

659
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,092
Listen, you're not supposed to
single people out in this game.

660
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:52,294
It's supposed to be
generic things, like,

661
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,162
"Never have I ever slept
with a celebrity."

662
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,263
Oh, I didn't know. Okay.

663
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:57,432

664
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:58,733

- Ooh.

666
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:02,637
What?

667
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,605
You slept with a celebrity?

668
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:06,874
No, I was taking a drink
separate from the game.

669
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,644
- That was bad timing.
- MAX: <i>Mmm.</i>

think, but it's not.</i>

are you breathing

the elliptical?

Whose turn is it?

675

Uh, it's Max.
Max, it's your turn. Huh?

676
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:22,324
I'm not playing a drinking
game. Who was it?

677
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,892
What's the deal with that?

together since middle school.

- Oh. Oh!
- Yeah!

681
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:29,265
How could you possibly have
had sex with a celebrity

682
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,932
when we've only had sex
with each other?

683
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:33,268
Please, can you not make this
one of your things right now?

684
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,903
How is this one of my things?

685
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:38,173
Yeah, Brooks, this is why
we don't play drinking games.

00:49:39,006 --> 00:49:40,439
- Okay.
- Okay.

1368
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:42,075
- We're gonna push past it.
- No problem. No problem.

1369
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:43,377
- We'll get the bullet out.
- Let's just google.

1370
00:49:43,379 --> 00:49:45,011
Honey, can you return
the text later?

1371
00:49:45,013 --> 00:49:45,879
This is instructions
on how to remove a bullet.

1372
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:47,046
Oh, sorry.

1373
00:49:47,048 --> 00:49:48,381
It's an alt-right
militia website,

1374
00:49:48,383 --> 00:49:50,283
so I'm just gonna ignore
the racist stuff.

1375
00:49:50,285 --> 00:49:51,618
- Good. Good, good.
- Yeah?

1376
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,520
Okay. "Step one,
sterile gloves."

1377
00:49:53,522 --> 00:49:54,788
Check!

1378
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,089
We're doing
the best we can, right?

1379
00:49:56,091 --> 00:49:57,857
Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.

1380
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:59,225
"Step two."

1381
00:49:59,227 --> 00:50:02,263
Um... Okay.
"Disinfect wound."

1382
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,564
Right, yeah.
That's gonna sting, isn't it?

1383
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:05,765
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.

1384
00:50:05,767 --> 00:50:07,332
- Let's do it.
- Okay?

- (TOY SQUEAKING)

1386
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:11,571
That smarts, huh?

1387
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:13,173
- Yeah.
- (WHIMPERS)

1388
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:15,508
Gonna administer anesthetic.

1389
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,442
We don't have that.

1390
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:18,044
Just gonna skip that one.
Okay.

1391
00:50:18,046 --> 00:50:19,345
"Step four, apply pressure
above the wound."

1392
00:50:19,347 --> 00:50:21,381
Here, you squeeze that there.

1393
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:22,982
- I got it.
- Great. Thank you.

1394
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:25,285
We're just gonna make
two tiny incisions...

1395
00:50:25,287 --> 00:50:26,218
Oh, my God.

1396
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,421
On either side
of the wound.

1397
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:29,423
Easy-peasy.

1398
00:50:29,425 --> 00:50:30,656
This is fun, huh?

1399
00:50:30,658 --> 00:50:32,424
- Are you having fun?
- No.

1400
00:50:32,426 --> 00:50:33,926
- Let's get the bullet.
- Okay. Here we go.

1401
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:35,229
Let's get in there and get it.

1402
00:50:35,231 --> 00:50:36,863
Nice and small,
nice and small, baby.

1403
00:50:36,865 --> 00:50:38,564
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Tiny, teeny.

00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:44,738
That's not small.
That's really big!

1406
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,272
So big?

1407
00:50:46,274 --> 00:50:47,941
Way too big, baby. It's
a bullet, not a grapefruit.

1408
00:50:47,943 --> 00:50:50,176
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. This is
my first time. I don't know...

1409
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:51,879
Oh, there's so much blood.

- I'm sorry.
- Stop it.

1415
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:02,288
I'm looking at you
and you're making me...

1416
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,689
Well, don't look at me.
I won't look at it.

1417
00:51:03,691 --> 00:51:05,691
- Push through. Let's go.
- Okay. All right, okay.

1418
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:07,227
- No more cutting.
- Oh, shit.

1419
00:51:07,229 --> 00:51:08,160
Just get the tweezers
and get the bullet out, baby.

1420
00:51:08,162 --> 00:51:09,162
Shit, shit, shit. Um...

1421
00:51:09,164 --> 00:51:10,229
What? What happened?

1422
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:11,497
Phone went to sleep.

1423
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:13,100
You gotta set it
so that thing stays on.

1424
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:14,368
- No. My phone doesn't do that.
- Sure it does.

1425
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,169
Same phone as mine.
Just change it.

1426
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:17,638
Just gonna touch it with my nose
every 30 seconds. It's fine.

1427
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,872
Don't be afraid of your phone.

1428
00:51:18,874 --> 00:51:20,140
Get in there,
go to the settings,

1429
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:21,408
go to display
and change the timing

1430
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,442
so that it doesn't revert
to sleep mode.

1431
00:51:22,444 --> 00:51:23,743
- Revert?
- Yeah.

1432
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:25,278
What are you, Steve Jobs?
I'm not reverting anything.

1433
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,212
I'm just not afraid
of my phone, honey.

1434
00:51:26,214 --> 00:51:27,546
It's so fucking simple.

1435
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:29,415
Shh! Quiet.
I know what I'm doing, okay?

1436
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:30,649
Do you?

1437
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:31,817
Yes.

1438
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:33,819
- Here she goes.
- Here we go.

1439

You're like a dolphin.

1440
00:51:35,122 --> 00:51:37,156
All right.
This part's gonna hurt.

1441
00:51:37,158 --> 00:51:38,625
I don't... I don't doubt it.

1442
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:39,825
Okay, let's do this.

1443
00:51:39,827 --> 00:51:41,294
- (EXHALES)
- Okay.

What's that sound?
What's that sound?

1449
00:51:48,504 --> 00:51:49,535
Is that the bullet?

1450
00:51:49,537 --> 00:51:52,171
- (GASPS) That's bone!
- What?

1451
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:53,906
That's not right.

1452
00:51:53,908 --> 00:51:57,877
Okay. What do the racists say
if you can't find the bullet?

1453
00:51:57,879 --> 00:51:59,379
Yeah, that's bone.
You got the bone.

1454
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:01,515
I'm looking at my bone.
Look right here.

1455

did you get shot twice?

1457
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:09,522
That's the exit wound.

1458
00:52:09,524 --> 00:52:11,091
Oh, it came out!

1459
00:52:11,093 --> 00:52:12,892
Yup. Nothing to remove.

1460
00:52:12,894 --> 00:52:14,227
The bullet has exited the arm.

1461
00:52:14,229 --> 00:52:16,029
Well, let's just sew
that sucker up, huh?

1462
00:52:16,031 --> 00:52:17,332
Yeah.

1463
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:21,301
No, no. Honey, don't,
don't look at...

1464

- (GAGS)
- Stop it.

ANNIE: <i>I'm sorry.</i>

1467
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:27,807
Now, the Bulgarian's guys
have Brooks,

1468
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:29,276
and the only way
to save him

1469
00:52:29,278 --> 00:52:30,977
is to get that egg from this
Marlon Freeman guy.

1470
00:52:30,979 --> 00:52:33,747
I can't believe your brother's
been lying to us this whole time.

1471
00:52:33,749 --> 00:52:35,381
He's even cooler
than we thought.

1472
00:52:35,383 --> 00:52:37,785
Honey, I think you sewed
my arm to my sleeve.

1473
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,187
I didn't even know Morgan
Freeman collected Faberge eggs.

1474
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,089
Aren't those worth
millions of dollars?

1475
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:43,924
It's Marlon Freeman,
but that's just an alias.

1476
00:52:43,926 --> 00:52:46,258
Somehow, we gotta find out his
real name, find out his address.

1477
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,394
- Police computer.
- MAX: What do you mean?

1478
00:52:48,396 --> 00:52:50,662
I once dated this girl
whose father was a cop.

1479
00:52:50,664 --> 00:52:52,566
She showed me
her dad's police computer.

1480
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:55,468
It has a database with
every known alias on it.

1481
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,171
I bet we could find Marlon
Wayans' real name on it.

1482
00:52:58,173 --> 00:52:59,540
So, if we called her up,

1483
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:01,006
would she let you go
on her dad's computer?

1484
00:53:01,008 --> 00:53:03,542
No. No way! That ended badly.

1485
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:05,345
So, how are we gonna get into
a police computer

1486
00:53:05,347 --> 00:53:06,546
without the cops knowing?

1487
00:53:06,548 --> 00:53:07,781
- Billy Bob Thornton!
- MICHELLE: What?

1488
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:09,149
- What?
- You slept with

1489
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:11,384
- Billy Bob, didn't you?
- Hang on, hang on!

1490
00:53:11,386 --> 00:53:13,722
I know where we can
get on a police computer.

1491
00:53:15,356 --> 00:53:18,091
- Hey!
- Gary!

1492
00:53:18,093 --> 00:53:20,026
Goodness.

1493
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:22,194
To what do Bastian and I
owe the pleasure?

1494
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:23,729
Well, we were
all just talking,

1495
00:53:23,731 --> 00:53:26,566
and we realized we haven't had
a game night in ages.

1496
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:29,269
- Just the seven of us.
- So...

1497
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:31,238
I thought you were going
to your brother's house.

1498
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,705
I never said that.

1499
00:53:32,707 --> 00:53:34,674
Come on, Gare Bear. Live
a little! It's the weekend!

1500
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:36,743
We were just saying how you
were always better at games

1501
00:53:36,745 --> 00:53:38,111
than Debbie was.

1502
00:53:38,113 --> 00:53:40,747
I'll thank you
not to besmirch my ex-wife.

1503
00:53:40,749 --> 00:53:42,216
That woman is an angel.

1504
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:46,754
Oh. Yeah, she was much better
at games than you.

1505
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:53,162
I will admit I have eagerly
awaited a visit such as this.

1506
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,933
Where'd he go?

1507
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:02,701
Do we follow him?

1508
00:54:02,703 --> 00:54:03,736
MAX: It seems like it.

1509
00:54:03,738 --> 00:54:05,640
- Ryan, you go first.
- I'm scared.

1510
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:14,948
Help yourself to popped corn
with sea salt.

1511
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,383
Oh! Oh!

(GROANS) <i>Yummy, yummy.</i>

1513
00:54:19,553 --> 00:54:21,220
I can't believe
that you read my mind.

1514
00:54:21,222 --> 00:54:22,522
I was craving popcorn.

1515
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:24,957
You have a framed photo
of game night?

1516
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:26,325
Doesn't everyone
have photographs

1517
00:54:26,327 --> 00:54:28,563
of their best friends
in their homes?

1518
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:33,133
ANNIE: <i>Of course. We do.</i>

1519
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:35,000
Max, you wanna go first?

1520
00:54:35,002 --> 00:54:37,069
Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.

1521
00:54:37,071 --> 00:54:38,537
Oh. There's a loose one.

1522
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:41,207
Always in the middle.
That's where you wanna go.

1523
00:54:41,209 --> 00:54:42,741
Can I use your john
real quick?

1524
00:54:42,743 --> 00:54:45,213
Of course. It's the end
of the hall, next to our...

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

1526
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:50,419
My bedroom.

1527
00:54:51,854 --> 00:54:52,855
Okay.

1528
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:16,845
Oh, no, Gary.

1529
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:48,875
So, Sarah, how long
have you two been a couple?

1530
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:51,544
Oh, no! No, we're not.
We just...

1531
00:55:51,546 --> 00:55:53,513
We work together.
I wouldn't, um...

1532
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:54,580
I wouldn't do that thing.

1533
00:55:54,582 --> 00:55:57,383
I see. I thought I detected

play <i>Pac-Man</i> at Fisker Lanes

we ate the pellets.

No matter how long you and I
stayed alive in the game,

up to the leader board.

if we have a baby,

we'll be officially
settling down,

1763
01:07:38,685 --> 01:07:41,220
and you'll never make it
onto the leader board of life?

- Oh, my God,

1871
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:33,679
- Stop it.
- Okay, fine.

1872
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:35,447
It's two minutes to 12:00.
Where the hell is this bridge?

1873
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:36,948
GPS says
it's right around here,

1874
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,550
but I don't see it.

1875
01:12:38,552 --> 01:12:40,484
Oh, oh. Oh.
There it is. 4th Street.

1876

1881
01:12:56,669 --> 01:12:58,804
Hold on.

1882
01:12:58,806 --> 01:13:01,740
I'm not an expert, but these
gems look plastic to me.

1883
01:13:01,742 --> 01:13:04,309
"Made in China."
Is this thing not even real?

1884
01:13:04,311 --> 01:13:06,144
Maybe just that sticker
was made in China.

1885
01:13:06,146 --> 01:13:07,379
- Let's let them talk.
- MAX: Can I see?

1886
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:08,648
KEVIN: <i>Hey,
why would The Bulgarian</i>

1887
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,549
<i>ask Brooks to bring him
a fake egg?</i>

1888
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:13,518
Uh, I don't think
he wanted an egg at all.

1889
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,723
I think he wanted
what was inside the egg.

1890
01:13:17,525 --> 01:13:19,858
"WITSEC."
What is that?

1891
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,093
Um...

1892
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:23,231
We could ask them?

1893
01:13:39,879 --> 01:13:41,913
KIDNAPPER: You tell anyone
we were coming here?

1894
01:13:41,915 --> 01:13:43,415
MAX: No.

1895
01:13:43,417 --> 01:13:44,616
I've got your egg.

1896
01:13:44,618 --> 01:13:47,251
- You do?
- Yeah, but we broke it.

1897
01:13:47,253 --> 01:13:48,720
- What?
- Well, it was a fake.

1898
01:13:48,722 --> 01:13:50,589
But we have the list of names
that was inside.

1899
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,293
That's what you wanted, right?

1900
01:13:55,395 --> 01:13:57,661
Okay. Get on the ground.

1901
01:13:57,663 --> 01:13:59,831
We've got what you want.
Can't you just let us go?

1902
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:02,535
I said, "On the ground!"

1903
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:04,303
You too, playboy, get over
there. Get on the ground.

1907
01:14:10,476 --> 01:14:12,077
Why did you come here?

1908
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:13,745
Because you're my brother,
and I can't just let you die,

1909
01:14:13,747 --> 01:14:17,349
even though
you might deserve it.

1910
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:19,952
You're unbelievable,
you know that?

1911
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:22,420
You've always been
a better person than me.

1912
01:14:22,422 --> 01:14:24,322
You gotta shut up. Okay?

1913
01:14:24,324 --> 01:14:27,225
Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.

1914
01:14:27,227 --> 01:14:30,027
I'm not the carefree dude that
wins at everything he touches.

1915
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:31,130
You know how I win?

1916
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:32,630
I cheat.
I cheat at everything.

1917
01:14:32,632 --> 01:14:34,868
I even cheated when we were
kids playing <i>Battleship.</i>

1918
01:14:36,637 --> 01:14:37,768
What?

1919
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:39,904
Didn't you ever wonder
why I made you sit

1920
01:14:39,906 --> 01:14:41,238
with your back to the TV?

1921
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,309
It was so I could see
your ships in the reflection.

1922
01:14:44,311 --> 01:14:47,846
I mean, I even took five grand
every time we played <i>Monopoly</i>

1923
01:14:47,848 --> 01:14:49,581
before we even
started playing the game.

1924
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:53,085
I cheated at the <i>Game of Life.</i>
And at the game of life.

1925
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,553
You son of a bitch.

1926
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:57,855
- You son of a bitch!
- <i>Yo, sit down.</i>

1927
01:14:57,857 --> 01:14:59,890
- What about you, Princess?
- I don't have anything.

1928
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:03,562
But it didn't stop there,
because when we grew up, Max,

1929
01:15:03,564 --> 01:15:06,598
you went off
to college, and I...

1930
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,966
You got a career, you...

1931
01:15:08,968 --> 01:15:11,803
You married the greatest girl
in the world.

1932
01:15:11,805 --> 01:15:13,938
I knew I couldn't keep up
with that success.

1933
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,707
So I...

1934
01:15:15,709 --> 01:15:18,009
I told everyone that I got
a job on Wall Street.

1935
01:15:18,011 --> 01:15:19,577
And I did.

1936
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:22,350
Selling coke to traders.

1937
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:25,317
You didn't invest in Panera?

1938
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:26,885
I ate at Panera.

1939
01:15:26,887 --> 01:15:28,554

1941
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:31,924
But that's why I've been
trying to make it up to you.

1942
01:15:31,926 --> 01:15:33,558
That's what this whole
game night was about.

1943
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:37,630
See, I had it rigged
so that you'd finally win.

1944
01:15:37,632 --> 01:15:40,631
The last clue
was gonna lead you...

1945
01:15:40,633 --> 01:15:42,102
Your jacket pocket.

1946
01:15:52,245 --> 01:15:53,480

1947
01:15:55,449 --> 01:15:57,719
Surprise. (CHUCKLES)

1948
01:16:00,753 --> 01:16:03,221
I even managed to fuck
that up, though. I'm so sorry.

1949

- What's that?

inviting me to your game nights,

2033
01:19:11,145 --> 01:19:13,911
I hijacked Brooks'
murder mystery party

2034
01:19:13,913 --> 01:19:16,413
and I staged a kidnapping
of my own.

01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,719
as a game night participant?

2038
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:22,920
Well, what about these dudes?
Are they actors?

2039
01:19:22,922 --> 01:19:25,157
Oh, no. They're...
They're felons.

2040
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:26,291
Felons?

2041
01:19:26,293 --> 01:19:27,893
I was able to shave some
time off of their parole

2042
01:19:27,895 --> 01:19:30,661
in exchange for
this little side project.

2043
01:19:30,663 --> 01:19:32,730
- We square now?
- Thank you, gentlemen.

2044
01:19:32,732 --> 01:19:34,032
That lady hit me with the car.

2045
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:35,901
Hey, what the hell kinda
psycho are you?

2046
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:38,469
You put us through all this,
just for your own amusement?

2047
01:19:38,471 --> 01:19:42,240
No, no. Just the opposite.
For your amusement.

2048
01:19:42,242 --> 01:19:43,175
Did everyone have fun?

2049
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:44,975
- ALL: No! No.
- RYAN: Yeah. No.

2050
01:19:44,977 --> 01:19:47,880
- No fun! I got shot!
- By me!

2051
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:49,413
I don't see
how that's possible.

2052
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:50,749
My men were using blanks.

2053
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:52,751
Well, that was my gun.
It was a real gun.

2054
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:55,152
So, this whole thing,
the Faberge egg,

2055
01:19:55,154 --> 01:19:56,990
The Bulgarian.
That was you?

2056
01:19:58,592 --> 01:19:59,724
You've lost me.

2057
01:19:59,726 --> 01:20:02,094
The egg, the WITSEC list?

2058
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:04,332
It's all you.
All part of your game?

2059
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:10,167
This is a list of people in the
Federal Witness Protection program.

2060
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:12,737
- How did you get this?
- From inside the egg.

2061
01:20:12,739 --> 01:20:13,837
Stop fucking with us.
It's over!

2062
01:20:13,839 --> 01:20:15,107
I'm not fudging with you.

2063
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:16,977
I honestly have no idea
what... (GROANS)

2064
01:20:18,878 --> 01:20:22,080
Oh, boy. Yikes!

2065
01:20:22,082 --> 01:20:23,314
I mean, how stupid
do you think we are?

2066
01:20:23,316 --> 01:20:24,883
- Hey, Max...
- Gang, are we looking

2067
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:27,051
at the big twist here?
He gets shot again!

2068
01:20:27,053 --> 01:20:28,687
And by who?
A couple of new characters

2069
01:20:28,689 --> 01:20:29,987
you introduce
at the last minute.

2070
01:20:29,989 --> 01:20:31,756
Dude, you've jumped the shark!

2071
01:20:31,758 --> 01:20:33,358
Do you go to the magic shop
to buy a bunch

2072
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,395
- of these little bullets?
- No. (SCREAMS)

2073
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:38,929
Hang on.

2074
01:20:38,931 --> 01:20:40,165
This is Officer Kingsbury.

2075
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:41,700
We got a 10-00
on the 4th Street...

2076

- (GROANS)
- (ALL GASP)

2077
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:47,307
Which one of you
is Brooks Davis?

2078
01:20:50,177 --> 01:20:52,380
It's funny, you don't look
like an asshole.

2079
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:56,113
Do I look like
as asshole to you?

2080
01:20:56,115 --> 01:20:57,447
No.

2081
01:20:57,449 --> 01:20:59,250
One of us has to be the
asshole in this transaction

2082
01:20:59,252 --> 01:21:01,051
because otherwise
I'd have my egg,

2083
01:21:01,053 --> 01:21:02,621
and you'd have your money.

2084
01:21:02,623 --> 01:21:05,826
But instead, we've wasted
our night tracking you down.

2085
01:21:07,092 --> 01:21:08,792
Now we're gonna
have to kill you.

2086
01:21:08,794 --> 01:21:10,996
- What? No, no, no, no.
- What?

2087
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:12,464
Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?

2088
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:15,634
Hi, I'm Max. (STAMMERS)
I'm Brooks' brother.

2089
01:21:15,636 --> 01:21:17,768
And you know, look.
He screwed up.

2090
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,203
- Right? You got greedy.
- Oh, yeah.

2091
01:21:19,205 --> 01:21:20,404
He admits it.

2092
01:21:20,406 --> 01:21:22,674
Good news is, though,
that we got your egg.

2093
01:21:22,676 --> 01:21:24,876
It is broken.
Uh, my screw-up.

2094
01:21:24,878 --> 01:21:27,813
But, um, I got the list.

2095
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:29,413
Which I bet you've been after
this whole time.

2096
01:21:29,415 --> 01:21:30,648
What about this?

2097
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:33,285
How about

2098
01:21:33,287 --> 01:21:34,819
you take this list

2099
01:21:34,821 --> 01:21:37,354
<i>for free, and we all go
our separate ways?</i>

2100
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:38,990
Nobody gets hurt.

2101
01:21:38,992 --> 01:21:42,693
Uh, except the poor folks
on this list, I'm guessing.

2102

(CHUCKLES)

2103
01:21:44,597 --> 01:21:45,800
Okay.

2104
01:21:46,266 --> 01:21:47,432
Okay?

2105
01:21:47,434 --> 01:21:49,634
Deal. Makes perfect sense.

2106
01:21:49,636 --> 01:21:51,769
No, no. You give him
that list, he's gonna kill me.

2107
01:21:51,771 --> 01:21:53,440
(LAUGHING) That's nonsense.

is wrong with you?

of you on the jet. Take him.

Don't follow us, Max.
I'm serious!

2114
01:22:09,088 --> 01:22:11,391
I'm not worried about that.

nothing wrong.

- Don't follow us!

2122
01:22:26,806 --> 01:22:27,871
around here is at Conway.

2123
01:22:27,873 --> 01:22:29,808
Yeah. How are we
gonna get there?

2124
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:31,443
Brooks' house is not
that far from here.

2125
01:22:31,445 --> 01:22:32,747
But our car's not there.

2126
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,315
Yeah, it is.

2127
01:22:44,925 --> 01:22:46,357
You know,
you don't have to do this

2128
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:48,259
because I can just
poop it out.

through your feces.

That's disgusting!

2131
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:54,032
Now, hold still
while I cut your stomach open.

2132

No, no! No! Whoa!

- That's my brother.

- Hold on!
- Oh!

- You all right?
- Yeah, you?

- Yup, good.
- Okay.

it just might work.
