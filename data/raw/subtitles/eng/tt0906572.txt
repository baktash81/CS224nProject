00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:22,079
I hate guns. I would
never touch it.

360
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:24,604
- Did the doctor say anymore
of the short-term memory

361
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:25,779
might be recoverable?

362
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:27,781
- They don't know.

363
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:30,566
- I wouldn't remember anything.
That's when I hit my head.

364
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,829
- OK. She didn't speak
to the police?

365
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:34,222
- Not a word.

366
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:38,226
- How long had you
known Bobby Rose?

367
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:39,967
- We just met.

368
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,273
But we connected right away.

369
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:46,060
- Did you go out to
restaurants, theatre, movies?

370

- No.

371
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,760
We stayed at our apartments.

00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,415
- Did anyone ever see
you with Bobby Rose?

373

A friend, acquaintance,
stopped to say hello?

Were you ever in a bar together,
or even a newsstand?

- No.

- The prosecution
has no witness?

377

- No one on the list.

378
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:12,086
- So as far as they can prove,
you never knew Bobby Rose.

379

- No.

380
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:18,179
- No money was taken.

381
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,616
Where's the motive?

382
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:26,535
- The state will be seeking charges of first-degree murder.

383

Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your time.

384

- After hearing the
prosecution's opening statement,

385
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,418
we have a mystery.

386
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,856
Why is Roland Wyker himself

387

trying this case?

388
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:47,861
As he describes the
events of the day

389
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:51,081
it's open-and-shut,
a done deal, a slam dunk.

390
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:55,477
Even a third-year law
student could win it.

Don't be fooled.

392
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:00,787
He has no idea what
happened that day.

393
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,008
He has no witness, there is no
purpose or motive to the crime

394
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:06,314
as he'll describe it.

395
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:08,838
He's stumbling
around in the dark

light is blinding.

397
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,190
He has a theory.

398
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,411
So does the defence.

399
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,501
And if our theory is still
standing at the end of the day

400
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:21,677
it will prove beyond
a reasonable doubt

401
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:26,160
that Cassie Stewart
never harmed a soul.

402
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,513
The victim was killed
with her own gun.

403

Capital murder?
Man one, tops.

404

I'll make 'em choke on it.

Cassie, you're an actuary.

Your world is analytical.

- And?

416

- It's simple, really.

417
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:08,594
The prosecutor will argue

418
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,204
there were 3 people
in that room.

419
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,380
We have to argue there were 4.

- Precisely.

421
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:20,257
Where's the murderer?

You don't know
she's the murderer.

The jury hasn't spoken yet.

- No, Detective.
That's your theory.

I have a theory too.

and slams her head against
the edge of the door.

on her hand.

- Detective, if I put
a gun in your hand

against the trigger,

that my client killed the
victims out of jealousy

00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:40,207
or to rob them

the necklace did belong

536
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,321
to the victim Diane Summers.

537
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:50,022

Your Honor.

- What about this necklace?

539
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:02,948
- Diane gave it to me
the night before she died.

540
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:04,645
I really loved it.

541
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:07,213
Now it seems it was
a consolation prize

542
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:10,433
or an apology for taking Bobby.

543
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:12,000
Or a goodbye present.

544
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:15,351
I put it in a safety
deposit box the next morning.

- What's it worth?

546

- Not much.
The stones were paste.

547
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:21,531
- If the jury is led
to believe you stole it

548
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:23,533
they might believe worse of you.

549
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:24,926

from an old boyfriend.

you on the stand.

And I warned you,

558
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:40,463
a trial is like theatre.

559
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,335
Often cheap theatre.

Whatever happened

I thought you'd be

reason indeed.

- Oh no, I...
- Be confident, my dear.

- I didn't know
he was married.

- He doesn't advertise.

They couldn't
agree on a settlement

You know, she really

- Please.
- About the necklace.

605
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,463
Why make something so beautiful
and put it in paste?

606
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:51,812
Why not use real diamonds?

607
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:54,075
- Travel money?
- Yeah.

608
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,772
Half a million dollars.

609
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:57,948
Could that be the value
of the original stones?

610
00:33:57,992 --> 00:34:00,864
- But why put them in paste?
Why not sell it and leave town?

611
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:03,911
- The only boyfriend that
Diane never talked about.

612
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:06,305
Why? She's scared.

613
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:09,090
And maybe he's obsessed with
her. Maybe he's a gangster.

614
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,397
He buys her half a million
worth in jewelry.

615
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,789
He means to keep her.

616
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,617
If she ever makes a run for it,

617
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:17,446
she's going to need some
cash, not a fancy necklace.

618
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,362
And she puts it in paste
because she's still seeing him

619
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:23,017
and he wants to see his
diamonds around her neck.

620
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,280

Love has nothing
to do with trust

1060
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:50,914
or any other virtue.

1061
01:03:54,178 --> 01:03:57,877
It hits you like a hot
bullet through carved ice.

1062
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:01,185
Imagine at my age,

1063
01:04:01,228 --> 01:04:05,232

season of your youth,

1064
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:08,235

Not like this.

1066
01:04:11,238 --> 01:04:13,545
I make my living with words

1067
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:17,984
but there was no way to
express myself to thank her.

1068
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:23,033
So I made this.

1069
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:27,080
We were going to spend
a month in Europe

1070
01:04:27,124 --> 01:04:29,953
where a mature man and
a much younger woman

1071
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:32,259
aren't looked at judgmentally.

1072
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:37,264
A month alone with her was
all I could think about.

1073
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:43,183
Then that day I called to
confirm the reservation

1074
01:04:43,227 --> 01:04:46,491
and she had cancelled it,
cashed her ticket.

1075
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:52,410
She didn't answer her phone.
I went over to her apartment.

1076

There they were.

1077
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:57,850
I must have frightened her.

1078
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,635
She tried to get the gun
I'd given her for protection.

1079
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,376
I took it away from her.

1080
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:05,597
I told her everything could be
just as we planned it.

1081
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:08,252
But she said no.

1082

She was going away
with this boy.

1083
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,392

The whole time
she was screaming,

1085

life go out of her.

1087

Then I heard the front door
open. I knew it was you.

1088
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:40,937
I hid in the bathroom.
I tried to figure a way out.

1089
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,809
And when you came down the
hall and saw the bodies,

1090
01:05:43,852 --> 01:05:46,246
I just panicked.

1091
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,466
I came up behind you,
I knocked you out.

1092
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:55,864
That's when I got the idea

1093
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:58,955
to manipulate the
situation to save myself.

1094
01:06:11,228 --> 01:06:14,666
It wasn't until I
was back in my library

1095

she shouldn't have.

have just let them go?

- And know that those
who made a fool of me

1103

every passion

in a world made
perfect by my absence?

Do you believe
I could survive that?

1106
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:56,099
It was a slip of
the tongue, wasn't it?

1107
01:06:56,142 --> 01:07:00,277
In our conversation, I meant
to say "the necklace".

1108
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,714
And I said, "The Willow Chain".

1109
