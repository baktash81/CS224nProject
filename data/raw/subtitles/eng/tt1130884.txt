00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,219
Get it together Teddy!

3
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,239
Get it together!

4
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,439
It's just water.

5
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,439
It's a lot of water

6
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,639
Come on.

7
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:54,959
- You okay boss?
-Yeah, i'm just...i just can't

8
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,559
I just can not stand on water.

9
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,639
- You're my new partner?
- that's right.

10
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,639
Not the best way to know you
half head in the toilet.

11
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,559
Doesn't exactly square with
Teddy Daniels: the man of legend, i'll give you that

12
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,839
the Legend?

13
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,039
What the hell are you boys smoking
out there in Portland anyway?

14
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,719
Seatle.

15
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,719
I came from the office in Seatle.

16
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,239
How long have you been with Marshals?

17
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,839
Four years.

18
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,439
So you know how small it is

19
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,039
What about you? got a girl? Married?

20
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,359
I was.

21
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,159
she died.

22
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,639
- Jesus ...Boss, i didn't...
- don't worry .

23
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,839
There was a fire in our apartment
building, while i was out

24
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,639
Four People died.

25
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,239
It was the smoke that got her
not the fire

26
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,239
- That's important.
- I'm sorry.

27
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:08,439
Where are my goddamn Cigars?

28
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,799
i have. have one of mine

29
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:13,959
I could swear that I have the clothes
when I boarded.

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,439
Government employees, rob you blind

31
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,159
thanks

32
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,639
Have you received any briefing
about the institution befor you left?

33
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,159
All I know is it's a mental hospital

34
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,439
For the criminally insane.

35
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,359
Well, if it was just folks hearing voices

36
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,239
and chasing butterflies, i guess
they wouldn,t need us

37
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,239
- that's where we're headed?
- Yap.

38
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,839
The other side of the island is rock bluffs

39
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,239
all to ended in water

40
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,439
The dock, it's the
only way on, or off

41
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,439
we will casting off again as soon as
you two are ashore

42
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,239
i'd appreciate if you two hurry about it

43
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,639
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

44
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:32,239
I've never seen a marshal
badge before.

45
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,039
i'm Deputy warden
McPherson, gentlemen.

46
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,439
Welcome to Shutter Island.
I'll be taking you up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,839
Your boys seem a little on edge
Mr McPherson

48
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,439
Right now, Marshal. We all are

49
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:17,039
"Remember us for we too have
lived, loved and laughed"

50
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,519
Electrified perimeter.

51
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,639
How you know?

52
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,639
I've seen something like it before.

53
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,839
All right. you gentelman will be accorded
all the help we can offer.

54
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,439
But during the stay you will
obey protocol, do you understand?

55
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,839
Absolutely.

56
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,439
The red brick bulding on my right
is ward A, the male ward

57
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,159
Ward B the female ward, is one
on the left

58
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,239
Ward C is that building on the bluffs

59
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,639
The most dangerous patients
are there

60
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,839
Admittance to ward C is forbidden without
the written consent and

61
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,239
physical presence of both myself and Dr.Cawly

62
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,039
Is that understood?

63
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,839
You act like insanity is catching

64
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,119
You are hereby required to surrending
your firearms

65
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,439
Mr McPherson, We are duly apointed
federal marshals

66
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,839
we are required to carry our
firearms at all times

67
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,839
Executive order 319 of the Fedral Code of
Penitentiaries states that

68
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,919
when stays at Penitentiaries

69
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,039
the office head of institutions
has the final authority.

70
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,439
Gentlemen, you will not be allowed
to pass through the gate with your firearms

71
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,159
ok, well that does for the official stuff,
come on boys

72
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,159
What do you say we go find Dr.Cawley?

73
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,759
So when did she escaped? the prisoner?

74
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,639
I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation

75
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,839
Protocol.

76
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,039
Correctional officers at a mental institution

77
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,328
that's a weired sight,
if you don't mind me saying

78
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:08,320
It's the only pursuit of it's kind in the U.S

79
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:10,959
Even in the world. We care
only the most periculo and patients.

80
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,559
Most of the other hospitals can not deal.
And all because of Dr. Cawley.

81
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,959
It created something really unique here.
Hospital, people who deal ...

82
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,839
Id's, gentlemen.

83
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,039
Badges, gentlemen.

84
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,359
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times

85
00:08:56,439 --> 00:09:00,484
- By Scotland Yard, MI 5, OSS ...
- Why?

86
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:02,639
What do you mean?

87
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,719
Why the intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about?

88
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,439
i guess you'll have to ask him

89
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,039
-  Marshall Daniels.
- I am Ted.

90
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,839
marshall Aule.

91
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,839
- Thanl you deputy warden, that will be all
- Yes, sir.

92
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,159
pleasure, gentlemen.

93
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,039
He sure had a lot to say about you

94
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,039
McPherson is a good man.
he believe in the work they do here.

95
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,439
And what would that be exactly?

96
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,639
a moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care

97
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,039
Pardon me Dr...
a waht between what and what?

98
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,719
These paintings are quite accurate.

99
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,119
It used to be that kind of patients we
deal with here

100
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,639
shackled and left in their own filth

101
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,199
they were beaten
as they put bloody

102
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:07,039
drove screws into their brain, and submerged them into icy water to lose their consciousness

103
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,159
Or even drown.

104
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,399
- And now?
- we treat them.

105
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,239
Trying to heal, to cure.

106
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,839
And if this fails, we at least provide them
with a measure of calm in their lives.

107
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,839
these are ...

108
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,039
all violent offenders, right?

109
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,959
they've hurt people.

110
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,239
- murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases. Yes.

111
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:32,639
then personally Doctor, I'd have to
say... screw their sense of calm.

112
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,239
It's my job to treat my patients not theire victims. I'm not here to judge.

113
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,039
- So this female prisoner ...
- Patient.

114
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,039
Excuse me, patient.
one Solando Rachel,

115
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,159
- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.
- Last night.

116
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,159
Between 10 and midnight

117
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:53,639
- Is she considered dangerous?
- You could say that.

118
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,839
She killed all three of her children.

119
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,639
She drowned them in the lake behind the house.

120
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,559
She took them out one by one and held their
head in water until drowned.

121
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:06,439
Thenshe brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table

122
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,559
and ate a meal
before a neighbor dropped by.

123
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,159
What about her husband?

124
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,959
He died. On the beaches of Normandy.
she is a poor widow.

125
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,239
She starved herself when first she came here
she insist the children weren't dead

126
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,039
- Sorry Dr wouldn't happen to have some aspirin?
-  Prone to headaches marshal

127
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,519
Sometimes, but today ...

128
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,839
- more prone to seasickness.
-Ah, Dehydration ...

129
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,799
- You allright boss?
- Yes.

130
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,239
In that case you're quite right
Simpler the better.

131
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,239
thank you so much

132
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,039
Rachel still believe
her children are alived.

133
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,839
Also thought that this is her home
of Berckshires.

134
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,199
you are kidding.

135
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:59,239
in four years acknowldge
that she is in an institution

136
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,559
She believe we're all ...

137
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,639
deliveryman Milkman, postal workers.

138
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,439
to sustain the Illusion that her children never died
she created an elaborate fictional structure

139
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:10,239
she gives us all parts to play in that fiction

140
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,839
- so you searched the ground yet?
- the warden and his man scoured the island,

141
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,239
not a trace.

142
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,719
What's more disturbing, is that we don't know
how she got out of her room.

143
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:23,839
it was locked from the outside

144
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,239
and the only window is barred.

145
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,359
it's as if she evaporated straight
through the walls.

146
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,959
Brought her right back here after
group therapy, locked her in

147
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,839
I came back for midnight rounde
and she was gone

148
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,839
Seriously doctor, how is it possible
the truth never gets through her?

149
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,239
Ie, in an institution
mental illness, right?

150
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,839
seems like something you'de
notice from time to time

151
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,039
- How many pairs of shoes get patientsi?
- Two pairs.

152
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,559
Sanity is not a choice, marshal,

153
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,639
You can't just choode to get over it

154
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:11,039
So ... she left here barefoot?

155
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,039
Come on Doc, she can't get ten
yard in this terrain.

156
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:16,968
Marshall?

157
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,238
. The law of 4.
Who's 67?.

158
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,358
That's definitely Rachel's
Handwriting

159
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:41,838
I have no idea what the " law of 4" is, though
- Not a psychiatric term?

160
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:43,038
I'm afraid not.

161
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,438
Who's 67?

162
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:46,718
Fuck if I know!

163
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:49,718
I'de have to say that's quite
close to my clinical conclusion

164
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,238
So you think it's just
random scribblings?

165
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:55,958
No, not at all. Rachel is smart .
Brilliant in fact.

166
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:58,838
- This paper that could be important.
- Excuse me Doctor, but ...

167
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,438
- We need to hold onto this.
- of course

168
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:05,318
The departure had to come through here.

169
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,718
After lights out, the orderlies play
card in here

170
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:15,038
Last night there were 7 man sitting
at the base of the atairs playing stud poker

171
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:18,238
And yet somehow, Rachel has managed
to slip by.

172
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,318
Why?

173
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:22,318
How? She turns invisible?

174
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:26,438
Doctor, we need access to personal files
of all medical staff

175
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,238
of nurses, guards, orderlies

176
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:31,518
- Everyone who worked here.
- we take your request under consideration.

177
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:34,358
This is not a request, Doctor.

178
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:37,038
This is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner ...

179
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:39,238
- Patient.
- Patient ...

180
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:43,438
- has escaped now. You can comply ...
- All I can say is that I will see what I can do.

181
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:47,518
Doctor, we'll need to speak with the staff,
do you understand?

182
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,238
I'll assemble them in the
common room after dinner.

183
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,518
If you have any further questions
feel free to join the dwputy warden in the search

184
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:11,158
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freesing

185
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,838
The current was strong last night.
the tide pushing in

186
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:17,558
She's have drowned or been crushed on
the rocks, her body would have washed back onshore.

187
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:24,438
Those caves down ther,
have you checked them?

188
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,958
no way she could get there.

189
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,518
The base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy, live oak, sumac

190
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,038
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick.

191
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,438
You said it yourself marshall,
she's got no shoes

192
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:45,838
All right, boys!
Let's check the other side!

193
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,518
- What's that tower?
- An old lighthouse.

194
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:56,438
the quards already searching inside it.

195
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:02,638
- What's in there? more patients?
- sewage treatment facility.

196
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:05,118
It will be dark soon.

197
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:06,838
I'm calling this off for the night

198
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:08,638
Let's go, boys!

199
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,918
- You were watching the land, right?
- Yes.

200
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,238
Can't no one get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing

201
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:20,838
All right, Rachel Solando,

202
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,038
who else does she had to pass
to get down here?

203
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,238
Me.

204
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:32,718
Glen Miga.

205
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:37,438
- Sir, I saw nothing.
- And you were at your post all night?

206
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:39,638
Yes. But I saw nothing.

207
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:42,718
Glen.

208
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:45,838
Glen.

209
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:49,838
Tell me the truth.

210
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:56,358
I'm really ... went to the bathroom.

211
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:01,438
- What? You breached protocols? Christ ...
- I was away only one minutes.

212
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:04,958
All right, I do not know what to expect here.
Let's back up.

213
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:07,958
Mrs. Solando was put in her room for lights out.

214
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:10,558
Does anybody knows what did she do
before taht?

215
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,638
Anyone?

216
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,318
come on, anyone. anyone anyone

217
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,438
she was in a group therapy session

218
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:22,438
Did anything unusual occur?

219
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:24,638
Defines "unusual".

220
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,718
- Excuse me!
- It's a mental institution, marshall,

221
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,238
for criminally insane.

222
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:32,038
"Usual", isn't a big part of our day.

223
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,638
I will rephrase.

224
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:39,238
Did anything happened last night
during and group therapy, that was more...

225
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:42,718
- let's Say, more memorable than ...
- Normal?

226
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:43,958
Exactly!

227
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:46,238
No. I'm sorry.

228
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,638
Did Mrs. Solando said anything
during group therapy?

229
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:52,438
She was worried about the rain.

230
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,238
And she hates the food here.

231
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:58,838
Complained constantly.
Last night including

232
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:03,038
So ... you were there
in the presence of a doctor?

233
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:06,238
Dr. Sheehan led discuses.

234
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:08,638
Dr. Sheehan?

235
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,318
Yes. He was running the session.

236
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,638
He's Rachels's "primary"

237
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:17,238
The psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care.

238
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:21,718
We'll need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

239
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,238
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

240
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,638
He left on the ferry in this morning
His vacation was already planned.

241
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,438
He'd putting it off too long

242
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:31,158
You're in a state of lockdown.

243
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:34,318
A dangerous patient has escaped

244
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,038
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

245
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,438
Of course, he's a doctor

246
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,038
Do you have the phone number for
where he's gone?

247
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:50,838
Hello? Hello?

248
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:53,718
Hello?

249
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,758
Is anyone there?

250
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,758
I'm sorry sir, but it all down.
All the lines.

251
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,238
The storm's hitting the
mainland as a hammer.

252
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:04,558
If you get it working come find me immediately.
the marshalls need to make an important call

253
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,238
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,078
I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards,

255
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,958
But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9

256
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,638
If you like to drop by

257
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:22,438
Good, we can talk then, right?

258
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:26,038
We have been talking, marshall.

259
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,438
Gotta say, i'm thinking I went
into the wrong line of public service

260
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:48,398
It is a little overwhelming.
it was constructed during the civil war

261
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,358
The same time as the military fort
houses, ward C

262
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:02,118
This building is the original commander's quarters
It cost a fortune when uncle sam got the bill

263
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:04,438
the commander was courtmartialed

264
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,038
I can see why

265
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,838
Nice music. who's that? Brahms?

266
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:10,958
No.

267
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,438
It's Mahler.

268
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,238
Quite right, marshall.

269
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,718
Forgive me, gentlemen ...
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

270
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:37,638
Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor.

271
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,438
-Your poison, gentlemen?
- Rye, if you've got it.

272
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,638
Soda and ice please, thanks

273
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,358
You don't indulge in alcohol?

274
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,238
I am surprised.

275
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:54,838
Isn't it common for men in your
profession to imbibe?

276
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,038
common enough.
and yours?

277
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:03,038
- I'm sorry?
- your profession, doctor psychiatry ...

278
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:06,558
I've always heared it's overrun
with booceys and drunks

279
00:21:07,238 --> 00:21:08,838
Not that i've noticed.

280
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:12,438
what's it? Cold tea in your glass?

281
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:14,958
Excellent marshall.

282
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:18,038
You have outstanding defense mechanism.

283
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,958
You must be quite adapt at interrogation.

284
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,438
Men like you ... are my specialty.

285
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,638
Men of violence.

286
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:38,438
That's a hell of assumption to make...

287
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:42,838
No assumption. Not at all. you misunderstand me,
i said you are men of violence

288
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:47,638
I'm not accusing you of being violent man
It's quite different

289
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:50,238
Please, please, edify us, Doc.

290
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,438
You both served overseas

291
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,638
Not much of a stretch, Doc. for all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there

292
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,638
No, you were not.

293
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:21,238
Since the schoolyard, I would bet neither
of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict

294
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:26,718
Not to suggest you enjoy it
but because retreat wasn't something you considered an option

295
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:29,158
Wasn't raised to run doc

296
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:32,838
Ah, yes... Raised

297
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:36,438
and who raised you, marshall?

298
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:37,638
Me?

299
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:40,638
Wolves.

300
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,838
Very impressive defense mechanism.

301
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,238
Do you believe in God, marshall?

302
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,558
I'm quite serious

303
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,238
That's rubbish.

304
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:01,438
Have you ever seen ... a death camp, Doctor?

305
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,038
I have, I was there, for the liberation of Daqhau

306
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:14,638
Your English is very good, almost clawless

307
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:19,558
Your English is very good.
You hit the consonants a tad hard, though

308
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,438
You're German?

309
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:27,638
-Is legal immigration a crime, marshall?
- Oh I don't know doctor, you to tell us.

310
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:35,238
Listen, we need the files of Sheehan
and on the rest of staff as well

311
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:38,038
No such file will be released for you.
Period.

312
00:24:38,358 --> 00:24:41,438
- We gonna need those files.
- out of the question.

313
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:44,038
bullshit, there is no question.
bullshit.

314
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,038
Anyway, who is in charge here? huh?

315
00:24:46,838 --> 00:24:50,518
Dr Naehring is the liaison to
our board of overseas.

316
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:52,638
He relayed your request and it's been refused.

317
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:55,838
Refused? They don't have the authority to refuse. And neither you, sir.

318
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,438
marshall, continues your investigation
and we will do all we can to help.

319
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:00,958
This investigation is over.

320
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:03,238
we will file our reports
and handle it over ...

321
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:06,138
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys, that's right.

322
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,338
We'll take the ferry back in the morning.

323
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:09,738
Come on, Chuck

324
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:19,938
Nice night.

325
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:27,538
You're bunking in the orderlies quarter.

326
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:42,658
Hey boss? ... we really gonna pack it in?

327
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:45,018
Why?

328
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:48,858
I guess, i dunno, i just...
never quit anything before.

329
00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:52,937
We haven't heared the truth once yet Chuck

330
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:58,617
Rachel Solando did not slipped out of
a locked room barefoot without any help.

331
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:01,457
I'm beginning to think alot of help

332
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:04,097
Maybe Cawley sitting up in his mansion
right now,

333
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:06,537
rethinking his whole attitudes

334
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:10,057
- Maybe in the morning...
- You're bluffing?

335
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:13,137
I didn't said that.

336
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:33,137
I found a whole stock of these, Teddy.

337
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,337
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

338
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:39,737
I killed alot of people in the war.

339
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,337
Is that why you drink?

340
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,017
Are you real?

341
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:49,537
No.

342
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:55,137
She's still here.

343
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:56,937
Who?

344
00:26:58,137 --> 00:26:59,617
Rachel?

345
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:02,537
she never left.

346
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:18,457
Remember when we stayed at the cabin
by the lake ?

347
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,737
we were so happy

348
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:25,137
She's here.

349
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:27,137
You can't leave

350
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:41,137
I'm not gonna leave.

351
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,657
I love you so much.

352
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:51,737
- I am the bones in a box, Teddy.
- No.

353
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:54,937
I am

354
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,617
You have to wake up.

355
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:02,937
I won't go.

356
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,537
You're here.

357
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:08,537
I'm not.

358
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:11,457
You have to face that.

359
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:14,937
But she is

360
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:18,537
and so is he

361
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:21,937
Who?

362
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:25,657
Laeddis.

363
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:31,337
I have to go.

364
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:36,737
No! please... don't

365
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,217
-Just a little longer.
- Oh, Teddy ...

366
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:41,657
Let me go.

367
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:44,337
I can not.

368
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,937
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit

369
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:22,537
Doctor.

370
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,137
Doctor, Doctor.

371
00:29:25,217 --> 00:29:28,017
we need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy that night

372
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:29,937
I thought your investigation was finished?

373
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:32,137
It's not like we can take the ferry

374
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,937
and was Rachel recieving any
other treatment for her illnesses?

375
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:40,457
Do you know what the state of
mental health field in these days, gentelmen?

376
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:42,737
No. We are not doctors.

377
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:44,137
War.

378
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,737
The old schools believes in
surgical interventions

379
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:51,137
Psychosurgery.
The procedures are that the orbital lobotomy.

380
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:57,457
Some say that patientsi are reasonable,
Other essential say become zombies.

381
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:00,137
- And the new school?
- Psycho pharmacology.

382
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:02,337
A new drug has just been approved
of autorities.

383
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:04,057
That relaxes psychotic patients

384
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,497
some would say tames then

385
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,617
- And which school are you in, Doc?
- I?

386
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:11,337
I have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect

387
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,737
and listen to him

388
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:15,657
Trying to understand.
you just might reach him.

389
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:23,897
- These pacients?
- My point is.

390
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:26,457
What should be the last resort,
becomes the first response.

391
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,937
Give them a pill and put them in a corner,
and it all goes away.

392
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:32,617
Rachel Solando was a on a combination of drugs

393
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:36,337
meant to keep her from becoming violent
and it was only intermittently effective

394
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:41,137
The greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done

395
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:43,137
"was."

396
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:48,537
Is there a reason why you refer to
your patint in the past tense,Doctor?

397
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:52,637
Look outside, marshall.

398
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,357
Why do you think?

399
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:04,837
Next one is Peter Breen. Assaulted
his father's nurse with a brocken glass.

400
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:07,757
Nurse survived, but
her face permaanently disfigured

401
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:09,837
i can't wait.

402
00:31:09,957 --> 00:31:12,637
She smiles at me.
She was so sweet

403
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,237
But ... I could read in his eyes.
she liked to be naked.

404
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,437
Liked to suck cock

405
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:22,037
All right, Mr Breen.

406
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:25,517
And asked me if she can have
a glass of water

407
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:28,837
Alone in the kitchen?
like that's no big deal?

408
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:32,837
- Why was that a big deal?
-  It was obvious.

409
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:37,357
She wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it

410
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:40,357
Mr Breen,

411
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:44,157
we need to ask you some questions, okay?

412
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:48,237
When I cut her she screamed

413
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:51,637
But ...

414
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:53,837
She scared me.

415
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,437
What did she expect?

416
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:57,757
Interesting.

417
00:31:58,437 --> 00:32:01,757
But we are here to talk
Rachel Solando, OK?

418
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,037
Rachel Solando ...

419
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:06,037
Did you know she had drown her own kids?

420
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:08,037
She drowned her kids

421
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:11,317
This is a sick fucking world
we live in. i'll tell you that ...

422
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:12,837
They should be gassed

423
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:16,397
all of them... the retards, killers

424
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:19,837
the niggers, kill your own kids?
gas the bitch

425
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:24,837
Please.. stop that?

426
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,517
- A nurse?
- Please. Stop that.

427
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:30,837
a nurse maybe. maybe she had kids.

428
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:34,037
A husband ...

429
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:38,357
trying to make ends meet,

430
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:41,637
to have a normal life ...

431
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:44,837
assisting your father................

432
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:48,037
You tore her face off, didn't you

433
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:53,037
Congratulations, no more normal
for her, not ever again

434
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:57,837
Do you know what she was afraid of?

435
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:01,197
You.

436
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:03,557
Could you stop that, please?

437
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,837
Stop that!

438
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:09,197
Please ... stops!

439
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,837
- You know a patient by the name Andrew Laeddis?
- No! No!

440
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:15,837
I want to go back.

441
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,437
I'll never get out of here.

442
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:36,237
I'm not sure I should

443
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:39,237
Excuse me for saying it,

444
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,037
- Miss Kearns ...
- God.

445
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:42,957
Mrs. Kearns.

446
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:45,637
But you seem  ...

447
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:47,717
quite normal, ...

448
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:50,237
I mean in comparison
with the other patients here

449
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:54,157
Well, I have my dark days
I suppose everyone does

450
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:58,357
Differents is that most people don't kill
their husbands with an axe

451
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:03,637
Although personally I think if a
man beats you and fuck

452
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:07,557
half the women he sees
and no one will help you

453
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:11,837
axing him isn't the least understandable
thing you can do

454
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:15,037
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

455
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,237
And what would i do if I did?

456
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:22,037
I don't know the world anymore.
They say there are

457
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:24,717
bombs that can turn whole
cities to ash

458
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,517
And what do they call "television" ...

459
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:30,717
voices and faces coming from a box

460
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,717
I hear enough voices already

461
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:36,437
What can you tell us about rachel?

462
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:42,437
No much, she... she keep to herself

463
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:45,637
She believes her kids were alive

464
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:51,357
She thought she was still living
in Berkshire and we were all neighbours

465
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:55,037
- milkman, postman
- deliveryman,

466
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:58,117
Dr Sheehan was there that night?

467
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:00,037
Yes.

468
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,117
He talked about anger.

469
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:05,637
Tell me about him ...

470
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:08,317
What's he like?

471
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:11,437
I think e. ..

472
00:35:13,957 --> 00:35:16,437
Ok... nice

473
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:19,037
Not hard on the eyes
just my mother would say

474
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,437
Did he ever come passing you?

475
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:25,437
No.

476
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:29,037
No, Dr. Sheehan is a good doctor, he wouldn't ...

477
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:34,437
Could I have a glass of water, please?

478
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:36,157
No problem.

479
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:51,637
Thank you, marshall.

480
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:58,757
I have just one more question
Mrs. Kearns.

481
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:05,117
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

482
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:09,637
No.

483
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:13,037
Never heard of him.

484
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:20,037
She was coached

485
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:23,237
He used the same words as
Cawley's and the nurse.

486
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:26,357
- It's like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who is Andrew Laeddis?

487
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:33,157
You asked every one of those patients
about him. Who's he?

488
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:41,437
What the hell, boss, I'm your partner
for the God's sake!

489
00:36:41,837 --> 00:36:43,237
We just met, Chuck.

490
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,997
There are the job long.

491
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,037
You got a duty, a career
and what i'm doing

492
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:51,837
not exactly by the book.

493
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:57,837
I don't give a damn about the book, boss
But I need to know what the hell is going on

494
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,037
When this case came over the wires,

495
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:09,717
- I requested it. Specifically, do you understand?
- Why?

496
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:14,037
Andrew Laeddis,

497
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:18,957
was the maintenance man in thr apartment
building where my wife and I lived

498
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:21,637
Okay.

499
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:25,237
He was also a firebug.

500
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:29,517
Andrew Laeddis lit the match,

501
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:35,437
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

502
00:37:43,517 --> 00:37:44,957
Open the!

503
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,157
What happened with Laeddis?

504
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:52,757
got away.
Laeddis got away and disappeared.

505
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:55,957
About a year ago I opened the
newspaper and there he is.

506
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:57,637
He's an ugly son of a bitch.

507
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,637
He had a new scar in the right temple
down to his left lip.

508
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:03,957
Eyes different colors.
not a type of face you forget.

509
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:06,957
He'd burned a schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.

510
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,837
He said voices told him to do that.

511
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:11,437
First he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here.

512
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,556
- Then what?
- Then, nothing.

513
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:17,036
He vanished like he never existed
no records forever

514
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:19,956
I'm sure he's not in ward B
that leaves ward C.

515
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:21,116
Or he could be dead.

516
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:25,636
So could Rachel Solando.
Lots of places to hide a body here

517
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:29,436
only one place where
no one really knows

518
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:44,636
the patient , Bridget Kearne,
when she sent me for water,

519
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:47,036
she said something back to you, didn't she?

520
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:48,636
No.

521
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:52,036
Come on boss!

522
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:56,836
She wrote it.

523
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:02,636
. Run ..

524
00:39:11,636 --> 00:39:12,716
Boss!

525
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:16,836
We must get inside. It's turning
into fucking Kansas out here...

526
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,836
All right. Now.
Let's go!

527
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:22,836
watch out!

528
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:26,236
Jesus!

529
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,236
Come on! Let's go back!

530
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:48,436
Jesus Christ!
damn it!

531
00:39:59,756 --> 00:40:02,636
- Are you okay boss?
- Yes. that's all right.

532
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:10,636
So ... you think Laeddis is here ...

533
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,836
What are you going to do boss?

534
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:17,836
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.

535
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:28,436
If it were my wife
I'd kill him twice.

536
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:43,636
When we got through the gates of Dachau,
the SS guards surrendered.

537
00:40:51,636 --> 00:40:55,036
The commander tried to kill himself
before we got there ...

538
00:40:58,236 --> 00:40:59,956
but he botched it

539
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:02,836
took him an hour to die

540
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:11,236
When I went outside,
I saw bodies on the ground.

541
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:17,156
too many to count

542
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,516
too many to imagine.

543
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:48,356
so yeah

544
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:54,036
The guards surrendered, we took,
their guns, lined them up ...

545
00:42:36,956 --> 00:42:38,636
I wasn't warfair,

546
00:42:40,836 --> 00:42:42,156
it was murder.

547
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,436
I'm tired of killing.

548
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,636
That's not why I'm here

549
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:55,156
So what is it all about?

550
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,516
After Laeddis vanished,

551
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:03,636
I started doing some checking
on Ashecliffe.

552
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:09,036
lot of people knew about this place, but no
one wants to talk ...

553
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:11,636
like they're scared of something

554
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:16,236
you know this place is funded by
special grants

555
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:19,836
from the house of
American activities Committee .

556
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:25,036
Great. And how exactly are we fighting
the countries from an island in Boston Harbor?

557
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,956
by conducting experiments on the mind

558
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:31,236
at least that's my guess

559
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:33,356
And you think thats going on in here?

560
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:35,596
As I said, nobody's talking, right?

561
00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:38,236
Until I found someone
who used to be a patient here.

562
00:43:38,356 --> 00:43:40,036
Guy's name George Noyce.

563
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:42,636
nice college kid.
Socialist.

564
00:43:42,716 --> 00:43:45,836
He got an offer to get some money for some psych study. Guess what they were testing.

565
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:49,356
- drug tests.
- He started seeing dragons everywhere.

566
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:53,116
Almost beat his proffesor to death
End up appearing in Ashecliffe.

567
00:43:53,236 --> 00:43:54,836
Ward C.

568
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:58,396
They released him after 1 year, right?
What does he do?

569
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:03,236
Two weeks on a mainland
he walks into a bar and stabs three men to death

570
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:06,316
His lawyer pleads insanity,
but Noyce ...

571
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:08,316
stands up in the courtroom and

572
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:10,556
he begs the judge,
for the electric chair,

573
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:12,836
anywhere but not a
mental hospital.

574
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:15,836
Judge give him life in the Dedham prison.

575
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:19,036
- And you have you found him?
- Yes, I've found him.

576
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,236
he's a mess

577
00:44:23,156 --> 00:44:25,516
But it is pretty clear from what he tells me,

578
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:29,156
they're experimenting on people here.

579
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:31,156
I do not know, boss.

580
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:35,156
- I don not believe a crazy
- That's the beauty of it.

581
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:39,436
crazy people are a perfect subject.
they talk, but nobody listened.

582
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:41,636
I stood in Dachau.

583
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:45,836
we saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

584
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:49,076
for Christ sake we fought a goddamn war

585
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,436
to stop them,
and now find out it may be happening here?

586
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:53,636
On our land?
No.

587
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:57,036
What are you really here to do, Teddy?

588
00:44:58,116 --> 00:45:00,036
I'm here to get the proof.

589
00:45:00,556 --> 00:45:03,836
I'm gonna go back and blow
the lid off this place.

590
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:05,836
That's it

591
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:07,956
wait a minute.

592
00:45:09,036 --> 00:45:11,036
You started asking around about Ashecliffe.

593
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:13,956
waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a US marshall?

594
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:19,436
I got lucky. a patient escaped ,
it was the perfect excuse.

595
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:21,556
No, no, no boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

596
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:26,836
The world doesn't work that way.
They got electric fence around a septic facility.

597
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:29,956
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

598
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:34,356
A chief of staff with ties to the SS
Funding from HUAC?

599
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:38,236
Jesus Christ! Everything in this place
stinks  "government ops"

600
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,356
-  What If they wanted you here?
- bullshit.

601
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,156
- Ask questions.
- Nonsense.

602
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:46,436
bullshit? Where is Rachel Soalndo?
Where is one shred of evidence that she even existed?

603
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:49,676
I had to know where
that will give me any. In any case.............

604
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:52,036
While you were looking at that neighbourhood,
they're looking at you

605
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:55,156
All they need to do
is making a fake escape to get you here

606
00:45:55,156 --> 00:45:57,836
And now they have you.
they have us both,here, now.

607
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,436
Marshall, are you here?.

608
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:06,036
.Please signal us, this is deputy warden McPherson.

609
00:46:06,956 --> 00:46:08,036
marshall!.

610
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:10,036
How about that? They found us.

611
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:12,436
It's an island, boss. They'll always find us.

612
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:15,436
. I know you are in there ...

613
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:18,956
We get out of this fucking island.
You and me.

614
00:46:19,556 --> 00:46:20,636
Come on!

615
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:26,236
- Come on!
- Go!

616
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:38,436
get dry off
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!

617
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:42,436
And hurry up, this thing is transforming
to a goddamn hurricane!

618
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:49,036
I dopped those suits to be cleaned.

619
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:51,236
It should be ready by tomorrow.

620
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,716
If we don't all wash away first

621
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:58,236
speaking of which, I'm afraid your smoke were
pretty much done for

622
00:46:59,036 --> 00:46:59,956
So ...

623
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:03,836
It's our only choice, right?

624
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:06,956
that's something really nice in prison already
that ...................

625
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:09,556
Now that you mention it, it is just fine.

626
00:47:10,636 --> 00:47:13,636
that's why i must repeat my insistence
that all ward C patients

627
00:47:13,676 --> 00:47:15,316
be placed in manual restrains,

628
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:19,036
If the facility floods, they'll drown
you know that

629
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,636
- That would take a lot of flooding.
- We are on an island,

630
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,396
in the middle of the ocean,
during a hurricane.

631
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:25,836
A lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility

632
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,436
It's a gamble, Steven.
say the power fails

633
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:29,596
there's a backup generators.

634
00:47:29,636 --> 00:47:32,436
and if htat goes? The cell doors
will open

635
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:35,436
Where are they to go?

636
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:38,956
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland over a weak havoc.

637
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:43,036
You're right. Probably responsible
recovery right here on us..

638
00:47:43,636 --> 00:47:45,716
If they're manacled to the floor, they die

639
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,356
24 human beings.

640
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,996
you can't live with that, can you?

641
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,796
frankly, if it were up to me

642
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:56,156
, i'd put all 42 in ward A and B in
manual restrains as well

643
00:47:56,236 --> 00:47:57,836
Excuse me
Excuse me

644
00:47:58,236 --> 00:48:01,556
- marshall.
- I'm sorry, I have one quick question.

645
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:02,756
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.

646
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:05,556
When we spoke this morning about Rachel Solando's note

647
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:07,236
the law of 4, I loved that.

648
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:11,156
you told me you had no idea what
that second line could refer to

649
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,236
Who's 67?

650
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:16,036
Yes, I'm afraid I still do not know.
None of us knows.

651
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,956
Nothing comes to mind.

652
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:22,436
Nothing?

653
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:28,636
Because I believed i just heard
you say that there are

654
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:31,156
24 patients in ward C.

655
00:48:31,196 --> 00:48:33,596
And 42 of patients, in wards A and B

656
00:48:33,636 --> 00:48:37,516
which would mean there are
66 patients here in this facility

657
00:48:38,036 --> 00:48:39,436
That's correct, yes.

658
00:48:42,716 --> 00:48:44,956
Then it seems that
Rachel Solando was suggesting

659
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:49,156
you have a 67th paient, doctor

660
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:53,036
- But I'm afraid we don't.
- This Is ridiculous.

661
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:56,156
- What are you doing here?
- We are doing our goddamn job.

662
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,116
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?

663
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:01,636
No, what's the good news, doctor?

664
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:04,316
Rachel has been found.

665
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:06,636
It's here.

666
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:09,156
Safe and sound

667
00:49:20,036 --> 00:49:21,836
There is not a mark on her.

668
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:27,156
Who are these men?

669
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:31,836
Why are they in my home?

670
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:34,036
Police officers, Rachel.

671
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:36,716
They ... have a few questions.

672
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:40,356
Ma'am.

673
00:49:43,956 --> 00:49:45,956
There's been a sighting of a known
Communist

674
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:50,356
subversive in this area
passing out literature

675
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,236
Here?

676
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:57,036
In this neighborhood?

677
00:49:57,116 --> 00:49:58,436
Yes, I'm afraid so.

678
00:50:00,036 --> 00:50:03,036
If you have tell us what you have done yesterday, where you were,

679
00:50:03,636 --> 00:50:05,836
it'll help us narrow  our search.

680
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:08,236
Yes ...

681
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,956
Well, I ...

682
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:16,836
I made breakfast for Jim
and the children,

683
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:20,436
and then I ...

684
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:25,236
I packed Jim's lunch
and he left.

685
00:50:28,156 --> 00:50:30,436
Then I sent the children off to school.

686
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,355
And then ...

687
00:50:42,435 --> 00:50:45,635
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.

688
00:50:52,035 --> 00:50:53,315
I see...

689
00:50:56,955 --> 00:50:58,435
And after that?

690
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:07,435
After that ...

691
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:18,035
I thought of you.

692
00:51:24,035 --> 00:51:25,035
I ... I'm sorry, ma'am.

693
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,835
I do not know what you talking about.

694
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:33,835
Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?

695
00:51:39,235 --> 00:51:40,835
You're gone ...

696
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:45,835
You're dead.

697
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:52,635
I cry every night.

698
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,555
How am I supposed to survive?

699
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:02,835
God.

700
00:52:13,155 --> 00:52:15,835
Rachel ... it will be all right.

701
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:21,035
I'm so sorry, but ...

702
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:25,355
everything will be all right? Okay?

703
00:52:27,235 --> 00:52:28,635
I buried you

704
00:52:30,635 --> 00:52:35,355
I buried an empty basket . Your body
was nothing but blood and chunke of....,

705
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:37,435
eaten by sharks.

706
00:52:40,835 --> 00:52:43,435
My jim is dead,
So who the fuck are you?

707
00:52:46,635 --> 00:52:48,235
who the fuck are you?

708
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:51,635
Who are you? Who are you?

709
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:02,635
I'm sorry about that

710
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:05,955
I didn't wanted to interrupt, I thought
she might trll you something, but ...

711
00:53:06,035 --> 00:53:08,035
we found her down by the lighthouse,

712
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:10,035
skipping stones.

713
00:53:10,835 --> 00:53:14,315
We have no idea how she get there.
i'm going to ask you both to go down into basement.

714
00:53:14,435 --> 00:53:17,555
We have food, water, and cots .
It's the safest place to be

715
00:53:18,435 --> 00:53:19,635
when the hurricane hits.

716
00:53:23,955 --> 00:53:25,155
are you all right?
You look pale.

717
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:27,715
I'm fine, it's just ...

718
00:53:29,035 --> 00:53:30,835
Boss, are you okay?

719
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:33,955
It's so goddamn bright? isn't it?

720
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:38,155
Photo sensitivity, headaches sometime?
Marshal are you having migraine?

721
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,715
Yeah, right.

722
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:50,835
Take these, marshall. You'll sleep a couple
of hours, wake up clear as bell.

723
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:53,195
You have a migraine.
Imagine someone sawed open your head and

724
00:53:53,235 --> 00:53:55,235
filled it with razors then shook it
as hard as they could

725
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,635
Take these pills, marshall.

726
00:53:56,755 --> 00:54:00,115
- No ... not want.
- It'll stop the pain. Take pills.

727
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:06,835
You'll need to lay down

728
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,515
carefull. All right.

729
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:33,635
Gonna be okay. Relax.

730
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:41,835
- Who is that?
- He?

731
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:44,235
That's the warden.

732
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:47,715
Do not worry about him, allright?

733
00:54:54,315 --> 00:54:57,435
Looks like ex-military prick.

734
00:54:57,635 --> 00:54:59,635
You know  I can not argue with you onthat.

735
00:56:21,955 --> 00:56:23,635
You should have saved me.

736
00:56:26,155 --> 00:56:28,635
You should have saved all of us.

737
00:56:57,035 --> 00:56:58,115
Hey buddy ...

738
00:57:01,315 --> 00:57:02,755
Laeddis.

739
00:57:03,235 --> 00:57:04,435
Yes.

740
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:17,235
Hi, buddy.

741
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:19,835
No hard feelings, right?

742
00:57:26,435 --> 00:57:27,835
No hard feelings.

743
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:42,835
Little something for later.

744
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:49,355
I know how much you need it.

745
00:57:54,635 --> 00:57:56,515
clock's ticking, my friend.

746
00:57:57,355 --> 00:57:59,115
Wer're running out of time.

747
00:58:08,715 --> 00:58:10,435
give me a hand here.

748
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:34,035
I could get in trouble.

749
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:02,035
I'm dead?

750
00:59:04,835 --> 00:59:06,635
I'm so sorry.

751
00:59:07,435 --> 00:59:09,835
Why did not you saved me?

752
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:14,835
I tried, I wanted to,
but by the time I got there,

753
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:16,435
it was too late.

754
00:59:37,435 --> 00:59:38,635
See?

755
00:59:41,715 --> 00:59:43,235
It's not beautiful?

756
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,355
Why are you all wet, baby?

757
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:41,635
Laeddis isn't dead.

758
01:00:43,235 --> 01:00:44,515
He isn't gone.

759
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:47,515
He's still here.

760
01:00:49,635 --> 01:00:50,835
I know.

761
01:00:51,635 --> 01:00:53,235
We need to find him, Teddy.

762
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:57,035
find him and you kill him dead.

763
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:14,235
It's okay.

764
01:01:26,235 --> 01:01:27,195
. Again!.

765
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:28,835
Generaytor is faulty

766
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:35,335
Are you okay boss ?

767
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:39,335
that goddamn Migraine !

768
01:01:39,535 --> 01:01:44,135
Back up generator failed.
whole places gone crazy.

769
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,455
What do you want to do?

770
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,335
Christ!

771
01:01:53,615 --> 01:01:56,335
No, no, no!
Put it down.

772
01:01:56,455 --> 01:01:57,735
Now! Now!

773
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:10,455
You think the whole electrical system is fried?

774
01:02:10,455 --> 01:02:12,935
I think that is a good possibility.

775
01:02:13,455 --> 01:02:15,335
All electronic security system ...

776
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:18,055
fences, gates, doors

777
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,215
Come on.

778
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:21,535
Nice day for a stroll
don't you think?

779
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,455
to ward C for example.

780
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:28,535
Maybe you'll find Andrew Leaddis

781
01:02:33,455 --> 01:02:36,135
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?

782
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,935
He told me this is where they keep
the worse ones

783
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:41,015
The guys in the other wards
are scared of

784
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,655
Noyce did not say anything about the lab?

785
01:02:45,655 --> 01:02:46,855
Not really.

786
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:50,654
All that he remember was people
scream day and night. There were no windows.

787
01:02:50,654 --> 01:02:51,934
There were bars everywhere.

788
01:03:12,534 --> 01:03:14,054
Jesus Christ!.

789
01:03:14,734 --> 01:03:17,654
first time
on ward C, right?

790
01:03:17,654 --> 01:03:19,214
- Yes, yes ...
- Yes.

791
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:23,334
- yeah heard stories, but ...
-  Trust me,sons. You haven't heard shit.

792
01:03:23,374 --> 01:03:25,734
we got most of the bugsies locked down now,

793
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:27,694
But some of them are still loose.

794
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:30,334
If you see some don't try
to restrain him yourself

795
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:31,854
These fuckers will kill you.

796
01:03:32,014 --> 01:03:33,214
Clear?

797
01:03:33,654 --> 01:03:36,934
Well get your ass moving, then
c'mon

798
01:04:31,014 --> 01:04:32,214
he's here.

799
01:04:36,014 --> 01:04:37,214
Laeddis.

800
01:04:38,214 --> 01:04:39,534
I can feel him.

801
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:45,854
Tag! You are it.

802
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:47,934
ted!.......

803
01:04:56,254 --> 01:04:57,934
Hey, hey!

804
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:01,934
Hey, hey!

805
01:05:03,254 --> 01:05:04,534
Teddy!

806
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:45,894
Listen to me!

807
01:05:45,934 --> 01:05:49,854
Listen!
I do not want to leave, all right?

808
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:54,014
Why wouldn't anyone want that?
I have heard many things here.

809
01:05:54,134 --> 01:05:56,614
About the outside world.
About atolls,

810
01:05:56,654 --> 01:05:59,134
about the hydrogen bomb tests.

811
01:05:59,254 --> 01:06:02,134
You know how
a hydrogen bomb works?

812
01:06:02,174 --> 01:06:04,614
- With ... Hydrogen?
- that's funny.

813
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:07,214
Other bombs exploding, right?

814
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:10,894
But not the hydrogen bomb
It's imploding.

815
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:15,214
An explosion that is hundredth thousand
millionth degree .

816
01:06:15,254 --> 01:06:17,014
- Do you understand?
- Yes, yes ...

817
01:06:17,054 --> 01:06:18,654
- do you?
- I get it!

818
01:06:18,654 --> 01:06:20,534
Go!

819
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:35,734
No!

820
01:06:36,334 --> 01:06:38,014
What are you doing?

821
01:06:38,334 --> 01:06:40,934
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

822
01:06:41,214 --> 01:06:43,134
you got Billings?

823
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:46,214
What's the matter with you guys?
catch them, not kill them!

824
01:06:46,254 --> 01:06:47,854
He jumped at us.

825
01:06:47,934 --> 01:06:51,254
You give me a hand with him
we've got to get him to the infirmary

826
01:06:51,254 --> 01:06:54,534
No! Not you, not you.
take a walk.

827
01:06:54,574 --> 01:06:55,534
Come on!

828
01:06:55,614 --> 01:06:58,134

01:07:56,734 --> 01:08:00,254
you're dead, we're all dead
this is hell, we're in hell

832
01:08:02,614 --> 01:08:04,054
Please ...

833
01:08:04,054 --> 01:08:05,454
...................

834
01:08:07,214 --> 01:08:08,214
stop me.

835
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:16,814
Go!

836
01:08:19,454 --> 01:08:20,934
Please, please!

837
01:08:28,134 --> 01:08:30,454
Laeddis ...

838
01:08:37,654 --> 01:08:40,934
you told me i'de be free of
this place

839
01:08:41,134 --> 01:08:42,654
You promised.

840
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:45,854
You lied.

841
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:47,454
Laeddis?

842
01:08:52,814 --> 01:08:54,334
Laeddis!?

843
01:08:55,854 --> 01:08:57,614
That's pretty damned funny.

844
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,254
Your vioce ...

845
01:09:00,534 --> 01:09:02,134
Don't you recognize it?

846
01:09:03,134 --> 01:09:05,574
After all the talks we've had?

847
01:09:05,614 --> 01:09:08,054
After all the lies
that you've tell me?

848
01:09:08,134 --> 01:09:09,934
Let me see your face.

849
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:12,454
They say i'm theirs now

850
01:09:13,214 --> 01:09:15,934
They say i'll never leave.

851
01:09:16,654 --> 01:09:19,214
Your match is about to go out.

852
01:09:21,134 --> 01:09:23,214
Let me see your goddamn face!

853
01:09:23,254 --> 01:09:24,214
Why?

854
01:09:24,214 --> 01:09:26,574
so you can lie me more?

855
01:09:26,614 --> 01:09:28,894
- This isn't about the truth!
-yes it is.

856
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:32,534
- It's about exposing
- This is about you!

857
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:34,014
And Laeddis.

858
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:38,014
That's all it's ever been about.

859
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:39,654
I was incidental.

860
01:09:40,734 --> 01:09:42,134
a way in

861
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:45,934
George?

862
01:09:46,454 --> 01:09:47,734
George Noyce?

863
01:09:48,534 --> 01:09:51,814
No, it is not possible,
You can not be here.

864
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:53,334
do you like it?

865
01:09:54,934 --> 01:09:56,854
Who did this to you, George?

866
01:09:56,854 --> 01:09:58,134
You did!

867
01:09:58,614 --> 01:09:59,894
What do you mean?

868
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,934
What are you talking
all of your fucking talk

869
01:10:01,974 --> 01:10:04,254
And I'm back here because of you!

870
01:10:04,294 --> 01:10:06,494
George, I get you out of here.

871
01:10:06,534 --> 01:10:09,734
I'll find a way to fix this

872
01:10:09,774 --> 01:10:11,094
I'll never get out now.

873
01:10:11,134 --> 01:10:13,734
I got out once, But not twice, never twice

874
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:16,934
- Tell me how sis they got you here?
-they knew!

875
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:18,334
Don't you get it?

876
01:10:18,654 --> 01:10:21,334
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

877
01:10:21,934 --> 01:10:24,214
This is a game. All of this ...

878
01:10:24,734 --> 01:10:26,014
is for you.

879
01:10:26,214 --> 01:10:28,134
You're not investigating anything.

880
01:10:28,334 --> 01:10:31,734
You're a fucking rat
in a maze.

881
01:10:32,014 --> 01:10:33,014
George ...

882
01:10:33,454 --> 01:10:35,454
you're wrong.

883
01:10:36,134 --> 01:10:37,334
Really?

884
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:41,214
Been alone much since
you got here?

885
01:10:41,334 --> 01:10:43,334
I'm with my partner.

886
01:10:43,454 --> 01:10:46,334
You have never worked
with him before, right.....?

887
01:10:47,134 --> 01:10:48,134
He's a ...

888
01:10:48,734 --> 01:10:50,894
US Marshall from Seattle.

889
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:53,854
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

890
01:10:55,134 --> 01:10:56,294
George, look ...

891
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:59,614
I know people.
I trust this man.

892
01:11:03,614 --> 01:11:06,054
Then, they've already won.

893
01:11:08,054 --> 01:11:12,654
fuck!

894
01:11:13,214 --> 01:11:15,734
they're going to  ...

895
01:11:15,774 --> 01:11:18,134
tale mr to the lighthouse.

896
01:11:18,214 --> 01:11:20,654
they're going to
cut into my brain.

897
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:25,654
And I'm only here because of you!

898
01:11:26,454 --> 01:11:29,934
George, I'm going to get you out of here.
You're not going to the lighthouse.

899
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:35,334
You can't kill Leaddis and expose
the truth at the same time

900
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,654
You have to make a choice
you understand that, don't you?

901
01:11:37,654 --> 01:11:39,134
I'm not here to kill anyone.

902
01:11:39,214 --> 01:11:42,854
- Liar!
- I won't kill him! I swear to you ...

903
01:11:43,454 --> 01:11:45,454
She's death.

904
01:11:45,854 --> 01:11:48,134
Let her go ...

905
01:11:48,454 --> 01:11:49,534
Let her go.

906
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:51,934
. Tell him Teddy ..

907
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:55,134
. Tell him ..

908
01:11:57,134 --> 01:11:59,134
You've got to do it
There's no other way.

909
01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:03,934
- Let her go.
- The time you brought me these flowers ...

910
01:12:03,974 --> 01:12:04,934
You have to do!

911
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:08,334
And I told you and you broke my heart.
And you asked me why?

912
01:12:08,374 --> 01:12:10,094
Play with your mind.

913
01:12:10,134 --> 01:12:13,214
And then i told you
it broke from happiness

914
01:12:13,334 --> 01:12:14,734
she kill you. she's going to kill you.

915
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:21,454
You want to uncover the truth?
then you have to let her go ...

916
01:12:22,054 --> 01:12:25,014
I can't.
- You have to let her go!

917
01:12:25,054 --> 01:12:26,854
I can't!
I can't.

918
01:12:32,854 --> 01:12:36,014
Then you'll never leave
this island.

919
01:12:41,214 --> 01:12:42,454
Dolores?

920
01:12:49,214 --> 01:12:51,614
He's not in this ward.

921
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:54,014
He was transferred ...

922
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:55,734
Out of here.

923
01:12:57,534 --> 01:12:59,454
If he's not in ward A

924
01:13:00,134 --> 01:13:02,934
There's only one place he can be

925
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:08,934
The lighthouse.

926
01:13:16,134 --> 01:13:17,214
Hey!

927
01:13:20,054 --> 01:13:21,334
God help you.

928
01:13:29,734 --> 01:13:32,414
Boss, we have problems.
Cawley and McPherson are in the building.

929
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:35,134
Cawley heard an orderly went batshit on a patient,

930
01:13:35,174 --> 01:13:37,854
then got sent up to the roof.
He went up to look for him

931
01:13:37,934 --> 01:13:39,214
Let's get the hell out of here.

932
01:13:39,254 --> 01:13:40,214
This way

933
01:13:42,214 --> 01:13:45,134
Just keep going.
we belong here

934
01:13:54,134 --> 01:13:57,454
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

935
01:13:58,254 --> 01:13:59,894
Where were you?

936
01:13:59,934 --> 01:14:02,094
after we got that guy to the infirmary,

937
01:14:02,134 --> 01:14:04,254
I took a little detect
to patient records.

938
01:14:04,334 --> 01:14:05,814
did you find Laeddis?

939
01:14:06,814 --> 01:14:07,814
No.

940
01:14:07,934 --> 01:14:10,814
- I didn't find him.
- I find next best thing.

941
01:14:10,934 --> 01:14:12,294
in his intake form.

942
01:14:12,334 --> 01:14:15,054
that's all that was in his file
no session note, no incident reports

943
01:14:15,054 --> 01:14:16,934
no photograph... just this.
It was weired

944
01:14:17,054 --> 01:14:18,734
here, take a look.

945
01:14:19,534 --> 01:14:20,814
I'll take a look later.

946
01:14:22,734 --> 01:14:23,854
What's the matter boss?

947
01:14:24,454 --> 01:14:26,734
I'll look at it later,
that's all.

948
01:14:29,014 --> 01:14:30,334
Ashecliffe's that way.

949
01:14:30,454 --> 01:14:32,214
I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

950
01:14:33,654 --> 01:14:35,134
I'm going to the lighthouse.

951
01:14:36,014 --> 01:14:38,654
I'm going to find out what
the fuck is hapening in thid island.

952
01:14:51,614 --> 01:14:52,734
Here it is.

953
01:14:53,334 --> 01:14:54,454
Damn!

954
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:57,254
too far north
We'll have to double back

955
01:14:57,854 --> 01:15:00,254
There's no way to cros those rocks

956
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:03,054
there could be a way behind those trees

957
01:15:03,054 --> 01:15:04,814
maybe a path that goes around the rocks
to the lighthouse

958
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:07,654
what are we doing here?
we've get the intake form

959
01:15:08,134 --> 01:15:11,534
It proofs ther's a 67th patient...
who they've said repeatedly he doesn't exist

960
01:15:13,933 --> 01:15:15,933
I'm getting to that lighthouse
do you understand?

961
01:15:18,533 --> 01:15:21,053
What can I say to you stop.

962
01:15:21,453 --> 01:15:22,453
why would you want to?

963
01:15:22,533 --> 01:15:26,933
Because climbing down there
when it's dark ......... suicide

964
01:15:26,973 --> 01:15:27,933
okay.

965
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:31,333
maybe it's better you sit this one out

966
01:15:32,853 --> 01:15:36,453
you brought me into this, boss.
And now I am trapped on this rock.

967
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:37,333
On the island.

968
01:15:37,453 --> 01:15:41,133
Without anyone we know.
And now you acting like .........

969
01:15:41,173 --> 01:15:42,133
Like what?

970
01:15:42,213 --> 01:15:43,653
How my acting?

971
01:15:47,453 --> 01:15:51,453
What the hell happened
in those cells, Ted?

972
01:15:56,333 --> 01:16:01,253
- What do you think weather is like in Portland, Chuck?
- I'm from Seattle.

973
01:16:03,133 --> 01:16:04,533
Seattle?

974
01:16:08,933 --> 01:16:11,653
I'll go alone... alone

975
01:16:13,213 --> 01:16:14,733
Come with you, partner.

976
01:16:14,773 --> 01:16:16,333
I said alone

977
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:19,653
Fine.

978
01:16:44,213 --> 01:16:45,453
Damn it!

979
01:16:46,533 --> 01:16:47,733
Damn it!

980
01:16:52,653 --> 01:16:55,613
I knew it will take long.
but I couldn't get there because tide is on

981
01:17:04,813 --> 01:17:05,933
Chuck!

982
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:09,533
Chuck!

983
01:18:09,053 --> 01:18:10,053
Come on!

984
01:18:43,653 --> 01:18:44,853
Chuck!

985
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:46,933
Where are you, chuck!

986
01:19:10,653 --> 01:19:11,933
Chuck!

987
01:19:13,533 --> 01:19:14,933
Chuck!

988
01:19:57,613 --> 01:19:58,853
Who are you?

989
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:02,613
I am Teddy Daniels.

990
01:20:02,733 --> 01:20:03,733
I'm a cop.

991
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,053
You're a marshal.

992
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,053
that's right.

993
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:12,333
would you mind mind ...

994
01:20:12,453 --> 01:20:15,133
take your hands from behind
your back?

995
01:20:15,173 --> 01:20:16,133
Why?

996
01:20:16,453 --> 01:20:17,933
Why?

997
01:20:18,533 --> 01:20:21,333
To make sure what you
have hold there does not hurt me

998
01:20:28,453 --> 01:20:29,533
I'm gonna keep this...

999
01:20:30,933 --> 01:20:32,213
If you do not mind.

1000
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:35,213
fine with me.

1001
01:20:46,733 --> 01:20:47,853
You're Rachel Solando.

1002
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:51,333
the real one.

1003
01:20:54,733 --> 01:20:56,453
did you kill your children?

1004
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,333
I never had children.

1005
01:21:01,053 --> 01:21:02,133
I was never married.

1006
01:21:04,133 --> 01:21:07,453
before I be a patient
in Ashecliff, I worked here.

1007
01:21:09,213 --> 01:21:10,533
You were a nurse?

1008
01:21:12,213 --> 01:21:13,813
I was a doctor, marshall.

1009
01:21:17,653 --> 01:21:18,813
you think i'm crazy?

1010
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,933
- No, I ...
- And if I say I'm not crazy ...

1011
01:21:22,533 --> 01:21:25,213
well that hardly helps, does it?

1012
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:29,733
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1013
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:33,933
people always tell you you're crazy

1014
01:21:34,733 --> 01:21:36,013
and protested, on the contrary,

1015
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:37,653
confirm what they say.

1016
01:21:40,733 --> 01:21:42,733
I do not following you.
I'm sorry.

1017
01:21:43,213 --> 01:21:44,333
Once you are declared insane,

1018
01:21:45,213 --> 01:21:47,853
then anything you do is called
as a part of insanity.

1019
01:21:47,853 --> 01:21:50,453
Your reasonable protests
or denial .

1020
01:21:51,533 --> 01:21:53,653
valid fears,
paranoia.

1021
01:21:53,653 --> 01:21:55,733
survival Instincts

1022
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,333
As defense mechanisms.

1023
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:00,613
You're smarter than you look marshall
that's probably not a good thing

1024
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:03,133
Tell me something ...

1025
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:04,453
Yes ...

1026
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:07,933
What happened to you?

1027
01:22:08,733 --> 01:22:11,333
I started asking about shipping this
this large amount of sodium .

1028
01:22:12,213 --> 01:22:15,133
- And the sodium-based hallucinogens.
- Psychotropic drugs.

1029
01:22:16,653 --> 01:22:17,933
And I began to ask about the surgeries, too

1030
01:22:21,213 --> 01:22:22,813
Ever heard of transorbital lobotomy?

1031
01:22:24,733 --> 01:22:26,013
they cap the patient with electroshocks,

1032
01:22:27,133 --> 01:22:30,853
then go through the eye with an ice pick

1033
01:22:31,933 --> 01:22:33,533
and pull out some nerve fibers

1034
01:22:36,533 --> 01:22:37,853
Makes the patient more obedient.

1035
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:40,653
Tractable

1036
01:22:41,453 --> 01:22:42,453
It's barbaric.

1037
01:22:43,853 --> 01:22:44,933
Unconscionable

1038
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:50,533
Do you know how pain enters the
body marshal? do you?

1039
01:22:51,453 --> 01:22:52,813
Depends on where you hurt.

1040
01:22:53,733 --> 01:22:55,013
No, it has nothing to the flesh

1041
01:22:55,613 --> 01:22:56,933
The brain controls pain.

1042
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:01,933
The brain controls fear, empathy,
sleep, anger, hunger ... everything.

1043
01:23:04,733 --> 01:23:05,613
what If you could control it?

1044
01:23:06,813 --> 01:23:07,813
the brain?

1045
01:23:07,933 --> 01:23:09,453
To re-create a man,

1046
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:11,933
so he doesn't feel pain

1047
01:23:12,533 --> 01:23:14,533
Or love. Or sympathy.

1048
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:20,213
A man who can't be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess

1049
01:23:23,213 --> 01:23:24,733
They can never takes
all men memories

1050
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,213
Never.

1051
01:23:26,453 --> 01:23:29,733
And you know the North Koreans
use american POWs

1052
01:23:30,533 --> 01:23:32,933
during brainwashing experiments

1053
01:23:33,013 --> 01:23:35,453
they turns soldiers into traitors.
that's what they are doing here.

1054
01:23:35,533 --> 01:23:39,933
Creates ghosts and give way in the world.
And do things sane man never do.

1055
01:23:40,013 --> 01:23:42,718
that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge

1056
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:50,813
It would take years.

1057
01:23:45,013 --> 01:23:48,333
Years of research,
experiments on hundreds of patients.

1058
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:53,453
For 50 years now,
people will look back

1059
01:23:53,453 --> 01:23:56,013
and they say ... this place
is where it all began.

1060
01:23:56,933 --> 01:23:59,013
The Nazis used the Jews
the Soviets

1061
01:23:59,053 --> 01:24:01,613
used prisoners in their own gulags
and we...

1062
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:03,453
We tested patients,

1063
01:24:04,253 --> 01:24:05,333
on Shutter Island.

1064
01:24:06,613 --> 01:24:08,133
No, they won't ...
no

1065
01:24:12,813 --> 01:24:13,933
you do understand

1066
01:24:17,533 --> 01:24:19,533
That they can't let you leave?

1067
01:24:20,053 --> 01:24:21,053
I'm a federal marshall ...

1068
01:24:21,813 --> 01:24:23,133
they can't stop me.

1069
01:24:24,533 --> 01:24:25,653
I was a esteemed psychiatrist,

1070
01:24:28,013 --> 01:24:30,013
from a respected family.

1071
01:24:31,013 --> 01:24:32,533
It did not matter.

1072
01:24:35,453 --> 01:24:36,533
let me ask you ...

1073
01:24:37,533 --> 01:24:38,453
any past trauma in your life?

1074
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:44,453
yes, why... why that matter?

1075
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,813
If a particular event is past

1076
01:24:46,853 --> 01:24:49,213
the reason you lost your sanity......

1077
01:24:49,933 --> 01:24:51,533
so when they commit you in here

1078
01:24:52,133 --> 01:24:55,733
your friends, colleagues will say...
he has cracked.

1079
01:24:56,733 --> 01:24:59,253
And who would do it,
after what happened.

1080
01:24:59,253 --> 01:25:01,613
That could be said of anyone

1081
01:25:01,733 --> 01:25:04,253
- anyone at all.
- The point is they're going to say it about you.

1082
01:25:07,933 --> 01:25:09,053
How's your head?

1083
01:25:10,133 --> 01:25:12,653
- My head?
- You had funny dreams?

1084
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:17,333
trouble Sleeping, headaches ...

1085
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:20,533
I'm prone to migraine

1086
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:21,533
Jesus!

1087
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:25,653
you haven't taken any pills, no?

1088
01:25:26,533 --> 01:25:28,870
- Not even aspire?
- I get a aspirin.

1089
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,375
Jesus!

1090
01:25:30,653 --> 01:25:33,733
And you ate in the canteen and of drinking
coffee that gave it.

1091
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:36,333
Tell me that even
Smoking Cigars of you.

1092
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:41,733
Not ... no.

1093
01:25:43,133 --> 01:25:44,333
I haven't.

1094
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:47,853
It takes between 36 and 48 hours for
neuroleptics narcotics ...

1095
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:51,333
To reach sufficient blood
that you-and take effect.

1096
01:25:51,373 --> 01:25:53,133
pulse will become first

1097
01:25:54,133 --> 01:25:56,133
Fingers first and then
shall include all labor.

1098
01:25:58,133 --> 01:26:01,333
seen any waking nightmares lately,
marshall?

1099
01:26:04,613 --> 01:26:06,333
Tell me what's going on in that lighthouse?

1100
01:26:08,053 --> 01:26:09,133
Tell me.

1101
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:12,213
brain surgery.

1102
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:16,653
Like, "to open the skull to see
What if we pull on this kind. "..............

1103
01:26:17,213 --> 01:26:19,453
that's not different with Nazi's kind

1104
01:26:22,133 --> 01:26:23,853
And then they created the ghosts.

1105
01:26:25,453 --> 01:26:27,333
Who knows about this?

1106
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,653
on the islandm i mean. Who?

1107
01:26:32,013 --> 01:26:33,333
Everyone.

1108
01:26:33,453 --> 01:26:36,733
Come on, the nurses, the orderlies?

1109
01:26:37,733 --> 01:26:40,133
- it's not possible ...
- Everybody.

1110
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:00,453
you can't stay here.

1111
01:27:00,933 --> 01:27:04,253
They think i'm dead, that I drowned.
If they come looking for you, they might finf me

1112
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:06,613
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1113
01:27:13,733 --> 01:27:15,213
I'm gonna come back for you.

1114
01:27:15,453 --> 01:27:18,333
I will not be here. I move during the day.
new places every night.

1115
01:27:18,373 --> 01:27:20,653
but I could come get you
take you out of the island.

1116
01:27:20,653 --> 01:27:22,733
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1117
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:26,533
The only way off the island
is ferry and they control it

1118
01:27:27,133 --> 01:27:28,733
You'll never leave here.

1119
01:27:38,332 --> 01:27:39,652
I had a friend.

1120
01:27:40,132 --> 01:27:42,452
he was with me yesterday,
but we got seperated.

1121
01:27:43,212 --> 01:27:44,732
Have you seen him?

1122
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:47,532
marshall ...

1123
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:50,652
You have no friends.

1124
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:24,132
There you are.

1125
01:28:26,012 --> 01:28:28,332
We've been wondering when
you'd show up

1126
01:28:30,212 --> 01:28:31,532
Take a seat.

1127
01:28:32,132 --> 01:28:33,332
Come on.

1128
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:46,132
Taking a leisurely stroll? were we?

1129
01:28:47,332 --> 01:28:48,732
I just...

1130
01:28:49,452 --> 01:28:50,732
just looking around.

1131
01:28:53,332 --> 01:28:55,332
Did you enjoy
God's latest gift?

1132
01:28:56,932 --> 01:28:58,932
- What?
- The God's gifts.

1133
01:29:00,452 --> 01:29:01,932
the violence.

1134
01:29:06,612 --> 01:29:09,932
when I came downstaires in my home
and saw a tree in my living room

1135
01:29:10,932 --> 01:29:12,932
it reached for me like a divine hand.

1136
01:29:14,532 --> 01:29:16,212
God loves violence.

1137
01:29:19,212 --> 01:29:21,812
- I hadn't noticed.
- sure you have.

1138
01:29:22,452 --> 01:29:24,132
Why else would there be so much of it?

1139
01:29:24,932 --> 01:29:26,332
It's in us.

1140
01:29:26,532 --> 01:29:27,732
what we are.

1141
01:29:29,452 --> 01:29:32,652
we wage war, we burn sacrifices
we pillage and plunder

1142
01:29:32,732 --> 01:29:34,292
and treat at the flesh
of our brothers

1143
01:29:34,332 --> 01:29:38,132
and why? Because God gave us violence
to wage in his honor.

1144
01:29:41,332 --> 01:29:43,492
I thought God gave us moral orders.

1145
01:29:43,532 --> 01:29:46,132
There is no moral orders
as pure as this storm.

1146
01:29:47,012 --> 01:29:49,012
There's no moral order at all.

1147
01:29:49,452 --> 01:29:52,932
there's just this:
can my violence conquer yours?

1148
01:29:58,332 --> 01:30:00,132
- I'm not violent.
- You are.

1149
01:30:01,732 --> 01:30:03,532
You're violent as they come.

1150
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:07,332
I know, because I am as violent as they come.

1151
01:30:08,452 --> 01:30:10,212
From constructred society
we were lifted..............

1152
01:30:10,532 --> 01:30:15,332
If I always stood between you and my meal you
would crack my skull with rock and steal my meal

1153
01:30:18,052 --> 01:30:19,532
Poor you

1154
01:30:22,212 --> 01:30:25,852
Cawley thinks you're harmless, you can be
controled, but I know are different.

1155
01:30:27,012 --> 01:30:30,932
- You don't know me.
- Oh but I do.

1156
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:34,012
We've known each other for centuries.

1157
01:30:43,532 --> 01:30:46,132
If I am to send my teeth to sank into your eye
right now,

1158
01:30:46,172 --> 01:30:49,332
could you stop me before I blinded you?

1159
01:30:53,332 --> 01:30:54,852
Give it a try.

1160
01:30:56,332 --> 01:31:00,332
That's the spirit.

1161
01:31:43,532 --> 01:31:45,012
Where have you been?

1162
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:48,212
Wandering, just looking at your island.

1163
01:31:48,332 --> 01:31:52,452
You'll be leaving,
Now that Rachel has been found.

1164
01:31:52,932 --> 01:31:54,332
sure.

1165
01:31:56,532 --> 01:31:57,732
big meeting

1166
01:31:58,332 --> 01:32:00,732
Oh, yes ...

1167
01:32:00,812 --> 01:32:03,332
Apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward C yesterday

1168
01:32:03,372 --> 01:32:06,732
He subdued a very dangerous patient.
quite handly.

1169
01:32:07,932 --> 01:32:08,932
Even so?.........

1170
01:32:09,052 --> 01:32:13,452
It seems he had a long concersation with a
paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.

1171
01:32:16,452 --> 01:32:19,212
This Noyce,
so you said his name was,

1172
01:32:20,132 --> 01:32:23,172
- he's delusional, right?
- oh extremely. he can be quite upseting

1173
01:32:23,212 --> 01:32:26,212
In fact, two weeks ago, a patient
was so worked up

1174
01:32:26,252 --> 01:32:30,012
over one of Noyce's stories
that he beat him up.

1175
01:32:30,332 --> 01:32:31,852
Cigarette?

1176
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:34,932
No, thanks.
I quit.

1177
01:32:36,532 --> 01:32:38,532
So, you'll taking the ferry?

1178
01:32:39,132 --> 01:32:40,452
Absolutely ...

1179
01:32:41,132 --> 01:32:42,852
I think we've gotten
all we came here for

1180
01:32:43,732 --> 01:32:44,852
"We" Marshall?

1181
01:32:47,012 --> 01:32:48,652
Speaking of a ..............

1182
01:32:49,132 --> 01:32:51,452
- You've seen him, Doctor?
- Who?

1183
01:32:52,332 --> 01:32:53,852
My partner, Chuck.

1184
01:32:56,532 --> 01:32:58,452
You don't have a partner, Marshall.
You came here alone.

1185
01:33:00,932 --> 01:33:03,412
You know, I've built something valuable here

1186
01:33:03,452 --> 01:33:06,812
But valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time

1187
01:33:06,932 --> 01:33:08,812
Everyone wants a quick fix,
they always have

1188
01:33:08,932 --> 01:33:12,332
I'm trying to do something that people
that even you don't undersyand

1189
01:33:12,452 --> 01:33:14,812
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight

1190
01:33:16,212 --> 01:33:18,652
I can see that ...

1191
01:33:22,332 --> 01:33:24,132
so tell me again
about your partner.

1192
01:33:26,012 --> 01:33:27,852
What partner?

1193
01:34:30,212 --> 01:34:31,852
Marshall ...

1194
01:34:33,132 --> 01:34:34,532
Going somewhere?

1195
01:34:35,012 --> 01:34:38,532
No. Just ... take my way
to ferry.

1196
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:41,732
I'm afraid it's the other side.

1197
01:34:44,652 --> 01:34:46,452
If you wait a moment,

1198
01:34:47,012 --> 01:34:49,852
I find someone to take you
to the port.

1199
01:34:53,532 --> 01:34:55,972
What is this, Doctor?

1200
01:34:56,012 --> 01:34:58,452
it's just a sedative?

1201
01:34:58,532 --> 01:35:01,052
- It's for precaution.
- precaution?

1202
01:35:03,452 --> 01:35:07,532
What are you going to do?
To kill me?

1203
01:35:08,052 --> 01:35:09,332
you think you deserve it

1204
01:35:09,812 --> 01:35:12,532
for what?
for provoking you?

1205
01:35:13,052 --> 01:35:15,532
and forgive me
what doesn't provoke you?

1206
01:35:15,932 --> 01:35:17,052
remarks ...

1207
01:35:17,452 --> 01:35:18,812
- Words ...
- Nazi !

1208
01:35:19,652 --> 01:35:21,132
And that too

1209
01:35:21,652 --> 01:35:23,332
And of course, memories, dreams ...

1210
01:35:24,532 --> 01:35:28,452
did you knew that the word "trauma" comes
from a Greek word of wound?

1211
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:33,012
And what's the German word for "dream"
is "traumen.

1212
01:35:33,052 --> 01:35:34,132
. Traumen......... "
a dream-.

1213
01:35:35,452 --> 01:35:38,132
Wounds can creates monsters.

1214
01:35:38,452 --> 01:35:40,932
And you ...
you are wounded, Marshall.

1215
01:35:41,932 --> 01:35:44,732
I think you're agree,
when you see a monster

1216
01:35:45,532 --> 01:35:46,932
you must stop it.

1217
01:35:49,932 --> 01:35:51,932
- I agree.
- Yes ...

1218
01:36:36,652 --> 01:36:38,332
What are you doing, baby?

1219
01:36:43,452 --> 01:36:45,012
You've got to get to the ferry.

1220
01:36:45,652 --> 01:36:47,732
No. Not ... no.

1221
01:36:51,732 --> 01:36:55,532
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he is perfect for their experiments.

1222
01:36:56,132 --> 01:36:58,612
Only one place they'd take him

1223
01:37:01,132 --> 01:37:03,532
You go there and you'll die.

1224
01:37:03,612 --> 01:37:07,452
He's my partner. if they're hurting him
holding him against his will, I have to bring him out

1225
01:37:07,812 --> 01:37:09,812
I can not lose anyone else.

1226
01:37:10,452 --> 01:37:14,452
Do not go there.
Please don 't do this Teddy.

1227
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:19,212
I'm sorry, honey.

1228
01:37:20,932 --> 01:37:23,532
I love this because
you gave it to me

1229
01:37:26,212 --> 01:37:28,132
But the truth is ...

1230
01:37:28,212 --> 01:37:31,132
it's one fucking ugly tie.

1231
01:38:09,932 --> 01:38:11,052
No!

1232
01:39:29,532 --> 01:39:31,332
Do not move!
Stay where you are.

1233
01:39:32,932 --> 01:39:34,532
Are you going to kill me?

1234
01:39:34,932 --> 01:39:38,852
No.
I will not kill you.

1235
01:41:26,451 --> 01:41:29,211
Why are you all wet, baby?

1236
01:41:30,331 --> 01:41:32,731
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1237
01:41:45,651 --> 01:41:48,011
The rifle's empty by the way.

1238
01:41:53,451 --> 01:41:55,251
have a seat

1239
01:42:01,731 --> 01:42:04,811
For god's sake dry off
you're going to catch cold

1240
01:42:05,931 --> 01:42:06,931
all right.

1241
01:42:09,531 --> 01:42:12,211
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1242
01:42:14,811 --> 01:42:16,931
I do not know what
are you talking about.

1243
01:42:19,651 --> 01:42:21,211
Yes. he's here.

1244
01:42:21,731 --> 01:42:24,651
Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up

1245
01:42:26,331 --> 01:42:28,131
So, Dr. Shehan ...

1246
01:42:28,731 --> 01:42:29,931
He came on the ferry
this morining.

1247
01:42:30,931 --> 01:42:31,931
Not exactly.

1248
01:42:33,651 --> 01:42:36,131
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1249
01:42:37,451 --> 01:42:39,131
sorry to hear about that.

1250
01:42:42,451 --> 01:42:44,011
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1251
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:46,531
How are the hallucinations?

1252
01:42:47,531 --> 01:42:48,931
. Go away, Teddy ....................

1253
01:42:50,131 --> 01:42:51,931
. this place is gonna be the end of you ..

1254
01:42:54,851 --> 01:42:57,531
- Not bad.
- they'll get worse.

1255
01:42:58,011 --> 01:42:59,051
I know.

1256
01:42:59,931 --> 01:43:01,331
Dr. Solando ...

1257
01:43:02,251 --> 01:43:04,611
she told me about neuroleptics.

1258
01:43:04,731 --> 01:43:07,931
did she now?
and when was this?

1259
01:43:08,051 --> 01:43:12,811
I found her doctor,in a cave on the cliffs.
But you won't get her.

1260
01:43:12,931 --> 01:43:14,451
I don't doubt it.

1261
01:43:15,051 --> 01:43:16,811
considerations are not real.

1262
01:43:18,331 --> 01:43:20,731
But your hallucinations are
more severe than I thought.

1263
01:43:22,211 --> 01:43:24,131
You are not on neuroleptics.

1264
01:43:25,131 --> 01:43:27,451
You are not on neuroleptics
as a matter of fact

1265
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,731
Then what the fuck is this?
Huh, what the fuck is this?

1266
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:30,851
Withdrawal.

1267
01:43:31,131 --> 01:43:32,331
Withdrawal?

1268
01:43:32,731 --> 01:43:35,531
From what? I haven't even had a goddamned
drink since we got on this island.

1269
01:43:35,571 --> 01:43:36,851
Chlorpromazine

1270
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:40,851
I'm not a fan of pharmacology
but I have to see in your case ...

1271
01:43:41,731 --> 01:43:44,011
- Clorpro ... like you said?
- Chlorpromazine.

1272
01:43:44,731 --> 01:43:49,131
the same thing we've
been giving you for the last 24 months.

1273
01:43:50,531 --> 01:43:52,931
So in the past two years

1274
01:43:53,011 --> 01:43:55,531
you have had somebody in Boston
who gave me drugs.........

1275
01:43:55,571 --> 01:43:57,851
Not Boston.
Here.

1276
01:43:58,851 --> 01:44:03,131
You've been here for two years.
a patient of this institutions.

1277
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:09,731
After everythings I see here, Doctor,

1278
01:44:10,211 --> 01:44:12,651
You really thinks you can
convince me I'm crazy?

1279
01:44:12,731 --> 01:44:16,931
You know what kind of people we are dealing?
I'm U.S. marshal

1280
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:21,091
You were a U.S. marshal
Here's a copy of your intake form

1281
01:44:21,131 --> 01:44:24,331
you broke into ward C for.
Proof of the 67th patient

1282
01:44:24,451 --> 01:44:27,331
If you'd gotten to the mainland,
you could have blown the lid off this place.

1283
01:44:27,851 --> 01:44:29,131
- wait ...wait
- But somehow

1284
01:44:29,211 --> 01:44:30,931
and yet you couldn't find time
to look at it yet. read it

1285
01:44:32,131 --> 01:44:33,331
Go ahead

1286
01:44:37,011 --> 01:44:39,131
The patient is highly intelligent
highly delusional.

1287
01:44:39,211 --> 01:44:40,651
Decorated army veteran.

1288
01:44:41,211 --> 01:44:42,651
prisoned for the
liberation of Dachav.

1289
01:44:43,531 --> 01:44:45,651
Former U.S. marshal

1290
01:44:46,011 --> 01:44:47,331
known proclivity for violence.

1291
01:44:47,451 --> 01:44:49,131
shown no remorse for his crime because
his denial is such

1292
01:44:49,211 --> 01:44:52,531
that no crime ever took place
highly developed and fantastical

1293
01:44:52,571 --> 01:44:55,731
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions...

1294
01:44:55,851 --> 01:44:56,931
I am tired of this bullshits.

1295
01:44:57,011 --> 01:44:58,331
Where's my partner?

1296
01:44:58,451 --> 01:44:59,931
Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1297
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:02,931
Let's try this in another way.

1298
01:45:03,051 --> 01:45:05,411
your wife's maiden name was
"Chana" am I correct?

1299
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:07,651
- Not even talk about her!
- I'm afraid I have to.

1300
01:45:09,331 --> 01:45:12,211
Notice anything these four names have in common?

1301
01:45:12,731 --> 01:45:13,811
the rule 4.

1302
01:45:14,331 --> 01:45:16,731
- Andrew, what do you see?
- If you done anything

1303
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:20,811
- to my partner, Doctor, It is a violation ...
- Focus, Andrew. What do you see?

1304
01:45:21,531 --> 01:45:23,931
the names ...
have the same letters.

1305
01:45:24,011 --> 01:45:26,451
Edward Daniels has exactly same
13 letters

1306
01:45:26,531 --> 01:45:29,011
As Andrew Laeddis.
the same as Rachel and Solando

1307
01:45:29,051 --> 01:45:31,451
and Dolore Chan. All names

1308
01:45:31,531 --> 01:45:33,851
- Are anagrams of each other.
- Tactics of intimidation........

1309
01:45:34,331 --> 01:45:35,811
it doesn't work on me.

1310
01:45:35,851 --> 01:45:38,131
You came here for the truth.
Here it is.

1311
01:45:38,331 --> 01:45:39,931
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1312
01:45:40,211 --> 01:45:43,851
the 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1313
01:45:44,531 --> 01:45:45,931
Bullshit

1314
01:45:46,211 --> 01:45:48,651
You were committed here by
court order 24 months ago.

1315
01:45:48,731 --> 01:45:51,931
your crime's terrible.
One you can't forgieve yourself.

1316
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:53,731
So you invented
another self.

1317
01:45:58,611 --> 01:45:59,731
Let us return to the facts.

1318
01:46:00,251 --> 01:46:04,131
And have created a story in which
you're not a murderer, you are hearless.......

1319
01:46:04,531 --> 01:46:06,011
you are a U.S marshal.

1320
01:46:06,051 --> 01:46:07,451
only here in Ashkliff
because of a case

1321
01:46:07,731 --> 01:46:09,051
and you've uncovered conspiracy

1322
01:46:09,451 --> 01:46:11,811
So that anything we tell you about
who you are, what you've done

1323
01:46:12,451 --> 01:46:14,931
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew

1324
01:46:14,971 --> 01:46:16,051
My name is Edward Daniels.

1325
01:46:16,651 --> 01:46:19,451
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years. I know every details.

1326
01:46:19,811 --> 01:46:22,211
Patient 67. Storm.
Rachel Solando.

1327
01:46:22,331 --> 01:46:24,851
your missing partner
Dreams you have every night.

1328
01:46:24,851 --> 01:46:27,211
You were at Dachave,
But it could not have killed any guards.

1329
01:46:31,131 --> 01:46:34,011
I wish i could let you just
live in your fantasy world

1330
01:46:34,531 --> 01:46:35,731
I really do.

1331
01:46:36,211 --> 01:46:40,851
But are violent, trained, dangerous.
You're the most dangerous patient we have.

1332
01:46:41,211 --> 01:46:43,651
You've injured all of the guards
Other patients.

1333
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:46,211
Two weeks ago
you attacked George Noyce.

1334
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:47,731
I did so something!.............................

1335
01:46:47,931 --> 01:46:49,731
- You have ............
- off course I didn't.

1336
01:46:49,931 --> 01:46:51,931
Give me one reason
why i even touch him.

1337
01:46:52,051 --> 01:46:53,851
Because he called you Laeddis

1338
01:46:53,931 --> 01:46:56,131
and you do anything not to be him

1339
01:46:57,451 --> 01:46:59,931
I have a transcript of that conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday .

1340
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:04,131
This is about you and Laeddis
That's all it's ever been about

1341
01:47:06,251 --> 01:47:08,731
This says it's about
"me and Laeddis".

1342
01:47:08,771 --> 01:47:11,211
When you've asked him what happened
to his face,

1343
01:47:11,251 --> 01:47:13,531
said, and I quote again,
"You did it".

1344
01:47:14,051 --> 01:47:17,451
- he meant it was my fault he ...
- you almost killed him.

1345
01:47:19,811 --> 01:47:23,451
The warden and the board of overseas
are determined that something be done it's been decided

1346
01:47:24,331 --> 01:47:28,211
nevertheles we can bring you back in sanity now
right now

1347
01:47:28,851 --> 01:47:31,731
Permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can't hurt anyone ever again

1348
01:47:35,451 --> 01:47:37,651
they lobotomine you, Andrew.

1349
01:47:37,731 --> 01:47:39,131
do you understand?

1350
01:47:43,011 --> 01:47:44,211
Yes, I understand.

1351
01:47:45,131 --> 01:47:47,011
I understand just fine

1352
01:47:48,211 --> 01:47:52,091
If , if I don't play along
with your little game here

1353
01:47:52,131 --> 01:47:54,651
Dr. Naehring will turn me into
one of his ghosts.

1354
01:47:54,731 --> 01:47:56,251
What about my partner?

1355
01:47:56,931 --> 01:48:01,051
you mean a U.S. marshal
is a  defense mechanism?

1356
01:48:03,051 --> 01:48:04,251
Hey, boss .

1357
01:48:22,051 --> 01:48:24,931
What the fuck is going on here?

1358
01:48:28,011 --> 01:48:29,531
you're working for him?

1359
01:48:30,011 --> 01:48:34,931
I'm sorry about that
someone had to stay with you, keep you safe

1360
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:38,851
You've been watch me, right?

1361
01:48:39,531 --> 01:48:41,331
watch me every minute.

1362
01:48:43,131 --> 01:48:44,451
Who ... who are you?

1363
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:46,131
Who are you?
Tell me.

1364
01:48:46,651 --> 01:48:48,331
don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1365
01:48:50,131 --> 01:48:52,651
I've been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1366
01:48:53,931 --> 01:48:55,331
I am Lester Sheehan.

1367
01:49:01,331 --> 01:49:03,731
And I told you about my wife ...

1368
01:49:03,931 --> 01:49:06,931
- I know.
- I climbed a cliff to save you.

1369
01:49:07,651 --> 01:49:11,571
I trusted you. I risked
everything, after you. Everything!

1370
01:49:11,651 --> 01:49:12,691
I know, boss `.

1371
01:49:12,731 --> 01:49:14,331
we're running out of time here, Andrew,

1372
01:49:15,731 --> 01:49:18,211
I swore before the entire board of
overseas that I could construct

1373
01:49:18,251 --> 01:49:20,651
The most radical, role-play

1374
01:49:20,731 --> 01:49:23,211
ever in history of psychiatry and
that will bring you back.

1375
01:49:23,251 --> 01:49:25,731
I thought if we let you play
this out

1376
01:49:26,451 --> 01:49:29,331
we could get you to see how
untrue how impossible it is

1377
01:49:31,011 --> 01:49:32,331
we've had to tun of the place for two days

1378
01:49:33,011 --> 01:49:35,731
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments

1379
01:49:36,651 --> 01:49:38,331
The satanic O.R.'s

1380
01:49:51,051 --> 01:49:52,651
Andrew, listen to me.

1381
01:49:55,011 --> 01:49:56,531
If we fail on you

1382
01:49:57,731 --> 01:49:59,931
then everything we've tried
to do here will be discredited.

1383
01:50:00,051 --> 01:50:01,131
Everything.

1384
01:50:03,451 --> 01:50:05,611
We are on the first line of a war, Andrew

1385
01:50:07,131 --> 01:50:09,451
and right now, in this place
it comes down to you

1386
01:50:16,131 --> 01:50:18,131
Do not move!

1387
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:21,211
- Andrew, no!
- My name is Teddy Daniels.

1388
01:50:22,131 --> 01:50:24,851
This one is loaded.
I can tell from the weight.

1389
01:50:24,931 --> 01:50:26,931
I see. and that's your firearm marshall
You're sure?

1390
01:50:27,451 --> 01:50:28,931
There's a dent in the barrel from
the day Philip Stacks shot at me.........

1391
01:50:29,011 --> 01:50:33,131
and the bullet ricocheted. You're not going to mind-fuck me out of this doc

1392
01:50:33,171 --> 01:50:36,131
Then blast away, because that's the
only way you're ever getting off this island

1393
01:50:42,731 --> 01:50:44,131
Andrew, please don't.

1394
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:55,851
My gun ...

1395
01:51:02,731 --> 01:51:04,251
What have you done to
my goddamned gun.

1396
01:51:05,331 --> 01:51:06,811
It's a toy, Andrew.

1397
01:51:09,531 --> 01:51:11,051
we're telling you the truth.

1398
01:51:12,531 --> 01:51:15,731
Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive.
suicidal.

1399
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:19,291
You drank. stay away.
ignored what everyone told you.

1400
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:22,211
You moved in that lake house after
she, purposely,

1401
01:51:22,331 --> 01:51:24,851
set your city apartment on fire

1402
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:26,651
Andrew... Andrew
stop it

1403
01:51:28,851 --> 01:51:29,851
you're lying...

1404
01:51:30,331 --> 01:51:32,011
These are your children.

1405
01:51:32,851 --> 01:51:34,011
Serena ...

1406
01:51:34,931 --> 01:51:37,531
- Henry ...
- I have no children.

1407
01:51:37,731 --> 01:51:39,131
Your wife drowned them

1408
01:51:39,531 --> 01:51:42,011
in the cabin by the lake.

1409
01:51:42,131 --> 01:51:44,211
And here, the little girl,
you dream about

1410
01:51:44,851 --> 01:51:45,931
every night.

1411
01:51:46,651 --> 01:51:47,811
I never had a daughter.

1412
01:51:47,851 --> 01:51:51,731
the one who tells you over and over that
you should saved her

1413
01:51:51,811 --> 01:51:52,931
save them all

1414
01:51:53,531 --> 01:51:54,651
Your daughter ...

1415
01:51:55,131 --> 01:51:58,011
Her name is Rachel. are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1416
01:51:59,251 --> 01:52:00,331
Andrew, are you?

1417
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,930
I'm so sorry, honey ..

1418
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:31,130
I told you not to coming here.

1419
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:33,010
I told you ...

1420
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:36,130
this would be the end of you.

1421
01:52:55,730 --> 01:52:58,130
I came back.
we got him

1422
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:00,730
just out of Oklahoma.
must stopped ten places

1423
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:03,730
between here and Tulsa
I could sleep for a week

1424
01:53:08,050 --> 01:53:09,210
Dolores?

1425
01:53:16,210 --> 01:53:17,930
Dolores?

1426
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:25,130
Dolores?

1427
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:39,930
Dolores?

1428
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:05,450
Honey ...

1429
01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:08,930
Why are you all wet?

1430
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:13,330
I missed you.

1431
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:22,930
I want to go home.

1432
01:54:23,450 --> 01:54:26,650
You're home!

1433
01:54:30,450 --> 01:54:32,450
Where are the kids?

1434
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:39,210
they're in school.

1435
01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:44,850
It's Saturday, honey.

1436
01:54:45,330 --> 01:54:47,210
school's not in on Saturday

1437
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:51,610
my school is

1438
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:06,450
Oh my God!

1439
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:10,130
My God!

1440
01:55:24,010 --> 01:55:25,850
God!

1441
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:31,850
Oh, Good God, no!

1442
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:36,130
Come on!
Come on!

1443
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:55,930
Please, God, no.

1444
01:55:56,010 --> 01:55:59,530
No!

1445
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:01,530
No!

1446
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:08,050
No!

1447
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:11,450
No!

1448
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:14,810
Let put them in the kitchen.

1449
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:17,930
let's dry them off ...

1450
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:20,050
change their clothes ...

1451
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:25,010
They'll be our living dolls

1452
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:29,450
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1453
01:57:36,010 --> 01:57:37,530
If you ever loved me , Dolores ...

1454
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:39,730
Please stop talking

1455
01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:47,650
I need you to love me.

1456
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:57,530
I need you to free me!

1457
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:03,810
Honey ...

1458
01:58:06,450 --> 01:58:08,050
We'll give them baths...

1459
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:17,130
- I love you so much Dolores
- And I love you. I love you.

1460
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:49,330
Andrew ...

1461
01:58:50,850 --> 01:58:52,450
Andrew, can you hear me?

1462
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:57,250
Rachel!
Rachel, Rachel ...

1463
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:00,250
Rachel.

1464
01:59:02,610 --> 01:59:04,130
Rachel who?

1465
01:59:07,730 --> 01:59:08,730
Rachel Laeddis ...

1466
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:11,450
My daughter.

1467
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:16,730
Why are you here?

1468
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:21,650
Because I killed my wife.

1469
01:59:21,930 --> 01:59:23,210
and why did you do that?

1470
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:30,730
she murdered our children.

1471
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:34,530
And she told me to let her go.

1472
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:41,650
- Who is Teddy Daniels?
- he doesn't exist.

1473
01:59:43,730 --> 01:59:45,530
Neither Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1474
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:46,930
Why?

1475
01:59:48,730 --> 01:59:50,010
we need to hear you say it.

1476
01:59:56,730 --> 01:59:58,610
After she trie to kill
her for the first time,

1477
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:02,330
Dolores told me that ...

1478
02:00:03,930 --> 02:00:05,530
she has an insect ...

1479
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:08,450
living inside her brain.

1480
02:00:10,050 --> 02:00:10,810
she could feel it ...

1481
02:00:13,530 --> 02:00:15,130
walking cross
her skull ...

1482
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:19,730
pulling the wires,
just for fun.

1483
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:24,330
she told me that.

1484
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:27,210
she told me but i didn't listen

1485
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:33,130
I loved her so much.

1486
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:36,650
Why did you make them up?

1487
02:00:38,930 --> 02:00:42,130
Because I can not take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1488
02:00:50,010 --> 02:00:53,850
I killed them, because
i didn't get her some help.

1489
02:00:59,130 --> 02:01:02,130
I killed them...

1490
02:01:04,730 --> 02:01:08,650
Here's my theory, Andrew.
we broke through once before,

1491
02:01:08,730 --> 02:01:11,450
nine months ago,
and then you regressed.

1492
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:17,330
- I do not remember that.
- I know.

1493
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:20,530
you reset, Andrew.
like a tape

1494
02:01:20,650 --> 02:01:24,730
playing over and over on an endless loop

1495
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:27,850
I hope that what we've done will be enough
to stop it from happening again

1496
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:30,330
I need to know ...

1497
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:32,850
that you have accepted the reality.

1498
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:41,930
You came after me, Doctor?

1499
02:01:44,730 --> 02:01:47,530
You tried to help me when no one else would

1500
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:01,330
My name is Andrew Laeddis ...

1501
02:02:07,330 --> 02:02:11,450
And I murdered my wife
in the spring of 1952.

1502
02:02:35,010 --> 02:02:36,850
how we doing this morning?

1503
02:02:37,330 --> 02:02:38,850
good.
and You?

1504
02:02:39,010 --> 02:02:41,010
can't complain.

1505
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:52,050
So what's our next move?

1506
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:54,130
You tell me.

1507
02:02:59,530 --> 02:03:01,130
We've gotta get off this rock,
Chuck.

1508
02:03:02,530 --> 02:03:05,810
Back to the mainland. Whatever the
hell is going on here is bad.

1509
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:29,330
Do not worry, partner.
I'm gonna catch this

1510
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:37,330
that............ is too small for them.

1511
02:03:39,450 --> 02:03:41,130
Yes, we are.
aren't we?

1512
02:03:57,010 --> 02:03:58,610
You know this place makes
me wonder

1513
02:03:59,530 --> 02:04:01,050
Yeah? What's that boss?

1514
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:04,130
which would be worse?

1515
02:04:05,530 --> 02:04:07,130
To live as a monster ...

1516
02:04:07,810 --> 02:04:10,050
or to die as a good man.

1517
02:04:18,530 --> 02:04:19,450
Teddy?

1518
