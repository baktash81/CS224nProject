I'm cutting off your ice.
I'm not a freaking charity!

39
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:28,803
It's coming!

40
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,346
How you doing, honey?

41
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,141
Hey, Ruby! I thought you guys
were fishing first ledge.

42
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:35,018
You done already for the day?

43
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:37,937
Piece of shit quotas.

44
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:39,314
Bullshit quotas, right?

45
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,983
What are you gonna give
on those haddock? 2 bucks a pound?

46
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:44,402
- $2.50. And I'm being generous.
- $2.50?

47
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:46,404
What are you guys getting at auction?

48
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:48,615
Calm your liver.
Let me worry about numbers.

49
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:49,908
Sign over here.

50
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:52,076
What're you gonna
take her lunch money too?

51
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,960
What a dick.

52
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:03,880
I keep saying, let's sell our own fish.

53
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,549
They tried it down the Cape.

54
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:08,426
That all went to hell.

55
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,345
So keep bitching.
That'll work.

56
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:12,555
I got to go. Love you, Dad.

57
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,432
Don't forget about the doctor.

58
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:17,143
And the nets.

59
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:18,937
I know.

60
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,315
Bye, shit-face.

61
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,027

71

Where the Bill of Rights protected people

72
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,592
from the federal government,
Amendments 13, 14 and 15

73
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:52,428
protected them
from their state government.

74
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,684
Sadly, there was no amendment
to protect the right to nap.

75
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,561
Ruby... Ruby!

76
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,854
What's wrong?

77
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:05,191
OK, let's re-read.

78
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:07,360
And we will resume this tomorrow.

79
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,112
You are free to go!

80
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:18,705
- Guess what!
- What?

81
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,873
I did it.
I hooked up with Tiny Fingers.

82
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:22,834
Why?

83
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,295
I don't know!
Curiosity got the better of me.

84
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:26,879
Also, totally wrong!

85
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:29,424
Despite his tiny little
baby hands, it's...

86
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,343
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:34,053
Yeah, we have to change the nickname.

88
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:35,430
Do you smell fish?

89
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:43,980
Well, at least she's not
doing deaf voice anymore.

90
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:46,858
That's progress.

91
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,151
Hey, Audra!

92
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:51,821
Good. Just got out of music.

93
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:53,406
- What do you got now?
- Math.

94
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:58,870
So, the goal is to find the elective

95
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,663
that asks the least of you.

96
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,042
Like film club.

97
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,587
Also known as "put your backpack
down and go smoke a bowl."

98
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,883
Plus, Mr. Wabatch is actually
pretty hot, you know?

99
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:13,384
Like, in a Comic-Con kind of way.

100
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:14,886
Hi! Choir.

101
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:17,972
Choir.

102
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,807
OK, just fill this out.

103
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:20,892
Choir?

104
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,229
Are you high?

105
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:27,315
Shhh! I sing all the time.

106
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,399
Thanks.

107
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:31,236
OK, you're already socially challenged
enough here, but sure.

108
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,198
If you start, you know, beatboxing

109
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:38,660
or doing that cup clapping thing,
we're done, yeah?

You didn't change after fishing.

120
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:11,442
You stink.

121
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,864
I love rap music.

122
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,702
My whole ass is vibrating.

123
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:24,455
Just drive!

124
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,675
It's definitely itchy as hell.

125
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:37,385
It itches.

126
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,807
My nuts are on fire.

127
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:46,686
His, you know...

128
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:52,442
They're like angry hard little beets.

129
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:57,697
Covered in barnacles.

130
00:07:58,573 --> 00:07:59,616
I got it!

131
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,620
And your mother's got it even worse.

132
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:08,750
Like a boiled lobster claw.

133
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,836
Right, well, so the layman's
term for what you both have

134
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,046
is "jock itch."

135
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,757
It's common if you spend
a lot of time in damp clothes,

136
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,594
and it's.. It's easily
transferable via intercourse.

137
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:22,198
- You guys have jock itch.
- I'll give you an antifungal cream,

138
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:24,515
but you both have to keep the area dry

139
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,893
and avoid sex for two weeks.

140
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:30,730
You two need clean underwear.

141
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:32,440
And...

142
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:34,192
you're not allowed to do it anymore.

143
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:36,903
What?

144
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:39,280
For how long?

145
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:40,990
Never again.

146
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:42,242
Done for life.

147
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:47,789
Two weeks.

148
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,624
- Impossible.
- Can't do it.

149
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:18,903
Take those off. It's rude.

150
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:22,448
What's rude is how noisy you guys are!

151
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:24,951
I can't focus.

152
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:28,955
Go eat.

153
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,344
You know why God made farts smell?

154
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:48,892
So deaf people could enjoy them too.

155
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:01,029
Don't slouch. You'll get stuck.

156
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:02,739
Fifteen bucks, really?

157
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:05,742
You choose weed, I choose wine.

158
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:10,371
You don't want her! Swipe left.

159
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:12,874
None of them smile?

160
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,460
So? She's hot.

161
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:17,629
When I was modeling...

162
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:18,796
- Oh, here we go!
- Oh!

163
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,467
Yes! Your mother was the best!

164
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,844
First year I met her,
she won the Yankee Miss Pageant.

165
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:26,530
"...she won the Yankee
Miss Pageant." Mm-hmm!

166
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:28,640
Beat all those hearing girls.

167
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:31,601
She was hotter than all of them.

168
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:37,065
What about her?

169
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,275
So-so.

170
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:45,698
I thought we said no Tinder at the table!

171
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:50,245
How is music rude but Tinder's okay?

172
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:55,750
Because Tinder is something
we can all do as a family.

173
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,228
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

174
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:17,355
No, I did not tell you to sit.

175
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:19,607
On your feet, my friends.
Up, up!

176
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:25,238
They made my latte with some kind of
disgusting nut milk this morning,

177
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:26,573
so I'm in a mood.

178
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:28,700
Hey, come on! Come on!

179
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,038
My name is Bernardo Villalobos.

180
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:36,165
Berrrnardo. Berrrna..

181
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:38,293
If you can't roll your Rs,

182
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:41,796
please, please, don't embarrass yourself,

183
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,590
and just call me Mr. V.

184
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,844
OK, all of you, on this side.

185
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:49,929
Come on, move!
Everyone to this side.

186
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:51,723
Move!

187
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:55,852
Let's see if you're an alto, a soprano

188
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:58,104
or just watched too many episodes of Glee.

189
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:02,191
My birthday was last Tuesday,
so in lieu of gifts,

190
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:04,360
I will be accepting
the Happy Birthday song.

191
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:07,071
I do not need an entire meal.

192
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:10,033
I just want to place your voice.

193
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:12,243
You, Harry Potter.
Come on, let's hear it.

The red shirt.

212
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:17,100
Bless me with your birthday wishes.

213
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,816
Uh... Forget the words?

214
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:32,323
No, no, don't look at them.
They're not gonna help you.

Come on!

216
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:38,955
Oh! Huh...

217
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:41,916

I'll move money around tomorrow.

228
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:16,010
It's embarrassing!

229
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:17,345
What do you want me to do?

230
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:21,266
I gotta pay for ice, fuel.

231
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:27,355
Maybe we should sell the boat?

232
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:29,774
And then what?

233
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:35,405
It's the one thing I know how to do!

234
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,411
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

235
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:27,624
Yeah, how it is, is I can
barely feed my family.

236
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:29,334
Yeah, I can't even maintain my boat.

237
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,377
- It's bullshit!
- Listen, just take it easy.

238
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:33,504
I'm just telling you
what's going on, all right?

239
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,924
The feds are insisting on at-sea monitors.

240
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:37,443
Observers are gonna come onto your boat

241
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:39,260
to make sure you're not
breaking any rules.

242
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:41,137
That's out of our pocket?

243
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:43,306
So, I gotta pay to have a spy on my boat?

244
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:44,849
How much is that gonna cost?

245
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:47,644
It's $800 a day.

246
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:50,146
$800 a day.

247
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:54,400
That's more than we make in a day!

248
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:56,110
Don't tell me. Tell them.

249
00:16:57,987 --> 00:17:00,323
I've known you guys for years.
Come on.

250
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:01,532
We're not making a...

251
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:03,785
Oh, for Christ's sake!
I know it sucks.

252
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:13,294
Mr. V?

253
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:15,421
Shhh!
Shhh.

254
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:18,132
I'm meditating.

255
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:21,135
Two minutes to go.

256
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:24,013
OK.

257
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:30,715
Do you want me to wait or just..

258
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,980
Ah!

259
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:46,619
Most people who are terrified of singing
don't sign up for choir.

260
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,500
Other kids make me nervous.

261
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:55,753
I used to get made fun of.

262
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:03,303
I talked funny
when I first started school.

263
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:08,266
You're the girl with the deaf family?

264
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:13,271
Everyone but you?

265
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:14,439
Yeah.

266
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:17,817
And you sing.

267
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,653
Interesting.

268
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,156
Are you any good?

269
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:25,325
I don't know.

270
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:30,163
Why did you run out of my class?

271
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:33,374
I got scared.

272
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,002
Of what? Other kids?

273
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:37,545
Maybe.

274
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:41,925
Or maybe finding out that I'm bad.

275
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:48,681
Do you know what Bowie said
about Bob Dylan?

276
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:54,312
"A voice like sand and glue."

277
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:58,399
There are plenty of pretty voices
with nothing to say.

278
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,569
Do you have something to say?

279
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:05,657
I think so.

280
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,991
Good.

281
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:10,203
Then I'll see you in class...

282
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:12,288
Bob.

283
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,088
Oh!

284
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:22,340
Really?

285
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,218
Thank you!
Thank you!

286
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,703
- Please don't!
- No, I really... It might be good for you.

287
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:35,728
Oh my God!

288
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:37,146
Uh...

289
00:19:37,438 --> 00:19:38,439
Hi!

290
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,819
Do you have a second to call Grandma?

291
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,029
Use the video relay.

292
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:48,491
It's awkward to talk to an interpreter.

293
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:50,743
I have a friend over!

294
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:53,705
Leave her alone.
She's with a friend.

295
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:55,665
Damn, Leo got hot!

296
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:57,083
Ew!

297
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,377
What? He can't hear me.

298
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:04,048
Does he work out or are those,
like, fishing muscles?

299
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:06,384
OK, stop.
You cannot date my brother.

300
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:07,510
Why?

301
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:09,929
Because for you, dating just means sex,

302
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:12,765
which I don't even want to think about.

303
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:16,394
OK, I'm sure he doesn't need
his little sister protecting him.

304
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:18,521
Can you just go back to trying
to get with teachers?

305
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:20,982
- It's more entertaining.
- Oh, OK.

306
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:29,782
Ruby?

307
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,620
What the hell are we listening to?

308
00:20:33,703 --> 00:20:34,954
The Shaggs.

309
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:39,334
This song is called My Pal Foot Foot.

310
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:42,837
Ruby...

311
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:44,088

00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:49,344
- No!
- Right there.

Wait, I have a serious question.

319
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:58,937
What's the sign for, um...

320
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:01,814
for, "You're really smoking hot"?

321
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:02,899
No!

322
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:04,734
What about, "We should totally get it on"?

323
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:05,944
No!

324
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:08,529

00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:41,312

There's no sound without breath,
and none of you are breathing.

00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:44,334

OK, little dog.

00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:02,977

Push, push, push, push, push!
Push! Push, push, push!

365

Push, push, push!

More, more!

367
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:51,150

it's not sand and glue.

377
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:26,853
Go.

378
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:36,821
Shoo!

379
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:40,658
Ruby, Miles...

380
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:43,244

381
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:48,041

382
00:24:48,124 --> 00:24:49,250
Thank you.

383
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:52,337
Um, do you guys know each other?

384
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,380
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

385
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:56,883
Oh.

386
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:58,509
Yeah.

387
00:24:58,593 --> 00:25:00,094
I need a duet.

388
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,430
I need a duet for the fall concert.

389
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,683
You're All I Need to Get By.

390
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:06,893
- You know it?
- Yeah.

391
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:07,977
Know it?

392
00:25:10,188 --> 00:25:11,397
Educate yourself.

393
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:15,068

That's as good as I can go.

415
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,252
But I'll take 'em all, OK? Yeah?

416
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:15,461
All right.

417
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,464
Dad's out back.

418
00:26:18,548 --> 00:26:19,549
What are you giving him?

419
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:21,634
Stop. I got this.

420
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:23,428
2.75.

421
00:26:25,138 --> 00:26:27,640
I just heard Tony tell McKinney it was 3.

422
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:30,602
And his shit looks like
it's been baking in the sun.

423
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:33,187
Come on! It's 3,
or we take our catch back.

424
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:35,356
Ruby, get out of here.
Out of here!

425
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:38,484
He's ripping you off!

426
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,203
We're out in public!

427
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,957
It's medical.

428
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:57,420
I don't think being deaf
makes it legal to spark a fatty.

429
00:26:57,795 --> 00:26:59,172
What the hell was that?

430
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:02,008
I got the price up, didn't I?

431
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:06,012
I was handling it!
You made me look stupid.

432
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:09,599
No, you look stupid when Gio throws out
any number he wants

433
00:27:09,682 --> 00:27:11,684
and you can't cross-check it!

434
00:27:12,352 --> 00:27:13,353
Guys!

435
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:16,314
You want to fight,

436
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:20,485
go fight those assholes!

437
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:24,405
Our family sticks together.

438
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:33,873
I'd give my left nut to tell them
to go screw themselves.

439
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:37,627
So do it!

440
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:40,755

Miles, Ruby, we need to work.

456
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:18,895
Did you work on the song?

457
00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:19,979
Mm-hmm.

458
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,648

459
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:23,524

467
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:44,711
We did.

468
00:29:45,338 --> 00:29:47,799
Just not, like, together.

469
00:29:47,882 --> 00:29:49,342
Dios mio!

470
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:51,219
"Du-et."

471
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:52,804
It's in the word!

472
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:55,515
You must DU-ET together!

473
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:58,518
Face each other.

474
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:00,144
Come on, face each other!

475
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:03,481
You're afraid of her.

476
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:04,899
You're wise.

477
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:07,694
Come on, he doesn't have piojos.

478
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,822
Guys! This is not
the Pledge of Allegiance!

479
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:13,825
It's a love song. A love song!

480
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:18,413
Try to imagine what it's like
to sacrifice everything for another human.

481
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:20,540
OK?

482
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:22,709
So, again?

483
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:24,627
No.

484
00:30:25,128 --> 00:30:26,713
Of course, again!

485
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:29,048
You go first, Miles. OK?

486
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:32,510

Go work and come back.

510
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:25,230
- All right.
- Thank you.

511
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,024
Oh, try it on the guitar.

512
00:31:28,107 --> 00:31:29,984
OK, I'll work on it.

513
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:38,284
You can sing.

514
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,249
I mean, you have no control,
but your tone is lovely.

515
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:45,416
Thanks.

516
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:48,461
It's my favorite thing.

517
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:53,341
What are you doing next year?

518
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:54,425
I don't know.

519
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:56,803
Working with my dad.

520
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:59,347
No college?

521
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,848
I'm not good at school.

522
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,564
Miles is auditioning
for Berklee College of Music.

523
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:09,816
I've been coaching him for his audition.

524
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:14,153
What? You don't know Berklee?

525
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,698
I've heard of it.

526
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:17,782
Come on!

527
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:20,493
I grew up in Mexico City,
and even I knew Berklee.

528
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,037
Abe Laboriel,
the famous bassist, went there.

529
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:24,789
I did too.

530
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:27,125
I can't afford school.

531
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,460
They have scholarships.

532
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:39,137
How do you feel when you sing?

533
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,478
I don't know.

534
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:50,315
It's hard to explain.

535
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:54,319
Try.

536
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:47,497
You would need to sight-read
and learn a classical piece.

537
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:50,750
I need your nights and weekends.

538
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:53,503
I do not waste my time.

539
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,463
So if I'm offering,

540
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:58,258
it's because I hear something.

541
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:19,696
I joined the choir.

542
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:22,949
Why?

543
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:26,369
I like to sing.

544
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,377
What?

545
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:40,341
You're a teenager.

546
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:47,390
If I was blind, would you want to paint?

547
00:34:49,517 --> 00:34:51,561
Why is it always about you?

548
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,356
I'm meeting people.
I'm making friends.

549
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:58,943
You know what?

550
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:01,279
You should get out in the world too.

551
00:35:01,362 --> 00:35:02,405
Hey!

552
00:35:24,385 --> 00:35:26,262
We should do a co-op.

553
00:35:26,804 --> 00:35:29,515
Look, there's empty warehouses everywhere.

554
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:33,269
We could organize a business.

555
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:35,813
Get the other boats on board.

556
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:36,940
How?

557
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:38,983
Who's gonna support us?

558
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,736
We're the deaf guys!

559
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:46,658
They look at us like we're a joke.

560
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:49,369
Hey! I'm going to Pratty's for a brew.
Who wants to go?

561
00:35:49,452 --> 00:35:50,662
- I'm in!
- I'm in!

562
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:53,790
I'm gonna go with them.

563
00:35:53,873 --> 00:35:56,042
You want me to text Ruby?

564
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:57,460
No.

565
00:35:57,877 --> 00:36:00,255
I'm a grown man!

566
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:03,174
Come on, kid!

567
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:09,556
Hooks his arm around the pole...

568
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,599
Bear hugging it.

569
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:14,102
But when he does, he loses his pants.

570
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:15,436
They go down to his knees.

571
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,938
No word of a lie!

572
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,314
There he is hanging

573
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:20,775
with his milky white,
ginger ass hanging out.

574
00:36:21,401 --> 00:36:23,611
He's still thirty feet from the pole!

575
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:28,283
But of course, he's shit-faced.

576
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:30,660
Shocker!

577
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,127
I'm good! Crashing into shit!

578
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,673
Oh, shit!

579
00:36:46,134 --> 00:36:48,177
Oh yeah? What is that?

580
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:51,848
- Don't...
- Get out of my face.

581
00:36:53,016 --> 00:36:55,643
Get out of my face, freak!

582
00:36:56,644 --> 00:36:58,479
Don't, don't!

583
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:10,658
Take it outside!
Take it outside!

584
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:12,744
Let's get out of here!

585
00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:23,546
Want some, uh, ice for your eye?

586
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:31,846
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

587
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:54,095
At least they support you, right?
Your music?

588
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:56,598
Well, my dad insists
guitar is a waste of time

589
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,850
because it's not a true string instrument.

590
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,602
They suck the fun right out of it.

591
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:06,232
I'm sorry about all this.
My house is kind of gross.

592
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:07,775
It's cool.

593
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,202
No way! The Shaggs?

594
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:20,997
I'm really just here
to steal these ladies.

595
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:27,003
God!

596
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,297
I can't believe this actually works!

597
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,757
It sounds like shit.

598
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,467
But so does my stereo.

599
00:39:33,593 --> 00:39:35,345
My mom thought it was a waste of money.

600
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:37,472
It was $2 from Goodwill.

601
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:39,557
Do they, like...

602
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:43,311
Do they, like, even get what music is?

603
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:46,856
My dad really likes
gangster rap 'cause of the bass.

604
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:55,949
When we were little,
I used to see you guys in town.

605
00:39:56,449 --> 00:39:58,826
Yeah. We were hard to miss.

606
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,205
There was this one time..
I think it was, like, 3rd grade..

607
00:40:02,288 --> 00:40:04,207
Uh, you were at the Seaport Grill,

608
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,709
and you were ordering for your parents.

609
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:11,047
And you were talking to the waiter
like a total baller.

610
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,716
And then you ordered two beers.

611
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,385
I thought it was so cool.

612
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:16,928
Really?

613
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:20,306
Yeah.

614
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,767
My parents wouldn't even
let me ride the bus by myself.

615
00:40:23,518 --> 00:40:24,519
They're weird.

616
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:26,980
And they hate each other, so there's that.

617
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:36,072
So, how should we do this?

618
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:37,782
- Uh...
- Stand?

619
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,785
Yeah, maybe we should, like,

620
00:40:40,868 --> 00:40:42,829
I don't know, sing to each other.

00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:21,946
Is she OK?

669
00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:29,245
Oh!

670
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:49,474
We need to discuss this.

671
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:51,684
No, we don't.

672
00:43:51,768 --> 00:43:53,561
We had no idea you were home.

673
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:57,023
The doctor said you're not even
supposed to have sex!

674
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,484
Look at your mother!

675
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:01,236
Hot!

676
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:05,490
How am I supposed to control myself?

677
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:06,991
Maybe I should.. I should go.

678
00:44:07,408 --> 00:44:08,409
Sit.

679
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:10,619
OK.

680
00:44:11,287 --> 00:44:14,582
I want to know what your intentions are.

681
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,167
Dad, no.

682
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:18,545
You two have to use condoms, okay?

683
00:44:20,797 --> 00:44:23,049
Put a helmet on that soldier.

684
00:44:45,238 --> 00:44:47,156
Oh my God! Miles, go!

685
00:44:48,575 --> 00:44:50,159
You guys are the worst!

686
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:52,954
- Nice to meet you!
- Just.. Just please go.

687
00:44:57,417 --> 00:44:59,419
Ugh! I hate you!

688
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:10,680
Honestly, good for them.

689
00:45:10,763 --> 00:45:13,141
I don't think my mom's
had sex since my dad left.

690
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:16,060
Actually, that's not true.
Her divorce attorney.

691
00:45:17,812 --> 00:45:19,731
It was so embarrassing.

692
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:22,317
I can't ever see him again.

693
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,651
Pizza.

694
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:26,112
I think it's fine.

695
00:45:26,195 --> 00:45:28,197
He's probably already forgotten about it.

696
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,621
It's very cold.

697
00:46:06,611 --> 00:46:07,695
Hey, Ruby!

698
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:08,863
Get away from me!

699
00:46:08,947 --> 00:46:10,865
Wait! I didn't do that, OK?
I didn't tell them.

700
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:11,950
Yes, you did.

701
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:14,869
No. No, I didn't.
I told Jay, one person.

702
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,372
Come on... We were laughing.

703
00:46:17,455 --> 00:46:18,706
I thought it was funny.

Ruby, no!

715
00:47:14,888 --> 00:47:17,682
If you're gonna pick Joni Mitchell,
you gotta sing it.

716
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:20,393
- This is one of the great songs.
- Yeah, I know.

717
00:47:21,561 --> 00:47:23,313
You either find a way to connect to it

718
00:47:23,396 --> 00:47:25,189
or pick a different song.

719
00:47:25,273 --> 00:47:26,566
OK, come on!

00:47:26,649 --> 00:47:27,901

00:47:27,984 --> 00:47:28,985
Shake your arms. Come on!

722
00:47:30,153 --> 00:47:32,822
Ha! Now, sing back at me.

723
00:47:32,906 --> 00:47:36,659
<i>♪ Mi, mi, mi, mi! ♪</i>

724
00:47:36,743 --> 00:47:37,744
Come on!

725
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:39,621
<i>♪ Mi, mi, mi, mi! ♪</i>

726
00:47:39,704 --> 00:47:41,331
No, no, you're holding it!

727
00:47:41,414 --> 00:47:43,791
- I'm not!
- Yeah! You're trying to sound pretty!

728
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,418
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are.

729
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:48,213
Oh, OK.

730
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,132
You said when you started school,

731
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:52,675
you talked funny.

732
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:55,136
Funny how?

733
00:47:57,096 --> 00:47:58,514
I talked like a deaf person.

734
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:00,558
What does a deaf person sound like?

735
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,102
You know.

736
00:48:03,186 --> 00:48:04,687
No, no.
I don't know.

737
00:48:04,771 --> 00:48:06,439
I want you to tell me.

738
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,067
Different.

739
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,568
Different how?

740
00:48:10,652 --> 00:48:13,071
Like, wrong. Ugly.

741
00:48:13,154 --> 00:48:14,239
"Ugly." OK.

742
00:48:14,322 --> 00:48:16,074
Make an ugly sound for me.

743
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:18,535
- What?
- Come on! Yeah.

744
00:48:18,618 --> 00:48:21,204
You think you were the only kid
who ever got bullied,

745
00:48:21,287 --> 00:48:23,206
who ever had a funny accent?

746
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:24,707
Look in my eyes!

747
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,751
Push against my hands as hard as you can.

748
00:48:27,794 --> 00:48:29,003
Push, push!

749
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:30,129
Look at me!

750
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:33,091
Make the ugliest, grossest sound
you can. Come on!

751
00:48:33,174 --> 00:48:34,342
Ah!

752
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:35,468
Ah!

753
00:48:35,552 --> 00:48:36,594
Ah!

754
00:48:36,678 --> 00:48:37,720
Ah!

755
00:48:37,804 --> 00:48:38,888
No! Be a monster!

756
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:40,390
Ahhhh!

757
00:48:40,473 --> 00:48:42,684
AHHHH!

758
00:48:42,767 --> 00:48:44,018
AHH!

759
00:48:44,102 --> 00:48:45,270
Now sing at me!

760
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:47,939
<i>♪ I've looked at life ♪</i>

761
00:48:48,022 --> 00:48:50,400
<i>♪ From both sides now ♪</i>

762
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:52,819
<i>♪ From win and lose ♪</i>

763
00:48:52,902 --> 00:48:55,446
<i>♪ And still somehow ♪</i>

764
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,991
Yes! That's it.

765
00:48:58,074 --> 00:48:59,701
That's it!

766
00:48:59,784 --> 00:49:02,120
That's what I was waiting for. Hey!

767
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:06,249
Yes! Whoo!

768
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:09,669
- Give me a break!
- You guys raise the quotas every year.

769
00:49:09,752 --> 00:49:12,272
There used to be 100 boats in that harbor.
There must be 15 now.

770
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:14,733
Yeah, what are you doing?
Taking kickbacks from the government?

771
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:17,886
You want to control the fish, but you
don't know what's going on out there!

772
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:19,429
That's the point of the monitors!

773
00:49:19,512 --> 00:49:23,433
- Right, a snitch!
- Hey, settle down. Settle down!

774
00:49:23,516 --> 00:49:25,018
Let's be respectful.

775
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:27,145
We're out there to collect data!

776
00:49:27,228 --> 00:49:29,939
Yeah, well, your data is wrong, OK?

777
00:49:30,523 --> 00:49:31,774
Sorry.

778
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:33,318
You gotta interpret. I'm lost.

779
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:34,527
Oh, you've tested?

780
00:49:34,611 --> 00:49:37,405
Yeah! I see what's coming up
in my nets, you asshole.

781
00:49:39,073 --> 00:49:41,701
We understand that the observers

782
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:43,453
are a financial hardship.

783
00:49:43,536 --> 00:49:44,746
Oh, really?

784
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:47,123
But it's critical to protect the fishery.

785
00:49:47,957 --> 00:49:50,168
It's John's job to look out for the fish!

786
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:53,671
And as head of the council,
it's my job to look out for you!

787
00:49:53,755 --> 00:49:55,048
Bullshit!

788
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:57,508
Like hell it is.

789
00:49:57,592 --> 00:49:59,219
It's not the old days anymore.

790
00:49:59,302 --> 00:50:02,931
Everyone has to make some sacrifices here.

791
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:07,810
Guys, we're not the enemy here.

792
00:50:23,618 --> 00:50:24,702
"Suck my dick!"

793
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,666
That's from him, not me.

794
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:33,086
Got a problem, Frank?

795
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:43,054
"We're tired of this shit, Gio!"

796
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:44,305
Yeah!

797
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:47,058
"You don't care if these guys
regulate us to death..."

798
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:51,104
"'Cause you're the only one
making money here."

799
00:50:54,899 --> 00:50:57,193
"No one's getting paid
what their catch is worth."

800
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:03,241
"My dad fished and his dad.

801
00:51:04,325 --> 00:51:06,536
So I'm gonna fight like hell
to stay out on the water."

802
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:07,662
Yeah!

803
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,502
"Screw yourself!"

804
00:51:15,628 --> 00:51:17,088
"I'm done with the auction."

805
00:51:17,171 --> 00:51:19,883
Oh yeah?
What are you gonna do?

806
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:32,103
"We're gonna sell our own fish."

807
00:51:32,186 --> 00:51:34,480
Yeah.

808
00:51:34,564 --> 00:51:36,316
"Any of you wanna join us?"

809
00:51:36,399 --> 00:51:37,609
Hey, what is this?

810
00:51:41,738 --> 00:51:44,866
"You like giving this asshole
60% of your paycheck?"

811
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:49,495
"Bring us your catch,
and we'll double what you're getting now."

812
00:51:52,123 --> 00:51:53,166
Double it?

813
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,919
I have no idea.
It sounded good though, right?

814
00:51:58,796 --> 00:52:00,256
What?

815
00:52:03,134 --> 00:52:04,886
It just came out.

816
00:52:05,178 --> 00:52:06,262
I was in the moment.

817
00:52:06,346 --> 00:52:08,765
How would that even work?

818
00:52:09,098 --> 00:52:12,852
We get customers to sign up.
They buy fish right off the boat.

819
00:52:14,562 --> 00:52:18,942
Do you know how much work that is?
There are so many steps!

820
00:52:19,442 --> 00:52:21,194
I've looked into it.

821
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:24,614
There's no money for it.

822
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:27,033
You do our books.

823
00:52:27,116 --> 00:52:28,868
You could work with the other wives.

824
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,372
Those hearing bitches
want nothing to do with me.

825
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:35,291
Maybe if you didn't call them
"hearing bitches"?

826
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:37,418
And you! You hate people!

827
00:52:38,795 --> 00:52:40,880
We could finally be part
of this community.

828
00:52:41,548 --> 00:52:42,674
We have our community.

829
00:52:42,757 --> 00:52:43,925
Who?

830
00:52:44,008 --> 00:52:45,426
Your deaf friends?

831
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,136
You see them once a month.

832
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:50,932
What's the problem?
It's a great idea!

833
00:52:53,393 --> 00:52:55,895
We can't talk to these people.

I'm sorry. I'm gonna
have to call you back.

Shhh, shhh, shhh!

864
00:55:46,107 --> 00:55:48,526
That's the third time you're late!

865
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,278
It's only 20 minutes!

866
00:55:50,361 --> 00:55:52,071
I don't care if it's one minute!

867
00:55:52,155 --> 00:55:54,908
It shows me that you don't
respect me or my time.

868
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:56,367
I have a lot going on!

869
00:55:56,451 --> 00:55:58,036
Me too!
Me too!

870
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:01,080
I have a whole life
that has nothing to do with you.

871
00:56:01,164 --> 00:56:04,876
If you waste my time,
I will not work with you.

872
00:56:07,629 --> 00:56:08,671
OK?

873
00:56:08,755 --> 00:56:09,839
OK.

874
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,300
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

875
00:56:12,759 --> 00:56:14,093
It better not.

876
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:15,511
It won't.

877
00:56:15,595 --> 00:56:16,596
OK.

878
00:56:29,484 --> 00:56:31,903
You gonna avoid me until we graduate?

879
00:56:32,487 --> 00:56:35,698
I wasn't laughing at them
for being deaf, OK?

880
00:56:35,782 --> 00:56:36,991
It was the situation.

881
00:56:37,075 --> 00:56:38,076
OK.

882
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:41,663
Look, I know it's not an excuse,
but it sucks at my house right now,

883
00:56:41,746 --> 00:56:43,581
and you've got this,
like, perfect life, and..

884
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:45,083
What?

885
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,584
Your parents are madly in love.

886
00:56:46,668 --> 00:56:48,378
They can't keep their hands
off each other.

887
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:49,837
- And your house is..
- Disgusting.

888
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:51,422
My house is disgusting.

889
00:56:51,506 --> 00:56:53,341
It's not, OK?
It's a home.

890
00:56:53,424 --> 00:56:55,635
And you all work together and laugh.

891
00:56:55,718 --> 00:56:57,720
And my family's not like that.

892
00:56:57,804 --> 00:56:59,931
And then, I listen to you sing, and...

893
00:57:01,432 --> 00:57:03,810
I just do it 'cause it's expected from me.

894
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:07,480
You have no idea what it's like
to hear people laugh at your family.

895
00:57:08,106 --> 00:57:09,148
You're right. I don't.

896
00:57:09,232 --> 00:57:11,985
And have to protect them,
'cause they can't hear it, but I can.

897
00:57:12,068 --> 00:57:13,069
I know.

898
00:57:13,903 --> 00:57:16,114
I'm sorry, Ruby. I am.

899
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:21,286
I'm a dick.

900
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:25,039
Can I make it up to you? Please!

901
00:57:25,123 --> 00:57:27,876
I'll text you every few minutes
until you agree to hang out with me!

902
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:29,127
That's psychotic!

903
00:57:29,878 --> 00:57:31,838
OK, I will not do that!

904
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:34,799
I'm not gonna do that.

905
00:57:38,469 --> 00:57:40,221
These foodie people will eat anything now:

906
00:57:40,305 --> 00:57:43,099
Heads, tails, all sorts of garbage.

907
00:57:43,182 --> 00:57:45,685
Next thing you know,
fish dick's gonna be the new delicacy.

908
00:57:46,686 --> 00:57:47,770
Fish don't have dicks.

909
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,732
This is your last free batch, kid.

910
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:51,858
Yeah, I got you.

911
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:53,860
My fingers are falling off.

912
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:59,073
I can't fit all these in the car.

913
00:57:59,741 --> 00:58:01,075
We need a truck.

914
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:02,202
Ah!

915
00:58:02,285 --> 00:58:04,120
Where are you going?

916
00:58:04,537 --> 00:58:06,039
I have my music practice.

917
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:07,832
You can't go.

918
00:58:12,378 --> 00:58:13,463
What's this?

919
00:58:13,546 --> 00:58:15,381
The news!

920
00:58:15,465 --> 00:58:17,175
They're doing a story on the family!

921
00:58:18,509 --> 00:58:19,510
Now?

922
00:58:20,553 --> 00:58:21,679
I can't.

923
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,350
How are we gonna do the interview?

924
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:26,768
I can lip read.

925
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:28,228
You're not going to get all of it!

926
00:58:28,311 --> 00:58:29,312
This is important.

927
00:58:29,395 --> 00:58:30,730
My stuff is important too!

928
00:58:30,813 --> 00:58:31,981
Do it!

929
00:58:32,065 --> 00:58:33,900
I can't!

930
00:58:35,026 --> 00:58:36,903
You want us to fail?

931
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,543
Hi! You must be Jackie Rossi!

932
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:52,627
Chet Turner!

933
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:56,798
"Hopefully, people will support us

934
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:58,633
and will buy their fish here."

935
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:03,638
That's great!
So, how does this program work?

936
00:59:05,932 --> 00:59:09,602
Basically, the fishermen are
at the mercy of the big guys.

937
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,824
The goal is to sell fish
directly to the people.

938
00:59:49,183 --> 00:59:50,560
Mr. V!

939
00:59:52,604 --> 00:59:53,980
Mr. V!

940
01:00:28,514 --> 01:00:30,099
Is that yours?

941
01:00:37,649 --> 01:00:39,067
I'm sorry.

942
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:41,986
I want to do this.

943
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:48,117
I don't think so.

944
01:00:49,035 --> 01:00:50,495
Are you serious?

945
01:00:52,664 --> 01:00:54,207
You have no discipline.

946
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,876
You're late.
You're unprepared.

947
01:00:57,794 --> 01:00:59,587
You wouldn't last two days at Berklee.

948
01:01:00,922 --> 01:01:03,049
Out! Go!

949
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:06,928
Well, it's not like that school
did you any good.

950
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:14,894
You have, what, 17 years on this planet?

951
01:01:15,436 --> 01:01:16,771
You don't know shit.

952
01:01:17,438 --> 01:01:19,232
You want to know why I'm a teacher?

953
01:01:19,315 --> 01:01:21,109
I'm good at this.

954
01:01:21,192 --> 01:01:23,987
But I can't do my job unless you do yours.

955
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:26,781
And I certainly don't need
a lesson in failure

956
01:01:26,865 --> 01:01:29,742
from someone who's too afraid to even try.

957
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:41,296
I've never done anything
without my family before.

958
01:01:51,848 --> 01:01:54,017
I want to go to college.

959
01:01:54,684 --> 01:01:55,727
At Berklee.

960
01:01:58,187 --> 01:01:59,689
Music school.

961
01:02:01,316 --> 01:02:04,110
My teacher's been helping me
with my audition.

962
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:08,907
College? In Boston?

963
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:11,743
That city is full of assholes.

964
01:02:12,202 --> 01:02:13,494
So is everywhere.

965
01:02:13,953 --> 01:02:15,663
You can't go now.

966
01:02:15,747 --> 01:02:17,332
We just started the business.
With you!

967
01:02:17,415 --> 01:02:19,542
That's all you care about?

968
01:02:20,293 --> 01:02:22,503
Losing your free interpreter?

969
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:26,507
You're an important part of this.

970
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:28,885
It's terrible timing.

971
01:02:28,968 --> 01:02:31,804
There will never be a good time.

972
01:02:32,513 --> 01:02:35,642
I can't stay with you
for the rest of my life!

973
01:02:35,725 --> 01:02:39,938
Nobody expects that from you.

974
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:41,606
I...

975
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:45,193
have been interpreting my whole life.

976
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,781
This is exhausting.

977
01:02:53,785 --> 01:02:55,995
Singing is what I love.

978
01:02:57,956 --> 01:02:59,415
It's everything.

979
01:03:05,046 --> 01:03:06,798
Did you know about this?

980
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:18,434
We can't let her go.

981
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:21,479
It's college.

982
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:23,022
It's not.

983
01:03:23,106 --> 01:03:24,691
It's music school.

984
01:03:26,234 --> 01:03:29,529
And what if she can't sing?

985
01:03:30,572 --> 01:03:32,198
Maybe she's awful.

986
01:03:32,615 --> 01:03:33,950
She's not awful.

987
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:35,368
Really?
Have you heard her?

988
01:03:38,997 --> 01:03:41,332
I'm worried.
What if she fails?

989
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,501
I'm tired.

990
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:45,169
I don't wanna talk anymore.

991
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:54,345
What do we do if she gets in?

992
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:56,931
Then she's gone.

993
01:03:57,682 --> 01:03:59,392
Our baby's gone!

994
01:04:00,435 --> 01:04:02,103
She's not a baby.

995
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:03,187
She's my baby!

996
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:04,689
She was never a baby.

997
01:04:51,903 --> 01:04:52,904
Where is Ruby?

998
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,822
She's pissed.

999
01:04:54,906 --> 01:04:56,282
Yeah, but today?

1000
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:01,371
Is that the observer, seriously?

1001
01:05:02,997 --> 01:05:04,082
Hello!

1002
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:05,875
I should make her jump.

1003
01:05:08,211 --> 01:05:10,296
I'm Joanne Biles.
I'm your at-sea monitor.

1004
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,298
I'll be coming out with you today.

1005
01:05:19,138 --> 01:05:22,016
Could you help me with...
I don't think I can get across.

1006
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,226
Um...

1007
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,563
Thanks.

1008
01:05:40,076 --> 01:05:42,662
It feels like it could be
rough seas today!

1009
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:07,437
Should I throw her overboard?

1010
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:18,489
So, you gonna murder me?

1011
01:06:18,573 --> 01:06:20,074
I haven't decided.

1012
01:06:30,877 --> 01:06:32,086
Really?

1013
01:06:33,129 --> 01:06:34,130
No. No, no, no.

1014
01:06:34,214 --> 01:06:35,340
Just don't belly flop.

1015
01:06:40,637 --> 01:06:41,721
Whoo!

1016
01:06:42,472 --> 01:06:44,307
- Come on!
- Are you crazy?

1017
01:06:50,897 --> 01:06:51,940
That looks freezing.

1018
01:06:52,023 --> 01:06:53,441
Get in!

1019
01:06:54,776 --> 01:06:55,860
Clear!

1020
01:06:56,194 --> 01:06:58,571
Incoming! Whoa!

1021
01:07:00,907 --> 01:07:02,492
God, it's so cold!

1022
01:07:03,243 --> 01:07:04,827
Oh, it went up my nose!

1023
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:16,339
So, um, we good now?

1024
01:07:17,632 --> 01:07:18,550
Ah...

1025
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:20,343
After we do the barge.

1026
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,264
Which one's the barge?

1027
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,102
Wait, that's, like, 40 feet.

1028
01:07:29,185 --> 01:07:30,186
Yep!

1029
01:07:43,741 --> 01:07:46,536
Hey, is the engine regularly maintained?

1030
01:07:47,036 --> 01:07:49,455
When was the last time
that you had your engine checked?

1031
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:53,293
Yeah, it's loud.
That's why I'm asking.

1032
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,355
Him too?

1033
01:08:37,295 --> 01:08:39,047
Haven't kids, like, died doing this?

1034
01:08:39,505 --> 01:08:41,173
It'll definitely flip
your eyelids inside out

1035
01:08:41,174 --> 01:08:43,218
and give you the worst
wedgie of your life.

1036
01:08:43,301 --> 01:08:44,344
OK...

1037
01:08:45,553 --> 01:08:48,598
Your legs are gonna start
shaking, like, cartoon style.

1038
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:51,726
So jump fast to save yourself.

1039
01:08:52,227 --> 01:08:53,853
OK...

1040
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,690
Oh, and there's a branch sticking out
about halfway down, so jump out.

1041
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:00,610
You're really selling this.

1042
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:04,822
Is that poison ivy?

1043
01:09:09,244 --> 01:09:10,870
Holy shit!

1044
01:09:12,121 --> 01:09:13,164
OK...

1045
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,626
Should we leave a note

1046
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:18,711
in case people think it's a joint suicide?

1047
01:09:19,337 --> 01:09:20,964
Nah, let's keep 'em guessing.

1048
01:09:25,134 --> 01:09:27,804
Yeah, there's the shaky legs.

1049
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:32,183
OK.

1050
01:09:32,642 --> 01:09:34,561
One, two...

1051
01:09:34,644 --> 01:09:35,979
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1052
01:09:36,729 --> 01:09:37,981
Three! Saving myself!

1053
01:09:38,064 --> 01:09:39,649
Ahh!

1054
01:09:39,732 --> 01:09:40,817
Ah!

1055
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,027
No! Whoo!

1056
01:09:44,404 --> 01:09:45,697
Whoo!

1057
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:47,615
- Ah!
- Yeah! That hurt.

1058
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:49,742
Ow!

1059
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,251
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1060
01:09:58,334 --> 01:10:00,336
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.
Coast guard.

1061
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,964

Channel 16, over.

01:10:05,466 --> 01:10:07,969
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1063
01:10:08,052 --> 01:10:10,889
Coast guard.

1064
01:10:10,972 --> 01:10:13,600
Channel 16.
Come in. Over.

1065
01:10:20,565 --> 01:10:22,942
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1066

Coast guard.

1067
01:10:26,112 --> 01:10:27,989
Come in. Over.

01:10:30,116 --> 01:10:32,994
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1069
01:10:33,077 --> 01:10:35,371
Coast guard 25.
You are in violation of...

1070
01:10:43,421 --> 01:10:44,589
You, sir! Sir, stand up!

1071
01:10:44,672 --> 01:10:47,425
Drop the pick. Stand up!
Stand up! What's going on here?

1072
01:10:47,508 --> 01:10:49,844
Why is no one answering the radio?

1073
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:15,537
Nailed it.

1074
01:11:17,789 --> 01:11:18,915
No!

1075
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,710
- No!
- No, no!

1076
01:11:25,088 --> 01:11:26,464
Check it out!

1077
01:11:29,175 --> 01:11:30,301
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1078
01:11:41,145 --> 01:11:42,438
Yeah! No!

1079
01:12:33,573 --> 01:12:34,574
What happened?

1080
01:12:36,034 --> 01:12:38,161
You didn't come to work.

1081
01:12:38,244 --> 01:12:40,079
We're done fishing.

1082
01:12:40,163 --> 01:12:41,998
They suspended my license.

1083
01:12:43,082 --> 01:12:44,250
Who?

1084
01:12:45,043 --> 01:12:46,044
Coasties.

1085
01:12:46,127 --> 01:12:49,255
The observer saw we were deaf
and tipped them off.

1086
01:12:49,672 --> 01:12:51,549
Well, they can't do that.

1087
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,426
We were just working

1088
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:56,429
and they came to board us.
We didn't know.

1089
01:12:56,512 --> 01:12:57,639
I told you.

1090
01:12:57,722 --> 01:12:58,890
You need a hearing deckhand.

1091
01:13:00,099 --> 01:13:01,559
Yeah, that's you!

1092
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:02,685
You were that person!

1093
01:13:02,769 --> 01:13:04,979
I can't always be that person!

1094
01:13:05,438 --> 01:13:07,315
She's right.
We need another guy.

1095
01:13:07,398 --> 01:13:08,566
We can't afford it!

1096
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:13,780
If you'd told me you weren't coming,

1097
01:13:13,863 --> 01:13:16,241
I'd have figured something out.
But you didn't.

1098
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,868
You're seriously blaming me?

1099
01:13:19,702 --> 01:13:21,704
Your father was counting on you.

1100
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:28,586
No. Don't put this on me.

1101
01:13:30,922 --> 01:13:33,007
It's not my fault.

1102
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:43,059
You failed to obey an order
by federal law enforcement

1103
01:13:43,142 --> 01:13:44,769
to board your vessel.

1104
01:13:45,353 --> 01:13:48,314
On top of that,
you were operating your vessel

1105
01:13:48,398 --> 01:13:51,109
in a negligent and dangerous manner

1106
01:13:51,192 --> 01:13:53,903
due to your... disability.

1107
01:13:55,405 --> 01:14:00,618
I have no choice but to administer
the minimum fine, which is $1,000,

1108
01:14:01,077 --> 01:14:05,206
and an additional penalty of $1,500.

1109
01:14:10,128 --> 01:14:14,716
We can't pay that unless
we can get back on the water.

1110
01:14:15,383 --> 01:14:17,927
Officer, what do they need
to do to be able to fish again?

1111
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:22,724
You will be required
to have a hearing individual

1112
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:25,310
on board at all times

1113
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:29,230
to answer radios,
hear ship whistles, etcetera.

1114
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:33,902
We will be monitoring you regularly
to make sure you are in compliance.

1115
01:14:34,986 --> 01:14:36,863
Do you have that person?

1116
01:14:59,177 --> 01:15:01,429
I'll sell the boat.

1117
01:15:01,512 --> 01:15:05,600
Take the money we can.
That'll be that.

1118
01:15:06,559 --> 01:15:07,810
It's fine.

1119
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:09,938
I'll stay.

1120
01:15:11,105 --> 01:15:13,274
I'll work with you on the boat.

1121
01:15:13,358 --> 01:15:14,901
No!

1122
01:15:14,984 --> 01:15:16,027
Yes.

1123
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:18,154
We can't afford to pay someone else.

1124
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,159
And there's nobody that's
gonna know how to sign.

1125
01:15:24,827 --> 01:15:26,162
Are you sure?

1126
01:15:26,829 --> 01:15:28,540
School can wait.

1127
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:32,544
I already decided.

1128
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,421
I'm excited.

1129
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:42,428
Oh, Saint Ruby!

1130
01:15:42,512 --> 01:15:44,722
We'll make a shrine to you on the boat.

1131
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:45,807
Wait!

1132
01:15:45,848 --> 01:15:46,849
She's trying to help!

1133
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,018
Well, thank God you have her.

1134
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:16,129
Don't kill me.

1135
01:16:17,881 --> 01:16:23,803
I bought you a red dress for your concert.

1136
01:16:29,475 --> 01:16:32,145
If you don't like it,
you don't have to wear it.

1137
01:16:36,941 --> 01:16:39,694
I'm really glad you're staying.

1138
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:43,948
Leo isn't.

1139
01:16:44,949 --> 01:16:46,284
It's complicated.

1140
01:16:46,618 --> 01:16:47,952
He feels...

1141
01:16:48,661 --> 01:16:49,787
left out.

1142
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:52,165
That's crazy.

1143
01:16:53,499 --> 01:16:55,919
It's always the three of you

1144
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:57,212
and then me.

1145
01:17:00,715 --> 01:17:02,342
I get it.

1146
01:17:12,268 --> 01:17:15,980
Do you ever wish I was deaf?

1147
01:17:29,285 --> 01:17:32,789
When you were born, at the hospital,

1148
01:17:33,998 --> 01:17:36,668
they gave you a hearing test.

1149
01:17:38,294 --> 01:17:42,632
And there you were, so tiny and sweet,

1150
01:17:44,551 --> 01:17:47,428
with these electrodes all over you.

1151
01:17:49,389 --> 01:17:51,891
And I...

1152
01:17:52,684 --> 01:17:55,728
prayed that you would be deaf.

1153
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,900
When they told us

1154
01:18:00,984 --> 01:18:02,694
that you were hearing,

1155
01:18:03,903 --> 01:18:05,446
I felt...

1156
01:18:06,656 --> 01:18:08,741
My heart sank.

1157
01:18:08,825 --> 01:18:09,993
Why?

1158
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:14,372
I was worried that we wouldn't connect.

1159
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:17,083
Like me and my mom,

1160
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:18,668
we're not close.

1161
01:18:20,086 --> 01:18:23,089
I thought I would fail you.

1162
01:18:23,756 --> 01:18:26,634
That being deaf would make me a bad mom.

1163
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,141
Don't worry.

1164
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:35,435
You are a bad mom

1165
01:18:36,185 --> 01:18:38,313
for so many other reasons.

1166
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,028
I know I drive you crazy

1167
01:18:45,111 --> 01:18:47,780
with the clothes, the makeup.

1168
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:56,831
But honestly,

1169
01:18:56,915 --> 01:19:00,376
I'm happy that you know who you are.

1170
01:19:03,129 --> 01:19:04,631
You're brave.

1171
01:19:05,089 --> 01:19:06,674
Not like me.

1172
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:19,229
Mmm!

1173
01:19:51,761 --> 01:19:52,845
Get lost.

1174
01:19:53,513 --> 01:19:54,597
You hiding?

1175
01:19:55,598 --> 01:19:57,475
Not very well.

1176
01:20:02,313 --> 01:20:03,314
You still mad at me?

1177
01:20:05,149 --> 01:20:07,151
You can't fish full-time.

1178
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,236
Why not?

1179
01:20:10,655 --> 01:20:12,156
Gertie told me

1180
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,075
that you can really sing.

1181
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:16,411
That's special.

1182
01:20:17,495 --> 01:20:19,080
You can't stay here.

1183
01:20:19,706 --> 01:20:22,834
They'll keep looking to you
for everything.

1184
01:20:22,917 --> 01:20:24,919
What else am I supposed to do?

1185
01:20:26,045 --> 01:20:27,213
Let me do this!

1186
01:20:27,297 --> 01:20:28,506
I got this!

1187
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,341
I'm the older brother.

1188
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,343
And I get treated like a baby.

1189
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,929
I haven't been able to do a thing
with Fresh Catch!

1190
01:20:35,013 --> 01:20:37,015
Because it all involves
talking to hearing people!

1191
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:38,975
So what? Who cares!

1192
01:20:39,058 --> 01:20:42,020
You're so afraid that we'd look stupid.

1193
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:44,731
Let them figure out how to deal
with deaf people!

1194
01:20:45,231 --> 01:20:47,942
We're not helpless.

1195
01:20:50,862 --> 01:20:54,532
Our family was fine before you were born.

1196
01:20:58,244 --> 01:20:59,621
Go.

1197
01:21:09,839 --> 01:21:12,800
Come on. This is...
We're not at Fenway.

1198
01:21:25,021 --> 01:21:27,941
OK, guys, you must be ready
to walk onstage in two minutes,

1199
01:21:28,024 --> 01:21:30,068
or you're not performing, OK?

1200
01:21:34,948 --> 01:21:36,366
Ruby.

1201
01:21:42,205 --> 01:21:44,290
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

1202
01:21:44,374 --> 01:21:46,334
For those of you who don't know,

1203
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:49,546
I'm Bernardo Villalobos, the choir master.

1204
01:21:50,046 --> 01:21:51,172
Can you read his lips?

1205
01:21:51,256 --> 01:21:52,775
Most of these kids
call me Mr. V to my face.

1206
01:21:52,799 --> 01:21:53,841
Not really.

1207
01:21:54,551 --> 01:21:56,594
I don't know what they
call me behind my back.

1208
01:21:58,012 --> 01:21:59,240
But I'm very proud of this group.

1209
01:21:59,264 --> 01:22:01,307
They laughed.

1210
01:22:01,391 --> 01:22:02,767
They worked very hard.

1211
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:07,939
So I will shut up now
and let you see your children,

1212
01:22:08,022 --> 01:22:09,691

Sometimes, you hear a voice, and
it reminds you to keep making music.

1253
01:25:24,135 --> 01:25:26,846
First song done, second song done.

1254
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:31,434
Please welcome Miles Patterson

1267
01:27:51,991 --> 01:27:55,203
Ah! Hey, Ruby!
That was so lovely!

1268
01:27:55,286 --> 01:27:56,287
- Oh!
- Thanks!

1269
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:57,705
Bob!

1270
01:27:59,499 --> 01:28:01,042
Great job!
Great, great job!

1271
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,293
Thank you.

1272
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:03,878
Are these your parents?

1273
01:28:03,962 --> 01:28:06,881
Yeah, Frank and Jackie.
And this is my brother, Leo.

1274
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:12,845
This is my teacher, Mr. V.
And his family.

1275
01:28:12,929 --> 01:28:14,013
Um...

1276
01:28:15,139 --> 01:28:16,307
Nice to fuck you.

1277
01:28:17,976 --> 01:28:19,435
I learned that on YouTube.

1278
01:28:19,519 --> 01:28:20,979
Oh.

1279
01:28:23,147 --> 01:28:26,359
What? Isn't that,
"Nice to meet you"?

1280
01:28:27,151 --> 01:28:28,152
No.

1281
01:28:28,945 --> 01:28:33,116
"Meet" is one finger, not two.
See? This is, like, the legs.

1282
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,284
No!

1283
01:28:34,367 --> 01:28:35,618
No, no, no!
I mean...

1284
01:28:35,702 --> 01:28:37,036
Oh my God!

1285
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,621
It's fine. I get it.

1286
01:28:39,664 --> 01:28:41,583
Nice to screw you too.

1287
01:28:45,378 --> 01:28:47,130
These are my kind of parents.

1288
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:50,049
Please tell them:

1289
01:28:50,133 --> 01:28:52,302
"Their daughter is very talented."

1290
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:57,307
"And they're making a terrible mistake
not sending her off to school."

1291
01:28:58,516 --> 01:29:00,185
I'll just sign the first part.

1292
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:03,521
I'm meeting Miles at his audition tomorrow.
You still have your slot.

1293
01:29:03,605 --> 01:29:05,481
- What is he saying?
- You have to stop.

1294
01:29:05,565 --> 01:29:07,150
OK, OK.

1295
01:29:07,233 --> 01:29:08,985
But thank you.

1296
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,390
I'm gonna get some air.

1297
01:29:39,933 --> 01:29:41,059
Okay.

1298
01:29:53,446 --> 01:29:55,365
What's up?

1299
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:58,868
Just thinking.

1300
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:06,793
The stars here,

1301
01:30:06,876 --> 01:30:11,798
they don't look as good as
they do on the water.

1302
01:30:26,604 --> 01:30:31,985
The song you sang tonight.
What was it about?

1303
01:30:38,449 --> 01:30:40,493
It was about...

1304
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:45,623
what it is to need another person.

1305
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:52,797
Can you sing it for me?

1306
01:30:53,798 --> 01:30:55,008
Now?

1307
01:30:55,091 --> 01:30:56,676

You guys, this is ridiculous!

1330
01:33:16,983 --> 01:33:20,987
If we're kicking you out,
we're all doing it as a family.

1331
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:46,471
Maybe over there?

1332
01:34:03,696 --> 01:34:05,406
I'm gonna park.

1333
01:34:13,122 --> 01:34:15,166
Look how they're dressed.

1334
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,793
It's so different.

1335
01:34:17,377 --> 01:34:19,837
It's fine.
You look pretty.

1336
01:34:21,297 --> 01:34:22,799
Hey! I'm here for my audition.

1337
01:34:22,882 --> 01:34:23,800
OK! What's your name?

1338
01:34:23,883 --> 01:34:25,385
Ruby Rossi.

1339
01:34:26,803 --> 01:34:29,222
Oh, it looks like you're
about half an hour late.

1340
01:34:29,305 --> 01:34:30,723
Are you ready to go?

1341
01:34:33,393 --> 01:34:34,894
We roll deep.

1342
01:34:35,228 --> 01:34:37,272
I'm sorry. Your family
can't go in with you.

1343
01:34:38,523 --> 01:34:39,899
What did she say?

1344
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,860
You can't go in.

1345
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:53,788
Ruby!

1346
01:34:53,872 --> 01:34:54,873
Hey!

1347
01:34:54,956 --> 01:34:55,832
You came!

1348
01:34:55,915 --> 01:34:57,083
Is Mr. V here?

1349
01:34:57,166 --> 01:34:59,627
Uh, he just left.
I can call him.

1350
01:34:59,711 --> 01:35:02,130
I texted him. How did it go?

1351
01:35:03,756 --> 01:35:05,300
I choked.

1352
01:35:05,383 --> 01:35:06,426
What?

1353
01:35:06,509 --> 01:35:07,927
Ruby Rossi?

1354
01:35:22,233 --> 01:35:23,651
Hello there!

1355
01:35:23,735 --> 01:35:24,777
Hi.

1356
01:35:25,403 --> 01:35:27,155
You are...

1357
01:35:27,238 --> 01:35:29,657
Ruby. Ruby Rossi.

1358
01:35:31,618 --> 01:35:33,411
OK, Ruby Rossi.

1359
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:36,122
Um, looking at your application,

1360
01:35:36,206 --> 01:35:38,875
aside from your involvement
in the school choir

1361
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:42,795
and a very nice letter
from Bernardo Villalobos,

1362
01:35:43,379 --> 01:35:46,132
you don't have a lot
of history with music.

1363
01:35:51,387 --> 01:35:53,515
I don't under.. Is there a question?

1364
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:07,487
Let's go upstairs.

1365
01:36:18,081 --> 01:36:20,375
What is your first song today?

1366
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:22,961
Both Sides, Now by Joni Mitchell.

1367
01:36:23,044 --> 01:36:24,712
Do you have your sheet music?

1368
01:36:27,966 --> 01:36:30,009
I don't. I forgot.

1369
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,597
Do you know that song?

1370
01:36:36,182 --> 01:36:39,269
All right. You are just going
to have to sing it a cappella.

1371
01:36:41,938 --> 01:36:43,022
Oh, OK.

1372
01:36:44,941 --> 01:36:46,776
I can accompany her.

1373
01:36:48,236 --> 01:36:50,488
Sorry for interrupting. Hi!

1374
01:36:51,614 --> 01:36:52,824

1375
01:36:52,907 --> 01:36:56,828

1431
01:42:36,417 --> 01:42:38,127
Visit me in Boston?

1432
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:43,383
I don't know.

1433
01:42:43,466 --> 01:42:46,177
You know, you're probably gonna
run off with some cello player

1434
01:42:46,261 --> 01:42:47,679
who wears a fedora.

1435
01:42:49,597 --> 01:42:51,182
Yeah, probably.

1436
01:43:08,992 --> 01:43:09,993
Ready?

1437
01:43:10,076 --> 01:43:11,536
Ready.

1438
01:43:14,205 --> 01:43:15,290
All right!

1439
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:20,795
Three, two, one...

1440
01:43:26,301 --> 01:43:27,427
- Ow!
- Ow!

1441
01:43:30,805 --> 01:43:32,932
You sure you don't want us to come?

1442
01:43:33,016 --> 01:43:36,352
- We can help set up your dorm room?
- No, no! Let's not make this a thing.

1443
01:43:41,524 --> 01:43:43,860
Bye-bye, ass monkey.

1444
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,070
Bye, shit nugget.

1445
01:44:00,293 --> 01:44:01,294
Stop...

1446
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:33,910
Wait, wait, wait!
Stop, stop!

1447
01:45:03,606 --> 01:45:04,732
Go!
