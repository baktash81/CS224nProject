- "Glowing"?

121
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,429
Why is she glowing?

122
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,386

She doesn't know what love is.

177
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,783
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna be late, sweetie.

178
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,697
I forgot to tell you
that, uh, I invited

179
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,102
- your mother to the wedding.
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,288
Oh, and...

181
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,044
and Heather's not wearing
the white dress.

182
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,671
She's gone with the oyster one
with the pearls.

183
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,129
Oh, sh... Oh.

184
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,043
Oh, you can go, Akiko.

185
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,615
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, that's right-right...

186
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,005
Right there, honey.

187
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,800
Oh, Moondog.

188
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,514
It's so nice of 'Rie to let us
have the wedding at his place.

189
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,394
He's really pulled out
all the stops.

190
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,725
The Lingerie Doggy Dogg.

191
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,061
He got ordained
just for the event.

192
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,975
Dearly beloved...

193
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,735
No, I wouldn't say that shit
like that.

194
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,942
Players and playettes.

195
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,702
Today, we have this man
coming for this woman.

196
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,238
Bitch, now, you know you're
too young to be married, right?

197
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,452
You got a lot
of living to do, baby.

198
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,708
Ain't nobody even made

199
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,085
your little pink tweeter
squirt yet, huh?

200
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,398
You need to settle down
somewhere

201
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,129
and run for
the motherfucking hills.

202
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,712
Shit, I got sidetracked
for a minute.

203
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,461
Fuck!

204
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,379
You know, it breaks
my heart, Moondog.

205
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,720
It breaks my heart 'cause you
a motherfucking has-been, boy.

206
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,306
Whatever the fuck
that is. Is that a bad thing?

207
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,346
Goddamn,
it's a bad thing, Moondog.

208
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,390
As you're forever aging,
I feel obliged

209
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,433
to be truthful with you
at all times.

210
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,193
- Hey, you're a shitty agent.
- It's sad, Moondog.

211
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,776
You used to be a motherfucking
ATM for me, boy.

212
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,738
You have pissed away your talent
on women and booze

213
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,743
and total excess.

214
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,950
Now you're talking.
Yeah, all those things,

215
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,412
that's what feeds the juices up
here in my noggin, man.

216
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,825
Through my loins,
up the autobahn.

217
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,539
My spirit and mind, man.

218
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,125
I-I'm... I'm moist right now.
I'm lubricated.

219
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,756
Yeah, but you the fastest horse
in my stable, boy.

220
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,793
You think I want to take
a motherfucking shotgun,

221
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,711
put it in your mouth,
blow your brains

222
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,379
all over my nice
motherfucking clothes?

223
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,799
That's the fucking Lewis
I'm talking about.

224
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,592
You think I want to do that?

225
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,977
You was a revolutionary writer.

226
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,264
You were a radical.

227
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,603
Your words meant
something to people.

228
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,813
Either way, it's a good thing
I'm rich, Lewis.

229
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,649
Especially since I'm well hung.

230
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,404
You ain't rich, Moondog.

231
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,190
Your wife's rich.

232
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,483
That's true.

233
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,572
And it's been a while
since I had you in there,

234
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,906
but you ain't well hung, boy!

235
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,117
- Get in there. Get in there.
- You ain't well hung!

236
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,328
- Get in there. Come on.
- I mean, goddamn. God...

237
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,459
San Francisco standoff, baby?

238
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,792
Oh!

239
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,818
I read in The Pelican today
Heather's getting married.

240
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,208
It's a big day.

241
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,593
Yeah. This afternoon,
handing her off.

242
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,969
Well, congratulations.

243
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,676
And you know what?
I worked through it.

244
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,590
And I'm not even upset
even a little bit

245
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,804
that I was not included
in the ceremonies.

246
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,594
Oh, you thought
you'd be included?

247
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,729
No, well, I-I... like I said,

248
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,313
I-I'm busy anyway, so like
I said, I'm-I'm not offended.

249
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,104
And-and I just want to be clear,
this doesn't have to do, uh...

250
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,734
Oh, when you walked in on her,
saw that...

251
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,764
- I didn't know she was changing.
- She said you stayed

252
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,245
a little longer
than a few seconds.

253
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,325
Well...

254
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,491
I used to mix signals back then.

255
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,829
Hey, man.
- It was a... it-it was a confusing time.

256
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,790
I would misread
things often, and...

257
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,455
Whatever raises your skirt, man.
It never bothered me.

258
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,091
Well, I'm busy regardless,
so I-I could not attend

259
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,752
even if you...
if people had a change of heart.

260
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,469
I-I'm-I'm-I'm...
have other obligations.

261
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,304
- Sweet-ass, man.
- Yeah.

262
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,163
Hey, here's your ball, man.
Let's knock this fucker

263
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,040
back on the fairway and get a good lie.
- Yeah.

264
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,525
- Name is?
- Shardanne.

265
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,606
Now, how does that
say "Shardanne"

266
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,479
all the way up
the middle of your thigh?

267
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,194
You know what my horoscope said?

268
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,199
"Don't play with matches."

269
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:15,363
You don't have to, 'cause
the fire's already lit, sweetie.

270
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,327
Little veils behind...

271
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,083
And you got a lot of great
things going on all over

272
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,495
- your B-O-D-Y right now.
- Mm.

273
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,709
- I got leopard.
- Leopard?

274
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,841
- Yeah.

- Moondog. Where are you?
- Hey.

293
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,693
Yeah. Yeah.

294
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,215
Oh, hey, hey, baby.
Uh, right around the corner.

295
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,071
Finished up a little yoga class.

296
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,948
A little downward doggystyle.

297
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,387
You are gonna miss
our daughter's wedding.

298
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,199
No, I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

299
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,455
Uh, look, I'm right around
the corner, honey.

300
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,622
The limp-dick groom
is melting down.

301
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,041
Okay, well, hurry up, please.

302
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,004
- I love you, baby.
- You're stressing me.

303
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,114
- I'm on my way!
- Okay, because the wedding is starting.

304
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,802
Lingerie? Let's hit it, baby.

305
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,433
Love between a boy and a girl
can be so wonderful.

306
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,435
Especially when it's a girl
that I've known

307
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,016
ever since she was born.

308
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,148
- Aw.
- Heather, you know I love you

309
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,979
and I love your family,
and I'm so happy

310
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,518
to see you get married today.

311
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,527
To him.

312
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,438
And you got to be ready
to take on everything

313
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,718
that she stands for,
and that includes her...

314
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,823
What are you doing?

315
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,554
- You're going too fast.
- What the...?

316
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,661
Bye, Mom.

317
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,492
Whoa! No!

318
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,328
- Oh!
- Damn, Dog!

319
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,584
I'm just kidding, sweetie.
That's not my mom.

320
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,210
You know that. Mm. How are you?

321
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,212
- Good. I...
- Hey, can I borrow that, Linge'?

322
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,623
- Sir, yes, sir.
- All right, see,

323
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,632
everyone knows this
is my daughter.

324
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,088
Me and my Minnie-boo's daughter.

325
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,923
Aw.

326
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,075
And we're gonna be handing away
the bride to be, right now,

327
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,012
- a little family tradition we got before we...
- Hi.

328
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,892
...hand over any daughters
in our family.

329
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,348
We just got to...

330
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,480
- Wait.
- ...lightly check the package.

331
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,187
- What are you doing?
- The other side. That's not bad.

332
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,022
Like five inches flaccid.

333
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,027
Ah, Mr. 'Rie, your mic, sir.

334
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,029
Thank you.
Pardon the interruption.

335
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,052
I would like to thank Mr.
Moondog for that presentation.

336
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:02,078
Today, dearly beloved,
we come together

337
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,662
to give Heather to Mr. Limpy.

338
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,202
You in a world of motherfucking
problems with this family.

339
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,836
They fucked-up.

340
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,069
Is that the
motherfucking Moondog?

341
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,336
The one and only Palmia,
Lingerie.

342
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,300
Moondog, be careful.

343
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,931
This here,
I can't even explain it, man.

344
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,968
This is sort of kind of like
a hallucinogenic.

345
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,478
- Yeah, you see...
- You gonna see all kind of shit, man.

346
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,307
- for 16 weeks?
- Uh-huh.

347
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,646
This is that thing.

348
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,278
Wait, wait, wait.
Be careful, Dog.

349
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,191
You about to go to a place
you never been before.

350
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,325
That shit don't come
with seat belts.

351
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,860
He almost ruined the whole day.

352
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,278
Don't say that.

353
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,414
No, it was fun.

354
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,495
- He's fucked-up, Mom.
- Ah...

355
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,502
- It's just Moondog.
- Don't make excuses for him.

356
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,129
You just kind of have
to accept that he's...

357
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,837
he's from another dimension.
He really is.

358
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,502
And you have to love him for it.
I do.

359
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,591
You and Limp-Dick are gonna
have to accept that.

360
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,971
No, but I do think Moondog's
mother coddled him way too much.

361
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,510
I've told her this before.
I mean,

362
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,933
he wore a diaper
until he was eight.

363
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,268
Honestly, I think she put brandy
in his little bottle.

364
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,276
Man, my nu... ah... my nuts
are throbbing right now.

365
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,488
First time I hit this shit,
nigga went in a coma.

366
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,528
I forgot how
to motherfucking breathe.

367
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,914
- What you see?
- 15 lights and 39 ladies.

368
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,997
What about those cartoons
right there? Can you see 'em?

369
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,837
Are we looking
at the same screen?

370
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,345
Are you sleeping with Lingerie?

371
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,177
Yes, yes.

372
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,091
And he's a wonderful lover.

373
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,805
Does Dad know?

374
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,845
Your father
wouldn't mind, darling.

375
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,480
Your father goes away.
You know, 'Rie is...

376
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,562
Whoa.

377
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,815
Um, I think it was just
'Rie's been there.

378
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,779
I mean, at your third birthday,

379
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,320
it was 'Rie
who brought the pony in.

380
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,329
I remember.

381
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,934
- And he blew out my candles.
- Exactly.

382
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,951
Well, he was stoned.

383
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,602
What's happening down here, cap?

384
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,291
Just fuck with me
one time, Dog.

385
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,628
You gonna love this. Slide in
where you ride in, Dog.

386
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,714
What the fuck?

387
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,846
Moondog, welcome
to the NASA Command Center

388
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,722
of Mary Jane.

389
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,555
This shit only grows

390
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,890
in an isolated pond in Jamaica.

391
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:36,309
It sprouts out of
a pink fluorescent moss patch.

392
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,101
Pink fluorescent?

393
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,316
Mm, mm, mm.

394
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,946
This weed here, it's so good,

395
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,984
it could make a motherfucker
yearn for the afterlife.

396
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,698
It could send you to
the outer limits of humanity.

397
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,912
That's the keys and the trees
to my success.

398
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,497
'Cause once a year,
I fly to Jamaica,

399
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,502
They turn their cheek this way,
and we fly off that way.

400
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,762
- Get out.
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,306
You don't remember
this, but the day you were born

402
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,346
and you came out
of your mother's womb,

403
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,857
I was there between your legs,
and your head came out

404
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,859
nice and smooth,
with guts all over it.

405
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,941
And it was a bloody mess,
but it was poetry.

406
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,855
Aw.
- - I saw your face,

407
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:27,197
but I didn't quite see your eyes
until I stuck my pinky finger

408
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,203
in this, like, placenta veil and
peeled it back over your face

409
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,204
and there you were.

410
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,912
And that's when I put my hands
on both sides of your head

411
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,326
and escorted you
into this world.

412
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,960
Aw.

413
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,247
I want to say...

414
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,211
What's your name again?
For real.

415
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,421
- Frank.
- Frank.

416
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,929
- Franky B.
- Now...

417
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,010
I give you my daughter
to put your hands

418
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,925
and take her into
the rest of the world.

419
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,343
- Aw.
- Thank you.

420
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,557
Beautiful.

421
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,726
Love you.

422
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,620
Oh, shit.

423
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,297
In the dusk, you see...
you see that woman?

424
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,877
She's singing to us.

425
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:28,296
Calling us back over the...
vistas of our past

426
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,886
right back to the child
who huddles under the piano.

427
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:36,975
He's sitting there with the boom
of the tingling strings.

428
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,639
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's got his hand...

429
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,308
he's got his hand on it.

430
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,149
On the foot of his mother.

431
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:50,283
And she smiles as she sings.

432
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:55,743
And in spite of myself,
the insidious mastery of song

433
00:22:55,791 --> 00:23:00,035
has betrayed me back once again,

434
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,830
till the heart of me...

435
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,169
...where I weep to belong.

436
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,256
Oh.

437
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,345
That is the most brilliant shit
I've ever heard.

438
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,260
You wrote that?

439
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,647
- Yeah, I did.
- That is some wild shit, Dog.

440
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:28,063
Glad you like it, man. I wrote
that in my younger years.

441
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,981
Whew.

442
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,034
Actually, a guy named
D.H. Lawrence wrote it,

443
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,790
all right, but I stole it
and plagiarized it

444
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,078
in my seventh grade
poetry contest, and guess what.

445
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,667
I won that motherfucker.

446
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,302
- Moondog, you my motherfucker.
- Hey, hey.

447
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,385
Family and friends,

448
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,222
thank you for coming and sharing
this perfect day with us.

449
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,512
This day has been
off the hook, am I right?

450
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,475
And, Heather, you're my angel.

451
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,769
Thanks.

452
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,849
Where have you been?

453
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,135
Waiting for you.

454
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,144
Have you seen Moondog, darling?

455
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,351
No, I haven't,
but what I do know is

456
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,642
when I don't see him,
and I see you,

457
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,981

one always knows, right?

They don't even have
an explanation.

503
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,750

you probably just know, right?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

509
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,851

darling.

00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:28,121
You're fucking stunning.

513
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,202
God was having
a good fucking day

514
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,994
when he made the Minnie-boo,
huh, didn't he?

515
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,255
I think it's their anniversary,
and if it's not, it ought to be.

516
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,086
Oh, happy anniversary.

517
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,756
Sweetie, don't be insincere
with strangers.

518
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,261
It doesn't look good on you.

519
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,673
- Let's go driving!
- You want to go driving?

520
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,842
- Let's go.
- Let me grab my beer.

521
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:53,104

Watch it.

575
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,725
- Got it?
- Yep.

576
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,137
Airbag deployed.
Possible chest trauma.

577
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,558
Jesse, pull her in place,
please.

578
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,851
Trauma Two's been prepped.

579
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,566
Hold door.

580
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,821
Trauma Two.

581
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,402
Watch yourselves.
Coming through.

582
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,317
Pull her in place, please.

583
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,689
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

584
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,860
Stay there.

585
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,024
Aw.

586
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,034
Mmm, boop, boop, boop, mmm.

587
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,497
What do you want to do?

588
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,630
- I...
- What do you want to do?

589
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,211
You're such a fuckup.

590
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,102
Mm...

591
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,646
Aw, Minnie-boo.

592
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,287
And through Almighty God,
we commend the soul

593
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,000
of our departed sister,

594
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,836
and we commit her body
to the ground.

595
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,002
Earth to earth. Ashes to ashes.

596
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,091
Dust to dust.

597
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,224
Minnie was a fine woman,
and we, her family and friends,

598
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,477
are blessed to have known her.

599
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,433
In the fullness of time,

600
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,723
and with the help
of the good Lord,

601
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,188
we shall all be with her again.

602
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,943
Until that time,

603
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:36,402
may the blessings
of God Almighty, the Father...

604
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,670
How you doing, honey?

605
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,679
- I'm okay.
- Mm.

606
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:04,058
I'm okay. How are you?

607
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,155
"When I was born,
I was happy.

608
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,566
I was born on the ocean
in a gigantic boat."

609
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,860
Big fuckin' boat.

610
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,618
"My parents were fishermen.

611
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,201
"Both were great
long-distance runners.

612
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,662
"I was read to as a child,

613
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,999
"mostly books about
survival and contortion.

614
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,004
"I drank off the teats
of caribou.

615
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,167
"Scrumptious. Tasted like
jasmine and cupcakes.

616
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,756
- 'Cause I remember..."
- Fuckin' good, Moondog.

617
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,170
"I lived through several wars.

618
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,338
"They were never fun.

619
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,756
"Why? 'Cause I was shot at.

620
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,470
"But I fuckin' returned fire.

621
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,009
"I wrote letters to loved ones.

622
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,331
"I memorized winter haiku.

623
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,766
"I played games with myself.

624
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,806
"Counted the lily pads.
Stared in the mirror.

625
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:56,068
I did what I had to do...
to keep going."

626
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,320
- Damn, I was good, man.
- "I made sandwiches.

627
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,822
"I played the dance.
It was hot.

628
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,108
"It was dry.
It was raining, it was not.

629
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,040
I was fluent in all things
dealing with nature."

630
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,950
That's great poetry.

631
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,221
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

632
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:28,305
Come on,
what's "nothing" mean, huh?

633
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,594
Nothing.
That's what it means.

634
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,059
Not a single cent until...

635
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,144
Till what?

636
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,980
You got to publish your novel,
or you get nothing.

637
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,281
Uh...

638
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,443
Minnie always had a feeling
she was gonna die before you.

639
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,578
She used to call me up
in a panic.

640
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,739
Someone did her tarot cards.

641
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,329
Predicted it all.
Freaked her out.

642
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,788
But she was right, I guess.

643
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,625
Her will is very precise.

644
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,086
Minnie had a will.

645
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,126
Motherfucker, that's weird.

646
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,964
Yes, she did.

647
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,157
She was concerned that if
anything ever happened to her,

648
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,138
you'd piss away
her family's fortune.

649
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,345
And she wanted you to finally
publish your novel.

650
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,011
- Poems.
- Whatever.

651
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,431
I write poetry,
you little bitch.

652
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,066
Until then, half of everything
goes to Heather.

653
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:21,104
And the other half of yours
sits frozen in escrow

654
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,863
for a bit of time

655
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,240
until you fulfill
the requirements stated here.

656
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,652
Ah, it's about time
you guys got here.

657
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,912
I'm gonna need some help
carrying my luggage.

658
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,993
If you're coming in,
kick off your shoes.

659
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,704
Effective immediately,
you can go back to your home

660
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,647
and get your typewriter
and some crappy underwear,

661
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,412
but that's it.

662
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,457
You're now persona non grata.

663
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,670
Minnie owned everything.
Everything was in her name.

664
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,712
You're now, basically, a bum.

665
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,256
She owned the cars,
the clothes,

666
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,550
the houses,
country club memberships,

667
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,934
cats and dogs.

668
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,389
She did not own all the cats.

669
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,725
Minnie loved you very much.

670
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,936
She just hated seeing you
throw it all away.

671
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:02,103
Thank you, Minnie-boo!

672
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,239
Fuck you as well.

673
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,694
I mean, to be fair,
there's a lot

674
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,780
of bad guys out there, right?

675
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,320
You guys are with me
in my wife's closet.

676
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,707
This is what you went
to the academy,

677
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,369
though, for, right,
shit like this?

678
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,539
Look after guys like me
at times like this.

679
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,207
You never know
when you're gonna catch

680
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,342
a fully dressed man unarmed.

681
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,423
I'm gonna wear
my Minnie-boo's Uggs.

682
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,382
Wear them in her memory.

683
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,518
She had abnormally large feet.

684
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,854
Great fuckin' style.

685
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,856
See those books?

686
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,769
I wrote those.

687
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,814
You're probably not
big readers, are you?

688
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,902
That's cool.
There's no pressure.

689
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,987
Alvarez,
I wrote that one for you.

690
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,450
José!

691
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,456
Listen, I'm gonna take
a little leave of absence.

692
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,244
But I left you a little bushel
of the sticky-icky

693
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,411
that you like, huh.

694
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,749
I can't tell you where it is,

695
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,567
'cause these guys might go
and try and smoke it,

696
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,127
but it's the same place
as last time.

697
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,257
Keep the pool hot.

698
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,759
I put it at 120 for you.

699
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:08,989
That's what I'm talking about.

700
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,925
Keep it there, baby,
and add the chlorine,

701
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,701
'cause I may have a gangbang
when I get back.

702
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,765
I will invite your mother.

703
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,371
- Thank you, Mr. Moondog.
- Wish me luck.

704
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,872
I'm off to write the next
great American novel.

705
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:17,896
Will do.
Thank you, sir.

706
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,601
Mom did this for a reason.

707
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,266
I-I'm not gonna
let you stay here.

708
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,061
- Okay.
- Dad, sorry.

709
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,695
How about just loaning me
a little bit?

710
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,050
Just a little bit
of spending cash

711
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,940
so I can get by
for a week or two.

712
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,531
Dad, I just...
I'll be here for you,

713
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,866
but just don't come back
till you're ready.

714
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,701
Honey, I'm not asking
for the world here.

715
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,537
I'm just asking for
a wee bit of compassion

716
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,997
for your father.

717
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,162
I know, but when's it gonna end?

718
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,650
You're gonna keep coming back
and asking me

719
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,131
for more and more and more.

720
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,212
Dad, I love you,
but I can't do that.

721
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,924
- Okay.
- I just can't. I...

722
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,838
Just come back
when you're ready, but I...

723
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,473
Okay, I understand.

724
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,099
- I'm sorry.
- I understand.

725
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,352
Don't apologize, sweetie.

726
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,012
You'll see.

727
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,858
I'll be back,
better than ever.

728
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,361
Back so good you're gonna see
that I was never gone

729
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,941
in the first place.

730
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,447
I love you, Dad.
I'm sorry.

731
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,483
I love you.

732
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,743
I still don't understand
how you married

733
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,154
this milk-drinking closet case.

734
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,601
- I mean, look at him.
- Closet case?

735
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,161
He's got no magic,
he's got no style.

736
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,371
He's dressed up
like a JV cheerleader.

737
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,956
I had high hopes for you,
Heather.

738
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,337
High fuckin' hopes.

739
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,667
Fuck off!
Get out of here,

740
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,924
you fuckin'... turd!

741
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,675
It's okay.

742
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,054
Sorry, he just makes me crazy.

743
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:38,559
He may be a jerk,
but he's a great man.

744
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,845
He's brilliant.

745
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,480
I mean, you'll never be
great or brilliant.

746
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,272
You're dependable.

747
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,446
Oh, thanks.

748
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:11,342
♪ Two times twice. ♪

749
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,127
Like that, I like that,
I like that.

750
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,341
Look, Lewis,
I'm a bit destitute, man.

751
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,848
Float me enough cash
to get back down to the Keys

752
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,225
so I can buy the fun goodies
that make me

753
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,510
smile and laugh all day.

754
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,894
Is that so much to ask?

755
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,458
I can't do it for you, Big Papa.

756
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,565
I can't, because you know what?

757
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,396
I've been waiting for ages,
and I ain't

758
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,797
- getting no pages, sweet tooth.
- Mm-hmm.

759
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,312
I can't do it.

760
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,321
That's a good...
that's a good point.

761
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,527
Yeah, it is a good point.

762
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,191
That's why I made it,
you dumb fuck.

763
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,282
I'm not asking you to part
the fuckin' Red Sea for me.

764
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,242
I'm asking you for enough loot
to set me up

765
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,703
for a few weeks here
so I can have my daily goodies.

766
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,834
Little booze, little weed,
a little poontang.

767
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,878
That's not asking too much.

768
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,586
And since you're saying
you won't,

769
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,123
then do your fuckin' job
and just get me a gig, you know?

770
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,711
Fuck, I'll speak anywhere.

771
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,924
Get me set up at a church,
a public library,

772
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,429
a retirement home, Mapco!

773
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,993
And they can pump their gas,
and they hear me

774
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,244
through the little speaker
up there.

775
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,537
The little aluminum thing.
I don't give a fuck.

776
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,768
Oh, my God.

777
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,599
Call my motherfuckin'
chiropractor.

778
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,481
My back is gonna be
fucked up tomorrow.

779
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,517
I can...

780
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,231
I'm not even sure
what he's, like...

781
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,441
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

782
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,982
Is friendship about
"I need something from you"?

783
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,368
Do you understand
what I'm talking about, Bertie?

784
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,119
Civility.

785
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,405
Yes.

786
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,619
It makes complete sense, man.

787
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,956
I have real clients
up for literary awards.

788
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:31,497
I'm sending faxes at my office.

789
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,461
Hello?

790
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:38,137
Motherfucker hung up on me.
Oh, my God.

791
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,845
What's going on, guys?

792
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,514
Hey, is, uh, Linger' in?

793
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,148
Nah.

794
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,435
- Lingerie's not in?
- No.

795
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,524
- Where is he?
- Jamaica.

796
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,986
Ah, the Magical Stoner.

797
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,405
I get your drift, man.

798
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:04,322
Your silence is code with me.

799
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,457
So, what's with the guns?

800
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,336
Huh?

801
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,292
You guys ever watch
Magnum, P.I.?

802
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,754
It's based on my life.

803
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,384
I watch it all the time.

804
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,545
It's like looking
in the fucking mirror.

805
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:26,765
All right, catch you later.

806
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:29,889
Mm.

807
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,025
Hey, let him know
Moondog came by, huh?

808
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,681
"The wind, the rain,
the star, the bird,

809
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,142
"the clock will answer you:

810
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,273
"'Get drunk, good man.

811
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,606
"'Do not be martyred slaves of Time.

812
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,567
Get drunk and stay drunk!'"

813
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,572
Is that poetry?

814
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,109
Of course it's poetry,
you toothless, illiterate chump.

815
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,495
- It's Baudelaire.
- Here's a poem.

816
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,451
- Come on.
- It goes...

817
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,840
Not bad, Phil.
Not bad at all.

818
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,426
Hey, who wants to go
on a field trip?

819
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,685
This your car here?

820
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,195
Why did you destroy
your own house?

821
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,448
Eh, I don't...

822
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,405
Boredom, I guess? I don't know.

823
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:33,697
Dad, what is wrong with you?

824
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,162
I'm fine. I'm really
better than fine.

825
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,105
It's just, this is another
little adventure we're on.

826
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,916
When'd you become
such a Republican?

827
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,921
- Republican?
- Or whatever.

828
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,582
Oh, my God.

829
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,091
You know,
just getting my groove on.

830
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,628
- Having a little fun.
- Your groove?

831
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,467
- Yeah.
- What groove?

832
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,222
Honey, honey, honey, whoa, whoa.

833
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,930
When's the last time
you laughed, honey?

834
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,594
Phil, Phil, Phil, do the thing.

835
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,558
See if you can make
my baby laugh.

836
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,312
Hi, Heather.

837
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,817
I am Toothless Phil.

838
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:05,570
I am a good friend
of your daddy.

839
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,321
We want you to be happy.

840
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,403
We love you
just the way you are.

841
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,785
Who's your daddy?

842
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,413
Moondog's your daddy.
He loves you.

843
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,824
Mm-hmm.

844
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,788
Back again, huh?

845
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,876
Your choice: prison or rehab.

846
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,040
Is there a third option?

847
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,129
Nope. Last chance.

848
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,545
Rehab it is.
Preferably somewhere tropical.

849
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,700
I'm remanding you into
the custody of your daughter.

850
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:35,183
She will escort you to a rehab facility now.
- Great.

851
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,184
You'll need to spend
a mandatory 12 months there

852
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,582
getting your life
back together, Moondog.

853
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,598
- 12 days is not a problem.
- 12 months.

854
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,977
- Okay.
- 12 months?

855
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,442
It all stops now...
the foolishness.

856
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,198
I understand. I need a change
of pace. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

857
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,220
And if you mess this up,
it's jail time you're getting.

858
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,406
If-if I may suggest, Your Honor.

859
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,196
- Tell her, Moondog!
- I was told

860
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,865
of this amazing rehab facility
in the Virgin Islands.

861
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,284
It's got an open bar

862
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,498
and 24-hour Thai massage.

863
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,253
A little jerky-jerk to take

864
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,665
the edge off
during the detox period.

865
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,835
Drain the old jizz pipe
with the antitoxins.

866
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,799
- Excuse me?
- All due respect

867
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:16,012
to my own personal fluid
transition into my sobriety.

868
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,347
I want to let you know
that the therapeutic value

869
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,012
of a groin massage

870
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,852
during the acute withdrawal
phase is off the charts

871
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,336
- fucking medicinal.
- It's not gonna happen.

872
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,726
Take it easy, Judge!

873
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:29,112
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why you got to be like that?

874
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,864
You know, I was... I was a real
fan of your writing, Moondog.

875
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,492
Yeah?

876
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:37,245
Shut up.

877
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,827
But, you know,
it amazes me how someone

878
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:44,119
that can write so beautifully
can be so crude and reckless.

879
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,538
Don't you be acting like you
knew where the rooster crow.

880
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,252
Don't let us down, Moondog.

881
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,633
We're rooting for you. Next.

882
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,044
Get him out of here.

883
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,053
Heather, my dear,

884
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,966
would you be so kind
as to pull over

885
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,555
and get your old man
one final beer?

886
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,429
Sure, Dad.

887
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,350
Yeah. Give me a, uh,
Lucky Lotto Triple 7

888
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,359
and a... and a cigar, would you?

889
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,236
Sure.

890
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,614
You don't sell acid, do you?

891
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,149
No.

892
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,942
That's too bad, man.

893
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:18,112
This place used to.

894
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,991
Did your mother love me?

895
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,251
Yes, Dad.

896
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:26,878
She said that?

897
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,538
Of course.

898
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,958
She think I was brilliant?

899
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,876
She thought you were a genius.

900
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,889
She said that?

901
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,392
That's why she stayed with you
all those years.

902
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,020
And that's why
you've always been able

903
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,646
to get away
with everything, Dad.

904
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:51,236
Oh, Minnie-boo.

905
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,397
She had an incredible ass.

906
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,906
Could fellate like a python.

907
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,442
Fuck, she could
fellate a python if she...

908
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,700
I'm gonna miss her.

909
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,916
Let's go to rehab.

910
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,797
Mm. I'll try
and do better, okay?

911
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,431
- Okay.
- Okay.

912
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,808
You can do this.

913
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,969
Mm. Okay. All right, Sunrise.

914
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,513
Let's get this party started.

915
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,852
It really wasn't up to me.

916
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,267
You should've heard
the judge, man.

917
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,935
She-she swung a hard gavel.

918
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,853
She was a fan of mine, too.

919
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,898
Which is kind of weird, but...

920
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,969
I mean, I wouldn't have
come down here like, you know,

921
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,576
if I didn't have a little bit
of a nudge, you know?

922
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,829
Well, this lady's very happy
that you're here.

923
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,456
We have your entire year
planned out.

924
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:49,336
So when you leave us,
you'll be a changed person.

925
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:56,384
God, grant me the serenity

926
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,296
to accept the things
I cannot change

927
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:02,932
and the courage to change
the things I can

928
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,889
and the wisdom
to tell the difference.

929
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,441
Hey, you guys are funny.

930
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,102
Oh, that's such bullshit.

931
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,237
No.

932
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,899
Oh, you fucking talk
to yourself.

933
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,534
What's up, everybody?
Uh, my name is Jason Kravitz.

934
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,320
- Hi, Jason.
- Uh, third time here.

935
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,455
What? Who's repeating?
Who's repeating?

936
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,081
Ah, you are.

937
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:30,540
Yeah, uh, first time I was here,
I was... I was drinking a lot.

938
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,126
So I decided to make...
make myself a better person.

939
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,755
I decided to come here.

940
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,042
Uh, when I got out,
I was good for about six months.

941
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,697
And my friends
were like, "Dude,

942
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,490
you don't have to... you don't
have to drink to have fun."

943
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,880
I said, "That's right.

944
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,720
We could do weed
or cocaine or heroin."

945
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,725
And we did 'em all.

946
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,729
My dad's a preacher. He's the
one that fucking put me in here.

947
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,517
- Why?
- 'Cause he caught me huffing paint a few times.

948
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,088
Also, I was breaking
into people's houses

949
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,399
and just burning shit.

950
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,814
Like, nothing real bad.

951
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,074
I love lighting shit on fire.

952
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,986
- Yeah. Eh.
- Nobody was home.

953
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,433
We didn't find out
the kids were upstairs

954
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,244
until later,
and if I wasn't there,

955
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,409
they would've fucking burned
to death. I got 'em out.

956
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,021
- From the second floor?
- Yeah. Well...

957
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,130
I just went up the stairs. Yeah.
- Oh, cool.

00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,975
Watch this. Hiya!

1040
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,312
All right. I'm so sorry, man.

1041
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,164
You're gonna be fine.
We just need this money.

1042
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,034
Don't have to take part
of this derelict behavior, man.

1043
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,410
Derelict behavior?
What are you talking about?

1044
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,140
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Hey, Christ already paid

1045
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,558
- for all our fucking sins, man.
- Come on, man.

1046
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:36,582
- Come on, let's go.
- Boom!

1047
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,495
- Wait, hold on.
- Oh...

1048
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,910
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Fuck.

1049
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,794
No, that was for him
when he wakes up, dude.

1050
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,483
- Fuck that. This ain't church, man.
- Oh, what the fuck?

1051
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,193
Oh, fucking A, man.
You know the best part

1052
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,753
- about God, man?
- Hey, assholes!

1053
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,655
Christ was even
a sinner, so we clean, man!

1054
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,511
- That's my money!
- We're good to go!

1055
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,801

Hey.

00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,653
- Place is good, man.
- What's up, man?

1114
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:39,111
- Oh, it's pretty lunar these days, man.
- Good to see you.

1115
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,277
Got to tell you, Moondog,
business is so good,

1116
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,991
- I bought a second boat.
- Yeah?

1117
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,326
Yeah. Named it Success.

1118
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,536
I just take tours
to the outer key.

1119
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,669
When they see a dolphin,
I act all fucking stoked, right?

1120
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,295
"Oh, it's a dolphin!

1121
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,673
Look at the baby dolphin! Look!"

1122
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,050
Tell them to dive in.
Make sure they don't drown.

1123
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,303
Only had four deaths
on my watch.

1124
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,588
Only four?

1125
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,303
Four deaths in over
eight straight years

1126
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,263
of dolphin touring
is a terrific record.

1127
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,268
Now, I've been stripped
of my license temporarily

1128
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,975
on five separate occasions,

1129
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:13,892
but each time, I get it
reinstated due to a technicality

1130
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,027
I never quite understood.

1131
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,779
It's beyond luck or karma, man.
I'm blessed up, bro.

1132
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,190
- Meant to be.
- Yeah.

1133
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,029
I'm cemented in this industry.

1134
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:24,285
They fucks with ole Captain Wack
around these parts.

1135
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,868
Don't fuck with Captain Wack.

1136
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:31,205
You will get whacked
fucking with Captain Wack.

1137
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,870
What-what is this?

1138
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:41,840
Dolphins, man. I love some
fucking dolphins, man.

1139
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,631
The sounds that come out
of their mouths.

1140
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,563
- They trying to communicate with you.
- Mm-hmm.

1141
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,593
All you got to do
is talk back to 'em.

1142
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,011
I fell in love with dolphins

1143
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,180
ever since I saw
the, uh, show Flipper.

1144
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,768
Blew me away.

1145
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,433
How they make that noise.

1146
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:01,280
I'm telling you, I wouldn't
be able to live like this

1147
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,691
if I wasn't fucking
doing dolphin tours, man.

1148
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,279
I wouldn't have all this.

1149
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,867
This is all from dolphin tours.

1150
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,658
Oh, oh, I got something.

1151
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,542
- Get your ass. Goddamn.
- Oh!

1152
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:16,045
Oh, we gonna fry
this motherfucker up.

1153
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,796
Yes.

1154
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,174
Make sure to get
your taste buds ready.

1155
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,426
Yeah, this is almost done.

1156
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,883
Look here, Moondog,
you come work for me, man.

1157
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,593
It'll be great.

1158
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,223
Dolphins are great.

1159
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,351
Way they go up and down
in the water like a porpoise.

1160
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,476
You'll love that shit, man.

1161
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,013
- That sounds cool, Wack.
- Yeah.

1162
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,306
I'm in, man.

1163
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,020
- Aah!
- What the fuck!

1164
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,935
- Fucking...
- Man, that shit's loaded.

1165
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,175
- No shit.
- Man, you could've killed a dolphin, Moondog.

1166
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:45,692
You want to shoot
something, shoot this shit here.

1167
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,236
This is what I used in 'Nam.

1168
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,405
- Shit, man.
- Cocaine.

1169
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,416
Now I got to feed
my coke-addicted parrot.

1170
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,812
- Yeah, yeah, set him up.
- Cocaine.

1171
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,314
Give him some of this shit
right here.

1172
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,672
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, there you go.

1173
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,207
She gonna get high as shit.

1174
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,342
- Coca.
- But seriously, Moondog,

1175
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,298
I could use a partner.

1176
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,304
And I got a good sense
about you, man.

1177
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,261
- Like I say, I'm in, man.
- Yeah, man.

1178
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:12,052
Yeah. We'll become
millionaires together, man.

1179
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,969
- Ah, shit, man, let's do it.
- Look at...

1180
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,809
look how far I've come so far.

1181
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,439
I like your style, Wack.

1182
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,045
- Look at that, look at that.
- Look at that.

1183
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,436
- See the juices dripping off that?
- Oh, yeah.

1184
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:24,356
- Oh, man, that's gonna be good.
- That's gonna be real good, man.

1185
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,155
I like your swagger, Captain.

1186
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:29,785
Thanks, Moondog.

1187
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,786
Got nicked in 'Nam.

1188
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,414
- Makes me walk like a pimp.
- Mm.

1189
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,793
Some shrapnel
partially shredded my nut sack,

1190
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,921
but everything still works.
Still banging.

1191
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,253
- Yeah, you are.
- Ba-ba-ba-ba.

1192
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,258
Well, usually, when people call

1193
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,795
and say they're coming
for the dolphin tour,

1194
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,825
- they come and they pay cash.
- Yeah. Right. Right.

1195
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,887
- My bread and butter, baby. My bread and butter.
- Yeah...

1196
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,724
- So you can tell in the tone of their voice, man...
- Right.

1197
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,560
- ...if they're, like, serious or not.
- Exactly.

1198
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,099
If they really love the dolphins

1199
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,313
and if they really want
to see the dolphin.

1200
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,604
- You hear it in their voice.
- Right.

1201
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,863
- You see?
- Mm-hmm.

1202
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,193
That's right.

1203
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:09,108
Come on over.

1204
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,743
Yes! Hi!

1205
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,998
Welcome. Lots of dolphins
for you today. Yes.

1206
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,749
Act real stoked.
Act real stoked.

1207
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,628
- Yeah, yeah. Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, hey!

1208
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,709
Ahoy there, matey.

1209
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,589
- Welcome aboard.
- Welcome.

1210
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,422
- What's your name, little lady?
- Lefty Lipschitz.

1211
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,336
I knew it. Hello, Ms. Lipschitz.
- Hi.

1212
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:32,348
- Hunter. Mike.
- Mike. Hello. Yes.

1213
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:33,928
Dr. Lipschitz. Call me Ted.

1214
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,934
- All the Schitzes.
- One, two, three.

1215
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,847
♪ We are the Lipschitzes ♪

1216
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,730
♪ That is our name. ♪

1217
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,357
Listen up, everybody.

1218
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,439
All right, we're in the middle
of mating season.

1219
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,651
If you see some humping,
don't look away.

1220
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,315
It's cool-looking.

1221
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,576
It's nature in all its glory.
Dolphins love to bone.

1222
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,740
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, you listen up, kids. Huh?

1223
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,202
Greatest dolphin guy
in the history of dolphin guys

1224
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,786
is sharing wisdom with you.

1225
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,373
- Thanks, Moondog.
- That's a fact.

1226
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,629
Now, what he failed to mention
is that these dolphins

1227
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,026
got what's called
a-a corkscrew pecker.

1228
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,087
All right?

1229
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,252
A little, whippy, windy,
wranky kind of thing.

1230
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,115
It's true, kids.
It's sort of like a corkscrew.

1231
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,139
So keep a lookout.

1232
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,426
And it's orgy season,

1233
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,263
so hopefully we'll
get to see something,

1234
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,872
- some real wild stuff.
- Everybody's fucking.

1235
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,728
They're really horny
this time of season.

1236
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,514
So watch your back, Carnello.

1237
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,057
Some of them prefer redheads.

1238
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,226
- Is this thing safe?
- Very safe.

1239
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,315
I wouldn't have you on here
if it wasn't safe.

1240
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,027
Family, I just got to tell you,
I love dolphins so much.

1241
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,552
After the day,
you're gonna love dolphins

1242
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,238
as much as I love dolphins.

1243
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,198
They don't hurt you.
They just want to love you.

1244
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,953
Dolphins know this man.

1245
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,832
They come from all over the
world to come see Captain Wack.

1246
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,412
And they're coming
to see me today.

1247
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,373
And you guys get to be
on his boat today.

1248
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,047
All right, all right, all right.

1249
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,049
I see a few out there.

1250
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,676
We in business.
Who wants to dive in?

1251
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,712
- No, we're good.
- No, we're good, we're good.

1252
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:55,973
It's prime mating season.
Seaweed is an aphrodisiac.

1253
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:58,680
Wonderful.
- I think they're getting cold feet, Wack.

1254
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,687
All right, last chance. Any takers?
- It's all yours.

1255
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,767
Y'all a bunch of pussies.

1256
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:03,834
Show them
how it's done, Captain.

1257
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,224
We're just here
for a little tour.

1258
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,858
Dolphins, here I come, baby.

1259
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,655
Yeah.

1260
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,988
Get in! This water is beautiful.

1261
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,993
Look at the dolphin.

1262
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,432
Honey, look at the dolphin.
Isn't that cute?

1263
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:21,324
Lots of dolphins, motherfuckers!

1264
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,368
- Does that look right?
- Get in!

1265
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,538
- The water's perfect.
- All good, Wack?

1266
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,251
- You good?
- It's great!

1267
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,883
Dolphins, here I come!

1268
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,510
Honey, honey, honey.

1269
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:36,343
That doesn't look
like a dolphin fin.

1270
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:39,975
Captain, that kind... that
kind of looks like a shark fin.

1271
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,306
This must be all part
of the show.

1272
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,098
I'm having a great time!
It's perfect!

1273
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,767
- Mr. Wack, come back!
- Mr. Wack? Mr. Wack!

1274
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,606
Come back, Mr. Wack.

1275
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:53,739
- What the... what the fuck?!
- Come back!

1276
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:54,990
Help! Aah!

1277
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,275
Motherfucker, Captain.

1278
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,944
You put on a fucking show, man.

1279
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,363
This ain't
no motherfucking show!

1280
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,281
Aah!

1281
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,494
Whoa! That's cool-looking.

1282
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,038
When's the last time
he clipped his toenails?

1283
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,377
Seriously, that's gnarly, man.

1284
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:14,339
Oh, shit! Holy shit!

1285
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,720
Oh, Lord!
- It's just a flesh wound. Don't worry.

1286
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,756
That dolphin got teeth!

1287
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,140
Oh, shit! Where's my foot?

1288
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,551
Okay, just hold my hand.

1289
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:24,937
Fuck, Wack.
He got you pretty good, man.

1290
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,894
Oh, man. Couldn't have been
a fucking dolphin.

1291
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,979
Can't believe this shit, man.

1292
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:33,112
I'm-I'm-I'm pretty sure it
wasn't a dolphin that bit you,

1293
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:35,739
'cause look at your foot.

1294
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,115
Listen, you're gonna be
all right.

1295
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,617
You're gonna be just fine.

1296
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,097
I mean, it's just
a little flesh wound.

1297
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,601
You're gonna be up dancing
in no time.

1298
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,952
You going somewhere,
motherfucker?

1299
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,210
Yeah. I am.

1300
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,292
Trade you, though.

1301
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,251
Foot for the hat? Huh?

1302
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:58,296
Come on. Huh? There we go.

1303
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,089
- Hey, man.
- It's been real, Moondog.

1304
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,473
Ah, it's been more than that.

1305
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,555
It's been wack, Captain Wack.

1306
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,219
Uh-huh.

1307
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,682
See you down the road.

1308
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:28,000
Look at what the Moondog
just sniffed out.

1309
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,913
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, Linger'.

1310
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,959
Hey, Jimmy. I'm back.

1311
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,421
- Moondog?
- Yeah, I'm back.

1312
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,198
- Where the fuck you been, man?
- Jesus.

1313
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,758
You look like shit.

1314
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,094
No, man, I look like
I always look, man.

1315
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,804
We about to set sail.
Come fuck with us.

1316
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,434
There we go.

1317
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,096
I think we need to look
at a positive I.D. on him.

1318
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,793
Make sure the motherfucker
washes his feet.

1319
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,024
Take your shoes off, Dog,

1320
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,900
when you get
on the fucking boat.

1321
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:02,576
Glad I came up on y'all, man.

1322
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,014
You did, man, but it look like

1323
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,474
you in some serious shit,
though, Dog.

1324
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,909
- Yeah.
- Jimmy, tell him.

1325
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,494
You in serious shit, man.

1326
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:09,979
- How you figure it's serious?
- Motherfucker. I mean,

1327
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,480
I heard from some guys
down, you know,

Keys people.

1329
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,503
- Word's out down there.
- Word on the streets

1330
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,419
that you did escape and then
the pigs is on your ass now.

1331
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,382
Both are true.

1332
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,842
- Def.
- That's not serious.

1333
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,722
That sounds pretty cool,
the way you put it.

1334
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,009

get off my chest with you, man.

1359
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,172
I don't even really know
how to say it.

1360
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,583
I'm just gonna come clean.

1361
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:42,672
I was having an affair
with Minnie, man.

1362
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,712
Several years,
behind your back.

1363
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:48,178
I'm talking about
really sexually wild

1364
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:51,060
experiences with your wife, man.

1365
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,642
Yeah, I figured as much.

1366
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,979
But I do know
she didn't love me.

1367
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,234
She loved my sex,
but she didn't love me.

1368
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,941
I was the R-and-B singer
with the big ding-a-ling.

1369
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:06,279
I was just a diversion
until you came back, you dig?

1370
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:09,445
But she honestly loved you.
I know that for a fact.

1371
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,863
She did, didn't she?

1372
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,656
She loved the fuck
out of you, Moondog.

1373
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,372
And I loved her, man.
Still do.

1374
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,254
- So sexual.
- Hypersexual.

1375
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,754
- Oh, man.
- Oh, man...

1376
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,026
The moves that she'd do
in the bedroom.

1377
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,416
She had these tiny hands.

1378
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,506
they made my cock look so big.

1379
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:26,657
Oh, wow, you should have seen

1380
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,092
what mine looked like
in her hands.

1381
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,760
The way she went down, I mean,
I could just see her right now.

1382
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,455
- And then you make eye contact...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1383
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,687
I hear you, I hear you.
Th-That's enough, that's enough.

1384
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:37,348
I hear you.

1385
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,518
I had a crazy-ass dream
to help you get out

1386
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,357
that motherfuckin' thing
that you in.

1387
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,318
I had a dream you was dressed
like a woman to help you escape.

1388
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,153
- A woman?
- Yeah.

1389
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,363
I had the same dream.
I had this guy,

1390
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:52,576
a buddy in Vietnam,
dressed up like a geisha.

1391
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,535
Walked out of the war.

1392
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,771
- Get in touch with your...
- His femininity.

1393
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,331
- Yeah, femininity.
- Tap into it, man.

1394
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,088
It may not be a bad look
after all, you understand me?

1395
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:03,749
I could see you
with a dress on.

1396
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,667
Moondoggy-doggy
might get used to it.

1397
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,633
Yeah. The Dog in a dress
and some high heels.

1398
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,923
And let him strut the runway.

1399
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,466
It's a ridiculous idea. It's...

1400
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,181
It's kind of fuckin'
freaky ingenious, guys.

1401
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,437
I think I already got
the underwear right.

1402
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,350
And if I got my walk right,

1403
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,860
this would be too easy.

1404
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,771
Oh, look at this!

1405
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,941
Go ahead and give 'em
the whole moon there, Moondog.

1406
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,655
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

1407
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,194
Hey, you actually
look good, Dog.

1408
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,738
I mean, it's kind of
fuckin' freaky, right?

1409
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,268
I mean,
it's supposed to look freaky.

1410
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,749
Right now,
you a freaky little bitch.

1411
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,002
That's what's gonna
throw the police off, you dig?

1412
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,422
Moondog.

1413
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,174
Ain't nobody gonna
fuckin' recognize you

1414
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,381
in that shit right there,
especially the fuckin' pigs.

1415
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,965
You know what the challenge
of this situation's gonna be?

1416
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:53,975
Yes, ma'am?

1417
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,634
Dudes are gonna want my shit.

1418
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,680
Motherfuckin' Moondog!

1419
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,310
We schleppin'
through the city unseen.

1420
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:07,025
What a disguise.
A perfect disguise, baby.

1421
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,065
Any of your bitches
gonna get hot on you

1422
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:12,325
they see you riding around
with a hot blonde like me?

1423
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,238
They gonna like the fact.
This is that interracial shit.

1424
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,747
Like Jim Brown
with Raquel Welch.

1425
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,078
You know what I'm talking about?

1426
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,958
I love it when a plan
comes together.

1427
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,505
Anything for a friend.

1428
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:30,009
- Yes. Yes!
- This is what...

1429
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,511
- I'm lookin' at heaven.
- Yes!

1430
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:32,842
Heaven looks like, Linger'.

1431
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,882
Think of it like this, Dog.

1432
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,245
I'm gonna give you
so much of this,

1433
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,261
you gonna be able to write you
a couple of novels

1434
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,894
or that poetry shit.

1435
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:42,181
- Ah, poetry.
- Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout poems

1436
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:45,271
- out your motherfuckin' asshole.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1437
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,982
This... this is the safecracker
right here.

1438
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,943
To crack the safe
to writing that thing,

1439
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,654
and getting that money.

1440
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,740
'Cause this is the key
to unlocking

1441
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:59,407
all of those juices
in that head of yours.

1442
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,120
Trust me.

1443
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,303
- The cops, they here.
- Say what?

1444
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,385
The pigs is here right now?

1445
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:20,389
Fuck! I must have been
high as a motherfucker

1446
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:21,724
when I hatched that plan.

1447
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,388
Gas up the seaplane.

1448
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:25,433
Go get my shit out
the magical room.

1449
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,316
Somebody scrape up Moondog.

1450
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:30,195
It's time to go.
Let's load this shit up.

1451
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,946
Let's get rolling.
Stop dillydallying.

1452
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,027
The cops is coming.

1453
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,941
Load up the motherfuckin'
Rasta van.

1454
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,280
I'm bringing y'all
for the music.

1455
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,571
We on the run, like we used
to be back in the days.

1456
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:39,808
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1457
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,824
Hurry, mon, hurry.
Put it in now. Move, move!

1458
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:45,586
Lingerie, close the fuckin'
door. It's time to go.

1459
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,357
You know I got the motherfuckin'
master plan.

1460
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,044
My Rasta, he gonna fly you
to the Keys on my seaplane.

1461
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,261
Time to get me down
to Key West, baby.

1462
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,343
Cops ain't never gonna
catch the Moondog.

1463
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,132
Moondog, come on, hurry up.

1464
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:00,579
Get this shit on the plane,
fast like.

1465
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,595
I hope we got
enough weed for this.

1466
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,473
Shit.

1467
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,232
This is gonna be fun.

1468
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,394
Didn't know it'd be this easy.

1469
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,564
Hey, uh... is he a good pilot?

1470
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,198
Not at all.

1471
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,449
- Not at all?
- No, man.

1472
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,110
He got glaucoma
in both his eyes.

1473
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,869
But when he's zooted
off of that shit,

1474
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,780
he'll get you
where you need to be.

1475
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,165
But, Dog, you gonna need
some cash for the splash.

1476
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,623
Ah, that's gonna cush
the landing.

1477
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:29,459
- Yes, sir.
- Well, what can I say, Linge'?

1478
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:32,466
We shall meet again on some
distant shore, my friend.

1479
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,169
Yeah.

1480
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,339
The sun, the rain
and the motherfuckin' moon.

1481
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:39,952
You make us proud down there,
you hear me?

1482
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:42,138
Time for liftoff, Linge'.
Time for liftoff.

1483
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,393
Be good, or be good at it.

1484
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,474
- Yeah.
- When I smoke enough weed

1485
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,765
and drink the 'shroom tea,

1486
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:51,606
a few lines of dainty white
Bogotácoca...

1487
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,397
- Yeah...
- Shit, man!

1488
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,734
- Woof! Woof!
- Woof!

1489
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,901
Man, I get insane vision,

1490
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:01,741
and the vision
guide like a spirit

1491
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:04,623
in a direct line
to our final destination.

1492
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,250
- Destination, yeah.
- Safe and sound.

1493
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:10,037
- I don't fuck around.
- Ah, you know what,

1494
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,796
it doesn't even matter
what you said.

1495
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,174
It just sounds so fuckin' good
how you say it.

1496
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,423
You know, I'm 98% blind.

1497
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,303
That's perfect.

1498
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,539
They don't even know, man.

1499
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:50,828
Moondog, what you got?!

1500
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,416
Riding through the slipstream

1501
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:54,502
with a whole lot of green.

1502
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,416
Gimme some of that, bro!

1503
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,631
- Moondog, I love you!
- Hey. Yeah.

1504
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,920
Love you, too.

1505
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,339
What's up, Moondog?

1506
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,225
Ooh... Ooh...

1507
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,511
Yeah, man!

1508
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,101
Hey, Moondog.

1509
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:18,363
- Honey, I'm home.
- Oh, Moondog!

1510
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:24,744
Mm...

1511
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,496
All right, that's enough!

1512
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,657
This is my Cuban maid.

1513
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,826
Ooh, I think I need
some of that.

1514
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:33,211
Let's get the party started.

1515
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,042
- All right.
- Salud.

1516
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,003
All right!

1517
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:10,035
Hey, Moondog!

1518
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,513
Thank you for meeting
with me today.

1519
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,210
Yeah, my pleasure.
I-I don't remember

1520
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,191
the last time
I did one of these.

1521
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:38,772
Got an interesting life.

1522
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,904
How'd you pull it off?
How'd you do it?

1523
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:45,033
I only pull it off how I do it.

1524
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,285
I mean, look,
I could tell you that I've...

1525
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,662
been trying to uncover the abyss

1526
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:52,620
beneath my illusory connection
with the world.

1527
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,376
I could tell you that it's
all written in the stars.

1528
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:58,505
I could tell you
that I'm a reverse paranoiac.

1529
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:00,336
I'm quite certain
that the world

1530
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,341
is conspiring to make me happy.

1531
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,127
All three of which are true,
but...

1532
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,218
it's really
a little simpler than that.

1533
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:10,555
I like to have fun, man.

1534
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,469
Fun's the fucking gun, man.

1535
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:16,480
Also, I like boats.

1536
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,482
I like the water.
I like the sunshine.

1537
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,940
I like beautiful women a lot.

1538
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:22,820
And then I get
all these things going, man.

1539
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,197
They're all turning me on.

1540
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,573
My wires are connecting
upstairs,

1541
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:27,655
and I start to hear music
in my head.

1542
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,366
You know? And the world's
reverberating

1543
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:31,892
back and forth,
and I hit the frequency,

1544
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,203
and I start to dance to it,
and my fingers get moving,

1545
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,538
my head's getting soupy,

1546
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,579
I'm spinning all over
the fucking place,

1547
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:42,045
and the fucking words come out.

1548
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,960
It's like it's a fucking gift.

1549
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:46,548
What makes you, Moondog,

1550
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:49,556
different than all these
other people?

1551
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,597
Seriously?

1552
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:55,353
You mean the ones up north
on the mainland?

1553
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,481
The ones racing
to their red light,

1554
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,938
the ones stuck in their ways,
a little bit too busy

1555
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:05,071
to check inside
and say howdy, howdy, do?

1556
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:07,858
That shit's not for me, man.
I mean, fuck, man.

1557
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,448
So many people trip themselves
when they're running downhill.

1558
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,988
Life's hard enough. Why would
you fucking want to do that?

1559
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,407
I mean, fuck, we're here
to have a good time.

1560
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:17,121
I just want
to have a good time

1561
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,455
until this shit's over, man.

1562
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,666
This life gig's a fucking rodeo.

1563
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:23,377
I'm gonna suck the nectar
out of it and fuck it raw-dog

1564
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,917
till the wheels come off. Mmm.

1565
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,212
- Let me ask you something.
- Come on.

1566
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,721
- Off the record.
- Come on.

1567
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:33,224
What's up
with the women's clothes?

1568
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:36,012
- What women's clothes?
- Motherfucker,

1569
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:37,395
my phone was dead.

1570
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,647
I held a funeral
for that motherfucker.

1571
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:42,526
I had people giving speeches
in remembrance

1572
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,061
of the time
when my phone was alive.

1573
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:47,527
But it is back to life.

1574
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,736
It has resurrected,

1575
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:54,905
and the phone-a is a-ringing
off of the hook-a.

1576
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,165
Calling you
motherfucking van Gogh

1577
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,075
with words, baby.

1578
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:01,165
They calling you Walt Disney.
They want to freeze

1579
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,954
your motherfucking brain
when you die.

1580
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:09,632
But you was acting like
a little fuck-boy for a minute.

1581
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,307
And I had to admit...

1582
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:18,265
true genius takes true guidance,
takes true pushing.

1583
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:21,478
Let me tell you something.

1584
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,687
- Please, tell me something.
- Moondog.

1585
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:26,399
Tell me something.

1586
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:29,781
You up for a motherfucking
Pulitzer.

1587
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,487
My book's up for a Pulitzer?

1588
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,777
- Pulitzer.
- Ah!

1589
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,118
Minnie-boo, you hear this?

1590
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,658
Thank you.

1591
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:43,499
And now the prize
for outstanding poetry.

1592
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:47,166
It is with great honor
that I introduce to you

1593
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:51,257
Mr. Moondog.

1594
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,901
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1595
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:22,834
I had a lot in my life,

1596
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,460
but I always had
this feeling like,

1597
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,121
when I left...

1598
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,334
...no one gonna remember me.

1599
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,597
But knowing you,

1600
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,803
being a part of what you did...

1601
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,770
...maybe that means
something now.

1602
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,192
I want to thank you.

1603
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,669
You know what I liked the most
about being rich?

1604
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,249
Mm?

1605
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,790
You can just...

1606
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:15,463
be horrible to people,
and they just have to take it.

1607
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,938
This next poem is, uh,

1608
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:29,067
one I wrote at 3:00 a.m.,

1609
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:33,446
coming down off of a two-day
acid trip in the Virgin Islands.

1610
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,405
It's called
"The Beautiful Poem."

1611
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:45,166
"I go to bed in Havana

1612
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,577
"thinking about you.

1613
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:52,670
"Pissing a few
moments ago, I...

1614
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:56,962
"I looked down at my penis

1615
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,801
"with affection.

1616
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:03,601
"Knowing it has been inside you

1617
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,728
"twice today...

1618
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,812
...makes me feel beautiful."

1619
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:16,989
- Go, Moondog!
- Moondog!

1620
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,877
Ah...

1621
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:45,222
I have to admit I didn't think
you could do it, Dad.

1622
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,806
No?

1623
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,188
But you managed
to pull it off somehow.

1624
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,190
Sweetie,

1625
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:54,228
told you don't ever bet
against the Moondog.

1626
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:59,566
I'm just so happy you
finally dumped Limp-Dick.

1627
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,234
Oh. I know.

1628
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,639
- He sucked.
- Right?

1629
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:03,663
Yeah.

1630
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,464
You unlocked a fortune.

1631
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:21,049
The money is yours.

1632
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,181
Your complete
inheritance is all yours.

1633
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,636
Congratulations.

1634
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:27,678
Exactly. Perfect. Listen.
I want it all in cash, man.

1635
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,391
What was that?

1636
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,648
Cash, man. C-A-S-H, cash.

1637
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:34,559
All greenbacks.
I don't want you to put a penny

1638
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,193
of that stuff in the bank.

1639
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:37,674
You know, I don't trust
those Illuminati

1640
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:39,092
motherfuckers.

1641
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,343
Now, here's what
you're gonna do.

1642
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,279
I want you to buy me a sailboat.

1643
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,444
All right?
Like, a 150-, 200-footer,

1644
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,099
something really nice,
preferably vintage,

1645
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:48,490
and I want you
to name that boat Success,

1646
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,625
after my old friend
Captain Wack,

1647
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,661
and then you're gonna put
the rest of the cash

1648
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:54,045
stacked in that sailboat,

1649
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,796
and I want you

1650
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,582
to sail it down here to me.

1651
01:24:57,634 --> 01:24:59,045
That's over $50 million

1652
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,676
in cash, Moondog.

1653
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:02,161
All right, don't fuck it up.

1654
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:09,891
She's gonna want to marry me
now that I'm rich, right, huh?

1655
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,474
That's right.

1656
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:12,934
What do you think
about that, huh?

1657
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:14,474
Cash in a boat.

1658
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,296
We could do whatever we want
or nothing at all.

1659
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:20,654
- Yeah, mon.
- There she is.

1660
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,190
That's beautiful.

1661
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,529
She's awesome, man.
Awesome boat.

1662
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:28,071
Got great shapes in the cargo.
There's $46 million on board.

1663
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:29,239
Man...

1664
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,874
we're gonna buy ourselves
so much weed.

1665
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:34,035
Mmm.

1666
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:36,079
What do you think about that?

1667
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,569
You know what I want to do?

1668
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:42,256
I want to have a big fucking
firework show, man,

1669
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:44,512
invite all my friends
from the Keys.

1670
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,673
None of that sparkler bullshit

1671
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:48,933
that impresses lesbians,
pregnant women and babies.

1672
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,969
No, no, no, let's-let's Valhalla

1673
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,498
this motherfucker,
you know what I mean?

1674
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:53,683
Raise the dead.

1675
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,770
- Make it awesome for Minnie.
- Boom.

1676
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,901
Work it, Moondog.

1677
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:02,404
