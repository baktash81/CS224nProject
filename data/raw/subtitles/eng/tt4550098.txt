1
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,694
<i> And by the way, honey,</i>
<i> with all this decolletage</i>

2
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:32,030
<i> you should be getting</i>
<i> a lot more dickoletage</i>
<i> than what he has to offer.</i>

3
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,965
<i> And as I can recall it,</i>

4
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,967
<i> you were the one that told me</i>
<i> that when he came,</i>

5
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,636
<i> it was as thin</i>
<i> as coconut water.</i>

6
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,538
<i> Honey, that's</i>
<i> a deal breaker for me.</i>

7
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,306
<i> It was that thin.</i>

8
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,208
<i> Well, I see we're settling</i>
<i> for less nowadays.</i>

9
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,447
That's beyond.

10
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,486
Mrs. morrow,
a package arrived for you.

11
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,722
I found it in the mailbox
this morning.

12
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,458
May I ask you who you'd like
on duty this weekend?

13
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,494
Um, actually, why don't
you give everybody
the weekend off?

14
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,829
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.

15
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,831
We might go to
the beach house and, uh,

16
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,400
if not, it might be nice
to have a weekend alone.

17
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,802
I'll let everyone know.
Thank you.

18
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,742
Oh, damn it.

19
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,310
- Christopher?
- Yes?

20
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,646
I'm sorry. Can you
help me open this?
I just got a paper cut.

21
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,582
Yeah, of course.
Here, let me do it.
Thank you.

22
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,151
Yeah, yeah.
I just... a paper cut.

23
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,158
There's a note.
You can read it.

24
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,096
"Dear Susan, I've written
a novel that will be
published in the spring.

25
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,698
"It's different from
the kind of things
that I was writing

26
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,500
"when we were together."

27
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,604
Go ahead.

28
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,272
"In the end you left me
with the inspiration
that I needed

29
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,207
"to write from the heart.

30
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,610
"I wanted you to be
the first to read it,
so I'm sending along a proof.

31
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,378
"I will be in la until
Wednesday on business

32
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,114
"and it would be good
to see you after so long.

33
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,583
"My cell number
and email address
are below. Edward."

34
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
Thanks.

35
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,634
Morning.
Good morning.

36
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,905
What's that?
It's a manuscript
Edward sent me.

37
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,606
He wrote a novel.

38
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,642
Edward who?

39
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,311
Edward, my first husband.
You remember him.

40
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,547
I didn't know he could write.

41
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,715
Yes, you did.
He was writing a novel
when you and I got together.

42
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,417
You just don't remember.

43
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,653
Have you guys even talked
in 20 years?

44
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,155
19.

45
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:42,160
No. I tried calling him
a couple of years back,
but he hung up on me.

46
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,330
I think he's teaching English
at some prep school in Dallas.

47
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,165
It's sad, really.
He never remarried.

48
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,570
Where were you
last night? You didn't
come by the gallery.

49
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,607
I'm sorry. Really, I...

50
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,576
By the time I left
the office, I was late
for my dinner and...

51
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,744
It would have
taken you 15 minutes.

52
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,980
Fifteen minutes, and it would
have meant a lot to me.

53
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,852
Never mind.

54
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,588
You didn't come
to bed last night.
I didn't wanna wake you.

55
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,624
Yeah.

56
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:16,828
Well, I wasn't asleep.
I was too wound up
from the opening.

57
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,633
It went well, by the way.
Apparently.

58
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,168
Good.
Yeah.

59
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,708
Look, why don't you and i
go to the beach?

60
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,444
We can go tonight
and come back on Monday.

61
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,048
Maybe if we
just spent some time,
just the two of us?

62
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,789
Why are you wearing
this blazer on a Saturday?

63
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,660
Because I gotta
go back to the office,

64
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,830
and then I gotta go
to the airport, and then
i gotta go back to New York.

65
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,299
You just came from there.
Yes, I know.

66
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:57,302
But I have to go again
if I wanna get this deal done,

67
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,471
and I don't wanna have to sell
anything else.

68
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,306
Shit.
It's okay.

69
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,679
You know,
the strange thing is is,

70
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,248
I don't really care
about all this art.

71
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,921
That doesn't sound like you.
I know, but it's true.

72
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,657
I care.

73
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,659
It pisses me off.

74
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,429
I know you do.

75
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:27,532
Don't worry,
i can fill the walls
with some new la artists

76
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,669
and people will think
we're ahead of the curve
instead of going broke.

77
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,170
You won't have
to be embarrassed.

78
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,287
Are things a little better?

79
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,289
He's just having a hard time
with his business right now.

80
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,792
Carlos told me.

81
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:57,128
I'm surprised. I thought
we were hiding it pretty well.

82
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,531
Hutton would be very upset
to find out anybody knew.

83
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,967
He just hates not to win.

84
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,569
Are you sleeping?

85
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,805
Did you call my
psychopharmacologist?
Did you call him?

86
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,473
You should call him,
because he's a genius.

87
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,243
I'm worried
about you, seriously.

88
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,778
Just look at me for a second.
Look at me.

89
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,416
You scared me
the last time we talked.

90
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,418
I'm fine.

91
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,488
I am fine. I am...

92
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,325
I am. I just can't believe
that I told you
all of those things.

93
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,395
I'm just kind of
embarrassed, you know.

94
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:34,566
Because what right
do I have to not be happy?
I have everything.

95
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,168
I feel ungrateful
not to be happy.

96
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,437
As much right
as anyone, Susan,
as much right as anyone,

97
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,405
because it's all relative.

98
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:48,413
You're just awfully hard
on yourself.

99
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,450
How do you do it?

100
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:56,021
You mean with Carlos?
I just... it's...
I'm totally cool with it.

101
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,524
And having a gay husband
is not such a bad thing,
you know?

102
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,363
We're best friends.
We love each other completely.

103
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,932
I'm certainly
the only woman in his life.

104
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,535
And that lasts
longer than lust, doesn't it?

105
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,604
It's forever, really.

106
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,373
Hutton and I don't have that.

107
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,942
Did you ever?

108
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:21,346
I think we just
want different things,
or I want different things.

109
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,216
Do you still love him?

110
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,056
I'm being summoned. Pardon me.

111
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,558
He has to catch a plane.
I'm gonna say goodbye.

112
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,067
I hope this deal
works out for you.

113
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,636
I really do.
I know you need it.
We need this.

114
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,639
No. You need this.

115
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,478
Bye.
Bye.

116
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,855
<i> So I said,</i>

117
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,091
"well, my mother
always told me

118
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:09,360
"if you massage your pussy
with Pam cooking spray

119
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,862
"a month before
the baby comes,

120
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,831
"you don't need
vaginal rejuvenation."

121
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,334
I've gotta get some Pam.

122
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,705
And she is going to get
a nomination this year.

123
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,674
A nomination? She's gonna win.

124
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,045
Let's talk about your opening.

125
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:30,615
My favorite subject.
Not mine.

126
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:34,285
The opening was
spectacular last night.

127
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,121
Really?
That's what you thought?

128
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,022
What, you didn't?
No.

129
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,458
I thought the work
was incredibly strong.

130
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,462
So perfect with
all this junk culture
that we live in.

131
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,298
It's junk. It is junk.

132
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,901
Total junk.

133
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:54,539
Darling, you are
a big success.

134
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:59,310
No one really likes
what they do.
Then why do we do it?

135
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,545
Because we're driven.

136
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,115
Maybe a bit insecure.

137
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,720
We get into things
when we're young

138
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,823
and because we think
they mean something.

139
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,658
And then
we find out that they don't.

140
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:21,566
Oh, Susan, enjoy
the absurdity of our world.

141
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,068
It's a lot less painful.

142
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,574
And believe me, our world
is a lot less painful
than the real world.

143
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,062
Yeah, why are we driving
this old thing to marfa?

144
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:27,165
Because I just had it
completely rebuilt.
It's a classic.

145
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,734
It has a terrible
sound system.

146
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,736
Well, you're gonna have
to suffer through that.

147
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,738
You have two sets
of boots, India?

148
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,474
Do we really
have to stop tonight?
I'd rather just get there.

149
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,643
All right, ask your mother.
She's the boss.

150
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,815
I set the alarm.

151
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,401
India, you've been
on that thing for hours.

152
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,841
I thought you were
the one who wanted
to drive all night.

153
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:13,411
I did, but what are we
supposed to do, sing
campfire songs or something?

154
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,587
- How much longer?
- I don't know.

155
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,625
Like three,
three and a half hours.

156
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,294
Well, dad,
you're gonna get your wish.

157
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,462
My cell service just went out.

158
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,865
Jesus, can you believe
there's no service here?

159
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,633
How is that even possible?

160
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,136
Two of the things
i love most about west Texas,

161
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,038
no phones and no people.

162
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,843
Oh, come on.

163
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,174
Total jerks.
Are we rid of them?

164
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,410
India, don't do that.
What?

165
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,212
What? What'd she do?
She just gave 'em the finger.

166
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,883
Mom. Mom, I'm scared.
Tony.

167
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,352
Speed up.

168
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,421
It's all right,
it's all right.
No, I don't like this.

169
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,822
It's all right.

170
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,024
Speed up. Tony.

171
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,260
Shit. Oh, good.

172
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,829
Just let 'em go. Let 'em go.

173
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,935
India, don't look at them.

174
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,004
But, they're...
Just don't give
them any reason.

175
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,775
Why is he smiling like that?

176
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,278
I don't know,
sweetheart. It's all right.
It's all right.

177
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,552
Whoo!

178
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:08,453
He's crazy.

179
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,422
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

180
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,862
Shit.

181
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,203
Hey, motherfucker, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!

182
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,871
Oh, god, Tony.

183
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,482
India. Is your phone
working yet, India?

184
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,283
No, no, but I took down
the license number.

185
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,292
No.

186
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,231
No.

187
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,233
Oh, no.

188
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,772
Pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
Dad. Dad.

189
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,741
Hey, asshole, pull over.
Pull over.

190
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,345
Oh, no.
What do you
want from us?

191
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,413
Easy, easy. Easy, easy!

192
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,016
Stop it!

193
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,088
Shit.

194
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,424
Hey, come on!

195
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,381
Don't worry, honey. It's okay.

196
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,457
They probably
have a gun.

197
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,293
Please, Tony, pull out.

198
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,295
I can't move.
He's blocked the car.

199
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,364
What's he doing?

200
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,078
It's okay.
Don't get out the car.

201
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm not getting
out of the car, sweetheart.

202
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,591
Good evening.
Good evening.

203
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,426
You know you're supposed
to stop when there's
an accident, right?

204
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,229
Yeah, I know that.
Why didn't you stop, then?

205
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,766
That won't work.

206
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,770
No signal here.

207
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,340
You're not supposed to leave
the scene of an accident.
It's a crime.

208
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,776
After the way
you were driving...
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

209
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,112
Just the way you were
driving was crazy.

210
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,680
Hey, turk.

211
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,187
Don't come any closer.
All right, sweetheart.
It's all right.

212
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:59,190
You know, please just
get back in your car now
and leave us alone.

213
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,859
Calm down. We got
an accident to report,
that's all.

214
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,362
Calm down.
Hey, lady, lady, lady.
It's a flashlight, sweetheart.

215
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:07,732
It's just a flashlight.
It's all right.

216
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:11,736
Jesus Christ.
Okay, so let's
exchange information.

217
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,537
Information?
Yeah.

218
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,040
Let's exchange information.
Get it out of
the glove compartment.

219
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:19,076
Okay, I'm a gemini.
My favorite color's
pale pink.

220
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,379
I like long walks and kittens.

221
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,329
We should... you know what?
We should call the police.

222
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,098
Oh, oh? Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,500
That's a great idea.

224
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,902
It was your
fucking fault, right?
What?

225
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,571
It doesn't matter
whose fault it was.
Let's get going.

226
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,440
Hey, ray, these guys
have got a flat tire.

227
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,342
They sure do.
Well, what do you know?

228
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:55,279
What'd he say?
Don't believe it, dad.

229
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,181
- He said we had a flat tire.
- What did he say?

230
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,916
Don't believe him.
We don't have a flat.

231
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,355
What?
What?

232
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:06,857
Yep, your left tire's flat.
It sure is.

233
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,961
Must have bust it when
you were shoving us
off the road.

234
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,631
We did not shove you
off the road.
You shoved us off the road.

235
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,867
It's a lie.
You think I'm a liar?

236
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,302
It's okay. It's okay.

237
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,471
She's just a child.
You think I'm a liar?

238
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:23,341
No, she's not
saying that, man.
She's just a child.

239
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:30,047
You don't got a flat,
go on, drive.

240
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:33,117
Start the engine and drive.
Please drive. Just drive.

241
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,454
Just drive on it,
asshole. Nobody's
stopping you. Drive away.

242
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,389
Go. Fuck off.

243
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,291
Stupid motherfucker.

244
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:44,061
- Shit. God damn it!
- Oh, god. Oh, god.

245
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,330
Oh, god.
It's okay. It's all right.

246
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,833
It's not okay.
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

247
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:51,335
What are we gonna do, Tony?
What are we gonna do?

248
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,237
What are we gonna do, Tony?

249
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,473
I tell you what.

250
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,409
We'll fix it for you,
won't we, guys?

251
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,478
Yeah, sure.

252
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,647
Really?
Yeah.

253
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,750
Just to show you we're okay,
we'll fix it for you.

254
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,084
You won't have to do a thing.

255
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,854
Then we'll go
to the cops together, right?

256
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,423
You and me,
report your accident.
All right.

257
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:13,924
Thank you.
Sound good?

258
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,393
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

259
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,661
- You got tools, mister?
- Um, I actually, I...

260
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,764
No need. Use ours.
Come on, let's get going.

261
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,265
No, it's fine,
it's just fine.

262
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:24,769
I can't fix a tire,
so I can't...
I need their help.

263
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,404
Please don't make
eye contact with them.

264
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,116
You got a spare tire, man?

265
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,354
Can't change a tire
without a spare.

266
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,290
You wanna give me
the keys to the trunk?

267
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,592
No, don't.
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

268
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,695
Just pop the trunk, honey.

269
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,633
I got it.

270
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,568
That's all right, I got that.
That's fine.

271
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,304
It's right underneath here.
There you go.

272
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,473
Just right under there.

273
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,708
Just got a lot
of things in here.

274
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,750
It's just right under there.

275
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,586
Sorry.
Get the women
out of the car.

276
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,655
Come on, get 'em out.

277
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,825
Come on, man.

278
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,227
Gotta lift your car up
on the Jack, so get 'em out.

279
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,935
Dude. Has he gotta lift
your wife and your child
and the car?

280
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:33,003
Right, right.
Get your women out the car.

281
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:35,306
It's all right, honey.
Just get out of the car.
They need to fix the car.

282
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,809
They're fine.
They're just fixing the tire.

283
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,517
Come over here.

284
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,855
Come on, here.
Have you seen
what you did to my car?

285
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:54,859
You think you're fucking
hot shit, don't you?
What are you talking about?

286
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,760
They definitely think
they're fucking hot shit.

287
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,195
Who?
Are you serious?

288
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:01,532
Your bitches, man.
Who else?
Look...

289
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,802
No, you think you're
so special, you can just
bump another guy's car...

290
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:07,872
No, we were just trying
to get... you were playing
some kind of crazy game.

291
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,709
Hey!

292
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,983
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, god.

293
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:21,385
Oh, my...

294
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,292
There goes your cops.

295
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,296
You should have tried harder
to stop 'em.

296
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:35,065
That's okay. It's okay.
We'll take good care of you.

297
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,804
Fucking bitch.
Uppity rich bitch.

298
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,640
I'll teach you
a fucking thing or two.

299
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,644
It's okay.

300
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,817
What? What you looking at?

301
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,920
Hotshot.
What do you mean?

302
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,022
What are you trying
to do there on the road, huh?

303
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:00,824
What? I...
What are you talking about?

304
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,161
Look, look, look...

305
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:09,199
We... we are... we are
just trying to get where...
Where we are going.

306
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,401
Where's that?

307
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,505
I said where you going?
To marfa.

308
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,574
What exactly is in marfa?

309
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,610
Hey, motherfucker...
Hey!

310
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,378
Leave my
dad alone, asshole!
Leave me alone, man.

311
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,780
Fuck you, baby.

312
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,114
She didn't mean that.
She's just a kid.

313
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,950
Your daddy won't tell me,
so why don't you?

314
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:28,118
Let me go!
What's it to you anyway?

315
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,554
Look, we're nice guys.
Don't touch my daughter!

316
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,789
We're just trying to get
to where we're going.

317
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,727
You wanna dance? Wanna dance?

318
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,963
Oh, is that it? That all?

319
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,732
Baby, look at your daddy.
He thinks he's so much
better than me, huh?

320
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,467
What do you think?
What do you think?

321
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,736
Well, he is.
I mean, seriously,
look at him.

322
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,805
Let her go!

323
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,075
You're scum, you know!

324
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:53,043
No! No!
Hey! Hey, get off.

325
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,317
Hey, watch it,
you fucking assholes.

326
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,487
You got no fucking right
talking to me like that.

327
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:07,324
Christ's sake!
Fixing your goddamn tire.

328
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,560
Let's go and get
the fuck out of here, y'all.

329
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:10,995
India.

330
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,999
Don't cry, sweetie.
It's fine.

331
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,967
You all right over there?
Need a tissue?

332
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,739
God damn, that looks bad.
You might need...

333
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,941
I'm fine.
Hey, honey, you got a tampon?

334
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,110
Your nose looks like shit.
All right, I'm fine.

335
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:29,246
I mean it looks like shit.
I'm fine.

336
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,949
This is bad news. We good?

337
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,117
We're good. We're set.

338
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,351
- We're good to go.
- Let's go.

339
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,252
All right.
We're good.

340
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,754
All right.
Yeah.

341
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,025
How far up the road
till we can get a signal?

342
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,860
Why do you wanna get
further up the road?

343
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,795
So you can leave the scene
of an accident again?

344
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,764
Leave him alone.

345
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,203
There's service up by Bailey.
All right.

346
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,872
How do you think
we're gonna get there, though?

347
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:57,307
In our cars.
Which car?

348
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,143
In both cars.

349
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,612
Mister, don't try no fucking
shit with me.
What?

350
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:04,381
You heard me.
I know what you're doing.
I know what your plan is.

351
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,884
What is the matter?
Don't try no fucking
shit with me.

352
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:10,387
No, what is the matter, man?
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

353
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:13,957
How do I know you ain't
just gonna floor the gas
and leave me in the dust?

354
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,727
You get in your car
and we'll get in ours
and we'll follow you there.

355
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,229
Fuck you! No way.
You go in my car.
What?

356
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,665
You come with us.
Lou can drive your car.

357
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,801
No, I'm not gonna do that. No.

358
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:27,471
Okay, fine, you drive your car
and the girl comes with us.

359
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:29,840
- What? No!
- You come with us, baby.

360
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,842
Listen, honey, I ain't
after your fucking ass.

361
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,243
No, don't touch me.

362
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,645
You are not doing that.

363
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,418
Yeah, baby.
You like it like that, huh?
Let me go!

364
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,587
No. Hey, wait!

365
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,823
What are you doing?

366
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,191
Stop!
Get off her, please!

367
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:48,759
Go over there.

368
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,060
Get your hands off her!

369
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:51,662
India.

370
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:55,099
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
I love you.

371
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,101
India...

372
00:28:57,103 --> 00:29:00,170
- Let go of me, please.
- Get your hands off her.

373
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,205
Shit.

374
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,506
India...

375
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,509
Look what
you gone and did.

376
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,012
Hey, hey.
It's okay.

377
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,448
She the boss?
Is she the boss
of your family?

378
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,951
Laura?
Have you got a vagina?

379
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,919
Have you got
a fucking vagina there?

380
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,621
Hey!

381
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,189
- Laura!
- Vagina boy!

382
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,125
Just get her in the car.
Get her in the car.
Vagina boy!

383
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,527
Stay away!
You want fucking
something, boy?

384
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,394
- Tony.
- You want something?

385
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,863
- Tony.
- Laura.

386
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,465
- Get in the car.
- Okay, here we go.

387
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,201
We're goin' in both cars.
Hey, Lou.

388
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,202
No.

389
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,477
Dad. Dad.

390
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,045
Hey!
Dad. Dad.

391
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,914
Hey! Wait! No.

392
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:47,551
No! Please, no!
No! No! Please...

393
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,105
Susan?

394
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:10,607
Why didn't you call me
and let me know
you got in safely?

395
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,177
'Cause it's 4:00
in the morning.
I didn't wanna wake you.

396
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:16,079
<i> If you can't sleep,</i>
<i> why don't you take</i>
<i> one of your pills?</i>

397
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,081
Where are you?

398
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,751
I'm just walking
in the door of the hotel.

399
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:23,020
What floor, sir?
31, please.

400
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,521
That's not our usual floor.

401
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,859
No, our regular room
wasn't available.

402
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:31,495
<i> You should have seen</i>
<i> the scene I caused</i>
<i> in the lobby.</i>

403
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,301
I hope you got some sleep
on the plane.

404
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:40,270
<i> I do worry about you.</i>
<i> Even though you think</i>
<i> that I don't, I do.</i>

405
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,273
You must be exhausted.

406
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,776
I hate that flight.
It's really not...
31, madam.

407
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,448
<i> I'm at my floor.</i>
<i> I gotta run. I'll call you</i>
<i> later, okay? Susan?</i>

408
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,956
<i> Susan, can you hear me?</i>

409
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,962
Yes. Yes, I heard you.

410
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,967
Get some sleep.

411
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,093
You're driving.

412
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,107
Is this the exit?
Exit for what?

413
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,508
Well, for Bailey.
Keep going.

414
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,853
Keep going. Speed up.

415
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:15,799
What the fuck
are you doing to us?
Here. Turn down here.

416
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,535
No, fuck you.
I am not going down that road.

417
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,538
Listen, mister, you wanna
see your wife and kid?

418
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,375
Then turn down the road.

419
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,545
You gonna cry now?

420
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,012
That's my car we just passed.

421
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,081
It ain't your car, man.
Keep going.

422
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,085
I don't think you need
to worry about
your wife and kid.

423
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,090
Like I say, you don't
need to worry about them.

424
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:16,093
What do you mean, I don't
need to worry about them?
What the fuck does that mean?

425
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:19,129
Calm down.
He ain't never killed nobody
yet, that's all I mean.

426
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,098
Least as far
as I know he ain't.

427
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,866
Killed? What are you
talking about, killing?

428
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:25,635
I said he ain't
killed nobody yet.

429
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:28,171
If you'd listen to me,
you'd hear what I was saying.

430
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:59,970
Well, looks like
we've run out of road
and they ain't here.

431
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:02,472
I wonder if I made a mistake.

432
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,207
It's time for you
to get out now, okay?

433
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,311
Get out!
What are you...
What are you doing?

434
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,750
You'll get killed
if you don't watch it.
Wait.

435
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,919
Wait!

436
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,488
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait!

437
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,590
No! No!

438
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,377
What did you fucking
leave him out here for?

439
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,383
Hey, mister!

440
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,487
Your wife wants you!

441
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,791
Get in the fucking car.

442
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,394
Hey, mister! Your wife!

443
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,232
Mister!

444
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,568
Shit.

445
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,179
Hey.

446
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,850
Hey!

447
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,120
Hey! Hey!

448
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,103
Hey.

449
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,540
May I use your phone?

450
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,992
<i> Mr. Hastings,</i>
<i> there's no town</i>

451
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,594
near here called Bailey.

452
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:19,496
I was afraid of that.

453
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:22,465
There's a motel
across the street.
You got money?

454
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,602
I have...
I have credit cards.

455
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:28,405
It's still early,
Mr. Hastings.

456
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:31,508
But we'll call
if we get anything.

457
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,909
All right, thank you.

458
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,241
Hello?

459
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:41,811
<i> This is lieutenant graves.</i>

460
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:45,014
<i> They found your car</i>
<i> over in a dried-out arroyo</i>
<i> at topping.</i>

461
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:48,184
What about my wife
and daughter?
<i> Still no news.</i>

462
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,754
<i> They weren't in the car.</i>

463
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:53,823
<i> We're turning the case</i>
<i> over to lieutenant andes.</i>

464
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,426
<i> He wants to know if he can</i>
<i> pick you up in a few minutes.</i>

465
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:57,994
Yeah, I'm ready now.

466
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,010
Morning.
Oh, glad to meet you.

467
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:17,614
I'm Bobby andes.
I look into things
around here.

468
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,083
You found my car?
They found it in a creek bed.

469
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,623
Tell you what, we take you
back to the house
we picked you up at,

470
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,891
you think you could backtrack
from there?

471
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,592
I could try.

472
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,463
Okay, then, you try. Let's go.

473
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,939
It's my understanding
these fellas didn't have
any guns.

474
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,275
No.

475
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,980
All right.

476
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,650
So let me get this straight,
you say some fella named Lou

477
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,752
just drove you out
into the brush
and left you there?

478
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,888
No, he made me drive.
He made you drive.

479
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,392
And then when you
started to walk out,
you saw 'em coming in again.

480
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:05,328
Yes.
Hmm. Whose car were they in?

481
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,230
I think it was mine.

482
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:10,099
You think?
What makes you think that?

483
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:13,236
By the look of it
and the sound of it.
It sounded like my car.

484
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:14,737
Could you see 'em in the dark?

485
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,844
Not very well.
Did they say anything?

486
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:23,580
They said,
"mister, your wife wants you."

487
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,185
You didn't go to 'em.
Why didn't you go to 'em?

488
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,757
I don't know
why I didn't go. I was...

489
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,870
Okay.

490
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,438
Can you take it from here?

491
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,543
Yeah, I came down the highway
and I walked for a long time,

492
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:55,612
'cause no one stopped for me.

493
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,483
Sergeant, back up slowly
down the shoulder.

494
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,552
Put your signal lights on.

495
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,403
Stop the car.
Stop the car!

496
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,639
I came out of that barbwire
fence right there.

497
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,074
Right by the reflector.
I remember that.

498
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,810
Let's get out and walk.
You said you walked out,
right?

499
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,817
I came up...
I came up right here,

500
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,754
'cause I walked along
that arroyo over there.

501
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:40,089
This is part
of the old valdes place.

502
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,925
There's an old cattle station
down that way a bit

503
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,526
next to where
they burn their garbage.

504
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,428
This road leads to it.

505
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,986
Is she all right?

506
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,350
<i> Mom? Is that you?</i>
<i> Is everything all right?</i>

507
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:17,587
<i> Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i> it's fine. I just wanted</i>
<i> to hear your voice.</i>

508
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:20,590
I miss you.

509
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:24,360
<i> You woke me up.</i>
<i> I'm still in bed.</i>
<i> It's Sunday morning, mom.</i>

510
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:26,929
<i> Can I call you later?</i>

511
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:30,166
Yeah. Yeah, call me later.
Go back to bed, sweetheart.

512
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,936
You sound weird. Are you okay?

513
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,708
I'm fine. I'm fine.

514
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,878
Go back to bed.

515
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,279
I love you.

516
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:45,114
Me too.

517
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:47,617
<i> I'll call you later.</i>
Okay.

518
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,813
<i> Edward? Edward?</i>

519
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,415
Hi.
Susan.

520
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:21,250
Hi. God.
How are you?

521
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:24,320
It's good to see
someone I know.
It's good to see you.

522
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,925
You look beautiful, as always.

523
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:32,495
What are you doing
in New York City?

524
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:36,499
I'm here for an interview
for a scholarship at Columbia.

525
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:39,001
Columbia?
I thought that you were at
the university of Texas

526
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:40,837
becoming a great writer.

527
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,706
A great writer? I mean,
i don't... I don't think so.

528
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,341
Well, I am...

529
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,345
But aren't you at Yale
becoming a great artist?

530
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:52,548
Graduated Yale,
but I'm at Columbia
getting my master's degree.

531
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,450
Oh, wow.
Yeah, art history.

532
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:56,619
That's great.
Yeah.

533
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:58,621
Listen, do you know
anybody else in New York?

534
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,125
Just you.
Just me.

535
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,860
Okay, well, would you like
to go to dinner?

536
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:07,530
Absolutely.
Okay.

537
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:12,635
Okay, great. Just let me...
Just let me drop off
my packages at my apartment.

538
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:14,737
All right, do you want me
to grab them for you?
I can hold that.

539
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:16,973
Yeah, great. Thank you.
Oh... I miss Texas men.

540
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:18,708
You don't have blizzards
like this in Texas.

541
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,809
No, you don't.

542
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:38,661
You know that you
were my first crush
when we were at Hastings?

543
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:42,165
I only spent so much time
around your brother
just to be around you.

544
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,000
Well, you were
his first crush.

545
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,336
What?
Yeah.

546
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,672
Well, I had no idea
Cooper was gay.

547
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:53,176
I don't think
he knew back then,
but he was obsessed with you.

548
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:53,976
Mmm.

549
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,780
Wow.
Yeah.

550
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,916
If I hadn't caught you
staring at me so much,

551
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:02,318
I would have thought
you were sleeping with him.

552
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,688
I, actually...
I feel terrible.

553
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,024
I haven't called him
in a few years.

554
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:11,427
I feel like
I've been a bad friend.
I hope I didn't hurt him.

555
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,631
You're good, you know that?

556
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:17,867
No, you are. Most guys
would have freaked out

557
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,602
if they found out
their best friend
was in love with them.

558
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,003
You're very sweet.

559
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,876
You should call him.
He would like that.

560
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,445
My parents have basically
disowned him.

561
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:31,647
They're not really
talking anymore.

562
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:34,283
Why?
Why? Are you serious?

563
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,886
Well, you know
my parents, right?

564
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:40,223
They're religious,
conservative, sexist, racist,

565
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:44,627
republican, materialistic,
narcissistic, racist.

566
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:48,464
I could keep going...
I'm just wondering
what you really think, Susan.

567
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:49,832
It's true, I know.

568
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:53,069
But they just see us
as a reflection of themselves,

569
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:56,072
so they can't accept Cooper
for who he is.

570
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:59,141
I'm not sure
how I'm gonna fare.

571
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:00,977
Aren't you being
a little hard on them?

572
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,579
No.

573
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:06,515
They have an antiquated idea
of how I should live my life.

574
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,084
Especially my mother.

575
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,421
I understand.
I've always loved your mom.

576
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,257
Really?
Oh, yeah.

577
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:16,325
She was great with me
when my dad died.

578
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,427
Mmm.

579
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:21,097
You both have the same kind
of sadness in your eyes.

580
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,434
What?
You and your mother.

581
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,105
That is a weird thing
to say, Edward.

582
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:31,107
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to offend you.

583
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:34,176
I just... she just
always seemed sad to me.

584
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,613
She has sad eyes.

585
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:39,682
And I've thought that
since I was a little boy.

586
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:41,684
You have the same eyes.

587
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:47,456
They're beautiful.

588
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,368
Just don't say
I'm like my mom, okay?
I don't wanna be like her.

589
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,141
It's funny, 'cause
i always envied your family.

590
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:08,544
I felt like
such an impostor at school.

591
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:11,580
You did? I thought
i was the only one
who felt like that.

592
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,149
You?
Yeah.

593
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,318
I was so busy
trying to be perfect and...

594
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,987
And you don't feel that way?
No.

595
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,556
That's exactly
what makes you so perfect.

596
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,227
You are gonna be
a great novelist,

597
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:29,332
'cause you have created
a fictitious character
in your head about...

598
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:30,499
No.
Yes.

599
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,234
No.
Yes.

600
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:33,502
No.

601
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,138
I don't believe that.

602
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:40,309
Why'd you give up
on becoming an artist?

603
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,017
Because I'm too cynical
to be an artist.

604
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,852
I think that to be
really, really good,

605
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:54,023
you have to come
from someplace inside
that I'm just not sure I have.

606
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:55,658
You underestimate yourself.

607
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,996
Do you know that?

608
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,271
Edward, um,

609
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,776
will you come home with me?

610
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,381
Well, that's a bit forward.

611
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:20,149
Yeah.

612
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:22,284
It's not what I'd expect
from a Texas debutante.

613
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,787
Well, you know
all debutantes
are sluts, so...

614
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:26,455
Hmm.

615
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:27,790
Hmm.
Hmm.

616
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,626
And you were
my first crush too.

617
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,462
I know.

618
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,592
We got a report
from ozona.

619
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:06,996
Someone else harassed
on the highway last night
just like you.

620
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,771
If you don't mind,
we could use
your fingerprints.

621
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:17,239
Mine?

622
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,175
There's just a bunch of prints
on the trunk of the car.

623
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:20,409
It could help us
sort 'em out.

624
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,016
There's something else.

625
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,018
Yeah?

626
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,786
We have the cause of death.

627
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:39,795
Your wife had
a fractured skull.

628
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:43,199
She was probably struck
with a hammer
or a baseball bat,

629
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:44,967
probably just once
or twice, so...

630
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:50,039
Your daughter had
a much more difficult time.

631
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,274
She was suffocated.

632
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,813
She also had
a broken arm.

633
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,485
And they had
both been raped.

634
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,825
It turns out you were right
about that trailer, too.

635
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,061
How?

636
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:13,829
Those fellas,
they took your folks
in there,

637
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,064
just like you thought.

638
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,567
How do you know that?

639
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:20,636
We found your wife's
fingerprints on the bedpost.

640
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:25,441
Whose trailer is it?
It's clear.

641
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:28,344
Guy doesn't even live here.
He's in El Paso.

642
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:31,180
Trailer's been broken into.
Somebody's been living in it.

643
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:32,681
There's prints
all over the place.

644
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,116
We're gonna have to check 'em
against the owner's,

645
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:36,018
see if we can
separate 'em out.

646
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,686
Right.
I'm hopeful, though.

647
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,421
The owner hasn't been there
since last fall, so...

648
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:42,758
Looks promising.

649
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,164
Prom...

650
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,600
Promising?

651
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,615
<i> Why didn't</i>
<i> you tell me this before?</i>

652
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:09,385
<i> You're actually gonna</i>
<i> leave New York,</i>

653
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:12,454
move to Austin and go
to the goddamn
university of Texas?

654
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:14,790
Why are you doing this?

655
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,459
I mean,
where is this gonna go?

656
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:19,128
What do you mean,
where is this going to go?

657
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,330
I'm going to marry Edward.
That's where this
is going to go.

658
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:22,965
This is a ridiculous
conversation.

659
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,301
You're too young
to get married.

660
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,337
Really?

661
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:31,907
Mom, last summer you tried
to convince me that I had
to marry bass.

662
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,475
That is different.

663
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,512
Bass is your equal.

664
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:39,181
Oh, my god.
Did you just say that?
You really just said that.

665
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:41,250
That came out
of your mouth.
That's...

666
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,554
Why do you always think
the worst of me?

667
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:51,093
That is not what I meant.

668
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:56,665
What I meant
is that you are very
strong-willed,

669
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,702
and Edward,
as sweet as he is,
he's too weak for you.

670
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:03,005
Weak is not a word
that I would use
to describe Edward.

671
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,873
Sensitive is a word
that I would use,

672
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,876
which isn't a word I would use
to describe anyone else
in this family,

673
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:09,278
except maybe Cooper.

674
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,579
Don't bring Cooper
into this.

675
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:12,448
Sorry.

676
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,351
Come on, Susan.

677
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:18,787
I know you think
that we don't care
about the same things,

678
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:21,123
but you're wrong.

679
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:24,293
In a few years,
all these bourgeois things,
as you so like to call them,

680
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:26,562
are gonna be
very important to you,

681
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:28,364
and Edward's not gonna be able
to give them to you.

682
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:31,700
He has no money.

683
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,305
He's not driven.
He's not ambitious.

684
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,708
And I can promise you,
if you marry Edward,

685
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,277
your father's not gonna
give them to you either.

686
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,480
No, you're right.
He's not driven

687
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:46,315
the way that you
would like him to be.

688
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,485
But he is strong.

689
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:51,987
He's stronger than I am
in a lot of ways.

690
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:55,591
Just... he just has
a different kind
of strength is all.

691
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:57,593
"A different kind
of strength."

692
00:54:57,595 --> 00:55:00,162
And what kind
of strength is that?

693
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:03,465
He has the strength
to believe in himself

694
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:05,968
and believe in me.

695
00:55:07,837 --> 01:50:15,673
Susan,

696
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,007
keep seeing him
if you have to,

697
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:13,108
live with him,
i don't care,

698
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,111
but do not marry him.

699
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:20,182
I understand
what you see in Edward.
I get it.

700
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:21,917
No.
No, wait, I do.

701
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:23,919
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

702
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:25,854
He is a romantic.

703
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:29,358
But he is also
very fragile.

704
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,693
I saw that
when his father died.

705
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:34,263
Don't...

706
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:36,765
Don't do this.

707
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:40,369
You'll regret it.

708
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,039
And you'll only hurt Edward
in the end.

709
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,478
The things you love
about him now are
the things you'll hate

710
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,546
in a few years.

711
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,783
You may not realize it,

712
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:58,620
but you and i
are a lot more alike
than you think.

713
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:05,694
No. You're wrong.
You and I are nothing alike.

714
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:07,796
Really?

715
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:11,567
Just wait.

716
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,537
We all eventually
turn into our mothers.

717
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,748
<i> Yeah?</i>
Tony Hastings?

718
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,952
Yes. Who is this?

719
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:07,856
Roberto andes.
I've sent you an email.
You get it?

720
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:08,957
Yes.

721
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,259
Well, you recognize the guy?

722
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:12,861
No.
<i> Shit.</i>

723
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,798
God damn it.
You sure?

724
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,567
Yeah. The whole thing's
just a blur.

725
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:20,803
<i> Well, his prints</i>
<i> are all over your car.</i>

726
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:23,639
They found 'em
at the trailer too.
His name's Steve Adams.

727
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:25,974
<i> He's got a record</i>
<i> in California.</i>
<i> A stolen car,</i>

728
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:28,811
acquittal on a rape charge.
I put out an apb on him.

729
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:30,813
<i> He's the only lead</i>
<i> we got, Tony,</i>

730
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:32,648
and I sure as hell don't have
any other witnesses.

731
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,318
<i> You sure</i>
<i> you don't recognize him?</i>

732
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,488
No.

733
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,989
Fuck. What's wrong
with you, man?

734
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,591
<i> Don't you wanna put</i>
<i> these guys away?</i>

735
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:43,892
Yeah, of course I do.

736
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,728
The whole thing
is just some...

737
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,165
Just a blank.

738
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:12,287
I know it was him.

739
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,590
<i> Well, that may be,</i>
<i> but nobody's seen him</i>
<i> around here lately.</i>

740
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:16,024
<i> Listen, I gotta be</i>
<i> honest with you.</i>

741
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:18,093
<i> Right now</i>
<i> it's not looking good.</i>

742
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:21,630
<i> Sometimes these cases</i>
<i> go months or even years</i>
<i> without a break.</i>

743
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:23,365
<i> You need to prepare</i>
<i> yourself for that.</i>

744
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,576
<i> Why are you</i>
<i> so driven to write?</i>

745
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,413
<i> I guess it's a way</i>
<i> of keeping things alive.</i>

746
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,085
<i> You know, saving things</i>
<i> that will eventually die.</i>

747
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,889
<i> And if I write</i>
<i> it down, then,</i>

748
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:23,659
<i> it'll last forever.</i>

749
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,123
Afternoon.
Hey, there.

750
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,192
Sorry I'm late.
There was traffic
on the interstate.

751
00:59:57,194 --> 00:59:58,427
That's all right.

752
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,729
You look different.

753
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:01,863
No beard.

754
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,801
You look...
You look different too.

755
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,572
Yeah. So I'll tell you
what we got.

756
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:12,407
We had an attempted hold-up

757
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:15,644
at the supermarket
in the mall last night
just before closing.

758
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,079
We caught one
of the guys,

759
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:19,047
one got killed
and one got away.

760
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,817
What do you,
what do you want me to do?

761
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,987
See if you recognize
the guy we caught.

762
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,156
You can look
at the dead one too,

763
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:30,325
although I don't really
think it's necessary.

764
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,160
We know who he is.

765
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:33,228
Who?

766
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,564
Steve Adams.

767
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:40,068
The one you called turk
that I emailed you
about last year?

768
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:47,643
Come on in.

769
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,351
Are you afraid to look
this fella in the eye?
Let him see you?

770
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:57,419
No.

771
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,322
That's good.
I think it will
help him talk.

772
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,605
That's him,
that guy on the left.

773
01:01:16,607 --> 01:01:17,939
On the far left.
That's him.

774
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,879
No,
no, no, no, no,
no. Hold up, son.

775
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:25,547
You ain't that lucky.
Get over here.

776
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:31,286
This fella?
Yes.

777
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:34,322
I see. Right.
I don't think
he understands.

778
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:36,792
Lou. Lou. Hey, you.

779
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,462
Your name Lou?
You know my name.
I told you.

780
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:41,897
Yeah?
Yeah. What's going on?

781
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,903
Well, I guess I want you
to tell me if you've ever
seen this man before.

782
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,139
Think carefully.
You ever seen him?

783
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,477
No, I don't know him.

784
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:56,845
Hmm?
Who is he?

785
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:59,748
Why don't you tell him, Tony?
Tell him who he is.

786
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,683
Last summer, this man,
Lou, and his friends,

787
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:03,652
they forced us off the road
on the interstate

788
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:06,922
and two of them
forced their way into my car
with my wife and my daughter.

789
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:09,825
And then this man...
This man? This man Lou?

790
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:12,160
Yes. Lou, he made me
drive his car,

791
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:14,096
he took me to the middle
of the desert
and he left me there.

792
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:17,099
And later my wife
and daughter
were found dead

793
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,568
near the same place.

794
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,340
Well, that ain't right.

795
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:38,019
What you got to say
about this man's
wife and daughter?

796
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:39,287
I don't know
nothing about that.

797
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,456
I've never seen him
before in my life.

798
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,125
What you gonna tell me
about ray and turk?

799
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,260
Who?
Who?

800
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:51,800
What, are you an owl?
You an owl, Lou?

801
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:53,702
I never heard of 'em.
You never heard of 'em?

802
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,537
No, sir.

803
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,209
Hmm.

804
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:02,878
Mmm-hmm.

805
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:09,551
All right.

806
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,223
Officer.

807
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,958
Put him up.

808
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,899
Are you sure
this is the man?
Absolutely, yes.

809
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:26,334
You'll swear in a court of law
under penalty of perjury?

810
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:27,402
Yes.

811
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,242
Good.

812
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,914
Well, we got Lou.

813
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,950
I'm gonna charge him
with murder.

814
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:43,618
What, do you have
enough evidence?

815
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,755
Oh, you bet,
between you and the prints
in the car and the trailer.

816
01:03:46,757 --> 01:03:48,857
What, he went back
to the trailer
after he left me?

817
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:52,093
Yeah, looks like it.
Uh, he probably just went back
to tell 'em where you were.

818
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,930
That's why they came back
with the bodies.

819
01:03:54,932 --> 01:03:56,665
They were,
they were gonna kill you.

820
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,868
You see? Yeah.

821
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,437
I bet your friend Ray's
the third fella
in the hold-up.

822
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:07,108
What now?
Well, you're gonna
wait for trial.

823
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,113
And I'm gonna go find ray.

824
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:22,390
Don't forget you have
a board meeting
at the museum at 3:00.

825
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,393
I'm sorry. What was that?

826
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,067
You didn't sleep again,
did you?

827
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,807
You know me.
I never sleep.

828
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,578
My ex-husband
used to call me
a nocturnal animal.

829
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,046
What ex-husband?

830
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:48,516
I didn't know
you had an ex-husband.
Since when?

831
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:50,418
A couple of years
in graduate school.

832
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:54,923
It's weird,
I've been thinking
about him a lot lately,

833
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:57,259
and then recently
he sent me this book
that he's written

834
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:58,059
and it's

835
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,329
violent and it's sad,

836
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:04,332
and he titled it
<i> nocturnal animals</i>
and he dedicated it to me.

837
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:07,502
Did you love him?

838
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:08,737
Yeah, I loved him.

839
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:14,109
He was a writer and, uh,
i didn't have faith in him.

840
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,779
I panicked
and I did something
horrible to him.

841
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:19,781
Something unforgivable,
really.

842
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:23,018
You left him?
I left him.

843
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,122
I left him in a brutal way,

844
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:31,059
for the handsome
and dashing hutton.

845
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:33,461
Who is very handsome
and dashing.
...And dashing. Yes.

846
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:37,232
Do you ever feel like
your life has turned
into something

847
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:38,199
you never intended?

848
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,243
No.

849
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:48,777
Of course not.
You just started
living your life.

850
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,215
You really didn't get
any sleep, did you?

851
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,054
No.

852
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,271
Where did
this painting come from?

853
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:52,540
What do you mean,
where did it come from?

854
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:54,442
You bought it for us,
remember?

855
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,478
It was part of the series
like eight years ago.

856
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,213
It's great, isn't it?
Yeah.

857
01:06:58,215 --> 01:07:00,815
What is that?

858
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:03,051
Oh, my god,
it's so cool.

859
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:06,821
It's this app
that lets me watch Willow
while she's in her crib.

860
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:09,624
Really? Do you not
trust your nanny?

861
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,793
No, no, I do.
I just hate her, so...

862
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:12,961
And I would like
to be more involved

863
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:14,229
with Willow
throughout the day, so...

864
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:18,466
Look. There she is.

865
01:07:18,468 --> 01:07:21,069
And the sound's incredible.
You can actually hear
her breathing.

866
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:21,436
And I can talk to her
if I want to.

867
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:28,376
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm...

868
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,012
Are you okay?
Yeah.

869
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:32,247
Yeah, I just...

870
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:34,983
I thought I saw someone.

871
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,154
Well, you did see someone.

872
01:07:39,156 --> 01:07:40,822
That's Willow
and she's in her crib.

873
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:42,590
She's sleeping.

874
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:46,361
I'm really sorry
about your phone.
I can, um...

875
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,829
It's fine. A new one comes out
next week anyway, so...

876
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:48,897
Thanks.

877
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:50,999
Shall we?

878
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:53,435
They're all
waiting for us.

879
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,709
We're under
no contractual obligations.
Which is good.

880
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:03,945
I know we all have different,
you know, opinions about this,

881
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:05,246
but as far as I'm concerned...

882
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,625
Anyways,
i think we should
cut her loose.

883
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,627
She isn't who she sold herself
to be when we hired her.

884
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,896
I disagree.
I think we should keep her
for now.

885
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:24,632
Why is that?
Because she's great
and we all like her.

886
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:27,202
She just needs our support
and a little bit of time,
that's all.

887
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:29,804
- But it's not working.
- We need to fire her.

888
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:31,639
There's an awesome candidate
that we could steal
from the hammer

889
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,641
if we move fast.

890
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:36,945
I agree with Linda.
We hired her.
We should support her.

891
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:38,480
New doctor?

892
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,118
No. New haircut.

893
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,088
But, Susan, you were the one
who brought it up last meeting

894
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,157
that you were
looking for a change.

895
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,992
I know, but now I think
we should keep her.

896
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:52,961
Sometimes it's...

897
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,433
Sometimes maybe
it's not such a good idea

898
01:08:58,435 --> 01:08:59,901
to change things
quite so much.

899
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,681
I don't get it.
What are we doing here?

900
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:20,982
Shit.

901
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,420
Are you okay?

902
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:30,391
Yeah. I'm fine.
Follow me.

903
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,438
That's ray Marcus.

904
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,373
He's been named
as a frequent companion

905
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:46,941
of Lou bates and Steve Adams.

906
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,178
Part-time electrician,
part-time plumber,

907
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:52,714
hence the clever
toilet facilities.

908
01:10:52,716 --> 01:10:54,449
He's not a bad match
to your description

909
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:56,718
and the fella at the hold-up.

910
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,220
No fingerprints,
but we knew that before.

911
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:01,289
I wonder why there aren't
any fingerprints.

912
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,857
Well, his hands
were probably on your wife.

913
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:09,631
His record's clean,
except for a rape charge
that got dropped.

914
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:11,966
I heard from this barman
at this place, line camp bar,

915
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:14,135
that ray lives here
with a girl named Leila

916
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:15,370
but he also keeps another spot

917
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:17,305
to take girls
she don't know about,

918
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:19,607
probably your murder trailer
before it got notorious.

919
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:24,379
Does he look like
he could be the guy?

920
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:26,214
Yes, that's him.

921
01:11:26,216 --> 01:11:27,282
Good.

922
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:29,617
Let's talk to him.

923
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,500
Hey, ray.
What the fuck?

924
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:47,568
Who the hell are you?

925
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,570
Get off my property, man.

926
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:53,675
Shit, I'll call you back.

927
01:11:53,677 --> 01:11:54,909
I wanna ask you
some questions.

928
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,411
Fuck you.

929
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,746
I'm occupied at the moment.

930
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,518
What's that?
Just a few
questions, that's all.

931
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,422
We need you to come with us.
What for?
I ain't done nothin'.

932
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:09,957
I ain't saying you did.
Well, ask me here.

933
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:12,694
No, we need you
to take a little drive
with us.

934
01:12:12,696 --> 01:12:14,796
Come on, finish up
what you're doing
and let's go.

935
01:12:14,798 --> 01:12:15,596
Do you mind turning round?

936
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,269
Believe me,
i wish I could, but...

937
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,040
Fucking unbelievable.

938
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:35,116
All right,
that's enough. Come on.

939
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:36,884
Come on, now.

940
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,655
All right, come on.
Get dressed. Come on.

941
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,733
- You questioning me?
- Yeah.

942
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:54,135
Yeah, that's what
we're doing, ain't it?
You ain't read me my rights.

943
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:03,144
You know your rights, ray.
You're supposed
to read 'em to me.

944
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,981
I read you your rights,
didn't I, Tony?

945
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,418
Uh-huh.

946
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,253
I read you your rights.

947
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:14,422
This ain't legal, man.
I'm supposed to have
a lawyer or something.

948
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:16,090
Calm down, sunshine.

949
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:19,193
This is just
informal questioning,
that's all.

950
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:21,929
You're helping me out.
I ain't charged you
with nothing yet.

951
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,532
Now, if you want a lawyer,
i can take you down
to the station

952
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:26,000
and charge you with something.

953
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,603
Oh, come on, man, listen,
you ain't gotta take me in.

954
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:30,271
I'm answering
the questions, ain't I?
Come on.

955
01:13:30,273 --> 01:13:33,274
Give me some questions.
I'll answer your questions.

956
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:35,610
I don't know any more
about this hold-up
than I did before I met you.

957
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:36,778
I tell you what,

958
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:37,945
I'm gonna ask you
a different question.

959
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:41,015
You recognize this car?
What car?

960
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:43,451
This one. The one
we're driving around in.

961
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:45,186
Why should I recognize
this fucking car?

962
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:46,687
It ain't familiar to you?

963
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,456
It don't remind you
of nothing,
take you back?

964
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,792
Why should it?
You don't remember driving it?

965
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:53,694
I think I'd know.
Yeah. How about the driver?

966
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:55,396
What?
This fella?

967
01:13:55,398 --> 01:13:57,965
This fella sitting behind
the steering wheel.
My friend Tony?

968
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,200
You remember him?

969
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:05,139
I can't see him.
Make him turn around.

970
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,375
Stop the car, Tony.

971
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,115
Turn around and look
at this piece of shit.

972
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,554
Who is this guy?
You don't remember him?

973
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:24,158
Can't say I do.
You remember him, Tony?

974
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,594
Yes.
Well, refresh his memory.

975
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:28,162
Last summer on the interstate.

976
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:30,331
Tell him what you
remember he did.

977
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,400
You killed my wife
and my daughter.

978
01:14:32,402 --> 01:14:34,669
That's crazy.
I never killed nobody.

979
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:37,171
- Tell him the whole thing.
- Mmm-mmm.

980
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:39,841
You and your buddies
on the interstate,
you forced us off the road.

981
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:41,676
- Tell him who his buddies are.
- Lou and turk.

982
01:14:41,678 --> 01:14:43,444
You remember that, ray?

983
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:44,846
You remember horsing around
on the interstate
with your buddies,

984
01:14:44,848 --> 01:14:46,247
playing chicken
with the other cars?

985
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:49,016
You're crazy. That's crazy.

986
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:52,086
You made us stop
and we had a flat tire
and Lou and turk fixed it.

987
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:54,355
Then you and turk
got in my car
with my wife and my daughter

988
01:14:54,357 --> 01:14:57,625
and you forced me
in your car with Lou.
What then, Tony?

989
01:14:57,627 --> 01:14:59,260
Lou took me out into the brush
and kicked me out.

990
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:02,530
And you came back in my car

991
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:04,599
and you called out for me,
trying to lure me
into your trap.

992
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:07,301
You came back
where Lou had left me

993
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:08,936
oh, is that why
you went back there, ray?

994
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:19,447
You're fucking crazy!
Tell him what
we found there, Tony.

995
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:23,351
You tell him.
Do I have to?
Don't you know, ray?

996
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,723
Y'all are crazy. It's crazy.

997
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:31,058
The bodies
of my wife and child

998
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:35,897
which you took
back there and dumped.

999
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,801
You're the one. I know you.

1000
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,838
What do you say, ray?

1001
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,407
You're crazy.
You're making
a big mistake.

1002
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:49,143
Mmm.
I don't think so.

1003
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:52,747
I don't think so, ray.
Put your hands out
in front of you.

1004
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:55,182
You got no right.
Got no right?

1005
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:57,752
Rights, rights, rights.
You and your goddamn rights.

1006
01:15:57,754 --> 01:15:59,587
Speaking of rights,
i just wanna let you know

1007
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:01,422
I'm recording
this entire conversation.

1008
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,258
There. You clear?

1009
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,927
Mmm-hmm.
All right, let's go, Tony.

1010
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:12,099
Now, we're going
to a place you might remember,

1011
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:14,602
and you can help yourself out
by telling me about it.

1012
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:16,437
But if you don't remember,

1013
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:19,273
Tony does, all right?

1014
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:21,609
Hey, I'm sorry
you lost your folks, man.

1015
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:24,679
It's a shame.
But I didn't have
nothin' to do with it.

1016
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,467
What's this place?
You know this place.

1017
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:48,970
Honest to god, I don't.
You wanna get out, Tony?

1018
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:50,738
Shall we have
a look inside, ray?
What for?

1019
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,706
Come on,
let's take a look.

1020
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,623
All right,
all right.

1021
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:16,097
Oh, you raped them
on the bed, I suppose.

1022
01:17:16,099 --> 01:17:18,099
I never raped nobody.
Stop fucking around, ray.

1023
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:20,401
We seen your record.
We know about
that girl in lubbock.

1024
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:22,903
The charges were dropped.
I never raped nobody.

1025
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:23,738
I wanna know, ray.

1026
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:27,842
I wanna know the exact story,
what you did to them.

1027
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,813
You'll have to ask
somebody else.
I wanna know what they said.

1028
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,685
I wanna know what my wife said

1029
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:39,020
and I wanna know
what my daughter said.

1030
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,032
I wanna know
how you killed them.

1031
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:54,802
And I wanna know if they knew
it was happening to them.

1032
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:56,270
I wanna know what they felt!

1033
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:01,776
I wanna know if they hurt.

1034
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:06,781
Answer me!

1035
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:09,884
Answer me!

1036
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:15,389
Answer me,
you fucking bastard!

1037
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,308
Is it better?

1038
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:39,246
You're gonna take this
the wrong way, but, um,

1039
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,549
I think that you
should write about something
other than yourself.

1040
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:48,255
Nobody writes about anything
but themselves.

1041
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:50,157
I just, my mind started
to wander when
i was reading it,

1042
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,660
and that's not good, right?

1043
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:53,761
I don't know what to do.
Maybe, you know,

1044
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:55,362
maybe I don't have
a book in me.

1045
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:57,932
Maybe give yourself
some space.
Just do something else.

1046
01:18:57,934 --> 01:18:59,667
Can you not do that?
What?

1047
01:18:59,669 --> 01:19:01,168
Because it...
That makes me feel like
you don't believe in me.

1048
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:04,004
Edward,
that's not what I said.
No, you didn't say that.

1049
01:19:04,006 --> 01:19:05,272
But you're saying it
with your face

1050
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:07,208
and you're saying it
when you sigh.

1051
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:09,443
Whatever, you're saying it
when you say you want me
to go back to school.

1052
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:10,945
Well, yeah, I do want you
to go back to school.

1053
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:12,046
I don't see
what's wrong with that.

1054
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:13,781
I mean,
I'm just being a realist.

1055
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:16,617
I mean, you're gonna
work at a book store
and just write a novel,

1056
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:17,618
like that's what
you wanna do
with your life?

1057
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:25,292
I mean,
that's really romantic, but,
like, what? This is it?

1058
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:27,027
This is it? This is what...
You sound like your mother.

1059
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:34,368
Well, you always said
that I reminded you
so much of her, so...

1060
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,470
You know, this is exactly why
i don't wanna read your work

1061
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,305
because you always get
so fucking defensive.

1062
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:40,374
Yeah, of course I'm defensive!

1063
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:43,477
Do you know what it feels like
to put yourself out
on the line creatively

1064
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:46,814
and then have someone
you love tell you that
they don't understand it?

1065
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,649
No, I don't,
because I'm not creative...

1066
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:50,050
That's because
you choose not to be.

1067
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:56,390
I don't wanna fight.
I'm tired and I'm edgy.

1068
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:59,460
I've been writing all night.
I just wanted you to like it,
all right?

1069
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,003
Thanks.

1070
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:21,849
<i> I got some news</i>
<i> you're not gonna like.</i>

1071
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:25,085
They're letting ray Marcus go.

1072
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:27,922
<i> What? What do you mean,</i>
<i> they're letting him go?</i>

1073
01:20:27,924 --> 01:20:30,257
The d.A. Says we don't have
enough hard evidence,

1074
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:31,826
what we have
is circumstantial.

1075
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:34,161
He needs corroboration.

1076
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,166
I'm real sorry, Tony.

1077
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:42,203
It's a goddamn shame.

1078
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,207
At least you got to lay
a good belt on him.

1079
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:48,876
<i> No, that's not enough.</i>
<i> What else can we do?</i>

1080
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:51,879
I can think of something.

1081
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:54,882
You'd better get
here quick, though.

1082
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:56,217
He ain't gonna
stick around for long.

1083
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:58,719
<i> Okay, all right,</i>
<i> I'm leaving now.</i>

1084
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:03,624
What?

1085
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:08,529
I told you,
i got lung cancer.
It's metastasized.

1086
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:14,068
But you smoke all the time.
Yeah, well,
that's how it works.

1087
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,237
What's the point
in quitting now?
I'll be dead in a year.

1088
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,172
It's this fella named jenks.

1089
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:20,174
He's the lawyer
the court appointed for ray.

1090
01:21:20,176 --> 01:21:22,977
He's a little smartass
from Dallas.

1091
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:25,746
He and the d.A. Made a deal
and ray got off. Politics.

1092
01:21:25,748 --> 01:21:28,015
When did you tell me
you were sick?

1093
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:30,150
See, they're trying
to force me out.

1094
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:32,519
They already got another fella
lined up for the job.

1095
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:33,821
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1096
01:21:33,823 --> 01:21:35,589
They'd drop a murder case
to do that?

1097
01:21:35,591 --> 01:21:40,361
Oh, yeah.
Give 'em the reason,
ammunition.

1098
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:43,998
They said my case
wasn't well-prepared,
was a sloppy job, slapdash,

1099
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,001
no evidence and evidence
improperly gathered,

1100
01:21:47,003 --> 01:21:48,002
won't stand up in court.

1101
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:53,674
The d.A.'S too much
of a chickenshit
to take a case he might lose.

1102
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:58,846
They're not dropping Lou.

1103
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:04,184
Well, it's no fucking good
if we don't get ray.

1104
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:07,955
Good.

1105
01:22:07,957 --> 01:22:10,791
That's what I was
hoping you'd say.

1106
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:15,195
They want me to retire
and enjoy the benefits
of my cancer somewhere else.

1107
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:17,898
Fuck that.
You never told me
about the cancer.

1108
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,800
The problem with ray
is his alibi.

1109
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:21,268
You have a family?

1110
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,203
Ray claims he was with
that little...
Bobby. Bobby.

1111
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:24,872
What?

1112
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:28,142
Do you have anyone
in your life?

1113
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:37,117
No. No wife or...

1114
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:41,956
I have a daughter in corpus.

1115
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:47,394
Has she been a help?

1116
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,834
She doesn't know.
What can she do about it?

1117
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,408
Anyway, ray claims

1118
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,911
he was with that little girl,
Leila whatever her name is,

1119
01:23:03,913 --> 01:23:05,612
and she backs him up.

1120
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:07,014
Her aunt backs her up.

1121
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:08,749
What are we gonna do?

1122
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:15,356
It's a question
of how serious you are
about seeing justice done.

1123
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:19,093
You get me?

1124
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,268
I can't eat.
Gonna throw up.

1125
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:30,304
How are you gonna get
anything done
if you can't eat?

1126
01:23:30,306 --> 01:23:33,774
Sometimes I can,
sometimes I can't.
This place is terrible.

1127
01:23:33,776 --> 01:23:34,775
I need you to eat something.

1128
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,622
So let me ask you
a personal question.

1129
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,192
Off the record,
between you and me.

1130
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:55,729
What do you want me to do
with ray Marcus?

1131
01:23:55,731 --> 01:23:57,398
Well, what can you do
with him?

1132
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,300
Anything you goddamn like.

1133
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:08,242
But I thought
you said that...

1134
01:24:08,244 --> 01:24:09,143
Listen,

1135
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:13,414
I got nothin' to lose.

1136
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:16,817
I'm not gonna let
this asshole d.A.
Fuck up my last case.

1137
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:19,820
I'm also not gonna stand by
and watch a murderer go free.

1138
01:24:19,822 --> 01:24:24,825
I've seen too many sick fucks
like ray Marcus get off
over the years.

1139
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:27,428
Now, are you willing
to go outside
of strict procedure on this?

1140
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:28,862
Yes.

1141
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:30,164
You sure?
Yes.

1142
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:38,672
Andes here.

1143
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:43,077
You're kidding?
All right, thanks.

1144
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:49,083
Ray just showed up
at line camp.

1145
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:52,786
I'm gonna let
that little idiot get nice
and liquored up

1146
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:55,422
and then I'm gonna go grab
his ass and take him
to my camp.

1147
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,559
And I want you
to come with me.

1148
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:00,894
We're gonna keep him for
a little while,
work him over a bit,

1149
01:25:00,896 --> 01:25:03,363
get a little rough,
make him suffer.

1150
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,266
And then we'll see
what he does.

1151
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:09,203
Would you like that?

1152
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:18,545
<i> You have to realize</i>
<i> that this is not working.</i>

1153
01:25:18,547 --> 01:25:20,414
We are not working.
We are too different.

1154
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:22,716
We are not right
for each other.
Susan, stop.

1155
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:24,818
We're not right
for each other?

1156
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,753
No, we're not right
for each other.

1157
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:28,889
We are perfect for each other.
No, we're not perfect
for each other, Edward.

1158
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:31,325
We may be perfect
for each other

1159
01:25:31,327 --> 01:25:33,227
if we didn't live
in the real world,

1160
01:25:33,229 --> 01:25:36,330
but I live in the real world
and I need a life
that is more structured.

1161
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:37,998
I need a future
that is more structured.
Hey.

1162
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,834
I want to be the person
that you want me to be,
but I just can't.

1163
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:43,103
You are. You are.
I can't be that.

1164
01:25:43,105 --> 01:25:44,838
Hey, no, stop.

1165
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:49,343
I, I really wanted
to be this person
that you thought I was,

1166
01:25:49,345 --> 01:25:51,078
I really did,
but I'm just
not that person.

1167
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,013
I'm, I'm cynical,
I'm pragmatic.
No, look...

1168
01:25:53,015 --> 01:25:55,182
No, I am. I'm a realist.
You're afraid. You're afraid.

1169
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:56,917
No, I'm not afraid.

1170
01:25:56,919 --> 01:25:58,285
We've been through this
so many times before.
I'm not scared.

1171
01:25:58,287 --> 01:26:00,320
I'm not scared.
I'm unhappy.
All right.

1172
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:06,160
I'm just really,
really unhappy.

1173
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:13,867
You're so...

1174
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,271
You really are so wonderful
and you're just so

1175
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,108
sensitive and
romantic and...

1176
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:24,211
Weak. That's right, yeah.
What? I did not say
you were weak.

1177
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:26,613
You've said it
so many times before.
I did not call you weak.

1178
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:28,549
You've said it before,
so why don't you say it again?

1179
01:26:28,551 --> 01:26:30,817
Weak.
I did not say
you were weak.

1180
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:33,720
I did not say
you were weak.
Do you love me?

1181
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:35,489
That's not the point.
No, that is the point.

1182
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:37,157
No, it is not the point.
That is the point!

1183
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:38,225
That is not the point.
You didn't answer me.

1184
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,630
Yes, I love you.
Well, when you love someone,

1185
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:45,966
you work it out.

1186
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,136
You don't just throw it away.

1187
01:26:49,138 --> 01:26:50,304
You have to be
careful with it.

1188
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:51,305
You might never get it again.

1189
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:54,975
I can't do this with you
anymore, Edward.

1190
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:57,978
I just can't keep doing this.

1191
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:00,314
Susan...

1192
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:02,916
You can't just
walk away from things

1193
01:27:02,918 --> 01:27:04,218
<i> all the time.</i>

1194
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:17,264
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, shit. Come on.

1195
01:27:17,266 --> 01:27:20,267
I told you,
i don't know nothin'
about this situation.

1196
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:21,602
Why don't you go ask
in there, man?

1197
01:27:21,604 --> 01:27:23,103
I'll see you
in a minute, okay?

1198
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,439
Okay, sweetie?

1199
01:27:38,119 --> 02:55:16,237
We're going to my camp.

1200
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:43,957
It's in white creek
near the trailer
where they took your folks.

1201
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:45,859
You follow.

1202
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:02,542
Sit up.

1203
01:28:07,216 --> 01:28:10,817
Oh, Jesus.
I'm gonna be sick.
Tony, get over here, quick.

1204
01:28:10,819 --> 01:28:12,653
Here, you use this, right?

1205
01:28:12,655 --> 01:28:14,321
You shoot him
if he gets out of line.

1206
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:24,931
Boo.

1207
01:28:24,933 --> 01:28:27,100
Hey, man, this ain't legal.
If this were legal,

1208
01:28:27,102 --> 01:28:28,969
you'd have taken me
to the station,
not this fucking place.

1209
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:31,505
It's all the legal
we need, boy.

1210
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,944
There ain't
no new evidence.
Oh, yeah?

1211
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:40,647
Why don't you take me in
if you got new evidence? Huh?

1212
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:44,251
I like it better here.
It's more relaxed.

1213
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,689
It seems to me
you tried
this trick already.

1214
01:28:48,691 --> 01:28:50,424
If you think this guy's
gonna break me down,

1215
01:28:50,426 --> 01:28:51,992
you already seen
that don't work.
Oh, yeah,

1216
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:54,528
but what would you say
if I told you

1217
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:56,797
your friend Lou bates
implicated you

1218
01:28:56,799 --> 01:28:58,598
in the Hastings murders?

1219
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:01,702
If Lou had done that,
you would have taken me in.

1220
01:29:01,704 --> 01:29:04,538
Well, don't worry,
we'll get you to the station.

1221
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,606
Don't worry. Oh, who's this?

1222
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,278
Well, looky here.
You son of a bitch.

1223
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,447
All right.

1224
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:18,051
Okay, come on, boy.
Get over there.

1225
01:29:18,053 --> 01:29:20,387
Lou, what'd you
fucking tell this guy?
I didn't tell him nothin'.

1226
01:29:20,389 --> 01:29:22,823
No, he said you told him
i was the one who killed
this guy's wife and kid.

1227
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:25,158
What? That's what
he told me about you.

1228
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,494
You're supposed
to be the lawman.
What kind of bullshit is this?

1229
01:29:27,496 --> 01:29:28,562
Fuck off

1230
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,164
both of you.

1231
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:34,034
Now, do you two
have any last words
you wanna say to each other?

1232
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:39,239
I think what we
should do, Tony,

1233
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:40,741
is we should just kill
them right now.

1234
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:43,477
It's gonna be rough
for 'em out there,

1235
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:47,647
not knowing
how it's gonna come.

1236
01:29:47,649 --> 01:29:50,550
Maybe ray'll get killed
for resisting arrest, huh?

1237
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:58,592
Coming home late at night,

1238
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:02,062
he might get shot
by a burglar.

1239
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:08,835
Oh, you feeling
uncomfortable, boy?

1240
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:13,507
Ooh. Come on up here.

1241
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:15,442
Yeah, you look
like you're feeling
uncomfortable.

1242
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:17,611
What?
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1243
01:30:17,613 --> 01:30:18,512
What's that?

1244
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:21,681
I ain't gonna kill you, son.

1245
01:30:21,683 --> 01:30:22,849
I'm a policeman.

1246
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:26,119
What, you gonna cry?

1247
01:30:26,121 --> 01:30:27,521
Are you gonna cry?

1248
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:34,060
Aw, okay. Well, since you're
feeling so uncomfortable...

1249
01:30:34,062 --> 01:30:35,362
Tony, get over here.

1250
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,264
Take this.

1251
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:40,033
Go on, right here, okay?
Please don't.

1252
01:30:40,035 --> 01:30:42,068
Fuck.
Right here, right here.

1253
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,703
Right here, okay?

1254
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:45,705
- Right.
- Hey, hey.

1255
01:30:45,707 --> 01:30:47,474
What about me?
I might be feeling
uncomfortable too.

1256
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:48,942
Oh, yeah?

1257
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:51,611
Okay, come on up.

1258
01:30:54,582 --> 01:30:56,817
There you go. Free as a bird.

1259
01:30:57,652 --> 01:31:00,086
Okay? How about it?

1260
01:31:00,088 --> 01:31:02,622
What do you say, Tony?
Now, what shall we do
with these two?

1261
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:06,159
What you gonna do?

1262
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:08,728
What you gonna do, son?

1263
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:10,897
Come on.

1264
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:13,467
Come on.

1265
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:19,005
Let's go...

1266
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:21,575
He's got a gun.

1267
01:31:21,577 --> 01:31:23,610
Bobby?
Shoot 'em, Tony.
Shoot 'em.

1268
01:31:23,612 --> 01:31:25,579
Come back here,
you little fuckers!

1269
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:48,935
No. No.

1270
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,438
No, please.

1271
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:23,803
Are you okay?

1272
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:27,974
I'm gonna live to regret this.

1273
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:32,546
I regret it now.

1274
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,884
You know, I'm catholic.
I don't even believe
in abortions.

1275
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:41,321
I'm so sorry.

1276
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:44,391
I feel so useless.

1277
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:49,663
You're anything but useless.
You always know exactly
what to do.

1278
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:52,766
Thank you.

1279
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:01,274
I just don't think
I'm ever gonna be able
to look at Edward again

1280
01:33:01,276 --> 01:33:02,943
after what I did to his child.

1281
01:33:02,945 --> 01:33:04,344
He'll never find out.

1282
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:15,555
What did I do?
What did I do?

1283
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:17,557
I promise
it'll be okay.

1284
01:33:18,727 --> 01:33:20,026
I'll make it okay.

1285
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:28,702
Oh, my god, no.

1286
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:36,276
Edward.

1287
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:42,882
Tony.

1288
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:44,818
Mmm.

1289
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:46,953
Hey.

1290
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:51,491
You know I had
to shoot him, right?

1291
01:33:54,329 --> 01:33:58,098
I don't give a goddamn
fuck that you shot him!

1292
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,666
I'm glad that you shot him!

1293
01:33:59,668 --> 01:34:01,735
I'm fucking glad
that he's dead!

1294
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:10,243
I should have stopped it!

1295
01:34:13,848 --> 01:34:15,015
I should have protected them.

1296
01:34:15,017 --> 01:34:16,750
I should have seen it coming.

1297
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:19,686
I should have stopped it.

1298
01:34:19,688 --> 01:34:20,854
Hey, now.
Hey, now.

1299
01:34:20,856 --> 01:34:22,088
I should have stopped it.

1300
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:23,156
Shh.

1301
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:26,626
It's okay.
I should have stopped it.

1302
01:34:26,628 --> 01:34:27,761
It's okay.

1303
01:34:28,596 --> 01:34:29,696
Hey.

1304
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:32,599
You're okay.

1305
01:34:32,601 --> 01:34:34,801
I should have
stopped it, Bobby.

1306
01:34:34,803 --> 01:34:35,835
Look at me.

1307
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:38,938
You're a good man.

1308
01:34:41,442 --> 01:34:42,776
You're a good man.

1309
01:34:49,116 --> 01:34:51,484
Come on. We gotta get up.

1310
01:34:51,486 --> 01:34:53,219
Ray gets to the road,
he's gonna hitchhike.

1311
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:54,487
We gotta catch him
before he gets a ride.

1312
01:34:54,489 --> 01:34:56,222
Now, listen to me.

1313
01:34:56,224 --> 01:34:58,558
When you get to
the fork in the road,
you veer to the left.

1314
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,894
That's gonna take
you back towards
where he took your folks.

1315
01:35:00,896 --> 01:35:02,662
I suspect he's gonna
go for the highway.

1316
01:35:02,664 --> 01:35:05,065
I'll go that direction.

1317
01:35:05,067 --> 01:35:07,734
You take this.
I got another
one in the car.

1318
01:35:07,736 --> 01:35:09,135
Bobby...
What?

1319
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,072
Are you in trouble
for all this?

1320
01:35:14,008 --> 01:35:17,310
Hell, I don't know.
I don't really give a shit.

1321
01:35:17,312 --> 01:35:19,312
I'm dying, remember?

1322
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:04,651
Fuck.

1323
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:07,687
You. Where's your pal?

1324
01:37:07,689 --> 01:37:08,988
He's on his way.

1325
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:12,091
Your cop friends?

1326
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:16,763
They're around.

1327
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:20,500
They here?

1328
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:24,938
It's just me for the moment.

1329
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:27,373
Oh.

1330
01:37:28,943 --> 01:37:30,944
You and that fucking gun
you don't know how to use.

1331
01:37:34,448 --> 01:37:35,615
What happened to Lou?

1332
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:38,785
He's dead.

1333
01:37:38,787 --> 01:37:40,220
What?

1334
01:37:40,222 --> 01:37:42,789
Fucking son of a bitch.

1335
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:44,958
That's big trouble
for your friend,
you know that, right?

1336
01:37:46,727 --> 01:37:47,794
I don't think so.

1337
01:37:47,796 --> 01:37:49,128
You don't think so?

1338
01:37:50,164 --> 01:37:51,798
Well, then, what the
fuck do you want?

1339
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:55,735
You and that silly gun.

1340
01:37:57,571 --> 01:37:59,305
I've seen how handy
you are with that thing.

1341
01:37:59,307 --> 01:38:00,874
Sit down. Sit down.

1342
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:04,310
You sit down
or I'll fucking kill you.

1343
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:12,151
Listen, man...

1344
01:38:14,755 --> 01:38:17,190
Why does a nice guy like you

1345
01:38:17,192 --> 01:38:20,660
hang out with a guy
like andes who kills people?

1346
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:23,663
You kill people.

1347
01:38:31,338 --> 01:38:35,008
They had it coming to 'em,
your fucking wife
and that kid, but you...

1348
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,542
You got me wrong,
it was an accident.

1349
01:38:36,544 --> 01:38:38,111
It was an accident?

1350
01:38:38,113 --> 01:38:41,080
I got a certain pride
in how people talk to me.

1351
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:44,851
There are certain things
i don't put up with.

1352
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,521
When someone accuses
me of something,

1353
01:38:48,523 --> 01:38:50,189
that's a fucking insult.

1354
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:53,126
It gives me the right.

1355
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:57,463
If my woman accuses me
of fucking somebody else,

1356
01:38:57,465 --> 01:38:59,799
well, then,
I'll go fuck somebody else.

1357
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:04,804
If your daughter
thinks I'm a rapist,
then she gets raped.

1358
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:12,645
Nobody gets away
with what you did to us.
Nobody.

1359
01:39:13,814 --> 01:39:14,881
Nobody.

1360
01:39:14,883 --> 01:39:16,482
They don't?

1361
01:39:16,484 --> 01:39:17,550
Nobody.

1362
01:39:19,987 --> 01:39:21,120
Nobody.

1363
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:23,990
Nobody.

1364
01:39:23,992 --> 01:39:25,825
Well, then, you should
just kill me, then.

1365
01:39:27,328 --> 01:39:28,561
Right?

1366
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,331
You should fucking kill me.

1367
01:39:35,602 --> 01:39:37,236
Man, you know nothing.

1368
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:41,140
It's fun to kill people.

1369
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:44,444
You of all people
should try it sometime.

1370
01:39:44,446 --> 01:39:45,511
Fun?

1371
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:50,583
It's fun to kill people?

1372
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:56,522
Did you have fun

1373
01:39:56,524 --> 01:39:57,924
killing my wife and daughter?

1374
01:40:01,528 --> 01:40:02,362
Get up.

1375
01:40:03,697 --> 01:40:05,598
Get up. Go on, now.

1376
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,100
Go on. Go on.

1377
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:10,003
Go on.

1378
01:40:12,039 --> 01:40:13,106
Go on.

1379
01:40:26,153 --> 01:40:28,721
I remember your fucking wife.

1380
01:40:28,723 --> 01:40:32,358
I remember
fucking your wife.

1381
01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:35,628
You're too weak.

1382
01:40:36,563 --> 01:40:39,165
Too fucking weak, you know.

1383
01:40:39,167 --> 01:40:41,968
You're too weak
to do anything about it.

1384
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:47,306
Son of a bitch!

1385
01:44:58,759 --> 01:44:59,825
Edward.

1386
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:00,506
Right this way, sir.
