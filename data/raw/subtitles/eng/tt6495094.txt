2
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,662
- Beth, is it on?
- We're rolling.

3
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,298
Places, guys.
This one's for real.

4
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,769
"For centuries, the dark hand of Narash has
been spreading across the borderlands,

5
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,573
ruling with blood
and necromancy.

6
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:04,810
Are you the chosen one to challenge
him, to crush his bones into dust,

7
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:07,747
and pry out his innards
with the tip of your sword?"

8
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:09,548
Beth, film me.

9
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,817
Meg, you look like a boy.

10
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,554
- Yes! I am the...
- That's my part.

11
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,555
I just wanted to make
sure you did it right.

12
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:18,691
This is the pivotal point
for your character.

13
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:20,659
- Just let me do it my way.
- But I'm the director.

14
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:21,828
Hi, Amy.

15
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,563
- Okay, fine.
- Try it again.

16
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:30,003
"I am the rightful paladin. Tell me my path,
Lord Gillian, I shall fulfill my prophecy."

17
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:34,039
"You must travel beyond
the catacombs of Eryx,

18
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:38,177
through the valley of Guell,
and climb the denizen steps

19
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:41,114
where no human has dared
to venture."

20
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:43,116
"Ever dared to venture, yet."

21
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:48,554
Uh, it's more like:
"Ever dared to venture, yet!"

22
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:50,090
In order to continue,

23
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:52,591
you must offer
sacrifice to Rian,

24
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:55,661
a dark fairy
of the Killian order.

25
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,265
"You must bring me
the dragon scale relic

26
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,599
of the forgotten droids."

27
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,134
Druids!

28
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:02,903
Whatever.

29
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,739
- "Do you accept?"
- "I am not afraid."

30
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:09,743
She turned and said farewell,
floating bravely forth,

31
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:13,515
on her long, unknown journey,
far away.

32
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:18,718
End book one.

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,754
Hey, Jo,
do the epilogue!

34
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,622
But we've heard it
a million times!

35
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:24,660
It's my favorite part.

36
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,663
The people have spoken.

37
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:34,333
It is not enough for the brave
heroine to desire greatness.

38
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:40,040
No, even the lowliest serf in the
kingdom may desire greatness.

39
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:43,944
For our heroine to succeed,
she must demand greatness.

40
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,979
To snatch it
from the powers that be

41
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:48,948
and wave it over the parapet
for all to see.

42
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,785
To prove
that she is their queen,

43
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:56,926
and the magnificent rightful
heir to her birthright.

44
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:03,997
Uh, well,
thank you, Josephine.

45
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:04,932
Oh, it's just Jo.

46
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,100
You certainly gave us
an entertaining read.

47
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,805
Uh, listen,
it's not my taste per se,

48
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,909
but I could see how it
could appeal to others.

49
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:20,613
- What are you going for? Young adult fantasy?
- Uh, no.

50
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:23,083
It can't be Y.A.
There's no love story.

51
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:25,618
- It's not a love story.
- Then it's definitely a pass for me.

52
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,755
- Yeah, it's a pass for me as well.
- Me too, sweetie.

53
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:33,093
You have a very creative mind.

54
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:37,297
But, there's something
missing in the authenticity.

55
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,765
I can't hear your voice.

56
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:39,965
It's not about me!

57
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,334
All the same,
it's still gonna be a pass.

58
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,172
Professor?

59
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,242
Yeah, it's a pass
from me as well.

60
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:50,343
Thanks.

61
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:52,678
No, thank you.

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,947
Really I...

63
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:58,851
I appreciate you judging
my artistic aptitude

64
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,791
on three pages
of my 400-page novel.

65
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:06,862
Thank you.

Hurry up!
The lava's rising.

75
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,259
Is there any way you could
give me a one-time extension?

76
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:16,129
- I promise, it won't happen again.
- My earring!

77
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:19,499
Leave it! No! She just
spontaneously combusted!

78
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,234
- We have to move on.
- Oh, come on.

79
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:22,335
Jo!

80
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:23,936
She chose her fate.

81
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,804
We are not
going without her.

82
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:27,473
Is there any way
you could reverse the fee?

83
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,475
- Apollyon!
- Yes?

84
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:30,509
Apollyon!

85
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:32,345
I'm sorry.
Can you just hold?

86
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,213
I am here!

87
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:38,251
From whence come you,
and whither are you bound?

88
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:41,121
We have traveled
from the city of desolation

89
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:44,790
through the fires of purgatory, fighting beasts of the night.

90
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:49,732
- We seek access to the city of Zion.
- Ooh. Hmm.

91
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,968
You may release
your burdens.

92
00:05:55,302 --> 00:06:00,073
But you must each sacrifice
one valuable to the altar.

93
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:04,244
But choose carefully.
Be not selfish!

94
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:08,381
Whatever you select
must be of great value.

95
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,986
Good. Yes.

96
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,121
- Hair?
- It's valuable to me.

97
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:15,858
Hmm.

98
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:20,195
Your castles await you.

99
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,997
- Go!
- Except for Amy.

100
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,898
Oh.

101
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,999
- Hey!
- Oh. Ah.

102
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:30,271
Hello? Thanks for holding.
I'm so sorry.

103
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:37,477
Hey, let me in!

104
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,912
No! You cheated!

105
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:40,345
You don't deserve
to be in the castle!

106
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,381
- Just let her in.
- She has to play by the rules!

107
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:43,516
It's just a game.

108
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,888
- Let me in!
- It's not a game to me!

109
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,955
- Let me in!
- Let her in.

110
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,523
All my sisters are allowed in my castle.

111
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,228
Mine too.

112
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,100
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is so cool.

113
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,035
Mine's pink!

114
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:04,970
"Welcome to your castles
in the air.

115
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:07,109
Fill them wisely.
Love Marmee."

116
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:17,917
- Jo, what's in your castle?
- Well, I want a lot of things.

117
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,319
- I, Jo March...
- <i>I, Jo March...</i>

118
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:25,290
I, Jo March... I'll get out of this
town and move to the big city.

119
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:28,528
I, Jo March, will be a
very successful writer

120
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,131
and will buy a big house in the
city so we can all live together.

121
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,199
I don't want to
live with you forever!

122
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:36,869
I want to get married
and have kids and...

123
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:40,907
And have a nanny,
and a maid, and... a butler!

124
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:44,276
- Amy, that's stupid.
- Hey, you can't judge other people's castles.

125
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:47,213
Fine.
Then I change the rules of mine.

126
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:49,448
Only Beth and I are
allowed in my castle.

127
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,884
Hey!

128
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:54,254
I, Jo March, will be
a very successful writer,

129
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:56,122
and will visit
every single country

130
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,924
and eat out
every single meal.

131
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:03,028
Oh, and I will see every play and
musical and opera ever written.

132
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,564
Or will be written
ever.

133
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,435
I think that's too long.

134
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:13,208
I, Jo March, will be a very
successful writer and will...

135
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,878
do
all the things.

136
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,415
My turn.

137
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:27,953
I, Amy March, will be...
a rich and famous painter

138
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:30,355
so I can...

139
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:33,325
buy whatever I want
and go wherever I want.

140
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,928
Amy.

141
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,997
I, Margaret March, will have
a family of my own,

142
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:41,470
and, um, just be...

143
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:45,139
well, happy.

144
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,075
And?

145
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,245
And nothing.

146
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,578
- <i>Beth?</i>
- <i>I, Elizabeth March...</i>

147
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,383
I, Elizabeth March...

148
00:08:57,018 --> 00:08:59,218
I don't know what to say.

149
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,923
Just... think about what you
want to be when you grow up.

150
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,291
Well, I think this is my castle.

151
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:09,364
- The attic?
- Just being here with all of you.

152
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:12,397
Okay, Beth.

153
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,166
Yeah, that's really sweet.
We'll take it.

154
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:16,435
Let's make an oath.

155
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,469
- Okay.
- Yeah.

156
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:18,941
All right.

157
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,181
To always help each other
reach our castles.

158
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:29,484
No matter
where they may be.

159
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:47,733
"Everybody gets a prize" mentality.

160
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:50,269
- My principles could be...
- No. Not everybody wins.

161
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:53,039
Hey, excuse me!
Excuse me.

162
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,272
- Professor Bhaer.
- Oh, dear.

163
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:55,040
Hey!

164
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,275
- It's dragon lady.
- Professor Bhaer!

165
00:09:57,277 --> 00:09:59,112
- Good luck with that.
- I need to talk to you.

166
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,713
Just Jo, with the
fantasy novel, right?

167
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:04,150
It's a high-fantasy
mythopoeic fable.

168
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,352
Sorry I'm not more
familiar with that genre.

169
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:09,521
Yeah, neither was your panel
of patriarchs in there.

170
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:12,025
Which, you know, I might expect
from some of those hacks,

171
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:13,659
but not from you.

172
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:15,328
Not from someone
with your résumé.

173
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,597
It doesn't matter.
I will find my audience,

174
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:22,200
no thanks to Columbia or Hooton
Muffin or however you say it.

175
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:26,271
- I'm sure you will.
- You probably didn't even understand that the protagonist

176
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:29,174
- is actually a girl who dresses up as a boy.
- I didn't.

177
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:31,444
And when I was growing up,
I dressed up as a boy.

178
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:35,113
I was inspired by my
"authentic self," you see?

179
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:39,484
I really think you would have understood
that and possibly even enjoyed it a little,

180
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:42,554
had you heard more than
a measly three-minute reading

181
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:45,223
in a synthetic,
almost hostile environment,

182
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:49,261
where the critiques were really more
about subjective capitalistic conjecture

183
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:52,198
than a chance for writers
to be discovered.

184
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,369
I'd be happy to read
more of your novel.

185
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:56,169
You would?

186
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,404
Oh, yes! Thank you!

187
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:01,207
I've been wanting anyone...
everyone... to read it.

188
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:02,275
Besides my sister.

189
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:04,146
Freddy, by the way.
Freddy Bhaer.

190
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,214
Here. Contact info,
title page.

191
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:10,817
E-mail would have been fine.

192
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,418
No.

193
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,655
You have to hold the words,
let them seep into your skin.

194
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:18,757
All right.

195
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,229
I'll be expecting your call.

196
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:32,137
<i>Hey, it's Freddy. I'm just, uh, checking in.</i>

197
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,474
<i>I haven't heard from you. I know
that notes can be overwhelming.</i>

198
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:37,175
<i>Keep your chin up.</i>

199
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:39,478
<i>Let me know when you have another draft.</i>

200
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:49,457
Josephine? Good heavens, child. It
smells like a Turkish bath in here.

201
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:57,796
If you're going to quarantine yourself
in this room for weeks on end,

202
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:59,431
the least you could do
is crack a window.

203
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,467
The least you could do
is knock.

204
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:04,402
Oh, I'm your employer,
and I'm supposed to knock?

205
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,572
How very millennial of you.

206
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:08,440
Dinner's at 6:00.

207
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,476
I don't want her to starve

208
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:13,346
while you escape into
your Neverwood Forest

209
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,247
or whatever
you're scribbling about.

210
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:17,382
I will do my best.

211
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:19,285
Well, I sure hope
that's enough.

212
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,355
Love you too,
Aunt March.

213
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:37,236
<i>Honey, it's Mom, just wanting
to know how your meetings went.</i>

214
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:42,942
<i>So exciting. I bet they were busy fighting over
who gets to publish Concord's own Jo March.</i>

215
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,577
<i>Anyway, I
know you're busy,</i>

216
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,383
<i>but just check in and let us know when
you're coming home for Christm...</i>

217
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:52,818
This is going to be
the worst Christmas ever.

218
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,621
All my friends at school
get a whole pile of presents,

219
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:57,593
and we get nothing.

220
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:03,828
Well, we each get one gift, and
that's more than most people get.

221
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,564
You want to know
what I asked for?

222
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:08,200
Do not say a bra.

223
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:09,901
New paintbrushes!

224
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:11,539
There he is again!

225
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:22,518
I heard he just
moved here from Europe.

226
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,618
Maybe he was forced
to move here,

227
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,290
after stowing away on
the Trans-Siberian railroad.

228
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:33,227
Marmee said his parents
just died in a car accident.

229
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:34,993
He doesn't
have any siblings,

230
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:39,534
- so now he has to live with his grandfather.
- How sad.

231
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,306
He's kind of cute, though.

232
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,607
I mean,
I guess, for an old guy.

233
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:54,247
I don't think I could
ever live in that creepy house.

234
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,747
Mr. Laurence is so scary.

235
00:13:55,749 --> 00:14:00,019
Oh, maybe Mr. Laurence
isn't his grandfather.

236
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,288
He's the new kid's
vampire mentor,

237
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,290
and he's trying to tame
his ravishing appetite.

238
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:08,426
Wait, that is really good.

239
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:09,728
We should do something
nice for them.

240
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,766
- Maybe we could bake them something.
- Yes!

241
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:20,673
<i>♪ Angels we have heard on high ♪</i>

242
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:22,275
Ooh.

243
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:24,843
Amy, let's wait till
everyone gets here, okay?

244
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,344
But I'm starving!

245
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:29,015
You continue to use
that word incorrectly.

246
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:31,383
- You know what I mean.
- Actually, I don't.

247
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:32,550
- Shut up, Jo.
- Good morning!

248
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:35,320
Oh, it smells like Christmas
in here.

249
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:36,822
- You're back!
- How was the shelter?

250
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:38,991
- Well...
- There were so many people there,

251
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,327
we didn't have enough
food for everyone.

252
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:43,996
See Amy? Those
people <i>are</i> starving.

253
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:46,899
But not if
they like cupcakes.

254
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,334
- Oh!
- I'll grab my costumes.

255
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:51,036
We can do
the nativity musical!

256
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:54,842
Oh! No, no, no, no, no.
Not the cupcakes!

257
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:58,444
Can we just be
a normal family

258
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:01,546
and eat breakfast
and open presents at home?

259
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:03,518
I'll get that.

260
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,053
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

261
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:08,688
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

262
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,954
- Oh!
- I think this one's yours.

263
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,357
Yeah.

264
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,992
- Thank you so much.
- There you go.

265
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,559
Fat ol' Goob
is always running away.

266
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:17,096
- Yeah.
- Dove? Where are you?

267
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:18,930
Dove? I thought
you called him Goob.

268
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,833
Oh, I'm Dove.
I mean, I'm Meg.

269
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:23,468
But my family...
That's what they call me.

270
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,670
I'm John Brooke. I live next
door with the Laurences.

271
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:27,906
- Oh.
- You don't look like a Laurence.

272
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:31,711
- This is my sister, Jo.
- Yeah, I'm just a family friend of the Laurences.

273
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:36,848
Mr. Laurence hired me to tutor his
grandson. Math, music and whatever else.

274
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,852
- That's nice.
- So the new kid has a manny.

275
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:41,853
Nope. Just a tutor.

276
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,421
Right. Okay, yeah.

277
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,524
Well, uh, we have to go
help some poor people.

278
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:47,126
- Oh.
- So we'll catch you later.

279
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,093
Merry Christmas.

280
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,962
- Mm, bye!
- Merry Christmas.

281
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:52,964
- <i>Goob, buddy. Get off the computer.</i>
- Oops, sorry, Dad.

282
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:54,900
<i>Rascal.</i>

283
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:58,136
- Come here, Goob.
- <i>What do you got for me, Amy?</i>

284
00:15:58,138 --> 00:16:01,506
Okay. This one
is Marmee's favorite.

285
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:04,443
- <i>Wow.</i>
- She says it's very "ethetically" pleasing.

286
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,846
- Aesthetically.
- Aesthetically.

287
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:10,448
<i>Well done. Amy, that's beautiful.
You're getting so good!</i>

288
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,751
Thank you.

289
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:15,420
- Did I show you this one?
- No. No, no, no. Your time is up!

290
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,421
- Jo.
- No.

291
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:17,589
Come on!
Time is up!

292
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:18,958
- Move.
- <i>Hey, you guys.</i>

293
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,458
Thank you.

294
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,127
Hi, Dad.
Okay, really quick question.

295
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:26,131
Uh, when you first cut into a
liver, is the blood that seeps out,

296
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,467
is it more crimson or maroon?

297
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:30,535
<i>Writing a murder mystery,
are we?</i>

298
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:34,939
- No, it's a post-apocalyptic zombie thriller.
- <i>Whoa.</i>

299
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:38,777
<i>Uh, crimson, I would say.
But I only operate on humans.</i>

300
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,947
- <i>So I don't really know about zombie blood.</i>
- Okay. Thank you.

301
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:44,650
<i>All right, listen up, girls.
I only have a minute left.</i>

302
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:47,051
<i>Jo, I'm going to put you
in charge of the club this year.</i>

303
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:48,487
<i>So here's your marching orders.</i>

304
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:54,193
<i>Your first assignment of the year will
be to write your grievances every week</i>

305
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,761
<i>and come up with a plan
as to how to fix them.</i>

306
00:16:56,763 --> 00:17:00,735
<i>That way, you can be strong,
kind, independent little women</i>

307
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:02,535
<i>like your mother.</i>

308
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:05,937
- <i>Is that clear?</i>
- Sir, yes, sir!

309
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,842
<i>Good. At ease, soldiers.</i>

310
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:10,376
<i>I love you guys so much.</i>

311
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:13,511
- <i>Hey, where's my beautiful Marmee?</i>
- Marmee!

312
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:16,682
- <i>I need to see her one more time.</i>
- Hi.

313
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:19,684
<i>Ah, there she is.
Hi, Marmee.</i>

314
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:22,620
- <i>I love you so much.</i>
- Love you, Dad!

315
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,790
<i>Merry Christmas, you guys.
I miss you so much.</i>

316
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,460
<i>I'll think about you every day.
I promise.</i>

317
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,094
Merry Christmas, Dad!

318
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:31,864
- <i>Take care of your mom. I love you.</i>
- Always.

319
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:32,734
<i>Bye.</i>

320
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:49,514
<i>Fifteen! Sixteen! Seventeen!</i>

321
00:17:49,516 --> 00:17:51,183
Say it with me, ladies!

322
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:56,821
Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!

323
00:17:56,823 --> 00:18:00,494
All right.
Fall in, soldiers!

324
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:05,530
As Staff Sergeant
of the Pickwick Club,

325
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:08,733
I request a read of the earthly
grievances of each of our members

326
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:10,839
as requested
by our commander-in-chief.

327
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:17,009
Staff Sergeant Snodgrass.

328
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:20,512
Your clothes and notebooks are everywhere
and when asked to clean it up,

329
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:23,048
you launched an airborne Cabbage
Patch at Private Winkle's head!

330
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,849
You're lucky
that you missed.

331
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:27,086
With all due respect,
who's the lucky one?

332
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:30,591
- Soldier...
- Apologies, Private. Duly noted.

333
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:35,793
Corporal Tupman.

334
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:38,630
Though we love
your feline companion,

335
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:41,799
we request that you fulfill
your kitty litter duties

336
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:46,004
and pick up the litter box since the stench
is considered to be highly offensive.

337
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:47,508
Can do, sir.

338
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:55,813
Private Winkle. It has been reported
that on multiple occasions,

339
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,951
you have stolen toilet paper
out of the latrine,

340
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:02,053
with the express purpose
of stuffing your shirt.

341
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:03,155
You are so mean!

342
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:05,057
On the contrary.

343
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:09,294
We wish only to help you enjoy
your youthful freedom,

344
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:14,332
for you will soon come to know the cumbersome
and unwieldy nature of a full chest.

345
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:16,702
- Like you would know.
- Private Winkle!

346
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:20,271
General Pickwick!

347
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:23,876
It has been noted that you have
not visited the shelter all week

348
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:27,245
because of frequent flirtations
with the manny.

349
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:29,280
So you must go twice
next week.

350
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:30,886
Sir, yes, sir.

351
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:38,123
Josephine, what on earth is going on here?

352
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:42,828
Wha... Sorry. I'm... I'm just, uh... trying
to lay everything out, see everything.

353
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,629
I'm not talking about
your little story.

354
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:48,200
I'm talking about the fact that
Katinka's water bowl is bone dry,

355
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:49,335
and she pooped
in the entryway.

356
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:53,038
- Serious? I just took her out.
- When? Last Christmas?

357
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,976
- What am I paying you for?
- I'm sorry my life doesn't revolve around your dog.

358
00:19:57,978 --> 00:20:01,012
Well, what does it revolve
around, exactly? Hmm?

359
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:05,020
Trolls? Dragons?
Cross-dressing pirates?

360
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:09,221
I don't mean
to hurt your feelings.

361
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:11,255
I'm just worried
about you is all.

362
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:15,194
Is this really the life you want?
The life of... insecurity?

363
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:16,761
Yes.

364
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:19,164
What if the professor
doesn't like this version

365
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,098
or the next?

366
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,734
- He will.
- I hate to see you working so hard

367
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,703
when it could all
come to nothing.

368
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:27,639
There's no shame
in changing your mind.

369
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,709
You're still...
youngish.

370
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:34,178
It's not too late to pursue something
with a little more promise in it.

371
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,049
I know it doesn't look
like much right now,

372
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,251
but you are going to be sorry
you ever doubted me.

373
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:41,990
I certainly hope so.

374
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:47,628
Just think about a
plan "B."

375
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:59,905
- I knew it. You hate the new beginning.
- No.

376
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:02,875
I liked it.
A lot, actually.

377
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:05,180
But then I've always been a
fan of <i>A Wrinkle in Time.</i>

378
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:09,848
I am trying to get
inspired by the greats.

379
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,817
Isn't that what artists do?

380
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:13,018
Yes.

381
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,154
And then they tell
their own stories.

382
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:17,955
- Was it at least better than the last time you read it?
- It was.

383
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:19,660
But...

384
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,895
Am I a hopeless case?

385
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:26,098
Please just tell me now.
Save me the heartache.

386
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,901
You know, there are
other things I could do.

387
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:31,436
I do have
marketable skills.

388
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:34,306
I could be a nanny
till the day I croak.

389
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:39,778
I love books. I-I should be
an old spinster librarian

390
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,815
who reads saucy romance
novels under her desk.

391
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:44,051
I'm sure you'll
find time for both.

392
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,085
You are not helping!

393
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:49,954
I'm not your therapist.
I'm your editor.

394
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:51,824
I'm not going to pity an artist
for taking their stripes.

395
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:55,094
You signed up for this struggle the
moment you called yourself a writer.

396
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:58,030
I have a feeling you'd
be bored with anything less.

397
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:02,334
You're good, Jo.
You're a good writer.

398
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:05,771
But now that I've gotten
to know you, as a person,

399
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:08,072
you are far more interesting
than what you write.

400
00:22:08,074 --> 00:22:11,011
I want to be reading...
more of this.

401
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,480
More of you.

402
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:16,084
Me?

403
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:19,417
I am not
interesting!

404
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:20,586
Hell,
I'm 29 years old.

405
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:23,888
And I live alone in Queens while
I work for my great aunt.

406
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,257
I still haven't been to Europe.

407
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:27,859
I haven't been marooned
on a desert island.

408
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:30,796
I haven't been falsely
accused of murder.

409
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:32,865
I haven't even been
a victim of identify theft!

410
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:36,801
If... If my younger self
could see me now,

411
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:41,875
she'd straight up join a nunnery because
at least then her life would have purpose.

412
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:47,011
Actually,
that is not a bad idea.

413
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:49,147
Do nuns take old people
like me?

414
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:50,317
See? More of this.

415
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,286
Where are you going?

416
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,053
Thanks to you, I have a
whole new draft to start.

417
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:59,424
We could talk about something else. It
doesn't always have to be about your work.

418
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:01,059
I don't have time
to sit and chat.

419
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,828
If my muse
isn't going to visit me,

420
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,802
I am going to find her and knock her dumb door down.

421
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:11,537
Maybe I can help.

422
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:13,405
You guys...

423
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,339
My nose won't stop growing!

424
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:18,810
- I need a nose job.
- Take that ridiculous thing off.

425
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:21,879
You don't know what it's like to have
everyone else make fun of your nose.

426
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:26,151
What is it gonna be like when you cut off
your circulation and your nose falls off?

427
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:28,419
- You'd look like Voldemort.
- Oh! That would be awesome.

428
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:32,124
Why can't I go to the New Year's Eve party?

429
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:34,158
You can go to all the parties
you want when you're older.

430
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,096
For now, you can stay home and watch
the ball drop with Marmee and Beth.

431
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:41,332
- Does that sound like any fun to you?
- Yes.

432
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:43,100
It's not.
I'm the worst.

433
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:44,903
I always fall asleep
before midnight.

434
00:23:44,905 --> 00:23:49,407
Yeah! You see what I mean?
Beth is so boring!

435
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:52,376
And I could care less
about watching a ball drop.

436
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:54,546
- Couldn't care less.
- What's the difference?

437
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:58,416
Well, if you could care less, that means you
care a little bit about the ball dropping.

438
00:23:58,418 --> 00:24:01,319
- I don't.
- Okay, look. I think you're lucky.

439
00:24:01,321 --> 00:24:04,056
I would rather pass a kidney stone
than go to this freakin' party.

440
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:06,023
- You have to come with me. You promised.
- I'll go!

441
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,527
You're too young!

442
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:12,231
Can I at least
pick out your outfit?

443
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,866
No, I'm wearing this.

444
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:15,934
You'll never get a boyfriend.

445
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:17,935
That's the plan.

446
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:21,943
- I don't want a boyfriend. Boys are gross. I...
- What's that smell?

447
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:23,908
Jo!

448
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,613
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry! You should have never let me do this!

449
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:31,082
- Meg, Meg, Meg.
- Say "sorry"!

450
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:33,388
You can just cover
it up with a headband.

451
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,023
You still look
so pretty.

452
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,524
It's not that bad,
is it?

453
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,296
- No.
- Not at all.

454
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,303
I don't like looking at
myself in the mirror.

455
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:51,239
Me neither.

456
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,571
You get used to it.

457
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:56,575
Jo, why don't you wear one too?
You can match Meg.

458
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,944
I'm not wearing
a stupid headband.

459
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:03,915
You don't even like Sally Moffat, and
her, like, giggly little brat pack.

460
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:07,051
- They're not that bad.
- They talk about the stupidest things.

461
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:09,421
And her brother always
gives me the weirdest looks.

462
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:12,026
Let's go get pizza instead
and say that we didn't.

463
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:15,260
Jo, listen.

464
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:18,131
I'm sick of being the weird
home-schooled sisters.

465
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:24,302
I want to make friends and go to
parties and talk to guys our own age.

466
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:26,006
Why?

467
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,307
Because I just do!

468
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:31,879
And I really need
you to be my wing woman.

469
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:38,151
Wing woman

- What?
- Me too.

496
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:03,534
I'm only here because my grandpa
thinks I need to make friends.

497
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:07,405
I guess when your grandpa thinks
you're a loner, you probably are.

498
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:09,808
So you're the infamous
Laurence grandson.

499
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,009
Infamous?

500
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:15,780
Well, my theory... was that you
were an international spy,

501
00:27:15,782 --> 00:27:19,651
seeking refuge
in an inconspicuous town.

502
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:21,055
Well, you're right.

503
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:23,821
And now you die.

504
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:28,393
I'm Jo.

505
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:29,464
Laurie.

506
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,732
Goody-goody, Meggy March.

507
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:36,068
Who let you
out of the henhouse?

508
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,404
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink!

509
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,138
Whoo!

510
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,176
- Come on. It's not gonna kill you!
- I'll do it.

511
00:27:45,712 --> 00:27:47,145
You speak French?

512
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:49,280
I had to.
I lived there for three years.

513
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:51,715
No way. You have to
tell me all about it!

514
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:54,653
I'm going to Paris
after college.

515
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:56,555
I'm gonna do
all the things.

516
00:27:56,557 --> 00:28:00,524
It's pretty much just like anywhere else.
It's just... more French.

517
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:03,395
Well, it's definitely
not as boring as here.

518
00:28:03,397 --> 00:28:07,732
Here's not so bad.
So far at least.

519
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:09,434
I cannot wait
to leave this place.

520
00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:11,837
I have two years
till I go to Oxford.

521
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,172
I'm a novelist
and a playwright.

522
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:16,674
I'm going to be very
successful and very rich.

523
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:19,610
Not like filthy rich
like you and your grandpa,

524
00:28:19,612 --> 00:28:22,646
but just rich enough that I buy a
house in Europe and bring my sisters

525
00:28:22,648 --> 00:28:23,882
and pay for everything.

526
00:28:23,884 --> 00:28:25,649
Wow, sounds like
you've got it all figured out.

jungle until she has both of her legs,

532
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:45,770
- so she has to wait until the curse is lifted.
- Naturally.

533
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:47,739
But the thing
that she doesn't know

534
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:51,675
is that she actually has to get
to the edge of the jungle

535
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:52,978
for the curse to be lifted!

536
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,549

I haven't seen you
since, like, kindergarten.

00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:41,859
You're, like,

553
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:44,596

Wasn't it kind of
a little fun?

569
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:43,555
I don't know if I see any dancing
going on back there. Come on now.

570
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:45,889
How could you not
dance to this?

571
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:52,896
Hat time, Megan.

572
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,566
Right on point!

573
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:56,434
- I know. I know.
- I'm feelin' it.

574
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:59,337
Thank you so much
for taking care of my girls.

575
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:01,005
My pleasure. It's nice
to finally meet you.

576
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,642
Yeah. You can
call me Marmee.

577
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:05,944
- And this here is Amy.
- Hello, Amy.

578
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:07,811
Amy, Laurie.

579
00:31:07,813 --> 00:31:11,282
Uh, um.

580
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,385
I'm sorry. My hair's
a mess right now.

581
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:17,321
- I was braiding it.
- I'm actually kind of digging the one-sided thing.

582
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:19,390
You could start a trend
with that.

583
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:22,694
- That's Beth.
- Hey, Beth.

584
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:24,896
Don't worry, Beth.
He's a good egg.

585
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:26,063
Promise.

586
00:31:26,065 --> 00:31:28,066
Is that a guitar
I see over there?

587
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:30,702
- You mind if I, uh...
- No, of course not.

588
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:32,771
I mean, it might be
way out of tune.

589
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:36,510
I'm tryin' to impress my new neighbors.
You mind helpin' me out?

590
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:40,779
- All right.
- So, we're gonna have a concert?

591
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:41,913

592
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:46,286

622
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:44,769
The March sister who's going to get
the New Year's Eve kiss from me...

623
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:46,507
is...

624
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:50,074
Goob!

625
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:56,580
At this time, I wish to propose
a new member to the club.

626
00:33:56,582 --> 00:33:59,184
- What?
- This nominee...

627
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:03,887
deserves a chance and would be
deeply grateful to join our ranks.

628
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:06,057
- Goob.
- No. No.

629
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:11,195
Further, I believe this soldier will
add a unique voice to the platoon.

630
00:34:11,197 --> 00:34:12,663
Who?

631
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:16,867
I nominate
Mr. Laurie Laurence.

632
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:20,871
- Mm-hmm.
- No! No, no, no. That would be so embarrassing!

633
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:23,208
I agree with Amy.
I mean, Private Winkle.

634
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,275
He would just make fun of us.

635
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:28,813
I give my word, as a soldier,
and as Staff Sergeant

636
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:32,916
that he will not make fun of
our grievances or our oaths.

637
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:35,954
He wants nothing more than
to be a full part of the PC!

638
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:38,857
He's like our brother!
Guys, we have to do it!

639
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:41,960
- What if he tells Brooke?
- I promise I won't tell a soul!

640
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:43,895
- Traitor!
- You've been in there the whole time?

641
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:46,063
- I hardly heard anything.
- You heard everything!

642
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:50,567
My fellow comrades. I come to you
as a lowly Private First Class!

643
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:53,570
A faithful friend
and a keeper of secrets.

644
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:57,478
As a token of my appreciation for your
consideration, I have brought you this.

645
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:04,616
Whoa.

646
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:07,619
What is it? A birdhouse?

647
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:11,088
- What's it for?
- Every club needs a secret mailbox.

648
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:15,659
To keep our correspondence safely in
the hedge between our two nations.

649
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:20,067
This one is for secrets,
never to be told.

650
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:26,040
An alliance then?

651
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:29,873
Well, then, Private.

652
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,078
As General, I say...

653
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:34,514
welcome
to the Pickwick Club.

654
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:37,648
Yes!

655
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,217
Your sister's really not coming?

656
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:43,755
She said she's not interested
in "primitive rituals."

657
00:35:43,757 --> 00:35:46,891
Tonight is going to be
anything but primitive.

658
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:49,594
Oh!
Your step-mom is the best!

659
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:51,098
I know, right?

660
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:55,632
That's a cute little dress.

661
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:58,538
- It was my grandma's.
- How couture.

662
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,940
Just throwing this
out there.

663
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:06,679
I think I might have something
a little bit more flattering.

664
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:09,646
Totally goes with our color
scheme, don't you think?

665
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:10,815
- Um...
- Here.

666
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:12,250
You definitely have
the body for it.

667
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:14,918
Yes, I would kill
for that stomach.

668
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,788
- Really?
- Face it, Meg. You're hot.

669
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,257
- Everyone knows you're hot.
- Especially Brian.

670
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:20,991
I heard he was dating
Miss Cape Cod.

671
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:23,563
Well, here's to
the best prom ever!

672
00:36:30,804 --> 00:36:32,203
<i>♪ Pack it up ♪</i>

673
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:33,837

00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:38,009

00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:39,411

<i>♪ Used to dream and now

678
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:18,016
I'm gonna go dance
with my friends.

679
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:31,695
Let's go.

680
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:32,831

681
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,732

686
00:37:46,446 --> 00:37:49,183
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

687
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:55,386
Sorry. It's...
stuffy up there.

688
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:57,422
We're in a basement.

689
00:37:57,424 --> 00:37:59,994
Oh!

690
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:07,799
That's gross.

691
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:11,038
That's Jäger.
It's an acquired taste.

692
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:15,009
Maybe this will help.

693
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,212
Meg?

694
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,148
What are you doing here?

695
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,921
Jo said you might need a
"wing woman" or wingman.

696
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:29,922
I don't.

697
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:33,159
Okay.

698
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:38,931
What's with Willy Wonka?

699
00:38:40,165 --> 00:38:42,201
Nothing.

700
00:38:58,384 --> 00:39:01,284
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

701
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:03,156
What's the problem?

702
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:06,192
I don't want to do this.

703
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,964
Fine. There's plenty
other girls that do.

704
00:39:40,226 --> 00:39:41,762
Meg!

705
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:45,862
Laurie send you?

706
00:39:45,864 --> 00:39:47,767
I thought you might
need a ride.

707
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:49,869
Well, I don't.

708
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:53,206
Hungry?

709
00:39:55,842 --> 00:39:57,875
There you go.

710
00:39:57,877 --> 00:40:00,143
Come on.

711
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:01,881
Burgers and fries.

712
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:12,223
So did you at least
get a slow dance in?

713
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:15,328
- Nobody does that anymore.
- What? That's stupid.

714
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:18,895
You look
really pretty.

715
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:21,367
Yeah, I doubt that.

716
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:26,170
I'm so stupid.
I just...

717
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:28,375
I wanted to be like
everyone else for once.

718
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:32,045
I don't know.
Fitting in is overrated.

719
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,949
Why are you
so sweet to me?

720
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:40,585
You're a dove.

721
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:42,052
You can't be mean to a dove.

722
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:44,188
It's impossible.
Can't do it.

723
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,793
Oh.

724
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:51,831
Hey oh!

725
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,532
Oh!

726
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:58,636
I didn't know that you were coming.
I'm such mess right now.

727
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:00,808
It's okay. I'm just
here to pick up Jo.

728
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:07,210
Jo! Laurie's here!

729
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:12,884
- So, what you got goin' on here?
- I finished my Paris skyline.

730
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:15,186
- Nobody cares.
- Laurie does.

731
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:16,219
It's very nice.

732
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:20,391
Come on. I don't want
to miss the previews.

733
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:22,226
Sorry, I'm in the zone.
Hold on one second.

734
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:24,398
I'm onto something really good. Hold on!

735
00:41:25,364 --> 00:41:26,429
Hold on!

736
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:27,967
Okay!

737
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:32,003
- Can I come?
- No.

738
00:41:32,005 --> 00:41:35,940
- Why not?
- Because we don't want you to come.

739
00:41:35,942 --> 00:41:38,009
- That's not true.
- No.

740
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:39,210
She's not coming.

741
00:41:39,212 --> 00:41:42,212
I'm not a kid. You don't get
to tell me what to do anymore!

742
00:41:42,214 --> 00:41:46,516
Actually, you are. By definition, in fact.
Look it up.

743
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:48,119
Okay, Jo, easy.
Come on.

744
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:51,355
You don't have to deal with her
all day like I do.

745
00:41:51,357 --> 00:41:54,291
I just want to see a
movie with my sister.

746
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:57,263
You just want to
see a movie with Laurie.

747
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:00,965
She's so obsessed
with you.

748
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,599
It's sickening.

749
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:04,937
I hate you!

750
00:42:12,545 --> 00:42:16,413
Hey, it's not too late.
You wanna go to Scoops maybe?

751
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:19,150
Laurie, no. I don't have time
to go get ice cream right now.

752
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:21,518
I am so inspired by that movie!

753
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,688
Inspired? I thought you
said you hated it.

754
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,458
I did. But it just inspired
me to write something better.

755
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,527
'Cause if that crap is
getting made into movies,

756
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:32,429
my scripts are
going to crush it.

757
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:34,565
Oh, I thought you were
a novelist, not a screenwriter.

758
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,201
I am. I just... I'm gonna do both.
How hard can it be?

759
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:39,302
Have you seen my notebook?

760
00:42:39,304 --> 00:42:41,572
You know, I don't know why you
don't just use my old laptop.

761
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:45,041
What would happen if it randomly
deleted all of my work?

762
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:47,978
But a hard copy,
you never lose.

763
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,315
- Well, except for right now.
- It is not lost. It is misplaced.

764
00:42:52,317 --> 00:42:55,288
Okay, uh, guess I'll...
see you later then?

765
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:57,958
Okay, bye.

766
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,233
Still moping?

767
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:11,501
Still looking for something?

768
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:12,603
Give me that!

769
00:43:12,605 --> 00:43:15,572
Amy! Amy! Amy!
Give me that.

770
00:43:15,574 --> 00:43:18,208
Amy, give me that.
Amy! Amy!

771
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,212
- Open the door, you little brat!
- You should have let me come!

772
00:43:21,214 --> 00:43:24,014
- No one wanted you there!
- Laurie said he did!

773
00:43:24,016 --> 00:43:27,550
He also said he liked your paintings,
but he lied so you don't cry about it.

774
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:32,088
Why do you have
to be so difficult?

775
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,425
- He's my friend too!
- No, he's not.

776
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:38,231
He thinks you're stupid and immature,
just like the rest of us do.

777
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,299
No!

778
00:43:50,676 --> 00:43:53,309
I'm going to kill you!

779
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:55,579
- What's going on?
- She burned it!

780
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:57,148
Burned what?
Put that down!

781
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,386
My notebook!
What is wrong with you?

782
00:44:01,753 --> 00:44:04,123
You! Go to your room.

783
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:05,558
Honey.

784
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:12,131
Honey.

785
00:44:12,665 --> 00:44:17,268
I'm sorry. Hey...

786
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,206
I will never write
like that again!

787
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:28,545
I know you're angry
right now and I get it.

788
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:30,581
It's going to
take some time to heal.

789
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,516
But I promise you,

790
00:44:32,518 --> 00:44:37,224
the longer it takes for you to forgive
her, the longer your pain will last.

791
00:44:39,725 --> 00:44:44,163
All right, Rene, you ready for
a wild ride into the sunset?

792
00:44:45,464 --> 00:44:47,130
Come on.

793
00:44:47,132 --> 00:44:49,233
Crap. Buckle
on the cinch is busted.

794
00:44:49,235 --> 00:44:50,867
We'll have to double up.

795
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:53,237
Serious?

796
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:55,572
What? Do you think
I want to ride with you?

797
00:44:55,574 --> 00:44:57,608
- It's either this or we can't go.
- Fine.

798
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,576
We only have an hour of daylight.

799
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:01,080
- Come on.
- Come on.

800
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:08,719
Jo! Laurie!

801
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:10,688
Guys!
I wanna come with!

802
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,190
Jo! Jo! Wait up!

803
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:15,391
Hold up, guys!
Guys, wait!

804
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:16,527
Jo!

805
00:45:16,529 --> 00:45:17,531
Whoa, whoa.

806
00:45:19,197 --> 00:45:21,201

- What do you think?

Hey, look.

00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:13,317
Is that Saint?

819
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:14,621
Sure looks like it.

820
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:18,922
Hey. Hey.

821
00:46:18,924 --> 00:46:20,757
- Saint.
- Saint!

822
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:22,726
Easy, boy. Hey.

823
00:46:22,728 --> 00:46:23,726
Saint.

824
00:46:23,728 --> 00:46:27,831
Yeah, come here.
No, no. Saint.

825
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,967
- Jo, you don't think...
- No.

826
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:32,405
- There's no way.
- She's back at the barn.

827
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:37,409
- Amy!
- Hey, Amy!

828
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:39,311
Amy!

829
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:42,612
Amy, yell if you can hear me.

830
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:44,717
Saddle.

831
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:48,754
Amy?

832
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,491
- Amy?
- Amy!

833
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:53,426
Amy!

834
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:57,364
Amy. No. No, no, no.

835
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,362
Help me.
Please.

836
00:46:59,364 --> 00:47:01,965
Easy, easy. Amy.

837
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:04,235
- Amy!
- Easy. Easy, easy.

838
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:06,436
Oh, my God.

839
00:47:06,438 --> 00:47:07,804
Amy.

840
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:08,973
Amy!

841
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:11,541
Jo, it's okay.
Hold this. Hold this on her.

842
00:47:11,543 --> 00:47:13,576
Hold it right there. I'm
gonna go get some help.

843
00:47:13,578 --> 00:47:16,515
- No. Amy.
- It's okay.

844
00:47:20,018 --> 00:47:23,587
- Amy.
- Come on.

845
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:24,590
Amy.

846
00:47:25,525 --> 00:47:29,196
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

847
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:37,604
Please.
Help.

848
00:47:40,306 --> 00:47:43,340
Amy.

849
00:47:43,342 --> 00:47:45,009
I just wanted
to come with you.

850
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:47,911
I know.
I should have let you.

851
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:49,947
I'm sorry
I destroyed your journal.

852
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:52,549
I don't care
about the journal.

853
00:47:52,551 --> 00:47:54,617
Okay, I so cared
about the journal.

854
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:56,690
It was my entire life's work.
How can I not?

855
00:47:58,023 --> 00:48:03,893
But, I'd rather lose every word
I ever wrote than lose you.

856
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:05,628
That's a lot of words.

857
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,701
I'll write a heck
of a lot more.

858
00:48:11,002 --> 00:48:13,505
Maybe this will help.

859
00:48:13,938 --> 00:48:15,375
Amy.

860
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:19,909
I know that sometimes you might
not like me much, but...

861
00:48:19,911 --> 00:48:21,679
No.

862
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:23,547
Do not say that.

863
00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:26,349
We are just...
different.

864
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:27,684
<i>And know what 'tis to pity.</i>

865
00:48:27,686 --> 00:48:31,755
Let gentleness
my strong enforcement be,

866
00:48:31,757 --> 00:48:36,626
in the which hope
I blush and hide my sword.

867
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:39,663
True it is that
we have seen better days

868
00:48:39,665 --> 00:48:43,670
and have with holy bell
been knolled to church.

869
00:48:45,571 --> 00:48:48,005
I like watching
the rehearsals.

870
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:49,806
Well, the Duke
needs to step it up.

871
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:50,708
He's still
not off book.

872
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,780
Just let the creative
process inspire you.

873
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:57,947
Or just try to enjoy it.

874
00:48:57,949 --> 00:49:02,386
I will have you know I love plays,
I just hate this monologue.

875
00:49:02,388 --> 00:49:04,657
What? How? Why?
It's beautiful.

876
00:49:05,857 --> 00:49:08,494
Beautiful?
It's depressing.

877
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:11,728
All the world's a stage

878
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,398
and all the men and women
merely players.

879
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,366
They have
their exits and entrances,

880
00:49:16,368 --> 00:49:19,902
and one man in his time
plays many parts.

881
00:49:19,904 --> 00:49:23,440
It is one of Bill's
most depressing soliloquies.

882
00:49:23,442 --> 00:49:29,112
I like to think a life is a bit more
meaningful than playing a part on a stage.

883
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:34,016
Shining morning face creeping like
a snail unwillingly to school.

884
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:36,322
- I don't see it that way at all.
- No?

885
00:49:38,456 --> 00:49:40,659
Please enlighten me,
Professor Bhaer.

886
00:49:42,594 --> 00:49:45,596
I think it's about growth
and accepting change.

887
00:49:45,598 --> 00:49:47,197
We come into this world perfect.

888
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,469
Then we go through all these stages of
learning, shifting, changing, breaking even.

889
00:49:52,471 --> 00:49:54,570
And we become
something new,

890
00:49:54,572 --> 00:49:59,545
something... far from perfect
but perfectly unique.

891
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:03,514
I find that inspiring.

892
00:50:03,516 --> 00:50:06,750
I guess that is one way
to think about it.

893
00:50:06,752 --> 00:50:12,489
"Last scene of all, that
ends this strange history,

894
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:14,958
is second childishness
and mere oblivion,

895
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,532
sans teeth, sans taste,
sans every... thing."

896
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:23,534
<i>I'm scared.</i>

897
00:50:23,536 --> 00:50:26,103
You have a hundred letters in your hand.
Open 'em. One will be a yes.

898
00:50:26,105 --> 00:50:29,038
I still can't believe
you only applied to one school.

899
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,741
When you're meant for the best,
you don't settle for less.

900
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:34,076
I'd settle for UMass
Lowell at this point.

901
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:36,045
Just open them.

902
00:50:36,047 --> 00:50:37,780
I can't. You do it.

903
00:50:37,782 --> 00:50:40,420
- Okay.
- Uh, start with this one.

904
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:43,923
Okay.

905
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:49,992
Right.
"Mr. Laurie Laurence,

906
00:50:49,994 --> 00:50:52,195
thank you for your application
to Stanford University.

907
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:56,065
We are pleased to announce your
acceptance for the fall semester."

908
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:58,469
- I got in?
- Yes! I knew you would.

909
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:00,540
I can't believe it!

910
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,607
Yes.

911
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:04,942
Let's open the rest.

912
00:51:04,944 --> 00:51:08,078
Oh! Throw 'em away! Burn 'em! I don't care.
I'm going to Stanford!

913
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:12,014
Okay, okay.
Your turn.

914
00:51:12,016 --> 00:51:14,217
You do the honors.

915
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:15,922
With pleasure.

916
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:25,962
"Miss Josephine March, We thank you for
your interest in the University of Oxford.

917
00:51:25,964 --> 00:51:27,699
It is with regret that..."

918
00:51:35,574 --> 00:51:37,976
Jo, I'm sorry.

919
00:52:14,013 --> 00:52:16,616
You've got to get goin'. You're
going to miss orientation.

920
00:52:17,882 --> 00:52:20,052
Stanford waits for no man.

921
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:22,819
It's not fair.

922
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:25,221
- You're so much smarter than me.
- It's fine.

923
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:29,192
I'm gonna hang out here, write a
few novels and hang out with Beth.

924
00:52:29,194 --> 00:52:30,964
You're gonna be back
before we know it.

925
00:52:32,998 --> 00:52:35,534
- I'll text you when I get there.
- Yeah.

926
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:41,907
Do all the things
for me.

927
00:52:43,976 --> 00:52:44,608
I will.

It's so good. You have
to go to New York.

942
00:53:57,248 --> 00:54:00,116
Really? You think so?

943
00:54:00,118 --> 00:54:01,086
Yes.

944
00:54:01,987 --> 00:54:05,124
Okay. Was it too much
to kill off Theonia?

945
00:54:07,025 --> 00:54:08,125
No.

946
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,862
All the best stories
have some tragedy.

947
00:54:13,398 --> 00:54:16,233
What if Marek
was actually a girl,

948
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:19,168
who dresses up as a boy
to make her journey safer,

949
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:22,338
but then by the third act
she can no longer hide?

950
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,676
Beth.

951
00:54:25,043 --> 00:54:26,812
That is genius!

952
00:54:29,415 --> 00:54:32,282
I think that Clarissa should still
fall in love with the Prince.

953
00:54:32,284 --> 00:54:34,284
It's not a love story!

954
00:54:34,286 --> 00:54:35,755
Isn't everything?

955
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:39,993
Overall, though,
I loved it.

956
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,728
I don't think I'll ever be as good
at anything as you are at writing.

957
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,766
You're way better
at being a good human.

958
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:50,203
I can help you
with that.

959
00:54:51,436 --> 00:54:53,335
Oh, and piano.

960
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,739
Mmm.
Can't help you there.

961
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:56,773
You're pretty much
hopeless.

962
00:54:59,478 --> 00:55:00,780
I just...

963
00:55:02,313 --> 00:55:06,685
I want to write something that
won't be forgotten after I die.

964
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:09,722
You will.

965
00:55:10,288 --> 00:55:11,723
I know it.

966
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:20,163
- It's the one.
- What do you mean?

967
00:55:20,165 --> 00:55:22,701
You know. The draft to
send out to publishers?

968
00:55:26,505 --> 00:55:29,809
Jo. I-I don't...

969
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,409
- It's not quite ready.
- How do you know?

970
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:36,279
You haven't finished it yet.

971
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:37,447
I just know.

972
00:55:37,449 --> 00:55:40,817
It's a grueling process.
Listen.

973
00:55:40,819 --> 00:55:44,920
Madeleine L'Engle
racked up 26 rejections

974
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:46,155
before <i>Wrinkle</i>
was published.

975
00:55:46,157 --> 00:55:48,058
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

976
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,326
It's supposed to
give you perspective.

977
00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:53,797
Even Freddy Bhaer wrote
an impressive 14 novels

978
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:54,931
before he was published.

979
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:57,266
Oh, "Freddy Bhaer."
Wow.

980
00:55:57,268 --> 00:55:59,304
You love throwing your name
in there, right?

981
00:56:00,772 --> 00:56:03,206
Is it any good?

982
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,509
Some say yes.

983
00:56:05,511 --> 00:56:08,313
The <i>New Yorker</i> said "lacks
linguistic vision," so...

984
00:56:09,514 --> 00:56:11,114
You should
read it sometime.

985
00:56:11,116 --> 00:56:12,185
I will.

986
00:56:13,418 --> 00:56:16,018
Right after
you send off my draft.

987
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:20,292
Maybe... Maybe it's time to
take a break from this one.

988
00:56:21,826 --> 00:56:23,058
Work on something new.

989
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,994
Something new?

990
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:26,962
I've been working on this
for ten years.

991
00:56:26,964 --> 00:56:28,799
That's exactly
why it might be helpful

992
00:56:28,801 --> 00:56:30,866
to try working on something
else for a change.

993
00:56:30,868 --> 00:56:32,201
So you're not going to help me?

994
00:56:32,203 --> 00:56:33,869
What do you think
I've been doing?

995
00:56:33,871 --> 00:56:36,172
I don't know, actually.

996
00:56:36,174 --> 00:56:39,208
Why do you spend so much time with
me if you don't think I can do it?

997
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,545
I didn't say that, and I thought
we liked spending time together.

998
00:56:41,547 --> 00:56:43,282
That's beside the point!

999
00:56:44,282 --> 00:56:45,982
Is it?

1000
00:56:45,984 --> 00:56:48,154
Josephine.

1001
00:56:49,888 --> 00:56:52,087
- I have to go.
- We need to talk about this.

1002
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:54,226
I don't want to talk about it.

1003
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:04,433
Marmee, I just want to say
before you say anything...

1004
00:57:04,435 --> 00:57:05,904
<i>Listen to me.
It's back.</i>

1005
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:08,137
You have to eat it!

1006
00:57:08,139 --> 00:57:09,471
I don't wanna eat it.
It's so gross!

1007
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:11,474
You asked for a dare!

1008
00:57:11,476 --> 00:57:12,976
Don't eat it
if you don't want to.

1009
00:57:12,978 --> 00:57:14,076
What the heck,
you guys?

1010
00:57:14,078 --> 00:57:16,246
- Come back.
- Oh, my God!

1011
00:57:16,248 --> 00:57:17,114
Let it go.

1012
00:57:17,116 --> 00:57:20,150
Whatever! I heard
you the first time!

1013
00:57:20,152 --> 00:57:22,085
Okay, okay.
We're going on.

1014
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:25,387
It's my turn.
It's my turn. Okay.

1015
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:27,456
Laurie, truth or dare.

1016
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:28,958
- Truth.
- Coward.

1017
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,862
Who do you think
is the prettiest girl here?

1018
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:33,864
Oh, you are lame.

1019
00:57:33,866 --> 00:57:36,099
Easy. Meg.
No question.

1020
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:40,637
Now, Brooke, um, what's your
thoughts on the matter? Hmm?

1021
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:43,172
You know, I only see inner beauty.
So...

1022
00:57:43,174 --> 00:57:45,942
Oh! Okay. All right.
That's enough.

1023
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:47,543
Look, she's pretty.

1024
00:57:47,545 --> 00:57:49,246
Inside and out.
We all get it.

1025
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:51,882
- This is stupid. Let's play Extreme Sardine.
- Yeah!

1026
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:57,186
I say the last person to find me has
to lick every one of our big toes.

1027
00:57:57,188 --> 00:57:58,255
Oh!

1028
00:57:58,257 --> 00:58:00,357
One, two,

1029
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:03,960
three, four, five,

1030
00:58:03,962 --> 00:58:08,398
six, seven, eight, nine,

1031
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,969
ten.

1032
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:12,237
Oh.

1033
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,910
I see you!

1034
00:58:32,523 --> 00:58:33,993
Jo?

1035
00:59:23,407 --> 00:59:26,076
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm so sorry. The...

1036
00:59:26,078 --> 00:59:29,378
You come in here,
you play my favorite piece,

1037
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,051
and you don't have
the decency to finish it?

1038
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,183
Hmm?

1039
00:59:34,185 --> 00:59:35,719
Go.

1040
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:37,420
I-I'm sorry.

1041
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:39,755
As well you should be.

1042
00:59:39,757 --> 00:59:43,726
And I think that you should come
over here three days a week

1043
00:59:43,728 --> 00:59:45,964
and play whatever you like.

1044
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:49,502
Do we have a deal?

1045
00:59:50,402 --> 00:59:52,168
Well, then I...

1046
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:55,975
I think this calls for a
little Beethoven, don't you?

1047
01:01:17,322 --> 01:01:19,558
Chronic myelogenous leukemia.

1048
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:23,159
Leukemia?

1049
01:01:23,161 --> 01:01:25,063
She's young, so there's
a lot we can do.

1050
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:29,435
- Cancer?
- It's a type of cancer.

1051
01:01:30,402 --> 01:01:33,503
So, okay.
What can we do?

1052
01:01:33,505 --> 01:01:37,474
We want to start with radiation
and chemotherapy immediately.

1053
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:41,543
It will be very hard on her.
She's already quite frail.

1054
01:01:41,545 --> 01:01:45,215
- But she seems like a fighter.
- Do not call her frail!

1055
01:01:45,217 --> 01:01:46,683
You don't even know her!

1056
01:01:46,685 --> 01:01:48,550
Josephine.
Josephine.

1057
01:01:48,552 --> 01:01:51,257
Meg, honey, will you
go get her please? Go.

1058
01:01:52,857 --> 01:01:55,427
- I'm really sorry.
- It's a lot.

1059
01:01:56,761 --> 01:01:58,197
Uhh!

1060
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:10,476
I'm sorry.

1061
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,136
It's gonna be okay.

1062
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:41,503
What if I get sick too?

1063
01:02:41,505 --> 01:02:45,507
What if I die before
I get to do anything?

1064
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:50,679
I've never been in love.
I've never had a boyfriend.

1065
01:02:50,681 --> 01:02:52,250
Never even been kissed.

1066
01:02:54,252 --> 01:02:58,257
Hey. You're gonna be okay.

1067
01:03:00,424 --> 01:03:04,194
I promise. You're not gonna
die without being kissed.

1068
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:05,929
How do you know?

1069
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:07,465
I just know.

1070
01:03:08,433 --> 01:03:10,400
Even if I have to
do it myself,

1071
01:03:10,402 --> 01:03:11,800
I'm gonna make it happen.

1072
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:15,406
Fine.

1073
01:03:21,813 --> 01:03:24,913
Excuse me, sir, you can't go
past here without signing in.

1074
01:03:24,915 --> 01:03:27,683
I'm not a <i>sir,</i> sir.

1075
01:03:27,685 --> 01:03:31,520
Check your clipboard. Name's Jo March.
I'm already signed in.

1076
01:03:31,522 --> 01:03:34,626
You're tired, honey.
I'm sorry.

1077
01:03:36,328 --> 01:03:38,697
- You're looking better though.
- Thanks.

1078
01:03:40,364 --> 01:03:42,599
- Where have you been?
- I was so worried about you.

1079
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:45,969
Beth, do not worry about me. I'm fine.
I-I'm sorry. I freaked out.

1080
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:50,572
I know. I-I felt so helpless,
and so I had to do something.

1081
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:53,275
So I started on the Internet,
didn't know what to do.

1082
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:56,913
Horrible idea. WebMD
scared the crap out of me.

1083
01:03:56,915 --> 01:04:00,916
And then I started Googling
all these cures and treatments

1084
01:04:00,918 --> 01:04:04,723
and three hours in, I realized
that's not what you need.

1085
01:04:06,023 --> 01:04:11,628
Beth, I know
you're gonna fight this.

1086
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,532
And I know
you're gonna beat it.

1087
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:15,998
You have to.

1088
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,237
So, one thing
that I promise...

1089
01:04:20,471 --> 01:04:24,607
that I'm going to be by your
side for every bit of it.

1090
01:04:24,609 --> 01:04:28,444
So if you have to go on a special
diet of spinach juice and tree bark,

1091
01:04:28,446 --> 01:04:30,380
I will eat it with you.

1092
01:04:30,382 --> 01:04:32,614
If you have to bathe
in essential oils twice a day,

1093
01:04:32,616 --> 01:04:36,386
I will join that pyramid scheme,
and I will get you those oils.

1094
01:04:36,388 --> 01:04:40,759
If you're gonna lose
that gorgeous hair...

1095
01:04:44,895 --> 01:04:46,631
well, soldier...

1096
01:04:53,505 --> 01:04:55,840
I'm losing it with you.

1097
01:04:56,907 --> 01:04:58,444
Wow!

1098
01:04:59,444 --> 01:05:02,011
That's really bald.

1099
01:05:03,447 --> 01:05:06,516
God, it feels like
the head of an alien.

1100
01:05:06,518 --> 01:05:08,650
What did you do with your hair?
Did you donate it?

1101
01:05:08,652 --> 01:05:11,688
No, Mom. I sold it to pay
for that stupid candy machine.

1102
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,389
Yeah, they've got a good
selection down there.

1103
01:05:13,391 --> 01:05:15,491
Gosh!

1104
01:05:15,493 --> 01:05:16,826
Jo!

1105
01:05:16,828 --> 01:05:18,895
How did you... Why?

1106
01:05:18,897 --> 01:05:21,299
Your one beauty.

1107
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:30,609
Honey, cheer up. She's
gonna be all right.

1108
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:35,078
I shouldn't be this upset.

1109
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:40,416
We all are, honey.
Come on, Jo.

1110
01:05:40,418 --> 01:05:41,753
It's natural.

1111
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:47,857
It's okay to be upset. I know
she means the world to you.

1112
01:05:47,859 --> 01:05:51,694
No, it's... I never
realized how ugly I am.

1113
01:05:51,696 --> 01:05:54,130
Oh, honey,
your hair will grow back.

1114
01:05:54,132 --> 01:05:56,632
Not for forever.

1115
01:05:56,634 --> 01:05:59,000
Trust me, when you
look back at this time,

1116
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,672
you're not gonna care
how you looked.

1117
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:06,679
Besides. What's the most important
is the workings of your mind.

1118
01:06:07,444 --> 01:06:10,348
Your humor, your kindness.

1119
01:06:10,982 --> 01:06:12,518
Your courage.

1120
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,457
Don't tell Bethy, okay?

1121
01:06:20,692 --> 01:06:22,525
Of course not.

1122
01:06:22,527 --> 01:06:24,897
She's lucky to have you.

1123
01:06:25,996 --> 01:06:28,466
- Are you all ready?
- Yeah.

1124
01:06:29,768 --> 01:06:30,866
Oh, they're coming.

01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:51,020
I think we could use
some accompaniment.

1131
01:06:51,022 --> 01:06:52,857
Would you do the honors?

1132
01:06:55,759 --> 01:06:57,628
Merry Christmas.

1133
01:07:08,172 --> 01:07:09,771
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.

1134
01:07:09,773 --> 01:07:12,808
Of course. Here.

1135
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:14,513
Play something.

1136
01:07:20,918 --> 01:07:24,219

- Oh! Honey!
- Oh.

1142
01:08:08,565 --> 01:08:11,035
Bethy. Hey, my girl.

1143
01:08:12,603 --> 01:08:16,204
Look at us,
a couple wounded soldiers.

1144
01:08:16,206 --> 01:08:19,175
- I miss you, Dad.
- I've missed you so much.

1145
01:08:19,177 --> 01:08:21,810
I love you.

1146
01:08:21,812 --> 01:08:26,114
Oh, I've missed you guys
so much.

1147
01:08:26,116 --> 01:08:28,020
Oh, how I've missed
my little women.

1148
01:08:38,663 --> 01:08:40,262
<i>Hey, Bethy, it's me.</i>

1149
01:08:40,264 --> 01:08:42,732
<i>I am on the train back home.</i>

1150
01:08:42,734 --> 01:08:44,934
<i>Don't worry. You beat this once,</i>

1151
01:08:44,936 --> 01:08:48,703
<i>and you are going to
beat it again. Okay?</i>

1152
01:08:48,705 --> 01:08:51,476
<i>I love you.
I'll be there soon.</i>

1153
01:08:55,946 --> 01:08:58,948
<i>It'll be summer, Beth
is in remission. It's perfect timing.</i>

1154
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:01,951
<i>We weren't supposed to
get married until we're 30, Meg!</i>

1155
01:09:01,953 --> 01:09:05,921
- You broke the oath!
- It was a stupid oath that we made when we were kids.

1156
01:09:05,923 --> 01:09:08,823
Why do you even want
to get married?

1157
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:12,627
We don't live in the 1700s. We
don't have to rely on men anymore.

1158
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:15,096
- Because I love him.
- Oh, how do you even know?

1159
01:09:15,098 --> 01:09:18,634
Look, I just know. And I
really need you to support me.

1160
01:09:18,636 --> 01:09:19,705
Well, I can't.

1161
01:09:20,804 --> 01:09:22,171
I know you don't understand

1162
01:09:22,173 --> 01:09:25,274
why I wanna be a mom and
get married and have kids,

1163
01:09:25,276 --> 01:09:26,609
but it's what I want.

1164
01:09:26,611 --> 01:09:28,610
I don't believe you.

1165
01:09:28,612 --> 01:09:31,314
It's not your castle.
It's mine.

1166
01:09:31,316 --> 01:09:33,315
Meg, just remember this.

1167
01:09:33,317 --> 01:09:37,052
One day when you're 40 years
old, you're gonna wake up

1168
01:09:37,054 --> 01:09:40,055
and you're gonna look at
your wrinkly face in the mirror,

1169
01:09:40,057 --> 01:09:45,760
and you're gonna ask yourself,
"What did I do with my life,

1170
01:09:45,762 --> 01:09:49,799
except give up everything
for a man?"

1171
01:09:49,801 --> 01:09:55,203
How dare you belittle
my life and my dreams?

1172
01:09:55,205 --> 01:09:58,640
I have always been there for you with
your work and all of your ambitions,

1173
01:09:58,642 --> 01:10:01,042
no matter how insane
they seemed to me.

1174
01:10:01,044 --> 01:10:04,980
I'm not asking you to change,
all I'm asking... Jo!

1175
01:10:06,784 --> 01:10:10,920
All I'm asking is that you
be by my side for one day

1176
01:10:10,922 --> 01:10:14,959
to support me in the life I have
chosen to live, without judgment.

1177
01:10:15,994 --> 01:10:17,963
You seriously can't
give me that?

1178
01:10:20,731 --> 01:10:22,833
How selfish are you?

1179
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:44,119
Dove's right.
We're growing up.

1180
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:45,320
You have to deal with that.

1181
01:10:45,322 --> 01:10:49,257
So, I'm just supposed to sit
around, let her ruin her life?

1182
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:53,931
Well, that's the point.
It's her life, it's not yours.

1183
01:10:57,401 --> 01:11:00,202
She's going to regret this.

1184
01:11:00,204 --> 01:11:02,941
If you don't go to this wedding,
you will regret it.

1185
01:12:41,338 --> 01:12:46,108
A toast to the college grad!
You're a real Stanford man now.

1186
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:48,377
Cheers to a piece of paper.

1187
01:12:48,379 --> 01:12:51,113
- So, what's next?
- I don't know.

1188
01:12:51,115 --> 01:12:54,949
Part of me wants to just chill
out and work on my music,

1189
01:12:54,951 --> 01:12:58,988
but there's so much pressure
to go out and get a real job.

1190
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:01,290
Grandpa wants me to move
to London

1191
01:13:01,292 --> 01:13:04,960
and learn the exciting world
of bond trading.

1192
01:13:04,962 --> 01:13:08,329
No, that is awesome.
You have to do it.

1193
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:09,931
But what about my music?

1194
01:13:09,933 --> 01:13:12,568
Do both. It's London.

1195
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:15,907
Come on.
You can't pass it up.

1196
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,877
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1197
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:24,913
You know I want to, but I can't.
Not yet anyway.

1198
01:13:24,915 --> 01:13:28,917
Why not? You've always said you
wanted to get out of here, so do it.

1199
01:13:28,919 --> 01:13:32,289
I have classes at Lowell.

1200
01:13:34,191 --> 01:13:37,128
I-I cannot be
that far from Beth.

1201
01:13:41,164 --> 01:13:43,998
What if we both go
to New York instead?

1202
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,905
- You hate New York.
- So what?

1203
01:13:47,838 --> 01:13:49,305
It's closer to the family.

1204
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:51,172
Then we could be together.

1205
01:13:51,174 --> 01:13:52,474
No.

1206
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:55,243
No. You need to go
to Europe.

1207
01:13:55,245 --> 01:13:58,948
- Do not change your plans for me.
- But I want to be with you.

1208
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:03,018
I will come visit you
whenever I can.

1209
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:07,057
Jo, listen to me.
I want to be with you.

1210
01:14:10,294 --> 01:14:11,263
What?

1211
01:14:12,597 --> 01:14:14,833
I love you, Jo March.

1212
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:17,369
Whoa! Wha...

1213
01:14:19,203 --> 01:14:21,871
Okay, okay. Don't be stubborn
because I know you love me too.

1214
01:14:21,873 --> 01:14:23,375
- I do, but...
- But what?

1215
01:14:24,609 --> 01:14:27,009
- You're like my brother.
- But I'm not.

1216
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:30,112
- But I don't love you like that.
- Yes, you do.

1217
01:14:30,114 --> 01:14:32,247
Jo, I'm your favorite person
in this whole world.

1218
01:14:32,249 --> 01:14:36,051
Yeah, you-you are,
but it's... it's...

1219
01:14:36,053 --> 01:14:39,188
No, what we have is... It
is not that kind of love.

1220
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:42,323
- It's...
- Because you won't...

1221
01:14:42,325 --> 01:14:47,429
It's not you, Laurie. It's just I don't
know if that's what I want, Laurie.

1222
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:48,963
- Yes, you do.
- With anyone ever!

1223
01:14:48,965 --> 01:14:51,433
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you will! One day you will!

1224
01:14:51,435 --> 01:14:53,237
You're gonna find someone...

1225
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:58,109
that's gonna make it impossible
for you to say no.

1226
01:15:01,445 --> 01:15:03,979
It's just not gonna be me.

1227
01:15:03,981 --> 01:15:07,052
Laurie, it's... Laurie!

1228
01:15:12,455 --> 01:15:14,426
Laurie!

1229
01:15:19,629 --> 01:15:21,529
<i>Hey, Freddy, it's Jo.</i>

1230
01:15:21,531 --> 01:15:25,266
<i>I had some family stuff come up, so
I'm gonna be going home for a while.</i>

1231
01:15:25,268 --> 01:15:28,269
<i>Hopefully, I'll see you
after the holidays.</i>

1232
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:30,405
It seems like
we're missing something.

1233
01:15:30,407 --> 01:15:32,140
That's not it.

1234
01:15:32,142 --> 01:15:34,310
- No, the other one.
- Which one?

1235
01:15:34,312 --> 01:15:36,010
Yeah.

1236
01:15:36,012 --> 01:15:38,546
Wow. It looks so great.

1237
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:41,283
- I think we're good, right?
- No. No, not yet, honey.

1238
01:15:41,285 --> 01:15:45,023
Could you find a home
for this?

1239
01:15:48,558 --> 01:15:50,326
Jo!

1240
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:51,993
Hi!

1241
01:15:51,995 --> 01:15:53,295
Are you kidding me?

1242
01:15:53,297 --> 01:15:55,197
And it's twins. So...

1243
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:58,967
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to surprise you.

1244
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:02,171
Oh, please! You wanted
to see my reaction.

1245
01:16:02,173 --> 01:16:03,572
Oh.

1246
01:16:03,574 --> 01:16:05,207
It was entertaining.

1247
01:16:05,209 --> 01:16:09,281
- Oh, Marmee.
- Welcome home, Jo! Welcome home, baby.

1248
01:16:10,614 --> 01:16:13,748
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1249
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,387
Where is she?

1250
01:16:18,188 --> 01:16:21,357
- What you been up to?
- You know me.

1251
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:24,525
Out every night,
hittin' the club.

1252
01:16:31,569 --> 01:16:33,702
I've missed you.

1253
01:16:33,704 --> 01:16:38,340
I mean, I don't miss waking up at 3:00 a.m.
every morning to:

1254
01:16:38,342 --> 01:16:43,214
"Beth. Beth, do you think
Lithgo is a good pirate name?"

1255
01:16:44,714 --> 01:16:46,217
It's not.

1256
01:16:49,352 --> 01:16:51,522
I'm sorry I haven't
visited in a while.

1257
01:16:53,023 --> 01:16:55,090
That's okay.

1258
01:16:55,092 --> 01:17:00,331
You're out making your mark
in <i>New York City.</i>

1259
01:17:01,365 --> 01:17:03,465
So proud of you.

1260
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:06,301
Waking up every morning
in a city full of...

1261
01:17:06,303 --> 01:17:07,472
I hate it.

1262
01:17:09,106 --> 01:17:11,573
- I thought you loved it.
- No.

1263
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:14,275
Well, it's New York.
Everybody says they love it.

1264
01:17:14,277 --> 01:17:17,115
You have to,
but nobody really does.

1265
01:17:19,049 --> 01:17:23,652
I thought I would feel inspired, but
instead of bringing out my creativity,

1266
01:17:23,654 --> 01:17:27,189
- it brings out my anger issues.
- Uh-oh.

1267
01:17:27,191 --> 01:17:31,225
Sometimes when I'm
walking up the subway steps,

1268
01:17:31,227 --> 01:17:34,128
and people are shoving
and on their phones,

1269
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:36,665
I just want to grab them
by the shoulders and scream,

1270
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:43,771
"Do you know there is a big,
spacious green world out there?"

1271
01:17:43,773 --> 01:17:45,343
You don't though, right?

1272
01:17:46,643 --> 01:17:53,051
One time, to a really nice
Chinese man named Han.

1273
01:17:54,451 --> 01:17:57,752
And, apparently, everybody's
dream is to be a writer.

1274
01:17:57,754 --> 01:18:01,857
Except Han. He's a fishmonger,
and he's doing great.

1275
01:18:01,859 --> 01:18:03,428
I just...

1276
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:07,197
don't think I can compete.

1277
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,233
You're the best writer
I know.

1278
01:18:11,235 --> 01:18:15,703
Well, no offense,
but you don't get out much.

1279
01:18:18,308 --> 01:18:21,710
Still think there's some
pretty juicy secrets in here.

1280
01:18:21,712 --> 01:18:24,212
Don't even think
about it.

1281
01:18:24,214 --> 01:18:27,582
I'm pretty sure we've
outgrown the club rules.

1282
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:31,487
- Maybe you old hags have.
- Amy! You made it!

1283
01:18:31,489 --> 01:18:33,454
Ooh.

1284
01:18:33,456 --> 01:18:37,126
You seriously look like this
after an international flight?

1285
01:18:37,128 --> 01:18:39,130
It was the longest flight
of my life.

1286
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:43,200
- Amy.
- Beth!

1287
01:18:47,471 --> 01:18:50,538
- I missed you.
- I missed you more.

1288
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:55,610
Mm! Whoa! We do not fit
on this like we used to.

1289
01:18:55,612 --> 01:18:58,479
Amy, I want to hear
all about Oxford.

1290
01:18:58,481 --> 01:19:01,350
One semester left, and already
two different galleries

1291
01:19:01,352 --> 01:19:03,351
wanna buy my Haslemere
landscape series.

1292
01:19:03,353 --> 01:19:04,786
What about the
"Watching Deer Triptych"?

1293
01:19:04,788 --> 01:19:06,921
- Oh, that's my favorite!
- The what?

1294
01:19:06,923 --> 01:19:09,224
So, last week, I met
with the Lisson Gallery,

1295
01:19:09,226 --> 01:19:13,228
- and they seem interested.
- That's so exciting!

1296
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:17,466
Wait, what? The what gallery? Why do I
not know what you're talking about?

1297
01:19:17,468 --> 01:19:19,734
If you answered your phone,
you would know.

1298
01:19:19,736 --> 01:19:21,636
Wait. Who dug this out?

1299
01:19:21,638 --> 01:19:23,305
Oh...

1300
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:26,377
I always want to read through
it when I'm here alone.

1301
01:19:29,746 --> 01:19:31,345
Oh, my gosh.

1302
01:19:31,347 --> 01:19:32,382
What?

1303
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:34,384
Okay.

1304
01:19:35,486 --> 01:19:37,952
I think it's time
to share this one.

1305
01:19:37,954 --> 01:19:42,558
<i>♪ I'm not afraid

1306
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,394
So, I guess now I know why you
joined the home-schooled crew.

1307
01:19:45,396 --> 01:19:48,396
Yep. And now you know why I
used to clip little pug nose.

1308
01:19:48,398 --> 01:19:50,498
I miss your
little pug nose.

1309
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:53,737
<i>♪ As they made ♪</i>

1310
01:19:56,373 --> 01:19:58,774

- I had such a crush on him.

1311
01:19:58,776 --> 01:20:00,841
You had a crush
on everybody.

1312
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:02,277
Hey!

1313
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:04,579
<i>Prom.

1314
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:10,551
<i>Chasing wine coolers with

1315
01:20:11,621 --> 01:20:14,422
<i>It was the best

1316
01:20:14,424 --> 01:20:16,390

01:20:16,392 --> 01:20:18,393

Oh, he still hates

1321
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:30,439
Then I will continue
to do so.

1322
01:20:30,441 --> 01:20:32,774
I'm just glad
you speak to him at all.

1323
01:20:32,776 --> 01:20:36,345
I think it should be illegal for
anybody under 30 to get married.

1324
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:39,848
Well, you're almost there,
so... any prospects?

1325
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:42,783
No. Not you too?

1326
01:20:42,785 --> 01:20:47,256
I'm just curious. And
vicariously living through you.

1327
01:20:47,258 --> 01:20:49,591
Hey, Jo. Do you mind
helping me with dinner?

1328
01:20:49,593 --> 01:20:53,327
Oh, sorry. We're working
on our "Heart and Soul" duet.

1329
01:20:53,329 --> 01:20:55,497
Really gonna wow
everyone this year.

1330
01:20:55,499 --> 01:20:58,567
- Just come help me, please.
- Put me on trash duty.

1331
01:20:58,569 --> 01:21:00,405
Jo, please.

1332
01:21:02,673 --> 01:21:04,739
I thought you
needed my help.

1333
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:07,376
I just said that because I
wanted to be alone for a minute.

1334
01:21:07,378 --> 01:21:09,543
Is everything okay?

1335
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:11,579
Yeah. I just wanted to catch up.

1336
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:13,748
There's so much
going on in both our lives

1337
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,551
that I don't even know what we
don't know about each other.

1338
01:21:16,553 --> 01:21:18,723
- You know what I mean?
- Not really.

1339
01:21:23,893 --> 01:21:25,629
Okay, um...

1340
01:21:27,063 --> 01:21:30,931
I wanted to tell you
about me and...

1341
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:32,967
Laurie, you made it!

1342
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:34,638
Laurie?

1343
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:37,973
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

1344
01:21:37,975 --> 01:21:39,440
Laurie.

1345
01:21:39,442 --> 01:21:40,775
Jo.

1346
01:21:44,615 --> 01:21:46,681
Laurie, I thought you
couldn't come till later.

1347
01:21:46,683 --> 01:21:50,051
I caught an earlier flight.
I wanted to surprise you guys.

1348
01:21:50,053 --> 01:21:51,853
Well, we are
definitely surprised.

1349
01:21:51,855 --> 01:21:55,857
I am so glad you're here.
Now it feels like Christmas.

1350
01:21:55,859 --> 01:21:57,359
- Hey, Laurie.
- Oh, my Bethy.

1351
01:21:57,361 --> 01:21:59,427
- Mmm.
- How are you?

1352
01:21:59,429 --> 01:22:03,064
You know me. Just happy
that everyone's home.

1353
01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:05,100
I missed my platoon.

1354
01:22:05,102 --> 01:22:09,837
Okay. What's new? I have not
talked to you in, like, forever!

1355
01:22:09,839 --> 01:22:13,841
You mean the last four e-mails that I
sent you that you didn't write back?

1356
01:22:13,843 --> 01:22:16,845
You know I'm better in person.

1357
01:22:16,847 --> 01:22:20,948
Come on. Tell me everything.
Spare me no details. None.

1358
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,486
You first.

1359
01:22:53,584 --> 01:22:55,417
You know you're gonna
be a grandpa soon.

1360
01:22:55,419 --> 01:22:57,452
- If it's a girl...
- Grandpa? No.

1361
01:22:57,454 --> 01:22:59,787
We're gonna be
grandparents, guys!

1362
01:22:59,789 --> 01:23:03,625
- I'm not ready for that. I'm not ready for Grandpa.
- Twice as good.

1363
01:23:03,627 --> 01:23:06,127
I wanna hear about the business.
How's the...

1364
01:23:06,129 --> 01:23:07,528
You know, business is good.

1365
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:09,064
He's lying!

1366
01:23:09,066 --> 01:23:12,400
He's a working man now. It's
respectable to be a working man.

1367
01:23:12,402 --> 01:23:15,103
I... I, uh, I can't complain.

1368
01:23:15,105 --> 01:23:16,904
Are you
still doing your music?

1369
01:23:16,906 --> 01:23:18,473
You know, I can't complain.

1370
01:23:18,475 --> 01:23:21,409
Gotcha. Gotcha.

1371
01:23:21,411 --> 01:23:22,778
You okay?

1372
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,646
Oops. Merry Christmas,
my pretties.

1373
01:23:25,648 --> 01:23:27,482
Aunt March!

1374
01:23:27,484 --> 01:23:29,518
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

1375
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,818
What a surprise.

1376
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:32,921
What happened to
your seniors cruise?

1377
01:23:32,923 --> 01:23:34,922
Well, I don't know.

1378
01:23:34,924 --> 01:23:38,693
I suppose the Danube has lost
its luster in my old age.

1379
01:23:38,695 --> 01:23:42,764
Aunt March, I think
that you're the only person

1380
01:23:42,766 --> 01:23:45,634
in the history of time that's
ever gotten bored with Europe.

1381
01:23:45,636 --> 01:23:48,702
- Besides Marco Polo.
- And Christopher Columbus.

1382
01:23:48,704 --> 01:23:51,006
- Countless immigrants also.
- Mm-hmm.

1383
01:23:51,008 --> 01:23:52,640
- The Vikings.
- The Beatles.

1384
01:23:52,642 --> 01:23:54,643
- One Direction.
- Tons of people, really.

1385
01:23:54,645 --> 01:23:57,112
Yeah, I get it.
Okay, got it. Ha ha!

1386
01:23:57,114 --> 01:23:58,680
Josephine,
this is for you.

1387
01:23:58,682 --> 01:23:59,848
You shouldn't have.
What?

1388
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:02,516
I didn't. I found it
on your doorstep.

1389
01:24:02,518 --> 01:24:04,552
- Oh.
- Nearly tripped over it

1390
01:24:04,554 --> 01:24:06,220
when I went to pick up
your mail.

1391
01:24:06,222 --> 01:24:08,523
Can't say "Grandpa."
Somethin' else.

1392
01:24:08,525 --> 01:24:11,827
Pappy, pappy.
Poppy, Pop-pop.

1393
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:12,864
Look at that.

1394
01:24:19,937 --> 01:24:21,101
Who's it from?

1395
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:23,204
Ooh. Who's Freddy?

1396
01:24:23,206 --> 01:24:25,172
Are you 12?

1397
01:24:25,174 --> 01:24:27,074
What does the note say?

1398
01:24:27,076 --> 01:24:29,944
It said,
"When life is rough..."

1399
01:24:29,946 --> 01:24:32,213
That's all I got to
before she slammed it shut.

1400
01:24:32,215 --> 01:24:34,515
All right, take it easy.
She's not gonna tell you.

1401
01:24:34,517 --> 01:24:35,917
You little cheat!

1402
01:24:35,919 --> 01:24:38,019
She'll tell me. Right?

1403
01:24:38,021 --> 01:24:39,554
- Yeah.
- Don't even try it.

1404
01:24:39,556 --> 01:24:40,921
- I'm not telling you.
- Come on.

1405
01:24:40,923 --> 01:24:42,556
- No.
- Jo, you always...

1406
01:24:42,558 --> 01:24:45,793
- I'm not telling anyone!
- You always tell your dad.

1407
01:24:45,795 --> 01:24:48,997
It's literally nothing.
There's nothing to tell!

1408
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:51,936
- It's seriously nothing.
- Leave her alone.

1409
01:24:53,136 --> 01:24:56,070
It's probably from that
professor she's been seeing.

1410
01:24:56,072 --> 01:24:57,605
- Oh.
- What?

1411
01:24:57,607 --> 01:24:59,573
- Professor?
- How old is this professor?

1412
01:24:59,575 --> 01:25:02,743
No, no, no, no.

1413
01:25:02,745 --> 01:25:06,915
We are not seeing each other.
He is a professor at Columbia

1414
01:25:06,917 --> 01:25:10,252
who is interested in my writing.
That's is all.

1415
01:25:10,254 --> 01:25:12,253
Jo, that's so exciting.

1416
01:25:12,255 --> 01:25:15,155
Is he also interested
in you?

1417
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:17,725
No. It's strictly professional.

1418
01:25:17,727 --> 01:25:21,195
- Then why would he send you a package on Christmas Eve?
- That's a good point.

1419
01:25:21,197 --> 01:25:23,532
Because it's Christmas,

1420
01:25:23,534 --> 01:25:25,600
and you give people presents
on Christmas.

1421
01:25:25,602 --> 01:25:27,801
He sent me a Christmas present!

1422
01:25:27,803 --> 01:25:31,605
Why is that so hard to understand?
Is that okay with everybody?

1423
01:25:31,607 --> 01:25:33,274
That's very okay.
That is totally fine.

1424
01:25:33,276 --> 01:25:35,543
Come on.
No, I don't think so.

1425
01:25:35,545 --> 01:25:39,146
You're children.
All of you.

1426
01:25:39,148 --> 01:25:41,882
Especially Dad.
All of you!

1427
01:25:41,884 --> 01:25:44,786
No. That's great that he likes your
writing. He's a very smart man.

1428
01:25:44,788 --> 01:25:48,023
I wouldn't say that he likes it.

1429
01:25:48,025 --> 01:25:52,060
Every time I send him a draft, he sends
me pages and pages and pages of notes.

1430
01:25:52,062 --> 01:25:56,634
But I guess no matter how many drafts
I send, he still reads them, so...

1431
01:25:57,968 --> 01:25:59,935
Well, then he definitely
has a crush on you.

1432
01:25:59,937 --> 01:26:02,770
All right.
All right, I'm done. Out!

1433
01:26:02,772 --> 01:26:06,875
Hey, Jo.
You get back in that seat.

1434
01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:10,882
- Move, move!
- Sit down. We're just teasing you.

1435
01:26:12,648 --> 01:26:13,881
We're just interested
in your life.

1436
01:26:13,883 --> 01:26:16,650
Then stop trying
to freak me out.

1437
01:26:16,652 --> 01:26:17,851
All right, Joe.

1438
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:19,988
Maybe you're just
overthinking this a bit.

1439
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:22,256
Not every guy
has alterior motives.

1440
01:26:22,258 --> 01:26:25,092
"Ulterior."
"Ul" with a "U." It...

1441
01:26:25,094 --> 01:26:27,761
- You know what I meant.
- If you're gonna make a point, use the right word.

1442
01:26:27,763 --> 01:26:30,534
Laurie always read your stuff.
He was always just a friend.

1443
01:26:33,736 --> 01:26:38,340
Yeah. Maybe he's just a normal guy who just
so happens to be into mythopoeic fables.

1444
01:26:38,342 --> 01:26:40,274
- Yeah.
- You know?

1445
01:26:40,276 --> 01:26:43,043
Yes.

1446
01:26:43,045 --> 01:26:47,616
A toast. To Jo's novel,
and its inevitable success.

1447
01:26:47,618 --> 01:26:49,184
- Cheers.
- Cheers to Jo.

1448
01:26:49,186 --> 01:26:51,286
Cheers.

1449
01:26:51,288 --> 01:26:56,157
And to Freddy. May his intentions be
pure and his heart not be broken.

1450
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,926
I am not cheersing to that.

1451
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:02,697
No! I am not... I am
not cheersing to that!

1452
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:05,100
I am not cheersing!
Stop! I'm not!

1453
01:27:05,102 --> 01:27:06,704
No!

1454
01:27:09,106 --> 01:27:10,404
Cheers.

1455
01:27:10,406 --> 01:27:12,075
That was a
good one, Marmee.

1456
01:28:13,402 --> 01:28:15,436
Amy, are you okay?

1457
01:28:15,438 --> 01:28:17,439
Yeah.
I'm such a klutz.

1458
01:28:17,441 --> 01:28:20,111
- Oh, my... You're bleeding.
- I know.

1459
01:28:29,486 --> 01:28:33,657
Jo! Come back!
Please just talk to me!

1460
01:28:34,725 --> 01:28:36,160
Let me explain.

1461
01:28:38,294 --> 01:28:42,796
He's been in London. So, of course
we've been seeing a lot of each other.

1462
01:28:42,798 --> 01:28:45,466
At first,
it was just as friends,

1463
01:28:45,468 --> 01:28:48,470
but then at some point,
it changed.

1464
01:28:48,472 --> 01:28:50,007
So, what?
You're dating now?

1465
01:28:51,074 --> 01:28:54,042
I know this must be
so weird for you.

1466
01:28:54,044 --> 01:28:56,147
At first it was weird
for me too...

1467
01:28:57,981 --> 01:28:59,850
but please
don't be mad at me.

1468
01:29:02,119 --> 01:29:03,254
Do you love him?

1469
01:29:04,187 --> 01:29:05,890
I think I always have.

1470
01:29:07,356 --> 01:29:08,892
And how does he feel?

1471
01:29:09,459 --> 01:29:11,792
The same.

1472
01:29:11,794 --> 01:29:14,065
At least that's what
he tells me.

1473
01:29:19,369 --> 01:29:22,237
Then, I'm happy for you.

1474
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:23,438
You are?

1475
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,076
Of course.

1476
01:29:30,213 --> 01:29:33,148
That stinkin' Laurie.

1477
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:37,818
He has been trying to weasel his way
into this family since day one.

1478
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:45,894
<i>♪ In Excelsis Deo ♪</i>

1479
01:29:45,896 --> 01:29:50,000
<i>♪ Gloria ♪</i>

1480
01:29:56,306 --> 01:30:03,114
<i>♪ In Excelsis Deo ♪</i>

1481
01:30:09,419 --> 01:30:11,286
Did you know?

1482
01:30:11,288 --> 01:30:13,320
No.

1483
01:30:13,322 --> 01:30:15,258
I think
everybody else did.

1484
01:30:19,562 --> 01:30:21,097
Wow.

1485
01:30:22,932 --> 01:30:25,902
I think they were nervous
about how you would react.

1486
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,909
Why did she
have to choose him?

1487
01:30:33,977 --> 01:30:36,180
I know he's amazing.

1488
01:30:38,315 --> 01:30:39,917
Why my Laurie?

1489
01:30:41,351 --> 01:30:43,585
You didn't want him.

1490
01:30:43,587 --> 01:30:46,924
Yeah, but I didn't want anyone
else to have him either.

1491
01:30:48,859 --> 01:30:50,361
Especially not Amy.

1492
01:30:51,928 --> 01:30:54,628
My baby sister
who has everything,

1493
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:58,067
whose life
I'm completely jealous of.

1494
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:04,174
We each have our own
paths to our castles.

1495
01:31:05,241 --> 01:31:07,908
Remember?

1496
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:09,946
There's no competition here.

1497
01:31:26,329 --> 01:31:28,098
You're my person.

1498
01:31:32,369 --> 01:31:33,971
Meg has Brooke.

1499
01:31:35,371 --> 01:31:37,040
Marmee has Dad.

1500
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:43,113
Apparently, Laurie has Amy.

1501
01:31:47,616 --> 01:31:49,119
I have you.

1502
01:31:51,521 --> 01:31:53,891
- Jo?
- Yeah?

1503
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:58,996
I wanna see the ocean.

1504
01:32:24,286 --> 01:32:28,025
The beach is so wonderfully
creepy in the winter.

1505
01:32:29,092 --> 01:32:32,426
It's the perfect setting
for a murder mystery.

1506
01:32:37,299 --> 01:32:39,369
Never stop doing
what you love.

1507
01:32:40,437 --> 01:32:42,039
Ever.

1508
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:45,075
You were meant
to tell stories.

1509
01:32:46,442 --> 01:32:48,376
Am I though?

1510
01:32:48,378 --> 01:32:49,380
Listen to me.

1511
01:32:52,048 --> 01:32:55,149
I'm not always gonna
be here to tell you.

1512
01:32:55,151 --> 01:32:56,987
Don't talk like that.

1513
01:32:58,487 --> 01:33:00,755
- Jo.
- Beth.

1514
01:33:00,757 --> 01:33:03,190
- I've known for a while now.
- Stop it.

1515
01:33:03,192 --> 01:33:05,428
- And I've come to terms with it.
- Don't...

1516
01:33:09,098 --> 01:33:11,067
I see you all so...

1517
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:15,505
healthy and strong...

1518
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:19,009
fighting for your dreams.

1519
01:33:24,146 --> 01:33:25,779
And I know I'm different.

1520
01:33:25,781 --> 01:33:28,485
No. You have to get better.
I...

1521
01:33:29,518 --> 01:33:31,385
You have to.

1522
01:33:31,387 --> 01:33:35,225
I try. Really I do.

1523
01:33:39,596 --> 01:33:43,000
Every day I just feel
myself slipping away.

1524
01:33:46,335 --> 01:33:47,370
I...

1525
01:33:49,638 --> 01:33:53,109
I don't think that I was ever
meant to be here for long.

1526
01:33:55,544 --> 01:33:58,548
And there's a reason why
I never wanted to move away.

1527
01:34:00,417 --> 01:34:04,254
Or to meet a boy or to
have a career or a family.

1528
01:34:08,458 --> 01:34:11,027
I just know that
I'm gonna miss you.

1529
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:15,566
Even on the other side.

1530
01:34:17,467 --> 01:34:21,135
I don't want to live
in a world without you.

1531
01:34:21,137 --> 01:34:22,505
Don't say that.

1532
01:34:25,107 --> 01:34:26,543
I'm counting on you.

1533
01:34:28,745 --> 01:34:31,382
You have to do
all the things for me.

1534
01:36:12,848 --> 01:36:18,685
<i>♪ World is crying ♪</i>

1535
01:36:18,687 --> 01:36:22,692
<i>♪ So I pretend ♪</i>

1536
01:36:24,494 --> 01:36:30,264

01:36:30,266 --> 01:36:34,504

<i>♪ Can't feel a thing

1540
01:36:47,549 --> 01:36:54,757
<i>♪ Can't feel a thing

1541
01:37:08,303 --> 01:37:09,703
Ah! Stop! Wait!

1542
01:37:14,444 --> 01:37:18,447
Don't mind me. Just managing
my anger over here.

1543
01:37:22,884 --> 01:37:24,752
Does it ever go away?

1544
01:37:24,754 --> 01:37:27,721
The anger? The pain?

1545
01:37:27,723 --> 01:37:29,359
The guilt?

1546
01:37:30,959 --> 01:37:33,327
Or the sadness?

1547
01:37:33,329 --> 01:37:35,595
When do I stop
feeling like this?

1548
01:37:35,597 --> 01:37:38,701
Bethy's life was harder than all
of ours, and she was the happiest.

1549
01:37:40,902 --> 01:37:46,774
You know how you always said that you
two were gonna do all the things?

1550
01:37:46,776 --> 01:37:49,479
You have to do this for her.
You have to feel...

1551
01:37:50,713 --> 01:37:51,912
all the feelings.

1552
01:37:51,914 --> 01:37:56,751
The only thing I feel
is emptiness.

1553
01:37:56,753 --> 01:37:58,185
Like nothing I do matters.

1554
01:37:58,187 --> 01:38:01,721
What is the point in even trying if
everything can be taken away from you?

1555
01:38:01,723 --> 01:38:06,027
Just stop. I am not gonna let you
turn into somebody that you are not.

1556
01:38:06,029 --> 01:38:11,899
The Jo that I raised is fearless,
is relentless, is passionate.

1557
01:38:11,901 --> 01:38:13,604
I used to be.

1558
01:38:15,471 --> 01:38:18,372
Then everything turned out
different than I expected.

1559
01:38:18,374 --> 01:38:20,507
You're a writer.

1560
01:38:20,509 --> 01:38:23,280
Don't you want your
story to be unexpected?

1561
01:38:32,054 --> 01:38:33,522
<i>Apollyon!</i>

1562
01:38:34,089 --> 01:38:35,525
<i>Apollyon!</i>

1563
01:38:36,726 --> 01:38:40,560
<i>I, Jo March, will
be a very successful writer.</i>

1564
01:38:40,562 --> 01:38:44,665
<i>And will do all the things.</i>

1565
01:38:44,667 --> 01:38:47,801
<i>You don't know what it's
like to have everyone else</i>

1566
01:38:47,803 --> 01:38:49,703
<i>make fun of your nose.</i>

1567
01:38:49,705 --> 01:38:53,440
<i>What if I die before
I get to do anything?</i>

1568
01:38:53,442 --> 01:38:56,010
<i>Jo, how could you?</i>

1569
01:38:56,012 --> 01:38:57,848
<i>Your one beauty?</i>

1570
01:38:59,581 --> 01:39:02,382
<i>Wing woman,
reporting for duty.</i>

1571
01:39:02,384 --> 01:39:06,420
<i>It's not
your castle, it's mine.</i>

1572
01:39:06,422 --> 01:39:12,926
<i>At this time, I wish to
propose a new member to the club.</i>

1573
01:39:12,928 --> 01:39:16,863
<i>I wanna write something that
won't be forgotten after I die.</i>

1574
01:39:16,865 --> 01:39:17,801
<i>You will.</i>

1575
01:39:18,834 --> 01:39:19,835
<i>I know it.</i>

1576
01:39:21,838 --> 01:39:25,506
<i>I don't think I'll ever be as good
at anything as you are at writing.</i>

1577
01:39:25,508 --> 01:39:29,313
<i>You're way better
at being a good human.</i>

1578
01:39:36,518 --> 01:39:39,854
- <i>I think this is my castle.</i>
- <i>The attic?</i>

1579
01:39:39,856 --> 01:39:42,359
<i>Just being
here with all of you.</i>

1580
01:39:45,794 --> 01:39:48,931
<i>We're growing up.
You have to deal with that.</i>

1581
01:39:56,172 --> 01:39:59,439
<i>To always help each other
reach our castles.</i>

1582
01:39:59,441 --> 01:40:01,544
<i>No matter where they may be.</i>

1583
01:40:58,734 --> 01:41:00,904
<i>There are
many Beths in the world.</i>

1584
01:41:02,204 --> 01:41:03,672
<i>Shy and quiet.</i>

1585
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,009
<i>Sitting in corners till needed.</i>

1586
01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:11,110
<i>And living for others
so cheerfully,</i>

1587
01:41:11,112 --> 01:41:13,581
<i>that no one sees the sacrifices</i>

1588
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:16,018
<i>till the little cricket
on the hearth stops chirping.</i>

1589
01:41:17,786 --> 01:41:22,592
<i>And the sweet,
sunshiny presence vanishes...</i>

1590
01:41:24,826 --> 01:41:28,798
<i>leaving silence
and shadow behind.</i>

1591
01:42:05,267 --> 01:42:07,835
You happy? Yeah.

1592
01:42:07,837 --> 01:42:10,170
Oh.

1593
01:42:10,172 --> 01:42:13,974
I have no idea what to do with them yet.

1594
01:42:13,976 --> 01:42:17,610
But I think once they
become actual humans,

1595
01:42:17,612 --> 01:42:19,145
I'm gonna be
their favorite aunt.

1596
01:42:19,147 --> 01:42:22,082
I'm sure you will be.

1597
01:42:22,084 --> 01:42:24,952
Could you get it?
It might be their playdate.

1598
01:42:24,954 --> 01:42:28,087
Playdate? They...
They hardly move.

1599
01:42:28,089 --> 01:42:30,060
Just get the door.
Come here.

1600
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:32,893
There we go.
Oh, hi.

1601
01:42:32,895 --> 01:42:36,296
Hi, there. Oh, my.

1602
01:42:36,298 --> 01:42:37,900
Who could be at the door?

1603
01:42:41,236 --> 01:42:42,538
Freddy.

1604
01:42:43,172 --> 01:42:45,072
What are you doing here?

1605
01:42:45,074 --> 01:42:46,843
I read your book.

1606
01:42:48,244 --> 01:42:50,743
A few times... actually.

1607
01:42:50,745 --> 01:42:55,783
Did you take a six-hour train
ride just to tell me that?

1608
01:42:55,785 --> 01:42:58,121
I needed to see something.

1609
01:43:05,794 --> 01:43:08,097
The famous March attic.

1610
01:43:09,965 --> 01:43:13,199
I can see why this was
a young tomboy's playground.

1611
01:43:13,201 --> 01:43:14,704
You really did read it.

1612
01:43:16,271 --> 01:43:17,673
Mm-hmm.

1613
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:36,125
Jo, I'm sorry.

1614
01:43:43,965 --> 01:43:46,169
I'm sorry for
how we left things.

1615
01:43:50,972 --> 01:43:52,074
Me too.

1616
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:58,244
I was not ready
to hear the truth.

1617
01:43:58,246 --> 01:44:00,950
But you were right.

1618
01:44:01,851 --> 01:44:03,954
You ready for
some more truth?

1619
01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:06,956
Let me guess.

1620
01:44:08,657 --> 01:44:12,161
It was childish,
cliché...

1621
01:44:14,163 --> 01:44:15,732
and my family is...

1622
01:44:17,032 --> 01:44:19,736
weird and boring.

1623
01:44:22,103 --> 01:44:23,804
The beginning was slow.

1624
01:44:23,806 --> 01:44:25,738
Your structure needs work,

1625
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:29,042
and you have a tendency
for run-on sentences.

1626
01:44:29,044 --> 01:44:31,213
But it's beautiful
and authentic.

1627
01:44:33,048 --> 01:44:34,149
And I loved it.

1628
01:44:36,951 --> 01:44:38,154
You did?

1629
01:44:39,355 --> 01:44:40,889
I might have
even cried.

1630
01:44:42,057 --> 01:44:43,158
Twice.

1631
01:44:45,761 --> 01:44:46,996
I think this is the one.

1632
01:44:49,298 --> 01:44:51,765
Come back
to New York with me.

1633
01:44:51,767 --> 01:44:54,301
I can help you
get this book out.

1634
01:44:54,303 --> 01:44:57,171
Beth wouldn't want you to stay here
and let your talents go to waste.

1635
01:44:57,173 --> 01:44:58,108
Come back with me.

1636
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,480
That was supposed to be
my part.

1637
01:45:07,482 --> 01:45:09,119
Get used to it.

1638
01:45:55,097 --> 01:46:00,434
Hey, munchkins. What have you got?
Show me.

1639
01:46:00,436 --> 01:46:03,173
Oh, it's so pretty.
Is this for Aunt Jo?

1640
01:46:03,905 --> 01:46:05,975
Thank you so much.

1641
01:46:23,124 --> 01:46:26,059
I cannot believe
I'm breaking my own oath.

1642
01:46:27,862 --> 01:46:29,298
You didn't break
the important ones.

1643
01:46:31,432 --> 01:46:34,835
I hate doing this
without her.

1644
01:46:34,837 --> 01:46:36,772
She's here.

1645
01:46:45,246 --> 01:46:46,883
I propose an oath.

1646
01:46:53,054 --> 01:46:55,758
An oath to surpass
all other oaths.

1647
01:47:06,168 --> 01:47:07,370
To always...

1648
01:47:09,204 --> 01:47:13,909
always...
try and be as good...

1649
01:47:15,977 --> 01:47:19,782
and sweet and strong...

1650
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:24,254
as our Beth.

1651
01:47:25,454 --> 01:47:26,987
Always and forever.

1652
01:47:26,989 --> 01:47:28,924
Always and forever.
