1
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:06,006
For the N$ew Jack City

2
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:14,282
You are about to witness
the strength of street knowledge.

3
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:16,923
Yo, this is Queen Latifah

4
00:00:17,172 --> 00:00:20,209
Bringing a song to you
About a place you might live

5
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:25,321
In case you don 't understand
It's called N$ew Jack City

6
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:28,442
In case you still don 't understand

7
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:31,326
I brought along Levert and Troop
To kick the ballistics

8
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:43,248
Unemployment is up,
says the Department of Labor...

9
00:00:43,532 --> 00:00:47,320
... with nearly 200,000 more claims
for unemployment last month.

10
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:51,969
Americans with income below the
poverty line has risen to 2 million...

11
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:54,806
...compared to 1. 6 million in 1979.

12
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:57,122
Economists say economic inequality...

13
00:00:57,372 --> 00:01:00,364
...is at its worst level since
the Great Depression.

14
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:05,928
The percentage of after-tax income
for the rich rose 3%...

15
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:09,010
... while after-tax income
for the poor fell .2%.

16
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:11,004
Homelessness is high.

17
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:14,722
A shooting in Harlem resulted
in the death of a 7-year-old boy.

18
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:17,167
Police say the shooting
was drug-related.

19
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,846
Said the police,
"The kid got in the way. "

20
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:24,529
The bodies of 3 young black men
were discovered in Marcus Garvey Park.

21
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:27,889
Police believe they were victims
of a drug deal gone bad.

22
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:31,807
Identity of the victims
has been withheld.

23
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:36,523
Firemen were summoned to extract a man
from a ventilator duct.

24
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:41,527
The man became trapped when he entered
the duct to rob the premises.

25
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:46,403
The deficit now stands
at an astounding $221 billion.

26
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:51,324
A reputed crime lord and ten of his
henchmen were gunned down today.

27
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,321
Witnesses said the gunmen
rode past Mr. Armeteo...

28
00:01:55,612 --> 00:01:57,728
...and sprayed the group with gunfire.

29
00:01:57,972 --> 00:02:01,328
The shooting was the result
of an ongoing turf war.

30
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:36,641
Biff. . .

31
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:38,081
. . .Iook at you now.

32
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,566
Nino, please!

33
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:41,006
Don't bitch up.

34
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,567
You don't have my product
or money.

35
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:47,447
You got to give me another chance!
Please!

36
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,011
Brothers don't wait to get paid.

37
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,641
Money talks.
Bullshit runs the marathon.

38
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:54,929
So see you,
and I wouldn't want to be you.

39
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:06,645
The number of addicted
infants born in Manhattan...

40
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:10,680
...has risen over the past few years.
Hospital officials say...

41
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:14,931
... that the care required by these
victims of the cocaine epidemic...

42
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:19,643
...has severely impacted the
available resources for pediatric care.

43
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:24,568
In other news, an unidentified man
found floating in the East River...

44
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:28,122
...is believed to be another victim
in an ongoing drug war...

45
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:31,011
... that continues to plague our city.

46
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:35,330
Get out of my shit!

47
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:44,128
Thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.

48
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:48,444
I like to pray before I scramble.
Keeps people honest.

49
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:50,569
Say that shit, say that shit.

50
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:52,928
Do this now. What's your price?

51
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:55,811
Yo, man. For you, Bob Marley, 1 7.

52
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:59,761
For a key? You must be
doing the dope. Bring this down.

53
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:01,445
Be realistic.

54
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:03,211
I want a lower price.

55
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:04,368
Down.

56
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:10,127
This ain't Delancey Street.
That's my price. Take it or leave it.

57
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:14,365
Check this out, homeboy.
God's on your side, right?

58
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:18,088
Why don't we do this reasonable?
1 4K, bam.

59
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,731
You want to do this
correct or not? 1 7.

60
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:23,405
Let me see the money.

61
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,290
Come on. Let's do this, man.

62
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:32,971
What you know about that?

63
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:11,443
Everybody out! Get down!

64
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,291
Everybody down! Police!

65
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:20,202
You think you slick, you little punk,
blasphemous, dope-fiend bitch!

66
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:22,687
Spit in my face, I'm going to kill you!

67
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:26,288
-You fucking that kid up.
-He's kicking his monkey ass.

68
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:28,648
Ease back, goddamn it! I'm a cop!

69
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:33,801
Shut the fuck up!

70
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:36,407
It's over. You have the right
to remain silent.

71
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:41,368
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

72
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,570
I'm going to get paid.

73
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:01,327
If I make this, you're going to have
to come out your pockets.

74
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,327
-Ain't made that shot in years.
-Pay your taxes.

75
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,847
I'm like the IRS.

76
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,124
That's it! I love it.

77
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:32,762
What's up? Where you going?

78
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,968
It's the sign of the times

79
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:38,050
I got to get mine
All I live is a life of crime

80
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,648
They got my back against the wall,
And my dick is in the dust

81
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,291
Remember when we was kids. . .

82
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:46,446
. . .we played for Reverend Oates
Moab Bitty Squad?

83
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:49,886
I was 1 1 , you was 1 3.
We was the baddest backcourt. . .

84
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:51,690
. . .and Each-One Teach-One.

85
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,210
We wasn't making no money then.

86
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:58,690
And now that we are, you're here
living your Michael Jordan fantasy.

87
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,411
Business must be good.

88
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:02,290
It will be, brother.

89
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:04,046
Peep this out.

90
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:09,011
Freebase. So what?

91
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:11,766
Yo, man, you know the rules.

92
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,523
Us brothers don't be getting high.

93
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,924
Shut the fuck up and drive the car,
you non-talking bastard.

94
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:21,367
You been making money
outside the family?

95
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:24,490
I just been doing a little
experimentation-type thing.

96
00:08:24,732 --> 00:08:27,405
A little experimentation-type thing.
Like what?

97
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:32,282
At the clubs, guys step away
from the blackjack table or the bar. . .

98
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:34,682
. . .to buy $50 or $1 00 worth of sniff.

99
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,492
I set them up with a hit
of the base.

100
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:41,566
Fifteen minutes after leaving,
they be back with 2 and 3 people.

101
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,006
So what?

102
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:48,362
They ain't come back for the cocaine.
They came back for the base.

103
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:53,365
You sound like
this shit'll change the world.

104
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:57,571
I don't know about all that
"change the world" shit, but I know. . .

105
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:01,327
. . .they be going crazy over this.
And the bitches. . . .

106
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:06,123
Oh, Lord! Them bitches!
They do anything for this, man!

107
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:10,367
I had my jimmy waxed every day
last week. You understand?

108
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:12,051
Several times a day.

109
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:14,290
Get the fuck out of here!

110
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:19,602
I know damn well ain't nobody
sucked your shriveled-up dick.

111
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,171
You trying to dis me?

112
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:24,489
I'm just telling the truth.
That's all I'm doing.

113
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:28,208
Several times a day, my ass.

114
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:33,010
All right, let me think about this
a little bit.

115
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,083
Money, you think this base. . .

116
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:38,765
. . .is the high-powered shit?

117
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:43,244
We going to come off like the Mob.
You understand what I'm saying?

118
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:56,527
Welcome to the Spotlite,
where we make the beat right. . .

119
00:09:56,772 --> 00:10:00,003
. . .and we can't fight.
So leave your drugs and go home.

120
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:01,971
DJ Clark Kent.

121
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:08,562
Rocking from turntable number one
to turntable number two.

122
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:10,245
Just like he want to do.

123
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:11,971
You going to frisk me too?

124
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:20,884
Yo, my boy, Nino in the house.
Yo, Nino. What's up?

125
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,444
You want a flower?

126
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:56,721
I think you'll like him.
Here he is.

127
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:58,920
What's up, crew?

128
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,963
Nino, your girl looks good.

129
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:05,723
You must like slumming, Kareem.

130
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,930
Why would a guy like you leave
a good computer job at the bank. . .

131
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:13,891
. . .come all the way uptown
by gypsy cab. . .

132
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,043
. . .to work among a den of thieves?

133
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,202
I'm no dummy.

134
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:19,568
It's basic common sense and arithmetic.

135
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,804
The difference between
them paying me $800 a week. . .

136
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:25,247
. . .and you paying me $8,000 a week.

137
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:27,289
I think my cousin also likes the fact. . .

138
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:30,251
. . .that you're in the tradition
of Joe Kennedy.

139
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:31,527
Who?

140
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:37,529
Good. Because you got to rob
to get rich in the Reagan era.

141
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:40,691
They running a strange program.

142
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:44,283
More poor and disenfranchised folks
than this place has ever seen.

143
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:46,688
They try to act like it don't exist.

144
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:49,969
-Meanwhile, the rich get richer--
-And the poor get nothing.

145
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:54,046
Times like these, people want
to get high. Real high and real fast.

146
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:55,691
And this is going to do it.

147
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,527
And make us rich.

148
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:04,763
I mean, what?
People going crazy over this?

149
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:07,845
It look like cracked-off
pieces of soap.

150
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,126
The Colombians and Dominicans
have shown us the way.

151
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:14,203
The shit is large.

152
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:16,403
But we'll do it differently.

153
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,608
No more selling on street corners.

154
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:21,685
Change the product,
you change the marketing strategy.

155
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:23,524
I've seen the future.

156
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,886
And its name is The Carter.

157
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:30,449
Hold up. The Carter Apartments,
that joint is big.

158
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:34,247
We're talking about
combinating and consolidating.

159
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:36,763
You're taking over The Carter?

160
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:41,244
We taking over The Carter. We going to
bum rush the whole damn thing.

161
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:45,890
Now just imagine,
if the tenants cooperate, it's lovely.

162
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,202
They become loyal customers.

163
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:53,168
If they don't, it's like Beirut.
They become live-in hostages.

164
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:56,888
We going to set up a lab here,
to make the product.

165
00:12:57,132 --> 00:13:01,648
You hook up the computer, watch the
workers, the money and the product.

166
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:04,088
The Duh Duh Man, Keisha,
we need security. . .

167
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:06,681
. . .to ward off the rival crews,
to screen out customers.

168
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,650
We also need lookouts. . .

169
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:11,321
. . .here, here and here.

170
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,171
Alert us of five-o.

171
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:18,568
One place to make the product.
One place to collect our money.

172
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,524
We will own this fucking city.

173
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:25,321
You's a genius, man. A pure, un--

174
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:31,484
Unadulterated. Would you please shut
the fuck up before you have a seizure?

175
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:34,008
Hey, man, suck my. . .

176
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:35,486
. . .dick!

177
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,523
It's a brilliant plan.

178
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:40,763
But one thing concerns me.

179
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:44,050
That curry-goat-eating, skinny-ass,
Fat Smitty.

180
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:47,882
He controls The Carter.
Time to sing that fat bitch a lullaby.

181
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,611
Rock-a-bye baby.

182
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:51,490
He'll be hanging with Elvis.

183
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:54,602
Damn.

184
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:57,087
Crack.

185
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:09,848
Sell my stuff
and stop talking to that bitch!

186
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:12,765
Let me speak with you.

187
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:16,730
Rastaman, I'm here to tell you
Nino Brown says. . .

188
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:20,203
. . .your services are no longer
needed in the community.

189
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:27,805
That's how you kill somebody.
Get up on the motherfucker and blam!

190
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:32,370
Blow his brains all over the sidewalk,
in broad daylight.

191
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:33,971
Rock-a-bye baby.

192
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:38,046
Brother, I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

193
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:42,565
Now look, you are going to give up
those apartments, huh?

194
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:46,003
And you are going to turn over
control of The Carter.

195
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:48,324
Because if you don't. . .

196
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:51,450
. . .this shotgun blows your big,
fat head off. . .

197
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,490
. . .before you can get
your clothes back on.

198
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:55,921
Is that clear?

199
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:02,650
Living

200
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,892
Living just enough

201
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:11,971
Living just for the city

202
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:15,086
Living, living, living just enough

203
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:20,848
And now we're living
Living

204
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,571
Just enough

205
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,484
For the city

206
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:34,047
For the N$ew Jack City

207
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:41,964
Do things, do things, do things,
Bad things with it

208
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:46,843
Do things, do things, do things,
Bad things with it

209
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,684
Almighty dollar

210
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:52,488
People don 't let money

211
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:56,281
Don 't let money change you

212
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:06,887
Don 't let money change it

213
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:11,803
For the love of money,
People will steal from their brother

214
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:15,647
For the love of money,
People will rob their own mother

215
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:19,769
Money, money

216
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:24,245
Just enough

217
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:27,006
For the city I live in

218
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,083
Living in a N$ew

219
00:16:58,292 --> 00:16:59,725
Jack

220
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:02,924
City

221
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:18,691
If you just say "no,"
what will you say "yes" to?

222
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:21,492
We say "yes" to education.

223
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:24,565
We say "yes" to dedication.
We climb up. . .

224
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:28,964
. . .to a higher station
of new spiritual motivation. . .

225
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:32,403
. . .to make a positive impact
on our nation.

226
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,930
Sergeant, I'm talking to you.

227
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:47,960
I want to know how drug pushers can
take over an apartment building. . .

228
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:49,440
. . .right under your noses.

229
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:53,691
If you lived in The Carter Apartments,
there'd be cops all over the place.

230
00:17:54,052 --> 00:17:56,771
Hey, don't walk away. Listen to me!

231
00:17:57,012 --> 00:18:01,085
I fought for this country. We pay taxes
and we're prisoners in our home.

232
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:06,410
I told the commissioner
you were running late.

233
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:09,526
-You got those files?
-Right here.

234
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:18,051
Let's hope he buys it.

235
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,848
Peretti and Appleton?
No way, Stone.

236
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:23,081
Who else you got?

237
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:25,084
-They're the ones I need.
-You kidding me?

238
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,761
Nick Peretti almost killed
his partner.

239
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,963
Scotty Appleton's on suspension.

240
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:31,082
Probation.

241
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:32,890
Semantics, Stone.

242
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,011
These two are trouble.

243
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:41,007
You and I know the system
wasn't ready for this epidemic.

244
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:43,686
Crack came on the scene
and spread like wildfire.

245
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,571
Now I got the mayor
and the governor on my back.

246
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:49,406
I need some results.
Fast!

247
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:51,449
You get me Nino Brown!

248
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:55,082
Forget Peretti and Appleton.
The risk is too high.

249
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,844
With all due respect, sir. . .

250
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,685
. . .you still don't get it.

251
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:04,129
You're not giving me what I need
to win this war:

252
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,169
Cops that know these streets.

253
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,880
I need new jack cops
for a new jack gangster.

254
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:12,801
What you call a risk,
I think is our only shot.

255
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:13,928
Let's go.

256
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:24,411
You got your men.

257
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:29,364
But I don't want any waves.

258
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:32,644
Not a goddamn ripple.

259
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,166
Who the hell is this
psychedelic, blotter-acid fool?

260
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,527
Be cool.

261
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:09,687
This is Detective Nick Peretti,
a motorcycle-freak, reject cop like you.

262
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:11,804
A wild man that no one wants.

263
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:14,043
He means I'm expendable.

264
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,921
Whatever, man. What did you
come here for? To watch me exercise?

265
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:20,925
I came here to lay a name on you.
Nino Brown?

266
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:22,730
His sidekick, Gerald "Gee Money" Wells?

267
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,647
-The "Cash Money Brothers. "
-Stuck up two-bit jewelry stores.

268
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:31,650
Yeah, thrill-seekers, wannabe
gangsters. I hate them. So what's up?

269
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:34,360
What's up is this:
We need some evidence.

270
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:36,802
Evidence of murder,
drug trafficking. . .

271
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:39,805
. . .racketeering, tax evasion.
Anything.

272
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:43,005
We've never been able
to make anything stick on Brown.

273
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,841
No shit. One-third of the department's
on Nino's payroll.

274
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:48,925
The other two-thirds don't care
unless it affects their community.

275
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:50,287
What you saying?

276
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:53,804
Listen.
I've been authorized to set up. . .

277
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,691
. . .an independent drug-fighting unit
and I'm picking you.

278
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:58,843
-Why me?
-What do you mean, why you?

279
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,765
You're from the neighborhood.
I can trust you.

280
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,963
And I know you give a shit.

281
00:21:04,812 --> 00:21:06,245
So what's the catch?

282
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:09,885
There's no catch.
Why you got to say that?

283
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:14,091
-Because I know your ass, Stone.
-Peretti goes with you.

284
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:16,448
This big, biscuit-head looking--

285
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:20,808
Listen! It won't be another
one of your wild-ass solo acts.

286
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:24,283
Peretti's the only cop I could find
crazy enough to team with you.

287
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:26,765
This is my shot.

288
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:29,526
And you fuck up, it's all on me.

289
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:36,209
I want to thank you because you know
I want to get back in this war.

290
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:38,649
But this guy, man. . . .

291
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,521
You in or out?

292
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:44,370
I'm in, all right?

293
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:54,128
What do you mean,
Frazier won't give up the apartments?

294
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:57,006
I'm not asking him, I'm telling him!

295
00:21:57,252 --> 00:21:59,971
I'll handle that fat bastard myself.

296
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:06,452
-We're honored.
-No, I'm honored. Really.

297
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:14,810
We understand you have
a new Peruvian connection.

298
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:17,645
So what of it?

299
00:22:17,932 --> 00:22:20,890
We know you're centralizing
operations at The Carter.

300
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:25,848
And you didn't notify Don Armeteo,
who takes such things as an insult.

301
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:29,608
Your point?

302
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:34,522
My point is you fucking guys are cutting
us out of our agreed upon 1 0%  .

303
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:37,890
It's time we renegotiate.

304
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:42,409
I tell you what, message boy.

305
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:45,527
You go back and tell Don Armeteo:

306
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:48,527
"No renegotiating. " Fuck that!

307
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:53,091
The Cash Money Brothers
are a self-contained unit now.

308
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:55,642
But you come see me next week.

309
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:59,771
And I'll hook you up with some
collard green linguinis and shit.

310
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:04,323
Chicken Alfredo. Chitlins Alfredo.

311
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:07,811
Maybe get a better suit!

312
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:09,531
Fuck you.

313
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,842
Nino, I don't know.

314
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:17,362
Frankie's an all-right guy.

315
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:20,285
Fuck them scungili -eating
motherfuckers.

316
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:24,923
This is ours. They don't want
to roll with it, we'll roll over them.

317
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:41,970
This moolanyan...

318
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:45,960
. . .must have an MX missile instead
of a cock, he gets up so high.

319
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,691
Our snitch was right.

320
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:54,803
Nino and his Cash Money monkeys. . .

321
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:58,362
. . .are dealing with the spicaroos
up on Broadway and 1 71 st.

322
00:23:58,612 --> 00:24:00,523
He don't even deny it.

323
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:03,167
Nor does he accept
our partnership no more.

324
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:05,682
Now, Gee Money, he was cool.

325
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:08,488
It was that testa dura, Nino.

326
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,005
You know what I say?

327
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:18,324
Lay down with Peruvian dogs,
you get Spanish fleas.

328
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,488
Soon Nino will itch.

329
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:23,890
We'll be there
to scratch the hell out of him.

330
00:24:30,372 --> 00:24:31,851
1 700 hours.

331
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:35,488
Suspects hand out consumables
and the natives are restless.

332
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,768
Yo, shut the fuck up, man!

333
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:40,563
Ten years as a low-life,
murderous bum.

334
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:45,084
Nino's purchasing a conscience.
I ain't buying this Robin Hood shit.

335
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:48,646
Oh, shit!
That's the kid I shot!

336
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:53,965
Why don't you lose weight? You look
like a boiled yam wearing a belt!

337
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:07,089
What's up? Glad to see
somebody cares about the needy.

338
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:09,129
Why don't you give me a turkey?

339
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:14,082
Look at your funky, black ass.
First you want to be a stickup kid.

340
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:16,881
But then you got shot.
Now you's a basehead.

341
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:19,088
You're messed up.
Your life is crap.

342
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:22,126
I know I look like stir-fried shit.

343
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:24,408
Hook me up with some food.

344
00:25:24,652 --> 00:25:26,210
There's a line. You got to wait.

345
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,484
Give him something to eat.

346
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:31,409
Hook me up.

347
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:32,642
This all I get?

348
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:34,640
You want more?

349
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:36,806
I'm a veteran.

350
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:39,889
Here. How's that, all right?

351
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:43,922
Clean yourself up,
maybe I'll give you a job.

352
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:45,088
All right, man.

353
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:46,651
Want to buy a turkey?

354
00:25:46,932 --> 00:25:48,411
I'm keeping an eye on him.

355
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:56,045
You don't deserve that turkey.
I hooked you up for that last get-high.

356
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:58,487
Why I got to be owing you?

357
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:02,044
I was prom queen of King High School.

358
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,010
This is beneath me.

359
00:26:06,372 --> 00:26:11,241
You used to be prom queen, now you're
the prom fiend. Look at you!

360
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:14,367
Hey what?!

361
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:17,042
Didn't I hook you up?

362
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:21,524
Didn't I get that pipe from the lranian
who tried to beat me out of $5?

363
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:26,922
Didn't I speak to your mother after
she called me a homeless bastard?

364
00:26:27,692 --> 00:26:28,681
Add all that up. . .

365
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:32,891
. . .and the fact that I can beat
your ass. I say it's my turkey!

366
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:34,770
Get away!
Get the fuck away!

367
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:40,965
Stop beating on her!
Stop it!

368
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:49,644
Let go of me, man.

369
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:54,523
Beat her up over a turkey.
You're a poor excuse for a brother.

370
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:58,890
Shit, man! Fuck! Shit!
It's a cop! It's a cop!

371
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:01,607
Shut up!

372
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,487
Shut up or I'll blow your brains out.

373
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:10,891
Don't hurt me.

374
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,282
-Shut up!
-I know I was wrong to beat that girl.

375
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,090
Crack has got me.

376
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:18,644
I got no control over it.
I tried to kick. . .

377
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:22,885
. . .but the shit be calling me.
It calling me. I got to go to it.

378
00:27:23,532 --> 00:27:25,523
-I need help, man.
-Come on, man.

379
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:33,409
-We got a crack monster.
-Your mother's a monster!

380
00:27:34,092 --> 00:27:35,525
-Hold him.
-What you writing?

381
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:39,082
"Pookie" Benny Robinson. Your name.

382
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:44,001
-I'm trying to help you.
-You ain't helping nobody!

383
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:46,129
-It's for your own good.
-Fuck you, man!

384
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:47,361
They'll hook you up.

385
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:48,601
I'm going to die!

386
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:53,240
They're going to help you.
They'll help you.

387
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:13,090
I had pretty much
everything I ever wanted.

388
00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:15,163
Everything I thought I wanted.

389
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:17,967
I always had a need for acceptance.

390
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:20,248
All my friends were doing it.

391
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,767
Thought I could quit anytime.

392
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:25,602
That's when I woke up in the hospital.

393
00:28:26,932 --> 00:28:28,570
It's a very simple program.

394
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:31,804
We only ask that you don't use
or drink, one day at a time.

395
00:28:32,052 --> 00:28:34,612
Don't leave before the miracle happens.

396
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:38,728
This program has revolving doors.

397
00:28:38,972 --> 00:28:42,806
But just because you go out,
don't mean you can come back in.

398
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:55,923
It's crazy, because. . .

399
00:28:56,892 --> 00:29:00,931
. . .I did everything. I whored.
I ripped my family off.

400
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,687
I was so scandalous,
I would even sell my baby's Pampers.

401
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:07,604
I have a crack baby.

402
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:09,883
He was born blind.

403
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:15,009
I know why he's blind.
Everybody knows why he's blind.

404
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:19,530
I kept telling myself I was
going to kick, but I never did.

405
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,531
I'm a junkie.

406
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:24,562
I'll be a junkie the rest of my life.

407
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:50,851
It's the first time
I've been away for so long. . .

408
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:54,368
. . .and personally, I hope I never see
you motherfuckers again.

409
00:29:55,132 --> 00:29:58,204
When I get out, I'll just take
everything one day at a time.

410
00:29:58,492 --> 00:29:59,891
One day at a time.

411
00:30:06,132 --> 00:30:10,205
Chill out. You been out two minutes
and already you want a job.

412
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:13,882
It's not just a job.
You saved my life.

413
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:18,284
Let me pay you back.
Let me help you bring Nino down.

414
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:21,484
He promised me a job.
I'll take his money. . .

415
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:22,687
. . .and report to you.

416
00:30:22,932 --> 00:30:24,126
I don't know.

417
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:27,969
You know what will happen
if I stay on the streets.

418
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:32,888
I need to be a part of something.
If you don't believe in me, who will?

419
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:41,682
Cool. You been inside,
checked out the operations.

420
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:45,729
All right, Pookie.
Parks, come help me out.

421
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:47,883
Tell me what goes on in this dump.

422
00:30:48,132 --> 00:30:51,647
It took me awhile,
but I've been through the whole joint.

423
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:55,248
First, you got to show
a membership card to this runner.

424
00:30:56,052 --> 00:30:57,405
It's like a video club.

425
00:30:57,692 --> 00:31:00,684
N$ino 's got it hooked up
like Mission: lmpossible.

426
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:04,324
Walking through that courtyard's
like a nightmare.

427
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,722
It's a nation full of zombies.

428
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:20,364
On the 2nd floor, a worker
rings a buzzer and a code.

429
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:23,485
A little panel on the wall opens up,
you get the crack.

430
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:25,723
The code, the buzzer, where that go?

431
00:31:25,972 --> 00:31:30,602
The call goes to "The Drug Store"
where they make the crack.

432
00:31:30,852 --> 00:31:35,607
I heard they got everybody in there
butt-naked. Titties hanging....

433
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,161
Nino don't trust a motherfucker.

434
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:46,647
Nino's one sick genius.

435
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:50,521
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
What happens at The Drug Store?

436
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:54,162
You can take your goodies home,
or stay at The Enterprise.

437
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:56,085
What's The Enterprise?

438
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,402
What am l, your ghetto tour guide?

439
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:01,325
They got all this equipment
and you don 't know shit.

440
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:05,571
When you're smoking crack, they say
you're "beaming up to Scotty. "

441
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:07,609
You're going to another world.

442
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,410
Crack is the "final frontier. "

443
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:12,371
That's why they call that room
"The Enterprise. "

444
00:32:13,412 --> 00:32:17,405
People sit down and light that
glass dick and take a hit.

445
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:23,327
It's scary. Their eyes look like
a rocket, getting ready to blast off.

446
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:25,688
Nino has most of the apartments?

447
00:32:25,932 --> 00:32:29,845
Man, are you deaf, or what?
The boy controls the whole place.

448
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:32,003
Nino Brown's a mad scientist.

449
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:36,370
Marvin said it. "The boy that made
slaves out of men. " That's Nino!

450
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:38,171
That's deep.

451
00:32:38,452 --> 00:32:43,367
Six, five, four, three,
two, one. . . .

452
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:46,128
Happy New Year!

453
00:32:48,572 --> 00:32:52,611
Welcome to the Spotlite
with the Flavor Flav.

454
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:54,922
Everybody say "Happy. . .

455
00:32:56,132 --> 00:32:57,770
. . .New Year! "

456
00:32:58,332 --> 00:33:03,087
This is the fruit of our hard work.
The belief in entrepreneurial spirit.

457
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:05,323
The new American dream.

458
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:06,847
A toast.

459
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:12,524
A toast to my family, in life. . .

460
00:33:13,372 --> 00:33:14,771
. . .until death.

461
00:33:15,012 --> 00:33:16,365
Happy New Year.

462
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:21,403
To CMB. On and on.

463
00:33:22,372 --> 00:33:25,170
-Am I my brother's keeper?
-Yes, I am!

464
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:27,243
Am I my brother's keeper?

465
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:30,362
Am I my brother's keeper?

466
00:33:33,172 --> 00:33:34,491
I am!

467
00:33:47,412 --> 00:33:48,481
Look at it.

468
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:52,770
A big reason for this success is you.

469
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:55,523
But this ain't about success.

470
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:57,729
This is about survival.

471
00:33:57,972 --> 00:34:02,648
We ain't going out like Puss Head,
shot up over a $1 0 bag. You know?

472
00:34:03,052 --> 00:34:04,644
You got to be smarter than that.

473
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:06,929
We got to look out for one another.

474
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:10,283
I feel the same way.

475
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:14,803
Nothing and no one
will come between you and me.

476
00:34:15,212 --> 00:34:16,281
Never.

477
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:17,601
Right?

478
00:34:18,212 --> 00:34:19,645
I love you.

479
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:21,611
I love you too.

480
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:24,964
Let's go get busy.

481
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:30,769
Frank Needles out here.

482
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:36,127
Let him in.

483
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:44,086
My ace boon coon!
How you doing?

484
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:46,329
Happy New Year.
What's a matter. . .

485
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:49,086
. . .too rich to toast the New Year
with an old friend?

486
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:52,762
If it isn't the thinking man's Rocky.
How are you doing?

487
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:54,240
Great. Love the hair.

488
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:58,724
The Don and l, we was thinking,
let's let bygones be bygones.

489
00:34:59,012 --> 00:35:03,005
We congratulate you on your new success.
To show our good faith. . .

490
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:04,726
. . .a gift from the Don.

491
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:10,048
Open it.

492
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:21,808
To the moolanyan in charge.

493
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:23,610
All the best, babe.

494
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:36,329
You motherfucking creep!
Think you'll get away with that?

495
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:38,127
I just did.

496
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:39,891
Step off, Gigantor!

497
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:48,643
Now get their silly, spaghetti-eating
asses out of my office.

498
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:53,924
Frank, come on. Let's go.
Let's get out of here!

499
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:14,642
It's total slamboyancy
in the Spotlite tonight.

500
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:19,283
You're about to get rocked by some cool,
mellow fellows from Brooklyn.

501
00:36:19,532 --> 00:36:24,208
I'm talking about Aaron, Damien,
Teddy, Slim, Guy.

502
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:25,880
Give it up.

503
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:34,728
Slim, give a little bit of bass.

504
00:36:43,212 --> 00:36:47,091
This is the sound
That get harder and get down

505
00:36:48,012 --> 00:36:50,128
Everyone must know

506
00:36:51,732 --> 00:36:55,850
We've been here before
And we're going to give you more

507
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:59,002
It's time to let it show

508
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,691
Music is funky

509
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:04,641
Girls are so fly

510
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:08,322
So sweet and fine

511
00:37:40,932 --> 00:37:43,571
Gee Money, come here,
come here, come here.

512
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:47,121
That the skeezer you met
at Frankie's?

513
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:48,964
Yeah, Uniqua.

514
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:52,729
What's up?
You fucking her correctly or what?

515
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:56,886
Once, but I just met her.
I need time to get to know her.

516
00:37:58,212 --> 00:37:59,531
I heard that.

517
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,050
Lord, have mercy.

518
00:38:08,972 --> 00:38:10,963
You want to play rough?

519
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:13,843
Say hello to my little friend.

520
00:38:23,372 --> 00:38:25,044
The world is mine.

521
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:27,726
And the brothers too, now.
Don't forget us.

522
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,361
The world is yours, Nino.

523
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:34,924
Only you won't be as careless
as Tony Montana, now will you?

524
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:36,844
You absolutely right.

525
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:38,889
I like this girl of yours.

526
00:38:39,172 --> 00:38:41,481
He ain't got no papers,
or a leash on me.

527
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:44,929
You know what happens
when dogs don't have a leash?

528
00:38:45,252 --> 00:38:47,891
They run the streets
and fuck everything in sight.

529
00:38:52,492 --> 00:38:55,802
It's true. I ain't got no papers
or no leash on her.

530
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:57,644
But nothing comes between us.

531
00:38:57,932 --> 00:38:59,888
The world is mine!

532
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,770
All mine!

533
00:39:02,612 --> 00:39:04,443
What the fuck are you doing up there?

534
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,731
A man like you, Nino,
needs to leave a legacy.

535
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:11,726
A son. A mark to let the world know
that he was here.

536
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:17,365
You know, you absolutely right.

537
00:39:17,652 --> 00:39:20,564
Shit. It ain't like I ain't
been trying. Ain't that right?

538
00:39:23,412 --> 00:39:24,481
She can't have kids.

539
00:39:25,492 --> 00:39:26,971
She can't fuck, either.

540
00:39:27,252 --> 00:39:29,368
Maybe that's why
she can't have kids.

541
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:32,172
That ain't right, man.
That ain't right.

542
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:35,527
-She can't?
-She can't.

543
00:39:37,012 --> 00:39:37,808
Too bad.

544
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:40,168
You're goddamn right that's too bad.

545
00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:59,166
Nino, you need to go get your girl.

546
00:40:02,572 --> 00:40:04,608
You're right. I tell you what.

547
00:40:09,012 --> 00:40:11,970
If I was you, I'd be looking
for the pimples on her booty.

548
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,728
Why the fuck did you have
to say that shit?

549
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:19,532
I told you before she couldn't
make no babies!

550
00:40:22,892 --> 00:40:24,325
I love you!

551
00:40:24,852 --> 00:40:27,764
And now you're taking me for granted.
How can you do that?

552
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:30,367
This is corny!
This is soap opera shit!

553
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:32,443
-You act like I owe you something.
-You do.

554
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:34,364
I don't owe you jack!

555
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:38,088
Okay, you did give me
a couple of books to read.

556
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:42,251
And you helped build the brothers.
But I was your ticket out of boredom.

557
00:40:42,612 --> 00:40:46,525
When your rich doctor daddy was
making house calls at Harlem General.

558
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:48,683
What's up with that? Right?

559
00:40:48,932 --> 00:40:53,608
When your kleptomaniac mother
was housing shit in Bloomingdales.

560
00:40:53,932 --> 00:40:55,763
Don't throw shit in my face--

561
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:58,321
You ever touch me again,
I'll--

562
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,527
Yeah, I'm aware of that situation.

563
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:32,569
Your man hired an ex-dealer.

564
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:37,044
I know it seems unconventional.
Appleton and Peretti report to me.

565
00:41:37,292 --> 00:41:39,044
-Is it out of control?
-No.

566
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:40,606
Don 't blow this.

567
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,685
-Does the commissioner know about it?
-N$ot yet.

568
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:44,842
Good.

569
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:53,282
I told you about
that new jack cop shit.

570
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:57,924
I give you a chance, and you hire
a crackhead. What's with you?

571
00:41:58,212 --> 00:42:00,282
Why don't you get off my dick?

572
00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:04,002
When you're ready to put yourself
on the frontline, let me know.

573
00:42:04,812 --> 00:42:06,962
Excuse me. Is this a black thing?

574
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:10,204
It is, so keep your
toy Mafia-butt out of it!

575
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:14,042
Fuck the Mafia! I'll wax
your high-yellow, narrow-ass butt!

576
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:16,567
Cool it!

577
00:42:16,812 --> 00:42:18,245
Relax, all right?

578
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:21,530
If you won't handle this,
send the white boy. . .

579
00:42:21,812 --> 00:42:23,928
. . .inside The Carter with
the National Guard.

580
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:29,810
What we need is a videotape
of this whole operation.

581
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:33,044
We need evidence of the
financial records to make it work.

582
00:42:34,372 --> 00:42:36,932
I'm the lookout there from
7 p.m. to 7 a.m. . . .

583
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:39,328
. . .in one of the apartment windows.

584
00:42:39,572 --> 00:42:42,564
I had to fill out an application.
Asked if I still got high.

585
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:44,484
They remember me from before.

586
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:48,441
I was one of their first customers.
I used to get fucked up.

587
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,091
Cracker barrel, cracker ass.

588
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,244
I got it, I got it.

589
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:03,929
This belt is really a video camera.

590
00:43:04,492 --> 00:43:07,484
These wire transmitters will be
taped to you.

591
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:09,962
It'll send your
communication to us. . .

592
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,248
. . .as well as sounds and images
around you.

593
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:14,722
It will also pick up
shit you can't even hear.

594
00:43:15,692 --> 00:43:18,206
You'll be great.
You're the best man for this job.

595
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:19,845
You're a fucking genius.

596
00:43:20,132 --> 00:43:21,201
Your mother.

597
00:43:22,212 --> 00:43:23,850
Pookie, we're counting on you.

598
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:26,921
You can help us bring down CMB.

599
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:29,442
Try this on.

600
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:32,167
You with it?

601
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:33,607
I'm with it, man.

602
00:43:35,052 --> 00:43:36,610
Let's roll with it.

603
00:43:36,852 --> 00:43:37,921
Put it on.

604
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,606
Pookie, come here, man.
Come here.

605
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,247
You know, I told Gee Money
how good you been.

606
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:04,805
How you've been bringing in
lots of customers.

607
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:07,370
And you're just a lookout.

608
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,924
Anything that makes them
more money, they like.

609
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:12,287
This might be it.

610
00:44:12,532 --> 00:44:14,011
We're promoting you.

611
00:44:14,372 --> 00:44:15,566
Check it out.

612
00:44:18,772 --> 00:44:20,410
Soon. Let's get going with it.

613
00:44:20,772 --> 00:44:22,000
Jackpot! System!

614
00:44:22,252 --> 00:44:24,004
He's inside! Yes!

615
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:27,001
This kid's been
bringing us business.

616
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:30,130
I'd like to take a shot
at one of those computer terminals.

617
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:33,648
-Can you program Pascal?
-Can a white man dance?

618
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:36,486
I guess not.
But people lose interest.

619
00:44:36,732 --> 00:44:39,849
Today's your lucky day, homeboy.
I'm promoting your ass.

620
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:42,806
You still on the pipe?

621
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:44,246
N$o way.

622
00:44:44,492 --> 00:44:45,481
Good. Real good.

623
00:44:45,732 --> 00:44:47,927
Because you'll be working
in The Drug Store.

624
00:44:48,172 --> 00:44:50,242
I'm glad you got confidence in me.

625
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:51,846
See you.

626
00:44:54,612 --> 00:44:56,887
-Keep an eye on that kid.
-Why? What's wrong?

627
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:59,566
He's light-fingered.
Keep an eye on the product.

628
00:45:02,372 --> 00:45:05,728
I don't think Pookie's ready
to be in a room full of crack.

629
00:45:05,972 --> 00:45:09,123
I'm ready. Don't I look ready now?
I was born ready.

630
00:45:09,412 --> 00:45:12,006
-Ready to be dead.
-Stay out of this.

631
00:45:15,332 --> 00:45:17,766
He's already on the inside.
With a little more time. . .

632
00:45:18,012 --> 00:45:21,243
. . .we'll have enough information
to put Nino away for good.

633
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:22,971
In my opinion, we get him out--

634
00:45:23,212 --> 00:45:25,043
I don't want your opinion.

635
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:28,320
I'm against it.

636
00:45:29,012 --> 00:45:31,367
-But it's your call.
-And your funeral.

637
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:41,083
We told them, man.

638
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:43,724
Ready? Shit.

639
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:48,087
You better be ready,
because you owe a lot of people.

640
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:50,766
You owe me. You owe yourself.

641
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:53,163
You owe the whole community.

642
00:45:53,412 --> 00:45:56,324
You even owe my mother.
Yeah, that's right.

643
00:45:56,612 --> 00:45:59,126
A junkie just like you
killed my mother in 1 974.

644
00:45:59,372 --> 00:46:02,011
Didn't take money or jewelry.

645
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,804
Just took her life.

646
00:46:05,092 --> 00:46:09,051
I don't know what you got left
in your so-called rehabilitated body.

647
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:12,728
But you better find something,
because you owe a lot of people.

648
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:15,486
A lot of people. You owe, Pook.

649
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:32,610
You got skim milk
in them titties?

650
00:47:36,012 --> 00:47:38,810
One and a-two and a-three
and a-four. . . .

651
00:47:39,052 --> 00:47:41,441
I'll give you something
to look at.

652
00:47:42,212 --> 00:47:46,000
Superfly, there's something wrong
with your boy.

653
00:47:46,852 --> 00:47:48,649
What's happening with Pookie?

654
00:47:50,372 --> 00:47:51,441
I have no idea.

655
00:47:51,692 --> 00:47:53,489
You should, he's your plant.

656
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:56,292
Cool out. You're jumping the gun.

657
00:47:56,652 --> 00:47:58,529
Something's wrong with your guy.

658
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:00,569
Fourscore seven years.

659
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:03,485
-Is that code for help?
-It's a black thing.

660
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:06,485
I'm tired of your stuff.
I'm tired of this dude.

661
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:07,721
What's wrong?

662
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:12,488
Just doing a workout. This is
a tough job. Got to stay in shape.

663
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,448
A workout boosts worker morale.

664
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:16,921
You think I'm stupid.

665
00:48:17,492 --> 00:48:19,164
You're a high motherfucker.

666
00:48:21,772 --> 00:48:22,568
You five-o?

667
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:24,768
-His cover's blown!
-Let's go!

668
00:48:25,932 --> 00:48:27,570
Are you five-o?!

669
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:32,009
Take him out and kill him!
And blow the building!

670
00:48:32,532 --> 00:48:34,170
Scotty help me! I'm going to die!

671
00:48:34,492 --> 00:48:35,368
Let's go!

672
00:48:55,972 --> 00:48:56,768
Let's go!

673
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,844
Let me through!
I'll do her!

674
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:42,367
Clear!

675
00:49:56,652 --> 00:49:58,131
Police! Get out!

676
00:49:58,572 --> 00:49:59,368
Come on!

677
00:50:09,812 --> 00:50:10,847
Shit!

678
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:13,766
Shit! Nothing here!

679
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:15,570
Let's get out of here!

680
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:27,881
Come here. Hold on.
Keep your head down.

681
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,202
Here we go!

682
00:50:40,652 --> 00:50:42,005
Scotty!

683
00:50:42,732 --> 00:50:44,245
Where the hell are you?

684
00:50:50,012 --> 00:50:52,845
-Shit!
-Touch Pookie, it blows.

685
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:54,764
-Do this.
-There's too many wires.

686
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:56,127
Pick one.

687
00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:57,966
Come on!

688
00:50:58,252 --> 00:51:00,322
I can't see.
Give me a light!

689
00:51:00,772 --> 00:51:01,727
Hold it there.

690
00:51:01,972 --> 00:51:03,325
Scotty, on three. . .

691
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:06,763
. . .I want you to slowly,
gently pull out the blue wire.

692
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:08,647
Slow!

693
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:11,448
One. . .

694
00:51:11,972 --> 00:51:13,041
. . .two. . .

695
00:51:13,252 --> 00:51:14,241
. . .three!

696
00:51:18,812 --> 00:51:20,689
-One is the ground.
-Which?

697
00:51:20,972 --> 00:51:22,530
-I don't know!
-Three seconds left!

698
00:52:08,852 --> 00:52:12,288
I knew it! You ain't nothing
but a high-priced whore.

699
00:52:12,812 --> 00:52:14,609
Put N$ino on, bitch.

700
00:52:15,172 --> 00:52:16,651
It's for you.

701
00:52:21,492 --> 00:52:22,845
What's up?

702
00:52:23,092 --> 00:52:26,243
I know you're having a good time,
but we were infiltrated.

703
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:29,571
We shut down The Carter.

704
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:32,165
Get your ass here now!

705
00:52:32,812 --> 00:52:33,961
N$ow!

706
00:52:39,812 --> 00:52:40,847
Stop!

707
00:52:53,612 --> 00:52:54,886
What happened?

708
00:52:58,412 --> 00:53:02,405
Don't nobody know nothing?
Don't everybody speak at once.

709
00:53:03,732 --> 00:53:05,609
How the motherfucker get in?

710
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:12,006
Out of all you motherfuckers,
nobody knows jack shit?

711
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:18,765
The Duh Duh Man.
Duh Duh, what happened?

712
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:26,364
I'll be a motherfucker.

713
00:53:26,732 --> 00:53:28,802
Don't nobody know nothing?

714
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:31,166
What up with this?

715
00:53:32,852 --> 00:53:35,491
Somebody got to know something
was going on.

716
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:36,960
See what I'm saying?

717
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:39,045
Ain't that right, Gee Money?

718
00:53:39,852 --> 00:53:42,366
I think Gee Money definitely
knows something.

719
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:44,445
Gee Money knows something.

720
00:53:47,012 --> 00:53:50,209
You fucked up.
You fucked up bigtime.

721
00:53:50,572 --> 00:53:52,802
You're incapable of running this shit.

722
00:53:53,252 --> 00:53:56,050
Sit your five-dollar ass down,
before I make change.

723
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,722
Kareem brought him to my attention.

724
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:01,805
We got 300 employees.

725
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:05,124
I can't keep my eye on all of them.

726
00:54:06,892 --> 00:54:08,484
If you was taking care
of business--

727
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,645
What? lf I was what?
Say it again!

728
00:54:11,892 --> 00:54:12,642
What?!

729
00:54:14,492 --> 00:54:15,288
Nothing.

730
00:54:15,532 --> 00:54:19,047
That's what I thought you said!
Because that's what I got, nothing!

731
00:54:19,252 --> 00:54:22,369
A million-dollar-a-week business
reduced to rubbish!

732
00:54:27,692 --> 00:54:28,886
It's your responsibility.

733
00:54:37,612 --> 00:54:40,684
I never liked you anyway,
pretty motherfucker.

734
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:55,322
What's the matter, Gee?
What's up with you?

735
00:54:56,012 --> 00:55:00,563
You're letting some shit like who
I'm laying the pipe to, fuck with you?

736
00:55:00,812 --> 00:55:02,404
You're bigger than that.

737
00:55:04,292 --> 00:55:07,807
Something like this
can never happen again.

738
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:31,561
Now. . .

739
00:55:34,212 --> 00:55:35,565
. . .Ieave me.

740
00:55:37,652 --> 00:55:39,529
Get the fuck out.

741
00:56:07,852 --> 00:56:10,047
What Gee Money has brought together. . .

742
00:56:10,572 --> 00:56:12,483
. . .Iet no man put asunder.

743
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:15,562
I now pronounce us man. . .

744
00:56:15,892 --> 00:56:17,120
. . .and wife.

745
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:20,811
You may kiss the bride.

746
00:56:27,172 --> 00:56:31,324
Be not deceived.
Neither fornicators, nor idolaters. . .

747
00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:35,042
. . .nor adulterers, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind. . .

748
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:37,647
. . .shall inherit the kingdom of God.

749
00:56:38,212 --> 00:56:40,521
May your soul rest in peace.

750
00:56:40,972 --> 00:56:42,246
Goodbye, Pookie.

751
00:56:52,612 --> 00:56:54,887
The commissioner's been on my ass.

752
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:59,842
Washington is blaming us for losing
thousands of dollars in man-hours.

753
00:57:00,652 --> 00:57:02,768
Not to mention all the cops
we got killed.

754
00:57:04,012 --> 00:57:05,968
The operation was a failure.

755
00:57:06,852 --> 00:57:08,968
We didn't arrest anyone.
No one, man.

756
00:57:09,812 --> 00:57:13,691
We didn't get any evidence. Nothing.
No financial records, nothing.

757
00:57:14,772 --> 00:57:17,923
We still could be out there
fighting scum like Nino Brown. . .

758
00:57:18,212 --> 00:57:19,884
. . .except for two things:

759
00:57:23,332 --> 00:57:27,211
I gambled on you,
and you gambled on a crackhead.

760
00:57:27,732 --> 00:57:28,721
Fuck that!

761
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,001
That's enough, man!

762
00:57:31,972 --> 00:57:35,885
I'm sorry you lost your budget.
But I lost a friend.

763
00:57:39,612 --> 00:57:40,442
Let it go.

764
00:57:41,092 --> 00:57:42,605
Operation's over.

765
00:57:47,052 --> 00:57:48,167
It's over.

766
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:54,602
It ain't over.
Pookie didn't die for nothing.

767
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,325
Operation 's gone...

768
00:57:59,812 --> 00:58:02,372
. . .Nino's loose, Pookie is dead.

769
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,409
I got Pookie killed.

770
00:58:04,652 --> 00:58:08,088
Cut out this self-pitying shit
about you killing Pookie.

771
00:58:08,332 --> 00:58:11,051
If anyone killed him, it was me.
I could see it.

772
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:14,091
How you going to tell me
you killed Pookie?

773
00:58:16,972 --> 00:58:19,202
Remember when you said
I didn't care?

774
00:58:21,572 --> 00:58:25,121
When what the hell was I doing
at Pookie's funeral anyway? Remember?

775
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:29,450
I used to be Pookie.

776
00:58:29,692 --> 00:58:32,160
How the hell you used to be Pookie?

777
00:58:32,412 --> 00:58:34,562
I was a poor white trash Pookie.

778
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:38,800
This whole drug shit, it's not
a black thing, it's not a white thing.

779
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:42,724
It's a death thing.
Death doesn't give a shit about color.

780
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:46,091
You don't have to like me.

781
00:58:46,772 --> 00:58:48,808
I don't even know if I like you.

782
00:58:52,132 --> 00:58:54,043
But we're in this together now.

783
00:58:54,412 --> 00:58:59,008
You know, a drug dealer
is the worst kind of brother.

784
00:58:59,972 --> 00:59:03,123
He won't sell it to his sister
or his mother.

785
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,641
But he'll sell it
to his boys in the street.

786
00:59:06,932 --> 00:59:08,524
I don't know about you. . .

787
00:59:09,932 --> 00:59:12,048
. . .but I'm ready to kill Nino Brown.

788
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:14,405
Are you with me?

789
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:17,611
I'm ahead of you.

790
00:59:31,172 --> 00:59:34,448
Behind door number one,
your head explodes like a melon.

791
00:59:34,652 --> 00:59:38,884
Behind two, you hook us up with
Gee Money and get the prize, Nino Brown.

792
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:41,884
Let's make a deal.

793
00:59:44,572 --> 00:59:49,123
You and me always had an understanding.
Besides, I needed a haircut.

794
00:59:53,252 --> 00:59:55,561
My cugino and his friend
are hungry.

795
00:59:56,572 --> 00:59:59,564
And I got a feeling
they'll cut you a sweeter deal. . .

796
00:59:59,852 --> 01:00:01,410
. . .than any Peruvian.

797
01:00:01,692 --> 01:00:04,126
Enough to maybe throw in
a finder's fee for me.

798
01:00:08,132 --> 01:00:09,531
If I swim with this--

799
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:14,163
You wanted to meet the main man.
From now on, you deal with me. . .

800
01:00:14,412 --> 01:00:15,731
. . .and me only.

801
01:00:30,772 --> 01:00:32,728
You will cut me a side deal.

802
01:00:33,132 --> 01:00:34,406
Twenty percent.

803
01:00:35,172 --> 01:00:37,481
And you will be obligated
to report to me. . .

804
01:00:37,892 --> 01:00:39,211
. . .and me only.

805
01:00:41,172 --> 01:00:42,048
Give me your number.

806
01:01:07,772 --> 01:01:08,921
Don Armeteo.

807
01:01:09,812 --> 01:01:11,689
Nino is about to itch.

808
01:01:14,612 --> 01:01:18,207
-What the fuck is up?
-What's up? Play ball, that's what.

809
01:01:19,172 --> 01:01:20,127
Check!

810
01:01:27,972 --> 01:01:29,041
Can I help you?

811
01:01:29,292 --> 01:01:30,725
I'm here to see Gee Money.

812
01:01:31,532 --> 01:01:33,409
-What's up with these elbows?
-Sucker!

813
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:34,960
I don't know you.

814
01:01:36,012 --> 01:01:37,047
You know him?

815
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:39,886
Hold up. I know him. He's cool.

816
01:01:40,852 --> 01:01:43,082
Ease back, playboy. Ease back.

817
01:01:43,852 --> 01:01:46,605
How you feeling, Gee Money, my man?

818
01:01:48,932 --> 01:01:50,729
What's up with your man?

819
01:01:52,812 --> 01:01:53,927
Pat him down.

820
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:55,967
Pat him down!

821
01:01:58,092 --> 01:01:59,571
It's like that?

822
01:02:01,412 --> 01:02:02,811
What the fuck is this?

823
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,122
I don't know you, that's what.

824
01:02:05,892 --> 01:02:09,680
I know you're my man's new contact,
but I don't trust you.

825
01:02:09,932 --> 01:02:12,651
So since you're interrupting my game,
get the fuck out.

826
01:02:18,252 --> 01:02:19,048
Mr. Money. . .

827
01:02:19,372 --> 01:02:22,682
. . .please escort Mr. Washington
off the court. Take him down the block.

828
01:02:22,932 --> 01:02:25,651
And if this dreadlocked
bomboraas even blinks wrong. . .

829
01:02:25,932 --> 01:02:27,650
. . .you lullaby his ass.

830
01:02:33,052 --> 01:02:36,044
Don't forget what we talked about
before at Frankie's.

831
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:38,442
I'm definitely going to be
the next king.

832
01:02:39,692 --> 01:02:42,206
Yo, Keish, I seen that boy
somewhere before.

833
01:02:47,332 --> 01:02:51,564
That's right, I checked him out myself.
He cooler than a fan.

834
01:02:51,972 --> 01:02:55,806
And the product is 60%  cheaper
than what the brothers is paying.

835
01:02:56,492 --> 01:02:59,450
That will free up
a whole lot of money...

836
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,603
... to do a lot of other things.

837
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:04,328
Like, maybe take over
another city project?

838
01:03:05,012 --> 01:03:06,923
All right, let's roll with it.

839
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:09,242
Rebuild and get stronger.

840
01:03:09,492 --> 01:03:11,483
Most definite. Most definite.

841
01:03:11,732 --> 01:03:13,370
Money, I'll tell you something.

842
01:03:13,812 --> 01:03:15,723
If he's not who he says he is. . .

843
01:03:16,012 --> 01:03:17,491
. . .I'll kill him.

844
01:03:18,572 --> 01:03:19,846
Then I'll kill you.

845
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:25,764
I don 't trust Mr. Washington.

846
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:29,009
I want him to stick to me
like flies to shit.

847
01:03:32,412 --> 01:03:35,643
When I was young, I was a member
of a gang, the L.A. Boys.

848
01:03:35,972 --> 01:03:38,008
-Lennox Ave.
-You know it.

849
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:41,324
The leader, Jughead,
told me to prove my loyalty. . .

850
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:43,881
. . .I had to snuff somebody out.

851
01:03:44,132 --> 01:03:45,724
It was like, "No problem. "

852
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:49,408
I said, "An enemy?"
He said, "No, that's too easy.

853
01:03:49,652 --> 01:03:51,882
It's got to be an ordinary mo. "

854
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:54,084
So I rode down to 23rd.

855
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:57,603
Copped me a bag of that
red devil angel dust.

856
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:04,169
I got so zooted.

857
01:04:05,932 --> 01:04:09,686
I walked up on this lady.
She must have been a schoolteacher.

858
01:04:10,052 --> 01:04:12,930
I was so fucking crazy,
I didn't even care.

859
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:15,844
I stepped to her.

860
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,328
I didn't even stay
to see her drop.

861
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:25,405
I just ran.

862
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:29,650
You must think I'm a demon.

863
01:04:32,132 --> 01:04:34,043
I guess what you was doing. . .

864
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:37,606
. . .it was like business, right?

865
01:04:38,772 --> 01:04:39,887
It wasn't personal.

866
01:04:40,852 --> 01:04:41,921
My brother. . .

867
01:04:43,052 --> 01:04:44,690
. . .it's always business.

868
01:04:45,492 --> 01:04:46,720
Never personal.

869
01:04:49,812 --> 01:04:52,963
-Tell your moms I want some bean pies.
-Can I get some?

870
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:55,083
Come on in, little man.

871
01:04:56,452 --> 01:04:57,441
Two for you.

872
01:04:58,932 --> 01:05:00,331
Two for you.

873
01:05:05,412 --> 01:05:06,606
Two for you.

874
01:05:09,252 --> 01:05:11,447
-Hold up, Pop.
-Get out of here now.

875
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:18,010
I can take care of you too.

876
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:21,562
Take care of yourself,
because you an ignorant bastard.

877
01:05:21,932 --> 01:05:25,607
You committing genocide on your people
with your fancy suits and cars.

878
01:05:26,012 --> 01:05:27,001
Step off, grandpa.

879
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:29,968
Idol worshiper!

880
01:05:30,252 --> 01:05:33,528
Killing your people with the
white devils you put in that bottle.

881
01:05:33,772 --> 01:05:35,490
You an idolater.

882
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,723
Reverend Oates,
why are you with this scum?

883
01:05:37,972 --> 01:05:38,722
Shut up!

884
01:05:39,012 --> 01:05:41,480
Nino, let me smoke this old dude.

885
01:05:48,572 --> 01:05:52,485
Look at you. In two years,
they'll be marking your gravesite.

886
01:05:53,292 --> 01:05:54,281
Me?

887
01:05:54,972 --> 01:05:56,451
I'll be right here.

888
01:05:58,212 --> 01:05:59,531
Kids, get out of here!

889
01:06:04,692 --> 01:06:05,920
These kids. . . .

890
01:06:07,372 --> 01:06:10,887
All these people gather around you
like you God almighty.

891
01:06:11,372 --> 01:06:12,771
Like you love them.

892
01:06:13,092 --> 01:06:15,970
Devils ain't got no love.
You're killing your people.

893
01:06:16,332 --> 01:06:19,847
What can you offer them?
Another l-have-a-dream speech?

894
01:06:20,132 --> 01:06:22,771
Some of that same shit
you ripping off to me?

895
01:06:23,252 --> 01:06:26,722
Look at us. Not a pot to piss in,
nor a window to throw it out of.

896
01:06:27,132 --> 01:06:28,406
You's the fool, old man.

897
01:06:32,532 --> 01:06:34,887
Don't try it.
Don't even think about it!

898
01:06:39,932 --> 01:06:41,411
You don't understand.

899
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:46,405
Idolater, you reap what you sow!

900
01:07:04,012 --> 01:07:05,730
This is some fly shit.

901
01:07:06,052 --> 01:07:09,647
Some George Raft,
some James Cagney-type shit.

902
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,120
You know what I'm saying?

903
01:07:11,372 --> 01:07:13,806
-That's how you living.
-Living large!

904
01:07:20,012 --> 01:07:22,685
Good looking out this afternoon.

905
01:07:23,012 --> 01:07:25,128
Gee Money should've seen it coming.

906
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:29,881
Old man really wanted to do me.

907
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,121
Old bastard.

908
01:07:34,572 --> 01:07:37,086
But here's something
that's not so funny.

909
01:07:37,612 --> 01:07:40,285
Gee Money tried to cut
a side deal with me.

910
01:07:45,932 --> 01:07:48,287
You can't trust anybody these days.

911
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:52,010
You can trust me.
I got your back.

912
01:07:56,132 --> 01:07:57,087
Thank you.

913
01:07:57,772 --> 01:08:01,242
Now Reverend Oates will say
a few words to the happy couple.

914
01:08:07,572 --> 01:08:10,882
You got to wait till somebody else
gets some too, okay?

915
01:08:14,372 --> 01:08:17,250
Before we eat this cake,
we ought to toast. . .

916
01:08:17,812 --> 01:08:21,122
. . .my daughter, my new son-in-law
and our gracious host. . .

917
01:08:21,412 --> 01:08:22,765
. . .Mr. Nino Brown.

918
01:08:39,732 --> 01:08:40,721
Shit!

919
01:08:42,172 --> 01:08:43,491
Fuck!

920
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:49,288
Good dog.

921
01:08:56,572 --> 01:08:57,971
Oh, baby.

922
01:08:58,492 --> 01:08:59,527
Come on.

923
01:09:43,052 --> 01:09:44,690
I got something for you.

924
01:09:45,652 --> 01:09:47,882
That's my business card.
Call me sometime.

925
01:10:28,052 --> 01:10:30,486
What's up?
You still mad at me?

926
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:32,046
Fuck you, then.

927
01:10:32,852 --> 01:10:36,527
-Where is the Duh Duh Man?
-Probably after that skeezer.

928
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,406
What's with Selina?

929
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:40,927
I don't know. Losing her mind.

930
01:10:41,172 --> 01:10:43,640
Think I care?
This is my world, my money. . .

931
01:10:43,892 --> 01:10:45,484
. . .and that's my skeezer.

932
01:10:46,252 --> 01:10:48,482
You'll get it all over your dress.

933
01:10:50,772 --> 01:10:51,887
Hi, Daddy.

934
01:10:58,772 --> 01:11:00,490
Hold up a minute.

935
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:04,045
Thank you, mister.

936
01:11:12,212 --> 01:11:13,167
Cover me!

937
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:33,327
Throw me a gun!

938
01:11:34,692 --> 01:11:35,807
Get down!

939
01:11:47,892 --> 01:11:49,086
Motherfuckers!

940
01:12:26,252 --> 01:12:28,322
You're a murderer, Nino!

941
01:12:29,092 --> 01:12:31,890
I've seen you kill too many people!

942
01:12:34,252 --> 01:12:35,731
Cancel that bitch.

943
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:37,645
I'll buy another one.

944
01:12:40,692 --> 01:12:42,045
I hate you!

945
01:12:42,652 --> 01:12:44,483
I hate you, Nino!

946
01:12:47,372 --> 01:12:49,886
Don Armeteo's on the phone for you.

947
01:12:52,492 --> 01:12:55,290
We made you. We gave you everything.

948
01:12:55,532 --> 01:12:59,684
Shagazzy's, the Spotlite,
the street corners.

949
01:13:01,292 --> 01:13:04,443
So you got cute.
You had to get spanked.

950
01:13:04,692 --> 01:13:07,160
Now you listen to me.
I made this. Me.

951
01:13:07,492 --> 01:13:09,960
I own this city, you slicked-back,
greasy-haired. . .

952
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:11,128
...son of a bitch!

953
01:13:11,412 --> 01:13:12,811
You're fucked!

954
01:13:50,892 --> 01:13:52,325
This bulletin just in.

955
01:13:52,652 --> 01:13:56,042
In a scene to rival the famed
St. Valentine's Day Massacre...

956
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:57,930
...of 1920s Chicago...

957
01:13:58,212 --> 01:14:02,171
...Don Armeteo, reputed crime lord,
and ten of his henchmen...

958
01:14:02,412 --> 01:14:04,607
... were gunned down this afternoon....

959
01:14:04,852 --> 01:14:07,605
I put you two together.
You guys go off on your own.

960
01:14:07,812 --> 01:14:09,245
Now you come back to me?

961
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:11,767
You're telling me
the disk isn't important?

962
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:14,890
I'm telling you
I hope it is important.

963
01:14:15,732 --> 01:14:16,528
This is Hawkins.

964
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:20,322
We go back to law school.
She's the prosecuting attorney.

965
01:14:20,532 --> 01:14:23,365
The son of a bitch used a little girl
as a bulletproof vest.

966
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,331
Watch your language.
Nino is going to fall.

967
01:14:26,572 --> 01:14:29,769
-What about the Pookie video?
-It helps, but it's not enough.

968
01:14:30,092 --> 01:14:32,322
Nino isn't in the tapes
at The Carter.

969
01:14:32,572 --> 01:14:34,164
He's Mr. Untouchable.

970
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:39,489
How many more got to die?
I could have smoked him myself.

971
01:14:39,852 --> 01:14:43,208
Can we catch him in a buy?
Or get a witness to testify. . .

972
01:14:43,452 --> 01:14:45,044
. . .and connect all the dots?

973
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:49,922
Nino's got great connections.
Can we nail any and tie them to Nino?

974
01:14:50,572 --> 01:14:51,971
Check this out.

975
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:55,609
We got it set up so the
CMB brothers will buy from us.

976
01:14:56,332 --> 01:14:59,642
And I also got it so Nino Brown
definitely doesn't trust Gee Money.

977
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:01,723
And we'll get it on videotape.

978
01:15:23,572 --> 01:15:24,925
What's up, fellas?

979
01:15:25,492 --> 01:15:26,686
Got the bucks?

980
01:15:26,932 --> 01:15:29,492
Nice of you to make it.
Know what I'm saying?

981
01:15:29,972 --> 01:15:31,007
What can I say?

982
01:15:32,012 --> 01:15:33,525
What's taking so long?

983
01:15:34,052 --> 01:15:35,644
Nino's not moving.
Shit.

984
01:15:35,892 --> 01:15:38,247
-Let's do this.
-Open the briefcase.

985
01:15:42,732 --> 01:15:43,926
Easy!

986
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:45,447
Very easy.

987
01:15:45,772 --> 01:15:47,046
I thought we was friends.

988
01:15:47,332 --> 01:15:49,846
I told you, it's never personal, B.

989
01:15:50,092 --> 01:15:52,731
Friends is friends. This is business.

990
01:15:53,012 --> 01:15:54,161
Let's see the sample.

991
01:15:54,412 --> 01:15:55,481
Whatever.

992
01:16:02,612 --> 01:16:03,761
All here, baby.

993
01:16:04,292 --> 01:16:06,647
I knew I knew Washington.
He's five-o!

994
01:16:08,852 --> 01:16:10,331
Suck-ass motherfucker!

995
01:16:13,012 --> 01:16:14,764
Punch it! Just do it!

996
01:19:29,092 --> 01:19:31,208
You cut a deal
with that motherfucker.

997
01:19:32,532 --> 01:19:35,046
Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Gee.

998
01:19:36,532 --> 01:19:37,851
Fucking Cain.

999
01:19:38,972 --> 01:19:40,644
My brother's keeper.

1000
01:19:41,772 --> 01:19:43,205
Was it this. . .

1001
01:19:44,052 --> 01:19:46,441
. . .glass dick you've been sucking on?

1002
01:19:48,612 --> 01:19:52,685
Was that it? Now I see how you
let that motherfucker infiltrate.

1003
01:19:53,012 --> 01:19:54,730
He used you, Gee.

1004
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:06,802
Whatever happened to
"Am I my brother's keeper?"

1005
01:20:07,972 --> 01:20:09,883
You know what happened to it.

1006
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:14,203
"The world is mine. "

1007
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:17,722
Remember that?

1008
01:20:19,772 --> 01:20:23,082
"Everything is mine. Everything! "

1009
01:20:24,332 --> 01:20:25,765
Even my woman.

1010
01:20:26,772 --> 01:20:28,524
Is that what this is about?

1011
01:20:28,852 --> 01:20:30,171
That fucking skeezer?

1012
01:20:30,412 --> 01:20:32,004
You think I give a fuck about her?

1013
01:20:32,252 --> 01:20:34,720
Fuck that ho bitch!
I don't give a fuck about her!

1014
01:20:35,052 --> 01:20:36,963
It ain't about her.

1015
01:20:38,572 --> 01:20:39,971
It's about us.

1016
01:20:43,852 --> 01:20:45,251
I love you, man.

1017
01:20:52,652 --> 01:20:54,722
You embarrassed me, man!

1018
01:20:57,732 --> 01:21:00,690
In front of all them people,
you treated me like I was soft.

1019
01:21:00,932 --> 01:21:03,162
You treated me like I was spineless!

1020
01:21:04,332 --> 01:21:08,041
We built this shit!
You didn't do this shit by yourself!

1021
01:21:09,292 --> 01:21:12,523
You forgot about me, man.
Your brother.

1022
01:21:13,892 --> 01:21:15,564
What has this done to us?

1023
01:21:19,572 --> 01:21:20,687
Keisha.

1024
01:21:21,092 --> 01:21:22,241
Dead.

1025
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,611
The Duh Duh Man.

1026
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:26,208
Dead.

1027
01:21:28,532 --> 01:21:30,523
Let's just make it like it was.

1028
01:21:31,812 --> 01:21:34,610
Let's be a family.
Let's make it like it was.

1029
01:21:34,852 --> 01:21:38,242
Fuck them cars. And them bitches.
And all that shit.

1030
01:21:38,572 --> 01:21:40,483
Fuck that shit!

1031
01:21:41,892 --> 01:21:44,725
Let's do us, me and you.
Let's be a family again.

1032
01:21:56,172 --> 01:21:57,890
I'm on the run.

1033
01:21:59,852 --> 01:22:02,286
It can never go back
the way it was.

1034
01:22:05,572 --> 01:22:09,611
But I'll tell you how
we can make it right.

1035
01:22:20,332 --> 01:22:21,606
CMB.

1036
01:22:22,412 --> 01:22:23,731
CMB!

1037
01:22:24,132 --> 01:22:25,565
We all we got.

1038
01:22:28,492 --> 01:22:30,847
Am I my brother's keeper?

1039
01:22:39,012 --> 01:22:40,684
Yes, I am.

1040
01:22:50,892 --> 01:22:52,848
You know where Nino Brown lives?

1041
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:55,567
You heard my man.
I ain't telling you shit!

1042
01:22:56,012 --> 01:22:58,970
Last summer, we won
this basketball tournament.

1043
01:22:59,212 --> 01:23:02,648
Bought the whole team new red scooters.
So kiss my ass.

1044
01:23:02,892 --> 01:23:03,881
Kiss my ass with that.

1045
01:23:04,132 --> 01:23:08,011
You know something, B?
This dude is a cop. Five-o! B, out!

1046
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:09,522
Come here, punk!

1047
01:23:11,972 --> 01:23:13,610
I know where Nino lives.

1048
01:23:13,892 --> 01:23:16,531
He beat this kid with
a baseball bat.

1049
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:18,888
Poured gas on him,
set him on fire. . .

1050
01:23:19,332 --> 01:23:21,562
. . .after he shorted him $5.

1051
01:23:21,812 --> 01:23:24,326
I hope you kill his black,
hardened ass.

1052
01:23:25,132 --> 01:23:26,804
He's in apartment 6C.

1053
01:23:27,172 --> 01:23:29,811
But watch out.
He got bodyguards on the roof.

1054
01:23:33,932 --> 01:23:36,321
Say hello to my little friend.

1055
01:23:43,572 --> 01:23:44,800
Buckwheat.

1056
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:44,768
Punk!

1057
01:24:47,012 --> 01:24:47,762
Kill him!

1058
01:24:48,012 --> 01:24:52,085
How can you wear this and sell poison
to our people? You ain't shit!

1059
01:24:56,812 --> 01:24:57,722
Toss him to me.

1060
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:06,522
That teacher you killed?
That was my mother!

1061
01:25:09,412 --> 01:25:11,323
Kick his black ass!

1062
01:25:14,132 --> 01:25:17,488
You've squashed and killed
these people with no retribution.

1063
01:25:18,772 --> 01:25:19,966
Get your ass up.

1064
01:25:26,812 --> 01:25:28,962
This ain't business.
This is personal.

1065
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:34,125
Do it! Do it!

1066
01:25:34,332 --> 01:25:37,165
I want to shoot you so bad,
my dick's hard.

1067
01:25:37,452 --> 01:25:38,771
Coming through!

1068
01:25:40,532 --> 01:25:43,126
Come on, Scotty.
We'll do it the right way.

1069
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:45,761
I'll testify.

1070
01:25:46,012 --> 01:25:48,321
Even if it means my life,
I will testify.

1071
01:25:48,572 --> 01:25:50,927
Come on.
We can't go out like this.

1072
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:52,486
Put the gun down.

1073
01:26:00,732 --> 01:26:03,121
Don't throw your life away
on a piece of shit.

1074
01:26:07,492 --> 01:26:09,244
Give me the gun.
I'll do it!

1075
01:26:20,052 --> 01:26:21,690
I'll be out in a week.

1076
01:26:22,932 --> 01:26:24,570
You're a dead man.

1077
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:36,203
Was the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown,
head of the CMB?

1078
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,801
Remove the hat and the sunglasses.

1079
01:26:53,052 --> 01:26:56,601
Detective Appleton, when you
infiltrated the CMB. . .

1080
01:26:56,852 --> 01:26:59,161
. . .did the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown. . .

1081
01:26:59,412 --> 01:27:04,088
. . .attempt to buy two and a half kilos
of cocaine from you?

1082
01:27:04,732 --> 01:27:06,848
Can Michael Jordan slam dunk?

1083
01:27:07,172 --> 01:27:09,527
Of course he did.
He's a dope dealer.

1084
01:27:09,772 --> 01:27:12,081
That's what they do,
buy and sell dope.

1085
01:27:13,612 --> 01:27:14,840
I'm not guilty.

1086
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:16,964
You're the one who's guilty.

1087
01:27:17,772 --> 01:27:21,048
Lawmakers, the politicians,
the Colombian drug lords.

1088
01:27:21,292 --> 01:27:24,045
All you who lobby against
making drugs legal.

1089
01:27:24,492 --> 01:27:27,131
Just like with alcohol
during Prohibition.

1090
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:29,090
You're the one who's guilty.

1091
01:27:30,372 --> 01:27:32,806
Let's kick the ballistics here.

1092
01:27:33,092 --> 01:27:35,526
Ain't no Uzis made in Harlem.

1093
01:27:35,852 --> 01:27:39,686
Not one of us in here
owns a poppy field.

1094
01:27:39,972 --> 01:27:42,884
This thing is bigger than Nino Brown.
This is big business.

1095
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:45,083
This is the American way.

1096
01:27:46,252 --> 01:27:49,688
I'm sure that the court
was enlightened. . .

1097
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:52,162
. . .by your geopolitical tirade.

1098
01:27:52,492 --> 01:27:56,246
Unfortunately, society at large
is not on trial here.

1099
01:27:56,532 --> 01:27:58,887
You are, Mr. Brown.

1100
01:27:59,572 --> 01:28:01,290
Were you or were you not. . .

1101
01:28:01,612 --> 01:28:06,163
. . .head of the narcotics consortium,
the murderously bloody. . .

1102
01:28:06,412 --> 01:28:07,845
. . .CMB?

1103
01:28:10,092 --> 01:28:12,970
I could not hear you.
Would you please speak up?

1104
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:15,322
Yes, I was a member.

1105
01:28:15,852 --> 01:28:18,491
But I was forced into
this way of life.

1106
01:28:18,692 --> 01:28:21,286
I've been dealing drugs
since I was 1 2.

1107
01:28:21,612 --> 01:28:25,241
I didn't have the chances
that you have, Miss Hawkins.

1108
01:28:25,492 --> 01:28:29,929
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
in my mouth, Miss Hawkins.

1109
01:28:32,012 --> 01:28:35,925
I wanted to get out,
but they threatened to kill my mother.

1110
01:28:36,172 --> 01:28:39,403
Who are you talking about,
Mr. Brown? What "they"?

1111
01:28:40,172 --> 01:28:41,127
They.

1112
01:28:42,212 --> 01:28:44,772
Look at him. Kareem Akbar.

1113
01:28:46,132 --> 01:28:49,920
The educated brother from the bank.
He's the head of the CMB.

1114
01:28:50,172 --> 01:28:51,605
The brains behind the whole thing.

1115
01:28:51,892 --> 01:28:54,804
This is bigger than Nino Brown,
and I got a list to prove it.

1116
01:28:55,052 --> 01:28:57,930
If I'm going down, I'm taking
a lot of people with me.

1117
01:28:58,372 --> 01:29:01,284
-Order in the court!
-Can I speak with my lawyer?

1118
01:29:19,692 --> 01:29:22,604
Your Honor, may counsel
approach the bench?

1119
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:27,086
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

1120
01:29:30,772 --> 01:29:32,171
What's the discussion?

1121
01:29:39,012 --> 01:29:41,401
The court is not pleased
with this application.

1122
01:29:41,812 --> 01:29:45,202
You understand that by pleading
guilty to a lesser charge. . .

1123
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:50,447
. . .the court, under law, can impose
a sentence of three years to life. . .

1124
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:54,731
. . .with parole eligibility
after 1 2 months. Do you understand?

1125
01:29:57,132 --> 01:29:58,326
Absolutely.

1126
01:29:59,732 --> 01:30:01,324
How'd you let this happen?

1127
01:30:01,572 --> 01:30:05,326
We wanted some of the crack
off the streets. I wanted Nino too.

1128
01:30:05,572 --> 01:30:09,281
He gave up his connections,
and Powell wanted to make the deal.

1129
01:30:10,412 --> 01:30:11,288
Let's go.

1130
01:30:13,412 --> 01:30:15,323
This court is now adjourned.

1131
01:30:16,332 --> 01:30:19,324
What? All he gets is a year?

1132
01:30:19,612 --> 01:30:20,931
This ain't happening.

1133
01:30:22,252 --> 01:30:24,766
I should have
killed you myself, bitch!

1134
01:30:25,812 --> 01:30:28,007
That's the difference between
you and me.

1135
01:30:28,332 --> 01:30:31,210
Don't get mad, Tito. It's the law.

1136
01:30:32,292 --> 01:30:33,088
Sucks, huh?

1137
01:30:35,772 --> 01:30:39,162
When this is over with,
you can come and work for me.

1138
01:30:44,292 --> 01:30:46,203
Did you turn state's evidence?

1139
01:30:46,532 --> 01:30:48,090
Did you sell out CMB?

1140
01:30:48,332 --> 01:30:50,482
-Are you pleased with the outcome?
-Absolutely.

1141
01:30:50,692 --> 01:30:55,004
The justice system is the greatest.
I'm proud to be an American.

1142
01:30:55,252 --> 01:30:57,288
-Hi, Mom.
-Idolater!

1143
01:30:57,532 --> 01:31:00,490
Your soul is required in hell!
