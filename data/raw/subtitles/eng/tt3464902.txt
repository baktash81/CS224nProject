1
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,540
I'm really sorry.

2
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,639
Does he wear glasses or contact lenses?

3
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,319
Glasses.

4
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,039
You'll have to hurry up.

5
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,639
He decided that his brown leather
shoes were the best pair to wear.

6
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,380
His back hurt a little
but not like some other times in the past

7
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,399
when the pain was intolerable.

8
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,159
He was thinking his wife
didn't love him at all any more.

9
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,780
He didn't burst into tears and he didn't think
that the first thing people most people do

10
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,159
when they realise someone
doesn't love them anymore is cry.

11
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,700
Sir, do you mind taking a look
into the camera here for me?

12
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,639
That'll do. Thank you.

13
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,500
Have you ever been on your own before?

14
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,580
No, never.

15
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,140
Are you allergic to any foods?

16
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,460
No.

17
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,900
Your last relationship
lasted how many years?

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,660
Around 12.

19
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,820
Do you remember how long exactly, sir?

20
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,780
11 years and one month.

21
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,319
- Sexual preference?
- Women.

22
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,100
However, I had one homosexual
experience in the past,

23
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,799
in college.

24
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,420
Is there a bisexual option available?

25
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,780
No, sir, this option is no longer available
since about last summer,

26
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,860
due to several operational problems.

27
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,980
I'm afraid you have to decide right now
if you want to be registered

28
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,999
as a homosexual or a heterosexual.

29
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,199
I think I should be registered
as a heterosexual.

30
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,180
- Any children, sir?
- No.

31
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,580
And the dog?

32
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,460
My brother. He was here a couple of years
ago but he didn't make it.

33
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,380
You might remember him:

34
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,180
medium build, 48 years old,
bald patch, blond hair.

35
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,399
I'm afraid not, sir.

36
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,340
OK, I would like you to write your name
clearly on this form in capital letters.

37
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,359
And sign it, please.

38
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,439
That will do. Thank you very much.

39
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,420
OK, so you are not allowed to use
the volleyball or tennis courts.

40
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,380
These are only for the couples.

41
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,460
You can use facilities for individual
sports, such as squash and golf.

42
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,980
You can stay at the hotel for up to 45 days.
You'll be staying in a single room.

43
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,359
If everything goes well and you make it,
you'll be moved to a double room.

44
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,279
I'm afraid you cannot keep
any of your personal belongings.

45
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,420
We will provide everything you need.

46
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,959
As far as garments, accessories
and shoes are concerned.

47
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
- You can keep this.
- Thank you.

48
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,660
Shoe size, please?

49
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,420
Forty-four and a half.

50
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,159
Forty-four of forty-five?
There are no half sizes.

51
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,079
Forty-five.

52
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,940
If you need a haircut,
call reception one day ahead.

53
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,620
Smoking is not allowed.

54
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,260
That way you'll be able to run for longer
during the hunt without getting tired

55
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,460
and your breath won't smell when you kiss.

56
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,479
Enjoy your stay.

57
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,220
Excuse me, if we need to get a haircut,

58
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,860
we must call the reception the day before,
is that right?

59
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,639
- That's right.
- Great.

60
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,679
His room number was 101.

61
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,799
A tranquiliser gun was hanging
on the wall above his bed.

62
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,559
On the table were 20 tranquiliser darts,
a black plastic watch,

63
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,239
a pair of sunglasses
and a cologne for men.

64
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,599
Inside the wardrobe
were four identical grey trousers,

65
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,399
four identical button-down shirts
in white and blue,

66
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,100
a belt, socks, underwear, a blazer,

67
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,279
a striped tie and a white bathrobe.

68
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,079
He looked out the window.

69
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,159
The unconscious bodies of the captured
loners were lying on the wet ground.

70
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,679
"Thank God they wear those
waterproof ponchos," he thought.

71
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,279
Room 195.

72
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,159
Two loners, two extra days.

73
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,679
Room 272.

74
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,559
One loner, one extra day.

75
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,860
Hello. I'm the hotel manager
and this gentleman is my partner.

76
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,780
We'd like to welcome you.

77
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,060
You're one of the lucky ones.

78
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,220
You have one of our superior rooms,
which means you have a view.

79
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,380
- Did you read the leaflet?
- Yes, I did.

80
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,060
Very good. Now the fact
that you'll turn into an animal

81
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,900
if you fail to fall in love with someone
during your stay here

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,639
is not something that should upset you,
or get you down.

83
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,900
Just think as an animal you'll have
a second chance to find a companion.

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,860
But even then, you must be careful.

85
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,519
You need to choose a companion
that is a similar type of animal to you.

86
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,940
A wolf and a penguin
could never live together,

87
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,980
nor could a camel and a hippopotamus.

88
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,940
That would be absurd.

89
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,599
Think about it.

90
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,740
I understand this discussion
is a little unpleasant for you.

91
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,300
But it is my duty to prepare you
psychologically,

92
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,039
for all possible outcomes.

93
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,300
Now, have you thought of what animal
you'd like to be if you end up alone?

94
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,479
- Yes, a lobster.
- Why a lobster?

95
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,439
Because lobsters live for over 100 years,

96
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,599
are blue-blooded like aristocrats

97
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,839
and stay fertile all their lives.

98
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,599
I also like the sea very much.

99
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,279
I water-ski and swim quite well,
since I was a teenager.

100
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,820
I must congratulate you. The first thing
most people think of is a dog,

101
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,860
which is why the world is full of dogs.

102
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,300
Very few people choose an unusual
animal, which is why they are endangered.

103
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,260
A lobster is an excellent choice.

104
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,279
Could you stand for us, please?

105
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,740
This is to show you how easy life is
when there are two of something

106
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,260
rather than just one.

107
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,119
We tend to forget that from time to time.

108
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,540
The handcuff will be removed
at the same time tomorrow.

109
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,540
- It's alright, Bob.
- I hope you enjoy your stay with us.

110
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,999
Goodbye.

111
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,079
Have a good day.

112
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,060
Good morning.

113
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,039
Room 101.

114
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,700
44 days left.

115
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,719
Breakfast is served.

116
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,319
Sit where you like.

117
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,799
His first day was one he'd never forget.

118
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,119
Near his table at breakfast sat
a young woman with her head tilted back.

119
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,399
Later on he would learn
that she often got nosebleeds.

120
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,399
Next to her sat her best friend.

121
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,900
He thanked the waiter
who served him his coffee,

122
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,119
and thought about his wife for a moment.

123
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,140
A woman who seemed to like butter biscuits

124
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,999
offered one to a man drinking
a Campari and soda for breakfast.

125
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,039
He then looked behind him and saw a woman

126
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,719
who he would later find out
was absolutely heartless.

127
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,860
And some others in the couples area,

128
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,639
whom he'd never meet
during his stay at the hotel.

129
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,479
That morning, he was really hungry.

130
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,679
He could have eaten a whole chicken
but ate almost nothing.

131
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,799
- Hello.
- Hello.

132
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,100
I've decided to go for a walk outside
with my new friend.

133
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,140
Let me introduce you. This is Robert.

134
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,719
He stays in the room next to mine
and has a lisp.

135
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,919
Pleased to meet you.
I'm staying in room 101.

136
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,820
I'm on the same floor. I'm 186.

137
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,919
- Would you like to join us?
- Why not?

138
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,420
One of these days, it's gonna be me
on one of those yachts.

139
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,380
What are those yachts?

140
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,759
It's the final ordeal before
letting you go and the hardest one.

141
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,060
15 days of vacation, just a couple, alone.

142
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,479
- Didn't you read the leaflet?
- I did.

143
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,220
Have you seen John's leg?

144
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,700
No.

145
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,959
John, would you show your leg?

146
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,519
Oh, yeah.

147
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,039
Room 187, day two.

148
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,399
Hello, everyone.

149
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,500
My mother was left on her own
when my father fell in love with a woman

150
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,519
who was better at math than she was.

151
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,239
She had a postgraduate degree, I think,
whereas my mother was only a graduate.

152
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,119
I was 19 at the time.

153
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,300
My mother entered the hotel but didn't
make it and was turned into a wolf.

154
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,319
I really missed her.

155
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,380
I found out she'd been moved to a zoo.

156
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,399
I often went there to see her.

157
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,140
I'd give her raw meat.

158
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,940
I knew that wolves liked raw meat,

159
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,620
but I couldn't figure out
which of the wolves was my mother,

160
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,079
so I used to give a little bit
to each of them.

161
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,919
One day, I decided to enter the enclosure

162
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,639
I really missed her and I wanted a hug.

163
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,759
I climbed the fence and jumped in.

164
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,220
All the wolves charged at once
and attacked me,

165
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,239
all but two, who stood motionless.

166
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,439
My guess is that one of those two
must have been my mother.

167
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,319
The zoo guards got to me quite quickly
and took me to the hospital.

168
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,060
Thankfully, I didn't lose my leg,
I just have this limp,

169
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,479
which is also my defining characteristic.

170
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,319
My wife died six days ago.

171
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,159
She was very beautiful
and I loved her very much.

172
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,199
She had a limp too.

173
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,119
Thank you, John.
You can return to your seat now.

174
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,020
Let's move on to our next guest.

175
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,039
Room 104, day two.

176
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,359
Hello, everyone.

177
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,620
This is only my second day here,

178
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,759
but already I feel like a member
of a wonderful group.

179
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,559
My defining characteristic
is that I have a very beautiful smile.

180
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,158
<i>Something's gotten hold of my heart</i>

181
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,119
<i>Keeping my soul and my senses apart</i>

182
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,940
<i>Something has gotten into my life</i>

183
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,940
Have you ever danced with anybody?

184
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,380
Sorry?

185
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,340
Have you ever danced with anybody?

186
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,119
Yes.

187
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,279
What sort of dancing did you do?

188
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,319
Just depends on the music.

189
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,100
Do you need to sit down?

190
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,580
- No, no, no, I'm getting ready to dance.
- Ah.

191
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,500
<i>In a time there was peace
with no trouble at all</i>

192
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,460
Can I sit here?

193
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,380
<i>But then you came my way</i>

194
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,740
Sorry.

195
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,559
<i>And a feeling inside shook my heart</i>

196
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,839
<i>Made me want you to stay</i>

197
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,820
<i>All of my life</i>

198
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,199
- Can I sit here?
- Of course.

199
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,839
Let me introduce you to my best friend.

200
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,260
That woman you were talking to
has no feelings whatsoever.

201
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,900
She feels nothing at all.

202
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,079
She's the best hunter in the hotel,
silent and very fast.

203
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,199
She's the women's record holder,
192 captives.

204
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,079
<i>Changing the grey, changing the blue</i>

205
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,999
<i>Scarlet for me, scarlet for you</i>

206
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,759
Would you like to dance?

207
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,439
<i>Every day</i>

208
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,958
<i>You touch me and my mind goes astray</i>

209
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,079
<i>And baby</i>

210
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,860
<i>And baby</i>

211
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,719
<i>Something's gotten hold of my hand</i>

212
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,839
<i>Dragging my soul to a beautiful land</i>

213
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,959
<i>Something's gotten into my life</i>

214
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,260
I'm sorry, I've got blood on your shirt.

215
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,980
But don't worry, there are many ways to
remove bloodstains from clothing.

216
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,140
One way is to rinse the clothes
with cold water then rub with sea salt.

217
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,420
Another way is to scrub the stains
with cotton wool dipped in ammonia.

218
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,540
The third way is to mix flour and water
into a paste, like toothpaste,

219
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,420
especially if the clothes are delicate
or brightly coloured.

220
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,879
But just never use warm water
on blood, ever.

221
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,199
OK.

222
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,860
<i>But then you, you, you
You</i>

223
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,860
<i>You came my way</i>

224
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,020
<i>But then you came my way</i>

225
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,700
<i>And a feeling I know shook my heart</i>

226
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,300
<i>Made me want you to stay</i>

227
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,100
<i>All of my nights and all of my days</i>

228
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,140
I think I have to rest for a little bit.
My leg's hurting.

229
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,620
That's OK.

230
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,620
Well, let me know when
you feel better and we can dance again.

231
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,359
<i>And my senses apart</i>

232
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,420
<i>Something has invaded my night</i>

233
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,220
<i>Painting my sleep with a colour so bright</i>

234
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,180
<i>Changing the grey</i>

235
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,199
<i>Changing the blue</i>

236
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,679
<i>Scarlet for me</i>

237
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,300
<i>Scarlet for you</i>

238
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,660
Leave the building in an orderly fashion.

239
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,620
Do hurry up but please be careful.

240
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,919
Nobody needs to get hurt or injured.

241
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,279
And good luck with the hunt.

242
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,759
I wish I didn't have this limp.

243
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,860
I used to be very good at running
but not any more.

244
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,100
I'm sure I'll be slower than them.

245
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,340
If I were you, I'd think of some tricks
that use the element of surprise

246
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,119
instead of speed.

247
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,980
You're right.

248
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,719
That's what I'll do.

249
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,199
Room 186. One loner, one extra day.

250
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,599
38 days' stay left, plus one, 39.

251
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,679
Room 180.

252
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,639
The days of your stay remain unchanged.

253
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,319
Room 290.

254
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,439
Four loners, four extra days.

255
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,279
154 days left, plus four, 158.

256
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,980
Room 101.

257
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,198
The days of your stay remain unchanged.

258
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,679
32 days left.

259
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,239
Breakfast is served.

260
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,479
Man eats alone.

261
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,540
How many darts did you use yesterday?

262
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,919
12.

263
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,359
Please take off your trousers
and sit on the bed.

264
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,679
Can we not do this today? It's awful.

265
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,439
I know. But I'm afraid we have to do it.

266
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,420
And you have no idea how much
it helps you psychologically

267
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,140
in your search for a partner.

268
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,239
Man eats with woman.

269
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,039
Lie down.

270
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,319
Spread your legs. More.

271
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,319
- Is your room number 186?
- Yes, it is.

272
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,740
I imagine you know that
masturbation is not permitted

273
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,100
in the rooms
or any other area of the hotel.

274
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,540
Yes.

275
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,359
And yet it has brought to my attention
that you continue to do it.

276
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,740
Today you became erect quicker
than on other days. That's good.

277
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,700
Please, just a little longer.

278
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,660
Have a good day.

279
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,900
That's awful. Just awful.

280
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,580
Were you looking at a photograph
while you were masturbating?

281
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,799
Yes.

282
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,279
What did the photograph show?

283
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,599
A naked woman on a horse in the country.

284
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,060
If I were in your shoes, I would not be
ogling the naked woman but the horse.

285
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,900
I'm sure that the horse was once
a weak and cowardly man just like you.

286
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,919
Woman walks alone.

287
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,399
Help.

288
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,839
Help.

289
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,820
Help.

290
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,839
This is not necessary. Please.

291
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,820
- It was an accident. I got carried away.
- Please.

292
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,620
- This is not necessary.
- Please place your hand in the toaster.

293
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,119
This could be a warning.

294
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,359
Look, I've been good otherwise, I...

295
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,759
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please.

296
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,420
Please, please, that's hurting.

297
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,439
Woman walks with man.

298
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,420
What they do,
as soon as you enter the room,

299
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,060
is to wash your body
and your head really well.

300
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,940
How do you know?

301
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,340
My uncle used to know a waiter
who worked there.

302
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,380
No waiters know about the procedure,

303
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,460
they're not allowed inside that room.

304
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,879
Nevertheless, they peel off the skin,

305
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,100
which has become soft
due to the water and the soap.

306
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,780
Afterwards, they remove the heart,
the eyes and other vital organs of the body

307
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,639
with a laser or scalpels.

308
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,620
Then the procedure changes
according to the animal one has chosen.

309
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,580
That makes total sense.

310
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,980
I mean, I suppose
mammals demand a different kind of work

311
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,700
than fowls, for example.

312
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,140
Exactly.

313
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,340
Afterwards they throw
the remaining body parts

314
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,540
into the casks outside
the hotel's restaurant

315
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,540
and distribute the blood
to the hospitals in the city.

316
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,100
Why is that?

317
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,919
The blood is used for surgeries
where there are no blood donors available.

318
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,020
- New guests arrived yesterday.
- Yes, I saw.

319
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,740
I think I saw a woman with a limp.

320
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,759
It's just a sprained ankle.

321
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,860
She'll be walking normally again
in a few days.

322
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,919
That's a shame.

323
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,180
That is a shame indeed.

324
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,599
One night on the coach, he sat next
to the woman who liked butter biscuits.

325
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,020
He gazed out of the window,
not looking at anything in particular,

326
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
just trying to avoid talking to her.

327
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,439
- How's Bob?
- He's fine.

328
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,559
I'd give anything to go for a walk
with you and Bob one afternoon.

329
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,980
The dog's not allowed out of the room,
I'm afraid.

330
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,460
"There are some excuses
that no one can argue with," he thought.

331
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,900
Some excuses are without doubt
better than others.

332
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,919
And that was a really good one.

333
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,940
These biscuits are for Bob.

334
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,180
I want you to give them to him

335
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,260
whenever you want to reward him
for something.

336
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,420
- Tell him they're from me.
- Thank you.

337
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,839
Can I come to your room sometime
for a chat?

338
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,919
I could give you a blow-job
or you could just fuck me.

339
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,020
I always swallow after fellatio and I've
got absolutely no problem with anal sex

340
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,380
if that's your thing.

341
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,820
My ex-husband always used to say I had
the most beautiful thighs he'd ever seen.

342
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,580
But let's not talk about him.

343
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,679
My room number is 180,
so my telephone extension's 180.

344
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,140
Hope I can catch some loners tonight.

345
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,399
I haven't caught any the last few nights.

346
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,060
Hope you catch lots too.

347
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,079
Thank you very much.

348
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,020
If I don't find a suitable partner soon,

349
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,559
I'm gonna kill myself by throwing
myself out of one of the rooms.

350
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,679
Out of the window.

351
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,340
I want you to know that.

352
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,300
My room is on the first floor.

353
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,439
"I hope I catch some
loners today," she said.

354
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,460
"And I hope you catch lots too."

355
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,020
She then told him that if she didn't find
a suitable partner soon,

356
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,959
she was going to kill herself
by jumping from one of the room windows,

357
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,220
320, maybe, or one higher up.

358
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,319
480, that would be even better.

359
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,519
When she stopped talking, he stared at her
blankly, not knowing what to say.

360
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,580
He then looked out at the woods

361
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,239
and thought once more
how good his excuse had been.

362
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,199
Not bad. Bit higher.

363
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,159
Have you thought about what animals
you wanna be if you don't make it?

364
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,399
A lobster.

365
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,319
I'm gonna be a parrot if I don't make it.

366
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,260
Why don't you become parrots too?

367
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,820
And then we'll all be together.

368
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,660
You're a complete idiot,

369
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,460
picking one of the few animals
that can talk

370
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,940
when you have a speech impediment.

371
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,540
You'll lisp, even as an animal.

372
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,500
As for you, they'll catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die.

373
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,380
And then they'll crack open your claws
with a tool, like pliers,

374
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,540
and they'll suck out what little flesh
you have with their mouths.

375
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,559
You're pathetic, both of you.

376
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,940
I'm not gonna be turned into some animal.

377
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,660
I'll come and visit you, though,
with my partner,

378
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,620
when we're walking together in some park
or when we're swimming in the sea.

379
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,639
Or when we're on one of our trips.

380
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,020
Friends.

381
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,959
I'm not afraid.

382
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,239
Room 187, please.

383
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,599
It's no coincidence that the targets are
shaped like single people and not couples.

384
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,559
Hello.

385
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,020
- Hello.
- Your swimsuit is very nice.

386
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,559
Thank,

387
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,559
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

388
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,660
Do you like to swim breaststroke,
front crawl, butterfly or backstroke?

389
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,220
I like all strokes equally.

390
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,180
You know, I love breaststroke.

391
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,300
No, really.
My friends often tease me and say,

392
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,340
"Stop swimming breaststroke all the time."

393
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,300
And then they laugh.

394
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,799
Breaststroke is great.
It's excellent exercise for the back.

395
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,039
When swimming breaststroke,
men shouldn't wear swim shorts,

396
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,620
as it really limits movement
in the buttocks.

397
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,860
- But you knew that, didn't you?
- I think your nose is bleeding.

398
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,479
Really?

399
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,199
Ah, no.

400
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,319
This happens to me all the time.

401
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,999
It's really, really annoying.

402
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,799
I know. I have a nosebleed problem too.

403
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,359
I saw what you did. It must have hurt.

404
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,799
Is it coming out?

405
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,519
No.

406
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,340
- Yes.
- Can I use a tissue?

407
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,879
Yes.

408
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,039
I'm gonna ask you a question
and I want you to answer me honestly.

409
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,700
What's worse:
to die of cold and hunger in the woods,

410
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,060
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal

411
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,999
or to have a nosebleed from time to time?

412
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,220
To become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal.

413
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,180
- Exactly.
- Mm.

414
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,759
- She doesn't suspect that you're lying?
- No.

415
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,719
I'm very happy
because we have a new couple.

416
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,500
They met just two days ago but they're
very much in love and perfectly suited.

417
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,759
They both have the same problem with
their noses, they bleed quite suddenly.

418
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,300
Tomorrow they'll be transferred
to a double room

419
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,700
with a larger wardrobe
and a larger bathroom.

420
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,060
They will remain in the double room
for two weeks,

421
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,420
and then they'll be transferred to
the yachts for a further two weeks.

422
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,999
We wish you every success and we hope
you will return to the city as a couple.

423
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,940
- I'm very happy.
- Me, too.

424
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,460
Congratulations.

425
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,660
The course of your relationship
will be monitored closely

426
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,580
by our staff and by me personally.

427
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,740
If you encounter any problems,
any tensions, any arguing,

428
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,060
that you cannot resolve yourselves,
you will be assigned children.

429
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,079
That usually helps, a lot.

430
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,319
Good morning, room 101.

431
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,020
Seven days left.

432
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,039
Breakfast is served.

433
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,959
You have really nice hair.

434
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,140
I know.

435
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,799
Look.

436
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,359
How do you like mine?

437
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,999
Well, I think you have quite dry hair.

438
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,660
The colour is OK, though.

439
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,439
The most important thing
is that you're not bald.

440
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,719
However, when it comes to men, baldness
is always a possibility you can't avoid.

441
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,399
- Is your father bald?
- No, he isn't.

442
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,220
And even if someday I lose my hair, there
are things I can do to get my hair back.

443
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,860
I can have a hair transplant.

444
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,660
- You can always tell when someone's
had a hair transplant. - I know.

445
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,620
Nice hair is not something you can get.
It's something you're born with.

446
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,919
And the fact that your father isn't bald
shouldn't put you at ease.

447
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,399
Have you decided what
you're going to do on your last day?

448
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,439
I'm still thinking about it.

449
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
Morning, ladies.

450
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,940
So today is your last day.

451
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,940
And as is customary, you can choose how
you would like to spend your last night.

452
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,860
What I always say in these situations is,

453
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,860
it would be wise to choose
something you can't do as an animal...

454
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,119
for example,
read a work of classic literature

455
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,020
or sing a song you really like.

456
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,980
It would be silly to choose

457
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,500
for example a walk in the grounds,

458
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,780
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person,

459
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,399
because those are things
you can do as an animal.

460
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,300
But first your best friend has written
something she'd like to read to you,

461
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,319
which is really very touching.

462
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,980
"We always sat together at school.

463
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,220
And whenever I had a problem,
I talked to you about it

464
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,479
because you always gave the best advice.

465
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,020
When we didn't manage to find
dance partners at the school prom,

466
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,020
the fact that we were together at that
difficult moment gave me strength.

467
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,239
I'm sorry that things have come to this.

468
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,980
I'm sure that if you had a few more days,
you would find someone, just like I did,

469
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,900
because you're an admirable person,

470
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,559
and you have very beautiful hair
and very nice breasts.

471
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,780
I was always jealous of your hair,
you know that.

472
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,199
You were, are, and always will be
my best friend and I'll think of you often.

473
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,620
And I'll always wear those silver earrings
you gave me for my birthday.

474
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,220
I'll miss you.

475
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,020
And however many new girlfriends I make
in a few days when I move back into the city,

476
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,279
I don't think I'll find another as true."

477
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,380
I'd like to watch the film Stand By Me,

478
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,180
with River Phoenix, Kiefer Sutherland
and Richard Dreyfus. Alone.

479
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,140
Excellent choice.

480
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,159
Lovely film.

481
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,340
Please leave a message.

482
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,300
Hello. You're probably in the bathroom,

483
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,620
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.

484
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,839
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.

485
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,159
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.

486
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,119
We'll talk later.

487
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,479
Bye.

488
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,660
One day, as he was playing golf,

489
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,980
he thought that it is
more difficult to pretend

490
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,220
that you do have feelings when you don't

491
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,959
than to pretend you don't have feelings
when you do.

492
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,439
He also thought that he liked her accent,

493
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,879
and he'd always preferred women
with short hair.

494
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,359
So he decided that she was the one.

495
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,140
During the hunt, he would follow her,

496
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,919
and as soon as she shot a loner,
he would say to her,

497
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,540
"I wish we had real guns
instead of these silly tranquiliser ones.

498
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,159
Why don't you kill him
with your bare hands?"

499
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,719
And the moment she puts her hands
around the loner's throat, he would say,

500
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,319
"I hope he dies right away."

501
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,140
Did anyone see what happened?

502
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,780
What happened?

503
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,919
She jumped from the window of room 180.

504
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,340
There's blood and biscuits everywhere.

505
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,359
I hope she dies right away.

506
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,140
On second thoughts

507
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,660
I hope she suffers quite a bit
before she dies.

508
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,980
I just hope her pathetic screams
can't be heard from my room.

509
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,039
Because I was thinking about having
a lie-down and I need peace and quiet.

510
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,660
I was playing golf and I'm quite tired.

511
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,820
The last thing I need is some woman
dying slowly and loudly.

512
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,860
I can't hear you with all this screaming.

513
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,380
We'll talk some other time
when it's quieter.

514
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,839
Goodbye.

515
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,239
Goodbye.

516
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,740
One message.

517
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,500
Hello. You're probably in the bathroom,

518
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,700
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.

519
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,679
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.

520
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,279
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.

521
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,039
We'll talk later.

522
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,039
Bye.

523
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,799
Mind if I join you?

524
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,159
Martini?

525
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,660
I think we are a match.

526
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,679
Yes, I think so too.

527
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,260
The keys to the double room, please.

528
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,959
I wish you the best of luck.
We all wish you the best of luck.

529
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,780
Do you normally sleep on the left
side of the bed or the right?

530
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,799
- The right. You?
- The left.

531
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,359
Perfect.

532
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,879
Spread your legs.

533
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,980
Should I turn off the light
or would you like to read?

534
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,380
I'd like to read.
Does the light bother you?

535
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,700
No.

536
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,660
I'm not bothered by light or noise.

537
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,679
I'm a deep sleeper.

538
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,420
- Hello.
- Hello.

539
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,780
Congratulations.

540
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,220
- Thank you.
- This is our new daughter.

541
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,900
Her name's Elizabeth.

542
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,119
Elizabeth, give the nice man a kiss.
He's a friend of mine.

543
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,359
The last thing I want right now
is a kiss from a silly little girl.

544
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,460
Come on, move away.

545
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,340
Don't cry, Elizabeth, you should thank me.

546
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,999
Now you'll have a limp
and be more like your father.

547
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,780
What was that sound?

548
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,540
Did you say something?

549
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,559
No.

550
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,380
Do you mind if we fuck in a position
where I can see your face?

551
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,639
Sure.

552
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,199
Turn the light on please,
so I can see you better.

553
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,159
Good morning.

554
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,839
Morning.

555
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,839
I killed your brother.

556
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,380
I left him to die very slowly.

557
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,479
He may not be dead yet even as we speak.

558
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,039
I was kicking him for ages.

559
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,039
Doesn't matter.

560
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,519
He whined a little,
a strange kind of bark.

561
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,700
Something like this.

562
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,340
It must have been from the pain.

563
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,359
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.

564
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,039
You really are a deep sleeper.

565
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,319
- Would you like some coffee?
- I'd love some.

566
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,359
As soon as I wash my face
and brush my teeth, though.

567
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,159
I can't wait to hear the story
you promised to tell me last night,

568
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,380
about that student
of yours at the university

569
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,399
and his awful final project.

570
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,879
It's really a very funny story.

571
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,820
His name was Ryess...

572
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,559
R-Y-E-S-S. Ryess.

573
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,839
These aren't tears, it's just water.
I just washed my face.

574
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,540
I knew you were lying.
I can't understand why you did it,

575
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,620
when you know as well as anyone
that a relationship cannot be built on a lie.

576
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,980
We're going to the hotel manager right now
and you'll get the punishment you deserve.

577
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,660
What's the punishment for this?

578
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,239
They turn you into the animal
no one wants to be.

579
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,780
I saw your partner running back that way.

580
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,740
He looked frantic.

581
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,759
Is everything OK?

582
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,860
At first he wanted to kill her
in some horrible and painful way,

583
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,540
like the death she had inflicted
on his brother.

584
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,559
Take her legs, please.

585
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,540
He thought about kicking her
in the stomach over and over again,

586
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,039
and then stabbing her
in the same spot in the stomach.

587
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,260
But then he thought
there wouldn't be much point,

588
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,820
because she was already unconscious

589
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,919
and wouldn't feel any pain
from the kicks, or the knife.

590
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,020
You have to shoot me
so they won't suspect I helped you.

591
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,980
A hotel maid helped him.

592
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,279
He couldn't understand why she did it.

593
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,439
So he decided to turn her into an animal.

594
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,559
He dragged her to the room
where the transformations took place.

595
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,060
I asked him many times
what sort of animal he turned her into,

596
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,100
but he always gave me the same answer:

597
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,119
"That's none of your concern."

598
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,919
That night, he left the hotel
once and for all.

599
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,359
He began to run without knowing
where he was headed.

600
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,239
But he was headed towards us.

601
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,079
This was the start of his new life.

602
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,879
And back then, he didn't know
how much it hurts to be alone,

603
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,260
how much it hurts when you cannot reach
to rub pain-relief ointment on your back,

604
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,279
and you are constantly in pain.

605
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,940
I found him in the woods.

606
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,900
He escaped from the hotel.

607
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,919
Are you a doctor, by any chance?

608
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,959
- No.
- That's a pity.

609
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,460
We need a doctor around.

610
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,260
We had one, but they caught him
a couple of months ago.

611
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,279
I'm an architect.

612
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,660
That's OK.

613
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,100
So, welcome.

614
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,519
You can stay with us
for as long as you like.

615
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,100
You can be a loner until the day you die.
There is no time limit.

616
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,119
Thank you very much.

617
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,980
By the way,

618
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,799
any romantic or sexual relations
between loners are not permitted.

619
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,060
And any such acts are punished.

620
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,079
Is that clear?

621
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,380
Can I have a conversation with someone?

622
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,340
Of course you can.

623
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,319
So as long as there is no flirting
or anything like that.

624
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,879
That applies to dance nights as well.

625
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,439
We all dance by ourselves,
that's why we only play electronic music.

626
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,479
What happened to your mouth?

627
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,279
He can't speak. He was given the Red Kiss.

628
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,220
What's the Red Kiss?

629
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,580
We slashed his lips with a razor
and the lips of another loner,

630
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,580
and we forced them to kiss each other.

631
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,599
That was a couple of days ago now.

632
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,319
But the cuts were deep and they're still
in pain. They were flirting, you know.

633
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,919
Some punishments are worse
than other punishments.

634
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,119
Having your thumb cut is worse
than having your head shaved.

635
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,260
And having a hot boiled egg
under your armpit

636
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,359
is worse than having your leg kicked.

637
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,700
The punishment I am afraid of
isn't the Red Kiss but another one,

638
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,559
that is called the Red Intercourse.

639
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,879
I have never seen it happen, but it's
not difficult to imagine what it means.

640
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,279
Oh, my God, I am so afraid of it.

641
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,519
Move.

642
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,239
Hide.

643
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,599
Move.

644
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,039
Hide.

645
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,599
That was the first time I saw him.

646
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,719
He was hiding behind a tree close to mine.

647
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,879
He seemed quite presentable.

648
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,599
The next day, in the city,

649
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,359
he found out that I was short-sighted too.

650
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,300
That night in my sleep,

651
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,460
I dreamt that we lived in a big house
together in the city,

652
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,580
with a large well-lit kitchen,

653
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,620
and I was wearing dark blue trousers
and a tight cream blouse.

654
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,999
And he took my clothes off
and fucked me up the arse.

655
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,540
And as he was fucking me,
a thug came into the kitchen,

656
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,180
and took the steak knives
from the second draw and attacked us,

657
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,319
stabbing the knives into our bellies
one by one.

658
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,620
I woke up terrified.

659
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,719
Try harder.

660
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,879
Don't give up. You know you should
have been more careful.

661
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,700
Try harder or they'll find you and you'll
be turned into an animal... a weak one.

662
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,140
We must get a move on now.
It's really too dangerous to stay here.

663
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,380
If you manage to free yourself,
run as fast as you can and come find us.

664
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,260
If you manage to free yourself
but think you'll die from the bleeding,

665
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,500
go straight to your grave.

666
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,900
Have you dug your own grave?

667
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,260
Yes.

668
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,220
Very good.

669
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,239
That's enough for now.

670
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,260
I'm going to go hunting for truffles.

671
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,780
They're delicious and quite rare.
A kilo can fetch a lot of money.

672
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,900
You're going to need a pig.
They're impossible to find otherwise.

673
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,220
- I know.
- Don't be long.

674
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,399
- Gotta get them back in 50 minutes.
- OK.

675
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,140
Hello, David.

676
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,159
Hello, Robert.

677
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,300
What you did to that woman was dreadful.

678
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,980
She killed my brother.

679
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,420
I would have done the same thing
if she'd killed you.

680
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,679
You're like a brother to me. Oh,
you're my best friend in the whole world.

681
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,020
I don't think I'm your best friend
in the whole world.

682
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,060
You used to spend much more time
with John.

683
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,020
Oh, who's John?

684
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,980
- John, the Limping Man.
- Oh, yeah.

685
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,940
I didn't even remember his name.

686
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,900
Or his face.

687
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,679
You're the one I think of
whenever I need a friend.

688
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,879
Nevertheless, did John make it?

689
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,420
They're getting ready for the yacht.

690
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,940
It all begins this week.

691
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,780
Everyone says they're gonna make it
as they're perfectly suited

692
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,540
and the child will help them get past
the fighting and arguing.

693
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,660
- That's great.
- You're not thinking about coming back?

694
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,220
You know, if you told the hotel manager
about your brother,

695
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,540
she'd probably forgive you.

696
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,639
No, it's really nice to be on your own.

697
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,180
There's no one tying you down.

698
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,780
You listen to music whenever you like,
you masturbate whenever you want,

699
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,740
go for walks whenever you like,

700
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,700
have a chat whenever you like.

701
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,639
I don't miss companionship at all.

702
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,639
I just miss you,
'cause you were my one true friend.

703
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,220
Are you gonna shoot me?

704
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,860
I'm afraid so.

705
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,820
I only have two days left.

706
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,820
What did you say?
I can't understand the way you speak.

707
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,580
I'm going to shoot you. I only
have two days left, I need more time.

708
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,740
Do you actually believe another day
will make a difference?

709
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,540
Have you seen how ugly you are?

710
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,540
You haven't got a chance.
If I was a woman...

711
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,420
Don't tell anyone I helped you.

712
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,460
If you want to repay me, there is a way.

713
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,799
If you kill a rabbit,
bring it to me to eat.

714
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,540
Do you promise?

715
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,300
- Yes.
- Bye.

716
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,759
Bye.

717
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,799
You carefully flay the rabbit
with a sharp knife and cut off its head.

718
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:00,039
You then slice open its belly and stuff it
with well-washed red and green peppers,

719
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,599
not too spicy,
and a little garlic and mint.

720
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,399
You then soak it in lemon juice
and leave it a while to marinate the flesh

721
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,919
before you skewer it on a stick
and roast it over the fire for about an hour.

722
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,319
That's my favourite food,

723
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,679
rabbit.

724
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,919
Woman, brunette, 50 years old.

725
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,180
Marriage certificate expired
two months ago.

726
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,820
My husband's away on a business trip.

727
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,239
Yeah, OK. Can I have a look?

728
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,199
Hands.

729
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,479
No dirt under her nails
or mud on her shoes.

730
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,199
9 Belsize Road.

731
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,740
- So your husband is away?
- Yes.

732
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,420
Where?

733
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,559
Good morning, sir. Are you here alone?

734
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,380
Good morning, Officer.

735
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,340
No, I'm here with my partner.

736
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,239
She's inside one of the stores,
shopping right now.

737
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,879
Can I see your certificate, please?

738
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,919
My partner keeps it in her purse.

739
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,559
You see, I am losing it all the time.

740
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,460
I see.

741
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,479
And what store is she shopping in?

742
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,399
Oh, here she is.

743
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,060
I'm sorry, darling.

744
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,060
They had such a huge variety
of pain-relief ointment.

745
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,420
I bought you this one.
I hope it's the one you were looking for.

746
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,380
That's wonderful, dear.

747
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,399
Can I have my certificate, please?

748
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,940
Of course, darling.
Would you like to see mine also, Officer?

749
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,900
No, that's OK.

750
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,860
Thank you, sir.

751
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,220
- You have a good day.
- Thank you, Officer. You have a good day.

752
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,319
- Madam.
- Sir.

753
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,100
If I'm walking too slowly,
just say, and I'll pick up my pace.

754
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,119
This pace is fine.

755
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,340
Maybe don't squeeze my hand so tightly,
my palm's getting a little sweaty.

756
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,100
- Better?
- Yes.

757
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,639
Much better.

758
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,300
Are you planning on buying anything else
nice for yourself while we're here?

759
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,119
Yes, contact lens solution
and a Parker Rollerball.

760
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,919
I didn't know you were short-sighted.

761
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,159
I'm short-sighted too.

762
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,900
Will you stay a few days?

763
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,700
I'm afraid not, Papa.

764
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,660
We're heading back again today.

765
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,119
Tomorrow I'm going away
on a business trip.

766
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,700
You know how demanding my job is.

767
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,479
Don't ask if I can stay a few days
every time I come.

768
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,399
Do you all work for the same company?

769
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

770
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,540
My daughter says me
it's a very fine company.

771
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,559
Do you agree?

772
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,239
- It's a rather good company.
- It is.

773
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,079
- One of the best, I'd say.
- Mm.

774
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,940
The only problem with the job

775
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,119
is that I don't have enough time
for my wife and kids.

776
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,439
We have four beautiful children.

777
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,340
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

778
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,959
Thank you.

779
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,039
But even if we'd never had children,

780
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,199
I would never dream of leaving my wife.

781
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,119
Even if it was just the two of us,
on our own,

782
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,940
we'd go on trips.

783
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,079
We'd go to Portofino in Italy
or go to a Greek island for the summer.

784
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,079
And so our relationship would be
as intense as it was at the start.

785
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,119
I love my wife so much

786
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,799
I could die for her.

787
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,399
That's how much I love her.

788
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,919
For your first day in the city,
you did great.

789
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,060
That part about holiday destinations
in the Mediterranean was brilliant.

790
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,559
Thank you very much.

791
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,159
When did you become short-sighted?

792
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,260
When I was 16.

793
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,700
You?

794
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,660
When I was 12.

795
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,319
What was the make
of your first pair of glasses?

796
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,159
I don't remember.

797
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,159
- Do you have astigmatism too?
- Yes.

798
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,519
Would you like me to rub some balm
on your back

799
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,759
on the bits you can't reach on your own?

800
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,359
I'd like that.

801
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,740
Here?

802
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,700
A little lower, please.

803
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,519
- Here?
- Yes.

804
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,500
"Hello, everyone, and good luck.

805
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,039
The room numbers are as follows:

806
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,100
room 306, the hotel manager
and her partner.

807
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,540
They both,

808
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,500
they both have nice voices.

809
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,039
Room 240: couple who both love to ski.

810
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,799
Room 282: couple who
both studied social sciences.

811
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,439
Name of yacht Bliss:
couple prone to nosebleeds."

812
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,740
You and you take 306.

813
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,700
You and you take 240.

814
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,660
You take 282.

815
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,620
And you two, take the yacht.

816
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,239
Can I go to the yacht?

817
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,180
OK, then, so you take the yacht.

818
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,159
And you take 282.

819
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,620
And us three,
we'll take the manager's room.

820
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,239
We have 40 minutes.

821
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,980
You need to speak with the manager.

822
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,959
Wake up.

823
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,279
Get up.

824
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,719
Sit in that seat over there.

825
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,959
Put your hand behind your back.

826
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,500
A basketball weighs
between 550 and 650 grams.

827
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,959
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

828
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,799
Yes.

829
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,300
The weight's different
for men's and women's games,

830
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,380
but that's roughly how much it weighs.

831
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,639
Do you know how much a volleyball weighs?

832
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,039
No, but I'd like to find out.

833
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,500
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

834
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,460
I have something to tell you.

835
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,660
His nose doesn't really bleed on its own.

836
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:04,620
He bangs it against a wall or a piece
of hard wood, or something like that.

837
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,540
Or he cuts it with a penknife
when you're not looking.

838
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,559
You two are not suited.

839
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,940
Shut up. Dad, tell him to leave.
I'm sleepy.

840
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,420
And, and I'm quite sure
that stain on his T-shirt isn't blood,

841
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,980
but cherry juice or tomato ketchup

842
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,860
or red watercolour paint
or something like that.

843
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,879
Or beetroot juice.

844
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,079
Do you love her?

845
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,159
With all my heart.

846
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:34,159
How much do you love her,
on a scale of 1 to 15?

847
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,999
14.

848
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,079
14 is a very impressive score.

849
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,719
He loves her very much indeed.

850
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,460
Who do you think we should kill?

851
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,919
Who will be able to live
on their own better?

852
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,839
Here's a knife, Mum. Kill him.

853
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,420
You'd better get out while you still can.

854
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,239
OK.

855
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,199
That's all I came to say, anyway.

856
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,759
You.

857
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,540
If this woman dies,
d'you think you'll manage on your own?

858
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,740
Or will you get involved
with someone else?

859
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,980
No.

860
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,999
I can live alone, she can't.

861
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,679
I'm on my own for hours
when she's running the hotel.

862
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,639
I like sitting in the room.

863
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,839
It relaxes me, calms me.

864
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,239
I like it a lot.

865
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,860
I can definitely live on my own.

866
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,399
Be quiet.

867
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,439
Take it.

868
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,839
Shoot her.

869
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,119
No.

870
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,220
No, no.

871
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,180
No, God, no.

872
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,679
I'm going to fucking kill your arse.

873
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,500
Don't you fucking care?

874
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,340
Where were you?

875
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,820
I was looking for you.

876
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,919
I was masturbating
behind those trees over there.

877
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,159
Why aren't you dancing?

878
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,919
My leg's a little sore.

879
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,020
Did you dig your grave?

880
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,980
Not yet.

881
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,940
I don't mean to pressure you,

882
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,540
or to ruin the mood
now that we're celebrating,

883
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,580
but at some point you'll have to do it.

884
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,580
Don't expect anyone else to dig your grave
for you or to carry your corpse.

885
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,439
We'll throw some dirt over you
but that's about it.

886
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,980
Tomorrow find a spot you like,

887
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,239
where the ground isn't too rocky,
and make a start.

888
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,399
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thank you.

889
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,839
As soon as his last patient left,
I entered his office and I said to him,

890
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,820
"Honey, the dinner's ready.
However, I'm not sure I can eat right now.

891
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,780
One of my front teeth hurts a lot.

892
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,740
Can you take a look please, dear?"

893
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,700
"Yes, sure, no problem," he said.

894
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,020
And the minute he turned his head, I took
the drill and I shoved it into his chest.

895
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,460
That story sounds really interesting
but I have to leave.

896
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,180
I just remembered I left some batteries
next to a tree down there.

897
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,519
And the last thing I want is to lose them.
Sorry.

898
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,959
Did you catch rabbits?

899
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,540
- No, someone brought me them.
- Who?

900
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,420
A friend of mine.

901
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,439
- Do you want one?
- No.

902
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,740
You don't need to accept rabbits
from other people.

903
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,039
If you need more rabbits, just ask,
and I'll bring you more.

904
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,700
Catching a rabbit is difficult,
but I'll try to do better.

905
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,140
There's no need for you
to be indebted to the others.

906
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,159
Thank you very much.

907
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,940
The man who brought you the rabbits,

908
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,900
is he short-sighted?

909
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,420
I don't know. I don't think so.

910
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,839
OK.

911
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,319
Is that a sparrow up in that tree?

912
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,660
I can't really see that far.

913
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,260
But I don't think so.

914
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,220
- Are you short-sighted?
- No.

915
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,580
You're lying.

916
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,479
It's the truth.

917
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,980
What does it say here?

918
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,999
YKK.

919
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,460
You knew that already.
All zips say the same thing.

920
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,220
I'm not short-sighted.

921
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,700
I don't understand
why you won't believe me.

922
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,180
I can see really clearly.
I used to be a pilot.

923
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,140
You're wearing contact lenses.

924
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:58,300
I don't wear contact lenses.
I'm not short-sighted, I swear.

925
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,879
You are. You think
I'm an idiot and can't tell.

926
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,639
Let me see.

927
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,239
Let me see. I want to see your eyes.

928
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,479
Look up.

929
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,399
Look up.

930
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,159
Up, up.

931
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,719
Look down now.

932
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,599
Look left.

933
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,500
Look right.

934
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,039
Up again.

935
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,159
I'm sorry.

936
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,279
I thought you were trying to fool me.

937
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,559
I'm sorry.

938
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,340
For this synchronisation exercise,
we have to fully concentrate,

939
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,439
as we both have to press "play"
at exactly the same time.

940
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,399
Why don't we just use one headset?

941
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,420
Because that's the whole point.

942
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,380
This is an exercise for us.

943
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,399
We have to be totally synchronised.

944
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,759
OK.

945
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,239
- I'm ready.
- OK.

946
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,639
Five, four, three,

947
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,319
two,

948
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,918
<i>If I show you the roses will you follow?</i>

949
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,039
<i>They call me the Wild Rose</i>

950
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,600
<i>But my name is Elisa Day</i>

951
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,420
We've developed a code so that we
can communicate with each other,

952
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,239
even in front of the others,
without them knowing what we are saying.

953
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,340
When we turn our heads to the left,
it means,

954
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,820
"I love you more
than anything in the world."

955
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,500
And when we turn our heads to the right,
it means,

956
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,479
"Watch out, we're in danger."

957
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,620
We had to be very careful in the beginning
not to mix up

958
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,959
"I love you more than anything in the world"
with "Watch out, we're in danger."

959
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,919
When we raise our left arm, it means,

960
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,660
"I want to dance in your arms."

961
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:49,700
When we make a fist and put it
behind our backs, it means,

962
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,719
"Let's fuck."

963
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,700
The code grew and grew as time went by.

964
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,940
And within a few weeks,
we could talk about almost anything

965
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,359
without even opening our mouths.

966
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,140
Stop it.

967
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,340
That's enough.
Show my parents some respect.

968
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,359
They are playing you music.

969
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,919
- That's OK.
- No, Mother, it is not OK.

970
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,140
Please continue.

971
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,359
Do you want us to perform
the same piece or something else?

972
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,239
Something else.

973
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,839
Didn't her parents play beautifully?

974
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,540
Yes, they did.

975
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,559
It was wonderful.

976
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,260
We love each other and we suit each other.

977
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:29,100
And that's the reason
why we've decided to leave the woods

978
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,239
and stay together forever in the city.

979
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,780
Tomorrow during the hunt,

980
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,340
we're going to disappear
and everyone will think we've been captured,

981
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,959
and that we're going to be turned
into dogs or canaries or something.

982
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,580
I think the first thing I'm going to do

983
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,100
when I get into the city
is buy a bathrobe.

984
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,460
And then we'll go to a pool with a high
diving board, perfect for diving.

985
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,140
"And we'll do
lots of different things together,

986
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,100
serious things, not silly ones,

987
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,719
like go for walks in the park
or play the guitar together."

988
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:34,180
"Portofino. Italian fishing village
and upmarket resort,

989
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,278
famous for its picturesque harbour.

990
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,860
Population: 439.

991
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,820
Beaches nearby:

992
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:45,079
Paraggi Beach, Camogli,
Chiavari and Lavagna.

993
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:50,318
Serifos: Greek island located
in the western Cyclades."

994
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,319
Can you imagine why I brought you
to such a quiet place today?

995
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,239
No.

996
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,359
Because I think it's the perfect spot
for your grave.

997
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,919
Now cover yourself with soil.

998
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,439
Use you hands.

999
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,140
Over your face too.

1000
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,439
You wouldn't want your face to get
eaten by dogs, would you?

1001
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,060
If you die before me,
I'll visit you as often as I can.

1002
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,919
I promise.

1003
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,439
I think we should leave right now.

1004
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,399
The three of us coming here instead of

1005
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,959
two or four is very dangerous.

1006
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,439
Why didn't we think of that earlier?

1007
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,079
Highly likely the doctor will suspect us.

1008
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:40,559
I suggest that we leave
the first chance we get.

1009
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,919
Right now, in fact.

1010
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,719
Don't be afraid.

1011
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,359
No one will suspect a thing.

1012
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,599
I bet you weren't expecting this surprise.

1013
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,639
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yes, it is.

1014
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:01,399
Still, I'd like a few days
just to think it over, so that

1015
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:07,239
I could maybe have the surgery
when we next come to the city.

1016
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,820
What's there to think about?

1017
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,359
If it's better to see clearly
or to be short-sighted? Is that it?

1018
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,260
That's absurd, you know that.

1019
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,300
Anyway, this doctor is the best there is.

1020
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,860
And it's really very difficult
to get an appointment.

1021
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,639
I called him months ago
to get him to see you today.

1022
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,860
She's blind.

1023
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,879
Thank you.

1024
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,879
Throw down your knife and stand up.

1025
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,780
Why did you have to blind me?

1026
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,759
You could have blinded him.

1027
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,420
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1028
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,519
The drugs are messing with your head.

1029
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:05,100
If I were you, I would try and be
a little braver about the whole thing.

1030
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,959
Now get up and give me your knife

1031
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,119
or I'll hit you and take it by force.

1032
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,999
- Here I come.
- I swear I'm going to kill you.

1033
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,999
Let go of my hair, you're hurting me.

1034
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,079
Just think, that when someone goes blind

1035
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:54,100
one of the other senses

1036
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,119
is heightened.

1037
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,300
You could also catch a dog in the woods

1038
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,319
and train it to guide you.

1039
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,359
Dogs can do that, you know.

1040
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,239
I'll help you catch a dog myself.

1041
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,860
Now calm down,
or I'm going to leave you here

1042
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:49,559
and I don't think you'll manage
to find Meeting Point 2 on your own.

1043
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,479
Are you enjoying the view?

1044
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,279
Sure.

1045
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,559
What happened to your hand?

1046
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,860
I was cutting a tree branch with a knife
and I cut myself by accident.

1047
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,660
You look handsome today,
did you get your hair cut?

1048
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,420
Thank you.

1049
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,380
No, I didn't get a haircut.

1050
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:25,340
I'm going to get my hair cut today.

1051
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,900
Look what I brought you.

1052
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,140
Oh, thank you so much.
I'm so hungry, I'll eat it right away.

1053
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,100
It's a bigger flashlight.

1054
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

1055
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:36,159
It's so big, I thought it was a rabbit.

1056
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,180
The biggest flashlight I've ever seen.

1057
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,519
Oh.

1058
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,300
Are you ready for tonight?

1059
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,319
Of course I am.

1060
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,839
I want to tell you something
but please don't be angry.

1061
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,540
OK. What's wrong?

1062
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:56,559
I can't see anything.

1063
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,780
I'm blind.

1064
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,799
What do you mean?

1065
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,039
There's no point in lying to you,
you'll find out sooner or later.

1066
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,639
Our leader blinded me in the city.

1067
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:14,900
She must have realised
that I love you and you love me

1068
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,519
and that we were going to run away
to the city together.

1069
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,319
I'm sorry.

1070
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,359
You can't see at all?

1071
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,599
No, not at all.

1072
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,039
And when you asked if I'd had my hair cut?

1073
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,799
I was just saying that

1074
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:41,839
so you wouldn't realise that I can't see.

1075
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,500
I'm sorry.

1076
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,220
Don't cry.

1077
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,319
Crying will make your eyes hurt more.

1078
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,679
We'll find a way.

1079
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,799
What blood type are you?

1080
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:15,599
B.

1081
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,239
<i>From the first time I saw her,
I knew she was the one</i>

1082
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,679
<i>As she stared in my eyes and smiled</i>

1083
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:37,199
<i>And her lips were the colour of roses</i>

1084
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:41,318
<i>That grew down the river
all bloody and wild</i>

1085
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,380
Do you like berries?
Blueberries, blackberries?

1086
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,399
- No, no.
- Mm.

1087
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,599
Can you play the piano?

1088
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,959
No.

1089
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,180
Plastic cup.

1090
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,199
That's right. Very good.

1091
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,959
Do you speak German?

1092
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,919
No.

1093
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,999
I could teach you German.

1094
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,620
But it would take at least a year for you
to be able to speak the basics,

1095
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,580
not fluently, so there's no point.

1096
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,340
You know, German is one of the most
difficult languages in the world to learn,

1097
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,999
because its grammar is very complicated.

1098
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,359
I brought you something.

1099
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,780
It's a fish.

1100
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,159
Oh.

1101
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,599
<i>On the second day, I brought her a flower</i>

1102
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,119
<i>She was more beautiful
than any woman I'd seen</i>

1103
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,798
<i>And I said,
Do you know where the wild roses grow</i>

1104
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,599
<i>So sweet and scarlet and free</i>

1105
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,020
Kiwi.

1106
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:06,439
That's right, ten out of ten again.

1107
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,519
Can I give you a kiss?

1108
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:16,700
I can't thank you enough
for all the activities and games

1109
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,460
and for keeping me company,

1110
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,079
but you know we can't do that any more.

1111
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:27,700
Would you like to play another round of
Touch-Guess-Think-Win?

1112
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,719
No, that's enough for today.

1113
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,340
In any case, I've run out of things
to test you with.

1114
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,620
Oh.

1115
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,580
Maybe tomorrow

1116
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:39,860
or one of these days.

1117
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,940
Tomorrow morning?

1118
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,639
We'll see.

1119
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,519
- Bye.
- Bye.

1120
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,199
Good afternoon.

1121
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,860
How are you?

1122
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,279
Fine.

1123
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,079
I'm hungry.

1124
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,079
You haven't brought me a rabbit for days.

1125
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,319
Or things for me to touch and guess.

1126
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,940
I've got good news.

1127
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,959
I've had a great idea.

1128
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,559
Have you a minute?

1129
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,239
What kind of idea?

1130
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,679
I raise my left foot,

1131
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,038
I bring my elbow
to my knee and tap it twice.

1132
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,900
I bring my foot to my knee
and tap it three times.

1133
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,159
I lie face down, I kneel down.

1134
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,700
I touch my left cheek

1135
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,439
and then lie face up.

1136
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,199
Are you sure you're prepared to do that?

1137
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,479
Yes, of course I'm sure.

1138
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,079
I wouldn't propose it otherwise.

1139
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,239
When?

1140
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,039
Tomorrow.

1141
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,759
Tomorrow.

1142
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,399
We should speed up a little.

1143
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,020
I can't go much faster.

1144
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,279
The trousers are too tight. I'm sorry.

1145
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,500
It was dark and I couldn't see clearly.

1146
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,519
And I didn't have time to try them on.

1147
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,439
I'm sorry.

1148
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,079
Never mind.

1149
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,359
There's a bus coming.

1150
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,919
It was the hotel coach.

1151
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:24,599
They didn't see us.

1152
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,479
Profile.

1153
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,679
Fingers.

1154
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,439
Elbows.

1155
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,380
Would you like me to show you my belly?

1156
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,919
No.

1157
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,479
I... I remember your belly very well.

1158
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,280
Smile.

1159
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,980
Can I have a knife and fork, please?
Not a butter knife, a steak knife.

1160
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,359
Certainly.

1161
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:17,679
Thank you.

1162
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,479
I'm going to do it with a knife.

1163
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,900
Do you want me to come with you?

1164
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,919
I'd rather you didn't.

1165
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,540
Don't worry.

1166
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:38,799
It's strange at first,
but then you get used to it.

1167
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,820
And your other senses are heightened...

1168
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,399
touch, for example, and hearing.

1169
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:47,239
I know.

1170
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,599
I won't be long.

1171
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,399
Thank you very much.
