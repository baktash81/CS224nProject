Balto, wake up!

8
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:22,604
What? What?
What's the matter?

9
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:25,707
The matter is, you
were having dream again.

10
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:34,383
So what if I was?
It's just a dream.

11
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:39,388
This "just a dream" is keeping
you from a decent sleep.

12
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:41,924
And if your eyes get
any droopier,

13
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,327
you'll have to keep them
open with toothpicks.

14
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:50,732
Boris, they'll stop drooping if you just
go away and let me get some rest.

15
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,569
Wrong! You won't be
getting rest

16
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:57,573
not with that dream hanging
around like... dark cloud.

17
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,977
I hate it when you get dramatic.
How else to reach you?

18
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:06,849
I'm telling you, boychik, if you keep
having same dream again and again.

19
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:08,851
it means something!

20
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:11,687
Boris,

21
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:14,256
dreams don't mean anything.
They're just

22
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:17,426
dreams.

23
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:20,028
Now, you wanna come with me?

24
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:22,731
I have to go check on Jenna.

25
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:27,635
Of course I come! I'm not
finished nagging you yet!

26
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:32,808
So, if dreams mean nothing,

27
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,612
why does it always have
raven and pack of wolves?

28
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:38,780
Why not pickled herring?

29
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:41,416
Because herring would be in
one of your dreams, not mine.

30
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:45,988
Precisely! Raven and wolves
have meaning only to you.

31
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:48,690
<font color="#8080ff">[Gasps]</font>
Balto, look!

32
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:53,295
On totem pole,
there is raven and wolf!

33
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:57,165
Calm down, Boris. There's
also a fox, a wolverine.

34
00:03:57,232 --> 00:04:01,837
Such scary creatures! They
should only live and be well...

35
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,006
far away from me.

36
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:08,343
And a bear and a caribou.

37
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:11,613
They're just wood carvings,
Boris. Yes, I know.

38
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,249
Humans use them to tell stories.

39
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:17,319
But of what, I don't know.

40
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:21,590
Balto, maybe seeing raven
and wolf on totem pole...

41
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:26,128
is making you dream
something very important.

42
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:30,199
Well, like what?
Like something you forgot.

43
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:35,204
Or maybe something
you are supposed to know.

44
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,808
Look, Boris, all I know is that the totem
pole marks the shortcut to Jenna's.

45
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,844
And that's good enough
for me.

46
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,314
Oh, boy!
Stubborn. Ach!

00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:50,819
<font color="#8080ff">[Yapping]</font>

48
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:57,392
There you are, laddies!

49
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:01,230
I've been smelling
all over for you!

50
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:03,398
<font color="#8080ff">[Continues Yapping]</font>

51
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,504
Would you stop with the bouncing
and make with the talking?

52
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,506
I'm getting dizzy!

53
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:13,775
<font color="#8080ff">[Yapping, Panting]</font>

54
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:16,411
The stork has landed.
I repeat

55
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,249
the stork has landed!

56
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:23,118
Jenna? Jenna!

57
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:26,121
<font color="#8080ff">[Yapping]</font>

58
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:31,059
What stork? I thought we
were talking about raven.

59
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:35,030
Oh, boy. That stork.
I'm coming, Balto!

<font color="#8080ff">[Gulps]</font>

62
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:57,419

They don't bite,

63
00:05:57,486 --> 00:06:00,322
at least not yet.

66
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:08,931
they're so beautiful

67
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:10,933
just like you.

68
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,703
<font color="#8080ff">[Whimpering]</font>

69
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,374

Oh, no.

82
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:14,590
Good morning, sleepyhead.

83
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,327
Did you forget about watching the pups
today while my girl and I go on a picnic?

84
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:21,430
What? Me? Forget?

85
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,999
<font color="#8080ff">[Yawns]</font> Never.

86
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,877
Balto, you look so tired.
What's wrong?

87
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:36,879
Oh, nothing.

88
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,149
Hey, pups!
Good to see you too.

89
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,619
Hey, watch it, now!
Come on. That tickles!

90
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:50,292
<font color="#8080ff">[Yapping]</font>

91
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:03,739
Say, why don't they spend the night with me
and then tomorrow we can all go on a picnic?

92
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:08,744
Balto, don't you remember? Tomorrow is the
day for our pups to find their new homes.

93
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,181
Tomorrow? But, Jenna,
they're only 8 weeks old.

94
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:14,917
I mean, what's the hurry?

95
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:18,687
I know how you feel, Balto.
Puppy! Come to Uncle Boris!

96
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:21,490
<font color="#8080ff">[Pups]</font> Uncle Boris!

97
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,261
But it's their time now. I was their
age when I was adopted by my girl.

98
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:30,999
But I don't think I can let
them go, Jenna, not yet.

99
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:34,937
That's tickling me!
Ow! Ow!

100
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:36,939
That's my wing!
Balto,

101
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:40,008
each of our children have
their own lives to live.

102
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:42,010
<font color="#8080ff">[Boris Yelling]</font>

103
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:45,948
It's our job to love them
and then... Let go!

104
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:49,618
If we wait until they're older, it'll
be harder for them to find homes.

105
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:52,454
You know how humans have
a soft spot for puppies.

106
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,890
Yeah and so do I.

107
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:58,760
Come on, Balto. All their humans
will be from around here.

108
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:03,599
I've got to go meet my girl
now. Enjoy them, Balto.

109
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:06,168
And watch out,
they're teething.

110
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:10,339

Strange, her brothers and
sisters look just like dogs.

116

yet Aleu looks just like...

117
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:43,205
a dog. Aleu looks
like a dog too.

118
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:47,743
Funny, but from where
I stand, I see daughter

119
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:50,712
who looks even more
wolf than father.

120
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:53,715
Look, Boris, I just
don't want her to be

121
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:56,218
different.

122
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:58,253
But she is different!

123
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,224
And vive la difference!

124
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,727
Come on.
Being different is painful.

125
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:08,263
Nobody knows that
better than me.

126
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,267
You know how some of the dogs around
here still tease me because I'm half wolf?

127
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,070
Aleu may look like a wolf,

128
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:18,473
but she is going
to be all dog.

Sorry, Mama.

135

It just happens
when I'm excited.

136
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:44,299
I'm excited too!
I can't wait to get a human

137
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:47,469
and chew on their socks!

138
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:52,874
Papa, are you gonna
get a human too?

139
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:57,779
Nah. See, humans like
cute little puppies like you

140
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,748
not old grizzly grownups like me.

141
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:03,318
These are Rosie's puppies,
Daddy. Jenna had 'em.

142
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:06,922
I like this one.

143
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:10,359
I know that human.
He'll be a good boy for Dingo.

144
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:14,796
And my puppy can play with Jenna
when Rosie and I play together.

145
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:16,899
Mommy, look puppies!

146
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,923

<i>Is taking you home</i>

It's been a long day,
Jenna. Let's go home.

166
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:55,631
But we can't. Well, not
until a human adopts Aleu.

167
00:13:55,731 --> 00:14:00,002
Face it, Jenna. Aleu looks
more like a wolf than me

168
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,170
No human is ever gonna want her.

169
00:14:02,237 --> 00:14:04,239
That's not true!

170
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,808
We'll just have to keep trying.

Knock off the rough housing.

182
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:06,161
Aleu, how can I babysit
if you won't sit?

183
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:10,999
You don't sit now here for
more than 5 seconds!

184
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:14,403
That's "anywhere,"
Uncle Boris.

185
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:18,440
What's anywhere? Don't try
to confuse me, young lady.

186
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,542
I'm your baby-sitter.

187
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:24,580
Uncle Boris, since I'm not a baby
anymore, I don't need a baby-sitter.

188
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,583
And you can tell that to
my father. Come on, Aleu.

189
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:30,919
You'll always be my baby,
no matter how old you are.

190
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:33,589
You're hopeless.

191
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:35,624
Let's go.

192
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:40,896
What's going to happen when
a human picks me up. Papa?

193
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:43,232
Who are you going to baby then?

194
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,369
Come on, guys!

195
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:49,571
She's a good pup.

196
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:52,040
"Good, " yes.
"Pup, " no.

197
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:57,679
At more than year old, Aleu
should have home of her own.

198
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,416
When the right time comes,
she'll find a home.

199
00:17:03,418 --> 00:17:06,154
Yes, but when the
right time comes.

200
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:08,156
will you let her?

201
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,628
I hope so.

I don't understand. Papa.
Why did you attack him?

227
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:24,193
What if he wanted
to adopt me?

228
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:29,832
Guys, could you help mе
out here? Of course.

229
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:32,134
Sorry, mate.

230
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:35,636
But a wise polar bear always
minds his own business.

231
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:40,676
It is my opinion that...
Waah!

232
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:44,446
Well? Okay.

233
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:49,551
See, that hunter was looking
for wild animals to kill

234
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:53,989
for food and fur. So?
I'm not a wild animal.

235
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:59,327
Well, he thought you were.
What? Why?

236
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:03,398
He thought you were a wolf.

237
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:05,467
I knew there was
something wrong with me.

238
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:09,538
There is nothing wrong with you.
You have a proud heritage. Sure.

239
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:14,208
Your mother is a purebred Husky.
Then what are you?

240
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:18,380
I'm the one who's part wolf.
How could this happen?

241
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:20,382
Look, Aleu,

242
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:24,853
my dad was a Husky
who had pups with a wolf.

243
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,222
Great. My grandmother
was a wild animal?

244
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,225
Did the wolf teach you how to know
when a human wants to kill you?

245
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:33,462
I was accidentally separated
from her when I was young.

246
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:38,700
So, I never spent much
time with... the wolf.

247
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:43,639
But I remember that she
was as white as snow.

248
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:48,076
That she had this warm voice
that made me feel safe.

249
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:50,946
Well, then Boris
took me in, and

250
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:55,016
after being raised by a goose, it's a
wonder I don't honk instead of bark.

251
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:00,022
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

252
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:02,824
Because... I wanted
to protect you.

253
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:05,727
Protect me? From what?

254
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:10,966
From the fact that no human will ever
want me because I'm part wild animal?

255
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:13,435
Aleu... And what about
my brothers and sisters?

256
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:16,772
They've got wolf in them too?
Why did humans want them?

257
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:19,608
Because they don't look it

258
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:22,277
and you do.

259
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:25,514

She's around here
somewhere, I...

284

you can't find her?

No, no.

286
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:52,254
I just wanted to give her some time.
I was sure she'd come home.

287
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,790
She's gotta be
at her mother's.

I don't know.

293
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,604
I was hoping she was with you.
She's... kinda mad at me.

294
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:45,574
Stay there.

295
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,714
Now, tell me what happened.

296
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:59,187
A hunter took aim at her.

297
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:02,057
No, don't worry.
We got away.

298
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:05,561
But I finally had to tell her
how humans see her.

299
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:08,797
You mean, you told her
about being part...

300
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:13,468
Yes. We should have done
it sooner. I know that now.

301
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:16,171
She's so angry with me.

302
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:18,807
She must have run away.
Run away?

303
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:22,477
I'm sorry, Jenna. I never thought
it would turn out this way.

304
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:26,648
I thought I could keep her safe. But she
is not safe now. She's running wild!

305
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:30,586
We've got to find her.
No, not you, Jenna.

might be a raven.

320

might be a hunter.

I'm not disappointed.

if you'll help me out of this trap.

How did you know I'm looking for
my daughter? The raven told me.

324
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:11,079
What do you know about the raven?
Less than you, I'm sure.

325

deal or don't we?

334

And now you must
help yourself.

335

337
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:06,567
Then let the current

Gee, Uncle Boris, Luc and me. We was
just trying to communicate with the toad.

344
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:14,069
Communicate with toad.
Ribbit. Yeah, see there?

345
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:16,305

I don't know.

I can't see nothing.
Balto!

362

Balto! Balto!
It's Aleu!

363
00:32:30,312 --> 00:32:34,716
Answer me! Boris,
I've got Aleu's trail.

364
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:38,820
Go back and tell Jenna not to worry.
I'm going to find Aleu and bring her home.

365
00:32:38,854 --> 00:32:44,259
Come, we do as Balto
says and go tell Jenna.

366
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:48,397
But Uncle Boris, Luc and me
wanted to go on a journey.

367
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:54,136
I'm sorry, boys, but this journey
is for Balto and Aleu alone.

368
00:32:57,206 --> 00:32:59,374
What do you mean,
'he just ran off"?

369
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:01,843
I mean, he's got Aleu's scent.

370
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,814
Told me to tell you not to
worry and away he went.

371
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:07,983
He's a wolf on a mission.

372
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,485
I'm going to go help him look.

373
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:15,290
No, Jenna! This is a journey
for father and daughter.

374
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:18,026
You must have faith in them.

375
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:20,295
You're sure Balto has her trail?

376
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:23,499
And you're sure
Balto's all right?

377
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,870
Don't worry, Jenna.
Remember, they're well-equipped.

378
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:31,240
They are both part wolf.

379
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:34,243
Your fears.

380
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:37,346
I have no reason to fight the
wolverine clan. What do you want?

381
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:41,817
You invade our territory.
What do you want?

382
00:33:41,884 --> 00:33:45,954
Only to pass through unharmed.
I'm looking for my daughter.

383

He's looking for his daughter.
<font color="#8080ff">[Laughs Evilly]</font>

A raven?
Why not a fox?

386
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:57,799
Or did she outwit you?

387
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:05,340
Tell me, are you afraid?

388
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:11,446
No! Come now.

389
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:15,617
Are you sure?

390
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:18,820
Okay, I'm afraid.

391
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:24,026
Of course you are! And you
must listen to your fears.

392
00:34:24,092 --> 00:34:28,931

we are, but not who we are.

When every creature in the world is
born, a spirit stands beside them.

445

Why? To light their way
through the long, dark night

446
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:52,361
and sing them songs
to guide them. Why?

447
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:56,365
Because each of us has a destiny
that sets us all apart.

in the heart.

<i>Fathers and teachers

But we'll be killed.

502

And we'll be killed
if we don't.

503

I hope you're right.

504
00:44:07,643 --> 00:44:12,481
You knew the ledge was
here. Yeah, I did sorta.

505
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:16,117
How? I looked
at the bear...No.

506
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:19,421
I looked at his thoughts
and I saw it.

507
00:44:19,454 --> 00:44:22,357
Why did you come
and find me?

508
00:44:22,424 --> 00:44:26,728
I came to bring you home, Aleu.
No. I don't wanna go home

509
00:44:26,795 --> 00:44:29,531
not until I find out
who I am.

510
00:44:29,598 --> 00:44:32,701
That's ridiculous, Aleu.
You know who you are.

511
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:37,238
No. I know what I am,
but not who I am.

512
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:43,011
And I'm not stopping until I find
out. Then I'm coming with you.

513
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:46,648
Oh, Papa.

514
00:44:46,648 --> 00:44:52,086
It's saltwater. Aleu, we're close
to the ocean. Come on.

515
00:45:16,812 --> 00:45:20,082
I sure would like to know why
I keep seeing that raven.

516
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:23,085
You've been following a raven?

517
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:26,755
Yeah. I know it sounds dumb.

518
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:29,758
I've been seeing this 
raven in my dreams.

00:45:29,758 --> 00:45:31,927
Your dreams?

520
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:34,930
I only followed it because it
promised to help me find you.

521
00:45:34,997 --> 00:45:39,268
I've been seeing a raven too.

522
00:45:39,334 --> 00:45:44,740
I wasn't sure if I was following it or...
You think that could be them, Sumac?

523
00:45:44,806 --> 00:45:48,443

00:45:51,513 --> 00:45:56,351

it doesn't smell friendly.

Let's get out of here.

535
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:32,821
See anything?
No. Maybe I was wrong.

536
00:46:32,888 --> 00:46:35,591
Look, Papa!

537
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:40,295
Oh, I love it here.
It's so wild. Come on!

538
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:43,332
Don't go out too far, Aleu.
The tide's coming in fast.

539
00:46:44,566 --> 00:46:47,102
I'll be fine.

540
00:46:53,842 --> 00:46:58,480
I don't like you being out here.
You could slip and fall.

541
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,851
Papa, you've got to
stop worrying about me.

542

But, Niju, the tide!
We'll drown.

Yes, there's always that chance.

But then, if you don't take it,

take what's left of our food.

I will not let you, an aging fool,

I admire your passion, Niju,

but do not mistake my old age for
weakness nor your youth for strength.

No.

589
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:05,060
My brothers and sisters,
our summer is almost passed

590
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:09,064
and I have listened to the trees
and to the blades of grass.

591
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:15,403
And they have said this:
The caribou will not return this year

592
00:51:17,306 --> 00:51:21,743
nor any other year, for they
have crossed the Great Water.

593
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:27,082
If we are to survive,
we must follow them.

594
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:31,086
The old one believes that
trees and grass can talk.

595
00:51:31,153 --> 00:51:36,657
It is time to realize that our
leader has lost his ability to lead.

596
00:51:39,127 --> 00:51:43,432
How dare you say that! Yes,
Nava has always led us well.

597
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:47,703
Stop! Let him speak.

598
00:51:47,703 --> 00:51:49,805
It is his right.

599
00:51:49,805 --> 00:51:54,643
Nava would have us leave the land that
has been our clan's home for generations.

600
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,579
So what if the caribou
do not return this year?

601
00:51:57,646 --> 00:52:01,149
This does not mean they will not
come again. Niju could be right.

602
00:52:01,149 --> 00:52:06,121
And he could be wrong. If we do stay,
how will we survive without the caribou?

603
00:52:06,121 --> 00:52:10,959
They bring us life. Simple, we take
what we need from other clans.

604
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:13,829
Steal from others?
It isn't right.

605
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:16,899
When you're hungry, there is no
"right. " Yes, there is a "right"...

606
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:18,901
our right to survive.

607
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:23,272
And if we eat the food of other
clans, what will they eat?

608
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,674
That is not our concern.

609
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:29,611
Is not the balance of our
world the concern of all?

610
00:52:29,678 --> 00:52:34,883
If we steal from other clans, those
clans will be forced to steal as well.

611
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:38,287
Soon, we will all be fighting
for less and less food.

612
00:52:38,353 --> 00:52:43,692
"Less and less food. " That sounds
bad, doesn't it, Sumac?

613
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:48,997
Yeah. Really bad.
Unless you're on diet.

614
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:51,300
Who's on a diet?

615
00:52:51,366 --> 00:52:55,437
Aniu, the white wolf, has 
come to me in dream visions

616
00:52:55,437 --> 00:52:58,407
and has told me
what we must do.

617
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:02,811
She said we must move on
and we must be led

618
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:06,415
by the one who is wolf
and does not know.

619
00:53:06,481 --> 00:53:08,817
Papa?

620
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:11,620
Look, I'm flattered.
Really.

621
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,457
I mean I've led a dog team
before, but never a wolf pack.

00:53:23,632 --> 00:53:28,069
has brought a mutt to guide us.

His blood may be pure,
but his motives aren't.

628
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:56,264
I say Niju is afraid
to cross the Great Water.

629
00:53:56,265 --> 00:54:01,870
I am not afraid, but crossing
the Great Water is impossible!

630
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,406
We cannot swim it.
We would all die.

631
00:54:04,473 --> 00:54:07,776
So now I, Niju,

632
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:13,048
say Nava must step down and
let a true leader take his place.

633
00:54:13,115 --> 00:54:16,385
I will step down, Niju,

634
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:19,521
when a true leader
takes my place.

641
00:55:15,677 --> 00:55:18,113
I simply became one
with the tree.

I'd get splinters.

645
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,930
But now we must speak of how
you will lead us to the caribou.

646
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:38,700
Nava, I don't understand
how I can lead you anywhere.

647

even know what they mean.

show us the way.

663

All is a great dance of balance.
You have questions.

664
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:33,108
Why is Niju so against
moving the clan?

665
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:37,346
What is he afraid of?
Niju is not a coward.

666
00:58:37,412 --> 00:58:42,651
He is not afraid to die,
but he is afraid of change.

667
00:58:42,718 --> 00:58:48,189
He would rather face starvation than
leave the land he believes is ours.

668
00:58:48,624 --> 00:58:52,094
This world through
which we wander

669
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,364
is wonderful and strange.

670
00:58:57,566 --> 00:59:00,936
The only truth
we can really know

671
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:05,106
is that everything will change.

We strike the bear clan first.
Yeah I. Yeah I.

700
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:41,696
You're not striking anyone, Niju.
You're outnumbered, half-breed.

701
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:48,737
Papa! Nava is right, Aleu.

702
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:54,576
Following the caribou is choosing life.
I can't ignore my dreams any longer.

703
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:59,114
Your dreams will lead to our deaths!
No, I've seen it too, Niju.

704
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:02,284
We must follow the caribou
across the water.

705
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:05,420
Staying here would mean
starvation for the clan.

706
01:02:05,487 --> 01:02:10,359
Hear that? She has seen it too.
Maybe Niju is the fool.

707
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:14,862
I've heard enough. You will
not stop us. Take them!

708
01:02:21,403 --> 01:02:23,838
Look!

709
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:32,180
Aniu told me the time to leave would
come with the great breaking of the ice.

710
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,250
But more than that,
I do not know.

711
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:38,153
The ice floes are lining up.

712
01:02:38,153 --> 01:02:41,123
It's like they're making a bridge.
A bridge to the caribou.

713
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:45,427
Last winter, the caribou crossed an
ice bridge to land on the other side.

714
01:02:45,494 --> 01:02:48,130
And now that bridge
is forming again.

715
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,599
Now I understand.

716
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,870
If we're to cross,
we must go now.

717
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:01,610
The old one spoke the
truth about Balto.

718
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,579
We must go!

719
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:17,993
I'm running now.
This is me running.

720
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:21,296
And just where do you think
you three are going?

721
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:24,299
I know I don't usually...

722
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:30,072

but Nava is right.

723
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:33,308
Besides, I'm hungry.

Come on, boys. Let's
go find some caribou.

725

Get back here!
I order you!

726
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:43,318
The ice path will only
hold for a short time.

Buddy up, then stick with your partner
in case either of you needs help.

Nava won't be able
to make the swim.
