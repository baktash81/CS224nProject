1
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,008
Well?

2
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,773
Zeus, king of the gods
of the Greeks...

3
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,736
...write in the ashes
so that I may read the future.

4
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,115
I see...

5
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,787
...a great tree
at the end of the world.

6
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:47,416
And in its branches there hang
the skull and the skin of a ram.

7
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,544
They gleam and shine...

8
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,422
...for it is a prize of the gods,
a Golden Fleece.

9
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,718
We've no time for riddles
and mysteries. Tell me of tonight.

10
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,685
Pelias, you will conquer tonight.

11
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,437
You will overthrow
the kingdom of Thessaly.

12
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,899
You will kill the king, Aristo,
and wear his crown.

13
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,902
You will do all these things
without fear or wound...

14
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,737
...because Zeus commands it.

15
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:21,784
If I’m protected by Zeus,
I will have no need of this.

16
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,246
I will lay it on the fire
as a thank offering to the gods.

17
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,290
Pelias...

18
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:32,461
...it is also foretold that although
you will win the throne of Aristo...

19
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,632
...you will, when Zeus ordains,
lose it...

20
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,468
...to one of Aristo's children.

21
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:45,516
-Then Aristo will have no children.
-He has three, Pelias.

22
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,270
Two daughters,
Philomela and Briseis...

23
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,564
...and a son, Jason.

24
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,902
Then two daughters and a son
will die with their father tonight.

25
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,396
Hera, queen of gods, protect
this child, my sister Philomela.

26
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,065
And if I, Briseis, am worthy...

27
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,401
...take me into your protection.

28
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,762
Are you Briseis,
the daughter of Aristo?

29
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,057
Be silent. She is praying.

30
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,855
For her sister
and for her murdered father, Aristo.

31
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,190
Are you a priestess?

32
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,859
I serve the gods.

33
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,821
Then tell me, has Briseis
called upon the goddess Hera?

34
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,031
She has.

35
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,867
And has the goddess
heard her prayer?

36
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,618
Yes.

37
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,955
Then pray for me.

38
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,503
It is the will of Zeus.

39
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,757
It is not the will of Zeus.
It is your will.

40
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,301
Zeus has given you a kingdom.

41
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,471
The rest will be your own doing.

42
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,644
The gods abandon you, Pelias.

43
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,980
A one-sandaled man shall come...

44
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,484
...and no god shall protect you
from him.

45
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,778
A one-sandaled man?

46
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,448
The child who has escaped you:
Jason.

47
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,623
Then why was I not told
the whole prophecy?

48
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,502
Why did Zeus drive me
to kill this girl...

49
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,463
...when the only one I needed to kill
was Jason?

50
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,424
Zeus cannot drive men
to do what you have done.

51
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,843
Men drive themselves
to do such things...

52
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,762
...that the gods may know them...

53
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,140
...and that men
may understand themselves.

54
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,685
The killing of Jason
would do you no good.

55
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,024
Kill Jason and you kill yourseIf.

56
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,088
Zeus, my godly husband,
did you, for some reason...

57
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,757
...order the profanation
of my temple in Thessaly?

58
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,260
That was entirely
the thought of Pelias.

59
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,388
Not content with winning the throne
of Thessaly, as I wished...

60
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:56,142
...he tried to avoid losing it
as I have commanded.

61
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,149
I know that you've
been insulted, my dear.

62
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,402
But be content.
The boy, Jason, has escaped.

63
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,904
-He will avenge you.
-How?

64
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,658
You must know by now I never arrange
exact and precise details--

65
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,370
And because you are neither exact
nor precise, a young girl was killed...

66
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,165
...and my temple was profaned.

67
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,669
-I want to help Jason.
-No.

68
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,755
You may help the infant, Philomela,
if you wish. She's a girl.

69
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,465
The rest is man's work.

70
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,303
No. I want to help Jason.

71
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,471
As you wish.

72
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,684
How many times did Aristo's daughter
Briseis call upon you?

73
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,021
-By name?
-Five.

74
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,149
Well, then you can help
her brother five times.

75
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:49,445
Five times only you can help him
to overthrow Pelias.

76
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,239
And that is my final word.

77
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,701
It will be 20 years
before Jason becomes a man.

78
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,330
Oh, an instant of time
here on Mount Olympus...

79
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,459
...but a long 20 years
for King Pelias.

80
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,298
He cautiously travels
the roads of Thessaly.

81
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:13,761
Yes, Pelias, you have had years
of watching and waiting...

82
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,138
...for the man
who must come to kill you.

83
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,475
The man with one sandal.

84
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,508
I owe you my life.

85
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,011
That was as good a way
to ford a river as any.

86
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,722
But I seem to have lost a sandal
in doing it.

87
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,724
Where are you traveling?

88
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,309
To the palace of the king.

89
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,353
-Pelias?
-Pelias of Thessaly.

90
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,815
Then I can put you on your way.

91
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,654
But first, you must accept
the hospitality of my camp.

92
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,448
Come.

93
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,603
Be seated.

94
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,421
You have not yet
told me your name.

95
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,716
I am Jason,
the lawful king of Thessaly.

96
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,388
One of my father's soldiers rescued
me and brought me up in exile.

97
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,473
Now I’ve returned
to claim my kingdom.

98
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,893
I have waited for you for 20 years.

99
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,479
And in that 20 years,
Pelias has turned my kingdom...

100
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,316
...from the pride of Greece
to a savage, evil land.

101
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,818
I shall need your help.

102
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:20,906
When your father defended his throne,
no man fought harder than I.

103
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,617
This time it will not
be enough to fight.

104
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,119
I could fight.

105
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,746
I could find Pelias and kill him.

106
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,748
But the people need more
than a leader.

107
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,252
They must believe
the gods have not deserted them.

108
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,630
-They need a miracle.
-And where will you find this miracle?

109
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,341
I have heard there is a tree
at the end of the world...

110
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,010
...with a fleece of gold
hanging in its branches.

111
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,679
I have heard this too.

112
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,931
So have many men.

113
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,559
They say it is a gift of the gods.

114
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:53,188
It has the power to heal, bring peace
and rid the land of plague and famine.

115
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,358
If I could find this prize
and bring it home to Thessaly...

116
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,654
...then it would inspire the people,
wipe out the years of misrule.

117
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,073
They would know the gods
have not abandoned them.

118
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,033
My land would be
rich and strong again...

119
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,079
...as it was before this tyrant, Pelias,
murdered my father.

120
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,372
Jason...

121
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,083
...be advised by me.

122
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,544
First, search for this Golden Fleece.

123
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,881
Do not reveal yourseIf to Pelias,
but build a ship...

124
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,550
...and find a crew,
and when you have this prize...

125
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,385
...then and only then...

126
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,847
...return and kill Pelias.

127
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,356
And now rest yourseIf.

128
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,902
My companions are yours
to command.

129
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,036
Father, why do you let him live?

130
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:53,999
If I destroy him, Acastus,
I destroy myself.

131
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,251
While he is searching
for the Golden Fleece...

132
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:00,088
...he is at the ends of the earth
and I am safe.

133
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,424
And if he finds it?

134
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,928
You will be there.

135
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,899
Have you come to pray
to the gods, Jason?

136
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,278
If I had, I wouldn't
have chosen a fallen one.

137
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,114
Only a statue.

138
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,244
Sometimes the gods argue
amongst themselves.

139
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,954
Then great winds blow...

140
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,789
...and temples fall.

141
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,625
-Hermes.
-Yes?

142
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,755
No, I said the statue
was the god Hermes.

143
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,676
-Hermes.
-Yes.

144
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,138
A bringer of dreams
and a prowler of the night.

145
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,808
Jason.

146
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,607
No man can tell you
how to find the fleece.

147
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,362
Is it not time you asked the gods?

148
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,657
They will not answer
those who believe in them.

149
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,784
Why should they answer one
who doesn't?

150
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,289
Come with me.

151
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,166
Why?

152
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,837
So that you will believe...

153
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,506
...and be answered.

154
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,965
You win, my lord.

155
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,637
That is, the battle, not the war.

156
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,476
Oh, those waters
are far too shallow for galleys.

157
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,271
Hera, my dear, you really must learn
to win without cheating.

158
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,441
Or at least to lose gracefully.

159
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,621
-Greetings, Hermes.
-Greetings, my lord Zeus.

160
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,708
There seems to be a piece missing.

161
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,043
Perhaps I can help.

162
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,471
Welcome to Olympus, Jason.

163
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,939
Jason come to Mount Olympus
at last.

164
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,818
No man calls upon the gods
unless he wants something.

165
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,321
We arranged for you
to be brought here by Hermes.

166
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,117
I wouldn't have believed a mortal
could ask the help of the gods...

167
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,328
...much less visit them.

168
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,206
Well, at least you're honest.

169
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,501
Which is more than I can say
for most other mortals.

170
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,004
What is it you want?

171
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,548
A ship? A crew?

172
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,760
No. Those I can find myself.

173
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,597
And what are you going to use
in place of gold?

174
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,348
The hearts of men.

175
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,519
I am Hera, queen of the gods
and your protector on this voyage.

176
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,773
But my lord Zeus has decreed a limit
to the number of times...

177
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,193
... I may help you when you call
upon me. Do not speak now.

178
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,861
I know what you must ask of me.

179
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,907
Does the Golden Fleece exist?
And if so, where is it?

180
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,533
That's two questions.

181
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,578
And I shall help him
with only one answer.

182
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,538
Search in the land of Colchis.

183
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,875
Then it does exist.

184
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,586
But Colchis....

185
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,964
That's the end of the world.
No Greek has ever sailed there.

186
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,674
Now that you've heard that...

187
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,220
...are you so sure
that you will not need my help?

188
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,889
Think carefully.

189
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,184
I offered him a ship.

190
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,103
A ship and a crew.

191
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,065
And he refused me.

192
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,400
Refused the help of the gods?

193
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:21,326
What ship is strong enough
to reach to the edge of the world?

194
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,246
What crew brave enough
to sail in her?

195
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,748
I shall tell
the shipbuilders of Greece...

196
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,709
...that the richest cargo in the world
waits in Colchis.

197
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,628
The Golden Fleece
is worth a kingdom.

198
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:35,924
I shall say that only the strongest ship
ever built will survive the voyage.

199
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,510
The athletes of Greece are proud.

200
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,929
I'll tell them only the best
can expect a place...

201
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,473
...in the most perilous voyage
in history.

202
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,933
I shall announce a games...

203
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,769
...invite the strongest
and bravest of the Greeks.

204
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,939
No greater games
shall ever be held...

205
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,441
...unless the gods decree otherwise.

206
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,156
I did well to choose you, Jason.

207
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:05,120
The gods are best served
by those who want their help least.

208
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,960
Welcome, Polydeuces.

209
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,505
Castor of Sparta.

210
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,013
Acastus of Thessaly.

211
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,897
Well done, Acastus.

212
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,443
Phalerus of Athens,
champion archer of Greece.

213
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,112
Euphemus of Taenarum.

214
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,698
Spyros of Syracuse.

215
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,491
Hercules!

216
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,410
He's here!

217
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,509
I mean to sail with you, Jason. Tell me
which champion you want me to beat.

218
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,264
No one. I know you can beat us all.
Your place is reserved.

219
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,851
Hercules. Yes.

220
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,898
-Hercules?
-Yes.

221
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,691
My name is Hylas.

222
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,070
Like you, I came too late
to compete in the games.

223
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,031
But it occurs to me that
if I can beat you at something...

224
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,784
...Jason couldn't refuse me
a place on the ship either.

225
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:34,668
After all, he might need brains
as well as brawn.

226
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,421
Shall we compete?

227
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,469
Discus?

228
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,850
Come on.

229
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,067
-See that rock?
-Yes.

230
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,736
No thrower has ever reached it.

231
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:05,365
And is the contest to hit it
or pass it?

232
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,871
You'll be lucky if you get halfway.

233
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,124
-Now, go on.
-No, after you, Hercules.

234
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,168
I’ve never thrown a discus before.

235
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,296
I’d like to see how it's done.

236
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,963
Let Hylas have his moment of triumph
while he may.

237
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,091
You shall have your place, Hylas.

238
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,177
Hail Hylas!

239
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,472
I have found the finest crew
in all Greece.

240
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,808
Now for a ship
that is worthy of them.

241
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,775
Argos.

242
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,862
-Argos.
-Hello?

243
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,906
Is that you, Argos?

244
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,326
-Who's there?
-It's Jason.

245
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,870
Come aboard.

246
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,434
So you've come back again.

247
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,770
She's a fine ship.

248
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,688
Yes.

249
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,151
She is a fine ship.
She's ready to sail.

250
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,986
We've yet to give her a name.

251
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,282
I’ll call her the Argo,
after her builder.

252
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,702
The Argo?

253
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,706
Well, you'd better have a look
at the figurehead.

254
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,627
It might make you change your mind.
No, this way.

255
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,421
-Is it forward?
-No, it's astern.

256
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,881
We'll have to move it.

257
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,759
It's supposed to watch over
the water ahead of the vessel.

258
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:34,889
I can't help that.
Something made me put it here.

259
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,523
Hera, queen of the gods.

260
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,985
-What?
-Nothing.

261
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,028
You don't object to it here?

262
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,074
-No.
-Nor do I.

263
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:57,620
It makes me feel someone friendly
is watching over us.

264
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,625
-When do we sail?
-Tomorrow.

265
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,387
Don't waste it.

266
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,265
There isn't enough left
to make any difference, Jason.

267
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,100
Oh, let him rest.

268
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,561
But the sooner we find some island
with water, the better.

269
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,273
We can't row much longer
on three sips a day.

270
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,234
Take my advice. Put back to Icos.

271
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,569
But we'd lose five days' sailing.

272
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,530
We haven't water enough
for tomorrow...

273
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,991
...let alone the time it would take
to reach Icos.

274
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,911
Don't worry, Hylas.
I don't expect him to take my advice.

275
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,539
But I wish he'd listen to someone.

276
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,176
Still grumbling?

277
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,680
Sailors always grumble.

278
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,474
These sailors have something
to grumble about.

279
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,935
Hardly any water. Blistered hands.

280
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,438
-They should use brine.
-Brine?

281
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,481
It toughens the skin.

282
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,568
Well, go down and treat them.
I’ll steer.

283
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,245
Hera.

284
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,500
You said you could help me
a certain number of times.

285
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,586
So far, you've told me of Colchis.

286
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,923
And I threw Pelias from his horse
and dragged him beneath the water.

287
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,675
Pelias?

288
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,387
So that was King Pelias.

289
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,849
I know your need.
Set sail and steer north.

290
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,268
-You will reach land at noon.
-Where?

291
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,103
The Isle of Bronze.

292
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,481
I’ve never heard of it.

293
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,650
No mortal has.
It was the foundry of the gods.

294
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,404
Hephaestus labored there,
making armor and weapons for Zeus.

295
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:22,617
Oh, do not fear. Hephaestus himseIf
has long departed.

296
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,453
I will see that you reach
the Isle of Bronze.

297
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,790
But listen to me, Jason.
Listen very carefully.

298
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,261
-Take the helm.
-Yes, sir.

299
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,056
Set sail.

300
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,775
We reach land at noon.

301
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:59,362
Then you can fill your bellies until they
grumble as much as your tongues.

302
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,655
Now, mark this.

303
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,449
It will be safe to take
food and water.

304
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:07,995
But nothing else.
Absolutely nothing else.

305
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,706
That doesn't include women?

306
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,292
If there are any on the island,
yes, it does.

307
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,796
If I meet a girl with a firm leg,
a full bosom and a warm heart...

308
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,465
...let no man try and stop me.

309
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,260
-Talos will.
-Who's Talos?

310
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,971
You do mean there's a man there
who wants a fight?

311
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,472
I spoke of no man.

312
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,351
Food and water, Hercules.
That's all.

313
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,939
Jason, who told you of this island?

314
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,526
The goddess Hera.

315
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,308
Port helm.

316
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,603
Steady as you go.

317
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,355
Furl the sail.

318
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,386
Ashore for food and water.

319
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,693
-Are goats good sailors?
-Goats? What are you talking about?

320
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,029
What do you want with goats
onboard ship?

321
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,949
Well, some of us might be hungry...

322
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,159
...or thirsty.

323
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,703
Come on.

324
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,172
Here's one for the pot.

325
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,057
Hercules.

326
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,621
Isn't he one of the Titans?

327
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,499
He might be. He's big enough.

328
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:06,173
Didn't Jason say something
about Talos?

329
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,770
This must be where Hephaestus
molded the statues of the gods.

330
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:24,692
Yes. And set them up
for all the world to see.

331
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,962
Hercules.

332
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,127
It's a treasure chamber.

333
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,673
The treasure chamber of the gods.

334
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,762
Look at this.

335
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,972
And this.

336
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,766
A pearl.

337
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,267
It's a javelin.

338
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,270
Don't be silly. ln a jewel box?

339
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,690
It's a brooch pin.

340
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,776
Well, whatever it is,
it'll make a useful weapon.

341
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,403
Let's get back to the ship.

342
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,781
-Hercules.
-Well, what is it?

343
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,200
-You'd better put it back.
-Why?

344
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,788
-Remember what Jason said?
-It won't be missed.

345
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,126
Anyway, if the gods leave all this
lying about unguarded...

346
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,087
...they obviously don't want it.
Come on.

347
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,512
It must have been the wind.

348
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,856
And you saw nothing of them
after that?

349
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,984
Perhaps Hercules found a woman
after all.

350
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,079
Talos.

351
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,696
-Back water.
-Back. Back water.

352
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,323
Back.

353
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:43,297
I warned you, Jason.
This is Hercules' doing.

354
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,467
Talos will try to kill all of you.

355
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,676
How can I fight him?

356
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,763
Think before you waste
the gift of the gods.

357
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,557
Against a man of bronze,
our weapons are useless.

358
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,225
I repeat that question.

359
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,977
Then I must answer it.

360
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,981
Fight Talos with your wits
rather than your courage.

361
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,358
And look to his ankles.

362
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,735
His ankles?

363
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,322
There is nothing else I can tell you.

364
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,746
Jason.

365
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,832
You disobeyed my order.

366
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,557
Lure him to these rocks,
but stay out of reach.

367
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,017
-And what will you do?
-I shall hide here, Acastus.

368
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,521
I shall do my very best
to send him to you, Jason.

369
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,022
My very best.

370
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,226
Mind his foot!

371
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,629
Quick, get back to the rocks.

372
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,388
Hylas.

373
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,478
Hercules, you've left your--

374
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,973
-Well?
-We searched, Argos.

375
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:10,225
And I will search again.

376
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:14,062
Hylas was with us.
We saw him running.

377
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,023
But then he disappeared.

378
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,485
He could've been hurt,
not able to get back to the ship.

379
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:24,114
Like Palinuros.
We had to carry him aboard.

380
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,993
Hercules, Hylas is dead.

381
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,497
The gods decided it.

382
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,169
Why kill a boy for my grave fault?

383
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,548
But I should have stayed with him.

384
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:45,469
Search until nightfall.
We won't sail till then.

385
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,188
Sail when you please, Jason.

386
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,733
I cannot leave this island
till I’ve found Hylas.

387
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,587
Jason.

388
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:24,508
Will you abandon Hercules,
the best man among us?

389
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,136
-I, for one, won't sail without him.
-Nor shall I.

390
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,555
Nor I.

391
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:32,933
Come with me.

392
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,269
Hylas!

393
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,407
Is there any man here
who does not obey the gods?

394
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:56,581
We will do as the goddess Hera
commands, if she will speak to us.

395
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,296
This is your last chance, Jason.

396
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,472
The last time that I can help you.

397
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,099
I understand.

398
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,893
Then know this, Argonauts.

399
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,437
-Hylas is dead.
-Hylas is dead.

400
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:23,316
As for Hercules, he is not fated
to go further with the Argo.

401
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,485
Zeus has other tasks for him.

402
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,029
And for us, Hera?

403
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:32,325
Sail to Phrygia.
Seek out Phineas, the blinded man.

404
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,786
Only he can guide you now.

405
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,000
We set sail.

406
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,173
Come on, back to your places.

407
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,847
Back to your places.
Get forward there.

408
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,860
Go away!

409
00:50:33,406 --> 00:51:13,987
Devils! Demons!

410
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,562
Lord Zeus, I was a sinner.

411
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,940
I’ve never tried to deny it.

412
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,527
But I didn't sin every day.

413
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,865
Why, then,
do you punish me every day?

414
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:20,428
What in the name of the gods
are they?

415
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,489
Jason.

416
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,625
-Are you Phineas?
-Yes.

417
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,961
Take my arm. I can't see yours.

418
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,921
Don't flinch.

419
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:01,928
Zeus gave me the gift of prophecy,
but I misused it...

420
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,222
...so I was blinded.

421
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,767
Zeus ordered the Harpies
to torment me.

422
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:12,105
You, Jason, now listen to me.

423
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:16,651
The gods have ordered me to tell you
whatever you want to know.

424
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,946
But the gods have gone
too far with me.

425
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:24,951
They can punish a man so much,
and then one day he abandons them.

426
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,870
He says, "All right, Zeus.

427
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,790
Throw a thunderbolt.
Let the earth swallow me.

428
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,041
I defy you."

429
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,715
You growl away all you like, Zeus.

430
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:42,135
I mean what I say. Jason.

431
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:44,679
I’ll tell you
what you want to know...

432
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,348
...only if you'll meet my price.

433
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,267
What is your price then?

434
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,853
Free me from these
tormenting Harpies.

435
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:54,188
If Zeus sent those creatures
to plague him...

436
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,232
...we'd be unwise to interfere.

437
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,568
That's my price.

438
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,820
Then we'll meet it, Phineas.

439
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,698
We'll make you
the master of the Harpies.

440
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,804
Get to the ropes!

441
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:42,774
Now.

442
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,251
Castor. Phalerus.

443
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,337
Find some wood to build a cage.

444
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,932
Here you are, you hungry fellow.

445
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,102
A big fish for you
and some more wine.

446
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:25,817
Well, Phineas, we've completed
our part of the bargain.

447
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,528
-What is it you want to know?
-The way to Colchis.

448
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:32,073
The way to Colchis
is through the Clashing Rocks.

449
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:34,909
Steer northwest
and you'll reach them in five days.

450
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,119
Northwest, eh?

451
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,247
After the Clashing Rocks,
you turn northeast.

452
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,250
Before long, you'll sight
the shores of Colchis.

453
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,877
But tell me, what gods protect you?

454
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,296
None now.

455
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,550
Then you won't pass
the Clashing Rocks.

456
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:54,720
-What are the Clashing Rocks?
-They speak for themselves, don't they?

457
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,516
All I can offer you is this.

458
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,519
It's not much reward
for what you've done...

459
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,896
...but it's all I have.

460
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:11,112
If that's all you can tell us,
then goodbye.

461
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,407
The gods be merciful to you.

462
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:28,671
Phineas, from now on, they'll witness
a banquet every night...

463
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,257
...and eat the scraps you leave.

464
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,721
Good appetite.

465
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:15,509
There's not much water here.

466
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:45,873
Steady as you go. Row easy.

467
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,341
Easy, all.

468
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,551
Easy, all!

469
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,711
It's a narrow channel...

470
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,338
...but I can't see what
made Phineas so frightened.

471
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,382
It looks calm enough.

472
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:38,384
Too calm.

473
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,636
Acastus!

474
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,185
I know the sea god's moods.

475
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,731
But most of them are dangerous.

476
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,567
Acastus, take a sounding.

477
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:58,404
The rest of you, be prepared to row
when I give the word.

478
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:02,366
But an easy stroke.
Save your strength.

479
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,454
They may need it later.

480
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:15,838
Ship ahoy!

481
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,966
There she is.

482
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,178
She doesn't seem to be
in any great difficulty.

483
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,090
A whole ship's crew.

484
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,717
And Lynceus from the masthead.

485
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:28,679
There was no hope of saving him,
not in that sea.

486
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,223
Are we going through?

487
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:36,145
-Yes.
-But it's--

488
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:39,815
All right, we're going through.

489
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,109
Back to your places.

490
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:49,408
There's no turning back now.

491
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,118
No, Acastus.

492
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,287
There's no turning back
on this voyage.

493
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:56,290
Drummer, beat out the stroke...

494
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,460
...but keep it easy.

495
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,756
The gods want their entertainment.

496
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,717
Jason goes too far.

497
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:11,138
Because he speaks the truth
when the gods themselves go too far?

498
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:01,230
Turn back, Jason. We're trapped.

499
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:05,401
-Trapped, Hera.
-It seems so.

500
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:09,321
You've left me only one move.

501
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,291
Pray to the gods, Jason.

502
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,251
The gods of Greece are cruel.

503
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,840
In time, all men
shall learn to do without them.

504
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,119
Pull! Pull!

505
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,122
Get back to your place.

506
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:00,516
Pull!

507
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:05,187
Pull till your hides crack
and your backs break.

508
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:09,900
Pull!

509
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,901
Keep the stroke going.

510
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:17,259
Jason dared to speak
of the end of the gods...

511
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,178
...and yet you let him live.

512
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:24,600
If I were to punish every blasphemy,
I’d soon lose all loyalty and respect.

513
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,852
You are the god of many men.

514
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,188
Yet when those men
no longer believe in you...

515
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,981
...then you'll return to nothing.

516
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:35,486
You understand that,
and yet you remain with me.

517
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,113
You think it weak of me, my lord?

518
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,365
Not weak.

519
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,701
Almost human.

520
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,720
Whichever god or goddess
helped us...

521
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,514
...is to be thanked.

522
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,766
Those others weren't so fortunate.

523
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:08,101
What's that?

524
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:51,103
Who are you?

525
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:52,771
Your ship was lost.

526
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,899
We found only two other survivors.
They're being looked after.

527
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,318
Here. Drink this.

528
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,323
When did you sail from Colchis?

529
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:05,534
Dawn, this morning.

530
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,369
Dawn?

531
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:10,497
Then our journey is nearly over.

532
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:13,208
-Where have you come from?
-Thessaly.

533
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,544
But that's the other side
of the world.

534
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,298
You don't look like a merchant.

535
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,968
Your vessel's a fighting ship.

536
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,137
We'd be foolish to sail unarmed.

537
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:30,100
By all accounts, your king, Aeetes,
fears the gods...

538
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,811
...and we were sent by the gods.

539
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,606
But I’m gonna talk to him alone,
peacefully.

540
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:37,566
Now you answer a question.

541
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:40,110
What was your ship doing
in such dangerous waters?

542
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:43,488
We came to sacrifice
to the gods of the rocks...

543
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,700
...to throw flowers onto the sea
to make it safe for our ships.

544
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:51,496
I’m afraid our gods were angry,
not so powerful as yours.

545
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,915
Are you a priestess?

546
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,251
I serve in the temple of Hecate.

547
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:58,503
A dancer.

548
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,881
Is Hecate the god of the Colchians?

549
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:02,174
The goddess.

550
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:05,010
But I’d heard they worship
some strange idol...

551
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:06,803
...the skull and skin of a ram.

552
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,347
No ordinary ram.

553
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:12,059
Its fleece is of gold.
A gift of the gods themselves...

554
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:15,479
...and it's brought our city
great peace and prosperity.

555
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:18,357
We'll put you ashore
at dawn tomorrow.

556
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,401
Perhaps you will show me
the way to the city.

557
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:24,404
Now, tell me your name.

558
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:26,323
Medea.

559
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,742
And you can answer
my first question.

560
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,578
-Who are you?
-My name is Jason.

561
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,383
Within a few hours,
we shall sight Colchis.

562
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,760
I’m coming in quietly by night.

563
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:49,680
Now the voyage is over,
I don't want the trouble to begin.

564
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,765
Won't be any trouble, Jason.

565
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,518
Just tell us where the city is
and when we attack.

566
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,353
We don't attack.

567
01:11:56,521 --> 01:12:00,065
But that's foolish. You have
the finest fighting men in the world.

568
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,025
Forty fighting men against a nation?

569
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:03,944
Better 40 than one, Jason.

570
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:05,654
We're not pirates, Phalerus.

571
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,949
What's that girl done to you?
We thought you were a fighting man.

572
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,869
I’m going up alone in the morning
to see what the situation is.

573
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:17,082
Oh, you mean spy out the land.
Well, why alone?

574
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,001
Why not take a few of us scouting?

575
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,254
The fewer who go,
the less can get caught.

576
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:25,048
-What's the fewest you can think of?
-One, of course.

577
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:27,050
Right. I accept your advice.

578
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,760
But I don't.

579
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,930
Having sailed this far together,
we're free to speak our minds.

580
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:34,057
And what's on yours, Acastus?

581
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:37,144
We nose our way upstream,
rush the guards and seize the fleece.

582
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:40,397
We'd be out into the open sea
while Aeetes is still asleep.

583
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:42,357
-A night attack?
-Yes.

584
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,777
And in the dark, during the attack,
a man will die.

585
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,029
That man will be me.

586
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,905
A javelin in my back.

587
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,950
A Greek javelin, Acastus.
Maybe your javelin.

588
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,703
-You'll die for that, Jason.
-Keep back.

589
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,948
Euphemus.

590
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:37,556
It's Euphemus. He's dead.

591
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:45,147
Look at this. Slashed and bloody.

592
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,733
Acastus must be
at the bottom of the sea.

593
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,443
I wonder.

594
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,363
-Make sail.
-And Euphemus?

595
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:56,283
The sea was his kingdom
while he was alive.

596
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,201
Let it take his body now he's dead.

597
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,412
Make sail.

598
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:02,956
Make sail!

599
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,255
You're wounded.

600
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:15,093
We have a flower in Colchis
which heals and soothes.

601
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:17,220
Tomorrow, I’ll show you.

602
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,690
What do you call the flower?

603
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,610
It has no name.
It grows on a double stalk.

604
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:34,446
They say it sprang
from the blood of Prometheus.

605
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:39,367
And it has been used over the years
for its soothing and curing powers.

606
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:44,456
The sun's getting higher.
We must be on our way.

607
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:46,291
Follow the road to the east.

608
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,126
You're not coming further?

609
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:50,462
I go another way.

610
01:18:36,504 --> 01:18:40,090
The goddess Hecate has spoken.

611
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:44,302
There will be one among us today...

612
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,639
...from the ends of the world.

613
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,725
His name is Jason.

614
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:54,396
Any man of whom he asks his way...

615
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,730
...shall say this:

616
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:59,317
"Aeetes, king of Colchis...

617
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:02,487
...awaits him
in the temple of Hecate."

618
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:07,534
And that is all
any man shall say to him.

619
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,207
Come forward, Jason.

620
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:33,143
You have done all of us
a great service.

621
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:34,936
Tonight, we shall feast you.

622
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:39,107
We know of your great heroism,
and it deserves celebration.

623
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:42,277
Return, then, to your companions
and bring them to my palace.

624
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,446
I thank you, my lord...

625
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,282
...but I do not understand.

626
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,205
-Medea?
-Welcome to Colchis.

627
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:20,023
I give you Jason and the Argonauts.

628
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:23,067
Jason and the Argonauts!

629
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,326
Tell me, Jason,
why did you come to Colchis?

630
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,870
In peace.

631
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,915
I said "why," not "how."

632
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,876
Altogether,
how many men have you?

633
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,503
Enough.

634
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,088
And you say you do not
threaten us?

635
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:47,258
Envoys who come to me in deceit
remain in death.

636
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:51,054
I know you've come for the fleece.

637
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:54,682
I know, too, that if you cannot win it
by bargaining, you plan to steal it.

638
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,435
But we'll never part with it, Jason.

639
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:00,104
It is a gift of the gods.

640
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:02,565
It has brought wealth and peace
to Colchis.

641
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:05,568
Should we ever let it go,
it would mean plague and famine...

642
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:07,445
...and the destruction
of our country!

643
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:10,448
We can no longer welcome
or entertain you...

644
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,450
...but treat you as you deserve.

645
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:14,577
As thieves...

646
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,913
...as pirates...

647
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:20,333
...as murderers.

648
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:29,133
We give our thanks to one person.

649
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:34,722
The person who exposed
a criminal attempt on our kingdom:

650
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:39,644
The son of King Pelias
of Thessaly...

651
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,938
...Acastus.

652
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,150
Hail!

653
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:15,847
Hecate, queen of darkness...

654
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,890
...you've always helped me.

655
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,476
Tell me now what I must do.

656
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:25,189
You, who gave me
the gift of foresight...

657
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:28,860
...why didn't you reveal to me
Acastus' treachery?

658
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:32,864
He who sits drinking with Aeetes...

659
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,158
...while Jason...

660
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:39,704
...imprisoned, condemned to death.

661
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:43,958
If I help him now
in the quest for the fleece...

662
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:48,546
... I shall be a traitor to my country...

663
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:52,175
...and to you, Hecate.

664
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:57,305
And if not...

665
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:01,517
...to myself.

666
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,899
Help me, Hecate.

667
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,269
Medea.

668
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,439
Why did you come here?
Was it Aeetes who sent you?

669
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,733
I came to ask you
to give up your quest...

670
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,736
...and sail away
with the Argonauts in peace.

671
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:55,655
Never return.

672
01:23:55,823 --> 01:23:57,573
Never to think
of the Golden Fleece?

673
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,283
Never to think of the fleece.

674
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,077
Then it was Aeetes.

675
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:04,622
You tell him I will fulfill the task
the gods have sent me...

676
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:08,668
...and never betray the Argonauts,
whatever he offers me.

677
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,463
Even if it's Medea,
high priestess of Hecate.

678
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:13,715
Please...

679
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:19,637
...forget the Golden Fleece.
I fear for your safety.

680
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,809
If you're set on carrying it away...

681
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,478
... I must come with you.

682
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:30,064
I’ll go alone.

683
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:32,817
No.

684
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:36,696
I have to go with you.
I have no country now.

685
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,658
And I love you.

686
01:24:57,634 --> 01:25:00,720
Castor, Phalerus, Dmitrius,
get to the door.

687
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:03,347
The rest of you,
back to your places.

688
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:10,855
-The priestess.
-Argos, listen to Medea.

689
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:14,066
When you're clear of the palace,
go to the ship and row downstream.

690
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:16,944
There's a break in the cliff
and a path through the woods.

691
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,655
Anchor there. We'll join you.

692
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:39,258
Well, what is it?

693
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:42,261
-Jason has escaped.
-And his men?

694
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:45,890
They were all gone. I was making
my rounds, found the guards drugged.

695
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:49,268
Drugged?
Then there's an accomplice.

696
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:52,230
-Where's Acastus?
-He's not in his quarters.

697
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:55,274
Acastus help Jason?

698
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:58,069
But there's no reason to it.

699
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:01,906
Unless it was Medea
who mixed the drug.

700
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,908
The high priestess of Hecate?

701
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:07,078
I saw how Medea looked at Jason.

702
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:12,583
If Medea's helping them, then she's
guiding them to the Golden Fleece...

703
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:15,253
...and the Argonauts will take ship.

704
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,129
The landward way is shorter.

705
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,924
Muster your men, captain.

706
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,128
Listen.

707
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:01,132
Soldiers.

708
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:04,302
Phalerus, Castor,
you come with me.

709
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,262
-No, not you, Polydeuces.
-But, Argos--

710
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,473
You stay aboard with the rest
of the men and guard the ship.

711
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:10,506
Jason.

712
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,719
Aeetes and the Colchians.

713
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:19,348
We heard them from the ship.
They must be somewhere near.

714
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,936
Get the fleece.

715
01:32:21,995 --> 01:32:24,121
Guards, follow them up there
and that way.

716
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,918
Wait.

717
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,723
Hecate, queen of darkness...

718
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:45,851
...revenge yourseIf
against the Thessalians.

719
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:49,313
Deliver to me the children
of the Hydra's teeth...

720
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:51,482
...the children of the night.

721
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:41,573
The teeth.
Fetch me the Hydra's teeth, quickly.

722
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:09,893
Against the children
of the Hydra's teeth...

723
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,855
...there is no protection.

724
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:08,285
The fleece. Give me the fleece.

725
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:11,997
It has the power to heal.

726
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:44,154
It's true.
It does have the power to heal.

727
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:08,929
Jason!

728
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:13,767
Hold the guards back, captain,
or they may die...

729
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:15,811
...killed with Jason and his pirates.

730
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:42,379
Rise up, you dead,
slain of the Hydra.

731
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:47,092
Rise from your graves
and avenge us.

732
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:52,055
Those who steal the Golden Fleece
must die.

733
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:28,050
Argos, get down to the ship.

734
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:30,677
-Take Medea.
-Come with me.

735
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:49,947
There.

736
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:58,664
And there.

737
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:05,712
And still another.

738
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:09,466
Wait.

739
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:15,264
And more.

740
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,666
Destroy them!

741
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:47,170
Kill!

742
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:51,300
Kill, kill, kill them all!

743
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:58,075
Get back.

744
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:45,492
I think that proves at last
that I’m a worthy opponent, my lord.

745
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:46,827
Where are you going?

746
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:50,747
-To clear the board. The game is over.
-It certainly is not.

747
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:04,761
For the moment
let them enjoy a calm sea...

748
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:07,514
...a fresh breeze and each other.

749
01:43:07,682 --> 01:43:11,184
The girl is pretty,
and I was always sentimental.

750
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:16,690
But for Jason
there are other adventures.

751
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:18,817
I have not yet finished with Jason.

752
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:24,281
Let us continue the game
another day.
