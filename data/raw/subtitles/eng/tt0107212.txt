22
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,828
Profession.

23
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:42,659
Lawyer.

24
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:50,664
I'm tired, too. Let's help each other out, okay?

25
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,867
It's true. He's really a lawyer.

26
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:57,145
You assholes... Listen!

27
00:02:57,313 --> 00:03:02,410
Is your living room, huh? Who are you kidding?

28
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:11,657
Oh, still hard at work...

29
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:18,334
The Gyu-sik Hwang case has been dropped.

30
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:23,268
-What was that all about?
-The bastard perjured himself.

31
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,599
Well, there's an endless list
of bastards we'd like to beat up.

32
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:33,648
But did you go to beat him up?
You look terrible.

33
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:47,795
Here's the case summary for CEO Choi
of the Taejin Group. Courthouse 514.

34
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:50,930
-Hey, did you eat yet?
-Yes.

35
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:56,238
This is the Ji-man Lee, biker case.
Courthouse 302.

36
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:57,373
And the settlement?

37
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,973
He's bringing it over today.

38
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:02,807
-lf we've got everything, shall we go?
-Sure.

39
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:07,005
Defendant, please stand.
Do you have anything to say?

40
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,112
I'm deeply remorseful for my crime.

41
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,155
Forgive me this once. I won't do
things like this again and work hard.

42
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:22,890
Sentencing will be in 3 weeks,
on Sept. 22nd at 2 PM. Next.

43
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,595
Case no. 3215.

44
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,902
Case no. 3215, defendant ll-man Choi,
not in custody.

45
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,340
Defendant ll-man Choi.

46
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:44,652
Where is your client?

47
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:49,349
Well...he's not here yet.

48
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:53,856
-What do you want to do?
-We'll postpone.

49
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,160
Next court date in three weeks.
Sept. 22nd, 3 PM. Next.

50
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:01,098
Case no. 1817.

51
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:08,207
Lawyer Seo.

52
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:12,875
I told you before, those sneakers...

53
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:18,717
It's not a big problem but
considering it's a courtroom...

54
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:23,951
Let's pay attention to our attire.

55
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:30,621
What time is it now? Didn't I tell you
to wear your school uniform?

56
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,234
Why are you hitting me? I'm not the one.

57
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:34,927
You're not?

58
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:40,365
You all look the same to me.
Can't tell one brat from another.

59
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:41,703
And the settlement?

60
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:42,970
Here.

61
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:48,211
But do I really have to wear this?

62
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,286
What are you good for?

63
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:55,090
You have to look decent for the judge
at least. Get changed and go in.

64
00:05:58,194 --> 00:06:00,094
I've got damn egg on my face.

65
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:03,054
He should've had his secretary
call at least.

66
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,968
What the hell is this?
You can't even make sure the client shows up.

67
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,635
-Hey? Aren't you coming?
-I have one more case.

68
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,903
Another court-appointed one?

69
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:26,916
Last spring, you entered
a model airplane contest and won the bronze.

70
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,117
You also entered a writing contest
and your book review almost won.

71
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:35,390
But since it was an erotic novel,
you were disqualified.

72
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:39,558
-People felt bad, correct?
-Yes.

73
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:42,534
You didn't plan on stealing
the motorcycle.

74
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:46,141
You just wanted to ride it
and then return it, correct?

75
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:48,344
Yes.

76
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:53,574
You're very sorry about this
and can swear never to speed again, correct?

77
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,149
Now answer in a loud voice.

78
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,877
-Yes!
-Nothing further.

79
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:02,349
This is a settlement the victim
agreed upon on Aug. 31st.

80
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:06,357
Defendant, please stand.

81
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,720
Do you have anything to say?

82
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:17,001
First, I'm very sorry to have
caused trouble in this quiet society.

83
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:21,302
I'll live quietly from now on.

84
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:27,216
Sentencing will be held on
Sept. 27th, at 10 AM. Next.

85
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:33,312
Defendant, wait. You're suspended
right now, aren't you?

86
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:35,981
Yes.

87
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,423
Do you always wear
your school uniform?

88
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:39,827
No-no...

89
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:42,829
Then who told you to wear it?

90
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:46,829
I just...wore it.

91
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,465
Do you know that lying
before the court is perjury?

92
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:55,638
Uh...um, my lawyer told me to.

93
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:05,020
When did I tell him
to wear his school uniform?

94
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,716
As long as we win,
why does it matter?

95
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:15,388
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
a court-appointed case came in last night.

96
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:18,500
It's in the same case batch as the
Taejin Group so that must be why.

97
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:19,726
What's the case?

98
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:22,302
An appeal for a murder case.

99
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,038
It got the death penalty.

100
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:27,738
Might not be a bad idea to skip this
one. Plus, it's an open-n-shut case.

101
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:30,109
Present!

102
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:44,453
What? You call them students?

103
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:47,125
You saw him in his school uniform.

104
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:51,656
That was like a sausage
stuffed with pasta.

105
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:57,864
Wow, for a court-appointed case,
the reward's pretty good.

106
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:14,613
I'm Shin-young Lee's court
appointed lawyer for her appeal.

107
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,280
Lawyer visiting.

108
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:47,219
She won't see you.

109
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:49,122
Excuse me?

110
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:53,888
-2234, she refuses visitation.
-What's the reason?

111
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:58,261
No clue. She probably won't
see you in the future.

112
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,226
The first lawyer couldn't
meet with her either.

113
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,672
-You have a witness today?
-ln-suk Hong. -ln-suk Hong?

114
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:10,812
-Whose bag is this?
-Lawyer Kang's.

115
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,178
So he got his clerk to bring it over.
He speaks slow but acts fast.

116
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:17,714
Got be quick in one way if you want to eat.

117
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:42,735
Case no. 1627.

118
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:45,472
Case no. 1627, Defendant Shin-young Lee.

119
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,937
Prosecution, begin your case.

120
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:22,877
On Feb. 6, 2000, the defendant
injected her husband, Jong-hoon Sung,

121
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:25,919
with drugs to render him helpless.

122
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:30,556
With a scalpel, the murder weapon,
she cut him in 4 places,

123
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:32,591
hitting arteries and veins.

124
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:37,199
Arrested on the scene,
the court sentenced her to death on June 13th.

125
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:39,526
Proceed.

126
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:46,631
Her prints on the murder weapon,
the diazepam found in the victim's body,

127
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:47,998
no evidence of intrusion,

128
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:49,804
and pre-meditation,

129
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:53,380
The scientific evidence is clear.

130
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:57,516
Given that the defendant remained
silent throughout the investigation

131
00:11:57,687 --> 00:12:02,215
and the first trial,
I have no further questions.

132
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:05,558
Defense, cross examination.

133
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:18,034
You stood before this court on Feb.
6th for the murder of Jong-hoon Sung,

134
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,765
correct?

135
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:31,947
First, about the pre-meditation
the prosecution is claiming...

136
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:33,554
Your honor...

137
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:42,961
I don't want...this trial.

138
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:48,901
-I want it to stop.
-Defendant!

139
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,974
You don't have the right
to refuse this trial.

140
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,440
-Why not?
-Shin-young Lee.

141
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:59,706
Stop...this trial.

142
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,775
Shin-young Lee.

143
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,849
-I request a postponement.
-I said, enough!

144
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:07,682
We'll take a short recess.

145
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,755
I'll see both councils in my chambers.

146
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:15,055
I never asked for another trial.
Just give me the death penalty.

147
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:18,291
Let me go! Let go!
Let me just die.

148
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:22,335
Why are you doing this to me? Let go!

149
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:34,177
Han-soo, take a picture of the tub.

150
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,580
Careful, careful...

151
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,447
And the murder weapon?

152
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:41,089
A scalpel was found on the bathroom floor.

153
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:45,159
Now, you remember where
you cut him first, right?

154
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:47,659
Do it just the way you did it.

155
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,296
-Shin-young Lee cannot see anyone.
-Excuse me?

156
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:01,307
She's been put into solitary.

157
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:07,171
-When will she get out?
-I don't know.

158
00:14:20,796 --> 00:14:23,959
Where are you two going, stuck
gether like a pair of socks?

159
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,535
The verdict for Lawyer Choi's
first case is in.

160
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,928
So you're going to the courthouse?

161
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:31,470
Yes.

162
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,540
No, no, no. A lawyer should
never go for the verdict.

163
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:37,306
What do you mean?

164
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:40,243
There's nothing for a lawyer to do.

165
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,178
Also, if you lose, they'll hang you
by your collar.

166
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,344
And they'll tear you apart,
asking for their money back.

167
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:51,523
Even so, isn't it our duty to explain
the verdict to our client?

168
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:54,219
I'm not telling you this for nothing.

169
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:56,795
I'll see you later.

170
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:02,232
This is the research application
I told you about.

171
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,003
You've made the right choice.

172
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:09,534
Wrap up the Taejin case real nice,
study abroad for about two years...

173
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:12,373
Man, I might end up working for you!

174
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:15,415
-When do I leave?
-ln November.

175
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:18,914
You have about a month or two.
I'd start getting ready.

176
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:20,785
Hello? Joon-ha Seo.

177
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,616
She's claustrophobic.

178
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:27,019
We found her during the morning round.
She's been moved to the hospital.

179
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:52,445
Is Shin-young Lee...

180
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:57,385
What are you doing?

181
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,320
-Let go! Let me go!
-Call the doctor, quick!

182
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:02,655
-Let go!
-Why are you doing this!

183
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:16,401
I wanna die...really...

184
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:19,612
-Excuse me.
-Please wait outside.

185
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:52,669
Oh, they must've been beaten bad.

186
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:05,152
Did you...go with them?

187
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:17,362
How strange...

188
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:21,304
All she needs to do is to wait.
And they'll kill her anyway.

189
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:23,536
What's her big rush?

190
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:31,016
Some people would stick to a lawyer's shadow
like a magnet to bail them out.

191
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,415
She barely has a chance even if she did that.

192
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,421
You know what?

193
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:54,000
"l want to die..." sounds more
desperate than "l want to live..."

194
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:01,648
This is the hotel where
CEO Choi is. Go see him.

195
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,453
Everyone has a secret or two
in their closet.

196
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:19,658
He's not the nicest guy but you know...

197
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,798
The paperwork looks good.

198
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:33,545
It should. When you get to my age,
you pretty much have life figured out.

199
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:37,084
Law...it's a funny thing.

200
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:40,653
The punishment fits the crime? No.

201
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,889
You get as much as
the laws you've broken.

202
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:49,720
What are you going to do about
the unpaid wages?

203
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:52,492
Dogs can't help but chase after cats.

204
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:55,927
When a company goes bankrupt, it is
the labor unions that bark for money.

205
00:18:56,105 --> 00:19:00,337
They're all the same.

206
00:19:01,877 --> 00:19:02,901
Is that so?

207
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,514
Don't be rash. Sit!

208
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:21,520
There. Let's talk it over.

209
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,525
There are three types of people
in this world.

210
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:30,729
Those who make money like madmen
and spend graciously.

211
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:33,966
Those who make money like madmen
and spend like the dogs they are.

212
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,011
And there are those who make money
like madmen but spend like bastards.

213
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,671
Like you, you bastard.

214
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,409
What happened?

215
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:47,219
CEO Choi gave us the boot.

216
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:49,021
Why?

217
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,056
Lawyer Seo must've thrown a fit.

218
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:55,560
You have proof? Show me the holes
and I'll drop him!

219
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:56,993
That's not what I'm talking about!

220
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:01,993
Give me a name of someone who pays
that much and isn't a thief!

221
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,863
Apologize and then leave the case!

222
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:40,933
What's with the look?

223
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:47,105
What's really up with you?
What if this affects your research candidacy?

224
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,183
Lie low this once and do the case.

225
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:00,686
lt could've done wonders for your career.

226
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:51,865
Who're you?

227
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,477
I'm Joon-ha Seo,
lawyer for the Shin-young Lee case.

228
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:03,683
Was it 3 years ago she came last...

229
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:06,717
Since then, I never called.

230
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:11,884
When she came that time, her husband
was furious and dragged her away.

231
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:14,260
Excuse me? Dragged?

232
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,928
It was obvious. The scales were
so tipped against her in the marriage.

233
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:22,435
My first just had her baby...

234
00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:24,799
Shin-young's things are still here.

235
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:28,671
Oh, I just fed the little sucker...

236
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:09,974
The victim, Jong-hoon Sung's parents
died in a car accident last fall.

237
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:14,153
Shin-young Lee lost her mother at 12.
She was left all alone.

238
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:20,018
No siblings for both. Until 19,
Lee lived with her aunt in Choonchun.

239
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:24,727
She then worked as a nurse's aid at a
clinic in Choonchun for 3 years.

240
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,300
There, she met her husband.

241
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:30,765
I mean, the deceased husband.

242
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:56,624
Can you uncuff her?

243
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:14,643
Are your wounds alright?

244
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:17,683
I'm fine.

245
00:25:19,855 --> 00:25:21,789
How are you doing?

246
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:27,151
Shall we begin?

247
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:35,701
I...

248
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:56,480
Let me introduce myself. I'm your
court-appointed attorney, Joon-ha Seo.

249
00:25:57,492 --> 00:25:59,790
I never asked for your help.

250
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,727
I'm appointed by the court,
not by your request.

251
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:13,698
And if you don't like me,
you can ask or someone else. Alright?

252
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:25,280
The records say that you stabbed him
in the neck and chest during a fight...

253
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,512
Do I have to repeat this again?

254
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:35,427
I know it's hard but it's the
first time for me.

255
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,468
Was there anything you wanted to say
during the investigation or the trial?

256
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,630
No.

257
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:49,441
Nothing?

258
00:26:52,881 --> 00:26:54,280
Nothing.

259
00:26:56,017 --> 00:27:00,818
-You're satisfied with the verdict?
-Yes.

260
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,728
Fine. Let's say you did it. Even so,
not everyone gets the death penalty.

261
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:18,973
Depending on us, you can avoid death.
Even drop your sentence to 15 years.

262
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,732
I don't want that.

263
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:26,605
Even if you don't want it right now,
you must accept my help.

264
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:28,976
I never asked for your help.

265
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,381
If we're done, I'll go now.

266
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:42,120
And, thank you for the coffee.

267
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:06,179
After putting on make-up, you changed, correct

268
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,745
I object to the time of murder,
the murder wounds,

269
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,410
and method of murder that
the court accepted at the first trial.

270
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:19,523
-You are a security guard, correct?
-Yes.

271
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:26,358
At the trial, you testified there was
no evidence of outside intruders.

272
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,768
What are your working hours?

273
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,898
Usually from midnight to 8 AM.

274
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,770
And on the day of the murder?

275
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:41,444
When discovered, did the defendant
ask for your help?

276
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:42,776
No.

277
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:48,583
If an intruder killed her husband,
wouldn't she ask for your help?

278
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:52,056
-Objection! Asks for speculation.
-Nothing further.

279
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:56,720
-What is your profession?
-I am a neurosurgeon.

280
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,759
You worked with the deceased, correct?

281
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:01,993
Yes.

282
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:06,672
I asked you to re-examine
the autopsy reports.

283
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:12,035
There were four cuts on the body,
including arteries and veins.

284
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:16,716
-Any special characteristics?
-All four cuts were at vital points.

285
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:22,316
The defendant is weaker than the
victim and had no criminal record.

286
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,958
What are the odds of her finding
and stabbing those places?

287
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:33,662
Well, I'm not a forensic expert but as
a neurosurgeon, it's highly unlikely.

288
00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:36,269
What about a nurse's aid
in general surgery?

289
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:41,402
Probably better than the average.

290
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:47,537
This is a copy of Shin-young Lee's
work record as a nurse's aid.

291
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:53,312
She worked at Gun-min Hospital from
March, 1992 to November, 1995.

292
00:30:53,488 --> 00:31:01,953
Your records say that you sold the
defendant sedatives on Jan. 30th.

293
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,392
Is that correct?

294
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:04,589
Yes.

295
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,700
What kind of sedatives?

296
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:08,628
Diazepam.

297
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:14,066
What happens if one takes
three or four tablets?

298
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:17,200
One would lose consciousness.

299
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:20,279
Becoming completely helpless, correct?

300
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:21,710
Yes.

301
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:24,583
Is it the defendant who bought the sedatives?

302
00:31:25,186 --> 00:31:27,211
Yes.

303
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:33,650
As evidence, I present the defendant's
medical record of an abortion

304
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:36,695
performed on Feb. 4th,
the day before the murder.

305
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,762
This is not a trial on the
private life of the defendant!

306
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:44,302
This is crucial evidence in proving
the defendant's pre-meditation.

307
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,097
Continue.

308
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:52,108
Would she want a baby of
the husband she hated enough to kill?

309
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:59,347
In the cruelest way, she killed the baby
in the day, the husband at night.

310
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:02,683
That is all.

311
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:06,387
Do you have any questions for the defendant?

312
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:12,524
Ms. Shin-young Lee.

313
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:16,937
Lawyer Seo, refer to her as the defendant.

314
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:20,567
Defendant...

315
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,043
Page 235 of the investigation report
states that you killed your husband

316
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:33,586
with a scalpel after drugging him
at your home on Feb. 6th.

317
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:36,289
You then changed your clothes and
put on make-up to run away

318
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:41,520
when you were arrested at the scene.
Is this true?

319
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:47,798
Is this correct?

320
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,676
Please re-examine the police video
of the crime scene.

321
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:02,309
The clothes she wore during
the crime were not found

322
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,246
among the evidence collected
or written in the report.

323
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:06,813
I'll ask you again.

324
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:11,623
You never murdered Jong-hoon Sung.

325
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,229
Answer please, Ms. Shin-young Lee.

326
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:31,138
Objection.

327
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:34,940
The defendant has already admitted
to her crime by remaining silent.

328
00:33:36,017 --> 00:33:43,446
Her absent clothes prove her careful
planning to cover up her crime.

329
00:33:43,624 --> 00:33:48,118
If a corpse disappeared, would you
say that is also a cover-up?

330
00:33:48,296 --> 00:33:52,130
If you've killed someone, would you
hide the corpse or your clothes?

331
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,100
As revealed, the scalpel, diazepam,
and her confession.

332
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:58,928
The court needs no more evidence
to prove her guilt.

333
00:33:59,107 --> 00:34:01,132
Now, now, what is this?

334
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:03,308
Calm down, both of you.

335
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:09,445
Prosecutor. Weren't the seized clothes
the ones she wore during the murder?

336
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:14,711
This case will be adjourned until
two weeks from today. Next.

337
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,483
Case no. 3215.

338
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:19,217
Case no. 3215, ll-man Choi, not in custody.

339
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:23,627
Don't get too excited.
It's only a court-appointed case.

340
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:29,559
Did you kill him?

341
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,767
Did you?

342
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:38,670
Tell me if you did.
Is everything they've said true?

343
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:43,183
What's wrong? Why do you want to die?

344
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,952
Why do you...want to know that?

345
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:53,560
As far as I know, no one kills someone to die.

346
00:34:56,431 --> 00:35:02,961
If I tell you, will you
leave me alone and the trial?

347
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:04,502
No.

348
00:35:05,406 --> 00:35:06,998
I can't do that.

349
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,611
My duty is to do whatever
it takes to save your life.

350
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,906
I want to help you.

351
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:24,020
No one can help me. Not even you.

352
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:26,149
I'll try.

353
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:35,259
To some, just being alive is painful.

354
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:43,272
When you're alive...you remember.

355
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:53,881
You said you'd help me, right?

356
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:59,759
Then...just leave me alone.

357
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:19,612
What's the occasion?
Inviting me to a place like this.

358
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:25,481
I'd like to get you drunk today.

359
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:29,018
You sure you're not the one
who wants to get wasted?

360
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:36,553
How come I've never seen you drunk?

361
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:39,131
I do everything in doses.

362
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,565
I drink, I earn,
I gain weight only so and so much.

363
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:45,095
Not like someone I know.

364
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:54,038
-You must be swamped.
-No.

365
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:57,016
You know what they say.

366
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:00,350
"You bring it on yourself."

367
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:09,925
Let me ask one favor
before I get too drunk.

368
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:17,102
Will you find all of Lee's medical records?

369
00:37:19,173 --> 00:37:21,767
I guess there are no freebies.

370
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:27,978
What?

371
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:33,314
This drink must be too fancy for me.
Is this water or liquor, I'm not sure.

372
00:37:58,379 --> 00:37:59,710
Yes?

373
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,748
Are you up? You need to come.

374
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,419
There is something odd in Shin-young
Lee's medical records.

375
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:14,493
She wasn't just hurt,
it was a miscarriage caused by physical abuse.

376
00:38:15,496 --> 00:38:18,329
-Physical abuse? -Yes.

377
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:24,003
It seems her motive just got stronger.

378
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,372
Congratulations!

379
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,280
Hey, congrats!

380
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:41,317
Mr. Seo. Congratulations.

381
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,255
You don't know yet?
The list for the research candidates is posted.

382
00:38:48,496 --> 00:38:50,225
-Lawyer Seo, congratulations.
-Oh, thank you.

383
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:54,632
"Joon-ha Seo, Yale Law School"

384
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:56,903
Wow, you're finally going.

385
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,496
Congrats.

386
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:05,543
How about some coffee?

387
00:39:08,516 --> 00:39:12,452
Um...can I push the schedule back a little?

388
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:18,920
It's not at our convenience.
Don't make a big deal. Just go.

389
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:25,555
Go for M&A. The firm seems to be
eyeing a take-over or a merger.

390
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:32,606
Try being in my shoes. Keep this up and
it'll be hard for me to keep you on.

391
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:35,637
Ambition, justice, that's all good.

392
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:41,849
Believing truth and justice always go
hand in hand is a noble but silly idea.

393
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:44,242
The law doesn't always reveal the truth.

394
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:51,250
If you can't reveal the truth in
front of the law, it's all an excuse.

395
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:57,831
The orientation for research candidates
is in two days. Be realistic.

396
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:06,033
I just came by.

397
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:12,876
I didn't come to ask you anything
so don't worry.

398
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:20,784
Actually...

399
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:34,092
I don't know why I'm here myself
but I had nowhere else to go.

400
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:42,766
I must seem crazy, huh?

401
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:51,478
So this is how you do it.

402
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:06,058
Do you...always wear sneakers?

403
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:07,666
Why?

404
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:11,163
I saw you wearing them
in the courtroom, too.

405
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:13,103
You did?

406
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:18,070
-My father.
-Your father?

407
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:22,046
My father was a farmer all his life.

408
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,712
When he heard I became a lawyer,
he brought me a new pair of sneakers.

409
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:29,846
So I asked him why.

410
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:33,425
He said a lawyer is a person
who listens to the less fortunate.

411
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:38,759
So since the world is full of them,
I should be doing a lot of running.

412
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:42,293
I've worn sneakers from then on.

413
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,534
Oh, whatever I wear is up to me.

414
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:53,409
The bigger reason is, don't they look cool?

415
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,656
If l...gave up your case,

416
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,854
would you miss me?

417
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:15,993
If you're doing this because
you don't like me,

418
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,798
you can get someone else.

419
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:26,338
About the last time...I'm sorry.

420
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:38,891
Should I stay?

421
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,065
It's almost time for evening check.

422
00:42:54,508 --> 00:42:55,975
I'll be going.

423
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,247
Don't...

424
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:08,648
don't work too hard for me.

425
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:14,984
Don't keep making me want to live.

426
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,865
I'll see you again.

427
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:57,363
Man, I'm really tired from the night
shift. Calling a pro in for this.

428
00:44:57,731 --> 00:44:58,823
So it was simple?

429
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:04,665
The door knobs are just on backwards.
What a wacky house.

430
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:33,133
Come here! Do you wanna die? Get in!

431
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,929
Do as I say! I told you not to think!

432
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:40,737
-Please, honey...
-Get inside!

433
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:50,509
I solemnly swear to tell nothing but
the truth according to my conscience.

434
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:56,020
If I lie, I accept the penalty for perjury.

435
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:02,592
Proceed.

436
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:11,161
Did Shin-young Lee often visit you?

437
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:19,744
Once in awhile. But never after
her husband dragged her away.

438
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,141
When was that?

439
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:26,445
About 3 years ago,
a day before my sister's death anniversary.

440
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,085
April 15, 1997.

441
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:37,497
April 16, 1997. It was a natural
miscarriage due to an external shock.

442
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:41,399
Her condition was so serious
I transferred her to surgery.

443
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:43,763
What kind of external shock?

444
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:47,600
She said she fell down stairs.
But her injury was inconsistent with that.

445
00:46:47,775 --> 00:46:51,871
-Did you meet with her husband then?
-Ultimately no.

446
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:56,012
So I asked but she said he was busy
because he was a doctor.

447
00:46:56,183 --> 00:47:00,381
He didn't even show up when his wife
lost his baby by falling down stairs.

448
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:06,015
Later, I understand you performed an
abortion for her. What was the reason?

449
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:11,290
The mother didn't know she was pregnant
and had taken sedatives.

450
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:13,365
What kind of sedatives?

451
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:16,162
Diazepam.

452
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:17,894
Thank you.

453
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:23,175
Did you confirm she took the sedatives?

454
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:25,641
My patient told me.

455
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:28,573
You performed the abortion
without even confirming it?

456
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:34,816
After her miscarriage,
she suffered from severe insomnia.

457
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:39,220
She started taking the sedatives
3 years ago at my recommendation.

458
00:47:40,928 --> 00:47:42,759
You've treated Shin-young Lee, correct?

459
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:48,459
Yes. Suffering from claustrophobia
in solitary, they brought her in.

460
00:47:48,836 --> 00:47:52,294
How does one develop claustrophobia?

461
00:47:52,472 --> 00:47:54,337
It's a fear of being locked up.

462
00:47:54,508 --> 00:47:58,706
Just a shut door makes them believe
that their oxygen is disappearing.

463
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:01,939
Will you explain
why one develops such symptoms?

464
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:07,476
It can be genetic or acquired.

465
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:14,120
If you lock up a normal person,
for instance, can confinement be a cause?

466
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:15,522
Of course.

467
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,491
Have you heard of claustrophobia?

468
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:19,964
Yes.

469
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:23,864
Did Shin-young Lee ever show signs of it?

470
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:29,404
No. In fact, she enjoyed doing things
in her room by herself.

471
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:35,578
These are pictures of the murder scene

472
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:38,582
the home where the defendant
and her dead husband lived for 6 years.

473
00:48:39,152 --> 00:48:43,680
It seems just like other townhouses
but look closely at the door knobs.

474
00:48:44,658 --> 00:48:49,095
Except for the library,
the knobs are all backwards.

475
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:53,093
They lock from the outside. Inside,
one can only open it with a key.

476
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:00,338
Jong-hoon! Open the door, please!
Jong-hoon!

477
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:03,738
Confined in her home from the day
she married till the incident,

478
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:05,811
the defendant was regularly abused
by her husband.

479
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,249
The bedroom where the defendant
was found is also the same.

480
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:14,883
These are telephone bills of the
defendant and her deceased husband.

481
00:49:15,355 --> 00:49:19,155
For 3 years from April '97,

482
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:24,662
all outgoing calls were restricted
with only basic charges.

483
00:49:25,198 --> 00:49:29,897
The defendant could not ask for
outside help even if she wanted to.

484
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:37,771
And the bloodstained clothes she wore
were never found in the house.

485
00:49:37,945 --> 00:49:39,173
That is all.

486
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:42,310
Start your closing.

487
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:47,711
Given that the defendant
won't claim her innocence

488
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:50,553
and it cannot be proven scientifically

489
00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:52,817
it is just conjecture based
on her lawyer's presumption.

490
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:55,484
It cannot be a basis for a judgement.

491
00:49:56,063 --> 00:50:02,525
The defendant has rejected making
any statement during the trial.

492
00:50:02,803 --> 00:50:05,465
She shows no remorse.

493
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:08,836
Considering her meticulous planning
and callous method of murder,

494
00:50:09,142 --> 00:50:13,078
we ask that the death penalty
of the first trial be upheld.

495
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:17,650
Defense, your closing.

496
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:22,812
The evidence presented towards
my client's innocence is circumstantial.

497
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:27,290
However, so is the evidence towards her guilt.

498
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:29,288
Thus the best standard to judge

499
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:32,023
this case is the great principal
protected by the constitution,

500
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,633
"innocent until proven guilty."

501
00:50:35,002 --> 00:50:37,493
There is no conclusive evidence of
guilt or innocence in this case.

502
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:41,801
Are you going to convict because
there's no decisive proof of innocence

503
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:47,208
or vote not guilty because there's no
conclusive evidence of guilt?

504
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:50,313
I ask the court.

505
00:50:51,485 --> 00:50:52,645
That is all.

506
00:50:56,656 --> 00:51:01,150
There is suspicion surrounding
the defendant regarding the murder of

507
00:51:02,129 --> 00:51:05,394
Jong-hoon Sung but that cannot be
the deciding factor of guilt.

508
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:09,160
In accordance with the Criminal Code,
Article 325, my ruling is as follows.

509
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,936
I overturn the first verdict.
Defendant Shin-young Lee, not guilty.
