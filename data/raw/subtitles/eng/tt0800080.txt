1
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:03,826
Is it ready?

2
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,885
<i>Hey! That's a great punch.</i>

3
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:09,183
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.

4
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,959
Breathe. Breathe.

5
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,385
Wait.

6
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,290
Okay.

7
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,423
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...

8
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,683
Okay. Okay.

9
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,493
Shut that off! Turn it off!

10
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,498
Watch out!

11
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,739
Okay!

12
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,159
That's not right.

13
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,269
Oh, you.

14
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,616
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.

15
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,795
Damn it!

16
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,528
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

17
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,906
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.

18
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,994
<i>A man drank one of those guarana sodas.</i>

19
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,541
<i>Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.</i>

20
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,876
Wow.

21
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,216
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.

22
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,136
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.

23
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,598
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!

24
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,789
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

25
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,916
And I pulled you one ace.

26
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:03,342
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.

27
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,220
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

28
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,520
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.

29
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,565
Glad I could help. Just make it good.

30
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,786
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.

31
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,788
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,

32
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,208
but live fire is for backup only.

33
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,919
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.

34
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,629
Is he a fighter?

35
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,966
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government

36
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,302
who stole military secrets.

37
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,973
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,

38
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,894
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.

39
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,064
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

40
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,983
Tranq him and bring him back.

41
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,068
Oh, come on.

42
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,341
Camera.

43
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,094
Here we go.

44
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,275
Get rid of the damn dog.

45
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,163
Take him!

46
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,802
Target's on the move.

47
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,562
Where is he?

48
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,152
He's on the ground.

49
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,988
- Let's go!
- Go!

50
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:54,907
Move, move!

51
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,097
Go, go, go!

52
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,017
Go! Go!

53
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,688
Clear everyone out!

54
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,107
Do not lose him!

55
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,196
Oh! No!

56
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,102
Get around behind him!

57
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,273
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

58
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,164
Oh, no.

59
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,375
You got to be kidding me.

60
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,242
<i>- Where is he?
- Target acquired.</i>

61
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,256
Gringo!

62
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,773
Let's go.

63
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,580
No!

64
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,915
Please! No!

65
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,752
Not the computer!

66
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,379
Gimme that! No!

67
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:40,109
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.

68
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:44,989
Oh, no.

69
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,910
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!

70
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,972
Anybody else seeing this?

71
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,007
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advice.

72
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,052
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!

73
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,679
<i>Do it now!</i>

74
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,814
Go live! Go live! Go live!

75
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,691
- Move!
- Get out of the way!

76
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,359
No!

77
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:38,477
It's behind us! Move! Move!

78
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,362
Get him!

79
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,199
Shoot!

80
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,174
Leave me alone.

81
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,663
No! No!

82
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,636
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

83
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,055
He had it on him when he bolted.

84
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,523
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

85
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,404
She is no longer a factor.

86
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,949
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

87
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:01,078
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

88
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,505
Forgive me, sir?

89
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:15,009
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

90
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,845
He didn't lose us.

91
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,724
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

92
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,143
And then something hit us, something...

93
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:27,063
Something big hit us!

94
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,360
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

95
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:38,032
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

96
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,535
Well, it's gone.

97
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,539
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

98
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:47,750
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

99
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,669
- and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.

100
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:55,633
It

101
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,678
was Banner.

102
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,974
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.

103
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,228
You've done a good job.

104
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:12,900
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.

105
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:18,466
Wait.

106
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,386
Please.

107
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,020
Where am I?

108
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,642
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

109
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,852
I've seen good men go down

110
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:14,188
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

111
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,649
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?

112
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,109
I mean, that's the job.

113
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,402
But this?

114
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,073
This is a whole new level of weird.

115
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:27,034
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

116
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:30,163
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.

117
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:34,083
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

118
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,252
because if that thing shows up again,

119
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:41,048
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.

120
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:42,800
Sir.

121
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,144
<i>Tienes más stretchy?</i>

122
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,190
<i>Yeah. Perfecto.</i>

123
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:12,682
Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you

124
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:16,102
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.

125
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:22,149
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development programme.

126
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:26,863
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

127
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:29,532
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

128
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,409
Yeah, Super Soldier.

129
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,954
Yes.

130
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,040
An oversimplification, but yes.

131
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:42,795
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.

132
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,590
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.

133
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,884
<i>We were tryin' to make you better.</i>

134
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:56,642
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.

135
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,312
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

136
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:02,607
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

137
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,320
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

138
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,198
And something went very wrong.

139
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,535
Or it went very right.

140
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:19,457
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

141
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,502
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

142
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,712
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?

143
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,797
You were trying other things.

144
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,759
One serum we developed

145
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,345
was very promising.

146
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:35,056
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.

147
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:38,267
He is not one of us.

148
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:45,691
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
- 39.

149
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:50,071
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

150
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,405
So get out of the trenches.

151
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,950
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.

152
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:58,287
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.

153
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:01,582
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,

154
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:04,418
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.

155
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:09,298
I could probably arrange
something like that.

156
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,191
Take care, kids.

157
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,954
Stan, I give you my word,

158
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,747
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

159
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:50,001
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.

160
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:52,837
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.

161
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,676
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

162
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,012
She doesn't know that I'm here.

163
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:07,185
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.

164
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:10,688
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.

165
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:15,610
Good. That's good.

166
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:20,531
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.

167
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:24,494
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.

168
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,539
There is one other thing.

169
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,378
Excuse me. Pardon me.

170
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:37,465
Coming through.

171
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,013
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

172
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,432
I don't think there's anybody up there.

173
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:50,978
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.

174
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:56,526
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.

175
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:06,536
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.

176
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,206
All right.

177
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,056
Okay.

178
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,966
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.

179
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:27,468
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

180
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:30,346
Oh, kids.

181
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:33,015
I got nothing but marinara now.

182
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,142
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

183
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:37,436
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

184
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:46,279
Stan?

185
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:52,034
And he... I go, " So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?

186
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:54,162
"I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil."

187
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:56,747
And he goes, "Not where you been at."

188
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:00,543
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.

189
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,530
Bruce?

190
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,165
Betty? What's going on?

191
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:55,640
Betty...

192
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:58,809
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.

193
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:03,814
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.

194
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:47,817
Don't go. Don't go.

195
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,620
I want you to come with me now.

196
00:42:59,704 --> 00:43:01,914
Please. Come with me.

197
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:04,584
Please.

198
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:36,240
It's our data.

199
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,203
I got in there before they carted it all away.

200
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:46,125
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.

201
00:43:48,461 --> 00:43:53,132
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.

202
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:55,551
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.

203
00:43:55,635 --> 00:43:57,136
You have to be sure.

204
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:02,266
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.

205
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:07,313
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.

206
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:10,650
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

207
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:12,902
He wants to make it a weapon.

208
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:06,164
- Hi.
- Hi.

209
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,210
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.

210
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,674
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.

211
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:20,178
Really? You can't stay at all?

212
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:23,598
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.

213
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:28,895
- lf I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.

214
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:30,605
I need to take a bus.

215
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:33,399
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.

216
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,486
Okay.

217
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:42,825
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

218
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:47,079
I...

219
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:49,582
What?

220
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:54,045
- Good night.
- Good night.

221
00:45:54,128 --> 00:45:56,130
I hope you get some rest.

222
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:40,883
We're giving you a very low dose only.

223
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:43,886
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.

224
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,972
First sign of any side effect,

225
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:49,725
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

226
00:46:50,518 --> 00:46:52,270
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

227
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,943
You'll get two separate infusions.

228
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:03,239
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centres.

229
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:05,616
The bone ones are going to hurt.

230
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:53,998
Is everything okay?

231
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:57,335
I think so.

232
00:48:05,718 --> 00:48:07,053
Come here.

233
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:10,765
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.

234
00:48:11,974 --> 00:48:14,018
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?

235
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:20,316
It feels too tight, huh?

236
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:22,193
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

237
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:32,662
- What?
- They're here.

238
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:34,413
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!

239
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:35,748
You have to go far away
from me as you can!

240
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:37,333
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!

241
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:50,638
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.

242
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:52,265
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

243
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:55,726
He's heading 2-7-0.

244
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:14,537
Blonsky! Not yet!

245
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:17,165
Sir.

246
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:20,418
Look alive. This could get interesting.

247
00:50:08,424 --> 00:50:09,509
I got him!

248
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,887
Stop! Stop!

249
00:50:14,722 --> 00:50:16,098
I know you're in there!

250
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:19,560
General, please!

251
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:23,105
Sir?

252
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:24,816
Dad!

253
00:50:32,281 --> 00:50:36,410
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

254
00:50:36,494 --> 00:50:38,329
There he is!

255
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:40,623
<i>Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.</i>

256
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:42,875
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

257
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:50,132
He's locked in.

258
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:57,682
Put two canisters in there with him.

259
00:50:58,307 --> 00:50:59,433
Fire!

260
00:51:18,536 --> 00:51:19,704
Get her back here!

261
00:51:54,197 --> 00:51:55,239
Now she'll see.

262
00:52:18,095 --> 00:52:19,222
Alpha team?

263
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:22,308
Let him have all of it.

264
00:52:28,564 --> 00:52:30,066
Come on, light him up!

265
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:36,656
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!

266
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:26,038
Oh, my God!

267
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:30,710
Blonsky, now you're up!

268
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:32,545
Sir?

269
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:35,006
Cover me.

270
00:53:53,107 --> 00:53:54,609
Remember me?

271
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:15,963
My God, he's doing it.

272
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:22,345
Move him toward the cannons!

273
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:29,560
Move!

274
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:44,325
Hold your position!

275
00:54:44,408 --> 00:54:45,743
Do it now!

276
00:55:11,602 --> 00:55:13,146
Please, please, please, no!

277
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:14,647
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!

278
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:15,773
You're killing him!

279
00:55:15,857 --> 00:55:18,192
Stop! Get off of me!

280
00:55:18,276 --> 00:55:19,694
Bruce!

281
00:55:22,515 --> 00:55:26,435
Bruce! Bruce!

282
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:56,841
Where's the gunship?

283
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:18,112
Is that it?

284
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,114
Blonsky, pull back now.

285
00:56:20,197 --> 00:56:21,490
<i>Pull back!</i>

286
00:56:24,618 --> 00:56:26,412
Is that all you got?

287
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:36,547
- Fall back!
- Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

288
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,007
Find cover!

289
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:43,220
Betty!

290
00:56:56,692 --> 00:56:58,194
Fire, goddamn it!

291
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:01,197
Bruce?

292
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:15,586
Stop firing!

293
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:30,559
No!

294
00:58:20,693 --> 00:58:23,237
You did the right thing, calling us.

295
00:58:25,364 --> 00:58:28,284
I need to know where they're going.

296
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:30,536
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.

297
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:31,912
From who?

298
00:58:32,788 --> 00:58:35,416
He protected her. You almost killed her.

299
00:58:35,499 --> 00:58:39,253
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

300
00:58:39,336 --> 00:58:42,047
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me

301
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:45,050
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

302
00:58:45,384 --> 00:58:46,469
And you are.

303
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:50,014
I don't know where he's going.

304
00:58:50,973 --> 00:58:55,144
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.

305
00:58:56,437 --> 00:58:58,981
And I can't help either one of them.

306
00:59:04,028 --> 00:59:07,114
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

307
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,866
Now I know!

308
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:16,123
Where does she meet these guys?

309
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:06,799
Bruce?

310
01:00:17,017 --> 01:00:18,185
Bruce.

311
01:00:38,372 --> 01:00:40,541
It's okay. It's okay.

312
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:56,432
Come here. Come this way.

313
01:00:59,643 --> 01:01:01,270
Watch your head.

314
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:17,495
Okay.

315
01:01:28,297 --> 01:01:29,465
We're okay.

316
01:01:34,387 --> 01:01:35,763
It's okay.

317
01:01:37,598 --> 01:01:39,308
It's just the rain.

318
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:50,778
Will he ever walk again?

319
01:01:50,861 --> 01:01:54,448
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

320
01:01:54,532 --> 01:01:58,327
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.

321
01:01:58,411 --> 01:02:01,622
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.

322
01:03:04,185 --> 01:03:05,311
Here.

323
01:03:06,854 --> 01:03:08,022
Okay.

324
01:03:48,687 --> 01:03:49,897
Bruce?

325
01:03:51,399 --> 01:03:52,650
Oh, hi.

326
01:03:53,234 --> 01:03:54,360
Are you okay?

327
01:03:54,985 --> 01:03:56,112
Yeah.

328
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,572
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

329
01:03:58,656 --> 01:04:01,242
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.

330
01:04:02,785 --> 01:04:03,911
You ate it?

331
01:04:03,994 --> 01:04:08,249
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.

332
01:04:08,332 --> 01:04:09,417
Wow.

333
01:04:10,918 --> 01:04:15,256
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.

334
01:04:15,339 --> 01:04:17,925
First thing's first.

335
01:04:18,008 --> 01:04:19,635
Oh, you're kidding me.

336
01:04:29,895 --> 01:04:31,021
What?

337
01:04:31,605 --> 01:04:34,442
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.

338
01:04:34,525 --> 01:04:35,860
I'll take my chances.

339
01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:38,571
<i>Rumours continue
to swirl about a violent clash</i>

340
01:04:38,654 --> 01:04:42,450
<i>between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary</i>

341
01:04:42,533 --> 01:04:45,494
<i>on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.</i>

342
01:04:45,578 --> 01:04:48,831
<i>Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.</i>

343
01:04:48,914 --> 01:04:50,374
<i>It was so big.</i>

344
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:53,335
<i>- It was like this huge, like, hulk!
- Yeah.</i>

345
01:04:53,419 --> 01:04:56,464
<i>McGhee, who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper,</i>

346
01:04:56,547 --> 01:04:58,257
<i>captured this on his cell phone.</i>

347
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,051
<i>Further search for the mysterious "hulk"</i>

348
01:05:00,134 --> 01:05:04,638
<i>was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.</i>

349
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:15,107
Not too short back there.

350
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:17,651
I have done this before, you know.

351
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:36,128
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

352
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:38,130
With clippers, usually.

353
01:06:32,977 --> 01:06:35,688
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?

354
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:37,148
We can't do this.

355
01:06:37,231 --> 01:06:39,316
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.

356
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:41,444
No.

357
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:43,863
I can't.

358
01:06:47,408 --> 01:06:49,410
I can't get too excited.

359
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:54,206
Not even a little excited?

360
01:06:56,876 --> 01:06:58,252
It's okay.

361
01:07:02,923 --> 01:07:04,800
Sir, it's Blonsky.

362
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:10,222
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

363
01:07:11,015 --> 01:07:12,683
Ask him yourself.

364
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:17,563
Sir?

365
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:41,754
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

366
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:49,970
How do you feel?

367
01:07:51,931 --> 01:07:54,350
Pissed off and ready for round three.

368
01:08:00,773 --> 01:08:04,777
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.

369
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:07,655
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

370
01:08:08,614 --> 01:08:11,742
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.

371
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:14,745
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take

372
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:15,996
- your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.

373
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,708
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

374
01:08:19,792 --> 01:08:22,086
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.

375
01:08:22,211 --> 01:08:24,338
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

376
01:08:24,422 --> 01:08:28,342
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?

377
01:08:31,387 --> 01:08:34,265
Well, we could sell this.

378
01:08:34,348 --> 01:08:37,893
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.

379
01:08:40,104 --> 01:08:42,815
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

380
01:08:43,482 --> 01:08:45,401
Federal is
already monitoring phones,

381
01:08:45,484 --> 01:08:47,737
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,

382
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:50,072
and local PD have been placed on alert.

383
01:08:50,156 --> 01:08:52,825
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.

384
01:08:52,908 --> 01:08:54,869
They're not gonna just pop up.

385
01:08:54,952 --> 01:08:57,997
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.

386
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,915
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

387
01:09:00,332 --> 01:09:02,084
<i>If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.</i>

388
01:09:02,168 --> 01:09:03,335
<i>He's not trying to escape this time.</i>

389
01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:05,921
<i>He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.</i>

390
01:09:06,005 --> 01:09:08,424
<i>We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.</i>

391
01:09:08,507 --> 01:09:10,342
<i>You all have copies of the correspondence.</i>

392
01:09:10,843 --> 01:09:12,887
<i>The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue</i>

393
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:15,097
<i>have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.</i>

394
01:09:16,098 --> 01:09:17,808
<i>If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.</i>

395
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,270
<i>If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.</i>

396
01:09:21,353 --> 01:09:23,773
<i>And when he slips up, we'll be ready.</i>

397
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:07,775
Hey.

398
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:10,820
Smile.

399
01:10:21,247 --> 01:10:22,915
What is it like?

400
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:27,586
When it happens, what do you experience?

401
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:30,923
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

402
01:10:31,006 --> 01:10:33,092
Those induced hallucinations?

403
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:37,263
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.

404
01:10:39,098 --> 01:10:43,018
It's like someone's poured
a litre of acid into my brain.

405
01:10:43,102 --> 01:10:47,940
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.

406
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:51,610
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

407
01:10:51,694 --> 01:10:55,281
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.

408
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:01,871
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

409
01:11:02,621 --> 01:11:04,039
Maybe your mind is in there,

410
01:11:04,123 --> 01:11:06,751
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

411
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:10,129
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.

412
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,810
Are you ready?

413
01:11:24,894 --> 01:11:26,645
Let's even the playing field a little.

414
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:31,358
Gentlemen.

415
01:11:35,321 --> 01:11:38,991
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.

416
01:11:50,086 --> 01:11:53,130
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

417
01:12:08,604 --> 01:12:10,231
All right. Come.

418
01:12:24,036 --> 01:12:28,374
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.

419
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,168
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

420
01:12:31,252 --> 01:12:33,712
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?

421
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:36,465
Right. Let's get a cab.

422
01:12:36,549 --> 01:12:40,761
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

423
01:12:45,683 --> 01:12:47,268
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.

424
01:12:47,351 --> 01:12:50,479
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

425
01:12:50,563 --> 01:12:52,606
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

426
01:12:55,901 --> 01:12:58,571
Are you out of your mind?

427
01:12:58,654 --> 01:12:59,989
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?

428
01:13:00,072 --> 01:13:01,782
You don't like a good ride?

429
01:13:03,617 --> 01:13:04,869
Asshole!

430
01:13:07,997 --> 01:13:10,499
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you

431
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:14,795
- manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.

432
01:13:15,212 --> 01:13:16,255
Okay.

433
01:13:23,804 --> 01:13:25,765
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?

434
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:28,392
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

435
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,312
Oh! Dr Ross!

436
01:13:31,395 --> 01:13:34,315
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.

437
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:38,277
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?

438
01:13:40,112 --> 01:13:41,489
Mr Green?

439
01:13:43,741 --> 01:13:47,411
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.

440
01:13:47,495 --> 01:13:49,246
And if you were, what would it look like?

441
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:54,001
A person with that much
power lurking in him.

442
01:13:54,085 --> 01:13:55,711
Nothing could have surprised me more

443
01:13:55,795 --> 01:13:58,672
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.

444
01:13:58,756 --> 01:14:01,425
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.

445
01:14:01,509 --> 01:14:03,177
Even if everything goes perfectly,

446
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:07,098
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

447
01:14:08,099 --> 01:14:10,017
is that going to be a lasting cure

448
01:14:10,101 --> 01:14:13,437
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?

449
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:17,191
I don't know.

450
01:14:17,942 --> 01:14:22,655
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer

451
01:14:23,614 --> 01:14:28,494
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

452
01:14:28,577 --> 01:14:33,124
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

453
01:14:34,834 --> 01:14:36,961
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.

454
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:40,589
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,

455
01:14:40,673 --> 01:14:43,134
this will be very dangerous for you.

456
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:48,973
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,

457
01:14:49,056 --> 01:14:53,310
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?

458
01:15:48,365 --> 01:15:49,992
How you feeling, man?

459
01:15:51,744 --> 01:15:53,329
Like a monster.

460
01:16:13,224 --> 01:16:14,975
Okay. On the table.

461
01:16:15,726 --> 01:16:21,107
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.

462
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:25,319
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

463
01:16:29,532 --> 01:16:33,953
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

464
01:16:38,582 --> 01:16:39,708
Okay...

465
01:16:40,292 --> 01:16:41,752
You, you, you.

466
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:46,841
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

467
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:51,011
We have begun.

468
01:16:52,847 --> 01:16:55,891
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.

469
01:16:55,975 --> 01:17:00,438
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.

470
01:17:00,521 --> 01:17:01,689
Just relax.

471
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,776
Okay. We are comprehensive.

472
01:17:08,988 --> 01:17:10,448
Here you go.

473
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:22,460
All right. We set to pop?

474
01:17:24,962 --> 01:17:27,131
I'd take your hands off him.

475
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:48,986
Oh, my God!

476
01:18:03,084 --> 01:18:05,127
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

477
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:18,516
- Now. Okay, now!
- Wait.

478
01:18:18,599 --> 01:18:21,185
Now, do it! Do it!

479
01:18:28,692 --> 01:18:31,195
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

480
01:18:31,278 --> 01:18:35,783
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!

481
01:18:37,243 --> 01:18:41,247
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.

482
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:44,875
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

483
01:19:04,478 --> 01:19:05,688
Bruce.

484
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:07,148
Oh, my God.

485
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:21,537
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

486
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:26,751
Bruce?

487
01:19:35,593 --> 01:19:38,971
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

488
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:43,768
You did it.

489
01:19:43,934 --> 01:19:46,604
He's fine. This is fantastic.

490
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,022
It's over.

491
01:19:48,939 --> 01:19:50,024
Hi.

492
01:19:50,357 --> 01:19:51,484
Hi.

493
01:19:59,825 --> 01:20:05,790
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!

494
01:20:05,873 --> 01:20:07,458
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

495
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,919
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.

496
01:20:10,002 --> 01:20:13,798
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.

497
01:20:13,881 --> 01:20:15,633
- I think Dr Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?

498
01:20:15,716 --> 01:20:18,969
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.

499
01:20:19,053 --> 01:20:21,847
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!

500
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:24,642
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently,

501
01:20:24,725 --> 01:20:26,644
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

502
01:20:26,727 --> 01:20:29,063
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know

503
01:20:29,146 --> 01:20:30,940
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.

504
01:20:31,023 --> 01:20:32,650
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.

505
01:20:32,733 --> 01:20:34,151
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting

506
01:20:34,235 --> 01:20:36,779
- the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?

507
01:20:37,822 --> 01:20:39,573
What test subjects?

508
01:20:40,282 --> 01:20:41,325
Come with me.

509
01:20:58,426 --> 01:21:02,346
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

510
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,598
<i>We started on rats and mice,</i>

511
01:21:04,682 --> 01:21:07,268
<i>but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.</i>

512
01:21:07,518 --> 01:21:10,646
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.

513
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:14,483
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.

514
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:19,321
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

515
01:21:19,405 --> 01:21:22,658
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!

516
01:21:22,742 --> 01:21:26,454
This is potentially Olympian!

517
01:21:26,537 --> 01:21:30,040
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

518
01:21:30,124 --> 01:21:32,168
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

519
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:35,379
We will make humans
impervious to disease!

520
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,228
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

521
01:21:51,687 --> 01:21:53,564
- Wait, what?
- All of it.

522
01:21:53,689 --> 01:21:55,066
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

523
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:57,401
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...

524
01:21:57,485 --> 01:21:59,028
We could get the Nobel for this!

525
01:21:59,111 --> 01:22:01,322
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

526
01:22:01,405 --> 01:22:04,033
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

527
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,202
At your discretion, shooter.

528
01:22:06,285 --> 01:22:07,745
<i>three of us!
This is Promethean fire!</i>

529
01:22:07,828 --> 01:22:08,871
<i>It's just...</i>

530
01:22:08,954 --> 01:22:10,206
<i>No shot.</i>

531
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:15,336
Blonsky's going in.

532
01:22:17,546 --> 01:22:20,424
<i>Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there!</i>

533
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,095
We have the antidote now.

534
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:27,014
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!

535
01:22:33,896 --> 01:22:35,898
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

536
01:22:36,107 --> 01:22:38,150
<i>You don't know how powerful this thing is.</i>

537
01:22:38,234 --> 01:22:40,236
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,

538
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:42,113
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

539
01:22:49,912 --> 01:22:51,414
Bruce! Bruce!

540
01:22:53,124 --> 01:22:54,375
Get out.

541
01:22:57,628 --> 01:23:00,381
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

542
01:23:04,593 --> 01:23:06,262
Show him to me.

543
01:23:07,763 --> 01:23:09,056
Blonsky!

544
01:23:17,523 --> 01:23:18,607
Miss!

545
01:23:20,109 --> 01:23:21,485
Take this.

546
01:23:25,114 --> 01:23:29,702
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

547
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:36,625
Betty.

548
01:23:38,586 --> 01:23:41,589
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

549
01:23:41,672 --> 01:23:43,007
He's a fugitive.

550
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:45,051
You made him a fugitive

551
01:23:45,134 --> 01:23:48,637
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.

552
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:52,266
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

553
01:23:54,518 --> 01:23:58,022
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

554
01:24:02,943 --> 01:24:04,153
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

555
01:24:04,236 --> 01:24:08,991
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together

556
01:24:09,075 --> 01:24:12,411
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.

557
01:24:12,495 --> 01:24:16,373
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!

558
01:24:16,457 --> 01:24:18,376
So Banner's the only...

559
01:24:22,171 --> 01:24:26,592
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?

560
01:24:29,011 --> 01:24:34,100
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

561
01:24:34,183 --> 01:24:36,894
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.

562
01:24:37,853 --> 01:24:40,314
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.

563
01:24:43,818 --> 01:24:47,863
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

564
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:52,827
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?

565
01:24:53,536 --> 01:24:54,745
I have.

566
01:24:55,704 --> 01:24:57,248
And it's beautiful.

567
01:24:58,082 --> 01:24:59,333
Godlike.

568
01:24:59,542 --> 01:25:01,252
Well, I want that.

569
01:25:03,421 --> 01:25:05,506
I need that. Make me that.

570
01:25:06,382 --> 01:25:09,385
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

571
01:25:09,468 --> 01:25:11,053
The mix could be

572
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,222
an abomination.

573
01:25:16,892 --> 01:25:19,729
I didn't say I was unwilling.

574
01:25:20,271 --> 01:25:24,024
I just need informed consent.

575
01:25:26,527 --> 01:25:28,320
And you've given it.

576
01:26:09,445 --> 01:26:13,699
This is what I was trying to explain.

577
01:26:13,783 --> 01:26:18,704
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.

578
01:26:18,788 --> 01:26:20,873
But clearly it worked.

579
01:26:20,956 --> 01:26:24,585
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

580
01:26:24,668 --> 01:26:29,507
but if you'll just get back on the table,

581
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:32,093
I can fix this.

582
01:26:46,982 --> 01:26:48,692
- Shoot it!
- Hey!

583
01:26:49,485 --> 01:26:50,569
No!

584
01:27:00,162 --> 01:27:02,206
Delta 4 to Leader.

585
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:04,041
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!

586
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:06,836
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

587
01:27:09,714 --> 01:27:12,007
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

588
01:27:19,974 --> 01:27:21,559
It's over there!

589
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:24,520
Drop them!

590
01:27:24,603 --> 01:27:26,856
- What is that thing?
- Shoot it!

591
01:27:36,323 --> 01:27:40,119
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!

592
01:27:40,202 --> 01:27:41,537
- Delta 4 to Leader!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

593
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,539
Something big
just went off down here!

594
01:27:44,081 --> 01:27:46,208
General, you should hear this!

595
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:49,211
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

596
01:27:51,797 --> 01:27:53,883
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.

597
01:27:53,966 --> 01:27:55,885
You get it together. What is your position?

598
01:27:56,135 --> 01:27:59,263
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

599
01:27:59,346 --> 01:28:00,890
Turn us around.

600
01:28:07,855 --> 01:28:11,067
We're going back. Why are we going back?

601
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:12,777
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

602
01:28:13,194 --> 01:28:14,487
Yes, sir!

603
01:28:16,489 --> 01:28:18,407
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

604
01:28:18,741 --> 01:28:20,367
Go, go, go!

605
01:28:43,933 --> 01:28:45,184
No!

606
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:02,785
One of yours?

607
01:29:03,035 --> 01:29:06,122
Oh, my God. What have you done?

608
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:10,292
Fire at him, fire at him!

609
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:16,716
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

610
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:18,384
Come on!

611
01:29:21,887 --> 01:29:23,055
Sweet.

612
01:29:25,975 --> 01:29:27,184
Booyah!

613
01:29:45,202 --> 01:29:46,537
Get out of there, soldier!

614
01:29:49,874 --> 01:29:51,500
Stacy!

615
01:30:22,156 --> 01:30:24,075
Give me a real fight!

616
01:30:32,166 --> 01:30:33,334
Sir?

617
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:37,129
Sir?

618
01:30:38,672 --> 01:30:41,675
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.

619
01:30:45,054 --> 01:30:48,516
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.

620
01:30:48,849 --> 01:30:50,393
What are you saying?

621
01:30:50,559 --> 01:30:51,852
You think you can control it?

622
01:30:51,936 --> 01:30:55,064
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

623
01:30:55,147 --> 01:30:56,607
And what if you can't?

624
01:30:58,150 --> 01:30:59,902
We made this thing.

625
01:31:00,403 --> 01:31:01,737
All of us.

626
01:31:02,738 --> 01:31:03,948
Please.

627
01:31:08,911 --> 01:31:11,414
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.

628
01:31:12,998 --> 01:31:14,333
Open the back door.

629
01:31:20,089 --> 01:31:24,969
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?

630
01:31:25,052 --> 01:31:28,764
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!

631
01:31:30,766 --> 01:31:33,978
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!

632
01:31:34,061 --> 01:31:35,813
Betty, I've got to try.

633
01:31:37,982 --> 01:31:39,316
I'm sorry.

634
01:32:01,964 --> 01:32:03,632
Oh, shit!

635
01:32:07,636 --> 01:32:10,473
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.

636
01:32:27,907 --> 01:32:29,950
There. Betty!

637
01:32:49,011 --> 01:32:50,554
Hulk!

638
01:32:55,351 --> 01:32:57,061
Yeah!

639
01:33:41,313 --> 01:33:42,565
Come on!

640
01:34:14,805 --> 01:34:16,766
Is that all you've got?

641
01:34:30,488 --> 01:34:33,282
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

642
01:34:33,365 --> 01:34:34,617
Which one?

643
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,036
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?

644
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:38,954
Cut the other one in half!

645
01:34:41,624 --> 01:34:42,792
Ross!

646
01:35:07,566 --> 01:35:09,318
Keep it on him!

647
01:35:37,513 --> 01:35:40,516
- Look, I got to put it down!
- Hang on!

648
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:48,876
Dad?

649
01:36:51,504 --> 01:36:54,006
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

650
01:37:01,764 --> 01:37:03,641
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

651
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:58,154
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

652
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:50,539
Look out!

653
01:39:21,362 --> 01:39:22,613
General?

654
01:39:28,869 --> 01:39:31,455
Any last words?

655
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:37,670
Hulk smash!

656
01:40:25,217 --> 01:40:26,802
Stop!

657
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:48,884
It's okay.

658
01:41:59,019 --> 01:42:00,688
Betty.

659
01:44:28,711 --> 01:44:30,046
Reload.

660
01:44:37,595 --> 01:44:38,804
Reload.

661
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:57,990
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

662
01:44:58,074 --> 01:44:59,825
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

663
01:44:59,909 --> 01:45:04,330
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

664
01:45:04,413 --> 01:45:07,291
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

665
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:09,794
- Stark.
- General.

666
01:45:12,129 --> 01:45:14,632
You always wear such nice suits.

667
01:45:15,591 --> 01:45:16,926
Touché.

668
01:45:17,843 --> 01:45:21,555
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

669
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:23,140
You should listen.

670
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:29,313
What if I told you
we were putting a team together?

671
01:45:29,397 --> 01:45:30,981
Who's "we"?
