1
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,517
<i>I guess I've always been</i>
<i>pretty good with words.</i>

2
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,589
<i>In my line of business</i>

3
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,659
<i>it's as important to be able to</i>
<i>describe what I'm doing</i>

4
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,820
<i>as it is to do what I'm doing.</i>

5
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,494
<i>When to say what.</i>

6
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,990
<i>What words to select.</i>

7
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,090
<i>Some men hate to hear</i>
<i>certain terms.</i>

8
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,270
<i>They can't stand</i>
<i>specific moves and</i>

9
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,200
<i>then they can't live</i>
<i>without others.</i>

10
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:53,002
<i>It's part of my job to know</i>
<i>where to place my hand,</i>

11
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:58,382
<i>my lips, my tongue, my leg</i>

12
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,914
<i>and even my thoughts.</i>

13
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,527
<i>What kind of pressure,</i>
<i>for how long, when to stop.</i>

14
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,832
<i>I can become your first kiss...</i>

15
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,239
<i>Or a torn out image</i>
<i>from a Playboy magazine</i>

16
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,366
<i>that you found</i>
<i>when you were nine years old.</i>

17
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,940
<i>Am I your secretary</i>

18
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,772
<i>or am I your daughter?</i>

19
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,179
<i>Maybe I'm your seventh grade</i>
<i>math teacher you always hated.</i>

20
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,783
<i>All I know is that</i>
<i>if I do it just right,</i>

21
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:39,055
<i>I can become</i>
<i>your living, breathing,</i>

22
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,619
<i>unflinching dream,</i>
<i>and then I can actually</i>

23
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,096
<i>disappear.</i>

24
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,131
Dr. Stewart.

25
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,803
Your last appointment's ready.

26
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,010
All right.
Thanks, Julie.

27
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,647
When was your first period?

28
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,814
Uh... I was fourteen.

29
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,289
And what's your occupation?

30
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,490
I'm a dancer.

31
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,392
Oh, yeah? What kind?

32
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,893
Classical ballet.

33
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:14,951
Oh.

34
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,564
Do you use any
form of contraception?

35
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,758
No.

36
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,266
So you want to have a baby?

37
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,200
No. Not at all. No.

38
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,497
You don't practise safe sex?

39
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,633
I've never had an orgasm.

40
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,604
From intercourse?

41
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,845
We're okay, thanks.

42
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,485
I've barely ever had sex.

43
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,087
There's something about
it I don't get.

44
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,792
Well, an orgasm is simply
a series of muscle contractions.

45
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,397
That's it. It comes from
manipulating the clitoris.

46
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:56,130
There's nothing mysterious and
there's nothing magic about it.

47
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,304
I'll give you some literature
to take home, okay?

48
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,430
Okay.

49
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:00,707
You can get dressed now.

50
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,571
Thank you.

51
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,007
Here we are at scene two where Leporello

52
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,684
catalogues Don Giovanni's conquests.

53
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:15,688
Country by country.
Age by age. Shape by shape.

54
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,459
Is she sweet or cruel?
A peasant or a princess?

55
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,086
Single? Married?

56
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:25,130
As he says, "It doesn't really
matter. She wears a skirt."

57
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:30,235
If we look at the title of
this aria which is...?

58
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,405
You.

59
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,474
Madamina, il catalogo e questo.

60
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,066
And what's he saying?

61
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,407
Sir?

62
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,712
"In Italy, six hundred and forty.

63
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,015
In Germany,
two hundred and thirty-one.

64
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,150
Spain, a thousand and three."

65
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,855
Lovers that Don Giovanni
took in Spain alone.

66
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,755
A very busy man.

67
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,660
Yes?

68
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,796
A few of us would like to
take you to dinner. Can you come?

69
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,698
Thank you. I'd love to.

70
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:03,362
And I'm honoured.
But... today's my birthday.

71
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,633
And I've got a flight back home
in an hour and a half.

72
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,073
Happy birthday to you

73
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:16,706
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday

74
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,552
Happy birthday to...

75
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,523
Hi, how are you?

76
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,324
Did you get a drink?

77
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,951
- Sure.
- Okay.

78
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,560
Oh, presents go in my office, okay?

79
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,099
You realize I'd have to kill you
if you ever did this to me.

80
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,701
You are a very brave wife.

81
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,170
Oh, I changed my dress, like,
twenty-five times. Is it okay?

82
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,738
You look beautiful.
You look amazing.

83
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,073
- Thank you.
- What time is he supposed to be here?

84
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,009
Well, his flight arrived, like,
forty minutes ago. So any minute now.

85
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,011
Here you go.

86
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,445
Thanks. So...?

87
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,742
Michael!

88
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,513
Hey, your dad's going to be
here any minute. Come and join us.

89
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,830
Where did the little boy
who used to run into his mommy's arms go?

90
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,065
His girlfriend is probably
going down on him right about now.

91
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,795
That's a horrible thing to
say to a mother.

92
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,269
He's doing a lot better.

93
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,704
Yeah, he is.

94
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,830
Trina.

95
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,165
Trina. This is Catherine.

96
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,009
Our hostess and my office mate.

97
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:17,710
Hi.

98
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,778
Hi. Lovely to meet you.

99
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,179
What an amazing house you have.

100
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,407
Thank you.

101
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,349
Oh! That's probably him.
Quiet, everybody!

102
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,926
Hello?

103
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,291
<i>Hey, Catherine.</i>

104
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,330
Hi, honey.

105
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,431
<i>Are you home?</i>

106
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,228
I'm going to be a little late.

107
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,136
Well, I talked to the airline.
They said that your flight landed.

108
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,531
I missed it by a few minutes.

109
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,499
<i>You said you couldn't pick me up</i>
<i>at the airport. So...</i>

110
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,476
Well, do you know
when you'll be home?

111
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,785
The next flight isn't
for two hours.

112
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,253
I don't think I'll be in
before you go to sleep.

113
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,345
I'm so sorry.

114
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,493
<i>Catherine? Sweetheart.</i>

115
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,054
Um... We'll see you
when you get back then.

116
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,435
Looks like the surprise is on us.
He missed his flight.

117
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:29,211
We could charter our own flight
and surprise him down there.

118
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,085
I have to admit this
wasn't part of the plan,

119
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,577
but no reason to
stop the party, right?

120
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,332
Michael! Your friend
will have to go home. It's late.

121
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,286
Hi.

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,836
Guess I should have told you.

124
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,905
Yeah. You should have.

125
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,374
But then it wouldn't have been a surprise.

126
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:39,145
Geez, at my age. You know I try
and ignore my birthdays, Catherine.

127
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,739
- It's so bloody...
- Embarrassing?

128
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,676
Yeah.

129
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,812
Your presents are in my office.
I got you a bottle of Scotch.

130
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:54,956
I'll be a bit late again tonight.
More boring Curriculum Committee crap.

131
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,796
Yeah. But you're not late now.

132
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,923
I'll pick up a coffee on the way.

133
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,091
Morning.

134
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,662
Michael. Your mom's in the hallway
and she just saw me naked.

135
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,264
Jesus, Michael.
This is not okay.

136
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,099
I just got here.

137
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,967
You're lying.

138
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,010
I should probably go home.

139
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,745
Look, Dad knows.

140
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,052
Your father knows about this?

141
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,748
She's... she's in my house
all night and nobody tells me?

142
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,883
Anna. Her name's Anna.

143
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,691
Are you using protection?

144
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,492
We use condoms.

145
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,098
This is not happening every night.

146
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,671
Understand me?

147
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,151
- See you kids a little later.
- See you later.

148
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,584
Bye, honey. Bye.

149
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,950
Over here.

150
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,524
- Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,628
- You changed your hair.
- Yeah. Hasn't noticed.

152
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,963
Well, that's 'cause he
likes it down.

153
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:44,830
How do you know?

154
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,966
Well, all men do.
They imagine it wrapped around their?

155
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,627
That's enough, Frank.

156
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,037
Here, please. Sorry, darling.

157
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,026
Hi.

158
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,504
- Hi, David.
- Hey, Frank.

159
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,800
So...?

160
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,379
I'm Delia.
I'll be your waitress this evening.

161
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,006
What can I get you to drink?

162
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,917
What do you like to drink, Delia?

163
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,043
Me?

164
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,411
I like the Maybach Vineyard.

165
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:12,919
It's a very intense pure
and deep taste.

166
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:17,229
Oh... Well, I guess
I better have one of those, then.

167
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,161
Good choice.

168
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,286
And you?

169
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,396
I'll have the same.

170
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,368
Where's the bathroom? Frank.

171
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,568
Oh, it's over there.

172
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,108
So...

173
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,973
Are you okay?

174
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,646
Yeah. I'm fine, thank you.

175
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,412
Can I do anything?

176
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,124
There's no toilet paper
in this stall.

177
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,455
I have some.

178
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,099
Here you go.

179
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,671
Men are such assholes.

180
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,767
Yeah.

181
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,391
Thank you.

182
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,551
You're welcome.

183
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,233
I think you dropped this.

184
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,100
Oh, that's not mine.

185
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,273
Take it anyway.

186
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,680
Why?

187
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,019
I want you to have it.

188
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,022
I have to get
back to my husband.

189
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,301
We're playing
"Spot the Hooker."

190
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,778
Mm. That's pleasant.

191
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,750
Mm, this is a nice hotel.
There's a lot of

192
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,953
horny and wealthy
out-of-town businessmen.

193
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,683
This is a sexy situation.

194
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,457
And they mix in
with the normal people.

195
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,118
Well, they are normal people.

196
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,387
I don't know how normal they are.

197
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,331
Have you ever been with one?

198
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,525
Me?

199
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,291
What am I saying?

200
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,925
It's not a habit.

201
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,776
- I liked paying.
- Oh, spare me.

202
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:22,047
When you want a little dusting and
cleaning with no emotional repercussions?

203
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,572
You want to avoid rejected women
coming after you?

204
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,275
You pay for it.

205
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,045
No?

206
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,164
Did you find that waitress sexy?

207
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,830
Which one?

208
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,176
The one you were flirting with.

209
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,872
Oh come on.
I was being friendly.

210
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,649
People are usually
so rude to service people.

211
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,914
I know. So you like to be
extra nice to make up for it?

212
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,627
Did you run
to catch your plane?

213
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,423
What?

214
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,156
Well, you only missed it by a minute,
you said, so you must have run.

215
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,425
It... it was a few minutes.

216
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,339
Did you intentionally miss
the flight from New York?

217
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,807
What difference does
it make if I...

218
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,209
if I missed it by mistake or intentionally?

219
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,212
Well, because you said it was
a mistake. And it was your birthday.

220
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,839
Surprise birthday.

221
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:32,245
It was neither intentional nor
by mistake, it's just what happened.

222
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,080
Did you go out for a drink?

223
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,513
No.

224
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:13,852
What would you like?

225
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,683
I'll have a Chardonnay, please.

226
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,732
Do you want to buy me a drink?

227
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,538
What do you like?

228
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,440
What are you having?

229
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,511
Here you are.

230
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,913
Another Chardonnay
for her, please.

231
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:41,937
Sure.

232
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,881
I don't usually meet with women.

233
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:57,024
Couples, yes,
but... a single woman...

234
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,262
Thank you.

235
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,230
I think my husband would like you.

236
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,508
Do you choose his women for him?

237
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,497
No.

238
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,610
- He can't come in himself?
- No.

239
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,842
Why not?

240
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,716
What's your name?

241
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,251
It's Chloe.

242
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,958
My husband's cheating on me.

243
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,462
At least I think he is.

244
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,895
I want to find out.

245
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:47,441
See what he does
if you present yourself to him.

246
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,243
Most of my clients are married.

247
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,448
He's not the client.

248
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,694
What does he look like?

249
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,524
He's tall, strong...

250
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,999
He has chestnut hair.

251
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,270
He's very handsome.

252
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:23,277
David usually has lunch
at the Cafe Diplomatico.

253
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,676
And he's almost always reading
the newspaper.

254
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,144
If he asks
what I do for a living...

255
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,950
...what do you want me to say?

256
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,882
Say you're a student,
studying to be an interpreter.

257
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,019
Do you speak any other languages?

258
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,059
Some Japanese.

259
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,427
Okay.

260
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,967
Excuse me.

261
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,934
I'm sorry.
Can I borrow your sugar?

262
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,169
Sure.

263
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,773
Thank you.

264
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,429
Did you not recognize me?

265
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,957
I wasn't sure.

266
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,143
I saw him.

267
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,850
Just like you said,
he had his newspapers right there and

268
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,284
I went up asked him for his sugar.

269
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,985
And he pretended to
read his newspapers.

270
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:19,226
And he got up and came over to me
and asked me if I was a student.

271
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:24,132
And I said that I was studying language,
like you told me to, Japanese.

272
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,673
And he asked me if I could
say something in Japanese,

273
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:34,407
which made me blush.
And I ended up just saying, "Konichiwa."

274
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,040
And then he asked me
what my name was and I said Chloe.

275
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,413
Okay. That's okay.

276
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,549
Nothing happened.

277
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,395
Except that he approached you
and he spoke to you.

278
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,488
Pretty girl, cafe...

279
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,226
He barely flirted.
He was just friendly.

280
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,632
He's cute.

281
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,011
How do you do this?

282
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,698
I try to find something to
love in everybody.

283
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,236
Even if it's a small thing.

284
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,006
Something about
the way someone smiles.

285
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,313
There's always something.

286
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,013
There has to be.

287
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:50,718
I try to make myself generous.
I do things I don't want to do.

288
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:56,450
I think about
what not to criticize.

289
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,862
And the strangest things
come back to me.

290
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,093
Like?

291
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,395
You.

292
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,898
Me?

293
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,066
Yeah.

294
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,545
Yeah, people like you
walk into my life.

295
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,635
The money's in the envelope.

296
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,535
I want to do this one more time
just to see what he does.

297
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,278
And then we'll stop, okay?

298
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,214
Okay.

299
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:25,479
<i>Look, Michael, it's not like</i>
<i>we're engaged. Okay?</i>

300
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,485
<i>If there are other guys,</i>
<i>it's got nothing to do with you.</i>

301
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:35,223
Alright. I need to see you, okay?
This... this is weird.

302
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,128
<i>You are seeing me.</i>

303
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:41,099
I mean... I mean face-to-face.
This is... this is fucked.

304
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,626
<i>I know but, look, we are</i>
<i>face-to-face. Let's just...</i>

305
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,639
Look, people don'tjust break up
with each other out of nowhere, okay?

306
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,274
I know there's someone else.

307
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,578
<i>I just... I don't think that...</i>
<i>Graduation's coming up, you know, Michael.</i>

308
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:57,708
<i>I just... I don't want to feel</i>
<i>tied down by you or anything.</i>

309
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,917
Fuck! Mom!

310
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,062
Who were you on with?

311
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:26,166
One of my students.
We were done anyway.

312
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,309
Our little boy's being dumped.

313
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,839
How do you know?

314
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,754
I don't know
what bothers me more...

315
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,915
that he's sleeping with her
or that he isn't.

316
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,192
Did you speak to him?

317
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,057
He doesn't talk to me.

318
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,929
Catherine,
this is going to be okay.

319
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,536
I don't know how to be
his mother anymore.

320
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,527
He's going to be fine.

321
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,607
He's in therapy.
He's going to be?

322
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:59,008
Did you know his girlfriend
was sleeping over?

323
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,847
Come on.
You remember what it was like.

324
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:11,277
Hey! What do you say we...
what do you say we taste this?

325
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,925
No. I... I have a headache.

326
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,859
- Well, take an Advil.
- I did.

327
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,491
Take two.

328
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:25,803
Oh, boy.

329
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,337
Oh, nectar.

330
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,245
Thank you for the scotch.

331
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,112
And thank you
for the fecking party.

332
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,952
I love your smile.

333
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,686
No, you don't.

334
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,695
When did we stop picking
each other up at the airport?

335
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,969
I don't know.

336
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,069
And waiting for each other
at the gate?

337
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,483
Eh?

338
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,714
I'm trying to remember when...
when it happened.

339
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,688
When they upped security.

340
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,212
I'm serious.

341
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,983
I don't know.
We just got so busy.

342
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,636
What?

343
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:41,312
I've got thirty papers to read
and comment on by tomorrow.

344
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,748
Yeah. You should...
you should get to work.

345
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:44,680
Are you okay?

346
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,614
Yeah, of course.

347
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,504
Yeah, Dad...

348
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,576
It's kind of crazy,
you know, when...

349
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,113
when and I met, it was like

350
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:18,514
I've never really felt that way
about anyone. She totally just kind of,

351
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,853
I mean, you... Dad, did you
feel that way like about Mom?

352
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,186
Like, was that how
it was when you guys met?

353
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,791
I used to make you tell me that story over
and over again about how you two met.

354
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,054
She was the most beautiful woman
you'd ever seen.

355
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,631
That she was everything
that you weren't...

356
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,610
There you are.

357
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,272
Hey! They're amazing.

358
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,118
Sorry. I think...
I think I was going through some...

359
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:31,389
some weird form of insecurity
or a mid-life crisis or something

360
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,025
but let's just forget this
whole thing happened.

361
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,560
Well, I already did.

362
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,327
Forget it?

363
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,295
No. I already saw him.

364
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,231
You saw him? Where?

365
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,601
I was at the cafe and I...
I approached him like you asked me to,

366
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,169
and we went to lunch.

367
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,171
You... wait, you had lunch
with my husband?

368
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,572
Yeah, it was a picnic,
kind of.

369
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,111
We bought some sandwiches.

370
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,114
And then I asked him
about his teaching

371
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,776
and he started talking
about his music.

372
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:03,244
And he kind of stared at me.

373
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,753
And then what?

374
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,725
And then he asked me
if he could kiss me.

375
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,257
I didn't ask you to do that.

376
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,902
But then he said he could not
kiss me because he's married.

377
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,874
You see?
At first he was hesitant.

378
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,239
At first?

379
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:34,018
And then he asked me
if there was somewhere

380
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,820
he could kiss me where
no one would see us.

381
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,946
And...

382
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,925
I said to him that we
should go to Allen Gardens.

383
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:45,624
You know that place down the street
with the big... big greenhouse?

384
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,104
Do you want me to stop?

385
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,170
No.

386
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:05,608
We walked through this big long
corridor with all these exotic flowers.

387
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,284
There was nobody around.

388
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,757
I love Allen Gardens.

389
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,354
It's always so warm.

390
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,423
And the airjust feels
so beautiful.

391
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,664
It's like you're suddenly
in a different country.

392
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,601
I knew there's a place in the back,
where they keep tools and stuff.

393
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,931
No one ever goes to
that section.

394
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,311
It's like a secret hiding place.

395
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,182
He brought his mouth up
to my lips

396
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,582
and we hovered there
for a long time.

397
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,023
I could feel he was
excited through his pants.

398
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,251
That's enough.

399
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,101
You were supposed to meet up
with my husband

400
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:00,434
and see what he did and
then report back to me.

401
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,233
I don't really know
what you want.

402
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,108
I shouldn't have involved
you in this. I made a mistake.

403
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,729
Damn it!

404
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,106
God, I'm so sorry. I was just
trying to get out of this spot.

405
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,301
Is your...
is your bumper okay?

406
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,610
I'm sorry. Would you mind
moving up just a little?

407
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,718
Ow!

408
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,069
Do you carry that bag
with you in the car?

409
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,038
Uh huh. You never know
when you might need it.

410
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,032
Actually, let's not cut it.
Sorry.

411
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:11,938
I'm...

412
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,237
I'm going to take them off.

413
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:32,020
Just hold that to stop the
bleeding, okay?

414
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,304
I'm sorry.

415
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,618
You think it will scar?

416
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,746
No. It shouldn't.

417
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:15,062
We were hidden, deep in this
forest of exotic plants and trees.

418
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,577
And we could hear voices
in the distance

419
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,410
but we were pretty sure no one
could actually see us.

420
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:27,914
And I pushed my hand down
his pants and felt him.

421
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:42,229
And then I...
I moved my hand lightly on him.

422
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,538
Right.

423
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,580
And then I kept doing this.

424
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,348
Moving my hand on him
in his pants.

425
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,511
And he said to me, "I can't come.
I can't come. I have to go to work."

426
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,249
But I didn't stop.

427
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,055
And then I bit his tongue.

428
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,334
And then...
just then he came in my hand.

429
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,107
And then what?

430
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,541
And then he had to go to work
so he walked away.

431
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,130
I don't want to be rude.

432
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,497
Uh... I want you...

433
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,104
I want you to be clean.

434
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,272
I mean,
I... I know you are clean...

435
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,440
Oh, I... no,
I... I've got tests...

436
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,844
All of them, like HIV, STDs,

437
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,846
and then show me the results.

438
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,507
Okay. Yeah.

439
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,518
Can I help you?

440
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,420
I'm looking for Catherine.

441
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,217
Dr. Stewart is in with a patient.
When's your appointment?

442
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,953
I don't have one.
She and I are friends.

443
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,697
Okay. Well,
she should be out soon.

444
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,001
Would you like to sit down?

445
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,093
Okay.

446
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,813
Hi, Michael.

447
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,290
Your mom's still in with a patient.

448
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,591
I just need to pick up my tux.

449
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,719
It's in her office.
Exciting recital tonight, huh?

450
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,387
Yeah.

451
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,631
I need to copy some music.

452
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,068
Your mom is Dr. Stewart?

453
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,303
My mother's your gynaecologist?

454
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,105
You look like her.

455
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,263
Me?

456
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,477
No, I don't...
I don't think so.

457
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,968
Yeah. The same look in your eyes.

458
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,413
I mean, not really the colour
or the shape but... the look.

459
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,423
And your lips, too.

460
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,195
I'm Chloe Sweeney.

461
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,994
Oh, Michael Stewart.

462
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,501
Nice to meet you.

463
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,862
Are you a musician?

464
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,101
No, it's just...

465
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,368
just what you're
supposed to do, I guess.

466
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,603
Study music.

467
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:33,717
I wish someone had
have given me lessons.

468
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,812
I love music.

469
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,344
Classical?

470
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,015
Raised by Swans.

471
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,829
You never heard of the band
Raised by Swans?

472
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,925
Um, no.

473
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,362
You'd like them.

474
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,527
I think you'd really like them.

475
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,014
That's it for
my appointments, right?

476
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,345
Uh huh.

477
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,585
Mannie's Motors called.
Your tune-up's finished.

478
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,285
Okay.

479
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,653
Alicia called about lunch at two.

480
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,387
Right. Right.

481
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,923
And your son is
in the back making copies.

482
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,117
Oh.

483
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,855
Hi, Doctor.

484
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,462
Here you go.
Full work up.

485
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,428
Okay. Thank you
for bringing them by.

486
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,497
Can I talk to you?

487
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:32,831
No, I can't. I'm jammed.
If you could call and...

488
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,313
Yeah. Quickly.

489
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,016
That's my son.

490
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,728
You didn't speak to him,
did you?

491
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,162
I came to tell you
about this afternoon.

492
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,924
It's today.

493
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,257
Today?

494
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,461
Yeah. After lunch. Okay?

495
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,212
You got my tux?

496
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,878
Thanks.

497
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:17,888
I'm excited.

498
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,185
About what?

499
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,659
About tonight.
About seeing you play.

500
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,253
I put a... I put a good luck
note in yourjacket.

501
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,590
Okay.

502
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,493
Thanks, Mom.

503
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:30,964
You said it.

504
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,110
She says she lies in bed
night after night

505
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,179
and tries to imagine a life
where she only sees her kids

506
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,915
every other week and she says
that she can't do it.

507
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,349
So she's staying with him.

508
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,045
At this point, apparently,
she's just surviving.

509
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,754
Maybe she'll ask him
if he'll go to couples therapy...

510
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,072
Who was that?

511
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:13,870
A patient.

512
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,479
What's going on with you?

513
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,741
Nothing.

514
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:24,188
Listen, I understand. Especially
with missing flights, busy on his?

515
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,789
David is fine.
We worked it out.

516
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,058
He missed his flight,
that's all.

517
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,160
He's not the most
organized man in the world.

518
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,663
No. I'm talking about you.

519
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,130
Who have you met?

520
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:38,125
Me? No. No.
Oh, gawd, no.

521
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,904
You have affair written
all over you.

522
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:48,979
I have this pregnant patient
who panics every time she gets a kick

523
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:52,813
or a cramp because, really,
she's terrified about being a mother.

524
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,051
So I've decided to hold
her hand through this.

525
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,922
But I really need...
I need to call her back.

526
00:45:58,922 --> 00:45:59,990
We're finished, right?

527
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,651
- Uh huh.
- Okay.

528
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,951
Thanks for lunch. Bye.

529
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:43,426
Hello?

530
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,232
No. No. Not there.

531
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,837
Sit in that chair.

532
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,917
Okay...

533
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,143
Go ahead.

534
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,187
We met in the park again.

535
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,966
This time he
didn't bring sandwiches.

536
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,934
We checked into this room.

537
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:57,441
He put on the news,
pretended to be interested.

538
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,409
I sat down next to him.

539
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:06,072
He turned and looked at me.
Kissed me.

540
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,076
Whispered, "Let's fuck."

541
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,557
Jesus.

542
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:26,068
He couldn't get it up.
We tried a few times.

543
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,829
He was really embarrassed.

544
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:32,643
But I told him it didn't
really matter, that I liked it.

545
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:36,909
That it meant that we could
just wait a little bit longer.

546
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:41,343
And at that point he was fully dressed.
I was completely naked.

547
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,787
Does this turn you on?

548
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,627
He wanted to stay dressed.

549
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,495
He sat right over there on
that bench.

550
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,910
He told me to get
between his legs.

551
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:20,083
I put him in my mouth
and then he got hard.

552
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,860
Are you okay?

553
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,231
I think I'm coming down
with something.

554
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,664
Did you see a doctor?

555
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:41,635
No. It's nothing.
I'm taking zinc.

556
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,244
Did he come in your mouth?

557
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,744
No.

558
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:56,184
I pulled him out of me,
put a rubber on him.

559
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,093
I straddled him.

560
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:12,040
And... he came almost immediately
after he entered me.

561
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,382
I put my tits in his face.

562
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,314
Okay...

563
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,646
Oh, well...

564
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,111
Do you want to count it?

565
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,243
No, it's okay.

566
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,861
Do you think the zinc really works?

567
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,599
If you take it early enough, yeah.

568
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,054
What kind of perfume is that?

569
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,718
It's lotion.

570
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:13,524
Here.

571
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,535
We used to go everything together.

572
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,368
We couldn't stand to be apart.

573
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,603
Even for an hour.

574
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,383
We'd sit and wait for each other
outside of appointments

575
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:37,547
just loving those moments of waiting
until we could finally see each other again.

576
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,016
Touch each other.

577
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:43,822
I loved his hands.

578
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,096
They used to grab me everywhere.

579
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,226
It used to be that way.

580
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,992
I used to be younger.

581
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:58,035
Have you ever had
that with anyone?

582
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,769
Yeah.

583
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,681
Do you still love him?

584
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,514
I don't know.

585
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,598
And one more thing.

586
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,775
He said it's the first time
he's ever done this.

587
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,470
Well, that's a line.

588
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,617
Jesus.

589
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:46,080
I don't know whether to be relieved
orjust go hang myself.

590
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,359
Fuck.

591
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,949
I can't... I can't...

592
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,301
Bravo!

593
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,272
Bravo!

594
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,899
Congratulations.

595
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,298
On?

596
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,065
Your beautiful son.

597
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,005
He's you.

598
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,735
No, he's you. You know that.

599
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:27,341
What is that?

600
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,111
You're wearing perfume.

601
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,378
It's lotion.

602
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,018
I like it.

603
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,555
Professor Stewart!

604
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,331
Madeleine. How are you?

605
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:41,854
Good.

606
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,456
How does he do it?

607
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,593
What?

608
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,623
Touch you.

609
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,893
Aw, God...

610
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,263
You can stop here.

611
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,140
- This is where you live?
- Uh huh.

612
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:50,974
Which one is your house?

613
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,806
It's back there.

614
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,249
This is to take her home.

615
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,122
Please don't see
my husband again.

616
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,590
Hold on. I...

617
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,233
I have something for you.

618
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:25,181
I want...
I want you to have this.

619
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,783
No. I told you, that's yours.

620
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:30,344
No. This is...
this used to be my mother's.

621
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,582
And I want you to have it.

622
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,959
Did you drop this on purpose?

623
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,097
I wanted to talk to you.

624
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,704
I have to go.

625
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,771
Do you want to see me again?

626
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,122
I don't know. I... We work
in the same neighbourhood.

627
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:08,420
I'll see you on the street, right?

628
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,561
You'll see me on the street?

629
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,791
I didn't mean it that way.
I mean, itjust...

630
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,859
That came out wrong.

631
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,733
I'm just...
I'm exhausted.

632
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,117
Who is it?

633
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,923
Are you in love?

634
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,838
If I were,
would it make a difference?

635
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,829
Of course it would
make a difference.

636
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,241
Are you in love?

637
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:33,943
You've been out all night.
Now I'm under interrogation.

638
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:36,312
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I forgot.

639
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,114
You're a lot more discreet
with your women.

640
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:40,483
You don't come home late
'cause you have it down with them.

641
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,019
I like women. I appreciate
their beauty, their intelligence.

642
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,687
That does not mean
I'm screwing them.

643
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,857
How do you think I feel
when I come into your office

644
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,992
and you're instant messaging
with a student?

645
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:53,029
I make myself available to my students.
That's how I gain their trust!

646
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,831
- That's how I teach!
- Oh, God!

647
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,632
- You won't admit it.
- Admit what?

648
01:03:56,632 --> 01:04:01,137
Do you know that you flirt with every single
goddamn woman you come into contact with?

649
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,039
For all I know you
could be fucking them all!

650
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,529
I'm not having an affair!

651
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,039
Stop it!

652
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,500
Go to your room!

653
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:11,380
You're telling me to
go to my room?

654
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,449
Michael, just leave us alone
for a minute.

655
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,817
You can't control me!

656
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,419
Michael! That's enough.

657
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,853
I can't wait to
get the fuck out of here.

658
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,899
I was held up at the hospital.

659
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:06,323
Are you okay?

660
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,230
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

661
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:15,211
There was an urgent call from Mrs. Beatrice.
She's concerned about her hormone therapy.

662
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,078
Okay.

663
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,281
Mrs. Car has a
yeast infection again.

664
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,079
Uh huh. Okay.

665
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:26,277
And these just came for you.
And there's an urgent e-mail as well.

666
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,718
I'll be right there.

667
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,994
I'm so sorry.

668
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,302
Oh my God.

669
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:04,794
<i>This is Chloe.</i>

670
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,159
Where are you?

671
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,594
<i>I'm in your waiting room.</i>
<i>Didn't you see me when you came in?</i>

672
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,373
Smell them.

673
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,412
What are you doing?

674
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,772
I'm sorry.

675
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,254
No.

676
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,792
I'm sorry.

677
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:42,328
Why?

678
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:47,794
You're amazing.

679
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,065
You're so beautiful.

680
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,211
But we've taken this as far as
I want it to go.

681
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:11,818
I liked it. Last night.

682
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:18,160
Yeah, I liked it, too.
I can't say that I didn't.

683
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,396
I don't want this to be over.

684
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,510
And I don't think
that you want it to be, either.

685
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,068
You want money?

686
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,144
It's not about money.

687
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:41,318
You accepted money from me,
so when did this not become about money?

688
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,499
Okay. Now...

689
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:02,239
This should
take care of everything.

690
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:13,618
This isn't a business thing.
This was so real and you know that.

691
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,125
What about last night?
I touched you and I?

692
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,726
How do I get through to you?

693
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:23,028
This business transaction,
which... which is what this was, is over.

694
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:29,195
Now, please,
you have got to get out of here.

695
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:35,837
Come on.

696
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,277
Come on.

697
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:47,652
I'm so sorry...

698
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:28,219
Right here! Right here!

699
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,058
Come on, right here.
Pass it! Pass!

700
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:34,770
- Come on!
- Stewart!

701
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,273
- Two minutes, tripping.
- You gotta be kidding me!

702
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,433
Shit!

703
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,604
Hey!

704
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:46,908
Hey.

705
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:52,248
I bought you that CD that we
talked about... Raised by Swans. Swans.

706
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,719
Thanks.

707
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,923
What?

708
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:03,522
I... I downloaded all their
albums already.

709
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:08,670
But you didn't download
the case or the artwork...

710
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:14,172
or the CD that you can keep forever
and hold in your hands.

711
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,218
I hate the Internet.

712
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:26,184
Nothing is private.

713
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:29,314
Nothing is real.
Like this... me meeting you here.

714
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,425
The penalty box.

715
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,756
Do you have a page?

716
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:37,496
No.

717
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,897
Yes. Yeah.

718
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,069
I know. I saw it.

719
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,640
That's how I knew
that you had a game today.

720
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:48,503
Nice picture.

721
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:50,868
I don't really photograph well.

722
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:54,814
Yeah, you do.
I like that picture of your mom.

723
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,680
There's... there's not a picture
of my mom on there.

724
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,821
Isn't she in the background
when you're getting that award?

725
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:03,481
Yeah, but she's out of focus.

726
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,524
Yeah, she is.

727
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,456
I notice everything.

728
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,134
I'll see you.

729
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:29,213
# We were young

730
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,321
# Like the universe...

731
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:33,515
Michael?

732
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:38,090
# Like our mother's work

733
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,028
# Like these words...

734
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,630
Michael?

735
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,823
- Mom?
- Jesus!

736
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,593
Where'd you get this music?

737
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:21,170
- From the store.
- Did you talk to that girl?

738
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,671
- What girl?
- In my office?

739
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,872
What are you talking about?

740
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:26,208
Is she here? Where is she?

741
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:29,177
What the fuck are you do...
Are you fucking insane?

742
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:37,476
I don't know. I don't...

743
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:39,421
I don't know.
Oh, my God.

744
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:43,016
Ah, I don't know.
I'm sorry, honey. I'm...

745
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,793
<i>I told you not to call my husband.</i>

746
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:56,635
I didn't call your husband.
He called me.

747
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:02,775
I... I wouldn't...
I would never contact him.

748
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:08,210
He... when he called it was
like there was...

749
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,317
it wasn't about sex.

750
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,812
It was something
emotional vulnerable.

751
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:19,084
<i>He said that</i>
<i>when he touches you...</i>

752
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:23,124
...he feels like he's
cheating on me.

753
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,591
<i>Isn't that crazy?</i>

754
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:28,970
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

755
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,073
Catherine?

756
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:40,606
Meet me in an hour
at the Cafe Diplomatico.

757
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:53,195
What's going on?

758
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,263
You want to order?

759
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,364
I'm chairing Orals.

760
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,956
This is not going to take long.

761
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:01,103
Coffee, please.

762
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,471
I'm having Cognac.

763
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:04,336
Hennessy for my wife.

764
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:10,711
What is this?

765
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:14,441
I wanted to give each other
a chance to lay things out straight.

766
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,748
I want to tell
each other everything.

767
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,319
The truth.

768
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,818
Is there something
that you want to tell me?

769
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:25,894
Me?

770
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,657
Just tell me.

771
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,924
About New York?

772
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,559
Okay.

773
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,307
I lied.

774
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,514
I didn't want to have a birthday.

775
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:49,518
I didn't want to have another year
closer to retirement. So I stayed.

776
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:52,282
I had a drink.
I had three.

777
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,957
You went and had a drink
with Miranda.

778
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,725
- Oh...
- You did.

779
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,527
- You listened to my messages.
- What did you do with her?

780
01:14:58,527 --> 01:14:59,428
Now you're spying on me.

781
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:01,363
You know, I planned
your party for months.

782
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:03,932
I secretly call each and
every one of our friends.

783
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:08,537
I... I... I spend thousands of dollars
on a cake, a caterer and flowers.

784
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:10,439
I act like some superhuman
housewife and

785
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,875
you're screwing an eighteen-year-old
because I am a fucking idiot.

786
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,977
I didn't screw her.
I flirted with her.

787
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,911
You are so full of shit.

788
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,915
What?

789
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,426
What?

790
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,391
What? Who was that girl?

791
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:45,400
Hm?

792
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,070
Nobody.

793
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:55,876
She was nobody.

794
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:07,525
It's over.

795
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:11,531
That's it?

796
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:12,791
Yes.

797
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,195
Well, wait a minute. You...

798
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:20,008
you came here to lay the cards
on the table.

799
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,511
I'm the only one
who's admitted anything.

800
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:25,180
I can't explain it.
It was... it was so sudden.

801
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,983
It was so unexpected
and it's over now.

802
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:29,451
And I'm supposed to be
happy about that?

803
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:32,421
I'm supposed to be happy you had
your little mid-life crisis fling?

804
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,218
It wasn't a fling.

805
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,227
Jesus, Catherine.

806
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,800
How many times have
I been tempted?

807
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,935
And I never did anything about it.
Never once.

808
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:48,537
No. But you wanted to.

809
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:52,074
I'm human! Could you say
you'd been any different?

810
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:54,843
I have never, ever wanted to be
with anybody else.

811
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,640
You're lying to me.

812
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,777
You're fucking lying.

813
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,346
You took me from work.

814
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:12,287
And you brought me all the way down
here to be honest with each other.

815
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,019
You've told me nothing.

816
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,769
Wait!

817
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:29,771
David!

818
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,977
Wait...

819
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:34,209
Sorry, pal.

820
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:38,186
I'll tell you. She said
that her name was Chloe.

821
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:39,278
What?

822
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:43,191
A girl. I asked her to do something.
To tempt you.

823
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:46,294
I wanted to see what you were doing
because I thought you were having an affair.

824
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:48,897
- I'm not cheating, Catherine...
- I know. I know that now.

825
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,933
I know, but at the time
she said she slept with you.

826
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:54,169
- This is ridiculous.
- She took my money

827
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,467
and she lied about sex with you.

828
01:17:56,605 --> 01:18:00,905
And I'd meet up with her and
she'd tell me... she'd tell every detail.

829
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:03,478
Like what?

830
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,002
Stories.

831
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:09,147
She said that it started
with a picnic in the park.

832
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,682
At Allen Gardens
in the conservatory.

833
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:18,223
She said she kissed you and
she could feel you getting excited.

834
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:22,998
It was... It was confusing.

835
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:28,300
Itjust... But it made me feel
closer to you.

836
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:32,438
You become more beautiful
every year.

837
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:36,775
Every... every grey hair,
every line.

838
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:39,481
Everything that happens to you

839
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,050
makes you so much more desirable
and I feel like

840
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,746
if you were to blow on me
I'd vanish.

841
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,578
I'd disappear.

842
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:51,147
I felt so invisible
and so old.

843
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,699
I slept with her.

844
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:10,641
You and I used to make love
three times a day.

845
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,314
And then every day.

846
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,149
And then once a week.

847
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:19,254
And then was born and then we
became parents and we were best friends.

848
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:23,054
And I didn't know how to go from
being your best friend to being your lover.

849
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,527
You stopped touching me.

850
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:28,096
David, I couldn't
look at myself.

851
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,428
I didn't know who I was.

852
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,401
I think I'm nineteen and
then I look in the mirror and

853
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:38,703
I'm this person that doesn't know
how to seduce you.

854
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:31,651
So show me around the house.

855
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:48,837
I don't want to leave you but
I'm late and they're going to kill me at school.

856
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:51,499
I'll still be here.
I'll wait for you at home.

857
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:56,169
I'm sorry.
For not trusting you.

858
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:01,946
Hurry home.

859
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,891
Where's your parents' room?

860
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:19,626
It's... it's upstairs.

861
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,223
What are you doing?

862
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,822
Look at me.

863
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,323
Look at me.

864
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:56,589
Look at me.

865
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:18,586
...to tell the story.

866
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:21,555
Historical transposition is
tremendously complex and...

867
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,190
Michael?

868
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,595
Shit! Shit!

869
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:03,795
Come on.

870
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,067
Michael, get out of here.

871
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:08,937
Come on. Let's go!

872
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,029
Michael...

873
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:13,007
You... you think that
you can buy me

874
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,777
and I'm just going to go away,
just like that?

875
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,513
Did you think that you could
just put money in my hand and I would...

876
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,415
and I would go and
take care of myself?

877
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:22,383
Michael. Michael,
I don't want you to hear this.

878
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:24,185
Come on. Get out.
Get out. Get out now.

879
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:25,482
Please go!

880
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,280
I don't want you near my son.

881
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:31,192
Mom!

882
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:33,495
He's not yours.
Your husband isn't yours.

883
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:37,332
I'm not yours. We're notjust
here to do as you say.

884
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:40,235
When... when you pay us and
when you want us and...

885
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:43,438
and when to dispose of us.

886
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,740
I understand I did this.
I brought you into my marriage.

887
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,909
But you need to
stay away from him.

888
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:50,776
I felt you in him.

889
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:52,981
- In his eyes.
- Mom!

890
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:56,610
In the tiny little things
that he does.

891
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:59,587
I actually think that
he could be, like...

892
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:01,723
he could be a good boy
for me to start dating.

893
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,258
My husband's going to be
home any minute.

894
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:05,593
David... it's fine then
with David, huh?

895
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:07,962
Is it working out for you?
I did my job.

896
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:10,598
Let me get you dressed and
I'll drive you home

897
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:12,896
and we can talk there,
all right?

898
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:26,106
You liked it.

899
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,313
I'm sorry I misled you.

900
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:36,454
No, you're not.

901
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:37,659
Excuse me?

902
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:39,422
No, you're not sorry.

903
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:45,099
You shared your secrets with me.

904
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:45,867
Okay...

905
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,735
We made our own
little world together.

906
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:49,737
And you didn't say no to
anything about me.

907
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:51,072
You made me fall in
love with you!

908
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:52,307
I didn't mean for
that to happen.

909
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:54,309
I felt something but it was
always for my husband.

910
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,711
You wouldn't have your husband back
if it weren't for me.

911
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:57,905
Come on. Let's go home.

912
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:02,911
How can you be doing this to me?
Or am I worth nothing to you?

913
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:05,112
God.

914
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,717
You're bleeding. Please.
Please let me take you home.

915
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,957
Please stop.

916
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:14,424
Uh...

917
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:20,028
You're beautiful.

918
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:21,897
You must know that.

919
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:23,970
You really are.

920
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:29,602
Tell me...
tell me what you want.

921
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:36,509
I want you to kiss me.

922
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:47,996
No!

923
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:49,361
Oh, my God!

924
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,193
Catherine!
