1
00:00:00,776 --> 00:00:03,578
The substance burns so hot,
it melts wood,

2
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:05,581
stone, even steel.

3
00:00:05,615 --> 00:00:07,983
<i>And, of course, flesh.</i>

4
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:10,152
If I could tell you
how many crazy old men

5
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:13,356
I've seen making grand claims
about jars full of pig shit.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,759
Our order does not deal
in pig shit.

7
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:18,261
King Stannis is my God.
He raised me up

8
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:20,731
and gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

9
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:23,400
And you think a Fire God
commanded all that?

10
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:26,237
- It was Stannis.
- Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

11
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:28,073
Don't tell him that.

12
00:00:28,107 --> 00:00:30,008
Does it give you joy
to scare people?

13
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:32,311
No, it gives me joy
to kill people.

14
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:34,546
Killing's the sweetest
thing there is.

15
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:37,082
You shipped off my only daughter
and now you want

16
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,619
to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

17
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:41,220
He needs to be out there.

18
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:43,355
The men will fight more
fiercely seeing their king

19
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,826
fighting beside them instead of
hiding behind his mother's skirts.

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,530
Stannis two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

21
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:52,832
Scouts assure us Robb Stark
won't risk

22
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:55,735
marching on Casterly Rock
until he's at full force.

23
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:57,603
He'll risk anything
at any time.

24
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:59,505
<i>We'll ride at nightfall.</i>

25
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:02,774
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

26
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,969
My dear nephew,
you do understand Stannis

27
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,511
Baratheon sails this way?

28
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:10,582
They say Stannis never smiles.
I'll give him a red smile.

29
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:14,319
If the wind holds, we'll reach
King's Landing in a day.

30
00:01:14,353 --> 00:01:15,754
Will it hold?

31
00:01:15,788 --> 00:01:18,123
Can't make promises
for the wind, Your Grace.

32
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:20,192
Stannis knows King's Landing.

33
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:22,361
He knows where
the walls are strongest

34
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:25,131
and he knows which gates
are weakest.

35
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:28,167
Mud gate.
That's where he'll land.

36
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:32,971
And if Stannis does attack
the mud gate, what do we have?

37
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:43,915


38
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,940

00:01:51,990 --> 00:03:25,150


41
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,007
<i>That's it.</i>

42
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:04,649
The tide's against us.

43
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:06,251
Aye, but we have
the wind.

44
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,987
She'll blow us
straight to the gate.

45
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:10,455
You're coming home.

46
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,125
King's Landing hasn't
been home for 20 years.

47
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,997
I spent most of my life
dodging the Royal Fleet.

48
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:23,301
And now I'm sailing
right at them.

49
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,470
This is the Royal Fleet.

50
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,472
And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.

51
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:30,742
Of course there are several
Royal Fleets at the moment.

52
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:33,345
Not after tonight.
When the sun rises,

53
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:35,413
Stannis will sit
on the Iron Throne

54
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:36,848
and you will be his Hand.

55
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:39,184
- Gods be good.
- God.

56
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:41,286
Father, there is only one
and he watches over us.

57
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,022
- But not over them?
- Over all of us.

58
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:46,122
The people of King's Landing
did not choose the false King

59
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:47,659
Joffrey Baratheon.

60
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,228
They will be glad to see
his head on a spike.

61
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,865
Well, first we have
to put it there.

62
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:55,434
Our ships outnumber
theirs 10 to one.

63
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,570
Our army outnumber
theirs five to one.

64
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,838
Those walls have
never been breached.

65
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:02,040
And the men
guarding the walls,

66
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:05,044
when they see you,
they don't see a liberator.

67
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:08,414
They see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.

68
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:11,149
I have faith
in the Lord of Light.

69
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:13,085
I have faith
in our cause.

70
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,255
And I have faith
in my captain.

71
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:53,226
Are you afraid, my lion?

72
00:06:57,397 --> 00:07:02,400
If the city falls, Stannis will
burn every Lannister he can find.

73
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:06,537
Of course I'm afraid.

74
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:11,141
I won't let
them hurt you.

75
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:17,481
I'm a Lannister.

76
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:21,184
I don't have
a choice in all this.

77
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,320
But it's not your war.

78
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,561
It is now.

79
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:38,802
You can't fuck your way
out of everything.

80
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:41,973
I have so far.

81
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:48,180
Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?

82
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,595
That I should make love
to you like it was your

83
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,520
last day on this earth.

84
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:08,697
<i>As you know, Your Grace,</i>

85
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:11,366
it is not only
the sworn duty of a Maester

86
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:14,771
to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,

87
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:17,574
but also to offer guidance

88
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:20,844
and counsel
in times of war.

89
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:23,280
Your words are always
wise and measured.

90
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:25,783
- If you could--
- If anything,

91
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:29,888
a Maester's duties
become more urgent

92
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:34,425
in times of war
and turmoil.

93
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,796
I remember back
in the days of king--

94
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,531
You brought me something?

95
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,700
Yes.

96
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:47,407
Essence of Nightshade

97
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:52,345
is as dangerous
as it is efficacious.

98
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,847
A single drop
in a cup of wine

99
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:59,018
suffices to soothe
ragged nerves.

100
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:01,820
<i>Three drops</i>
<i>will bring on a deep</i>

101
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:04,789
<i>and dreamless sleep.</i>

102
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:06,557
<i>10 drops, however--</i>

103
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:08,826
I know what 10 drops
will bring.

104
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,896
- Your Grace, if I may ask--
- You may not.

105
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,867
You must have
a lot of work to do.

106
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:19,903
I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.

107
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:24,208
Yes.
A siege is very--

108
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,810
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
There are so many.

109
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:31,415

Drunk Lannisters.

121
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:13,858
You've got
a pretty voice.

122
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:15,726
Thank you very much.

123
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:17,228
And I like
your nose.

124
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:20,197
How many times
you break it?

125
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,768
Well, now let's see.

126
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:27,505
<i>First time I was five.</i>

127
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,314
Me mom smacked me
with an iron poker.

128
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,841
Ooh.

129
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:33,143
Oh, it wasn't me
she was aiming at.

130
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:35,212
She was trying
for me little brother.

131
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:36,880
Now he was a real pest.

132
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:40,817
Second time I was nine.

133
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:43,953
Got in a scrap
with a few older boys.

134
00:10:43,988 --> 00:10:46,189
They won.

135
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:47,824
Third time...

136
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:58,168
Eh, you don't want to know
about the third time.

137
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,841
Poor nose.

138
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,677
Don't feel sorry
for him.

139
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:07,913
He'll be halfway up your ass
before the night's through.

140
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,594
Welcome, friends.

141
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:27,299
This round's on me.

142
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:38,778
I don't think
he likes me.

143
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:53,726
You think
you're a hard man?

144
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:59,166
I know it.

145
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:04,604
It's warm in here.

146
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,640
We've got beautiful women

147
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:08,308
and good brown ale.

148
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:11,311
Plenty for everyone.

149
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:13,046
And all you want

150
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,082
is to put one of us
in the cold ground

151
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:18,018
with no women
to keep us company.

152
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:20,987
Oh, there's women
in the ground.

153
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:23,656
I put some there myself.

154
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:26,859
So have you.

155
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,328
You like fucking
and drinking

156
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:31,230
and singing.

157
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:35,801
But killing--

158
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:38,670
killing's the thing
you love.

159
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:41,773
You're just like me.

160
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:46,610
Only smaller.

161
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:50,280
And quicker.

162
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:53,183
Eh?

163
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:57,354
Your Lord Imp
is gonna miss you.

164
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:05,998
Aye.

165
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,870
I expect he will someday.

166
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:17,343
<i>Here we are.</i>

167
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:30,655
One more drink
before the war?

168
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:32,790
Shall we?

169
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:46,102
I've always
hated the bells.

170
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:47,937
They ring for horror--

171
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:50,640
a dead king,
a city under siege.

172
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:52,876
- A wedding.
- Exactly.

173
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:56,915
Podrick, is that it?

174
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,284
"Is that it?"
Nice touch.

175
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:02,788
As if you don't know the name
of every boy in town.

176
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:05,525
I'm not entirely sure
what you're suggesting.

177
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,995
I'm entirely sure you're entirely
sure what I'm suggesting.

178
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,564
Do you trust him?

179
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,769
Oddly enough, I do.

180
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:19,905
Good.

181
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:27,211
The map you asked for.

182
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,052
There must be 20 miles
of tunnels beneath the city.

183
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,787
Closer to 50.

184
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:39,491
<i>The Targaryens built this</i>
<i>city to withstand a siege</i>

185
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:43,262
and to provide escape
if necessary.

186
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:45,231
I'm not escaping.

187
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:47,233
Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of the ship.

188
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:48,935
And if the ship goes down,
I go with her.

189
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:50,804
That is good to hear.

190
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:52,972
Though I'm sure many
captains say the same

191
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:56,476
while their ship
is afloat.

192
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,245
You look well suited
for battle, My Lord.

193
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,647
Well, I'm not.

194
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:03,616
For all our sakes,
I hope you are wrong.

195
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,753
My little birds tell me
that Stannis Baratheon

196
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:11,323
has taken up with a Red
Priestess from Asshai.

197
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:12,691
What of it?

198
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:16,229
You don't believe in
the old powers, My Lord?

199
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:19,432
Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting--
what do you think?

200
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:24,003
I think you believe
in what you see

201
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:26,806
and in what those
you trust have seen.

202
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,943
You probably don't
entirely trust me.

203
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,878
Mm, don't take it
personally.

204
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,847
I don't entirely
trust myself.

205
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:37,716
And yet I have seen things

206
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,385
<i>and heard things--</i>

207
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:45,088
things you have not,
things I wish I had not.

208
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,760
I don't believe I've ever
told you how I was cut.

209
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:54,364
No, I don't believe
you have.

210
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,203
One day I will.

211
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:03,809
The dark arts have provided
Lord Stannis with his armies

212
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:07,146
and paved his path
to our door.

213
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:11,384
For a man in service to such
powers to sit on the Iron Throne,

214
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,787
I can think
of nothing worse.

215
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:16,288
And tonight,

216
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:20,592
I believe you are the only man
who can stop him.

217
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,156
They're welcoming
the new king.

218
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,025
I've never known bells
to mean surrender.

219
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,295
They want to play
music with us? Let's play.

220
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:58,230
- Drums.
- Drums!

221
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:24,790
<i>Remember, wait till the shit--</i>

222
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,726
<i>The ships are in the bay.</i>

223
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,113
They must be far enough
in so they won't be--

224
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:29,763
I know what "in" means.

225
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:32,132
- Do you know how to use that?
- I chopped wood once.

226
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,601
No, I watched my brother
chopping wood.

227
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:36,502
I saw you kill a man
with a shield.

228
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:38,438
You'll be unstoppable
with an axe.

229
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,275
- Don't get killed.
- Nor you, my friend.

230
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,679
- Oh, are we friends now?
- Of course we are.

231
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:47,419
Just because I pay you
for your services doesn't

232
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:48,748
diminish our friendship.

233
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:50,216
Enhances it, really.

234
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,019
Oh, enhances.
Fancy word for a sellsword.

235
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:55,887
Been spending time
with fancy folks.

236
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:10,167
Lady Sansa
and, uh, Sheila.

237
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,836
Shae.

238
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,438
Shae, yes.

239
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,573
Surely my sister
has asked you to join

240
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,242
the other highborn ladies
in Maegor's holdfast.

241
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:18,666
She has, My Lord,

242
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:20,812
but King Joffrey sent
for me to see him off.

243
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:23,049
Sansa.

244
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,251
He's been a great
romantic, my nephew.

245
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:27,186
<i>Sansa, come here.</i>

246
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,957
I will pray for your
safe return, My Lord.

247
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:33,492
Will you?

248
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:36,028
Just as I pray
for the King's.

249
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,767
Stay safe, My Lady.

250
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:43,935
And you, my lion.

251
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:52,009
Your king rides forth
to battle.

252
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:54,979
You should see him
off with a kiss.

253
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,248
My new blade.

254
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,050
Hearteater I've named it.

255
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:03,121
Kiss it.

256
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,665
You'll kiss it again
when I return

257
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,634
and taste
my Uncle's blood.

258
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:18,435
Will you slay him
yourself?

259
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:21,905
If Stannis is fool enough
to come near me.

260
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,941
So you'll be outside the gates
fighting in the Vanguard?

261
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:27,710
A king doesn't discuss

262
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:30,146
battle plans
with stupid girls.

263
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,116
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
You're right, I'm stupid.

264
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,352
Of course you'll be
in the Vanguard.

265
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:37,354
They say my brother
Robb always goes

266
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:39,056
where the fighting
is thickest.

267
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,891
And he is only
a pretender.

268
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:43,528
Your brother's turn
will come.

269
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:46,531
Then you can lick his blood
off Hearteater, too.

270
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:01,479
Some of those boys
will never come back.

271
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:03,648
Joffrey will.

272
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:05,416
The worst ones
always live.

273
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,452
Shh.
Come, My Lady.

274
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:59,476
- Where's our fleet?
- On the way.

275
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:02,924
Why isn't it here now?
They're coming.

276
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,282
Hound, tell the Hand that his
King has asked him a question.

277
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:09,351
The King has asked
you a question.

278
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:11,820
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound
to tell the king

279
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,655
that the Hand
is extremely busy.

280
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,465
The Hand of the King
would like me to tell

281
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,858
you to tell the King--

282
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,593
If I tell the Hound
to cut you in half,

283
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,161
he'll do it without
a second thought.

284
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,996
That would make me
the Quarterman.

285
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,065
It just doesn't have
the same ring to it.

286
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,901
Cut me in half and I won't
be able to give the signal.

287
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:29,569
<i>No signal, no plan.</i>

288
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:31,643
No plan and Stannis
Baratheon sacks this city,

289
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:34,516
takes the Iron Throne,
puts your pinched

290
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:36,064
little head atop
a gate somewhere.

291
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,679
It might be quite amusing,

292
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:40,548
except that my head
would be up there, too.

293
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,450
I've never much
liked my head,

294
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:45,987
but I don't want to see
it removed just yet.

295
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,059
Where are their ships?

296
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:52,928
It is wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.

297
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:56,065
Lord Varys knows what you had
for breakfast three days ago.

298
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:57,699
There are
no surprises here.

299
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,668
If it's true there is dissension
in their ranks,

300
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:01,870
maybe their sailors
have mutinied.

301
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,006
Maybe.

302
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,789
I don't know why
she wants me here.

303
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:24,759
She's always saying
how stupid I am. She hates me.

304
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:28,996
Maybe she hates you less than
she hates everyone else.

305
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,999
I doubt it.

306
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,935
Maybe she's
jealous of you.

307
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:35,937
Why would she
be jealous?

308
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:37,973
Sansa.

309
00:22:41,144 --> 00:22:44,013
I was wondering where
our little dove had flown.

310
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:47,484
You look pale, child.

311
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:49,619
Is your red flower
still blooming?

312
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:51,822
Yes.

313
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:53,523
Fitting, isn't it?

314
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,494
The men will bleed out there
and you will bleed in here.

315
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,529
Pour Lady Sansa
some wine.

316
00:22:59,564 --> 00:23:01,398
I'm not thirsty,
Your Grace.

317
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:04,968
So? I didn't
offer you water.

318
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,807
What's he doing here?

319
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:13,210
Ser Ilyn?

320
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:15,846
<i>He's here to defend us.</i>

321
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,581
When the axes smash
down those doors,

322
00:23:17,615 --> 00:23:19,016
you may be glad
to have him.

323
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,318
But we have guards
to defend us.

324
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:22,986
Guards we have paid.

325
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:24,951
Should the city fall,
they'll be the first ones

326
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:26,557
out of the doors.

327
00:23:30,428 --> 00:23:32,962
The lads caught a groom and
two maids trying to sneak away

328
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:35,465
<i>with a stolen horse</i>
<i>and some gold cups.</i>

329
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,768
The battle's first
traitors.

330
00:23:37,802 --> 00:23:39,436
Have Ser Ilyn
see to them.

331
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,240
Put their heads on spikes outside
the stables as a warning.

332
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:47,311
The only way to keep
the small folk loyal

333
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:50,481
is to make certain they fear you
more than they do the enemy.

334
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:55,287
Remember that if you ever
hope to become a queen.

335
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:59,025
You said he was here
to protect us.

336
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:02,996
He is.

337
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:05,766
Traitors are a danger
to us all.

338
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,535
More wine.

339
00:24:22,017 --> 00:24:23,951
There they are.

340
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:31,225
- Archers to their marks.
- Archers, to your marks!

341
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:35,062
<i>Archers!</i>

342
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:42,068
Nock your arrows!

343
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:44,671
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

344
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:48,541
- Hold fast.
<i>- Hold fast!</i>

345
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:50,776
What are you doing?
We need to attack them.

346
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:55,080
- Hold fast.
<i>- Boulders ready!</i>

347
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,416
<i>Hold fast!</i>

348
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:02,054
There's only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?

349
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:05,057
Where are
the rest of them?!

350
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:10,929
There's only one ship.

351
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:16,703
Archers, stand to!

352
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:18,138
<i>Man the below!</i>

353
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:20,707
- Nock!
<i>- Nock and set!</i>

354
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,745
Draw!

355
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,353
Hold.

356
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:32,422
<i>Hold!</i>

357
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,798
There's no one on board.

358
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,441
<i>More rocks coming up!</i>

359
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,258
<i>Hold.</i>

360
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,400
Wildfire.

361
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:19,603
Steer clear!
Steer clear!

362
00:26:44,361 --> 00:26:46,829
Matthos!
Get down!

363
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:22,989
- Prepare to land.
- Your Grace...

364
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:25,125
The dwarf has played
his little trick.

365
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:27,594
- The wildfire--
- He can only play it once.

366
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:29,897
We're too far
from the gates.

367
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:32,733
The fire,
their archers--

368
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:35,602
hundreds will die.

369
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:37,771
Thousands.

370
00:28:50,952 --> 00:28:53,052
Come with me
and take this city!

371
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:13,605
Sansa, come here,
little dove.

372
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:22,014
My queen.

373
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,115
What are you doing?

374
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,450
Praying.

375
00:29:25,484 --> 00:29:27,919
You're perfect,
aren't you?

376
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:30,288
Praying.

377
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:32,156
<i>What are you praying for?</i>

378
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:34,592
For the Gods to have
mercy on us all.

379
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:37,828
Oh.
On all of us?

380
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:40,463
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Even me?

381
00:29:40,498 --> 00:29:42,398
Of course,
Your Grace.

382
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:44,100
Even Joffrey?

383
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:49,538
- Joffrey is my--
- Oh, shut up, you little fool.

384
00:29:49,572 --> 00:29:52,608
Praying to the Gods
to have mercy on us all.

385
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:55,111
The Gods have no mercy.
That's why they're Gods.

386
00:29:56,447 --> 00:29:59,449
<i>My father told me that</i>
<i>when he caught me praying.</i>

387
00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:02,887
My mother just died,
you see.

388
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:05,389
I didn't really understand
the concept of death,

389
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:07,925
the finality of it.

390
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,361
I thought that if I prayed
very, very hard,

391
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:13,597
the Gods would return
my mother to me. I was four.

392
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:16,400
Your father doesn't
believe in the Gods?

393
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:19,169
He believes in them, he just
doesn't like them very much.

394
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:24,207
One for her.

395
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:29,678
Here.

396
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:32,414
Sit.

397
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,450
Drink.

398
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:39,823
Not like that.
Drink, girl.

399
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,162
I should have been
born a man.

400
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:48,366
I'd rather face 1,000 swords
than be shut up inside

401
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,935
with this flock
of frightened hens.

402
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:53,305
They are your guests
under your protection.

403
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:54,773
You asked them here.

404
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:56,941
It was expected of me,

405
00:30:56,975 --> 00:31:01,279
as it will be of you if you ever
become Joffrey's queen.

406
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:04,650
If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

407
00:31:04,684 --> 00:31:08,520
these hens will return
to their cocks

408
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:11,991
and crow of how my courage
inspired them,

409
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:13,826
lifted their spirits.

410
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,129
And if the city
should fall?

411
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:20,933
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

412
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:23,068
The Red Keep
should hold for a time,

413
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:24,904
long enough for me
to go to the walls

414
00:31:24,938 --> 00:31:27,906
and yield to Lord Stannis
in person.

415
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:30,476
If it were anyone else
outside those gates,

416
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,445
I might have hoped
for a private audience.

417
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:35,348
But this is Stannis Baratheon.

418
00:31:35,382 --> 00:31:39,151
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

419
00:31:42,188 --> 00:31:44,389
Have I shocked you,
little dove?

420
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:47,526
Tears aren't a woman's
only weapon.

421
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:51,729
The best one's
between your legs.

422
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:55,000
Learn how to use it.
Drink.

423
00:31:58,337 --> 00:32:00,472
Do you have any notion
of what happens

424
00:32:00,506 --> 00:32:03,376
when a city is sacked?

425
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:06,012
No, you wouldn't,
would you?

426
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:11,152
If the city falls,
these fine women

427
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:14,221
should be in
for a bit of a rape.

428
00:32:14,256 --> 00:32:16,090
<i>Half of them</i>
<i>will have bastards</i>

429
00:32:16,124 --> 00:32:18,659
in their bellies
come the morning.

430
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:21,528
You'll be glad of
your red flower then.

431
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,997
When a man's blood
is up,

432
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:26,999
anything with tits
looks good.

433
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:28,667
A precious thing like you

434
00:32:28,702 --> 00:32:32,671
will look very, very good.

435
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:34,940
A slice of cake

436
00:32:34,974 --> 00:32:37,210
just waiting to be eaten.

437
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,782
More pressure!

438
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,262
- Pull! Pull!
- That's it, men!

439
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,498
<i>Pull! Pull!</i>

440
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:02,268
<i>That's it!</i>
<i>Steady!</i>

441
00:33:02,302 --> 00:33:05,505
He's a serious man--
Stannis Baratheon.

442
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:07,974
They're coming.
They're coming ashore.

443
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:10,710
Rain fire on them.

444
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:12,478
Archers!

445
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:13,913
There are too many.

446
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:16,849
Hound, form a welcome party
for any Baratheon troop

447
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:19,218
that manages to touch
solid ground.

448
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:23,989
Pod, run to
the King's gate.

449
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:25,757
Bring any men
guarding it here now.

450
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,826
Yes, My Lord.

451
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:31,729
Let's go. Stannis is sending
us fresh meat.

452
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:33,698
You, too.

453
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:37,803
Any of these flaming
fucking arrows come near me,

454
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:40,240
I'll strangle you
with your own guts.

455
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:47,381
Pull, pull! Go!

456
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,517
Nock!

457
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:55,122
<i>Draw!</i>

458
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:58,459
- <i>Draw!</i>
- Draw!

459
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:08,470
<i>Kill the Lannisters!</i>

460
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,072
Loose!

461
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:11,473
Loose!

462
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:16,645
Form the line!

463
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:20,782
Stannis!

464
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:22,518
- Draw!
- <i>Draw!</i>

465
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:25,120
- Loose!
- <i>Loose!</i>

466
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:49,578
<i>They cannot</i>
<i>breach the wall!</i>

467
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,022
Yah!

468
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:11,566
The mud gate, go now!

469
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,769
First and second squads, to the gate!
To the mud gate!

470
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:16,803
Any man dies
with a clean sword,

471
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:19,806
I'll rape
his fucking corpse.

472
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:56,444
<i>When we were young,</i>
<i>Jaime and I,</i>

473
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,879
<i>we looked so much alike.</i>

474
00:35:57,914 --> 00:36:00,282
<i>Even our father</i>
<i>couldn't tell us apart.</i>

475
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:04,920
<i>I could never understand why</i>
<i>they treated us differently.</i>

476
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,824
Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,

477
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:11,660
and I was taught to smile

478
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:13,595
<i>and sing and please.</i>

479
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,632
He was heir
to Casterly Rock

480
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:19,234
and I was sold to some
stranger like a horse

481
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,503
to be ridden
whenever he desired.

482
00:36:21,537 --> 00:36:24,238
You were Robert's queen.

483
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:26,240
And you will be
Joffrey's. Enjoy.

484
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:31,878
I don't think
I know this one.

485
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,751
Pretty.

486
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,926
That's the worst
curtsy I've ever seen.

487
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,862
Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.

488
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:54,099
Straighten your back
and bend.

489
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:58,737
Better.
You learn fast.

490
00:36:58,772 --> 00:37:02,742
How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?

491
00:37:02,776 --> 00:37:05,712
A few weeks,
Your Grace.

492
00:37:08,448 --> 00:37:10,816
When did you
leave Lorath?

493
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:14,786
I had a Lorathi
handmaiden once.

494
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,991
But she was
a nobleman's daughter.

495
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:21,893
You're not.

496
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:27,498
When did you come
to Westeros?

497
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:30,868
10 years ago,
Your Grace.

498
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:34,104
From Lorathi commoner
to the Red Keep

499
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:38,008
in 10 years, all without
learning how to curtsy.

500
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:41,678
I imagine that's
a very interesting story.

501
00:37:42,546 --> 00:37:44,014
What's your name?

502
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:46,550
Shae, Your Grace.

503
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:48,786
Tell us a story, Shae.

504
00:37:54,593 --> 00:37:57,162
When I was 13, I--

505
00:37:58,698 --> 00:38:00,132
Your Grace!

506
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:03,235
What news?

507
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,337
The Imp has set
the river afire.

508
00:38:05,372 --> 00:38:07,906
Hundreds of ships
are burning, maybe more.

509
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:11,410
Stannis's fleet
destroyed, but...

510
00:38:11,444 --> 00:38:14,646
But-- but his troops

511
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:17,181
have landed outside
the city walls.

512
00:38:17,216 --> 00:38:19,317
Where is Joffrey?

513
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:21,619
On the battlements
with Lord Tyrion.

514
00:38:21,653 --> 00:38:23,887
Bring him back
inside at once.

515
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:26,857
- But, Your Grace--
- What?

516
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:29,126
The King's presence
is good for morale.

517
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,762
Bring him back
to his chambers now.

518
00:38:31,796 --> 00:38:33,764
- Not here?
- With the women and children?

519
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:36,467
Do you want him to be mocked as
a coward for the rest of his life?

520
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:38,836
- No, but I--
- Now!

521
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:47,077
When I told you about
Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied.

522
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:50,848
Do you want to hear
the truth?

523
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:52,916
You want to know why
he's really here?

524
00:38:54,886 --> 00:38:56,687
He's here for us.

525
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:59,924
Stannis may take the city,
he may take the throne,

526
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,060
but he will not
take us alive.

527
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:38,430
<i>- Ah! Help me!</i>

528
00:39:57,718 --> 00:39:59,185
We'd better run!

529
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,922
Fall back!

530
00:40:08,796 --> 00:40:10,229
Get the ladders up!

531
00:40:43,132 --> 00:40:46,301
Faster, you bastards!
Faster!

532
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:48,370
Come on, kill the scum!

533
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,541
Someone bring me a drink.

534
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,783
Fuck the water.
Bring me wine.

535
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:14,230
Can I get you
some iced milk

536
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:16,666
and a nice bowl
of raspberries, too?

537
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:18,335
Eat shit, dwarf.

538
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:21,038
You're on the wrong
side of the wall.

539
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:24,108
I lost half my men.

540
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:26,511
The Blackwater's on fire.

541
00:41:26,545 --> 00:41:29,647
Dog, I command you to go
back out there and fight.

542
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:35,653
You're Kingsguard, Clegane.

543
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:38,455
You must beat them back or
they're going to take this city--

544
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,925
your king's city.

545
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:44,161
Fuck the Kingsguard.

546
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:47,664
Fuck the city.

547
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:49,499
Fuck the King.

548
00:42:07,286 --> 00:42:08,387
Loose!

549
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:11,257
Put your backs into it!

550
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:13,526
All right, get up!

551
00:42:16,531 --> 00:42:17,464
Loose!

552
00:42:17,498 --> 00:42:18,765
<i>Clear!</i>

553
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,869
Forward!

554
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:23,972
Loose!

555
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,786
Forward ladders!

556
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:54,334
<i>They're coming</i>
<i>up the wall!</i>

557
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:56,769
<i>Archers on the north wall!</i>

558
00:42:56,804 --> 00:42:58,404
<i>- Heave!</i>

559
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:00,172
<i>- Heave!</i>

560
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:01,874
Your Grace,

561
00:43:01,908 --> 00:43:05,244
<i>the queen has sent me to bring</i>
<i>you back to the Red Keep.</i>

562
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:09,848
If you won't defend your
own city, why should they?

563
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:11,650
What would you
have me do?

564
00:43:11,684 --> 00:43:12,751
Lead.

565
00:43:12,785 --> 00:43:14,953
<i>Get down there</i>
<i>and lead your people</i>

566
00:43:14,987 --> 00:43:16,555
against the invaders
who want to kill them.

567
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:18,557
What did my mother
say exactly?

568
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:20,359
Did she have urgent
business with me?

569
00:43:20,393 --> 00:43:22,161
She did not say,
Your Grace.

570
00:43:23,763 --> 00:43:26,331
<i>All men to the battlements!</i>

571
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:29,268
Ser Boros,
Ser Mandon,

572
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:31,536
stay with my Uncle
and represent the king

573
00:43:31,561 --> 00:43:33,308
on the field of battle.

574
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:37,142
<i>Archers, hold your line</i>

575
00:43:37,176 --> 00:43:39,011
<i>or I'll kill you myself.</i>

576
00:43:42,382 --> 00:43:44,683
<i>Stand fast!</i>

577
00:43:52,058 --> 00:43:53,826
No!

578
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:56,928
Get up, you fool.

579
00:43:56,963 --> 00:44:00,099
<i>We need more arrows!</i>

580
00:44:02,936 --> 00:44:04,570
<i>Where is the king?</i>

581
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:08,007
- <i>Why isn't he with us?</i>
<i>- Who are we fighting for?</i>

582
00:44:09,477 --> 00:44:11,077
<i>Who leads us?</i>

583
00:44:11,112 --> 00:44:13,581
I'll lead the attack.

584
00:44:13,615 --> 00:44:15,282
I'll lead the attack!

585
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:18,653
- Yes?
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

586
00:44:18,688 --> 00:44:20,322
Pod, my helmet.

587
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:24,760
Ser Mandon, you will bear
the King's banner.

588
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,329
Men, form up.

589
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:31,000
<i>Men--</i>

590
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,201
- <i>men!</i>
- Come on.

591
00:44:33,236 --> 00:44:35,904
They say I'm half a man.

592
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:38,640
But what does that make
the lot of you?

593
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:41,209
The only way out
is through the gates.

594
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:42,977
And they're at the gates.

595
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:45,512
There's another way out.
I'm going to show you.

596
00:44:45,547 --> 00:44:48,416
We'll come out behind them
and fuck them in their asses.

597
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:53,420
<i>Heave!</i>

598
00:44:53,454 --> 00:44:55,555
<i>Heave!</i>

599
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,390
Don't fight for your king

600
00:44:57,424 --> 00:45:00,226
and don't fight
for his kingdoms.

601
00:45:01,495 --> 00:45:03,829
<i>Don't fight for honor.</i>
<i>Don't fight for glory.</i>

602
00:45:03,864 --> 00:45:06,265
Don't fight for riches,
because you won't get any.

603
00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:08,767
This is your city
Stannis means to sack.

604
00:45:08,802 --> 00:45:10,836
That's your gate
he's ramming.

605
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,940
<i>If he gets in, it will be</i>
<i>your houses he burns,</i>

606
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:17,476
your gold he steals,

607
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,345
your women he will rape.

608
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,382
Heave! Heave!

609
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:27,119
<i>Heave! Heave!</i>

610
00:45:28,522 --> 00:45:31,291
Those are brave me
knocking at our door.

611
00:45:32,393 --> 00:45:33,827
Let's go kill them.

612
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:58,452
The battle is lost,
Your Grace.

613
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:02,022
Stannis's troops
are at the gates.

614
00:46:02,057 --> 00:46:04,492
When the Gold Cloaks
saw the king leaving,

615
00:46:04,526 --> 00:46:06,159
they lost all heart.

616
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:08,695
Where is my son?

617
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,768
I want to escort him
back to the battle.

618
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:12,589
Why do I care what you want?

619
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:16,335
- Bring me--
- Now listen to me-- ah!

620
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,509
Don't be afraid. The queen has
raised the drawbridge.

621
00:46:25,543 --> 00:46:27,778
This is the safest
place we can be.

622
00:46:27,812 --> 00:46:30,814
Joffrey's not hurt.
He's fighting bravely.

623
00:46:30,848 --> 00:46:32,716
<i>His knights have</i>
<i>rallied behind him.</i>

624
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,284
<i>They will save the city.</i>

625
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:36,853
Shall we sing a hymn?

626
00:46:36,888 --> 00:46:40,024
<i>♪ Gentle mother ♪</i>

627
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:42,726
♪ font of mercy ♪

628
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,098
♪ save our sons
from war, we pray ♪

629
00:46:47,132 --> 00:46:49,500
- ♪ gentle-- ♪
- You must go.

630
00:46:49,535 --> 00:46:52,437
Run to your chamber
and bar your door.

631
00:46:52,472 --> 00:46:55,841
Stannis won't hurt you.
This one will.

632
00:46:58,078 --> 00:46:59,778
Come with me.

633
00:46:59,803 --> 00:47:01,514
I need to say goodbye
to someone.

634
00:47:01,515 --> 00:47:03,683
The queen said
they'd rape everyone.

635
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:05,652
No one is raping me.

636
00:47:07,688 --> 00:47:10,791
Go. Run.

637
00:47:10,825 --> 00:47:15,929
<i>♪ save our sons</i>
<i>from war, we pray. ♪</i>

638
00:47:48,262 --> 00:47:51,131
The lady is starting to panic.

639
00:47:51,165 --> 00:47:53,467
What are you doing here?

640
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:55,602
<i>Not here for long.</i>

641
00:47:55,637 --> 00:47:58,271
- I'm going.
- Where?

642
00:47:58,306 --> 00:48:01,875
Someplace that
isn't burning.

643
00:48:03,377 --> 00:48:05,111
North, might be.

644
00:48:05,145 --> 00:48:07,814
Could be.

645
00:48:07,848 --> 00:48:10,483
What about the king?

646
00:48:10,517 --> 00:48:13,819
He can die just fine
on his own.

647
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:21,525
I can take you with me.

648
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,961
Take you to Winterfell.

649
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:31,235
I'll keep you safe.

650
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:36,241
Do you want to go home?

651
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:40,712
I'll be safe here.

652
00:48:40,747 --> 00:48:42,448
Stannis won't hurt me.

653
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:47,319
Look at me.

654
00:48:47,354 --> 00:48:49,689
Stannis is a killer.

655
00:48:49,723 --> 00:48:51,690
The Lannisters
are killers.

656
00:48:51,725 --> 00:48:54,493
Your father was a killer.

657
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:57,363
Your brother is a killer.

658
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:01,033
Your sons will be
killers someday.

659
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:05,838
The world is built
by killers.

660
00:49:09,276 --> 00:49:11,777
So you'd better get
used to looking at them.

661
00:49:15,482 --> 00:49:18,184
You won't hurt me.

662
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,993
No, little bird,
I won't hurt you.

663
00:49:49,984 --> 00:49:52,919
Heave! Heave!

664
00:49:57,825 --> 00:49:59,526
Come on, you bastards!
Get up those ladders!

665
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:01,729
Ah!

666
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:06,566
Attack!

667
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:22,016
Roll it over!

668
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:32,961
Halfman! Halfman!
Halfman! Halfman!

669
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:37,165
Halfman! Halfman!
Halfman! Halfman!

670
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:46,141
Oh, fuck me.

671
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:40,095
Shh.

672
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:41,730
Be calm, my sweet.

673
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:43,832
They're still fighting.

674
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:48,436
No one's going
to hurt you.

675
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:54,108
<i>I'll tell you a story.</i>

676
00:51:54,142 --> 00:51:57,477
You know the one about the
mother lion and her little cub?

677
00:51:57,512 --> 00:52:00,480
- They lived in the woods.
- The Kingswood.

678
00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:02,782
Yes, my love.

679
00:52:02,817 --> 00:52:06,253
In the Kingswood there lived
a mother and her cub.

680
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:08,388
She loved him very much.

681
00:52:08,422 --> 00:52:12,059
But there were other things
that lived in the woods.

682
00:52:12,093 --> 00:52:15,029
- Evil things.
- Like what?

683
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:18,733
Like stags.

684
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:20,869
Stags aren't evil.

685
00:52:20,903 --> 00:52:23,238
They only eat grass.

686
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,773
And wolves.

687
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,375
My Lord.

688
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,711
<i>He could hear them</i>
<i>howling in the night.</i>

689
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,779
<i>The little cub</i>
<i>was frightened.</i>

690
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:34,048
<i>His mother said,</i>
<i>"You are a lion, my son.</i>

691
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,717
<i>You mustn't be afraid.</i>

692
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,799
For one day all the beasts
will bow to you.

693
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,801
You will be king.

694
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:59,508
<i>All the stags will bow.</i>Ts
<i>all the wolves will bow.</i>

695
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:03,813
The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south,

696
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:08,385
<i>all the birds in the sky</i>
<i>and the beasts in the sea--</i>

697
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:12,522
they will all come
to you, little lion...

698
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:15,525
to rest a crown
upon your head."

699
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,233
And the cub said,

700
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:26,469
"Will I be strong
and fierce like my father?"

701
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,039
"Yes," said his mother.

702
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:33,476
"You will be strong and fierce
just like your father."

703
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:55,797
I will keep you safe,
