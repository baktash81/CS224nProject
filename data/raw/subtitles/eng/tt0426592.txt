1
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:04,206
Stop!
Stop the bus!

2
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:18,786
The story of my life is not
for the faint of heart.

3
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:21,058
Thanks.

4
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:23,395
But, like any story
worth telling,

5
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,492
it's all about a girl.

6
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:28,733
Not that girl.

7
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:31,570
- Hey. Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.

8
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:34,099
No, it's about this girl...

9
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:36,112
Jill Johnson.

10
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:40,139
Ever since I can remember
I've been in love with her,

11
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:41,707
but she barely knows
I exist.

12
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:43,480
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!

13
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,249
I got you a seat
down here. What's...

14
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:46,721
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.

15
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:48,417
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.

16
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,358
Dude, I'm so psyched
for this class trip.

17
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:52,361
We about to see some real
serious cutting-edge shit.

18
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:54,226
Mmm.
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

19
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,891
That's what
I'm talking about.

20
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:57,923
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?

21
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:00,492
Got that new sandwich
from Sony in my backpack.

22
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:01,799
Wi-Fi... mmm!

23
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,837
Yo! You got to forget
about her, dawg.

24
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,866
Look look.
Let me show you something.

25
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:10,505
She not even
looking at you.

26
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:12,412
If I could just
tell her how I feel.

27
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,474
Look, Rick, I already told you...

28
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:16,212
you never gonna get
with Jill, all right?

29
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:17,947
Seriously, she hangs out
with the popular crew,

30
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:20,421
and nobody messes around
outside their group, man.

31
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:22,789
Come on, that crew stuff
isn't real.

32
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:24,851
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.

33
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:26,759
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.

34
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:29,287
...nerds, emos,

35
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:31,596
Frodos,

36
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:34,068
the Scarface society...

37
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:36,800
...the sexual predators.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,400
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?

39
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:42,240
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.

40
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:44,041
Mm-hmm. But you know what?
Who cares?

41
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,048
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.

42
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,913
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.

43
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:50,743
- Am I in?
- No.

44
00:04:50,787 --> 00:04:52,846
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.

45
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:54,516
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?

46
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:55,990
You look good today.
I like your hair.

47
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,652
I'm gonna show you
something nasty I downloaded.

48
00:04:57,694 --> 00:04:59,321
Don't tell nobody.

49
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:02,791
Welcome to Amalgamated.

50
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:04,823
I'm Dr. Strom,
head of the research department...

51
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:07,837
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.

52
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:11,238
And now I'd like
to show you our crown jewel.

53
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:14,334
The Amalgamated
animal genetics lab.

54
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:16,607
Whoa.

55
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:18,944
Go ahead, explore.

56
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,745
Yo yo. Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.

57
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:24,151
All of our animals are
genetically engineered

58
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:26,747
and each of them has...

59
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,758
Oh, you're so pretty.

60
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,625
Hi, birdie.

61
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,027
Hi. Hi.

62
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:39,199
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

63
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,930
Uh, I'm gonna take
a picture of her

64
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:44,667
for the school newspaper.

65
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:46,834
Our only rules: Don't feed the animals

66
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,674
and please,
no flash photography.

67
00:05:51,214 --> 00:05:53,341
Some of our genetically-
engineered animals

68
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:55,351
are a little sensitive
to light.

69
00:05:58,188 --> 00:05:59,746
It flew away.

70
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:07,326
Uh... whoo-hoo.

71
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:10,356
What the F, loser?

72
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,096
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.

73
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:16,401
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.

74
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,237
Is there
a problem, Lance?

75
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:23,006
No. No problem,
Uncle Lou.

76
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:25,139
Mr. Landers!

77
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:27,706
Students,
this is Lou Landers,

78
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,878
visionary scientist
and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.

79
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,650
Well, I'm just
a businessman now.

80
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,954
The future of science

81
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,085
belongs to all of you.

82
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:41,096
Please, enjoy the tour.

83
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,006
Are you okay?

84
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,134
Yes, this is
healthy-cough blood.

85
00:06:55,745 --> 00:07:00,011
Rick Riker. You're not Blaine and Julia
Riker's son, are you?

86
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:03,041
- I am.
- Ah. Good people.

87
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:06,351
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.

88
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:08,220
But otherwise okay?

89
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:12,058
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.

90
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:14,928
Well, you seem
like a real chip off the old block.

91
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:17,262
Let's hope you're not
violently murdered too.

92
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:26,439
That's for making me look stupid.

93
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:28,774
Next time
I hurt you.

94
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:31,746
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.

95
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,376
Our work with these animals
has helped us develop

96
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,617
new antibiotics,
advanced pesticides

97
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:44,491
and a powerful new pheromone
which drives animals to mate

98
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:46,927
called compound H2O0.

99
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:49,523
It's a strong
sexual attractant.

100
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:52,501
A single drop is enough
to arouse any animal.

101
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:56,266
We plan on using it to breed
endangered species.

102
00:07:56,306 --> 00:08:00,037
A special and indeed
often overlooked...

103
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:03,045
Our most-promising research

104
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,274
is with these dragonflies.

105
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:07,749
For example,
this dragonfly's skin

106
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:10,150
has a hard,
armor-like exoskeleton

107
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:11,619
to defend against...

108
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:13,383
And this species
of dragonfly

109
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:15,653
has enormous strength
for its size.

110
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,318
It can lift vast amounts.

111
00:08:19,362 --> 00:08:21,626
More than it's body weight.

112
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:25,225
And here we've injected the DNA
from all three species

113
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:27,702
into seven
new genetically-enhanced

114
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:29,568
super dragonflies.

115
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:32,473
But there's
only six in there.

116
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:35,966
Well, one missing dragonfly
is the least of my concerns.

117
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:38,310
I lost six tigers alone
last month.

118
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,684
Ah!

119
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,052
This area is where
we keep our livestock.

120
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:53,085
Ohh.

121
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:56,824
Aren't you going
to do something?

122
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,527
Soon as I get
this up on YouTube.

123
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:10,202
I see. Ye... well,
yes, I understand.

124
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:12,476
Thank you
for the call.

125
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:15,006
That was
the principal.

126
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:17,349
Rick walked off
a class trip.

127
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:20,413
After all the parenting
you've done,

128
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:22,424
he's still so troubled.

129
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,619
Why do you think
that is, Albert?

130
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,724
I have no idea,
Lucille.

131
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:30,392
I have taught him everything I know
about being a man.

132
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:32,731
And a good man you are

133
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,999
after all these years
of marriage.

134
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:36,596
It's like we first met.

135
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,005
Sure, you're
a little older.

136
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,737
Your hair's grey.

137
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:42,176
You have crow's feet.

138
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:44,771
It takes you
an hour to pee.

139
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:47,044
Your thighs look
like cottage cheese

140
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,051
someone threw up
on a hot sidewalk.

141
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:52,782
And you've always had
a tiny penis.

142
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:57,615
Well... what does it matter
when you're in love?

143
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,962
Oh, Rick.

144
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,433
We were wondering
where you were.

145
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:07,663
It's so late.

146
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:12,469
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.

147
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:14,738
You can sleep late
in the morning,

148
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:17,678
but don't forget
to feed the fish.

149
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:21,210
Attaboy.

150
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,220
I don't know.

151
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:27,381
Something just doesn't seem
quite right with him today.

152
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:30,187
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.

153
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,066
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.

154
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:40,069
Puberty is
a difficult time

155
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:42,094
in a young man's life.

156
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:45,301
Now this book may explain
what's happening.

157
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:48,970
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention,

158
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:52,208
and once a month you'll bleed
from your vagina.

159
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:55,514
This may be
the wrong book.

160
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:58,418
What's important is that you're on
the verge of adulthood.

161
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:01,514
Here...
take a drink.

162
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:04,185
Ah, the rituals
of manhood.

163
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:05,956
Today you have
your first beer,

164
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:07,963
and tomorrow
we'll circumcise you.

165
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,809
I'm losing patience,
Dr. Strom.

166
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:23,004
Please, sir, if you could just
wait a few minutes...

167
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:24,808
I've waited long enough
for this egomaniac.

168
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:26,815
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.

169
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:28,908
Not as valuable
as mine, Mr. Carlson.

170
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:32,682
You see, I have
a terminal illness.

171
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:34,917
I've been
fighting it for years,

172
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:37,858
but the disease has
ravaged my organs.

173
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:41,523
As of this moment,
I have one hour left to live.

174
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,565
It was on sale.

175
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:50,498
Gentlemen, if you're ready,

176
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,134
allow me
to show you the future.

177
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,173
Strom.

178
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:04,217
From the... lift it ov...
lift it over!

179
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:10,424
What the hell
is that?

180
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,791
An innovation...
thank you...

181
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,820
that will not only
save my life

182
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:16,855
but the life
of this company.

183
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,528
For too long we've scraped out profits
from pills and injections.

184
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,334
The real prize is
the total cure.

185
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:26,205
A device
that can alter DNA

186
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:28,210
and restore the body
to perfect health.

187
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:30,542
- You're crazy.
- No.

188
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,277
Crazy is hearing voices,
talking to cats,

189
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,182
dating Paula Abdul.

190
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:39,279
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!

191
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:41,290
Sir.
Sir, the machine's

192
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:43,758
never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...

193
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:46,125
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.

194
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:54,294
Plasma level
is steady.

195
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:56,601
Genetic modification's
at optimum levels!

196
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,403
Sir, the core is overheating.

197
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:02,240
- Ah!
- We have to abort!

198
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:11,445
Did it work?

199
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:14,479
I'm so sorry.

200
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:16,821
Well, well, well.

201
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:19,089
I want you to know
what a joy it will be

202
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:21,790
running this company
without you in the way.

203
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:26,431
Let go.
Let me go.

204
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:53,656
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made
some personnel changes.

205
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:57,258
No, stay away!

206
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:15,350
Oh. How long
was I asleep?

207
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:19,013
Five days.

208
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:34,360
Huh.

209
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:31,955
Wait.
Wha...

210
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:42,829
Oh, Dad.

211
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:51,239
I thought
you'd live forever.

212
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:09,494
Oh.

213
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:50,796
Breakfast, Rick!

214
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:53,974
I'll be right down!

215
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:58,639
Oh!

216
00:17:07,523 --> 00:17:09,650
If I can have your attention.

217
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:13,355
We are delighted to have
as guest judge

218
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,727
the foremost scientist
in the world.

219
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:19,200
He's a visiting professor
at Empire City University

220
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:21,999
where he's working
with the rare element cerillium.

221
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:25,666
I am so proud to welcome
Dr. Stephen Hawking.

222
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:35,011
Thank you for that warm welcome.

223
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,644
I have a disease
that has paralyzed me.

224
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:41,918
I cannot walk and I use
this computer to speak.

225
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:46,656
But I am not depressed,
because I have the gift of knowledge.

226
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:50,961
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.

227
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,299
But you should all be happy
with your lives.

228
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:57,430
You can walk, talk,
wipe your own asses

229
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,338
and then there's
all the sex.

230
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,367
I haven't had sex in years.

231
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:06,040
My nurse is a lesbian,
and not the hot kind.

232
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:09,845
Hey, anyone want
to get high?

233
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:12,581
- I've got some hash with me.
- No way.

234
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:15,181
White guy
in the dreads,

235
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,317
you know
what I'm talking about.

236
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,224
Can I get a what what?

237
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:20,592
Holla.

238
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:23,598
I've got a stiff pole
for your sweet hole.

239
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:27,258
Anyone? Anyone?

240
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:28,895
Pussies.

241
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:31,429
Dr. Hawking,
I am such a fan.

242
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:34,442
I'd love to show you
my project on supernovas.

243
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:37,939
You have an incredible ass...

244
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,847
...stromony career
ahead of you.

245
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:56,665
Wait, where's Saturn?

246
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:58,257
I'd hate to lose
my father's bowling ball.

247
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:01,764
There it is.

248
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:04,136
Great reflexes.

249
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:09,277
You have
very manly hands.

250
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:11,506
So do you.

251
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:15,005
I'm gonna go find a spot
for my project.

252
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,779
Yeah, okay.

253
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:38,903
Watch where you're going
in slo-mo, dipshit.

254
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:40,704
- Pfft.
- Yeah.

255
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:44,941
Go to her, stupid.

256
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:48,149
Tell her how you feel.

257
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:08,763
Yow.

258
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:12,071
Any day.

259
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:13,938
Uh... he did it.

260
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,244
Ow!

261
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,771
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!

262
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:23,046
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!

263
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:25,576
Fight fight fight!

264
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:27,851
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!

265
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:31,586
Whoa!

266
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,424
Oh!

267
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:36,491
Damn!

268
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,961
Ooh!

269
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:51,979
Get off!

270
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:54,312
Get... get off me!

271
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,045
Yah!

272
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:02,018
Ow. Ow. Ow.

273
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:09,190
Shit shit shit shit.

274
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:43,393
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't #

275
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:45,229
- # Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yes, we did #

276
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,735
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't,
Oh no, you didn't #

277
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,170
- # Oh yeah, we did #
- # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #

278
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,036
- # Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yes, we did. #

279
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:59,040
Stop! Stop! Hey!

280
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:05,110
Get out of the way!
No brakes!

281
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:10,586
Get out of the way!

282
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:12,526
Ma'am, look out!

283
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:19,557
Are you okay?

284
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:33,904
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.

285
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:36,247
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.

286
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:39,448
l... I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way,

287
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,012
she would've die... ah!

288
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,928
You should be really proud of yourself.

289
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:56,130
You're some kind of hero.

290
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,604
If you could excuse me.

291
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:04,876
There we go. Awfully nice of you
to help me out here, Trey.

292
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:07,814
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...

293
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:10,885
Ooh.

294
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,944
My God.

295
00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:15,013
How did you do that?

296
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:18,254
Uh, it's easier
than it looks.

297
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:24,823
No, I don't think so.

298
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,301
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

299
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:30,635
All right. Well,
there is something, okay?

300
00:23:30,672 --> 00:23:33,140
But you have to
keep it a secret.

301
00:23:35,677 --> 00:23:39,078
I think I have...
superpowers.

302
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:41,173
I find that
hard to believe.

303
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:42,911
All right, all right,
how about this?

304
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:44,543
Go ahead and throw
as many punches as you want.

305
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:47,020
I bet you 100 bucks
you don't land one.

306
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:51,791
Easy money.

307
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:54,261
What else can you do?

308
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:56,594
I don't know.
l... I was bitten by a dragonfly.

309
00:23:56,632 --> 00:24:00,261
Well, some dragonflies
have armored skin.

310
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:02,896
I wonder if my skin is...

311
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:06,966
Well, good thing
that worked.

312
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:09,637
So you do have
superpowers.

313
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:11,873
We could be a team!

314
00:24:11,914 --> 00:24:14,348
We gonna
get fame, money...

315
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:17,614
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame

316
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:19,848
and there's not
gonna be bitches, okay?

317
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:23,119
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.

318
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:25,251
That isn't what
your parents wanted for you.

319
00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:28,362
You're not my father.

320
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:30,228
But I love you
like your father did.

321
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:32,165
I believe in you
like your father did.

322
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,465
I had sex with your mother just
like your father did.

323
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:38,530
Huh. You'll never
understand me.

324
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:42,010
Never.

325
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:56,417
That isn't what
your parents wanted for you.

326
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:03,262
What a great performance.

327
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:05,061
Well, Rick,
did you enjoy the opera?

328
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:14,142
Son, is something
troubling you?

329
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:16,576
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.

330
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:19,479
Why do we have $2 billion?

331
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:21,641
Well, your grandfather
left us $3 billion

332
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:23,014
and I made some
bad investments.

333
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:25,076
But that's nothing for you
to worry about.

334
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,315
But I want
to change things.

335
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:29,847
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers

336
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:32,121
have worked hard to make
this city great.

337
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,993
One day, Rick, people will look
to you to be a hero.

338
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,794
When that day comes,
will you be ready?

339
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,300
Give me your wallet.

340
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:41,325
That too.

341
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:46,506
People will look to you to be a hero.

342
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:49,533
When that day comes,
will you be ready?

343
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,677
Rick!

344
00:25:57,252 --> 00:25:58,241
Ah!

345
00:26:00,856 --> 00:26:01,948
Ow!

346
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,357
Huh? Ah!

347
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:08,295
Rick, please!

348
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:10,691
Ah!

349
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,374
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.

350
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:24,038
- No!
- Don't worry.

351
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,603
My brother Albert
will take you in.

352
00:26:25,647 --> 00:26:29,083
Rick, the money,
it's all yours now.

353
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:32,348
Sell all shares of a small company
called Google.

354
00:26:32,387 --> 00:26:36,380
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.

355
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:39,394
Rick, I have
something for you.

356
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:42,420
Reach into
my coat pocket.

357
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:45,558
The other coat pocket.

358
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,129
God!

359
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:52,907
That ring
was my father's

360
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:55,205
and his father's
before him.

361
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:57,768
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.

362
00:26:57,813 --> 00:26:59,781
Claim your...

363
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:05,276
- destiny.

364
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,844
Dad!

365
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:13,592
I'm no superhero.

366
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:16,290
I'm nobody!

367
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:17,821
Ah!

368
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:20,528
Shut up back there! I'm gonna kill you!

369
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:37,285
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?

370
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:40,584
You're nothing but an ugly,
ungrateful little whore!

371
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:42,817
Just like your mother!

372
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:45,258
- Who was that?
- My mother.

373
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:48,490
Listen, about what happened
at school this morning, l...

374
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,792
You really freaked us out.

375
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:51,799
I'm really going through
a tough time right now.

376
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:55,098
Me too. My parents,
they want me to go to college,

377
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:57,833
but I want
to be a dancer.

378
00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:59,465
I believe in you.

379
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:02,170
You really do,
don't you?

380
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,804
I wish I could say
the same for Lance.

381
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:06,609
I don't know.
Is he the right one

382
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:09,310
or am I just dating him
to rebel against my father?

383
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:11,717
He doesn't want any boy near me.

384
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:14,085
That's why he installed
the electrified fence.

385
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:17,319
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.

386
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,384
- Right?
- Right.

387
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:24,260
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.

388
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:28,030
Maybe one day you could take me
for a ride in your car.

389
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:30,994
Uh...

390
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,335
Uh, yeah.

391
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:37,277
Yeah, definitely.

392
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:47,384
Oh. Lovebirds.

393
00:29:13,748 --> 00:29:16,216
Rick, this is
Professor Xavier.

394
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:19,914
Your powers are growing,
but you can't control it.

395
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:22,583
It's important that you...

396
00:29:22,624 --> 00:29:26,287
become a hero...
train yourself to fly...

397
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:30,059
...in your ass because...

398
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:32,623
...squatting
on a glass table...

399
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:36,125
...two girls...
one cup...

400
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:38,503
You know what to do.

401
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:53,215
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.

402
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:54,779
Hello, Mr. Bailey.

403
00:29:54,823 --> 00:29:56,916
I've reviewed your request
for a loan, Mr. Riker,

404
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,392
but with no job,
no credit history,

405
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:01,622
I'm afraid
I have to say no.

406
00:30:01,663 --> 00:30:03,130
But what about this?

407
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,326
That was last month.

408
00:30:07,402 --> 00:30:09,461
This new promotion's
proving quite popular.

409
00:30:09,504 --> 00:30:11,404
Look, I need
to buy a car.

410
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:14,465
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst
applicant we've ever had.

411
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:17,273
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.

412
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:22,913
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.

413
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,543
Ma'am...

414
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:27,680
rubbing my crotch under the desk
won't change my mind.

415
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:29,622
I'm not rubbing
your crotch.

416
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:32,926
I really need that car.

417
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,826
I don't see
how that's my problem.

418
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:36,990
This is a robbery! Nobody move!

419
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:39,330
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!

420
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:40,834
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady! Hurry it up!

421
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:43,702
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!

422
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:50,276
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake
before when I came in.

423
00:30:50,312 --> 00:30:51,802
Thanks.

424
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:56,375
You idiot! You let him get away
with our money!

425
00:30:56,418 --> 00:30:59,353
I don't see
how that's my problem.

426
00:31:02,257 --> 00:31:05,852
- Oh, man!
- Wow.

427
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:08,385
Come over here!
You've got to see this.

428
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:11,490
Let me through.
Let me through.

429
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,433
Oh, thank God. I thought something
terrible had happened.

430
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:22,170
Well, an old guy did
get shot over there.

431
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:29,212
Uncle Albert! Just try to breathe.

432
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,947
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.

433
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:34,546
Oh, sorry.

434
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:36,989
Rick, listen.

435
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:40,552
With great power comes...

436
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:42,062
Great responsibility?

437
00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:44,190
I was gonna stick
with bitches,

438
00:31:44,232 --> 00:31:46,200
but if you want to be a virgin
for the rest of your life...

439
00:31:46,234 --> 00:31:47,861
Uncle Albert!

440
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:50,029
My balls!

441
00:31:57,579 --> 00:31:59,046
Very good.

442
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,685
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!

443
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:26,601
Oh no.

444
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:30,470
Okay.

445
00:32:30,512 --> 00:32:33,037
Hide the body.
Hide the body. Yeah.

446
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:43,019
Get in!
Yah! Yah!

447
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:53,097
Okay, I come back.

448
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,750
Jill?

449
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:13,447
I came as soon
as I heard.

450
00:33:13,488 --> 00:33:16,685
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.

451
00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:19,284
They made her watch three hours
of women's basketball.

452
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:22,592
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.

453
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,257
There was nothing
you could've done.

454
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,631
I could've stopped that guy
before he shot my uncle.

455
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:28,829
Then there is blood
on your hands.

456
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,328
But that's not important. All that matters
is that you're here for him now.

457
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:34,773
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?

458
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:37,369
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.

459
00:33:37,412 --> 00:33:39,676
I'm afraid I have bad news.

460
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:42,615
What is it?

461
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,481
I have an impacted colon.

462
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,454
Whew.
What a night.

463
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,220
Now what brought you
here today?

464
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:53,819
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?

465
00:33:53,862 --> 00:33:56,990
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.

466
00:33:57,031 --> 00:34:00,023
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to perform a breast exam.

467
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:02,332
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?

468
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,396
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.

469
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:09,169
Hard to say.

470
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,145
Yup, pretty deep coma.

471
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,807
Is he gonna be okay?

472
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:16,612
Well, I'm not a betting man,
but if you want to put some money on it,

473
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:19,142
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!

474
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:21,485
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction,

475
00:34:21,523 --> 00:34:23,650
but this should take
the edge off of it.

476
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:25,852
Here we go.
Nice and easy.

477
00:34:25,894 --> 00:34:29,830
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.

478
00:34:29,864 --> 00:34:32,025
First my parents and now this?

479
00:34:33,034 --> 00:34:34,626
I'm nothing
but a screw-up.

480
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:37,160
Yes, your life has been
a testament to that.

481
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,969
But your uncle believed
in you and so do I.

482
00:34:40,008 --> 00:34:43,307
It's never too late to become the person
you're meant to be.

483
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:49,684
Rick.

484
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:51,242
Rick.

485
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:54,846
Rick.

486
00:34:58,459 --> 00:34:59,517
Hello, Rick.

487
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:02,052
Who are you and how
do you know my name?

488
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:04,360
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.

489
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:08,233
Think of any number
between one and a million

490
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:10,032
and I'll tell you
what it is.

491
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:12,972
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!

492
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:15,567
Follow me...

493
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,578
you dumb son of a bitch.

494
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,748
My name is
Professor Xavier,

495
00:35:20,782 --> 00:35:22,716
and this is my school.

496
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,445
I started it
to help people

497
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:27,750
with special talents
like yours.

498
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:30,724
Our students here learn to harness
their incredible talents.

499
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:33,750
and use them to advance
the common good.

500
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:38,326
Ah! Ow.

501
00:35:38,366 --> 00:35:41,767
Here we have children
who can walk through walls.

502
00:35:41,803 --> 00:35:44,397
We have children who think they can
walk through walls.

503
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:47,670
Some faces may be familiar,

504
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:50,439
like Wolverine.

505
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:53,003
Other mutants you probably
didn't know existed,

506
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:55,572
like Sneezo.

507
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:58,484
Most of our students
are born with their powers.

508
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:01,750
Some, like you,
gain them later in life.

509
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:03,882
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.

510
00:36:03,925 --> 00:36:06,086
When he came to this school,

511
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:07,958
he weighed 130 lbs.

512
00:36:07,996 --> 00:36:10,328
Take enough roids,
you could do anything.

513
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:14,067
Back up off those pills, Barry!

514
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:22,335
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential

515
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:25,278
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.

516
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:27,941
Once you understand
the true nature of heroism,

517
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:30,917
you will fly.
But first I must teach you

518
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:33,147
the secret
to becoming a superhero.

519
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:35,883
Hey, Storm! You look
like you putting on a little weight.

520
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:38,585
Ah! Oh!

521
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:42,221
So, Professor,
about this secret...

522
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:43,753
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!

523
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:47,097
- Aw, shit.
- Well?

524
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:49,296
You wanna explain
why I found her hiding in your closet?

525
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:51,202
But, pumpkin,
I don't see nobody.

526
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,571
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!

527
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:55,269
Invisible Girl?

528
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,642
Apparently not
invisible enough.

529
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,113
If you knew how to take care of your man,
maybe this wouldn't have happened.

530
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:02,139
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.

531
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:04,083
I'm gonna have to
whip your ass.

532
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:06,109
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?

533
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:08,054
I'm everywhere,
sweet cheeks.

534
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:10,353
- Whoa!
- Ow!

535
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:12,484
- That all you got?
- Yeah!

536
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:16,122
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?

537
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,530
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.

538
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:21,501
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.

539
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,699
Biting, scratching, panting,
tongue all over the place.

540
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,570
Wasn't me, asshole.

541
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:28,939
Come on, Spanky.

542
00:37:28,976 --> 00:37:31,570
I didn't even know
she had a dog.

543
00:37:31,612 --> 00:37:34,706
Still some of the best
sex I ever had.

544
00:37:34,749 --> 00:37:37,946
How could you do this
to me? To your kids?

545
00:37:37,985 --> 00:37:40,283
To your newborn baby?

546
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:42,118
How do I know
that baby's even mine?

547
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:44,716
Because he can do this.

548
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:46,158
Shit!

549
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:48,219
Ah!

550
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:49,923
Aw, man.

551
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:52,865
Now I'm never gonna know the secret
to becoming a superhero.

552
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,892
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.

553
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:00,966
Make a costume,
shithead!

554
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:04,409
I swear to God. They get dumber
and dumber every year.

555
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:07,741
A costume.

556
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:42,076
Rick, you, uh...

557
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:45,108
Oh my God.

558
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,917
Damn!

559
00:38:47,955 --> 00:38:50,788
Dude, you're like
a real superhero, man!

560
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:53,020
I love the mask.

561
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,254
How you breathe
in it though?

562
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,726
What's that sound?

563
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:01,633
You put some kind
of air intake in the mask.

564
00:39:01,669 --> 00:39:03,637
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming

565
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:06,367
that the material is
see-through, right?

566
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:08,739
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.

567
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:12,007
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.

568
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,550
Hey, that's my spot.

569
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:28,061
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.

570
00:39:28,095 --> 00:39:30,723
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?

571
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:32,858
I'm looking seriously
out over the city

572
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,801
in a squatting position.

573
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:37,828
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,

574
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:40,067
I guess we're gonna
have to share.

575
00:39:40,107 --> 00:39:41,267
Uh, okay, fine.

576
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:43,869
I actually usually
perch in the front.

577
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:46,471
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.

578
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,039
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way. Here we go.

579
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,051
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry. Relax.

580
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:52,746
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.

581
00:39:55,456 --> 00:39:58,050
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.

582
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:00,151
- What's your name?
- John Storm.

583
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:02,662
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?

584
00:40:02,697 --> 00:40:05,063
What's my power?
Stand back.

585
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:10,060
- Flame on!
- Whoa!

586
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:12,368
Huh?

587
00:40:12,406 --> 00:40:15,273
I'm on fire!

588
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:17,709
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!

589
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:21,181
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!

590
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:24,613
Ah! No! Ah!

591
00:40:24,652 --> 00:40:26,916
God! You idiot, stop!

592
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:28,922
What's wrong with you?

593
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:41,097
Sorry, my bad.

594
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:50,138
Rick, once you understand
the true nature of heroism,

595
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:52,145
you will fly.

596
00:40:55,182 --> 00:40:57,980
Shit.

597
00:41:16,837 --> 00:41:21,171
This Dragonfly,
he's not even a hero.

598
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:24,336
He's not... I have... I have...
I have just a... I have...

599
00:41:25,713 --> 00:41:28,682
He can't...
he can't even fly.

600
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:32,409
The Dragonfly
can't even fly!

601
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,458
I can fly, okay?

602
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,394
I can fly.

603
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:43,090
This just in:

604
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,724
Tom Cruise is dead.

605
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:48,234
World's most powerful man.

606
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:52,333
I have a feeling you might
disagree with that.

607
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:57,643
Strom, do you have
my test results?

608
00:41:57,678 --> 00:42:00,146
Yes, sir.

609
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:06,785
Whatever you're doing
to your... victims,

610
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:09,949
rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.

611
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:11,788
Hmmm.

612
00:42:11,826 --> 00:42:15,318
What if I killed 28 people
in one session?

613
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:17,331
Would that give me
a month to live?

614
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:19,697
If it were February, yes.

615
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:21,361
But only if your cells
could absorb

616
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:23,734
that much energy at once,
and they can't.

617
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:26,831
I'm afraid
you have to kill each day

618
00:42:26,874 --> 00:42:28,808
to live each day.

619
00:42:28,843 --> 00:42:31,505
Still a slave
to the tyranny of time.

620
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:33,877
There must be some answer.

621
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:35,882
There isn't.

622
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:38,510
Unless...

623
00:42:38,552 --> 00:42:41,988
unless you had
some cerillium.

624
00:42:42,023 --> 00:42:44,651
Then you could create
a device powerful enough

625
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:47,252
to draw the life-force out
of thousands of people

626
00:42:47,294 --> 00:42:49,558
and enhance your own
cellular capacity.

627
00:42:49,597 --> 00:42:52,031
Strom, you're a genius.

628
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:54,762
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.

629
00:42:54,802 --> 00:42:58,329
What is important is that you
don't have any cerillium.

630
00:42:58,372 --> 00:43:00,602
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.

631
00:43:00,641 --> 00:43:02,233
We're a pharmaceutical
company.

632
00:43:02,276 --> 00:43:04,608
Wait a minute.

633
00:43:06,013 --> 00:43:08,106
Take a look.

634
00:43:08,149 --> 00:43:09,912
Hawking's lab is
in the physics building.

635
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,315
I could just
walk right in.

636
00:43:11,352 --> 00:43:14,719
You're going
to steal cerillium?

637
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:18,213
No, not me.

638
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:19,920
I'm a law abiding citizen.

639
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,258
But perhaps there's
someone inside me.

640
00:43:22,296 --> 00:43:25,424
Someone unfettered
by the rule of law.

641
00:43:25,466 --> 00:43:30,267
Someone who will,
at any cost, survive!

642
00:43:30,304 --> 00:43:32,568
Ow!

643
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:34,904
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!

644
00:43:34,942 --> 00:43:37,968
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.

645
00:43:38,012 --> 00:43:41,539
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.

646
00:43:41,582 --> 00:43:43,550
Push your lids
with your fingers.

647
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:45,449
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?

648
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:47,647
That's it. And roll
your eyeball around.

649
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:49,417
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!

650
00:43:49,457 --> 00:43:51,755
Dig it out with
another piece of glass.

651
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:53,487
Are you fricking insane?

652
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:55,552
I'll get the tweezers.

653
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:59,496
Read about the Dragonfly,
world's greatest hero.

654
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:01,160
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.

655
00:44:01,202 --> 00:44:02,692
Read all about it.

656
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:16,646
No, you listen to me!

657
00:44:16,684 --> 00:44:19,312
I want that story
on my desk or you're fired!

658
00:44:19,353 --> 00:44:20,513
Who the hell are you?

659
00:44:20,554 --> 00:44:22,613
I was wondering if you've
got a job opening for...

660
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:26,023
Job?! How dare you come in here
and ask me for a job?

661
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,029
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!

662
00:44:29,063 --> 00:44:31,258
Hamburgers can see
the future!

663
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:32,822
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.

664
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:34,801
We share the building
with a mental hospital.

665
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:37,736
Bad news, boss. We're nowhere on
those Dragonfly photos.

666
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:40,036
Damn. Those were
tomorrow's lead.

667
00:44:40,074 --> 00:44:42,201
What about these?

668
00:44:45,513 --> 00:44:49,847
Wow! it's almost like
you're the Dragonfly.

669
00:44:49,884 --> 00:44:51,511
Uh, no no no.
See?

670
00:44:51,552 --> 00:44:53,986
Look.

671
00:44:54,021 --> 00:44:55,921
Now that's photography.

672
00:44:55,956 --> 00:44:58,652
Just heard on the scanner, some kind
of police standoff at Empire University.

673
00:44:58,692 --> 00:45:01,627
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...

674
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:03,596
Where'd he go?

675
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,902
Come on, let's go!

676
00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:21,748
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.

677
00:45:21,782 --> 00:45:23,477
Come out with your hands up.

678
00:45:26,687 --> 00:45:29,087
What the hell is that?

679
00:45:42,536 --> 00:45:45,300
I am the Hourglass.

680
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:48,365
And your time is up.

681
00:45:58,352 --> 00:46:00,217
Get him, Dragonfly.

682
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:09,720
It's over, Hourglass.

683
00:46:09,763 --> 00:46:12,425
No, Dragonfly.

684
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:25,176
It's just begun!

685
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,271
It's useless to resist.

686
00:46:29,316 --> 00:46:31,181
I'll fight you
to my last breath.

687
00:46:31,218 --> 00:46:35,086
Like the sands of time
I am unceasing and relentless.

688
00:46:35,122 --> 00:46:37,022
Evil never triumphs,
Hourglass.

689
00:46:37,057 --> 00:46:39,958
You'll pay for your crimes
and justice will...

690
00:46:39,994 --> 00:46:42,121
stop!
Stop!

691
00:46:42,162 --> 00:46:44,153
Stop!

692
00:46:44,198 --> 00:46:46,496
Are you okay?

693
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:49,661
No.

694
00:46:53,507 --> 00:46:55,441
Titanium blades.

695
00:46:55,476 --> 00:46:57,171
They cut through diamonds.

696
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:59,702
I'm not wearing any diamonds.

697
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:04,210
Ooh, ow!

698
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:07,549
Ow!

699
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:10,751
I wish I could stay longer,
Dragonfly.

700
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:14,124
But I just don't
have the time.

701
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:23,733
Whoever this Dragonfly is,
he's in over his head.

702
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:25,932
We don't need so-called
superheroes.

703
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:28,203
What Empire City needs
is more cops.

704
00:47:28,242 --> 00:47:30,142
And a Hooters.

705
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:35,615
Titanium blades. Looks like someone
found your weakness.

706
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:37,173
It's not my weakness.

707
00:47:37,217 --> 00:47:40,448
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.

708
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:41,852
Maybe if you had a partner.

709
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:43,151
I don't need help.

710
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:50,158
I'm fine all by myself.

711
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:52,097
She means a lot to you,
doesn't she?

712
00:47:52,132 --> 00:47:54,396
What?
Oh, no.

713
00:47:54,435 --> 00:47:57,029
I mean, she's with
someone else.

714
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:58,834
Well, maybe
that's for the best.

715
00:47:58,872 --> 00:48:00,669
After all,
it could be dangerous,

716
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:03,142
you know, being the girlfriend
of the Dragonfly.

717
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:05,202
I don't know what
to do, Aunt Lucille.

718
00:48:05,245 --> 00:48:07,236
- I love her.
- So be it.

719
00:48:07,281 --> 00:48:09,181
But remember,
to get to you

720
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:12,879
your enemies will attack
the people you care for the most.

721
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,720
Be careful not to hurt
the ones you love.

722
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,293
And shave your pubes.

723
00:48:20,327 --> 00:48:22,852
No one wants to go down
on a tumbleweed.

724
00:48:33,674 --> 00:48:35,539
Jill!

725
00:48:35,576 --> 00:48:36,975
Rick?

726
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:39,138
I heard you were auditioning
for a part so...

727
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:41,147
Oh, they're beautiful.

728
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:43,445
God, you are so supportive.

729
00:48:43,484 --> 00:48:46,453
Why can't Lance
be more like you?

730
00:48:48,555 --> 00:48:51,149
There's something you're not
telling me, isn't there?

731
00:48:51,191 --> 00:48:52,590
Something secret.

732
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:55,390
Something locked away
deep inside.

733
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:57,590
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.

734
00:48:57,631 --> 00:48:59,724
You trip and fall with your mouth
open on one guys...

735
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:01,394
No!

736
00:49:01,435 --> 00:49:04,871
I mean, in here.

737
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:10,835
Well, there is...

738
00:49:12,379 --> 00:49:15,143
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.

739
00:49:17,418 --> 00:49:20,444
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!

740
00:49:20,487 --> 00:49:23,820
Once a month
you'll bleed from you vagina.

741
00:49:26,894 --> 00:49:28,623
I...

742
00:49:28,662 --> 00:49:30,789
nothing.

743
00:49:32,332 --> 00:49:35,233
Nothing?

744
00:49:38,472 --> 00:49:40,269
Well, I should go.

745
00:49:41,442 --> 00:49:43,910
You're a good friend.

746
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,081
Hey, check this out.

747
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:50,209
Hey, check this out.

748
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,115
Oh, shit.

749
00:49:54,088 --> 00:49:56,181
- Let's go.
- Get her.

750
00:50:37,764 --> 00:50:40,028
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.

751
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:42,661
Please stop!
I'm begging you!

752
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:59,478
Wait!

753
00:51:01,155 --> 00:51:04,147
- Where are you?
- Behind you.

754
00:51:06,426 --> 00:51:08,451
You saved my life.

755
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:10,861
Do I get to thank you?

756
00:51:53,874 --> 00:51:56,138
Go.
Be a hero.

757
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,189
Yeah.

758
00:52:25,405 --> 00:52:27,396
It looks like you're planning
a mass murder.

759
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:29,306
Would you like help?

760
00:52:29,343 --> 00:52:30,935
Paper clip guy.

761
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,459
I'm so happy that you
and your boyfriend

762
00:52:50,497 --> 00:52:52,488
are spending Thanksgiving
with us.

763
00:52:52,532 --> 00:52:54,466
Of course, Lucille.

764
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:56,401
You need support
at a time like this.

765
00:52:56,436 --> 00:52:59,963
Yes, I miss seeing
my Albert each morning.

766
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:02,339
You know, 50 years
of marriage

767
00:53:02,376 --> 00:53:04,310
creates quite a bond.

768
00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:06,141
I wish I knew love
like that.

769
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:07,908
Oh, you will, dear.

770
00:53:07,948 --> 00:53:10,644
You just have to
follow your heart.

771
00:53:10,684 --> 00:53:13,448
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.

772
00:53:13,487 --> 00:53:15,182
Oh, Jill.

773
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:18,749
If you can't trust yourself
who can you trust?

774
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:20,521
I know.

775
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,551
But what if my heart
is telling me to be with someone

776
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:23,961
I can't be with?

777
00:53:23,997 --> 00:53:25,760
It's not just any guy.
It's the...

778
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:28,097
forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.

779
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:29,693
No, of course not.

780
00:53:29,736 --> 00:53:31,704
You can tell me anything.

781
00:53:31,738 --> 00:53:33,797
I'm very good
at keeping secrets.

782
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,434
You'll think it's
ridiculous, but...

783
00:53:36,476 --> 00:53:38,808
it's the Drag...

784
00:53:38,845 --> 00:53:40,369
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.

785
00:53:42,616 --> 00:53:45,551
Hey, babe.

786
00:53:45,585 --> 00:53:48,782
Oh, I forgot to tell you
I kinda invited my uncle.

787
00:53:48,822 --> 00:53:52,087
- Your uncle?
- What? Set another plate.

788
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,025
Well, okay.
I guess.

789
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:57,519
Miss Johnson. Please,
excuse my nephew's poor manners.

790
00:53:57,564 --> 00:54:00,590
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.

791
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:02,659
I hope this isn't
too much of an imposition.

792
00:54:02,703 --> 00:54:05,570
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.

793
00:54:05,605 --> 00:54:06,902
Thank you.

794
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,033
It's just Thanksgiving
is for family.

795
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:11,010
Lance is the only family
I have.

796
00:54:11,044 --> 00:54:12,978
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?

797
00:54:13,013 --> 00:54:15,345
Nope, just never met
the right woman.

798
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:19,216
Ah, yes, Lance told me
Rick Riker was your neighbor.

799
00:54:19,252 --> 00:54:20,947
Where is Rick?

800
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,250
That's odd.

801
00:54:26,293 --> 00:54:29,387
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.

802
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:32,057
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.

803
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:34,624
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.

804
00:54:51,685 --> 00:54:53,516
Rick?

805
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:06,128
Hmmm.

806
00:55:15,075 --> 00:55:16,406
Hmmm.

807
00:56:33,153 --> 00:56:35,883
Sorry I'm late.

808
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:38,755
Oh, Mr. Landers.

809
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:40,589
Rick.

810
00:56:40,627 --> 00:56:42,561
No, you're just on time.

811
00:56:42,596 --> 00:56:44,791
Everybody,
take your seat.

812
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:46,355
Ohhh.

813
00:56:46,399 --> 00:56:49,368
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.

814
00:56:49,402 --> 00:56:51,165
Jesus!

815
00:56:51,204 --> 00:56:52,603
Amen.

816
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:55,834
Please start,
everyone.

817
00:56:55,876 --> 00:56:57,810
This all looks
so delicious, Lucille.

818
00:56:57,844 --> 00:57:00,745
We have Rick
to thank for it.

819
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,374
Ever since Albert...

820
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:06,579
Rick has been supporting me
with his new job.

821
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,884
New job?
You didn't tell me.

822
00:57:08,922 --> 00:57:12,915
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's
unofficial photographer.

823
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:17,856
What happened to your arm?

824
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,499
Uh...

825
00:57:21,535 --> 00:57:24,026
a bike messenger
knocked me down.

826
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:27,399
I see
your wrist is bandaged.

827
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,409
Yes, I burned it
on some hot coffee.

828
00:57:30,443 --> 00:57:32,411
And you have a cut on your lip.

829
00:57:32,445 --> 00:57:34,379
Uh...

830
00:57:34,414 --> 00:57:37,110
my crackpipe broke.

831
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:40,985
You have a scratch
on your neck.

832
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:43,421
Yes, I...

833
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:46,254
met a girl
on Craigslist.

834
00:57:46,293 --> 00:57:48,352
And you have a bruise
on your neck.

835
00:57:48,395 --> 00:57:50,329
I...

836
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:52,661
met a guy
on Craigslist.

837
00:57:55,435 --> 00:57:57,960
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.

838
00:57:58,004 --> 00:58:00,495
- Why?
- I...

839
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,531
shat my pants.

840
00:58:03,977 --> 00:58:05,842
I'll drive.

841
00:58:19,759 --> 00:58:22,319
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.

842
00:58:22,362 --> 00:58:25,058
Poor thing's so tired.

843
00:58:25,098 --> 00:58:27,760
Yeah, well, you know
old folks after a big meal.

844
00:58:27,801 --> 00:58:30,736
So... you know the Dragonfly?

845
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,533
Uh...

846
00:58:32,572 --> 00:58:34,233
yeah, I guess.

847
00:58:34,274 --> 00:58:36,538
You could sorta say
we're close.

848
00:58:36,576 --> 00:58:39,943
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?

849
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,971
Um, yeah.

850
00:58:42,015 --> 00:58:44,483
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?

851
00:58:45,986 --> 00:58:47,851
Well, I said...

852
00:58:47,887 --> 00:58:48,979
I told him...

853
00:58:50,056 --> 00:58:52,923
I told him, "The thing
about Jill is...

854
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:56,417
when you look in her eyes
and she looks back in yours...

855
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,662
- you know that
you'd do anything

856
00:59:02,702 --> 00:59:05,330
anything to be a better person
than you are.

857
00:59:05,372 --> 00:59:06,964
So that...

858
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:11,401
- if you were ever
lucky enough to be with her,

859
00:59:11,444 --> 00:59:14,470
you could earn every second
of her perfect...

860
00:59:21,354 --> 00:59:24,448
- grace,
and her limitless beauty...

861
00:59:29,496 --> 00:59:31,487
- and her unending love.

862
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:35,323
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.

863
00:59:35,368 --> 00:59:37,268
My eyes are burning.

864
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:40,868
Rick, I want you to know

865
00:59:40,907 --> 00:59:42,898
that was the most
beautiful thing

866
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:44,773
anyone's ever said to me.

867
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:53,011
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.

868
00:59:54,421 --> 00:59:57,879
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...

869
00:59:59,426 --> 01:00:01,758
- I know exactly
what I want.

870
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:23,777
Sorry to drop in uninvited.

871
01:00:23,817 --> 01:00:26,980
It's okay. We were hoping someone
would open a window.

872
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,488
It was getting stuffy
in here.

873
01:00:29,522 --> 01:00:33,049
So this is the lair
of the Dragonfly.

874
01:00:33,093 --> 01:00:35,994
- How did you...
- No no no,

875
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:40,398
I'm not here to fight you. I've got
thousands of other people I plan to kill.

876
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:43,664
This little visit
is just to show you

877
01:00:43,703 --> 01:00:47,230
who'll get hurt
if you get in my way.

878
01:00:47,273 --> 01:00:49,241
Never!

879
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,919
Time to go.

880
01:01:09,529 --> 01:01:12,020
The woman, Lucille Adams
of East Empire City,

881
01:01:12,065 --> 01:01:14,465
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?

882
01:01:14,501 --> 01:01:16,332
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?

883
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:18,360
All I can tell you is this:

884
01:01:18,404 --> 01:01:20,668
he didn't save
anyone tonight.

885
01:01:20,707 --> 01:01:23,141
Doctor, how is she?

886
01:01:23,176 --> 01:01:25,610
I'm afraid your aunt's
taken a turn for the worse.

887
01:01:25,645 --> 01:01:28,739
She can't speak, she can't walk,
she had no control over her bowels.

888
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:30,147
That's... that's awful.

889
01:01:30,183 --> 01:01:32,674
I know. I went ahead and set up
a MySpace page for her

890
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:35,279
under "crazy shit machine."

891
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:36,948
She already has 40 friends.

892
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:39,288
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.

893
01:01:39,325 --> 01:01:41,589
Your aunt has no problem
with her bowels...

894
01:01:41,628 --> 01:01:43,562
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.

895
01:01:43,596 --> 01:01:46,759
I'm truly sorry, Rick,
but there is a silver lining.

896
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,132
Your uncle came out
of his coma this morning.

897
01:01:49,169 --> 01:01:50,397
He did?

898
01:01:50,436 --> 01:01:53,428
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about
your aunt just yet.

899
01:01:53,473 --> 01:01:56,442
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news

900
01:01:56,476 --> 01:01:59,104
could send him spiraling
right back into a coma.

901
01:01:59,145 --> 01:02:00,942
I understand.

902
01:02:03,116 --> 01:02:05,516
Mr. Adams,
you have a visitor.

903
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:08,612
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.

904
01:02:08,655 --> 01:02:10,452
It's your nephew Rick.

905
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,685
Remember, no bad news.

906
01:02:12,725 --> 01:02:15,592
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.

907
01:02:15,628 --> 01:02:19,120
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you

908
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:21,030
with one of our
sex-change patients,

909
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:23,365
but don't worry,
we didn't remove your penis.

910
01:02:23,403 --> 01:02:26,338
We did cut your testicles off, but, well,
since your wife's dead,

911
01:02:26,372 --> 01:02:27,964
you won't be
needing them anyway.

912
01:02:28,007 --> 01:02:29,804
You just want
to keep his spirits up.

913
01:02:29,843 --> 01:02:31,970
He'll land on his feet
in no time.

914
01:02:33,546 --> 01:02:36,709
We are gathered today to say goodbye

915
01:02:36,749 --> 01:02:39,616
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!

916
01:02:39,652 --> 01:02:42,314
And now the eulogy.

917
01:02:42,355 --> 01:02:44,721
It's tragic to think this is the last time

918
01:02:44,757 --> 01:02:47,225
that I can look
upon my wife's face.

919
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,490
God, Lucille!

920
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:53,829
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!

921
01:02:53,867 --> 01:02:55,801
Ahhh!

922
01:02:55,835 --> 01:02:58,201
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!

923
01:02:58,238 --> 01:03:00,206
I'm sorry, there's been
a terrible mistake.

924
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,107
- This is your wife.
- Ah!

925
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:05,303
She is this man's wife.

926
01:03:07,647 --> 01:03:10,548
Give me five minutes.

927
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,285
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.

928
01:03:21,027 --> 01:03:23,257
You're one lucky guy.
Now...

929
01:03:23,296 --> 01:03:24,786
where's Lucille?

930
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:27,925
Ah, Lucille!

931
01:03:34,407 --> 01:03:37,342
I do have this coupon
for a cremation.

932
01:03:41,781 --> 01:03:43,339
Rick?

933
01:03:44,684 --> 01:03:47,175
I am so sorry
for your loss.

934
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:51,447
What is it?

935
01:03:51,491 --> 01:03:53,618
I know I said some things,

936
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,651
but now more than ever,
I realize...

937
01:03:57,063 --> 01:03:58,997
we can never be together.

938
01:03:59,032 --> 01:04:01,762
I don't believe you.

939
01:04:03,536 --> 01:04:06,937
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.

940
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:10,374
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.

941
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,111
I don't love you.

942
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:20,142
You're no longer
in my five.

943
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:23,689
How could you?

944
01:04:29,762 --> 01:04:31,491
# When I was young #

945
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:36,166
# I never needed anyone #

946
01:04:38,604 --> 01:04:42,335
# Makin' love
was just for fun #

947
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,808
# Those days are gone #

948
01:04:53,886 --> 01:04:59,984
# All by myself #

949
01:05:00,026 --> 01:05:02,654
# Don't wanna be #

950
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:07,564
# All by myself #

951
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,431
# Anymore #

952
01:05:10,603 --> 01:05:15,905
# All by myself #

953
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:18,800
# Don't wanna be #

954
01:05:18,845 --> 01:05:23,578
# All by myself. #

955
01:05:23,616 --> 01:05:27,108
# Anymore #

956
01:05:27,153 --> 01:05:32,853
# All by myself #

957
01:05:32,892 --> 01:05:35,019
# Don't want to be #

958
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:39,521
# All by myself #

959
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:42,864
# Anymore #

960
01:05:42,902 --> 01:05:47,362
# All by myself. #

961
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,910
You can't keep
getting lucky, man.

962
01:05:54,947 --> 01:05:57,177
You only beat me
by two strokes this time.

963
01:05:57,216 --> 01:05:59,616
And the back nine
is what killed.

964
01:05:59,652 --> 01:06:01,449
Oh my God!

965
01:06:01,487 --> 01:06:04,285
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?

966
01:06:04,323 --> 01:06:06,484
You gotta pull
yourself together, dude.

967
01:06:06,526 --> 01:06:09,893
What's the point?

968
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,125
Look at you...
eating junk food,

969
01:06:16,169 --> 01:06:19,764
wearing fake beards,

970
01:06:19,806 --> 01:06:22,934
and we found your costume
in the garbage outside.

971
01:06:22,975 --> 01:06:25,466
Yeah, well, I'm not
the Dragonfly anymore.

972
01:06:25,511 --> 01:06:28,344
But you said the Hourglass
was going to kill thousands of people.

973
01:06:28,381 --> 01:06:31,578
I told you I'm no hero.
All right? Aunt Lucille's dead,

974
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:33,448
I've rejected the only girl
I've ever loved

975
01:06:33,486 --> 01:06:35,784
and I can't even fly.

976
01:06:37,256 --> 01:06:40,589
I wish I'd never been bitten
by that stupid dragonfly.

977
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:43,823
And maybe your father
shouldn't have given you this after all.

978
01:06:43,863 --> 01:06:47,492
Look at the words
your ancestors inscribed in that ring.

979
01:06:47,533 --> 01:06:50,730
"Honor, valor, sacrifice,

980
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,170
duty, commitment,
bravery, justice,

981
01:06:53,206 --> 01:06:55,003
integrity, brotherhood,

982
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:58,169
self-esteem, low prices,
affordable housing,

983
01:06:58,211 --> 01:07:00,873
loose-fitting pants,
cheap internet porn."

984
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:03,872
The rest is in Latin.

985
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:06,180
Rick, the hero's path
is dangerous.

986
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:09,916
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters

987
01:07:09,956 --> 01:07:13,119
is that you do it
for the best of reasons.

988
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:15,150
Helping others, Rick,

989
01:07:15,194 --> 01:07:17,560
that's what makes you
a real hero.

990
01:07:19,232 --> 01:07:21,063
Maybe you're right,

991
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,534
but even if I wanted to stop
the Hourglass,

992
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:25,434
I wouldn't know
where to start.

993
01:07:25,471 --> 01:07:28,235
I mean, where's he gonna
find thousands of people in one place?

994
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:30,765
Look.

995
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:33,643
Reporting here live from the
Empire City convention center

996
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:36,113
where thousands of people
are in one place,

997
01:07:36,149 --> 01:07:38,242
but none of them
more important

998
01:07:38,284 --> 01:07:40,684
than the attendees
of the World Humanity Awards.

999
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,154
I'll drive.

1000
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:49,755
Well, that shortcut through the playground
sure saved us some time.

1001
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:51,956
You go ahead,

1002
01:07:51,998 --> 01:07:54,262
I'll find
a place to park.

1003
01:07:56,302 --> 01:07:58,634
Mister, please stop!

1004
01:07:58,671 --> 01:08:01,139
Each year
the World Humanity Awards

1005
01:08:01,174 --> 01:08:03,438
are held to honor
the greatest achievements

1006
01:08:03,476 --> 01:08:05,740
on behalf of all humanity.

1007
01:08:05,778 --> 01:08:07,803
This gala event
is expected to draw

1008
01:08:07,847 --> 01:08:10,543
the world's most prestigious
leaders to Empire City.

1009
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,813
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."

1010
01:08:12,852 --> 01:08:16,083
Damn! Look,
there go Prince Charles.

1011
01:08:16,122 --> 01:08:18,147
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!

1012
01:08:18,191 --> 01:08:20,022
Hey, I was
in jail too, man.

1013
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:24,419
One of the guests here
is the Hourglass.

1014
01:08:24,463 --> 01:08:26,328
But which one?

1015
01:08:27,967 --> 01:08:30,231
Thank you so much
for inviting us, Mr. Landers.

1016
01:08:30,269 --> 01:08:32,464
Well, when you're being
honored by the world,

1017
01:08:32,505 --> 01:08:34,063
you want
your family with you.

1018
01:08:35,741 --> 01:08:39,177
Perhaps one day, you could
be part of our family too.

1019
01:08:40,513 --> 01:08:43,243
Ladies and gentlemen,
our first award

1020
01:08:43,282 --> 01:08:46,046
is for the medical
breakthrough of the year.

1021
01:08:46,085 --> 01:08:48,280
For his company's
pioneering work

1022
01:08:48,321 --> 01:08:50,789
in the field
of feminine hygiene

1023
01:08:50,823 --> 01:08:53,690
I award Lou Landers
douchebag of the year.

1024
01:08:55,394 --> 01:08:57,954
# Douchebag #

1025
01:08:57,997 --> 01:09:00,966
# He's the douchebag
of the year #

1026
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,560
# Now ain't
he great, folks? #

1027
01:09:03,603 --> 01:09:06,731
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #

1028
01:09:12,378 --> 01:09:15,370
# Douchebag #

1029
01:09:15,414 --> 01:09:18,850
# He's Mr. Douchebag
of the year #

1030
01:09:18,884 --> 01:09:21,478
# Look at him smile,
look at him shine #

1031
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,149
# He's the douchebag of,
the douchebag of the year. #

1032
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:28,752
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.

1033
01:09:31,364 --> 01:09:33,628
Stop right there, Landers.

1034
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:36,100
Mr. Riker.
So...

1035
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:37,602
you know.

1036
01:09:37,637 --> 01:09:39,798
You're damn right I do.

1037
01:09:41,207 --> 01:09:43,505
Someone in this auditorium
is the Hourglass.

1038
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:46,602
I need your help
to figure out who it is.

1039
01:09:46,646 --> 01:09:48,773
Now the Hourglass
could be anyone...

1040
01:09:48,814 --> 01:09:50,839
a guest of honor...

1041
01:09:50,883 --> 01:09:52,783
maybe even
a stagehand.

1042
01:09:58,224 --> 01:10:01,318
This may be nothing,
but I did see a man

1043
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,022
with what looked like
a canister of

1044
01:10:04,063 --> 01:10:05,394
cerillium.

1045
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:07,023
Who?

1046
01:10:07,066 --> 01:10:09,534
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.

1047
01:10:09,568 --> 01:10:12,298
...goes to one of the world's
greatest souls,

1048
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:15,136
His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama.

1049
01:10:21,781 --> 01:10:24,648
This man isn't who you think
he is, he's the Hourglass.

1050
01:10:24,684 --> 01:10:26,811
No no,
I'm a man of peace.

1051
01:10:26,852 --> 01:10:29,650
Shut up! You're plotting
to kill all these people

1052
01:10:29,689 --> 01:10:31,520
and I can prove it.
Show the world

1053
01:10:31,557 --> 01:10:34,287
the armor you're hiding
under these robes.

1054
01:10:35,461 --> 01:10:36,985
You can't fool me,
Hourglass.

1055
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:39,657
You're packing 10 lbs
of Cerillium under there.

1056
01:10:39,699 --> 01:10:40,757
- What?
- Ahh!

1057
01:10:44,437 --> 01:10:46,166
Take him down.

1058
01:10:50,443 --> 01:10:52,536
Tutu.

1059
01:10:57,183 --> 01:10:58,582
Peace!

1060
01:10:58,617 --> 01:10:59,982
Pea...

1061
01:11:09,829 --> 01:11:12,127
Shit shit shit shit shit.

1062
01:11:16,335 --> 01:11:18,701
You!

1063
01:11:18,738 --> 01:11:20,467
You're the Hourglass.

1064
01:11:22,742 --> 01:11:25,176
It's a pity you saw that,
my dear.

1065
01:11:25,211 --> 01:11:30,012
Perhaps this will help
you forget.

1066
01:11:35,921 --> 01:11:37,616
What are you doing?

1067
01:11:39,859 --> 01:11:42,020
Take me.

1068
01:12:00,212 --> 01:12:02,009
Hourglass!

1069
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:12,054
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people

1070
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:14,924
who like to dress up
as their favorite heroes and villains.

1071
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,588
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!

1072
01:12:19,432 --> 01:12:21,900
Excuse me,
there is a line.

1073
01:12:23,335 --> 01:12:25,530
No, you're killing him
all wrong.

1074
01:12:25,571 --> 01:12:28,540
It's like this.

1075
01:12:28,574 --> 01:12:31,441
Better.

1076
01:12:33,045 --> 01:12:34,137
Oh, shit.

1077
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:52,420
Hourglass, you'll never
get away with this!

1078
01:12:52,465 --> 01:12:55,901
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.

1079
01:12:57,837 --> 01:12:59,805
Run!

1080
01:13:03,108 --> 01:13:04,439
Yeah.

1081
01:13:15,287 --> 01:13:17,414
Goodbye...

1082
01:13:18,891 --> 01:13:19,915
little fly.

1083
01:13:22,495 --> 01:13:24,463
Dragonfly!

1084
01:13:25,498 --> 01:13:27,966
- No!
- Ahhh!

1085
01:13:46,752 --> 01:13:48,947
My eye!

1086
01:13:50,523 --> 01:13:54,118
So, are you gonna
keep the body, or...

1087
01:14:02,334 --> 01:14:03,733
Eh.

1088
01:14:03,769 --> 01:14:08,103
Dragonfly, you must
stop the Hourglass.

1089
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,843
I can't.

1090
01:14:11,877 --> 01:14:13,845
I can't fly.

1091
01:14:13,879 --> 01:14:16,575
If there is one lesson
my life can teach,

1092
01:14:16,615 --> 01:14:20,107
it is that the spirit
is stronger than the body.

1093
01:14:20,152 --> 01:14:22,382
The hero comes from within.

1094
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,514
Those are
Celine Dion lyrics.

1095
01:14:24,557 --> 01:14:27,583
Whatever.
It's still true.

1096
01:14:28,827 --> 01:14:30,158
You're right.

1097
01:14:37,336 --> 01:14:39,327
It's working.

1098
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:42,873
Sorry.

1099
01:14:43,876 --> 01:14:45,366
Watch, Dragonfly,

1100
01:14:45,411 --> 01:14:47,641
as your city dies.

1101
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:01,686
Where... am I?

1102
01:15:01,727 --> 01:15:03,957
You're with me,

1103
01:15:03,996 --> 01:15:06,430
your lover.

1104
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:13,470
Dragonfly!

1105
01:15:15,608 --> 01:15:17,098
No.

1106
01:15:19,278 --> 01:15:22,975
- No.
- Only now do you understand.

1107
01:15:24,249 --> 01:15:27,116
Oh, come...

1108
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:29,853
Aha!

1109
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:33,090
I need you to jerk this off.

1110
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,693
Yeah.

1111
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:38,196
There's not enough time.

1112
01:15:40,933 --> 01:15:42,628
Oh fuck.

1113
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:52,803
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!

1114
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:54,836
Jill!

1115
01:15:57,182 --> 01:15:59,047
Gotcha.

1116
01:16:00,786 --> 01:16:03,016
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen

1117
01:16:03,055 --> 01:16:04,955
to the girl I love, did you?

1118
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:06,685
Well, we're still
falling.

1119
01:16:06,725 --> 01:16:09,922
Damn it!
If only I could fly.

1120
01:16:09,962 --> 01:16:11,987
Maybe I wasn't cut out
to be a hero.

1121
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:15,023
You know, maybe I was meant
to have a normal job... an accountant,

1122
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:16,364
a gym teacher.

1123
01:16:16,402 --> 01:16:19,337
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!

1124
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:21,339
I don't care
what happens anymore.

1125
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:23,273
If I die, I die happily
in your arms.

1126
01:16:23,308 --> 01:16:26,573
You're my hero, Rick Riker,
and I love you.

1127
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:34,952
Yes!
Oh, thank God!

1128
01:16:34,987 --> 01:16:36,887
We only have
50 stories left.

1129
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:38,719
Hang on.

1130
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:52,029
Thank you, Dragonfly.

1131
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:54,869
Because of you, our city
is safe at last.

1132
01:16:54,907 --> 01:16:58,138
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!

1133
01:16:58,177 --> 01:17:00,338
It's a happy ending
for us all.

1134
01:17:00,379 --> 01:17:03,041
Let's go get some dinner. I'm buying.

1135
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,714
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.

1136
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:10,848
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice

1137
01:17:10,889 --> 01:17:13,858
I will forever be
a superhero...

1138
01:17:18,964 --> 01:17:21,057
I am the Hourglass!

1139
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:25,059
# Darkness has found you,
evil surrounds you #

1140
01:17:25,104 --> 01:17:29,404
# No one to save you,
we're almost out of time #

1141
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:32,433
# What do you do when
nothing can be done? #

1142
01:17:33,946 --> 01:17:36,938
# Where do you go
with nowhere left to run? #

1143
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:42,477
# Where is the one
who stands up and tells you #

1144
01:17:42,521 --> 01:17:46,855
# I'm here to save you?
We're almost out of time #

1145
01:17:46,892 --> 01:17:49,952
# Nobody knows just who
he's trying to be #

1146
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:54,296
# Behind this mask, his wings
and suit of green #

1147
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:59,228
# Just in time to reach up
for the sky #

1148
01:17:59,271 --> 01:18:04,470
# And fly away #

1149
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:07,809
# Don't worry you're safe #

1150
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:13,080
# In my arms,
'cause it takes your love #

1151
01:18:13,118 --> 01:18:16,417
# To lift me up,
it's safe to say #

1152
01:18:17,756 --> 01:18:20,589
# Jill and I were always
meant to be #

1153
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:25,825
# So I will show you why
I'm here to stay #

1154
01:18:25,864 --> 01:18:28,492
# Don't they know that
I'll protect you? #

1155
01:18:28,534 --> 01:18:30,764
# Don't they know
they'll have to get through #

1156
01:18:30,803 --> 01:18:33,397
# Me #

1157
01:18:33,438 --> 01:18:36,805
# Don't worry yourself... #

1158
01:18:43,282 --> 01:18:45,409
Your time is up!

1159
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:48,010
# Watch out behind you #

1160
01:18:48,053 --> 01:18:50,214
# This is designed to #

1161
01:18:50,255 --> 01:18:52,450
# Quickly remind you #

1162
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:54,516
# We're almost out of time #

1163
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,529
# Somebody tell me what
he's trying to be #

1164
01:18:59,064 --> 01:19:02,761
# Behind his mask, his wings,
his suit of green #

1165
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:06,760
# Just in time to reach up
for the sky #

1166
01:19:06,805 --> 01:19:11,674
# And fly away #

1167
01:19:12,811 --> 01:19:15,371
# Don't worry you're safe #

1168
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:20,646
# In my arms,
'cause it takes your love #

1169
01:19:20,686 --> 01:19:24,417

# So I will show you why
I'm here to stay #

1172
01:19:33,265 --> 01:19:35,859
# Don't you worry,
I'm the one #

1173
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:38,369
# Who let's them know
that I'll protect you #

1174
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:42,169
# Don't they know they'll
have to get through me? #

1175
01:19:43,342 --> 01:19:45,970
# Don't worry you're safe... #

1176
01:19:47,179 --> 01:19:50,410
# In my arms so green #

1177
01:19:50,449 --> 01:19:55,148
# It's easy. #

1178
01:19:55,187 --> 01:19:58,384
#I need a hero #

1179
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,188
#I need a hero #

1180
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:09,996
# I'm calling out,
I want you here #

1181
01:20:10,035 --> 01:20:12,629
# This is my 011 #

1182
01:20:12,671 --> 01:20:16,072
# I'm sinking down
into the fear #

1183
01:20:16,108 --> 01:20:18,167
# That I just can't outrun #

1184
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:21,373
# To save myself
all I can see #

1185
01:20:21,413 --> 01:20:24,109
# Is that I've got
no choice #

1186
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:27,084
# I cry for help
and pray you'll be #

1187
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,815
# The one who hears
my voice #

1188
01:20:29,855 --> 01:20:31,652
# I need a hero #

1189
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:35,421

to come true #

1199
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:08,022
