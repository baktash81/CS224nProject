1
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:54,410
No, Dolores!

2
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,375
Leave me be!

3
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:58,591
Let go of me!

4
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,530
Let go of me, Dolores!

5
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:04,718
Let me go!

6
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,611
Please, Dolores.

7
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:11,581
Got a certified letter here.

8
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,783
Never believe what happened
down at the dock.

9
00:02:15,546 --> 00:02:17,954
Dolores Claiborne, what the hell are you....

10
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:20,128
Oh, my God.

11
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,179
What have you done?

12
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:30,928
Put it down. Do you hear me?
Just put it down.

13
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:34,808
Jesus, Dolores.

14
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:42,315
Oh, God.

15
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:44,901
Oh, my God.

16
00:02:46,326 --> 00:02:47,607
You killed her.

17
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:14,636
-So you lose the picture.
-Not happening.

18
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:15,934
It"s half a page.

19
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:17,849
I"ll let you write the caption.

20
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:20,776
-Come on, Peter. It"s crucial.
-It"s salad.

21
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,897
I"m setting up the whole campaign.

22
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:25,194
It"s a better piece without it.

23
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:27,488
You already said it was brilliant.

24
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:30,409
I said it was wonderful.

25
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,447
-There"s a difference?
-Yeah.

26
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,237
Half a page.

27
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,790
Fine.

28
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:42,629
I only left it in so you"d cut it out anyway.

29
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,126
I"m ready for Arizona.

30
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,756
You should see what l have
for the malpractice piece.

31
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:49,754
-The surgeon"s ex-wife--
-Wait a minute.

32
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,762
Had her on the phone
for 20 minutes last night.

33
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,570
-I haven"t assigned you that story.
-You will.

34
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:56,223
Slow down.

35
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:59,394
Come on, Peter. There"s a book here.

36
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:00,857
I deserve this.

37
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,937
Why does every story have to be do or die
with you?

38
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:06,978
You"re not the only writer here, okay?

39
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:10,655
I"ve got a dozen people out there
to keep happy. You know that.

40
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,720
Great.

41
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,909
So now you"re not only not fucking me
anymore, you"re fucking me.

42
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:21,164
What is it, Helen?

43
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:22,997
There"s a fax here for Selena.

44
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:24,209
From Phoenix?

45
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:27,382
No, it"s a clipping
from the Bangor Daily News.

46
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,751
"Socialite Dead,
Housekeeper Held for Questioning.

47
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:34,179
-"Mrs. Dolores St. George of--"
-Where"s the cover sheet?

48
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,848
Fax?

49
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:35,590
Forget it.

50
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:38,113
They"re hardly out of the 19th century
up here.

51
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:40,359
Are you kidding?

52
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:43,779
No, there"s no motel. One restaurant.

53
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,788
They"ve got me sleeping
on a cot in the town hall.

54
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:50,400
Tell him to relax. This is no vacation.

55
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,440
I"ll be back on the mainland
as soon as l wrap this up.

56
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,387
-Can l help you?
-Yes. I"m looking for Dolores Claiborne.

57
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:09,540
And you are?

58
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:10,805
I"m her daughter.

59
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:13,725
I"m John Mackey.

60
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:16,562
-Detective, Maine State Police.
-Hello.

61
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:20,442
Would you please call
Constable Stamshaw?

62
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,570
-Get him to come right out.
-Yes, sir.

63
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,485
I"m sorry.

64
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:26,985
No smoking. Public building.

65
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:31,657
We"ve met before, Miss St. George.

66
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,746
Have we?

67
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:34,996
You were about 13.

68
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,955
What year was that, the eclipse?

69
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:41,167
Must have been, what, "75?

70
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,510
I was the investigator...

71
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:45,304
...when your father died.

72
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:47,388
We met at the hearing.

73
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,594
What"s up, John?

74
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:51,678
Miss St. George is here.

75
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:53,766
Selena?

76
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:57,185
Oh, my gravy.

77
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:58,936
Frank Stamshaw.

78
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,522
Marshall"s brother.

79
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,393
-Right.
-Jonesport High.

80
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,566
-Of course. How are you?
-It"s been quite a while, l guess.

81
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,330
Certainly has.

82
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:11,445
To be honest,
l"m surprised to see you here.

83
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:14,990
Your mom"s been pretty firm
about us not trying to contact you.

84
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:18,459
-I didn"t know Dolores made any calls.
-She didn"t call.

85
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:21,370
I saw the Bangor paper.
It was faxed to my office.

86
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:22,460
And where"s that?

87
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,377
I came up from New York.

88
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:27,900
Look, is she here or not?

89
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:29,463
-Yeah. She"s right upstairs.
-Thank you.

90
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:31,136
But....

91
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:32,304
John?

92
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:36,560
Is she under arrest?

93
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:37,807
Technically, no.

94
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,560
Detective Mackey came last night,
and we"re just starting.

95
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:42,683
On what?

96
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:45,234
We"ve scheduled an inquest
for Monday morning.

97
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:47,362
We"ll sort things out over the weekend.

98
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:49,738
If she"s not under arrest
why is she in custody?

99
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:52,199
Right, okay. Vera Donovan is dead.

100
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,499
There"s an autopsy in Machais
this morning.

101
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,994
And, you know...

102
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,412
...she died from a fall.

103
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:03,666
Your mother was the only person
with Mrs. Donovan at the time.

104
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,460
That was her job, wasn"t it?

105
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,501
I"m afraid, Miss St. George...

106
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:14,470
...there"s a little more to this
than what you may have read in the paper.

107
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:24,680
What are you doing?

108
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,191
Straightening up this friggin" mess,
is what l"m doing.

109
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:30,606
Gorry, but this place is a dump.

110
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:33,447
Jesus. You"re a suspect, you"re not a maid.

111
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,363
Just leave that be.

112
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:37,531
There"s someone to see you here.

113
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,199
I told you, l don"t want no lawyer.

114
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,294
It"s your daughter.

115
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:57,990
My God.

116
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:58,638
Look at you.

117
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,563
You cut your hair.

118
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:10,981
I didn"t....

119
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:16,156
You call her?

120
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:17,989
Is that what you did?

121
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:22,164
-Jeezly crow, you got some nerve.
-She"s here on her own.

122
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:29,996
Look at you.

123
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,754
I"m just....

124
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,602
My God.

125
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:47,351
Is it really you?

126
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:02,452
Look.

127
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:07,545
-Hey, Ms. Claiborne!
-Kill anyone else today?

128
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:10,796
Not yet. When l change my mind,
l know exactly where l"ll start.

129
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:12,625
-Go home.
-Where"s the car?

130
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,675
Right there across the street.

131
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:17,629
You"ve been living at the Donovan"s.

132
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:18,968
It"s a crime scene now.

133
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,966
I got my own house, and you know it.

134
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:23,894
We"d like her to stay here for at least
the next four days.

135
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:27,643
If l decide to make my grand escape
to South America, l"ll let you know.

136
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:31,180
-I"d appreciate it.
-One last thing, Mrs. St. George.

137
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:32,646
Name is Claiborne!

138
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:34,943
I changed it when Joe died,
and you know it.

139
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:37,320
I"m very sorry, Ms. Claiborne.

140
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,325
"Morning, Pam.

141
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,616
I"m sorry, but l think it"s for the best
if you got some legal representation.

142
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,988
You"re sorry, are you?

143
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,578
Last time you were sorry was
when you had to use the pay toilet...

144
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,913
...and the string on your pet dime broke.

145
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:16,773
I"m just muzzy here,
trying to think of what to say.

146
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,111
All grown up...

147
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:22,781
...looking so....

148
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,610
You turned out a beautiful woman, Selena.

149
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:28,380
I just can"t believe you"re here.

150
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,350
That makes two of us.

151
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,872
There must be a reason
why you go out of your way...

152
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,430
...to antagonize them like that.

153
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:43,530
Sometimes being a bitch
is all a woman has to hold onto.

154
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:49,640
Nice car.

155
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,110
It"s a rental.

156
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:55,147
You pay by the day or by the week?

157
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,640
I assume that"s your way of asking
how long l"m staying.

158
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,750
Good gorry, you"re more nervous than me.

159
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,816
I have to be in Phoenix on Monday.

160
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:10,245
It"s a big story. I"m trying to get out of it,
but it may not be possible, all right?

161
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,250
I didn"t kill her.

162
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,922
I didn"t push her down
that friggin" staircase.

163
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,172
That"s what you want to know?

164
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,758
Well, l"m telling you.

165
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:30,950
I did not murder that bitch any more
than l"m wearing a diamond tiara.

166
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,200
He"s got an eyewitness...

167
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:36,200
...who puts you standing over a dead body
with a rolling pin.

168
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,437
When did you start smoking?

169
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:40,730
Are you not listening to me?
They"re talking murder here.

170
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:45,613
You"re lucky l didn"t have to post bail.

171
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:14,764
Spooky, ain"t it?

172
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,560
Can"t stand out here all day.

173
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,736
What a mess.

174
00:15:22,904 --> 00:15:24,564
A regular bunch of artistes.

175
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,242
Look at this mess.

176
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,907
Cheese and crackers.

177
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:42,379
Friggin" little bastards.

178
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,666
I"ve got an idea who they are, too.

179
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,510
Let me try.

180
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:29,583
Selena.

181
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,510
Get in the house.

182
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:38,221
Selena, l said get in the house, right now.

183
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:41,228
I am in the house.

184
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:16,847
It"s cold, l know.

185
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,643
God, it"s a dust bowl.

186
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:25,724
Thank God l kept the electric up.

187
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:31,360
I got some wood.
We"ll have hot water pretty quick.

188
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:36,613
Clean linens upstairs, last l looked.

189
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:41,621
Longer you stand there,
the more boogery it"s gonna feel.

190
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:44,872
It"s dead.

191
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,502
It"s off three years, at least.

192
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:52,795
I"d know that if l called more often, right?

193
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,461
You called Vera"s last Christmas.

194
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:00,514
The lines go both ways, Mother.

195
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:09,482
Look, this isn"t gonna work.
I need a phone.

196
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,645
I"m gonna stay at the motel.

197
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:13,437
It"s closed.

198
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:15,198
It"s off-season.

199
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,658
What about Riner"s lnn?

200
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,411
He"s gone.

201
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,205
Burned down.

202
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,161
Must be five years ago by now.

203
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:27,951
Shit.

204
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:32,166
There"s phones in town.

205
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:34,914
-We"ve gotta go shoppin" anyway.
-I"ll go.

206
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:36,293
Alone.

207
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,554
I"ll take care of it.

208
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:42,900
You don"t know what we need.

209
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:44,932
I"m assuming it"s everything.

210
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:37,953
You know what? l've got a game.
Do you know how to count by fives?

211
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:41,998
You don't. I can teach you.
I know you are. You're smart.

212
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:46,213
Ket's count by fives. You want to play
hide and seek? Ready?

213
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:49,470
5, 10,15, 20...

214
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,635
...25, 30.

215
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:01,483
Where is she? Where did she go?
l can"t find Selena anywhere.

216
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:06,822
I hear an awful lot of thunder upstairs,
but l can"t find Selena anywhere.

217
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,906
Where is she?

218
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:09,572
Is she lost?

219
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:11,661
What was that l heard?

220
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:13,701
What did l hear?

221
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,372
I don't know. I think l heard something.

222
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,101
There you are.

223
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,185
Let me help you. That"s my job.

224
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:44,899
-You must be starving.
-All these calls.

225
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:47,107
Ended up longer than l thought.

226
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,522
Water"s warm.

227
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:51,239
You"ll want a nice, hot bath. I got this.

228
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:53,736
I spent an hour finding this radiologist...

229
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:56,748
...just so that he could tell me
he won"t go on record.

230
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,702
Is that your new story?

231
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:04,707
You say there"s hot water?

232
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,548
Why don"t you go on up
and get yourself fresh?

233
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:12,761
Go on.

234
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:14,261
It won"t bite you.

235
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:56,760
Must be a lot of pressure.

236
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,229
All them famous people...

237
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:01,772
...talking to them.

238
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:04,481
I framed the picture.

239
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:06,817
You and Richard Nixon.

240
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,778
He was selling a book.

241
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:10,608
I got a scrapbook.

242
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:12,490
Saved all your articles.

243
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,405
Drugstore in Jonesport puts them aside
for me.

244
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,287
I used to read them to Vera...

245
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,122
...when she was clear enough to listen.

246
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:25,500
You"ve done so well for yourself.

247
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,291
Is that what you think?

248
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:30,175
How well l"ve done?

249
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:36,344
Hell, even Miss Vera Kiss-My-Back-Cheeks
Donovan couldn"t help but be impressed.

250
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:40,140
Her look when she saw
that picture-on-the-cover story....

251
00:23:40,227 --> 00:23:42,635
You would"ve thought she passed a brick.

252
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,897
Maybe you ought to slow down.

253
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:49,226
Believe me, l know my limit.

254
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,358
Don"t that sound familiar?

255
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:01,655
I"d leave it alone if l were you.

256
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:04,956
I"ve seen my share of drunks, is all.

257
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,336
That"s all l"m sayin".

258
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:10,962
What did he have to be happy about?

259
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,470
I suppose making sure everyone was
as miserable as he was.

260
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,851
Is that why you killed him?

261
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,611
Oh, tough question, l guess.

262
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,760
Occupational hazard.

263
00:24:47,418 --> 00:24:49,541
Don"t feel too bad, Ma.

264
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:52,713
I asked Jean Harris the same thing once.

265
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:00,970
Let"s face it, Mother.

266
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:01,509
We barely know each other.

267
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,549
We haven"t spoken in years, and that"s
as much your doing as it is mine.

268
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,610
You didn"t kill Vera, great.

269
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:11,147
You"ve got nothing to worry about.

270
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:14,620
If you did, then you deserve
whatever comes.

271
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:15,441
Just...

272
00:25:15,738 --> 00:25:20,400
...let"s not pretend we"re in some goddamn
Norman Rockwell family reunion here.

273
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,620
I"m sorry, Ma, but that"s where we are.

274
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:26,406
And as for Dad...

275
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:29,752
...the few memories l have of him...

276
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:31,915
...l"d like to keep.

277
00:25:34,215 --> 00:25:36,291
Are you listening to me?

278
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:51,852
Daddy.

279
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:54,601
We made tapioca!

280
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:55,981
Get out.

281
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,274
We did. And it"s not instant either.

282
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:01,447
And with real cream.

283
00:26:01,825 --> 00:26:05,905
And the next thing you"ll tell me
is you made it just for me, right?

284
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:10,291
Oh, McCrea, there"s that St. George smile.

285
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:14,702
-Don"t you look just like my mother?
-That"s enough fooling around.

286
00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:17,200
Tell her she"s got homework to do.

287
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:19,131
You better do your homework.

288
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:26,970
Theo called about the chain winch.

289
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:30,720
He"s got them parts sittin" there.
Says he"ll go as high as $250.

290
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:33,471
I changed my mind. I ain"t sellin".

291
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:37,475
It"s not worth $100. You said so yourself.

292
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,770
He"s got those boats in dry dock.

293
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:41,820
He needs the damn thing.

294
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:45,360
Ain"t that the point in AA,
helpin" out your buddies?

295
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:47,816
"Helpin" out."

296
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:49,406
Shit.

297
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:57,287
Besides, if l get that thing runnin",
it"s worth $250 a month.

298
00:27:01,092 --> 00:27:03,665
Goddamn it! The soda"s warm!

299
00:27:03,803 --> 00:27:07,670
I only got home a half hour ago.
It went in first thing.

300
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:10,548
It"s hard enough drinkin" this stuff cold.

301
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:18,649
What"s so fuckin" funny?

302
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:21,562
Your pants.

303
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:24,187
They"re split clear the way up.

304
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,943
Well, ain"t that a scream!

305
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,708
You"re pretty goddamn frisky
all of a sudden, Dolores.

306
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:42,250
Let me guess. I"ll bet that Vera Donovan"s
got a whole freezer full of soda.

307
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:47,870
Take them off. I"ll mend them after supper.

308
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:48,887
What"s the deal?

309
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:52,721
You kiss that rich summer ass all day long,
you got nothin" left for me.

310
00:27:54,603 --> 00:27:58,540
Just remember, your father used to scrape
my old man"s boat...

311
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:00,853
...so don"t be gettin" high and mighty
on me.

312
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:04,484
If you still had the boats,
we wouldn"t need the extra money.

313
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:14,491
Looky here.

314
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,422
A big old smiley moon.

315
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:26,300
This is just for you.

316
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:28,677
Want to see the dark side?

317
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:31,129
Yeah, l guess it is pretty funny.

318
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:39,519
I hope you haven"t been walkin" around
like that all day long.

319
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:46,311
Why the hell"d you make me do it?

320
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:20,603
14 times 4 equals 28?

321
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:23,809
Go on.

322
00:29:23,982 --> 00:29:25,441
Sure it is. It"s 14.

323
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:26,605
It"s not!

324
00:29:26,693 --> 00:29:27,808
You take 14...

325
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:30,260
...you bend it till it snaps in half....

326
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:35,985
Could l have another, with raisins?

327
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,575
Not till after dinner.

328
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:42,657
-You were right about that real cream.
-He loved the raisins.

329
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:45,373
He said it"s my best ever.

330
00:29:45,712 --> 00:29:47,503
Mom, the cabbage.

331
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:49,831
Move it off the heat for me, will ya?

332
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:52,500
I"m just....

333
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:55,337
I"m just resting here a minute.

334
00:29:55,722 --> 00:29:57,216
That"s right.

335
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,600
She run her mouth off
till she got tuckered out.

336
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:05,104
Plum tuckered out.

337
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:12,525
Mom?

338
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,660
Do you want me to set the table?

339
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:19,741
That"d be nice. Thank you, dear.

340
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:31,881
Stay tuned now for Walter Cronkite.

341
00:30:33,426 --> 00:30:38,668
Each girl is representing a lifeguard station
up the length ofAlquinin Beach.

342
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:41,838
"Algonquin," you goddamn flylander.

343
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:55,443
Damn it, that better not be one
of my mother"s dishes.

344
00:30:58,283 --> 00:31:00,739
You ought to take a look at this.

345
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:04,912
You might want to see
what an ass is supposed to look like.

346
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:07,582
Them guys on the boat...

347
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:09,800
...always talking...

348
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:12,170
...everybody saying what a looker you are.

349
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:15,590
You know what l do?
l come right to your defense.

350
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:20,504
I say, "Shit, she may be ugly now, but you
should"ve seen her when l was drinkin"."

351
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:30,480
My mother warned me
you"d let yourself go.

352
00:31:31,817 --> 00:31:34,230
Fat ass, lousy cooking...

353
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:38,106
...running that goddamn mouth--

354
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:43,400
Guess what, Joe? l ain"t tired anymore.

355
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:48,157
You better sit back down,
if you don"t want this in your head.

356
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,204
Mommy?

357
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:56,410
Go on back to bed, honey.

358
00:31:56,174 --> 00:31:59,210
Your father and l are just having
a little discussion here.

359
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:01,380
Is everything all right?

360
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:02,717
Yeah.

361
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:04,467
Isn"t it, Joe?

362
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:08,553
Right as rain.

363
00:32:09,645 --> 00:32:11,140
You go ahead, honey.

364
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:12,891
Go on back to bed now.

365
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:14,306
Daddy?

366
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:15,728
Go on.

367
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:24,151
Oh, bitch...

368
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:27,156
...ain"t you gonna get a payback.

369
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:34,996
Go on. All l ask is that you do it quick.

370
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,496
Don"t let Selena see the mess
once it"s over.

371
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,590
You want to run me down?
You go right ahead.

372
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:43,672
You can be as mean and hurtful
as you want.

373
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:46,930
But this is the last time
you will ever hit me.

374
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:49,350
You do it again...

375
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:52,509
...one of us is going to the bone yard.

376
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,849
Well, make yourself useful, woman.

377
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:03,210
Bring me a towel for my head!

378
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,862
I"m bleeding all over my goddamn shirt!

379
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:23,122
That was one lesson he got the first time.

380
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:25,301
Maybe the only one.

381
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:31,551
It"s been a long day.

382
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,550
You must be tired.

383
00:33:35,605 --> 00:33:37,396
What do you want me to say?

384
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,726
"Thanks for sharing?"

385
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:16,433
Been looking all over for you.

386
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:19,438
It"s as cold as Christmas.

387
00:34:20,107 --> 00:34:21,601
What are you doing?

388
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:23,687
I couldn"t sleep.

389
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:27,189
Catch your death out here.

390
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,692
Tell me about Plan B.

391
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,274
I want you to tell me
you"ve got a plan, Mother.

392
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:34,943
If it"s about money, it shouldn"t be.

393
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:38,288
I"ve got my sociable security.

394
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,951
I can still work. I don"t need much.

395
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:42,420
You need a lawyer.

396
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:45,873
These guys don"t say "get an attorney"
unless they mean it.

397
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:49,876
It"s you l"m worried about, Selena.

398
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:52,880
Let"s not get off track here.

399
00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:57,470
You"re my daughter.

400
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:02,394
I know that probably feels like something
better left alone, but it"s true.

401
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:05,234
You"re still my Selena.

402
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:09,680
You"re still my good girl.
I can"t help but be worried for you.

403
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,397
My God, your hands.

404
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,905
Scary.

405
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,659
I guess if you want to know
somebody"s life...

406
00:35:24,462 --> 00:35:26,254
...you look at their hands.

407
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:37,590
That's what 22 years of Vera Donovan
will do to you.

408
00:35:43,189 --> 00:35:46,106
Mrs. Donovan, l promise
there won't be any boys.

409
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:47,769
You're excused, Susan.

410
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:49,527
But Mrs. Donovan, please!

411
00:35:49,612 --> 00:35:52,190
Kook on the bright side, dear.

412
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:54,522
You may not have gotten the job...

413
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,274
...but think what fun you"ll have
telling friends...

414
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,492
...what a bitch Vera Donovan is.

415
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,204
Next!

416
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:11,837
I"ve been working since l was 13 years old.

417
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:16,303
Started by housekeeping in a hotel.
By the time l left there and high school...

418
00:36:16,388 --> 00:36:19,223
...l was cleaning three floors all by myself.

419
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:23,225
I took care of my father"s house
after my mother passed on.

420
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,477
I"m married and l have a daughter.

421
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:29,564
This is a big house, but l"m a big woman,
and l can do a good job.

422
00:36:29,651 --> 00:36:33,151
I do not pretend to be an easy woman
to work for.

423
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:37,151
"Dolores."

424
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:43,340
This house has a number of rules.

425
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:46,121
I"m sure you"ve heard them second-hand.

426
00:36:46,418 --> 00:36:48,457
But l"ll tell you in person...

427
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,706
...so we can avoid a teary scene later on.

428
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:56,337
I like all the windows open every day
for at least two hours....

429
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:59,680
She did have her ways, did she ever.

430
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:04,500
I don't know where she got them,
but l know she was a prisoner of them.

431
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:05,935
The silver has to be checked and...

432
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,148
...cleaned every week. It may look clean
to you, but l like to see my face in it.

433
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:15,190
The tubs had to be scrubbed out every day
with vinegar and baking soda.

434
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:17,528
Tablecloths, napkins, handkerchiefs...

435
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:20,231
...everything hand-washed,
ironed and starched.

436
00:37:21,285 --> 00:37:23,611
Mildew was grounds for firing.

437
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:26,825
The sheets.
Now, that was one thing you didn't...

438
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,790
...ever want to get wrong.

439
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:31,332
You could've cut off
her high-flown snobbish nose...

440
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,374
...and she'd still smell a sheet
that had hung outside...

441
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:36,125
...from one baked in the dryer.

442
00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:39,544
Excuse me, Mr. Donovan.

443
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,963
Do you have to do that now?

444
00:37:42,431 --> 00:37:43,629
Talk to the Missus.

445
00:37:43,724 --> 00:37:45,530
Her husband...

446
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:46,388
...Jack.

447
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:48,636
He only came up once all summer.

448
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:51,304
Most of which he spent
ignoring her anyway.

449
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:54,816
She could've easily had the clothesline
near the house.

450
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:57,227
But not Vera Donovan. No, ma'am.

451
00:37:57,488 --> 00:38:00,323
She had to have the south wind blowin'
through her linens.

452
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:04,488
And that meant trampin' up and down
that hill twice a day when it was fair.

453
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:09,453
Isn"t this glorious, Jack?

454
00:38:14,004 --> 00:38:15,795
Six pins, Dolores!

455
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,665
You know that"s the way l like it.

456
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:20,919
Six pins, not five!

457
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,100
Jack?

458
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,930
It"s 4:30.

459
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:29,261
Don"t you want a cocktail?

460
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:38,445
Three square meals of bitchery
all summer long...

461
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:40,900
...but l kept my head down
and my mouth shut.

462
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:42,898
Every week that $40 went in the bank.

463
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,613
There wasn't a damn thing
she could say about it.

464
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:46,781
Thanks a lot.

465
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:49,113
As much as she crabbed
that whole summer...

466
00:38:49,205 --> 00:38:52,206
...l must have done something right.
Come Kabor Day....

467
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:57,204
I"m sure your winter schedule
is rather hectic...

468
00:38:57,672 --> 00:39:00,839
...but l need someone to touch up
the house once a week.

469
00:39:01,342 --> 00:39:02,457
Dusting.

470
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,385
Keeping the mice company.

471
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:06,632
I could do that for you.

472
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:09,255
$12 a week was...

473
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,940
...what l had in mind.

474
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:14,724
That"d be fine.

475
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:18,473
I"ll see you next Memorial Day.

476
00:39:25,116 --> 00:39:27,108
That winter, Jack Donovan passed on.

477
00:39:27,785 --> 00:39:29,908
He died in a car crash in Maryland.

478
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:32,743
I wasn't sure what to expect from Vera.

479
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,287
Gorry if she didn't show up in high spirits.

480
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:39,326
I believe l told you more than once...

481
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:43,254
...l want the welcome mats
with the letters facing out and not in.

482
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:44,505
Yes, ma"am.

483
00:39:44,593 --> 00:39:46,420
She'd sold her place in Baltimore.

484
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:49,171
She was moving up permanent.

485
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:52,960
Get that out of here and put that there.

486
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,937
And take away this disgusting sofa.

487
00:39:55,104 --> 00:39:58,104
It took two days to load in
her majesty's palace.

488
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,685
She offered me full time and l took it.
I took it.

489
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,103
I knew what kind of hell it would be.

490
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:08,114
Hell ain't something
you get thrown into overnight.

491
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,822
The real hell comes on you as slow...

492
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,283
...and steady as a line
of wet winter sheets.

493
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:16,114
Snot leaking offyour nose.

494
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,165
Your hands so cold and raw...

495
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:20,202
...you start wishing they'd go numb.

496
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,786
It's only December.
You know by February...

497
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:27,798
...the skin's gonna be cracked so bad, it'll
break open and bleed ifyou clench a fist.

498
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:29,298
But you go to the next...

499
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:33,385
...and the next and before you know it,
those sheets stretch out 20 years.

500
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,467
Nobody made you stay there.

501
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:39,392
-I needed the money.
-Not in the beginning, not $40 a week.

502
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:41,557
That"s when l needed it the most.

503
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,725
Not for me, for you.

504
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,813
That"s perfect.

505
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:47,398
So it"s my fault.

506
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:50,775
You think your father cared
if you ever got off this island?

507
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:52,491
Here we go.

508
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,710
I put that money...

509
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:57,790
...every week, l put it away
in your account...

510
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:58,493
...for school.

511
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:01,335
To get you out of this place,
once and for all.

512
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:04,579
Well, it worked like a charm.

513
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:06,840
Hello, ladies.

514
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:08,925
A little morning walk?

515
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,500
Nope.

516
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:13,843
Just packing up the speed boat
so as l can make my big escape.

517
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:16,257
Something we can help you with?

518
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,520
We need a hair sample.

519
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,101
How was that?

520
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:25,143
We need a piece of your hair.
We"re running some tests.

521
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,190
-Are you now?
-Just a strand.

522
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:30,210
I think we"ll take a pass on that.

523
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,110
Look...

524
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,238
...right now it"s voluntary.

525
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,448
I"d appreciate it, is all.

526
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,244
Bring your scissors, did you?

527
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:39,363
I said we"ll pass.

528
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,532
I"ll have a warrant here this afternoon.

529
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:45,122
You want it...

530
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,373
...you cut it.

531
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:51,373
Actually, l need to pull it.

532
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,110
We need the root.

533
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,216
Go on.

534
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,890
Take what you want.

535
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,935
I ain"t doing any beauty pageants
this week.

536
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:19,321
-Anything else?
-Mother, enough.

537
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:22,663
We spoke to Sheila Jolander last night.

538
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:27,840
She said she"d heard you more than once
threaten to kill Vera Donovan.

539
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,831
Is that true?

540
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:33,172
If she"d come every day not once a week,
she"d have heard more.

541
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,584
-Get in the house.
-Vera, at the end...

542
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,470
...the way she got, it"s a wonder
l didn"t say it every hour.

543
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,591
You go ahead, Mr. Mackey.

544
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,309
You scribble that down in your pad there.

545
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,564
You make a note on that.

546
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:52,180
As long as you write down
that saying a thing and doing it...

547
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,200
...are two separate things.

548
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,690
But, your wife probably
already told you that.

549
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,491
Dolores, that"s enough.

550
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,283
My wife...

551
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,333
...Ms. Claiborne...

552
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,414
...died 12 years ago of bone cancer.

553
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,506
Natural causes.

554
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,141
Okay, l guess we"ll press on here.

555
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,304
Frank.

556
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,564
I want to get into Vera"s.

557
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:35,819
I got things up there l need.
Clothes and my personals.

558
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,653
We can go over tomorrow. We"re shipping
out Vera"s body this afternoon.

559
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,283
Fine by me.

560
00:43:43,745 --> 00:43:46,153
What the hell did l just see?

561
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:51,249
That"s the last guy in the world
you want to make an enemy out of.

562
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,244
I ain"t making one, l"m keeping one.

563
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:56,912
What is that supposed to mean?

564
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,501
You"re gonna tell me
you don"t remember him?

565
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,270
That"s all well and good, Miss St. George...

566
00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:13,772
...but you told me that at the time
of your father"s death...

567
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:17,559
...you were working as a maid in a hotel
at Jonesport.

568
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:20,260
Yes.

569
00:44:20,448 --> 00:44:21,444
Well...

570
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:23,270
...Mrs. Devereaux...

571
00:44:24,118 --> 00:44:25,696
...at the hotel....

572
00:44:26,704 --> 00:44:28,330
Remember?

573
00:44:29,707 --> 00:44:31,367
Mrs. Devereaux said...

574
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:33,784
...she was surprised to see you.

575
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:38,499
She said your mom was pretty strict about
not letting you spend the night there.

576
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:41,128
Isn"t that true?

577
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,715
I guess.

578
00:44:48,976 --> 00:44:52,310
So why did she let you stay
on that particular weekend?

579
00:44:58,694 --> 00:45:00,900
Problems at home, perhaps?

580
00:45:02,406 --> 00:45:04,399
Your mom and dad...

581
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:06,818
...is that a happy situation?

582
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:08,654
Miss St. George?

583
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:10,573
The eclipse.

584
00:45:14,334 --> 00:45:17,419
Because of the eclipse, the hotel was full.

585
00:45:18,005 --> 00:45:19,914
So the money....

586
00:45:20,507 --> 00:45:23,176
They said that we"d make twice as much.

587
00:45:26,346 --> 00:45:28,505
So this was all about money?

588
00:45:30,017 --> 00:45:31,843
My mom let me stay.

589
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:35,604
They said that we"d make twice as much.

590
00:45:37,357 --> 00:45:38,935
So your father...

591
00:45:39,276 --> 00:45:41,352
...that was just a coincidence, was it?

592
00:45:41,444 --> 00:45:43,686
How long are you gonna let this go on?

593
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:47,196
The sooner she starts telling the truth,
the sooner we"ll be done.

594
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:50,866
If he"s out to torture someone,
l"d be happy to get back in the hot seat.

595
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:55,581
Anybody who accuses me of killing
my husband, go ahead and call me Dolores.

596
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,249
Detective Mackey, you understand,
he"s just doing his job.

597
00:46:04,634 --> 00:46:06,757
Trying to turn an accident into a murder?

598
00:46:06,844 --> 00:46:10,545
Making a girl who just lost her father
cry her eyes out every night?

599
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,175
If that"s just doing his job then
you"d better put him down for overtime.

600
00:46:14,268 --> 00:46:15,976
All right, let"s split them up.

601
00:46:16,979 --> 00:46:18,390
Slow down, John.

602
00:46:18,564 --> 00:46:21,435
Five minutes, alone, without her.

603
00:46:22,735 --> 00:46:23,980
Enough, John.

604
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,813
I only need five minutes!

605
00:46:26,322 --> 00:46:27,733
I said, "Enough."

606
00:46:39,168 --> 00:46:41,920
So don"t be talkin" to me
about makin" enemies.

607
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:43,878
No, sir. No, ma"am.

608
00:46:45,341 --> 00:46:49,600
That son of a bitch has been waitin"
a long time to pick over my bones.

609
00:46:51,096 --> 00:46:52,341
Hand me that ax.

610
00:46:53,974 --> 00:46:57,580
Just look at this window.
Little piss squirts!

611
00:46:57,686 --> 00:47:01,435
I ought to call their parents
and have them come over and pay for it.

612
00:47:02,858 --> 00:47:04,851
Now l gotta go buy glass and...

613
00:47:04,943 --> 00:47:07,190
...putty and God knows what else.

614
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,317
Could have burned down
the whole goddamn house.

615
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:20,911
I thought the malpractice story
was the most important.

616
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:23,290
If you"d left the number
l"d have called yesterday.

617
00:47:23,378 --> 00:47:25,205
Yeah, right. Kook.

618
00:47:25,297 --> 00:47:27,704
The radiologist l told you about...

619
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:29,632
...he got cold feet.

620
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:32,293
But, the intern, Levitt...

621
00:47:32,637 --> 00:47:34,130
...he"s a talker.

622
00:47:34,222 --> 00:47:36,891
I thought you were going up there
to see your mother?

623
00:47:36,975 --> 00:47:39,976
It"s a small domestic drama up here, Peter.

624
00:47:40,145 --> 00:47:41,639
I can be in Phoenix Tuesday.

625
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:42,809
It'll be over Monday.

626
00:47:42,897 --> 00:47:44,973
Family things, l"ve been through it.

627
00:47:45,066 --> 00:47:46,311
They take a lot.

628
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:49,734
I am telling you, it's not a problem.

629
00:47:50,405 --> 00:47:54,983
We both want me to do this story.
I"m out of here Monday at the latest.

630
00:47:55,493 --> 00:47:56,821
You want a wet dream?

631
00:47:56,911 --> 00:47:59,236
Wait till l tell you what Kevitt said.

632
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:03,328
Are you there?

633
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,497
I gave the piece to Maureen.

634
00:48:10,925 --> 00:48:15,172
Kook, l'm sorry. I couldn't wait.
The magazine has to be first on this.

635
00:48:15,263 --> 00:48:17,932
It has nothing to do with you,
you know that.

636
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:21,305
So, l guess you"re fucking Maureen now?

637
00:48:21,435 --> 00:48:23,511
Nice try. Come on, Selena.

638
00:48:23,604 --> 00:48:25,347
You couldn't tell me to my face?

639
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,147
Look, l never promised you--

640
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:28,817
You goddamn pimp.

641
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:31,772
-Careful.
-I need this story, Peter.

642
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,449
There are other stories, better stories.

643
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:38,190
Bullshit. This was the one.

644
00:48:39,244 --> 00:48:40,240
It"s over.

645
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:41,906
Selena, it doesn"t have to be--

646
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:49,788
I"ll do this again.

647
00:49:04,728 --> 00:49:08,144
Shouldn"t you be off somewhere
analyzing my mother"s hair?

648
00:49:09,274 --> 00:49:12,643
Well, l was thinking how hard
it must be for you.

649
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,563
Protecting her like this.

650
00:49:18,074 --> 00:49:22,154
She"s a hearty soul, isn"t she?
Might just live another 50 years.

651
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:28,708
Next eclipse is due in "96.
If she gets away with it this time...

652
00:49:29,002 --> 00:49:31,789
...she might actually have
another chance to...

653
00:49:32,172 --> 00:49:35,256
...kill again, before she"s through.

654
00:49:37,594 --> 00:49:40,263
Is that something you want
on your conscience?

655
00:49:45,435 --> 00:49:47,593
I had a problem with that myself.

656
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:54,316
You know, we"re probably more alike
than you"d care to believe.

657
00:49:58,614 --> 00:50:00,108
We live alone...

658
00:50:00,366 --> 00:50:01,777
...no children.

659
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:05,350
We have our work.
My cases are my family.

660
00:50:05,454 --> 00:50:09,701
In 30 years, l"ve handled 86 homicides.
I"ve closed 85 of them...

661
00:50:10,793 --> 00:50:12,536
...to my satisfaction.

662
00:50:14,213 --> 00:50:16,455
I underestimated your mother.

663
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:20,450
It won"t happen again.

664
00:50:25,975 --> 00:50:28,430
You sent that fax to my office...

665
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:31,390
...didn"t you?

666
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:36,105
"For God will bring every work
into judgment...

667
00:50:36,193 --> 00:50:38,482
"...with every secret thing...

668
00:50:38,654 --> 00:50:41,610
"...whether it be good or evil."

669
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:44,818
You son of a bitch.

670
00:50:44,993 --> 00:50:47,318
Vera Donovan"s on my head.

671
00:50:48,497 --> 00:50:50,406
The next one"s on yours.

672
00:51:04,012 --> 00:51:05,590
You know, Selena...

673
00:51:06,765 --> 00:51:08,674
...l can"t help remembering...

674
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,940
...you were a wonderful cook.

675
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:14,518
Please.

676
00:51:14,606 --> 00:51:15,851
You were.

677
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:18,935
I can"t even defrost.

678
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,684
You put supper on the table
three nights out of five.

679
00:51:21,863 --> 00:51:23,855
I was working, l"d come back...

680
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:27,650
...you"d have the house clean,
homework done and food on the table.

681
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:35,114
You"re just out of practice, that"s all.

682
00:51:38,212 --> 00:51:41,130
You"ll find someone to look after.
You"ll see.

683
00:51:41,382 --> 00:51:43,420
It"ll all come back to you.

684
00:51:44,677 --> 00:51:46,171
Someone to look after.

685
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:48,881
You must have boyfriends.

686
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:52,301
Beautiful girl like you,
smart and out in the world.

687
00:51:57,982 --> 00:51:59,809
Are you tellin" me there"s nobody?

688
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:04,191
I"m telling you there"s a lot of nobodies.

689
00:52:12,413 --> 00:52:14,730
Friggin" yahoos.

690
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,832
Come on out here, Dolores!

691
00:52:19,128 --> 00:52:20,836
Friggin" little bastards.

692
00:52:20,963 --> 00:52:24,497
Get off the island,
you goddamn murdering bitch!

693
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:27,925
Come on down here,
you little ass-picking squirts.

694
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:31,345
How many people are you gonna kill
before they put you away?

695
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:35,182
Come on! Come on, you little chickens!

696
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,600
Going to jail this time!

697
00:52:37,813 --> 00:52:39,437
I know who you are.

698
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:43,189
Chester Lavelier and the rest of you.
Come on down here.

699
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:45,103
You got something to say to me?

700
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,520
They"re gonna put you in the chair!

701
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,384
What are you doin"?

702
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,387
What does it look like?

703
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:21,886
Selena, you"ve been drinkin".

704
00:53:22,398 --> 00:53:23,892
No shit.

705
00:53:24,484 --> 00:53:26,227
I wish you wouldn"t.

706
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:28,897
Look at me.

707
00:53:29,405 --> 00:53:32,240
Look at me. You see how l am right now?

708
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,946
What good is that gonna do?

709
00:53:37,455 --> 00:53:39,246
Because in 10 minutes...

710
00:53:39,332 --> 00:53:41,324
...l"m going to be fine.

711
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:44,285
Just give me 10 minutes.

712
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:54,217
Just give me 10 minutes!

713
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:00,680
God!

714
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:10,772
I saw your father last night.

715
00:54:10,863 --> 00:54:13,436
Did you help your ma kill your dad?

716
00:54:14,157 --> 00:54:15,189
Murderer!

717
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:22,452
Who is this?

718
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:24,360
You fat, ugly cow!

719
00:54:24,126 --> 00:54:28,622
When l find out who this is, l"ll hang
your privates from Battiscan Light!

720
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:30,125
Selena, stop that!

721
00:54:31,675 --> 00:54:33,751
Honey, it"s gonna be all right.

722
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:35,131
It won"t.

723
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,391
-My God!
-Get away!

724
00:54:48,775 --> 00:54:50,234
It was a bad patch.

725
00:54:51,152 --> 00:54:54,901
You had a bad patch,
and now you"re feeling it all over again.

726
00:54:54,989 --> 00:54:56,781
Bad patch?

727
00:54:57,575 --> 00:55:00,327
I had a fucking nervous breakdown,
Mother.

728
00:55:00,495 --> 00:55:02,238
Don"t say words like that.

729
00:55:03,498 --> 00:55:06,360
It was a hard time. You got through it.

730
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:09,664
Oh, what am l doing?

731
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:13,956
You just needed a rest, that"s all.

732
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:16,338
You snapped out of it just fine.

733
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:22,222
You can"t have one of those...

734
00:55:22,308 --> 00:55:25,428
...and get a full scholarship
to Vassar College.

735
00:55:25,978 --> 00:55:27,437
It was just a bad patch.

736
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:30,689
I must have been out of my mind
to come back here.

737
00:55:40,492 --> 00:55:42,615
Here! Over here!

738
00:55:43,537 --> 00:55:45,364
What did you do to him?

739
00:55:45,456 --> 00:55:47,413
Nothing, baby. I promise.

740
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:49,161
Shit! Look at this!

741
00:56:05,976 --> 00:56:07,351
Fuck!

742
00:56:07,561 --> 00:56:09,221
Goddamn it!

743
00:56:35,964 --> 00:56:38,455
Selena, let me take these from you here.

744
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:41,251
Dolores, l"ll take you upstairs.

745
00:56:41,553 --> 00:56:43,110
I"m gonna ask you to...

746
00:56:43,137 --> 00:56:45,593
...step very carefully on the way up.

747
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:48,900
Still taking blood samples here.

748
00:56:48,393 --> 00:56:50,385
If you feel more comfortable...

749
00:56:50,478 --> 00:56:52,934
...you can always use the back stairs.

750
00:56:59,946 --> 00:57:03,895
John, is it all right if we go upstairs
and get her things?

751
00:57:03,991 --> 00:57:05,402
Go on.

752
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,285
I"m sorry.

753
00:57:14,293 --> 00:57:17,211
He got a search warrant, so...

754
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:21,291
...had to go through it for evidence. Yep.

755
00:57:22,051 --> 00:57:23,628
It"s pretty routine.

756
00:57:23,969 --> 00:57:26,450
Okay, let"s get this over with.

757
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:29,557
So....

758
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:32,804
You can pack up and take anything
that"s not...

759
00:57:33,062 --> 00:57:34,935
...bagged or tagged.

760
00:57:35,064 --> 00:57:37,560
I know that doesn"t leave much.

761
00:57:37,983 --> 00:57:39,140
Sorry, Dolores.

762
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:44,813
I"ll give you a hand here.

763
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:04,100
Dolores, is that it then?

764
00:58:04,176 --> 00:58:06,845
No. I got something in Vera"s room.

765
00:58:07,012 --> 00:58:08,969
This room"s off-limits.

766
00:58:13,476 --> 00:58:15,683
I"m still going through things here.

767
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,850
Ms. Claiborne.

768
00:58:22,277 --> 00:58:23,356
What"s this then?

769
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,479
It"s my scrapbook.

770
00:58:25,989 --> 00:58:27,697
It"s Selena"s articles.

771
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:30,193
I"d read them to Vera.

772
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:39,117
Almost got away with it, didn"t she?

773
00:58:47,218 --> 00:58:49,543
I read that. That"s good stuff.

774
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,211
You really got him to open up there.

775
00:58:54,558 --> 00:58:56,170
Scholarship.

776
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,639
Vassar.

777
00:58:57,728 --> 00:58:59,721
Very impressive.

778
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,249
Jeezly crow.

779
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,480
Couldn"t you clean up after her?

780
00:59:28,133 --> 00:59:30,589
-What kind of people are you?
-You put that back!

781
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:32,713
You"ll tell me this is evidence?

782
00:59:32,804 --> 00:59:36,138
-That"s exactly what l"m telling you.
-Dolores, you put that down.

783
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:40,490
Goddamn it!

784
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:43,597
I"m tryin" to do you a favor here
and that"s the way you act?

785
00:59:44,107 --> 00:59:47,559
I ain"t leavin" here without my scrapbook.

786
00:59:49,863 --> 00:59:51,357
Sorry, John.

787
00:59:54,576 --> 00:59:57,696
I"ll see you day after tomorrow,
9:00 a.m. at the town hall.

788
00:59:57,871 --> 01:00:00,622
Don"t put your fur up, Frank. I"ll be there.

789
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:05,458
I have a feeling we could wrap this up
right now.

790
01:00:05,712 --> 01:00:07,788
It"s not gonna be like last time.

791
01:00:11,217 --> 01:00:12,296
Is that so?

792
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,633
Let"s just go. Okay?

793
01:00:16,389 --> 01:00:20,221
Now you listen to me, Mister Grand High
Poobah of Upper Butt Crack.

794
01:00:20,393 --> 01:00:23,560
I"m just about half past give a shit
with your fun and games.

795
01:00:23,646 --> 01:00:27,691
My husband"s death was ruled an accident
and you know it better than anyone.

796
01:00:27,817 --> 01:00:31,102
"Death by misadventure," to be exact.

797
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,479
I"m sure there"s people who"d tell you...

798
01:00:33,573 --> 01:00:35,779
...l had plenty of reasons to kill Joe.

799
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:38,155
But Vera, why the hell would l kill her?

800
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:40,446
All l am is out of a job...

801
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,366
...a nice room to sleep in.

802
01:00:42,665 --> 01:00:45,370
You don"t need a job, do you?

803
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:47,163
Motive?

804
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:52,631
I"d say $1,600,000...

805
01:00:52,758 --> 01:00:54,252
...is quite a motive.

806
01:00:54,844 --> 01:00:55,839
What?

807
01:00:55,928 --> 01:00:58,510
Your mother"s a wealthy woman, Selena.

808
01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:04,427
What the hell are you talkin" about?

809
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,437
I spoke to Vera"s lawyer
in Baltimore last night.

810
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:08,436
John.

811
01:01:08,524 --> 01:01:10,765
-She left you everything.
-Look, John--

812
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:12,526
Every last cent.

813
01:01:14,696 --> 01:01:16,689
She can"t do that.

814
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,945
You"re lyin".

815
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:22,280
You"re a millionaire, Ms. Claiborne.

816
01:01:22,454 --> 01:01:23,699
Wait a minute.

817
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:27,206
-This isn"t the place to be bringing--
-Back off.

818
01:01:27,668 --> 01:01:29,780
He"s crazy.

819
01:01:30,045 --> 01:01:31,705
That"s plain crazy.

820
01:01:34,382 --> 01:01:36,292
She"d never do that.

821
01:01:36,384 --> 01:01:39,600
Did she keep it a secret
from you, too, Selena?

822
01:01:39,304 --> 01:01:41,546
Or maybe you knew about it.

823
01:01:42,224 --> 01:01:44,500
Because this will....

824
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:46,220
I mean, hell...

825
01:01:46,353 --> 01:01:48,890
...it"s only eight years old.

826
01:01:50,899 --> 01:01:51,894
Frank!

827
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,640
You want to wait for the District Attorney
Monday morning?

828
01:01:57,155 --> 01:01:59,562
Or should we take care of this now?

829
01:02:11,878 --> 01:02:13,502
Get in the car, Mother.

830
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:18,758
Get in the goddamn car!

831
01:02:30,604 --> 01:02:32,763
You had no idea she left you the money?

832
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:34,395
I swear it.

833
01:02:34,775 --> 01:02:37,100
Over $1,000,000.

834
01:02:37,236 --> 01:02:40,569
That bitch. The malicious,
high-flown, harpin" bitch!

835
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:42,316
Cut the bullshit!

836
01:02:44,243 --> 01:02:46,700
You can afford a lawyer now.

837
01:02:52,793 --> 01:02:53,956
Car trouble?

838
01:02:54,169 --> 01:02:56,791
We"re quite fine, thank you.

839
01:03:00,134 --> 01:03:01,877
I wish l had killed her.

840
01:03:03,136 --> 01:03:04,796
Leavin" me that money.

841
01:03:05,806 --> 01:03:07,763
I wish l had!

842
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:11,308
I wish l had killed her!

843
01:03:23,573 --> 01:03:25,780
What happened in that house?

844
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:32,575
Dolores.

845
01:03:41,174 --> 01:03:43,100
Hell"s bells.

846
01:03:45,178 --> 01:03:46,458
Look who"s up.

847
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:54,845
I"m wet.

848
01:03:56,356 --> 01:03:57,814
What else is new?

849
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,348
How long this time?

850
01:04:01,194 --> 01:04:04,640
Since you last made sense?
About two days, l guess.

851
01:04:04,322 --> 01:04:08,154
Just leave me wet, don"t you?

852
01:04:09,035 --> 01:04:12,653
When l"m not thinking straight enough
to keep on you.

853
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:17,760
That"s what you do...

854
01:04:17,252 --> 01:04:18,581
...isn"t it?

855
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:22,668
Yeah, it"s a regular party around here
when you"re snoozin".

856
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:25,880
Where"s my china pig?

857
01:04:26,261 --> 01:04:29,595
There"s only 200 of them around.
Which one you want?

858
01:04:30,098 --> 01:04:33,990
Are you being smart?

859
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:37,177
No, Vera. If l"d been smart, l"d have done
workin" for you a long time ago.

860
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:39,763
Let"s see what you got left.

861
01:04:41,276 --> 01:04:44,645
Goddamn it! Are you gonna sit here
and marinate in it? Come on.

862
01:04:47,198 --> 01:04:50,235
You"re gonna get on this fanny pan
one way or another.

863
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:51,608
Come on.

864
01:04:53,204 --> 01:04:54,698
There we go.

865
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:59,412
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

866
01:05:02,797 --> 01:05:04,920
Now hold on with your good arm.

867
01:05:05,049 --> 01:05:06,876
Hold on this time.

868
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:08,795
Push with your good leg.

869
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:12,216
I don"t know why you make me do this.

870
01:05:16,102 --> 01:05:18,557
I hate this nightgown.

871
01:05:20,064 --> 01:05:23,231
Your days of silk and satin are over, Vera.

872
01:05:23,776 --> 01:05:26,232
From now on it"s wash "n" wear.

873
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:33,200
You"re poisoning me...

874
01:05:33,285 --> 01:05:35,290
...aren"t you, Dolores?

875
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:36,746
Slow...

876
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:38,241
...but sure.

877
01:05:38,332 --> 01:05:40,206
That"s what you"re doing.

878
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:41,781
No, ma"am.

879
01:05:41,919 --> 01:05:44,836
When l"m ready to settle your hash,
l won"t use poison.

880
01:05:44,922 --> 01:05:49,500
I"ll just shove you out the window. There"ll
be one less smelly bitch in the world.

881
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:57,960
Don"t we have a hair...

882
01:05:57,184 --> 01:06:00,101
...across our ass today.

883
01:06:00,187 --> 01:06:02,512
Dolores Claiborne.

884
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,482
I want my china pig!

885
01:06:08,904 --> 01:06:11,276
Get off your royal duff and go and get it.

886
01:06:11,364 --> 01:06:13,274
We both know you can do it.

887
01:06:13,366 --> 01:06:14,529
Do you good.

888
01:06:14,701 --> 01:06:15,780
You need the exercise.

889
01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:17,529
What l need...

890
01:06:17,954 --> 01:06:21,786
...is someone who"ll do as they"re told!

891
01:06:22,459 --> 01:06:23,953
Don"t go too far, Vera.

892
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:26,701
I"ll go as far...

893
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:30,300
...as l damn well want!

894
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:32,874
Yes.

895
01:06:33,428 --> 01:06:34,708
I will!

896
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:41,590
If this...

897
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:45,120
...is what"s going to pass as living...

898
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:50,562
...l"ll damn well say what l want!

899
01:06:50,737 --> 01:06:53,572
"Oh, this little piggy had champagne.

900
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,780
"This little piggy ate beans."

901
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:58,358
I"ll fix you some tea. You"ll feel better.

902
01:06:58,578 --> 01:06:59,906
No!

903
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:01,656
I won"t.

904
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,380
I won"t feel better.

905
01:07:07,837 --> 01:07:09,913
I never will.

906
01:07:10,506 --> 01:07:13,673
I"ll never feel better again.

907
01:08:19,157 --> 01:08:20,900
Oh, my God.

908
01:08:44,724 --> 01:08:46,681
What the hell are you doing?

909
01:08:48,853 --> 01:08:51,178
Get out of my way, Dolores.

910
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:53,847
Where do you think you"re going?

911
01:08:56,277 --> 01:08:58,519
What in God"s name has gotten into you?

912
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:02,652
Let go of me, Dolores!

913
01:09:05,953 --> 01:09:07,578
Leave me go!

914
01:09:25,514 --> 01:09:26,545
Oh, my God!

915
01:09:31,728 --> 01:09:33,271
Oh, my God.

916
01:09:34,523 --> 01:09:35,898
Don"t try to talk.

917
01:09:36,817 --> 01:09:38,525
I"m going to go call the doctor.

918
01:09:38,777 --> 01:09:40,568
No doctor.

919
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:41,894
No hospital.

920
01:09:42,030 --> 01:09:43,939
You"re gonna be all right, Vera.

921
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:47,492
You just lie still, don"t move.

922
01:09:47,828 --> 01:09:49,571
You"re gonna be fine.

923
01:09:51,414 --> 01:09:55,790
Dolores Claiborne says l"m gonna be fine.

924
01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:57,918
What a relief it is...

925
01:09:58,088 --> 01:10:01,500
...to have a professional opinion.

926
01:10:01,925 --> 01:10:03,502
Why?

927
01:10:04,094 --> 01:10:06,252
Why"d you do this, Vera?

928
01:10:06,429 --> 01:10:08,718
-Why?
-Because...

929
01:10:08,848 --> 01:10:10,426
...l hate...

930
01:10:10,934 --> 01:10:13,638
...the smell of being old.

931
01:10:14,562 --> 01:10:16,354
I"m tired...

932
01:10:16,522 --> 01:10:18,764
...and l want to be done.

933
01:10:20,443 --> 01:10:23,160
Will you help me, Dolores?

934
01:10:24,197 --> 01:10:26,569
Will you please...

935
01:10:27,366 --> 01:10:29,276
...help me die?

936
01:10:30,453 --> 01:10:34,237
Don"t let me die in some hospital.

937
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:36,869
Kill me now.

938
01:10:56,562 --> 01:10:59,765
If you really want to help me...

939
01:11:01,066 --> 01:11:03,308
...please hurry.

940
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:08,401
Dolores, got a certified letter here.

941
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,730
You don"t believe me, do you?

942
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,289
You think l killed her.

943
01:11:20,627 --> 01:11:22,999
What l think doesn"t mean shit.

944
01:11:24,506 --> 01:11:27,626
It"s the rest of the world
you better start worrying about.

945
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:47,107
I made a list of attorneys.

946
01:11:49,114 --> 01:11:51,521
These are all the big muscle firms
in New York.

947
01:11:51,699 --> 01:11:54,321
It could take a couple of days,
that"s why on Monday...

948
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,818
...you"re not gonna say a word.

949
01:11:58,873 --> 01:12:00,360
Take it.

950
01:12:17,475 --> 01:12:20,262
In case you missed it,
l"m trying to help you.

951
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:24,436
You think l give a fiddler"s fuck
what anybody else says about me?

952
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:26,184
Oh, Jesus.

953
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:27,687
It"s you.

954
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,529
What you think is the only thing left
that"s important.

955
01:12:30,654 --> 01:12:32,694
I can"t send you to prison.

956
01:12:33,407 --> 01:12:35,566
You think that"s the end of the world?

957
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,867
Gorry, that"d be a relief.

958
01:12:38,078 --> 01:12:39,573
Sit and sleep...

959
01:12:39,872 --> 01:12:41,331
...three meals served every day.

960
01:12:41,415 --> 01:12:44,167
Maybe you"re just happier being miserable.
Is that it?

961
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:45,956
Is that it, Mother?

962
01:12:47,379 --> 01:12:49,870
If it makes it easier for you.

963
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:53,378
Vera"s a bitch. She"s abusive,
she"s mean, she"s cheap.

964
01:12:53,886 --> 01:12:55,000
Why not leave?

965
01:12:55,179 --> 01:12:56,839
Why not just walk?

966
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,590
Like they do in New York?

967
01:12:59,725 --> 01:13:01,302
Someone hurts me...

968
01:13:01,727 --> 01:13:03,102
...l leave.

969
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:06,349
Believe me, l learned that long
before l got to New York.

970
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,773
I"m not the one that hurt you.

971
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,940
What is that supposed to mean?

972
01:13:14,448 --> 01:13:16,108
You"re blaming him?

973
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:18,608
Is that what we"re into now?

974
01:13:19,786 --> 01:13:21,446
He was a drunk.

975
01:13:22,038 --> 01:13:24,327
Barely got out of his own way.

976
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:26,788
Fine...

977
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,751
...maybe he hit you.

978
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,628
I don"t remember it.

979
01:13:31,506 --> 01:13:33,748
You don"t seem to remember
much of anything.

980
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:37,175
But then, he"s not exactly around
to defend himself, is he?

981
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:46,560
You honest to God don"t remember,
do you?

982
01:13:48,648 --> 01:13:49,928
Look.

983
01:13:53,611 --> 01:13:55,485
Here"s the goddamn list.

984
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,240
You do what you want with it.

985
01:13:58,116 --> 01:14:00,730
That"s why you"re so unsettled, ain"t it?

986
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,488
Unsettled?

987
01:14:01,869 --> 01:14:04,360
Don"t you mean "boogery," Mother?

988
01:14:04,997 --> 01:14:07,156
If you"re attempting
a meaningful analysis...

989
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,207
...perhaps we"d best define our terms.

990
01:14:09,377 --> 01:14:11,535
A cornerstone of critical thinking...

991
01:14:11,629 --> 01:14:13,787
...is communicating
with an agreed vocabulary.

992
01:14:13,881 --> 01:14:15,423
Go have another drink.

993
01:14:15,549 --> 01:14:18,500
No, l"ve had my fun for the night.

994
01:14:20,763 --> 01:14:25,508
You sit down right this minute
and you can just stow that Vassar shit.

995
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:34,973
We"re gonna sit down at this table,
you and me...

996
01:14:35,527 --> 01:14:36,938
...and we"re gonna have a drink.

997
01:14:37,029 --> 01:14:38,737
When we"re through....

998
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:40,200
When l"m through...

999
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:45,260
...you can run upstairs and take whichever
of those little pills makes you feel the best.

1000
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:04,712
Don"t say a goddamn word.

1001
01:15:08,602 --> 01:15:10,974
Before you get too deep in that
to make sense...

1002
01:15:11,062 --> 01:15:13,138
...take a look at her report card.

1003
01:15:13,356 --> 01:15:14,815
I saw it.

1004
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:16,729
So what?

1005
01:15:17,527 --> 01:15:19,401
Everybody slips now and then.

1006
01:15:19,529 --> 01:15:20,727
Can l be excused?

1007
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:22,821
Not till you say how an honor student...

1008
01:15:22,907 --> 01:15:24,651
...who skips the seventh grade...

1009
01:15:24,743 --> 01:15:28,491
...goes from straight A"s to C"s and D"s
in two semesters.

1010
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,371
Will you leave her alone already?

1011
01:15:30,456 --> 01:15:33,244
It"s not like you were some great genius
at school.

1012
01:15:34,586 --> 01:15:38,535
No Claiborne wasn"t even born
in a hospital, for chrissake.

1013
01:15:38,715 --> 01:15:40,375
May l please be excused?

1014
01:15:40,466 --> 01:15:41,842
No, you may not.

1015
01:15:42,051 --> 01:15:44,258
Yes, you may. Go right ahead, dear.

1016
01:15:50,643 --> 01:15:51,971
Thanks a lot.

1017
01:15:52,103 --> 01:15:53,930
You better learn to stow it.

1018
01:15:54,021 --> 01:15:55,978
You"ll drive her right out the door.

1019
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:11,618
Mom, what are you doing here?

1020
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:15,869
Thought you and l might ride back
on the ferry together. You mind company?

1021
01:16:23,634 --> 01:16:25,294
Beautiful, ain"t it?

1022
01:16:28,806 --> 01:16:31,297
You used to be beautiful too.

1023
01:16:33,143 --> 01:16:35,170
Why ain"t you anymore?

1024
01:16:37,314 --> 01:16:39,935
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

1025
01:16:48,825 --> 01:16:50,617
It"s drugs, ain"t it?

1026
01:16:52,329 --> 01:16:53,953
You"ve changed.

1027
01:16:54,831 --> 01:16:56,740
You"re 13 years old, you"re smoking pot.

1028
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:59,122
Where do you get it?
How long"s it been going on?

1029
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:00,669
I don"t do drugs, Mother.

1030
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:07,000
Whatever trouble you"re in
won"t change my love for you.

1031
01:17:07,344 --> 01:17:10,926
I can"t begin to help you out of it
till you tell me the truth.

1032
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:14,969
Are you pregnant?

1033
01:17:15,143 --> 01:17:16,685
Get real.

1034
01:17:16,853 --> 01:17:20,560
You want to end up like me?
Dumb and stuck?

1035
01:17:20,273 --> 01:17:23,600
Think l push you so hard
in school to stay in a uniform...

1036
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:26,270
...and clean up after people forever?
ls that what you want?

1037
01:17:26,362 --> 01:17:27,856
I"m not pregnant.

1038
01:17:28,114 --> 01:17:29,312
Then....

1039
01:17:29,574 --> 01:17:31,981
What is it?
What the hell"s going on with you?

1040
01:17:32,076 --> 01:17:34,235
-Leave me alone.
-I won"t leave you alone.

1041
01:17:34,328 --> 01:17:37,116
We"ll ride the ferry all day till you say...

1042
01:17:37,206 --> 01:17:38,120
...what"s wrong.

1043
01:17:38,207 --> 01:17:39,156
Leave me be!

1044
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,741
-Why won"t you talk to me?
-Don"t touch me!

1045
01:17:41,836 --> 01:17:42,749
What?

1046
01:17:42,837 --> 01:17:44,379
Stop it!

1047
01:17:45,256 --> 01:17:46,584
I got you.

1048
01:17:47,508 --> 01:17:49,168
Get off of me!

1049
01:17:49,468 --> 01:17:51,710
What is the matter with you?

1050
01:17:52,179 --> 01:17:53,721
Talk to me!

1051
01:17:55,391 --> 01:17:57,182
Where did you get this?

1052
01:17:57,518 --> 01:17:59,120
What"re you doin"?

1053
01:17:59,228 --> 01:18:01,635
This is your grandma St. George"s cameo.

1054
01:18:02,273 --> 01:18:03,815
-It"s mine.
-What did you do?

1055
01:18:03,899 --> 01:18:05,477
Did you go in your father"s closet?

1056
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,647
Mom, please....

1057
01:18:06,735 --> 01:18:10,567
-Selena, did you steal this?
-No! lt"s mine.

1058
01:18:18,413 --> 01:18:19,658
Oh, my God.

1059
01:18:51,905 --> 01:18:54,396
As you can see, Mrs. St. George...

1060
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:58,785
...this account"s been closed out
by your husband.

1061
01:18:58,912 --> 01:19:00,454
How can that be?

1062
01:19:01,456 --> 01:19:05,785
That"s my life savings. How can that be
when l got the passbook right here?

1063
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,000
You see, Mrs. St. George, that is...

1064
01:19:08,296 --> 01:19:11,463
...was what we call
a custodial savings account.

1065
01:19:11,758 --> 01:19:15,590
That means either parent
can countersign and make a withdrawal.

1066
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:19,177
This doesn"t show any withdrawals.

1067
01:19:19,682 --> 01:19:22,387
How"d he get the money
without the goddamn passbook?

1068
01:19:22,602 --> 01:19:24,262
Mrs. St. George...

1069
01:19:24,478 --> 01:19:27,148
...if l could ask you
to keep your voice down.

1070
01:19:28,983 --> 01:19:32,981
According to this, your husband stated,
"Passbook was lost."

1071
01:19:34,322 --> 01:19:36,361
He asked to be issued a new one.

1072
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:37,866
It"s common enough.

1073
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:40,619
Common be damned.
I opened this account!

1074
01:19:40,786 --> 01:19:43,573
Who do you think put the money
in the bank to begin with?

1075
01:19:43,664 --> 01:19:45,704
Please, Mrs. St. George.

1076
01:19:46,417 --> 01:19:49,620
I"m sorry, but l assure you
what we did was not only legal...

1077
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,794
...but standard bank practice.

1078
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,920
Maybe it"s legal and maybe it ain"t.

1079
01:19:54,008 --> 01:19:56,962
I can"t believe standard practice
means you don"t make...

1080
01:19:57,052 --> 01:19:59,450
...one single goddamn phone call...

1081
01:19:59,138 --> 01:20:01,545
...to the person whose name
is on the account.

1082
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,265
I"m very sorry--

1083
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:07,846
Say you"re sorry again, l"ll kick your butt
till you look like a hunchback.

1084
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:11,938
Lydia.

1085
01:20:22,369 --> 01:20:24,527
It"s "cause l"m a woman, ain"t it?

1086
01:20:26,873 --> 01:20:30,953
If l"d been the one passing off a fairy story
how l"d lost the passbook...

1087
01:20:31,044 --> 01:20:32,622
...and asked for a new one....

1088
01:20:32,712 --> 01:20:36,840
If l"d been the one who started drawing out
what took 1 1 years to put in...

1089
01:20:37,509 --> 01:20:39,382
...you would have called Joe.

1090
01:20:47,018 --> 01:20:48,490
Well....

1091
01:20:49,395 --> 01:20:51,187
I suppose it"s one of two things.

1092
01:20:51,272 --> 01:20:54,475
Either he"s buried it in a mason jar
in the backyard, or else...

1093
01:20:55,568 --> 01:20:57,477
...he opened up a new account.

1094
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:04,690
Mr. Pease....

1095
01:21:06,412 --> 01:21:09,698
You don"t have to tell me,
but l hope you"ll think for a moment...

1096
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:14,251
...about the grief and heartache you could
have saved me by making just one call.

1097
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:21,301
I"m asking you to please tell me
whether he"s opened a new account here...

1098
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:24,673
...or if l"ve gotta start digging holes
around my house.

1099
01:21:31,103 --> 01:21:35,315
As soon as the luncheon silver is clean,
l want the guest rooms aired out.

1100
01:21:35,774 --> 01:21:40,104
I"ll want to go over the linens
for the daybeds in the study...

1101
01:21:40,571 --> 01:21:41,650
...and the sun room.

1102
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:44,693
No, Joy, l don"t like those colors together.
Change them.

1103
01:21:44,783 --> 01:21:47,950
Dolores, did you check on the flowers?

1104
01:21:48,412 --> 01:21:51,615
Must you look so trod-upon, Dolores?

1105
01:21:51,748 --> 01:21:55,616
In 36 hours you will have
the uniquely thrilling experience...

1106
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:58,581
...of standing at the epicenter
of a total solar eclipse.

1107
01:21:58,964 --> 01:22:03,127
I"ve got guests traveling 800 miles
for something all you need to do is look....

1108
01:22:13,311 --> 01:22:14,971
Did you see Dolores?

1109
01:22:17,107 --> 01:22:22,101
As soon as the caterers arrive, l want you
to make sure they have everything needed.

1110
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,731
I"ve made a list.

1111
01:22:23,989 --> 01:22:27,404
I want no last-minute frantic runs
to Jonesport.

1112
01:22:28,368 --> 01:22:29,992
Do you hear me?

1113
01:22:34,999 --> 01:22:37,122
Would you put on some tea?

1114
01:22:49,347 --> 01:22:53,641
-Are we quite finished?
-I"m sorry, Mrs. Donovan. I truly am.

1115
01:22:53,726 --> 01:22:54,889
"Vera."

1116
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:00,397
I insist all women who have hysterics
in my drawing room...

1117
01:23:00,483 --> 01:23:02,310
...call me by my Christian name.

1118
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:09,235
So, enlighten me, Dolores.

1119
01:23:10,826 --> 01:23:15,535
What turns a stone-hard woman like you
into the blubbering mess l see before me?

1120
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:21,703
Joe stole my money.

1121
01:23:23,255 --> 01:23:25,663
I went to close out my account....

1122
01:23:26,091 --> 01:23:28,298
It was money l"d been saving for Selena.

1123
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:33,425
$3,000. I went to get it out
and it was gone.

1124
01:23:35,392 --> 01:23:37,515
Well, don"t look to me, Dolores.

1125
01:23:37,686 --> 01:23:39,726
All my money"s tied up in cash.

1126
01:23:43,942 --> 01:23:46,314
Planning on playing the stock market,
were you?

1127
01:23:46,403 --> 01:23:47,945
I was going to leave.

1128
01:23:50,073 --> 01:23:54,367
I was going to take Selena away with me
tonight before he gets back.

1129
01:23:58,707 --> 01:23:59,738
Well...

1130
01:24:01,543 --> 01:24:03,370
...isn"t that dramatic.

1131
01:24:04,379 --> 01:24:07,480
And why, exactly, are we running away?

1132
01:24:10,218 --> 01:24:12,450
Well, go on, Dolores.

1133
01:24:12,762 --> 01:24:14,755
Perhaps it"s not as bad as it seems.

1134
01:24:15,181 --> 01:24:17,257
Give it to me. It"s mine!

1135
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:20,600
Oh, my God.

1136
01:24:20,228 --> 01:24:22,849
It"s your father.
He"s been at you, hasn"t he?

1137
01:24:22,939 --> 01:24:24,398
What are you talking about?

1138
01:24:24,482 --> 01:24:26,356
-What"s he done to you?
-Nothing!

1139
01:24:26,442 --> 01:24:28,684
-He"s been touchin" you, hasn"t he?
-No!

1140
01:24:28,778 --> 01:24:30,356
What"s he done to you?

1141
01:24:30,446 --> 01:24:33,198
You"ve gotta tell me the truth.
It"s important.

1142
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:35,984
Leave me alone!

1143
01:24:37,745 --> 01:24:39,740
You bitch!

1144
01:24:39,163 --> 01:24:41,720
You crazy old lying bitch!

1145
01:24:41,999 --> 01:24:44,288
You"re a fucking psychotic.

1146
01:24:44,502 --> 01:24:47,918
-You think l"d make this up?
-This actually comes to you?

1147
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:51,125
-How can you not remember?
-I remember you hitting him!

1148
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,545
That l remember.

1149
01:24:52,635 --> 01:24:56,300
I remember the blood on his face,
the drinking, the fighting, but this?

1150
01:24:56,389 --> 01:25:00,137
-You"re not responsible.
-Mackey"s right. You are dangerous.

1151
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:02,598
-Fuck you!
-You gotta believe me.

1152
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:04,264
No, l don"t.

1153
01:25:20,496 --> 01:25:21,527
Don"t try and stop me.

1154
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:23,320
I"m going to the hotel.

1155
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:25,910
Mrs. Devereaux needs extra help
for the eclipse.

1156
01:25:30,213 --> 01:25:33,665
-I"ll be back in a few days.
-We talked about this.

1157
01:25:33,925 --> 01:25:36,463
I don"t care what we talked about.

1158
01:25:41,933 --> 01:25:45,598
I don"t want to be here when you talk
to Dad about your crazy ideas.

1159
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:47,271
Come back here right now!

1160
01:25:47,355 --> 01:25:48,933
Just leave me alone!

1161
01:27:05,641 --> 01:27:08,179
For 12 hours sleep, you don"t look so good.

1162
01:27:08,852 --> 01:27:11,141
I need to be in Arizona.

1163
01:27:11,605 --> 01:27:14,600
It"s a big story and l need it.

1164
01:27:14,942 --> 01:27:16,270
I know.

1165
01:27:18,946 --> 01:27:20,689
I packed your things.

1166
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:24,279
You had stuff lyin" around.

1167
01:27:25,285 --> 01:27:27,278
Coffee"s on the stove.

1168
01:28:01,487 --> 01:28:02,602
What is it?

1169
01:28:02,822 --> 01:28:06,720
It"s Detective Mackey"s report. Here.

1170
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:07,826
I don"t want it.

1171
01:28:10,997 --> 01:28:13,784
How remarkably brave, Mother.

1172
01:28:16,335 --> 01:28:18,328
I"ll make some calls.

1173
01:28:18,754 --> 01:28:21,921
You"ll have your phone
turned on tomorrow.

1174
01:28:22,216 --> 01:28:23,758
I"ll take the report.

1175
01:28:23,926 --> 01:28:25,717
I"m gonna fax it to a lawyer.

1176
01:28:25,928 --> 01:28:28,633
You can expect a call tomorrow.

1177
01:28:29,098 --> 01:28:31,636
And when you talk
to that lawyer, Mother...

1178
01:28:31,892 --> 01:28:34,264
...you damn well better do what he says.

1179
01:28:34,478 --> 01:28:35,854
You"ll miss your ferry.

1180
01:28:36,438 --> 01:28:37,553
You want to hang yourself?

1181
01:28:37,648 --> 01:28:41,170
Go into that inquest tomorrow
and start shooting your mouth off.

1182
01:28:51,245 --> 01:28:52,988
I"m sorry, Mother.

1183
01:28:56,375 --> 01:29:00,503
"Sometimes being a bitch is the only thing
a woman has to hold onto."

1184
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:41,917
Shit!

1185
01:29:47,925 --> 01:29:51,294
I hope l'm doing this right,
'cause l never worked one before.

1186
01:29:51,554 --> 01:29:54,508
Don't these Japanese make
the cunningest little gadgets?

1187
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,511
You're sleeping now, Selena...

1188
01:29:57,602 --> 01:30:00,271
...but l know when you get up,
you"re gonna leave.

1189
01:30:01,606 --> 01:30:05,570
By the time you hear this,
l figure you"re in Arizona.

1190
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:07,810
By now it"s all been said and done.

1191
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:11,862
You can forget about the lawyer.

1192
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:14,950
I'm gonna go down tomorrow
and talk to those people and...

1193
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:18,448
...l ain't makin' a stink about it no more.

1194
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:22,409
I'm telling you now
what l'm gonna tell them.

1195
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:25,706
Ijust thought you ought to hear it
firsthand, is all.

1196
01:30:25,796 --> 01:30:28,334
How far has he gone, Dolores?

1197
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:32,583
She says it ain"t never happened.

1198
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:37,635
And she screamed and cried
and denied it so bad, l know it"s true.

1199
01:30:38,142 --> 01:30:39,470
I should"ve....

1200
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:44,303
The way she"s been acting around him,
l should"ve known it sooner.

1201
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:45,811
My God.

1202
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:47,815
How far has he gone?

1203
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,570
He wasn"t always like this.

1204
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:55,570
When we started out
it wasn"t a dream come true--

1205
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,153
Has he fucked her?

1206
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:02,992
I don"t know.

1207
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,829
I don"t know.

1208
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:11,839
But if he hasn"t, he"s gonna soon enough.

1209
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:16,468
He"s working the boats.
He"ll be back tomorrow.

1210
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:18,222
That money....

1211
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:24,220
I was gonna use that $3,000 to get us
as far away from here as possible.

1212
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:27,120
And how far is that, Dolores?

1213
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,806
Jonesport? Bangor?

1214
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:34,692
You"ve never been more than 50 miles
away from this island in your life.

1215
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:39,909
How long do you think
it would take him to find you?

1216
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:47,197
It"s a depressingly masculine world
we live in, Dolores.

1217
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,866
Maybe l"m wrong.

1218
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,830
What if you"re right?

1219
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:55,840
Husbands die every day, Dolores.

1220
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:57,208
Why...

1221
01:31:57,386 --> 01:32:01,301
...one is probably dying right now,
while you"re sittin" here weeping.

1222
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:04,350
They die...

1223
01:32:04,518 --> 01:32:07,519
...and leave their wives their money.

1224
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:10,520
I should know, shouldn"t l?

1225
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:15,649
Sometimes they"re driving home
from their mistress"s apartment...

1226
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,402
...and their brakes suddenly fail.

1227
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:21,730
An accident, Dolores...

1228
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:24,745
...can be an unhappy woman"s best friend.

1229
01:33:17,632 --> 01:33:19,957
Don"t you just love the bossa nova?

1230
01:33:20,259 --> 01:33:23,130
I found them in New York.
I just had to have them.

1231
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,430
Hi, how are you?

1232
01:33:26,641 --> 01:33:30,223
There"s a buzzer going off in the kitchen.
You"d better check it.

1233
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,813
I"m sorry, Mrs. Donovan.
We"re going as fast as we can.

1234
01:33:35,983 --> 01:33:37,561
Oh, please.

1235
01:33:37,652 --> 01:33:39,940
Everything"s charming.

1236
01:33:41,322 --> 01:33:43,279
They"re callin" for rain.

1237
01:33:43,366 --> 01:33:44,694
Oh, don"t worry.

1238
01:33:44,867 --> 01:33:46,943
I"ll have my eclipse.

1239
01:33:48,496 --> 01:33:50,535
I"m sending you home, Dolores.

1240
01:33:50,873 --> 01:33:54,491
You"ve done a wonderful job
and it"s all under control.

1241
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:59,400
I want you to go and share this remarkable
experience with your husband.

1242
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,667
He will be back, won"t he?

1243
01:34:04,219 --> 01:34:05,678
I suppose so.

1244
01:34:08,057 --> 01:34:11,508
I"ve got you two eclipse viewers
and two reflector boxes.

1245
01:34:11,894 --> 01:34:14,515
I thought you and Joe might like them.

1246
01:34:17,482 --> 01:34:18,645
I can"t.

1247
01:34:20,235 --> 01:34:22,270
Sometimes, Dolores...

1248
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:27,320
...sometimes you have
to be a high-riding bitch...

1249
01:34:27,409 --> 01:34:28,654
...to survive.

1250
01:34:30,328 --> 01:34:31,988
Sometimes...

1251
01:34:32,164 --> 01:34:34,370
...being a bitch...

1252
01:34:34,374 --> 01:34:37,328
...is all a woman has to hang onto.

1253
01:34:49,681 --> 01:34:51,175
Thank you, Vera.

1254
01:34:53,143 --> 01:34:55,384
Now, go on home.

1255
01:34:56,062 --> 01:34:58,220
Pam and Sheila can clean up.

1256
01:34:58,439 --> 01:34:59,720
Remember...

1257
01:34:59,941 --> 01:35:02,230
...eclipse at 5:00.

1258
01:35:20,378 --> 01:35:22,584
I wouldn"t miss this for the world.

1259
01:35:22,755 --> 01:35:25,875
I got some binoculars.
I"m going to find myself a good spot.

1260
01:35:32,932 --> 01:35:34,260
Come on!

1261
01:35:36,852 --> 01:35:37,883
All right!

1262
01:35:44,151 --> 01:35:45,610
Shit!

1263
01:35:48,447 --> 01:35:50,605
You sorry piece of shit.

1264
01:35:53,911 --> 01:35:55,987
What the hell are you doing back?

1265
01:35:57,456 --> 01:35:59,247
Got the afternoon off.

1266
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:01,420
Welcome home to you too.

1267
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:03,914
Don"t start with me, Dolores.

1268
01:36:04,129 --> 01:36:05,623
Where"s Selena?

1269
01:36:07,966 --> 01:36:09,875
She"s working at the hotel.

1270
01:36:11,928 --> 01:36:14,870
Looks like you bought out the whole store.

1271
01:36:14,306 --> 01:36:15,717
What"s all this?

1272
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:18,298
A present to celebrate the eclipse.

1273
01:36:19,186 --> 01:36:20,846
Eclipse, shit.

1274
01:36:21,646 --> 01:36:25,146
I"ve felt so good lately,
l thought l"d share some of my happiness.

1275
01:36:25,233 --> 01:36:27,605
What do you got to feel happy about?

1276
01:36:39,414 --> 01:36:41,122
Well, Jesus Christ.

1277
01:36:41,666 --> 01:36:42,911
You don"t want it?

1278
01:36:43,001 --> 01:36:44,874
I can always pour it down the sink.

1279
01:36:51,301 --> 01:36:55,132
Vera sent us some thingamajigs
to watch the eclipse.

1280
01:36:55,471 --> 01:36:57,298
Yeah, like l give a shit.

1281
01:36:57,724 --> 01:36:59,550
I don"t want to fight with you.

1282
01:37:02,895 --> 01:37:05,137
Let"s just try and enjoy the day.

1283
01:37:05,731 --> 01:37:07,439
That won"t be hard.

1284
01:37:23,332 --> 01:37:25,455
That crowd. Looks like D-Day.

1285
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,789
Look at them.

1286
01:37:28,587 --> 01:37:31,339
The whole goddamn island"s out there.

1287
01:37:37,554 --> 01:37:38,965
I hope it rains.

1288
01:37:39,056 --> 01:37:41,594
Hope it comes down so hard
it drowns them all.

1289
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:51,475
What the hell has gotten into you?

1290
01:37:51,902 --> 01:37:55,900
Ain"t nothing gonna happen any more
than a thunderhead going across the sun.

1291
01:37:56,031 --> 01:37:58,901
Eat up, Joe, before the flies beat you to it.

1292
01:38:51,919 --> 01:38:53,876
Okay, here we go.

1293
01:38:57,466 --> 01:38:58,961
Hey, Dee!

1294
01:38:59,719 --> 01:39:03,930
Isn"t this what all of you and all the rest
of them fools been waiting for?

1295
01:39:04,807 --> 01:39:07,960
Better get your butt out here.

1296
01:39:24,201 --> 01:39:25,197
Goddamn.

1297
01:39:31,834 --> 01:39:34,407
She"s disappearing, all right.

1298
01:39:40,008 --> 01:39:42,131
I got another surprise for you.

1299
01:39:43,303 --> 01:39:46,800
Did somebody invent a pill
that"ll cure ugly?

1300
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:54,892
You know the money
in Selena"s bank account?

1301
01:39:56,858 --> 01:39:59,230
Yeah, well, what about it?

1302
01:39:59,736 --> 01:40:01,361
You took it.

1303
01:40:09,579 --> 01:40:11,488
Don"t you look sour.

1304
01:40:16,252 --> 01:40:18,922
-I guess it is pretty funny, ain"t it?
-Yeah.

1305
01:40:20,173 --> 01:40:23,430
I fooled you right and proper, didn"t l?

1306
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:25,876
You fooled me about a lot of things, Joe...

1307
01:40:26,262 --> 01:40:28,468
...but l guess l finally caught up with you.

1308
01:40:28,556 --> 01:40:30,881
You already spent $500 of it.

1309
01:40:32,018 --> 01:40:33,845
What"d it go for, Joe?

1310
01:40:34,562 --> 01:40:35,558
Poker?

1311
01:40:36,063 --> 01:40:37,392
Beer?

1312
01:40:38,733 --> 01:40:40,856
There you go, selling me short.

1313
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:42,812
It was set aside for school.

1314
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:46,902
You blew all our money, you may as well
run through hers, while you"re at it.

1315
01:40:47,116 --> 01:40:49,689
School, shit.

1316
01:40:53,789 --> 01:40:56,909
You can"t even wipe your ass
for $3,000 these days.

1317
01:40:59,128 --> 01:41:01,879
I spent the day with the people
at the bank.

1318
01:41:02,214 --> 01:41:04,337
It turns out you weren"t supposed
to do that.

1319
01:41:04,425 --> 01:41:05,800
Lie to them.

1320
01:41:05,926 --> 01:41:07,919
Make them break their rules.

1321
01:41:09,096 --> 01:41:10,756
What did you go and do?

1322
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:13,967
I got all that money
given right back to me in cash.

1323
01:41:14,351 --> 01:41:17,103
All but the $500 you pissed away.

1324
01:41:17,312 --> 01:41:19,435
So you can just go and fuck yourself.

1325
01:41:19,606 --> 01:41:22,773
That is if you can get that limp old noodle
of yours to stand up.

1326
01:41:24,778 --> 01:41:28,112
I told you what l"d do
if you didn"t stop being fresh with me!

1327
01:41:28,198 --> 01:41:29,573
Didn"t l?

1328
01:41:30,409 --> 01:41:32,366
You believe me now, do you?

1329
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:34,700
Yes. Yes, Joe!

1330
01:41:46,174 --> 01:41:47,633
Oh, my God.

1331
01:41:51,638 --> 01:41:52,966
Look at that.

1332
01:41:54,349 --> 01:41:55,629
A star.

1333
01:41:59,354 --> 01:42:00,634
A star.

1334
01:42:00,855 --> 01:42:04,639
You"ll see plenty of them if you don"t start
tellin" me where that money is.

1335
01:42:04,984 --> 01:42:06,313
Right now!

1336
01:42:06,986 --> 01:42:08,480
I buried it...

1337
01:42:09,364 --> 01:42:10,644
...in the yard.

1338
01:42:12,116 --> 01:42:13,361
Out by the field.

1339
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:17,111
Let"s just go get it back where it belongs,
why don"t we?

1340
01:42:19,123 --> 01:42:22,623
Believe you me,
there better be every last cent of it.

1341
01:42:23,628 --> 01:42:27,460
You"d better save the big talk
for your pals at the barber shop!

1342
01:42:27,632 --> 01:42:30,390
I wonder if they"ll think
you"re such a stud...

1343
01:42:30,134 --> 01:42:32,755
...when they find out the only ass
you can get...

1344
01:42:32,845 --> 01:42:35,418
...belongs to your 13-year-old daughter!

1345
01:42:37,308 --> 01:42:40,392
-I don"t know what you"re talking about.
-Really?

1346
01:42:40,686 --> 01:42:45,681
Then how come you look like the devil just
grabbed them little raisins you call balls?

1347
01:42:49,361 --> 01:42:51,733
She"s a liar. She"s a little liar.

1348
01:42:52,323 --> 01:42:53,865
And a goddamn tease.

1349
01:42:57,202 --> 01:42:58,910
How could you do it, Joe?

1350
01:43:01,415 --> 01:43:03,704
After everything l did for her...

1351
01:43:04,668 --> 01:43:07,704
...she"s mouthing off like that,
telling lies like....

1352
01:43:08,714 --> 01:43:11,335
When she gets back l"m gonna get my belt.

1353
01:43:13,051 --> 01:43:14,427
I"m gonna get my belt.

1354
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:18,800
The only thing you"re gonna get is
a long stretch in Shawshank Prison...

1355
01:43:19,057 --> 01:43:20,682
...for child molesting!

1356
01:43:20,809 --> 01:43:22,220
Goddamn bitch!

1357
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:30,233
The more you run, the worse it"s gonna be.

1358
01:43:30,443 --> 01:43:31,938
Get off me!

1359
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:43,122
You"re gonna get your payback now, bitch.

1360
01:43:43,289 --> 01:43:45,827
And it"s gonna cost you more than money!

1361
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,376
You"re mine now!

1362
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:04,930
Give me your hand
before l fall all the way in, please!

1363
01:44:04,936 --> 01:44:07,474
Help me before l fall all the way in,
goddamn it!

1364
01:44:08,731 --> 01:44:10,807
You don"t know what you"re doing.

1365
01:44:11,984 --> 01:44:12,980
Where are you going?

1366
01:44:13,069 --> 01:44:16,235
Oh, God, what"re you doing?
Dee, come on!

1367
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:20,270
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

1368
01:44:25,081 --> 01:44:26,409
Please!

1369
01:44:28,292 --> 01:44:29,572
You bitch!

1370
01:44:30,002 --> 01:44:31,876
I swear, you"re gonna die.

1371
01:44:35,341 --> 01:44:36,799
Help, somebody!

1372
01:44:37,134 --> 01:44:38,877
Somebody help me, please.

1373
01:44:39,303 --> 01:44:40,797
Help!

1374
01:44:42,306 --> 01:44:43,765
Help, somebody!

1375
01:44:44,308 --> 01:44:46,514
-Oh, goddamn it!
-Nobody can hear you.

1376
01:44:46,727 --> 01:44:50,807
You bitch! Oh, you just better hope
l don"t get out.

1377
01:45:23,972 --> 01:45:26,973
The eclipse lasted six and a half minutes.

1378
01:45:27,392 --> 01:45:30,130
They said it was some kind of record.

1379
01:45:30,979 --> 01:45:34,395
It was a lot more than a thunderhead
passing across the sun.

1380
01:45:35,817 --> 01:45:37,644
It was beautiful.

1381
01:45:44,409 --> 01:45:46,690
I burned the dress...

1382
01:45:46,577 --> 01:45:49,282
...and l dropped the whiskey bottle
out near the well.

1383
01:45:49,706 --> 01:45:54,830
I started askin' folks if they'd seen Joe
off on a bender somewhere.

1384
01:45:54,418 --> 01:45:56,874
Besides Mackey showing up
and making trouble...

1385
01:45:56,963 --> 01:45:59,454
...it was easier than l thought.

1386
01:46:06,347 --> 01:46:07,924
That's what happened...

1387
01:46:08,015 --> 01:46:09,391
...plain and true.

1388
01:46:09,475 --> 01:46:12,960
And l don't care no more who knows it.

1389
01:46:12,937 --> 01:46:15,179
I guess all l do care about...

1390
01:46:16,065 --> 01:46:18,188
...all l ever cared about...

1391
01:46:18,442 --> 01:46:20,731
...is that you're safe and sound.

1392
01:46:22,529 --> 01:46:23,905
I lied to you.

1393
01:46:26,116 --> 01:46:28,260
And l lied to myself.

1394
01:46:29,078 --> 01:46:31,236
Now it's time to pay the piper.

1395
01:47:23,464 --> 01:47:24,793
Here we go.

1396
01:47:25,884 --> 01:47:27,757
One coffee, $1.

1397
01:47:29,304 --> 01:47:31,261
Out of $5.

1398
01:47:36,644 --> 01:47:41,140
Okay, one coffee, one hot cocoa,
that'll be 60 cents.

1399
01:47:42,191 --> 01:47:44,433
McCrea, it ain't worth half that.

1400
01:47:46,529 --> 01:47:47,940
There you go.

1401
01:48:27,194 --> 01:48:30,278
You look cold enough
to climb inside a clam shell.

1402
01:48:31,865 --> 01:48:33,656
Here, this"ll warm you up.

1403
01:48:40,749 --> 01:48:42,457
What"s wrong, you don"t want it?

1404
01:48:42,542 --> 01:48:44,167
It's hot chocolate for you.

1405
01:48:44,252 --> 01:48:47,390
Come on, let"s take the top off.

1406
01:48:48,048 --> 01:48:50,171
You got that little thing l give you?

1407
01:48:50,467 --> 01:48:52,127
Ket's have a look at it.

1408
01:48:53,053 --> 01:48:55,378
You know, this is very special, Selena.

1409
01:48:56,556 --> 01:48:58,845
My mother got it from her mother.

1410
01:48:59,017 --> 01:49:01,424
You know, l"m not gonna give it
just to anybody.

1411
01:49:01,519 --> 01:49:04,570
It"s very special for you, okay, sweetheart?

1412
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:06,550
Here.

1413
01:49:06,232 --> 01:49:07,395
Take that.

1414
01:49:07,567 --> 01:49:09,725
It"s a very special thing for you.

1415
01:49:11,112 --> 01:49:12,227
Your hands cold?

1416
01:49:12,322 --> 01:49:14,300
I"m okay.

1417
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:18,700
-Here, give me your hands.
-I"m fine.

1418
01:49:20,246 --> 01:49:22,120
Nobody"s gonna see us, sweetheart.

1419
01:49:22,457 --> 01:49:24,248
Here. Come on. Give me your hands.

1420
01:49:24,333 --> 01:49:26,770
My cocoa will spill.

1421
01:49:26,294 --> 01:49:27,788
Oh, gosh.

1422
01:49:29,297 --> 01:49:31,880
I"ll buy you another one.

1423
01:49:31,424 --> 01:49:33,962
-Come on, let me dry your hands.
-All right.

1424
01:49:34,552 --> 01:49:36,877
Oh, gosh. Your hand"s cold.

1425
01:49:38,306 --> 01:49:39,586
I can"t.

1426
01:49:39,765 --> 01:49:40,928
I can"t.

1427
01:49:48,816 --> 01:49:50,524
No, Daddy, please.

1428
01:49:59,368 --> 01:50:02,370
Come on, now. You know how to do it.
I showed you.

1429
01:50:02,121 --> 01:50:05,287
Remember how l showed you?
Nobody"s gonna see us.

1430
01:50:07,292 --> 01:50:08,455
Come on, baby.

1431
01:50:08,544 --> 01:50:09,824
You remember?

1432
01:50:15,342 --> 01:50:17,548
You remember how l showed you?

1433
01:50:20,263 --> 01:50:21,343
Please.

1434
01:50:21,974 --> 01:50:23,136
Come on.

1435
01:50:24,601 --> 01:50:26,950
Come on, that"s it.

1436
01:50:26,228 --> 01:50:27,936
Oh, that's it.

1437
01:50:28,105 --> 01:50:29,978
You're my good girl.

1438
01:50:30,482 --> 01:50:32,273
I love you, Selena.

1439
01:50:33,068 --> 01:50:34,645
You"re my good girl.

1440
01:50:38,323 --> 01:50:40,316
You want your change or what?

1441
01:50:45,705 --> 01:50:47,864
No. You keep it.

1442
01:51:21,866 --> 01:51:24,191
I was gonna kill her, Your Honor.

1443
01:51:24,952 --> 01:51:26,494
She tried to do it herself...

1444
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:28,536
...but she was still alive.

1445
01:51:28,831 --> 01:51:31,536
She begged me to finish what she started.

1446
01:51:33,252 --> 01:51:35,494
I didn"t know if l could do it or not.

1447
01:51:36,046 --> 01:51:39,213
By the time l got back from the kitchen
she was dead.

1448
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:41,792
Just your good luck, l guess.

1449
01:51:44,179 --> 01:51:46,967
They tell me you"ve waived your right
to council.

1450
01:51:47,266 --> 01:51:48,380
Yes, sir.

1451
01:51:48,934 --> 01:51:52,268
I tell you, l"ve married people
who"ve brought lawyers with them.

1452
01:51:53,355 --> 01:51:55,229
Let"s just get this over with.

1453
01:51:57,276 --> 01:51:59,564
Before l sign Detective Mackey"s report...

1454
01:51:59,695 --> 01:52:02,898
...there are a few things
l"d like him to clarify for me.

1455
01:52:03,282 --> 01:52:04,692
Ms. Claiborne...

1456
01:52:04,908 --> 01:52:06,486
...l have several witnesses...

1457
01:52:06,576 --> 01:52:11,369
...who say they were present when
you threatened the life of Vera Donovan.

1458
01:52:12,916 --> 01:52:14,410
Now that"s true, is it not?

1459
01:52:14,543 --> 01:52:17,994
Why don"t you just go ahead and ask me
what you really want to know?

1460
01:52:18,088 --> 01:52:20,793
In due time, Ms. Claiborne. In due time.

1461
01:52:21,716 --> 01:52:24,753
-Is it true you made those threats?
-Of course, it"s true.

1462
01:52:25,053 --> 01:52:26,962
She told you herself on Saturday.

1463
01:52:27,138 --> 01:52:29,345
I"m sorry. This is a closed hearing.

1464
01:52:30,975 --> 01:52:35,200
The woman sitting over there, the one
without a lawyer, that"s my mother.

1465
01:52:35,105 --> 01:52:38,473
This isn"t a trial.
I have every right to be here with her.

1466
01:52:39,984 --> 01:52:41,443
Selena St. George.

1467
01:52:41,569 --> 01:52:44,855
Don"t stop. Let"s just wrap this up
and get back to the mainland.

1468
01:52:44,989 --> 01:52:48,260
This report is incomplete.
Maybe before you sign off on this--

1469
01:52:48,117 --> 01:52:51,237
We"re in the middle of a questioning here,
Miss St. George.

1470
01:52:51,663 --> 01:52:53,785
My mother did not kill Vera Donovan.

1471
01:52:54,082 --> 01:52:57,166
That"s funny. I"ve got 30 pages here
that say she did.

1472
01:52:57,251 --> 01:52:59,244
This thing is totally circumstantial.

1473
01:52:59,629 --> 01:53:02,962
I"ve covered enough courtrooms
to know he"s got no hard evidence.

1474
01:53:03,049 --> 01:53:06,299
Circumstantial? Samuel Marchant, page 6!

1475
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:09,870
Tell him what"s not in the report.

1476
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:12,465
You"ve had the whole weekend
to get yourself a lawyer.

1477
01:53:12,683 --> 01:53:15,257
What is it that"s not in the report?

1478
01:53:17,605 --> 01:53:19,847
These two women loved each other.

1479
01:53:23,110 --> 01:53:24,604
Oh, really?

1480
01:53:26,155 --> 01:53:28,942
Now that"s something we"d like to hear.

1481
01:53:29,992 --> 01:53:31,451
That"s something...

1482
01:53:31,535 --> 01:53:34,406
...we definitely missed
in our investigation...

1483
01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:36,205
...isn"t it, Frank?

1484
01:53:38,584 --> 01:53:42,118
Why don"t you tell us
about this great mutual affection?

1485
01:53:43,881 --> 01:53:45,707
Your personal observations.

1486
01:53:47,009 --> 01:53:49,416
How"d they get along when you"d visit?

1487
01:53:50,053 --> 01:53:52,509
Christmas, birthdays, holidays...

1488
01:53:53,181 --> 01:53:57,130
...whenever you could tear yourself away
from your judicial reportage.

1489
01:53:58,729 --> 01:54:01,540
Why don"t you tell us, Miss St. George?

1490
01:54:02,566 --> 01:54:05,187
When was your last visit?

1491
01:54:09,072 --> 01:54:10,151
Miss?

1492
01:54:13,493 --> 01:54:15,118
Fifteen years ago.

1493
01:54:18,832 --> 01:54:21,157
You must have some memory.

1494
01:54:22,710 --> 01:54:25,415
These women were together for 22 years.

1495
01:54:25,797 --> 01:54:28,204
My mother spent the last 10 caring
for Vera...

1496
01:54:28,299 --> 01:54:31,134
...24 hours a day, 365 days a year...

1497
01:54:31,636 --> 01:54:33,950
...for $80 a week.

1498
01:54:33,263 --> 01:54:35,136
You should quit while you"re ahead.

1499
01:54:35,223 --> 01:54:37,512
He says they hated each other.

1500
01:54:37,767 --> 01:54:41,385
I want to know if you hated each other
so much why you stayed together?

1501
01:54:42,188 --> 01:54:43,812
There were other jobs...

1502
01:54:44,065 --> 01:54:45,227
...better jobs.

1503
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,393
Why go through 20 years of hell?

1504
01:54:49,529 --> 01:54:51,984
-Why, Mother?
-Please, Miss. This is embarrassing.

1505
01:54:52,073 --> 01:54:54,646
You"re supposed to be a professional,
aren"t you?

1506
01:54:54,951 --> 01:54:56,658
We know l never visited.

1507
01:54:57,453 --> 01:54:58,828
Who did?

1508
01:54:58,913 --> 01:55:02,790
In the past few years,
who else has been in that house?

1509
01:55:03,542 --> 01:55:05,202
Doc Collin came once a month.

1510
01:55:05,294 --> 01:55:07,334
Let"s not forget Sammy Marchant.

1511
01:55:08,714 --> 01:55:11,798
Nobody else gave a damn
whether they lived or died.

1512
01:55:12,301 --> 01:55:14,258
All they had was each other.

1513
01:55:14,887 --> 01:55:16,879
That"s why you stayed together.

1514
01:55:17,723 --> 01:55:20,344
I mean, is that what you do
when you hate someone?

1515
01:55:20,434 --> 01:55:22,723
You trade off your life for...

1516
01:55:23,645 --> 01:55:26,350
...what, 20 cents an hour
just to keep them going?

1517
01:55:26,607 --> 01:55:28,848
Please, all this is very touching.

1518
01:55:29,943 --> 01:55:33,277
But $1,600,000...

1519
01:55:34,323 --> 01:55:36,481
...is a little more than 20 cents an hour.

1520
01:55:36,575 --> 01:55:38,781
My mother never knew about the will.

1521
01:55:39,494 --> 01:55:42,329
Come on, Miss St. George.

1522
01:55:42,497 --> 01:55:45,582
The will is eight years old.

1523
01:55:45,959 --> 01:55:47,287
You were there, Frank.

1524
01:55:47,419 --> 01:55:49,874
When Mackey told her about the will.

1525
01:55:49,963 --> 01:55:51,420
You think she knew?

1526
01:55:51,131 --> 01:55:52,506
He is not on trial.

1527
01:55:52,591 --> 01:55:54,464
Neither is my mother.

1528
01:55:54,885 --> 01:55:56,462
Constable?

1529
01:56:03,643 --> 01:56:06,430
She seemed pretty surprised, l guess...

1530
01:56:07,147 --> 01:56:08,475
...to me.

1531
01:56:12,402 --> 01:56:13,600
That"s how l saw it.

1532
01:56:17,907 --> 01:56:20,445
You want us to believe
that they were best friends...

1533
01:56:20,535 --> 01:56:24,402
...and alone for eight years
and they never even talked about it?

1534
01:56:24,998 --> 01:56:28,331
I think people can keep secrets
a lot longer than eight years.

1535
01:56:28,501 --> 01:56:31,786
A $1,600,000 secret?

1536
01:56:31,879 --> 01:56:33,160
Come on!

1537
01:56:34,841 --> 01:56:37,414
Did you know about the will,
Ms. Claiborne?

1538
01:56:39,178 --> 01:56:40,637
No, sir.

1539
01:56:41,806 --> 01:56:46,135
Vera made it pretty clear she was plannin"
on takin" it all with her when she went.

1540
01:56:46,394 --> 01:56:49,976
I figured when she died there"d be
some laundry and a fare-thee-well.

1541
01:56:50,064 --> 01:56:51,724
Isn"t that convenient?

1542
01:56:51,816 --> 01:56:53,476
You don"t believe her?

1543
01:56:54,068 --> 01:56:56,191
Then l tell you what, Detective.

1544
01:56:56,278 --> 01:56:59,813
We may be in the presence
of a truly gifted criminal mind.

1545
01:56:59,907 --> 01:57:02,528
For eight years she"s a heartbeat away...

1546
01:57:02,618 --> 01:57:05,250
...from being the richest woman
on the island.

1547
01:57:05,412 --> 01:57:06,693
So what does she do?

1548
01:57:07,081 --> 01:57:09,750
Does she wait one year
and let Vera drown in the tub?

1549
01:57:10,209 --> 01:57:11,833
Three years starving her?

1550
01:57:11,919 --> 01:57:13,496
You"re digging in deeper.

1551
01:57:13,587 --> 01:57:15,330
Smother her in her sleep?

1552
01:57:15,714 --> 01:57:16,995
Drug her?

1553
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:22,168
My mother"s plan is far more brilliant
than that.

1554
01:57:22,763 --> 01:57:28,530
She waits through eight years of bed pans,
sponge baths, diapers and bed sores.

1555
01:57:28,518 --> 01:57:32,180
She waits eight years until Vera"s
already got one foot in the grave.

1556
01:57:32,105 --> 01:57:33,350
Then what does she do?

1557
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,646
-We know.
-That"s your theory, isn"t it?

1558
01:57:35,734 --> 01:57:38,189
She waited eight years
to throw her down the stairs.

1559
01:57:38,278 --> 01:57:40,317
Yes. To make it look like an accident.

1560
01:57:40,405 --> 01:57:44,106
An accident? She ransacked the kitchen
for a rolling pin.

1561
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:45,196
Calm down!

1562
01:57:45,285 --> 01:57:48,155
How will beating Vera to death
look like an accident?

1563
01:57:48,246 --> 01:57:50,784
She panicked, just as you"re doing now.

1564
01:57:57,380 --> 01:58:00,100
Sammy Marchant brought the mail
every day at noon.

1565
01:58:00,091 --> 01:58:01,834
-Why not wait?
-She panicked.

1566
01:58:01,926 --> 01:58:04,631
-She knew she had to finish--
-How do you know?

1567
01:58:04,721 --> 01:58:06,298
Fourteen years" experience.

1568
01:58:06,389 --> 01:58:08,547
-You"ve never been wrong.
-Not when it counted.

1569
01:58:08,641 --> 01:58:12,473
-That"s right, you"re 85 for 86, aren"t you?
-Yes, l am.

1570
01:58:12,645 --> 01:58:15,979
-One case away from a perfect record.
-This report is the truth.

1571
01:58:16,065 --> 01:58:19,683
Truth? Bullshit! Why don"t you tell him
why we"re really here?

1572
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:28,991
Go on.

1573
01:58:31,372 --> 01:58:32,747
Tell him.

1574
01:58:40,297 --> 01:58:42,890
Because she"s done it before.

1575
01:58:42,466 --> 01:58:45,835
Wait a minute.
Is there some prior felony here, John?

1576
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,886
No, there"s not.

1577
01:58:52,977 --> 01:58:55,990
They wouldn"t indict her.

1578
01:59:03,529 --> 01:59:05,189
Eighteen years ago...

1579
01:59:06,865 --> 01:59:08,573
...my father drank some scotch...

1580
01:59:08,659 --> 01:59:10,201
...and fell down a well.

1581
01:59:11,203 --> 01:59:14,239
Detective Mackey didn"t think
it was an accident, which is...

1582
01:59:14,790 --> 01:59:16,616
...why we"re here today.

1583
01:59:18,710 --> 01:59:20,750
What do you think, Selena?

1584
01:59:24,341 --> 01:59:26,499
I think that l owe you an apology.

1585
01:59:29,721 --> 01:59:31,797
I called you a son of a bitch.

1586
01:59:33,516 --> 01:59:35,924
You said you thought we were a lot alike.

1587
01:59:36,144 --> 01:59:37,555
And you were right.

1588
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:42,640
We"ve both spent the past 18 years
prosecuting this woman.

1589
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:44,937
We came out here...

1590
01:59:45,528 --> 01:59:47,320
...l know l did...

1591
01:59:47,614 --> 01:59:49,737
...believing she was guilty.

1592
01:59:50,366 --> 01:59:53,486
We forgot this case is
about Vera Donovan...

1593
01:59:54,037 --> 01:59:55,365
...not my father.

1594
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:58,367
And what if it wasn"t an accident?

1595
01:59:59,208 --> 02:00:00,489
Look...

1596
02:00:03,421 --> 02:00:06,256
...it"s been 18 years.

1597
02:00:07,675 --> 02:00:10,344
I don"t know what this has done to you...

1598
02:00:11,512 --> 02:00:13,968
...but let me tell you, it"s consumed me.

1599
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:18,934
I have lived with this every day of my life.

1600
02:00:20,855 --> 02:00:22,397
Every day.

1601
02:00:26,902 --> 02:00:28,231
But it was wrong...

1602
02:00:28,654 --> 02:00:30,943
...and l won"t do it anymore.

1603
02:00:33,534 --> 02:00:36,720
And if l can say that, my God...

1604
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:38,365
...can"t you?

1605
02:00:44,878 --> 02:00:46,670
She didn"t kill Vera Donovan.

1606
02:00:47,256 --> 02:00:49,925
You"ve been out here looking
for a smoking gun.

1607
02:00:50,175 --> 02:00:51,586
There isn"t one.

1608
02:00:51,802 --> 02:00:55,634
All you"ve got is a 30-page description
of a suicide.

1609
02:00:55,847 --> 02:00:57,425
I"m asking you...

1610
02:00:57,808 --> 02:00:59,266
...as an honorable man...

1611
02:01:02,062 --> 02:01:03,936
...with all of your experience...

1612
02:01:04,856 --> 02:01:06,267
...all that you"ve seen...

1613
02:01:07,776 --> 02:01:09,353
...would we be here now...

1614
02:01:09,444 --> 02:01:12,813
...if this was anyone other
than Dolores Claiborne?

1615
02:01:14,783 --> 02:01:17,710
This report"s the truth!

1616
02:01:42,226 --> 02:01:46,972
I"d like you to know that if you go
to trial with this, you"ll fail again.

1617
02:01:47,982 --> 02:01:51,102
You"d better ask yourself
how you want to finish your career.

1618
02:01:51,652 --> 02:01:53,941
I"ve got a long list of New York lawyers...

1619
02:01:54,030 --> 02:01:58,608
...who"d just love to take you
and this case apart in front of a jury.

1620
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:05,154
Mother....

1621
02:02:05,291 --> 02:02:07,340
Come on, let"s go.

1622
02:02:07,376 --> 02:02:09,168
They can"t hurt you anymore.

1623
02:02:12,590 --> 02:02:13,870
John?

1624
02:02:14,091 --> 02:02:15,633
This is your ball game.

1625
02:02:16,510 --> 02:02:18,882
I"m gonna leave this up to you.

1626
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:27,478
Come on.

1627
02:02:28,313 --> 02:02:29,642
It"s time.

1628
02:03:31,209 --> 02:03:33,415
Even when it"s warm here, it"s cold.

1629
02:03:36,422 --> 02:03:38,878
It won"t be like that in Arizona.

1630
02:03:46,098 --> 02:03:47,593
There is no Arizona.

1631
02:03:50,895 --> 02:03:52,638
I don"t have to go.

1632
02:03:53,314 --> 02:03:54,974
It was a lie.

1633
02:03:57,735 --> 02:03:59,395
My editor...

1634
02:04:00,279 --> 02:04:02,402
...the story, the book...

1635
02:04:02,573 --> 02:04:03,948
...it"s all over.

1636
02:04:09,788 --> 02:04:12,410
Do l still have to worry about you?

1637
02:04:18,630 --> 02:04:21,860
I don"t know how to feel
about what you did.

1638
02:04:22,593 --> 02:04:23,968
Maybe l never will.

1639
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:32,558
But l know you did it for me.

1640
02:04:48,285 --> 02:04:50,740
I don"t want to lose you again.

1641
02:04:53,331 --> 02:04:54,825
Go on.

1642
02:04:55,041 --> 02:04:57,340
You"re not gonna lose me.

1643
02:04:59,587 --> 02:05:01,212
You go on.

1644
