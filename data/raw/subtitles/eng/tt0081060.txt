No wonder,
suffocating them.

You look familiar.
- You've seen me on TV.

49
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:36,221
In some stupid ad?

50
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:39,861
I'm a dancer in an advertisement

51
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,701
This is it!

Move your ass.
- Bullies.

53
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:56,246
I know a girl,

Yes, Ferris, where you

None of your business.

You probably have no idea.
- I know enough.

57
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:14,410
You made it to the fourth base?
- I have 15 years. No one in the team

00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:16,349
years does not go that far.

What are you? - I think the guys
badass.

62
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:40,677

Ferris probably not gay.
Only immature.

71
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:11,091

had a chance.

72

87
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,649
Listen, I do not like to share with you
space.

88

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,371
I know a girl who are
grew a mustache because she ate meat.

We really need to help
Ferris about its problems.

99
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:38,162
You're a lost case.

What should I do?

107
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:19,644
Just let nature

108
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:24,059
Cinder, sorry,
I do not get this.

109

A little magic. You'll be sexy.

Come on.

125
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:26,520

How are you?

132
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,267
Mr. Callahan.

133
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:17,288
Are you married?

134
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,509
No, I'm not married.

135
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,377
No. Why? Are you?
- I'm not married.

136
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:33,848
What is your occupation?

137

I teach French in high school
Roosevelt.

138
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:40,792

140
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,223

Is Roosevelt

144
00:18:56,814 --> 00:18:59,061
You have to go to private school
?

145
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,111
Worse. Dad insists
to be only for girls.

146
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:05,064
God, and I'm not interested
girls, if you get it.

147
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:07,036
Yes, I get it.

148
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:12,295
Mr. Callahan.

149
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,442
Can I ask you something personally
?

150
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:16,192
Yes.

151
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:23,394
What's your sign?
- You want to ask me?

152
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,709
Yes. - You said you want to ask me
something personal.

153
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:27,208
I did personally.

154
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,059
I'm the lion.

155
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:39,256
I thought so. - Why,
it has something to do?

156
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,636
Yes, there is.
- Hey, Ferris, Endžel progresses.

00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:53,817
Something to do with science.
Experiment.

00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:56,228
Biology.

160
00:19:57,351 --> 00:20:01,846
Not concern me, are not you?
- Yes.

161
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,419
OK.

162
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:12,925
You have beautiful eyes, Mr. Callahan.

163
00:20:43,313 --> 00:20:45,204
Do you often you do
climbing?

164
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,733
Yes, the roofs of buildings,
fire escape, and so forth.

165
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:58,661
I do not see anything.
- Look across the water. - I'm watching!

166
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:06,155
What is it?
- I do not want to talk about it.

167
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:08,401
Man!

168
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:16,265
What formations.
What kind of enjoyment.

169
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:21,338
You should see what I see.
Do you see what I see?

170
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:23,515
Why now melt?

171
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:27,724
As the meat with the lions.

172
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,439
Do not you know anything?
- I know one thing.

173
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:34,720
Watching a crowd of naked boys
that Brek might come you

174
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:36,781
but to me it's bullshit.

175
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,959
From watching
can not be pregnant.

176
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,938
God, I hope not.

177
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:46,159
Hey, what will that do for protection?
- Protection?

178
00:21:46,193 --> 00:21:49,521
Protection from pregnancy.
- God will take care of it.

179
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:52,883
Nonsense. The Pill.
- She will not need anything,

180
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:55,790
because nothing will not do it.
- Yeah, right, you will be

181
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:57,050
fear and you watch.

182
00:21:58,006 --> 00:21:59,538
Hey, this is serious.

183
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:13,632
<i> Jesus is our good friend,
carries all our sins and grief .. </i>

184
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,336
Come on.

185
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:24,036

00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,945
Shut up! Hurry up.
- Come on!

192
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:58,221
I'm going to the window.

193
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:04,362
Come on, Endžel!
- Come on!

194
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:06,991
Come on, Endžel!

00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:15,273
I knew you were going to succeed,
I knew.

196
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,930
Hey, Endžel, take it easy!

197
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:53,941
I advise you to choose
experienced man.

198
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,933
I want.
- Good.

199
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:58,604
Already did.

200
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:01,727
What?

201
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,039
Gary.

202
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:08,722
What Gari?

203
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,390
Callahan.

204
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,405
Coach?
- Shh!

205
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:17,588
Gary?

206
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:22,922
.. He is so old.
- He's perfect.

207
00:24:22,957 --> 00:24:26,881
I can not imagine
I have a relationship with him.

208
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:31,355
Do you have to say it so it sounds awful
? God!

209
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,686
Hey, Endžel. I just heard them
.

210
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:39,686
Ferris already has its own target,
so you better hurry.

211
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:41,887
I bet in his entire summer
spending money on you, remember that.

212
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:44,750
Do not bother me, pobediæu.
Pobediæu. - Good.

213
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:50,596
But remember, guys &
reach their sexual peak at 17 years.

214
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,426
From then onwards.

215
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:54,483
Downhill.

216
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:59,393
You'll have to meet me
the Horny èetrnaestogodišnjaka.

217
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:01,732
If you do not mind
I'm going to choose.

218
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:04,605
Good.

219
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:28,823
<i> Men's toilet </i>

220
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:34,723
I wonder if you miss
imprisonment.

221
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,442
Probably lacks
your boobs.

222
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,903
One day Endžel, perhaps
and you become a sex object.

223
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,308
A above?

224
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,855

00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:19,448
Hi, Penelope.
Can people tell us they have done little favor?

227
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:22,954
I can not! I'm afraid of heights!
- Oh, yes, you want!

228
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,223
I'm here.
- Come on!

229
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:32,452

232
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:51,484
God ..

233
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:55,519
Let's get out of here.
- We can not leave Penelope.

234
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:06,217
Hi, girls.

Do you live here?
- I? - Yes, you.

238
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:33,380
I know where I live.
- I'm from Temkamola, across the lake.

239
00:27:52,724 --> 00:27:54,965
Where did you get the car?

240
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,824
Auto? I borrowed it.
- A girl?

241
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:03,051
She ran with the wagon.

242
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:08,686
Shit!

243
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:14,320
What is your name?
- I? - Yes, you.

244
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:16,540
I know what my name is.

00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:20,489
How?
- Endžel.

246
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:23,864
But do not let the name fool you
.

247
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,199
You can not fool me.

248
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:31,233
're Drunk.
- You're cute.

249
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:36,257
Yet we still have not said how

00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,585
Randy.

251
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,660
Do not let the name fool you.

252
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:53,288
Lord, what if she did.

253
00:28:56,606 --> 00:28:59,022
What is called come prepared.

254
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:02,921

Why did you take it?

256
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,451
We're going.

Let's go!

268
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,260
Hey, wait!

269
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:34,748
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
,

270
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:41,768
and the republic for which it represents.
One nation before God, undivided

271
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:44,298
with liberty and justice for all.

272
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,978
Can someone pass me the salt.

273
00:30:50,012 --> 00:30:53,477
Well, well, Angie reincarnated.

274
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:58,729
Oh, I'm sorry.

275
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,978
I have to take this.

276
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:09,776
Oh, terrible. Let me
Clean.

277
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,676
's Okay. It was an accident.
It was an accident? - Yes.

278
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:25,039
See.

279
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,118
It's funny.

280
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:35,433
Yes ..

281
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,862
Come on!
- It's really cool.

282
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:57,295
Purple. My favorite color.
I hope it will be removed.

283
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:01,489
Do not!
- How about ..

284
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:02,907

285
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:06,369
Hey, stop ..

Stop!

288
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:27,409
I think you need a little
sugar.

289
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,811
See I have two!

290
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:28,851
Can you tell me that
the consequences of sex.

291
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:33,212
You sound as if it were a disease.

292
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:36,002
In a way it is.

293
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:39,114
I used a lot of thinking about
kissing.

294
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:45,510
For me it was perfect.
You know, the kiss was somehow peak.

295
00:33:46,213 --> 00:33:47,580
Now ..

296
00:33:48,884 --> 00:33:52,287
Let's say it happens. Whether
I be different?

297
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,354
Well, yes.

298
00:33:56,486 --> 00:34:00,763
In fact, it depends on what kind of connection you
.

299
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:06,194
This is really hard.
- I know.

300
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,619
Yes, I see.

301
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:18,472
If you did not .. You're now in a relationship?
- No.

302
00:34:18,507 --> 00:34:22,903
We're talking about the future?
- Yes, tomorrow or the day after.

303
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:29,121
Just do not do it until
fall in love.

304
00:34:29,155 --> 00:34:32,478
So if I really love
, you think it's okay?

305
00:34:32,512 --> 00:34:36,070
Yes. I mean, later,
when you're older.

306
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,514
I have 15 years I
and modern.

307
00:34:41,757 --> 00:34:44,371
I thought I was modern.

308
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,338
Come on, let's go again.

309
00:34:59,146 --> 00:35:01,677
Is this good for the chest?
- What?

310
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:05,666
Say whether this is good for the chest
basket? - It is good for the brain.

311
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:09,976
Ferris does not have to practice,
in the excellent shape. - Shut up.

312
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:14,070
Mr. Callahan.
- What?

313
00:35:14,106 --> 00:35:16,559
Ferris has great legs.
- Yes.

314
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:18,719
Probably trains.

315
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:22,034
Believe me, when you'll have
40, you'll be thanking me for this.

316
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,710
Honestly, I doubt.

317
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:28,748
G. Callahan, we think you'll
like this.

318
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:33,380

How do you feel?
- Unstable.

332
00:36:38,978 --> 00:36:43,788

00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,452
You'll have to serve.

352
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:42,469
Thank you.

353
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:46,023
And how you got here?

354
00:39:46,057 --> 00:39:48,043
Good.

355
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:51,327
Children are different.

356
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:55,568
Reading the book and how similar.

357
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:59,806
Well? Nobody prevented the
you read.

358
00:40:08,563 --> 00:40:10,518
Oh, not bad.

359
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:14,688
Not bad.

360
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:19,440
I wondered ..

361
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:24,407
You probably do not concern ..

362
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:28,974
Can I ask you something?

363
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:33,940
I have nothing to hide.
Endžel, I'm your mother.

364
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:36,065
You can ask me anything you want
.

365
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:39,190
What?

366
00:40:44,105 --> 00:40:50,213
When you are ..

367
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:53,259
When did you lose your virginity?

368
00:40:53,293 --> 00:40:56,313
I just want to know.

369
00:40:56,347 --> 00:40:59,704
Why? Why are you interested
?

370
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:04,382
I'm just curious.

371
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:11,557
I probably had
19 years. - 19?

372
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:15,222
Oh, that's nothing.
Still nothing.

373
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:20,894
So why is everyone making
such a fuss about it?

374
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,684
Forward Ferris!

375
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:31,108
Looks like you gained
a lot of new friends.

376
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:36,880
Where is the color?
- Red represents anger.

377
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:39,623
Do you agree or
may quarrel? - No.

378
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:42,887
We love each other!

379
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:47,177
I bet you love while we
me that, but when we go .. - No!

380
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:50,010
What are you doing?
. Sometimes I give her a treat.

381
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:53,554
Is has become more orderly.
- Oh, yes!

382
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,889
Perhaps will return.

383
00:42:01,882 --> 00:42:09,307
It is very impulsive.
- Where did she go?

384
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:13,253
In Rino.
- People there are divorcing.

385
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,887
Why did you say returns?

386
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:26,460
.. She said that she needed time to think
.

387
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:34,365
Truth.

388
00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:37,434
Are you seeing someone?

389
00:42:39,472 --> 00:42:42,822
I would not exactly call it that.

390
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:50,670
So it's over.

391
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,152
Let's try now the cake.

392
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:03,038
Hey, Ferris, you're not gonna do the cake?
Ferris?

393
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:05,139
I will!
- Hey!

394
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:08,311
Do not gain weight! Boys
refuses cellulite.

395
00:43:17,697 --> 00:43:19,606
Get up! You've got time swimming!

396
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:54,469
Hey, Randy!
- Oh, Randy. Yes!

397
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:56,092
Who, me?

398
00:43:57,505 --> 00:43:58,960
It!

399
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:08,612
What's up?

400
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:10,771
Get in, you fool.

401
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:38,351
<i> Oh my love,
for the first time in my life </i>

402
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:43,385
<i> eyes wide open. </i>

403
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:51,485
<i> Oh, my mistress, for the first time
in my life. </i>

404
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:57,213
<i> My eyes do not see. </i>

405
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:06,429
<i> I see the wind,
see the trees. </i>

406
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:11,769
<i> Everything is clear in my heart. </i>

407
00:45:14,605 --> 00:45:20,545
<i> I see the clouds,
see the sky, </i>

408
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:26,184
<i> Everything is clear in my world. </i>

409
00:45:28,755 --> 00:45:34,376
<i> Oh, my love,
for the first time in my life .. </i>

410
00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:49,005
Do I look dead?
- Very.

411
00:45:54,356 --> 00:45:57,655
Well, how are you?
- Beer?

412
00:45:59,143 --> 00:46:01,090
Yes.

413
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:09,461
Where did you get?
- I brought from home.

414
00:46:10,438 --> 00:46:12,641
Smart, Endžel.

415
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:14,858
Do not let that fool you.

416
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:20,543
So cool you got here?

417
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:30,449
This nature is a little pain in the ass.
- Yes.

418
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,976
Here, have another one.

419
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:40,063
Slow down.
I finished the first.

420
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,161
Come on, drink up.

421
00:47:04,085 --> 00:47:07,873
Ferris, I can not help you
if you tell me what's wrong.

422
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,677
You need to kick out, and not to faint
, you idiot.

423
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:30,543
Ready.

424
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:33,559
Aim.

425
00:47:34,411 --> 00:47:36,338
Fire.

426
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:39,496
Very good.

427
00:47:41,646 --> 00:47:44,327
This is called setting
lightning. Observe.

428
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:48,934
You know, you're needed Ferris.
- You bet.

429
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:52,297
Know, persistently reminds me of that.
Draw an invisible line using

430
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:55,643
these three fingers. See?
- When are you going to go to her?

431
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,164
Soon. Set the arrowhead.
Pulled to the end.

432
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:02,740
See?
- See.

433
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:05,809
I leave.
- Leave.

434
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:09,699
Wow! Macho man.
- Now you try it.

435
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:11,775
Good.

436
00:48:16,123 --> 00:48:19,050
Please do not confuse me
more than we already have.

437
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:23,692
Did I show you this?
- No. - Okay.

438
00:48:24,427 --> 00:48:27,447
I do not know why we do this.
My parents do not want to

439
00:48:27,481 --> 00:48:29,235
participate in the competitive category
sports.

440
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:32,211
Shooting is not competitive category,
imbecile.

441
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:36,313
You know, I thought.

442
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:42,724
How do we know when it happens ..
.

443
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:45,612
What?

444
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:55,117
Well, we can not look
when they know... Can we?

445
00:48:58,242 --> 00:49:00,791
Oh, you sound inexperienced, dear.

446
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:05,708
When I became a woman,
my eyes sparkled.

447
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:13,963
Oh, yeah. A person becomes a sparkling
and it looks great.

448
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:17,119
Well, yes. Silly me.

449
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:21,375
How are you?
- Good.

450
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:23,490
Is it? I waited by the pool,
where have you been?

451
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:26,539
I forgot.
- Are you okay?

452
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:28,811
I do not believe you.

453
00:49:29,971 --> 00:49:32,333
Is everything okay?

454
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,039
You know .. if you want to talk
about anything, I'm here.

455
00:49:37,818 --> 00:49:39,025
Thank you.

456
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:48,293
Listen, I do not intend to lose it!
Endžel will get to the fourth base tonight!

457
00:49:50,346 --> 00:49:53,259
Listen, bitch. Get a grip!

458
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:56,201
No one can make me a fool,
clear?

459
00:49:59,918 --> 00:50:01,190
Damn!

460
00:50:03,193 --> 00:50:07,094
Okay. Remember.
Do not be scared.

461
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:09,056
This is the most important.

462
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:10,181
I ..

463
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,063
Do not talk about his past
.

464
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,952
These men refused.
- I have no past, you fool.

465
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:23,670
Will you stop
with that?

466
00:50:23,706 --> 00:50:26,579
I wanted to say, do not be too Lien
.

467
00:50:27,536 --> 00:50:29,293
Why?

468
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:32,527
I do not know.

469
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:40,043
Men are afraid of falling in love.
- Do you advise.

470
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:45,871
And remember, all we will be
with you!

471
00:50:46,802 --> 00:50:48,697
Figuratively.

472
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:59,652
I remember, introduced lilies
stink more than weeds.

473
00:51:01,974 --> 00:51:03,755
Shakespeare.

474
00:51:06,476 --> 00:51:07,545
Good luck.

475
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:14,583
I do not worry, it's not so bad.
If it were, no one would work.

476
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:17,367
Think about it.

477
00:51:43,405 --> 00:51:45,750
What if you get caught?
- I'll tell you I meseèar.

478
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:34,927
What's wrong?
- Nothing!

479
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,871
This is for you.

480
00:52:48,128 --> 00:52:51,117
Do not get pregnant, you idiot.

481
00:52:52,885 --> 00:52:56,570
Why do not you use the pill?
- Are allergic to it.

482
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:08,516
Turn.
- What?

483
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:14,737
Turn.
I have to take my clothes off? - I'll help you.

484
00:53:22,342 --> 00:53:26,364
I got it. - Is it?
- Yes. Okay?

485
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:40,822
Will you need to undress
or you will not?

486
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:44,505
I want.
- Come on.

487
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,175
Not here!

488
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:05,041
There.
- You're a pervert.

489
00:54:07,918 --> 00:54:10,878
Do not forget packet of.
- Do not worry.

490
00:54:35,206 --> 00:54:39,710
Ispušiæeš whole cigarette?
- Yes, why not? Smoking relaxes me.

491
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,869
You take it?

492
00:54:56,614 --> 00:54:58,768
Is smoking non-stop?
- Shut up!

493
00:55:01,952 --> 00:55:04,085
Do not stay all night.
The bed is ready.

494
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:08,157
Endžel.
- Stop me banging.

495
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:10,342
I'm freezing my ass here.

496
00:55:13,028 --> 00:55:15,809
Are there leaks?
If leaks will not there to do it.

497
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,954
No way!
- It's dry.

498
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:22,469
Are you sure?

499
00:55:23,623 --> 00:55:27,657
It is definitely not normal.
Yes, I'm sure! Come on. Come on.

500
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,882
Turn.

501
00:55:42,711 --> 00:55:44,481
Why are we here?
Are we gonna do this or we're not?

502
00:55:44,516 --> 00:55:46,260
Do not shout at me!

503
00:55:55,262 --> 00:55:57,338
And if you forget to put
what, I'll kill you, I swear!

504
00:55:57,373 --> 00:55:59,777
I'm not going to get pregnant.

505
00:56:02,536 --> 00:56:04,295
I'm not ready to lift someone's
imp.

506
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:07,273
I do not know what the men.
Always they come unprepared!

507
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:08,880
They think that it is the woman's responsibility
.

508
00:56:09,818 --> 00:56:12,237
Are you ready?
- Do not rush me.

509
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:20,362
Feel free to rest all night.
I would not have touched it to my plate.

510
00:56:20,398 --> 00:56:21,867
What is it?

511
00:56:22,653 --> 00:56:25,074
I'm not interested, that's what.
- Why?

512
00:56:26,431 --> 00:56:28,400
Too much talking.
- Why are you angry?

513
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,594
Who's angry?

514
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,693
I'm not into you.
You're not my type.

515
00:56:34,717 --> 00:56:37,434
A and kids your age ..
- I have age as you!

516
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:44,081
I know what it is. It varnish your fish.
You're in love with her.

517
00:56:44,115 --> 00:56:46,378
She has a way with men.
You just give me.

518
00:56:46,413 --> 00:56:47,648
I know talve, just talking,
and when should be submitted to the action ..

519
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:49,702
I prepared.
- Well, too bad.

520
00:56:53,313 --> 00:56:56,202
Get someone else.
No longer waste my time on you.

521
00:56:59,974 --> 00:57:01,184
I did not sexy?

522
00:57:03,391 --> 00:57:05,860
I have all the sexy girls.

523
00:57:08,586 --> 00:57:13,992
Ok, now we can do that.
- Hey, some other time, okay?

524
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:22,938
I like you.
- Fuck you!

525
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:20,432
And when are you going back to see Randy?

526
00:58:23,476 --> 00:58:26,344
I do not want a few days.
Has a busy schedule.

527
00:58:29,668 --> 00:58:31,284
Might need you to find another boyfriend.

528
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,329
You know, I thought.
Loss of innocence should be

529
00:58:39,364 --> 00:58:40,599
private matter.

530
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:45,168
Are you sure you're
still a virgin?

531
00:58:47,927 --> 00:58:49,293
This is bad karma.

532
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:57,364
Good. Odustaæemo.

533
00:58:58,822 --> 00:59:01,648
Preæi we in
Endzelīna team, okay?

534
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:14,085
You really let us down.

535
00:59:18,436 --> 00:59:20,101
I'm going to see him tonight.

536
00:59:34,648 --> 00:59:36,150
Go!

537
00:59:52,474 --> 00:59:54,121
You said if I want to talk
.

538
01:00:01,922 --> 01:00:05,807
If you serve with something?

539
01:00:05,842 --> 01:00:09,679
I hope there .. not.
Do you want an apple?

540
01:00:09,713 --> 01:00:11,105
Do you like apples?
An Apple?

541
01:00:12,518 --> 01:00:14,384
I'd like some of that.

542
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:18,193
're Underage.

543
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:30,478
Back home constantly drink wine.

544
01:00:39,565 --> 01:00:40,753
No.

545
01:00:47,106 --> 01:00:48,878
Anyway not much of a wine.

546
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:58,425
Envy Juliet.
- To whom?

547
01:00:59,266 --> 01:01:00,826
You know, Romeo and Juliet.

548
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,831
Do you not like it.
It was so romantic.

549
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:09,025
Tonight is very hot.
Do you want a Coke?

550
01:01:09,061 --> 01:01:10,923
Can.

551
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:14,851
Little dizzy.

552
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:18,579
Well, because I do not practice enough
.

553
01:01:18,614 --> 01:01:23,155
Tomorrow I'll miss. Nichols that you
leads to pešaèenje of some 40 kilometers.

554
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:27,224
I'm burning.

555
01:01:28,259 --> 01:01:30,320
Oh, Gary, I'm in the prime of youth.

556
01:01:30,355 --> 01:01:35,385
In July, even though she died in the arms of her lover
, knowing ..

557
01:01:36,436 --> 01:01:39,213
Knowing what? - How is that to be a woman.

558
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,864
Dying.

559
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:52,936
Doctors say that to me
left very little time.

560
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:57,376
Six more weeks of life.

561
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:32,833
<i> Enjoy watching a movie you want tatuina </i>

562
01:02:44,963 --> 01:02:46,356
Get in.

563
01:02:59,106 --> 01:03:00,556
How are you?

564
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:03,115
Good.

565
01:03:04,972 --> 01:03:10,311
I'm sorry about last night.
- Stop apologizing.

566
01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:19,797
What is it? - Nothing.

567
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,208
Women.

568
01:03:26,894 --> 01:03:31,001
You want me, do not you?

569
01:03:31,036 --> 01:03:34,394
Ferris .. maybe you and I ..
but not the point.

570
01:03:34,429 --> 01:03:41,478
You see, I'm a sex poetry
phrases and everything about anything you been reading

571
01:03:41,512 --> 01:03:43,940
in books. But when you're really in love
.. - I did!

572
01:03:43,976 --> 01:03:47,543
Ferris, I'm not a prince.
I am a teacher.

573
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:52,126
In a year you'll look at me
pitaæeš and how you could just look at me.

574
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,748
This is not true.
- Unfortunately it is.

575
01:03:55,782 --> 01:03:58,943
What if I come back next year
and if you feel the same?

576
01:03:58,978 --> 01:04:03,755
Then I will be old.
Do you realize that I almost

577
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:06,503
the only virgin in the camp?

578
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,798
Each girl has a secret life
except me.

579
01:04:15,653 --> 01:04:18,815
Look at it this way.
It would be a learning experience.

580
01:04:20,411 --> 01:04:22,913
Come on. - Where are you going?
- To get you back.

581
01:04:24,922 --> 01:04:29,315
And can I stay here?
Just make it work.

582
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:41,027
Will you now go to the barn?
- Yes.

583
01:04:51,192 --> 01:04:53,001
Now that I'm 21?

584
01:04:56,077 --> 01:05:00,121
I'd have fallen in love with you.
- Really?

585
01:05:01,269 --> 01:05:03,391
Swear.

586
01:05:53,478 --> 01:05:58,048
Ferris has done it!
- Her face is shining!

587
01:06:07,744 --> 01:06:12,106
Hey, congratulations.
- A?

588
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:45,641
Are you ready?
- Ready.

589
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,170
Yes?

590
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,481
I feel funny.

591
01:06:56,936 --> 01:06:58,034
Something's bothering me.

592
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:05,414
Are you afraid?
- A little.

593
01:07:06,532 --> 01:07:09,936
I am.

594
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:15,119
How so?

595
01:07:17,889 --> 01:07:22,581
I do not know.
I've been thinking.

596
01:07:25,746 --> 01:07:28,027
I am.

597
01:07:28,275 --> 01:07:32,367
When I first laid eyes
seemed to me like a nice person.

598
01:07:38,864 --> 01:07:40,914
Hair is soft.

599
01:07:40,949 --> 01:07:43,423
Weird to be roughly
express ..

600
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:46,507
and leather and everything is so soft.

601
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:51,056
Is that good?
- You're kidding? It's great!

602
01:07:53,851 --> 01:07:56,447
Talking like some evil fish,
and in fact you are ..

603
01:08:14,878 --> 01:08:16,762
This was very nice.

604
01:08:16,797 --> 01:08:18,632
Yes, I've been waiting for this.

605
01:08:22,038 --> 01:08:24,698
Some guys like to hasten
things. I do not.

606
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:31,740
So you've been here before.
I mean, before us.

607
01:08:34,162 --> 01:08:36,215
Yes. No.

608
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:42,488
Sometimes I come here to think.
I do not look like a clever, huh?

609
01:08:43,296 --> 01:08:46,001
But in my head a lot of things going on
.

610
01:08:48,832 --> 01:08:50,708
Have you thought about me here?

611
01:08:50,743 --> 01:08:54,301
Yes. I was hoping that we would be together
.

612
01:08:54,336 --> 01:08:59,847
I have not been with anyone
since I met you.

613
01:09:06,297 --> 01:09:10,993
Come on.
I want .. I want to ..

614
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:18,462
immediately.

615
01:09:18,497 --> 01:09:24,430
Do you care
to me just a little?

616
01:09:29,764 --> 01:09:31,028
Yes.

617
01:09:44,744 --> 01:09:46,521
What happened?
- Come on, tell us, tell us.

618
01:09:47,277 --> 01:09:50,543
I liken us with
Romeo and Juliet. - Oh, God!

619
01:09:51,828 --> 01:09:56,588
We drank champagne cool.
- Aphrodisiac. I spoke to you about it.

620
01:09:56,623 --> 01:09:57,520
Yes!

621
01:09:57,555 --> 01:10:00,012
Did it hurt?
- No.

622
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:01,889
What are you brat.

623
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:06,082
Have you seen him naked?
- No.

624
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:09,707
It was dark.
- Do not be disgusting.

625
01:10:09,743 --> 01:10:14,579
How .. -
He would not be ashamed, and turned off the lights.

626
01:10:15,806 --> 01:10:19,020
Gentleman.
- He's gonna die.

627
01:10:19,055 --> 01:10:21,954
Come on, come on, come on.
- It was perfect.

628
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:26,668
We were enveloped in darkness.
- This is better than the book,

629
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,194
I tell you.
- Truth is always better.

630
01:11:23,141 --> 01:11:24,381
Do not look at me.

631
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:43,444
You can leave if you want.

632
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:48,640
Okay.

633
01:12:07,462 --> 01:12:08,827
Do you want a cigarette?

634
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:22,661
What did I do wrong?
- Nothing.

635
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:26,713
So what's bugging you?

636
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:37,889
's Not how I imagined it.

637
01:12:48,853 --> 01:12:51,837
God, it was so personal.

638
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,555
As you could see right through me
.

639
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:01,819
Do not get you. One minute
.. Fuck you, decide on!

640
01:13:07,307 --> 01:13:09,375
You were hitting on me.
If you want to stop,

641
01:13:09,409 --> 01:13:10,712
should have told me.
Very important.

642
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,087
There are a lot of other women.

643
01:13:20,668 --> 01:13:25,265
I'm not a woman, Randy.

644
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:49,305
Lovemaking is ..

645
01:13:53,578 --> 01:14:01,282
Differently than what I thought it was.

646
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,962
You mean this is your first time?

647
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:36,779
Jesus, why did not you tell me?

648
01:14:41,661 --> 01:14:43,177
I thought it would refuse you.

649
01:14:46,876 --> 01:14:48,445
Device are weird, is not it?

650
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:03,289
You're really pretty.

651
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:14,639
And what do we do now?

652
01:15:17,908 --> 01:15:20,519
I do not know a lot.
I do not know anything.

653
01:15:29,643 --> 01:15:32,171
I do not know, I
I love you.

654
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,815
You do not.

655
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:44,673
Know.

656
01:15:53,587 --> 01:15:57,488
God, I feel so lonely
.

657
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:13,341
Hey, guys, here is Endžel!

658
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:24,226
Well, if she did it,
it is a draw.

659
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:28,046
Works disappointed.
- It works differently.

660
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:31,356
Please tell me you did. I put the whole summer
allowance at you .. - Shut up!

661
01:16:40,024 --> 01:16:44,369
I'm sorry.
- Well ..

662
01:16:46,085 --> 01:16:48,438
That was it.

663
01:17:05,844 --> 01:17:08,948
Congratulations.

664
01:17:08,984 --> 01:17:10,737
Fair won.

665
01:17:15,025 --> 01:17:16,488
Pay.

666
01:17:19,065 --> 01:17:21,296
And this mouse.

667
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:34,277
Simpatía.

668
01:17:39,286 --> 01:17:42,177
Looking for Endžel?
- Yes, if you see her. Tell her

669
01:17:42,212 --> 01:17:44,324
that is waiting in the barn tonight.
Okay?

670
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,898
OK, but not coming.

671
01:17:49,427 --> 01:17:51,467
It was a game, you idiot.

672
01:17:53,177 --> 01:17:54,854
What do you mean?

673
01:17:56,698 --> 01:17:59,234
They wanted to see who will be first to be knocked
.

674
01:18:07,381 --> 01:18:10,547
Fish are terrible.

675
01:18:21,445 --> 01:18:23,367
What are you doing tonight?

676
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:39,119
You again?

677
01:18:39,154 --> 01:18:41,615
Can we please talk to
?

678
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,198
Why not, we're lovers.

679
01:18:45,524 --> 01:18:47,875
I thought you were a nice person
.

680
01:18:47,909 --> 01:18:50,109
Oseæajna.

681
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:54,130
You're a little cheat.

682
01:18:58,148 --> 01:18:59,582
You owe me an explanation.

683
01:19:03,023 --> 01:19:04,746
Talk to me, Ferris.

684
01:19:09,564 --> 01:19:11,900
I wanted to be liked
girls.

685
01:19:14,114 --> 01:19:16,630
I wanted to at least one
I like them. I did not want to be

686
01:19:16,664 --> 01:19:21,086
rich. - So you made up a stupid
story that you and I were together?

687
01:19:21,121 --> 01:19:23,748
No, not really.
I tried to tell them the truth.

688
01:19:23,783 --> 01:19:26,774
You have not tried hard enough.
- Please, Mr. Callahan.

689
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:31,189
Do not call me Mr. Callahan.
We're intimate, is not it?

690
01:19:32,975 --> 01:19:38,546
In a way. That is,
I wish we did have.

691
01:19:38,581 --> 01:19:42,082
I told them everything
I wanted to happen.

692
01:19:42,118 --> 01:19:44,317
It did not seem like a lie.

693
01:19:46,222 --> 01:19:49,195
Sometimes even I think
really happened.

694
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:54,024
If I was older.
I did not want to make you a problem.

695
01:19:57,201 --> 01:19:59,636
I suppose now you do not have
very good opinion about me.

696
01:19:59,671 --> 01:20:02,940
Maybe I would have done the same
I was your age.

697
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:09,895
I love you, Mr. Callahan.

698

01:21:20,712 --> 01:21:24,167
Long time no see.
As Cinder?

701
01:21:25,323 --> 01:21:26,967
How much did you earn?

702
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:30,006
I know everything.

703
01:21:32,453 --> 01:21:33,891
Why did not you tell me
comes to play?

704
01:21:35,886 --> 01:21:38,547
It would be the same, easy
povaljivanje easy povaljivanje.

705
01:21:40,283 --> 01:21:42,577
I lost.

706
01:21:43,657 --> 01:21:45,217
I told them, you know?

707
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:50,132
You deliberately lost?

708
01:21:51,353 --> 01:21:53,340
Yes, I'm a loser.

709
01:22:06,862 --> 01:22:08,684
You.

710
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:14,591
Let's try again,
Endžel.

711
01:22:18,274 --> 01:22:19,728
's Too late.

712
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:23,643
We started from the middle,
we have never had a beginning.

713
01:22:27,372 --> 01:22:28,750
We could try.

714
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:35,207
I do not even have to VIDAM if
do not. We can only talk.

715
01:22:40,259 --> 01:22:41,649
Why not?

716
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:49,157
Because that would not be enough.
For either of us.

717
01:23:07,894 --> 01:23:09,768
Never and never forget.

718
01:23:11,344 --> 01:23:13,360
Never.

719
01:24:05,766 --> 01:24:08,784
How did you and Randy?

720
01:24:10,136 --> 01:24:11,376
Good.

721
01:24:20,429 --> 01:24:22,917
Do you feel different?

722
01:24:25,438 --> 01:24:27,126
No.

723
01:24:34,591 --> 01:24:36,185
's Not how you imagined?

724
01:24:39,962 --> 01:24:41,661
Nothing special.

725
01:24:45,877 --> 01:24:47,911
But now you're a woman.

726
01:24:50,195 --> 01:24:52,335
My whole relationship is a lie.

727
01:24:53,769 --> 01:24:55,429
Come on.

728
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,923
I do not even touched.

729
01:25:27,885 --> 01:25:29,439
You know what?

730
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:35,811
Do not tell anyone.

731
01:25:59,006 --> 01:26:00,739
Me and Randy ..

732
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,293
.. Man

733
01:26:18,141 --> 01:26:20,309
Man ..

734
01:26:24,859 --> 01:26:27,203
The only thing you have to say
a man?

735
01:26:29,578 --> 01:26:32,313
For someone so many governments
vocabulary, apparently ..

736
01:26:49,157 --> 01:26:51,404
We are really fools, you know?

737
01:26:59,684 --> 01:27:02,230
My mother told me ..
- Can not we write

738
01:27:02,265 --> 01:27:05,359
anonymous letter? - We'll tell
Miss. Nichols. We all participated.

739
01:27:05,395 --> 01:27:06,792
And if you do not like it,
shut.

740
01:27:06,827 --> 01:27:09,073
What good does it
we tell her?

741
01:27:09,109 --> 01:27:10,408
We will help Gary!

742
01:27:11,408 --> 01:27:14,171
You're so naive.
Nichols would not believe her.

743
01:27:14,206 --> 01:27:16,210
They say that just wants
to protect her lover.

744
01:27:17,509 --> 01:27:21,201
I think Endžel and Ferris was right.
- Do not be so moral.

745
01:27:21,235 --> 01:27:23,815
I am a moral.
It's stronger than me.

746
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:32,631
If the two of you spoke
'll never talk to you. Ever!

747
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:34,963
Lots of care,
so shut up!

748
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:40,011
Listen, if we stick together ..

749
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:43,770
Hey, shut the fuck!
- Do not talk to me like that.

750
01:27:44,768 --> 01:27:48,481
Obratiæu you want to.
Get it?

751
01:27:49,425 --> 01:27:51,207
Do you think you're tough
because you're a model?

752
01:27:51,243 --> 01:27:53,234
Well, I'd rather be
thick and was a good man.

753
01:27:54,195 --> 01:27:57,234
Who cares what you think.
- I care.

754
01:27:57,270 --> 01:28:00,828
She is my friend.
What you can not say.

755
01:28:01,831 --> 01:28:05,488
Ferris, somehow glad that
There was nothing between you and Gary.

756
01:28:06,445 --> 01:28:08,541
Kissing is romantiènije.

757
01:28:11,313 --> 01:28:12,701
What do you know?

758
01:28:18,332 --> 01:28:20,444
None.

759
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:26,997
Wow, little virgin, sweet.

760
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:33,480
Hey Cinder, we have four.
- Yes I do.

761
01:28:37,796 --> 01:28:39,873
All you completely
conservative.

762
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,636
Do not hit me in the face, never!

763
01:28:53,671 --> 01:28:55,136
Never!

764
01:28:59,342 --> 01:29:01,764
Con artist.

765
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:08,885
Wait for us.

766
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,481
Hey, Sunshine,
have a good shot.

767
01:29:27,229 --> 01:29:29,969
You know, you're great Miss. Whitney.

768
01:29:30,895 --> 01:29:32,609
Really are.

769
01:29:32,644 --> 01:29:34,377
But to wait until 21 G. Callahan?

770
01:29:53,484 --> 01:29:55,399
Have you heard from your mother?

771
01:29:57,234 --> 01:30:00,686
No longer wants to be married.
He wants to open a boutique in Manhattan.

772
01:30:01,869 --> 01:30:03,966
Will that is found. Something like that.

773
01:30:07,841 --> 01:30:09,498
Looks like I will not see you again.

774
01:30:46,832 --> 01:30:49,569
I can not breathe.

775
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,896
Juhu Endžel! Here!

776
01:30:56,292 --> 01:31:01,006
Hey, how's my little girl?
You look great.

777
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:03,210
I have to talk to you.
- Yeah, about what?

778
01:31:04,331 --> 01:31:08,466
I think you'd better act.
What do you mean that sex is nothing?

779
01:31:09,671 --> 01:31:12,537
I do not know, I do not understand.
Do you think ..?

780
01:31:13,516 --> 01:31:15,703
Hanging out with cretins.
- Endžel!

781
01:31:15,738 --> 01:31:19,945
It's not nice to tell your mother.
- I'll have to keep an eye on.

782
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:24,300
Now you are 40 years old?
- 29

783
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:36,750
Hey, see you sledeæeg July!

784
01:31:41,185 --> 01:31:42,490
Wait a minute, you fool.

785
01:31:43,302 --> 01:31:46,298
This is my friend.
Ferris Whitney.

786
01:31:48,599 --> 01:31:50,373
My best friend.

787
01:31:53,783 --> 01:31:58,587
END
