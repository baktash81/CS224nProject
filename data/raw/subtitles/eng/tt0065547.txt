what are you mumbling about?

to some wild, faraway place
called New Mexico.

It was a gamble, all right.
And it was wild.

- Is he dead now?
- Might as well be.

00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,948
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

346
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,036
Well, I hear you're a bourbon man.

347
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,704
- On the inside.
- Yeah.

348
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,375
- Well, confusion to the enemy.
- Sure.

349
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,714
Mr. McSween, how long have you known
Lawrence G. Murphy?

350
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,842
Not long. I was out here on business
a short time ago,

351
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,636
and he offered me a proposition.

352
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,971
So I went on back to Kansas

353
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,849
and wound things up,
and came on back to Sioux.

354
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,768
What are you gonna do for him?

355
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,853
Well, I'm gonna handle his legal affairs.

356
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,021
Uh-huh.

357
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,857
Are you, uh, looking for your niece?

358
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,319
Isn't that her dancing with
that nice-looking young fellow over there?

359
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,531
- Yeah.
- Fine-looking couple, eh, John.

360
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,935
Give me another cup of that tar,
will you, Ben?

361
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,270
Sure, Jeff.

364
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:04,927
Stranger, ain't you?

365
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,139
Around here. Not other places.

366
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,296
It's a fair-sized gathering of beeves
you've got out there.

367
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,687
Uh-huh.

368
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,024
- Lose your horse?
- Some miles back.

369
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,445
- Whose brand's on 'em?
- Well, tonight it's John Chisum's.

370
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,822
Tomorrow it'll be the U.S. Army's.

371
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:29,368
- Buffalo hunter?
- Was, till there was no more buffalo.

372
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,245
Uh-huh.

373
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,247
The coffee smells good.

374
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,249
Help yourself, uh...

375
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,376
Thanks.

377
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,766
You know they've got company.

378
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,101
- Who?
- Mr. Chisum's beeves.

379
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,895
What kind of company?

380
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,148
It's good coffee.

381
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,276
About 12, 14 riders moving slow and quiet.

382
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,448
- You want some company?
- How do we know you're not with them?

383
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,635
Bueno, I'll stay and finish the coffee.

384
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,743
No. You come along with us.

385
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,328
I'll need a horse.

386
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,956

We'll take him back to Mr. Chisum.

Come on.

398
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,351

We'll take him to town in the morning.

What about the herd?

All them beeves are scattered
from here to next week, Mr. Chisum.

You sure ain't gonna deliver 'em
to the Army tomorrow.

402
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,942
Gather as many as you can.

403
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,446
He'll probably be your first legal affair.

405

I don't know what I mean yet.

00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,245

Mr. Garrett, was it?

- Texas?
- Texas.

409
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,709
- Looking for a job?
- Not just now.

410
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,712
I saved a small poke. I thought
I'd try my hand at a little gambling.

411
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Good.

412
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,423
I'd appreciate
the loan of a horse, though.

413
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,384
Take your choice and keep it.

414
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,427
- Thank you.
- You hungry?

415
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,389
No, but I didn't get a chance
to finish that cup of coffee.

416
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,433

I think we can do better than that.

PAT: That girl.
CHISUM: What about her?

418
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,864
Well, she's pretty enough
to be from Texas.

419
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,784
She is from Texas. You ought to meet her.

420

- This is my niece, Miss Chisum.
- How do you do?

Oh, and, uh,
Pat Garrett, meet Billy Bonney.

Hello.

424
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,805
I've heard of you.

425
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,310
Wasn't rustling.

426
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:27,106
Just out riding,
and his men started shooting at us.

427
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:30,985
Yeah, just out for a moonlight ride
on my land. Who was with you?

428
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,987
I got nothing more to say.

429
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,781
Don't worry, Mr. Chisum.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

430
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,452
Yes, Sheriff,
we will get to the bottom of this.

431
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,706
One of my men is dead. I've sent for
Judge Wilson over in Mesilla.

432
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,708
There's gonna be a murder trial.

433
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,168
RIKER: I ought to have a doctor.

434
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,129
- I bled some.
- Not enough.

00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,090
PAT: The Sheriff's charming.

436
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,719
Yeah, well, there's a lot of
charming people hereabouts, Pat.

437
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,722
If you change your mind about that job,
let me know.

438
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,600
Sounds good enough.
You got time for a drink?

439
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,810
- Well...
- Bourbon?

440
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,187
Just one.

441
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,354
(BOTH LAUGH)

442
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,733
McSWEEN: It's a big move for Sue and me.

443
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,401
You don't have any idea how big.

444
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,029
I've only been out here for a short time.

445
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,573
But, well, Alex, I'm putting together
an organization

446
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,825
that's bigger than anything
the West has ever seen.

447
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,037
Land, mining, cattle,
freighting, speculation.

448
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:26,749
Well, that does sound big. And it sounds
like it'll take a lot of doing.

449
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,210
Well, you'll find that
I'm pretty well-connected out here.

450
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,628
Here, look at this.

451
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,839
I may be able to show you a shortcut
to the whole proposition. Chisum.

452
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:37,218
Call him the King of the Pecos.
He got here first. He holds the key.

453
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,666
The Pecos River
runs right through the middle of his land.

454
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,013
So?

455
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,141
Well, you see, he lets the water flow
to all the ranches, big and small.

456
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,646
Now, if another man, with more appetite,
owned that land,

457
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:53,234
he'd control a territory bigger than most
states and bigger than some countries.

458
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,278
- Yeah, but another man doesn't.
- I know. Not yet.

459
00:35:56,446 --> 00:36:00,574
But you see, that's not just a map.
That's a chessboard.

460
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,327
And if another man makes the right moves,

461
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,414
well, there might just be
a new King of the Pecos.

462
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,084
Oh, gentlemen, come in.

463
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,922
Sheriff Brady, Jess Evans,
this is Alex McSween.

464
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,924
He's part of the family.

465
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,676
- Howdy.
- What does he do?

466
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,303
Well, he used to be a storekeeper,
and now he's my lawyer.

467
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,764
I prefer storekeepers.

468
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,432
Then don't ever get arrested.

469
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,601
I don't intend to.

470
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,103
Neither did Riker.

471
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,146
- Lawrence...
- Okay.

472
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,481
Yeah. All right, Sheriff.

473
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,776
Listen, Alex,
would you excuse us for a minute?

474
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,736
Certainly.

475
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,579
Lawrence, first it was Neemo, then Riker.
Now Chisum's sent for Judge Wilson.

476
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,291
- What are we gonna do?
- Have some wanted posters printed up.

477
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,167
- On who?
- Riker.

478
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,879
- What for?
- Your prisoner's going to escape.

479
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,048
- He is?
- He is.

480
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,885
Tell him to wait in the line shack
up on Bony Ridge

481
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,178
until the good judge
gets tired of waiting around.

482
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,890
- How much?
- How much what?

483
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,517
- How much reward? $100, or...
- No.

484
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:12,646
Well, don't be a piker, man.
What, $200... Nobody's gonna collect it.

485
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,735
Why get in a frazzle over Chisum?
You turn me loose on him.

486
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,195
There'll be a sudden funeral
right here in Lincoln.

487
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,323
Uh-huh.

488
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,574
Yours.

489
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,535
How's that?

490
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,038
- Do you play chess?
- Chess?

491
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,333
Now, what the hell has that
got to do with Chisum?

492
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:36,337
Everything. You just leave him alone.
I'll take care of Mr. Chisum.

493
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,214
- That ain't gonna be easy.
- You're right.

494
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,509
But, see, there's a fundamental difference
between Mr. Chisum and me.

495
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,677
Yeah? What's that?

496
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,388
Mr. Chisum is a man who respects the law.

497
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,683
Around here, I'm the man who owns it.

498

502
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,086
- What's the trouble, Juan?
- No trouble.

503
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,880
This greaser was just trying to tell me
how to run my business.

504
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,424
And just how did he go about that?

505
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,636
They have nearly doubled the prices.
We can't pay what they ask.

506
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,721
You don't like it, go somewhere else.

507
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,390
Maybe they will.

508
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,892
JUAN: There is no place within 100 miles.

509
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,937
About those prices, Mr. Murphy.

510
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,483
Well, prices are always going up.
Sign of a healthy economy.

511
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,693
Or a healthier profit.

512

If he needs some money,
he can always arrange a loan at the bank.

to carry a mortgage on his spread.

Why not? All it takes is money.

start up a store, too.

Would you mind explaining?

There are many problems attendant to
running a territory as large as this one.

- About how Cain killed Abel.

that ever took place?

They say he killed a man
when he was 12 years old.

682
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:20,428
He's killed over a dozen men since.

683

That's what they say.

684
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,974
He's got such gentle eyes.

685
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,072

- What's up?
- Nothing's up.

00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,997
There's a dodger on him.
I'll collect the bounty.

about two years back.

Got through the grades,
then the war broke out.

711
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,958
I never got to school much.

712

Billy, just to hear tell,
it made my ears bleed.

01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:08,456
And gather up some artillery.
I'm forming a posse.

Damn.

1024
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,823
GEORGE: But, Sheriff, the Governor
is not to be disturbed.

1025
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:43,241
MURPHY: He'll be disturbed, all right.

1026
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:44,409
GEORGE: But, sir...

1027
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,286
MURPHY: Sam, wake up.
Wake up, Sam. Listen to me.

1028
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,204
GEORGE: But, sir...
MURPHY: Oh, be quiet, will you?

1029
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,998
MURPHY: Wake up, Sam. Listen to me.

1030
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,334
GOVERNOR: Good God! Lawrence!
MURPHY: Yes.

1031
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,585
GOVERNOR: What happened?

1032
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:57,088
MURPHY: Just got a telegram from Lincoln.
Get rid of that damn fool, will you?

1033
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:58,590
- What?
- Him. Him!

1034
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:02,677
Oh, it's all right, George.
Now, what in heaven's name happened?

1035
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,555
The Kid just killed Brady,
Morton, and Baker, and then escaped

1036
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,558
while Chisum and Justice Wilson
stood there and watched him do it.

1037
01:18:08,726 --> 01:18:09,934
I can't believe it.

1038
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,978
Well, Sam, Brady, Morton, and Baker
believe it.

1039
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,826
And believe me, you're in the firing line.

1040
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,231
And you better do something about it

1041
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,610
before President Hayes decides
that you can't handle this territory.

1042
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:21,488
What do you suggest that I do?

1043
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,990
First of all, Justice Wilson
is a friend of Chisum's.

1044
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,158
So revoke his powers.
You've got plenty of grounds.

1045
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,455
All right.

1046
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,166
I'll do that.

1047
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:36,753
What else?

1048
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,926
And you good people witnessed
the cowardly and cold-blooded murder

1049
01:18:43,094 --> 01:18:47,138
of our beloved Sheriff Brady by
Billy "the Kid" Bonney, right over there.

1050
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:52,268
Governor Axtell has appointed
a new Sheriff, Dan Nodeen.

1051
01:18:53,104 --> 01:18:55,814
He's offered a $200 reward for the Kid.

1052
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:00,443
And I'm adding a further reward of $1,000.

1053
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,445
Dead or alive.

1054
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:08,660
The Sheriff here has formed his posse.

1055
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:12,705
Have you got anything
you want to add to that, Sheriff?

1056
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,000
Just this.

1057
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,836
I'm gonna bring Bonney in.

1058
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:22,090
You people can either help me,
or stay the hell out of my way.

(TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

1060
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,558
John, since Governor Axtell
hung me out to dry,

1061
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,768
there's nothing more I can help you with.

1062
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:18,062
So I'll heading back to Mesilla
first thing in the morning.

1063
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,439
All right, J. B.

1064
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:23,067
I'm writing President Hayes a letter
asking for an impartial investigation...

1065

By that time it happens, if it happens,

1066
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:27,697
Murphy'll have his name on everything
between Arizona and Texas.

1067
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:30,909
Mr. Murphy,

1068
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,786
just how much of Lincoln County
are you after?

1069
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:36,414
Well, Mr. Chisum came out here
several years ago,

1070
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,291
put his name on everything he could.

1071
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:42,170
I've only been here a little while.
Just getting started.

1072
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,923
You have anything to say to that,
Mr. Chisum?

1073
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:50,553
Well, I don't favor talking to vermin,
but I'll talk to you just this once.

1074
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:54,140
You're not just getting started.
The line's been drawn.

1075
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,143
What Billy did balanced the books so far.

1076
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:01,940
But if one of your men cross my land,
or even touch one of my cows,

1077
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,400
or do anything to that store,

1078
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:06,486
I'm not going to the Sheriff,
the Governor,

1079
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:08,780
or the President of the United States.

1080
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:10,365
I'm coming to see you.

1081
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:12,033
Hmm.

1082
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:14,536
Mr. Chisum, that sounds like a threat.

to treat me decent.

1091

He never hurt nobody.

1092
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:03,293
I'm gonna get anybody
who had anything to do with it.

1093

- They'll kill you.
- They'll try.

bollix things up.

of a lot of other people.

Are you talking about a lot of people,
or Sallie?

1117

Maybe it funnels down to her, too.
She reminds me of...

1118
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,785
There was a girl once back in Texas.

1119

A long time ago.

1120
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:26,417
And I knew that the best thing for me
to do was to turn my back.

1121
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,504
Let her marry a man that'd make her happy.

that could make her happy.

I get your meaning, Mr. Chisum.

I'm not gonna turn you in, Billy.

1126
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,439
But I'm telling you this.

1127
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:52,068
Don't ever show up on my land again.

1128
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,411
All right, Mr. Chisum.

1129
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:03,621
I'll ride.

1130
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,640
I didn't intend that you should hear that.

1131
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:26,477
I'm glad I did.
Helps me understand a lot of things.

1132
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,940
- Your father was a good man.
- Yes, he was.

1133
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:34,152
And I know you did what you thought
was right for all of you,

1134

make her own choice.

1136
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:40,742
She did.

1137
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,660
She made the right choice.

1138
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:49,625
So will I.

But I swear to you, señor,
we haven't seen him.

He hasn't been here at all.

you get to town and tell me.

bank and take his money.

- About half a dozen.
