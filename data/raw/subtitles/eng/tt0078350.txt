00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,129
Red Two to Topkick.

3
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,124
Stand by.

4
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,928
Red Two reporting, sir.

5
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,724
- Slater here.
- General, all personnel dead, sir.

6
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,487
No enemy force on site.

7
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,403
The only security breach a civilian van
on the base, but no driver to be found.

8
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,283
Any evidence this is
a preemptive CW strike?

9
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,481
- No, sir.
- Coming in.

10
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,083
Go on in.

11
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,404
Sergeant.

12
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,243
Who the hell are you?

13
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,244
Relax, Major. Please take your finger
off the trigger and I will explain.

14
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,486
- That your van out by the gate?
- Yeah.

15
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,248
How did you get into the complex?

16
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,721
It's a complicated story.
It starts a year ago, but let's skip that.

17
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,120
Let me tell you about last night
and this morning.

18
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,719
Search him.

19
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,529
What's that?

20
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,319
- Man your positions.
- Sunflower seeds.

21
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,603
Get it analyzed.

22
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,523
- Who is this?
- The van driver, sir.

23
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,486
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Unidentified force. Range, 30 miles.

24
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,340
- Closing from what direction?
- Not closing. Outgoing.

25
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,684
Check him out...

26
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,758
- ... and tell him to put his hands down.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,646
- What have you got?
- Estimated speed, 7 miles per hour.

28
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,690
- Seven?
- Whatever it is, it's big.

29
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,089
Slater to Air Search One.

30
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,288
Contact and identify outgoing objects,
bearing 183 degrees.

31
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,005
Distance, 30 miles.
Estimated speed, 7 miles per hour.

32
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,488
Repeat, that's 7 miles per hour, not 700.

33
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,562
Air Search One to Topkick, roger.

34
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,879
Air Search One to Topkick.
We have visual contact.

35
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,260
Identify.

36
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,967
A black mass. A moving black mass!

37
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,522
Zero altitude, dead ahead.

38
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,079
- They're hitting us!
- Oh, my God!

39
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,202
We're out of control!

40
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,158
Oh, my God! Bees! Millions of bees!
Air Search Two to Base.

41
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,487
- Bees! Millions of bees!
- Bees?

42
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,845
They're all around me now!
All over the canopy, trying to get in!

43
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,360
- Get above them, man! Take it up!
- I can't, sir. I'm losing power!

44
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,565
Oh, my God!

45
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,718
He's down, sir.

46
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,239
Good Lord!

47
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,885
Call Hastings Air Force Base.
Have them scramble and track those bees.

48
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,242
Major! Bring him in here!

49
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,365
This is Capt. Cord at the missile complex.

50
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,999
This is a top-priority order
from Gen. Slater.

51
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,725
Scramble aircraft and track a swarm
of bees 30 miles from the complex.

52
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,060
Yes, bees!

53
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,923
Now, what's his story?

54
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,125
- Bradford Crane, sir.
- That all?

55
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,768
Ph. D., Institute of Advanced Study,
Princeton, via Cambridge.

56
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,926
- English?
- American, for the last eight years.

57
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,843
Dr. Crane...

58
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,486
...you're in big trouble.

59
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,118
- What are you doing in this complex?
- I saw the swarms early this morning.

60
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,529
There were so many
they almost blotted out the sun.

61
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,370
I followed them,
but when I got here they were gone.

62
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,923
Then I saw the missile gates open
and I thought they'd flown down here.

63
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,609
I came to see if anybody was alive,
if I could help.

64
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,680
- In his van?
- Scientific equipment.

65
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:54,288
- What kind? Sabotage, explosives?
- Biological. We're checking it out.

66
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,398
- Who are you?
- I'm an entomologist.

67
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,083
- Bugs?
- Insects. What I do is not important.

68
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,848
What is important, critical...

69
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,725
...is that there are other swarms,
and what these bees did here...

70
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,727
...they can do all over the Southwest...

71
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,487
- ... and ultimately all over the country.
- Are you saying bees killed the men here?

72
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:20,121
- Yes. Just like your choppers.
- I don't know what happened to those yet.

73
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,722
I do know thousands of people
are stung by bees every year.

74
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,643
It's rare if anybody dies from bee stings!

75
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,081
- They have to be African, don't they?
- African killer bees?

76
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,681
- Yes.
- I've read their progress reports.

77
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,723
If they ever manage to come this far north,
it's 10 years away at the earliest.

78
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,608
By whose timetable, General,
yours or theirs?

79
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,561
Either you're some crackpot...

80
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,962
...or there's a direct tie-up
between what's happened here and you!

81
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,518
We can clear that up, and we'd better!

82
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,319
Kick on your com system and connect
to Dr. Connors in the White House.

83
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,460
- Arthur Connors, the President's advisor?
- That's him.

84
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,240
Are you trying to cite him as
your authority for being in this complex?

85
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,000
Dr. Connors hasn't the foggiest idea
whether I'm on or under this complex.

86
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,842
- But I have to speak to him right now!
- Lock him up!

87
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,969
- Yes, sir.
- General, thank God you got here, sir.

88
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,041
- What?
- This is Dr. Anderson.

89
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,408
She managed to get six men
into the hospital in time to isolate them.

90
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,925
Two are dead, the others are critical.
I need antitoxins.

91
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,567
- I have cardiopep compound in my van.
- Cardiopep?

92
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,844
I just read an article about cardiopep...

93
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,725
...by some scientist named Crane, I think.

94
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,645
Our preliminary results are encouraging.

95
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,725
You're Crane?

96
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,963
Yes. Our tests indicate
cardiopep normalizes irregular heartbeat.

97
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,328
Now, wait a minute. We're not using
experimental substances on these men.

98
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,482
This is his area.
It seems to me if he feels-

99
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,927
I don't give a damn! You're the doctor!
Tell me what you need.

100
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,798
- I'll have them here in 30 minutes.
- That's the problem. I don't know.

101
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,323
None of the usual procedures help.
I need to talk to an immunologist.

102
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,443
Get the Center for Disease Control
on the horn.

103
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,729
The best immunologist in the country
is Walter Krim in Virginia.

104
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,960
You'll find his card in my wallet. Call him.

105
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,801
- Go ahead.
- I know him very well.

106
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,441
I'd be pleased to talk to him.

107
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,921
All right. Go with him.

108
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,406
- What happened here, Captain?
- I'm sorry. You mean you don't know?

109
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,809
Not exactly.

110
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,606
- We were attacked by bees.
- Attacked?

111
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,940
I was in the hospital bunker
when I heard the alarm.

112
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,122
I turned on the video control unit,
saw what was happening.

113
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,767
Our men aboveground
were literally covered with bees.

114
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,287
I used an air-conditioning duct to get to
Pod Three and lead the standby crew out.

115
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,460
The bees attacked us
when we reached the hospital bunker.

116
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,400
I managed to get six men inside.

117
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,680
It's damn hard to believe...

118
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,480
...that insects have accomplished
what nothing in the world could've done...

119
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,650
...except germ warfare or a neutron bomb:

120
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,406
Neutralize an ICBM site.

121
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,598
Okay, let's go. Come on, Paul.

122
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,568
- All right.
- Isn't this beautiful?

123
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,199
Neat.

124
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,128
Here, Paul, take this.

125
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,002
- Here you go, hon.
- Thanks, babe.

126
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,041
Paul, look at that over there.

127
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,202
I think there's a waterfall
we can go to after.

128
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,686
- Hand me the cups, please.
- Sure.

129
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,809
Would you go to the car
and get the thermos?

130
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,860
Sure, Mom.

131
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,580
Go away.

132
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,209
- It's just a bee. Leave him alone.
- They're into everything.

133
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,728
I'll get them. Get out of the way, honey.

134
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,767
I think that's enough,
you'll wreck the food. I'm hungry.

135
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,438
It's hot.

136
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,038
- Hey, wait for Paul.
- I can't. I'm starving.

137
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,245
Mom, Dad! Look!

138
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,242
Dad! Come on, get in the car.

139
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,168
Mom!

140
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,246
Dad!

141
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,167
Mom!

142
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,809
Mom!

143
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,562
Dad!

144
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,002
Gen. Thompson coming on-screen.

145
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,322
General, we've received
and decoded your report.

146
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:55,164
We're having credibility problems
with the nature of the attack.

147
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,641
Specifically, with your statement
it was not a chemical warfare strike.

148
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,646
We can find no evidence of that, sir.

149
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,526
Your suggestion is the attack
is of natural origin. What is that?

150
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,079
I'm having the same problem accepting
that swarms of bees attacked-

151
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,638
Has that civilian been cleared, General?

152
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,540
No, sir.

153
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,766
What is he doing in our complex?

154
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,250
When I arrived with my special defense
unit, he was already inside the complex.

155
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,960
He claims he walked in
through the open gate.

156
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,049
I am Dr. Brad Crane, an entomologist.

157
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,166
I asked your man here to check
my credentials with Dr. Arthur Connors.

158
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,887
So far, nobody believes me.
I have been placed in custody.

159
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,681
Every minute now is precious.

160
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,683
We have been invaded by an enemy
far more lethal than any human force.

161
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,928
Dr. Crane, we're going to check
with the White House.

162
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,405
Dr. Connors had better know you,
for your sake.

163
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,398
- 'Afternoon, Felix.
- 'Afternoon, ma'am.

164
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,525
- How are you feeling today?
- Now that you're here, just fine.

165
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,323
Nicely said.

166
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,920
Everything's looking pretty, Maureen,
including you.

167
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,840
Thank you, Clarence.
The wire and the pliers, please.

168
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,085
Felix, think that rigging
is going to keep my banner up?

169
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,158
Just because you're mayor of Marysville
doesn't make you an engineer.

170
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,248
Don't be worrying about my rigging.
She'll stay up in a hurricane.

171
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:55,367
I was thinking how corny your banner
reads. Makes us look like hicks.

172
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,580
Nobody asked you to leave Houston
and retire here, you know.

173
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,527
Clarence, that's not nice.

174
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,500
We've been doing fine
with our flower festival for years...

175
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,362
...until this master mechanic genius
came to tell us how to run things.

176
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:15,369
Actually, the sign is sort of hicky.
That's what people expect.

177
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,322
The hammer, too. That's why
thousands flock here each year...

178
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,562
...to see the parade
and our beautiful flower floats.

179
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,800
That's right.
We'll grant you, Felix, this isn't Pasadena.

180
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,089
It isn't the Rose Bowl.
It's a pretty fair country-town imitation!

181
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,559
I'll tell you one thing I do approve of.

182
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,480
This year's theme: Love.

183
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,329
- Now that was Clarence's idea.
- That's right.

184
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,922
Everybody's got to have one good idea
now and then...

185
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,007
- ... even Clarence.
- Now look, Felix-

186
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,641
Mom, Dad.

187
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,280
This way! Quick!

188
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,601
They killed my mom and my dad!

189
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,444
Yes, sir.

190
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,801
We'll do the best we can, sir,
and thank you, sir.

191
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,327
Gen. Thompson coming on-screen.

192
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:52,288
Dr. Crane, your credentials
have been authenticated.

193
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,249
Nothing more?

194
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,764
While I confess to being surprised
at events...

195
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,047
...but the President has placed you
in direct command...

196
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,881
...of all operations relating
to this present emergency.

197
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,521
What are the limits to my authority?

198
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,719
None.

199
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,519
- Gen. Slater.
- Yes, sir.

200
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,882
You will provide Dr. Crane
with full cooperation.

201
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,600
You will give him equipment, whatever
facilities and manpower he needs.

202
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:33,087
All this is to be made available
to him without question.

203
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:37,803
- Without question, sir?
- Affirmative.

204
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:40,762
- Dr. Crane.
- Yes.

205
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:43,920
The President's advisor, Dr. Connors...

206
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,085
...told me he'll be calling you
within an hour...

207
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:51,608
...and I'd like to join with him
in wishing you good luck.

208
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:54,443
Thank you.

209
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:24,924
Major, when you checked
the non-lethal equipment in my van...

210
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:27,605
...did you come across
a beat-up briefcase?

211
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:30,923
- Yes, sir.
- Are you familiar with its contents?

212
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:35,729
Yes, sir. An inventory of the contents
is in the process of being typed.

213
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:41,004
Correction, sir. Was being typed.

214
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:46,723
Thank you. I want the particular file
that I'd marked "Personnel"...

215
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:49,681
- ... to give to Gen. Slater.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:53,481
While you're about it,
could I have my leather pouch?

217
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:56,564
- The one with the sunflower seeds.
- Sergeant...

218
00:25:57,451 --> 00:25:59,487
...would you get the items he requested?

219
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:04,768
The file contains the names, addresses
and numbers of everyone I want flown in.

220
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:09,127
Just tell them the war I've always
talked about has finally started.

221
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:16,650
- That's all? They'll drop everything?
- I'm counting on it.

222
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:20,487
- Anything else?
- Yes. In that same briefcase...

223
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:25,406
...there is a list of equipment. Get
the Pentagon's top procurement man...

224
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:30,409
...and get everything on that list
flown here not later than tomorrow.

225
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,141
Why here?

226
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:36,841
We're setting up headquarters here.
Time is the one thing we're short on.

227
00:26:37,891 --> 00:26:41,088
Now, I want to talk
to the survivors, please.

228
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:47,289
- Take Dr. Crane to Capt. Anderson.
- Yes, sir. Come with me, please.

229
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:54,609
Brother.

230
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,000
Major...

231
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:05,284
...you were an investigative officer
in Intelligence previously, right?

232
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:07,050
That's correct, sir.

233
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:11,809
Okay, I'm assigning you to this Dr. Crane...

234
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:15,963
...as his personal military liaison.

235
00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:19,251
Watch every move he makes.
Build me a dossier on him.

236
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:24,845
I can't believe he just happened to be here
at the moment...

237
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:27,729
...a swarm of bees hit this complex...

238
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:32,007
...and that he'd already prepared
with such remarkable foresight...

239
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:37,126
...a list of personnel and equipment
to be flown in here.

240
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:39,603
It does seem strange, sir.

241
00:27:41,571 --> 00:27:45,564
- Stay with the son of a bitch.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:03,364
This man is the most stable,
but his heart rate is still 120.

243
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:07,360
Take another blood sample
just before Dr. Krim gets here.

244
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,890
That would be three hours at the outside.

245
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:13,648
Infirmary, Major Baker.

246
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:18,771
Hold on a minute. Capt. Anderson?

247
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:25,450
Dr. Anderson.

248
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:28,843
Oh, my God!

249
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,079
- I'm leaving right now.
- What is it?

250
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,770
The bees are moving towards Marysville.
They killed all the Durants except Paul.

251
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:43,888
- I must go to him.
- I'll go with you. Major, you drive.

252
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:05,203
Paul Durant.

253
00:29:06,251 --> 00:29:08,003
- C-4.
- Thank you.

254
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:17,320
There's a bee in here! Please, help!

255
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:21,202
There's a bee in here!

256
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:26,247
- Relax, Paul. Take it easy.
- Get him away! Kill him!

257
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:30,370
- Paul!
- Doctor, would you let him go, please?

258
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:33,249
- Do what he says, Tomas.
- Back away.

259
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:38,288
Paul? Listen to me.

260
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:43,409
- There is no bee in this room.
- Yes, there is.

261
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:48,084
You are having a nightmare.
Only a nightmare.

262
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,727
Can you hear me, Paul?

263
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:54,486
The bee is not real.

264
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:58,246
Paul, I promise you it isn't.

265
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:02,883
Now, reach out and it will go away.
You'll see.

266
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:06,930
Now please, Paul, reach out.
Reach out, Paul.

267
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,484
Please trust me.

268
00:30:10,771 --> 00:30:14,480
Reach out. Further. Go on.

269
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:20,641
There. You see, Paul?

270
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:24,962
- No bee.
- Everything I tried failed.

271
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,882
I was afraid I was going to lose him.

272
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:31,244
I know how special he is to you,
so I called you.

273
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:34,166
- Thank you.
- How many times was he stung?

274
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:37,603
- I removed two stingers.
- That's one break.

275
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,520
- He's not full of venom.
- But he's delirious...

276
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:46,320
- ... muttering about this giant bee.
- It was big! It was really big.

277
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,447
About half the size of this room!

278
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:54,805
He's gone now. It was only in your mind,
and he won't be back.

279
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:00,005
- I have to go.
- Dr. Crane...

280
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:03,649
...thank you for helping me.

281
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:22,445
Contact the complex, please. Two things:

282
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:26,519
Gen. Slater must assign helicopters
to start a search pattern...

283
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:30,600
...radiating from the site
where the Durants were attacked.

284
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:34,121
The helicopters must take
no aggressive action if they spot a swarm.

285
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:37,101
We're gathering information,
not counterattacking.

286
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,810
- Clear?
- Clear.

287
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:45,767
Second item: Have the complex call me
the moment Dr. Krim is about to land.

288
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:00,847
Here come your choppers, as ordered.

289
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:06,722
Thank you, General.

290
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,244
No, thanks.

291
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:11,523
- High in potassium, low in sodium.
- Terrific.

292
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,082
Sergeant, start your patterns.

293
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,888
Start your dispersal pattern
in sectors A and B.

294
00:32:26,331 --> 00:32:28,970
Report immediately
any sighting of swarms.

295
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:30,621
Roger.

296
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:46,404
Tell us what you're looking for,
we'll try to help.

297
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:47,890
I'm looking for bees.

298
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:51,341
Unfortunately, they washed down
the Durant car before we got to it.

299
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:00,541
Look.

300
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:05,242
Doesn't look like a bee to me.

301
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:08,449
Plastic.

302
00:33:08,891 --> 00:33:11,451
It's a piece of a plastic cup.

303
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:15,760
There are pieces all around here.
Look. There, there.

304
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:18,086
What's so significant about that?

305
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,362
I'm afraid to speculate...

306
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,523
...but I think the bees did this.

307
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:28,446
You're saying these bees eat plastic?

308
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:30,761
No. But I'm wondering.

309
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:33,640
Your American honey bee
has a weak mouth.

310
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:36,200
It couldn't even break the skin of a grape.

311
00:33:36,571 --> 00:33:40,280
But it looks like this species
is tearing up plastic cups...

312
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:42,728
...possibly to line their hives.

313
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:47,370
Now, if this is true,
they didn't just get here.

314
00:33:48,451 --> 00:33:51,170
I mean, the invasion didn't just now begin.

315
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:55,166
They have been here some time.

316
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:57,242
Breeding. Increasing.

317
00:33:58,091 --> 00:33:59,141
So?

318
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:02,922
Suppose these bees...

319
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:05,571
...are using plastic to insulate their hives.

320
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:08,689
No bee is that smart.

321
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,321
Suppose these African bees are.

322
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,929
Walter!

323
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:44,646
Got a message for you from Mrs. Krim.

324
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:48,041
Carol is furious at me
for dragging you back to work.

325
00:34:48,451 --> 00:34:51,921
She wonders if you think
I'm the only immunologist in the world.

326
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:53,691
That's what you've always told me.

327
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:56,482
Ready to go to work, Dr. Krim?

328
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:03,322
Now I am, Dr. Crane.

329
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:09,289
- This is Gen. Slater.
- Just let me know what you need.

330
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,607
Thank you. We've got to move fast.

331
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:13,890
I agree...

332
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:17,368
...and in my opinion,
the fastest move is a quick knockout.

333
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:22,329
Not necessarily, General.

334
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:24,967
It's only the final result that counts.

335
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:38,324
Thank you, Brad.

336
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:09,821
The hallucinations
seem to be disappearing.

337
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,221
That's right.

338
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:14,647
None of the patients have had
a recurrence in the past few hours.

339
00:36:15,171 --> 00:36:17,211
You're doing everything you can for them.

340
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:20,521
- Keep these IVs going.
- Yes, sir.

341
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,501
Is there any other antitoxin
we could've used?

342
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:27,767
If he is right and the bees that stung them
were African...

343
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:29,364
...the answer's probably no.

344
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:34,007
Got nothing in our bag for them.
Not yet anyway.

345
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,969
Cardiopep might have eased
their palpitations...

346
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:39,121
...but it's no final antidote.

347
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:41,600
Call me if there's any change in these men.

348
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:46,364
- They don't look very good, do they?
- I'm afraid not.

349
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:56,126
You still refuse to oil this?

350
00:36:56,211 --> 00:36:59,044
I don't intend
to be stuck in this thing forever.

351
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:02,081
Have you finally met some miracle healer?

352
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:05,207
I'm studying Tibetan levitation.

353
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:09,721
In a few hundred years,
I expect to be able to float around.

354
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:13,605
- You still writing dirty books?
- Not this year.

355
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:16,208
Raunchiest thing I ever read...

356
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:21,042
...that paper of yours on the mating habits
of Bombus medius.

357
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:23,602
Those queen bees really are something.

358
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:25,483
Sergeant, this is Dr. Krim.

359
00:37:25,931 --> 00:37:29,001
The two officers with Major Baker
are Drs. Richards and Moore.

360
00:37:29,451 --> 00:37:32,170
Until they finish their work,
you don't admit anyone.

361
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,691
Have someone oil these wheels later.

362
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,010
You okay, Brad?

363
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,341
Yeah.

364
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:07,409
Go on. I'll handle this part
and call you when I'm ready.

365
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:09,925
Walter...

366
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:14,961
...thanks for coming over here so quickly.

367
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,451
- Problem, Doctor?
- About what?

368
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:38,768
I noticed that Dr. Crane
seemed uneasy in here.

369
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:44,021
Can't imagine why anyone would
be uneasy around all these dead men.

370
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:46,409
Can you, Major?

371
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:04,287
Is the man coming or isn't he?

372
00:39:04,371 --> 00:39:07,920
Yes, sir, the general is coming,
but you have to wait outside.

373
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:22,005
What's this about shutting off our water?

374
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:25,367
- Are you in charge?
- Yes, I'm Gen. Slater.

375
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:27,369
I'm Jud Hawkins.

376
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:30,961
I asked these tin soldiers
if I could see my son...

377
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:33,360
...and they tell me it's impossible.

378
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:35,610
Who's your son?
Why do you think he's here?

379
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:39,365
Because he was stupid enough
to join your damn outfit.

380
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:41,079
His name is Mark.

381
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:43,361
Airman Mark Hawkins.
He's stationed here.

382
00:39:43,371 --> 00:39:44,565
I want to see him.

383
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,641
I'm afraid that's not possible. Not yet.

384
00:39:49,851 --> 00:39:54,242
I'll tell you what makes it possible:
Me being the county engineer.

385
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:59,043
That makes it possible.
Do you understand me, General?

386
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:00,240
Out of the question!

387
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:03,522
I control all the damn water
in this county...

388
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:07,843
...and by God, I'll shut yours off
unless I get to see my son!

389
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:11,563
I'll shut this whole base down
in 10 minutes.

390
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:16,050
You won't even have enough water
to flush your toilets when I'm through.

391
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:19,840
I'm not sure you have the authority
to do that to a federal installation.

392
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:23,921
While you're checking with your superiors
to find out if I have the authority...

393
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:25,768
...I'll be turning those valves.

394
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:27,445
Now, you listen to me.

395
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:32,487
Word is, them same bees
that killed the Durant family...

396
00:40:32,811 --> 00:40:35,484
...killed a whole lot of men on this base
this morning.

397
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:37,399
I want to see my son.

398
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:40,763
I want to find out if he's alive,
and I mean right now!

399
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:45,690
All right, Mr. Hawkins. Open it up.

400
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:49,884
Come with me.

401
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:23,290
Anything?

402
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:27,781
The toxic content in their tissue
is the highest I've ever found.

403
00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:33,121
It's more virulent than the venom
of the Australian brown box jellyfish.

404
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:37,101
If that baby taps you,
you have two minutes to say your prayers.

405
00:41:41,971 --> 00:41:43,484
That's it, then?

406
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:46,461
Looks like your nightmare
has finally arrived.

407
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:51,130
The combined venom
delivered by three or more of these bees...

408
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:53,805
...may be a fatal dosage
to the average human being.

409
00:41:55,211 --> 00:41:57,645
The victim would be unconscious
in a minute.

410
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,602
We've been losing the battle
against the insects for 15 years...

411
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:08,368
...but I never thought I'd see
the final face-off in my lifetime.

412
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:13,327
And I never dreamed
that it would turn out to be the bees.

413
00:42:14,651 --> 00:42:18,280
- They've always been our friends.
- Until this species evolved.

414
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:23,164
Gen. Slater is outside with the next of kin
of one of the dead men.

415
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:28,524
- He wants to come in here?
- He said it was imperative.

416
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:36,359
All right.

417
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:49,286
Oh, God! No!

418
00:44:14,491 --> 00:44:16,766
I'm afraid you can't take him, Mr. Hawkins.

419
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:22,081
The only way you can stop me
is to shoot me...

420
00:44:22,171 --> 00:44:23,923
...and I'd thank you if you would.

421
00:45:35,571 --> 00:45:37,289
Hubbard. Dr. Newman.

422
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:41,326
- Thanks for coming.
- Glad to help.

423
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:43,846
You should know I came here reluctantly.

424
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:47,130
That's better than not at all, now isn't it?

425
00:45:48,851 --> 00:45:50,330
This way, gentlemen.

426
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:54,449
Would you excuse me a moment?

427
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:59,640
When the others arrive,
give them 30 minutes to unpack...

428
00:46:00,011 --> 00:46:02,571
- ... then have them go to the briefing room.
- Very well.

429
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:03,701
Gentlemen.

430
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:11,288
Rude son of a bitch, isn't he?

431
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:13,490
Never even introduced us.

432
00:46:14,531 --> 00:46:16,362
You'd think he was a general.

433
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:19,443
- He's asked for the duty watch tapes.
- Why?

434
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:24,322
He seems to know there's an automatic
taping system in the duty room.

435
00:46:24,891 --> 00:46:27,724
He wants to audit the tape
just prior to the attack.

436
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:30,928
I've already played it back.
Nothing that'll help us.

437
00:46:32,051 --> 00:46:33,609
But let him hear it.

438
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:37,321
- Stay with him. Build up that dossier.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:39,609
So, what about Rita?

440
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:43,283
She's been slinging hash long enough.
I'm gonna marry her.

441
00:46:43,284 --> 00:46:46,050
Guys don't do that,
just because they're having a kid.

442
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:49,600
I love Rita. I'd marry her whether
we were gonna have a kid or not.

443
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:52,519
At the tone, mark 0430.

444
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:58,085
It says we're scheduled to test
the alarm system...

445
00:46:58,171 --> 00:47:00,207
...right after the 0430 mark.

446
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:02,447
Stand by. Activating.

447
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,999
- What alarm system is that?
- A fallback...

448
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,969
...in case we lose the phone lines
or radio contact.

449
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:13,621
What's that?

450
00:47:15,531 --> 00:47:17,169
- Just the alarm.
- No, listen.

451
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:27,202
- Jerry, do you hear what I'm hearing?
- Yeah.

452
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:29,725
Duty officer. Right away, sir.

453
00:47:29,811 --> 00:47:31,881
...like a couple of million chain saws!

454
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:36,561
That came from the corridor.
Cover me. I'll go look.

455
00:47:36,891 --> 00:47:38,643
Jerry! Behind you!

456
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:40,645
My God!

457
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:45,128
- Dr. Crane, they're ready for you now.
- Okay.

458
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:49,804
Keep the tapes on the machine.
I want to hear them again.

459
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:10,760
- How's Paul?
- Recovering, thank you.

460
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:11,901
That's good.

461
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,727
Good morning, ladies, gentlemen.

462
00:48:23,211 --> 00:48:27,363
Please forgive the haste and secrecy
with which you've been summoned here.

463
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:34,529
The fact is, we've been invaded by
a mutant species of the African killer bee.

464
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:36,566
Crane, if I may.

465
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:38,804
Yes, Dr. Hubbard?

466
00:48:39,451 --> 00:48:43,888
I was sent by the President to help,
but I think you're dead wrong.

467
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,881
I was one of the first people
sent to Brazil...

468
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:50,088
...when the African killer bee
began proliferating there.

469
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:54,401
We prefer to call these mutants
the Brazilian bee, not African.

470
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:57,002
I'm well aware of that, Dr. Hubbard.

471
00:48:57,611 --> 00:49:00,409
I've been tracking their progress north...

472
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:03,005
...and there is no evidence whatsoever...

473
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:07,021
...that they've yet crossed
Central America, let alone arrived here.

474
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:11,321
Apparently, they came directly across
the Caribbean from Venezuela.

475
00:49:11,571 --> 00:49:14,927
There were three hurricanes
in that ocean tract this season.

476
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:18,046
Any one of them
could have swept the bees in.

477
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:22,122
Much of this land is used
to cultivate flowers.

478
00:49:23,011 --> 00:49:24,842
A perfect breeding ground.

479
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:29,009
With all appropriate respect
to the men who died here...

480
00:49:29,491 --> 00:49:32,608
...there is no proof the bees
that killed them were Brazilian.

481
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:35,728
Or, if you insist, African.

482
00:49:35,729 --> 00:49:38,570
What they're called
isn't as important as what they are.

483
00:49:38,571 --> 00:49:43,281
And what they are clearly is a mutant
species of the original African killer bee.

484
00:49:44,491 --> 00:49:45,890
Dr. Krim will explain.

485
00:49:47,331 --> 00:49:50,004
The autopsies confirm that the venom...

486
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:53,485
...is deadlier than anything
we've ever encountered.

487
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:57,642
It appears there's enough poison
in just four stings...

488
00:49:58,531 --> 00:50:00,203
...to kill the average person.

489
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:03,806
I won't dispute my learned colleague,
but...

490
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:08,000
...it takes 26 tests
to identify the African bee.

491
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:10,002
How many tests have you made so far?

492
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:12,261
Major.

493
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:22,763
You're looking at the final test
I made this morning...

494
00:50:23,851 --> 00:50:25,967
...from the one dead bee that we found.

495
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:31,685
Notice the 18-vein intersection
on the forewing...

496
00:50:32,731 --> 00:50:35,370
...and the 17 separate angles
of the hamuli.

497
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:40,922
Only one bee has that configuration...

498
00:50:42,211 --> 00:50:44,122
...and that is the African killer bee.

499
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:49,890
Major.

500
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,450
Dr. Hubbard...

501
00:50:56,171 --> 00:50:59,846
...I would appreciate it if you would
head up our environmental team.

502
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:05,327
Dr. Newman will be in charge
of the genetic counterattack.

503
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:10,206
Dr. Krim will try to develop
a mass antidote...

504
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:12,967
...to save the lives of future victims.

505
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:18,287
Because of the danger to nearby
Marysville, if the bees attack again...

506
00:51:19,171 --> 00:51:23,005
...I've invited Mayor Tuttle and
School Superintendent Ms. Schuster...

507
00:51:23,411 --> 00:51:25,083
...to attend this briefing.

508
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:28,159
Any comment?

509
00:51:29,611 --> 00:51:31,090
Mayor Tuttle.

510
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:32,530
Thank you.

511
00:51:32,531 --> 00:51:36,843
In view of what you've told us,
I'll set up a town council meeting.

512
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:41,321
I'll see that our air-raid warning system
is repaired.

513
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:43,800
It hasn't worked in some time.

514
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:48,480
If the bees come back, at least
we can warn people to take shelter.

515
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:51,888
A very practical approach.

516
00:51:52,811 --> 00:51:54,164
Ms. Schuster.

517
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:59,087
The idea of those killer bees
coming back is petrifying.

518
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:03,360
I'll alert all my teachers
to be prepared for the worst.

519
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:08,482
I appreciate your thoughtfulness
in asking us to this briefing.

520
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:11,290
- Thank you, Dr. Crane.
- You're welcome, Ms. Schuster.

521
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:13,730
Any further comment?

522
00:52:14,891 --> 00:52:16,563
What's our timetable?

523
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:20,001
Eight-hour shifts, around the clock,
seven days a week.

524
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:23,089
I meant, what's the length of our program?

525
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:25,048
How long can we expect to be here?

526
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,969
Until we have destroyed the African bee...

527
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:34,728
...or it has destroyed us.

528
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:58,202
- You guys ready?
- Yeah!

529
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,885
- Give me the binoculars and let's go.
- Okay.

530
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:23,807
- 'Morning!
- Hi, boys!

531
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:37,565
'Morning, Rita.

532
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:39,525
'Morning, Mr. Austin.

533
00:54:51,051 --> 00:54:53,211
Instead of the usual, I'll just have coffee.

534
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:55,882
- All right.
- I'll get it, Rita.

535
00:54:57,411 --> 00:54:58,810
'Morning, Felix!

536
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:01,724
A man would think
you'd let her have some time off.

537
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:04,931
At least let her go to the missile base...

538
00:55:05,651 --> 00:55:07,289
...and pick up Jerry's things.

539
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:08,730
I told her!

540
00:55:10,371 --> 00:55:12,248
I even said to her, "Rita...

541
00:55:13,131 --> 00:55:16,009
"... go home for a few days
and pull yourself together. "

542
00:55:16,931 --> 00:55:18,603
And she said:

543
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:23,719
"If I went home, and stared at them
four walls, knowing Jerry's gone...

544
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:28,409
"... I'm just liable to take his service pistol
and blow my head off. " She said that.

545
00:55:29,771 --> 00:55:32,331
She's better off pretending
it never happened.

546
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,681
Pretending them killer bees
never got up here.

547
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:43,279
I bet I can guess what schoolteacher
them roses belong to.

548
00:55:45,571 --> 00:55:47,562
You don't need no crystal ball for that.

549
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:51,721
The way I hear it,
Maureen is favoring you over Clarence.

550
00:55:52,691 --> 00:55:55,444
- I sure am counting on it.
- Yes, sir. The gossip is...

551
00:55:56,331 --> 00:55:58,287
...the odds have shifted in your favor.

552
00:55:59,251 --> 00:56:01,845
Now, them is my kind of odds.

553
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,084
- I gotta be going.
- So soon?

554
00:56:04,451 --> 00:56:07,761
- Yeah, but I'll be seeing you.
- Have a good day.

555
00:56:18,771 --> 00:56:21,160
- Oh, Maureen.
- 'Morning, Felix.

556
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:25,489
- I got you some roses.
- Oh, Felix. They are lovely.

557
00:56:25,731 --> 00:56:27,608
I usually get apples.

558
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:30,770
Oh, Maureen. I...

559
00:56:30,931 --> 00:56:32,523
Something wrong, Felix?

560
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:35,883
I'm not too good with words...

561
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:38,281
...but I am a retired master mechanic...

562
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:42,169
...and my education, well...

563
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:44,963
...it's all in these hands.

564
00:56:46,731 --> 00:56:49,928
And I know you know
what I'm trying to say.

565
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:55,042
Your roses speak for you.

566
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:57,727
Most eloquently.

567
00:56:58,491 --> 00:56:59,541
Thank you.

568
00:57:01,011 --> 00:57:02,410
And I'm mindful of it.

569
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:04,684
Then there is hope for me?

570
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:10,083
Oh, look at the time. I'd better hurry.

571
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:13,289
How'd it look for me to be late for school?

572
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:14,486
Let me help you.

573
00:57:15,771 --> 00:57:18,046
And I'll keep your roses near me.

574
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:22,039
- As a reminder.
- Thank you.

575
00:57:23,451 --> 00:57:25,442
- I'll see you real soon.
- You will.

576
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:27,205
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

577
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:04,603
We'll come back later.

578
00:58:06,531 --> 00:58:08,362
We have to plan this just right.

579
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:10,643
These aren't just any old bees.

580
00:58:23,091 --> 00:58:24,951
This is your reporter Anne MacGregor.

581
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:28,447
We're heading for Marysville
to investigate the report...

582
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:31,091
...of a savage attack by bees
at a family picnic.

583
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:35,683
It resulted in the death of a mother
and father, and serious injury to their son.

584
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,040
My next report...

585
00:58:37,131 --> 00:58:38,359
- Kill it.
- Yes, sir.

586
00:58:44,531 --> 00:58:46,123
We've picked up a huge swarm.

587
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:49,609
On this scale, that puts it
only 200 miles from Houston.

588
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:53,490
I can have choppers there in half an hour,
eliminate them before they get away.

589
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:56,289
- With what?
- Airborne chemical agents.

590
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:00,126
May we talk? Alone?

591
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:02,101
Sure.

592
00:59:02,102 --> 00:59:07,610
I don't recall our discussion
about the use of chemicals.

593
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,124
Now, listen.

594
00:59:09,451 --> 00:59:13,364
My orders are to assist you
in your scientific endeavors...

595
00:59:13,771 --> 00:59:16,160
...not to consult with you
on military matters...

596
00:59:16,611 --> 00:59:19,489
...which are none
of your damn concern, sir!

597
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:23,325
General, please.

598
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,046
These bees are of joint concern.

599
00:59:32,491 --> 00:59:38,009
They kill Americans without regard
for whether or not they should salute you.

600
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:42,281
There will be no airdrops of any kind
until I give the okay.

601
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:43,884
Your okay, huh?

602
00:59:44,131 --> 00:59:48,841
Then perhaps I can persuade you
to attack this particular swarm.

603
00:59:49,091 --> 00:59:52,322
Now that we know where it is.
Attack and eliminate it!

604
00:59:53,011 --> 00:59:55,206
Possibly, if you can explain to me...

605
00:59:55,451 --> 00:59:58,727
...how you airdrop chemicals
without killing native insects.

606
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:03,321
If your chemical kills the African bee
it'll also kill the American bee, right?

607
01:00:03,331 --> 01:00:07,688
Right. Better a few American bees
than a lot of American people.

608
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:09,689
That is the point, General!

609
01:00:10,451 --> 01:00:12,567
The honey bee is vital to the environment!

610
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:16,640
In America, they pollinate
$6 billion worth of crops!

611
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:21,489
Killing the bee kills the crop!
Killing the plants will kill the people!

612
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:24,407
No! No, General!

613
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:29,249
There will be no airdrop
until we know what we're dropping...

614
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:31,562
...and where and how!

615
01:00:34,211 --> 01:00:35,803
Excuse me.

616
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:40,770
What about the airdrop, sir?

617
01:00:42,211 --> 01:00:43,439
Sir?

618
01:00:51,931 --> 01:00:53,569
...the 0430 mark.

619
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:55,682
Stand by. Activating.

620
01:01:15,811 --> 01:01:19,247
- Jerry, do you hear what I'm hearing?
- Yeah.

621
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:20,760
What is it?

622
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:23,161
Sounds like
a couple of million chain saws!

623
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:28,561
That came from the corridor.
Cover me. I'll go look.

624
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:30,770
Jerry! Behind you!

625
01:01:31,411 --> 01:01:32,461
My God!

626
01:01:42,811 --> 01:01:46,201
Oh, God, no! No!

627
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:56,883
Come on, let's get them!

628
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:00,882
We've got to kill them this time!

629
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:06,206
Ready, now!

630
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:12,804
Let's get out of here!

631
01:03:16,611 --> 01:03:19,501
I can't imagine where he's gone.
We've looked everywhere.

632
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:22,487
He's been running a fever.

633
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:26,684
I returned him to the clinic after
the funeral, but then he disappeared.

634
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:28,405
We'll find him.

635
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,481
With everything else you have
on your shoulders, you didn't need this.

636
01:03:35,571 --> 01:03:38,521
I know I'm taking you away
from all your responsibilities.

637
01:03:40,811 --> 01:03:42,039
Paul is one of them.

638
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:47,760
Besides, I like being with you.

639
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:53,021
You're the one good thing
that's happened to me here.

640
01:03:53,651 --> 01:03:56,165
I like that. I really do.

641
01:03:59,411 --> 01:04:00,844
What is it?

642
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:06,781
Look.

643
01:04:07,851 --> 01:04:09,170
The bees.

644
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:11,211
They're heading toward Marysville.

645
01:04:38,531 --> 01:04:40,521
- I'll beat you outside!
- No, you won't.

646
01:04:43,691 --> 01:04:45,329
Now, Miss Cook?

647
01:04:45,411 --> 01:04:47,527
In a minute, Mr. Tuttle.

648
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:52,643
- Is this what you want?
- No, I need a note from your mother.

649
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,125
- Now, Mr. Tuttle.
- Thank you.

650
01:05:06,971 --> 01:05:08,484
Would you excuse me?

651
01:05:19,811 --> 01:05:21,244
That'd be all right.

652
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:24,768
Well, Clarence, who's minding the store?

653
01:05:25,731 --> 01:05:28,245
Maureen,
how long have we known each other?

654
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:34,010
- Maybe you'd better sit down.
- No, thanks, I'll stand. How long?

655
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:37,121
I remember you in short pants...

656
01:05:37,731 --> 01:05:40,370
...but I don't want to figure out
how long ago that was.

657
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:43,724
In all that time,
have you ever heard me beg?

658
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:46,088
Not you, Clarence.

659
01:05:46,491 --> 01:05:49,608
You're the original high-spirited,
independent soul.

660
01:05:50,091 --> 01:05:52,924
Well, Maureen, I'm willing to beg now.

661
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,887
Yes? Blue will do.

662
01:05:57,811 --> 01:05:59,927
Where was I? Oh, yes.

663
01:06:00,811 --> 01:06:03,564
Maureen, I want you to marry me.

664
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:08,687
Oh, Clarence, do sit down.

665
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:11,481
Name the date
and I'll make all the arrangements.

666
01:06:13,171 --> 01:06:17,483
- I'm not sure I'm the wife you need.
- You'd be the best wife in the world.

667
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:24,443
Clarence, I think I'm already married,
completely married to this school.

668
01:06:25,131 --> 01:06:26,564
Maureen, I love you.

669
01:06:26,851 --> 01:06:30,161
I know people think I'm just an old man
behind the aspirin counter...

670
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:34,005
...but in my heart I'm as young
as I ever was, maybe younger.

671
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:36,809
And I want to take care of you.

672
01:06:40,491 --> 01:06:41,810
Thank you, Clarence.

673
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:48,406
I guess I have to choose, don't I?

674
01:06:49,491 --> 01:06:52,244
I guess that's about
what it comes down to.

675
01:06:54,171 --> 01:06:55,923
Please hold the calls.

676
01:06:56,651 --> 01:06:59,245
I know I may not win out...

677
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:02,209
...because, though I pretend
I can't stand Felix...

678
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:05,809
...I know he's a fine man
and he'd make a good husband.

679
01:07:07,251 --> 01:07:10,004
But I know one thing. I love you.

680
01:07:11,091 --> 01:07:14,527
I always have, and I always will...

681
01:07:15,651 --> 01:07:17,528
...no matter what you decide.

682
01:07:19,851 --> 01:07:21,603
How lucky I am.

683
01:07:27,931 --> 01:07:29,444
All right.

684
01:07:30,411 --> 01:07:35,087
I'll give you both my answer
before the end of this school term.

685
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,205
How's that?

686
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,723
That's fair enough, I guess.

687
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:45,088
I brought these for you.

688
01:07:46,451 --> 01:07:47,600
Thank you.

689
01:08:02,851 --> 01:08:08,050
Why did they send us varsity here?
Any stringer could cover this story.

690
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:11,680
You're wrong. This isn't
just about a family killed by bees.

691
01:08:11,771 --> 01:08:14,001
Something else is going on. I can feel it.

692
01:08:14,331 --> 01:08:18,324
- We're the first national news team here.
- Okay, Anne, if you say so.

693
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,449
Let's check in.

694
01:08:21,051 --> 01:08:22,101
Get back.

695
01:08:36,451 --> 01:08:38,521
I've got it right here in front of me.

696
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:40,519
The African bees!

697
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,450
The African bees
that killed Paul's parents are back!

698
01:08:43,451 --> 01:08:45,407
Get everyone inside, and lock up!

699
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:49,141
Call the park! Call the ball field!
I'll call the school!

700
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,401
Get inside! The bees are coming!

701
01:08:57,811 --> 01:09:01,406
Get inside! The killer bees are coming!

702
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:04,610
Those bees are coming.

703
01:09:04,691 --> 01:09:06,761
Get all the kids into the building.

704
01:09:06,762 --> 01:09:09,530
Don't you understand?
The killer bees are coming!

705
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:13,046
- Get inside!
- Get all the children inside!

706
01:09:14,331 --> 01:09:18,643
Quickly, get inside!
Take your children with you!

707
01:09:18,731 --> 01:09:21,484
If you see any children alone,
take them in!

708
01:09:22,971 --> 01:09:27,249
Keep all the vents closed
and don't let anybody out until I tell you.

709
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:28,605
I understand.

710
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:30,729
I'll do it immediately.

711
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:34,766
Attention. Attention.

712
01:09:35,531 --> 01:09:39,410
This is Ms. Schuster.
Please listen very carefully.

713
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:43,209
A swarm of killer bees is coming this way.

714
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:46,770
I want every teacher and every student...

715
01:09:46,851 --> 01:09:51,163
...to close off whatever area
you may be in at this very moment.

716
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:28,089
Children! It's all right.

717
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:32,001
Quiet.

718
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:09,480
Here they come! Inside, fast!

719
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:11,724
Get it all on tape!

720
01:11:24,691 --> 01:11:26,841
Close your windows and doors!

721
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:29,447
Stay inside! Please, listen to us!

722
01:11:32,091 --> 01:11:33,141
Run!

723
01:12:02,571 --> 01:12:04,050
- Brad!
- Get some ice!

724
01:13:00,691 --> 01:13:02,090
They're coming in here!

725
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:08,203
- Is there a freezer?
- This way.

726
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:09,341
Get in it.

727
01:13:13,811 --> 01:13:16,041
Mr. Harris! He's locked it!

728
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:22,767
- Is he crazy?
- He's afraid of everything!

729
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:24,724
Aren't we safe in here?

730
01:13:26,211 --> 01:13:27,261
I don't know.

731
01:13:28,372 --> 01:13:29,872
No, the air conditioning's on.

732
01:13:30,972 --> 01:13:32,610
They'll come through the vents.

733
01:13:33,732 --> 01:13:34,881
Just a minute.

734
01:13:36,892 --> 01:13:39,804
It's 40 degrees in here. We'll be all right.

735
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:42,882
Bees don't function well
in temperatures under 50.

736
01:13:46,332 --> 01:13:47,382
Helena!

737
01:14:15,132 --> 01:14:17,362
Anne MacGregor reporting
from Marysville.

738
01:14:17,372 --> 01:14:19,886
The swarm left behind
a devastated community.

739
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:23,449
The town is reeling
under the impact of the vicious raid...

740
01:14:23,532 --> 01:14:26,251
...that left many of their friends
and relations dead.

741
01:14:26,652 --> 01:14:29,602
Marysville was preparing
for its annual flower festival.

742
01:14:29,692 --> 01:14:32,525
Authorities speculate the nearby fields-

743
01:14:32,852 --> 01:14:34,331
This is Frank Blair.

744
01:14:34,732 --> 01:14:39,089
We await a statement from the
President's top advisor, Dr. Connors.

745
01:14:39,612 --> 01:14:43,048
Dr. Connors is evaluating data
from Bradford Crane...

746
01:14:43,452 --> 01:14:46,569
...the leading authority
on the deadly African bee.

747
01:14:47,092 --> 01:14:49,890
Crane is now at the scene of the tragedy.

748
01:14:50,892 --> 01:14:53,406
- Dr. Krim.
- Did you locate him?

749
01:14:53,772 --> 01:14:56,605
We're trying to get through
on our mobile units. Stand by.

750
01:14:56,692 --> 01:15:01,686
Every opening into homes, churches,
schools and offices is being closed.

751
01:15:02,972 --> 01:15:07,124
Scientific authorities are warning
against overreacting to the threat.

752
01:15:07,652 --> 01:15:12,601
Scientists believe this tragedy
is a freak, localized phenomenon...

753
01:15:12,812 --> 01:15:14,882
...and could not possibly be repeated.

754
01:15:15,132 --> 01:15:17,692
Take it easy. Okay, there we go.

755
01:15:19,332 --> 01:15:20,382
Come this way.

756
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:30,241
Clear the way.

757
01:15:40,972 --> 01:15:42,485
- Hello.
- Krim here.

758
01:15:42,812 --> 01:15:44,325
Hi, it's Brad.

759
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:47,763
I just heard about Helena. Is she all right?

760
01:15:48,212 --> 01:15:50,521
- Still unconscious.
- Not good.

761
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,245
How are things back there?

762
01:15:52,812 --> 01:15:54,962
Damned unsettling development here.

763
01:15:55,892 --> 01:15:58,884
One of those four survivors
of the initial attack...

764
01:15:59,372 --> 01:16:01,966
- Yes?
- ... Higgins, the airman...

765
01:16:03,132 --> 01:16:05,168
...with only two stings, he just died.

766
01:16:05,652 --> 01:16:07,961
- What happened?
- He was doing fine.

767
01:16:08,052 --> 01:16:09,770
I was thinking of releasing him.

768
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:15,367
Within minutes, his condition
turned critical. All the classical signs...

769
01:16:15,452 --> 01:16:18,762
...of cardiovascular failure.
He was gone before we could reverse it.

770
01:16:22,032 --> 01:16:26,423
Keep the survivors there until we can plot
a recovery vs. relapse pattern.

771
01:16:27,232 --> 01:16:28,984
How bad is it in Marysville?

772
01:16:29,392 --> 01:16:30,905
About as bad as it can get.

773
01:16:31,632 --> 01:16:35,671
216 dead, 33 victims still alive.

774
01:16:36,472 --> 01:16:39,430
We don't know
how many stings per victim.

775
01:16:39,552 --> 01:16:42,305
- We're too busy stabilizing them.
- Dr. Crane.

776
01:16:43,792 --> 01:16:45,669
I'm sorry. I've got to go, Walter.

777
01:16:55,872 --> 01:16:57,828
Is it me you're seeing, or a bee?

778
01:16:59,672 --> 01:17:00,722
You.

779
01:17:02,672 --> 01:17:04,344
- Dr. Crane.
- Yes?

780
01:17:04,832 --> 01:17:07,710
Gen. Slater is on the horn
with Washington.

781
01:17:08,352 --> 01:17:11,230
- He requests your presence.
- All right. I'll be back.

782
01:17:11,512 --> 01:17:13,389
- I'll be up.
- No, you won't.

783
01:17:21,832 --> 01:17:23,424
Paul, what's the matter?

784
01:17:27,112 --> 01:17:28,227
It's all my fault.

785
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:30,830
I threw firebombs at the swarm.

786
01:17:39,392 --> 01:17:41,348
You're going to have to tell Dr. Crane.

787
01:17:46,592 --> 01:17:49,709
I'd like to, General, but Crane is in charge.

788
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:52,511
- I just follow orders.
- We'll check them out here.

789
01:17:52,632 --> 01:17:54,224
Right. I'll keep in touch.

790
01:17:54,752 --> 01:17:55,821
General.

791
01:17:57,752 --> 01:18:01,188
Crane, it's panic time from coast to coast!

792
01:18:03,032 --> 01:18:05,500
If we'd gone after the bees
right at the start...

793
01:18:05,592 --> 01:18:09,221
...instead of wasting time
with your science teams...

794
01:18:09,392 --> 01:18:13,067
- ... we wouldn't be in this damn mess!
- Okay, what would you do?

795
01:18:13,192 --> 01:18:16,980
I'd evacuate this area,
put up roadblocks across the state...

796
01:18:17,632 --> 01:18:21,591
...and spray the hell out of every tree
and bush from here to the Gulf!

797
01:18:21,872 --> 01:18:23,863
Let's take that a piece at a time.

798
01:18:24,752 --> 01:18:25,901
Why evacuate?

799
01:18:26,592 --> 01:18:30,107
Dr. Hubbard was out collecting
live African bees.

800
01:18:30,192 --> 01:18:33,343
He's brought them back to the complex.
Thousands.

801
01:18:33,432 --> 01:18:36,424
- How?
- They were on the surface of the lake.

802
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:39,202
Thirsty and exhausted.
Good, we need specimens.

803
01:18:39,232 --> 01:18:41,746
Hold it! I don't see it that way.

804
01:18:42,352 --> 01:18:45,310
The rest of that swarm
could still be in the area.

805
01:18:45,752 --> 01:18:48,266
- Major, get the final body count.
- Yes, sir.

806
01:18:48,712 --> 01:18:51,180
General,
you haven't answered my question.

807
01:18:51,552 --> 01:18:53,508
- What question?
- Why evacuate?

808
01:18:53,752 --> 01:18:55,310
I've been trying to tell you.

809
01:18:55,952 --> 01:18:59,547
When that swarm finds that their friends
have been taken captive...

810
01:19:00,272 --> 01:19:02,467
...they might come back to Marysville.

811
01:19:02,992 --> 01:19:07,383
Are you endowing the bees with human
motives? Like rescuing their fellow bees?

812
01:19:07,792 --> 01:19:09,464
Or seeking revenge on mankind?

813
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:13,389
I always credit my enemy,
no matter what he may be...

814
01:19:14,512 --> 01:19:16,184
...with equal intelligence.

815
01:19:18,952 --> 01:19:22,467
Okay, evacuate Marysville,
but not the complex.

816
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:25,868
- We won't waste time moving facilities!
- Agreed.

817
01:19:26,312 --> 01:19:30,271
Now, about this spraying every bush
and tree between here and the Gulf.

818
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:32,572
How will you manage that?

819
01:19:32,712 --> 01:19:33,827
Send out aircraft.

820
01:19:34,552 --> 01:19:40,229
With radar and pesticides, I'd destroy
every African swarm in this country...

821
01:19:40,312 --> 01:19:41,665
...wherever they are!

822
01:19:42,072 --> 01:19:44,347
- Major?
-232 dead, sir.

823
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,909
232 dead.

824
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:51,071
I know that, General!

825
01:19:51,592 --> 01:19:54,422
How will you prevent the wind
from carrying pesticides...

826
01:19:54,472 --> 01:19:56,702
...across cities, parks, farms and schools?

827
01:19:58,352 --> 01:20:01,002
Sometimes you have to choose
the lesser of two evils.

828
01:20:01,752 --> 01:20:03,310
Ridiculous, General!

829
01:20:04,112 --> 01:20:06,831
You want action and so do I!
We will do it my way!

830
01:20:07,272 --> 01:20:08,705
Now, give it a chance!

831
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:11,141
Dr. Crane!

832
01:20:15,272 --> 01:20:17,024
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.

833
01:20:18,832 --> 01:20:20,185
It was my fault...

834
01:20:21,112 --> 01:20:23,068
...what happened here with the bees.

835
01:20:24,712 --> 01:20:26,191
I knew where they were...

836
01:20:27,512 --> 01:20:29,150
...and I should've told you.

837
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:31,586
Why didn't you?

838
01:20:31,992 --> 01:20:33,584
Because they killed my family!

839
01:20:36,912 --> 01:20:38,265
I wanted to get them.

840
01:20:39,712 --> 01:20:42,180
And I did, I got a lot of them.

841
01:20:44,552 --> 01:20:46,782
Then the rest of them flew in the air and...

842
01:20:48,392 --> 01:20:50,030
Hey, Paul.

843
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:51,827
Come on.

844
01:20:52,872 --> 01:20:54,430
I'd have done the same thing.

845
01:20:55,032 --> 01:20:56,431
The exact same thing.

846
01:20:57,432 --> 01:20:58,660
You gotta believe me.

847
01:20:59,552 --> 01:21:01,747
Now, look at me, Paul.

848
01:21:02,472 --> 01:21:03,791
Look at me.

849
01:21:05,872 --> 01:21:07,828
When I was a little younger than you...

850
01:21:08,512 --> 01:21:09,911
...just about seven...

851
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:13,300
...we had a fire where we lived.

852
01:21:14,432 --> 01:21:17,230
I lost my mother and father that night.

853
01:21:19,632 --> 01:21:22,624
It's not good to have to grow up
without a mother and father.

854
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:27,229
You can ask me. I know firsthand.

855
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,630
I know a lot of unlucky kids
all over the world have to...

856
01:21:32,752 --> 01:21:34,504
...but it sure isn't recommended.

857
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:37,442
Now...

858
01:21:38,072 --> 01:21:39,903
...why don't you go back upstairs...

859
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:43,788
...and sort of keep an eye
on Dr. Anderson for me?

860
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:48,791
- Will you do that?
- Okay.

861
01:21:49,032 --> 01:21:50,082
Good boy.

862
01:22:00,272 --> 01:22:01,705
- Dr. Crane.
- Yes?

863
01:22:01,832 --> 01:22:03,390
Can you give us 90 seconds?

864
01:22:03,872 --> 01:22:08,502
- What can I tell you in 90 seconds?
- Everything you can, no matter how long.

865
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:10,264
Give me a second for my lead-in.

866
01:22:10,265 --> 01:22:13,951
This is Anne MacGregor
outside the clinic in Marysville, Texas.

867
01:22:13,952 --> 01:22:15,590
With me is Dr. Bradford Crane...

868
01:22:15,672 --> 01:22:19,711
...who is field director for Dr. Connors,
the President's science advisor.

869
01:22:19,792 --> 01:22:24,229
How can you prevent this tragedy
from happening elsewhere?

870
01:22:24,312 --> 01:22:25,950
Do you have any answers?

871
01:22:26,512 --> 01:22:27,991
At the moment, none.

872
01:22:28,672 --> 01:22:31,584
Can the death toll
from bee attacks spread?

873
01:22:32,192 --> 01:22:33,625
That's a possibility.

874
01:22:33,626 --> 01:22:37,111
What's the government doing?
What are your science teams working on?

875
01:22:37,112 --> 01:22:40,343
Positive ways to isolate
and eliminate invading swarms.

876
01:22:40,432 --> 01:22:42,472
What positive ways? Can you be specific?

877
01:22:43,112 --> 01:22:46,388
- That's tough to do in 90 seconds.
- Take all the time you want.

878
01:22:46,592 --> 01:22:51,222
That's the point. I'm afraid we don't have
any to spare. Excuse me, please.

879
01:22:51,992 --> 01:22:53,042
Thank you.

880
01:22:53,632 --> 01:22:56,305
Anne MacGregor, Marysville, Texas.

881
01:24:06,512 --> 01:24:09,629
DC ready, not exceeding five volts.

882
01:24:11,192 --> 01:24:13,069
Testing five volts.

883
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:14,842
Good.

884
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:21,587
DC activated.

885
01:24:38,512 --> 01:24:40,980
- How's it going?
- We'll be ready in a minute.

886
01:24:41,592 --> 01:24:44,584
Honey-coated. Three volts at. 5 amps.

887
01:24:46,032 --> 01:24:47,829
Okay, bring on the gladiators.

888
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,467
I'll stir them up.

889
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:04,030
Pesky little devils.

890
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:09,350
Spread them all over the grid.

891
01:25:12,592 --> 01:25:14,344
They're getting ready to attack.

892
01:25:29,312 --> 01:25:31,462
They're stinging the hell out of the grid.

893
01:25:39,032 --> 01:25:42,024
- We're getting plenty of venom now.
- We need all we can get.

894
01:26:30,192 --> 01:26:33,070
If there's a positive side to the tragedy...

895
01:26:33,752 --> 01:26:36,186
...it's finding these Africans
and the queen bees.

896
01:26:37,272 --> 01:26:40,309
With all this venom,
I can really go to work on an antidote.

897
01:26:40,952 --> 01:26:42,002
That's fine.

898
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:46,102
Hubbard, can you have your poison pellets
ready by morning?

899
01:26:46,192 --> 01:26:47,242
By morning?

900
01:26:49,952 --> 01:26:51,385
I don't see how.

901
01:26:54,832 --> 01:26:57,242
That makes your deadline
even earlier, Walter.

902
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:03,271
Smells like bananas.

903
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:05,510
See how fast it dries.

904
01:27:22,073 --> 01:27:24,671
Any further complications?

905
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,442
Dr. Anderson has just examined them.
They're doing well.

906
01:27:27,472 --> 01:27:29,781
Dr. Anderson? When did she get back?

907
01:27:30,312 --> 01:27:31,791
A short while ago, Major.

908
01:27:32,432 --> 01:27:35,265
I couldn't rest
knowing I had sick patients here.

909
01:27:36,112 --> 01:27:38,945
- Besides, Dr. Martinez says I'm fine.
- Good.

910
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:43,342
Captain, I've been planning
on having a private talk with you.

911
01:27:44,272 --> 01:27:46,228
It's about this civilian, Crane.

912
01:27:46,312 --> 01:27:51,306
I've received confidential reports
about your association with him...

913
01:27:51,912 --> 01:27:56,030
...which indicate your relationship
is now of a personal nature.

914
01:27:56,392 --> 01:27:58,986
I didn't know
you'd assigned anyone to spy on me.

915
01:27:59,352 --> 01:28:03,948
Has Crane asked you anything about
our operations here, even indirectly?

916
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:05,740
Why should he?

917
01:28:07,152 --> 01:28:09,586
He is a highly respected scientist...

918
01:28:09,672 --> 01:28:12,742
...and has been appointed
by the President to head this project.

919
01:28:13,472 --> 01:28:17,545
It still might be advisable for you
to discontinue the relationship.

920
01:28:18,352 --> 01:28:23,346
With all due respect, sir, what I do
on my off-duty time is my business...

921
01:28:23,672 --> 01:28:25,503
...and doesn't concern the Air Force.

922
01:28:25,592 --> 01:28:27,662
I shall continue to see whomever I wish.

923
01:28:40,592 --> 01:28:42,822
- Thank you.
- The doctor wants to say goodbye.

924
01:28:48,632 --> 01:28:49,682
Doctor?

925
01:28:49,752 --> 01:28:50,901
Oh, yes, Rita.

926
01:28:51,472 --> 01:28:54,828
- About the baby, you're both fine.
- Oh, good.

927
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:56,823
- Real fine.
- Thank you.

928
01:28:57,432 --> 01:28:58,501
Please sit down.

929
01:29:07,552 --> 01:29:11,545
With everything happening,
I haven't had a chance to say...

930
01:29:11,672 --> 01:29:13,344
...how sorry I am about Jerry.

931
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,465
Thank you, Doctor.

932
01:29:18,672 --> 01:29:21,470
I'll write to you.
Let you know about the baby.

933
01:29:23,552 --> 01:29:26,862
- Do you have a place to go?
- Not really.

934
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:30,052
They just gave everyone orders to leave.

935
01:29:31,672 --> 01:29:34,202
Of course, there isn't much to stay for,
is there?

936
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:37,985
Goodbye. I have to go.

937
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:40,711
- The bus is waiting.
- Let me walk you to the door.

938
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:44,068
- I'll see myself out. Goodbye.
- Good luck.

939
01:29:46,472 --> 01:29:47,791
Thank you.

940
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:55,987
Only one suitcase to a person, please.
Move it along.

941
01:29:56,712 --> 01:30:00,227
Not since the '30s, when thousands
fled the Oklahoma Dust Bowl...

942
01:30:00,552 --> 01:30:03,544
...has a thriving American community
been evacuated.

943
01:30:04,072 --> 01:30:07,781
No flood, fire or hurricane
has turned such a large section...

944
01:30:07,872 --> 01:30:09,908
...into a no man's land, until today.

945
01:30:17,952 --> 01:30:20,386
- Slow down.
- That's it. Move right along.

946
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:22,703
On the stairs, please! Move forward.

947
01:30:24,472 --> 01:30:26,542
- Have you seen Ms. Schuster?
- No, sir.

948
01:30:26,832 --> 01:30:28,390
Continue up to the stairs.

949
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:31,825
- Hal, have you seen Ms. Schuster?
- No, sir, I haven't.

950
01:30:36,112 --> 01:30:37,386
You boys lose something?

951
01:30:38,632 --> 01:30:41,271
You never did have
a good concept of time.

952
01:30:41,352 --> 01:30:44,788
I remember on our first date
we didn't see the whole double feature.

953
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:47,261
I was so afraid
you wouldn't catch this train.

954
01:30:47,592 --> 01:30:49,150
Here I am. Shall we go?

955
01:30:49,232 --> 01:30:51,223
- Yeah.
- Let go. I had it first.

956
01:30:51,392 --> 01:30:55,704
Look, I was carrying her books long before
you showed up in Marysville. Let go!

957
01:30:55,792 --> 01:30:57,225
Clarence, Felix!

958
01:30:57,312 --> 01:30:59,701
You promised me
there would be no more fussing.

959
01:31:00,112 --> 01:31:02,706
And this surely isn't the time for it.
Let go!

960
01:31:04,512 --> 01:31:06,901
All right. Follow the line.

961
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:27,148
...everything that they hold dear...

962
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,951
...because of killer bees.

963
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:32,944
Imagine having such
a natural phenomenon do something-

964
01:31:33,832 --> 01:31:36,141
Take this. Give me a hand with her.

965
01:31:36,712 --> 01:31:37,906
Get her in the car.

966
01:31:38,792 --> 01:31:40,842
- Is the hospital here operating?
- Yeah.

967
01:31:41,792 --> 01:31:42,861
Thank you.

968
01:31:46,872 --> 01:31:48,624
- You all right?
- It's better.

969
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:49,762
We'll get you there.

970
01:31:49,792 --> 01:31:50,986
- Thank you.
- Hold on.

971
01:31:53,072 --> 01:31:54,122
Hurry.

972
01:31:55,192 --> 01:32:00,107
Enter the car with the number you've been
issued. That car's number is five!

973
01:32:00,192 --> 01:32:03,741
Let's get this train out of here.
The bees could be back any minute.

974
01:32:04,592 --> 01:32:05,820
Where is Crane?

975
01:32:06,032 --> 01:32:09,991
Don't worry, sir. He'll be here in time
to take credit for the evacuation.

976
01:32:11,352 --> 01:32:13,547
Let me tell you something, Major.

977
01:32:14,432 --> 01:32:18,027
I don't tolerate my staff
saying things behind a man's back.

978
01:32:18,912 --> 01:32:21,710
If you think Crane's a glory jockey,
tell him, not me.

979
01:32:22,752 --> 01:32:27,462
If you're trying to butter me up
by slurring a man I consider misguided...

980
01:32:27,712 --> 01:32:30,385
...I don't need a pat on the ass
from you or anyone else.

981
01:32:31,392 --> 01:32:32,442
Yes, sir.

982
01:33:09,152 --> 01:33:10,949
Am I walking too fast?

983
01:33:11,112 --> 01:33:12,750
No, I'm fine. Just fine.

984
01:33:14,032 --> 01:33:15,590
Don't overdo it.

985
01:33:16,112 --> 01:33:18,103
Dr. Martinez said you had a close call.

986
01:33:24,112 --> 01:33:25,261
How sad.

987
01:33:26,112 --> 01:33:27,545
How very, very sad.

988
01:33:28,992 --> 01:33:31,745
You know,
Marysville was such a happy little town.

989
01:33:36,352 --> 01:33:37,910
Ritz's Bookstore.

990
01:33:39,552 --> 01:33:41,907
I used to work there
when I was in high school.

991
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,470
Everything was happy then.

992
01:33:49,432 --> 01:33:51,024
But that was so long ago.

993
01:33:54,272 --> 01:33:55,785
It's all right.

994
01:34:09,072 --> 01:34:11,950
You can tell a lot about a man
by the way he shuffles cards.

995
01:34:13,352 --> 01:34:16,503
- Thank you, Clarence.
- Wasn't meant as a compliment.

996
01:34:18,872 --> 01:34:20,432
Would you like to cut the cards?

997
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,951
- Something bothering you?
- What's wrong, Maureen?

998
01:34:28,232 --> 01:34:31,002
I got a sudden feeling
I'll never see Marysville again.

999
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:34,909
Or any of my children. It's frightening.

1000
01:34:35,192 --> 01:34:38,184
Maureen, that's not like you.
You're an optimist.

1001
01:34:38,312 --> 01:34:41,907
- Always looking at the bright side.
- We'll be home soon...

1002
01:34:41,992 --> 01:34:45,223
- ... and this will all seem like a bad dream.
- That's right.

1003
01:34:47,592 --> 01:34:48,911
I suppose that's so.

1004
01:34:50,712 --> 01:34:55,422
But I can't shake this feeling
that something's closing in on us.

1005
01:34:55,512 --> 01:34:58,390
Now, now, Maureen. Come on, deal, Felix.

1006
01:34:59,432 --> 01:35:00,945
- Sandwiches?
- No, thanks.

1007
01:35:01,672 --> 01:35:02,741
No, thank you.

1008
01:35:30,632 --> 01:35:31,906
- Ed?
- Yeah?

1009
01:35:32,672 --> 01:35:37,143
- There's a bee in here.
- A bee? Don't take any chances.

1010
01:35:37,952 --> 01:35:40,386
- Maybe he wants the apple.
- Then give it to him.

1011
01:35:42,792 --> 01:35:44,902
- Goddamn! What will I do now?
- Don't move.

1012
01:35:45,632 --> 01:35:47,384
Don't get him mad!

1013
01:35:50,192 --> 01:35:51,242
No, Charlie!

1014
01:37:19,592 --> 01:37:22,550
When are we going to stop this massacre?

1015
01:37:22,992 --> 01:37:27,224
- Our first airdrop is in half an hour.
- I've seen what you plan to drop!

1016
01:37:27,952 --> 01:37:31,103
Those damn poison pellets
won't get us anywhere!

1017
01:37:31,432 --> 01:37:34,082
Those are my damn poison pellets,
and they'll work!

1018
01:37:34,672 --> 01:37:40,304
I'm counting on them working,
or we fall back to almost impossible odds:

1019
01:37:40,952 --> 01:37:44,945
My coming up with a mass antidote,
which might never be perfected.

1020
01:37:46,312 --> 01:37:48,382
Thank you, gentlemen, for your support.

1021
01:37:49,432 --> 01:37:51,263
But, Captain...

1022
01:37:52,112 --> 01:37:53,750
...feed this into the computer.

1023
01:37:54,752 --> 01:37:57,141
African bees attack a train...

1024
01:37:58,512 --> 01:38:00,423
...70 miles northwest of Houston.

1025
01:38:01,832 --> 01:38:05,666
Now, give me a revised time fix, please.

1026
01:38:07,912 --> 01:38:11,109
I know how you feel,
especially due to what just happened...

1027
01:38:11,192 --> 01:38:14,787
...but right now we are ready
to drop millions of lethal pellets...

1028
01:38:15,512 --> 01:38:18,402
...without harming either the population
or the plant life.

1029
01:38:18,872 --> 01:38:21,261
- I'll support that.
- So will I.

1030
01:38:23,472 --> 01:38:24,825
What we need...

1031
01:38:25,072 --> 01:38:27,347
...is every helicopter you have.

1032
01:38:32,152 --> 01:38:33,585
All right, you've got them.

1033
01:38:34,392 --> 01:38:36,372
Revised timetable coming through, sir.

1034
01:39:50,592 --> 01:39:52,332
They're not touching the pellets!

1035
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:54,942
They're not touching the pellets!

1036
01:39:57,752 --> 01:40:00,789
They seem to sense
it's something that will kill them.

1037
01:40:04,152 --> 01:40:05,949
They're brighter than I thought.

1038
01:40:07,112 --> 01:40:08,261
They always are.

1039
01:40:09,232 --> 01:40:12,622
Maybe you should have tried
bourbon and water and got them drunk.

1040
01:40:16,792 --> 01:40:20,068
It's all my fault.
I threw firebombs at the swarm.

1041
01:40:21,152 --> 01:40:24,349
It's all my fault.
I threw firebombs at the swarm.

1042
01:40:37,392 --> 01:40:40,762
You've got a beautiful six-and-a-half pound
beautiful daughter.

1043
01:40:44,832 --> 01:40:45,882
Thank you.

1044
01:40:48,832 --> 01:40:50,663
I guess it's true what they say...

1045
01:40:52,472 --> 01:40:57,023
...that a woman sort of falls in love
with her doctor at this time.

1046
01:40:59,232 --> 01:41:02,907
I hope you will feel the same way
tomorrow. And the day after.

1047
01:41:04,072 --> 01:41:05,824
And all of the days after.

1048
01:41:21,912 --> 01:41:22,962
Paul!

1049
01:41:27,632 --> 01:41:29,111
Tomas!

1050
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:49,981
Helena.

1051
01:42:53,792 --> 01:42:55,271
Why this one?

1052
01:42:57,192 --> 01:42:59,422
In the whole damned world, why this boy?

1053
01:43:01,152 --> 01:43:02,471
My God, Brad.

1054
01:43:03,192 --> 01:43:04,830
What good is all that science?

1055
01:43:05,272 --> 01:43:08,264
All that equipment at the base?
All those doctors?

1056
01:43:09,032 --> 01:43:10,431
What good are you?

1057
01:43:19,832 --> 01:43:21,743
I didn't mean that. You know I didn't.

1058
01:43:37,152 --> 01:43:40,224
Paul was my first case
when I was the town doctor.

1059
01:43:45,072 --> 01:43:46,983
He wanted to be an archaeologist.

1060
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:53,948
- He would've been a terrific one.
- I'm sure of it.

1061
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:06,031
You didn't tell me three of the four
survivors at the base had died.

1062
01:44:12,952 --> 01:44:14,988
You had other problems.

1063
01:44:19,072 --> 01:44:23,862
And you didn't tell me there's a syndrome
of relapse among survivors...

1064
01:44:24,312 --> 01:44:26,143
...shortly after they've been stung.

1065
01:44:27,552 --> 01:44:28,905
A fatal relapse.

1066
01:44:32,752 --> 01:44:34,265
Some do recover.

1067
01:44:35,312 --> 01:44:36,745
A small percentage.

1068
01:44:38,112 --> 01:44:39,162
But some do.

1069
01:44:42,392 --> 01:44:43,666
Some.

1070
01:44:50,152 --> 01:44:52,347
The odds are better than none.

1071
01:45:04,152 --> 01:45:08,111
You've dropped your poison pellets
and the Africans spit at them.

1072
01:45:08,792 --> 01:45:11,502
They're moving toward Houston
faster than expected.

1073
01:45:11,552 --> 01:45:15,342
General, you should know the enemy
is always expected to do the unexpected.

1074
01:45:16,632 --> 01:45:19,305
- Dr. Crane.
- Major Baker.

1075
01:45:20,432 --> 01:45:21,831
Let's hear your rundown.

1076
01:45:22,352 --> 01:45:25,185
"Three steel mills, seven oil refineries...

1077
01:45:25,432 --> 01:45:28,742
"... two beet sugar plants
and a nuclear power center.

1078
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:32,390
"Plus 46 towns, not including Houston...

1079
01:45:32,472 --> 01:45:35,066
"... are now directly
in the path of the Africans. "

1080
01:45:36,432 --> 01:45:39,504
We'll evacuate the towns,
and close the factories.

1081
01:45:40,152 --> 01:45:43,522
I'll tell you now, we'll have trouble
with the nuclear power plant.

1082
01:45:43,592 --> 01:45:48,188
They won't shut down voluntarily.
Millions in the area need the energy.

1083
01:45:48,512 --> 01:45:50,628
If we don't shut them down, the bees will.

1084
01:45:52,792 --> 01:45:55,502
I'll check with Washington,
to try to get a directive.

1085
01:45:56,072 --> 01:45:58,506
I know most of the key executives
at that plant.

1086
01:45:58,507 --> 01:46:01,271
I fought them in court often enough
on environmental issues.

1087
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:03,945
I'll fly in and try to jawbone
some sense into them.

1088
01:46:04,232 --> 01:46:06,272
It might be a lot quicker than Washington.

1089
01:46:07,592 --> 01:46:09,822
Okay. You got it. Thank you.

1090
01:46:19,672 --> 01:46:20,787
Miss!

1091
01:46:36,032 --> 01:46:37,351
More bad news?

1092
01:46:40,032 --> 01:46:41,772
Everything we've tried has failed.

1093
01:46:43,232 --> 01:46:45,302
Our last hope is your mass antidote.

1094
01:46:47,712 --> 01:46:49,225
How close are you?

1095
01:46:50,992 --> 01:46:54,348
I've tried it on all these rabbits.
It knocks hell out of them.

1096
01:46:56,432 --> 01:46:58,184
These are the only two still alive.

1097
01:46:59,472 --> 01:47:02,362
I'm on the right track,
but I need more time to experiment.

1098
01:47:02,432 --> 01:47:06,744
If you can't perfect it, we might
just as well pack it in right away...

1099
01:47:07,432 --> 01:47:09,229
...and ship out to New Zealand.

1100
01:47:10,232 --> 01:47:13,304
What we need is something
that people can self-inject...

1101
01:47:14,392 --> 01:47:17,862
...if they get stung by an African bee.
And we need it right now.

1102
01:47:18,792 --> 01:47:22,751
I get the picture. First thing tomorrow,
I'll try it on a human.

1103
01:47:23,072 --> 01:47:24,391
Like who?

1104
01:47:24,832 --> 01:47:27,346
- We'll come up with volunteers.
- Like me?

1105
01:47:27,792 --> 01:47:28,842
Forget it.

1106
01:47:29,632 --> 01:47:33,750
It'll take a few days to convince them
how much we need human guinea pigs.

1107
01:47:34,432 --> 01:47:37,344
Meanwhile, I'm here and I'm convinced.

1108
01:47:38,152 --> 01:47:40,905
I'm not ready for you, yet.
When I am, I'll let you know.

1109
01:47:42,352 --> 01:47:43,402
Okay.

1110
01:47:47,272 --> 01:47:50,042
Will you please start eating the food
they serve here?

1111
01:47:50,192 --> 01:47:54,947
It has been measured to ensure you get
energy for the long hours you work.

1112
01:47:55,312 --> 01:47:58,861
What the hell does a man have to do
to get a beer and a pizza around here?

1113
01:48:00,952 --> 01:48:03,864
All a man has to do, Walter, is ask.

1114
01:48:36,232 --> 01:48:39,542
All my notes are right here, Brad,
on the desk next to the recorder.

1115
01:48:40,992 --> 01:48:44,462
They contain the exact instructions,
and I mean exact...

1116
01:48:45,872 --> 01:48:48,222
...on how to prepare
the antidote I've developed.

1117
01:48:49,112 --> 01:48:51,462
Every experiment,
with its individual notes...

1118
01:48:52,152 --> 01:48:55,781
...and conclusions,
is documented in this text.

1119
01:48:58,632 --> 01:49:00,588
I'm going to test the serum on myself.

1120
01:49:02,032 --> 01:49:03,082
Why?

1121
01:49:04,072 --> 01:49:07,189
Because you're fool enough
to make me try it on you.

1122
01:49:07,312 --> 01:49:09,268
It's my antidote, so it'll be my risk.

1123
01:49:10,432 --> 01:49:13,026
First, I'm going to inject myself...

1124
01:49:13,872 --> 01:49:19,071
...with the same input of venom
I'd receive from the stings of six bees.

1125
01:49:19,552 --> 01:49:22,922
That's double the amount anybody
has been able to take and survive.

1126
01:49:24,432 --> 01:49:29,142
Then I'll see if I'll still be able to use
the self-injector with my serum...

1127
01:49:29,912 --> 01:49:32,904
...or whether muscular stiffness
will make it impossible.

1128
01:49:36,712 --> 01:49:39,306
I'll dictate the rest of this
to the other recorder.

1129
01:50:18,032 --> 01:50:19,306
I'm all ready.

1130
01:50:19,912 --> 01:50:22,502
Physiograph is recording,
everything is laid out.

1131
01:50:38,192 --> 01:50:40,103
The weal is rising instantly.

1132
01:50:42,192 --> 01:50:46,310
Now, from the moment of being stung,
a frightened victim...

1133
01:50:46,952 --> 01:50:50,388
...medically inexperienced,
would need about 60 seconds...

1134
01:50:50,472 --> 01:50:54,021
...to get the self-injector
from pocket or purse...

1135
01:50:54,832 --> 01:50:59,701
...pull up a sleeve, waste seconds
hesitating, afraid of the needle.

1136
01:50:59,792 --> 01:51:03,580
Finally, put it in. I'm going to give myself
the same 60 seconds.

1137
01:51:09,952 --> 01:51:11,624
Heartbeat rising rapidly.

1138
01:51:15,592 --> 01:51:17,025
Heartbeat now 140.

1139
01:51:18,712 --> 01:51:20,987
The antidote is on the table in front of me.

1140
01:51:21,992 --> 01:51:24,642
Fifty-five seconds
since I administered the venom.

1141
01:51:26,432 --> 01:51:28,229
I'm gonna start reaching for it.

1142
01:51:31,952 --> 01:51:33,226
It won't move.

1143
01:51:34,072 --> 01:51:36,870
My arm feels like it's strapped to my side.

1144
01:52:17,432 --> 01:52:18,751
Heartbeat...

1145
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:21,392
...160.

1146
01:52:23,072 --> 01:52:24,425
Close to outer limit.

1147
01:52:28,872 --> 01:52:30,225
Dropping now.

1148
01:52:31,152 --> 01:52:32,346
Good.

1149
01:52:33,272 --> 01:52:34,625
Good!

1150
01:52:38,192 --> 01:52:39,420
140.

1151
01:52:41,112 --> 01:52:42,306
130.

1152
01:52:44,192 --> 01:52:45,591
Going to normal.

1153
01:52:47,832 --> 01:52:49,026
120.

1154
01:52:51,512 --> 01:52:52,706
Dropping now.

1155
01:52:53,352 --> 01:52:55,786
Dr. Krim, what are you doing?

1156
01:52:56,912 --> 01:52:58,630
You missed the tough part.

1157
01:53:03,552 --> 01:53:05,190
How much did you take?

1158
01:53:05,272 --> 01:53:09,629
- About six stings' worth.
- Oh, Dr. Krim.

1159
01:53:10,832 --> 01:53:12,663
Respiration still high...

1160
01:53:14,072 --> 01:53:15,471
...but not abnormally so.

1161
01:53:17,992 --> 01:53:19,505
Let's see now.

1162
01:53:21,072 --> 01:53:22,983
I administered the antidote about...

1163
01:53:24,032 --> 01:53:28,628
...66 seconds
after the venom was injected.

1164
01:53:30,992 --> 01:53:32,220
The antidote works.

1165
01:53:33,352 --> 01:53:36,150
- My God. It works.
- Dr. Krim.

1166
01:53:41,472 --> 01:53:43,303
Now here's something.

1167
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:47,302
The four physiological responses...

1168
01:53:48,832 --> 01:53:51,983
...are swinging from norm to some really...

1169
01:53:53,312 --> 01:53:54,711
...spooky levels.

1170
01:53:57,192 --> 01:53:59,183
They don't want to stay down.

1171
01:54:00,992 --> 01:54:04,189
In fact, they're turning bad.

1172
01:54:06,072 --> 01:54:07,790
All of them.

1173
01:54:09,272 --> 01:54:12,105
Heart rate, rising again.

1174
01:54:15,392 --> 01:54:16,541
130.

1175
01:54:17,752 --> 01:54:18,802
140.

1176
01:54:21,072 --> 01:54:22,122
150.

1177
01:54:22,992 --> 01:54:24,186
Oh, my God.

1178
01:54:29,232 --> 01:54:30,665
Losing...

1179
01:54:31,112 --> 01:54:32,465
...respiration.

1180
01:54:35,352 --> 01:54:39,061
First sign, respiratory arrest.

1181
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:29,787
Doctor.

1182
01:56:20,872 --> 01:56:21,922
Walter.

1183
01:56:24,552 --> 01:56:26,429
Oh, Walter.

1184
01:56:52,272 --> 01:56:53,751
There it is.

1185
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:58,700
- I just don't understand your request.
- You will.

1186
01:57:02,232 --> 01:57:06,942
Have you any idea of the consequences
if I ask Washington to shut down?

1187
01:57:07,032 --> 01:57:10,308
- Less disastrous than not shutting down.
- Look at all this.

1188
01:57:11,352 --> 01:57:14,310
Don't you realize we supply power
over a 500-mile area...

1189
01:57:14,392 --> 01:57:17,350
...and purify the drinking water
of 7 million people?

1190
01:57:17,512 --> 01:57:21,346
I realize that. I don't think
you realize how critical this is.

1191
01:57:22,152 --> 01:57:25,224
There's nothing here
that could attract those bees.

1192
01:57:25,312 --> 01:57:28,304
Don't be so sure.
The infrared rays could act like a beacon.

1193
01:57:28,392 --> 01:57:30,189
No, Doctor. See this.

1194
01:57:30,872 --> 01:57:34,945
Billions of dollars have been spent
to make these nuclear plants fail-safe!

1195
01:57:35,192 --> 01:57:38,082
The odds against anything going wrong
are astronomical.

1196
01:57:39,192 --> 01:57:41,422
I appreciate that, but let me ask you...

1197
01:57:41,952 --> 01:57:45,945
...in all your fail-safe techniques,
is there a provision against killer bees?

1198
01:57:50,312 --> 01:57:52,542
Andrews here. Come in, Control.

1199
01:57:56,312 --> 01:57:58,602
Control, this is Andrews.
What's happening?

1200
01:58:07,272 --> 01:58:08,990
Control, go to manual!

1201
01:58:09,392 --> 01:58:13,465
- The bees. Let's get out of here!
- No! This way.

1202
01:59:10,192 --> 01:59:11,261
Crane?

1203
01:59:12,432 --> 01:59:13,626
Crane!

1204
01:59:16,272 --> 01:59:19,702
I've been authorized by the President
to close down your operation.

1205
01:59:21,352 --> 01:59:26,346
From now on, the war against the Africans
will be under military direction...

1206
01:59:27,392 --> 01:59:29,542
...the way it should've been from the first.

1207
01:59:31,192 --> 01:59:33,581
- What's the ETA now?
- General?

1208
01:59:37,552 --> 01:59:41,181
I'll say this for you, Crane, you tried.

1209
01:59:42,632 --> 01:59:47,069
In spite of what you might think,
I kind of hoped you'd pull it off.

1210
01:59:58,752 --> 02:00:03,621
Arrange protective crating for the two
oscilloscopes, I'll fly them to Houston.

1211
02:00:05,352 --> 02:00:09,106
- I'll see you there with the equipment.
- I'll be there.

1212
02:00:13,832 --> 02:00:15,743
I haven't surrendered yet, General.

1213
02:01:48,392 --> 02:01:53,512
...estimating that 600,000 people have
already been evacuated from Houston.

1214
02:01:53,592 --> 02:01:57,710
Elsewhere in the nation,
people stayed indoors or went to church.

1215
02:01:57,792 --> 02:02:00,704
Between their prayers
they watched the weather.

1216
02:02:01,592 --> 02:02:05,551
There was good news for most
of the country other than Texas...

1217
02:02:06,072 --> 02:02:09,144
...temperatures continued plunging
and cold air...

1218
02:02:09,232 --> 02:02:11,905
...coming down with an Alaskan front...

1219
02:02:11,992 --> 02:02:14,711
...is keeping the Africans
confined to Texas.

1220
02:02:16,032 --> 02:02:17,704
This is Frank Blair reporting.

1221
02:02:19,232 --> 02:02:24,227
Who would've thought bees would be
the first alien force to invade America?

1222
02:02:30,824 --> 02:02:35,392
- Where are you going?
- Air Force Headquarters.

1223
02:02:35,393 --> 02:02:36,985
- Go right ahead.
- Thank you.

1224
02:03:25,713 --> 02:03:29,911
Now, without the President's authority,
how can you possibly help?

1225
02:03:32,553 --> 02:03:34,623
The least I can do is try.

1226
02:04:12,233 --> 02:04:13,283
General.

1227
02:04:16,313 --> 02:04:17,382
Hello, Crane.

1228
02:04:18,433 --> 02:04:19,707
- Doctor.
- General.

1229
02:04:20,433 --> 02:04:23,982
I'm really glad you're here for the finale.

1230
02:04:25,313 --> 02:04:27,065
Is there anything I can do to help?

1231
02:04:28,313 --> 02:04:31,111
I'm not sure, but come with me.

1232
02:04:38,433 --> 02:04:41,709
- Very impressive.
- Tomorrow there'll be no more Africans...

1233
02:04:41,833 --> 02:04:45,109
- ... at least not in Houston.
- You've really found a way to stop them?

1234
02:04:45,193 --> 02:04:47,946
I hope so. If we do it here,
we can do it anywhere.

1235
02:04:48,753 --> 02:04:53,508
This is a dress rehearsal, to set procedure
for any future African challenges.

1236
02:04:58,193 --> 02:05:02,903
This is Houston computerized,
and this is Houston.

1237
02:05:03,393 --> 02:05:07,591
You see, the bees have formed
almost a complete circle. Billions of them.

1238
02:05:08,833 --> 02:05:12,621
- That's what we've been waiting for.
- Waiting for what?

1239
02:05:12,993 --> 02:05:16,827
The battle plan is to get them all
into one area and then zap them!

1240
02:05:18,353 --> 02:05:19,672
Take a look over here.

1241
02:05:22,393 --> 02:05:24,111
- Captain. Doctor.
- Major.

1242
02:05:24,193 --> 02:05:28,186
You planned your arrival perfectly.
Here they come.

1243
02:05:35,753 --> 02:05:36,902
Freeze it.

1244
02:05:37,273 --> 02:05:40,470
- Prepare to use the neutracide!
- Neutracide?

1245
02:05:41,193 --> 02:05:44,503
Use that and nothing will grow
there for 10 years!

1246
02:05:44,593 --> 02:05:48,381
Why worry about shaving when someone's
about to cut your head off?. Go!

1247
02:05:49,833 --> 02:05:54,429
Leader One to all aircraft.
Deliver your cargo on target. Now!

1248
02:06:06,793 --> 02:06:10,422
- They're coming through.
- They have learned to live with it.

1249
02:06:11,593 --> 02:06:12,867
I was afraid of this.

1250
02:06:14,273 --> 02:06:16,253
They've become immune to any pesticide.

1251
02:06:33,833 --> 02:06:36,506
The occupation of Houston has begun...

1252
02:06:38,033 --> 02:06:41,389
...and Gen. Slater
is the first officer in history...

1253
02:06:41,473 --> 02:06:44,271
...to get his butt kicked by a mess of bugs!

1254
02:06:51,793 --> 02:06:53,511
You got any of that birdseed left?

1255
02:07:06,233 --> 02:07:11,148
As I said before, they're high in potassium,
low in sodium.

1256
02:07:12,313 --> 02:07:15,464
And as I said before, terrific.

1257
02:07:17,833 --> 02:07:19,710
How long can they live in the city?

1258
02:07:22,433 --> 02:07:26,790
If they get food and water, they might
just decide to stay here forever.

1259
02:07:33,993 --> 02:07:38,669
The Defense Department in Washington
DC has just confirmed the tragic news.

1260
02:07:39,633 --> 02:07:42,784
With the approval of the White House,
and as a last resort...

1261
02:07:43,393 --> 02:07:47,830
...the city of Houston will suffer massive
man-made burning before daybreak.

1262
02:07:48,953 --> 02:07:52,184
This decision was reached
in accord with all opinions...

1263
02:07:52,633 --> 02:07:57,388
...from the armed forces and scientists
involved in the overwhelming...

1264
02:07:57,473 --> 02:08:00,192
...but fruitless countermeasures
being attempted...

1265
02:08:00,273 --> 02:08:04,983
...to destroy the African killer bee which
has brought the Southwest to a standstill.

1266
02:08:06,073 --> 02:08:09,702
The burnout is scheduled
to be handled within minutes.

1267
02:08:10,393 --> 02:08:11,542
Light them up.

1268
02:08:13,753 --> 02:08:15,266
Move out!

1269
02:08:47,953 --> 02:08:49,227
Burn them out!

1270
02:09:02,033 --> 02:09:03,227
Listen to them.

1271
02:09:04,313 --> 02:09:06,110
They're still out there.

1272
02:09:06,873 --> 02:09:10,866
Billions of them. It's as if it's their city.

1273
02:09:12,833 --> 02:09:17,111
Even though Slater's been at it
for 24 hours with every soldier he can get.

1274
02:09:18,273 --> 02:09:21,424
You talk about the bees
as if you admire them.

1275
02:09:21,713 --> 02:09:25,023
I do. They never fail to astonish me.

1276
02:09:26,513 --> 02:09:29,710
It's as though a broad range
of contingencies...

1277
02:09:30,753 --> 02:09:35,224
...has been planned for by the creator
and programmed into them...

1278
02:09:36,473 --> 02:09:38,031
...for an endless future.

1279
02:09:40,553 --> 02:09:44,341
Making them the true inheritors
of the earth.

1280
02:09:45,713 --> 02:09:47,226
A world without people.

1281
02:09:49,393 --> 02:09:52,908
Maybe the creator
was equally obliging toward us...

1282
02:09:53,513 --> 02:09:56,073
...and programmed into us
the ability to beat them.

1283
02:10:00,313 --> 02:10:02,508
I wish he'd give us a clue.

1284
02:10:06,833 --> 02:10:09,222
Here, let me.

1285
02:10:12,233 --> 02:10:13,985
Right there, that's lovely.

1286
02:10:15,713 --> 02:10:17,749
This is better than eight hours of sleep.

1287
02:10:17,833 --> 02:10:20,905
How would you know?
You haven't had that in weeks.

1288
02:10:28,433 --> 02:10:30,105
Listen.

1289
02:10:32,073 --> 02:10:34,029
- What is it?
- The bees.

1290
02:10:35,633 --> 02:10:37,271
Why are they making that sound?

1291
02:10:38,153 --> 02:10:42,066
That's the hunger tone.
It causes them to mass together...

1292
02:10:42,913 --> 02:10:47,384
...as if by community they can destroy
their enemy. Cold, hunger, anything.

1293
02:10:51,593 --> 02:10:56,872
I wonder if there is another sound
that's part of their ritual...

1294
02:10:57,953 --> 02:11:02,071
Helena? Helena, are you all right, love?

1295
02:11:04,233 --> 02:11:06,428
Helena, what's the matter?

1296
02:11:11,353 --> 02:11:12,627
Darling?

1297
02:12:26,713 --> 02:12:28,624
I don't know what else we can do.

1298
02:12:32,593 --> 02:12:34,072
I'm very sorry.

1299
02:12:46,353 --> 02:12:49,504
Please, God, let her live.

1300
02:12:51,873 --> 02:12:56,424
Sir, can we really count
on a scientist who prays?

1301
02:12:57,953 --> 02:13:00,069
I wouldn't count on one who doesn't.

1302
02:13:02,273 --> 02:13:05,310
- You can forget the dossier.
- Yes, sir.

1303
02:13:18,753 --> 02:13:22,587
Street Fighter to Topkick!
Come in Topkick, come in.

1304
02:13:23,753 --> 02:13:27,712
Topkick, can you read me?
You two, come here.

1305
02:13:27,873 --> 02:13:31,468
I can't get through.
Too much interference! Damn bees!

1306
02:13:31,673 --> 02:13:36,701
Listen, get back to headquarters.
Tell Slater we need reinforcements! Go!

1307
02:15:42,193 --> 02:15:43,626
You wonder, don't you?

1308
02:15:45,593 --> 02:15:47,311
Houston on fire.

1309
02:15:49,833 --> 02:15:52,108
Will history blame me or the bees?

1310
02:15:54,833 --> 02:15:58,428
- My compliments, General.
- On what, for God's sake?

1311
02:15:59,273 --> 02:16:03,710
On being able to maintain
a long-term historical perspective.

1312
02:16:04,833 --> 02:16:08,382
Crane, at this point
there's no other viable perspective.

1313
02:16:10,233 --> 02:16:13,031
- Our time is up.
- Not quite, General.

1314
02:16:14,433 --> 02:16:17,789
We're ready with a final experiment.
Please don't give up.

1315
02:16:19,593 --> 02:16:21,868
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1316
02:16:29,993 --> 02:16:35,021
We'll do another half-dozen of these,
get some sleep and start after lunch.

1317
02:16:35,113 --> 02:16:36,432
Okay.

1318
02:16:37,513 --> 02:16:42,268
What's this? We've not heard this before.
Look at this, Doctor.

1319
02:16:43,393 --> 02:16:45,953
Something's coming. Here we go.
We've done it.

1320
02:16:46,033 --> 02:16:47,843
- I don't believe this.
- Yes, we have.

1321
02:16:49,793 --> 02:16:53,149
General, we've done it.
Look, we've got a match.

1322
02:16:53,150 --> 02:16:56,392
Understand? We've discovered
two identical sound patterns.

1323
02:16:56,393 --> 02:16:59,749
No, I don't understand.
What has that to do with killing bees?

1324
02:17:00,113 --> 02:17:04,072
What you are hearing is the African bee's
mating sound. But listen.

1325
02:17:05,233 --> 02:17:10,990
This was made by the alarm system, not
the bees. But they sound exactly alike.

1326
02:17:11,073 --> 02:17:14,304
The alarm system at the missile base
drew them in.

1327
02:17:14,593 --> 02:17:18,268
The similarity confused them.
When it stopped, they left.

1328
02:17:18,513 --> 02:17:19,787
I still don't understand.

1329
02:17:20,713 --> 02:17:24,786
The sonic alarm system happens to be
an exact duplicate of the duet...

1330
02:17:24,873 --> 02:17:28,627
...between the queen bee
and the young queen bee challenging her.

1331
02:17:29,033 --> 02:17:32,503
- But bees can't hear.
- That's right. They go by vibration.

1332
02:17:33,513 --> 02:17:38,109
The alarm felt like the vibration
of a ritual they had to attend.

1333
02:17:38,633 --> 02:17:43,229
Then you're saying our alarm system
attracted the bees into the complex.

1334
02:17:43,793 --> 02:17:46,785
Right. We'll use this very sound
to pull them out of Houston.

1335
02:17:57,233 --> 02:17:58,552
Okay, I'm convinced.

1336
02:18:11,913 --> 02:18:14,825
Kill the bees! Don't hit the man!

1337
02:18:15,953 --> 02:18:17,944
No! Get it up!

1338
02:19:29,033 --> 02:19:31,149
General? General!

1339
02:19:31,393 --> 02:19:34,032
- What is going on?
- The bees are inside!

1340
02:19:36,753 --> 02:19:37,981
Now what?

1341
02:19:39,473 --> 02:19:41,907
- You two get going!
- Not without Helena.

1342
02:19:41,993 --> 02:19:46,032
We'll take care of her. Use that new
weapon you've come up with. Go!

1343
02:19:48,073 --> 02:19:51,190
Slater. Dodge Airfield. Code 7. Fast!

1344
02:19:54,993 --> 02:19:56,346
- General!
- Get out!

1345
02:19:57,313 --> 02:20:00,430
I'm going to get Helena.
If I don't make it, you know what to do!

1346
02:20:23,193 --> 02:20:24,467
Major!

1347
02:20:27,353 --> 02:20:30,584
No time for that! Let's go!
Put this around you. Drop them!

1348
02:20:41,033 --> 02:20:43,024
- Newman!
- Go, Brad! Go!

1349
02:20:43,153 --> 02:20:44,268
Move out!

1350
02:20:47,993 --> 02:20:49,267
General!

1351
02:21:18,433 --> 02:21:21,630
Dr. Crane, this is Dodge Field,
Air Tower Number Two.

1352
02:21:22,193 --> 02:21:24,991
We read Gen. Slater's instructions
loud and clear.

1353
02:21:25,793 --> 02:21:30,913
We're prepared to assist in every
possible way. Come in, Dr. Crane.

1354
02:21:31,713 --> 02:21:34,181
- Do you read me?
- Affirmative.

1355
02:21:34,633 --> 02:21:39,423
Load the choppers with the sound horns.
Spread the oil slick. Acknowledge.

1356
02:21:39,513 --> 02:21:41,583
- Roger.
- Out. Let's go.

1357
02:21:43,953 --> 02:21:48,424
To all Air Force tankers.
Spread your oil over the Gulf of Mexico.

1358
02:21:48,793 --> 02:21:50,112
Four minutes to flaming.

1359
02:22:18,473 --> 02:22:20,031
- Ready when you are.
- Fine.

1360
02:22:20,032 --> 02:22:22,832
- Is this all right here?
- Is there one on the other side?

1361
02:22:22,833 --> 02:22:24,585
- Yes, sir.
- Please hurry!

1362
02:22:26,273 --> 02:22:29,103
Won't the noise of the helicopter
drown out your sound?

1363
02:22:29,113 --> 02:22:31,273
No, it's an entirely different sonic level.

1364
02:22:32,153 --> 02:22:33,203
All set, sir.

1365
02:22:59,953 --> 02:23:02,308
Rescue Five to Alpha One.
Come in, please.

1366
02:23:05,353 --> 02:23:08,584
Ditch sound floats!

1367
02:23:20,233 --> 02:23:22,428
Rescue Five to Alpha Two. Come in.

1368
02:23:32,033 --> 02:23:33,944
Rescue Five to Alpha Three.

1369
02:23:47,073 --> 02:23:50,543
Pilot, get us to the firing point
as quickly as you can.

1370
02:23:53,753 --> 02:23:54,822
Here they come!

1371
02:24:46,924 --> 02:24:52,952
Operation Sonic Drop complete.
All aircraft clear of target.

1372
02:24:52,953 --> 02:24:54,352
Okay. Thank you.

1373
02:24:55,673 --> 02:24:56,947
Fire it now!

1374
02:24:57,033 --> 02:25:00,992
Fire one! Fire two! Fire three!
Fire four! Fire five!

1375
02:25:29,073 --> 02:25:30,631
Did we finally beat them?

1376
02:25:32,033 --> 02:25:34,501
Or is this just a temporary victory?

1377
02:25:36,353 --> 02:25:37,832
I don't know.

1378
02:25:38,433 --> 02:25:44,269
But we did gain time. If we use it wisely
and if we're lucky...

1379
02:25:46,113 --> 02:25:47,785
...the world might just survive.
