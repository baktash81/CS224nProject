1
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,208
Up!

2
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,375
Tommy, take it up!

3
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,750
He's big-dealing the fuck
out of every lift, Bob. You put him in.

4
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:45,083
If every pillar takes four days,
you're looking at a six-month delay.

5
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,291
That's your guy.

6
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,250
You need to calm down, brother.

7
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:51,208
I promised my daughter she'd be
the first one to cross this bridge.

8
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,851
The one
who hasn't even been born yet?

9
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,000
That's the one.

10
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,291
Go up!

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,958
Why are you coming down again?
Get him out, man.

12
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,666
- How is Martha?
- Martha's fine. She's always fine.

13
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,958
- Hey, what time is it?
- Three.

14
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,958
Mark and Wendell are on break.

15
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,041
All right.

16
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,083
Hey, I need you to sign off
on Jimmy's time card tomorrow!

17
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,125
- Tomorrow!
- All right!

18
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,976
- It's low.
- She kicking a lot?

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,291
Is she… Yeah, um…

20
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,708
- Yeah. She's moving around a lot now.
- Top or bottom?

21
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,892
- Sorry?
- Is she mostly at the top or bottom?

22
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:52,958
It's late.

23
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,375
- It's not exactly pleasant.
- You're so lucky.

24
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,083
Aw, that's really nice.

25
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,125
- Yeah.
- Thank you. We'll see how it goes.

26
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,083
Fuck.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,416
First, need you to…

28
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,375
sign right here.

29
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:26,958
Mm-hmm.

30
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,250
Initial.

31
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,666
Date.

32
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,500
You forgot down here.

33
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,541
Initial. Right next to...

34
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,625
If you guys are all set,
I'm gonna take off.

35
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,988
- Bye, sis.
- Thank you.

36
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,517
- Bye.
- See you later.

37
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,958
I love you. See you at home.

38
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,267
- All right.
- Good luck.

39
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,750
And then, for you…

40
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,708
I just need one on the bottom.

41
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,000
And then, you're good.
You got yourselves a car.

42
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,583
- Thank you, Chris.
- Of course. My pleasure.

43
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,416
You're thanking him
for his getting commission.

44
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,166
- Thank me, I'm buying it.
- Thanks, Mom.

45
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,250
Thank you.

46
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,041
Thank you for that.

47
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,625
Congrats. You got a car.

48
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,291
- I'm glad you made it.
- Congrats. All set.

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,875
I've been meaning to ask,

50
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:15,125
how is it you can build a bridge
when you can't tell time?

51
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,166
That's... that's very good.
Oh, that's very funny.

52
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,916
In the back. I had them move it.
So I'll be there in a second.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,392
- Thanks.
- Bye.

54
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:29,083
Just one last thing.
I need your social security right here.

55
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,583
- What do you need my social security for?
- Just like a credit thing.

56
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,184
- She likes you. She just can't show it.
- No, she doesn't.

57
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,833
- She did just buy us a car.
- She did.

58
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,208
But it was also a statement.
She bought the car knowing I could buy it.

59
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,791
She wanted to minimize me.
It's not here. Next room.

60
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,833
That's why she bought a minivan.
She wants to emasculate me.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,333
That's a good horn. Whoo!

62
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,208
The power.

63
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,583
Anita was so jealous.

64
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,333
Oh, my goodness.
Who cares what Anita thinks? Fuck her.

65
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,333
- What does it matter?
- It doesn't matter. It's just…

66
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,666
It doesn't matter at all.
That's what matters. Look at that thing.

67
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,708
Oh, my God!

68
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,750
And she got it gray like her soul.
It's wonderful.

69
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,708
- It's her spirit color.
- Whoa. This is us now.

70
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,875
Yeah, it is.

71
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,958
That's what matters right there.
Cloth seats matter.

72
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,000
- Oh!
- Seat heaters matter, airbags matter.

73
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,291
- I think you're gonna look good in this.
- Oh, yeah, this is it for me.

74
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,791
- Ooh!
- Oh.

75
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,708
- The three of us matter.
- Yeah.

76
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,375
It's the tribe that matters.
Who cares what she thinks?

77
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,375
You know what matters?
This is what matters here.

78
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,041
Yeah.

79
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,833
- Well, I got us something.
- Oh, my God.

80
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,375
That is so cute.

81
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,625
Hey.

82
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,708
Wait, is it…

83
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,833
- Is this the wrong way around?
- It's the right way around.

84
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,250
No, it's upside down.

85
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,083
No, that's how I did it.
It was a choice. That's my daughter.

86
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,875
Wonky, interesting, charming, intelligent.

87
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,833
- Modest.
- Modest, humble.

88
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,958
- Should I call her?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,458
- Do you want some water or something?
- No.

90
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,250
We're moving right along.
Why don't you sit down, baby?

91
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,541
- Yeah, I will after a little.
- Huh?

92
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,083
Sit.

93
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,833
Of course,
now she's not picking up the phone.

94
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,041
Hey, Barbara, hi, it's us again.

95
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,500
So we're having
six-minute contractions now.

96
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,583
It's moving... We're, uh, we're moving.

97
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,083
We're finding our pace, we're getting
a little bit of a rhythm going,

98
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,500
and we feel pretty good.

99
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,458
When?

100
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,083
Oh, really?

101
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,250
Yeah, I mean, it's new,
but, uh… what can you do?

102
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,291
Okay, well, just keep us up to speed.
We're on the phone.

103
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,125
Thank you.

104
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,583
Ah, okay. Remember we went
to the prenatal meetings and they said,

105
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,250
"Listen. We're gonna flip some cards.
Maybe something might not go perfectly,

106
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,000
might not go according to plan,
things might change."

107
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,208
- We're flipping cards.
- In what way?

108
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,833
So, Barbara has…
She's in the middle of a heavy labor.

109
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,166
- She's in a labor?
- Do you remember Eva?

110
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,708
I do, but I'm in my labor...

111
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,666
- We liked her very much...
- Can you call her?

112
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,916
- Eva?
- Yes. I want to talk... No, Barbara.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,625
- I wanna talk to her myself.
- She's in the middle of a labor.

114
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, so am I.

115
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,333
Yeah.

116
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,541
- It's nothing to freak out about.
- I'm not freaking out.

117
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,708
- I just want her here.
- Okay.

118
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,625
Like, how long is it gonna take?
Did she say?

119
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,541
Eva's coming now
and Barbara's gonna come when she can.

120
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,333
I'm not in control.

121
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,458
- I'm just relaying information.
- No. Shh.

122
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,375
She'll be here when she can get here.

123
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,250
That's what I'm saying. Just calm down.

124
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,958
Let's do something else.
How about that? Let's dance.

125
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,726
- Come here.
- I don't wanna dance.

126
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,125
Distract me with something.

127
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,458
Distract you with something?
Like… a joke or something?

128
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,708
Yeah.

129
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,208
A joke about something you like.
What's in the fridge?

130
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,708
Broccoli? Broccoli is in the fridge.

131
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,916
Broccoli's favorite music.
You know what it is?

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,680
You know what
broccoli's favorite music is?

133
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,500
- What is it?
- Brock and roll.

134
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,392
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it fucking is.

135
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,875
- That doesn't go with broccoli at all.
- Where does broccoli go get a drink?

136
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,875
- Where?
- At the salad bar.

137
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,958
Come on, G. Come on!

138
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,208
You're so pathetic.

139
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,958
Aw, wow.

140
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,721
- What's that?
- Okay, okay, okay.

141
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,833
Is that my water?

142
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,041
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

143
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,250
What does that mean?

144
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,375
Where is she?

145
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,458
- Here we go.
- Shit.

146
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,625
Let's get you out.

147
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,875
- Are these wet too?
- No, that's fine.

148
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,601
- Okay.
- Can you call her again?

149
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,083
- Because this is...
- I will.

150
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,083
This is actually hurting now. Oh, God.

151
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,958
Whoo!

152
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,791
Whoa!

153
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,958
Whoo…

154
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,541
Oh, God. Fuck.

155
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,416
Don't look at me like that.

156
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,916
Why don't you come over here?

157
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,666
- Come here, baby.
- Oh, God.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Come here.

159
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,291
Not on that ball.

160
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:24,000
You don't wanna sit on the ball?
That's what they gave it to us for.

161
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,791
- Why don't you do the stretch thing?
- Screw the stretch thing.

162
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,791
- Careful.
- Fuck. I don't really wanna do this.

163
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,500
Why do I feel so sick?

164
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,416
Wanna do it this way?

165
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,666
- What is the move?
- Hmm?

166
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,708
Oh, God. Sorry.

167
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,625
This feels weird.

168
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,083
I need to... Ugh, I feel so nauseous.

169
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,416
- Can you rub my back?
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,958
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,083
Oh, shit.

172
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,208
I might throw up.

173
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,059
You didn't eat enough.
What are you gonna throw up?

174
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,958
I don't know. Sorry.

175
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,125
- You look very handsome.
- Thank you.

176
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,916
You also look super scared.

177
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not.

178
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,500
- Really?
- Really.

179
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,458
- You freaking out?
- Not at all.

180
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,208
Your eyes look super, like

181
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,916
anxious.

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,208
- I'm not.
- Give me a kiss, then.

183
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,416
You want kisses?

184
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,333
Not too much.

185
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,750
That's her.

186
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,458
Look how quick that was.
Look how fast that happened.

187
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,291
- Hey.
- Hi.

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,291
We're six minutes between contractions
and her water just broke.

189
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,500
Oh, wow.

190
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,559
- That's great. How you doing?
- I'm doing all right. How are you?

191
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,958
- Good. Yeah. You talk to Barbara?
- Yes.

192
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,267
- Okay, great. How are you doing?
- I'm good.

193
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,416
- You want some water?
- No, I'm good.

194
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,833
- Is Barbara here? Is she coming?
- You want water?

195
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,625
- Hi. Hi, Martha.
- Hi. Hi.

196
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,833
Sorry, I just feel super sick.
Can you get me some water?

197
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,583
- Okay.
- Thanks. I need it.

198
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,083
How's it going?

199
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:38,166
It's fine. It's just the last two
have been really intense.

200
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,291
Mm-hmm.

201
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,666
- I know...
- Closer together.

202
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,666
They are. Super nauseous.

203
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,333
- That's…
- I haven't really…

204
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,041
- Have you been throwing up?
- No, she didn't eat anything.

205
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,583
Okay. You know…

206
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,958
That's pretty normal, actually.
It's actually kind of a good sign.

207
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,458
- Is it?
- Means it's moving along.

208
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,416
I'm really sweaty. Can you hold me?

209
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,458
Hey.
I know you were expecting Barbara,

210
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,583
and I know it's always
a bit weird when things change,

211
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,791
but I'm so happy to be here, okay?

212
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,041
- I'm gonna stay with you.
- Another one's coming.

213
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,208
Oh, God.

214
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,375
Okay. Okay.

215
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,791
Do I just breathe or what do…

216
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,041
- Remember this?
- Yeah.

217
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,166
Okay. Yeah.

218
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,041
Sweetheart.

219
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,500
What the…

220
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,875
Oh, this is really awful.

221
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,458
You're doing so great. Breathe.

222
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,083
You're doing so great.
You're doing so great.

223
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,086
- You got any painkillers?
- Okay.

224
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,684
See, they come up…

225
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,125
…and then they go down
and you just ride them.

226
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,291
This is awful.

227
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:03,500
I... I just want to have
a quick listen to her heartbeat. Okay?

228
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,916
- And just see how she's tolerating labor.
- Have you got the water?

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,625
Could you maybe
just lie down here for just a second?

230
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,875
- Can you hold my hand or my head?
- Yeah, of course.

231
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,833
Just need to…

232
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,708
- You got the water?
- Yeah.

233
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,125
I'm gonna put this on your belly.
It's a little bit cold, okay?

234
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,208
What's this for?
Oh, for the heartbeat?

235
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,375
Yeah.

236
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,833
Why is this not coming out?

237
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,876
- You gotta squeeze it here.
- Hey. Listen.

238
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,516
Listen.

239
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,583
Are you okay?

240
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,000
- Can you hear that?
- Wow.

241
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,833
- It's really strong. That's great.
- You hear that?

242
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,166
- She sounds really good.
- Hi, baby.

243
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,208
Hi, baby.

244
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,250
Aw. Okay, good. Great. You got it!

245
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,958
- I'm gonna do…
- Did you hear that?

246
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,250
- Yeah.
- Martha.

247
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,125
Martha, I'm gonna get you
to scooch your bum onto this.

248
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,208
I need to do…
Just to see where you're…

249
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,416
Where you're at, okay?
Gonna do a little internal exam.

250
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,041
- To see how dilated you are.
- I like your glasses.

251
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,125
Thank you.

252
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,041
Hmm.

253
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,101
- Those are pretty quick together.
- Regret not having the epidural.

254
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,791
I think that's a bit
closer than six, right?

255
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,017
- Way.
- Okay.

256
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,041
What?

257
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,041
Talking about the time
between contractions.

258
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,166
Okay.

259
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,041
Quicker than six.

260
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,833
Okay, let's move your legs
right like this. Okay.

261
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,583
Okay. Yeah.

262
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,083
Just gonna put my fingers in
and touch your cervix.

263
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,583
Yeah, it can be
a little bit uncomfortable.

264
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,625
Okay. Wow.

265
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,958
You're, like, six centimeters.

266
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,958
And the baby's really low.

267
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,708
She's coming?

268
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,333
- She's coming. It's good.
- So fast.

269
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,500
- It's great. You're doing great. Okay.
- It's just so quick.

270
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,458
You're doing great.

271
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,958
- Okay.
- Yeah. Totally great.

272
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,166
Hey.

273
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,791
- Hi.
- Hmm?

274
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,458
- I feel super sick.
- Yeah.

275
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,625
Ow, ow. Oh… No, no, no…

276
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,041
Okay, listen…

277
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,958
- Just breathe.
- Wait, wait, wait…

278
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,583
Okay.

279
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,041
Oh, my God! Fuck!

280
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,291
Yeah.

281
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,500
- Oh, God!
- It's really happening now.

282
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,333
- Yeah.
- This is so bad.

283
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,916
- Listen.
- This is awful.

284
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,041
Hey, Martha. How do you think
it would feel to be in water?

285
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,958
- I think we need to get her in the bath.
- What the fuck!

286
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,375
- Run a bath?
- Yeah.

287
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,125
- And I'll just stay for a sec.
- Baby, you want a bath?

288
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,750
This is awful. This is so terrible.

289
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,791
- Wanna take a bath?
- Yes, whatever. Yes.

290
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,833
- Okay.
- Oh, God. I'm gonna be sick.

291
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,833
Okay.

292
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,000
Ow!

293
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,916
Okay! You're too out of it.

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,375
I can't do this.

295
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,791
Eva, where's Barbara?

296
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,166
Yeah, you can.

297
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,291
You're nice, but I can't do this.

298
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,500
- You're already doing it.
- Oh, my God. What the fuck?

299
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,208
- I can't do it.
- Hey, you're doing it.

300
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,708
We're gonna get up now.

301
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,666
We're gonna get up
and we're gonna go into the bathroom.

302
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,208
Come on. Come on.

303
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,375
Come on, come on, come on…

304
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,000
There you go.

305
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,458
- I can't.
- Okay.

306
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,541
Put your hands on here.
We're gonna get you up.

307
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,125
- Just have a little walk into the bath.
- One, two, three.

308
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,958
- There we go.
- Okay.

309
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,250
- I can't do this.
- Okay.

310
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,458
- Is my ass out?
- Just drop your weight, baby.

311
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,708
- Okay.
- She's mean.

312
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,083
No, you can walk. Come on. You can walk.

313
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,166
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry. It's embarrassing.

314
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,291
You can walk.

315
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,291
- There you go.
- Did you ever do this before?

316
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,000
I've done this before.

317
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,541
- Oh, God.
- How many kids do you have?

318
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,875
- I have a little girl.
- I'm gonna be sick.

319
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,541
- Little girl?
- I have a girl. I have a daughter.

320
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,416
- Hey.
- God, this hurts.

321
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,208
Have you taken the trash out? 'Cause I can
smell something really strange.

322
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,750
I'll take it out.
Let's just get you in the bathroom, yeah?

323
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,041
- Come here.
- Okay.

324
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,458
Okay. You guys go on
and get in the bath.

325
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,208
I'm gonna set up in the bedroom, okay?

326
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,041
Okay.

327
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,125
It's gonna be all right.

328
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,888
- How you doing?
- We're good.

329
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,833
- Good? Okay.
- Yeah. Babe, lift your arms.

330
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,333
What? I'm trying.

331
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,208
There we go.

332
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,416
Oh, this is super awful.

333
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,833
This is really intense.
I can smell myself. Oh, God!

334
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,351
- The water's good?
- Come on, baby.

335
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,750
Please. Why can't she come out right now?

336
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,958
Hold my hand.

337
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,708
- This is better.
- Right?

338
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,083
- Can you get some music?
- Music?

339
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,375
And also maybe just
shut the lights off.

340
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,458
Yeah.

341
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,875
- I love you.
- Can you give me a kiss?

342
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,625
I love you!

343
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,500
- I love you. Are you okay?
- Yeah. Get the music.

344
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,583
Okay.

345
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,875
Breathe, baby.

346
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:36,958
I'm breathing.

347
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,041
Okay.

348
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,041
This is so bad.

349
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,000
I think I'm gonna shit myself.

350
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,625
Ow!

351
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,791
Hey, that's an interesting noise.

352
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,666
- Hold still.
- Yeah.

353
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,750
God!

354
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:55,083
It's like a pushing kinda noise.
Are you feeling like you wanna push?

355
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,541
- I need to push.
- Okay. Let's get you out of the bath.

356
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,416
Okay.

357
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,833
- Is that blood there?
- Okay, come on.

358
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,958
It's okay. It's just a little bit.
It's totally okay.

359
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,750
Here we go. Come on.
Let's go into the bedroom.

360
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,958
Push now, or…

361
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:19,625
Nope, you can't push now.
You just wait. I need to do a little bit…

362
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,958
I need to check your dilation
before you push, okay?

363
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:25,875
Just…

364
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,250
Yeah. Yeah.

365
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,958
Lift up. There you go.

366
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,583
- Ow, ow.
- Ooh, okay.

367
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,583
Too fat.

368
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,333
Okay.

369
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,541
- Okay, Martha?
- Yeah?

370
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,833
I'm just gonna check your cervix
and see where you're at, okay?

371
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,291
Ow! Ow…

372
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:58,625
I know, I know. Sorry, babe.
I feel the baby's head.

373
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,250
- You do? She's coming!
- I don't feel any cervix.

374
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,500
Come on, baby.

375
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,291
I think you're fully dilated.

376
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,333
- I think you're wide open.
- Easy for you, motherfucker.

377
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,916
- Hey, Martha.
- Yeah?

378
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,625
Now, if you feel like it,
you can push.

379
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,875
When it comes, you can push, okay?

380
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,541
Just give me two secs.

381
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,833
Oh, my God!

382
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,916
Yeah. Yeah? Hey.

383
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,333
Attagirl.

384
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,083
Attagirl. Attagirl.

385
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,250
Oh, it's so good. Okay.

386
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,750
- Good!
- Good. Good.

387
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,125
Okay, okay.

388
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,166
Attagirl. That's great.

389
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,625
Just like that. You're a pro!

390
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:48,833
Doing so great.

391
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:53,791
I'm just gonna have a quick listen
and see how the baby's tolerating…

392
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,958
the labor, okay?

393
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,125
Yeah. Just rest, honey.

394
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,375
- Rest, honey.
- I just wanna…

395
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:15,375
Okay, you know, Martha,
I'm gonna move you onto your side, okay?

396
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,375
'Cause I don't think
the baby likes this position.

397
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,541
- Yeah, just this way, I think.
- Move her on her side?

398
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,375
- Come on.
- Yeah.

399
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:28,166
- - Oh, God! It's... It's coming!
- So, you do the next one from here.

400
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,250
Okay.

401
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,916
Yeah. Attagirl. You push right into me.

402
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:34,708
Yeah.

403
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay.

404
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,833
- Okay.
- Bear down.

405
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:44,541
Good. Good, good, good…

406
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:50,000
Okay. Okay, okay…

407
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,833
Is she here?
Where is she? Where is she?

408
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,375
Okay, let's see.

409
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,250
Now you just rest there a little bit.

410
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:06,416
Heart rate's not coming
all the way back up like we need it to.

411
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,416
What do you mean?

412
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,458
I'm just gonna…

413
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:16,500
- Hold on a second. Wait.
- Baby, no. Where are you going?

414
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,583
The heart rate's not coming up?

415
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:22,333
It's fine. We've had
two consecutive contractions

416
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:25,500
where the heartbeat hasn't come
all the way back up to where I want.

417
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:28,750
But it's not outside the realm of normal.

418
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,553
- What is the realm of normal?
- Just…

419
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,791
- I'm gonna watch over the next few.
- Okay.

420
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:36,000
If it continues like this,
we might have to call in backup.

421
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,208
We might have to transfer.

422
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:39,083
- To the hospital?
- To the hospital.

423
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:42,041
But I'm watching, okay?
You can go back in there with her.

424
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,208
- I'll be right there.
- We're okay, though?

425
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,583
Yeah. We're good. Go on.

426
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:56,333
- Baby? Listen to me.
- Where's my mother?

427
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,125
- Listen to me.
- Yeah, what?

428
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,500
You're doing great.

429
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:03,083
You're pushing great. You're doing a lot.
You've been pushing for a while.

430
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:05,806
We've come a long way. It's not a failure
if we go to the hospital.

431
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:08,375
No, get me the chair.
I'm not going to the hospital.

432
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,767
- If she says...
- You can't decide.

433
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:12,041
- Martha? Hey, Martha.
- I'm gonna do it here.

434
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,833
- She's coming out. Just give me a second.
- Listen. Listen.

435
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,375
You need to get this baby out now.

436
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:21,208
On this contraction. So you push
with everything you've got, okay?

437
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,958
There you go. Okay.

438
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,458
Okay. Come on, I can see her head.
I can see her head.

439
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:31,500
Okay. Keep pushing. Push, push, push.

440
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:32,916
Push!

441
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:35,291
Push, Martha.

442
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,916
- Wait. Please. Come.
- Okay.

443
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,166
Okay. Let's just see how we're doing.

444
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:47,333
Come on.

445
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,583
Okay, you need to call them. Call 911.

446
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:56,041
Tell them we have a home delivery
and the baby's in distress.

447
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,791
- Okay.
- What do you mean?

448
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,208
Martha, we need
to get this baby out now.

449
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:01,416
Where's the phone at?

450
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,708
Okay? We're gonna do it right now.
You get up now.

451
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,791
Hi, I'm at 423 Formosa.

452
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:21,333
I need somebody to send an ambulance
to a house for a home birth.

453
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:25,083
I'm in the middle of a home birth.
I'm at 423 Formosa.

454
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,083
Yes, please. Thank you.

455
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:29,791
- Okay.
- I'm trying!

456
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:33,750
We're gonna push this baby out right now.
Take a deep breath and push.

457
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,083
- Push, baby.
- Push.

458
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:37,083
Push!

459
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,208
Take another breath and keep pushing!

460
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:44,041
Come on! Come on, come on.

461
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,416
- Push, Martha!
- Push!

462
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,791
Hey, no relaxing! Take a breath.
Push. Push this baby out.

463
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,833
- Okay.
- Do it now!

464
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:54,916
Come on!

465
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,875
Come on!

466
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:01,083
Come on, keep pushing! Okay.

467
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,833
There we go!

468
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,791
Okay, here she comes!
Here she comes! Here she comes!

469
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,291
Come on, baby!

470
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,000
Come on! Yeah.

471
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,208
Okay! Okay, okay.

472
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,291
Hi!

473
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,750
Hi, baby.

474
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,791
Good girl. Come on.
How're you doing?

475
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,666
Come on. Let's hear you.

476
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,166
She's so quiet. Oh, my God.

477
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,559
Hold on, you guys. Wait! Wait.

478
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,833
Wait, wait, wait.

479
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,458
Okay. Hey!

480
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:35,791
Okay, she sounds good.
She does. She sounds really good.

481
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:38,041
And the color's good.

482
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,833
Hey! Hi, darling,
you're gonna go see your mama?

483
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,875
She's so perfect.

484
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,416
Okay!

485
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,125
Hi, sweetie!

486
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,916
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

487
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,916
Your eyes are so pretty.

488
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,083
Hi, baby.

489
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:00,916
I know.

490
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,958
I'm just gonna cover her up a bit.

491
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,708
Hi, beautiful.

492
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,726
- You did it.
- She's perfect.

493
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,708
Oh, look it! Oh, look it!

494
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,375
- She's a beauty.
- Oh, my God.

495
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,291
It's all right, sweetie.

496
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,583
She's so calm.

497
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,375
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

498
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,500
You're the most beautiful thing
in the world.

499
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Hi!

500
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,166
Hello. My daughter.

501
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:40,208
I need to take her. She's blue.

502
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:41,500
What?

503
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,767
- Come on.
- What do you mean?

504
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:46,000
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

505
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,083
No!

506
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,208
Come on.

507
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,375
- Come on, baby.
- What do you mean?

508
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,041
Come on.

509
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,625
Okay. Come on, baby. Come on.

510
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,208
Get them in here.
Get them in here right now.

511
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,166
Come on, baby!

512
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,375
Come on, breathe! Come on.

513
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:05,083
Come on, little girl.

514
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,791
We're here!

515
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:10,875
Here!

516
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:13,416
Stop! Hey!

517
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:15,958
Come on!

518
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,541
Hi, I'm sorry. This is my desk.

519
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Oh.

520
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,791
Am I that scary?

521
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,791
No, no, not at all.

522
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:45,541
I just… Just was, uh…

523
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,583
It's just my time off has run out.
So, if you don't mind.

524
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,291
Okay. Oh, God. Gee, yeah.
Leaving right now.

525
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,000
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you.

526
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,625
I'm really sorry about that.

527
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:56,875
Just grab my stuff.

528
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,875
Really sorry again about that.

529
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,875
<i>We don't take the time
to do things anymore.</i>

530
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:12,708
<i>We don't take the time to eat,
to appreciate life.</i>

531
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:16,458
<i>I have a rule that there are
no smartphones near me when I eat.</i>

532
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,743
Martha, is that you?

533
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,416
Don't you recognize me?
I'm a friend of your mom's.

534
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,083
- Oh, yes.
- We play bridge together.

535
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:35,291
- Of course, yes.
- Right. And how... how are you?

536
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,541
- I'm good. Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah.

537
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:41,458
You know,
your mom tells me absolutely everything.

538
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:44,666
I know everything, yeah.

539
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:47,583
Gosh, it's so horrible.

540
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,333
It's all that swindler's fault.

541
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:54,375
She will surely rot in prison. I promise.

542
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,333
There will be consequences.

543
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,166
Nice shirt.

544
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,458
Thank you.

545
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,291
You're welcome.

546
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,000
Put your seat belt on.

547
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,708
- Want some music?
- No.

548
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,250
Penny for your thoughts.

549
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,291
None.

550
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:03,708
Martha, there's something.
I know you're worried.

551
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,833
About this.
Worried what they're gonna find.

552
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,500
- What they're gonna find?
- Yeah.

553
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:15,291
A glass of wine
before we fucked?

554
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,583
Or that I had sushi?

555
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,833
Or do you mean, uh… like your stuff?

556
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:39,708
My stuff.

557
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,041
My… Like my sobriety?

558
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:48,291
Yeah, I mean, well,
it's not even been like, what, like…

559
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,083
- Long time.
- Mm-hmm.

560
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,708
Six years, five months, three days.

561
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:54,916
Four days.

562
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:56,916
Four days.

563
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,934
We don't have theories
regarding the cause of death.

564
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,375
During the criminal autopsy,

565
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:10,041
we ran histology, toxicology
and microbiology screens.

566
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,684
The results of the exam show no signs
of a preexisting infection,

567
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,291
chromosomal abnormality
or irregularity of the placenta.

568
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,875
What we did determine was the little girl
was in a low-oxygen environment.

569
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:22,958
In 60% to 70% of these cases,
we rarely find a satisfactory explanation.

570
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,666
- You're a doctor, yeah? What's your name?
- Dr. Ron.

571
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,958
Dr. Ron. You're a doctor, Dr. Ron.
You're a fucking doctor.

572
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,416
There are certain things,
medically, we just don't have answers for.

573
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,833
There's already proceedings
against the midwife

574
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:39,250
and there will be a medical expert opinion
very soon to determine...

575
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:42,666
What about your medical expert opinion?
You're a medical expert.

576
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,625
I mean, what do you...
You don't know anything.

577
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,083
If it could have been prevented,
who's at fault.

578
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:51,041
You don't know shit is what you're saying.

579
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,184
There are certain questions
I can't answer.

580
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,583
What can you answer at the moment?
Right now?

581
00:38:57,416 --> 00:39:00,458
What is certain is that
the proceedings have begun and there...

582
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:01,583
Fuck!

583
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,250
Uh, sorry.

584
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,375
I'm gonna go outside. Sorry.

585
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,184
<i>These things could take time.</i>

586
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,541
<i>Where is she now?</i>

587
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,250
<i>She's in the morgue.</i>

588
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,833
Is it possible to donate the organs?

589
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:43,041
No. The criminal medical expert
has excluded that.

590
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh.

591
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,250
Some decide to…

592
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,541
offer the body…

593
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:53,083
for medical science
and educational purposes.

594
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,541
Very sorry for your loss.

595
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:00,833
Thank you.

596
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,309
- What do I owe you?
- Twenty-five dollars.

597
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,666
Twenty-five.
There you go. Thank you.

598
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,190
- Thank you.
- Bye.

599
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:55,958
You need to pick
which inscription you like, honey.

600
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:59,500
Your grandmother is resting
in the family grave.

601
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,750
- What's wrong with...
- Did you write that?

602
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,416
Yes.

603
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,041
- You wrote that?
- Yes.

604
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:09,083
That isn't my daughter's name.
It's Yvette.

605
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,000
Starts with a "Y," ends with an "E."

606
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,000
"Yvette."

607
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,083
I'm sorry.

608
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:16,916
Don't blame him. Sean dictated it to him.

609
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,208
Yeah, great-grandmother,
Hungarian spelling.

610
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,333
So it's not at the end
of the name list forever.

611
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:23,096
That doesn't make
any sense at all

612
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,000
because name lists are by last name.

613
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,666
And we chose
the American spelling for you.

614
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,791
Yeah,
but it's a small detail, Martha.

615
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,166
- Small detail.
- Yeah.

616
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,375
Yeah.

617
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:40,416
Yeah, you're right.

618
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,666
No, it is a small detail.

619
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,833
Small detail. 'Cause there's not…
There's not gonna be a funeral anyway…

620
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:50,791
- There's not gonna be a funeral.
- I didn't mean it like that.

621
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,035
- Not gonna be a gravestone.
- Martha? I'll change the spelling.

622
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:57,458
- Can you at least pick which style?
- It's all one big waste of time.

623
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,458
What?

624
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,208
Martha.

625
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:03,750
Martha!

626
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:05,958
- Can you just pick a style today?
- Martha!

627
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:08,208
There's really no point.
I'm gonna donate her body

628
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,750
to the university, so…

629
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:10,916
This is just like…

630
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,458
Martha!

631
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,458
Complete waste of time.

632
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,125
Martha! Come on!

633
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,125
Oh.

634
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,458
Can I have one?

635
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,625
Please, go ahead.

636
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:30,916
Just… keep the order
and we'll make a few small changes

637
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,125
and I'll pay for it.

638
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:33,708
No, I'd like to pay for it.

639
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,291
I'd like to pay for it.

640
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:38,750
Thank you.

641
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:40,958
There's some stuff I can pay for.

642
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:50,000
Sean, don't smoke it.
You'll relapse.

643
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,458
- Sean, where are you going?
- Five minutes.

644
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,750
Fuck.

645
00:42:58,875 --> 00:42:59,875
Sean.

646
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:09,791
She needs help.

647
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,833
She doesn't know what she's doing.

648
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:15,125
I mean, she's just
piling mistake upon mistake.

649
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:20,541
That's why it's our job
to show her what's right.

650
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,750
What does that mean?

651
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,791
You know Suzanne, right? Her cousin?

652
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,041
- No.
- No?

653
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:31,166
Well, she's just a remarkable girl.

654
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,666
She has a beautiful office downtown.

655
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:39,500
She said that she will take on
and handle a civil suit for us,

656
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,291
if I put all
the documentation in her hands.

657
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:46,208
- You want me to give you the paperwork.
- Exactly.

658
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,291
Mm.

659
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,541
Yeah, I gotta talk
to Martha about that first.

660
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,125
Really?

661
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,125
My... Don't you want someone
to answer for this monstrosity?

662
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:02,166
Martha can't sort through all of this now.

663
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,583
That's why I thought

664
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:08,666
maybe you might take
a little responsibility for a change.

665
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:10,875
Well, really.

666
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:16,458
Yeah, I'd like to hand it
to her myself, if you don't mind.

667
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:18,625
When?

668
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,333
Soon.

669
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,458
Well, you better.

670
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,833
Let me out at the next corner.
I wanna walk the rest of the way.

671
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,916
You don't want me to take you to the door?

672
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:36,333
No, I feel like I need a little air.

673
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:27,916
Hi.

674
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:30,625
Hey.

675
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:41,875
Are you smoking?

676
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:42,958
Sorry.

677
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:02,458
- Good day?
- Yeah.

678
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:05,541
- You?
- Yeah, it was good.

679
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,875
We should talk
about a civil case, Martha.

680
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:18,916
We gotta finish this.

681
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You know, I've come back
from death before. Dark, cold.

682
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:23,458
Really dark, really cold.

683
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:27,416
And now she's in the dark and the cold
and I can't do anything about it.

684
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,333
My hands are sort of tied here.

685
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:31,541
Please, Martha.

686
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,083
I'm not your mother.

687
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:58,166
I'm your partner, yeah?
It's a team thing.

688
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,875
Can we please talk, Martha?

689
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:04,625
Martha?

690
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,708
Please come out.

691
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,500
I miss her.

692
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,958
I miss her. Please, Martha.

693
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:42,458
I'm sorry. I just need you
to promise me you won't…

694
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,250
You can't send her anywhere.

695
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:50,833
Please.

696
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:55,666
Promise me.

697
00:47:58,666 --> 00:47:59,666
I promise.

698
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:05,000
Sean told me
I might find you here.

699
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:06,583
He's beside himself.

700
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,875
You two best friends now?

701
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:12,041
Well, there are things
we agree on.

702
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,625
Does he have a choice in that?

703
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,625
Martha, wait a minute. Martha, please.

704
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:21,083
I'm not trying to change your mind.
I know I can't do that.

705
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:26,083
I understand that you made up your mind
to give your baby for medical research.

706
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:31,500
The only thing I'm asking of you
is that when it's all over…

707
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:34,583
that we get her back so we can bury her.

708
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:39,041
That's all.
That's the right thing to do, honey.

709
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,875
Because you say it is? Yeah.

710
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:45,916
Do you really wanna put
your little baby's body on a mass grave

711
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,458
like an animal?

712
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:49,083
Oh, my God.

713
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:50,625
That's funny to you?

714
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:52,875
Yeah. So cheap.

715
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:56,750
- Martha.
- Mm-hmm.

716
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:23,833
Thank you for waiting.

717
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Okay.

718
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,708
There you go. Sign here.

719
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yep.

720
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,416
And a signature here as well.

721
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:46,125
There's one more at the bottom as well.

722
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,458
Hello. Looking for Suzanne Weiss.

723
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:30,458
Yes,
go straight down to your left.

724
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:31,541
Thank you.

725
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,083
- And who's this?
- Your 5:30.

726
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:46,416
Oh. Hey.

727
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,875
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

728
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:48,958
I'm Sean.

729
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:52,791
- Yeah, Carson, right?
- Carson, yeah. Elizabeth.

730
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:53,958
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

731
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,416
Uh, you wanna come in?

732
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,000
- Yeah.
- Okay.

733
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:01,458
- Am I catching you at a good time?
- Huh?

734
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,166
Oh. I forgot my paperwork.
I'll be right back.

735
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:12,791
- Yeah, you know, we're related.
- Yeah, I guess we are.

736
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:13,958
Strange.

737
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:05,333
Why are you trying
to disappear my kid?

738
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:09,166
We don't need this room, so…

739
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,416
Because we don't have a kid.

740
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:18,166
- Why are you being so cold to me?
- Cold?

741
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,250
Yeah.

742
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,750
I'm cold?

743
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,125
- You're cold.
- Right.

744
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:25,416
Well…

745
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:29,333
you're the one teaming up
with my mother behind my back, so…

746
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:49,000
Can you please leave that alone?

747
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:53,000
- Martha, I wanna put it back up.
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,583
Can you give me the picture?

749
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:01,125
Stop it.

750
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:06,458
Fuck.

751
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,208
How's your hand?

752
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,500
You don't want this apple?

753
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:45,416
Huh?

754
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,541
It's brown.

755
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:49,750
- Yeah, I don't want it.
- Okay.

756
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:57,291
What are you thinking about?

757
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,375
Huh?

758
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:01,041
Penny for your thoughts.

759
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,598
I'm just thinking about my hand.

760
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:07,083
- How is it?
- Fine.

761
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:12,166
Yeah, I'm thinking about going
to Seattle for a little while.

762
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:14,958
- Seattle?
- Yeah.

763
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:18,625
Like a road trip.
You could come with me. We could...

764
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,500
- We could road trip.
- Mm.

765
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:26,291
We could get a cheap little...
a little beater on some land,

766
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:29,375
and I got friends out there
that'd help me renovate.

767
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:31,750
It'd be good for us, Martha.

768
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,000
It'd be so good for us. Good for you,
good for me, good change of scenery.

769
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:37,125
I mean…

770
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,125
Mm…

771
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,208
Come on, let's go.

772
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,125
I think we should go.

773
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:58,750
I miss you.

774
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:08,500
- Touch me.
- Come on!

775
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:11,416
- Touch me.
- Sean. Ow!

776
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,541
I miss you.

777
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,041
It's okay.

778
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,541
Touch me.

779
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:38,833
Touch me. Touch me.

780
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:46,166
Okay…

781
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,333
Take this off.

782
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,708
The clip at the back.

783
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:14,916
Sean! Don't rip it like that. Just…

784
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,750
- Take it off.
- You're gonna…

785
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:30,291
Sean. Would you just let me take them…

786
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,375
Let me take them off!

787
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:34,208
- Come here.
- Come on!

788
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:35,291
Stop it!

789
00:58:38,541 --> 00:58:39,625
Listen to me.

790
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,958
I'll take them off
if you just give me a second.

791
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:44,958
Fuck, man!

792
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:49,750
Here. Sorry. Let me just… One second.

793
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,791
Fuck it. I don't want to now.

794
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:17,958
Hey, Chris. Hey, man. Um…

795
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:19,666
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

796
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,833
Yeah, it's all right… No, wait…

797
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:24,583
I literally have no idea.
I can't even imagine what's...

798
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,458
Yeah. Hey, I need you to...

799
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,000
I need you to switch the car out for me.
And give me the money for the car.

800
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,708
And then you sell it after.

801
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:35,500
- Yeah?
- I can help you sell it.

802
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:37,291
It'll take a couple of months, but…

803
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,666
No, I need it now.
I'm sort of underwater now.

804
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:40,916
My hands are tied.

805
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,250
As soon as that car goes out,
I can't do anything.

806
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:47,041
But I haven't driven it for six months.
It's just sort of the same car.

807
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:49,333
- I get it…
- Chris, I need it.

808
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:51,625
My boss totally... Okay.

809
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,500
I need you to do it now, man.

810
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,000
- All right.
- Sorry.

811
01:00:55,791 --> 01:01:00,166
Well, there is...
I could make it if it...

812
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:02,500
Is the car dangerous?

813
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:05,625
Is there... Is it... Is there a problem...

814
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:08,108
- If the car's dangerous...
- Then I can take it back.

815
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:09,526
How do we make that happen?

816
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,333
If there was an accident,
I can figure out a way to make it work.

817
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:13,666
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

818
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,375
Looking for something
about sprouting?

819
01:01:58,458 --> 01:01:59,291
Mm-hmm.

820
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,083
I've got a better book than that.

821
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:09,083
Try this.

822
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,125
No, this one. Yeah.

823
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:24,666
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

824
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:09,291
Hi.

825
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:12,416
We've gotta talk
about Mom's condition.

826
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,708
She's aged five years in three months.
She almost burned the house down.

827
01:04:15,791 --> 01:04:16,791
Is it my fault?

828
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,875
It doesn't help
that you don't answer the phone

829
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,791
when she calls to say
the house is on fire.

830
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:23,583
So she sent you to meet me, right?

831
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:26,916
I don't know why you guys
do this through me.

832
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,916
Every time she calls, I'm in a meeting...

833
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
- I thought you quit.
- What?

834
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:33,708
- Chris said you quit.
- I haven't spoken to Chris.

835
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,208
Sean spoke to Chris
when he returned the car.

836
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:37,291
What?

837
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,083
Um…

838
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,708
This is yours. And…

839
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:45,866
- That's not mine.
- It was in the car.

840
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,041
Also found a roll of film.

841
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:50,875
- I got these printed for you.
- Oh.

842
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,916
I've gotta go. I got a work thing. Bye.

843
01:04:55,416 --> 01:04:57,208
- I love you.
- Love you.

844
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,708
You know, I wouldn't worry about it.

845
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:29,833
People wanna kill this woman.
With the mistake she's made,

846
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:32,541
the case is practically won
with two to eight years imprisonment.

847
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:37,416
The gross negligence on not calling
an ambulance in time to a dying baby

848
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,291
should be enough to put her away.

849
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:40,375
All right.

850
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,041
And as your criminal lawyer,
with your testimony,

851
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,958
we have this case in the bag.

852
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:49,333
If you guys decide to slap her
with a civil case as well,

853
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:52,125
I can get someone to handle that,
someone that I trust.

854
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:54,875
I feel like you got
a good shot at winning both.

855
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:57,583
And you could win millions.

856
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:03,708
You know about this bridge?

857
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:06,208
Huh?

858
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:08,875
This bridge you got on the wall.

859
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,250
- No.
- There's a big story behind this bridge.

860
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:13,750
Uh-huh.

861
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:17,125
In the '40s, this thing
just disintegrates into the floor.

862
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:20,166
It's a big deal.
It's the third biggest bridge in the US.

863
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,291
You got the Golden Gate, George Washington
and then you got the Tacoma.

864
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:27,333
In the '40s, things collapse
and they can't figure it out

865
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:28,791
and they bring in these experts.

866
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:31,500
Mathematicians, scientists,
nobody could figure it out.

867
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:34,375
Took a look at foundations,
suspension wire, nothing.

868
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:35,666
Everything checks out.

869
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:39,208
Then finally,
one of these scientists says "resonance."

870
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:40,375
What?

871
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,601
Resonance. You know what that is?

872
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:44,875
- No.
- Resonance is, um…

873
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:48,333
You know, every solid object
has its own vibration.

874
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:53,041
When the outer one matches
the inner one, you get resonance.

875
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:58,875
Sometimes, resonance can be so powerful,
it can bring a whole bridge down.

876
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:06,333
- Does it happen often?
- No, like, um…

877
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:09,166
Like when swings move
by themselves at the playground?

878
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:11,666
That's resonance. Thank you.

879
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:15,375
For everything.

880
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,875
- Here to help.
- Yeah.

Yeah, I'll call us a cab.

899
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:38,125
- I'll call us a cab right now.
- No, I need to go. I'm sorry.

900
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,041
Shit. Piece of shit.

901
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:15,416
Hi, can I go to Christie Street, please?
Now. Like, right now. Thank you.

902
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:20,750
You have a good party?

903
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:23,625
- Yeah, it was.
- Yeah?

904
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,416
Where were you?

905
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:45,833
- You've been drilling?
- Yeah.

906
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:48,541
I talked to Robert
and he hasn't seen you in three weeks.

907
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:50,291
So, drilling what?

908
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:53,875
You don't have to lie to me.

909
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:55,875
Hmm?

910
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:03,541
You lied to me.

911
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:06,125
You're a fucking liar.

912
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,208
Fucking bitch.

913
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:12,791
You're a fucking bitch, and you're a liar.

914
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:16,916
You're a cheap-ass liar.
You're a fucking clown.

915
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,958
You're a clown.
You're a clown and you're a liar, bitch.

916
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,208
- Hey!
- Sorry.

917
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:36,583
- What the fuck, Chris?
- Sorry about that.

918
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:41,875
- You forgot me?
- Sorry. It's slippery, watch out.

919
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:48,791
Just, like, excited
to get into my mom's house?

920
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:54,541
You were, like, running in. Okay.

921
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:08,083
Is that my cousin?

922
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:10,375
Oh, no way.

923
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:12,291
- Hi.
- Hey.

924
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:15,059
- What are you doing here?
- It's like a million years.

925
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:16,625
- Hey. Yeah.
- Incredible.

926
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:18,916
Your mom asked me to... Come on in.

927
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:22,416
- Uh, she's in the kitchen.
- All right.

928
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:26,083
Hello. Oh, wow, yes. Duck.

929
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:27,416
- Yeah.
- Looks amazing.

930
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,625
Wow! Uh, you want me to baste?

931
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:32,416
- Oh, are you good at basting?
- Yeah, I can baste.

932
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,791
- Here. Thank you.
- Thanks. I'll use this one.

933
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:36,583
Need help with the salad at all?

934
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:38,208
Yeah, that would be great.

935
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:41,583
- Make your salad. Don't eat it. Make it.
- Okay. It's fresh, though.

936
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,250
Yes, it is fresh.

937
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:46,083
You chop these?
Thick? Thin? Any preference?

938
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:47,666
- Uh, not too thick.
- Okay.

939
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,041
But not too thin.

940
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:50,125
Hi, honey.

941
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:53,291
- How you doing?
- Good. Where's Martha?

942
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:56,916
Um, she'll be along.

943
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:58,958
Alone?

944
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,083
I don't know.

945
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:02,875
Back in?

946
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:04,791
Are you done already?

947
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:09,833
- Good.
- You planning something?

948
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,833
What? No, nothing.

949
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,875
- You're planning something.
- What?

950
01:14:14,958 --> 01:14:16,416
You're planning something.

951
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:22,000
Oh, I invited Suzanne over,
just for some legal advice.

952
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,416
For what?

953
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,666
- Oh, you found my keys!
- Guess so.

954
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,500
It was just in the bowl, which is funny.

955
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:32,750
Anything else?

956
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:36,708
- Um… No, not right now.
- You okay?

957
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:39,101
- Yeah?
- You need a drink?

958
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:40,333
Cup of tea? Here.

959
01:14:40,416 --> 01:14:42,250
No, I'm good, thank you.

960
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:54,625
- There she is. Liz.
- No, don't call me that.

961
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:57,208
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hello, darling.

962
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:59,791
- 'Sup? Hey.
- These are for you.

963
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:02,083
- It's a sun rose, I think.
- How beautiful.

964
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:03,750
- Chrysanthemums!
- Oh.

965
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,083
I got you this, it's a…

966
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,200
- This is for me?
- It lights up, they said.

967
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:10,809
- How can I help?
- Oh, wonderful.

968
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:11,892
- Whoa!
- Oh.

969
01:15:11,916 --> 01:15:13,750
Hey, watch the foot, man.

970
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:14,708
Oh.

971
01:15:14,791 --> 01:15:15,951
When did that happen?

972
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,083
Probably just now walking in.
I'll clean.

973
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:19,666
He stepped in his own shit?

974
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,291
Come in the living room.
Doesn't it look nice?

975
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:23,541
- Hi.
- Hi.

976
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:26,392
- Yeah, looks nice. Hi.
- How you doing?

977
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:28,083
Nice to see you. You too, Chris.

978
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:31,041
- I've been staging.
- Looks great.

979
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:33,500
- Do you know what that is?
- Not really, no.

980
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:39,333
Okay. I'm gonna demonstrate.
So, you see this chair all by itself?

981
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:43,166
- Yeah.
- It looks kinda lonely and sad, right?

982
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:48,083
So then, I find
a colorful and cheerful cushion.

983
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:51,458
Put it there.
And right away, you see, instant beauty.

984
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,000
Yeah. You wanna sit down?

985
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,767
- You see it?
- Yeah. Wanna sit down?

986
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:57,583
I've been staging all over town.

987
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:01,958
Not for money. Just like a hobby.
You know, for my friends.

988
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:06,083
- Why don't I go set the table?
- Okay.

989
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:11,541
- So…
- Martha?

990
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:15,958
- Do you wanna borrow a brush?
- A brush? No.

991
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:20,375
No? Okay. And your outfit's adorable.

992
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:23,583
Not as dressy
as I thought you'd be for the occasion.

993
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,541
Occasion?

994
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:29,543
- Chris, you got a drink?
- I'm gonna put this in water.

995
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:31,291
Uh…

996
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:33,833
- Make a little toast.
- All right.

997
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:35,596
- To you guys.
- A toast?

998
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:39,583
To getting out of the house.

999
01:16:39,666 --> 01:16:41,583
- Making yourselves…
- I know. Cheers.

1000
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,666
- Put yourself out there. Feel better.
- Sean.

1001
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,000
Hey. Yeah, Suzanne.

1002
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,083
- Cousin?
- Uh-huh.

1003
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:48,791
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

1004
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:53,041
The other day, the uh, the guy
at the church was saying something…

1005
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:55,625
- The guy? The pastor?
- The pastor.

1006
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:58,250
He was doing, like, a sermon.

1007
01:16:58,333 --> 01:16:59,500
And he said, uh…

1008
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:02,833
something pretty deep.

1009
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:04,876
- He said, "Time heals all wounds."
- Whoa.

1010
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:06,000
And I was like, "Yeah."

1011
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:08,958
"That's pretty good."

1012
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,392
What are you doing with your time?
You still playing?

1013
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:16,750
Uh, no, it's been a while.
Uh, I'm just working.

1014
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:19,875
The only type of playing I do
is if they pay me over there, so…

1015
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:21,434
- At the church?
- Yep.

1016
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:23,625
Well, that's exciting.

1017
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:26,541
- Different scene, that's for sure.
- Different scene.

1018
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:27,541
Worshipers.

1019
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:30,833
Yeah. Oh, you get that.
Better than a groupie.

1020
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,333
- Kinda the same thing.
- That's true.

1021
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:35,476
- It was a good band, man.
- Thank you.

1022
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,833
Good time to be in a band.

1023
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:37,750
It was.

1024
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:40,142
- That whole grunge revival scene.
- Oh, man.

1025
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:42,666
It's crazy. When you had
the White Stripes, right?

1026
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,642
- Stripes were there. Who else?
- Mm-hmm. They had the Hives.

1027
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:48,000
Hives, Strokes, Beck.

1028
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:51,333
Nah, Beck is different. He's softer.
You guys had a grit. Harder.

1029
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,016
Um, what was it the Stripes did?

1030
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:55,226
- You need help?
- Stripes were like, um…

1031
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:56,125
Huh?

1032
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:58,916
- Help?
- No. I just had another glass.

1033
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,375
What was it? They were brother...

1034
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:03,666
They were husband... They were brother...

1035
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,041
They were pretending
to be brother and sister,

1036
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,333
or to be husband and wife.

1037
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,642
- Stripes?
- Stripes, yes.

1038
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:09,786
There was this thing.

1039
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:10,750
- Who are they?
- Smart.

1040
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:12,750
- The White Stripes?
- Are they a band?

1041
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:13,750
You're funny.

1042
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:16,166
- You don't know the White Stripes?
- No.

1043
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,559
- Really?
- This is…

1044
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,958
- No. The White Stripes?
- This is insane.

1045
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:23,000
Come on, 2001, 2002,
were you living under a rock?

1046
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:25,791
They did a Coke commercial.
"Seven Nation Army."

1047
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,916
- That fucking song, boy.
- Yeah.

1048
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,541
- Yeah, I know that song.
- Yeah.

1049
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,434
- They play it at the...
- Yes.

1050
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:39,916
So, the story with them goes,
there's a two-person band.

1051
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,958
- Uh-huh.
- Boy and a girl. Boy's name is Jack White.

1052
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:44,833
- Girl's name is, uh…
- Meg.

1053
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:49,000
Meg. And they're in a band,
but their band is, uh…

1054
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,875
They're in a marriage…

1055
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:53,838
They're in a marriage, they're telling
people they're brother and sister.

1056
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:57,125
They're actually married,
falling apart in front of the world.

1057
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:58,666
So, like Sonny and Cher.

1058
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:02,458
It's like, you look at them,
and everybody's like, "Oh, my God."

1059
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:05,000
"Are they fighting?"
They're not listening to the music.

1060
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:06,767
- You're into the gossip.
- Exactly.

1061
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:07,833
Not into the music.

1062
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:09,625
If you're watching a couple play music,

1063
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:12,750
you're not thinking, "What's up
with the song, this instrumentation?"

1064
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:16,208
You're thinking, "Are they fucking?
Where'd they meet? Do they got kids?"

1065
01:19:16,291 --> 01:19:17,541
It's terrible.

1066
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:20,125
You look at Donny and Marie. Opposite.

1067
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:23,708
Yeah, but their music sucked,
so you didn't care either way.

1068
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:26,151
But you didn't wanna think
about anything happening.

1069
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:28,458
It's true. If they sucked
and they were brother...

1070
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:30,083
Yes, so my point.

1071
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,666
Hey, so what happened with your band?

1072
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,583
Uh, I don't know. So stupid.

1073
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:35,916
Everybody kind of grew up and moved on.

1074
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:39,583
To different bands
or different sounds?

1075
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:40,791
No. It's just…

1076
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:45,208
It's like, "Okay. Great. You go be a dad.
You don't have time for this."

1077
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:47,651
- Looking at me like I'm a child.
- Rest of the band?

1078
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:52,041
Yeah. I mean, the way
he talked to me, I didn't like that.

1079
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,525
Well, he was older than you.

1080
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:55,750
Yeah, but it was
just so condescending.

1081
01:19:55,833 --> 01:20:00,041
Like, "I'm so much better than you
because I have kids."

1082
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:01,750
Yeah, that wouldn't be right.

1083
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:03,875
Right.
It's like, "What does it matter?"

1084
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:07,375
- It doesn't change your life.
- No, to go do that.

1085
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:10,166
When you're young like that,
on the verge of breaking through.

1086
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,559
- No. Makes total sense.
- What's that tone?

1087
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:13,416
I don't understand.

1088
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,017
- What's going on?
- What tone?

1089
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:17,875
- Martha, we're just talking.
- What? I was agreeing with him.

1090
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:21,125
Yeah, we're agreeing also.
Everybody's agreeing.

1091
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:23,333
- So what's the problem?
- The problem?

1092
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:25,375
Don't give him a hard time.
We're just talking.

1093
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:27,458
We're just trying to keep it light.

1094
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:32,416
Right. Light.

1095
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,000
Yes. I am…

1096
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:35,666
Okay, okay, okay.

1097
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:39,000
I am sorry. I did not put that together.

1098
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,666
- "Baby," I didn't know.
- Oh, my God.

1099
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,000
What are we even doing here?
This is completely nuts. What the fuck?

1100
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:47,166
Well,
as long as you're asking.

1101
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,083
Um,

1102
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:56,166
Suzanne... I've consulted
with her about the...

1103
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,810
- About what?
- About the case.

1104
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:01,166
You're the prosecutor
on the case?

1105
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:05,166
- Yeah.
- Yes. She's an excellent lawyer.

1106
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,000
And she's family, you know?

1107
01:21:08,083 --> 01:21:13,000
She loves us. She's here
to make sure we get the right thing.

1108
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:16,500
Look, the case is already won.
People hate this woman. So, I'll just…

1109
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:21,125
Yes, exactly.
And I don't want them to judge you.

1110
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:23,500
- "Them"?
- The people.

1111
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:27,583
"People."
By "people," you mean Judith?

1112
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:29,625
- I really...
- Fuck off, Chris.

1113
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:32,375
If you're talking about her,
I went to a store to get an apple.

1114
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:34,138
Twenty minutes later,
I'm in the same store

1115
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:35,458
getting the same apple.

1116
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:39,000
I know because I met him late.
How late, 25 minutes?

1117
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:41,458
I spent a minute getting an apple.

1118
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:45,375
The rest of the time, I spent there stuck,
stranded, getting grilled by your friend,

1119
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:48,083
trying to figure out
what the fuck she wants from me.

1120
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:51,208
And you're worried about them judging me?

1121
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:52,166
Martha.

1122
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,625
It's not even about
them judging me, actually.

1123
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,125
It's about how you want me to be
to fit their opinion.

1124
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:58,458
You wanna arrange me.

1125
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:01,333
- You need therapy!
- I do not need therapy. Thank you, Anita.

1126
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,041
- You do. Asshole.
- All right.

1127
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:06,416
Who cares about what they think?
This is about me. This is about my body.

1128
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,250
This is me. Do you understand that?

1129
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:10,166
Yes, I understand that, dear.

1130
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,166
But have you decided to go to the trial?

1131
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:17,250
- I'm not going to your fucking trial.
- Why not, honey?

1132
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:20,708
She has to pay for her incompetence.

1133
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:22,458
- Is this about money?
- No!

1134
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:25,666
Is it about what people think?

1135
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,041
It's about you.

1136
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:30,291
It's about you having to face this thing...

1137
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:34,750
I am facing this!
I am facing it! I am facing this!

1138
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:36,750
Well, I don't think you are.

1139
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:40,333
We need... we need some justice here.

1140
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:45,291
No, <i>you</i> need. That is what <i>you</i> want.
That is what <i>you</i> need. That is <i>your</i> way!

1141
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:48,250
That is not my way!
That is what <i>you</i> need!

1142
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:51,875
Martha,
if you had done it my way,

1143
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:56,041
you'd be holding your baby
in your arms right now.

1144
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:07,958
You know what? You...

1145
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,083
You're ashamed.

1146
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:12,958
You're so ashamed of me.

1147
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:16,166
You're ashamed because I failed.
"Oh, what a disgrace!"

1148
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,916
"What a disgrace!"

1149
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,166
I failed!

1150
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,250
- Yes.
- You're fucking ashamed.

1151
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,083
And I'm ashamed of me.

1152
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,875
That I wasn't a good enough mother

1153
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:30,375
to teach you how to stand up
and speak for yourself, for God's sakes.

1154
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:34,000
And to deal with this.
Like my mother taught me.

1155
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:41,125
After my father went into the ghetto,
my mother found a shack, an empty shack,

1156
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:43,833
that she went into and gave birth to me.

1157
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,583
Without any help at all.

1158
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:54,166
She stashed me under the floorboards
when she had to go out and steal food

1159
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:57,833
so she could make milk
enough to keep me alive,

1160
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,791
but just alive.

1161
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:03,666
Not strong enough to cry,
or we'd be caught.

1162
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:11,916
When she finally got me to a doctor,
he advised her to just let me go.

1163
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
That I wasn't…

1164
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,291
I wasn't strong enough to survive.

1165
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,750
But when she absolutely insisted,

1166
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:27,583
he picked me up by my feet
and held me up like a chicken and said,

1167
01:24:27,666 --> 01:24:30,125
"If she tries to lift her head,

1168
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:33,583
then there's hope."

1169
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:37,125
And you know what I did, Martha?

1170
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,458
I lifted my head.

1171
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:43,791
That's what I'm asking you to do now.

1172
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:47,333
Lift your head and fight for yourself,
for God's sakes!

1173
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:49,791
Go out there and face that woman.

1174
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:53,833
Tell her what it's like for you now,
what this feels like.

1175
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:58,541
You have to do this, Martha.
You have to speak your truth.

1176
01:24:58,625 --> 01:25:01,416
Otherwise, you're never gonna
be able to deal with this.

1177
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:04,625
You're never gonna be able to move on.

1178
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:07,416
You've got to move on past this, Martha.

1179
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:10,041
Stop it. Stop it.

1180
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:51,375
Maybe I'll go make some tea.
I know my dad always makes tea when...

1181
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:53,708
When his daughters loathe him?

1182
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:01,625
I think Martha's starting over.

1183
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:04,250
Good. I'm sorry. I...

1184
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:06,958
I never liked you.

1185
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:11,583
- And it's not because you're poor.
- No, it's 'cause I'm, um...

1186
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:19,208
'Cause I'm not an intellectual,
and I'm not... I don't use big words.

1187
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:21,958
And 'cause I'm rough and I'm...

1188
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:25,125
Well, here's a Scrabbleword.
'Cause I'm boorish.

1189
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,166
Ooh.

1190
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,708
What do you want?

1191
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:39,750
What do I want? I want to…

1192
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,250
I probably want to go home.

1193
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,000
Yeah, that's what I want the most.

1194
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:48,666
And why don't you?

1195
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:52,958
We don't all live like this, you know.

1196
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,208
Take it and…

1197
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:10,708
don't come back.

1198
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:13,958
Just tell Martha...
Tell her anything you want.

1199
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:17,375
Tell her your father's sick
or you fell in love with somebody else.

1200
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,541
I don't care what.

1201
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:22,958
But just make sure she knows
you are never coming back.

1202
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:19,791
- Found a little party pooper here.
- Huh?

1203
01:29:20,583 --> 01:29:22,125
- Party pooper.
- Oh.

1204
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,750
Right.

1205
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:28,375
Uh,

1206
01:29:29,166 --> 01:29:31,916
I just wanted to say that I didn't know

1207
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,916
that she didn't tell you
I was gonna be here.

1208
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,083
Oh, that's all right.

1209
01:29:43,416 --> 01:29:45,166
You a cat or a dog person?

1210
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:48,083
- Cat person.
- Yeah?

1211
01:29:48,166 --> 01:29:49,166
Mm-hmm.

1212
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,833
I'm a cat person too.

1213
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:55,208
Bullshit.

1214
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:01,541
You know what
a cat's favorite breakfast food is?

1215
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:03,958
- What?
- Mice Krispies.

1216
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:09,541
You are far too entertained by that.

1217
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,291
I wish we'd met earlier, you know.

1218
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:28,291
Yeah, same.

1219
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:31,083
You ever been to Seattle?

1220
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:35,333
- No. You?
- Yeah.

1221
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:40,125
I'm headed up there now.

1222
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:42,541
It's nice there.

1223
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,125
Yeah, I'll bet.

1224
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:26,416
<i>The manslaughter trial</i>

1225
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,750
<i>of former midwife
and passionate home-birth advocate,</i>

1226
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:31,750
<i>Eva Woodward,
is wrapping up in court today.</i>

1227
01:37:31,833 --> 01:37:34,708
<i>The 45-year-old is charged
with the home-birth death of a baby.</i>

1228
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:47,458
Okay, good. Thank you.

1229
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:52,583
Well, she could have told...
Just give me one second. Hey, Martha.

1230
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,250
Thank you for agreeing to this.

1231
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:56,666
I can assure you
she will serve time in prison.

1232
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:58,833
- It should be a walk in the park.
- I know.

1233
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:16,333
All rise.

1234
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:19,333
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

1235
01:38:19,416 --> 01:38:23,250
All persons having anything to do
before the Honorable Judge Spencer,

1236
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:27,875
now sitting in the County of Suffolk,
the justices of this court, draw near.

1237
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:30,583
Give your attention,
and you shall be heard.

1238
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:33,416
God save
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1239
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,125
The court is open. You may be seated.

1240
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:41,330
Yesterday,
we heard opening arguments

1241
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:44,041
onState versus Eva Woodward.

1242
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:47,875
Prosecution through the district attorney
carries the burden of proof.

1243
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:50,041
Therefore, the prosecution will go first.

1244
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,250
You may call your first witness.

1245
01:38:52,333 --> 01:38:55,041
Your Honor,
the Commonwealth calls Martha Weiss.

1246
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:58,208
Ms. Weiss, please come
forward and be sworn in by the clerk.

1247
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,625
Stand there, please.

1248
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:12,416
Raise your right hand.

1249
01:39:13,208 --> 01:39:17,041
Do you promise to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1250
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:19,125
- I do.
- Please state your name.

1251
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:20,250
Martha Weiss.

1252
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:24,450
- May I, Your Honor?
- Please.

1253
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:33,583
Could you please tell the court

1254
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:36,625
how the defendant came to be
the midwife for the delivery of your baby?

1255
01:39:36,708 --> 01:39:38,875
She was standing in
for our original midwife

1256
01:39:38,958 --> 01:39:40,791
who couldn't make it to the house in time.

1257
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:43,916
But you weren't happy
when you heard she was going to be coming

1258
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,791
instead of your chosen midwife, Barbara.

1259
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:47,958
I didn't know her,
but I thought it would be fine.

1260
01:39:48,041 --> 01:39:50,142
You trusted her
to safely deliver your baby.

1261
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:53,416
- I did, yes.
- May I ask why you trusted her?

1262
01:39:53,958 --> 01:39:58,541
Because, um, Barbara did
and because she was qualified, I guess.

1263
01:39:59,666 --> 01:40:02,708
During the labor, Ms. Woodward
was taking the baby's heart rate

1264
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:05,625
to see if the baby was okay
and that she could handle the labor?

1265
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:06,708
Yes.

1266
01:40:07,458 --> 01:40:11,333
The first time she checked
the baby's heart rate, it was strong, yes?

1267
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:12,416
Yes, it was.

1268
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,208
How many times
did she check the heart rate?

1269
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:19,666
About three, I would say.

1270
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:20,892
- Three times?
- Yes.

1271
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:23,041
- That's all? Only three times?
- Yes.

1272
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:26,208
And then
she told you to take a bath.

1273
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:27,666
Yes.

1274
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,230
Did she take
the baby's heart rate while in the bath?

1275
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:32,625
- No.
- So, let me get this straight.

1276
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:36,041
There's a sustained period of time
while you were in the bath

1277
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:39,291
where the baby's heart rate
was not being monitored.

1278
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:45,416
Yes.

1279
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:49,500
Did she ever communicate to you
explicitly that a lowered heart rate

1280
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:52,623
could mean that the baby was in distress
and that this could cause her death?

1281
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,333
She didn't say that to me.

1282
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:59,833
If you knew about the risk, would you
have demanded to go to the hospital?

1283
01:40:59,916 --> 01:41:02,708
Of course I would have
wanted to know that.

1284
01:41:02,791 --> 01:41:05,458
- Would you ever willingly harm your baby?
- Of course not.

1285
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:09,166
No. So if in one of the most
difficult moments of your life,

1286
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:10,833
during a difficult labor,

1287
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:14,166
the woman who you've decided
to put your trust in,

1288
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:18,708
who's been present at hundreds of births,
has far more experience than you do,

1289
01:41:18,791 --> 01:41:22,083
turns to you and says,
"You must go to the hospital right now,"

1290
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:23,875
would you have gone in? Yes or no?

1291
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:34,958
Yes, I would have.

1292
01:41:37,166 --> 01:41:38,916
No further questions, Your Honor.

1293
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:44,791
Mr. Lane, cross-examine?

1294
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:51,583
Thank you, Your Honor.

1295
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:57,625
First, may I say
how deeply sorry I am for your loss?

1296
01:41:57,708 --> 01:41:58,708
Thank you.

1297
01:41:59,833 --> 01:42:02,458
May I ask you
why you decided on a home birth?

1298
01:42:04,041 --> 01:42:06,791
I wanted the baby to decide
when she wanted to come.

1299
01:42:06,875 --> 01:42:09,541
Would it be fair to say
you were absolutely determined

1300
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:11,825
to have a home birth,
that you had your heart set on it?

1301
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:14,208
- Yes.
- And your partner agreed with you?

1302
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:17,000
We agreed to do it together. Yes.

1303
01:42:17,083 --> 01:42:19,291
And you both knew if there was a problem,

1304
01:42:19,375 --> 01:42:22,666
you may have to go to the hospital
to deliver the baby. Is that true?

1305
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:23,750
Of course, yes.

1306
01:42:23,833 --> 01:42:27,958
Because at a hospital,
you knew that should a problem arise,

1307
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:29,892
- that there was equipment...
- Yes, I knew that.

1308
01:42:29,916 --> 01:42:32,083
- There was expertise in a crisis...
- Yes.

1309
01:42:32,166 --> 01:42:35,500
And yet, when complications did arrive,

1310
01:42:35,583 --> 01:42:39,541
and your midwife suggested
you may consider going to the hospital

1311
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:42,666
because of a heart arrhythmia,
you decided to stay at the house.

1312
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:45,208
Yes, but she didn't say that to me. No.

1313
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:49,708
Let me ask this. You said earlier
you trust your midwife. Is that right?

1314
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:50,625
I did.

1315
01:42:50,708 --> 01:42:52,833
Yes. And do you trust your husband?

1316
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:54,375
- My partner?
- Yes.

1317
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:57,333
Yes, I do… did.

1318
01:42:57,416 --> 01:43:00,833
Because your partner
has given testimony

1319
01:43:00,916 --> 01:43:05,041
that your midwife strongly advised
you should go to the hospital.

1320
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:07,541
You say you're working together as a team.

1321
01:43:07,625 --> 01:43:11,625
And when your partner asked you
to go to the hospital, you refused to go.

1322
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:12,916
Is that correct?

1323
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,958
Is that correct?

1324
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:22,416
I wanted to stay at home myself.

1325
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:26,083
And you actively and adamantly
stated that to your husband

1326
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:28,083
that you didn't want
to go to the hospital?

1327
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,041
I did. Yes.

1328
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:32,541
The few moments
after your baby was born,

1329
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:34,000
was her breathing disturbed

1330
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,875
or was there anything
to indicate her condition was poor?

1331
01:43:38,166 --> 01:43:40,375
- No, not at...
- Did you hear her cry?

1332
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,791
- Yes, a bit.
- Did you hold her?

1333
01:43:43,958 --> 01:43:46,583
- Yes, I held...
- Was her body warm or cold?

1334
01:43:50,666 --> 01:43:51,958
I can't remember that.

1335
01:43:52,041 --> 01:43:54,708
You can't remember that?
Did you notice anything strange?

1336
01:43:54,791 --> 01:43:57,750
Did you notice that her feet
were turning blue and purple?

1337
01:43:59,791 --> 01:44:02,916
- I didn't look at her feet.
- Did you look at her hands?

1338
01:44:04,666 --> 01:44:05,666
No.

1339
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:10,333
You didn't look at her feet or her hands.
Did you notice the color of her eyes?

1340
01:44:10,416 --> 01:44:12,541
Did you notice
whether she had blonde hair,

1341
01:44:12,625 --> 01:44:15,583
dark hair, lots of hair, no hair?

1342
01:44:17,166 --> 01:44:18,375
Yes, she…

1343
01:44:19,125 --> 01:44:21,208
- Pardon me?
- It was dark. Yes.

1344
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:22,833
Her hair was dark. Yes.

1345
01:44:22,916 --> 01:44:24,500
Did you notice anything else?

1346
01:44:24,583 --> 01:44:27,916
That her fingers were long?
Or her toes… Did she have ten fingers...

1347
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
- I said I looked at her face.
- You looked at her face.

1348
01:44:31,083 --> 01:44:32,083
Yes.

1349
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:36,208
What did you feel
when you were holding your baby?

1350
01:44:39,333 --> 01:44:40,833
How did I feel?

1351
01:44:40,916 --> 01:44:45,041
Yes, how did you feel holding
your baby you had just given birth to?

1352
01:45:02,083 --> 01:45:04,375
She smelled like an apple.

1353
01:45:04,458 --> 01:45:07,333
- She smelled like an apple.
- Mm-hmm.

1354
01:45:07,416 --> 01:45:11,083
"What did she feel?" was the question.
Did she feel like a healthy baby?

1355
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:14,333
She did. Yes.

1356
01:45:14,416 --> 01:45:15,625
Yes.

1357
01:45:15,708 --> 01:45:20,000
If your baby had died
because of something like SIDS...

1358
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:21,625
Objection, Your Honor.

1359
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:24,541
SIDS has not been established
as a definite cause of death.

1360
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:26,833
Let the jury decide, not the witness.

1361
01:45:28,916 --> 01:45:32,958
I would like to hear the witness's
testimony as to her state of mind.

1362
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:37,125
If you feel you can answer
the question, I would like you to.

1363
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:40,458
Can I have a break?
Just one minute?

1364
01:45:42,166 --> 01:45:43,166
Mr. Lane?

1365
01:45:44,333 --> 01:45:46,083
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

1366
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:48,892
Then this court will be
in recess till this afternoon.

1367
01:45:48,916 --> 01:45:51,500
- Thank you.
- The trial will continue after the break.

1368
01:45:51,583 --> 01:45:52,625
All rise.

1369
01:46:47,291 --> 01:46:48,291
Can I help you?

1370
01:46:48,375 --> 01:46:52,875
Um, do you have any photos here
under the name of Weiss?

1371
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:54,750
Weiss.

1372
01:46:55,833 --> 01:46:56,833
Weiss.

1373
01:46:58,416 --> 01:47:00,250
Um... Oh, yeah.

1374
01:47:01,416 --> 01:47:02,666
We prepared the negatives,

1375
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:05,333
but we didn't print any
'cause we never heard back.

1376
01:47:05,416 --> 01:47:08,083
- You wanna check them out?
- Yes. Is that okay?

1377
01:47:08,166 --> 01:47:09,166
Sure.

1378
01:47:10,041 --> 01:47:11,041
There you go.

1379
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,041
- Can you print them right now?
- Sure.

1380
01:47:59,708 --> 01:48:01,083
It just takes a second.

1381
01:48:01,833 --> 01:48:03,166
I'll be back in a minute.

1382
01:48:40,833 --> 01:48:41,833
Oh, God.

1383
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:45,708
Oh, God.

1384
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:27,291
Your Honor, I'd like to submit
additional documents indicating

1385
01:49:27,375 --> 01:49:31,750
certain inconsistencies that were
presented earlier by the prosecution.

1386
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:51,958
Could I just have
a word with the judge?

1387
01:49:52,041 --> 01:49:52,875
Directly?

1388
01:49:52,958 --> 01:49:54,976
- Yes.
- That's not usually allowed.

1389
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,458
- I know. But do you mind asking?
- I will ask him.

1390
01:49:57,541 --> 01:49:59,375
- Thank you.
- Please wait here.

1391
01:50:00,458 --> 01:50:03,666
Judge, Miss Weiss
would like to address the court.

1392
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:06,916
That's highly unusual,
but I'd like to hear what she has to say.

1393
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,458
Miss Weiss, you wish to address the court?

1394
01:50:09,541 --> 01:50:10,625
Yes, thank you.

1395
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:31,333
This woman…

1396
01:50:34,916 --> 01:50:37,958
did not intentionally harm my girl.

1397
01:50:41,458 --> 01:50:45,416
She only wanted to deliver
a healthy baby that night.

1398
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,625
And I do not think it is your fault.

1399
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:50,541
I do not think it is her fault.

1400
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,583
And thank you.

1401
01:51:04,791 --> 01:51:09,208
There might be a reason for what happened,
but we are not gonna find it in this room.

1402
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:18,958
And if I stand here
and ask for compensation or money,

1403
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,500
then I am...

1404
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:25,083
I'm saying that
I can be compensated, and I can't.

1405
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:29,541
I can't bring her back.

1406
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:33,000
No money or verdicts or sentences can…

1407
01:51:35,333 --> 01:51:36,833
can bring back what…

1408
01:51:41,333 --> 01:51:44,083
How can I give this pain to someone else?

1409
01:51:44,166 --> 01:51:45,791
Someone who's already suffered?

1410
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:49,708
And I know she would not want that.

1411
01:51:50,875 --> 01:51:51,875
At all.

1412
01:51:54,416 --> 01:51:57,958
That is not why
my daughter came into this world

1413
01:51:58,541 --> 01:52:00,083
for the time that she did.

1414
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,083
And that is all I have to say. Thank you.

1415
01:52:28,125 --> 01:52:30,083
- Thank you, Miss Weiss.
- All rise.

1416
01:54:15,416 --> 01:54:16,666
Base panel.

1417
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:20,125
And he looked in and I was like,
"What? It was from a cartoon."

1418
01:54:20,833 --> 01:54:23,333
I remember
'cause it was like a neon green.

1419
01:54:23,416 --> 01:54:26,041
- Yeah, do you remember this, Mom?
- Thank you.

1420
01:54:26,125 --> 01:54:27,750
But we didn't order that.

1421
01:54:28,333 --> 01:54:29,458
Yes, you did, Mom.

1422
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:32,083
I did?

1423
01:54:32,166 --> 01:54:33,846
Mom, it's lemon poppy.
You love it.

1424
01:54:34,541 --> 01:54:37,208
Lemon poppy? I don't love lemon poppy.

1425
01:54:37,291 --> 01:54:38,666
- Oh, my God, um…
- No.

1426
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:39,750
No?

1427
01:54:40,333 --> 01:54:42,208
- Okay.
- Jerry Thompson.

1428
01:54:42,291 --> 01:54:43,416
Jerry Thompson.

1429
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,083
- That was it.
- Yeah.

1430
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:47,166
- Yes.
- One year we went to that party.

1431
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:50,458
It was like some older guy was
throwing a party, and we snuck out.

1432
01:54:50,541 --> 01:54:52,226
Sorry, now you know.

1433
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:56,000
And we went as, like, two pieces of candy.

1434
01:54:56,666 --> 01:54:57,500
Yes!

1435
01:54:57,583 --> 01:54:59,343
No, you know
what you're thinking of,

1436
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:01,833
'cause you made our Thanksgiving costumes.

1437
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:02,916
What do you remember?

1438
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,125
Lucy!

1439
01:58:23,333 --> 01:58:24,416
Lucy!

1440
01:58:28,916 --> 01:58:29,916
Luce!

1441
01:58:31,875 --> 01:58:33,125
Lucianna!

1442
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:40,750
Hey, baby.

1443
01:58:41,833 --> 01:58:42,875
It's dinner.

1444
01:58:44,875 --> 01:58:47,250
Come down. Time to eat, bug.

1445
01:58:47,333 --> 01:58:48,333
Okay.

1446
01:58:49,375 --> 01:58:51,416
There you are.

1447
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:53,458
I'm hungry. What's for dinner?

1448
01:58:53,541 --> 01:58:54,791
It's your favorite.

1449
01:58:54,875 --> 01:58:56,000
Popsicle?

1450
01:58:56,083 --> 01:58:57,083
Mm-mm.

1451
01:58:57,583 --> 01:58:58,708
Tacos?

1452
01:58:58,791 --> 01:58:59,791
No.

1453
01:58:59,875 --> 01:59:01,125
Jelly sandwich?

1454
01:59:01,791 --> 01:59:02,916
Definitely not.

1455
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,458
- Popcorn?
- Mm-mm.

1456
01:59:05,583 --> 01:59:06,958
Then I'm not hungry.

1457
01:59:08,291 --> 01:59:09,458
You wanna run in?
