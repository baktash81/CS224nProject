00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,301
Ugh.
No survivors.

7
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:35,847
Oh, sorry. Thought it was hard boiled.
[chuckles]

8
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,557
Wow.
Sorry, Kelani.

9
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,351
Got a little egg
on your face.

10
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,020
[Audrey] You can
call it the eggbeater.

11
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,106
Try a potato.
Less mess

12
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,776
when your ride hurls another
passenger at the wall.

13
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:49,902
Ouch!

14
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,404
You guys
need a break.

15
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,323
Ooh! How about
a weekend's getaway?

16
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,741
Of course
with Bella.

17
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,453
You remember Bella,
your darling baby.

18
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,706
You go. I'll stay
and house-sit.

19
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,915
I am 13.

20
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,126
Cool idea, Audrey,
but it's crunch time.

21
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,380

Oh, yes, The Eggbeater.

24
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:20,850
I mean, the Fun Folly.
Oh, you like The Eggbeater?

25
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:25,521
Yes. It's gonna have the tightest
curves, the highest speed.

26
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,983
Biggest body counts.

27
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,030
We're so on schedule.
Talk soon. Okay.

28
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,115
[sighs]

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,659
Hey, Audrey,
can you check on Bella?

30
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,662
Ugh. As of
five minutes ago,

31
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:44,456
I am OTC,
off the clock.

32
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,878
Oh, just one favor. Then it's our
watch for the rest of the day.

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,463
- Promise.
- [groans]

34
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,563
Sorry about
your feeder, Harvey.

Harvey.

38
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,335
Purrbles, will my parents
ever get a normal job?

39
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,671
Like in an office
away from home,

40
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,339
and away
from me?

41
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,262
Can't answer
that one, huh?

42
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,682
There's a science club
at school. Should I join?

43
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,684
Maybe I'll meet kids
who like me for more

44
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,771
than the theme park passes
I get from my parents.

45
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,570
You're right.
People just disappoint you.

46
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,824

49
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,222
Hmm. We need
another victim.

50
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,016
Oh. I mean
passenger.

51
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,226
Ah! Very funny.

00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,775
Harvey.

54
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,451
Harvey.

55
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,286
- [Jim] Hmm?
- [Rosa] Too big.

56
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,330
- How about...
- No, I thought there was an avocado.

57
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,624
- Sorry, ate it.
- You never eat a plain avocado.

58
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,877
[Jim] Yeah,
but it's so good with a cheeseburger.

59
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,134
[gurgling]

60
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,136
Harvey!

61
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,015
[laughs]

62
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:08,726
Ah!

63
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,687
- [Rosa gasps] Bella!
- [Jim] Grab her!

64
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,233
Gotcha!
[laughs] Ooh!

65
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,526
[both] Audrey!

66
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,320
- What?
- Bella almost fell.

67
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,743
I am OTC,
remember?

68
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,119
Ugh!

69
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,037
[door slams]

<i>Swimming, horseback
riding, barbecues...</i>

72
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,548
Horsy!

73
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,551
Okay, Rosa,
I can take a hint.

74
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,262
I didn't call up
that website.

75
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,181
[both] Audrey.

76
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:50,350
[sighs] What have we
done to this family?

77
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,813
Jim, maybe we ought
to listen to Audrey,

78
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,481
get away for a couple of days,

79
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,816
you know, reboot.

80
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,111
Then get a fresh start
on the Fun Folly,

81
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,780
I mean, Eggbeater,
when we get back.

82
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,867
Not until we make
our deadline.

83
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,662
[sighs] Let's
apologize to Audrey.

84
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,665

Earl, how the hell

88

[Earl]<i> Well, I saw your company</i>

<i>What say I pop on over so we can kind
of, well, catch up.</i>

91
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,685
[Jim] No, I don't want to
change our relationship.

92
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,605
<i>Hey, I hadn't
seen you in 15 years.</i>

93
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,775
- What kind of relationship is that?
- Ideal!

[announcer on TV] <i>Escape to Oasis
Rancho, where trouble can't find you.</i>

95
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,286
Hmm?

96
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:59,086
Start packing. We're going on
a mini vacay to Oasis Rancho!

97
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:02,298
Yes! I'll totally take such
great care of the house.

98
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,675
- No, we're all going.
- What?

99
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,385
And you won't be
babysitting.

100
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,928
You can spend
the whole time

101
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,638
swimming and
making new friends.

102
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,266
I don't make friends.
I don't have a swimsuit.

103
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:16,103
We'll buy you one.
A swimsuit, not a friend. [laughing]

104
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,400
[Audrey] Mom.
Dad, aren't you being irresponsible?

105
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,818
What about
your deadline?

106
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,278
What about
the mortgage?

107
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,406
[Rosa] You're too cute.
We know this was your idea.

108
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,241
[Audrey] What?
That's ridiculous.

109
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:33,120
What a performance, Audrey.
You should think about acting.

110
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:36,748
- [Rosa] All strapped in, Bella.
- [Jim] Or be an online influxer.

111
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,043
It's called
an influencer, Dad.

112
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,003
[Jim and Rosa laughing]

113
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,924
[Audrey] Oh,
there will be mosquitos

114
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,386
and poison ivy
and people!

115
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,948

00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,923
Hiya!

119

[grunts]

120
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,014

Furball McKitty.

124
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,108
I've asked you
to address me correctly.

125
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,068
- Purrbles McCat.
- [clanging]

- [shushing]
- [clanging]

127
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,494
Icki, what, dare I ask,
are you doing?

128
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,663
Name is Ikioi,
flea bag.

129
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,999
And I am reconnoitering
for hostiles.

130
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,709
Oh, for the love
of catnip.

131
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,170
It's our duty
under the bobblehead creed.

132
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,132
Bobbles never bobble
in defending their humans.

133
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,675
[scoffs] You are
sadly mistaken.

134
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,677
The bobble creed
is thus.

135
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,513
Bobbles bobble wisdom.

136
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,182
One's purpose is to
enlighten one's human

137
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,185
with a charming yes
or no of one's head.

138
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,021
Icki, don't run away
while I'm monologuing.

139
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,606
Where was I? Right.

140
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,859
And otherwise to retain
one's value as a collectible

141
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,113
by staying still on
one's base at all times.

142
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,449
So what are you
doing off your base?

143
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,950
Getting answers.

144
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,370
Funny that someone so obsessed
with defending the family

145
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,206
hasn't noticed
that the family is gone.

146
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,208
Furball is right.
[grunts]

147
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,552
At ease.

148
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,346
It's just her.

149
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,061
Unbelievable.
You're playing at a time like this?

150
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,273
I don't play.
This is a long overdue shred sesh.

151
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,108
Perfecting
my bobble fit.

152
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,402
Kelani, this is
an emergency.

153
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,279
Our humans
have gone AWOL.

154
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,657
Be easy, brah. They're getting
some much needed shakalohana.

155
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,867
I made it
happen.

156
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,660
What's your major
malfunction, Kelani?

157
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,788
Bella isn't safe without
me to protect her.

158
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,708
All good in the hood,
it was the right thing to do.

159
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,378
Bobbles bobble,
but are always righteous.

160
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,671
And Audrey needs
to make friends.

161
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,757
Audrey doesn't need friends.
She has me.

162
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,801
[scoffs] You don't
cut it, homeslice.

163
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,180
You've put
our humans in danger

164
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,890
- sending them out there.
- Nah.

165
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,766
The Bobble High Council
would commend me.

166
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,103
Commend the bobblehead whose
prototype is a cheater?

167
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,773
- Exactly.
- Step off. At least I got a proto.

168
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,775
And she's real,
with real skills,

169
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,319
not some
comic book guest star

170
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,987
who got aced
after one issue.

171
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,493
[grunting]

172
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,580
[screams]

173
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,000
What's really hood?

174
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,091
[grunting]

175

00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,581
Ugh!

525
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,503
[Kelani panting]

526
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,089
[door closes]

527
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,508
We're locked out.

528
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:06,717
We're homeless.

529
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,345
Hope Earl left
something for me.

530
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,765
Mmm... Bleh!

531
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,685
There's mold on this.

532
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,604
Help me, Furball.

533
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,028
[Deuce] Hey!

534
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,656
Head does not
detach from body!

535
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,700
- [barking]
- Come on, Deuce.

536
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,415
[giggles] Just making sure
the field is regulation.

537
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,970
You want it?
You want it?

538
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,639
- Get it, dog!
- [barks]

539
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,307
Whoa! Nice arm.

540
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:04,983
- [Deuce] That's nasty!
- Ew.

541
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,029
Purrbles, play dead,
don't run.

542
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,322
That's what he wants.

543
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,161
Ahhh!

544
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,958
Let me go!

545
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,126
Put me down, you beast!

546
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,212
I'm warning you!

547
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,506
[Deuce] Still nasty!

548
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,675
Will the humiliation
never end?

549
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,969
Congratulations, Kelani,

550
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,221
on successfully recruiting
the enemy

551
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,932
to the side of Bobbledom.

552
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:37,307
Thanks.

553
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,184
Too bad he can't help us
get back in the house.

554
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,520
Huh.

555
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,651
Maybe he can.

556
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,153
Simple matter
of engineering.

557
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,698
Come on, doggy.

558
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,324
Come here, boy.

559
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,995
Just so I know
the game plan,

560
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,455
why are we
standing here?

561
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,332
Don't ask me,
ask super ninja.

562
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,209
Stand tall, soldier.

563
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,261
[all screaming]

564
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:19,976
Nailed it.

565
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,563
Over here.

566
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,071
There's too many players
in this dugout.

567
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,203
[Ikioi] I'll take point.

568
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:48,378
- [Kelani] Nice.
- I call it luck.

569
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,266
[Deuce yelps]

570
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,686
I swear,

571
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,896
if that guy didn't have
his own driver's license,

572
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,230
he'd forget
his stupid name.

573
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,942
[blows nose]

574
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,038
Ten out of ten.

575
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,794
This violates
the ground rules.

576
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,880
Stay on the ground,
those are the rules.

577
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,256
Let go, you imbecile.

578
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,925
Bobbles away, Deuce.

579
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,636
He can't do it, Kelani.
He's scared.

580
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,805
Get out.
You are so cray-cray.

581
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,266
[both screaming]

582
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,685
[Kelani] Deuce, grab him.

583
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,190
Hang on!

584
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,819
[toilet flushing]

585
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,616
I'm safe. [gasps]
Not safe, not safe.

586
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,499
- Ikioi!
- On it!

587
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,763
Whoa!

588
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,392
[Deuce] Got you.

589
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,279
[exhales]

590
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,321
[exhaling]

591
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,365
Medic!

592
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,409
- Deuce, help him!
- Me?

593
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,411
You said you could do
whatever your proto could.

594
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:47,164
- He was a doctor.
- Right. Okay.

595
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,041
Step aside,
where's the patient?

596
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,085
Open wide.

597
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,795
[throws up]

598
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:55,505
[sputtering]

599
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,341
Yuck!

600
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,385
Well, I was
in mint condition.

601
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,222
I thank you.

602
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,809
- You saved me.
- No problem.

603
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,270
- Not you, them.
- Huh?

604
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,230
No drama, bobble creed.

605
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,900
Got to do the righteous
thing at all times.

606
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:17,694
- Proper Bob-sweet.
- Glad to be of service.

607
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,198
At least he doesn't smell
like cabbage anymore.

608
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,077
I, uh, I'm better at catching
a fly ball than a wet cat.

609
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,081
[giggles] You know, 'cause I
don't catch those normally.

610
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:30,582
For sure. It's chill.

611
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:36,880
And without that package,
our future plans are shot.

612
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,966
I mean what can I say,
it's like it's got legs

613
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:41,426
and it just walked off
on its own.

614
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,600
Catch you
on the flip side.

615
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,435
Can't wait, skatey!

616
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,949
Sweet. Bobble-hug.

617
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:09,454
Where you at, McCat?

618
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,249
Hiding until
our humans return.

619
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,293
I've had enough excitement.

620
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:19,006
[Binky] It's not in the car,
not on the coffee table,

621
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:22,634
and you thoroughly
investigated the refrigerator.

622
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:23,844
Where is it?

623
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,763
Hey! Here it is!

624
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,266
Oh, bless your heart.
You found it.

625
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,144
Now all we got to do is
find the other bobblehead.

626
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:33,812
Other bobblehead?

627
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,523
[Earl] I kinda think we should
wait till Jim gets home, Binks.

628
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,067
I'm sure they'll be home
any minute.

629
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,735
[Binky] More like two days.

630
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,529
Well, looky here.

631
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:45,157
Seems they went on
a little vacation.

632
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,325
Guess your brother
does have all the luck.

633
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,412
Oh, yeah.

634
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:54,958
I mean, he clearly mentioned
something about, uh...

635
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,752
Uh...

636
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,171
"Rancho Oasis."

637
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,465
[crying]

638
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,634
Where are we
going to stay?

639
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,846
You spent your last dime
on that baseball bobblehead

640
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:09,098
for Jim.

641
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,933
We could stay here.

642
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,809
I guess
Jim wouldn't mind.

643
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:16,063
I mean, I guess, heck,
we're family, right?

644
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,647
I don't know.

645
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:21,568
Well, I don't wanna,
but if you insist.

646
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,820
[Dumpster whines]

647
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,363
[Binky] We should at least
search the house

648
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,490
to make sure we aren't
wasting our time.

649
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,326
[Earl] Sure, first thing
in the morning.

650
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,411
We'll find
that bobble, Binky.

651
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,580
They're going to swap
one of us for Deuce?

652
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,208
Not on my watch.

653
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,210
- [sniffing]
- [Ikioi] First thing we do is set up a base camp.

654
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:39,461
You take first watch.

655
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,338
[Earl] Come on, Dumpy,
it's beddy-bye.

656
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,381
Wake me up at 0500.

657
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,182
[Binky] Oh, now,
Early Burly,

658
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,143
I think I'm gonna
sleep in here.

659
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:57,187
And you,
you take the master.

660
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,897
Oh, buttercup,

661
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:02,567
you know sleeping alone in a
strange house gives me the willies.

662
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,528
[laughs]
Oh, aren't you cute.

663
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,699
Oh, you know the rules.

664
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,494
If you eat a gherkin...
[laughs]

665
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,502
Ha, this is the kind of room
I should've had.

come in pink?

[coughs] Oh, Binky,
come on, brush your teeth

670
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:48,113
before you come to bed.

[guru through earphones]
<i>Powdered sugar snows down...</i>

672
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,018

Hello, hi!

How dare she.

677
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,317
You, uh, forgot this.

678
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,985
Hey, my lucky bat.

679
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,488
So, Kelani,

680
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,283
is this the only reason
you unwrapped me?

681
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:18,161
Yes, and I missed you.

682
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,289
And that's a cruel world,
you know.

[Purrbles] Well, well.

708

he got out of his box?

We, um...

00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,840
Forgot to give him his bat,
and check it,

711
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,885
Earl's giving him to Jim.
So he's gonna be crashing here anyhow.

Yeah, in place of one of us.

713
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,638
I'm not leaving Bella.

And I'm not going to live with that
low-life thief Binky, and her...

Low-life thief?
What's your hassle?

716
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,689
Seems like you
fit right in, cat burglar.

717
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,193
Maybe they want you.

718
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,320
And wouldn't that be rich?

719
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:18,365
They take you
and Deuce gets left here.

720
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:20,950
It's so<i> Romeo and Juliet.</i>

721
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,286
So,<i> Titanic.</i>

722
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,205
And you know,
three of them died.

723
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,831
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Time out, team.

724
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,543
Why don't we work together
and get rid of 'em?

725
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:32,462
Then we can all
live happily ever after.

726
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:34,548
I doubt they'll leave
without you.

727
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:37,217
And furthermore,
I'm not getting involved.

Besides, I might have strained a

His prototype could knock
every ball out of the park.

Purrbles McCat.

878
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,265
- [Earl] Get your stuff, honey. Let's hit it.
- It worked.

879
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,600
They're leaving.

880
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,144
Time to get Deuce packed up.

881
00:53:50,145 --> 00:53:51,729
[sighs] Okay.

882
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:53,189
Yeah.

883
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,569
Guess this trade
fell through.

884
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,122
[Earl] Let's get outta here.

885
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:11,124
[Binky] Oh,
for peanuts' sake, Earl,

886
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,750
let me get my clothes on.

887
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,085
Bobbleheads up.

888
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:32,353
[sobbing]

889
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:39,986
It's gonna be
all right, Binky.

890
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:43,114
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

891
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:49,996
[muted gasp]

892
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,843
[panting]

893
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:06,971
[Ikioi] So, did some
intelligence and McKitty

894
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:09,140
is worth a fortune.

895
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,517
Hold on. What?

896
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:15,104
Purrbles McCat is a
one-of-a-kind original

897
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,605
made by a famous artist.

898
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,984
He is
the ultimate collectible.

899
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,444
The artist's mark
is on your paw.

900
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,491
Well, that's just ridiculous.
There's nothing on...

901
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:30,078
- [yelps]
- Rad!

902
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:32,872
Slick detective work, Ikioi.

903
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,291
Well, aren't you
gonna thank her?

904
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,584
You could have been taken.

905
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,296
I want to be taken.

906
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,463
- What?
- Say what?

907
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,632
I'm done residing
with inferiors.

908
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,301
I'll go for top price.

909
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,304
Maybe have a place of honor
in the bobblehead museum.

910
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,307
I'll be worshiped
like Cher and Deuce.

911
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,851
What about Audrey?
She needs you.

912
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,605
She is better off alone.

913
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:00,691
Like she says,
people just disappoint you.

914
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:02,693
They sure do.

915
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,071
So long, losers.

916
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,492
What you got there, boy?

917
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:16,207
What do you know,
that stupid dog had it all along.

918
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,167
Stupid?

919
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:21,879
Did you just call
Dumpster stupid?

920
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,422
Uh, did I?

921
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,382
I meant stupendous!

922
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:31,347
Well, you better let me hang on to
it for safekeeping, honey bucket.

923
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:35,101
No, that would be stealing
from my own brother.

924
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:37,519
Never been his fault
I'm a loser.

925
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:41,023
You've always been a loser,
but you don't have to be.

926
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:45,111
We sell that kitty, and you and
me, we can go places.

927
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,697
No, not that way, Binky.

928
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,575
We got each other, right?
We'll work something out.

929
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:54,411
We don't need the money.
We got love.

930
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,249
Bye-bye, fishy.

931
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:06,882
[chuckles]

932
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,426
I'm gonna miss this.
Like I said,

933
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,262
such good taste.

934
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,974
Earl, Dumpster
and Binks, out.

935
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:30,614
- Dumpster. Let's go, boy.
- [Dumpster barking]

936
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:31,949
Camel up.

937
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:42,293
[thud]

938
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:46,297
Oh, you think that I'm gonna sell
that cat to the highest bidder, huh?

939
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:49,133
You think
I'm as stupid as you?

940
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:53,554
I'm gonna use him as a mold
and make a thousand copies.

941
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,723
[vocalizing]

942
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,684
That's right. I'll pass
every one of them off

943
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,769
as the real one,
the real one!

944
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,855
And it was my idea.

945
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:05,733
- Binky?
- That's enough out of you.

946
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:10,363
I'm gonna get a good night's sleep,
me in the kind of house that I deserve,

947
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:12,281
and you in here.

948
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:15,201
And then tomorrow,
I'll get rich.

949
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:17,661
It's all for me!

950
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:20,331
[kisses]

951
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:33,969
[Kelani] Don't worry. You won't
have to stay here with us losers.

952
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,639
We'll leave this house.
They'll know how posh you are.

953
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,018
They'll surely send you straight
to the bobblehead museum

954
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,771
where you'll be
worshiped by all.

955
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,190
And be on
the Bobble High Council.

956
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,778
Kelani,
I'm sorry about Deuce.

957
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,989
Not your fault he turned out
to be such a faker.

958
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,867
Not his fault
my prototype is a big letdown.

959
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:11,382
But you were
so bobbalicious.

960
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:14,427
Why couldn't my proto be
someone steezy like you peeps?

961
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:17,179
Someone famous,
and fabulous, and loved.

962
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,639
Like you, sista.

963
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,476
[thud]

964
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:27,523
I'm cursed and worthless.

965
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,400
[sighs]

966
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:31,652
[woman]<i> Sweetheart,
are you out of your bobblehead?</i>

967
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,070
<i>We gotta talk.</i>

968
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,076
[grunts]

969
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:44,665
[mouse clicks]

970
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,252
- Weird.
- [Ikioi panting]

971
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:49,628
I think
they're coming back.

972
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:51,922
[keys rattling]

973
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,261
Idiot. You put the trailer key
in the mushroom.

974
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,598
Honest to Pete, Earl,
you're so dumb,

975
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,142
you put stamps
on an email.

976
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,062
- [barks]
- [yelps]

977
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:10,274
Go chase a garbage truck.

978
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,779
[Binky] Ugh, God,
please help me.

979
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:20,909
Ha!

980
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,461
- Thanks.
- [panting]

981
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,424
[Kelani] They're back.

982
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,260
[Kelani] Your lucky day.

983
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:41,805
Binky probably forgot
something like the silver.

984
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:45,184
Oh, there you are.

985
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:47,019
My meal ticket.

986
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,732
Where's Earl and Dumpster?

987
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:58,697
[guru on earphones] <i>Gentle
Zephron is buffeting my nails</i>

988
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:03,660
<i>as I climb peacefully
to Shangri-La.</i>

989
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,335
[humming]

990
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:23,889
[burps]

991
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,018
[Dumpster barking]

992
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,104
Hey, open up!

993
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,316
Where's Binky?

994
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:36,151
Big Bad Bink's
in the bubble bath.

995
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,903
Purrbles is prisoner
in her pack.

996
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,197
He's lucky.
I was in Earl's mouth.

997
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:41,616
Binky knocked him out.

998
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:43,742
- [Kelani] No way!
- [Ikioi] What a traitor.

999
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,869
She's been stringing him
along to get to Purrbles.

1000
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,414
- She's gonna use him as a mold to make copies of him.
- What?

1001
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:51,166
[Purrbles] I knew
I'd made a terrible mistake.

1002
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,502
Purrbles, what happened
to you?

1003
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:57,673
I've seen things no bobblehead
should ever have to see.

1004
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,301
[hiccups] We should never have
left our bases.

1005
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,553
We're in over
our bobble-heads.

1006
01:02:02,595 --> 01:02:04,721
Maybe McKitty is right.

1007
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:07,182
Yeah. This has been
one big flail.

1008
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,850
I haven't been
much help either.

1009
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,103
[rotors whirring]

1010
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,522
[Ikioi] Bogey.
Two o'clock. Coming in hot.

1011
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,023
[Deuce] Let's check it out.

1012
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,025
Wait for Purrbles.

1013
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:20,613
- [rotors whirring]
- [barking]

1014
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,084
[whirring]

1015
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:39,089
[woman coughing]
Really, guys?

1016
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,717
Do we need these
big entrances every time?

1017
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,428
Also the fog, it can't be
good for the environment.

1018
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:51,810
Hey, bobbles,
how's it going?

1019
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:56,607
- [Purrbles gasps]
- You're you! You're Cher?

1020
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:58,192
I'm Bobblehead Cher.

1021
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,068
You know, don't get me
wrong, Cher's great,

1022
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,112
but I'm my own bobblehead.

1023
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:06,033
And I'm a representative of
the Bobblehead High Council.

1024
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,285
Are you here
to arrest us?

1025
01:03:08,327 --> 01:03:09,453
[Cher] For what?

1026
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,955
For breaking
the bobble creed.

1027
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,583
Yeah, we got to talk
about the creed.

1028
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:17,127
Come on up.
We're gonna go to the VIP section.

1029
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,381
[panting]

1030
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,512
Hey, Deuce!
Come on, dude.

1031
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:34,478
Deuce! Jump just before
the teeter-totter tips down.

1032
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,021
Just try.

1033
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:37,231
Yeah, you've got this.

1034
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,107
I don't.

1035
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,193
I'm not a rad athlete
like Kelani.

1036
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:42,653
I'm just a bobblehead.

1037
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:46,114
Deuce, the only reason Kelani has...
How'd you put it?

1038
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,868
...steezy mad skills...
Is because she practices her butt off.

1039
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,372
Now get your bobble-butt
up here.

1040
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:56,333
[exhales deeply] Come on, Deuce.
You got this.

1041
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:07,928
Ha! [exclaims]
Will you look at that?

1042
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,513
- Rad!
- Outstanding, soldier.

1043
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:11,223
You bobble-bolted it.

1044
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:13,475
See, dude,
and with a little work,

1045
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,353
I bet you could improve your
batting average. You know?

1046
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,773
Now, the creed.

1047
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:22,317
I don't know where you guys are

That's it?

How can I bring joy when my

your proto can, but so what?

You're kind

Deuce, you're a good guy.

1065
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:11,700

Oh, Ikioi.

1070
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,044
Being a true hero isn't
about having a better weapon.

1071
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:26,298
It's about having the courage
to protect those you love.

1072
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,801
And you've proven that
over and over again.

You are literally

Embrace it.

That's what my proto did.

1079
01:05:43,524 --> 01:05:45,484
But what if we're never
as good as our protos?

1080

Then find your own way
to bring joy!

You don't have to live
under anybody's shadow.

When you put your
bobble-heads together,

1083
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,452
you can achieve anything.

1084
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:58,163

- Please.
- I'm sorry, bobbles.

1088

But, what if we need
your help again?

1091
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:08,965
You won't. You've got

1222
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,701
No. These ain't
bobbleheads.

1223
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:34,953
Come here, come here.

1224
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:37,331
They're space aliens.
Yeah, you were right.

1225
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:39,166
I think they tried
to probe me.

1226
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:42,377
Oh, well, look who's
been somnambulating.

1227
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,587
Come on,
Binky Stinky!

1228
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:45,797
The good news?

1229
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:48,758
You're finally gonna get
your big old house.

1230
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,971
The bad news, it's got
a lot of bars on the window.

1231
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:55,556
Yes!
Outstanding, McCat!

1232
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,225
Masterful, Ikioi.

1233
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:59,727
I salute you.
They're gone for good.

1234
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:00,895
[Kelani sighs]

1235
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:04,399
I can't believe
he's gone.

1236
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,735
You never know, Kelani.
Maybe Deuce will be back.

1237
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,237
And you still have us.

1238
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,905
For whatever
that's worth.

1239
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,619
It's worth more than
all the money in the world.

1240
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:31,634
[gags]

1241
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,814
[Kelani] Nope, that goes
into bracket B.

1242
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:46,482
Nice work, Ikioi!

1243
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:49,485
Um, let's try
piece K with A.

1244
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:50,653
[Purrbles] Ingenious!

1245
01:14:57,452 --> 01:15:00,788
Maybe we'll have better luck
fixing Harvey's fish food feeder.

1246
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,540
Two bobbleheads
are better than one.

1247
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,625
Make that three.

1248
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:07,462
- [Kelani] Race you!
- [Purrbles] Not fair.

1249
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,922
You got
a bobble-head start.

1250
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,131
[Ikioi laughs]

1251
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:13,093
[all singing]

1252
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,097
[Audrey] Thanks again, kids.

1253
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:20,434
I mean, Mom and Dad,
for the super fun weekend.

1254
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:22,269
You've got it,
little lady.

1255
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:24,771
We'll start planning
our next one.

1256
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:25,855
[instrumental music playing]

1257
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:30,193
Harvey!

1258
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,529
[Jim] Looks like he
missed you, sweetie.

1259
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:35,531
Welcome home, Bella.

1260
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:38,785
Purrbles.

1261
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:40,828
I made some new friends
at Oasis Rancho,

1262
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,789
and two of them
live near here.

1263
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:45,541
Should I invite them over?

1264
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,673
[laughs] Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1265
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:01,766
Hey, did you reverse the
bracket on the turn here?

1266
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:04,478
No, angle looks off too.

1267
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,698
[gasps] No fatalities!

1268
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,950
- [Jim] It works!
- [both laugh]

1269
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:21,495
- [doorbell ringing]
- I'll get that.

1270
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:23,497
Hear that, sweetie?
Nobody died.

1271
01:16:23,538 --> 01:16:25,415
- No, they didn't. No, they didn't.
- [laughs]

1272
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:31,421
Earl.

1273
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:35,175
A Deuce bobblehead?

1274
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:38,303
I know this doesn't make up
for me taking Dad's collection.

1275
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:39,595
It don't.

1276
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,556
I guess I just got
a little wrapped up

1277
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,141
in you having
all the luck

1278
01:16:43,183 --> 01:16:44,392
and not me.

1279
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:48,313
But all this comparing
got me nowhere and fast.

1280
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:52,359
I just spoiled good times we
could have had as brothers.

1281
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,529
And I gotta confess
I was going to trade this guy

1282
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:57,197
for the old cat bobble.

1283
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:59,115
See, he's worth
a lot of dough.

1284
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:01,868
- You can sell him.
- [Jim] Purrbles McCat?

1285
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:03,328
I'd never sell him.

1286
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,872
Audrey loves him,
so he's priceless.

1287
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,627
I haven't kept up the
collecting tradition like Dad,

1288
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:14,964
but I did buy a skater bobble
for Rosa on our first date

1289
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:17,633
and a comic book character
when Bella was born.

1290
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:20,053
So they all have
special meaning for me.

1291
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:23,848
And now this
guy will, too.

1292
01:17:26,518 --> 01:17:29,270
- Why don't you come on in?
- [laughs]

1293
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:37,237
Rosa, this is my
little brother, Earl.

1294
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,573
Nice to finally
meet you, Rosa.

1295
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:41,824
This here's Dumpster.

1296
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:44,035
The best old dog
in the whole world.

1297
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:45,412
Welcome, Earl.

1298
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:47,121
I've heard a lot
about you.

1299
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,623
Kelani, meet Deuce.

1300
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:53,545
- How about some lunch?
- Sounds great.

1301
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:55,755
Hey, Audrey,
come meet your uncle.

1302
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,173
[Audrey] I have an uncle?

1303
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:58,966
[Earl] By the way,
y'all might be low on pickles.

1304
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,843
What did I
tell you, Ikioi?

1305
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:02,845
A perfect match.

1306
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,013
Hey, guys!

1307
01:18:04,556 --> 01:18:05,806
Bobble hug!

1308
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:07,475
[all groan]

1309
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:08,976
Glad you're back, soldier.

1310
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,645
[laughs] Good to be back.

1311
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,022
Welcome to the family.

1312
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:16,692
<i>Bobble-righteous guys.
I knew you'd make a great team.</i>

1313

Well, we couldn't have
done it without you, Coach.

1314
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:21,822

do for you, Bobblehead Cher.

Just dance like there's

01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:16,670

I could do that.

- That rocks.

than fighting.

1353

And even I enjoyed myself.
Who knew?

1354
01:19:57,627 --> 01:20:00,213
Thanks for teaching us how to
dance, Bobblehead Cher.
