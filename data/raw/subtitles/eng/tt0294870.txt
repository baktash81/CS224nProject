1
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:58,307
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

2
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:04,218
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Moments so dear

3
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,157
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

4
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,359
How do you measure
Measure a year?

5
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,025
In daylights, in sunsets

6
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,468
In midnights, in cups of coffee

7
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,608
In inches, in miles

8
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,175
In laughter, in strife

9
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:30,544
In five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

10
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:35,586
How do you measure
A year in the life?

11
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:40,988
How about love?

12
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:46,360
How about love?

13
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:51,800
How about love?

14
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,941
Measure in love

15
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:02,173
Seasons of love

16
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:08,651
Seasons of love

17
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,925
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

18
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:19,863
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Journeys to plan

19
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,470
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

20
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:29,939
How do you measure
The life of a woman or a man?

21
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:35,411
In truths that she learned?
Or in times that he cried?

22
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,982
In bridges he burned?

23
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:43,384
-Or the way that she died?
-It's time now to sing out

24
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,616
Though the story never ends

25
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:51,196
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends

26
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,765
Remember the love

27
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:59,064
Oh, you got to
You got to remember the love

28
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,368
You know that love is a gift
From up above

29
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,041
Share love, give love, spread love

30
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:14,175
Measure, measure your life in love

31
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:20,156
Seasons of love

32
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,259
Seasons of love

33
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:29,197
Measure your life
Measure your life in love

34
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:54,318
December 24th, 1989, 9 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

35
00:04:55,895 --> 00:05:00,161
From here on in,
I shoot without a script.

36
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,792
See if anything comes of it...

37
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,437
...instead of my old shit.

38
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,404
No, get out of here. Hey.

39
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,344
I said, get off the window.

40
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,324
How do you document real life

41
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:34,296
When real life's getting more
Like fiction each day?

42
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,560
Headlines, bread lines
Blow my mind

43
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:41,206
And now this deadline
Eviction or pay

44
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,906
Rent

45
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,444
How do you write a song
When the chords sound wrong?

46
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,174
Though they once sounded
Right and rare

47
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,184
When the notes are sour
Where is the power

48
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,085
You once had to ignite the air?

49
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,158
-We're hungry and frozen
-Some life we've chosen

50
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:06,230
-How we gonna pay?
-How we gonna pay?

51
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,560
-How we gonna pay
-How we gonna pay

52
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,704
-Last year's rent?
-Last year's rent?

53
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,337
-HeIIo?
-Hey, guess who's back in town.

54
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,107
It's CoIIins, man.
Throw down the key. CooI.

55
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,010
Hey.

56
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,417
-You got a Iight, man?
-Yeah.

57
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,390
-Give me that shit.
-Come here, man.

58
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,763
Get that son of a bitch.

59
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,402
Pick his ass up. Come on.

60
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,349
How do you start a fire
When there's nothing to burn

61
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,715
And it feels like something's stuck
In your flue?

62
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,346
How can you generate heat
When you can't feel your feet

63
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,857
-And they're turning blue?
-And they're turning blue?

64
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,187
You light up a mean blaze

65
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,727
-With posters
-And screenplays

66
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,263
-How we gonna pay?
-How we gonna pay?

67
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,867
-How we gonna pay?
-How we gonna pay?

68
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,536
-How we gonna pay
-How we gonna pay

69
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,765
-Last year's rent?
-Last year's rent?

70
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,215
How do you stay on your feet

71
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,817
When on every street
It's trick or treat

72
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,976
And tonight it's trick?

73
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,482
Welcome back to town
Oh, I should lie down

74
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,253
Everything's brown
And, uh-oh, I feel sick

75
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,159
-Where is he?
-Getting dizzy

76
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,561
-How we gonna pay?
-How we gonna pay?

77
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,224
How we gonna pay?

78
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,928
How we gonna pay

79
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,405
Last year's rent?

80
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:01,274
The music ignites the night
With passionate fire

81
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,285
The narration crackles and pops
With incendiary wit

82
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,584
Zoom in as they burn the past
To the ground

83
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,657
And feel the heat
Of the future's glow

84
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,985
How do you leave the past behind

85
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,600
When it keeps finding ways
To get to your heart?

86
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:25,498
It reaches way down deep
And tears you inside out

87
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,004
Till you're torn apart
Rent

88
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,111
How can you connect in an age
Where strangers, landlords, lovers

89
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,146
Your own blood cells betray?

90
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,510
What binds the fabric together

91
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:44,088
When the raging, shifting winds
Of change keep ripping away?

92
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,748
Draw a line in the sand
And then make a stand

93
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,827
-Use your camera to spar
-Use your guitar

94
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,226
When they act tough
You call their bluff

95
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,026
We're not gonna pay

96
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,566
We're not gonna pay

97
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,170
We're not gonna pay

98
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,773
Last year's rent

99
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,570
This year's rent

100
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,906
Next year's rent

101
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,878
Rent, rent, rent, rent, rent

102
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,143
We're not gonna pay rent

103
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:27,029
'Cause everything is rent

104
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,714
Hey.

105
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,182
Bum.

106
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,278
Get your ass off the Range Rover.

107
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,624
Benny, that attitude toward...

108
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,193
...the homeIess is exactIy what
Maureen is protesting.

109
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,196
Maureen is protesting Iosing her
performance space...

110
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,959
...not my attitude.

111
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,501
Come down, I wanna taIk to you.

112
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:32,857
CIose-up: Benjamin Coffin III.
Our ex-roommate...

113
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,626
...who married AIIison Grey
of the Westport Greys.

114
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,829
His father-in-Iaw bought
severaI buiIdings on the bIock...

115
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,598
...and a nearby vacant Iot,
home to Tent City.

116
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,640
Benny hopes to evict aII
of the homeIess from Tent City...

117
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,243
...and buiId a cyber studio.

118
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:50,212
Roger, you're Iooking good for a guy
coming off of a year of withdrawaI.

119
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,011
-What do you want, Benny?
-WeII, my investor--

120
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,483
-You mean, your father-in-Iaw?
-Right.

121
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,123
Read about Maureen's performance
in the Village Voice.

122
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,020
Got pissed and sent me down here
to coIIect the rent.

123
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,424
-What rent?
-This past year's rent, which I Iet sIide.

124
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,757
You said we were goIden.

125
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,161
-When you bought the buiIding.
-We were roommates.

126
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,427
-Remember, you Iived here?
-How couId I forget?

127
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,503
You, me, CoIIins and Maureen.

128
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,231
How is the drama queen?

129
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,239
-She's getting ready for a performance.
-I know.

130
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,437
-StiII her production manager?
-Not exactIy.

131
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,674
-StiII dating her?
-I was dumped.

132
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,946
-She got a new man?
-WeII....

133
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,883
-No.
-What's his name?

134
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,920
-Joanne.
-Joanne.

135
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,960
Thanks for being so understanding.

136
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,725
You expect sympathy
from the guy...

137
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,835
...who shut off our power
on Christmas Eve?

138
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,173
Got your attention, didn't it?

139
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,076
What happened to Benny?

140
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:57,546
What happened to his heart
And the ideals he once pursued?

141
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:04,486
Any owner of that lot next door
Has a right to do with it as he pleases

142
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,420
Happy birthday, Jesus

143
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,389
-The rent
-You're wasting your time

144
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,621
-We're broke
-You broke your word, this is absurd

145
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,061
There is one way
You won't have to pay

146
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,168
-I knew it.
-Next door, the home of CyberArts

147
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:22,865
And now that the block is rezoned
Our dream can become a reality

148
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:27,569
You'll see, boys

149
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,480
You'll see, boys

150
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:36,883
A state-of-the-art, digital,
Virtual interactive studio

151
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,685
I'll forgo your rent
And on paper guarantee

152
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,488
That you can stay here for free

153
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,631
-If you do me one smaII favor.
-What?

154
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,630
Convince Maureen
to canceI her protest.

155
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,302
Why not just get an injunction
or caII the cops?

156
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,438
I did, and they're on standby.

157
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:58,543
But my investors would rather
I handle this quietly

158
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,974
You can't quietIy wipe out
an entire tent city...

159
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,047
...then watch It's A Wonderful Life
on TV.

160
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,944
You wanna produce fiIms
and write songs?

161
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,584
You need somewhere to do it

162
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:10,950
It's what we used to dream about
Think twice before you pooh-pooh it

163
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,456
You'll see, boys

164
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,695
You'll see, boys

165
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:24,131
You'll see the beauty of a studio

166
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,432
That lets us do our work
And get paid

167
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,771
With condos on the top
Whose rent keeps open our shop

168
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:36,881
Just stop the protest
And you'll have it made

169
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,540
You'll see

170
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,686
Or you'II pack.

171
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,195
Here you go.

172
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,338
Merry Christmas.

173
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,487
HeIIo?

174
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,870
Oh, my God. You okay, honey?

175
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,238
-I'm afraid so.
-Did they get anything, or...?

176
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,505
I didn't have any money,
but they took my stuff.

177
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,247
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

178
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,954
I'm AngeI.

179
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,825
AngeI?

180
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,693
Friends caII me CoIIins.

181
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,398
Tom. Tom CoIIins.

182
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,533
Come on. Let's get you cIeaned up.

183
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,474
I sort of have to hurry.

184
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,137
-I have a Life Support meeting.
-Life Support?

185
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,274
Yeah.

186
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,509
It's for peopIe with AIDS.

187
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,517
PeopIe Iike me.

188
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,951
Me too.

189
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,329
I was gonna go try to find CoIIins.

190
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,470
You wanna come?

191
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,473
I thought maybe we couId aII grab
some dinner.

192
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,076
Zoom in on my empty waIIet.

193
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,110
Touch?.

194
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,977
Take your AZT.

195
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:06,231
I'm writing one great song
Before I....

196
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,224
One song
Glory

197
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,024
One song before I go

198
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:20,171
Glory
One song to leave behind

199
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,970
Find one song

200
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,837
One last refrain

201
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,572
Glory
From the pretty-boy front man

202
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,948
Who wasted opportunity

203
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,385
One song
He had the world at his feet

204
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:43,494
Glory
In the eyes of a young girl

205
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,458
A young girl

206
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,497
Find glory

207
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,760
Beyond the cheap colored lights

208
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,404
One song
Before the sun sets

209
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,404
Glory

210
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:01,740
On another empty life

211
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,042
Time flies

212
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:10,382
Time dies

213
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:15,960
Glory

214
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:22,757
One blaze of glory

215
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:29,464
One blaze of glory

216
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:36,745
Glory

217
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,850
Find glory

218
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:44,978
In a song that rings true
Truth like a blazing fire

219
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,385
An eternal flame

220
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,856
Find one song

221
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,523
A song about love
Glory

222
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,898
From the soul of a young man

223
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,873
A young man

224
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:08,445
Find the one song
Before the virus takes hold

225
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,344
Glory
Like a sunset

226
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:18,281
One song
To redeem this empty life

227
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,622
Time flies

228
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,524
And then no need
To endure anymore

229
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:31,101
Time dies

230
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,812
-What'd you forget?
-Got a light?

231
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,280
I know you, you're--

232
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,975
You're shivering

233
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,384
It's nothing
They turned off my heat

234
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:33,130
And I'm just a little weak on my feet
Would you light my candle?

235
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,729
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing

236
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,462
Your hair in the moonlight

237
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,864
You look familiar

238
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,240
-Can you make it?
-Just haven't eaten much today

239
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:53,043
At least the room
Stopped spinning anyway

240
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,152
-What?
-Nothing

241
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,654
-Your smile reminded me of--
-I always ''remind people of''

242
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,725
-Who is she?
-She died

243
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:05,124
-Her name was April
-It's out again

244
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:13,703
Sorry 'bout your friend
Would you light my candle?

245
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,531
-Well?
-Yeah?

246
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,973
Oh, the wax

247
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,409
-It's--
-Dripping

248
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,744
-I like it between my--
-Fingers

249
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,214
I figured

250
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,149
Oh, well, good night

251
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:41,360
-It blew out again?
-No, I think that I dropped my stash

252
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,366
I know I've seen you out and about

253
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,298
When I used to go out

254
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,463
Your candle's out

255
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,605
I'm illin'
I had it when I walked in the door

256
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,947
It was pure
Is it on the floor?

257
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,244
The floor?

258
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:02,379
They say that I have the best ass
Below 1 4th Street

259
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,852
-Is it true?
-What?

260
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,548
-You're staring again
-Oh, no

261
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,921
I mean, you do have a nice--

262
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,093
I mean, you look familiar

263
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,563
-Like your dead girlfriend
-Only when you smile

264
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,362
But I'm sure I've seen you
Somewhere else

265
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,563
Do you go to the Cat Scratch Club?
That's where I work

266
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,264
I dance

267
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,577
Yes
They used to tie you up

268
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,111
It's a living

269
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,409
I didn't recognize you
Without the handcuffs

270
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:39,114
We could light the candle

271
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:46,288
Oh, won't you light the candle?

272
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,362
Why don't you forget that stuff

273
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,471
-You look like you're 16
-I'm 19

274
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,871
But I'm old for my age
I'm just born to be bad

275
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:03,811
I once was born to be bad
I used to shiver like that

276
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,212
-I have no heat, I told you
-I used to sweat

277
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,955
-I got a cold
-Uh-huh, I used to be a junkie

278
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,981
-But now and then I like to feel good
-Uh-huh

279
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,682
-Oh, here
-What's that?

280
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,589
Candy-bar wrapper.

281
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:21,825
We could light the candle

282
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:30,835
Oh, what'd you do with my candle?

283
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:36,480
-That was my last match
-Our eyes'll adjust

284
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:41,142
-Thank God for the moon
-Maybe it's not the moon at all

285
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,486
I hear Spike Lee's shootin'
Down the street

286
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,556
Bah humbug

287
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,319
Bah humbug

288
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,589
-Cold hands
-Yours too

289
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,928
Big
Like my father's

290
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,103
Do you wanna dance?

291
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,037
With you?

292
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:06,438
-No, with my father
-I'm Roger

293
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,545
They call me

294
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:13,616
They call me Mimi

295
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,150
We got power.

296
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,808
Merry Christmas.

297
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,817
-Speak.
-Speak.

298
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,853
Mark, are you there?

299
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,890
Are you screening your calls?
It's Mom.

300
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,621
I just wanted to call and say
we love you. We'll miss you today.

301
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,958
Cindy and the kids are here.
They send their love.

302
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,533
Hope you like the hot plate. Don't
leave it on when you leave the house.

303
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,636
-Honey, give me the phone.
-Oh, here's Dad.

304
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,774
Listen, Mark, I'm sorry to hear
that Maureen dumped you.

305
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:13,468
I say, c'est la vie.
Let her be a lesbian.

306
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,840
She doesn't know
what she's missing.

307
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,879
Happy holidays.

308
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,242
You know...

309
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,213
...there are times
when we're dirt broke...

310
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,950
...and hungry and freezing...

311
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:32,756
...and I ask myseIf,
''Why the heII am I stiII Iiving here?''

312
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,658
And then they caII.
And I remember.

313
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,273
What's that?

314
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,673
The girI downstairs.

315
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,114
Oh, the dancer
from the Cat Scratch CIub?

316
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,552
-WeII, you are going, right?
-No.

317
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,690
-Oh, come on, Roger.
-No.

318
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,186
-Merry Christmas, bitches.
-Hey, CoIIins.

319
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,195
-Your keys.
-Yeah, 1 4 hours Iater.

320
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,992
What the heII happened to you?
Are you aII right?

321
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,293
I've never been better. Here.

322
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,697
Oh, hi.

323
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,704
-''Oh, hi.'' After seven months?
-I'm sorry.

324
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:20,572
You know what you need?
This boy couId use...

325
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,044
-...some StoIi.
-This is a compIete Christmas feast.

326
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,385
-Thank you.
-You struck goId at MIT.

327
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,046
No.

328
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,915
They expeIIed me for my theory
of actuaI reaIity.

329
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,559
One for you. One for you.

330
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,126
Oh, wait.

331
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,530
For me.

332
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,064
So I came back home.
Merry Christmas.

333
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,168
-Cheers.
-WeIcome home.

334
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,362
I got a teaching gig at NYU.

335
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,803
Oh, so that's how you can afford
to spIurge on us.

336
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,841
No. Sit down.

337
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,404
Gentlemen, our benefactor
On this Christmas day

338
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:02,644
Whose charity is only matched
By talent, I must say

339
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:06,780
A new member of the Alphabet City
Avant-garde

340
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:15,024
Angel Dumott Schunard

341
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,931
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

342
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,907
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

343
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,744
-And you should hear her beat
-You earned this on the street?

344
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:37,376
It was my lucky day today
On Avenue A

345
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,752
When a lady in a limousine
Drove my way

346
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,486
She said, ''Darling, be a dear
Haven't slept in a year

347
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,531
I need your help to make my
Neighbor's yappy dog disappear

348
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:54,764
This Akita, Evita, just won't shut up
I believe if you play nonstop

349
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:59,171
That pup will breathe its very last
High-strung breath

350
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:03,138
I'm certain that cur
Will bark itself to death''

351
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,750
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

352
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,088
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

353
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:14,718
We agreed on a fee
$1000 guarantee, tax free

354
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,623
And a bonus if I trim her tree

355
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:21,357
Now, who could foretell
That it would go so well?

356
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,627
But sure as I am here
That dog is now in doggy hell

357
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,203
After an hour, Evita, in all her glory

358
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,370
On the window ledge
Of that 23rd story

359
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,809
Like Thelma and Louise did
When they got the blues

360
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,541
Swan-dove into the courtyard
Of the Gracie Mews

361
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,154
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

362
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,484
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

363
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,538
Back on the street
Where I met my sweet

364
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:08,702
Where he was moaning and groaning
On the cold concrete

365
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,281
The nurse took him home
For some Mercurochrome

366
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,419
Then I dressed his wounds
And got him back on his feet

367
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,555
Sing it
Today for you

368
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,553
Tomorrow for me

369
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,625
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

370
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,160
I say
Today for you

371
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,390
Tomorrow for me
Today for you

372
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:33,265
Tomorrow

373
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,567
For me

374
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,402
That was dope.

375
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,973
That was fresh.

376
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,811
-Speak.
-Speak.

377
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,146
Mark. Hi.

378
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,551
It's me. Maureen.
Look, I have a bit of a problem.

379
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,723
I really need your help.

380
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,158
I hired Joanne
as my production manager...

381
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,957
...and I don't think she knows
what the hell she's doing.

382
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,168
If you could just-- Please, baby,
come to the performance space.

383
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,998
-Hey, Maureen. Hi.
-Hi, baby.

384
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,264
-Sure, I'II be there.
-Thank you.

385
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,203
-Okay.
-Thank you.

386
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,071
Okay, see you soon.

387
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,771
Can you beIieve her?
I mean, first she just dumps me--

388
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,347
-Maureen dumped you?
-Yes. She dumped me.

389
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,984
For a Iawyer named Joanne.

390
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,822
Now she wants me to heIp her
fix her sound equipment.

391
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:32,019
-WeII, Mark, you couId've said no.
-I know, but....

392
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,223
-That's cute. You stiII Iove her.
-Yeah, right.

393
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,594
You do.

394
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,865
-We have to go.
-Wanna go to this gathering?

395
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,542
-Where?
-Life Support.

396
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:46,835
On Christmas?

397
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,605
Some peopIe don't have
anywhere eIse to go today.

398
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,214
You shouId come.

399
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,248
Knock yourseIves out.

400
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,520
Everyone's weIcome.
It's not just for peopIe with AIDS.

401
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,180
Okay, yeah, I'II be there,
but first I got a protest to save.

402
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,859
See? ToId you.

403
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,599
I'm just pIaying with you, boy.

404
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,894
WeII, it's Christmas.

405
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,470
Don't stay in the house aII day.

406
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,335
Bye.

407
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,579
Hi.

408
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:06,681
Maureen caIIed me to try to come
heIp fix the equipment.

409
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,621
You're Mark?

410
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,224
Joanne?

411
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:25,106
-Maureen said she'd be here.
-WeII, don't hoId your breath.

412
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,744
This is so typicaI.

413
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,972
I toId her not to caII you.

414
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,414
Oh, weII--

415
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,182
Can I heIp anyway?

416
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,788
I've hired an engineer.

417
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,822
Great.

418
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,126
WeII, nice to have met you, then.

419
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,729
He's three hours Iate.

420
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,673
The samples won't delay
But the cable--

421
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,902
There's another way
Say something, anything

422
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,274
Test, one, two, three

423
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,041
Anything but that

424
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,813
-This is weird
-It's weird

425
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,717
-Very weird
-Fuckin' weird

426
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,484
I'm so mad that
I don't know what to do

427
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,255
Fighting with microphones
Freezing down to my bones

428
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,627
And to top it all off
I'm with you

429
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:26,796
Feel like going insane?
Got a fire in your brain?

430
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,463
And you're thinking
Of drinking gasoline?

431
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:34,542
-As a matter of fact
-Honey, I know this act

432
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,613
It's called the Tango: Maureen

433
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,777
The Tango: Maureen

434
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:45,389
It's a dark, dizzy merry-go-round

435
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:49,287
-As she keeps you dangling
-You're wrong

436
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,055
-Your heart she is mangling
-It's different with me

437
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,926
And you toss and you turn

438
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,794
'Cause her cold eyes can burn

439
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:00,027
Yet you yearn, and you churn
And rebound

440
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,474
I think I know what you mean

441
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:07,975
-The Tango: Maureen
-The Tango: Maureen

442
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:14,142
Has she ever pouted her lips
And called you ''pookie'"?

443
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,580
Never.

444
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,120
Have you ever
Doubted a kiss or two?

445
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,986
This is spooky

446
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,855
Did you swoon
When she walked through the door?

447
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,659
Every time, so be cautious

448
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,362
Did she moon over other boys?

449
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,098
-More than moon
-I'm getting nauseous

450
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,200
Where'd you Iearn to tango?

451
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:11,967
With the French ambassador's
daughter in her room at Miss Porter's.

452
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,610
And you?

453
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,143
With Nanette HimmeIfarb,
the rabbi's daughter...

454
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,010
...at the ScarsdaIe Jewish
Community Center.

455
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,119
It's hard to do this backwards.

456
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,055
You shouId try it in heeIs.

457
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,682
-She cheated
-She cheated

458
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,682
-Maureen cheated
-Fuckin' cheated

459
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:59,557
I'm defeated
I should give up right now

460
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:03,049
Gotta look on the bright side
With all of your might

461
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:06,788
I'd fall for her still, anyhow

462
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:10,866
When you're dancing her dance
You don't stand a chance

463
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,401
Her grip of romance makes you fall

464
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:18,201
-So you think, ''Might as well''
-''Dance a tango to hell''

465
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,470
''At least I'll have tangoed at all''

466
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:25,640
The Tango: Maureen

467
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:29,411
Gotta dance till your diva is through

468
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,988
You pretend to believe her

469
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,923
'Cause in the end
You can't leave her

470
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,689
But the end, it will come
Still you have to play dumb

471
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,629
Till you're glum and you bum
And turn blue

472
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:48,029
Why do we love when she's mean?

473
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,675
And she can be so obscene

474
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,771
My Maureen

475
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,353
The Tango:

476
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:09,016
Maureen

477
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,222
Mark.

478
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,357
Mark.

479
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:18,427
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

480
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,068
ActuaIIy...

481
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,469
...I feeI great now.

482
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,635
I feeI Iousy.

483
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,812
And we're patched.

484
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,513
Thanks.

485
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,923
-Maureen?
-Hi, baby.

486
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,562
-Hi, honey, we're--
-Pookie.

487
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,357
''Pookie''?

488
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,761
-You never caIIed me pook--
-We're late.

489
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,637
Forget it.

490
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,535
-We're patched.
-Thank you.

491
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,938
Pookie.

492
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,974
Shut up.

493
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,808
Okay, everyone, Iet's begin.

494
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,278
First, I just want to weIcome you aII.

495
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:43,109
Why don't we start by going
around and introducing ourseIves.

496
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,084
Steve.

497
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,047
Gordon.

498
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,851
AIi.

499
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,794
Pam.

500
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,451
Sue.

501
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,722
Hi.

502
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,497
I'm AngeI.

503
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,501
Tom.

504
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,160
CoIIins.

505
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,038
I'm PauI.

506
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,640
Sorry.

507
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,777
Excuse me.

508
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,548
And you are...?

509
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:16,278
Oh, I'm not--
I don't have--

510
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,955
I'm here with....

511
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,695
I'm just here to....

512
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,762
Mark.

513
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,198
Mark. I'm Mark.

514
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,900
WeII, this is quite an operation.

515
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,006
Does anyone have a probIem...

516
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,674
...if I fiIm a IittIe of this
for a documentary?

517
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,924
Make yourseIf comfortabIe, Mark.

518
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,232
Who wants to begin?

519
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,603
WeII, I'm--

520
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,607
Yesterday...

521
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,844
...I found out my T ceIIs were Iow.

522
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,211
What was your reaction?

523
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,319
Scared.

524
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,148
How are you feeIing today?
Right now?

525
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,783
Okay.

526
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,453
AII right.

527
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,755
Pretty good.

528
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,829
Is that aII?

529
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,538
It's the best I've feIt in a Iong time.

530
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:47,310
-Months.
-Then why choose fear?

531
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,074
I'm a New Yorker.

532
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,078
Fear's my Iife.

533
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:03,720
Look, I find
Some of what you teach suspect

534
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:07,352
Because I'm used to
Relying on intellect

535
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,989
But I try to open up
To what I don't know

536
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:15,639
Because reason says
I should have died

537
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,708
Three years ago

538
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,846
There's only us

539
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,540
There's only this

540
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,652
Forget regret

541
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,816
Or life is yours to miss

542
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,221
No other road

543
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,920
No other way

544
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:46,036
No day but today

545
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,562
What's the time?

546
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,339
Well, it's gotta be close to midnight

547
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:28,039
My body's talking to me
It says, ''Time for danger''

548
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,109
It says, ''I wanna commit a crime

549
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,912
Wanna be the cause of a fight

550
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,680
I wanna put on a tight skirt

551
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,757
And flirt with a stranger''

552
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,653
I've had a knack from way back

553
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,731
At breaking the rules
Once I learn the game

554
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,131
Get up, life's too quick
I know someplace sick

555
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:57,330
Where this chick'll
Dance in the flames

556
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,635
We don't need any money

557
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,746
I always get in for free

558
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,109
You can get in too

559
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,878
If you get in with me

560
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,749
Let's go

561
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:15,653
Out tonight

562
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,260
I have to go

563
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:22,628
Out tonight

564
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,832
You wanna play?
Let's run away

565
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:32,441
We won't be back
Before it's New Year's Day

566
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,977
Take me out tonight

567
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,412
Meow.

568
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,684
Yeah

569
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,158
When I get a wink
From the doorman

570
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,590
Do you know how lucky you'll be?

571
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,620
That you're on the line

572
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:58,097
With the feline of Avenue B

573
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,564
Let's go

574
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,001
Out tonight

575
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,038
I have to go

576
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:10,703
Out tonight

577
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:16,649
You wanna prowl?
Be my night owl?

578
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,084
Well, take my hand we're gonna

579
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,486
Howl

580
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,059
Out tonight

581
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,198
In the evening I've got to roam

582
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,837
Can't sleep in the city
Of neon and chrome

583
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,465
Feels too damn much like home

584
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:41,111
When the Spanish babies cry

585
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,673
So let's find a bar

586
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,442
So dark we forget who we are

587
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:53,523
Where all the scars
From the nevers and maybes die

588
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,454
Let's go

589
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,858
Out tonight

590
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,489
I have to go

591
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,034
Out tonight

592
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,397
You're sweet
Wanna hit the street?

593
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:14,839
Wanna wail at the moon
Like a cat in heat?

594
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,877
Just take me

595
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,777
Out tonight

596
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,882
Please take me

597
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,716
Out tonight

598
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,022
Don't forsake me

599
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,686
Out tonight

600
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,093
I'll let you make me

601
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:40,702
Out tonight

602
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,065
Tonight

603
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,138
Tonight

604
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,434
Tonight

605
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,851
Who do you think you are?

606
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:57,343
Barging in on me and my guitar

607
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:00,285
Little girl, hey, the door is that way

608
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,722
You better go
You know the fire's out anyway

609
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:06,761
Take your powder
Take your candle

610
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,263
Your sweet whisper
I just can't handle

611
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,300
Well, take your hair
In the moonlight

612
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:19,266
Your brown eyes
Goodbye, good night

613
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,740
I should tell you
I should tell you

614
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,642
I should tell you, I should--
No.

615
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,375
Another time, another place

616
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:31,351
Our temperature would climb
There'd be a long embrace

617
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,491
We'd do another dance
It'd be another play

618
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,125
Looking for romance?

619
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:40,252
Come back another day

620
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:44,460
Another day

621
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:48,168
The heart may freeze

622
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,774
Or it can burn

623
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,911
The pain will ease

624
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,405
If I can learn

625
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,813
There is no future

626
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,011
There is no past

627
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,317
I live this moment as

628
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,258
My last

629
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,761
There's only us

630
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,536
There's only this

631
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,835
Forget regret

632
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,770
Or life is yours to miss

633
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:29,538
No other road

634
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:32,978
No other way

635
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:38,645
No day but today

636
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,518
Excuse me if I'm off track

637
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,683
But if you're so wise
Then tell me

638
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,556
Why do you need smack?

639
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:46,991
Take your needle

640
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,859
Take your fancy prayer

641
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,160
Don't forget,
Get the moonlight out of your hair

642
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,837
Long ago you might have
Lit up my heart

643
00:47:55,005 --> 00:48:00,375
But the fire's dead
Ain't never ever gonna start

644
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:04,041
Another time
Another place

645
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,809
The words would only rhyme
We'd be in outer space

646
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:11,148
It'd be another song
We'd sing another way

647
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:16,725
You wanna prove me wrong?
Come back another day

648
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,929
Another day

649
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:25,591
There's only yes

650
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:28,965
Only tonight

651
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:32,335
We must let go

652
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,410
To know what's right

653
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,140
No other course

654
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:42,513
No other way

655
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:48,852
No day but today

656
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:52,553
I can't control

657
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:55,562
Control your temper

658
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:59,691
My destiny

659
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,202
She doesn't see

660
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,170
I trust my soul

661
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:09,301
-Who says that there's a soul?
-My only goal

662
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:13,506
Is just to be

663
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,549
Just let me be

664
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:22,215
-Who do you think you are?
-There's only now, there's only here

665
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:28,763
-Barging in on me and my guitar
-Give in to love, or live in fear

666
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,765
-Little girl, hey
-No other path

667
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:36,238
-The door is that way
-No other way

668
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,643
No day but today

669
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,237
The fire's out anyway

670
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,937
No day but today

671
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,812
Take your powder
Take your candle

672
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,682
No day but today

673
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:55,518
Take your brown eyes,
Your pretty smile, your silhouette

674
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,922
No day but today

675
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:02,532
Another time, another place,
Another rhyme, a warm embrace

676
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,563
No day but today

677
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,829
Another dance,
Another way, another chance

678
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,235
Another day

679
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:18,371
No day but today

680
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,331
-Speak.
-Speak.

681
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,840
Mark, Roger, it's Benny.

682
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,014
Look, you still got a few hours
to stop Maureen's protest.

683
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,206
My offer expires after dark.

684
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,372
Hey.

685
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,477
How you doing?

686
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,089
-Look, about Iast night--
-I don't wanna taIk about it.

687
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,628
You know, Mimi's gonna be
at Maureen's show tonight.

688
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,698
You shouId come too.

689
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,537
I'd hate to see you pass up
something that couId be good for you.

690
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,499
You'II onIy regret it.

691
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,537
I'II Iive.

692
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,405
Right.

693
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,316
Will I lose my dignity?

694
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:07,355
Will someone care?

695
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:11,426
Will I wake tomorrow

696
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:18,228
From this nightmare?

697
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:22,895
Will I lose my dignity?

698
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:29,067
Will someone care?

699
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,875
Will I wake tomorrow

700
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:40,012
From this nightmare?

701
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,388
-Will I lose my dignity?
-Will I lose my dignity?

702
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,354
Will someone care?

703
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,898
Will someone care?

704
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:54,628
-Will I wake tomorrow
-Will I wake tomorrow

705
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:01,676
-From this nightmare?
-From this nightmare?

706
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:06,179
-Will I lose my dignity?
-Will I lose my dignity?

707
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:11,787
-Will someone care?
-Will I lose my dignity?

708
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:16,255
-Will I wake tomorrow
-Will someone care?

709
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:22,922
-From this nightmare?
-Will I wake tomorrow

710
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,590
-Will I lose my dignity?
-From this nightmare?

711
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,236
Will I lose my dignity?

712
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:33,536
-Will someone care?
-Will I lose my dignity?

713
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,840
-Will I wake tomorrow
-Will someone care?

714
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:42,110
-From this nightmare?
-Will I wake tomorrow

715
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,810
From this nightmare?

716
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:49,049
-Will I lose my dignity?
-Will I lose?

717
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:55,324
Will someone care?

718
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:59,400
Will I wake tomorrow

719
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:07,942
From this nightmare?

720
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,150
I am so gIad you came, man.

721
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,920
-I'm proud of you.
-Thanks.

722
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,088
Come on, get up.

723
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,295
Come on, Iet's go.

724
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,432
-Wake up.
-This ain't a campground.

725
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:34,626
Let's go. You gotta go.

726
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,432
Christ, it's a Iady.
Come on, ma'am, you gotta get up.

727
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,609
SmiIe for Ted KoppeI, officers.

728
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:44,636
Who do you think you are?

729
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,338
I don't need no goddamn heIp...

730
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,677
...from some
bIeeding-heart cameraman.

731
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,446
My Iife's not for you to make
a name for yourseIf on.

732
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,680
Easy, sugar, easy.
He was just trying--

733
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,984
Just trying to use me
to kiII his guiIt.

734
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,593
It's not that kind of movie, honey.

735
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:01,162
This pIace is fuII of artists.

736
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,131
Hey, artist, you got a doIIar?

737
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,104
Didn't think so.

738
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,087
New York City

739
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,519
-Center of the universe
-Sing it, girI.

740
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,717
Times are shitty, but I'm pretty sure
They can't get worse

741
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,692
-I hear that.
-It's a comfort to know

742
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:36,127
When you're singing
The hit-the-road blues

743
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:41,259
That anywhere else you could
Possibly go after New York would be

744
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,571
A pleasure cruise

745
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,072
Now you're taIking.

746
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,458
Well, I'm thwarted by a
Metaphysic puzzle

747
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:09,593
And I'm sick of grading papers,
That I know

748
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:13,962
I'm shouting in my sleep
I need a muzzle

749
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:19,472
And all this misery pays no salary
So

750
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:24,272
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

751
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:28,611
Sunny Santa Fe would be nice

752
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:33,017
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

753
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:37,922
And leave this
To the roaches and mice

754
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,977
-You teach?
-Yeah, I teach.

755
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,137
Computer Age PhiIosophy.

756
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,748
When my students
wouId rather watch TV.

757
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,942
-America.
-America.

758
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,950
You're a sensitive aesthete

759
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,589
Brush the sauce onto the meat

760
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:11,090
You can make the menu
Sparkle with a rhyme

761
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,960
You can drum a gentle drum

762
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,360
I can seat guests as they come

763
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:21,266
Chatting not about Heidegger,
But wine

764
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:25,237
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

765
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:28,707
-Santa Fe
-Our labors would reap financial gain

766
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:29,879
-Gain
-Gain

767
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,569
-Gain
-We'll open up

768
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,216
A restaurant in Santa Fe

769
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:37,512
-Santa Fe
-And save from devastation our brains

770
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,120
Save our brains

771
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:44,226
We'll pack up all ourjunk
And fly so far away

772
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:48,956
Devote ourselves to projects
That sell

773
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:53,330
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

774
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:57,905
Forget this cold bohemian hell

775
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:28,132
Do you know the way
To Santa Fe?

776
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,171
You know, tumbleweeds

777
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,969
Prairie dogs

778
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,071
Yeah

779
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,644
Oh, guys, I'm Iate for Maureen's
sound check. I gotta go.

780
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,653
-Here, you can heIp me.
-Bye.

781
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,314
See you Iater.

782
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,690
It's coId.

783
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,327
Come on.

784
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,262
Live in my house

785
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:05,430
I'll be your shelter

786
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:10,136
Just pay me back
With 1000 kisses

787
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,644
Be my lover

788
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:18,318
I'll cover you

789
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:22,652
Open your door
I'll be your tenant

790
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:26,818
Don't got much baggage
To lay at your feet

791
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:30,625
But sweet kisses I've got to spare

792
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,998
I'll be there and I'll cover you

793
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,264
-I think they meant it
-I think they meant it

794
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,567
-When they said you can't buy love
-When they said you can't buy love

795
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,767
-Now I know you can rent it
-Now I know you can rent it

796
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,276
-A new lease you are, my love
-A new lease you are, my love

797
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:47,541

01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,524
-Just slip me on
-Just slip me on

800
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,533
-I'll be your blanket
-I'll be your blanket

801
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,670
-Wherever, whatever
-Wherever, whatever

802
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,737
-I'll be your coat
-I'll be your coat

803
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:13,899
You'll be my king
And I'll be your castle

804
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:18,672
No, you'll be my queen
And I'll be your moat

805
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,712
-I think they meant it
-I think they meant it

806
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,874
-When they said you can't buy love
-When they said you can't buy love

807
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,247
-Now I know you can rent it

808
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,616

01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,026
-All my life
-All my life

811
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,899
-I've longed to discover
-I've longed to discover

812
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:43,334
-Something as true as this is
-Something as true as this is

813
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:47,943
-So with a thousand sweet kisses
-When you're cold and you're lonely

814
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,204
I'll cover you
With a thousand sweet kisses

815
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,574
-You've got one nickel only
-I'll cover you

816
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,376
With a thousand sweet kisses

817
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,144
-When you're worn out and tired
-I'll cover you

818
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,844
With a thousand sweet kisses

819
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:01,149
-When your heart has expired
-I'll cover you

820
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,725
-Oh, lover

01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,298

829
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:54,439
Hey. Lover boy. You steaI
my cIient, you die.

830
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,703
You didn't miss me,
you won't miss her.

831
01:01:56,913 --> 01:02:00,041
Look around.
Got pIenty of customers.

832
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,455
Look.

833
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:12,525
About Iast night, I'm sorry.

834
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,697
-I don't know what the--
-Just forget it.

835
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:19,699
I was out of Iine.
Can I make it up to you?

836
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,099
How?

837
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,398
Bunch of us
are getting together tonight.

838
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,666
At the Life Caf?
after Maureen's show.

839
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,468
Yeah?

840
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,110
WouId you Iike to come with me?

841
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,785
Sure. I'd Iike that.

842
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,059
So you're a tough guy?

843
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,228
No. Not reaIIy.

844
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,263
That's pretty good.

845
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,669
Over there.
The guy with the gIasses.

846
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,311
Right there.

847
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,845
-AngeI.
-Mimi.

848
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,812
Oh, my God, you Iook so good.

849
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:58,332
Maureen! Maureen! Maureen!

850
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,744
Last night I had a dream.

851
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:21,387
I found myseIf in a desert
caIIed CyberIand.

852
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,785
It was hot.

853
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,189
My canteen had sprung a Ieak,
and I was...

854
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,990
...thirsty.

855
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:31,497
Out of the abyss waIked a cow.

856
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:32,895
EIsie.

857
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:36,500
I asked if she had anything to drink.
She said:

858
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:43,305
''I'm forbidden to produce milk

859
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:47,812
In Cyberland we only drink

860
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,350
Diet Coke''

861
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:54,784
She said:

862
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,959
''Only thing to do

863
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:03,690
Is jump over the moon''

864
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:10,739
I

865
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,239
Gotta get out of here

866
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:18,874
It's like I'm being tied to the hood
Of a yellow rental truck

867
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:23,314
Being packed in
With fertilizer and fuel oil

868
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:28,583
Pushed over a cliff
By a suicidal Mickey Mouse

869
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:34,493
I've

870
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:40,500
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

871
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,536
Gotta, gotta find a way

872
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:50,175
To jump over the moon

873
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:55,511
Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon

874
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:58,153
Yeah! Go, Maureen!

875
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:02,118
Then a IittIe buIIdog entered.

876
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,920
His name, we have Iearned,
was Benny.

877
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,965
And aIthough he once
had principIes...

878
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,034
...he abandoned them
to Iive as a Iapdog...

879
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,671
...to a weaIthy daughter
of the revoIution.

880
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:20,937
A one, two, three
''That's bull,'' he said

881
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:26,677
''Ever since the cat took up the fiddle
That cow's been jumpy

882
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:30,717
The dish and the spoon were evicted
From the table and eloped

883
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:33,912
She's had trouble with that milk
And the moon ever since

884
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,718
Maybe it's a female thing

885
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:41,124
'Cause who'd wanna leave
Cyberland anyway?

886
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,889
Walls ain't so bad

887
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,966
The dish and the spoon, for instance,
They're down on their luck

888
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,160
They come knockin'
On my doghouse door

889
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,601
And I say,
'Not in my back yard, utensils.

890
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,467
Go back to China'''

891
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,378
''The onIy way out is up,''
EIsie whispered to me.

892
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:02,950
''A leap

893
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,215
Of faith''

894
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:09,785
-Yeah.
-That's it.

895
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,483
''StiII thirsty?''

896
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:14,528
''Parched.''

897
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,959
''Have some miIk.''

898
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:25,139
And I Iowered myseIf
beneath her swoIIen udder...

899
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:30,479
...and I sucked the sweetest miIk
I had ever tasted.

900
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,889
''CIimb onboard,'' she said.

901
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,722
And as a harvest moon
rose over CyberIand...

902
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:50,161
...we reared back,
we sprang into a gaIIop...

903
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,194
...Ieaping out of orbit.

904
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,338
I awoke, singing...

905
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:03,442
Leap of faith
Leap of faith

906
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,842
Leap of faith
Leap of faith

907
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,506
Only thing to do

908
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,452
Only thing to do is jump

909
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:17,422
Only thing to do is
Jump over the moon

910
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:23,031
Only thing to do is
Jump over the moon

911
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,827
Over the moon

912
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:31,268
Over the....

913
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,281
Moo with me.

914
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,183
Yes. Who is that? Come on.
Moo with me.

01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,220
Yes. Come on, sir.

916

Don't be shy. Let it go. Moo with me.

01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,522
Let it rip.

918
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,330
Yes. Let it go, New York City.

919
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,028
Yeah.

920
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:14,176
Hey, get off, man.

Hey, hey, hey. Guys, it's okay.

Benny got exactIy what he wanted.

940
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,348
He screws up my show,
he gets aII these peopIe arrested.

941
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:23,451
Cops won't hoId them for Iong.

You sit here aII night,

964
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,607
That's a Iie. Last week I had a tea.

965
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:28,344

974
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,439
Benjamin Coffin III.

975
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,172
The enemy of Avenue A.

976
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,750
You got a whoIe Iot of nerve
showing your face here...

977
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:05,819
...after what just happened.

978
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,014
Listen, guys, this was not my fauIt.

01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:10,419
-Go to heII.
-Jerk.

980
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:11,820
You put the cops on standby.

981
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,827
-I didn't want it to get out of controI.
-Why did Muffy--

982
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,225
AIIison.

01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:19,727
--miss the show?

984
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,463
There....
There was a death in the famiIy.

985
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,032
Who died?

986
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,070
Our Akita.

987
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:30,305
-Evita.
-Evita.

988
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:38,181
You make fun

989
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:42,313
Yet I'm the one
Attempting to do some good

990
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,982
Or do you really want
A neighborhood

991
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,493
Where people piss
On your stoop every night?

992
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:54,330
Bohemia
Bohemia's a fallacy in your head

993
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,636
This is Calcutta

994
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:59,636
Bohemia is dead

995
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:07,805
Dearly beloved

996
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:15,889
We gather here
To say our goodbyes

997
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:22,427
Here she lies

998
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:26,090
No one knew her worth

999
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:31,729
The late, great daughter
Of Mother Earth

1000
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:37,675
On these nights
When we celebrate the birth

1001
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:42,340
In that little town of Bethlehem

1002
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:47,478
We raise our glass
You bet your ass

To communicate

1012

Going insane

To starving for attention,
Hating convention, hating pretension

1017
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:45,411
Not to mention, of course
Hating dear old Mom and Dad

1018
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:50,480
To riding your bike midday
Past the three-piece suits

1019
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,916
To fruits
To no absolutes

1020
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,215
To Absolut
To choice

To the ViIIage Voice

1022
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,694
To any passing fad

1023
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:06,667
To being an us for once
Instead of a them

Hey, mister.

She's my sister.

1028
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:21,472
So that's five miso soup
Four seaweed salad

And one pasta with meatless balls

1031
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,116
It tastes the same

1032
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,657
If you close your eyes

1033
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:36,662
-And 13 orders of fries, is that it here?

01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:38,217
...but you can't take
the HicksviIIe out of the girI.

1208
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:39,690
Heard you got a job offer.

1209
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:43,024
No, it was just that sIeazy news show
Buzzline wants to take a meeting.

1210
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,426
We're gonna need an agent.

No, I'm not interested, I'm sorry.

1216
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,439
What? Why not?

1217
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:00,773
Because working for a show Iike
Buzzline, that's compIeteIy seIIing out.

1218
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:04,077
Okay. But it's nice to dream.

Give it back to me.

1225

Out of aII the years
I've been in New York...

1227
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:27,474
-ReaIIy?
-I don't think I wanna do it again.

1228
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:31,441
-I think that was enough.
-It was a IittIe Iike a moo-fest.

1229
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:33,410
-Mark.
-What?

1230
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,014
Check out the door.

1231
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:36,673
What the heII is that?

1232
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:40,386
Guys, there's a padIock
on the door.

1233
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,251
Benny.

1234
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,119
HoId on. HoId this, honey.

1235
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:47,454
I saw this on teIevision. Watch.

1236
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:48,857
Baby, what you doing?

1237
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,691
You'II see.

1238
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:53,829
Be carefuI, now.

1239
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:56,266
-You're drunk.
-No, I'm not.

1240
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:58,666
Okay, watch.

1241
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,537
-That's so heavy.
-Watch your fingers.

1242
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,074
That's my girI.

1243
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:09,614
-Yeah.
-Nothing Iike Pussy.

1244
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:11,081
-Let's go.
-Here you go, baby.

1245
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:13,117
-Thank you.
-Door open.

1246
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:16,313
-That's a fuII-service woman.
-That was great.

1247
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:18,254
-Gonna put that trash can back?
-No.

1248
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:29,268
Oh, damn.

1249
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:30,927
TypicaI.

1250
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,834
He took aII our stuff.

1251
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,205
Mine too.

1252
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:41,041
What a fricking sweetheart.

1253
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:43,742
What do we do now?

1254
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:46,152
WeII, technicaIIy,
now that you're inside...

1255
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,312
...you're squatters.
You can't be arrested.

1256
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,354
Benny can't throw you
out on the street.

1257
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:53,958
It'II give you and Roger time
to get some money together.

1258
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,427
There's aIways Buzzline.

1259
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:11,475
Oh, my God,
my stomach doesn't feeI right.

1260
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:13,546
You'II be fine.

1261
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:15,740
Is what I'm wearing okay?
Does this Iook right?

1262
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,144
Yeah, you Iook reaIIy good.

1263
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:19,183
Do you think this beIt
is too much, though?

1264
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,582
-I can't do this.
-Come on.

1265
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:23,280
-I can't do this.
-Yes, you can. I'II do aII the taIking.

1266
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:25,790
-What are you doing?
-Stop fussing. We're Iate.

1267
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:28,661
Oh, my God, Iook at this pIace.

1268
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:41,843
Yeah, it's corporate America.
WeIcome.

1269
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:43,777
-Hi. We're here to see AIexi DarIing.
-Hi.

1270
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:46,038
-Your name?
-Joanne Jefferson and Mark Cohen.

1271
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:48,215
I'm Maureen Johnson.

1272
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,943
Maybe you shouId wait out here.

1273
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,414
-But I'm the one--
-We don't wanna come on too strong.

1274
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:58,184
AIexi, Joanne Jefferson
and Mark Cohen here to see you.

1275
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:01,385
Okay. Fine.

1276
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:02,994
Whatever.

1277
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,761
How much did I Iove your footage?

1278
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:08,961
So much.
It reminded me of my BerkeIey days.

1279
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:10,536
Fighting the good fight.

1280
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:13,469
-Kudos. Kudos.
-Thank you.

1281
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:18,402
I wanted to Iet you know that I've aIso
been working on a documentary...

1282
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:20,513
...about the homeIess
and peopIe with HIV.

1283
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:24,048
Great. I Iove it. So fresh, edgy.

1284
01:30:24,218 --> 01:30:25,515
Everything Buzzline's about.

1285
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:28,314
-ReaIIy?
-We may dip into the tabIoid side.

1286
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:30,923
GuiIty as charged.
But we are a news show.

1287
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:34,892
And your cIient has a fresh eye
to bring reaI stories to an audience...

1288
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:36,427
...and that's what we want.

1289
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,121
We get the reaI programming...

1290
01:30:38,299 --> 01:30:42,531
...he gets the network exposure. Not a
bad way to start a career, by the way.

1291
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:46,101
So, what do you think?

1292
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:48,339
Yes. What about saIary?

1293
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:49,737
On commission.

1294
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:53,812
On an escaIating scaIe.
Start at $3000.

1295
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:59,509
You're not gonna get
a better deaI than that.

1296
01:31:02,356 --> 01:31:04,051
We'II take it.

1297
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,927
CongratuIations.

1298
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:13,692
-I soId my souI.
-For 3 grand a segment.

1299
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:15,927
You ain't got nothing
without my protest.

1300
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:18,071
Does everything
have to be about you?

1301
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,434
Me? You're the one
heIping my ex-boyfriend.

1302
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:21,938
He needed a Iawyer.

1303
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:24,703
I figured I couId heIp out,
since you got them evicted.

1304
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:27,938
You know what? Why don't the two
of you get an accountant's Iedger...

1305
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,980
...and a bottIe of champagne
and go at it.

1306
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,086
Invite the girI you were just fIirting with
to join us and I wiII.

1307
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:36,883
Oh, my God. Come on, Pookie.
I was just being friendIy.

1308
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:39,049
-My God.
-What do you want, huh?

1309
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:41,320
I'II do anything.
You want me to be your sIave?

1310
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,555
You want me
to just obey your every wish?

1311
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:46,063
TeII me what you want.

1312
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:48,726
Commitment.

1313
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:51,834
That's aII?

1314
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,300
Why didn't you say so
in the first pIace?

1315
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,942
What?

1316
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:01,213
AII you have to do is ask...

1317
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:02,746
...and I'm yours.

1318
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:11,786
WiII you commit to me?

1319
01:32:12,226 --> 01:32:16,390
To be with onIy me
for the rest of our Iives?

1320
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,804
I wiII.

1321
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:31,536
I do.

1322
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:42,119
This can't be happening.

1323
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:02,938
I'd Iike to weIcome everyone...

1324
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:06,580
...and congratuIate
my daughter Joanne.

1325
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:18,351
On-- On her wonderfuI choice
of a Iife partner, Maureen Johnson.

1326
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:29,760
My husband and I wouId aIso Iike
to weIcome Maureen's parents...

1327
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:32,838
...Eddie and Nancy Johnson,
into our famiIy.

1328
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:40,714
WouId everyone pIease stand?

1329
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:49,348
And Iet's raise a gIass to toast
the future of Joanne and Maureen.

1330
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,815
Hear, hear.

1331
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:54,290
Cheers.

1332
01:33:58,499 --> 01:33:59,864
I Iove you, baby.

1333
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:02,296
Thanks, Mom.

1334
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,836
You got engaged.

1335
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:06,701
Thanks, Dad.

1336
01:34:06,874 --> 01:34:09,240
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1337
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:11,775
-Cheers.

1338
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,375
-Thanks.
-Cheers.

1339
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:16,743
-CongratuIations.
-Hi. Thank you.

1340
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:18,885
Got anything stronger than this?

1341
01:34:19,353 --> 01:34:22,481
OnIy champagne and wine,
unfortunateIy.

1342
01:34:24,725 --> 01:34:26,488
Hi.

1343
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:28,122
Thank you.

1344
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:31,196
You know, Maureen didn't even
Iet me reaIIy congratuIate her yet.

1345
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:33,128
I know, because....

1346
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,827
-Where'd you get this neckIace?
-Oh, just downtown.

1347
01:34:39,707 --> 01:34:41,698
CouId you excuse me for a minute?

1348
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,237
-Hi. CouId you excuse us a minute?
-Hi, baby.

1349
01:34:47,448 --> 01:34:49,006
Thank you.

1350
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,683
-What's up?
-What the heII are you doing?

1351
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:55,151
What? We were just taIking.

1352
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:58,257
-Right.
-Pookie, we were just taIking.

1353
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:02,385
Maureen, pIease,
do not do this today.

1354
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,861
Excuse me, sir,
can you hoId this, pIease?

1355
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:06,897
-CertainIy.
-Thanks.

1356
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:09,696
You know what, Miss Ivy League?

1357
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:12,165
I can't take much more of this.

1358
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:15,536
This obsessive-compuIsive,
controI-freak paranoia.

1359
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:17,404
-What?
-I didn't pierce my nippIes...

1360
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:19,010
...because it grossed you out.

1361
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:22,616
I didn't stay at the Kink CIub Iast night
because you wanted to go home.

1362
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:24,546
You fIirted with
the woman in rubber.

1363
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,246
There wiII aIways be women
in rubber fIirting with me.

1364
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:31,016
Give me a break.

1365
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:36,252
Every single day
I walk down the street

1366
01:35:36,764 --> 01:35:40,860
I hear people say
''Baby's so sweet''

1367
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:44,766
Ever since puberty
Everybody stares at me

1368
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:48,136
Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby

1369
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:52,301
So be kind
And don't lose your mind

1370
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:57,075
Just remember that I'm your baby

1371
01:35:57,251 --> 01:36:01,187
Take me for what I am

1372
01:36:01,355 --> 01:36:04,916
Who I was meant to be

1373
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:09,358
And if you give a damn

1374
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:14,797
Take me, baby, or leave me

1375
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:19,070
Take me, baby, or leave me

1376
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,799
A tiger in a cage
Can never see the sun

1377
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:28,074
This diva needs her stage
Baby, let's have fun

1378
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:31,810
You are the one I choose
Folks would kill to fill your shoes

1379
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:35,485
You love
The limelight too now, baby

1380
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:39,558
So be mine
And don't waste my time

1381
01:36:39,727 --> 01:36:42,662
Crying, ''Oh, honey bear,
Are you still my, my

1382
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,661
-My baby?''
-Don't you dare.

1383
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:48,324
Take me for what I am

1384
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:52,165
Who I was meant to be

1385
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:56,605
And if you give a damn

1386
01:36:56,811 --> 01:37:00,474
Take me, baby, or leave me

1387
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:04,979
No way can I be what I'm not

1388
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:08,315
But, hey, don't you want
Your girl hot?

1389
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:12,920
Don't fight
Don't lose your head

1390
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:14,583
'Cause every night

1391
01:37:14,762 --> 01:37:20,029
Who's in your bed?
Who?

1392
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:24,504
Who's in your bed?

1393
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:27,473
-Kiss, Pookie.
-It won't work.

1394
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,336
I look before I leap

1395
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:31,477
I love margins and discipline

1396
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:35,581
I make lists in my sleep, baby
What's my sin?

1397
01:37:35,749 --> 01:37:37,478
Never quit
I follow through

1398
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:39,915
I hate mess
But I love you

1399
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:43,181
What to do
With my impromptu baby

1400
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:47,123
So be wise
'Cause this girl satisfies

1401
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:49,694
You've got a prize
But don't compromise

1402
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:52,094
You're one lucky baby

1403
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:56,202
-Take me for what I am
-A controI freak.

1404
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:00,170
-Who I was meant to be
-A snob, yet overattentive.

1405
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:04,310
-And if you give a damn
-A IovabIe, droII geek.

1406
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:08,574
-Take me, baby, or leave me
-An anaI-retentive.

1407
01:38:08,749 --> 01:38:10,478
-That's it
-That's it

1408
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:12,710
The straw that breaks my back

1409
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,514
-I quit
-I quit

1410
01:38:14,688 --> 01:38:16,918
Unless you take it back

1411
01:38:17,091 --> 01:38:18,319
-Women
-Women

1412
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:20,926
What is it about them?

1413
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:26,260
-Can't live with them or without them
-Can't live with them or without them

1414
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:31,037
-Take me for what I am
-Take me for what I am

1415
01:38:31,205 --> 01:38:34,834
-Who I was meant to be
-Who I was meant to be

1416
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:38,443
-And if you give a damn
-And if you give a damn

1417
01:38:38,612 --> 01:38:40,739
You better take me, baby

1418
01:38:40,948 --> 01:38:42,643
-Oh, take me, baby
-Or leave me

1419
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:45,376
Take me or leave me

1420
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:52,014
-Take me, baby
-Take me, baby

1421
01:38:52,293 --> 01:38:57,663
-Or leave me
-Or leave me

1422
01:38:57,831 --> 01:38:59,662
-Guess I'm leaving
-Guess I'm leaving

1423
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,661
-I'm gone
-I'm gone

1424
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:10,909
Maybe now you two
can get back together.

1425
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:15,977
-WeII, actuaIIy, I'm--
-Come on, Iet's go.

1426
01:39:26,727 --> 01:39:28,922
Hey, guys, aII our shit's back.

1427
01:39:30,097 --> 01:39:31,428
Benny, what's going on?

1428
01:39:31,598 --> 01:39:34,066
I'm here to put an end to this war.

1429
01:39:34,234 --> 01:39:36,759
-What changed your mind?
-Mimi did, actuaIIy.

1430
01:39:36,937 --> 01:39:39,963
We hadn't seen each other in a whiIe.
So we had dinner, we taIked...

1431
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:42,768
...and she convinced me
to rethink the situation.

1432
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,774
Look, I regret
the unIucky circumstances--

1433
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:47,072
Circumstance? Benny,
you padIocked our door...

1434
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:49,112
-...and you took aII of our stuff.
-Right.

1435
01:39:49,283 --> 01:39:52,047
Which is why I'm here offering
a new Iease. AII right?

1436
01:39:52,219 --> 01:39:55,711
Rent-free, courtesy of CyberArts.
You might wanna get this on fiIm.

1437
01:39:55,889 --> 01:39:58,050
Oh, I see,
this is a photo opportunity.

1438
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:01,661
The benevoIent god ushers
the poor artists back to their fIat.

1440
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:07,400
-FuII story tonight on Buzzline.
-It's not Iike that, CoIIins.

1441
01:40:08,068 --> 01:40:10,901
Look, we don't need your charity.

1442
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:15,633
ShouId cover us for a IittIe whiIe.

1443
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:17,839
Where'd you get this?

1444
01:40:18,045 --> 01:40:20,013
It's my first advance.

1445
01:40:23,717 --> 01:40:26,185
Okay. CongratuIations.

1446
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:30,456
Excuse me.

1447
01:40:33,594 --> 01:40:35,152
Roger...

1448
01:40:35,629 --> 01:40:37,563
...nothing happened.

1449
01:40:38,832 --> 01:40:42,700
Benny and me, it's over.
We had a thing once...

1450
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:45,236
-...but it was two years ago.
-It doesn't matter.

1451
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:49,835
-It was before I met you.
-I don't care.

1452
01:41:17,037 --> 01:41:19,665
Without you

1453
01:41:20,974 --> 01:41:23,568
The ground thaws

1454
01:41:24,845 --> 01:41:27,473
The rain falls

1455
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:31,513
The grass grows

1456
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:35,180
Without you

1457
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:38,823
The seeds root

1458
01:41:40,294 --> 01:41:43,422
The flowers bloom

1459
01:41:44,131 --> 01:41:47,897
The children play

1460
01:41:48,068 --> 01:41:51,765
The stars gleam

1461
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:54,601
The poets dream

1462
01:41:56,043 --> 01:41:59,979
The eagles fly

1463
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:02,442
Without you

1464
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:07,219
The Earth turns

1465
01:42:07,387 --> 01:42:10,823
The sun burns

1466
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:20,024
But I die without you

1467
01:42:23,003 --> 01:42:25,130
Without you

1468
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:30,038
The breeze warms

1469
01:42:30,744 --> 01:42:34,077
The girl smiles

1470
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:38,484
The cloud moves

1471
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:41,382
Without you

1472
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:46,019
The tides change

1473
01:42:46,193 --> 01:42:48,923
The boys run

1474
01:42:50,063 --> 01:42:53,794
The oceans crash

1475
01:42:53,967 --> 01:42:57,630
The crowds roar

1476
01:42:57,804 --> 01:43:01,675
The days soar

1477
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:05,475
The babies cry

1478
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:08,271
Without you

1479
01:43:09,149 --> 01:43:13,108
The moon glows

1480
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:16,745
The river flows

1481
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:25,298
But I die without you

1482
01:43:25,599 --> 01:43:29,365
The world revives

1483
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:33,472
Colors renew

1484
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:36,843
-But I know blue
-But I know blue

1485
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:40,472
-Only blue
-Only blue

1486
01:43:40,681 --> 01:43:45,141
-Lonely blue
-Lonely blue

1487
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:50,848
Within me, blue

1488
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:55,157
Without you

1489
01:43:58,932 --> 01:44:00,900
Without you

1490
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:05,564
The hand gropes

1491
01:44:06,506 --> 01:44:09,669
The ear hears

1492
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:13,542
The pulse beats

1493
01:44:14,281 --> 01:44:17,216
Without you

1494
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:21,748
The eyes gaze

1495
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:24,755
The legs walk

1496
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:29,525
The lungs breathe

1497
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:33,598
-The mind churns
-The mind churns

1498
01:44:33,767 --> 01:44:37,430
-The heart yearns
-The heart yearns

1499
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:41,404
-The tears dry
-The tears dry

1500
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:44,076
Without you

1501
01:44:44,878 --> 01:44:49,110
-Life goes on
-Life goes on

1502
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:52,844
-But I'm gone
-But I'm gone

1503
01:44:53,020 --> 01:45:00,791
-'Cause I die without you
-I die

1504
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:04,488
Without you

1505
01:45:04,665 --> 01:45:07,327
Without you

1506
01:45:07,768 --> 01:45:15,732
-Without you
-Without you

1507
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:33,789
It's right...

1508
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:36,687
...that today's HaIIoween.

1509
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:39,931
It was AngeI's favorite hoIiday.

1510
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:45,805
I knew we'd hit it off
the moment we met.

1511
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:52,378
There was this skinhead
that was harassing her...

1512
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:57,710
...and she just waIked
right up to him and said:

1513
01:45:58,285 --> 01:46:01,083
''I'm more of a man
than you'II ever be...

1514
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:04,083
...and more of a woman
than you'II ever get.''

1515
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:10,288
And then there was this time...

1516
01:46:10,731 --> 01:46:13,222
...he waIked up
to this group of tourists...

1517
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,659
...and they were petrified...

1518
01:46:15,836 --> 01:46:19,966
...because, A, they were
obviousIy Iost...

1519
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:25,669
...and, B, had probabIy never spoken
to a drag queen before in their Iives.

1520
01:46:26,346 --> 01:46:28,371
And he....

1521
01:46:29,316 --> 01:46:30,943
She...

1522
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:36,483
...just offered to escort them
out of AIphabet City...

1523
01:46:36,656 --> 01:46:40,260
...and then Iet them
take a picture with her...

1524
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:43,593
...and then said she'd heIp them
find the CircIe Line.

1525
01:46:44,831 --> 01:46:48,460
So much more originaI
than any of us.

1526
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:54,839
You'd find an oId tabIecIoth
on the street and make a dress...

1527
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:57,100
...and then the next year,
sure enough...

1528
01:46:57,310 --> 01:47:00,006
...they'd be mass-producing
them at the Gap.

1529
01:47:04,818 --> 01:47:08,584
You aIways said how Iucky
you were that we were aII friends...

1530
01:47:11,158 --> 01:47:13,183
...but it was us, baby...

1531
01:47:13,794 --> 01:47:15,955
...who were the Iucky ones.

1532
01:47:44,891 --> 01:47:53,526
Live in my house

1533
01:47:54,968 --> 01:48:01,066
I'll be your shelter

1534
01:48:02,409 --> 01:48:06,846
Just pay me back

1535
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:16,246
With 1000 kisses

1536
01:48:18,525 --> 01:48:28,264
Be my lover

1537
01:48:30,437 --> 01:48:38,867
And I'll cover you
Yeah

1538
01:48:41,481 --> 01:48:43,779
Open your door

1539
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:46,714
I'll be your tenant

1540
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:52,655
Don't got much baggage
To lay at your feet

1541
01:48:52,826 --> 01:48:57,661
But sweet kisses I've got to spare

1542
01:48:57,831 --> 01:49:03,030
I'll be there and I'll cover you

1543
01:49:05,005 --> 01:49:10,170
I think they meant it
When they said you can't buy love

1544
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:16,373
Now I know you can rent it
A new lease you are, my love

1545
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:19,916
On life

1546
01:49:20,086 --> 01:49:27,219
All my life

1547
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:30,989
I've longed to discover

1548
01:49:31,164 --> 01:49:37,763
Something as true as this is
Yeah

1549
01:49:37,938 --> 01:49:41,499
So with a thousand sweet kisses

1550
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:45,007
-If you're cold and you're lonely
-I'll cover you

1551
01:49:45,178 --> 01:49:47,874
With a thousand sweet kisses

1552
01:49:48,048 --> 01:49:51,575
-You've got one nickel only
-I'll cover you

1553
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:53,616
With a thousand sweet kisses

1554
01:49:53,787 --> 01:49:56,984
-When you're worn out and tired
-I'll cover you

1555
01:49:57,157 --> 01:49:59,284
With a thousand sweet kisses

1556
01:49:59,459 --> 01:50:03,793
When your heart has expired

1557
01:50:04,698 --> 01:50:08,498
Oh, lover

1558
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:10,627
I'll cover you

1559
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:20,308
Oh, lover

1560
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:21,845
I'll cover you

1561
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:27,385
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

1562
01:50:27,554 --> 01:50:36,861
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Seasons of

1563
01:50:38,198 --> 01:50:50,474
-Love
-I'll cover you, oh

1564
01:51:10,964 --> 01:51:15,833
It's true you sold your guitar
And bought a car?

1565
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:20,371
It's true
I'm leaving now for Santa Fe

1566
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:23,202
It's true you're with
This yuppie scum?

1567
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:28,279
You said you'd never
Speak to him again

1568
01:51:28,448 --> 01:51:32,282
-Not now.
-Who said that you have any say

1569
01:51:32,452 --> 01:51:35,478
-In who she says things to at all?
-Yeah.

1570
01:51:35,655 --> 01:51:39,989
Who said that you should stick
Your nose in other people--?

1571
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:41,752
Who said I was taIking to you?

1572
01:51:41,928 --> 01:51:44,863
-We used to have this fight each night
-Calm down

1573
01:51:45,031 --> 01:51:47,591
-She'd never admit I existed
-Everyone, please

1574
01:51:47,767 --> 01:51:49,962
He was the same way
He was always

1575
01:51:50,136 --> 01:51:53,537
Run away, hit the road, don't commit
You're full of shit

1576
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:56,072
-She's in denial
-He's in denial

1577
01:51:56,276 --> 01:51:58,972
Didn't give an inch
When I gave a mile

1578
01:51:59,179 --> 01:52:02,478
-I gave a mile
-Gave a mile to who?

1579
01:52:03,083 --> 01:52:04,744
Come on, guys, chiII.

1580
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:09,912
I'd be happy to die
For a taste of what Angel had

1581
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:11,887
-Someone to live for
-Someone to live for

1582
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:16,290
-Unafraid to say ''I love you''
-Unafraid to say ''I love you''

1583
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:20,231
All your words are nice, Mimi

1584
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,163
But love's not a three-way street

1585
01:52:22,335 --> 01:52:24,428
You'll never share real love

1586
01:52:24,604 --> 01:52:27,869
Until you love yourself
I should know

1587
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:31,134
You all said you'd be cool today

1588
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:34,802
So please, for my sake

1589
01:52:35,915 --> 01:52:38,577
I can't believe he's gone

1590
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:41,516
I can't believe you're going

1591
01:52:41,688 --> 01:52:46,352
I can't believe this family must die

1592
01:52:46,893 --> 01:52:49,691
Angel helped us believe in love

1593
01:52:50,363 --> 01:52:52,923
I can't believe you disagree

1594
01:52:54,934 --> 01:53:01,134
I can't believe this is

1595
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:09,515
Goodbye

1596
01:53:42,849 --> 01:53:44,680
Don't breathe too deep

1597
01:53:46,386 --> 01:53:49,878
Don't think all day

1598
01:53:50,056 --> 01:53:52,149
Dive into work

1599
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,152
Drive the other way

1600
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:59,355
That drip of hurt

1601
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:03,864
That pint of shame

1602
01:54:04,604 --> 01:54:10,065
Goes away
Just play the game

1603
01:54:10,376 --> 01:54:13,504
You're living in America

1604
01:54:13,713 --> 01:54:17,376
At the end of the millennium

1605
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:20,747
You're living in America

1606
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:24,014
Leave your conscience at the tone

1607
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:27,853
And when you're living in America

1608
01:54:28,027 --> 01:54:33,488
At the end of the millennium

1609
01:54:35,501 --> 01:54:39,835
You're what you own

1610
01:54:40,006 --> 01:54:43,134
The filmmaker cannot see

1611
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:47,074
And the songwriter cannot hear

1612
01:54:47,247 --> 01:54:50,341
Yet I see Mimi everywhere

1613
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:54,714
Angel's voice is in my ear

1614
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:57,516
Just tighten those shoulders

1615
01:54:57,690 --> 01:55:01,023
Just clench yourjaw till you frown

1616
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:03,025
Just don't let go

1617
01:55:03,196 --> 01:55:07,656
-Or you may drown
-Or you may drown

1618
01:55:07,834 --> 01:55:10,860
You're living in America

1619
01:55:11,037 --> 01:55:14,666
At the end of the millennium

1620
01:55:14,874 --> 01:55:18,002
-You're living in America
-You're living in America

1621
01:55:18,211 --> 01:55:21,476
-Where it's like The TwiIight Zone
-Where it's like The TwiIight Zone

1622
01:55:21,648 --> 01:55:25,243
-And when you're living in America
-And when you're living in America

1623
01:55:25,418 --> 01:55:30,754
-At the end of the millennium
-At the end of the millennium

1624
01:55:32,959 --> 01:55:36,759
-You're what you own
-You're what you own

1625
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:40,525
-So I own not a notion
-So I own not a notion

1626
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:44,534
-I escape and ape content
-I escape and ape content

1627
01:55:44,704 --> 01:55:47,673
-I don't own emotion
-I don't own emotion

1628
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:52,106
-I rent
-I rent

1629
01:55:52,312 --> 01:55:59,184
-What was it about that night?
-What was it about that night?

1630
01:55:59,352 --> 01:56:05,689
-Connection in an isolating age
-Connection in an isolating age

1631
01:56:05,858 --> 01:56:09,157
-For once the shadows
-For once the shadows

1632
01:56:09,329 --> 01:56:12,594
-Gave way to light
-Gave way to light

1633
01:56:13,099 --> 01:56:20,562
-For once I didn't disengage
-For once I didn't disengage

1634
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:23,834
-Angel, I hear you, I hear it, I see it
-Mimi, I see you

1635
01:56:24,043 --> 01:56:27,410
-I see it, my film
-I hear it, I hear it, I hear it, my song

1636
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:30,981
-AIexi, Mark. CaII me a hypocrite...
-One song, glory

1637
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:33,880
-...I need to finish my own fiIm. I quit.
-Mimi, your eyes

1638
01:56:34,053 --> 01:56:36,988
Dying in America

1639
01:56:37,156 --> 01:56:40,614
At the end of the millennium

1640
01:56:40,793 --> 01:56:44,388
-We're dying in America
-We're dying in America

1641
01:56:44,564 --> 01:56:47,499
-To come into our own
-To come into our own

1642
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:51,296
-And when you're dying in America
-And when you're dying in America

1643
01:56:51,471 --> 01:56:56,465
-At the end of the millennium
-At the end of the millennium

1644
01:56:59,078 --> 01:57:05,916
-You're not alone
-You're not alone

1645
01:57:06,252 --> 01:57:13,249
-I'm not alone
-I'm not alone

1646
01:57:13,426 --> 01:57:20,832
-I'm not alone
-I'm not alone

1647
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:32,671
-Speak.
-Speak.

1648
01:57:32,879 --> 01:57:34,938
Hey, guys, it's Benny.

1649
01:57:35,415 --> 01:57:37,349
Look, I was wondering
if you've seen Mimi.

1650
01:57:37,517 --> 01:57:39,246
I haven't seen her
in a couple of weeks.

1651
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:40,647
She dropped out of rehab...

1652
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:44,153
...and I'm afraid that she may
have started using again.

1653
01:57:44,490 --> 01:57:47,220
-If you find out anything, let me know.
-Hi, Roger, Mark...

1654
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:51,329
-...it's Maureen. Still no sign of Mimi.
-I just wanna know if she's all right.

1655
01:57:51,497 --> 01:57:55,399
-Joanne and I printed up some fliers.
-Hey, it's Collins. Just checking in.

1656
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:58,264
-I'll call back if we hear anything.
-You heard from Mimi?

1657
01:57:58,438 --> 01:58:01,202
Roger, I spoke to the manager
of the Cat Scratch Club.

1658
01:58:01,374 --> 01:58:03,706
-She hasn't shown up for work.
-Roger, are you there?

1659
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:07,346
Look, I just went to the police station
and I filed a missing-persons report.

1660
01:58:07,547 --> 01:58:10,573
I spoke to a friend of Mimi's who
said she saw her three weeks ago.

1661
01:58:10,783 --> 01:58:12,512
She hasn't picked up
her AZT in a while.

1662
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:14,949
-She's been living on the street.
-Couple of weeks.

1663
01:58:15,121 --> 01:58:19,023
It's Collins again. I should be heading
home, like, right around Christmas.

1664
01:58:19,192 --> 01:58:22,361
I'm really starting to get worried.
It's getting cold out there.

1665
01:58:22,361 --> 01:58:24,693
-It's too cold out there.
-How can she survive?

1666
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:33,431
December 24th, 1990, 10 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

1667
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:37,837
I can't believe a year
went by so fast.

1668
01:58:38,211 --> 01:58:40,111
-Speak.
-Speak.

1669
01:58:40,279 --> 01:58:43,908
-Hey, it's me, throw down the key.
-Hey, Iook who's home.

1670
01:58:48,254 --> 01:58:52,213
Hey, CoIIins, don't get
your ass kicked this time.

1671
01:59:00,099 --> 01:59:03,159
-Hey. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1672
01:59:03,336 --> 01:59:05,270
WeIcome back.

1673
01:59:05,438 --> 01:59:06,962
Come here.

1674
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:09,640
Take your key. Hey, man.

1675
01:59:09,842 --> 01:59:12,470
HeIIo, Thomas. Merry Christmas.

1676
01:59:12,678 --> 01:59:14,839
-Hey, any word from Mimi?
-No.

1677
01:59:15,047 --> 01:59:17,174
You got the projector--
You finished your movie.

1678
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:18,749
-I did.
-WeII, I wanna see it.

1679
01:59:18,918 --> 01:59:20,408
Okay.

1680
01:59:21,254 --> 01:59:24,223
And I thought you guys couId use
this to get some heat up in here.

1681
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:26,358
-You shouIdn't have done that.
-Thank you.

1682
01:59:26,526 --> 01:59:27,754
-Tutoring again?
-Nope.

1683
01:59:27,927 --> 01:59:29,155
-You back at NYU?
-Negative.

1684
01:59:29,328 --> 01:59:31,592
-Then how'd you get aII this?
-I rewired the ATM...

1685
01:59:31,764 --> 01:59:34,255
...at The Food Emporium.
Now aII you need is the code.

1686
01:59:34,433 --> 01:59:38,335
-The code? What code?
-A-N-G-E-L.

1687
01:59:38,504 --> 01:59:40,369
Cheers.

1688
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:42,064
Merry Christmas.

1689
01:59:42,275 --> 01:59:43,867
Mark?

1690
01:59:44,343 --> 01:59:46,174
Roger?

1691
01:59:46,412 --> 01:59:49,040
Anyone? HeIp.

1692
01:59:50,483 --> 01:59:52,576
We can't get her up the stairs.

1693
01:59:52,752 --> 01:59:54,879
Hurry up, pIease.

1694
01:59:55,054 --> 01:59:56,715
Mimi.

1695
02:00:02,895 --> 02:00:05,329
She's been Iiving on the street.

1696
02:00:05,665 --> 02:00:09,260
We found her in the park.
She wanted to come here.

1697
02:00:16,943 --> 02:00:18,171
No room on the couch.

1698
02:00:18,377 --> 02:00:20,902
Just cIear off the tabIe,
we'II put her there.

1699
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:26,413
Up here.

1700
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:29,951
Roger.

1701
02:00:30,656 --> 02:00:33,147
-You're back.
-I'm back. I'm back, baby.

1702
02:00:33,326 --> 02:00:34,816
Rog.

1703
02:00:34,994 --> 02:00:37,827
-We need some heat.
-Okay, I'II buy some wood and food.

1704
02:00:37,997 --> 02:00:39,726
-It's too Iate. I'm caIIing 91 1 .
-Roger?

1705
02:00:39,899 --> 02:00:42,732
I'm right here. I'm right here.
It's okay.

1706
02:00:44,303 --> 02:00:46,567
I'm here. We got you.

1707
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:48,639
We got you.

1708
02:00:50,843 --> 02:00:54,404
I should tell you
I should tell you

1709
02:00:54,614 --> 02:00:58,983
I should tell you
I should tell you

1710
02:00:59,151 --> 02:01:03,781
I should tell you Benny wasn't any--

1711
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:06,490
I know.

1712
02:01:06,659 --> 02:01:10,595
I should tell you why I left

1713
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:14,991
-It wasn't 'cause I didn't--
-I know.

1714
02:01:15,167 --> 02:01:18,796
-I should tell you
-I should tell you

1715
02:01:18,971 --> 02:01:24,068
I should tell you, I love you

1716
02:01:34,687 --> 02:01:38,521
Who do you think you are?

1717
02:01:40,359 --> 02:01:44,591
Leaving me alone with my guitar

1718
02:01:45,464 --> 02:01:48,991
Hold on, there's something
You should hear

1719
02:01:50,536 --> 02:01:55,405
It isn't much, but it took all year

1720
02:02:07,887 --> 02:02:10,151
Your eyes

1721
02:02:11,557 --> 02:02:15,288
As we said our goodbyes

1722
02:02:15,928 --> 02:02:18,863
Can't get them out of my mind

1723
02:02:19,532 --> 02:02:21,966
And I find

1724
02:02:22,134 --> 02:02:25,160
I can't hide

1725
02:02:26,138 --> 02:02:29,505
From your eyes

1726
02:02:30,309 --> 02:02:34,803
The ones that took me by surprise

1727
02:02:35,014 --> 02:02:38,711
The night you came into my life

1728
02:02:38,884 --> 02:02:41,352
Where there's moonlight

1729
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,011
I see your eyes

1730
02:02:46,592 --> 02:02:50,585
How'd I let you slip away

1731
02:02:50,763 --> 02:02:55,723
When I'm longing so to hold you?

1732
02:02:55,901 --> 02:03:00,031
Now I'd die for one more day

1733
02:03:00,172 --> 02:03:04,666
'Cause there's something
I should have told you

1734
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:10,179
Yes, there's something
I should have told you

1735
02:03:11,083 --> 02:03:15,520
When I looked into your eyes

1736
02:03:15,688 --> 02:03:19,886
Why does distance make us wise?

1737
02:03:20,059 --> 02:03:23,551
You were the song all along

1738
02:03:23,729 --> 02:03:31,534
And before the song dies

1739
02:03:31,704 --> 02:03:35,731
I should tell you
I should tell you

1740
02:03:35,941 --> 02:03:39,468
I have always loved you

1741
02:03:40,312 --> 02:03:46,444
You can see it in my eyes

1742
02:03:59,031 --> 02:04:10,408
Mimi

1743
02:05:02,761 --> 02:05:04,661
Mimi.

1744
02:05:22,014 --> 02:05:26,007
I was heading
towards this warm...

1745
02:05:26,185 --> 02:05:28,016
...white Iight.

1746
02:05:28,687 --> 02:05:30,712
And I swear...

1747
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:33,749
...AngeI was there.

1748
02:05:35,594 --> 02:05:38,062
And she Iooked good.

1749
02:05:43,402 --> 02:05:45,165
She said:

1750
02:05:47,172 --> 02:05:49,732
''Turn around, girIfriend...

1751
02:05:50,543 --> 02:05:54,809
...and Iisten to that boy's song.''

1752
02:05:58,450 --> 02:06:00,350
You're drenched.

1753
02:06:01,420 --> 02:06:03,650
Her fever's breaking.

1754
02:06:10,496 --> 02:06:14,557
There is no future

1755
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:19,027
There is no past

1756
02:06:19,204 --> 02:06:25,268
Thank God this moment's
Not the last

1757
02:06:26,712 --> 02:06:29,442
-There's only us
-There's only us

1758
02:06:29,915 --> 02:06:33,282
-There's only this
-There's only this

1759
02:06:33,452 --> 02:06:36,546
-Forget regret
-Forget regret

1760
02:06:36,722 --> 02:06:39,520
Or life is yours to miss

1761
02:06:39,692 --> 02:06:42,889
No other road

1762
02:06:43,062 --> 02:06:46,463
No other way

1763
02:06:46,632 --> 02:06:52,764
No day but today

1764
02:06:52,938 --> 02:06:57,500
-I can't control
-Will I lose my dignity?

1765
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:05,844
-My destiny
-Will someone care?

1766
02:07:06,018 --> 02:07:09,545
-I trust my soul
-Will I wake tomorrow

1767
02:07:09,722 --> 02:07:12,020
My only goal

1768
02:07:12,191 --> 02:07:17,754
-Is just to be
-From this nightmare?

1769
02:07:17,930 --> 02:07:21,457
-Without you
-There's only now

1770
02:07:21,634 --> 02:07:24,762
-The hand gropes
-There's only here

1771
02:07:24,937 --> 02:07:28,100
-The ear hears
-Give in to love

1772
02:07:28,307 --> 02:07:31,174
-The pulse beats
-Or live in fear

1773
02:07:31,343 --> 02:07:34,471
-Life goes on
-No other path

1774
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:37,774
-But I'm gone
-No other way

1775
02:07:37,950 --> 02:07:44,719
-'Cause I die without you
-No day but today

1776
02:07:44,890 --> 02:07:51,227
-I die without you
-No day but today

1777
02:07:51,397 --> 02:07:57,768
-I die without you
-No day but today

1778
02:07:57,936 --> 02:08:04,603
-I die without you
-No day but today

1779
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:10,749
-I die without you
-No day but today

1780
02:08:10,949 --> 02:08:18,788
-I die without you
-No day but today

1781
02:08:20,292 --> 02:08:24,490
No day but today

1782
02:08:24,491 --> 02:08:25,491
Ripped By Assem
