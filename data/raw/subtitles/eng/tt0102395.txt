1
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,175
He's coming.

2
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,183
I love you.

3
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,323
Jessie!

4
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,470
Oh, I missed you.

5
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,874
More!

6
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,539
Again!

7
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,316
What will you do with me now, sir?

8
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,880
Find a priest, take our vows
and live happily ever after.

9
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,619
But what of your mother?

10
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,753
You know how she feels
about mixed marriages.

11
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,695
By sunset we will be man and wife,

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,962
and the Queen, bless her soul,
will be out of my life.

13
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,713
- He's coming! He's coming!
Let's go.

14
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,190
Everybody!

15
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,668
Stand back. Make way. I am the Prince.

16
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,905
We are here
on the Queen's business.

17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,175
We have orders to arrest your peasant girl.

18
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,583
Over my dead body.

19
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,984
Do not draw that sword
unless you intend to use it, sir.

20
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,987
I think he means it.

21
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,825
Sir, a word in private.

22
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,560
We're mere soldiers
working on the Queen's business.

23
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,068
Can't you try to see things... No, don't!

24
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,706
Unhand her!

25
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,413
- My prince!
- Jessie!

26
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,346
- I love you!
- I love you!

27
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,154
- My prince!
- Jessie!

28
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,332
William!

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,630
Queen, the queen!

30
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,365
Stop picking on those soldiers
and get away from that peasant girl.

31
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,566
Hit the ground, you scummy toads.

32
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,041
I love her, Mother. I will always love her.

33
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,477
Be still, my son.
She's only after the royal jewels.

34
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,208
You know she's not our type.

35
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,274
Now, come home with me
and we'll discuss it over some mutton.

36
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,013
Give her the gift.

37
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,669
- Well, my little sweetie pie.
- I don't want your gold or your jewels.

38
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,603
Get out of the way.

39
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,164
No? Then how about gold and jewels?

40
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:11,612
Jessie, let us make this
a symbol of our eternal love.

41
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,046
Then I will wear it forever.

42
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,032
You have cursed my gift!

43
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,040
It's not me, darling.
It's the work of Spretzle.

44
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,100
Brilliant. Simply brilliant. Frozen forever.

45
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,010
That little curse was nothing, my queenie.
Nothing, no, nothing.

46
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,514
Mother, I have never
asked you for anything.

47
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,984
But I beseech you,
take my life and spare hers.

48
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,418
All right, since you're such a romantic.

49
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,390
A thousand years,

50
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,188
or until she meets a true love
from another land.

51
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,162
Only then can the cursed necklace
be removed.

52
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,357
No!

53
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,469
Is it a deal?

54
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,497
Yes, but you have cursed your kingdom
for 1,000 years.

55
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,233
And that is the legend

56
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:41,137
of Hauptmann-Koenig's
enchanted peasant girl.

57
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,699
Of course, nobody
really believes the legend.

58
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,074
Now, if you'll step this way,

59
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:50,138
I'll show you our famous collection
of umbrellas through history.

60
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,349
Is it true
the statue's going on tour?

61
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,647
Yes.

62
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:59,454
"Nobody really believes the legend"?

63
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:08,165
My great, great, great, great, great,

64
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,065
great, great, great...

65
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,771
Do you mind? Thank you.

66
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,203
<i>...great, great grandfather
was never wrong:</i>

67
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,979
And very soon, my darling,
you will be alive and belong to his

68
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,916
great, great, great, great,

69
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:33,018
great, great, great, great grandson.

70
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,457
That's me.

71
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,976
See you, Mom.

72
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,057
Jason, your breakfast.

73
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,768
You have to eat
before you start a new job.

74
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,267
Thanks, Mom.

75
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,277
- Did I keep you up last night?
- You work too hard.

76
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,711
Well, all right.
So, marry a rich girl, and I'll retire.

77
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,011
- So, find me a rich girl.
- All right. I will. So, go.

78
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,108
Don't be late. I'll be waiting up for you.

79
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,313
Mrs. Williamson! Mrs. Williamson!

80
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,049
- What happened?
- I'm married!

81
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,455
- Oh, I don't believe it.
- Thank you!

82
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,753
- Thank you!
- Well, thank you.

83
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,022
He's the most beautiful man
I have ever met.

84
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,756
Oh, wonderful. Come in. You'll tell me.

85
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,957
- Is he rich?
- Yes.

86
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,329
- Does he have a Gold Card?
- Yes, he does.

87
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,265
- Does he have car? Does he have a condo?
- Yes.

88
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,918
<i>Maybe I'm crazy but I'm no fool</i>

89
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,684
<i>I know where I stand</i>

90
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,892
<i>All of your reasons and all your rules</i>

91
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,490
<i>Don't stop me again</i>

92
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,992
<i>'Cause a lie's a lie and a fact's a fact</i>

93
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,402
<i>You can try but you can't change that</i>

94
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,930
<i>I've got something to make you see</i>

95
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,772
<i>And that something is me</i>

96
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,869
<i>You better wake up</i>

97
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,842
<i>'Cause my time is coming</i>

98
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,846
<i>And I'm running all the way
Wake up!</i>

99
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,384
<i>My engine's humming</i>

100
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:47,222
<i>Running down the road to paradise
Wake up!</i>

101
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,554
<i>No time for sleeping</i>

102
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,158
<i>Gonna drive all night
Wake up!</i>

103
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,060
<i>And start believing</i>

104
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:01,129
<i>Racing through the darkness to the light</i>

105
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,242
<i>Make me an offer I can't refuse</i>

106
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,846
<i>Near my back to the wall</i>

107
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,217
<i>Fold me a bed with those concrete shoes</i>

108
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,983
<i>It don't matter at all</i>

109
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,155
<i>Through the fire, on the ice</i>

110
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,761
<i>I've been knocked down once or twice</i>

111
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,731
<i>I've got something left to prove</i>

112
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,164
<i>Gonna prove it to you</i>

113
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,500
<i>You better wake up</i>

114
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,132
<i>'Cause my time is coming</i>

115
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,772
<i>And I'm running all the way
Wake up!</i>

116
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,071
<i>And start believing
Racing through</i>

117
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:47,480
<i>Racing through the night</i>

118
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,386
<i>Wake up!</i>

119
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,150
- Oh, thank you.
- Hold it.

120
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,686
<i>Start believing</i>

121
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,998
<i>Ooh, you better wake up</i>

122
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,055
<i>Wake up!</i>

123
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,735
I like to get candids. Come with me.

124
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,466
Yeah, it might just be your ID badge,

125
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,169
but I try to capture
the essence of every Prince employee.

126
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,835
Here, sign this.

127
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,780
I'm Andy Ackerman, Security.
I don't miss much.

128
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,783
Hi, I'm Jason Williamson.

129
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,581
I guess you're wondering what
I'm doing with a steering wheel, right?

130
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,212
Steering wheel?

131
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,747
Oh, that. No, I assumed it was a key chain.

132
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,090
No. No, I just don't want my jeep stolen.

133
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,758
You don't have to worry about that
with me around here.

134
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,664
- Isn't that hair spray?
- Yeah. Well, I sort of flunked Mace class.

135
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,729
Oh.

136
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,703
You blind one instructor,

137
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,835
- they make you wait six months.
- Yeah.

138
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,106
Oh, here. Don't lose this baby.

139
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,047
You can charge anything in the store
with it. 10ºº off, too.

140
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,051
- Come with me. I'll help you check in.
- Thanks.

141
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,111
I'm supposed to report to a Mr. James.

142
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,850
- Do you know...
- Oh, boy. Yeah.

143
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,690
Has the shipment arrived
from Hauptmann-Koenig yet?

144
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,523
- It's coming in this afternoon.
- Not good enough.

145
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,460
- I want it this morning.
- That's impossible, sir.

146
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,466
Nothing is impossible.
"Lmpossible" is a dirty, dirty word.

147
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,836
- Dust.
- Pardon me?

148
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,699
I smell dust.

149
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,278
Dust your counter.

150
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,948
Make a showplace of the workplace.

151
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,353
"Make a showplace
of the workplace. "

152
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,450
I want a major employee turnout
at the airport tonight.

153
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,518
This whole event
has to go off without a hitch,

154
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,620
otherwise, heads will roll.

155
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,027
He's not kidding.

156
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,667
That's him right there.

157
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,934
Mr. James, I'm so sorry.

158
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,772
It was an accident.
It will never happen again, I promise.

159
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,369
- Excuse me, Mr. James?
- Not now.

160
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,937
An accident?

161
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,745
You destroy a mannequin
during store hours

162
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,876
and you call it an accident?

163
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,918
- Mr. James.
- Not now!

164
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,317
What do you do, Albert?

165
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,784
I work for Mr. Montrose, sir.

166
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,093
On the Hauptmann-Koenig presentation?

167
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,656
- Mr. James.
- Not now!

168
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,929
Do you realize
how important that presentation is?

169
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,908
The cream of Philadelphia society
is going to be here.

170
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,344
The eyes of the entire city
will be on that presentation

171
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,872
and on this store and on me.

172
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,409
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

173
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:39,584
- And have you learned your lesson?
- Yes, sir.

174
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,523
Good. You're fired.

175
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,893
For best effect,
deplore neglect, demand respect.

176
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:53,098
"Deplore neglect, demand respect. "

177
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,433
Now.

178
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm Jason Williamson.

179
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,442
I think I'm supposed to report to you.
I'm the new trainee.

180
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,671
Ah.

181
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,045
Well, lucky you.

182
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,607
It seems we have an opening
on Mr. Montrose's staff.

183
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:11,681
Just because Hauptmann-Koenig is drab
does not mean that we have to be.

184
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:15,124
I'm going to breathe some life
into this presentation.

185
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:19,130
Remember, the password is pizzazz!

186
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,189
Stop! Wait!

187
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,167
<i>Do you remember Miss Diana Ross
in the movie Mahogany?</i>

188
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,133
Yeah.

189
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,738
Give me cheekbones, or give me death!

190
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,148
Five, six, seven, eight.

191
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,265
Mr. James is coming!
Mr. James is coming!

192
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,396
Scatter, children! Scatter!

193
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,633
Bring down the curtains!

194
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,714
Montrose. Montrose! I need to talk to you.

195
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,247
The Wizard's not here. Go away. Go away.

196
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,855
- Montrose!
- Laughing, joking, kidding.

197
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,892
I'd like you to meet your new assistant.

198
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,093
What happened to Albert?

199
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,694
Albert was a blemish
on the face of Prince and Company.

200
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,828
I fired him.

201
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:36,272
Just like you did
those 18 other assistants?

202
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,277
Guess there's no use in worrying
about the pension plan around here, huh?

203
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,877
He's got a sense of humor. I like that.
We can use that around here.

204
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,382
No peeking!

205
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:51,219
- Why won't you let me see it?
- Because I am an artiste.

206
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,225
You wouldn't want to interrupt
the creative flow, would you?

207
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:59,822
Montrose, this show
will be elegant and demure, won't it?

208
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,697
- No crazy stuff.
- You have my word.

209
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,293
Fine.

210
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,931
The pursuit of excellence
begins with elegance.

211
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,499
"The pursuit of excellence
begins with elegance. "

212
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:16,071
I haven't been elegant and demure
since I graduated from finishing school.

213
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,843
Entrée.

214
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,779
She's pretty.

215
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,324
What is all this
enchanted-peasant-girl stuff?

216
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,418
Oh, it's a typical old world tale.

217
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,962
Girl meets prince.

218
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,521
Evil sorcerer turns girl into wood
for 1,000 years,

219
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,827
Lord knows how.

220
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,869
Wooden girl becomes
major tourist attraction.

221
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,598
Yeah, that's pretty typical, all right.

222
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,162
Would you like to try
one of our new fragrances?

223
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,639
No, thanks.

224
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,571
Tabu. How mysterious. Hit me again, Gail.

225
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,943
You never buy, Hollywood.

226
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,074
Well, no.
That is because I am constantly evolving.

227
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,085
Put it right here, Jason.

228
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,653
- How about a gift for your girlfriend?
- Oh, I don't have one.

229
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,123
So you're looking.

230
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,055
For true love. Yeah. Sure.

231
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,359
True love is like the Loch Ness monster.

232
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,662
Everyone has heard of it,
but no one has ever seen it.

233
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,634
- I have.
You know, I don't know.

234
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,330
I think there's someone out there
for everyone.

235
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,235
I couldn't agree more.

236
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,675
You just have to follow your heart,
and your nose.

237
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,713
Well, my, my, my.
Aren't we the little coquette?

238
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,475
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but, Jason,

239
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,712
I think that if you asked Gail out,
she would probably say yes.

240
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,377
Am I hallucinating, Gail?

241
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,891
<i>Excuse me, I'm beeping. Pardon moi.</i>

242
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,687
Put it right there, Jason.

243
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:40,024
Well, I am free Friday, Jason.

244
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,896
I'm free, too, Gail.

245
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,634
Well, why rush it?

246
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,433
I mean, looks like we're gonna be
working here together.

247
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,306
- Why don't we just, you know...
- Something terrible has happened.

248
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,073
The enchanted peasant girl
has been in an accident!

249
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,445
Come on. We must go.
Follow me! Move your buns!

250
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,412
Still free Friday.

251
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,887
My little nip and tuck
derriere is gonna be in a sling

252
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,415
if anything happens to that statue,
those clothes or the royal jewels.

253
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,961
I'm sure
everything's gonna be fine.

254
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,088
Oh, it's just the word "jewels. "

255
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,497
I have these beads and baubles,
mementos of old flames.

256
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,559
Souvenirs for old
Mr. Left Behind Hollywood.

257
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,867
Oh, it's just so cheap and tawdry.

258
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,773
Well, at least they thought enough of you
to give you the gifts.

259
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,203
I bought them myself.

260
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,818
Wow!

261
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,424
Hold it right there, man.

262
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,998
Someone please kill me!
I don't want to live!

263
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,366
Just breathe or something, would you?

264
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,806
Jeez! The whole thing's gonna go!
Get out of the truck!

265
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,833
Be careful. The girl will fall out.
We must secure the doors.

266
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,712
All my years on the force, I never saw
anybody more stupid than you guys.

267
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,716
The sign said "keep right. "

268
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:09,345
To the end of the bridge,
where the street is.

269
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,888
Hoist her up.

270
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,715
But the peasant girl!

271
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,659
- It's gonna go! Get out!
- No!

272
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,359
I'll save you!

273
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,671
Oh, chivalry's not dead.

274
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,104
Let go!

275
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,142
Where is Jacques Cousteau
when you need him?

276
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,683
Give her to us. She's ours.

277
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,516
Take it.
- There he is!

278
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:20,388
Don't you ever touch
the enchanted peasant girl.

279
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,991
Oh, my hero!

280
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,223
You saved the presentation
and my phony baloney job.

281
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,631
I could have sworn she was real.

282
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,965
She's a mannequin.

283
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,667
I could have sworn she was real.

284
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,941
She's the enchanted peasant girl.

285
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,376
Let me guess.

286
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,845
You must be the boys
from Hauptmann-Koenig.

287
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,213
My, haven't we been
hoarding the steroids.

288
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,514
We are here to guard
our national treasure.

289
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,419
Oh, and doing a fabulous job.

290
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,185
Did you recover
the rest of the sacred wardrobe?

291
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,782
I thought Arnold did.

292
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,725
I thought you did.

293
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,387
No!

294
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,796
Goodbye, boys.

295
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,927
Jason, let's take the mannequin
back to the store.

296
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,595
Yeah, we wouldn't want her to catch cold.

297
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,901
They're so dumb. I just love that in a man.

298
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,477
This is the strangest thing
that's ever happened to me.

299
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,811
Believe me,
stranger things have happened.

300
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,443
Yeah? Well, not to me, they haven't.

301
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,083
Do you think these jewels are real?

302
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,386
Honey, this little country girl knows jewels
and, believe me, those are real.

303
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,428
It's your fault.

304
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,700
No, it's your fault.

305
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,375
We have to catch a ride.

306
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,002
I know how.

307
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,273
Hey, look!

308
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,712
I don't believe this.
I don't believe it.

309
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:57,880
Whoo!

310
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,918
Hey!

311
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,460
All right, let's give them a ride.

312
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,526
Oh, baby, yeah.

313
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,033
- Get in.
- Get in.

314
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,468
Get in. I told you it would work.

315
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,671
Take them up.

316
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,920
Did you get my note?
- Yes, Andy, I got it.

317
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,455
Well?

318
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:35,289
Look, you're very sweet,
but you can't buy my car insurance.

319
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,955
- Why not?
- Andy, can I give you a little tip?

320
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,226
Car insurance is not very romantic.

321
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,564
Say that after a major injury accident.

322
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,628
Andy, let's just leave it that we're friends.

323
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,402
Really? What kind of friends?

324
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,000
The kind that
don't talk to each other much

325
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,568
and never go out.

326
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,322
Excuse me, just one sec...

327
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,860
You boys have been playing
in the Kitty Litter.

328
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,837
No, we have to ride in garbage truck.

329
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,033
Have you seen the enchanted peasant girl?

330
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,805
No. But you could imagine me
in a different outfit.

331
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,869
<i>- Ja.
- Come on. We have to find her.</i>

332
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:32,007
- Here, have a little.
- That's nice.

333
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,984
We have to get ourselves
some new clothes.

334
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,314
<i>Ja, we do stink.</i>

335
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,627
What are you so nervous about?
You were made for each other.

336
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,958
Estelle, this is Clark.

337
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,511
I command you to come to life.

338
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,797
I must be crazy.

339
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,533
Oh, yeah.

340
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,837
There is definitely
something wrong with me.

341
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:35,141
2.5 billion women in the world
and I'm trying to score with a statue.

342
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,178
<i>- Gesundheit.
Danke schön.</i>

343
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,051
You're welcome. Whoa! Whoa!

344
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,353
- My prince.
- Stay back.

345
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,951
Why are you running?

346
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,724
Why am I running? Why are you moving?

347
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,264
I saw you in the water
and in the fast wagon.

348
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,498
Water. That's it.

349
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:06,237
It's the toxins in the river,
they do strange things to your brain!

350
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,472
My prince, why are you doing this?

351
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,710
- Have you lost your memory?
- My memory.

352
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,980
- This is a dream.
- It is I.

353
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,953
Jessie, your true love.

354
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,761
- You're real?
- Of course I am.

355
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,828
You're beginning to frighten me.

356
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,799
When was the last time
we saw each other?

357
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,894
I mean, before our little swim today.

358
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,905
Just a few minutes ago, on the bridge.

359
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,770
- What bridge?
- The one near the castle.

360
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,833
We were on our way to be married.

361
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,936
Don't you remember
the soldiers and the sorcerer?

362
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,977
The legend is true.

363
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,617
What legend?

364
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,722
That sorcerer guy, he put a curse on you.

365
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,127
You've been frozen for 1,000 years.

366
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:04,429
- Oh, my Prince William, always joking.
- Yeah.

367
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,401
I'm not kidding.

368
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,497
This is the 20th century.

369
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,738
- 20th?
- Yeah.

370
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,472
Look.

371
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,916
Bet you've never seen one of these before.

372
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,612
Sure I have. Those are jesters' shoes.

373
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,921
Jesters' shoes.

374
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:29,424
- Hey, how about one of these?
- No, I'm not sure.

375
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,829
Oh, I guess she is real.

376
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,961
- Anything?
- Nothing.

377
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,136
The Count will have us
tarred and feathered.

378
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,302
Yes. Then he will torture us.

379
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,677
Hi.

380
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:56,010
No, no, no, no. Just lie still for a minute.

381
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,255
Are you okay?

382
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,523
I love you.

383
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,462
I'm Jason Williamson of Germantown, PA.

384
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:10,023
- I'm not a prince.
- I don't care. I still love you.

385
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:14,060
- I think you're still in shock.
- Forever and ever and ever.

386
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,369
I don't even know you.

387
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,308
Yes, you do.
You just haven't realized it yet.

388
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,643
You really do love me, don't you?

389
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,545
More than anyone is going to
in your whole life.

390
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,017
I think she's here.

391
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,612
Who is that?
- I know this is the place.

392
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,617
It's him, the guy from the river.

393
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,994
What have you done
with the enchanted peasant girl?

394
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,464
You guys are not
supposed to be back here.

395
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,057
I'm gonna have to call security.

396
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,795
There she is.

397
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,802
That was a close one.

398
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,702
Not a word of this to the Count.

399
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,211
<i>- We don't want to get him upset.
- Ja, ja, ja.</i>

400
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,273
If we don't go to the airport to greet him,
he will be upset.

401
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,912
Guys, you know, she's gonna be okay here.

402
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:06,788
I mean, we lock this up at night.
It's very safe.

403
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,452
Oh, good. Let's go.

404
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,654
Thanks a lot, little fellow.

405
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,394
Hey.

406
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,706
- Who were they?
- Don't do that anymore.

407
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,570
What do they want with me?

408
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:33,240
You're a national treasure.
Those were your personal guards.

409
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,945
I don't like them very much.

410
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,554
What's that noise?

411
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,916
It's my stomach.
I haven't eaten in 1,000 years.

412
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,091
Come on. I know a great place near here
where we can go to eat.

413
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,499
Oh, good. Do they have boiled weasel?

414
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,764
You won't be able to tell the difference.

415
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:58,172
And the first thing we need to do
is get you something to wear.

416
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,440
- Do you remember this?
- Sure, it's your necklace.

417
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,447
Right.

418
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,686
Hello!

419
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,153
Hello!

420
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,454
This is so much fun!

421
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,119
The lights are beautiful!

422
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,163
So, when the little person is blinking,
then you can walk?

423
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:27,295
- Right.
- Wow! I love cars! I love electricity!

424
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,569
I love America! How does it all work?

425
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:34,874
Well, that's gonna take
a little longer to explain.

426
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,278
There you go.

427
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:56,332
So, what do you think?
Is it better than weasel?

428
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,767
Well, it's not as salty, but it's good.

429
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,897
It's the best meal I've had in 1,000 years.

430
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:05,136
It'll probably stay with you
for another thousand, too.

431
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,110
What's the crunchy stuff?

432
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,304
There's not supposed to be
any crunchy stuff.

433
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,616
That's the paper.
You're eating the wrapper.

434
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,813
You don't eat this outside, white stuff.

435
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:20,380
- It's good. Try it. It's good.
- No. Thanks.

436
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,889
Listen, you know,
you're gonna need a place to stay.

437
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,193
And I was thinking,
you're welcome to stay at my house.

438
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,823
Really. I mean, no strings attached.

439
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,961
You know, you'll need an address
for, like, a green card for a job.

440
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:36,097
What do you do? What do you like to do?

441
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,871
Well, at first I wanted to be a sheepherder.

442
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,141
But every time I got near the sheep,
I would sneeze.

443
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,704
So, then I tried weaving.

444
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,220
And I can weave an entire blanket
in 17 months.

445
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,948
- No!
- That's pretty fast.

446
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,081
That's amazing.

447
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,184
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

448
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,623
Are you betrothed?

449
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,666
Betrothed?

450
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,760
Well, I'm just gonna tell you.

451
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,305
There is someone I've been seeing.

452
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,898
I'd like to introduce you to her, if it's okay.

453
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,644
Harriet. Harriet, this is Jessie.

454
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:17,078
Jessie, this is Harriet.
Please don't embarrass me in front of her.

455
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:21,107
No, no. It's not what you're thinking.

456
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,711
You are so suspicious. She's terrible.

457
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,885
And no, I'm not betrothed to anybody.

458
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,621
Yay!

459
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,221
All right, people.

460
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,426
- Give me an "H"!
H.

461
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,992
- Give me an "A."
- A.

462
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,805
People, where is your enthusiasm?

463
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,864
Everybody to move! Move!

464
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,604
- Get out of the way!
- Move! Move!

465
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,158
- Give me an "H"!
H.

466
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,594
- Give me an "A"!
A.

467
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,860
- Give me a "U".
- U.

468
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,006
Count Gunter Spretzle
of Hauptmann-Koenig.

469
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,277
Koenig.

470
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,913
Koenig.

471
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,115
May I say what a pleasure it is to...

472
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,714
On behalf of...

473
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,894
On behalf of Prince and Company...

474
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,396
What you look at?

475
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,632
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Sorry.

476
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,036
On behalf of Prince and Company,

477
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,974
may I say what a pleasure it is
to have you hair.

478
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,438
Wart! Here!

479
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,447
It's a pleasure
to have you here.

480
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,220
- Count Spritzle...
- Spretzle.

481
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,281
Pretty.

482
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,086
May I present Hollywood Montrose,

483
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,357
our chief of visual merchandising
and an artist, in every sense of the word.

484
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,866
He is the gentleman
who is in charge of your display.

485
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:20,166
This peacock here
put his hands on my statue?

486
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,566
Listen, have you ever thought about

487
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,200
putting a few African trading beads
à la Bo Derek on that?

488
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,710
It would be absolutely smashing.

489
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,679
Just a suggestion. Ow!

490
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:34,446
Count Spretzle, I think you'll be pleased
at our handling of your presentation.

491
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,615
Good. And you promise that this
will bring attention to my country?

492
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,918
National publicity.

493
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:44,223
Good, because my tourism, you know,
income is down slightly. We...

494
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:49,232
Oh, I don't know, we gross maybe
$52 and change last year.

495
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,633
And we would like to get it up to maybe,
oh, I don't know, three figure next time.

496
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:56,196
Perhaps, you should charge
admission to see that face.

497
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,673
What he say?

498
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:02,578
He said he has such admiration
for Your Grace.

499
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,810
Well, that's okay.

500
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,374
Good. Well, your car is waiting.

501
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,920
It's waiting.

502
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,882
Hollywood, just walk fast.
I've got an important meeting to go to.

503
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,053
That hair!

504
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,724
Are my accommodations ready?
Oh, yeah, the very best in the city.

505
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,359
Take us to the YMCA, and step on it.

506
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:29,470
- Slippers! Wow! Look at all the colors.
- Some things never change.

507
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,902
Okay. All right, stand right here.

508
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,605
Close your eyes.

509
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:40,115
That's good. Turn around. Okay. Smile.

510
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,414
Okay. Open your eyes.

511
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,182
- Get me out of the box!
- Shh! It's okay.

512
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,749
She's fine. She's a little...
It's this cheese steak.

513
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,351
You're okay. Okay, look.

514
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,796
See, you're out of the box now.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

515
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:59,098
- You saved my life. I'm so lucky.
- Yeah.

516
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,536
I guess we're both pretty lucky.

517
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,834
Come on.

518
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:06,802
Oh, yeah, yeah. Come on in.
Nice to see you again.

519
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,312
Oh, the crab dudes.
These dudes must be all right.

520
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,678
Come on in and have a good time.

521
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:15,276
Oh, definitely. Definitely. How you doing?
Your boyfriend still in prison?

522
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,843
Yeah.
- Good.

523
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,684
No, no, no, no. You go on.

524
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,348
Look, just join your friend.

525
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,222
What'd you all do?
Take the bus up from Jersey?

526
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,726
Get on out of here.

527
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,094
Hey, lose your boyfriend, you're in, darling.

528
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,599
- Bye, Tony.
- Step off, Junior.

529
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,464
Oh, let's go in here.

530
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,165
No, this is the most exclusive club
in the city.

531
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,707
I've been trying to get in here
since it opened, there's no way.

532
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,107
Oh, that's too bad.
It's just for royalty, huh?

533
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,477
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Goldilocks. Come here.

534
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:47,040
- Girl, where have you been all my life?
- Frozen.

535
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,347
I can dig that.

536
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,821
Yeah, come on in. Come on in.

537
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,381
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.

538
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,827
Hey, you and me dance a little later? Yeah.

539
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,465
Hey, what's this, prom night?

540
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,401
Take a hike, man. Go on. I hate taffeta.

541
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,380
I have to go into the trees.

542
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,888
- The trees?
- You know, someplace private.

543
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,929
Oh, the ladies' room.
Here, it's right over here.

544
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:40,495
- Thank you.
- Right through there. I'm gonna stay here.

545
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,833
Sorry.

546
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,174
- Wow.
- Hi.

547
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,348
That's really beautiful.

548
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,384
Passion Pink. All the guys love it.

549
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,851
You want to try?

550
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,586
Thank you.

551
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,956
Look, you have to turn it. Like this.

552
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,120
Oh.

553
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,630
Did you make that?

554
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,727
- You've never tried lipstick before?
- No.

555
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,734
Well, you put it on, you rub it on your lips.

556
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,441
And then you go like this.

557
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,585
- Okay?
- Oh, yeah. Everything's just fine.

558
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,221
Still here.

559
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,991
And what about you know who?

560
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:40,955
Who?

561
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,524
Who?
The enchanted peasant girl, you idiot.

562
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,433
- That's who.
- Oh, yeah.

563
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,836
<i>- Is she safe?
- Ja. Yes, of course.</i>

564
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,670
Good. Good. Oh, that's good.

565
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,302
You see, my plan, it is working.

566
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,905
We have succeed to get her
and the jewels out of Hauptmann-Koenig.

567
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,951
In a few weeks, we be off to Bermuda.

568
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,383
Bermuda.

569
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,083
Never to return to that queen
and that armpit of country again.

570
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,890
What country is that?

571
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,297
Hauptmann-Koenig, stupid!

572
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,478
I'm sorry, honey, but the bartender's
never heard of yak's milk,

573
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,785
so I brought you Pepsi instead.

574
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,325
- You want to run a tab?
- Yeah, thanks.

575
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:46,989
It's diet soda.
No calories, no sugar, no caffeine.

576
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,965
Oh, we had something like that
back home called water.

577
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,934
This is easier to find.

578
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,132
Well, I love this place.

579
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,467
Mmm.

580
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,538
Good.

581
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,181
- Do you want to dance?
- Oh, I'd love to.

582
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,546
All right, let's go!

583
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,655
- Hi, precious.
- I think he's cute.

584
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,396
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hello.

585
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,733
- Are you a general?
- I'm a notary public.

586
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,397
- You wanna dance, baby?
- I already have a man.

587
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,942
Come on, feel the beat.

588
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,538
Okay.

589
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,477
That's it.

590
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,076
Are you under some kind of a spell?

591
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,657
- Come on, Jessie, follow me.
- I'm trying.

592
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:05,906
Wait. Wait. That's not dancing.

593
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:09,139
That's not dancing. This is dancing.

594
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:59,296
<i>I've danced alone a thousand times</i>

595
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:07,231
<i>To songs that no one else could even hear</i>

596
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:13,508
<i>I've reached into the flame of love</i>

597
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:20,576
<i>I couldn't hold it
And it disappeared</i>

598
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,646
<i>I've lived to learn to hate the blues</i>

599
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,491
<i>I've lived with everything but you</i>

600
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,292
<i>I can't believe my eyes</i>

601
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,732
<i>I see you here</i>

602
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,463
<i>Lookin'just the way you should</i>

603
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,565
Now, you comfortable?

604
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:47,537
As comfortable as I can be
in front of the probing eye of the camera.

605
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,806
Oh, come on,
you're not on national television.

606
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,043
This is just your own
personal dating videocassette.

607
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,886
Now, relax. We're rolling.

608
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,887
Okay. What is your name?

609
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,155
I am Mr...

610
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,390
- Jones.
- Good. Very good.

611
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:09,365
And, Mr. Jones,
what is it that you do for a living?

612
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,628
Well, I am the manager of a major...

613
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,703
Dog...

614
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,205
Pet...

615
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,833
A major pet emporium.

616
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:26,778
Now, tell me, what is the most
exciting thing that ever happened to you?

617
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,985
That would have to be knee surgery.

618
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,815
You know,
I think we should take a different tack.

619
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,168
- Is this your cottage?
- Yeah.

620
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,729
Your mother must be a very wealthy lady.

621
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:53,072
Well, as a matter of fact,
she does have her own business,

622
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:56,135
but we don't want
to discuss it with her. Okay?

623
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,579
We'll just... We'll be very quiet.

624
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,446
- Okay.
- Okay.

625
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,357
Here is our dating dossier.

626
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,360
You just look under the category
that you're interested in.

627
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:15,455
Age range, personality preferences.
You know, it's all listed.

628
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,366
- Oh, you're home late.
- Oh, yeah.

629
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,903
Stopped off to look at an apartment.

630
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,439
Well, you know, it wouldn't be
the end of the world if you stayed here.

631
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:27,273
This is a perfectly nice, normal home.

632
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,805
Mom, I'm a big boy now.

633
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,179
I need to be on my own, okay?

634
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,850
Good night.

635
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,351
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I've changed my mind.

636
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,395
I've made a terrible mistake.

637
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,623
You don't know me.
I have never been here.

638
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,290
You have never seen me.

639
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,133
I have never ever... Oh, I'm sorry.

640
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,639
Here's $10. Here's money for the tape.

641
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,834
I'll pay for that. Send me the bill.

642
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,377
Wow. This is a palace.

643
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,059
I love the 20th century.

644
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,660
This little painting looks so real.

645
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,969
It must have been done by a great artist.

646
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,203
It's a snapshot taken by my Uncle Bob.

647
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,243
That's my dad.

648
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,076
He... He passed away a couple of months
after that was taken.

649
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,344
You both have the same smile.

650
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:46,179
I wish I had a snapshot painting
of my family.

651
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,655
I miss them so much.

652
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,524
Yeah. I know what you mean.

653
00:43:56,333 --> 00:44:02,135
You know, sometimes
I can picture myself back in your time.

654
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:08,006
A prince alone in a strange land,
armed only with my sword,

655
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:09,739
taking on the world for love.

656
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,486
- It's just a fantasy.
- No, you are a prince.

657
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,546
As great and valiant as there ever was.

658
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,428
I'm so glad I'm not alone anymore.

659
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,864
I'm never gonna leave you alone.

660
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,136
Good night.

661
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:10,797
<i>Girl, there's so much
in this world that I'm sure of</i>

662
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:19,107
<i>But, girl, I believe
what I need now is your love</i>

663
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,316
<i>The way you touch me with your eyes</i>

664
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,856
<i>The way you heat me up inside</i>

665
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:31,360
<i>Is why I want you</i>

666
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:35,057
<i>And I want you to feel the way that I do</i>

667
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:38,659
<i>Like I do, like I do
I want you</i>

668
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,568
<i>And I want you to feel the way that I do</i>

669
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:46,005
<i>Like I do, like I do</i>

670
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,102
<i>Gotta say the words you've got</i>

671
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,748
<i>Of all the things that get me hot</i>

672
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,114
<i>That's why I want you</i>

673
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:58,382
<i>And I want you to feel the way that I do</i>

674
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,584
<i>Like I do, like I do
I want you</i>

675
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:06,856
<i>And I want you to feel the way that I do</i>

676
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,693
<i>Like I do, like I do</i>

677
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,667
You, cooking? What's the occasion?

678
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,293
- I'm hungry.
- Uh-huh.

679
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,305
And, by the way, who's in the bathroom?

680
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,274
A friend. No questions, please.

681
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,504
I always respect your privacy.

682
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,036
- Did you sleep with this friend?
- No, I slept on the couch, thank you.

683
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,776
And, Mom,
thanks for respecting my privacy.

684
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:29,315
No problem.

685
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,149
- Where'd you meet her?
- At work.

686
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,553
She's a model.

687
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,252
Foreign, I think from Bavaria.

688
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,853
Bavaria. Oh, your father always claimed
to have royal Bavarian blood.

689
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,524
Of course, he also claimed
to be a Harvard graduate,

690
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,727
the only one who ever worked
at Abe's Fish Market.

691
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:50,568
- Did you ever hear of a Prince William?
- No, but I'd sure like to meet one.

692
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,901
- Am I gonna meet her?
- No.

693
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,179
That's my kid.

694
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,208
Jessie.

695
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,316
Good morning. Jessie.

696
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:11,188
Will you stop doing that?
I can't tell if you're kidding or not.

697
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,724
Jessie?

698
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,322
Hello?

699
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,228
Oh, no.

700
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:24,107
Come on, Jessie. Come on.
You're real. Yes, you are.

701
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,106
Come on. Come on, baby. Come on.

702
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,813
Don't... Don't... Don't be a dummy now!

703
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,943
Come on, please.

704
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:37,910
You're so hard.

705
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,584
I'm talking to a dummy.
I was dancing with a dummy.

706
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,060
Breakfast. Come on, eat!

707
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,201
Oh, God.

708
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,229
Come on, honey.

709
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,734
Jason, what are you doing?

710
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,441
This is the girl
you brought home last night?

711
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:07,074
- It's not what you're thinking, Mom.
- And you want your own apartment.

712
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:29,569
<i>I've danced alone a thousand times</i>

713
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,877
<i>To songs that no one else could even hear</i>

714
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:37,778
Care for anything else?

715
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,180
- Either of you?
- No, thank you.

716
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,381
<i>I've reached into the flame of love</i>

717
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,648
<i>I couldn't hold it
And it disappeared</i>

718
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,316
Thank you.

719
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,691
Darling, I need the banner over here.

720
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,630
Yes, oh, that looks smashing, fellows.
You're doing a wonderful job.

721
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,600
- Hollywood, you got a second?
- Always have time for a man in uniform.

722
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,968
Yeah, how can I get Gail
over in Perfumes to notice me?

723
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,597
Well, now, Andy, I am flattered.

724
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,733
Of all the people here
at Prince and Company,

725
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,972
you've chosen counsel
from the Gangster of Love.

726
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,242
No one else had any ideas.

727
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,373
Mmm-hmm.

728
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,746
- Gail in Perfumes?
- Yeah.

729
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,342
Andy, she is not good enough for you.

730
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,217
You have made overtures
for the past few weeks

731
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,153
and all she has done is ignore you,

732
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:23,249
humiliate you and treat you
like so much dirt on the ground.

733
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,522
So, what do you think?
Buy her chocolates or something?

734
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:29,258
- Jewelry, baby. Jewelry.
- Jewelry. Yeah. What kind?

735
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,962
There is but one kind, Andy. Expensive.

736
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,005
But, Andy, I think you should ignore her.

737
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,938
That always seems to work best.

738
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:42,411
Play hard to get. Thanks, homeboy.
Knew I could count on you.

739
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,447
- Oh, Andy?
- Yeah.

740
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,742
Wedgie.

741
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:51,482
And when you get a chance, I think
you need a visit with the Minister of Style.

742
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,616
Oh, Montrose, the Count is here
to preview the display.

743
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,362
I'm not superstitious, but are you sure
you're supposed to be out in the daylight?

744
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,695
Get back.

745
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,468
Hollywood really is a genius.

746
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,837
His designs have put
Prince and Company on the map.

747
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:16,470
- In fact, he is responsible for...
- I don't care about this nose hair.

748
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,070
He's nothing.

749
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,877
Well, color me hurt.

750
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,919
I want to see
the enchanted peasant girl now.

751
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,453
Right this way, Your Assholiness.

752
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:31,324
- What did he say?
- He said, "This room is a total mess. "

753
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:34,057
- Please.
- Oh, that's okay.

754
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,099
You know, Count,
you should try and lighten up.

755
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:44,004
Not take things so seriously.

756
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,066
Learn to enjoy life more.

757
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,475
Voilà.

758
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,573
- She's gone!
- Where is she?

759
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,482
Where is she?

760
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,521
- Potty.
- Potty?

761
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,415
Search the store! Everybody!
We must found her!

762
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:06,155
And if we don't found her,
I will personally chop off your hands.

763
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,858
And for the rest of you,
I lock you in dark room with rats!

764
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:13,198
Big, ugly rats.
And that is scary, believe me.

765
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,296
Hold the rats, Your Nauseousness.
Here she comes.

766
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,704
Jason.

767
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,802
Jason, come on.

768
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,345
Excuse me.

769
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:32,180
Why you... Why you dress her
in these vulgar clothes, huh?

770
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,780
- Trash! It's absolute trash!
- Junior Miss.

771
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,689
Oh, wait, just a second.

772
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,854
That's from our exclusive
Junior Miss designer collection.

773
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,524
Good. Plugging the store's merchandise.

774
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,431
Well done, Williamson.

775
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,101
You're like the son I never had,
and never really wanted.

776
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:56,202
This is an insult to my entire kingdom.
She is not to be touched again.

777
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,882
We

778
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,249
have met before someplace,
no, what, maybe, yes?

779
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,582
I think I would have remembered.

780
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,728
Well, let's get busy.

781
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,555
We have a presentation.

782
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:19,193
Yes. Perhaps you'd care to see
the rest of the store?

783
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:23,171
No. No, I would like to be alone here
for a moment, please.

784
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,872
You heard
what the count said. Move!

785
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:31,072
Everybody to get out. Move! Move!

786
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,108
Oh, my darling.

787
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:41,714
My darling, very soon,
very soon you be alive, huh?

788
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:49,826
I wait for that moment
as the greatest day in 1,000 year.

789
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,020
Get out of the way.

790
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,990
Well, he's a real charmer.
Probably grows fangs at night.

791
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,265
- Would you like a cappuccino?
- No, thanks.

792
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,668
I'd better get to work.

793
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:45,520
I don't know what happened last night.
I don't even know if you're real.

794
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,791
If you can hear me,
I want you to come back.

795
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,826
I need you to come back, Jessie.

796
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,229
Oh, he's in love. Now, who is Jessie?

797
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,195
Her.

798
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,605
Oh, Jason.

799
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,236
Hear that? Hollow.

800
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,176
Now, we do not fall in love
with empty things

801
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,511
unless, of course, their daddies are rich.

802
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:16,018
And in this case, her daddy's a redwood,
so I'd forget about it.

803
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,783
Hollywood, last night
the most amazing thing happened.

804
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:21,649
What?

805
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,926
Forget it.

806
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,292
Nothing happened.

807
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,731
Okay, well, in that case,
why don't you run down to the storeroom

808
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,064
and get the rest of the wardrobe?

809
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,265
Someone has got to
glitz up this presentation.

810
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,078
You little tart.
What have you done to my protégé?

811
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,810
I'll tell you what.

812
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:51,945
You let me borrow this fierce necklace
and all is forgiven.

813
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:57,487
Oh, me, oh, my, I'm in love with you, baby.

814
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,631
How did I get back in here?

815
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:06,933
What's that?

816
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:10,430
Who's there?

817
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,701
Hello?

818
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:22,146
Are you looking at me?
Are you looking at me?

819
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:25,085
You must be. There's no one else here.

820
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,385
Get back, Bobby De Niro.

821
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,883
<i>Some day</i>

822
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,832
Look at me.
Oh, how about this one?

823
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,771
- Oh, I like that one.
Wait, look at this one.

824
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,172
That's nice.
That goes good with your eyes.

825
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,333
Hello.

826
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,809
All of you look very cute.
Come here, come here, come here.

827
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,246
Come on.
Come here, come here, come here.

828
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,579
We are something, huh?

829
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:59,520
Oh, you are really, really something. Yes.
Oh, yeah, really something.

830
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:03,355
I want you to take hat, both hats,
and put it right over your face.

831
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,019
That's it.

832
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:09,794
You idiots, idiots, idiots!
Now get out of here, and go guard the girl!

833
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,868
Would you like to try
our Black Forest Dew?

834
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:21,138
- It's our Hauptmann-Koenig special.
- Oh, thank you.

835
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:28,975
Oh, that smell reminds me
of my old friend, Inga.

836
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,043
Poor, poor Inga.

837
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:34,056
- What happened to her?
- She was eaten by a boar.

838
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:39,326
Oh, well. Oh, you know Jason.

839
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,923
Jason? Oh, yes.
He let me sleep in his bed last night.

840
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,428
He did?

841
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:51,938
Well, if you don't mind my asking,
how was it?

842
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,339
Wonderful.

843
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,244
He showed me things I never
would have imagined in 1,000 years.

844
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:58,837
I must go find him.

845
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,442
One of these days
I'll rip that wart out of his face

846
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,283
and make him eat it.

847
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,879
Shh! He could be anywhere.

848
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:10,551
Hey, you, fancy guy.
What are you doing with that necklace?

849
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:17,489
This is property of Hauptmann-Koenig

850
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,092
and they are not for you
to play dress up with.

851
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,367
And if we ever, ever catching you...

852
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,807
Listen, the girl is gone again!

853
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,211
What have you done with her?

854
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:36,776
Just let me figure what I'm doing
on the floor and I'll get back to you. Okay?

855
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:44,526
The necklace is here,
but the enchanted peasant girl is gone.

856
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:49,556
You don't think there's really something
to this curse thing?

857
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,430
If it's true,
we have blown our trip to Bermuda!

858
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,060
Bermuda!

859
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,263
We must tell the Count.

860
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:56,566
Egon, you tell him.

861
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,810
Fellas, you are hurting me.
That's my earring.

862
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:06,415
<i>Phone call
for Count Spitzle. Urgent.</i>

863
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,815
<i>Please pick up any white customer phone.</i>

864
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,479
<i>- Spretzle.
- Spretzle.</i>

865
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,113
<i>- That's good.
Count Spretzle.</i>

866
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,681
Hello, Your Majestic Magnificence.

867
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,421
Shut up, Spretzle.
I have been looking for you.

868
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,090
Here I am, Your Queenly Greatness.

869
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,396
I told you I didn't want
this silly publicity tour.

870
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:29,199
Especially now when our weather
has turned so beautiful.

871
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:33,606
Also, someone has stolen
our precious crown jewels, Spretzle.

872
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,906
Heads will roll, do you hear me?

873
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,709
<i>Yours and those three idiots
you brought with you.</i>

874
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,078
<i>- Do you hear me, Spretzle?
- What?</i>

875
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,208
<i>If I don't find those crown jewels...</i>

876
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,445
Your Majesty, I'm sorry, I can't...

877
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,851
Oh, this connection,
it's fading, Your Majesty.

878
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:51,053
It's fading, it's fading away.
I can't hear you no more, you...

879
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,263
Your breasts smell like toe jam. What?

880
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,970
"Dear Count, the enchanted peasant girl

881
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,634
"is missing again.

882
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,510
"Please do not hit us. "

883
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,942
Find her now!

884
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,348
This one's too wide.

885
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:24,453
Wow!

886
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,386
Hello!

887
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,125
You know, we can make your home
look just as nice.

888
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:31,826
I don't have a home.

889
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,734
Oh, it's been nice talking to you.

890
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:38,331
But my friend, Jason,
would love furniture like this.

891
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,844
Well, hello again.

892
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:44,036
This is his picture.

893
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,138
His picture, yes, but...

894
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:51,653
Well, yes, he looks like
he could use some really nice furniture.

895
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,655
Well, I have no silver.

896
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:57,159
Oh, nobody uses cash anymore.

897
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,156
We'll just put it on his employee account.

898
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:05,159
What exactly do you want,
and when would you like it?

899
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,599
Oh, well, it must be soon.

900
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,297
I don't know how much longer
I will stay alive.

901
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:11,540
That's too bad.

902
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:15,374
Well, I have a delivery date this morning.

903
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,673
Oh, good.

904
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:22,275
We can have it delivered then,
and who knows, you may still be alive.

905
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:27,785
It must have been something I ate.
No more sushi at 3:00 a. m.

906
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,882
What's the matter, Hollywood?

907
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,325
I'm not sure, my man. I'm just not sure.

908
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,295
I just got back from a trip to Oz.

909
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,888
- Where's Jessie?
- I don't know.

910
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,160
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Well, she was here,

911
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,896
and when I got back
from the yellow brick road, she was gone.

912
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,370
We gotta find her. She could be in trouble.

913
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,463
Hold on.

914
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,998
You said you wanted to tell me
about last night. What happened?

915
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:53,348
She came to life. She was alive.
I mean, this whole curse thing is true.

916
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,543
I can't explain it. We ate.

917
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:58,086
We walked around. We went dancing.

918
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,317
- I know you think I'm nuts.
- I certainly don't.

919
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,756
This has happened before.

920
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,588
- I believe you.
- You do?

921
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,128
Yes, and we better hurry up and find her

922
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,060
because those goony boys
are looking for her, too.

923
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,723
Come on! Go!

924
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,698
I can't believe it.

925
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:21,039
Arnold, Egon, come here!

926
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,775
Look, the girl.

927
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,573
She's alive! She's moving!

928
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:30,016
- It's not possible.
- Yes, it is her.

929
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:37,749
She know us.

930
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:40,519
Come!

931
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:41,893
Go!

932
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,399
Oh, she isn't even stiff.

933
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,099
That's for sure.

934
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,623
Can I help you?

935
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:17,894
- Could you make me look different?
- Honey, we can change your whole life.

936
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:22,664
<i>Once you did it for pity
And you did it for pride</i>

937
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:26,573
<i>Oh, you did it for fashion
Or some voice inside</i>

938
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,439
<i>Yes, you do it for virtue</i>

939
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,741
<i>Or to prove you're tough</i>

940
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:33,839
<i>Well, if you're gonna do it</i>

941
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,817
<i>Do it for love</i>

942
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,187
<i>Do it for love</i>

943
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:45,859
<i>Now you've done it for money
And you've done it for fame</i>

944
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,625
<i>You might do it for power
Or to win some game</i>

945
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,164
<i>You can do it for kicks
But that's never enough</i>

946
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,898
<i>If you're gonna do it
Do it for love</i>

947
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,064
No.

948
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,837
No, no, no, no, no. It is.

949
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,366
Uh-oh.

950
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,674
It is him!

951
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:07,011
It is him.
I knew I knew that guy someplace.

952
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,246
It is Prince William, curse the ages!

953
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:13,850
<i>Herr Count. Count Spretzle.</i>

954
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,448
Count Spretzle, she's come to life.

955
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:19,723
- The enchanted peasant girl's alive.
- That is impossible.

956
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:24,733
It can't be. No. She is mine tomorrow.
I've spent years calculating the best site!

957
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,134
You know, the exact moment
of her re-animation.

958
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:32,163
Someone has removed the necklace.
Maybe she has found true love.

959
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:36,101
I want... See that guy down there?

960
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:40,582
I want to kill him, I want to hurt him,
and I want to eliminate him now!

961
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,515
Go! Now!

962
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,782
No one, no one messes
with Count Spretzle,

963
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,784
and his love life.

964
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,256
Oh, no! What are you doing?

965
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:56,764
Okay, you mess with Count Spretzle,
I shoot you.

966
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,061
I shoot you not through the mouth,

967
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,728
not through the eye,
but through the heart.

968
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,900
- Anything?
- No, not a trace.

969
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,672
I thought Cupid aimed for the heart.

970
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:13,442
I'll get you this time, my little sweetie pie.

971
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,347
- What the...
- Hit the deck!

972
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:19,649
- I learned this from the Marines.
- You were in the Marines?

973
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:23,249
Yes, they were looking
for a few good men, and so was I.

974
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,323
Okay.

975
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:32,026
- Okay, we better split up.
- Where have I heard that before?

976
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:36,766
- Get down, honey! Get down!
- Get down!

977
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,933
You take the second floor,
I'll take the third. Go.

978
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,077
There he is.

979
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,301
There he is!

980
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,094
It backfired.

981
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,439
Wow, what a fit, and no wrinkles.

982
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,309
- It's polyester.
- Polyester.

983
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,144
What plant is that from?

984
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:24,983
The New Jersey one.
Will this be cash or charge?

985
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:26,885
Who uses cash these days?

986
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,220
- Jessie!
- Jason!

987
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:32,822
- Jason!
We lost him.

988
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,463
I'll be right back.

989
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,568
This time we really kill him!

990
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,309
Hey!

991
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,407
Oh, look out!

992
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:00,947
Jason! Jason, come on!

993
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:02,490
Look out!

994
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,185
Stop her!

995
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,023
Get out of the way!

996
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:09,353
Are you okay? I never thought
I'd see you alive again.

997
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,490
What?

998
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,830
I said I never thought
I'd see you alive again.

999
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:14,893
I can't hear!

1000
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,370
Look out!

1001
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,938
Keep going! Keep going!
Look out! Look out!

1002
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:29,681
Get out! Get out!

1003
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,413
Hold on!

1004
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,395
You okay?

1005
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,023
Look out for the window!

1006
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,330
- Go out the window?
- No! No!

1007
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,740
- Jason!
- Jessie!

1008
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:58,974
- I can't stop it!
- Use the brakes!

1009
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,109
Push the pedal!

1010
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:04,879
Look out!

1011
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:10,121
Hey! Hey, come on! Let's go to the store!

1012
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,396
What the heck is going on here?

1013
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:21,232
Find that boy!
He has stolen enchanted peasant girl.

1014
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:25,239
Montrose. Montrose!
Your new assistant, where is he?

1015
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,504
Let's go.

1016
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,308
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait one minute.

1017
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:42,150
We are going to follow fancy pants.
And get me out of this armor!

1018
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,329
Wow, she's got a great sense of direction.

1019
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,011
Look, your mother gave me
all these people's lives.

1020
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,849
Jessie, I was scared
I was never gonna see you again.

1021
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,981
My love was stolen once before,
but it's never gonna happen again.

1022
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,960
Nothing will ever come between us.

1023
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,601
Could you do that again, please?

1024
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:42,012
- Where did all this furniture come from?
- It's my gift to you.

1025
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:46,316
- You bought it?
- Yeah, with your little magic card.

1026
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:48,050
Ouch!

1027
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,885
Okay. Okay, look,
we're gonna have to get out of here.

1028
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,122
- We gotta go. They're gonna come here.
- Wait, where are we going?

1029
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:57,688
We'll hide anywhere,
we just have to get out of here.

1030
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,837
Wait. I love you.

1031
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,533
What is that?

1032
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,280
Oh, it's too late.
Look, just stay here, okay?

1033
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,750
- Just don't...
- More.

1034
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,548
- Okay, just...
- Again.

1035
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:19,986
Just...

1036
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,567
Oh, Jason, the heat is coming.

1037
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,627
- What's going on?
- Where is she?

1038
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,475
That is him. The peasant girl must be here.

1039
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:41,840
- You're in big trouble, pal.
- Listen, I...

1040
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,172
Search this house.

1041
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:49,843
Check out the back. Nobody escape.
Me, I will look her upstairs.

1042
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:52,581
Hey, no! You can't go up there!

1043
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:54,816
Don't ever, ever touch a count. Okay?

1044
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,188
When I want to go up the stairs,
I go up the stairs.

1045
01:09:57,259 --> 01:10:00,194
And I feel like going up the stairs now.

1046
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:01,752
You have the right to remain silent.

1047
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:04,094
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1048
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:07,260
- It's you!
- No, it's not.

1049
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,065
You understand these rights?

1050
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:12,699
- Don't be afraid to use the gun.
- You can't threaten my son!

1051
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,305
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1052
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,211
Is everything all right?

1053
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:26,686
Everything is perfect.

1054
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:27,983
Sorcerer.

1055
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,788
Oh, my little sweetie pie,
you have to come with me because,

1056
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,590
well, we must fulfill our destiny.

1057
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:37,689
I love Jason.
You can't make me go with you.

1058
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,837
Here now,

1059
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,836
my lovely.

1060
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,614
You've even been stealing
furniture from us. Shame!

1061
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:05,126
I didn't steal it. She bought it for me.

1062
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:08,925
- Who? The enchanted peasant girl?
- Yes!

1063
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:10,989
You are a certified sicko.

1064
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,195
And to think I even gave you my flower.

1065
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,670
Oh, look, there's your main squeeze.

1066
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:22,302
Jessie. Come on, let her go.
Look, she's real, I swear!

1067
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:27,338
Oh, my God! He's in love with a dummy.

1068
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,543
Wait a minute, honey.
I was gonna do that.

1069
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:33,315
Okay, we have what we come for. Right?
Now, to the airport, quick.

1070
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:35,152
Just one little minute.

1071
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:38,421
Count, we have a presentation
tomorrow afternoon.

1072
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:39,859
I know that but...

1073
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:43,955
And we have a contract
that you are not going to break.

1074
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,524
- I know that but...
- Grab the dummy.

1075
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,864
The other dummy.

1076
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,067
Easy, easy, easy. All right, it's all right.

1077
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,408
You must be very, very gentle.

1078
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,414
The necklace!
That's it! That's what he's using!

1079
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,747
Just take the necklace off,
you'll see she's real. I swear!

1080
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,481
- Take it off!
- Yes, and I'm Rumpelstiltskin.

1081
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,386
Get him out of here.

1082
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:10,152
No, no, it's true. It's true.

1083
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:14,355
No one could make up a story like that,
except perhaps someone like myself.

1084
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:18,193
And, Count, please,
don't worry your pretty little wart...

1085
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,201
Face about all this.

1086
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:24,137
We'll have some very large,
armed gentlemen to guard her.

1087
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,175
Tomorrow afternoon, she'll be all yours.

1088
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,072
Thank you so much.

1089
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:35,249
I never had this problem at Kmart.

1090
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,246
Too much red meat.

1091
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:40,712
All right, come on.

1092
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:48,256
So, all we have to do is wait till
the presentation is over tomorrow.

1093
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,890
They will hand us the girl.

1094
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,964
Then it's off to Bermuda.

1095
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,334
Bermuda!

1096
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:59,374
Up, shut up!
Go on, get on now. Go, go, go.

1097
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,908
<i>Go, ja. Go.</i>

1098
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,917
I am so sorry, madam,
to have taken all your time.

1099
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,986
Once again left holding the bag.

1100
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,587
Oh, nothing personal.

1101
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:34,235
<i>I've danced alone a thousand times</i>

1102
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:41,648
<i>To songs that no one else could even hear</i>

1103
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:47,652
<i>I've reached into the flame of love</i>

1104
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:55,222
<i>I couldn't hold it
And it disappeared</i>

1105
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:00,032
<i>I've lived to learn to hate the blues</i>

1106
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:06,873
<i>I've lived with everything but you</i>

1107
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:09,972
<i>I can't believe my eyes</i>

1108
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:13,606
<i>I see you here</i>

1109
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:17,482
<i>Lookin'just the way you should</i>

1110
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:23,048
<i>Oh, so good
It's too good to be true</i>

1111
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:26,691
<i>I lived my life</i>

1112
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:29,791
<i>To be lying here with you</i>

1113
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:42,799
I'm here to pick up one of my men
and take him downtown.

1114
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,744
- We are downtown.
- Oh.

1115
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:51,411
I mean down downtown. Way, way down.
He's gonna be digging latrines for years.

1116
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,647
Who are you?

1117
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,451
Staff Sergeant Montrose, sir.
Butch Montrose.

1118
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:56,821
What do you want with the prisoner?

1119
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,122
Well, he took a powder, you know.
What's that word?

1120
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,754
- AWOL?
- That's it.

1121
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,126
He's gonna be court-martialed
at 2500 hours.

1122
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:10,228
- You got a name?
- Staff Sergeant Butch Montrose.

1123
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,967
Not yours, the prisoner's.

1124
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:16,670
Oh. Williamson, sir. Jason Williamson.

1125
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:20,613
- The nut with the dummy!
- I know. It's sad, isn't it?

1126
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,480
Hey, Al, take this guy
down to the holding cell.

1127
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:27,113
Give him 307, you know, the dummy kid.

1128
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,713
Thank you, sir.

1129
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:31,884
Hey,

1130
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:35,493
You didn't sign these.

1131
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:39,666
So sorry.

1132
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:42,494
Ta.

1133
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,414
Williamson, got a friend of yours here.

1134
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,861
Williamson, follow me.

1135
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:15,601
- I hope this works.
- Too outrageous not to.

1136
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:23,137
Let those feet hit that street.

1137
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,805
- Hey!
- We're moving.

1138
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:27,246
Hold it right there!

1139
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,045
Run, Jason!

1140
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:30,550
Get back here!

1141
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:32,516
Get back here!

1142
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:34,648
Sorry.

1143
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:36,913
Car!

1144
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,958
- Mom!
- Come on, what kind of kid did I raise?

1145
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:43,520
You got cops on your tail,
you keep your head down!

1146
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,464
I have to save her, Hollywood.

1147
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:48,298
They are guarding her like Fort Knox.
But, hold on tight.

1148
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,770
This old bossman's got a plan.

1149
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:04,178
Sheila Barberstein and her sister.
Sheila's father does marvelous work.

1150
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:06,413
Nice to see you.

1151
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:09,685
Well, Count. May I call you Gunter?

1152
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,287
No, no. Uh-uh.

1153
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:16,059
Everything seems to be going
very smoothly.

1154
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,793
Well, you better hope
it stay that way, huh?

1155
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:22,200
Yes. Well, I've personally attended
to every...

1156
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,801
<i>Oh, my God. Teen-A-Rama, Philadelphia.</i>

1157
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:29,139
You know what this means?
We'll be swamped with teenagers.

1158
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:33,272
- That's terrible, sir.
- No, that's wonderful, you tall twit.

1159
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:36,647
Teens are insatiable consumers.
They spend hard cash. Take a memo.

1160
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:40,415
Mark everything in the
Junior Department up 10ºº. 15ºº.

1161
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,480
I want to be sure
that the Prince and Company banner

1162
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:44,218
will be prominently displayed on...

1163
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:46,385
Will be prominently displayed
on the screen at all times.

1164
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,793
Relax, man, I'm not the director.

1165
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:52,095
Is there someone I can talk to
who will give me a little respect here?

1166
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,566
I doubt it.

1167
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,039
Thanks a lot. Gotta bail.

1168
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:01,940
Hey, any time. Any time you want the job.

1169
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,534
Good luck.

1170
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,204
- Oh, careful!
- Careful!

1171
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:14,080
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, the show is about to begin.</i>

1172
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:18,183
I must say, I did not think
that you could pull this off.

1173
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,353
It is very, very dignified.

1174
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:24,661
Well, thank you, sir.
When it comes to dignity, I am the master.

1175
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,098
Yes, fine.

1176
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:29,001
Then you will reach perfection
when you zip up your fly.

1177
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:31,096
I'm just kidding. It's a Count Spretzle joke.

1178
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:34,001
Hello.

1179
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:37,910
Is everything in readiness
for our immediate departure?

1180
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:41,676
- Transportation has been arranged.
- Very good. Very good indeed. Very good.

1181
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,156
I don't know if you can hear me or not,

1182
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:52,989
but if you can,

1183
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,586
I want you to take
very good care of Jason.

1184
01:18:55,664 --> 01:19:01,660
He's a prime catch,
and you are a very, very lucky mannequin.

1185
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,967
Hey, hey. Who are you talking to?

1186
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:07,531
Just wishing her luck.
She's the star of the show, you know.

1187
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:17,281
What are you doing here?
You're 10 minutes late.

1188
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:21,345
- I just love all that hair.
- Why, thank you. Here, it's yours.

1189
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,583
It's the wrong style, honey.

1190
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:24,090
Do you really think
we're gonna pull this off?

1191
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,423
<i>Of course, mi amigo. You better get going.</i>

1192
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:27,621
Okay.

1193
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:30,856
Come on, girls.
Less than a minute. Let's go.

1194
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,923
The lights. The excitement.

1195
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:35,698
Showbiz is my life.

1196
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,145
Oh, excuse me.
I'm Muriel Dawn Williamson.

1197
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:43,794
You. You call this dignified?

1198
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:48,365
Well, I think it's kind of hip
in a rad sort of way.

1199
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,877
There she goes! There she goes!

1200
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:52,504
Come on, baby.

1201
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:57,648
<i>Once upon a time</i>

1202
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,916
<i>a peasant girl was victim of a crime</i>

1203
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,592
<i>Was frozen ever since</i>

1204
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,993
<i>she dared to love the handsome prince</i>

1205
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:11,123
<i>Is that so wrong?</i>

1206
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:14,965
<i>But, alas, a thousand years have passed</i>

1207
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:18,767
<i>since that spell from hell had been cast</i>

1208
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:22,599
Where is she?

1209
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:26,775
<i>Today, my friends, that spell will end</i>

1210
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:29,612
There she comes!
There she comes!

1211
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,948
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1212
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,716
<i>Prince and Company is proud to present</i>

1213
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:38,885
<i>our beloved enchanted peasant girl.</i>

1214
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:51,604
<i>And here to free her forever
with the kiss of life,</i>

1215
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,163
<i>the prince.</i>

1216
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,569
That's my kid.

1217
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:08,949
Stop this music!

1218
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:13,859
Stop this nonsense!
I will not. I will not let it continue!

1219
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:19,162
- Count Spretzle...
- No one, no one treats my culture like this.

1220
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:24,063
<i>Someone stop this fool
before I strike him with this microphone.</i>

1221
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:25,868
<i>He's about to ruin my presentation.</i>

1222
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,866
- Get him out of here!
- Let's go.

1223
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,570
Outrageous!

1224
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,908
Go ahead, laugh.

1225
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:36,747
Laugh and have fun,
my little stupid Americans.

1226
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,649
Boo!

1227
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,157
Boo to you, too. Boo.
Because this party is now over.

1228
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:48,161
And I am taking my peasant girl
and getting out of here.

1229
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,129
Boo!

1230
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:55,295
Unhand that damsel.
I command you to step aside.

1231
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:57,895
Are you kidding me or what?

1232
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:01,033
She belong to me.

1233
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:03,771
She is a living soul. She belongs to no one.

1234
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:07,838
Then we will settle this like men.

1235
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:17,019
Come on, Jason. For love and honor!

1236
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:20,255
Come on, Count.
For money and Bermuda!

1237
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,352
Shut up.

1238
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,693
I come from a long line of fencers.
I have royal Bavarian blood.

1239
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:28,861
Which I will be happy to shed!

1240
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:37,376
I wait 1,000 year for this moment,

1241
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:42,280
and no pipsqueak like you
is going to interfere with that destiny.

1242
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,139
Touché.

1243
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:24,319
Looks so painful.

1244
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,186
Good.

1245
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,705
- Jason.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

1246
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:49,875
Come on, you've got to be kidding.
That's not fair.

1247
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,782
So I cheat. Sue me!

1248
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:55,550
This is my store,
my presentation and career. How dare...

1249
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:01,856
I'm in trouble. Get a doctor, on the double.

1250
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,091
"I'm in trouble.
Get a doctor, on the double. "

1251
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:05,291
Stop it! Stop it!

1252
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:06,424
"Stop it! Stop it!"

1253
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:09,334
This fairy tale's gone far enough, huh?

1254
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,070
- Come here, my dear.
- No!

1255
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:18,238
No? Look! Look! Look! Look!
Look! Look at this! No! Come here!

1256
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:23,642
Don't you move. You move. Come on.

1257
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:25,413
That's it.

1258
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:28,352
Nobody move.

1259
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:31,553
Come on.

1260
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:38,361
He's not getting away with this.
- I'm right behind you.

1261
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,561
Come on. Come on.

1262
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:44,296
- Let me go!
- You want me to use necklace again?

1263
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:46,533
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1264
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:48,508
Keep them back! Keep them back!
Keep them back!

1265
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,066
- I'll take the one on the right.
- Come on.

1266
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,136
- Come on. Come on.
- I'll take them.

1267
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:54,374
Gentlemen, leave them to me.

1268
01:25:57,852 --> 01:26:00,616
- Oh, my eyes.
- That's extra-firm hold, too.

1269
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,650
He's taking her to the roof.
Come on, we'll take the stairs!

1270
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:09,663
- Must we?
- I'll watch the goons.

1271
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:14,168
- Down on your bellies, now!
- Andy, you're so forceful!

1272
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:24,073
I do not believe it!

1273
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:29,873
Let me go!

1274
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:37,585
I thought you got helicopter for me!
What you do?

1275
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:41,023
I thought this would be more romantic.

1276
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:43,063
More romantic?
Get out of the way, you idiot!

1277
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:46,100
Stand aside. Dancing strengthens the legs.

1278
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,732
Stop it!

1279
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,067
Jason.

1280
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,700
Go ahead. Make my day!

1281
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:58,712
Only one little gun?
Honey, I am from North Philadelphia!

1282
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:03,277
- What are you doing?
- It's stuck.

1283
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:04,750
Stand back.

1284
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:12,249
- I'll take care of this.
- No, Hollywood. This is my job.

1285
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:17,028
You're not taking her
to Hauptmann-Koenig, Spretzle!

1286
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:21,095
I won't allow it! Let her go!

1287
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,904
Hauptmann-Koenig?
That dump? Are you crazy?

1288
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:28,670
We are on our way to Bermuda.

1289
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:33,703
Look out!

1290
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:38,182
Allow me.

1291
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,282
- Jason!
No Jason for you.

1292
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:44,291
- Jessie!
- I guess I win, right?

1293
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:46,453
Whoa!

1294
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:48,055
Jason!

1295
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:50,893
That must have been very painful, huh?
But enough of this.

1296
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:54,492
Now that we are finally alone,
at last, in our little balloon,

1297
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:57,538
how about a little smoochie-woochie?

1298
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,129
Leave me alone!

1299
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:01,266
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

1300
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:04,709
Don't ever, ever refuse a count.

1301
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:08,042
No!

1302
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,951
- You want me. Come on. Come on.
- Stop it! Get away!

1303
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:15,888
Spretzle, you let her go! Jason loves her!

1304
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,721
Come, my princess,
you must learn to obey me.

1305
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:19,817
Stop it!

1306
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:22,522
- Not if I have anything to say about it.
Jason!

1307
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:30,866
Oh, I can't do it.

1308
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,273
Good. Good. That's very good.

1309
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:39,143
- But guess what? I can.
- No! No!

1310
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:45,108
- Let him go!
- Down, my little prince. Down you go.

1311
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:49,283
Goodbye, my little pest.

1312
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:54,761
In 1,000 years, on a single day,
only if you love me, take the curse away.

1313
01:28:57,932 --> 01:29:00,400
Jason, it worked.

1314
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:04,835
Oh, no!

1315
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:06,806
Catch him!

1316
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:10,173
No! No!

1317
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:13,042
- No!
- Oh, no!

1318
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:17,048
- Count.
- I can't believe it.

1319
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:20,110
We've blown our trip to Bermuda!

1320
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:22,181
Wait.

1321
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:26,625
If we be putting him back together
and finding him a true love,

1322
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:28,423
he will be coming back to life.

1323
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:31,363
<i>Ja.
- Wait, look out!</i>

1324
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:45,438
- Oh, my prince.
- My princess.

1325
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:48,107
- Forever.
- And ever.

1326
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:05,458
And that is the legend of Count Spretzle.

1327
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:08,366
Of course, nobody really believes it.

1328
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:11,963
Now, if you'll come this way,
I'll show you our Hall of Galoshes.

1329
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:16,766
<i>Looking in your eyes
I see a paradise</i>

1330
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:22,043
<i>This world that I've found
Is too good to be true</i>

1331
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:26,712
<i>Standing here beside you
Want so much to give you</i>

1332
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:31,782
<i>This love in my heart
that I'm feeling for you</i>

1333
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:37,620
<i>Let 'em say we're crazy
I don't care about that</i>

1334
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:39,859
<i>Put your hand in my hand, baby</i>

1335
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:42,596
<i>Don't ever look back</i>

1336
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:47,073
<i>Let the world around us just fall apart</i>

1337
01:30:47,742 --> 01:30:52,645
<i>Baby, we can make it
if we're heart to heart</i>

1338
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:56,881
<i>And we can build this dream together</i>

1339
01:30:56,951 --> 01:31:03,220
<i>Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now</i>

1340
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,988
<i>And if this world runs out of lovers</i>

1341
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:09,495
<i>We'll still have each other</i>

1342
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:16,026
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now</i>

1343
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:24,443
<i>I'm so glad I found you
I'm not gonna lose you</i>

1344
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:29,142
<i>Whatever it takes
I will stay here with you</i>

1345
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:34,283
<i>Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times</i>

1346
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:39,221
<i>Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do</i>

1347
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:44,622
<i>Let 'em say we're crazy
What do they know</i>

1348
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:47,329
<i>Put your arms around me, baby</i>

1349
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:49,767
<i>Don't ever let go</i>

1350
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:54,631
<i>Let the world around us just fall apart</i>

1351
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:59,101
<i>Baby, we can make it
if we're heart to heart</i>

1352
01:32:00,448 --> 01:32:04,350
<i>And we can build this dream together</i>

1353
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:10,721
<i>Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now</i>

1354
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:14,386
<i>And if this world runs out of lovers</i>

1355
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:16,930
<i>We'll still have each other</i>

1356
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:23,733
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now</i>

1357
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:31,911
<i>I'm so glad I found you
I'm not gonna lose you</i>

1358
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:36,541
<i>Whatever it takes
I will stay here with you</i>

1359
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:42,014
<i>Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times</i>

1360
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:46,651
<i>Whatever it takes
is what I'm gonna do</i>

1361
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:52,124
<i>Let 'em say we're crazy
What do they know</i>

1362
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,659
<i>Put your arms around me, baby</i>

1363
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:57,431
<i>Don't ever let go</i>

1364
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:02,204
<i>Let the world around us just fall apart</i>

1365
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:06,946
<i>Baby, we can make it
if we're heart to heart</i>

1366
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:11,750
<i>And we can build this dream together</i>

1367
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:14,379
<i>Standing strong forever</i>

1368
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:18,118
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us now</i>

1369
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:21,855
<i>And if this world runs out of lovers</i>

1370
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:24,363
<i>We'll still have each other</i>

1371
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:29,768
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us</i>

1372
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:36,003
<i>Ooh, all that I need is you</i>

1373
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:41,774
<i>All that I ever need</i>

1374
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:46,513
<i>And all that I want to do</i>

1375
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:53,551
<i>Is hold you forever
Ever and ever</i>

1376
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:56,026
<i>Hey!</i>

1377
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:16,807
<i>And we can build this dream together</i>

1378
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:22,686
<i>Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now</i>

1379
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:26,854
<i>And if this world runs out of lovers</i>

1380
01:34:26,927 --> 01:34:29,418
<i>We'll still have each other</i>

1381
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,227
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us</i>

1382
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:34,767
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us</i>

1383
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:37,065
<i>And we can build this dream together</i>

1384
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:39,197
<i>Standing strong forever</i>

1385
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:40,797
<i>Whoa</i>

1386
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:42,638
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us now</i>

1387
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:44,876
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us now</i>

1388
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:46,742
<i>And if this world runs out of lovers</i>

1389
01:34:46,814 --> 01:34:49,374
<i>We'll still have each other</i>

1390
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,441
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us</i>

1391
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:55,080
<i>Us now</i>
