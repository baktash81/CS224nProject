[Watson speaking indistinctly]

4
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:38,950
[Watson] Who are you?

5
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:42,821
I'm your worst nightmare
that's who I am.

6
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:45,291
[shouting] I'm talkin' to you!
That's who!

7
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:47,592
What? I don't give a damn!

8
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,394
You're violatin'
the most basic

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,529
and sacred rights
of a small-business owner.

10
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:53,364
We're talkin' about a kid

11
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:55,366
who doesn't have means
to fight you.

12
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:58,204
I'm gonna bury you,
you motherfucker.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,671
You threatenin' me?

14
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,974
Hey, do it to my face.

15
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,342
You got a pen?

16
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,944
We're at 75 Spring Street,
eighth floor.

17
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:09,347
Come on by. We validate.

18
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:12,917
Good talkin' to you, too,
Senator.

19
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:15,920
- Hey. Hey.
- What? Hey.

20
00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:17,622
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,390
Uh... [clears throat]

22
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:20,625
I'm Richard.

23
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:22,126
I'm sorry I was listening.

24
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:24,128
I didn't mean to be rude.
I wasn't raised like that.

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,899
You always start
every sentence with "I"?

26
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm... [sighs]

27
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:32,470
I'm sorry, sir. I'm the new...

28
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:35,341
I'm the supply room clerk.

29
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:38,042
- [exhales]
- Eavesdropping on me?

30
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:40,111
No, sir.

31
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:42,248
Well, good. I need some
more tape, so get on that.

32
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:44,015
Yeah, about that.

33
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:46,584
You're gonna wanna check
the second drawer down, sir.

34
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,153
Tape and a new box of pens.

35
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:53,925
I saw you were runnin' low.

36
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:55,860
What's that?

37
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:59,163
You might wanna check
the next drawer down.

38
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:00,765
The one on the bottom.

39
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,637
[drawer closes]

40
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,774
How'd you know
I like Snickers?

41
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:12,944
Uh...

42
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:15,381
I knew you liked them
'cause I saw

43
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:18,049
you had the wrappers
in your trash can.

44
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:19,484
[chuckles]

45
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:22,553
Don't go in my trash.

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,822
Nobody goes in my trash.
What's your name?

47
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,026
Richard Jewell.

48
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:31,429
From now on,
I'm gonna call you Radar.

49
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:35,166
Like from <i>M*A*S*H?</i>

50
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:36,434
Get out.

51
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:50,682
[video game gun firing]

52
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:52,483

[video games playing]

55
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:06,664
[sighs]

56
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,972
Pretty tough crowd
you're runnin' with here.

57
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:17,041
Got a little nervous
comin' in.

58
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:19,911
How you doin', sir?

59
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,614
Don't worry, all right.
I come here often.

60
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,217
[coins clinking]

61
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:31,122
Whoo. Nice shootin', Radar.

62
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,858
Thank you. This is
actually kind of like, uh...

63
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:36,661
Kind of like practice
for my future

64
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:37,829
in law enforcement.

65
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:41,833
APD, FBI,
maybe Secret Service.

66
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:44,502
[Watson] What the hell
would you wanna do that for?

67
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:49,907
'Cause I believe
in protecting people, sir.

68
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:55,613
I study the penal code
every night.

69
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:59,017
Sounds like a humdinger
of a night.

70
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:02,787
- Yes!
- Oh.

71
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:06,358
Yeah, it's not bad.
You got some beginner's luck.

72
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,992
Yeah, what's wrong with 9,700?

73
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:10,795
Eh, nothing's wrong with it
for a first time.

74
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:14,098
First time?
All right, come on, let's go.

75
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:16,934
Oh. They only give me, like,
30 minutes for lunch.

76
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,504
I gotta head back in a minute.

77
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,837
Shut up.

78
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,606
You can say you're with me.

79
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:24,243
Let's get it on.

80
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:26,577
- Oh, shoot. All right.
- [video game beeping]

81
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:28,180
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

82
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:30,182
Let's see what you got,
hotshot.

83
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,851
Yeah, I mean business, too.

84
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,087
- [Watson] Yeah?
- You ever do it with one hand?

85
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,758
Mr. Bryant?

86
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:42,494
Oh, Jesus Christ.

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,861
Sorry.

88
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:46,398
I'm a little busy.
Not a good time, so...

89
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:47,665
- Yeah...
- Talk later?

90
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:48,966
I know you're busy.

91
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,335
I just wanted to...
[clears throat]

92
00:04:50,402 --> 00:04:51,836
- [exhales]
- ...come by to let you know,

93
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:53,439
I'm not gonna be
workin' here anymore.

94
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:55,507
Came to say bye.

95
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:58,643
Got a new job doin' security.

96
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,845
- Okay.
- So, that starts tomorrow.

97
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,114
All right.
Hey, good to see you.

98
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:08,953
I wanted to give you something
before I leave.

99
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:12,391
Just to say thank you.

100
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,925
Hey, okay. Uh...

101
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,827
[clears throat] Thank you.

102
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:22,066
I noticed
you were runnin' low.

103
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:25,736
All right.

104
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:28,039
Hey, come here.

105
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,976
- What?
- You got enough money?

106
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:35,146
Yeah, I guess so.
Why do you... Why do you ask?

107
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:37,182
This comes
with a quid pro quo.

108
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:38,484
You know what that is?

109
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,987
Yes, sir. Quid pro quo
is Latin. "This for that."

110
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:45,257
That's right. Well, this comes
with a quid pro quo.

111
00:05:45,324 --> 00:05:47,426
Fair exchange.
So, here's the deal.

112
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:48,659
When you get your badge

113
00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:50,828
and I can see
that day's comin',

114
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:52,663
don't become an asshole.

115
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:54,899
You got me?

116
00:05:57,101 --> 00:05:59,070
No, sir, I won't
become an asshole.

117
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:00,838
A little power
can turn a person

118
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,640
into a monster, Richard.

119
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:05,210
Don't do that.

120
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,944
Do you understand?

121
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,215
Yeah. Um...

122
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,684
Yeah, I'm gonna
get that back to you

123
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,753
the first paycheck I get, sir.

124
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,890
I'm gonna pay you back

125
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:20,925
[chuckles] with interest.

126
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:23,127
Okay. You do that.

127
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:27,665
[pen scratching on paper]

128
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,169
Thank you, Mr. Bryant.

129
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:35,440
[door opens]

130
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:38,109
[door closes]

131
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,919
[Indistinct chatter]

132
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:53,157
[boys laughing loudly]

133
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:56,295
[boy 1] She said
that she played soccer.

134
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,262
So I was like,

135
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,896
"You wanna see me, what,
balance

136
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:00,698
- a frickin' beer on my foot?"
- [bottle shatters]

137
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:02,166
[boy 2] God, you dumbass.

138
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:05,069
[boy 1] I got flustered.
Get the door.

139
00:07:05,803 --> 00:07:07,472
[Richard] Wait.

140
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:08,739
Nice try, hotshot.

141
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:09,907
It's that rent-a-cop.

142
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:11,943
[boy 1] Shit.

143
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,111
[whispering] Open the door.
Open the door.

144
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:17,982
Yes, officer?

145
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:22,119
I heard
a little noise complaint.

146
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:23,455
Thought I'd come
take a look around.

147
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:26,023
You're gonna need
a search warrant first.

148
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,392
Son, you're gonna have to
take your hands off me.

149
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,026
I'm just takin'
a little look-see.

150
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:30,828
Well, you're not even
a real cop, first of all,

151
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:32,063
and you're not allowed

152
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:34,165
to search a room
without a warrant.

153
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,701
- Boy!
- We pay rent. We pay rent.

154
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:36,867
It's like we live here, man.

155
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,370
Boy, this is my job.

156
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,372
I'm gonna have to have you
let me do my job, Curlicue.

157
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,707
And this is our room.

158
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:43,408
Yeah.

159
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:44,842
Are you aware of the notion

160
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,645
of unlawful search
and seizure?

161
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:48,813
Asshole, you're not supposed
to just walk in here.

162
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,915
Keep pushin' me.
Keep testin' me.

163
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,217
See if you like
where it gets you.

164
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:53,285
Yeah?

165
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,754
You all right?

166
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,959
What did I say
freshman orientation week?

167
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:04,962
I said,
"No drinkin' on my campus."

168
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:06,864
I don't know why
no one called my attention

169
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:08,200
to your file before.

170
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,736
I mean, all these complaints
about you.

171
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,903
Physically assaulting
a student.

172
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,941
And have you really been
pulling people over

173
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:18,610
on the highway?

174
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:21,413
Um... Yes, sir, I have.

175
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,417
I figured that if you do
the drunk tests on the road,

176
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,519
trouble never gets
to the campus.

177
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:30,489
We don't have any jurisdiction
on the highway.

178
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:33,157
And I realize that,

179
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:35,993
but I believe
in law and order, sir.

180
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,095
You can't have a country
without it.

181
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:39,498
Hmm. And you were dismissed

182
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:42,066
from the Habersham County
Sheriff's Office.

183
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:44,835
"I don't want
any Mickey-Mousin'

184
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:47,004
on these grounds."

185
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:48,873
Isn't that what you said?

186
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,442
When did I say that?

187
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,810
You said it at Founders' Day
last year, I believe.

188
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:54,212
You were by the punch bowl.

189
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,181
I walked up to you,
and you said to me...

190
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:57,249
Uh, uh...

191
00:08:57,316 --> 00:08:58,849
Well, I had interrupted you.

192
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,851
I apologized,
I introduced myself,

193
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,254
and I said I was
gonna be the greatest

194
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:05,056
campus security guard
you ever had.

195
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:07,058
And you said, "That's good."

196
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:09,428
"I don't want
any Mickey-Mousin'

197
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:10,861
on this campus."

198
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:18,002
I think I might've
even wrote it down.

199
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:20,004
I write down most things.

200
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,774
I keep the important ones.

201
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,443
And I believe...
Oh, yes, sir.

202
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:27,878
"I don't want
any Mickey-Mousin'

203
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,548
on these grounds."

204
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:32,917
Those are your words, sir.

205
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:35,019
So, I took it seriously,

206
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,921
and now,
my question for you is,

207
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:39,558
what about these kids
in the dormitory,

208
00:09:39,624 --> 00:09:41,259
drinkin' and all that?

209
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:44,296
What you gonna do about that?
We're just gonna let it slide?

210
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,599
Do you wanna resign,

211
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,835
or would it be better
if I fired you?

212
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:51,436
[gunshot]

213
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,971
So, I'm goin'
into this guy's office

214
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:56,641
and I think that
he's bringing me in there,

215
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,811
'cause he's gonna, you know,
give me some commendation

216
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,413
or a promotion or something.

217
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,516
Come to find out he brought me
in there to fire me.

218
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,150
Can you believe that?

219
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:08,487
Well, it was a shit job,
anyway.

220
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:10,522
Hasslin' college brats.

221
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,557
Besides, there's gonna be
so much security work

222
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:14,292
the next couple months,
you're set.

223
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:16,228
Yeah, well,
I worked hard at that job.

224
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:17,829
Those kids
were just runnin' wild.

225
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:20,030
Olympics are coming, brother.

226
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:22,032
You can police
the whole damn world.

227
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,870

228
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:27,138

at Centennial Park.

00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:28,774
- Oh.
- Something finally happens

230
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,174
in this stupid city

231
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,510
and I get a fucking
Kenny Rogers concert.

232
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:32,977
It could be worse.
Could be equestrian.

233
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:34,246
I'm getting my tits done.

234
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:35,580
I don't see how
that applies here.

235
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,848
This time next year,
we're all gonna be

236
00:10:36,914 --> 00:10:38,850
scrambling for jobs on TV.

237
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,485
What do you think, D cup?

238
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:43,555
Well, I'd miss you, Kathy,
but, I don't think they would.

You wanna get a drink?

244
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,568
I'd just slow you down.

245
00:10:57,803 --> 00:10:59,337
[Kathy] Suit yourself.

246
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:04,609
Yeah, if you think
that's the best thing.

247
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:07,746
Great.

248
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:09,079

Okay.

258

to answer the phones.

No, I'll go.

I might not move out

until after you've had
your surgery.

278
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:26,858
You might need me
for something.

279
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:28,627
- What do you think?
- Oh...

280
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:29,761
You go on now.

No heavy foot. Yes, ma'am.

286

And why is that?

287
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:43,241
Because you'll kill me
if the insurance goes up?

288
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:44,843
That's right.
I'd have to kill you.

289
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,177
You'd have to kill me.

00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,328
I got another weird one.

526
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:40,831
[Bill] Well, it ain't theirs,
Richard.

527
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:42,334
I don't like this.

528
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,737
We got ourselves
a suspicious package.

529
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:48,440
We better call it in.

530
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:51,210
Probably just somebody run off
drunk and forgot they left it.

531
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:53,844
I still think
we ought to call it in.

532
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:55,380
Just take it
to lost and found, Richard.

533
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:57,081
Shouldn't we unzip it,
and see what's inside first?

534
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:59,184
No, no, you don't
wanna touch that.

535
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:02,153
You gotta follow protocol.

536
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:05,290
Son of a bitch had to get left
under your bench, didn't it?

537
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:07,725
We need assistance
on an unclaimed bag...

538
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,160
A suspicious package.

539
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:12,029
A suspicious package
over at section four.

540
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:14,633
We ought to set up
some kind of a perimeter, too.

541
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,800
- Just back away.
- [Will] Perimeter?

542
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:17,202
Richard, you crazy?

543
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:20,838
You know what?
I would rather be crazy

544
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,341
than wrong right now.

545
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:25,943
Shit, Richard.
It's just full of beer.

We're gonna have to
get you outta here.

551
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:38,823
What kinda situation?

552
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:40,459
Well, we're lookin'
at a suspicious package

553

in front of the tower.

554
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:43,828
Law enforcement is aware
and they're on the scene.

555
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:46,732
Well, if the cops tell us
we gotta go, we'll go.

556
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:47,999
I mean, the band's
in the middle of a set.

557
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:49,501
We can't just shut down.

558
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,135
Yeah, you know what,
if I have to come back here,

559

there's gonna be no questions
and no hesitation.

Hey, guys.

561
00:24:58,042 --> 00:25:00,111
We got a bomb scare
in front of the tower.

562
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:01,480
You should be aware of that.

563
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,448
We get bomb threats
all the time in DC.

564
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:04,750
They're never anything.

565
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:06,518
Cool for you. I'm outta here.

566
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:10,555

Local cop discovered yesterday

569
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:17,529
he's actually second cousins
with a Polish gymnast.

570
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:19,864
Is that a story?

571
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,668
Doesn't get me hard.

Aw, thanks.

Do you have a lighter?

576
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:37,081
You know I don't smoke.

577
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:39,884
All right, I'm gonna go
find a lighter. I'll be back.

I made them aware
of everything.

584
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:54,999
We're not evacuating just yet.

585
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:57,602
Listen, you know
this is a false alarm.

586

Help's on the way. Don't move.

700
00:31:32,604 --> 00:31:34,806
[man] Can we get some medical
over here, please?

701
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:38,743
[groaning]

702
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:41,279
Move them back!

703
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:44,282
There could be
a second device!

704
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:45,984
Let's go. Keep it movin'!
Let's go. Keep it movin'!

705
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:47,252
Let's go. Keep it movin'!

706
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:49,587
[officer] Right now.

707
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:51,623
Several people down.
We need assistance.

708
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,192
- We need it right now!
- [sirens blaring]

709
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:55,427
[Tom] Keep moving.

710
00:31:55,493 --> 00:31:57,629
Follow these arrows.
Keep moving.

711
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:02,333
[girl] Mom?

712
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:04,936
[clamoring continues]

713
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:09,207
[officer] A Team,
there was an explosion.

714
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:10,942
Send as many ambulances
as you have.

715
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:12,644
Hang on. I'm gonna need help.

716
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,655
This is homicide. It's ours.

717
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:25,957
This park is state property.
That makes it ours.

718
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:28,359
You guys can both get the fuck
out of here. This is ATF.

719
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:30,295
Actually, you can
all shut the fuck up,

720
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:31,529
'cause this is
a federal crime.

721
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:32,764
That means
it's our jurisdiction.

722
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,499
The Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

723
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:35,767
So, if you wanna help,

724
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,669
get these injured people
taken care of

725
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:40,839
and keep the perimeter secure.
Help us find out who did this.

726

[indistinct

727
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:49,547
Hey, Mama, I guess I got
your message machine.

728
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:53,718
Uh, it's Richard.
I'm down here.

729
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:57,288
A bomb went off down here,
but I'm okay.

730
00:32:57,355 --> 00:33:02,393
I just called to say when you
get up, just turn on the TV.

731
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:04,496
I love you.

- Hey.
- Hi.

735
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:29,554
Dear God...

736
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:32,123
whoever did this,

737
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:35,960
please let us find him
before anybody else does.

738
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:38,797
And please, whoever he is,

739
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:41,132
let him be
fucking interesting.

740
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,600
Amen.

[man] Are you Jewell?

744
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:03,655
Uh, yes... Yes, sir.

745
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:05,924
I'm Tim Barker,
AT&T Media Relations.

746
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,991
Did I hear this right?

747
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,294
You're the one
who discovered the bomb?

748
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,594
Yes, sir, I did.

749
00:34:09,661 --> 00:34:11,297
That makes you a hero,
you know that?

750
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:12,931
I was just doin' my job, sir.

751
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:14,465
That's a nice thing to say,
Richard,

752
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:15,867
but, uh,
we're getting requests

753
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,402
from a lot of people
who wanna talk to you.

754
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:18,937
Would that be okay?

755
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:21,639
CNN, Katie Couric,
those types.

756
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:23,309
Your superior gave the okay.

757
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:24,909
I gotta tell ya,

758
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,444
there were a whole bunch
of folks clearing people out.

759
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:28,746
Police personnel, medics.
It wasn't just me.

760
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:30,182
You're the one
who spotted the package.

761
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:32,617
You're the one people wanna
hear from, okay?

762
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:34,586
Can we get you something
to drink, take care of you?

763
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:37,121
[sighs] I could use
a cup of coffee, if they're

764
00:34:37,189 --> 00:34:39,591
- gonna make me speak on TV.
- Sure. Absolutely.

765
00:34:41,526 --> 00:34:42,961
<i>With us now is Richard Jewell,</i>

766
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:45,029
<i>the security guard
who first spotted</i>

767
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,998
<i>that knapsack
that contained the bomb,</i>

768
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,800
<i>and began clearing people away
before it exploded.</i>

769
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:50,668
- <i>Richard Jewell, welcome.</i>
- [Richard] <i>Thank you.</i>

770
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,271
<i>A lot of people
are calling you a hero.</i>

771
00:34:52,338 --> 00:34:53,438
<i>Do you feel like one?</i>

772
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:55,506
<i>No, ma'am. I feel like, uh...</i>

773
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:57,775
<i>I was a person
that did the job</i>

774
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:59,311
<i>that I was supposed to do.</i>

775
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,846
<i>I was in the right place
at the right time</i>

776
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:04,682
<i>and used my training
in the way I was taught.</i>

777
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:05,950
<i>The real heroes are</i>

778
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:08,753
<i>the paramedics
and the firemen,</i>

779
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,555
<i>and all the agents
that placed themselves</i>

780
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:13,825
<i>between, you know,
the bomb and the people</i>

781
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:15,693
<i>that were refusing to move,</i>

782
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,364
<i>because they took most
of the shrapnel themselves.</i>

783
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:20,164
- Good for you, Radar.
- [Katie] <i>You played a big role.</i>

784
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:21,466
<i>You were in the right place
at the right time</i>

785
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,235
<i>and you did the right thing.</i>

786
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:24,802
[Richard] <i>Thank you very much.
I really appreciate that.</i>

787
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:26,537
[Katie] <i>Thanks so much
for coming in.</i>

788
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:28,374
[Richard] <i>Thank you for
havin' me. I appreciate it.</i>

789
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:30,209
<i>And we'll be back with more
from Atlanta right after this.</i>

790
00:35:30,276 --> 00:35:31,609
My boy.

791
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:34,612
[sighs]

792
00:35:35,314 --> 00:35:36,581
[officer] Find it.

793
00:35:37,548 --> 00:35:39,584
That's it. Find it.

794
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,019
[dog sniffing]

795
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:46,624
Right here. We got one.

796

[indistinct chatter]

797
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:51,829
[TIm] How'd you feel
about that one, Richard?

798
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:54,699
[Richard] I think it went well.

799
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:57,669
Everybody was really nice.
Made me feel okay about it.

800
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:59,671
- Yeah. You were great.
- Good job, Richard.

801
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:00,838
Hey, thank you.

802
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:02,408
Hey, I had a question
for y'all.

803
00:36:02,473 --> 00:36:05,344
I worked with some guys
who got injured last night.

804
00:36:05,411 --> 00:36:07,478
Um... Green, Silver, Miller.

805
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:09,147
You know if they made it out
all right?

806
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:12,850
Yeah. Word is all the cops are
gonna make a full recovery.

807
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:14,452
That's great.
Thank you very much.

808
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,853
[female officer] Thank you.

809
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,256
Richard, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

810
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:19,023
This is Mr. Brenner
from Bernstein and Crane.

811
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,792
You know the company,
they publish books.

812
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:22,627
Uh, nice to meet you, sir.

813
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:24,495
Hello, Richard.
Pleasure to meet you.

814
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:26,597
I would like to talk to you
about your story.

815
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:28,267
Are you free?

816
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:29,667
[stammers]

817
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,703
- Am I free? Can I talk to him?
- Sure, sure.

818
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,705
All right.
Let's get a cup of coffee.

819
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:35,441
Better yet,
let's get somethin' to eat.

820
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:37,409
Uh, you're not gonna hear
a complaint

821
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:39,178
- out of me for that.
- [laughs]

822
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:40,245
Let's get you something good.

823
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,115
No, no, no.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

824
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,285
[Richard sighs]

825
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:47,485
Richard.

826
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:49,221
Oh, my Lord.

827
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:50,788
You're everywhere.

828
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:53,725
I mean, the phone has just
been ringing off the hook.

829
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,027
[scoffs] I need a secretary.

830
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:58,496
Yeah, I think I might need
a secretary, too.

831
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,466
Some guy from New York

832
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:02,600
just asked me if I wanna
write a book.

833
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,436
You don't mean it.

834
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:06,205
No, I'm not kidding you.

835
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:08,873
They tell me, apparently...

836
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,974
Oh, Lord.

837
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,609
Apparently, they got somebody

838
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,845
who they think up
all the stuff in the book,

839
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:15,980
they type it out
and then they just ask you

840
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:18,049
"yes or no," "true or false,"
"did it happen?"

841
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:19,184
Then they pay you.

842
00:37:19,251 --> 00:37:20,518
You do that for money.

843
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:22,120
Oh, my God,
you're a rock star.

844
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:25,523
Tom Brokaw was
even talking about you.

845
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,924
[stammers]

846
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:28,659
I can't even think right now.

847
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:31,896
Are you all right?
You've been up for so long.

848
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:33,164
Oh, my God,
it was so horrible.

849
00:37:33,232 --> 00:37:35,066
Mama, I'm sorry.
I didn't even hug you.

850
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:38,002
- It was so awful.
- I know, I was there.

851
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,138
Oh, my God.

852
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:42,508
Be thankful
that you weren't there.

853
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:43,775
You could have been there.

854
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:45,743
- I know.
- I couldn't have handled that.

855
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,280
You were there two nights ago
for Kenny Rogers.

856
00:37:48,347 --> 00:37:49,914
Can you imagine
if you were there last night?

857
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:51,483
I know. Sit down, sit down.

858
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:54,585
You must be really hungry.
I'm gonna give you some food.

859
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:56,654
[Richard] Oh, my goodness.

860
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:59,123
Oh, Mama, I'm telling you
what, it was...

861
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:03,728
It was complete chaos, Mama.

862
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:06,597
And to think
I could've called in sick.

863
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:08,766
Think about how
I was feeling yesterday.

864
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:11,135
- I know.
- I could've called in sick.

865
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:12,937
I know.

866
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,605
- Then what?
- Oh, my Lord.

867
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:17,376
- [knock on door]
- [Bruce] Shaw.

868
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:18,910
- No, I gotta go.
- Doing okay?

869
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,513
No.

870
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:23,382
That bomb went off
on my watch.

871
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:25,149
That's my fucking park.

872
00:38:25,217 --> 00:38:28,619
We didn't have enough
eyeballs there. That's on us.

873
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:31,622
Let's just catch
the son of a bitch, yeah?

874
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,225
Yeah.

875
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:35,294
I need you to get out
to Habersham County.

876
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,028
Background on a former
sheriff's deputy.

877
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,298
Might have some connection
to the bombing.

878
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:40,365
Who is it?

879
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:42,834
The security guard.

880
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:56,448
[man] Hey, Richard!

881
00:38:56,515 --> 00:38:58,383
[camera shutters clicking]

882
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:02,787
Hey, way to go, man.

883
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:04,622
You made us all real proud.

884
00:39:06,325 --> 00:39:07,392
Thank you.

885
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,334
Dr. Cleere, we wanna thank you
for contacting the FBI

886
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,304
regarding your suspicions
about Richard Jewell.

887
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:20,738
I wanna be clear,

888
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:22,807
I haven't accused him
of anything.

889
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:24,376
We completely understand.

890
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:26,211
I just...

891
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:30,549
I see the attention
he's getting.

892
00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:33,318
It's the kind of attention
he was always seeking here.

893
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:36,355
Harassing students, pulling
people over on the highway.

894
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:38,323
Just crazy behavior.

895
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,459
And I decided
if my fears were correct,

896
00:39:40,526 --> 00:39:43,961
if he actually wasn't the hero
they're making him out to be,

897
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:45,930
and I had information
pertinent to the fact

898
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,065
which I failed
to bring to light...

899
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:51,403
it could jeopardize lives.

900
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,105
Well, Dr. Cleere, you did
the right thing in calling us.

901
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,775
We will, rest assured,
follow up on this.

902
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,076
Do you mind if we take
this folder with us?

903
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:00,312
Please.

904
00:40:00,379 --> 00:40:02,914
We'll make a copy
and get you the original back.

905
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,618
Why is the goddamn ACOG
reopening that park?

906
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:08,220
We don't have shit!

907
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:12,990
Okay, I wanna hear
more about Jewell.

908
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:14,158
Patrick?

909
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:18,162
Well, when I look at Jewell...

910
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:22,401
I think about the bomb scare
at the L.A. Olympics in '84.

911
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,536
A bag left on a bus
by the same cop

912
00:40:24,603 --> 00:40:25,803
who then discovered it.

913
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,307
And the fires in Idaho
this summer,

914
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:29,974
started by a firefighter

915
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,544
who wanted the credit
for putting them out.

916
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:35,247
A profile emerges here.

917
00:40:35,314 --> 00:40:36,747
The false hero.

918
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:38,783
In interviews,

919
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:40,319
Jewell's account
of the bombing seems vague

920
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:43,087
and he looks uncomfortable
discussing the victims.

921
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:46,090
I also found
that his mentioning on TV

922
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:49,194
that he wanted to get back
into law enforcement a bit

923
00:40:49,261 --> 00:40:50,696
inappropriate.

924
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:52,264
There's a lot here
that's troubling.

925
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:54,832
And everything that Agent Shaw
has learned about him,

926
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,767
syncs up with this profile.

927
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:01,506
You agree with that, Tom?

928
00:41:01,573 --> 00:41:03,275
Yes, sir, I do.

929
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:09,381
Let's put eyes on him.

930
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:15,621
- [Nadya] Watson?
- Yeah?

931
00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:17,489
- Watson?
- Yeah.

932
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:18,990
You have a call on line one.

933
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:20,891
Is it Bill Gates
randomly wondering

934
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,628
if I need a million dollars?

935
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:23,794
If so, that's an affirmative.

936
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:25,230
It's Richard Jewell.

937
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:29,301
"Richard Jewell"
Richard Jewell?

938
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:31,869
"Richard Jewell"
Richard Jewell, line one.

939
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:37,709
- Hello?
- Mr. Bryant.

940
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:40,245
Hey, uh,
I'm sorry to bother you.

941
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:43,548
I just got your number
from Information.

942
00:41:43,615 --> 00:41:45,217
I hope you remember me.

943
00:41:45,284 --> 00:41:48,953
Radar, you can call me Watson.
You're a national hero now.

944
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,456
<i>I'm glad you called.
We're running out of Snickers.</i>

945
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:52,658
Thank you, sir.

946
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:54,726
How are you?
How's your family?

947
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:57,262
<i>We're all fine, yeah.</i>

948
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:59,897
<i>I see you've moved up
from video games.</i>

949
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:03,702
Yep, I didn't mean to,
but I guess I did.

950
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:05,936
Good job.
That's a prideful thing.

951
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,506
What can I do you for?

952
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:09,040
<i>Oh, sir, I was calling you</i>

953
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:10,875
because I wanted to know,

954
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:13,044
have you ever done
a book deal?

955
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,380
[stammers] Why?

956
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:18,283
With this whole bomb thing,
I got these New York guys

957
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,117
who are asking me
to write a book

958
00:42:20,185 --> 00:42:22,521
and I don't really know
anything about that,

959
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:23,888
so I thought
maybe I could call you,

960
00:42:23,954 --> 00:42:25,290
you might be able to help me.

961
00:42:25,357 --> 00:42:27,559
<i>Sure. Sounds
a little far-fetched,</i>

962
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:32,464
but contracts are contracts,
but yeah, we could talk.

963
00:42:32,531 --> 00:42:33,898
So, are you not

964
00:42:33,964 --> 00:42:35,600
the U.S. Small Business
Admin anymore?

965
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,034
'Cause I tried there first.

966
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,704
<i>No, I moved on.</i>

967
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,904
Oh. How come?

968
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,139
<i>Lifestyle decision.</i>

969
00:42:42,207 --> 00:42:44,476
What's your phone number?

970
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:47,479
- My phone number is 404...
- 404...

971
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:49,781
- <i>194...</i>
- 194...

972
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:52,149
- <i>8188.</i>
- 8188.

973
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:54,820
All right, well,
you just don't sign anything

974
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:57,522
until I see it first.
We'll start there.

975
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:59,123
Yes, sir.

976
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:02,461
Yeah, I won't put a pen
to the page. I'll wait on it.

977
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,397
Hey, and thank you, sir.
Thank you for your time.

978
00:43:05,464 --> 00:43:06,531
<i>You got it.</i>

979
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:07,766
All right, bye.

980
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,100
- Stay in touch.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

981
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:10,935
- Okay.
- <i>Bye.</i>

982
00:43:15,841 --> 00:43:17,174
No, no.

983
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:20,111
Don't get too excited.

984
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,848
- No.
- Yes.

985
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:25,883
No. Simmer down there,
hot sauce.

986
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:30,087
[Bobi] Well, Bill Miller.

987
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:32,758
It's nice to see you.
It's been a while.

988
00:43:32,824 --> 00:43:34,459
It's nice to see you, Bobi.

989
00:43:34,526 --> 00:43:35,627
Where's the hero?

990
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:38,263
Oh, he's in here. Come on in.

991
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,035
[Bill] What kind of charge
you figure it was?

992
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:46,371
[Richard] Hmm...

993
00:43:47,873 --> 00:43:50,675
I'm not sure what kinda
explosive the guy used.

994
00:43:50,742 --> 00:43:55,180
It could have been
black powder, match heads,

995
00:43:55,247 --> 00:43:58,583
maybe some kinda chlorate
packed with nails.

996
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,918
You know, the funny thing is

997
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:04,155
the package was supposed
to blow out, right?

998
00:44:04,222 --> 00:44:07,726
So, when those drunks,
those kids knocked it over,

999
00:44:07,793 --> 00:44:09,494
they saved a bunch of lives.

1000
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:11,430
Because it was supposed
to blow out

1001
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:14,366
into a crowd
for maximum casualties.

1002
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:17,302
But when they knocked it
on its back, it blew upward.

1003
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:19,937
Most of the ordnance
going up into the sky.

1004
00:44:20,672 --> 00:44:23,107
It blew up, so...

1005
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:24,643
All in all,
what you're looking at

1006
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:25,777
is some kind of battery

1007
00:44:25,844 --> 00:44:27,846
and some kind of
timing device,

1008
00:44:27,913 --> 00:44:29,347
like a simple clock.

1009
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:32,049
Maybe a wristwatch
like I'm wearing.

1010
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:34,686
Depends how high-tech
the guy got.

1011
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:35,953
Some of these guys,

1012
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,489
especially if they're
ex-military,

1013
00:44:37,556 --> 00:44:40,859
or they're some kind of whiz
outta some university,

1014
00:44:40,926 --> 00:44:42,327
they're gonna use
a combination

1015
00:44:42,394 --> 00:44:44,061
of different bomb tactics.

1016
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:46,932
Other people are following it
like a recipe.

1017
00:44:46,997 --> 00:44:48,266
They're probably

1018
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:50,000
- losing a finger to it.
- [Bill] Yeah.

1019
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:52,871
But depends on who
you're talking about

1020
00:44:52,938 --> 00:44:54,739
and who's making the bomb.

1021
00:44:54,806 --> 00:44:56,006
Well... [sighs]

1022
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:57,476
I like getting your opinion
on it,

1023
00:44:57,542 --> 00:44:59,911
and I'm sure
you've studied it quite a bit.

1024
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,012
Who knows? I mean...

1025
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,849
That's the thing, too,
about these bombers.

1026
00:45:03,915 --> 00:45:05,650
It could have been you or me.

1027
00:45:05,717 --> 00:45:09,119
These guys, some of them,
look like regular people.

1028
00:45:09,187 --> 00:45:10,755
Lot of them do.

1029
00:45:14,426 --> 00:45:15,660
Yeah.

1030
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:33,077
[slow dance music playing
on speakers]

1031
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:34,679
[indistinct chatter]

1032
00:45:37,282 --> 00:45:38,483
[Kathy sighs]

1033
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,286
Must be a lot of pressure
on you guys.

1034
00:45:42,754 --> 00:45:44,256
No more so than usual.

1035
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:47,459
Sure, just another...
Thank you.

1036
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:50,262
Just your average
deadly bombing

1037
00:45:50,328 --> 00:45:51,830
on U.S. soil
during the Olympics.

1038
00:45:51,897 --> 00:45:54,432
No big deal.

1039
00:45:54,499 --> 00:45:56,935
I don't know, you guys must be
feeling the heat, too, huh?

1040
00:45:57,002 --> 00:45:58,303
[Kathy] Mmm-hmm.

1041
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,205
CNN is going wall-to-wall
with this.

1042
00:46:00,272 --> 00:46:02,072
Is that why we get this...

1043
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:04,108
- outfit?
- [chuckles]

1044
00:46:05,243 --> 00:46:06,811
So, then give me something
I can print.

1045
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:11,081
Kathy, you know
I can't do that.

1046
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:13,318
That's all right.
I already know

1047
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:14,486
the Bureau's looking
into somebody.

1048
00:46:14,553 --> 00:46:16,488
Yeah, what makes
you think that?

1049
00:46:17,389 --> 00:46:18,256
Friends.

1050
00:46:18,323 --> 00:46:19,624
- Friends?
- Sources.

1051
00:46:19,691 --> 00:46:20,725
Sources?

1052
00:46:22,661 --> 00:46:24,094
Who is it?

1053
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,299
Well, Kathy, if you couldn't
fuck it out of them,

1054
00:46:27,365 --> 00:46:30,468
what makes you think
you're gonna fuck it outta me?

1055
00:46:30,535 --> 00:46:32,771
- [scoffing]
- Uh-huh.

1056
00:46:34,005 --> 00:46:35,307
You know what
bothers me, Kathy,

1057
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:37,074
is that people don't
understand how much work

1058
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:38,276
goes into making
a case like this.

1059
00:46:38,343 --> 00:46:40,679
It's effort 24/7.

1060
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,681
[Kathy] Hmm.

1061
00:46:42,747 --> 00:46:44,182
You're right.

1062
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:49,788
Why don't you educate me?

1063
00:46:51,723 --> 00:46:54,492
I will not have this
screwed up.

1064
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:55,894
That was a massacre out there.

1065
00:46:55,961 --> 00:46:57,495
It's a miracle
more people weren't killed.

1066
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:59,264
I would never go
to print without

1067
00:46:59,331 --> 00:47:01,633
independent corroboration
from a second source.

1068
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,135
And that would put us
in a very different zone.

1069
00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:08,673
As you know.

1070
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,744
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1071
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:15,880
What kind of zone?

1072
00:47:15,947 --> 00:47:17,515
You have to find out.

1073
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:21,620
[sighs]

1074
00:47:30,962 --> 00:47:34,499
[softly] We're looking at
the security guard, Jewell.

1075
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:39,537
- No shit?
- No shit.

1076
00:47:41,006 --> 00:47:42,807
You always look at the guy
who found the bomb just like

1077
00:47:42,874 --> 00:47:44,643
you always look at the guy
who found the body.

1078
00:47:44,709 --> 00:47:48,346
But this guy,
he's got a bad past.

1079
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:52,350
Fits the profile
of the hero-bomber to a T.

1080
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:56,621
That fat fuck who lives
with his mother. Of course.

1081
00:47:56,688 --> 00:47:59,791
How did I miss that?
I mean, that is amazing.

1082
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:01,993
Oof.

1083
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,628
You are good.

1084
00:48:03,695 --> 00:48:05,063
You're very good.

1085
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,431
Yeah.

1086
00:48:06,498 --> 00:48:08,333
This kind of puts a clock
on things though.

1087
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,535
You wanna get a room
or just go to my car?

1088
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:15,140
This is happening.

1089
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:16,508
This is happening.

1090
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:19,210
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1091
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:20,645
- [Kathy] Okay.
- Yeah.

1092
00:48:20,712 --> 00:48:22,547
- [indistinct chatter]
- [typewriter clacking]

1093
00:48:27,886 --> 00:48:29,187
Sugar, I need you to do

1094
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:31,089
one of those better
word things you do.

1095
00:48:31,156 --> 00:48:32,891
You mean rewrite you?

1096
00:48:32,957 --> 00:48:34,559
Yeah, you know
I write like a brick,

1097
00:48:34,626 --> 00:48:36,961
and this one is kinda special.

1098
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:38,530
What is it?

1099
00:48:40,198 --> 00:48:42,534
Oh, nothing.
It's just that the, um...

1100
00:48:43,635 --> 00:48:47,105
The FBI is looking
at Richard Jewell

1101
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:48,540
as the bomber.

1102
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:53,078
Do you have time for me now?

1103
00:48:53,144 --> 00:48:54,512
Oh, I got
all the time you need.

1104
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:56,548
- All right, let's work.
- Tell me everything.

1105
00:48:57,315 --> 00:48:58,383
Where you goin'?

1106
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,818
To get my notes.

1107
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:04,222
The security guard
who first alerted

1108
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:05,590
police to the pipe bomb

1109
00:49:05,657 --> 00:49:07,625
that exploded in Centennial
Olympic Park

1110
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:09,728
is the target
of the federal investigation

1111
00:49:09,794 --> 00:49:10,662
into the incident

1112
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:12,430
that resulted in two deaths

1113
00:49:12,497 --> 00:49:14,365
and injured
more than one hundred.

1114
00:49:14,432 --> 00:49:15,633
Richard Jewell, 33,

1115
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,268
a former
law enforcement officer,

1116
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:19,437
fits the profile
of the lone bomber.

1117
00:49:19,504 --> 00:49:20,972
This profile
generally includes

1118
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:23,775
a frustrated white man who
is a former police officer,

1119
00:49:23,842 --> 00:49:26,611
member of the military,
or police wannabe

1120
00:49:26,678 --> 00:49:29,781
who seeks to become a hero.

1121
00:49:29,848 --> 00:49:32,250
Jewell has become a celebrity
in the wake of the bombing,

1122
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:34,152
making appearances on
<i>The Today Show."</i>

1123
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,887
FBI knows you have this?

1124
00:49:35,954 --> 00:49:38,089
Yeah, my guy says
everybody's got it.

1125
00:49:38,156 --> 00:49:39,891
Networks have it.

1126
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:41,193
CNN has it.

1127
00:49:41,259 --> 00:49:43,328
Got a guy at GBI
says the same thing.

1128
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:44,963
Bureau's looking at Jewell.

1129
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:47,298
Then why isn't anyone
reporting it?

1130
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:50,368
Anybody feel like
we're getting worked here?

1131
00:49:51,603 --> 00:49:55,373
God damn, John,
these are our Olympics.

1132
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,708
If we don't lead
on this story,

1133
00:49:56,775 --> 00:49:58,743
what the fuck
are we doing here?

1134
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:04,048
Okay.

1135
00:50:04,115 --> 00:50:06,317
Tear up the afternoon edition,
and replate the front page.

1136
00:50:06,384 --> 00:50:07,685
We're running it.

1137
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:08,953
Thank you.

1138
00:50:10,522 --> 00:50:13,691

Whoo!

[laughing]

1153
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:12,650
Yeah!

1154
00:51:14,886 --> 00:51:17,989
Who the fuck leaked this
investigation to the AJC?

1155
00:51:18,056 --> 00:51:19,657
Huh? Shaw!

1156
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:21,526
- Sir?
- Get Jewell in here.

1157
00:51:21,593 --> 00:51:23,895
Nonconfrontational interview,
today!

1158
00:51:31,469 --> 00:51:32,837
[sighs]

1159
00:51:37,642 --> 00:51:40,545
- [Tom sighs]
- [knock on door]

1160
00:51:40,612 --> 00:51:42,547
- Hello?
- Richard Jewell?

1161
00:51:43,615 --> 00:51:45,516
Yeah. I'm Richard.

1162
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:48,287
Special Agents Dan Bennet,
Tom Shaw, FBI.

1163
00:51:48,354 --> 00:51:49,554
You got a minute?

1164
00:51:49,621 --> 00:51:52,824
Yeah, I got a minute.
Come on in.

1165
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:53,958
[Tom] Thank you.

1166
00:51:55,827 --> 00:51:57,263
Ma'am.

1167
00:51:57,329 --> 00:51:58,696
[Richard] Um...

1168
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:00,765
[stammers]

1169
00:52:00,832 --> 00:52:05,069
Mama, this is
Agent Bennet and Shaw.

1170
00:52:05,136 --> 00:52:06,971
This is my mother, Bobi.

1171
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:09,107
- How do you do?
- Pleasure, ma'am.

1172
00:52:09,173 --> 00:52:10,475
[clears throat] Uh...

1173
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,809
What can I do for y'all?

1174
00:52:11,876 --> 00:52:13,544
Well, the Bureau's
actually putting together

1175
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:14,846
a training video

1176
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:17,081
on how to deal
with suspicious packages,

1177
00:52:17,148 --> 00:52:18,616
and we'd love you
to be a part of it.

1178
00:52:18,683 --> 00:52:20,818
- How's that sound to you?
- [Richard] Uh...

1179
00:52:20,885 --> 00:52:23,154
I would love
to help out with that,

1180
00:52:23,222 --> 00:52:24,390
yeah, absolutely.

1181
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:25,790
You did it, Richard.

1182
00:52:25,857 --> 00:52:27,359
You showed them
what kinda cop you can be.

1183
00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:29,027
Look at this.

1184
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:30,229
[Tom] See, the only thing is
that we're shooting it today.

1185
00:52:30,296 --> 00:52:31,896
So, we'd need you to

1186
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:33,564
follow us to the field office
right now.

1187
00:52:33,631 --> 00:52:35,900
Because time's a little
bit tight. Is that okay?

1188
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,602
You know what?
I would love to,

1189
00:52:37,669 --> 00:52:39,137
but I still gotta work today.

1190
00:52:39,204 --> 00:52:40,339
I got my shift.

1191
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:42,106
Ah, this won't take long,
Richard.

1192
00:52:43,975 --> 00:52:46,544
[chuckles] Yeah,
you know what? Um...

1193
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:47,779
I bet we can make that work.

1194
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,480
I can call in and tell 'em

1195
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:51,183
I'm gonna be
a little bit late.

1196
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,118
I mean, I wanna help you all,
and I'm law enforcement, too.

1197
00:52:54,186 --> 00:52:55,920
- We know that. Yes, indeed.
- We know that.

1198
00:52:55,987 --> 00:52:56,921
[Richard] Yeah.

1199
00:52:56,988 --> 00:52:58,756
So, you're all set
to go then, huh?

1200
00:52:58,823 --> 00:53:00,692
- Yep. Yeah.
- [Tom] Great.

1201
00:53:00,758 --> 00:53:01,993
- Let's do it.
- Lovely to meet you, ma'am.

1202
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,195
Thank you very much.

1203
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:04,430
- [Bobi] Nice to meet you.
- [Dan] Lovely home.

1204
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:05,496
[door opens]

1205
00:53:05,563 --> 00:53:07,299
I don't know what's going on.

1206
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:09,667
I'm so proud of you.

1207
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:11,736
Oh, goodness.

1208
00:53:17,976 --> 00:53:19,711
[female reporter] Mr. Jewell,
why are the FBI here?

1209
00:53:19,777 --> 00:53:22,647
[male reporter] Mr. Jewell,
what have they told you?

1210
00:53:22,714 --> 00:53:24,183
Are they letting you
go back to work?

1211
00:53:24,249 --> 00:53:25,717
Uh, yeah.

1212
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:27,151
They're letting you go
to work? You're good to go?

1213
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:28,287
Yeah.

1214
00:53:28,354 --> 00:53:30,855
Are the FBI investigating you?

1215
00:53:30,922 --> 00:53:34,492
Uh, I imagine
they'll investigate anyone

1216
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,827
who was at the park
that night.

1217
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:37,895
That includes all of you, too.

1218
00:53:37,962 --> 00:53:40,598
[reporter] Have they told you
yet you can't leave town?

1219
00:53:40,665 --> 00:53:42,166
[Richard] No.

1220
00:53:42,234 --> 00:53:43,935
[female reporter] Mr. Jewell,
are you under arrest?

1221
00:53:44,002 --> 00:53:45,570
[male reporter] You're free
to go wherever you like?

1222
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:47,071
You're free to go
wherever you'd like, Richard?

1223
00:53:47,138 --> 00:53:48,606
- Who are you working with?
- What happened out there?

1224
00:53:48,673 --> 00:53:50,141
What do you think
of the appearance that

1225
00:53:50,209 --> 00:53:51,310
people are saying that you are
now the prime suspect?

1226
00:53:51,377 --> 00:53:52,777
What's going on, Richard?

1227
00:53:52,844 --> 00:53:54,313
I'm not a suspect.

1228
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,947
[female reporter] Why are you
talking to the FBI?

1229
00:53:56,014 --> 00:53:58,183
Mr. Jewell, what does
the FBI want with you?

1230
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,718
Can you give us
any more information?

1231
00:54:39,324 --> 00:54:42,294
Sorry, I think I got
some media following me.

1232
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:45,763
No. Those are our guys, bud.
Those are our guys.

1233
00:54:55,374 --> 00:54:57,543
<i>"Richard Jewell, 33,</i>

1234
00:54:57,608 --> 00:54:59,278
<i>a former
law enforcement officer,"</i>

1235
00:54:59,344 --> 00:55:00,745
<i>the story goes on to say,</i>

1236
00:55:00,812 --> 00:55:03,215
<i>"fits the profile
of the lone bomber.</i>

1237
00:55:03,282 --> 00:55:05,317
<i>This profile
generally includes</i>

1238
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:08,686
<i>a frustrated white man who
is a former police officer,</i>

1239
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:11,390
<i>member of the military,
or police wannabe</i>

1240
00:55:11,457 --> 00:55:12,890
<i>who seeks to become a hero.</i>

1241
00:55:12,957 --> 00:55:14,326
<i>The security guard who first</i>

1242
00:55:14,393 --> 00:55:16,395
<i>alerted police
to the pipe bomb...</i>

1243
00:55:16,462 --> 00:55:19,864
<i>that exploded
in Centennial Olympic Park."</i>

1244
00:55:19,931 --> 00:55:23,034
[Tom] So, up until
it obviously went sideways,

1245
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:26,070
everything pretty normal
about that evening, right?

1246
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:29,208
No, it was a regular night
from what I could tell.

1247
00:55:29,274 --> 00:55:31,376
Everyone was having
a great time.

1248
00:55:31,443 --> 00:55:33,744
It was like a celebration.

1249
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:34,979
[Tom] Yeah. No air of...

1250
00:55:35,046 --> 00:55:36,848
Yeah, you were having fun.

1251
00:55:36,914 --> 00:55:38,649
I was having fun.
It was a good time.

1252
00:55:38,716 --> 00:55:41,220
But there was, uh, some guys

1253
00:55:41,286 --> 00:55:42,887
with beer cans
or something like that?

1254
00:55:42,954 --> 00:55:44,423
Guys behind the tower.

1255
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,023
What were they doing there?
They were throwing...

1256
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,025
- Beer bottles.
- Beer bottles. Yeah.

1257
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:50,828
They were horsing around,
fooling.

1258
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:54,165
I broke it up
and I gave 'em a talking-to,

1259
00:55:54,233 --> 00:55:55,200
and they left. Yep.

1260
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:56,934
[Dan] And that was
behind the tower?

1261
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:58,270
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

1262
00:55:58,337 --> 00:55:59,971
So then you came back
around the tower

1263
00:56:00,037 --> 00:56:02,740
and that's where you saw
the package unattended?

1264
00:56:02,807 --> 00:56:04,376
- Yes, sir.
- [Tom] Right.

1265
00:56:04,443 --> 00:56:08,380
[Dan] And did you see anyone
walking away from the bench?

1266
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,149
No, sir. I would've
tailed them if I did.

1267
00:56:11,216 --> 00:56:13,285
Yeah.

1268
00:56:13,352 --> 00:56:16,120
So, you have no idea who might
have put that package there?

1269
00:56:16,188 --> 00:56:17,256
No, sir.

1270
00:56:17,322 --> 00:56:20,992
But whoever did,
I think they ought to fry.

1271
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:23,562
Oh. Yeah. We think so,
too, Richard.

1272
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:25,062
Absolutely.

1273
00:56:26,265 --> 00:56:28,833
So, here's what
we're gonna do.

1274
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,435
We're trying to be
as authentic as possible

1275
00:56:30,502 --> 00:56:34,705
and part of that has to do
with how you treat a suspect.

1276
00:56:34,772 --> 00:56:35,873
All right? So,
what we're gonna do is

1277
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,276
we're gonna pretend

1278
00:56:37,342 --> 00:56:39,378
that we actually brought
you in, in that regard.

1279
00:56:39,444 --> 00:56:40,678
- Right?
- That...

1280
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:41,879
And we read you
your Miranda rights

1281
00:56:41,946 --> 00:56:43,114
and you've agreed
to waive them.

1282
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:44,383
In fact, we have
a form you can sign.

1283
00:56:44,449 --> 00:56:45,651
[Dan] Yeah. Why don't you...?

1284
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:46,918
This'll be good.

1285
00:56:46,984 --> 00:56:48,287
Just so it looks real.

1286
00:56:48,353 --> 00:56:50,589
Yeah. So, you just sign
the bottom there

1287
00:56:50,656 --> 00:56:52,823
and we'll get that on tape

1288
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:56,127
and then we'll continue on
with the interview.

1289
00:56:58,297 --> 00:56:59,730
Okay.

1290
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:01,732
Yeah.

1291
00:57:06,837 --> 00:57:08,240
I'm sorry, Richard,
maybe I wasn't clear.

1292
00:57:08,307 --> 00:57:11,008
You actually have to
physically sign the paper.

1293
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:17,014
- This is a real document.
- [Dan] Well...

1294
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:20,586
Of course. We're going for
authenticity here, Richard.

1295
00:57:20,652 --> 00:57:23,788
It has to be real
for the video.

1296
00:57:25,624 --> 00:57:27,992
I'm sorry, sir. I don't...

1297
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:30,395
I don't think
I would feel comfortable

1298
00:57:30,462 --> 00:57:32,830
signing something like this.

1299
00:57:32,897 --> 00:57:34,333
Richard, we just want...

1300
00:57:34,399 --> 00:57:36,901
You know what? Why don't we
take a quick break?

1301
00:57:36,968 --> 00:57:39,438
- Go ahead and stop the camera.
- Okay.

1302
00:57:39,504 --> 00:57:41,072
Um...

1303
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:43,208
- Yeah. Okay.
- We'll just talk for a second.

1304
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:45,444
- We'll be right back.
- [Dan] Right back.

1305
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:55,187
I was a sheriff deputy.

1306
00:57:55,786 --> 00:57:57,154
Habersham County.

1307
00:58:00,425 --> 00:58:01,727
All right, Richard,

1308
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:03,794
we're gonna pretend like
none of that ever happened.

1309
00:58:03,861 --> 00:58:06,498
Let's get a new tape going.
Okay?

1310
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:07,633
- Uh...
- [tape whirring]

1311
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:10,435
What we're gonna do now...

1312
00:58:10,502 --> 00:58:11,869
There you go. I got it.

1313
00:58:11,936 --> 00:58:13,871
Get her out there
and we'll throw it away.

1314
00:58:13,938 --> 00:58:15,873
What we're gonna do now is

1315
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,676
Agent Bennet's gonna
come back in the room,

1316
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:19,378
he's gonna
reintroduce himself,

1317
00:58:19,444 --> 00:58:21,580
show you his credentials just
like a professional interview

1318
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:22,847
and then we're gonna

1319
00:58:22,913 --> 00:58:23,914
actually read you
your Miranda rights.

1320
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:25,317
Why would he do that?

1321
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:26,917
[Tom] Well, to make it
more authentic, Richard.

1322
00:58:26,984 --> 00:58:28,986
We want this to look
as authentic as possible.

1323
00:58:29,053 --> 00:58:31,256
Come on in, Agent Bennet.

1324
00:58:32,691 --> 00:58:34,593
Mr. Jewell...

1325
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:37,696
Special Agent Dan Bennet, FBI.
You have the right to...

1326
00:58:37,763 --> 00:58:39,364
I'm sorry. I think...
I'm sorry.

1327
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:43,034
I think maybe I should
contact my attorney.

1328
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,536
[Richard clears throat]

1329
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:46,471
Now, why would you
wanna do that, Richard?

1330
00:58:46,538 --> 00:58:48,072
I mean...

1331
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:49,508
You're the hero, right?

1332
00:58:49,574 --> 00:58:51,376
Unless there's something
you wanna tell us.

1333
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:53,445
No. But I just...

1334
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:58,849
think I better call him.

1335
00:58:59,817 --> 00:59:01,420
Okay.

1336
00:59:05,457 --> 00:59:06,558
[sighs deeply]

1337
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,025
Here you go.

1338
00:59:08,826 --> 00:59:10,262
Press nine.

1339
00:59:18,102 --> 00:59:22,207
Yes, hello, I'm calling
Information to get ahold...

1340
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:26,110
The name is Watson Bryant.
He's a lawyer.

1341
00:59:27,346 --> 00:59:30,248
Thank you.
Yeah, connect me.

1342
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:36,421
I'm getting
his message machine.

1343
00:59:36,488 --> 00:59:38,256
So, I'm gonna leave
a message for him.

1344
00:59:38,323 --> 00:59:40,392
[Tom] Go ahead. Leave a message
and that'll be...

1345
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,297
This... [sighs]
This is Watson.

1346
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:47,766
Watson Bryant,
this is Richard Jewell

1347
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:51,102
<i>calling in regards to, um,</i>

1348
00:59:51,168 --> 00:59:53,205
<i>something somewhat serious.</i>

1349
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:54,606
<i>I would like you
to call me back.</i>

1350
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:57,676
<i>I'm at the FBI office
in Atlanta.</i>

1351
00:59:57,743 --> 01:00:00,345
<i>If you could call me back
at your earliest convenience.</i>

1352
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:02,947
- <i>Thank you. Bye.</i>
- [line disconnects]

1353
01:00:03,615 --> 01:00:05,149
[groans]

1354
01:00:10,355 --> 01:00:11,857
You can't leave
your phone off.

1355
01:00:11,922 --> 01:00:13,090
I have to be able
to reach you.

1356
01:00:13,157 --> 01:00:14,426
What's wrong?

1357
01:00:14,493 --> 01:00:17,027
You need more toner?

1358
01:00:17,094 --> 01:00:18,996
- He called three times.
- Who? Who called?

1359
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:20,432
Who? Richard.

1360
01:00:20,499 --> 01:00:22,367
Three times from
the FBI interrogation room.

1361
01:00:22,434 --> 01:00:24,935
All right, all right,
all right, slow down.

1362
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:27,239
Jesus Christ.

1363
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,942
[grunts] Am I the only lawyer
this guy knows?

1364
01:00:32,009 --> 01:00:33,278
Yes.

1365
01:00:36,113 --> 01:00:38,283
The paper says...

1366
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,918
Paper says the Bureau has him
dead to rights.

1367
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,987
Where I come from,

1368
01:00:43,053 --> 01:00:44,322
when the government says
someone's guilty,

1369
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:46,725
it's how you know
they're innocent.

1370
01:00:46,792 --> 01:00:48,959
It's different here?

1371
01:00:49,026 --> 01:00:51,128
I don't know.
Looks pretty bad.

1372
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:54,499
I don't care.

1373
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:58,904
We'll get three or four cases
as juicy as this tomorrow,

1374
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:00,305
and you have
so much else to do.

1375
01:01:00,372 --> 01:01:01,740
All right, all right,
all right.

1376
01:01:01,807 --> 01:01:04,209
Connect me with the field
office, would you, Nadya?

1377
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:06,944
Right away.

1378
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:08,078
Thank you.

1379
01:01:08,145 --> 01:01:10,182
Unless you're too busy.

1380
01:01:11,483 --> 01:01:12,684
Don't you have any work to do?

1381
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:14,553
I have nothing else to do, no.

1382
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:17,189
Yes, this is Watson Bryant,
attorney for Richard Jewell.

1383
01:01:17,255 --> 01:01:19,458
I'd like to speak
to my client, please.

1384
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:21,058
[FBI operator] <i>I'm sorry, sir,</i>

1385
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,227
<i>but we have no one here
by that name.</i>

1386
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:25,430
Yeah, you do, actually.

1387
01:01:25,497 --> 01:01:27,566
Put me on the phone
with my client now.

1388
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:29,701
<i>Please call back later, sir.</i>

1389
01:01:29,768 --> 01:01:31,603
<i>Maybe we'll have
more information.</i>

[line disconnects]

1391
01:01:40,412 --> 01:01:42,614
Dial that number again,
would you?

1392
01:01:50,522 --> 01:01:51,957
Yeah, this is
Watson Bryant again,

1393
01:01:52,022 --> 01:01:53,558
attorney for Richard Jewell.

1394
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,727
My next call is gonna be to
Mike Wallace of <i>60 Minutes</i>

1395
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:58,497
to ask him why the FBI
would deny a citizen

1396
01:01:58,563 --> 01:02:00,565
his constitutional right
to legal counsel.

1397
01:02:00,632 --> 01:02:03,368
Can I have the spelling
of your name, please?

1398
01:02:04,803 --> 01:02:06,505
Got a call for you.

1399
01:02:10,242 --> 01:02:11,843
[Richard] <i>Hello?</i>

1400
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:14,312
Richard, [sighs] it's Watson.
What are you doing in there?

1401
01:02:14,379 --> 01:02:17,249
They said they needed me
for a training film.

1402
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:18,583
No, they don't need you for...

1403
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:19,951
You're a suspect.

1404
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:21,386
Have you read the newspapers?

1405
01:02:21,453 --> 01:02:23,053
<i>Have you signed anything?</i>

1406
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,489
<i>Have you confessed
to anything?</i>

1407
01:02:24,556 --> 01:02:28,193
No, of course not.
I didn't do this.

1408
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,229
All right, listen to me.
Listen to me real carefully.

1409
01:02:31,296 --> 01:02:34,131
Just don't say anything
to anyone.

1410
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:36,201
You understand me?

1411
01:02:36,268 --> 01:02:37,569
<i>Get your ass outta there.</i>

1412
01:02:37,636 --> 01:02:39,771
<i>Let me talk
to the agent in charge.</i>

1413
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:43,375
He wants to talk to you.

1414
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:44,676
[Tom] <i>This is Agent Shaw.</i>

1415
01:02:44,743 --> 01:02:46,511
This interrogation's over.

1416
01:02:46,578 --> 01:02:48,179
Not another word, you hear me?

1417
01:02:48,246 --> 01:02:49,748
He's been cooperating fully.

1418
01:02:49,814 --> 01:02:51,115
<i>Hey, did I stutter?</i>

1419
01:02:51,182 --> 01:02:52,684
<i>No more questions!</i>

1420
01:02:52,751 --> 01:02:55,387
Get his ass outta there,
you hear me?

1421
01:02:55,453 --> 01:02:57,989
Okay. Well, have a nice...

1422
01:02:58,055 --> 01:02:59,424
[line disconnects]

1423
01:02:59,991 --> 01:03:01,826
He hung up on me.

1424
01:03:01,893 --> 01:03:04,763
You have a very loud lawyer.
Congratulations.

01:03:17,609 --> 01:03:18,677
Were you charged?

[clamoring continues]

1429
01:03:22,847 --> 01:03:25,383
Did you do it?
Did you set that bomb?

1430
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:28,520
Richard, what did
the FBI say to you?

1431
01:03:28,587 --> 01:03:30,755
[male reporter] Richard,
what did they say?

1432
01:03:30,822 --> 01:03:32,691
[female reporter] What did
the FBI say to you, Richard?

1433
01:03:34,926 --> 01:03:36,595
[male reporter]
Did the FBI charge you?

1434
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:37,762
[female reporter] Did you set
that bomb, Richard?

1435
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:49,774
What can you tell us
about the FBI interview?

1436
01:03:52,677 --> 01:03:55,513
Richard, what did the FBI
say to you? Just tell us.

1437
01:03:57,616 --> 01:03:58,850
[reporter on TV]
<i>We're having some trouble</i>

- NBC News <i>and Tom Brokaw.</i>
- [Richard panting]

1448
01:04:13,698 --> 01:04:15,934
<i>The speculation
is that the FBI</i>

1449
01:04:16,001 --> 01:04:18,370
<i>is close to "making the case,"
in their language.</i>

1450
01:04:18,436 --> 01:04:20,639
<i>They probably have enough
to arrest him right now,</i>

1451
01:04:20,705 --> 01:04:22,474
<i>probably enough
to prosecute him,</i>

1452
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,576
<i>but you always wanna have
enough to convict him as well.</i>

1453
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:26,211
<i>There are still some holes
in this case.</i>

1454
01:04:26,277 --> 01:04:27,646
Why did Tom Brokaw
say that about you?

1455
01:04:27,712 --> 01:04:29,581
[male reporter]
<i>That was Tom Brokaw</i>

[indistinct chatter]

1461
01:04:51,202 --> 01:04:52,671
- [reporter 1] Hey, who's this?
- [reporter 2] I don't know.

1462
01:04:52,737 --> 01:04:54,272
[reporter 3] I don't know
who this guy is.

1463
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:55,640
Come with me. Let's get him,
let's get him.

1464
01:04:55,707 --> 01:04:58,176
Sir? Sir? Sir?
Who are you, sir?

1465
01:04:58,243 --> 01:04:59,444
Are you Richard's friend?

Who are you here to see?

01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:02,714
Are you a friend of Richard's?

1468
01:05:02,781 --> 01:05:04,215
- Why are you here?
- Who are you?

1469
01:05:04,282 --> 01:05:06,317
[Watson] I'm a friend
of Richard's.

[reporters clamoring]

1471

Can you give us some insight?

1472
01:05:09,587 --> 01:05:10,789
Did you help him
set that bomb?

1473
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:12,891
What's your name?
Tell us anything at all.

1474
01:05:12,957 --> 01:05:14,192
Are you a family member?

1475
01:05:14,259 --> 01:05:16,027
[Watson] I'm a friend
of Richard's.

[Watson] Hey.

1479
01:05:27,072 --> 01:05:29,240
- Hey.
- Shit show out there.

- [clamoring continues]
- [phone ringing]

1481
01:05:30,709 --> 01:05:32,877
You got that $100 you owe me?

Oh, you must be Mom.

1483
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:37,615
How are you?
I'm Watson.

1484
01:05:37,682 --> 01:05:40,485
I'm so sorry
the world has gone insane.

[phone continues ringing]

1486
01:05:42,053 --> 01:05:43,321
Ah, that's annoying.

1487
01:05:43,388 --> 01:05:46,391
Let's get rid of that,
shall we? Uh...

1488
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:48,560
It's kind of like a drill
in your ear.

1489
01:05:48,626 --> 01:05:49,961
For the next little while,

1490
01:05:50,028 --> 01:05:52,530
the only person
you need to talk to is me.

1491

He does not open
his mouth again

1492
01:05:54,866 --> 01:05:56,267
if there's a cop present,

1493
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:59,205
or an FBI agent, or someone
from GBI, or a crossing guard.

1494
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:00,538
Is that clear?

1495
01:06:00,605 --> 01:06:03,341
I was raised
to respect authority, sir.

1496
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:05,477
Son, authority's
what's outside that window

1497
01:06:05,543 --> 01:06:07,812
looking to eat you alive.

1498
01:06:08,947 --> 01:06:10,248
How about a beer?

1499
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:11,816
[Richard clicks tongue] Oh...

1500
01:06:11,883 --> 01:06:14,285
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.
Let me grab you something.

1501
01:06:14,352 --> 01:06:15,987
No, no. Thanks, Radar.

1502
01:06:16,054 --> 01:06:17,355
Yeah.

1503
01:06:17,422 --> 01:06:18,823
I'm gonna need to be alone
with your son.

1504
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:20,192
I hate to be rude,

1505
01:06:20,258 --> 01:06:22,127
but if there's a third party,
there's no privilege.

1506
01:06:22,194 --> 01:06:23,361
Oh.

1507
01:06:23,428 --> 01:06:26,198
Yeah, third party,
then they can

1508
01:06:26,264 --> 01:06:27,932
compel anything we say.

1509
01:06:27,999 --> 01:06:29,000
No.

1510
01:06:29,067 --> 01:06:30,236
Very nice to meet you.

1511
01:06:30,301 --> 01:06:31,770
Sorry to be rude, Bobi.
Thanks.

1512
01:06:35,573 --> 01:06:38,376
You belong to any
extremist groups, Richard?

1513
01:06:38,443 --> 01:06:39,978
No, I hate all that stuff.

1514
01:06:40,044 --> 01:06:42,013
Any anti-government
affiliations or...?

1515
01:06:43,314 --> 01:06:44,949
No.

1516
01:06:45,016 --> 01:06:48,220
Any of your friends affiliated
with any fringe organizations?

1517
01:06:48,286 --> 01:06:50,889
No, no, I do not believe so.

1518
01:06:50,955 --> 01:06:52,524
Religious cults?

1519
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:56,294
Not unless being a Baptist
is a religious cult.

1520
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:57,629
NRA?

1521
01:06:57,695 --> 01:07:00,131
Is the NRA a fringe group?

1522
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:03,368
You ever hung out with any
Ku Klux Klan members?

1523
01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:05,904
If I did, it wouldn't have
been on purpose.

1524
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:09,674
You contacted any other
lawyers about this book deal?

1525
01:07:09,741 --> 01:07:12,377
- No. You're the only one.
- Mmm-hmm.

1526
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:14,779
Richard, this is
a capital crime here.

1527
01:07:15,647 --> 01:07:18,917
This is the death penalty.

1528
01:07:18,983 --> 01:07:21,287
I can help you,
but only if I know the truth.

1529
01:07:21,352 --> 01:07:22,954
Did you do this?

1530
01:07:24,923 --> 01:07:25,924
No.

1531
01:07:27,158 --> 01:07:28,626
Are you asking if I did it?

1532
01:07:28,693 --> 01:07:30,829
I'm asking you
if you had any part

1533
01:07:30,895 --> 01:07:32,697
of the Centennial bombing,
yes.

1534
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:37,269
So, if you had anything
to do with this,

1535
01:07:37,335 --> 01:07:38,436
had any part in this...

1536
01:07:38,503 --> 01:07:40,171
I didn't...

1537
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:44,042
[scoffs] I did not plant that
bomb in Centennial Park

1538
01:07:44,108 --> 01:07:48,479
and I made the mistake
of assuming you knew that.

1539
01:07:51,482 --> 01:07:52,617
All right, well, let's beat

1540
01:07:52,684 --> 01:07:54,652
the hell out
of these bastards.

1541
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,055
- Okay?

[reporters start clamoring]

1543

Are you his attorney?

[camera shutters clicking]

1545
01:08:13,571 --> 01:08:17,408
What is your relationship
with Richard Jewell?

1546
01:08:17,475 --> 01:08:19,510
[Watson] I think the FBI
would be derelict

1547
01:08:19,577 --> 01:08:21,746
not to investigate
Richard Jewell.

1548
01:08:21,813 --> 01:08:23,249
They're just doing their jobs.

1549
01:08:23,315 --> 01:08:24,782
[reporter] When are you
meeting with him again?

1550
01:08:24,849 --> 01:08:26,150
[Watson] No, they're just
doing their job.

1551
01:08:26,218 --> 01:08:29,087
They're just making sure
no rock is unturned.

1552
01:08:29,153 --> 01:08:30,955
[reporter] Are you gonna
meet with him again soon?

1553
01:08:31,022 --> 01:08:32,258
Excuse me.

1554
01:08:32,324 --> 01:08:34,959
Yes. I've been friends
with Richard for 10 years.

1555
01:08:35,026 --> 01:08:36,861
- [reporter] Are you his lawyer?
- I am.

1556
01:08:36,928 --> 01:08:38,496
[reporter]
Did he set that bomb?

1557
01:08:38,563 --> 01:08:39,731
[reporter 2]
What is your name?

1558
01:08:39,797 --> 01:08:41,633
[reporter 3]
You'll be defending him?

1559
01:08:41,699 --> 01:08:43,101
[Watson] Possibly.

1560
01:08:50,975 --> 01:08:52,278
[clears throat]

1561
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:53,379
[Kathy] Not quite real
estate law, is it, Mr. Bryant?

1562
01:08:53,444 --> 01:08:56,681
Whoa! Jesus Christ!

1563
01:08:56,748 --> 01:08:58,049
Who the hell are you?

1564
01:08:58,116 --> 01:08:59,717
I could be the best friend
you'll ever have.

1565
01:08:59,784 --> 01:09:02,420
Kathy Scruggs. <i>AJC.</i>

1566
01:09:02,487 --> 01:09:04,622
[sighs] Of course you are.

1567
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:06,191
- Listen...
- Get out.

1568
01:09:06,258 --> 01:09:07,293

1569
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:08,526
defense attorney
for Richard yet?

1570
01:09:08,593 --> 01:09:10,262
- No comment.
- [groans]

1571
01:09:10,329 --> 01:09:11,462
Get out of the car.

1572
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:12,530
See, "no comment"
doesn't help me,

1573
01:09:12,597 --> 01:09:14,165
which means I can't help you.

1574
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:19,271
Is that what you wanna do?
You wanna help me?

1575
01:09:19,338 --> 01:09:20,738
Watson, I don't
get the sense you

1576
01:09:20,805 --> 01:09:22,140
grasp the tank that's
about to roll over you.

1577
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:23,841
We're talking about
the U.S. government here

1578
01:09:23,908 --> 01:09:25,576
investigating a terrorism act.

1579
01:09:25,643 --> 01:09:27,145
You need me.

1580
01:09:27,212 --> 01:09:29,647
Okay, listen, crazy lady,
you want me to call the cops?

1581
01:09:29,714 --> 01:09:31,082
[laughs] Oh, please do.

1582
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:33,252
The cops love me.
I tell their stories all day.

1583
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,585
Let me tell yours.

1584
01:09:34,652 --> 01:09:36,188
- [scoffing]
- I'm just gonna ask

1585
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,922
a couple questions that'll
help you tell your story.

1586
01:09:37,989 --> 01:09:39,391
- And you need me to help...
- Get out. Get out of my...

1587
01:09:39,457 --> 01:09:40,892
- You got some balls, man.
- Yes, I do.

1588
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,026
Get out.

1589
01:09:42,093 --> 01:09:43,594
Come on. I'll just ask you
a few questions.

1590
01:09:43,661 --> 01:09:45,297
- Get out.
- We can go together.

1591
01:09:45,364 --> 01:09:46,497
Come on. I'll get my notepad.

1592
01:09:46,564 --> 01:09:48,132
Get the fuck
out of my car now!

1593
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,767
Get out of my car!

1594
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:51,437
I'm sick of this shit.

1595
01:09:51,502 --> 01:09:53,205
You know where to find me.

1596
01:10:04,882 --> 01:10:07,386
- Yeah. Don't worry.
- Never been on TV before.

1597
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:08,820
You'll be fine.

1598
01:10:08,886 --> 01:10:10,555
Mr. Jewell's attorney,
Mr. Bryant.

1599
01:10:10,621 --> 01:10:11,789
- Thanks for coming in.
- You're welcome.

1600
01:10:11,856 --> 01:10:13,157
What are the authorities
telling you

1601
01:10:13,225 --> 01:10:14,993
about their suspicions
about your client?

1602
01:10:15,059 --> 01:10:15,860
Uh, nothing.

1603
01:10:15,927 --> 01:10:17,128
No communication whatsoever?

1604
01:10:17,196 --> 01:10:19,530
Uh, all they've said
to me is that

1605
01:10:19,597 --> 01:10:20,865
they're not going to
arrest him.

1606
01:10:20,932 --> 01:10:22,434
That's what
they told me yesterday.

1607
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:23,968
You believe that?

1608
01:10:24,035 --> 01:10:25,036
No.

1609
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:26,504
You think they are going
to arrest him?

1610
01:10:26,571 --> 01:10:27,905
I don't think they'd tell me

1611
01:10:27,972 --> 01:10:29,640
whether they were
or they weren't. That's all.

1612
01:10:29,707 --> 01:10:31,042
What do you think
of the manner

1613
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:32,877
in which the FBI
has treated your client

1614
01:10:32,944 --> 01:10:35,113
- pursuing this investigation?
- I think whoever the bum was

1615
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,614
that leaked
that Richard Jewell

1616
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:38,350
was the focus
of this investigation,

1617
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:40,118
he deserves to be prosecuted

1618
01:10:40,185 --> 01:10:41,686
or dealt with
in some serious way.

1619
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:44,088
I don't think
that this investigation

1620
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:47,725
should be conducted
under world spotlight,

1621
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:49,160
if you will, like this.

1622
01:10:49,228 --> 01:10:51,296
What's your client told you
about this cabin

1623
01:10:51,363 --> 01:10:52,764
that's being searched today?

1624
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,032
It's his former residence,
as I understand it.

1625
01:10:54,098 --> 01:10:55,800
You need
to understand something.

1626
01:10:55,867 --> 01:10:59,704
I have barely had the time
to take a breath in this case

1627
01:10:59,771 --> 01:11:01,706
since it started
the other night.

1628
01:11:01,773 --> 01:11:06,811
We have been reacting
to the media, to the FBI,

1629
01:11:06,878 --> 01:11:08,713
and I have not sat down

1630
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,049
and conducted
an in-depth interview

1631
01:11:11,115 --> 01:11:13,385
about all these things that
y'all are asking me about.

1632
01:11:13,452 --> 01:11:15,220
Then why are you so convinced
of his innocence?

1633
01:11:15,287 --> 01:11:17,088
Because I've known Richard
for a while.

1634
01:11:17,155 --> 01:11:18,723
I've looked him in the eye and
I've asked him the question.

1635
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,024
But you've admitted to me,

1636
01:11:20,091 --> 01:11:21,527
you didn't even know
he had a cabin.

1637
01:11:21,592 --> 01:11:22,994
You didn't know
about this prior arrest.

1638
01:11:23,061 --> 01:11:24,762
You didn't know
about the prior misdemeanors.

1639
01:11:24,829 --> 01:11:26,697
There's a whole lot of priors
you didn't know about.

1640
01:11:26,764 --> 01:11:29,033
I have not conducted
a thorough investigation

1641
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,470
- into Richard's history.
- No, I understand all that.

1642
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,737
I guess what I'm asking you is

1643
01:11:32,804 --> 01:11:34,273
considering that
you haven't done that,

1644
01:11:34,339 --> 01:11:35,873
and considering there are
things that you didn't know,

1645
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,376
why are you so convinced
of his innocence?

1646
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:38,477
Because I believe him.

1647
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,610
Plain and simple?

1648
01:11:39,677 --> 01:11:41,513
Yeah. That's right.

1649
01:11:41,579 --> 01:11:42,980
I don't know
a whole lot of things

1650
01:11:43,047 --> 01:11:44,649
about a whole lot of people
that I know.

1651
01:11:44,715 --> 01:11:48,187
I don't have Richard's police
records. You may. I don't...

1652
01:11:48,253 --> 01:11:52,623
I have not gotten up to speed
on some things. That's all.

1653
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:54,826
But just because
I don't know these things

1654
01:11:54,892 --> 01:11:56,961
doesn't mean
that I don't have a feel

1655
01:11:57,028 --> 01:12:00,164
for where I think
Richard is in this case.

1656
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,133
Were you aware that the
Habersham Sheriff's Department

1657
01:12:02,201 --> 01:12:04,869
had asked him to seek
psychological counseling?

1658
01:12:04,936 --> 01:12:06,604
I don't know that either.

1659
01:12:06,671 --> 01:12:07,905
But I know a lot of people

1660
01:12:07,972 --> 01:12:09,740
who ought to have
psychological counseling.

1661
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:12,177
Watson Bryant,
I thank you very much.

1662
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:13,378
See ya. Thank you.

01:12:13,445 --> 01:12:17,048

We'll be right back.

1725
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,199
You got any guns in the house?

1726
01:14:49,534 --> 01:14:51,936
Yeah, we're in Georgia.

1727
01:14:52,003 --> 01:14:54,706
Yeah, of course you do.
Go get 'em.

1728
01:14:54,772 --> 01:14:56,173
Lay 'em on your bed
so we can see 'em.

1729
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:57,842
We don't want any surprises.

1730
01:14:59,478 --> 01:15:01,747
How many of 'em
are coming in here?

1731
01:15:01,812 --> 01:15:03,080
Uh...

1732
01:15:04,616 --> 01:15:05,983
There's a couple.

1733
01:15:07,352 --> 01:15:09,854
Can they leave their shoes
outside the door?

1734
01:15:10,855 --> 01:15:12,324
Well, I could ask 'em, Bobi.

1735
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:13,924
I don't know
if they would oblige.

1736
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:17,195
- [gun cocks]
- [Bobi] Oh, God. [sighs]

1737
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:22,867
[Watson] Oh, good Lord.

1738
01:15:23,834 --> 01:15:26,538
Uh... [laughing]

1739
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:32,210
Were you expecting a zombie
invasion or something?

1740
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,379
No, I wasn't
expecting zombies.

1741
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,715
I expect deer. I hunt.

1742
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,949
[Watson] You hunt? Okay.

1743
01:15:39,016 --> 01:15:40,619
Radar, let me explain
something to you.

1744
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:42,487
All you're guilty of right now

1745
01:15:42,554 --> 01:15:45,557
is looking like the kinda guy
who might set off a bomb.

1746
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:46,824
But everything you do

1747
01:15:46,891 --> 01:15:50,495
that promotes that image
is gonna hang us.

1748
01:15:50,562 --> 01:15:52,997
Sorry. Poor choice of words.

1749
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:55,099
Those jackals out there,

1750
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:58,102
they want your ass
on a chopping block.

1751
01:15:58,169 --> 01:16:00,871
Is there anything else
odd or quirky

1752
01:16:00,938 --> 01:16:04,409
or fucking weird
that I'm gonna discover today?

1753
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:06,545
[exhales] Yeah, kinda.

1754
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:09,247
I haven't...

1755
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:13,918
I haven't paid my taxes
in about... A couple years.

1756
01:16:13,984 --> 01:16:16,455
- Oh.
- This gets better and better.

1757
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:21,226
[sighs] Guns, guns, guns.
I hate guns.

1758
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:23,160
Every time Richard
goes huntin', I say,

1759
01:16:23,228 --> 01:16:26,030
"Don't you dare drag
a dead Bambi in here.

1760
01:16:26,097 --> 01:16:28,132
"I don't wanna eat Bambi."

1761
01:16:28,966 --> 01:16:30,101
But you know what?

1762
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:32,204
Richard, when he was deputy

1763
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:34,105
with the Habersham
County Sheriff's,

1764
01:16:34,171 --> 01:16:37,942
he got 98 out of 100
on his shootin' test.

1765
01:16:38,008 --> 01:16:39,378
It was awesome.

1766
01:16:39,877 --> 01:16:41,078
Mmm-hmm.

1767
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:44,549
[clicks tongue] That's great.

1768
01:16:44,616 --> 01:16:45,784
[banging on door]

1769
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,151
- Okay.
- Dear God.

1770
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:49,688
You don't talk. I talk.
Say it.

1771
01:16:49,755 --> 01:16:52,156
I don't talk.

1772
01:16:52,224 --> 01:16:54,626
But I want those guys
to know that

1773
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:57,462
I'm law enforcement, too.
Just like them.

1774
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:00,097
See, right there?

1775
01:17:00,164 --> 01:17:01,333
That's talking.

1776
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,402
That's what we don't want,
okay?

1777
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:10,475
You picked the right lawyer,
Richard.

1778
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:16,581
- [loud knocking on door]
- [Watson] Ugh. [Sighs]

1779
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,151
We all set?

1780
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:21,919
- [Watson] Yeah.
- All right, let's go. Come on.

1781
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,389
Let's start in the back.

1782
01:17:24,456 --> 01:17:26,658
Bring it in. Let's go.
By the numbers, everybody.

1783
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:27,793
By the numbers.

1784
01:17:27,859 --> 01:17:29,059
Hold on.

1785
01:17:29,126 --> 01:17:31,263
Oh... Okay.

1786
01:17:34,533 --> 01:17:35,767
Okay.

1787
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:38,270
Yeah, so, you guys go ahead
and take everything.

1788
01:17:38,336 --> 01:17:39,970
Take the carpet,
whatever you need.

1789
01:17:40,037 --> 01:17:41,473
I'm law enforcement, too,
so I get it.

1790
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:43,442
Just know
that whatever you take,

1791
01:17:43,508 --> 01:17:46,812
it's just gonna prove
that I didn't do anything.

1792
01:17:46,878 --> 01:17:48,847
Yeah, we've done this before.

1793
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,081
You'll be counsel, Mr. Bryant?

1794
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:53,318
That's the plan, yeah.

1795
01:17:53,385 --> 01:17:54,586
All right, well,
if you're gonna stay here,

1796
01:17:54,653 --> 01:17:56,086
you're gonna have to
put these on.

1797
01:17:56,153 --> 01:17:57,556
Yeah, let's go.
Gloves and booties.

1798
01:17:57,622 --> 01:17:58,623
[Dan] Yeah.

1799
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:00,592
You heard the man.
Booties and gloves.

1800
01:18:09,301 --> 01:18:11,035
[indistinct chatter]

1801
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:30,388
[whispering] Watson, they're
emptying my Tupperware.

1802
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:32,257
All right, let's play ball
right now.

1803
01:18:32,324 --> 01:18:33,625
We'll get it back.

1804
01:18:33,692 --> 01:18:36,228
If y'all need help
finding anything,

1805
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:37,729
feel free to ask one of us.

1806
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,197
We can help.

1807
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,235
[whispers]
Just trying to help.

1808
01:18:44,669 --> 01:18:45,770
[agent] It's in there.

1809
01:18:53,945 --> 01:18:55,714
You ever read that book?

1810
01:18:57,081 --> 01:19:00,285
Got a lot in it
about police procedure.

1811
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:03,221
It's a good one.
It's kinda controversial.

1812
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,194
It's a good book.

1813
01:19:12,564 --> 01:19:14,098
It's a good book.

1814
01:19:15,099 --> 01:19:16,201
Oh, uh...

1815
01:19:16,268 --> 01:19:17,736
I can help you with that.

1816
01:19:19,136 --> 01:19:21,105
I babysit with those.

1817
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,109
You know what? Actually,
it might be easier if you guys

1818
01:19:25,176 --> 01:19:26,378
just waited outside

1819
01:19:26,444 --> 01:19:27,646
- while we did our jobs.
- Good idea.

1820
01:19:27,712 --> 01:19:29,079
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Thank you.

1821
01:19:29,146 --> 01:19:30,282
[Watson] Let's do that,
Richard.

1822
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:31,048
Let's get the hell
out of here.

1823
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:32,183
[Tom] Thank you.

1824
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,818
Johnson, Rosario, anything?

1825
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,391
[indistinct chatter]

1826
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,094
What was the agreement?

1827
01:19:44,161 --> 01:19:46,698
That I wouldn't talk. Yup.

1828
01:19:47,766 --> 01:19:49,099
Yeah, what'd you do?

1829
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:51,101
I talked.

1830
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,374
They wanna fry you.

1831
01:19:56,441 --> 01:19:57,576
You understand that?
You know that, right?

1832
01:19:57,642 --> 01:20:00,045
Everyone here
wants to fry you.

1833
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:01,646
You're a little piece
of bacon.

1834
01:20:04,081 --> 01:20:06,284
[Richard] Well,
on a lighter note,

1835
01:20:06,351 --> 01:20:09,187
you never did tell me
the name of the firm

1836
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:11,189
you moved to and whatnot.

1837
01:20:11,256 --> 01:20:13,123
I opened my own.

1838
01:20:13,191 --> 01:20:14,859
What made you do
something like that?

1839
01:20:14,926 --> 01:20:16,328
Firms mean partners,

1840
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:18,597
and partners think
they can tell you who to be.

1841
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:20,498
I don't care much
for being dictated to.

1842
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,534
[Bobi] Hey! You have no right.

1843
01:20:22,601 --> 01:20:24,302
- Come back here.
- Mama, what's wrong?

1844
01:20:24,369 --> 01:20:26,605
They went through
my underthings.

1845
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:28,707
How much indignity
do they want us to take?

1846
01:20:28,773 --> 01:20:29,674
[Watson] All right, Bobi.

1847
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,077
Hey, hold on, fellas.
Excuse me.

1848
01:20:33,244 --> 01:20:34,579
- Mama, hey...
- [reporters clamoring]

1849
01:20:34,646 --> 01:20:36,982
[Watson] Bobi.
Excuse me, fellas.

1850
01:20:37,048 --> 01:20:38,383
Bobi. Excuse me.

1851
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:39,451
[female reporter]
What did they take from you?

1852
01:20:39,517 --> 01:20:41,052
[Watson] Hold on now. Hold on.

1853
01:20:41,118 --> 01:20:43,455
Bobi, let me take care
of it for you.

1854
01:20:43,521 --> 01:20:45,223
Can I take care of it for you?

1855
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:46,391
I'm gonna go get 'em.

1856
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:47,892
I'm gonna go get 'em.
Excuse me.

1857
01:20:47,959 --> 01:20:49,527
[female reporter]
What can you share with us?

1858
01:20:50,061 --> 01:20:51,429
They found

1859
01:20:51,496 --> 01:20:53,331
some really dangerous
pantyhose, apparently.

1860
01:20:53,398 --> 01:20:55,333
- [male reporter] Seriously?
- Yeah.

1861
01:20:55,967 --> 01:20:57,268
[Tom] Richard.

1862
01:20:57,335 --> 01:20:59,437
Come here for a sec.
I wanna talk to you.

1863
01:21:01,072 --> 01:21:02,474
- Come on inside.
- Yes, sir.

1864
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:04,141
What can I help with?

1865
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:05,644
Just come on inside.
Just for a second.

1866
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:09,981
What did they pull out
of the house?

1867
01:21:10,048 --> 01:21:11,349
Did he do it, Watson?

1868
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:12,784
No, he did not.

1869
01:21:12,851 --> 01:21:14,619
Richard Jewell is
an innocent man. He's a hero.

1870
01:21:14,686 --> 01:21:16,788
If he's innocent,
then why is the FBI here?

1871
01:21:18,556 --> 01:21:22,027
[sighs] We welcome the FBI.
We're glad they're here.

1872
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:23,495
No, you don't.

1873
01:21:27,265 --> 01:21:28,967
You know that's not true,
Kathy.

1874
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:30,935
Can I see those boxes, please?

1875
01:21:32,604 --> 01:21:34,406
All right, here's what
we're gonna do.

1876
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:35,874
I'm gonna hand you
this phone...

1877
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,941
[dialing on phone]

1878
01:21:37,008 --> 01:21:38,109
...and when I do,

1879
01:21:38,209 --> 01:21:39,377
you're gonna wait
till the beep

1880
01:21:39,444 --> 01:21:40,879
and then you're gonna
say into it,

1881
01:21:40,945 --> 01:21:43,114
"There's a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1882
01:21:43,181 --> 01:21:44,215
You have 30 minutes."

1883
01:21:44,282 --> 01:21:45,283
[stammers]

1884
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,919
I'm sorry. Why?

1885
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,454
We need a voice exemplar.

1886
01:21:49,521 --> 01:21:50,755
Like you to say it
a few times.

1887
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:51,923
"There's a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1888
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,291
You have 30 minutes."

1889
01:21:53,358 --> 01:21:54,926
It might be the only way
to clear your name.

1890
01:21:56,061 --> 01:21:58,396
I do wanna help y'all.

1891
01:21:58,463 --> 01:22:00,198
I'm law enforcement, too.

1892
01:22:00,265 --> 01:22:01,933
Well, yeah.
Then you should know how

1893
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,735
evidentiary this is, right?

1894
01:22:03,802 --> 01:22:05,303
So, "There's a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1895
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:06,438
- You have 30 minutes."
- [line ringing]

1896
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:08,506
"30 minutes." Okay.

1897
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,243
[breathing nervously]

1898
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:14,079
- After the beep?
- Yeah.

1899
01:22:14,145 --> 01:22:15,380
- [Dan] Mmm-hmm.
- [line beeps]

1900
01:22:15,447 --> 01:22:18,149
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1901
01:22:18,216 --> 01:22:19,551
You have 30 minutes.

1902
01:22:19,617 --> 01:22:21,319
Okay, one more time.
Just a little louder.

1903
01:22:23,755 --> 01:22:26,357
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1904
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:28,426
You have 30 minutes.

1905
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:30,028
Okay, that's great.
Can you do it one more time?

1906
01:22:30,095 --> 01:22:32,564
Maybe let's do a series.
We'll do a couple in a row.

1907
01:22:34,466 --> 01:22:35,767
[Richard] All right.

1908
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:40,071
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1909
01:22:40,138 --> 01:22:41,539
You have 30 minutes.

1910
01:22:41,606 --> 01:22:44,075
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1911
01:22:44,142 --> 01:22:45,410
You have 30 minutes.

1912
01:22:45,477 --> 01:22:47,979
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1913
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,714
You have 30 minutes.

1914
01:22:49,781 --> 01:22:52,218
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1915
01:22:52,283 --> 01:22:53,518
You have 30 minutes.

1916
01:22:53,585 --> 01:22:55,887
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.

1917
01:22:55,954 --> 01:22:58,123
Are you fucking kidding me?
No, no, you don't talk to him.

1918
01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,491
[Richard] It's standard
procedure, they said.

1919
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,126
[Watson] No, hell it is.

1920
01:23:01,193 --> 01:23:02,494
- In Russia.
- Mr. Bryant, listen.

1921
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,129
Your client volunteered this.

1922
01:23:04,196 --> 01:23:06,831
Oh, bullshit. Maybe you can
do this. Maybe you can't.

1923
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:08,633
You're not doing it today.
Let's go, Richard.

1924
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:09,968
- Let's go.
- [Richard] I told them

1925
01:23:10,034 --> 01:23:11,703
I'm doing it
if it helps clear my name.

1926
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:14,539
- Let's go! Not today.
- Your client agreed to this.

1927
01:23:14,606 --> 01:23:15,940
I'm gonna sue your ass

1928
01:23:16,007 --> 01:23:17,308
- for intentional violation...
- [Tom] Okay.

1929
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:18,376
...of his
constitutional rights.

1930
01:23:18,443 --> 01:23:19,544
[Tom] Okay.

1931
01:23:19,611 --> 01:23:21,012
I'm having
all this shit excluded.

1932
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,647
You guys are full of shit.

1933
01:23:22,714 --> 01:23:23,715
Let's go.

1934
01:23:26,017 --> 01:23:27,018
[Dan] We got it.

1935
01:23:33,992 --> 01:23:35,593
[camera shutters clicking]

1936
01:23:46,871 --> 01:23:47,972
Have a good night.

1937
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:50,242
[Bobi] What do they want
with the vacuum cleaner?

1938
01:23:50,308 --> 01:23:52,610
All right. We're done here.

1939
01:23:57,515 --> 01:23:59,050
[groaning]

1940
01:24:00,418 --> 01:24:01,619
Richard?

1941
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:06,292
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine.

1942
01:24:06,357 --> 01:24:07,392
What's wrong?

1943
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:09,060
Let's get you inside.

1944
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:10,962
Dave, can you get her
something to drink?

1945
01:24:11,029 --> 01:24:13,064
- Maybe some water?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1946
01:24:18,469 --> 01:24:19,838
What's going on?

1947
01:24:21,005 --> 01:24:22,407
[exhales]

1948
01:24:22,473 --> 01:24:23,842
It's nothing.

1949
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:25,677
I'm fine.

1950
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:46,731
They took all my Tupperware.

1951
01:24:46,798 --> 01:24:49,767
What would they need
with my Tupperware?

1952
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:53,538
The bomber used Tupperware
to hold the nails.

1953
01:24:53,605 --> 01:24:55,139
That's standard.

1954
01:24:57,442 --> 01:25:00,411
Well, what does that
have to do with you?

1955
01:25:00,478 --> 01:25:02,847
And they took
my babysittin' tapes.

1956
01:25:02,914 --> 01:25:04,183
My Disney movies.

1957
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:07,151
Yeah, I think they did that
because they wanted to see

1958
01:25:07,219 --> 01:25:09,621
if we might've recorded
something on the tapes,

1959
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:12,023
like a political statement
or something.

1960
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:16,461
Why do you keep
defending these people?

1961
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:18,696
I'm not defending.
I'm just explaining.

1962
01:25:18,763 --> 01:25:20,698
- Well, stop it!
- [knocking at door]

1963
01:25:28,406 --> 01:25:30,441
- Hey, there she is. Hey.
- Hi.

1964
01:25:30,508 --> 01:25:32,577
- How you doin'?
- Hello.

1965
01:25:32,644 --> 01:25:34,712
This is Nadya. She's, uh...

1966
01:25:35,446 --> 01:25:36,814
She tells me what to do.

1967
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:38,716
Here. Let me take that.
That's very nice of you.

1968
01:25:38,783 --> 01:25:41,119
I thought you might
want some dinner.

1969
01:25:41,186 --> 01:25:43,322
Bless your heart.

1970
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:44,956
- Thank you.
- [Nadya] Of course.

1971
01:25:45,623 --> 01:25:48,559
Hi, I'm Richard.

1972
01:25:48,626 --> 01:25:50,396
What did I tell you
about talking, Rich?

1973
01:25:50,461 --> 01:25:51,829
[Nadya] Oh.

1974
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:54,400
Oh, God, yeah.
I guess I can't talk anymore.

1975
01:25:54,465 --> 01:25:56,501
[all chuckle]

1976
01:25:56,567 --> 01:25:58,169
[reporters clamoring]

1977
01:26:01,673 --> 01:26:04,442
Come on, Richard,
you can't hide anymore.

1978
01:26:07,946 --> 01:26:09,381
Richard, one question.
That's all.

1979
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:10,648
Did you do it?

1980
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:21,159
Richard, how many bombs
have you made?

1981
01:26:24,062 --> 01:26:27,199
What did the FBI take out
of your house, Richard?

1982
01:26:32,237 --> 01:26:33,838
[typerwriters clacking]

1983
01:26:39,178 --> 01:26:41,512
[TV playing indistinctly]

1984
01:26:41,579 --> 01:26:43,114
[phone rings]

1985
01:26:58,496 --> 01:27:00,565
[camera shutters clicking]

1986
01:27:26,557 --> 01:27:28,159
Hand grenade?

1987
01:27:28,227 --> 01:27:29,694
What do you got
a hand grenade for?

1988
01:27:29,761 --> 01:27:30,828
Yeah, it's hollowed out.

1989
01:27:30,895 --> 01:27:32,163
It's a paperweight.

1990
01:27:32,231 --> 01:27:34,532
I bought it from
a military surplus store.

1991
01:27:34,599 --> 01:27:36,402
- Yeah.
- But it's nothing.

1992
01:27:36,468 --> 01:27:38,536
Christ, of course you did.

1993
01:27:40,406 --> 01:27:42,241
Piece of the bench?

1994
01:27:42,307 --> 01:27:43,641
<i>Splintered piece of...</i>

1995
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,277
<i>What does that mean?
What is that?</i>

1996
01:27:45,344 --> 01:27:47,845
[Richard] <i>Yeah, I took
a small piece of the bench</i>

1997
01:27:47,912 --> 01:27:49,547
<i>from the crime scene.</i>

1998
01:27:49,614 --> 01:27:51,015
[Watson] From where
the bomb was?

1999
01:27:51,082 --> 01:27:53,419
[Richard] It's a souvenir.
A memento.

2000
01:27:53,485 --> 01:27:54,685
[Watson] What'd you do
that for?

2001
01:27:54,752 --> 01:27:56,687
I think it was
a pretty memorable night

2002
01:27:56,754 --> 01:27:58,323
where I did something
pretty great.

2003
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:02,227
So, I thought maybe
that was worth holding on to.

2004
01:28:02,294 --> 01:28:04,028
Wow. Okay.

2005
01:28:04,929 --> 01:28:06,064
Nice.

2006
01:28:13,171 --> 01:28:14,172
[knock on door]

2007
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,176
- Hey.
- Hey.

2008
01:28:17,242 --> 01:28:20,179
They want your hair now,
and your palm prints.

2009
01:28:21,579 --> 01:28:23,248
[sighs] Good times.

2010
01:28:24,316 --> 01:28:25,650
Come in.

2011
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:34,158
25 pulled, 25 collected.

2012
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,594
I tell you, you might have
a warrant for this,

2013
01:28:36,661 --> 01:28:37,929
but if you were
to do this to me,

2014
01:28:37,995 --> 01:28:39,597
you'd have to fight me.
[laughing] Oh!

2015
01:28:39,664 --> 01:28:42,066
You'd have to beat
the shit outta me!

2016
01:28:42,133 --> 01:28:43,734
Not very lawyerly of you,
counselor.

2017
01:28:43,801 --> 01:28:45,370
Yeah, well...

2018
01:28:45,437 --> 01:28:47,605
Can we just get this over with
before my mama comes back?

2019
01:28:47,672 --> 01:28:49,640
I'd like her not to see this.

2020
01:28:51,809 --> 01:28:53,878
[TV playing indistinctly]

2021
01:28:53,945 --> 01:28:55,680
[TV stops playing]

2022
01:28:56,714 --> 01:28:59,016
Tell me, Richard,

2023
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:02,153
you still proud
to be law enforcement?

2024
01:29:02,221 --> 01:29:06,057
You know what? Maybe if I did
my job a little better,

2025
01:29:06,124 --> 01:29:08,159
and got people
far enough away,

2026
01:29:08,227 --> 01:29:10,496
then I wouldn't be
sittin' here right now.

2027
01:29:10,562 --> 01:29:11,963
[Watson sighs]

2028
01:29:12,029 --> 01:29:15,800
Yeah, he's a real monster.
Boy, you guys nailed it.

2029
01:29:15,867 --> 01:29:18,504
Have you dummies
done the math yet

2030
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:20,205
on the call
from the pay phone?

2031
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:23,007
Hey, listen,
fuck the pay phone! Okay?

2032
01:29:23,074 --> 01:29:25,444
My clients were the people
in the park that night

2033
01:29:25,511 --> 01:29:29,214
that didn't deserve to get
their fuckin' heads blown off.

2034
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,982
You know, I actually
feel sorry for you guys.

2035
01:29:31,048 --> 01:29:33,117
When the real bomber
does it again,

2036
01:29:33,185 --> 01:29:35,220
and the country asks,
"Where was the FBI?"

2037
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:36,821
You're gonna say,
"We were busy

2038
01:29:36,888 --> 01:29:38,156
getting hair samples
from Richard Jewell."

2039
01:29:38,223 --> 01:29:40,658
- I'm done here.
- All set? Great.

2040
01:29:40,725 --> 01:29:41,959
[Watson] Oh, good.

2041
01:29:42,026 --> 01:29:43,794
Well, Richard,
thank you very much

2042
01:29:43,861 --> 01:29:45,062
for your professional
consideration.

2043
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:46,998
You know, [taps table]
cop to cop.

2044
01:29:47,064 --> 01:29:48,966
[Watson] "We're the FBI."

2045
01:29:49,033 --> 01:29:51,270
I got your cop to cop.
Right here.

2046
01:29:51,336 --> 01:29:52,904
- [Tom] Mmm-hmm.
- There's the door.

2047
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,406
[Tom] Found it. Thank you.

2048
01:29:56,874 --> 01:29:59,844
Richard, we need
to be a little less, uh...

2049
01:30:01,045 --> 01:30:02,914
solicitous and a little more

2050
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:05,317
righteous with these assjacks.

2051
01:30:05,384 --> 01:30:09,321
I mean, it's just hairs.
They'll grow back. It's fine.

2052
01:30:10,455 --> 01:30:12,191
What'd you say?

2053
01:30:12,257 --> 01:30:14,359
They're just hairs.
They'll grow back.

2054
01:30:15,527 --> 01:30:16,727
They're just hair. Hey!

2055
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:20,731
Why doesn't this shit make you
as angry as it makes me?

2056
01:30:20,798 --> 01:30:22,301
I am angry.

2057
01:30:22,367 --> 01:30:23,935
You could have fooled me.

2058
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:25,736
[scoffing] You're angry?

2059
01:30:25,803 --> 01:30:28,507
'Course I am.

2060
01:30:28,574 --> 01:30:29,840
I don't know if "angry"

2061
01:30:29,907 --> 01:30:32,843
is even a big enough word
for how I feel.

2062
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,146
Come on.

2063
01:30:35,214 --> 01:30:37,014
Then stop being
such a doormat.

2064
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:38,550
Stop trying to be
their best friend.

2065
01:30:38,617 --> 01:30:40,117
You know, they're making
fun of you out there. You know

2066
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,587
- what they're calling you?
- I know that!

2067
01:30:41,653 --> 01:30:44,690
I know what it means
when he says "cop to cop."

2068
01:30:44,755 --> 01:30:46,325
He doesn't mean cop to cop.

2069
01:30:46,391 --> 01:30:47,693
He thinks
I'm the Pillsbury Doughboy.

2070
01:30:47,758 --> 01:30:49,026
Do ya? Could have fooled me.

2071
01:30:49,093 --> 01:30:51,363
I thought you guys
were gonna get engaged.

2072
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:54,566
Hey! Richard!
You go for a cookie right now,

2073
01:30:54,633 --> 01:30:57,436
I'm gonna chop off your hands
and shove 'em up your ass!

2074
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:00,606
Try eating a cookie then,
fucker.

2075
01:31:00,672 --> 01:31:02,241
[breathing heavily]

2076
01:31:02,307 --> 01:31:04,942
Why'd you wanna represent me
and be my lawyer?

2077
01:31:05,009 --> 01:31:07,212
Hey, you looked like
you needed some help.

2078
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:11,316
You look like you might've
needed money from a book deal.

2079
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,984
Well, let me ask you,
why'd you pick me?

2080
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:14,085
There's a lot of lawyers
in the phone book.

2081
01:31:14,151 --> 01:31:15,487
What'd you pick me for?

2082
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:17,088
I picked you because
you were the only one

2083
01:31:17,154 --> 01:31:18,956
at the U.S. Small Business
Admin bureau

2084
01:31:19,023 --> 01:31:21,326
who didn't treat me like
a 5-year-old, and call me

2085
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:24,795
"bag of snacks" and "blimp,"
"Michelin Man,"

2086
01:31:24,862 --> 01:31:26,063
and "Pillsbury Doughboy."

2087
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:27,898
You're the only one
who treated me

2088
01:31:27,965 --> 01:31:29,967
like a human being!

2089
01:31:30,034 --> 01:31:31,470
And now you're just
yelling at me,

2090
01:31:31,536 --> 01:31:34,406
telling me to be somebody
that I'm not!

2091
01:31:34,473 --> 01:31:36,508
I don't know
how to be that guy!

2092
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,776
You're that guy!
I'm me!

2093
01:31:41,713 --> 01:31:43,515
[banging on door]

2094
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:49,288
What?

2095
01:31:51,657 --> 01:31:52,724
[door closes]

2096
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:54,226
[mouthing silently]

2097
01:31:54,293 --> 01:31:56,361
[softly] I don't know
what you're talking about.

2098
01:32:03,568 --> 01:32:05,704
[whispers] Oh, my Lord.

2099
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:08,206
How can they do that?

2100
01:32:08,839 --> 01:32:10,975
It's easy,

2101
01:32:11,042 --> 01:32:12,877
because you don't matter.

2102
01:32:13,811 --> 01:32:15,247
That's how come.

2103
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:21,286
[singer singing in slow motion
in distance]

2104
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:31,896
[Richard] We need to go!

2105
01:32:32,698 --> 01:32:35,166
Move!

2106
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:40,405
You guys gotta go!

2107
01:32:44,176 --> 01:32:48,380
We need to evacuate!

2108
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,351
[singing continues]

2109
01:32:56,788 --> 01:32:58,323
[bomb ticking]

2110
01:33:07,432 --> 01:33:08,966
[ticking louder]

2111
01:33:15,674 --> 01:33:18,943
[ticking and whirring]

2112
01:33:19,009 --> 01:33:21,112
[yelling]

2113
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,148
[gasping]

2114
01:33:27,386 --> 01:33:29,721
Oh. Oh.

2115
01:33:29,788 --> 01:33:31,390
[panting]

2116
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:37,895
Oh. [groans]

2117
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:40,164
[indistinct TV chatter]

2118
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:48,340
Mr. Dutchess.

2119
01:33:48,407 --> 01:33:49,408
You got a minute?

2120
01:33:50,642 --> 01:33:51,976
I got that.

2121
01:33:52,844 --> 01:33:54,044
There you go.

2122
01:33:54,111 --> 01:33:56,013
- Can I finish my food?
- Nope. Mmm.

2123
01:33:57,482 --> 01:33:58,949
Hmm, that's good.

2124
01:34:03,355 --> 01:34:05,223
[Dave] They've decided
that since

2125
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:08,092
you can't have placed
the 911 call yourself,

2126
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,495
that you must've
had a partner.

2127
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:15,267
They think your partner must
be your homosexual boyfriend,

2128
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:17,502
which they decided
is probably me.

2129
01:34:18,804 --> 01:34:19,871
[Watson snorts]

2130
01:34:19,937 --> 01:34:21,306
What?

2131
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:23,675
They asked me to wear a wire.

2132
01:34:24,776 --> 01:34:26,143
[Richard scoffs]

2133
01:34:26,211 --> 01:34:28,647
I told them to shove it.
I said you were a hero.

2134
01:34:28,713 --> 01:34:30,515
And they said,
"Well, if he really is a hero,

2135
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:31,949
then he's got nothing
to worry about

2136
01:34:32,016 --> 01:34:34,319
and neither do you."

2137
01:34:34,386 --> 01:34:38,022
They also told me that, uh,
one of your GBI buddies,

2138
01:34:38,088 --> 01:34:39,658
you know,
the one you made lasagna for

2139
01:34:39,724 --> 01:34:40,725
when he came over...

2140
01:34:40,792 --> 01:34:41,827
Yeah, Miller.

2141
01:34:41,893 --> 01:34:43,328
Yeah. Yeah.

2142
01:34:43,395 --> 01:34:45,029
Yeah.

2143
01:34:45,095 --> 01:34:46,598
He was wearing a wire, too.

2144
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:49,668
He's got a lot on you.

2145
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:54,372
[Richard sighs]

2146
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,509
[clears throat] There's, uh,
one other thing. Um...

2147
01:34:59,744 --> 01:35:03,548
They asked me if I'd ever had
any experience with pipe bombs

2148
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,983
and I had to tell them
the truth.

2149
01:35:07,352 --> 01:35:09,354
You know, the little ones.

2150
01:35:09,421 --> 01:35:11,389
We used to drop them down
gopher holes when I was a kid

2151
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,459
- in West Virginia.
- [sighs] David... Lord.

2152
01:35:14,526 --> 01:35:17,696
I told them this was years
before I even met Richard.

2153
01:35:17,762 --> 01:35:20,265
I told them a couple times.

2154
01:35:21,366 --> 01:35:22,367
Still...

2155
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:25,203
I'm sorry.

2156
01:35:26,538 --> 01:35:27,739
It's... [sighs]

2157
01:35:28,907 --> 01:35:30,107
It...

2158
01:35:30,174 --> 01:35:32,911
It's okay. Yeah.

2159
01:35:32,978 --> 01:35:35,180
[sniffs] Yep.

2160
01:35:40,218 --> 01:35:42,052
[clears throat] It's okay.

2161
01:35:42,119 --> 01:35:43,622
I did what was...

2162
01:35:43,688 --> 01:35:44,689
[unmutes TV]

2163
01:35:44,756 --> 01:35:46,324
[explosions on TV]

2164
01:35:47,024 --> 01:35:49,026
Hey. Hey, turn...

2165
01:35:49,093 --> 01:35:52,631
Come on! What are you doing?

2166
01:35:52,697 --> 01:35:56,268
We can't be watching movies
with bombs and explosions

2167
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:57,736
when they're listening.

2168
01:35:58,703 --> 01:35:59,838
[Bobi inhales sharply]

2169
01:35:59,905 --> 01:36:01,239
[Richard] Come...

2170
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:05,477
[Bobi stifles sob]

2171
01:36:08,713 --> 01:36:11,182
Y'all...

2172
01:36:11,249 --> 01:36:14,553
I'm... I'm trying to do
the right thing.

2173
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:16,354
Right?

2174
01:36:16,421 --> 01:36:19,089
Guys...
Are they not listening?

2175
01:36:19,991 --> 01:36:21,426
[stifled sob]

2176
01:36:26,163 --> 01:36:27,799
[Bobi sobbing]

2177
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:30,335
Hey, Mama, I'm sorry.

2178
01:36:32,938 --> 01:36:34,906
Mama, I'm sorry.

2179
01:36:34,973 --> 01:36:37,008
Please?
[lightly knocks on door]

2180
01:36:37,074 --> 01:36:38,276
Mama, come on out.

2181
01:36:38,343 --> 01:36:40,779
We can watch
whatever you wanna watch.

2182
01:36:40,845 --> 01:36:43,882
- [Bobi continues sobbing]
- Uh, I don't mind.

2183
01:36:43,949 --> 01:36:46,051
Mama, please... [sighs]

2184
01:36:46,116 --> 01:36:48,286
I won't say nothing
about anything.

2185
01:36:48,353 --> 01:36:50,689
- Just come on out.
- [sobbing continues]

2186
01:36:55,293 --> 01:36:57,529
Mama, I'm sorry. I'm...

2187
01:36:57,596 --> 01:36:59,129
Please?

2188
01:36:59,197 --> 01:37:00,732
Mama, please?

2189
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,342
[continues sobbing]

2190
01:37:11,843 --> 01:37:13,211
[softly] I know.

2191
01:37:13,278 --> 01:37:15,513
- I'm scared, Richard.
- I'm...

2192
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,216
I'm right there with you.

2193
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,719
It's all right.

2194
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,388
[sniffling]

2195
01:37:23,455 --> 01:37:27,392
I don't know how to protect
you from these people.

2196
01:37:28,693 --> 01:37:29,861
Hey, you know...

2197
01:37:29,928 --> 01:37:32,764
You know what?
You don't have to protect me.

2198
01:37:32,831 --> 01:37:36,133
I do the protecting. I do.

2199
01:37:36,635 --> 01:37:37,902
Yep.

2200
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:40,839
Come on. Come on out.

2201
01:37:40,905 --> 01:37:43,041
You just sit down. You watch
whatever you wanna watch.

2202
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:44,809
I don't care.

2203
01:37:44,876 --> 01:37:46,411
I don't care.

2204
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:50,749
And I'm sorry I yelled.

2205
01:37:54,853 --> 01:37:58,089
Yeah, she's had about,
mmm, three days

2206
01:37:58,155 --> 01:38:00,125
to be proud of her son,

2207
01:38:00,191 --> 01:38:03,428
and then taken away from her.

2208
01:38:04,329 --> 01:38:07,132
Yep. That ain't right.

2209
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:08,733
I'm sorry, Richard.

2210
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:15,674
Hey.

2211
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:19,544
You ready to start
fighting back?

2212
01:38:22,247 --> 01:38:23,715
Yeah.

2213
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,388
[camera shutters clicking]

2214
01:38:30,455 --> 01:38:32,090
[car horn beeping]

2215
01:38:32,157 --> 01:38:33,792
[reporters clamoring]

2216
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:43,835
Richard!

2217
01:38:43,902 --> 01:38:46,504
Are you here
to turn yourself in?

2218
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:56,514
Don't see why we can't
just let the FBI do this.

2219
01:38:56,581 --> 01:38:59,317
Uh, you trust them
with the results?

2220
01:38:59,384 --> 01:39:01,953
You're in good hands here.
Just breathe.

2221
01:39:04,255 --> 01:39:08,493
Richard, whose idea was it for
you to take a polygraph test?

2222
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,061
Watson's.

2223
01:39:10,128 --> 01:39:11,796
How do you think
you'll do on it?

2224
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:12,897
Fine.

2225
01:39:12,964 --> 01:39:14,632
[polygraph whirring]

2226
01:39:17,001 --> 01:39:19,237
Do you know who put that bomb
in Olympic Park?

2227
01:39:19,304 --> 01:39:20,805
[inhales sharply]

2228
01:39:25,276 --> 01:39:29,848
No, I do not know who planted
the bomb in Centennial Park.

2229
01:39:33,185 --> 01:39:34,285
Hey, maybe we better talk...

2230
01:39:34,352 --> 01:39:36,222
Nah. He passed.

2231
01:39:36,287 --> 01:39:38,590
Highest level.
No deception indicated.

2232
01:39:38,656 --> 01:39:41,426
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- [Nadya chuckles]

2233
01:39:41,493 --> 01:39:44,062
- Oh, my God.
- [Rackleff chuckles]

2234
01:39:44,129 --> 01:39:46,030
Thanks, man. Hey.

2235
01:39:46,798 --> 01:39:48,066
Thank you.

2236
01:39:48,133 --> 01:39:50,135
Hey. Look at you, huh?

2237
01:39:50,202 --> 01:39:51,603
You did it, man.

2238
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:52,837
[Richard] Yeah, we did it.

2239
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,439
[Watson] You did it.
You did it.

2240
01:39:54,506 --> 01:39:56,208
[Bill Clinton]
<i>We must be firm in this.</i>

2241
01:39:56,274 --> 01:39:58,576
<i>We cannot be intimidated
by acts of terror.</i>

2242
01:39:58,643 --> 01:40:01,379
<i>I want to thank
the brave security personnel.</i>

2243
01:40:01,446 --> 01:40:02,947
[Kathy laughing]

2244
01:40:03,014 --> 01:40:04,349
[Ron] Cocaine use is up
from women in their sixties.

2245
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:05,817
[Kathy] Yeah?

2246
01:40:05,884 --> 01:40:07,285
- [Ron] Yeah. Look at that.
- [Kathy] Lucky them.

2247
01:40:07,352 --> 01:40:08,920
[both laughing]

2248
01:40:08,987 --> 01:40:11,055
Holy shit, it's Jewell.

2249
01:40:11,122 --> 01:40:12,423
[Watson] Is that Kathy Scruggs?

2250
01:40:12,891 --> 01:40:14,025
Hey.

2251
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:16,594
Is this what it's like
behind the curtain?

2252
01:40:16,661 --> 01:40:18,396
- Richard Jewell here.
- Hello.

2253
01:40:18,463 --> 01:40:20,765
We're just about to
go demand a retraction.

2254
01:40:20,832 --> 01:40:22,667
Then we're gonna go get
a hamburger. You wanna come?

2255
01:40:22,734 --> 01:40:24,369
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2256
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:25,670
This is, I mean,

2257
01:40:25,737 --> 01:40:26,938
this is, like,
top-rate science fiction.

2258
01:40:27,005 --> 01:40:29,275
"Bomb suspect
sought limelight."

2259
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:30,809
Are you kidding me?

2260
01:40:30,875 --> 01:40:32,377
Who the hell
do you think you are?

2261
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:34,280
Mr. Bryant, what I do is
I report the facts.

2262
01:40:34,379 --> 01:40:35,380
You lead the public,
is what you do.

2263
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:36,447
I report the facts.

2264
01:40:36,514 --> 01:40:37,749
The facts?

2265
01:40:37,816 --> 01:40:39,050
[Kathy] That's right.
That's what I do.

2266
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:40,385
- You ignorant...
- Excuse me?

2267
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:42,288
- ...arrogant, ambitious...
- Excuse me?

2268
01:40:42,353 --> 01:40:44,290
- How did you get this job?
- [chuckles]

2269
01:40:44,355 --> 01:40:45,924
- How'd I get this job?
- [Watson] Yeah.

2270
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:47,525
Mr. Bryant, if you have
an issue, you can take it up

2271
01:40:47,592 --> 01:40:48,660
with the FBI
for investigating your client.

2272
01:40:48,726 --> 01:40:49,961
[Watson] Oh, bullshit.

2273
01:40:50,028 --> 01:40:51,362
It has nothing to do with me.
All right?

2274
01:40:51,429 --> 01:40:52,897
What I do is,
I hear the facts,

2275
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:54,432
I report them.
That is my responsibility.

2276
01:40:54,499 --> 01:40:55,867
The facts?
What about the truth, huh?

2277
01:40:55,934 --> 01:40:58,169
My guiding principle
is to report the facts.

2278
01:40:58,237 --> 01:40:59,571
[Watson]
What fucking principles?

2279
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:01,439
This isn't a principle
standing next to me.

2280
01:41:01,506 --> 01:41:02,707
Fuck your principle.

2281
01:41:02,774 --> 01:41:04,310
This man's name
is Richard Jewell.

2282
01:41:04,375 --> 01:41:05,844
He's a hero. He saved lives.

2283
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:07,313
You're unbelievable,
just coming in here.

2284
01:41:07,412 --> 01:41:08,680
I'm unbelievable?
Do you have any idea

2285
01:41:08,746 --> 01:41:11,317
what kinda wildfire
you started?

2286
01:41:11,382 --> 01:41:13,751
You've ruined this man's life.

2287
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:15,887
- Maybe you owe him an apology.
- [Kathy] Listen...

2288
01:41:15,954 --> 01:41:16,955
[Watson] How about that?

2289
01:41:17,021 --> 01:41:18,489
Mr... Mr. Jewell, I...

2290
01:41:18,556 --> 01:41:20,292
You know, you are a... What?

2291
01:41:20,358 --> 01:41:21,759
I said I'm sorry

2292
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,195
for what you and your mother
have gone through.

2293
01:41:23,262 --> 01:41:25,830
Oh, you are a miserable excuse
for a journalist.

2294
01:41:25,897 --> 01:41:27,699
- You're a parasite.
- You know what...

2295
01:41:27,765 --> 01:41:30,568
[Watson] Anything to sell a
goddamn paper, you know that?

2296
01:41:30,635 --> 01:41:32,937
[Kathy] Why don't you go chase
another ambulance?

2297
01:41:33,471 --> 01:41:34,873
Kiss my ass.

2298
01:41:35,573 --> 01:41:37,008
[Kathy chuckles]

2299
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:40,678
- He's out of order.
- Y'all can go back to work.

2300
01:41:40,745 --> 01:41:41,946
There's nothing really
to watch here.

2301
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:43,982
You can just keep
doing your jobs.

2302
01:41:46,117 --> 01:41:47,619
[both scoff]

2303
01:41:49,721 --> 01:41:50,722
Wow.

2304
01:42:27,025 --> 01:42:28,593
He didn't do it.

2305
01:42:32,331 --> 01:42:33,865
Oh, fuck.

2306
01:42:41,673 --> 01:42:43,275
You got a lot of fucking nerve
sitting here.

2307
01:42:43,342 --> 01:42:46,178
[sighs] Jewell couldn't
have made the call.

2308
01:42:46,245 --> 01:42:47,745
The math is wrong.

2309
01:42:47,812 --> 01:42:49,315
I covered the distance
from the site to the phones.

2310
01:42:49,381 --> 01:42:51,482
There's no way he would
have made it in time.

2311
01:42:53,185 --> 01:42:54,519
Yeah, we know.

2312
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:56,921
You know?

2313
01:42:58,122 --> 01:42:59,457
He had an accomplice.

2314
01:43:00,124 --> 01:43:01,193
An accomplice?

2315
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:02,961
Sure. Why not?

2316
01:43:03,027 --> 01:43:05,697
What about
the lone bomber profile?

2317
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:08,066
The wannabe cop?
With an accomplice?

2318
01:43:08,132 --> 01:43:09,268
Well, first of all,

2319
01:43:09,335 --> 01:43:11,703
profiles are always
just a jumping-off point.

2320
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:14,239
Oklahoma City had two bombers,
if you remember.

2321
01:43:15,473 --> 01:43:17,942
Okay, so who did it?
Who is it?

2322
01:43:18,009 --> 01:43:20,945
Like I'm gonna tell you
after the way you burned me.

2323
01:43:21,012 --> 01:43:22,214
Fine.

2324
01:43:22,281 --> 01:43:23,382
I'll just write
that the case against Jewell

2325
01:43:23,449 --> 01:43:24,682
is starting to weaken.

2326
01:43:24,749 --> 01:43:27,386
Bad facts, et cetera.
See how that goes.

2327
01:43:27,453 --> 01:43:29,687
You know what? I'm not sure
where you get this idea

2328
01:43:29,754 --> 01:43:34,158
that I work for you,
or that we work together.

2329
01:43:34,226 --> 01:43:36,861
[scoffs] I don't even know why
I'm fucking talking to you.

2330
01:43:36,928 --> 01:43:39,764
I know why. And you need me
just as much as I need you.

2331
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:42,867
You know what, sweetheart?

2332
01:43:42,934 --> 01:43:44,836
I don't need you
a goddamn bit.

2333
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,882
[Kathy] Can I have one more,
please?

2334
01:44:01,387 --> 01:44:04,189
- Next to me is Bobi Jewell...
- [camera shutters clicking]

2335
01:44:04,256 --> 01:44:06,791
...mother of Richard Jewell.

2336
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:10,094
By some savage twist of fate,

2337
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:11,963
Richard Jewell
has been wrongfully

2338
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:14,866
and falsely accused
of murder and mayhem.

2339
01:44:16,335 --> 01:44:17,869
Her son's accusers

2340
01:44:17,935 --> 01:44:21,639
are two of the most powerful
forces in the world today.

2341
01:44:21,706 --> 01:44:26,077
The United States government
and the media.

2342
01:44:26,144 --> 01:44:27,179
For the past four weeks,

2343
01:44:27,246 --> 01:44:29,580
these horrific forces
have combined

2344
01:44:29,647 --> 01:44:33,084
to make her daily existence
a living hell.

2345
01:44:34,186 --> 01:44:35,320
As I speak,

2346
01:44:35,387 --> 01:44:38,589
they continue to crush
the very life out of her

2347
01:44:39,291 --> 01:44:40,958
and her only son.

2348
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:43,061
I introduce Barbara Jewell,

2349
01:44:43,127 --> 01:44:46,998
the 113th victim
of the Centennial bombing.

2350
01:44:52,837 --> 01:44:54,172
[Bobi clears throat]

2351
01:44:57,409 --> 01:45:00,212
My name is Barbara Jewell.

2352
01:45:00,279 --> 01:45:02,747
I am employed
as a claims coordinator

2353
01:45:02,814 --> 01:45:05,049
with a local insurance agency,

2354
01:45:05,116 --> 01:45:07,952
and I have worked there
for 13 years.

2355
01:45:08,986 --> 01:45:11,490
Approximately four weeks ago,

2356
01:45:11,557 --> 01:45:14,526
over 100 people were injured

2357
01:45:14,592 --> 01:45:17,762
and two people
lost their lives

2358
01:45:17,829 --> 01:45:21,533
as a result
of the Olympic Park bombing.

2359
01:45:21,599 --> 01:45:26,205
My heart goes out to these
victims and their families.

2360
01:45:28,973 --> 01:45:31,376
I am so very drained.

2361
01:45:33,412 --> 01:45:34,846
I hope and pray to God

2362
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:38,049
that nobody ever has to
go through this again.

2363
01:45:39,717 --> 01:45:41,119
I do not think any of you

2364
01:45:41,186 --> 01:45:44,722
can even begin to imagine
what our lives are like.

2365
01:45:46,558 --> 01:45:48,759
The media
has portrayed my son...

2366
01:45:50,229 --> 01:45:54,165
as the person
who has committed this crime.

2367
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:59,338
They have taken
all privacy from us.

2368
01:45:59,404 --> 01:46:01,639
They have taken all peace.

2369
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:07,145
They watch and photograph
everything we do.

2370
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,582
Like the media,

2371
01:46:10,648 --> 01:46:14,886
the FBI follows his every move

2372
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:18,190
and watches
my home constantly.

2373
01:46:19,157 --> 01:46:20,392
And why?

2374
01:46:21,627 --> 01:46:23,127
[voice breaks] My son...

2375
01:46:33,539 --> 01:46:35,973
My son is innocent.

2376
01:46:38,177 --> 01:46:41,647
Richard is not
the Olympic Park bomber.

2377
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,950
Richard is not a murderer.

2378
01:46:46,017 --> 01:46:49,020
He saved people's lives.

2379
01:46:52,023 --> 01:46:57,229
Please hear me, Mr. President,
and help me.

2380
01:46:57,296 --> 01:47:00,365
You have the power
to end this nightmare.

2381
01:47:01,266 --> 01:47:03,402
My son is a hero.

2382
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:08,105
I think the FBI
knows that by now.

2383
01:47:10,107 --> 01:47:13,945
If they do not intend
to charge my son,

2384
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:15,913
please tell us.

2385
01:47:16,714 --> 01:47:18,950
Please tell the world.

2386
01:47:19,884 --> 01:47:21,819
Mr. President.

2387
01:47:28,759 --> 01:47:33,164
[crying]
Please clear my son's name.

2388
01:47:42,474 --> 01:47:44,509
- [Watson, softly] Okay.
- [Bobi sniffles]

2389
01:47:55,721 --> 01:47:57,154
[continues crying]

2390
01:47:59,658 --> 01:48:01,092
You did good.

2391
01:48:02,994 --> 01:48:04,263
[Bobi] Richard.

2392
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:09,635
[Richard whimpers]

2393
01:48:09,701 --> 01:48:11,436
Oh, Mama.

2394
01:48:12,304 --> 01:48:15,072
Oh, thank you for doing that.

2395
01:48:16,774 --> 01:48:18,310
[shuddering]

2396
01:48:18,377 --> 01:48:20,178
Oh, I'm sorry.

2397
01:48:21,246 --> 01:48:23,715
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I cried.

2398
01:48:23,781 --> 01:48:25,384
I... I didn't mean to cry.

2399
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:28,085
No, you did real good.
You did better than good.

2400
01:48:28,886 --> 01:48:31,022
You ready?

2401
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:33,492
Let's go show them
who you are.

2402
01:48:34,892 --> 01:48:36,595
Oh, God.

2403
01:48:36,662 --> 01:48:38,630
I'm so glad that's over.

2404
01:48:38,697 --> 01:48:40,031
You did good.

2405
01:48:50,808 --> 01:48:52,444
[quietly] All right.

2406
01:49:28,513 --> 01:49:30,047
[phone ringing]

2407
01:49:36,388 --> 01:49:37,988
Gentlemen, please have a seat.

2408
01:49:38,055 --> 01:49:39,424
We'll be right with you.

2409
01:49:40,057 --> 01:49:41,393
[Richard sighs]

2410
01:49:44,563 --> 01:49:45,963
[exhales]

2411
01:49:49,401 --> 01:49:51,168
All right, let me tell you
how it's gonna go.

2412
01:49:51,236 --> 01:49:54,306
They're gonna ask to see me
first, set the ground rules.

2413
01:49:54,373 --> 01:49:57,576
I wanna make sure
they know I'm not gay.

2414
01:49:59,478 --> 01:50:02,681
Richard, I think
we got bigger fish to fry,

2415
01:50:02,748 --> 01:50:05,684
but, uh, you'll get the chance
to tell them that.

2416
01:50:05,751 --> 01:50:07,252
I'm sure.

2417
01:50:09,554 --> 01:50:11,189
Agent Shaw.

2418
01:50:22,234 --> 01:50:24,902
Dare you to see
if he's got any Snickers.

2419
01:50:25,903 --> 01:50:26,904
Kinda hungry.

2420
01:50:26,971 --> 01:50:28,373
[Richard sighs]

2421
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:31,008
You know what
a 1001 is, Radar?

2422
01:50:32,177 --> 01:50:35,012
Yes, sir.
It's lying to a federal agent.

2423
01:50:35,079 --> 01:50:36,314
It's a felony.

2424
01:50:36,381 --> 01:50:38,850
You say anything in there
that isn't true,

2425
01:50:38,916 --> 01:50:40,084
they can put you in jail

2426
01:50:40,151 --> 01:50:41,553
without ever proving
you're a bomber.

2427
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:43,388
Hey.

2428
01:50:43,455 --> 01:50:46,056
You don't know what to say,
you say nothing.

2429
01:50:46,123 --> 01:50:47,559
You ask
for a five-minute break,

2430
01:50:47,626 --> 01:50:49,227
you consult with me.

2431
01:50:49,294 --> 01:50:51,496
You do not improvise.

2432
01:50:51,563 --> 01:50:52,664
You got that?

2433
01:50:53,964 --> 01:50:55,400
Yes, sir.

2434
01:50:55,467 --> 01:50:57,502
So if you don't know
what to say, what do you do?

2435
01:50:57,569 --> 01:50:59,538
- I don't say a damn thing.
- That's right.

2436
01:50:59,604 --> 01:51:00,639
Mr. Bryant?

2437
01:51:06,745 --> 01:51:08,213
[sighs heavily]

2438
01:51:11,883 --> 01:51:13,318
[phone rings]

2439
01:51:21,493 --> 01:51:22,627
Can I help you?

2440
01:51:22,694 --> 01:51:25,263
I was taking a look.

2441
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,203
[sighs]

2442
01:51:31,269 --> 01:51:33,238
How do you guys
wanna handle this?

2443
01:51:35,407 --> 01:51:36,675
[Tom] Well, we're gonna ask you
some questions,

2444
01:51:36,741 --> 01:51:37,809
and you're gonna
give us some answers.

2445
01:51:37,876 --> 01:51:39,244
How's that sound?

2446
01:51:40,479 --> 01:51:41,580
Okay.

2447
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:43,849
Sounds good.

2448
01:51:43,915 --> 01:51:45,517
I'll go get him.

2449
01:51:47,084 --> 01:51:48,820
Hey, you ready, boyo?

2450
01:51:48,887 --> 01:51:49,955
Yeah.

2451
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:51,155
I think so. Yeah.

2452
01:51:51,223 --> 01:51:52,491
No, I mean ready.

2453
01:51:52,557 --> 01:51:54,124
Look at these guys
not as suspect to agent,

2454
01:51:54,192 --> 01:51:55,694
but as cop to cop.

2455
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,896
Don't give them any more
deference than they're due.

2456
01:51:57,963 --> 01:51:59,464
And don't keep
calling them "sir."

2457
01:51:59,531 --> 01:52:02,767
Yeah, well, they're still
the United States government.

2458
01:52:02,834 --> 01:52:04,636
No, they aren't
the United States government.

2459
01:52:04,703 --> 01:52:06,036
They're just three pricks

2460
01:52:06,103 --> 01:52:07,104
who work for
the United States government.

2461
01:52:07,171 --> 01:52:08,507
You understand the difference?

2462
01:52:08,573 --> 01:52:11,743
Nobody in that room
is a better man than you.

2463
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:13,143
You understand?

2464
01:52:13,612 --> 01:52:14,779
Come on.

2465
01:52:14,846 --> 01:52:16,381
You'll be fine.

2466
01:52:21,553 --> 01:52:23,688
[whispers] That's it.
Sit right there.

2467
01:52:23,755 --> 01:52:24,823
[Richard] Right here?

2468
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:26,090
[Watson] Yeah.

2469
01:52:33,298 --> 01:52:34,666
[Watson clears throat]

2470
01:52:35,901 --> 01:52:37,134
Thank you for joining us.

2471
01:52:37,202 --> 01:52:38,837
Uh, Mr. Jewell,

2472
01:52:38,904 --> 01:52:40,205
we've got a few questions,

2473
01:52:40,272 --> 01:52:43,140
regarding the events
of July 27th, 1996,

2474
01:52:43,208 --> 01:52:44,543
as you probably know.

2475
01:52:44,609 --> 01:52:47,712
Specifically the bombing
in Centennial Park.

2476
01:52:54,084 --> 01:52:56,555
Mr. Jewell,
you ever find yourself

2477
01:52:56,621 --> 01:53:01,426
accessing a Internet site
called Candyman's Candyland

2478
01:53:01,493 --> 01:53:05,764
regarding the contents
of <i>The Anarchist Cookbook?</i>

2479
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:08,199
No, I have not.

2480
01:53:08,266 --> 01:53:09,968
But you do have
police training

2481
01:53:10,035 --> 01:53:11,803
in handling explosives?

2482
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:14,171
Asked and answered.

2483
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:15,874
Did you ever collect
any pieces of pipe

2484
01:53:15,941 --> 01:53:19,811
from, uh, the construction
of Centennial Park?

2485
01:53:20,745 --> 01:53:22,514
No, I did not.

2486
01:53:22,581 --> 01:53:26,017
Do you remember telling
anybody at the park, uh,

2487
01:53:26,083 --> 01:53:27,419
"Take my picture now,

2488
01:53:27,485 --> 01:53:29,788
because pretty soon
I'm gonna be famous"?

2489
01:53:29,854 --> 01:53:31,189
No, sir.

2490
01:53:31,256 --> 01:53:32,357
[Tom] Really?

2491
01:53:32,424 --> 01:53:34,158
You sure about that?

2492
01:53:34,893 --> 01:53:36,494
100%.

2493
01:53:38,330 --> 01:53:39,831
How about, did you say,

2494
01:53:39,898 --> 01:53:41,066
"I'm on my way to Atlanta.

2495
01:53:41,131 --> 01:53:42,901
It's gonna be a mess
out there"?

2496
01:53:42,968 --> 01:53:46,338
[sighs] I was referring
to the traffic jams.

2497
01:53:47,706 --> 01:53:48,840
Mr. Jewell,

2498
01:53:48,907 --> 01:53:51,176
why specifically did
you want to be stationed

2499
01:53:51,242 --> 01:53:54,111
at that sound and light tower?

2500
01:53:54,179 --> 01:53:57,582
I just liked
listening to the music,

2501
01:53:57,649 --> 01:54:00,117
and, the night before,
I got to bring my mama down.

2502
01:54:00,185 --> 01:54:03,488
We got to listen
to Kenny Rogers.

2503
01:54:03,555 --> 01:54:06,691
She liked that. That was nice.

2504
01:54:06,758 --> 01:54:10,662
And I guess I also get
a nice vantage point

2505
01:54:10,729 --> 01:54:13,798
to take a look at
all the pretty girls.

2506
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:17,002
I am not a homosexual.

2507
01:54:17,068 --> 01:54:20,472
And neither is David Dutchess.

2508
01:54:20,538 --> 01:54:23,074
So you and David Dutchess
are not lovers?

2509
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:24,376
Asked and answered.

2510
01:54:25,944 --> 01:54:27,879
Mr. Jewell, you said before

2511
01:54:27,946 --> 01:54:30,515
that in your comings
and goings back and forth

2512
01:54:30,582 --> 01:54:33,551
from the stage to the tower
that you couldn't get, uh,

2513
01:54:33,618 --> 01:54:36,521
an exact fix on the time.
Is that correct?

2514
01:54:37,889 --> 01:54:39,090
[hesitates]

2515
01:54:39,156 --> 01:54:42,159
Yes, but when you
have the runs,

2516
01:54:42,227 --> 01:54:44,262
which I did, excuse me,

2517
01:54:44,329 --> 01:54:46,865
you're not thinking
about what time it is.

2518
01:54:46,931 --> 01:54:48,633
You're just trying to

2519
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:49,701
[chuckles]

2520
01:54:49,768 --> 01:54:53,238
crab-walk to a bathroom,
you know?

2521
01:54:53,304 --> 01:54:55,840
So you don't remember
the exact time

2522
01:54:55,907 --> 01:54:57,375
that you saw the drunks

2523
01:54:57,442 --> 01:54:59,511
throwing the beer cans
against the tower?

2524
01:54:59,577 --> 01:55:00,578
Right?

2525
01:55:01,279 --> 01:55:02,580
No.

2526
01:55:02,647 --> 01:55:04,182
You don't remember
the exact time

2527
01:55:04,249 --> 01:55:06,184
you first saw the backpack?

2528
01:55:06,251 --> 01:55:07,786
That's correct.

2529
01:55:07,852 --> 01:55:10,855
You ever seen a backpack
like that before, Mr. Jewell?

2530
01:55:10,922 --> 01:55:12,991
Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah.

2531
01:55:13,058 --> 01:55:15,794
You ever see that specific
backpack before, Mr. Jewell?

2532
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:18,196
Asked and answered.
Can we move on?

2533
01:55:18,263 --> 01:55:20,565
Mr. Jewell,

2534
01:55:20,632 --> 01:55:24,135
did you conspire with
David Dutchess or anybody else

2535
01:55:24,202 --> 01:55:27,439
to plant a bomb
in Centennial Park?

2536
01:55:29,174 --> 01:55:30,475
[people screaming]

2537
01:55:34,045 --> 01:55:35,580
[women crying]

2538
01:55:37,115 --> 01:55:38,516
[panicked shouting]

2539
01:55:39,984 --> 01:55:41,386
No.

2540
01:55:41,453 --> 01:55:42,787
[Tom] Then how the fuck
did you know

2541
01:55:42,854 --> 01:55:44,889
to be on the other side
of that AT&T tower

2542
01:55:44,956 --> 01:55:47,692
where you knew you'd be
protected from the blast?

2543
01:55:47,759 --> 01:55:50,295
A bomb went off right
where you were stationed.

2544
01:55:50,361 --> 01:55:52,464
Chaos erupts.
Bodies hit the ground.

2545
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:54,799
Cops go flying.
Hell, I was one of them.

2546
01:55:54,866 --> 01:55:56,935
You come out
without a goddamn scratch.

2547
01:55:57,001 --> 01:55:58,870
How does that happen, Richard?

2548
01:56:02,208 --> 01:56:03,842
[inhales, scoffs softly]

2549
01:56:06,611 --> 01:56:08,780
Can I ask all you fellas
a question?

2550
01:56:08,847 --> 01:56:10,849
Jesus. What?

2551
01:56:14,018 --> 01:56:17,689
Do you have any kind
of case against me?

2552
01:56:17,756 --> 01:56:19,057
[Tom scoffs]

2553
01:56:19,124 --> 01:56:20,792
I mean evidence.

2554
01:56:20,859 --> 01:56:26,364
Like, any traces of anything
on my mama's Tupperware?

2555
01:56:26,431 --> 01:56:30,702
Or did you find
any bomb-making materials

2556
01:56:30,769 --> 01:56:32,003
in her apartment?

2557
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:33,138
Or did you find some...

2558
01:56:33,205 --> 01:56:34,405
Okay. Hey, hey.

2559
01:56:34,472 --> 01:56:35,907
Richard, we don't
need to volunteer...

2560
01:56:35,974 --> 01:56:38,543
No. I'm gonna say this
if I'm gonna say anything.

2561
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:41,312
I walk in here
and I look at...

2562
01:56:41,379 --> 01:56:44,048
the circle decal
on your windows there,

2563
01:56:44,115 --> 01:56:45,583
and I'm thinking...

2564
01:56:45,650 --> 01:56:49,754
You know, I used to think
that federal law enforcement

2565
01:56:49,821 --> 01:56:52,123
was just about
the highest calling

2566
01:56:52,191 --> 01:56:54,425
a person could aspire to.

2567
01:56:54,492 --> 01:56:57,295
And I'm not sure I think
that anymore, you know?

2568
01:56:57,362 --> 01:56:58,897
Not after all this.

2569
01:57:01,966 --> 01:57:03,601
I did my job that night,

2570
01:57:03,668 --> 01:57:06,437
and some people are alive
because of that.

2571
01:57:07,405 --> 01:57:09,140
But do you think
that the next time

2572
01:57:09,208 --> 01:57:12,377
some security guard
sees a suspicious package,

2573
01:57:12,443 --> 01:57:15,013
that he or she's
gonna call it in?

2574
01:57:16,147 --> 01:57:17,816
I doubt it.

2575
01:57:17,882 --> 01:57:19,251
You know? 'Cause
they're gonna look at that

2576
01:57:19,317 --> 01:57:20,585
and they're gonna think,

2577
01:57:20,652 --> 01:57:23,388
"I don't wanna be
another Richard Jewell.

2578
01:57:23,454 --> 01:57:25,356
So I'm just gonna run."

2579
01:57:27,392 --> 01:57:29,894
How's that make
anybody any safer?

2580
01:57:32,096 --> 01:57:34,666
Y'all can keep following
me around some more

2581
01:57:34,732 --> 01:57:36,868
doing what you're doing.
I can stand it.

2582
01:57:36,935 --> 01:57:40,538
But I just know that
every second you spend on me

2583
01:57:40,605 --> 01:57:41,773
is time that
you're not spending

2584
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,242
on the real guy who did it,

2585
01:57:43,309 --> 01:57:44,976
and it's like Watson said.
What...

2586
01:57:47,313 --> 01:57:49,080
What happens when he...
[sighs]

2587
01:57:51,549 --> 01:57:53,985
What happens when
he does it again?

2588
01:58:01,293 --> 01:58:02,760
[chuckles]

2589
01:58:02,827 --> 01:58:08,533
So, do you have anything
you wanna charge me with?

2590
01:58:10,269 --> 01:58:11,903
[Tom sighs quietly]

2591
01:58:14,439 --> 01:58:15,874
Can you?

2592
01:58:18,042 --> 01:58:19,510
[sighs]

2593
01:58:26,484 --> 01:58:27,685
Well.

2594
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,889
I think it's time to go.

2595
01:59:02,086 --> 01:59:03,255
How'd he do?

2596
01:59:03,322 --> 01:59:04,555
He did great.

2597
01:59:06,724 --> 01:59:08,826
[chuckles] God.

2598
01:59:10,061 --> 01:59:11,062
[Richard] Yeah.

2599
01:59:14,098 --> 01:59:15,133
Go on.

2600
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:32,251
- [Watson] Hey.
- Gentlemen.

2601
01:59:32,318 --> 01:59:33,584
[Watson] Agent Shaw.

2602
01:59:33,651 --> 01:59:35,321
Got something for ya.

2603
01:59:35,387 --> 01:59:36,955
[Watson] What's this?

2604
01:59:37,021 --> 01:59:38,223
Marriage proposal.

2605
01:59:39,023 --> 01:59:40,525
[Watson] Oh.

2606
01:59:40,591 --> 01:59:42,060
My lucky day.

2607
01:59:43,228 --> 01:59:44,696
Uh...

2608
01:59:47,932 --> 01:59:48,833
Okay.

2609
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:50,436
Well, this is a good start.

2610
01:59:50,501 --> 01:59:51,669
When's the press conference?

2611
01:59:51,736 --> 01:59:53,037
I'm assuming
you'll be announcing

2612
01:59:53,104 --> 01:59:55,873
to all the news outlets,
Tom Brokaw and the like.

2613
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:58,810
Mr. Bryant,
let me be perfectly clear.

2614
01:59:58,876 --> 02:00:01,512
I still think
your client is guilty as hell.

2615
02:00:02,847 --> 02:00:03,848
Hmm?

2616
02:00:07,252 --> 02:00:08,686
Have a nice day.

2617
02:00:09,887 --> 02:00:12,523
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion.

2618
02:00:22,166 --> 02:00:23,534
[Richard] "This is
to advise you

2619
02:00:23,601 --> 02:00:25,636
that based
on the evidence..."

2620
02:00:29,807 --> 02:00:31,109
[Watson] It's over.

2621
02:00:32,877 --> 02:00:35,713
Is it...
Is it really over,

2622
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:39,684
or is this just another
one of their things?

2623
02:00:41,387 --> 02:00:43,188
You won. It's over.

2624
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:54,098
[chuckles lightly]

2625
02:01:03,141 --> 02:01:04,742
[chuckles softly]

2626
02:01:10,349 --> 02:01:11,849
You did good.

2627
02:01:15,354 --> 02:01:16,988
[gulps]

2628
02:01:17,055 --> 02:01:20,758
Oh, I wanna see... [sniffs]
I wanna see Mama.

2629
02:01:20,825 --> 02:01:22,026
You wanna see your mama?

2630
02:01:22,093 --> 02:01:23,094
[Richard] Yeah.

2631
02:01:25,563 --> 02:01:26,798
[Watson] We can do that.

2632
02:01:26,864 --> 02:01:28,733
[chuckles, sniffs]

2633
02:01:31,702 --> 02:01:33,604
[taps on paper] that's real?

2634
02:01:36,741 --> 02:01:38,310
That's what it says.

2635
02:01:40,546 --> 02:01:41,913
"...not considered a target

2636
02:01:41,979 --> 02:01:43,681
in the federal
criminal investigation

2637
02:01:43,748 --> 02:01:47,219
of the bombing of
July 27th, 1996,

2638
02:01:47,286 --> 02:01:49,254
Centennial Park."

2639
02:01:54,493 --> 02:01:55,593
Hey.

2640
02:01:55,660 --> 02:01:57,161
[Watson] Hey.

2641
02:01:57,229 --> 02:01:58,430
[breathes shakily]

2642
02:01:58,497 --> 02:02:00,031
- Hey.
- [faintly] Hey.

2643
02:02:01,266 --> 02:02:03,034
Thank you.

2644
02:02:03,101 --> 02:02:04,303
Thank you.

2645
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:07,171
[Watson] You got it.

2646
02:02:10,675 --> 02:02:12,043
[Richard, faintly] Thank you.

2647
02:02:13,412 --> 02:02:14,612
Hey.

2648
02:02:19,117 --> 02:02:20,252
[sobbing quietly]

2649
02:02:20,319 --> 02:02:21,320
[Watson, softly] Hey.

2650
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:30,061
[knock on door]

2651
02:03:00,225 --> 02:03:01,826
[Bobi gasps]

2652
02:03:32,857 --> 02:03:34,825
- [door opens]
- [phone rings]

2653
02:03:42,668 --> 02:03:44,835
Hello, Watson Bryant.

2654
02:03:44,902 --> 02:03:45,937
[Watson] Hey.

2655
02:03:46,003 --> 02:03:47,472
What can I do you for?

2656
02:03:47,539 --> 02:03:49,641
How are you? How's, uh...

2657
02:03:49,707 --> 02:03:51,210
My God, how's Nadya?

2658
02:03:51,276 --> 02:03:53,412
[Watson] They found him,
Richard.

2659
02:03:53,478 --> 02:03:54,580
Found who?

2660
02:03:54,646 --> 02:03:56,315
Eric Rudolph.

2661
02:03:58,283 --> 02:04:01,286
He confessed to the bombing
at Centennial Park.

2662
02:04:03,854 --> 02:04:06,358
You know when
he's being arraigned?

2663
02:04:06,991 --> 02:04:08,193
I don't know.

2664
02:04:08,260 --> 02:04:10,962
- Can you find out for me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

2665
02:04:12,797 --> 02:04:14,098
Look at you.

2666
02:04:20,004 --> 02:04:21,340
[taps counter]

2667
