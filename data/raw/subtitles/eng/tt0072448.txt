00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,200
<i>—First call for merchant ship Vulcan,
out of Lisbon and bound for Caracas.—

2
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,350
<i>—Señors and Señoras,
first call for Caracas.</i>—

3
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,600
<i>—Passengers will
please proceed to Pier 3.—

4
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,200
<i>— Isabella, out of Santa Cruz,
now arriving in port.—

5
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,600
Look!
What Islands are these?

6
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,400
The Azores - the first place we
stopped after we left the mainland.

7
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,600
<i>- Oh, with my hat fell in water?
 - Yes.

8
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,550
<i>And all the seagulls went
after it, remember?

9
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,700
<i>Yes, I remember.

10
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,900
<i>—Señors and Señoras,
first call for Caracas.—

11
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,700
<i>...where we are now.
Now look carefully.

12
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,400
<i>- Can you find Cartagena?
- Here?

13
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,300
No… look carefully.

14
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,400
Wait... look, it's there!

15
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Very good, Rafaelito.

16
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,600
In fact, the boat took us
from here, Barcelona…

17
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,000
across the Atlantic Ocean
into the Caribbean Sea,

18
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,100
and here to Cartagena.

19
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,300
And across these mountains here…

20
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,900
will be our home…
Nueva Aragón.

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,900
That was quite a voyage.

22
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,100
Oh…
Diego!

23
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,420
Diego,
what are you doing here?

24
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,200
I can't believe it.
We’ve only just arrived.

25
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,400
Well, after ten years,
we won’t have much of a visit -

26
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,910
I sail for Spain tomorrow.

27
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,667
But perhaps then I
might convince you to stay.

28
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,100
- I can't.

29
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,590
- I'm sure you remember Maria?
- Of course.

30
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,340
- Diego, what a wonderful surprise!
- Thank you.

31
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,800
- And who's that?
- Rafaelito. Rafaelito, come.

32
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,400
How do you do, Sir?

33
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,900
Shake hands with the best swordsman
in the Old World.

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,300
<i>And in the New World as well,

35
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,000
<i>I presume,
unless you've taken my advice

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,300
<i>and put away your sword.

37
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,500
<i>In this part of the world,
that would be very unwise, indeed.

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,900
<i>Centuries of tradition has left us with

39
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,550
<i>a mentality that resists
any attempt at change.

40
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,600
<i>Europe is old and set in its ways,

41
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,120
but the New World is
the ideal place to create a model...

42
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,870
of humanity,
and justice in government.

43
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,380
Ten years later, and you’re
still having the same daydreams.

44
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,630
And perhaps, ten years from now
they will have come true.

45
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,670
And even you will agree
it was worth waiting for.

46
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,800
Miguel, you're about to become
the governor of a colonial province…

47
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,390
… that has always been ruled
by greed and hatred.

48
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,980
- In the past, yes, but --
- You can't change it.

49
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,360
Perhaps not.
But I shall die trying.

50
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,200
You see Diego, it was
God's will that

51
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
my uncle should
die of malaria,

52
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,580
and I should take his place
as the new governor.

53
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,500
And...

54
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,433
I shall govern
according to God's will.

55
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,670
If your uncle died of malaria,
it was Man's will, not God's.

56
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,100
What are you saying?

57
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,000
There is no malaria
in the eastern provinces.

58
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,640
- Maria, pay no attention. He-- he's jok--
- I'm not joking, Miguel.

59
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,800
<i>You</i> are, if you think you can play
the shining knight in armor without armor.

60
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,700
- Diego, my <i>honor</i> is my armor<i>!</i>
- The armor of the fool<i>!

61
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,400
Don't you call my father a fool!

62
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,100
He's the bravest man
in the world!

63
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,500
You’re not as brave as he is!

64
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
- You're the fool, you’re the fool!

65
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,000
Come on, dear, time to go to bed.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
- Don’t you talk that way to my father
- <i>All right, dear, come along.

67
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,632
... he had no right to say it, I don’t care.

68
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,010
- I'm sorry, Miguel.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

69
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,050
A son is bound to think
a lot of his father.

70
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,520
- Why don't you stay with me a little longer?
- No. Thank you.

71
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,700
I have to get an early start
in the morning.

72
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,980
I understand.

73
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,400
I’m much too restless to sleep.

74
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,300
Perhaps Joaquín will take
the evening air with me.

75
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,750
He's, uh, my friend… and servant.
He cannot speak, but he can hear…

76
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,100
perfectly.

77
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,000
So, it was good to see you again.

78
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,100
Good bye…
Governor.

79
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,700
Come.

80
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Thank you.

81
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,100
Miguel!

82
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
Miguel.

83
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,900
Kill him.

84
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,700
Miguel!

85
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,000
- Who sent you?
- Huerta. Colonel Huerta.

86
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,000
I want to know why.
Why… <i>why?

87
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
No governor
must reach Nueva Aragón.

88
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,420
Diego, no-- Deigo, no!

89
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,600
Oh, Diego,

90
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,900
everywhere I go I find
man’s need for violence.

91
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,100
Very well…

92
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,100
no governor will arrive there.

93
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,200
Yes, he will.
A governor will arrive there.

94
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,600
And he'll make them pay for this.

95
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,100
Believe me.

96
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,900
No, Diego. You can't go.
You’d go there to kill.

97
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,700
Save your strength, Miguel, please.

98
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,600
Diego, you must promise…

99
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Swear to me, if you go in my place,
the new governor will never kill.

100
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,100
Remember, Diego,
I am that governor.

101
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,900
My principles… my ideals…

102
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,400
You must keep them
alive, Diego.

103
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,600
Take this seal,
and swear on the life of my son…

104
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,600
I have but a moment.

105
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,400
Swear.

106
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,300
I swear.

107
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,300
Papa?

108
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,650
No, Rafaelito.

109
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,900
It's me.

110
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,700
Your father had to
go away last night...

111
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,900
to take up his post
as governor.

112
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,550
But why didn't
he take me with him?

113
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,490
Because his job
is a very dangerous one.

114
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
He had to go alone.

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,380
But you are right.

116
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,800
Your father is the best
and bravest man in the world.

117
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,900
And for that reason,

118
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,220
he will succeed.

119
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,900
<i>Whoa!

120
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,500
<i>Whoa!

121
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Gentlemen of the Aristocratic Council…

122
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,300
it is three months now
since our governor died.

123
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,850
And his successor has not yet
arrived from Spain.

124
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,900
The simple truth is...

125
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,950
that Spain is too distant
from Nueva Aragón.

126
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,800
And our situation is far too serious
to tolerate another moment’s delay.

127
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,850
Our enemies surround us
on every side.

128
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,800
Up in the Cordillera,
the English have hired bandits,

129
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,500
who systematically harrass
and rob our transports.

130
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,100
In the interior
they build revolution.

131
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,600
What we need, Gentlemen,
is drastic action, and we need it now.

132
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,100
I call upon you
to place in my hands...

133
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,600
the army...

134
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,300
and...

135
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,000
the authority of our government.

136
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
I assume I have
your consent, Gentlemen.

137
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,650
Consent by silence…
eh, Colonel Huerta?

138
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,500
You are Colonel Huerta,
are you not?

139
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,700
I am.

140
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,100
But of course, Gentlemen…
I can understand,

141
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,340
and appreciate the heavy weight
of such a responsibility.

142
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,300
What responsibility is it
you're talking of?

143
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,300
Why, my own, naturally.

144
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,400
I am…
Miguel Vega de la Serna.

145
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,300
By sovereign grace…
your new governor.

146
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,300
My commission, Colonel.

147
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,500
Gentlemen, Gentlemen…
a little decorum, please.

148
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,700
When did you arrive,
Your Excellency?

149
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,700
But a moment ago.

150
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,410
I did not want to interrupt you…

151
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,700
as I thought the occasion
gave me a splendid opportunity...

152
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
to assess the circumstances.

153
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,400
And were you able…
Did you assess the circumstances?

154
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,900
Oh!

155
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,500
Oh, I'm afraid so.

156
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,720
And unless you exaggerate,
things are very bad, indeed.

157
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,060
To think that I was
already sufficiently shaken...

158
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,700
by the tragic death
of my poor uncle Don Fernando.

159
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,900
Oh, there’s time to talk of all this…

160
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,850
But, for the moment,
I must beg you to excuse me.

161
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,580
I’ve not yet had the chance
to kiss my dear aunt.

162
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,710
But you’ve no idea how poor
Uncle Fernando contracted the sickness?

163
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Likely, he picked it up
from some wicked woman.

164
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,260
Malaria?

165
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,050
You ask many questions,
my dear nephew.

166
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,900
But the fact that until now
I have never seen you…

167
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,100
…that means nothing to you?

168
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,200
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

169
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,940
I mean simply that if
I don't know what you look like,

170
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,400
it is because of
my life long disinterest

171
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,800
in any and all matters
concerning our family.

172
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,800
I tell you this, so you won't feel
obliged to engage me in small talk.

173
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,300
But of course, excuse me,
my dear aunt,

174
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,100
I'm sure Uncle Fernando's
death upset you dreadfully.

175
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,900
Ha! Upset me?
You're joking!

176
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,300
I was upset that his death
didn't occur some 20 years earlier!

177
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,700
We lived as perfect strangers…

178
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,100
Ask your uncle's best friend,
they shared the master bedroom.

179
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,360
- They were inseparable.
- Really?

180
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,450
- Who was that?
- He called him Assassin.

181
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,500
I see.

182
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh--
Is that who you mean?

183
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Assassin.

184
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,300
What an amusing name!
Is it justified?

185
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,350
And now good night,
my dear nephew.

186
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,500
I hope we see
as little of each other as possible.

187
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,000
Come, Tiger Lily…
you know you can’t read.

188
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Allow me myself to introduce.

189
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,500
Excellence…
Rittmeister Fritz von Merkel,

190
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,060
Personal Aide to
His Excellence, your late uncle.

191
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,610
At your order, Sir.

192
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,530
At ease, Captain, at ease.

193
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,660
And all this bounty
of the gods… you brought it?

194
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,620
I had unexpected good fortune, Herr,
this thoughtful gift for you to receive.

195
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,170
They were the favorite sweets
of His Excellence, Don Fernando.

196
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,090
Thank you.
Bring me some.

197
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,000
Watch out! -
<i>(comic German outrage)

198
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm Sorry, Sir.
I am terribly sorry!

199
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh, but--

200
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,200
Don’t worry, Captain,
it won’t go to waste.

201
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,900
Have a look…

202
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Now what's this, Captain?

203
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,300
Indigestion…
or malaria?

204
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Indigestion?

205
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh-oh! It--
It goes up there.

206
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
Oh, yes. It does.
Thank you.

207
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,750
How could I have known?

208
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,100
They were by the same person
for to always them deliver

209
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,840
to His Excellence,
Don Fernando.

210
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,900
Perfect!
The bodyguard administers the poison.

211
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,100
But, Señora, you can not
believe that I --

212
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,550
All I know is
that incompetence among men...

213
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,500
be they governors
or bodyguards, is

214
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,100
all that’s left to amuse me
in this world.

215
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,690
My dear Miguelito.

216
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,920
Do you know
what this is?

217
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,420
Oh, dear, no.
Tell me.

218
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,100
It is the habit I shall wear
when I enter the convent.

219
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,900
Oh, it's just the thing
for such a place.

220
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,950
Something joyous,
something gay.

221
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,100
Better the convent
than another marriage any day.

222
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,100
And you men, you can’t even imagine
a woman could exist without

223
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,900
your muscled, masculine protection!

224
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,400
Isn't that so, Miguelito?

225
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,300
Well, I --

226
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
I'm a man of peace,
my dear aunt.

227
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,000
One is not even sport.

228
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,350
You four.

229
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Enough!

230
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,010
If you want to stay alive,
you’ve a lot to learn. Now go!

231
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,100
Splendid! Splendid!

232
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,850
But I always thought
this sort of drill...

233
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,310
was conducted with
blunted weapons.

234
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,230
Only real danger and actual bleeding
can teach a man to fight.

235
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,990
Besides, their weapons
are equally as sharp as mine.

236
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,500
Colonel Huerta,

237
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,466
It has taken me only 24 hours
to realize the gravity

238
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:37,470
of the situation here
in Nueva Aragon.

239
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:43,400
May I request you prepare plans
for the security of our people?

240
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,600
I am sure...

241
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,100
I will approve any measures
you would think necessary.

242
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,110
I’m moved by your faith
in me, Your Excellency.

243
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,530
Moreover…

244
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,540
I should be very much
reassured...

245
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,880
if you'd arrange personally...

246
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,420
for my own physical safety.

247
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,900
It would be an honor,
your Excellency!

248
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,100
And I have the very man.
Garcia!

249
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,980
At your service,
Excellency!

250
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,780
Him?

251
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,910
Oh, yes. Him.

252
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,900
Garcia.

253
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,900
Extraordinary!

254
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,300
Well, well.

255
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,100
I assume his appetite is
as great as his strength?

256
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,000
- My appetite?
- Yes.

257
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,900
Seeing as you'll be required to taste
each and every course of my meals.

258
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,100
Colonel Huerta… please.

259
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,500
Now, we'll see how long
Huerta will be happy…

260
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,100
with a weak governor,
instead of a dead one.

261
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,360
Now we’ve got to find the way
to get out of this museum.

262
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,280
You shut up, now.

263
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
What?

264
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,840
He wants to talk to me?

265
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,100
You want to say something?

266
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,400
Well… a secret passage.

267
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,210
How convenient.

268
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,900
Don Fernando’s
road to adventure.

269
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Oh, yes, a stairway.

270
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
We’ll use it to get
some answers.

271
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,500
Thanks.

272
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,850
No, no, no. You want answers?
Go somewhere else.

273
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,560
There're many things I don't like,
including the work I do.

274
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,900
But what I like
least of all…

275
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,600
is people asking questions.

276
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,100
Understand?

277
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,200
They are my goats!
My goats are loose!

278
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,600
Who opened the gate?

279
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,100
¡O - Caramba! Who opened the gate?
¡Manuel, Jose…!

280
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,000
Stop them, please.
I am ruined… ruined!

281
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
Who opened the gate?

282
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
It was done on purpose
to ruin me.

283
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,700
My goats, my pretty goats…

284
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,100
Hurry - get them
back into the pen…

285
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,900
I want them counted.

286
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:13,100
One peso, good for me,
good for people - one peso!

287
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,500
You want some corn, Señor?

288
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,730
Hey, there, brother…

289
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,700
In can't talk, I’m busy.

290
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,910
Listen, my friend, I've
only been here a couple of days.

291
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,100
What can you tell me about
life in Nueva Aragón ?

292
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,400
Oh, no!

293
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,100
Forgive me, Señor.
But you can see what I sell.

294
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,300
It's not much,
and it's not very pretty.

295
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,900
It’s worth only a few centavos,

296
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,500
But I produce it
from the land.

297
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,790
And the land is hard.
It ruins the hands.

298
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,010
But if I talk too strangers,
I’ll risk even what little I have in life.

299
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,300
After all, I have my wife
and children to think about.

300
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,300
Sorry, sir.

301
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,900
Don’t touch!

302
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,700
<i>- They buy?
- They buy.

303
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,300
<i>They pay less these days.

304
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,200
<i>I know, it’s unfair.

305
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,300
No, Señor.
Thanks just the same.

306
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,200
I'm only a wandering minstrel
and I want nothing…

307
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,300
just my song and…
my freedom.

308
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,500
Not the chickens!
Ah my chickens, no!

309
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,500
Why do you stand there -
Get the guard!

310
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,480
Call the guards,
arrest those chickens --

311
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,700
They’re flying away.

312
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,800
Help, somebody.

313
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,900
Ramón, Jose.
Ah, my chickens, my chickens...

314
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,700
I want them back before someone kills them!
I want them counted! Every one counted -

315
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,000
<i>Brothers! Hear me!

316
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,100
Hear me, everybody.

317
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,900
Brothers, my friends, you know
I'm one of you.

318
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,000
We all wear the same rags.

319
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
And we all know the same hunger
in our bellies.

320
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,540
We will one day share the
justice of heaven’s kingdom.

321
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,760
But what about
here and now?

322
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,600
We suffer all too patiently.

323
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,640
We are too full of fear.

324
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,950
Now a new governor has come.

325
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,500
Perhaps he is an honest man,
a just man…

326
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,500
and if he is, why don't we
go to him, all of us together…

327
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,700
and ask him to hear us out?

328
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,500
Clear the street!

329
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,300
I say we should go to him,
all of us together....

330
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,900
Clear the street!
Out of the way!

331
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,700
Brother Francisco, the soldiers.
Come quickly - quickly!

332
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,550
I want that monk!

333
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,600
Find him.

334
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,500
Find the monk.

335
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,780
Where is he?
Who saw him?

336
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,700
I saw him, General…
he went that way.

337
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,800
<i>¡Vamos, vamos, por acqui! etc.

338
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,850
Where did the monk go, huh?

339
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,310
That way.

340
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,990
Listen, I'm not a soldier.
You can trust me.

341
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,240
Where did he go?

342
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,330
All right.
You're coming with me.

343
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,700
We’ll have a little chat with
the man of the goats and chickens.

344
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,800
Chickens!

345
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,600
Make up your mind.

346
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,500
Will you trust me?

347
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,700
All right, you win.

348
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,300
- What's your name?
- Chico.

349
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,500
All right, Chico,
let's find the monk.

350
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,150
And we'll bring his cart back to him
at the same time, all right?

351
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,600
<i>Tell me, Chico, what’s the </i>Z <i>for
that you wrote on the fence?

352
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,250
- It is the sign of Zorro.
- Zorro? Who's Zorro?

353
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,300
He's the spirit of the black fox.

354
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,100
He is a great fighter,
and he always wins. He can never die.

355
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,200
But aren’t you the monk's friend?
You are Christian, aren't you?

356
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,600
Yes, I'm Christian,
but I believe in Zorro, too.

357
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,900
What do you believe?

358
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,300
I believe he'll come back one day
and free all the poor animals.

359
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,100
Only the animals?
What about the people?

360
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,900
Oh! People are too wicked
and too afraid.

361
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,500
They don't deserve
to be free.

362

You don't understand.

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,600
Brother Francisco is
the only good man on Earth.

367
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,440
Yes, Chico.
I do understand.

368

<i>My father’s
the bravest man in the world.

369
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,100

Brother Francisco de la Trinidad…

00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,800
You are accused the fraud
against the merchant Ramiro Valdez…

00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,690
witness here present.

375
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,300
You sold him
rotten, worthless hides.

376
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,000
The hides were perfectly good.

377
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
Why don't you have a look at them?

378
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,100
They were full of worms,
I had to burn them.

379
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,960
You are a liar.

380
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,600
You will also be punished
for insulting an honest tradesman.

381
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,100
You insult the truth,
Señor Magistrado.

382
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,500
Very well, you will also
be held in contempt of court.

383
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,600
Enough of this farce.

384
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,400
You know perfectly well
the sentence has already been written.

385
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,940
And you know the real reasons
for condemning this holy man.

386
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,850
He's guilty only of
protesting injustice.

387
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,070
He's guilty of denouncing cheats,
exploiters, profiteers.

388
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,600
Shut her up!

389
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,900
Ten lashes for fraud…

390

We don't whip innocent

Who are you?

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,640

00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,680
I want to show you
what justice is.

397

First of all, you release
Brother Francisco - Now!

398
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,430
Now arrest the real criminals --

399
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,500
The corrupt judge…
the lying witness…

400
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,810

- Zorro.
 - Zorro?

<i>¡Zorro!

Go home, Brother,

They should see
that the law is fair.

407
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,610
The sentence is...

408
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:35,070
three times the number of lashes
they wanted to give the monk.

409
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,700
Now start!

410
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,700
<i>This is just the beginning.

00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,644
What makes you imagine that
I would want to drag

413
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:56,800
this gallery of
nightmares back to Spain?

414
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Oh.

415
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,200
- Oh! Who is this delightful creature?
- Your cousin…

416
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,500
Hortensia Pulido d'Olvidadez.

417
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,000
- Oh, I must meet her as soon as possible.
- You want to meet her? Poor dear.

418
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,100
Clearly misfortunes
never arrive alone.

419
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,500
Misfortunes?

420
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,800
The Pulido d'Olvidadez
are virtually penniless.

421
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,400
But how is that?

422
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,500
- It’s what they deserve...
- Oh…!

423
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,060
...for conspiring against
the people of Nueva Aragón.

424
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,980
Colonel Huerta,
you startled me.

425
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,190
- You came in like-- like an Assassin.
- What?

426
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,440
Assassin, my uncle's dog.

427
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,500
You were saying that
the Pulidos were conspirators…

428
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,080
There's undeniable
proof of the fact.

429
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,420
How could it be...
conspiracy?

430
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,340
Oh…
just look at that face.

431
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,100
It's all purity,
innocence.

432
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,720
Why do you put up with this?

433
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,200
Don't you see that unless
you throw them off your back,

434
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,700
these people will starve
and enslave you?

435
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,500
You know full well the weights
of your grain, your livestock.

436
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,780
You know those scales
are rigged!

437
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,860
Señorita, stop this instant!

438
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,200
You are trying to cause
trouble for us.

439
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,660
We have enough trouble
with that bandit, Zorro.

440
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,800
I'm here for your protection…

441
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,880
and my presence will teach that
clown to keep his distance.

442
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,900
What clown, Sergeant?

443
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,440
Tell your soldiers
to drop their weapons.

444
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,200
Oh, Zorro!

445
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,730
I need you, Sergeant Garcia.

446
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,530
- And I need you alive.
- Yes, sir.

447
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,000
You heard the gentleman --
Drop your guns by the well.

448
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,700
- Are you’re a born leader, Garcia.
- Yes, Sir.

449
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,950
- Up on a scale.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,700
All right…

451
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,900
let's see.

452
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,300
Only 50 lbs?

453
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,940
So you are full of
hot air, Garcia.

454
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,900
Now, are you ready to order
those thieves to pay a fair price

455
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,820
for a fair weight?

456
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,600
Or you have more tricks
up your sleeve?

457
00:39:55,106 --> 00:39:56,088
Just one!

458
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,050
Not bad, Sergeant.

459
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,400
Have you got another one?

460
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,100
If I catch you
I'll kill you!

461
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,300
Is that a fact!

462
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,020
If at first, you don't....

463
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,000
succeed…
try again!

464
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,000
Keep coming!

465
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,300
Keep coming!

466
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,570
Keep coming!
He's coming!

467
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:31,252
¡Ole!

468
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,900
Stand still! stand still!
You move around so much.

469
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,300
Hold!

470
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,900
You would like that,
wouldn't you?

471
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,700
All right, then.
I'm standing still!

472
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,500
¡Ole!

473
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,800
¡Ole!

474
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,800
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

475
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,800
Bravo!

476
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,500
You moved.

477
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,500
You moved.

478
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,400
- Did I?
- Yes.

479
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,100
I apologize.

480
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,900
Oops, your weapon.

481
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,100
I'm sorry.

482
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,000
¡Ole!

483
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
listen everyone.

484
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Seageant Garcia wants
to return what he stole from you.

485
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,800
Take it all back home with you.

486
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,100
Come on.
Take him!

487
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,600
Take him!

488
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
Let me give a hand!

489
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,600
One.

490
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,750
And two.

491
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,100
Aah!

492
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,350
Oxen, goats…
Go… Go!

493
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,000
Ah, you are the one.

494
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,100
Arrest him! Get the sergeant -
Yes, he did it.

495
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,100
He tried to steal the goats.

496
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,400
He's getting away!

497
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,200
Wear it in pride, Garcia!

498
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,600
Señorita.

499
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,920
Good evening.

500
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,400
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

501
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
José.

502
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,900
I've been waiting for you,
Señorita.

503
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,600
You're safe. Thank god.

504
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,400
I must say
this is the first time

505
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,100
I've seen an aristocrat
take sides with a bandit.

506
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,400
It is innocent people, not bandits

507
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,800
who are pursued
by soldiers here.

508
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,300
Where does your family
stand in all this?

509
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,100
It's a long sad story.

510
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,700
How could it interest you?

511
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:28,150
You forget that I’m here to bring back
justice to this province.

512
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,700
And maybe the joy
into your eyes.

513
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,750
The soldiers! You’d better run.
I'm afraid for you.

514
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,900
Don’t be.

515
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,500
Please go. I beg you.

516
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,800
<i>Hasta la vista, Señorita.

517
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,600
What are you doing here?

518
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,100
Search the house,
question everyone.

519
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,200
But first, bring me
Pulido and his wife.

520
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,400
My parents are not at home.

521
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,600
Then I’ll have to wait for them.

522
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,050
The rest of you
search the outlying areas.

523
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:36,400
The bandit is here somewhere.

524
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,900
Now, you and I must talk.

525
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,940
You won’t be needed.

526
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,130
Why not make the most
of this opportunity?

527
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:28,270
- I'm offering to marry you.
- You stay away from me.

528
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,780
I'm giving you a chance to
redeem your entire family.

529
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,550
I know that at this moment...

530
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,900
it may seem
like a sacrifice to you…

531
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,000
but ultimately…

532
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:55,300
ultimately… you may find it
a pleasurable experience.

533
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,980
There's only one way
you can pay for that.

534
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,570
That's enough, Colonel.

535
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,900
If you don't know how to respect
a woman, I'll have to teach you.

536
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,600
You’re very brave. First you
disarm me… then you challenge me.

537
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,100
I'm just a bandit, remember?

538
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,380
And a bandit will do anything
to get what he wants.

539
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,970
I want you on your knees,
begging forgiveness from this lady.

540
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,430
- You must be mad.
- On your knees.

541
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,900
Now.

542
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,600
- I'm an officer.
- You're an insect. Down!

543
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,900
Never.

544
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,870
Colonel, when I get bored
with tearing your uniform…

545
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,170
I'll cut your heart out.

546
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,800
Swear you will never
offend her again.

547
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,810
I swear.

548
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,900
Please forgive me.

549
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,100
Now, get out.

550
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,000
- You're leaving?
- You'll be safe here.

551
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,390
Take care, please.
I'm still afraid for you.

552
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,600
If only I could help....

553
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,100
You've given me another reason
to live and fight.

554
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,320
That’s help enough.

555
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,900
Thank you.

556
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,030
We shall meet again, bandit!

557
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,400
Look at him
celebrating my departure.

558
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,600
I didn’t expect him to
go into mourning…

559
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,700
but this is ridiculous.

560
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,880
Traveling with so much wealth!

561
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,700
I’ll worry about you.
What about the bandits in the hills?

562
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,090
The bandits of the corliera <i>(sic)</i>?

Zorro must be caught and killed.

suffered these many years, Father.

Splendid a reception.

lifted a finger to help us.

Oh, Cousin Hortensia,
you speak with such confidence.

with your pronouncements.

Gentleman?
I notice no gentleman.

- My my my…
- Colonel Huerta.

648
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,500
Perhaps Señorita Hortensia means...

649
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,100
that the role of a gentleman
can be fulfilled only by a bandit.

650
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,600
If you refer to Zorro,
Colonel Huerta,

651
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,900
you already know
that I’ve had ample opportunity...

652
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,700
to compare that so-called bandit
with the likes of you.

From now on the doors of
this apartment will be sealed.

01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,620
I alone will have the keys.

A double rope connecting
this room to the outer chambers.

01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,500
Every quarter of an hour
I will pull the first rope.

01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,100
The bell will ring…
here.

674
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:32,000

by pulling the other rope here,

01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,000
signaling…
that everything is well.

676
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,510

Tied in chains…
and dragged around publicly…

683
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:16,440
until Zorro comes
out of hiding to rescue her.

684
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:22,500
But... but Colonel,
she's an aristocrat, my own cousin.

685
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,500
Oh, no, no…
no, I can't--

686
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,950
It's a matter of life and death,
Your Excellency.

687
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,500
- Your life.
- Ooh! My life!

688
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,200
- Your death.
- Ooh… my death.

689
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,150
Hurry up! Get in!

Go!

 - Through the front door.

693

- No time to talk.

 - Leave! How?

With the key.

696
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,800
I knew Huerta and the guards
were waiting for me in the streets.

697
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,700
So I came here instead.

698
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,400
I had time to prepare your escape.

699
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,600
Brother Francisco will hide you.

01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,300
And Huerta will
look like a fool he is.

701
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,800
But the guards are all here now,
how can we get by them?

702
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,850
I’ve arranged some
surprises for them. You'll see.

703
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:50,150
Turn left and go
into the second door.

704
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:01,000
What was that?
Go and see.

705
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,700
Zorro!

706
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,200
Zorro!

707
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,360
Break it open.

708
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:52,500
<i>(gulp!)

709
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,300
<i>Ahh, caramba…
¡Arm, people!

710
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,300
<i>(general panicked alarm)

711
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,100
<i>¡No escaparán! Por aquí-

712
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,640
C’mon.

713
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,400
- My horse is down there, go
straight to the mission./ - And you?

714
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,800
Idiot! Idiot!
If they escape you’ll all be shot!

715
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,620
Hurry up! Go!

716
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,400
<i>Forget about the girl —
Get Zorro!

717
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:25,300
<i>(Indistinct panic and alarm)

718
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,300
<i>This way - follow me, men.

719
01:15:34,223 --> 01:16:04,889
<i>(Theme Song - “Zorro’s Back’)

720
01:16:20,723 --> 01:16:22,240
Quickly, after him!

721
01:16:23,655 --> 01:16:39,107
<i>(theme song continues)

722
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,100
<i>(Indistinct Spanish)

723
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,400
Of course!

724
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,890
There’s only one other person
who knew of this plan.

725
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,800
Of course…
What plan?

726
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,800
Come with me.

727
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:00,030
A horse! A horse!
Get me a horse!

728
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,910
A horse.
My kingdom for a horse.

729
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,160
Come with me.

730
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:29,300
The keys to the governor's room,
give them to me.

731
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,100
Impossible. Without orders from his
Excellence, nobody gets the keys.

732
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,700
If you don't give me the keys,
I kill you.

733
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,620
I'll give you the keys.

734
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,600
All right, get down.
Get down, Assassin.

735
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,840
Open the door.

736
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,900
Look, I'm on your side,
but you’ll have to cooperate.

737
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,240
Slide under the bed.

738
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,900
My apologies,
Your Excellency.

739
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,090
Colonel Huerta?

740
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,000
W-W-What is going on?

741
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,760
Zorro has rescued
Hortensia Pulido…

742
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,500
from the fortress.

743
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,500
He was waiting there for her.

744
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:39,000
He seemed to be aware of
each and every aspect of our plans.

745
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,300
Well, that's impossible.

746
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,200
Impossible, maybe,
but it happened.

747
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,643
Only one person besides myself
knew this plan - you.

748
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,800
But Excellency,
I could say the same thing.

749
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,600
Colonel, have you gone mad?

750
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,580
If I were mad…
would I be here?

751
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,880
W-W-What do you mean?

752
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:06,010
I'm here for one purpose and
one purpose only - to capture Zorro…

753
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,900
… and to see him hanged.

754
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,200
Oh!

755
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,310
Fair enough, Colonel.

756
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:22,480
- I think there's only one thing I can do.
- Oh, yes…

757
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,610
I agree.

758
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:30,450
You recall the message?
I'm the one Zorro wishes to destroy.

759
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,620
Therefore, I'm the one
who must serve as bait.

760
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:41,330
- You?
- How else can we tempt him?

761
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:47,130
It's his life...
or mine own.

762
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,900
It's not that I doubt your abilities,
Sergeant Garcia…

763
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,100
but are you sure
you've seen to everything?

764
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,100
The forest is alive with
soldiers, Your Excellency.

765
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:12,300
Every shrub, every tree,
every rock on each bank,

766
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,600
conceals men armed to the neck…

767
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,700
… and ready to defend you.

768
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,100
Very well, then…

769
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,750
we shall carry out the plan
to the letter… furiously.

770
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,600
Now, real fishermen always separate.

771
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,470
You'll go downstream, and I’ll
go further up. Good luck.

772
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,900
There he is --
out there!

773
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,600
Follow!

774
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,600
- Garcia.
- Yes, Sir.

775
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:28,900
- Garcia, where’s the Governor?
- I don't know where he is.

776
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,400
He was over there behind that rock.

777
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,200
But now he's gone.
It's not my fault.

778
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,700
There he is.

779
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:41,800
Is he alone?

780
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,100
Headed toward the plain.

781
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,510
Well, get after him!

782
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,700
Bu- But--
what about His Excellency?

783
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,700
Are we just going to abandon him?

784
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,600
Garcia, if you still think
the Governor’s around here

785
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,300
you’re a bigger fool
than I think you are.

786
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,300
Oh, look! Look, I got one.
I got one!

787
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,222
What is it you were saying, Colonel?

788
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,100
You see? Heh!

789
01:23:08,033 --> 01:24:49,445
There's no time for explanations,
Your Excellency.

790
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,200
Get after him.

791
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,105
<i>¡A me, muchachos!

792
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,400
Oh, but you're not going to
leave me all alone?

793
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,099
At least, allow Sergeant Garcia
to stay with me.

794
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,800
With pleasure!

795
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,666
It's a trout!
He took it hook, line and sinker.

aside for a minute.

the carriage for a nap.

than to tell me Zorro’s been captured.

my sword is coming.

- Garcia.
- Yes, Sir?

836
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,700
Your governor’s inside the carriage,
trussed up like a chicken.

837

Now, either you do
what I tell you,

838
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:17,680

stuffed and fed to the dog.

Drop your guns, men.

01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:34,900
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you’re not!

877
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,300
- Halt!
- <i>¡Alto!

878
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,000
- Where’s Zorro?
- Zorro!

879
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:07,260
You go that way.
The rest of you come with me.

880
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:10,430
<i>¡Vamos- etc!-

881
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:42,750
- What do you think you are doing?
- I'm coming with you.

882
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,750
- You’re mad.
- Yes, about you.

883
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:46,720
What?

884
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:48,900
I love you.

885
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,200
Huerta!

886
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,700
There he is!

887
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,600
Look!

888
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:13,900
Whoa…

889
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,200
You must go now,
for you must live.

890
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:19,270
The people need you
more than ever.

891
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,140
Go… go.

892
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,500
So it's over.

893
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,360
The bandit is dead.

894
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,600
And as for the Governor…

895
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,600
well, at least he will have
the hero's death.

896
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,000
Now Nueva Aragón
have a new governor.

897
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:26,540
And you… if your father knows
what's good for him,

898
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,920
you will have a husband.

899
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:15,900
So, so…
Fire on Christ, if you dare.

900
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:18,600
With Chirst we ask for justice.

901
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:22,120
With Jesus on our side,
we demand our freedom.

902
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,700
You may thank your God…

903
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:28,800
that in honor of this occasion,
I’ve decided to pardon you.

904
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:31,080
Only God can pardon.

905
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:32,800
In this very church...

906
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,600
you contrive to profane
the Lord’s sacrament.

907
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,600
Down on you knees!

908
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:40,969
And pray for his mercy.

909
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:45,100
Guards - arrest this… priest.

910
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,010
Arrest him!

911
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,100
<i>¡Detenerlo!

912
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,350
<i>¡¡Detenerlo!!

913
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:21,700
I'm afraid this bell is ringing
for you, Colonel Huerta.

914
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:24,500
- Zorro!
- You have the rebellion on your hands.

915
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,890
The blood of your victims
cries for justice.

916
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:28,900
And justice will be done.

917
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,100
Zorro! He's alive.
Zorro can never die!

918
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,940
<i>¡¡¡Detenerlo!!!

919
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,610
Guards! Fire, fire!

920
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,990
Don't shoot… don't shoot!

921
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,700
No!

922
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,600
Huert--

923
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,700
You fool!

924
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,700
This demonstration is illegal!

925
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:42,700
Ask for more soldiers and make—

926
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,900
Guards, retake order.

927
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,600
Come on!

928
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,100
Come with me.

929
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:18,600
You almost got away
with it, Colonel -

930
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,900
But you pushed these
good people a little too far.

931
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:28,600
And now they're going to
push you back.

932
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,800
The murder of Brother Francisco...

933
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:02,330
releases me from the promise
I made to another man of peace…

934
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:10,040
who you butchered!
It's easy to kill saints, Colonel.

935
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,420
Let’s see how you do
against a sinner.

936
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:33,740
Come on…

937
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:37,240
defend yourself.

938
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:45,160
I'll have that mask off you…

939
01:45:46,330 --> 01:45:48,790
even if I have to chase you
to hell for it.

940
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,400
You’ll kill no more, Colonel…
no more.

941
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:44,900
He's dead.

942
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,000
He's dead!

943
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,900
The bandit is dead!

944
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:53,600
He's dead!

945
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:59,900
Dead…
Who's dead?

946
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,700
Zorro is dead!

947
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:13,800
Zorro is dead!

948
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:15,900
Not quite.

949
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,700
The game not over yet, Colonel.

950
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,700
Have no fear, Colonel Huerta,
Garcia’s here…

951
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,600
Now bandit,

952
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:31,900
one of us must die.

953
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,000
Well, then,

954
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:37,900
let it be the moment of truth.

955
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:44,200
You.

956
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,900
Your Excellency.

957
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:54,800
Now!

958
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:19,700
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

959
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:21,700
Hurrah!

960
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:56,100
<i>(song) Here’s to being free, to flying high…
La-la-la-la, Zorro’s back…!
