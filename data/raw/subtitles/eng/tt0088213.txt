175
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,116
You sing real nice.

176
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,651
Thank you.

178
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,823
no fooling?

179
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:35,762
Listen, um, find yourself
another girl, okay?

180
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,731
Good luck, sweetie.

181
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,535
Hey, biscuits, you said
I could sing tonight, remember?

182
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,838
I got to get
a big name up there.

183
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,840
What do you mean,
a big name?

184
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,442
Come on. You said
I could sing tonight.

185
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,244
I got a gold mine here.

186
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:55,247
This could be a first-class hall
if I play it right.

187
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,850
I'm talking Helen Forrest,
Jenny Sims, Joe Stafford,

188
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,451
not Hazel Zanussi.

189
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,588

dancing during the war?

190
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,323
No, tell me.

191
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,558
Everybody.

192
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,560

193
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,562
Here you go, boss.

194
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,766

195
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,843

doesn't she?

196
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:27,113
Jesus.

197
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:30,382
So the girls go for me.
Is that my fault?

198
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,985
No, I just sort of thought
that you and I

199
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,487
were going
to get respectable, biscuits.

200
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,123
It's finished. Satisfied?

201
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,959

something to do?

202
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,531

call it, Jack?
